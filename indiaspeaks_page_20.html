I don't drink,smoke etc so the place having a good pub culture is not a requirement for me.\n\nI have lived majority of my life in Mumbai. It was easy to make friends, be a part of different communities etc but I have heard a ton of complaints from outsiders about difficulty finding a place to live as a bachelor/bachelorette. I hated the climate but at the same time the city offered a lot of nature and things to do. The rent is quite ridiculous too and I did not like up-down style of commute/bottlenecks. Going anywhere felt like it would take 30 mins to an hour and the traffic/road system seem to be a mess.\n\nI have since moved to Pune and the weather is an improvement from the humid heat, although it does get quite hot in summer. There is less traffic but the road system is no less of a mess and the structure of the city seems just as haphazard as Mumbai. The people and culture seems just as much or even more open-minded and non-judgmental than Mumbai. But the city by itself seems to offer very little of nature and things to do and feels very small overall. The lower rents are an improvement too. Overall Pune seems like a good upgrade yet feels very 'okayish' to me.\n\nSo I wanted to know what are some other good/better options for me from you guys.

      <li>Title::: 'Hey r/IndiaSpeaks, I need your help in improving our education system.'<br />Body: "Disclaimer: This was first posted on the official Indian subreddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey  friends, I need your help. My name is Mehul, and I am a college student. I'm still relatively young (19), but I have realized that the Indian education system is a complete mess when it comes to practical knowledge. I do believe that it is relatively well-constructed when it comes to theory and concepts, but most of you will agree that there’s still a lot that needs to be done when it comes to presenting actual, useful information to kids.\n\nAnd I am going to try and do that. Look, I am not CBSE, but I still think my idea would help in making the lives of students better across our country. There’s a TLDR at the bottom, but if you have the time, please read the entire post:\n\nAs a kid, we all want to be something spectacular. An astronaut, a spy, a race car driver. But as we get older, these dreams start dying out. Sometimes it is due to growing out of those things, or finding a new passion. But most of the times, that’s not the case. The issue is lack of information.\n\nThere is just not enough real, factual, well-documented information on the internet regarding career options, especially in an Indian context. Thus, when faced with a severe absence of information, kids tend to go with the “safer” options, where the path to success, even though it’s difficult, is clearly visible. Clear JEE, become an engineer. Clear UPSC, become an IAS officer.\n\nNot that there’s anything wrong with these career options, but I believe that kids (and I am counting even 19 to 22-year-olds as kids here) have the right to complete information about all possible career options, so that they can make a decision according to their own personal parameters.\n\nIf they want to do something that they are passionate about, that’s cool. If they just want to do something that will provide them with the most amount of money, that’s also cool.\n\nI personally know many people who are filled with regrets because they chose a path that’s not compatible with their personalities. Hell, one of my closest friends, who is studying to become a game developer, hates it because he did not realize that game development would require a lot of mathematics, a subject that he despises. He is now switching to web design, which requires little to no mathematics, but still, a lot of time and energy has been wasted.\n\nI want to help people in preventing this, and channelize their time, energy and money towards the right things for them; and thus, I have decided to create a website that would answer the basic question of “How to become a X in India”, where X can be anything from textile engineer to film composer.\n\nMost “career-related” websites have a few problems. They provide little-to-no information about salaries, growth opportunities, travel requirements or really anything else. The information that they do have is usually unauthentic, simply copy-pasted from somewhere else on the internet. They don’t tell you what your daily life would be like, or whether the work-life balance would be adequate or not.\n\nThe only thing they do give you is a useless, generic list of ‘skills required’; that when you think about it, would be applicable to most careers/jobs anyway. Examples being teamwork, discipline, time management, etc. Even with quantitative things like salary, such portals only provide you with a wrong estimate of starting salary. What about the salary after 10 years of experience? Or salary near retirement, if it’s that kind of a job?\n\nApart from this, the other option is to go for career counselling, but the quality of the so called “career-experts” in our country is average at best, and they also charge a very high price for providing something that should be available to every student for free, which deprives kids from a particular socio-economic status in receiving that information.\n\nThis is against my fundamental belief – Kids have the right to obtain complete and accurate information about all possible career options for free, in a well-written, easy-to-read manner.\n\nThere’s also the following paradox: There is no way for kids to know what being an architect, an accountant or a botanist would feel like until they actually become one. I will try to solve this problem by making a section called a Day in the life of X for each career, where they will get to know what does an X actually do on a day-to-day basis in India.\n\nIn addition to this, the website will also have helpful sections such as recommended resources (books, YouTube channels, websites), salary at various different levels of experience, degree (required or optional), a plan of action that gives clear steps, and much more for each career.\n\nOkay, great. But why do I need your help? While I was working on this idea of mine, I came across a very surprising thing which shocked me to my core – I am not the smartest man in the country who knows everything about each career option. Therefore, I come to you. If you are employed right now or have ever made money doing something, please consider filling the google form linked below and telling me some stuff about your job.\n\nIt will hardly take 3-4 minutes of your time, but it will definitely help a lot of students across our entire country; who are a part of an education system which does not provide them with this basic information.\n\nMost of the stuff requires one-word answers or it is a multiple-choice question, and I promise that I won’t ask you for your email or phone number. If you desire, you will be credited as one of the authors when the article is published on the website.\n\nTLDR; I am making a website that is going to provide Indian students with all the information that they might need about any particular career –salaries, resources, job profiles and much more. If you are earning money or have ever earned money doing something, please fill out the google form linked below to tell me more about your job (it will hardly take 3-4 minutes). Thank you for your help in making our education system better.\n\n[Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1cKoQXtHvCvR-afLfLei5t1MbbLnYDf8yGhoo-4itHoA/edit?usp=drivesdk)\n\nPS: If you are unemployed currently, or if you are a student, you can also help by pressing the upvote button and sharing this to increase visibility.

Combining that with the triple mutated virus which has the capacity to skip the bodily immunity, there is a huge risk that we will be in the dark regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine.

      <li>Title::: 'Ashok Kumar Nite: When rape &amp; murder of dozens of women was celebrated as "the rise of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie”'<br />Body: '&gt;Calcutta was the HQ of Birla, JK, Bangur, and Thapar and Tata. The grand Tata Centre was built for that purpose. This was the vision of TATA’S. Most of their investment was in Jamshedpur. Most foreign companies had their India HQs in Calcutta. This was the reason Calcutta had best of the Clubs in the country. It had the highest number of International flights, Bombay used to serve mainly Aden, Muscat, and East Africa.\n\n&gt;And then mega cultural show ‘Ashok Kumar Nite’ was organized in February 1968 in Rabindra Sarobar Stadium of Calcutta. It was a 50,000 strong audience. Dozens of girls and women were dragged out and their raped naked dead bodies were found in and around the Rabindra Sarobar (lake) over the next two days. The CPM leaders (Jyoti Basu &amp; Co) called that mass rape and murder of girls and women as “the rise of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie” and justified the mass crime.\n\n&gt;Calcutta started emptying. Soon after, Aditya Birla was dragged out of his car between GPO and RBI, opposite Writers Building, thrashed, clothes torn, stripped down to his undergarments and made to walk like that to his office at 15 India Exchange Place. With a crowd roaring in laughter and jeering, he went home and took a flight to Bombay, never to return. He took all his money and offices out of Bengal. Today they are one of the top industrial houses in the country.\n\n&gt;So did JK and Thapar, within a month. So did most entrepreneurs, so did most MNCs. Latest example was ousting of Tata Nano car manufacturing plant. Those were ‘Mass Exodus’ of money and employment from the state. Today no Industrial house plans to start any project in the state. That being the dream that the Communists of West Bengal wanted to materialize, and there is no change in the present Trinamool Congress government too.\n\n&gt;Communists in West Bengal started their political anarchic ‘power game’ from ‘Ashok Kumar Nite’ in 1968 and went through ‘Sain Bari killings’ in 1970, ‘Marichjhapi massacre’ in 1979, ‘Bijon Setu massacre’ of 1982 to ‘Bantala gang rape’ of 1990, ‘Nanoor massacre’ of 2000 and ‘Nandigram massacre’ of 2007. They destroyed the work culture and closed down thousands of factories in West Bengal in the name of Trade Union and classless society. Communists made West Bengal a burial ground in 34 years of their rule.\n\nhttps://jharkhandstatenews.com/article/musings-on-life/282/bengal-fading-away-thanks-to-jyoti-basu-mamata/\n\nhttps://myvoice.opindia.com/2021/03/how-west-bengal-was-destroyed/\n\nhttps://www.indiafacts.org.in/commentary/existential-struggle-not-just-an-election/\n\n&gt;Saha has also seen the decay of Bengal in front of his eyes. “I admit this with a sense of helplessness and the urge to do something.

Every private company had unlimited access to funds for developing and manufacturing the best vaccine for every American.\n.\nAmong these, three companies have been unsuccessful in producing the vaccine, including Glaxo-Smithkline, which received about US$ 2.5 Billion (INR 18,840 Crore).\n.\nNot a single US politician or the public protested or cried foul when such a massive taxpayers\' amount was distributed to private companies for creating vaccines - because the Americans know the importance of industry and how strong, powerful and advanced industry sector is the only solution to any problem.\n.\nHere, politics has already begun on Government of India paying only INR 4500 Crore to SII and Bharat Biotech for scaling up vaccine production.

They are weak and cannot prepare food for themselves currently. \n\nMy natural response was - you can use Swiggy / Zomato.

Later, we managed to find her a guy from a Facebook group who catered to her demand. \n\nThis got me thinking, that with rise in COVID cases this exact situation must have been faced by so many people and there is a need for website from where you can order homecooked food from your neighbors.

I am waiting for google maps api approval post which it should be functional. \n\nA simple website wherein you can list if you can provide food to anyone in your neighbourhood and get it delivered. We will not charge any commission and the buyer can pay directly to the seller once they receive the food. \n\nEven though I wanted to take up this task all by myself, I realized that I won’t be able to make amy significant impact working alone. \n\nSo I am here looking for someone (preferably from IT background to polish the website a bit) who can help me run this website so that we can help those in need.

      <li>Title::: 'The Vaccine Politics'<br />Body: 'Taken from Gaurav Pradhan blog. Would like to know your feedback.\n\n\n\nThere is an ongoing clash between US &amp; Europe over vaccines. Some of the news about vaccine efficacy or safety which we read is more about the Vaccine War than any real problem. \n\nIndian vaccine manufacturing surge has displeased both west and the International Pharma lobby and even China. All are out with knives and then we have no shortage of volunteers who will happily stab India in the back. \n\nRussian vaccine Sputnik was dismissed mockingly by West almost like “What do Russians know about science".\n\nIndian vaccines sent abroad is harming business interests of Pfizer and Moderna. Many "Big people" have invested a lot in pharma companies. \nIndia vaccinating it’s people for Free or just Rs.250 is eliminating  potential Billion dollar  profits for the Worlds BIG Vaccine Players. \n\nThere is a suspicion that raw material for  making Indian vaccines is coming from USA and some curbs are being put on it to slow down India. Hence India was more keen to push totally indigenous Covaxin. We know who all were paid to abuse and defame Covaxin. Chattisgarh state which is almost a Tropical Vatican still doesn’t allow Covaxin to be used in the State. \n\nOn whose behest is it.  Let’s all guess. Think about naxal attack and Madvi Hidma and then extrapolate. Anyone who knows Chhattisgarh will know who is supplying arms and cash to the  Communists.\n\nIndia manufactures 60% of vaccines made in the world. Asking it to import vaccines is like asking Saudi to buy oil.\n\nAlready Novaxin and Sputnik are going to be made in India soon. But it  is not like making paper cups. Will take a few months. Till then we have to make do with Covaxin and Covishield. \n\nWe have two credible proven choices. Pay Rs 250 in a less crowded  setting or get it free with a longer queue.  Vaccines  are perishable items with a shelf life and can only be stocked in limited quantity in special storage facilties.  So one  have to wait for their turn. \n\nCompanies like Pfizer and Moderna refuse to test its safety and efficacy on Indians. They must  follow Indian regulations to be able to sell in India. \n\nThe cold chain needed for Moderna and Pfizer is not available in India. We can not allow to administer dated or spoiled medication to our people  because our skin is  brown. The possibility that vaccines discarded in developed world may be pushed to India can not be ruled out. \n\nWhen such vaccines come to our shores, it will also come with massive misinformation campaign to  defame Indian vaccines. Fake news on death and adverse side effects of Indian vaccines will be plenty.\n\nRemember how Coconut oil, groundnuts oil, mustard oil was defamed by an onslaught of fake news and fake study reports to convince Indians to buy all sorts of concocted Seed Oils by the MNC agro companies. \n\nSo vaccine is now the talking point when few months ago the same ecosystem was mocking Indian  vaccines\n \nHave Faith in India'<br />Author: 'Aye_chup'  id: 'mutmht'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mutmht/the_vaccine_politics/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'A history of the conflict between the Mongol Empire and the Delhi Sultanate, between the 13th and early 14th centuries'<br />Body: '(From my answer to a question at r/ AskHistorians)\n\n\nWe can start by placing things into context.\n\n\nTo do so, we need to understand the political situations in the Mongolian Empire and the Delhi Sultanate during the period between the death of Chinggis Khan and the last major Mongolian invasions into India. This period spans the tenure of two dynasties at Delhi, the Mamlukes and the Khaljis. But let\'s start with the Mongols first.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nMONGOL EMPIRE :\n\n\nWhen the Great Khan Chinggis or Genghis, died in 1227 CE, he left behind an Empire that spanned the modern day regions of Mongolia, to the Hindu Kush and  orth eastern Persia. He was succeeded by his son Ogodei in 1229, after an assembly (quraltai) of the tribes. And it wouldn\'t be until 1241, that they first attempted an incursion into the territory of the Delhi Sultanate. During the reign of Ogodei we see 3 major events that not only built up pressure on the border between the Sultanate and the Mongol Empire but also resulted in the first confrontation between a Sultanate force and the Mongols:\n\n1) In 1235, after the first *quraltai* roughly 20,000 Mongol troops advanced on the Qarlughids, a small Turkic tribe which controlled Ghazni at the time. The Mongols advanced into Kabul, Ghazna and Zabulistan and the ruling Qarlughid, Hasan Qarlugh was forced to accept a Mongol resident at his court.\n\n2) In 1235, after the second *quraltai*  in the same year, Mongols moved further troops into the region. They sacked Kashmir and attacked the Qarlughids a second time although they were their tributaries now. Further, they invested Uchch and conquered territory on the very fringes of the Sultanate. In 1241, attacked Lahore and took the city while Bahram Shah was the Sultan of Delhi, whose response was very disappointing for the army and the nobles.\n\n3) In 1245-6, the Mongols attacked a third time, taking Multan from Hassan Qarlugh who had taken the province during the lull in hostilities. The Mongols once again invested Uchch but this time a force of the Sultanate. This force was commanded in part by Ghiyasuddin Balban (more on him later)\n\nWhat followed after the death of Ogodei in 1241, however was a period of turbulence, intrigue, uncertainty and fratricidal conflict within the Empire until finally in 1260, the Empire broke into civil war. The fragmentation of the Empire was only resolved in 1304, when the Western Khanates namely the Ilkhanate, the Golden Horde and the Chagatai Khanate, accepted the nominal supremacy of the Yuan dynasty of Kublai Khan. However, this peace did not imply the same singular leadership and the unification of the Mongols as under Genghis Khan. Border conflicts were a regular occurrence, and the 4 Khanates functioned and operated as seperate entities, until each fell in its own time.\n\nNow we turn our attention to the Delhi Sultanate, to understand their perspective of the events that unfolded during this period.\n\nDELHI SULTANATE :\n\n1) THE MAMLUKE DYNASTY \n\nThe Ghurid Sultanate ruled by Muizuddin of Ghur was divided among his Mamlukes or Turkish slaves in 1206 after his death. Two slaves Yalduz and Qutbuddin Aibak, divided the Sultanate, the former creating the Khwarezmian Empire and the latter creatung the Delhi Sultanate. While, Yalduz ruled at Ghazni, he also claimed to rule over Delhi, which was unacceptable to Aibak who ruled from Lahore. Hence, the Delhi Sultans cut their ties with Ghazni early on, distancing from Central Asian politics.\n\nAibak died in 1210, leaving his Sultanate still in a fragile state to Iltutmish (1210-1236) whose reign saw the wester border being secured, and expansion of the Sultanate in the east. After Iltutmish died however, his daughter was placed on the Throne according to his own wishes, but tragically she met a quick end by 1239 when Turkish chieftains revolted and removed her from power. What follows was a period of struggle between the monarchy and the Turkish chiefs, until one Turkish noble, Ulugh Khan, known in history as the aforementioned Ghiyasuddin Balban took the throne after much intrigue and conspiracy in 1265.\n\nBalban was a brutal man for a brutal age, but he was no mere brute either, for he possessed the intellect to see past court intrigue and focus on objectives that mattered. He constantly sought ways to increase his prestige and power and that of the monarchy. He reorganised the army to a more centralised structure and also employed spies at all levels of the military and beaurocratic structure to keep himself well informed of any plots and conspiracies against him. He pensioned off old and unfit soldiers, reorganised the military department called the Diwan-i-Arz and created bodyguard corps to guard the person of the Sultan at court, in public and on the battlefield.\n\nIn 1220, when the Mongols attacked and later dismantled and overthrew the Khwarezmians, the reason for them not invading India can be credited to two factors. 1)That Chinggis Khan, in a display of understanding and observance of international practice, chose to refrain from attacking a state which had elected to remain neutral in the conflict. 2) That he was far too preoccupied with the suppression and conquest at hand to be bothered with another theatre into India. Either way, from that period itself, the Mongol threat was as apparent as it would ever be. \n\nHence, after assuming the throne in 1265, Balban adopted a policy of both force and diplomacy:\n\n1) He repaired border forts in crucial regions such as Tabarhinda, Sunam and Samana and garrisoned strong forces in them.\n\n2) He sent diplomatic envoys to the Mongol Il-Khan of Iran, Hulagu and received the diplomats of the same with grandiose style and display to appease the Il-Khan. \n\n3) He chose to leave a chunk of western Punjab to the Mongols. And while the Mongols didn\'t attack Delhi, ill defined borders meant annual raids\n\n4) To meet the aforementioned challenge, Balban stayed at Delhi, refusing to go on extensive campaigns into the subcontinent, in order to focus on and meet Mongol incursions head on. Which he did annually.\n\n5) He managed to establish a defensive line due to his efforts, the Multan-Beas line, which his own son died while protecting.\n\nBalban died in 1286, but left behind a strong foundation to defend the Sultanate against the Mongols.\n\n2) KHALJI DYNASTY\n\nAfter Balban\'s death, Delhi was once again in confusion. Meanwhile, the incompetent successors he had left behind squabbled for the throne. It was owing to these factors that a group of Khalji (Turko-Afghan tribe) nobles, led by Jalal-ud-din who had been a warden of the western marches and was a commander who had won against the Mongols, overthrew the successors of Balban and Jalal-ud-din took the throne in 1290.\n\nIn 1292, Jalal-ud-Din defeated a major Mongol advance to Delhi under a grandson of Hulagu, Abdullah, who lead a force of 150,000 horses (contemporary figure, modern estimates differ), along the border defensive line of Tabarhinda, Sunam etc. After the battle, roughly 4000 Mongols, surrendered and converted to Islam at the edge of the sword, and were accepted as refugees in Delhi.\nIn 1296, Jalal-ud-Din was assassinated and succeeded by his nephew and son-in-law, Alauddin Khalji. \n\n\nIt was finally under the reign of Alauddin Khalji that the the Delhi Sultanate took rigourous steps to counted the ever present Mongol threat and indeed, push them all the way to the Indus. This was possible due to the reforms he introduced into the state and army. \n\nALAUDDIN KHALJI\'S REFORMS :\n\n1) The territory of the Delhi Sultanate included that administered by the Sultan directly or his beaurocracy (Khalisa lands), his vassal\'s territory and that of his Iqta holders, (Iqta holders were nobles given tracts of land to collect revenue from and raise forces out of this revenue to support war efforts). Alauddin incorporated large tracts of non-Khalisa lands into Khalisa category.\n\n2) He imposed 50% *kharaj* or agricultural land tax on all agricultural holdings in these lands\n\n3) He introduced strict price controls and made sure that prices of essentials (food grains, meat) and horses never went above his price ceiling. This ensured that soldiers paid lower wages could live satisfactory lives and the Sultan could raise Imperial troops in large numbers of cavalry.\n\n4) He set up special shops and markets for sale of essentials and horsed and and made sure to appoint officials here to avoid cheating and malpractice.\n\n5) He raised a large force of cavalry, and paid them in cash, which he acquired by obligating his subjects in Khalisa lands to pay taxes in cash rather than kind. And to make sure his farmers could pay said taxes in cash he ensured that local, informal intermediaries known as *banjaras* would be registered and ordered to trade in farm produce in cities and rural areas.\n\nTHE CONFRONTATION AND COUNTER \n\nTherefore, during his reign of 1296-1316, he constantly improved the state of affairs to the point where he could defeat repeated Mongol Chagatai invasions sent by their Khan Dawa. \n\nFirst under Dawa Khan\'s son Qutlugh Khwaja, in 1299, with a force of 200,000 men ( contemporary figures, modern estimates differ) when the Mongols cut off communications for Delhi, surrounded it and even entered a number of streets. Alauddin faced the Mongols outside Delhi in a Battle and thanks to the personal bravery of a general by the name of Zafar Khan, the Mongols were forced to withdraw.\n\nOnce again, the Mongols arrived in 1303, while Alauddin was in Rajputana on a campaign. Khalji rushed back, fortified himself at Siri near Delhi and waited out the siege despite great hardships and pains, finally sapping Mongol morale and forcing them to withdraw.\n\nIn 1305, the tables had turned and at the Battle of Amroha, a 30,000 strong Sultanate army, under Malik Nayak defeated the Mongols with great slaughter. According to the 16th century historian Firishta, the heads of 8000 Mongols were used to build the Siri fort.\n\nIn 1306, another army of the Mongols sent by Dawa Khan was defeated by Malik Kafur. Dawa Khan died next year and no further Mongol incursions were attempted during the reign of the Khaljis. Following this defeat, lost territory was retaken and the boundary of the Sultanate once again touched the Indus. \n\nCONCLUSION :\n\nThe 13th century was a period during which the Delhi Sultanate faced one of its biggest existential threats. The Mongol empire, had it been united, and prepared in the early 13th might have crushed all resistance in the Northern part of the Indian subcontinent and would have flushed into the plains of North India. However, due to their own instability and preoccupation, as well as die to the reign and reforms of strong Sultans who had the foresight to focus on objectives that were of absolute importance, and rise above court intrigue and petty disputes, the Sultanate was spared complete extinction.\n\nSOURCES :\n\n\nSatish Chandra, "A History of Medieval India", Chapters 6 and 7.\n\n\nPeter Jackson, "The Delhi Sultanate : A Political and Military History", Chapters 6,9,11 and 12.\n\n\n"Tarikh-i-Firoz-Shahi" by Ziauddin Barani.'<br />Author: 'MaharajadhirajaSawai'  id: 'muscut'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/muscut/a_history_of_the_conflict_between_the_mongol/</li>

Especially from my dad, you may think I have daddy issues… that’s just a funny way to put the suffering I went through everyday. In all ways I was an average kid, and growing up not in a very privileged family already made me very conscious about my looks, style and what not. On top of this the neglect I received from my family was just cherry on top. I became a super introvert and anxious kid, hardly having any friends. So, why was I so neglected ? because my father thought that’s how you make your kids tough… if my mother sometimes used to pamper me a bit or just be polite to me he thought of it as spoiling me. But now when I look back at it, I realize it was just his way to justify his behavior towards me to himself. \n\nHe cheated my mom for such a long time, maybe with multiple partners. My mom had her doubts, but she was never sure about it. But I was pretty sure because I caught him red handed. \n\nThere was so much domestic violence that you can’t even imagine… I used to go to sleep in fear and wake in fear of the violence, loud noises and what not. \n\nBut now I’m just trying to move past it.

      <li>Title::: 'Stop Domestic Violence! If you see, Please report it!'<br />Body: ' I\'m 17F living in India. I live in a joint family where, my dad and his family (me, my brother, and my mom), my dad\'s younger(my uncle) brother and his family, along with my Grandfather and Grandmother, all live together. It was today that my aunt was physically abused. Not just any normal physical abuse, he literally grabbed her by the neck, stepped on her, kicked her on her nose, kicked her on her stomach, grabbed her hair, and pulled it so hard some of it was torn off her head. She was bleeding all from her nose and her hand was injured, he even tried to hurt her with a knife, kicked her, and attacked like a beast.\n\nAnd it has all happened when me and my mom, both were protecting her and my dad was trying to stop him. He beat her like an animal, no, like a beast, a monster. Very brutally. I cried, yelled at him, no matter what is her fault, this is not the way to treat the person you\'re married to. They have a daughter which is just 6, and she saw all of it happen! Just what might be going in her mind right now? I was upset. Very upset and very angry. I told my whole family, begged them to please, please, please report this to the police. This is a case of Domestic Violence this MUST be reported!\n\nAnd you know what they said? "Why take this matter outside? We can settle it here in our house by ourselves, don\'t worry, no need to report this to the police. The reputation of our house will be ruined. She\'s a woman she can tolerate this. You\'re not old enough to understand this now."\n\nTolerate my fuck. He literally killed her and you\'re not reporting? I asked the victim (my aunt) to report this, she was ready to, but my grandparents were against this. And my aunt can still go and report it, but she didn\'t because she is scared that she will lose her daughter, that she will destroy her child\'s future that she won\'t be able to be with her all because my uncle knows some politicians and also ties with lawyers. So if they had a case, he would win, and also the custody of the child would be given to him.\n\nBut I think that if she reported to some higher authorities she can still win the case, I don\'t know why she is not reporting and is just scared. This is all happening because they cover this thing and try to hide them from society because if anyone found out, the reputation of the house is gone.\n\nFirst of all, there is no reputation to this house if it\'s all happening and then they hide it. My dad asked to forgive him this time, but this is not the first time she was abused this brutally. Several times before, and one time she just ran away to her parent\'s house, and idk what happened there. She did not tell about the abuse to her parents this time, not yet.\n\nShe does not need to tolerate this and can report it!! But NO! This just so messed up and I feel so angry to have witnessed all this and I have to keep quiet about it. She can tolerate it because she\'s a woman? How is this justice? Can you see how fucking wrong this is? I wish I was dead.\n\nWhat wrong did I do to be born in such a country with all these shitty people and their fucked up thinking? I don\'t know what to do anymore. I wish this did not happen in front of me, I just don\'t wanna know, I can\'t do anything and they want me to keep silent about this. I can\'t. My head fucking hurts, I don\'t know what to do. This is wrong. So wrong. Fuckers.\n\nSo fellas yes, this is the kind of country India is. And I don\'t live in a remote place, I live in town, which developed enough. This is the dark reality behind the normal middle-class household. We haven\'t achieved any equality rights.

      <li>Title::: 'We have 2 options – one, rant &amp; rail against the ‘system’ and lament how it has let us down; second, do whatever we can to avoid getting infected &amp; if infected, minimize adverse consequences to ourselves &amp; others. If you belong to the first, you can stop reading now'<br />Body: "How can we avoid getting infected? There’s no magic bullet, I’m afraid. This is primarily a “stick to the basics” approach. More difficult than it sounds. \n\nFirst, maintain all precautions that we know help. These include masks (whenever you are not at home and not alone), physical distancing to the extent possible, and washing hands frequently. The 3 Ws – Wear a mask, Watch your distance, Wash your hands. \n\nMasks work, and are probably the most important precaution given our current understanding that aerosols are the predominant mechanism of spread. The best is a well-fitting N95 mask, which is now widely available &amp; not too expensive – you could re-use them too. \n\nHow can you optimally use an N95? Get 5 masks, and rotate their use – this is safe, burns less of a hole in your pocket, and is environment-friendly. The next best option is to use two masks – wear a surgical mask first, and a cloth mask over it for a snugger fit. \n\nHow physically distant need you be? The simple answer is “the more the better”. 6 feet preferable, but a minimum of 3 feet. Better still, avoid crowds as much as you can. Meet others only if absolutely necessary – most meetings can be done virtually. \n\nBeing outdoors is better than indoors, but while open gardens and parks are low-risk (where permitted by law), avoid large gatherings – whether they be weddings, parties, and yes, election rallies and religious (all religions) gatherings too. \n\nSecond, get your vaccine as early as you can. In India now, anyone over the age of 45 is eligible for the vaccine. Getting a vaccine gives you 70-80% chance of avoiding getting infected and 95% chance of serious illness. That’s as good as it can get. \n\nThere’s been a lot of noise about which vaccine to take. Anyone who strongly recommends one over the other is talking nonsense. There are no studies so far(&amp; unlikely in the immediate future) to directly compare two vaccines to show which is better. So, take the first one you get \n\nWhat about side effects of vaccines? We’ve heard of blood clots etc. Yes, they do occur, but they are extremely rare events, and the benefits of taking a vaccine far outweigh the risks. \n\nWhat happens if you do get COVID\\_19 Yes, you still can get it even in spite of taking all precautions, and yes, even after you’ve taken the vaccine. Remember, none of this is 100% effective – but 70 to 95% effective is a whole lot better than 0% \n\nMake preparations even before you get infected. Buy a thermometer and a pulse oximeter to keep at home.  These are two important instruments you need in case you get infected. \n\nFirst, don’t panic on getting a COVID\\_19 positive report – 98% get through without major issues. Isolate yourself from others. You can do this at home if possible. \n\nChart your temperature using the thermometer, &amp; your oxygen saturation with the pulse oximeter. Check both 2-3 times/day, the latter before &amp; after a brisk 6-min walk. Make sure you drink enough fluids and keep yourself hydrated. Stay positive – you’ll get through this. \n\nWhen should you be concerned and seek medical help? If your baseline saturation falls under 94% or if your fall in saturation before and after the 6-minute walk is 4% or more. Contact a hospital, and start proning yourself (lie chest down, back up) \n\nWhat medicines should you take? If your oxygen saturation is fine &amp; you have no symptoms other than fever, all you need is Paracetamol \n\nThere is some data that inhaled Budesonide helps you recover faster, but no hard endpoints like reduced mortality There is no evidence to suggest that anything helps – including Favipiravir/ Ivermectin. Don’t waste your time desperately trying to procure them \n\nWhat medicines help for COVID\\_19? Unfortunately, very few. What definitely works is proning and oxygen (when saturation is low), and steroids (Dexamethasone) for moderate to severe disease. \n\nBut what about Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and Convalescent Plasma? \n\nRemdesivir: doesn’t help much, and certainly not in all patients; there is probably a small subgroup in which it helps – those requiring oxygen, but not sick enough that they require ventilation. And even here, it doesn’t reduce mortality, probably helps earlier recovery \n\nTocilizumab also helps only in very specific subgroups – those sicker than described above, requiring rapidly increasing levels of oxygen or rapidly deteriorating respiratory parameters \n\nMy plea here is to please allow your physician to decide when Remdesivir/ Tocilizumab is required – there are very limited situations when they are beneficial &amp; please don’t pressurize them to prescribe it – much of the shortage today is because of unnecessary prescriptions \n\nThere is even less evidence to support the use of Convalescent Plasma for COVID\\_19. almost all studies done so far have shown that it is of no benefit.

      <li>Title::: 'The Indian Sepoy, his experiences, recruitment and role in the Rebellion of 1857. With a special attention to the Bengal Army'<br />Body: '(Taken from my answer in r/ AskHistorians) \n\n\nBACKGROUND \n\n\nThe Armies of the English East India Company were the precursor to the British Indian Army, which was itself the precursor to the Army of Independent India. The armies of the EEIC were divided into three Presidential Armies, these were the Bengal, Madras and Bombay Presidencies. These Presidencies themselves were the result of the establishment and expansion of "factories" (which were fortified settlements within which English traders stored their goods and used them as a selling station) by the EEIC between 1612 to 1757. These were established by acquisition of *firmans* which means edicts or grants from local rulers such as the Mughal Emperors, Mughal Governors or Marathas. By the middle of the 18th century, three factory towns, namely Madras, Bombay and Calcutta came into prominence as they grew in size and strength.\n\nEventually, the EEIC, began acquiring land and power in and around these fortified settlements, via a policy of supporting competing Indian princes in their wars for acquiring power. This was the experience of the Carnatic wars. The EEIC adopted a policy of helping native Nawabs and princes acquire power and promised to keep them secure while in return the Nawabs and princes gave them trade concessions. The EEIC also waged war against other companies and by 1757, had managed to kick out most of their competition. However, the watershed moment for the EEIC would come after their victory at the Battle of Plassey which assured them territorial rights in the Bengal province of the Mughal Empire. The conflict was the result of an Imperial Mughal *firman* being granted to the EEIC by then Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar, in 1717 giving the British East India Company the right to reside and trade in the Mughal Empire.  They were allowed to trade freely, except for a yearly payment of 3,000 rupees. The company was given the right to issue dastak (passes) for the movement of goods, which was misused by company officials for personal gain. The transgressions of the company brought them into conflict with the Nawabs of Bengal, and the defeat of the Nawab at Plassey allowed the British to place their own candidate on the Throne, to acquire all the land within the Maratha Ditch and 600 yards (550 m) beyond it and the zamindari of all the land between Calcutta and the sea.\n\n\nRECRUITMENT \n\n\nNow, we return to the Indian sepoy. The British had begun employing Indian sepoys to protect their "factories" as early as 1612 itself when the very first factories were established. However, initially these men served as watchmen and guards, with the passage of time, their function and proportion as part of the armed forces of the Presidencies grew significantly. By 1824, the size of the combined armies of Bengal, Madras, and Bombay was about 200,000 and had at least 170 sepoy and 16 European regiments. In 1844, the combined average strength of the three armies was 235,446 native and 14,584 European. For purposes of simplification, we shall take the example of the Bengal Presidency. The English shared the opinion that was common in India since the Ancient period, that there were certain "races" best suited for the purpose of war. These races had a "mercenary spirit, were of good stature and complexion, were drawn from the yeoman or land owning peasantry and were suitable for the style of warfare practiced in the Early Modern period". This led to these races being labelled as "martial races". Not surprisingly, these were the same "races" that had since the ancient and medieval period held the privilege to rule or to hold beaurocratic or military positions. Such as Brahmins, Rajputs, Muslims (Afghans, Iranians, Turks,), Khatris eventually Sikhs. \n\nHence, the sepoys of the Bengal Presidency, were in fact not recruited from the Provinces of Bengal or Bihar or Odissa. The British felt that the Bengalis were best suited for clerical work and that the South Indians were smaller in stature and lacked the physical robustness they wanted in their soldiers. Therefore, the entirety of the soldiers of the Bengal Presidency were drawn from the Kingdom of Oudh, which was an ally of the British ever since their Nawab was defeated by the Company at the Battle of Buxar and signed the Allahabad Treaty.\n\nThe soldiers that were recruited were mostly drawn from the Brahmin and Rajput castes of Oudh commonly known as Purbiyas. The term Purbiya originated in medieval India. It was used as a term to refer to mercenaries belonging to the Brahmin or Rajput caste from Oudh and Western Bihar. Throughout the medieval and early modern period, these were the preferred mercenaries highered, by mansabdars, Wazirs, Rajas and Mughal Emperors.\n\nThe process of recruitment was quite informal. For example, men who sought mercenary work were easy to find, usually the infantry of the native armies received little attention and soldiers could be convinced by promise of better prospects to join the army. In addition to this, the old feudal networks of recruitment were utilised as well, meaning "zamindars" (hereditary rulers of enormous tracts of land and the peasants who enjoyed land rights within their jurisdiction, from whom they reserved the right to collect tax on behalf of imperial courts or for military purposes) as well as serving officers and soldiers were required to encourage enlistment in the army among their estates, their family and close friends. To give you a perspective, by the early 19th century, this informal system of recruitment had become so well entrenched that the Brahmins of Oudh dominated the Bengal Presidential Army and represented 40% of it\'s total strength.\n\n\nMOTIVATIONS\n\n\nAs far as their motivations are concerned, the common peasant of this period usually did not posses a sense of nationalism or nationhood. War was ever present and Nawabs/Rajas and dynasties were overthrown quite often. Usually men enlisted in the army either because they were Brahmins and Rajputs and belonged to a long line of soldiers and military adventures, hence tradition. Or because they were land owning Brahmins or Rajputs who required additional income and were looking for livelihood.\n\n\nEXPERIENCE BEFORE 1857 \n\n\nNow to discuss the experience that these soldiers went through. It should be no surprise, that despite being as able and as formidable as their European counterparts, the native soldier was paid less than his European counterpart, had very limited chances for promotion beyond the post of "subedar" or sergeant. Was required to take care of the manual duties of his European counterparts, such as carrying supplies, setting up tents etc. The campaigns were hard and the wars were constant. The Anglo Mysore wars of which there were 4, the Anglo-Maratha Wars of which there were 3, The first and Second Anglo-Sikh wars, the Anglo-Afghan wars and so on. The equipment of the native soldier was often comprised on. In any conflict, the death toll of the native soldier was always higher. Yet, there were a few bright spots for the soldier\'s life. Military service brought social recognition, the word of a subedar in the army, meant that his relative, for example his nephew who found himself facing a sentence at the local court could be spared on the promise that he would join the army. A steady flow of income was at least guaranteed and there was, until the early 19th century a feeling of camaraderie among the European officers and their native sepoys, since these officers felt that the well being of the sepoys was their responsibility.\n\nBut this wouldn\'t always be true and eventually, the older officer corps was replaced with a new batch of officers who saw India as the land of opportunity and plunder and cared less for their unit and native sepoys and more for acquisition of wealth to take back to England.\n\nNow, the Rebellion of 1857, did change a lot for these soldiers. Let\'s look at why the rebellion happened, who rebelled and what consequences they suffered as a result.\n\n\nMOTIVATIONS FOR THE REBELLION \n\n\nThe Rebellion of 1857, was started due to and was the result of in large part the discontent of the native sepoys of the Bengal Presidential Army. These aforementioned injustices that the sepoys went through only further strained the relationship they had with their employers, especially after the company usurped Oudh from its Nawab on false ground of maladministration and imposed heavy tax farming revenues obligations on its zamindari/taluqadari class. This imposition of a heavy tax burden meant that the rural peasantry of Oudh, the very peasantry which supplied the Bengal Army with it\'s native sepoys had become more and more hostile towards it. The discontent of the farmers and families of the sepoys would naturally find its way into the general perception and feeling the sepoys had towards the Company. Hence, due to its polices the Company had turned the sepoys of Oudh, it\'s peasantry and its lower nobility against itself. Meanwhile, thanks to the Company\'s policy of aggressive expansion, the Company had made enemies of many prominent noble houses in North India, including, The Nawabs of Awadh, the Kingdom of Jhansi, the successor of the Peshwa of the Maratha Empire at Kanpur and many smaller noble houses as well.\n\nThe discontent of the Oudh sepoys were manifold. Apart from the aforementioned concerns the sepoys also felt cheated when they were denied the "bhatta" or bonus for foreign service. Since, after the annexation of Punjab, Awadh and most of North India these regions weren\'t considered "foreign". The Oudh sepoys of the Bengal Presidency were also incredibly strict regarding their caste and religious practices. Crossing the Indus was considered to result in a loss of caste. Consumption of pig and cow meat was forbidden for the Muslim and Brahmin and Rajput members of the Bengal army. The Brahmins were roughly 40%, the Rajputs were around 20% as well as Ahirs and Muslims. This meant that the Bengal Army was also a lot less diverse compared to the armies of Bombay or Madras. The fact that the British organised their armies into homogenous single battalion regiments drawn from one caste, also added to the large support base that the resentments found among the Bengal Army and the ease with which sepoys could organise and prepare themselves for action. \n\nTherefore, there existed a powder keg, of resentment against the Company which the Company lit itself by introducing the "match" which was the Pattern 1853, Enfield, rifled musket. To load the new rifle, soldiers had to bite a cartridge open and pour the gunpowder it contained into the rifle\'s muzzle, then stuff the paper cartridge (overlaid with a thin mixture of beeswax and mutton tallow for waterproofing) into the musket as wadding, the ball being secured to the top of the cartridge and guided into place for ramming down the muzzle.\n\nMany sepoys believed that the cartridges that were standard issue with the new rifle were greased with lard (pork fat) which was regarded as unclean by Muslims and tallow (cow fat) which angered the Hindus. The sepoys\' British officers dismissed these claims as rumors, and suggested that the sepoys make a batch of fresh cartridges, and greased these with pig and cow fat. This reinforced the belief that the original issue cartridges were indeed greased with lard and tallow.\n\nOn the 29th of March, 1857, a Brahmin sepoy named Mangal Pandey, attacked his British officers and his capture and subsequent hanging marked the beginning of the revolt.\n\n\nAFTERMATH OF THE REBELLION AND CONSEQUENCES FOR THE SEPOY \n\n\nOnce the revolt was suppressed, those noble houses that had participated in it with the sepoys were either extinguished or fled into exile. The sepoys themselves were either killed in action or sentenced to be shot by a cannon. Among the groups that were recruited into the Bengal Army, the Brahmins of Oudh payed the heaviest price for this revolt, as the perception among the British was that the Brahmins being the highest in the social ladder had invoked religious fervour among the Rajputs and were the primary cause for strict caste and religious practices prevalent in the Bengal Army. Hence, in subsequent years, once the British Crown assumed full ownership and control of the Company\'s property and armies, the recruitment policy of the army was changed. The percentage of Brahmins fell from 40% to around 8-12% until the World Wars.\n\nOverall, the perception of the Oudh sepoy, who was until the mutiny, considered an invincible conqueror of the Sikhs, the Marathas, Mysore, Nepal and Afghans changed and he was now seen as an inferior in military affairs when compared to the loyal Sikhs of the Punjab, and the Rajputs of the Rajputana or the Marathas and the Southerners who had remained loyal and had not joined the revolt.\n\n\nSources :\n\n"The Hybrid Military Establishment of the East India Company in South Asia: 1750–1849" by Kaushik Roy\n\n"Military Synthesis in South Asia: Armies, Warfare, and Indian Society, c. 1740--1849" by Kaushik Roy\n\n"The Martial Races of India" by Lt.

      <li>Title::: 'Research needs way way more mainstream recognition in India'<br />Body: "India is undoubtedly a major hub for vaccine production. However, we aren't developing them. Even most of the vaccines currently being tested by Indian pharma companies are mostly in association with Universities abroad. While, Covaxxin is based on outdated technology and the trial and results were not conducted swiftly or with a lot of tact. We need a horde of biostatisticians to do cutting edge clinical trial research. \n\nThe thing is the companies abroad are filled with biostatisticians who have studied in India (CMI, ISI, TIFR, IISC) but later move abroad because research environment in India is pathetic. The people working in research in India aren't stupid, hell no. It's the system and the society at fault. Obsession with engineering, law, , MBA, bureaucracy, etc has neglected what actually drives a country forward. Cutting edge scientific research. In India there are only a few institutes doing that. \n\nThe BJP government keeps cutting funding for the best research institutions that we have (don't tell me they don't, I've studied in one of them). I'm frankly fed up of how we have failed as a society in this pandemic. Without creating an environment that promotes research we will never progress as a nation. \n\nAnyway, my message to you is that you realise how important scientific research is for progressing and advancing society. But most people are more concerned about which religion is being treated unfairly by the politicians. Sigh.\n\nI'm just pissed pfizer can act all bossy witht their mRNA vaccine when it could've easily been developed in India if only we actually retain people who want to work in research here. Let me tell you there are a lot of people involved in vaccine research who are Indians and studied here at least until their masters and very rarely, PhD.\n\nAfter this second wave brought on because of by the  follies of Indians themselves, I conclude that this country has finally failed.

      <li>Title::: '[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Russia faces diplomatic heat, Myanmar dictator may attend ASEAN summit, and a history of language politics'<br />Body: 'Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Geopolitics Thread, where we discuss events from around the world. Discussion does not have to be related to India. Please share interesting stories, insights, and questions in the comments. Here are some stories to get the conversation rolling:\n\n# Top Stories\n\n1. [Israel lifts outdoor mask mandate](https://news.yahoo.com/fully-vaccinating-majority-population-israel-100620301.html)\n\nIsrael, which has achieved one of the world\'s highest and fastest vaccination rates against SARS-CoV-2, moved a step further to normalcy by dropping the requirement for people to wear masks when outdoors, although indoor norms remain in place. This follows substantial opening up of even indoor activities in the country, with schools being fully open for the first time in a year. The country has fully vaccinated about 81% of the eligible population (16+ years) with mRNA-based vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.\n\n2. [Russia faces diplomatic heat in US, Europe](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/czech-republic-expels-18-russian-envoys-accuses-moscow-over-ammunition-n1264420)\n\nIt was a difficult week diplomatically for Russia as it faced headwinds in both Europe and the US. President Joe Biden slapped sanctions on Russian leaders in retaliation against the massive hacking of private companies (including Microsoft, large parts of whose Office product is feared stolen), known as the SolarWinds hack and expelled several Russian diplomats. Separately, the Czech Republic expelled Russian diplomats after it concluded that Russia was involved in a 2014 explosion in an ammunitions depot, the biggest dispute between the countries since the fall of the USSR. Finally, Ukraine is leading a diplomatic push against Russia for amassing huge military forces on its border.\n\n3. [Radical Islamists take police hostage in Pak](https://news.yahoo.com/deadly-clashes-islamists-police-hostage-123424931.html)\n\nIn continuing escalation of violence in Pakistan, radical Islamist organization Tehrik-i-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) kidnapped six police officers (including two from the paramilitary) in their office in Lahore. The group has been protesting the publication of cartoons of Prophet Muhammad in France by demanding, among other things, breaking of diplomatic ties with France and a nuclear attack on the country. After violence broke out, the government banned the organization and arrested its leader, although that hasn\'t had much effect with the group shooting bullets and petrol bombs in urban warfare, and somehow sharing it on social media despite an Internet ban in the area. France has advised its citizens to leave the country.\n\n4. [Talks begin in Geneva to revive Iran nuclear accord](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2021-04-19/iran-always-welcomes-dialogue-with-riyadh-foreign-ministry-says)\n\nParties to the Iran nuclear deal began deliberations in Geneva to revive the deal and stop continued nuclear enrichment activities by Iran, four year after former US President unliterally rescinded the deal and applied harsh sanctions that have shrunk the Iranian economy by a third. Separately, reports are emerging of a secret talk between Iran and its arch rival Saudi Arabia in a bid to ease tensions, potentially because the Biden administration is expected to be less one-sided in dealing with the region. Finally, a massive explosion was reported in Iran\'s Natanz nuclear enrichment facility, which the country has blamed on Israel. The explosion is expected to have set back the enrichment programme by at least a year.\n\n5. [ASEAN considers sending aid mission to Myanmar](https://news.yahoo.com/exclusive-southeast-asian-nations-weigh-112151367.html)\n\n Amidst continuing violence on the streets in major cities in Myanmar against the Feb 1 military coup, ASEAN diplomats are considering sending an aid mission and holding diplomatic talks to ease the tense situation. They are also expected to discuss this in a planned summit in Jakarta later this month, where Myanmar\'s military dictator is expected to attend. Separately, ousted civilian leaders in the country have formed a breakaway unity government and are demanding international recognition, although that is unlikely from ASEAN itself, which has more dictatorships than democracies. Some individual countries have called for freeing jailed former State Councilor Aung San Suu Kyi, but the group as a whole has refrained from doing so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: A Language for a Nation\n\nLast week, the Chief Justice of India talked about Ambedkar\'s vision of Sanskrit being a common language for all Indians, as opposed to many members of the Constituent Assembly that wanted Hindi to have that role. Of course, we know that ultimately, India does not have a common language, with Hindi serving only a limited role outside of its natural boundaries. But India is not the only post-colonial country to have faced this problem. In the Westphalian conception of a nation-state, there must be a unifying language, and in many new countries created after World War II, often with borders created artificially by colonial powers, that same urge existed. \n\nOne example of a country with massive linguistic diversity is Indonesia - over 700 documented languages in an island country consisting of thousands of islands. Even within these, there are two broad language families (Austronesia and Papuan) in the eastern and western parts of the country. After the end of Dutch rule, the country aimed to rally around a common language - but like in India, nobody agreed to a common one. One language - Malay - was not indigenous to the islands of Indonesia but long served as a lingua franca for commerce with neighbouring Malaysia. So the newly-independent country, in 1949, "created" a new, standardized form of Malay, with many new grammatical rules set up and words borrowed from a variety of languages, including Sanskrit and Arabic. The new language was also to have a script based on the Roman alphabet to distinguish it from the Brahmi-derived scripts used in virtually every part of the country. Thus was born Bahasa Indonesia, with Bahasa coming from the Sanskrit *Bhasha*, literally meaning "language". Under the dictatorship of Suharto, the language was made mandatory in all schools and government business. More recently, the government has made it mandatory for expats to learn it. And yet, very few people actually use the language in their dealings unless it\'s to do with education and government. Indeed, the rigid language itself is being transformed by mixing with local languages as well as, through the Internet, English. \n\nAnother example of a unifying language is Hebrew. Around 100 AD, Jews were concentrated in the Roman province of Judea around modern-day Israel, but they rebelled against Roman rule. As a result, the Romans conducted a genocide, killing every human, cat, and dog in Judea that could not escape (such was Roman "civilization"). Jews were thus scattered around the world into disparate communities - a large group moved to central Europe, others moved to India, and still others to provinces of Persia such as Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). And while they assimilated significantly with the local population, including by learning the local language, Jewish religious traditions remained in Hebrew, unlike Christian traditions that moved away from Latin. Given the extreme difficulty of converting to Judaism as well as ghettoization of Jews in Europe, they developed their own languages that mixed elements of Hebrew with the local language - Yiddish was perhaps the largest of these. By the early twentieth century, almost nobody spoke Hebrew for anything but religious ceremonies, but Zionists that dreamed of a homeland for the Jews in Palestine pitched Hebrew as its common language. While sizeable, Zionists remained on the fringes, with most Jews laughing at the idea of moving to the desert from their homes - until the Nazi\'s holocaust highlighted the real need for a homeland. The establishment of the state of Israel brought with it a right of all Jews to return to their biblical homeland, no matter where they were. Thus, speakers of Yiddish, French, Marathi, Russian, Malayalam, and Amharic (in Ethiopia) converged on the *new country* but everyone agreed to use Hebrew as the common language of an *old civilization*. Today, Hebrew is the most widely spoken language in Israel and is used for day to day activities in addition to religious ones.\n\nThe last example, which is the opposite of these two, is from South Africa. Africa is perhaps the most genetically and linguistically diverse continent on the planet, the place where our species first emerged and colonized the planet (and parts of the solar system too). However, the European scramble for Africa tore across those boundaries - disparate tribes with different languages and customs were meshed together into one colony and forced to use the colonizer\'s language. In the southern tip of the continent, Dutch settlers established plantations and intermixed with the local African population, creating a new language, Afrikaans (literally, "African"). But the British were soon to arrive and waged the Boer Wars (which included the first modern use of genocide through concentration camps). Taking control of the area, they used English for administration, privileging those people that could learn the language. When South Africa\'s white minority government declared Independence from Britain, it gave the "white languages" of English and Afrikaans legal status, to the exclusion of all native African languages. When Nelson Mandela became President, the country was determined to turn the clock back on apartheid. South Africa today has 11 official languages, including English and Afrikaans, but also 9 African languages, including the most widely spoken Zulu and Xhosa. Furthermore, every branch of government right down to the municipal level is constitutionally required to respect the language of its residents, meaning that super-minority languages such as Gujarati and Hindi (spoken by Indians who settled there) also enjoy constitutional protection equivalent to the 11 official languages. Every province is also required to have at least two official languages for running government affairs. The very concept of a single language for everyone is considered alien, although English (heavily mixed with local languages) is a lingua franca.\n\nThus, we see that countries have gone in different directions when it comes to languages - embracing all such as South Africa and India, looking back to civilization for one as in the case of Israel, and creating an artificial one as in Indonesia. In our subcontinent itself, we see various approaches - Pakistan and Sri Lanka suffered civil war when they tried to impose a single language, while Bhutan, Bangladesh, and the Maldives have a widely-used national language. In India itself, we tried to impose a single language but backed off when it generated a separatist movement (the DMK). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat stories caught your attention?

      <li>Title::: 'Building Redundancies into system - A lesson learnt'<br />Body: 'Hello,\n\nLike you all, I am also disheartened at the damage covid is currently bringing to our society. As a skill-less idiot, I feel more ashamed of the fact, that apart from minor philanthrophy there is hardly I have done for the people. With that perspective I am writing this. I think this applies to many of us, so read, ponder and perhaps execute accordingly.  \n\n##Redundancies in a system\n\nThe layman introduction to the word redundant or redundancy carries a negative connotation, it is a marker, a filter to remove something useless. Meanwhile, on observation, of nature, societies and even physical systems, we understand that redundancies are in fact required, not just required they are absolutely mandatory. When a system hits an uncertainity, the optimizations go out of whack, and we run into shortages. Such shortages are handled via slack, a purposeful redundancy. \n\n&gt;“Redundancy is ambiguous because it seems like a waste if nothing unusual happens. Except that something unusual happens—usually.” - Taleb\n\n###Well, what are such examples of redundancies ? \n\nAnt colonies have slackers sitting in the colonies, doing nothing most of the time. But for ant colonies, unexpected rains, total disruption by a predator or random human clearing his backyard can cause heavoc. So, how to rebuild, prevent or handle massive uncertainities ? These slackers suddenly become food scouts, some become transporters, food gatherers and so on. They don any hat they want to. \n\nOur body has such mechanisms too, we know of stem cells that morph into other cells whenever they are called upon. A corporate manager might scream that stem cell is a total waste of time, money and energy. But the very fact that Stem cell can don so many hats at the time of urgent requirement, makes our body run smoothly. \n\nCut to World War II, we get to know that Ludwing Wittgenstein, the analytical philosopher, perhaps the best of them, participated in war, in the middle of his "career". Alexander Solzenitchin served in war as a military maths guy. When we read of war, we realize that uncertainity pushed the earlier man to don many hats. Young people could be turned into medics, into soldiers, into airplane pilots, cyptographers, morse code interpreters within months and even weeks. \n\nOf course, I am not glorifying war or epidemics. What I am pointing to, is that specialization has a cost, and more so, optimization has unimaginable cost. Not only we have very few redundancies, wherever we have, those are of the useless kind, such that cannot be prepared for anything. \n\n&gt; We are a combination of inefficiency (sub optimal) with no or useless redundancy.  \n\nIf my city has to prepare for itself 100 beds from scratch in 10 days it can. But can it prepare 100 oxymeters, 100 Oxygen cylinders. \nA new paramedic for every 10 houses, yes. But a new micro plant for making a simple drug ?. \n\nI am not saying we dont have redundancies anywhere. We have Armies have reserve divisions, there is paramilitary, NCC cadets etc. The idea is to have more of it. More people with more skills. Skill not merely for employment, but for standing up to challenge whenever and wherever it comes. \n\nYes, there would be an argument coming forth that employment skills are already a challenge, now you want more skills. Frankly, employment is function of economy, businesses, policy and consumption, skills are but one part of it. Having more skills only improve the ecosystem. But this is merely a segway to avoid detractors. \n\n&gt;My main assertion is to have multiple redundant skills, that can be ramped up, levelled up whenever required, rather than having 1lac coders who know nothing other than Java, JS, Python, better to have same 1lac coders that can morph into paramedics, machining expert, carpentry and so on. \n\nIts not like we have less carpenters, we have plenty of them, but well-off, knowledge workers having more hands on skills have multiplicative effects on quality and appreciation of these trades. Also, it enables us to think more proactively on not so frequently attended problems of engineering like drainage systems, energy saving in houses and so on. \n\nThe degree of helplessness we feel while uncertainity plays itself out can well be utilized to catapult ourselves into potentially more than what we are now. Yes, we need to be better at what we do, but much more interesting is to be more of what we can do in times of requirement. \n\nEvery society needs their stem cells.\n\n\\m/'<br />Author: 'Kootanuvadak007'  id: 'mtyyuq'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mtyyuq/building_redundancies_into_system_a_lesson_learnt/</li>

      <li>Title::: "JEE: a synopsis, we're screwed."<br />Body: " So everyone already knows that the April shift of JEE has been postponed. Whenever the exam happens next, we're fucked. And not for the reasons you may think.\n\nThe amount of time that we have to stay at home, unable to study and with fucked mental states, slacking with studies not able to do anything, variability of paper difficulties in different shifts... I give you all that, they are issues. Ranging from minor to major. But let's address the elephant in the room: Normalization.\n\nWhen I say Normalization, I don't mean between shifts. While that has been problematic with papers changing marks vs percentile wildly. For example, normally one would require around 180-190 marks to be at the 99th %ile, the 18th March morning paper required 245, this would normally put a student at 99.8+ %ile at the minimum\\[1\\]. Among shifts though, it's a problematic system. Where it turns a broken one is normalization between sessions.\n\nThe reason I say this is simple. The number of students giving JEE between sessions is not the same, and that hurts the student. For example, for 2020, 8.69 lakh people gave the paper in the January\\[2\\], whereas only 6.35 did in September\\[3\\]. So a kid who in January would have a worse rank while a better rank in September among sessions, is screwed because when look at it from percentile measure, has done worse. And his or her percentile went down because a lesser number of students gave the exam. Because the student is not only competing with the students from one session, but also from those with other sessions who may or may not have appeared for all sessions. This is not a big problem when the variation of students giving the exam is 10 to 20 thousand for a normal attendance of 6 Lakhs, or more. But as last time if the difference between two sessions reaches in lakhs like it did in 2020, you may have better marks and have performed better in terms of rank in your own paper, that one session even, but when it's normalized between multiple sessions? Most probably not the best thing to happen.\n\nFor 2021, the difference in students attempting the paper while a bit worrying is not that large\\[4\\]\\[5\\]. However, with the rising pandemic situation in the country this difference will only rise. The only people who suffer in this? The students.\n\n\\[1\\]: [https://youtu.be/VpJa62obgBo?t=104](https://youtu.be/VpJa62obgBo?t=104)\n\n\\[2\\]: [https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/jee-main-2020-result-here-s-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-result-and-topper/story-EwRSkI6Ph4vHCQUrBRivRJ.html](https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/jee-main-2020-result-here-s-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-result-and-topper/story-EwRSkI6Ph4vHCQUrBRivRJ.html)\n\n\\[3\\]: [https://www.livemint.com/education/news/jee-mains-2020-6-35-lakh-candidates-appeared-for-september-exam-11599729455055.html](https://www.livemint.com/education/news/jee-mains-2020-6-35-lakh-candidates-appeared-for-september-exam-11599729455055.html)\n\n\\[4\\]:[https://www.ndtv.com/education/66-lakh-students-registered-for-jee-main-95-appeared-in-paper-1-nta](https://www.ndtv.com/education/66-lakh-students-registered-for-jee-main-95-appeared-in-paper-1-nta)\n\n\\[5\\]:[https://www.embibe.com/exams/jee-main-march/](https://www.embibe.com/exams/jee-main-march/)"<br />Author: 'resdzek'  id: 'mtshv1'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mtshv1/jee_a_synopsis_were_screwed/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'A History of Mughal-Rajput Relations between the early 16th and mid 17th century'<br />Body: '( People can find this in one of my answers over at r/ AskHistorians as well ) \n\nTo understand the history of Mughal-Rajput relations we must understand the history of three dynasties who would come to dominate the Northern part of the Indian subcontinent between the 16th, 17th and early 18th centuries. To begin with we must take a look at the Mughals.\n\nAt the time when Babur first contemplated the idea of invading India he had already conquered Kabul. Zahir-ud-din Mohammed Babur, was the eldest of Umar Sheikh Mirza, who was governor of Ferghana, which is a region in eastern Uzbekistan. Babur was by lineage the great-great grandson of Timur. Babur\'s early military career was full of frustrations. Born in 1483, he had assumed the Throne of his father at age 12, in the year 1494. He conquered Samarkand two years later, only to lose Fergana soon after. In his attempts to reconquer Fergana, he lost control of Samarkand. In 1501, his attempt to recapture both the regions failed when Muhammad Shaybani Khan the founder of the Shaybanid dynasty, defeated him. He conquered Kabul, in 1504, after having being driven away from his patrimony and homeland. He formed an alliance with the Safavid Shah Ismail I, to take parts of Turkestan as well as Samarkand itself only to lose them again to the Shaybanids.\n\nHence, he had decided to give up on the dreams of taking back Ferghana and Samarkand and set his eyes on North India. At the time he had only thought of conquering the Punjab region. A task he accomplished in his second campaign in 1525, after a short campaign in 1519. Thus, at this juncture, we the political situation in North India was ripe for conflict and power changes. In Punjab, Babur prepared for a march towards Delhi to take it and all the realms under the rule of the Lodi Dynasty from Ibrahim Lodi who was currently the sultan of the Delhi Sultanate, whose own relatives, Daulat Khan Lodi and Alauddin had invited Babur to invade the Delhi Sultanate. Under the Lodi Dynasty the Sultanate had lost most of its eastern and southern as well as western territories and Ibrahim ruled over merely the Upper Gangetic plains. Meanwhile, a third contender for power and perhaps bigger threat to Babur\'s rise was looming in the Rajputana, in the form of the Rajput Confederacy, which was the first of its kind since the reign of Prithviraj Chauhan. This Confederacy was formed under the auspicious leadership of Rana Sangram Singh, of House Sisodiya of Mewar which had risen in prestige and power at the cost of neighbouring Malwa and Gujurati Sultanates during the reign of Rana Sangram other wise known as Rana Sanga.\n\nThe following events are well known, Babur defeated the Lodis at Panipat and then faced the Rajputs at Khanwa in 1527. However after his victories at Chanderi and at Ghaghra, he soon died leaving the Empire to his son Humayun whose reign was turbulent and prospects uncertain until his son Akbar assumed the Throne.\n\nNow let us look at the Sisodias of Mewar. This house of Rajputs traces it\'s origins from the legendary Suryavnshi lineage. But while records to back up such claims are obviously questionable, the historical foundation of this dynasty lies in the rise of Rana Hammir Singh, the founder of the Sisodiya Cadet Branch of the Guhila dynasty. The Guhila dynasty was extinguished by Alauddin Khalji after he besieged and conquered Chittor in 1303, their capital. But Rana Hammir Singh had taken back Chittor and since then reclaimed control of the region and re-established the dynasty under its cadet branch of the Sisodias by 1326. Owing to the legendary exploits of their kings and being one of the few Hindu noble houses that had remained independent during the successive reigns of various dynasties at the helm of the Delhi Sultanate, the House of Mewar carried weight amongst Rajput nobility.\n\nApart from Rana Hammir Singh, two rulers in particular, Rana Kumbharna Singh (1433-1468) and his great grandson Rana Sangram Singh (1508-1528), had raised the prestige of the House of Mewar to astronomical heights by not only defeating neighbouring Sultanates in Gujurat, Nagaur, Delhi and Malwa, but infact under the reign of Rana Sangram, actually conquering Gujurat and Malwa. Therefore, by 1526, most Rajput states had formed a Confederacy under the leadership of Rana Sanga. Ofcourse, following his defeat the Confederacy fell apart and while the house of Mewar still held a high place on the Rajput and indeed the Indian sociopolitical stage, there would never again be such a untied political front offered by the Rajputs. \n\nIn terms of the motivations and objectives of the Confederacy, it could be said that the Confederacy was buoyed together towards the political wills of the Rana of Mewar. Rana Sanga had made a policy to attack and acquire the territories of his kingdom\'s old enemies such as the Sultanates of Delhi, Gujurat, Nagaur and Malwa, and at the same time remove any traces of Turkic or Afghan dominion in North India. Therefore, it would be safe to say that had Babur not invaded Delhi and taken the Upper Ganga Valley, the Rana would have quite soon. Among the many noble houses that had joined the Rajput Confederacy was the next dynasty which will complete the puzzle to understanding the key players in North India and Mughal-Rajput history.\n\nThis was the Kachwahas of Amber. This dynasty claimed it\'s descent from the son Kush of the legendary King Rama of Ayodhya. Their ancestors allegedly migrated from Rama\'s kingdom of Kosala and established a new dynasty at Gwalior. After 31 generations, they moved to Rajputana and created a kingdom at Dhundhar. Dullah Rai, one of the ancestors of the Kachwaha rulers, defeated the Meenas of Manchi and Amber and later completed the conquest of Dhundhar by defeating the Bargurjars of Dausa and Deoti. However, in the early 16th century, they were conquered and vassalised by the Rathore ruler Maldeo of the kingdom of Marwar.\n\nIn 1527, the ruler of Amber who had joined the Rajput Confederacy was Prithviraj Singh I. Prithviraj had fought at Khanwa and like Rana Sanga, died soon afterwards, being succeeded by his son Puranmal. After Puranmal\'s succession, which was quite controversial, the Kachwaha domain became unstable over disputes regarding the succession of Puranmal to the Throne. This problem was only further exacerbated by neighbouring Rajput kingdoms that sought to capitalise on the situation. While accounts about Puranmal seeking the aid of Humayun are varying and quite contradictory we know for sure that after Puranmal, his brother Bhim Singh assumed the Throne. Bhim only reigned three and a half years before dying on 22 July 1537. He was succeeded in quick succession by two sons, Ratan Singh and Askaran, before the throne eventually passed to his younger brother Bharmal in 1548.\n\nIt is here that we arrive at a crucial juncture in Mughal-Rajput relations. In Mewar, the reigns were assumed by the 4th son of Rana Sanga, Maharana Udai Singh II, under whose reign the capital of Chittor was lost to Akbar in 1568 and the capital was shifted to Udaipur. Here his son, Maharana Pratap assumed the Throne after Udai died in 1572. Meanwhile, Akbar had overthrown his guardian Bairam Khan who had grown too ambitious and controlling and at the age of 18, the young Baadshaah of the Mughal Empire removed Bairam from service and continued his expeditions by directly controlling all affairs from 1560 onwards. Meanwhile, in 1562, the situation became critical for the Kachwahas of Amber when Mirza Muhammad Sharaf-ud-din Hussain was appointed Mughal governor of Mewat. Mirza led a large army to Amber which Bharmal could not resist. Mirza forced the Kachwahas to leave Amber and live in forests and hills. Bharmal promised a fixed tribute to Mirza and handed over his own son, Jagannath, and his nephews, Raj Singh and Khangar Singh, as hostages for its due payment. When Sharaf-ud-din was preparing to invade Amber again, Bharmal met Akbar\'s courtier, Chaghtai Khan. Fortunately, for Bharmal, Akbar was at Karavali (a village near Agra) on his way from Agra to Ajmer (on a pilgrimage to the dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti). Bharmal himself met Akbar at his camp at Sanganer on 20 January 1562. Here, Bharmal proposed a marriage between Akbar and his eldest daughter Hira Kunwari. Therefore, when Akbar agreed, the Kachwahas were now relatives of Akbar, Bharmal was his father-in-law and was in par with the highest Muslim nobles of the Empire. Hence, Sharaf-ud-din Mirza, returned to Bharmal his lands and relatives and in the following years, the Kachwahas rendered unwavering service to the Mughals while they themselves enjoyed the highest salaries, status and prestige the Empire had to offer.\n\nHence, The House of Mewar, still held in the highest esteem by all Rajput nobility was in a period of decline and The House of Amber had united with the Mughals. Raja Bharmal was succeeded by his son Raja Bhagwant Das in 1574. He served as Akbar\'s General and was awarded a rank or mansab of 5000 along with the title of Amir-ul-Umra. He fought battles in Punjab, Kashmir where he decisively defeated the Kashmiri King Yousuf Shah Chak and Afghanistan as well and he held the governorship of Kabul. His daughter Manbhawati Bai was married off to the Mughal Prince and future Emperor Jehangir. He died in 1589 being succeeded by his son Raja Man Singh.\n\nRaja Man Singh, assumed the Throne of Amber in 1589, but he had served with distinction at the Battle of Haldighati 1576 against the Maharana of Mewar, Maharana Pratap in a legendary battle, and in other campaigns as well. The reason why Akbar wanted to conquer Rajputana and especially Mewar was because with Mewar and the Rajputs at his flanks, his empire would never be secure, a fact he had learned by learning about the experiences of the Delhi Sultanate and their fruitless tussle with the Sisodiya dynasty. Yet, in his lifetime, Akbar could not conquer Mewar. Even after being defeated at Haldighati, where his army of 3000-4000 Rajputs and allied Bhils (400 men approx.), was defeated by Man Singh who commanded the Imperial Mughal Army roughly 8000-10,000 in numbers, Pratap Singh endured and by the end of his reign, he scored a decisive victory against the Mughals at Dewair in 1582 and took back Western Mewar including Kumbhalgarh, Udaipur and Gogunda through guerilla warfare and even destroyed newly built mosques in these regions in retaliation. He died in 1597.\n\nAfter his death, his son Maharana Amar Singh I (r. 1597-1620) assumed the Throne and followed his father\'s policy of resisting Mughal overlordship. Amar Singh continued to resist the Mughals and it was clear that he could not be taken in a battle, so  Mewar was devastated financially and in manpower due to the policy of Shah Jahan (son of Jahangir, Jahangir had become Emperor in 1605 after Akbar\'s death) , to scorch the lands of Mewar and make it incapable of supporting the efforts of Amar Singh. Finally, in 1615, Amar Singh submitted to the Mughals. Mewar including Chittor was assigned to him as Watan Jagir or hereditary patrimony. He secured a favourable peace treaty and it was ensured that Mewar would never bend his knee to the Mughal Emperors or serve at his court personally nor would the House of Mewar enter into matrimonial relations with the Mughals.\n\nHence, we see a clear policy emerging from the Mughals towards the Rajputs since the reign of Akbar. The first, religious tolerance and engagement at a political level, treating them as warriors and nobles on par with the Iranis or Turks in the Imperial service. The second, realising that the prestige of Mewar and the potential of the Rajputs uniting once again was an ever present threat and therefore it was better to assuage them. Third, following a policy of providing high posts and port folios to Rajput nobles who allied or accepted Mughal suzerainty. Fourth, matrimonial relations were never the prerequisite for such alliances as many Rajputs had previously simply accepted Mughal suzerainty and had acquired high posts for themselves.\n\nFinally, the attitudes in Rajputana and in general accross North India were shaped by the actions and decisions of the Rajput houses of Mewar and Amber. While Mewar only grew in prestige as the last stronghold and symbol of strength and resistance for the more conservative elements in Hindu society, the House of Amber was universally recognised as a house which produced some of the finest administrators and generals the Empire would ever know. And yet, the more conservative elements in Hindu society saw the House of Amber as traitors, ofcourse such opinions were never discussed in front of the Amber Rajas. \n\nUntil the reign of Aurangzeb, the Rajputs were more or less, united under the Mughal cause. They fought and led expeditions as far west and Afghanistan and Qandahar and as east as Bengal and Odissa. In 1585, Man Singh I was sent to conquer Afghanistan and silence the rebels there. Man Singh decisively defeated five major tribes of the Afghans including Yusufzai and "Mandar" tribes. The flag of Amber was changed from "Katchanar" (green climber in white base) to "Pachranga" (five colored) to commemorate this victory. This flag continued in use until accession of Jaipur state in India. This permanently crushed the revolt and the area remained peaceful thereafter.\n\nIn 1586 CE, Akbar sent another army under Raja Bhagwant Das, father of Prince Man Singh I to win Kashmir. Kashmir was included in the Mughal Empire and made a Sarkar (district) of Kabul province.\n\nMan Singh I also conquered Bihar in similar fashion. Abul Fazl has described Man Singhs campaign in Bihar in the following words. "The Raja united ability with courage and genius with strenuous action".\n\nMan Singh after conquering Bihar was ordered to defeat the Afghan Sultan Qatlu Khan Lohani of Orissa, Man Singh set out for Orissa on April 1590. By 1592, Odissa was also conquered by him.\n\nHis grandson Jai Singh I (r. 1621 - 1667), was another great General of the Mughal Empire. He was the second Raja to receive the title Mirza Raja, the first being his grandfather Man Singh I who received it from Akbar. During his career he served first in the Deccan, subduing the Gonds and then in Central Asia, fighting at Kandahar in the Mughal-Safavid wars and at Balkh.\n\n\nJai Singh, who had begun his own military career in the Deccan, was then appointed to lead a 14,000 strong army against Shivaji. And in 1665, he forced Shivaji to sign the Treaty of Purandar being the only noble in the. Empire to subdue the Maratha King. Although the opportunity his victories provided were made meaningless thanks to Aurangzeb\'s inability to compromise on his orthodox beliefs and accept Shivaji into his court with proper honours.\n\nIn conclusion, until the reign of Aurangzeb, whose interference into the succession matters of Rajput states, a matter which was left to the Rajputs by Akbar himself, the Rajputs, especially the house of Amber, continued to serve the Empire with loyalty and distinction. Both to serve the interests of the Empire and the interests of their own houses and kingdoms as well. \n\n\nSources :\n\n\n"A History of Jaipur" by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n"Shivaji and His Times" By Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n" Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals (1206–1526) Part 2" by Satish Chandra\n\n\n"Akbarnama" by Abu\'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, Henry Beveridge (Trans.) \n\n\n"A Military History of India" by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n"History and Culture of the Indian People Volume VII : The Mughal Empire" by R.C Majumdar'<br />Author: 'MaharajadhirajaSawai'  id: 'mtf7ie'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mtf7ie/a_history_of_mughalrajput_relations_between_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How corrupt can Bangalore cops get?'<br />Body: 'TL:DR: This is my story of how I was arm-twisted into coughing up an unnecessary bribe for getting my passport.\n\nI had applied for a renewal of my passport few months back. Like everyone nowadays, I had applied for it online and got an appointment at the Lalbagh PSK the very next day. The website was really good with all the information you want easily accessible and user interface; navigation of the website was surprisingly very intuitive. All information you needed were at the places you expect it to be and you get around the website easily by searching in it for some time by yourself. The whole document uploading and verification process at the PSK was also super smooth and it got over in 2h. From the time you enter till you get out, I was guided pretty well by the staff and there were display screens everywhere letting you know of your positon in the queue and the next counter you needed to go to. (I learnt later that this was because this entire process has been taken over by TCS and they\'ve streamlined the process to expedite it and remove the unnecessary delay. So YAY! for privatization).\n\nThe very next day after my appointment at the PSK, I got a message from the PSK that my file has been forwarded to my local police station for verification (Banaswadi PS in my case). I was surprised that all of this was happening within 2 days of me filling and submitting the form and was overjoyed. So far so good and I was waiting for the police to come to my home for verification.\n\nNow comes the circus of dealing with the police.\n\nBy 11 am I get an SMS from a number asking to call him since my passport verification file has been sent to him. When I called that number, the SI who answered it, Mr. Suresh, told me that I\'ll have to come by to the police station by 4 PM in the evening with my Aadhar Card, Voter ID, Old passport and photo copies of all my documents along with one passport size photo. I was surprised since it\'s usually the police who come to our residence for verification and we don\'t go to the Police station. I thought "Screw it! Maybe he\'s afraid with the whole pandemic thing and let me go to the police station and get it over with". I go to the police station on time, with all the documents he had requested (plus all the documents I had submitted as proof to the PSK). I was made to stand and wait for an hour near the reception at the entrance and the lady constable kept there telling me that Mr. Suresh is out on police work and would return shortly. An hour went by and I was frustrated since I had some important work to attend to as well and I when tried calling the SI’s number he had conveniently switched his phone off. Along with me, there 7-8 others who he had also called to police station for passport verification and were standing and waiting there. I was irritated at this point and kept bugging the receptionist and other cops at the station every 5 mins.\n\nFinally, after 90 mins of waiting, this policeman comes to meet us. He came down from the first floor, where apparently he was having tea and chit-chatting with his buddies, while we were standing and waiting for him the ground floor. After few more minutes of relaxing at his desk, he calls over for the first person, who happens to be me. I hand over to him all the documents I brought with him. He sees that my Aadhar card and Voter ID does not have the local address and says that he can\'t approve my application since there is no proof for my residence. I told him that I\'ve submitted my rental agreement, telephone bill and internet bill, all of which are among the acceptable documents for my passport address verification (although I require just ONE of them). He responds that, as per rules, he has to come to my residence as mentioned in the passport application and documents and verify if I live there and then confirm it with a few of my neighbours as well. I told him that, it\'s fine, I\'ve asked for special permission from my office to WFH for the next 1 week to 10 days until this is complete, so he can drop in anytime to visit me and I am also pretty social and on good terms with my neighbours, all of whom know me well too. To this, he responds that, " I can only come by your house when time permits and I am busy for a few days. When I come to your house and you\'re not there, then I might\'ve to send your application back without completing the police verification".\n\nAt this point, I realized he just wants me to grease his palms and asked him what he wanted, he responded back with asking me where I work. “IT", I answered. Then says "1000". We then bargained and at settled at 500. I didn\'t have the cash with me then and he refused to accept UPI payment, So I went to an ATM withdrew the cash, came back and paid him. I was speaking to everyone who was there and almost all of them had to pay this “toll”. A north Indian who had applied for passports for his wife had two kids was squeezed into paying 700 per head for a total of 2100. Another local, who was a Tamil but spoke Kannada really well, got way with paying 300.\n\nAre most of the police stations in Bangalore like this? Do they blackmail applicants into paying up unnecessarily? If they close 4000-5000 in day via just passport application, how much do they earn in a month from this and other stuff?\n\nThis was not the experience I had when I had applied for my passport in my hometown. The police came to my home for verification and when my father tried to give 200 rs " for his effort and to refresh himself for coming in hot weather" the policeman strictly declined it and said he was just doing his duty. Is it possible to complain against these corrupt officials and redressal from the system?\n\nNote: I thought I\'d explain my rationale behind paying the bribe as well. When we settled on the price of 500, I thought "What would be the consequences if I don\'t cough up"? The verification won\'t be done and my application will be rejected. I might have to pay another 1500 for a fresh application, go through all the processes once again and might even need to give explanation and documentation as to why my earlier application was rejected. And at the end of it, I will have to face a policeman like this pig or the same person again. It didn\'t seem to be worth it. I am not proud of my decision but I did it to save some trouble.\n\nPS: I also acknowledge that I might\'ve been lucky in getting an honest policeman in my hometown and there might be many corrupt ones there as well. Similarly, there might be many honest and good policemen who do their duty properly in Bangalore too. But I got a greedy, corrupt one and wanted to share my experiences here.'<br />Author: 'passport_query_in'  id: 'mtbxwr'<br />Score:48<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mtbxwr/how_corrupt_can_bangalore_cops_get/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Why Sikhs Are HINDUS'<br />Body: 'Waheguru ji ka Khalsa, Waheguru ji ki Fateh. Here is an article I spent some time writing today. Enjoy it and feel free to offer feedback.\n\n[Sikhs are HINDUS](https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000247197013-5zmc38-t500x500.jpg) - it just depends on how you define what *Hinduism* is.\n\nDoes the word Hindu have a geographical-cultural-civilization meaning like it originally did according to the literal definition? Then yes, Sikhs ARE Hindus by this definition, seeing as Sikhism is a byproduct of Indic civilization, culture, and geography. The word \'Hindu\' originally just meant \'Indian\', hell even the word \'India\' is derived from \'Hindu\'! The word was simply transmitted and adopted by different cultures but originates from Sanskrit itself:\n\nSindhu (Sanskrit) → Hindu (Persian) → Indios (Greek) → India (Latin)\n\nThis actually means that \'Hindi\' does mean \'Indian\' in the truest and original meaning of the word, so yes. There is such thing as speaking ‘Indian’ after all.\n\nSome naysayers may claim that Sikhism has "Islamic influences" but it truly does not - you have misunderstood what Sikhism is. All of this supposed "Islamic influence" is actually really superficial and shallow, it is just adopted Islamic terminology to explain Sikh beliefs (which is entirely Indic at its depth). For example, the word \'Khalsa\' comes from an Arabic word but is there anything like what the Khalsa actually means as a system and philosophy existing in Islam? It\'s just adopted terminology, nothing substantial like philosophy or practices. We do not circumcize, we do not acknowledge nor claim descent from the Abrahamic “prophets”, nor do we make pilgrimages to Mecca.\n\nOh and claiming that there are writings of “Muslims” in the Adi Granth is disingenuous seeing as actual Muslims (not the mystical Sufi ones who were heavily influenced by Indic beliefs and practices) would call Kabir a “kafir” and rally for his execution. Do not believe me? Just look at what actual Muslims did to Al-Hallaj in the 10th century, they executed him and Kabir would face the same fate under Shariah. As for the ’Sheikh Fareed’ in the Adi Granth, that author is **not** the Fareed Shakarganj historical figure that it is commonly attributed to by ignorant Sikhs - it was actually written by a personality who was called ’Sheikh Brahm’ who was a contemporary of Guru Nanak and was coincidentally also called ’Sheikh Fareed’ - do not mix the two people up. This has to be one of the biggest and most popular misconception and misunderstanding about Sikhism, the confusion for attributing the ’Sheikh Fareed’ author to Fariduddin Ganjshakar (who lived between the 1100s and 1200s) when the actual identity of this person was Sheikh Brahm. Please explain why traditional stories of Guru Nanak involve him meeting this Sheikh Fareed if it was Fariduddin Ganjshakar, seeing as that Fareed died over two centuries before Guru Nanak was born? Sheikh Brahm was contemporary with Guru Nanak and is the true identity of the Fareed in the Adi Granth.\n\nWhy do some Sikhs believe they are not Hindus? Because they are thinking of \'Hindu\' with a different connotation in-mind. For them, Hindu means someone who participates in “idol worship” (murti-pooja), discriminates based on caste, and engages in rituals. But this does not make any sense as there people who call themselves \'Hindu\' who do not engage in any of the above. So what is a Hindu?\n\nSome may define a Hindu as one who ultimately traces their beliefs to the Vedas. Is there anything in the Sikh canon that rejects the Vedas outright? I have come across verses that downplay its authority and finality (claims that there are even limits to the knowledge found within the Vedas) - but nothing that said the Vedas are themselves wrong. In-fact, many verses seem to praise Vedic knowledge and praises the Gurus as having “mastered the Vedas”. So this cannot be used as a criteria to separate Sikhism from Hinduism like it is used for Buddhism and Jainism (who did reject orthodox Brahmanism in ancient India). Not to mention that there are folk beliefs and practices of Hinduism known as ‘folk Hinduism’ and Agamic sects which are non-Vedic but classified as ‘Hindu’.\n\nWhat about claims that Hindus engage in "idolatry" and are polytheistic whilst Sikhism rejects both things? This is another misunderstanding. There is a lot of delicate nuance to this subject so pay attention. Many Sikhs today claim that our religion is "monotheistic", which just hilariously shows how far they have fallen to Abrahamic propaganda. First of all, Sikhism in its truest sense is best described as non-dualistic, monistic-panentheism. That is what it is. It IS NOT “monotheistic” like Islam and Christianity is. Sikh philosophy and conception of the divine is literally the same one that is found in Advaita Vedanta. There is no difference. I even asked educated Sikhs what the difference is between Gurmat and Advaita Vedanta and they could not list any concrete reason. What did they say? They claimed the difference is that Vedantists were "elitists who believe that only highly educated people can reach moksha" whilst "Sikhs believe anyone, including the general public, can reach moksha; they do not have to be educated", are you serious? That is the only thing separating Sikhism from a Hindu school of thought? Such a flimsy reason based on social-class and education-status, no fundamental philosophical difference? Sikhism is literally just an offshoot of Hinduism (a highly divergent one at that). It is a result of the influence from the Bhakti movement, the longstanding Sant-tradition of India, and Vaishnavist Hinduism (read ‘Chaubis Avatar’ in the Dasam Granth, which was written by Guru Gobind Singh himself, if you have any doubts regarding this one).\n\nWhat about "idolatry" and polytheism? First of all, most Sikhs rely on translations of Gurbani that were written during the colonial and post-colonial period that is heavily influenced by Judeo-Christian terminology and beliefs. Many of these translations of the Sikh scriptures were done by Christian missionaries themselves or by “Sikhs” who studied at Christian missionary educational institutions. Therefore, you can be incredibly misled by them if you do not understand the actual language that Gurbani is written in. Gurbani is in *Sant Bhasha* and was originally written in Larivaar (unbroken) Gurmukhi script. Therefore, even the spacing between words you find in modern-day Gurbani is based on interpretation by later people in our history - it was not done by our Gurus.\n\nEssentially, Sikhs worship what Hindus call ‘Para-Brahman’, this is completely synonymous with the Sikh concept of Waheguru. This is wherein the difference between modern-day Hindu belief &amp; practice *and* modern-day Sikh belief &amp; practice lies. Hindus do not concentrates their worship on Para-Brahman/Waheguru, they prefer to worship the divine using a deity (‘sargun saroop’ of the divine) - Sikhs consider these deities like Shiva or Vishnu to be qualities of the true divineness which is Para-Brahman/Waheguru and they are not used as means for worship. This is the crux of the issue between Hindus and Sikhs. Our Gurus never said that Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Rama, Krishna, Chandi, or any other deity never existed - they simply said they are qualities and agents of the supreme that is even above them which is Para-Brahman/Waheguru itself and it is best to meditate upon and focus our worship on that, not “lesser” elements like individual deities. According to the Guru, it is best to worship the source (Para-Brahman/Waheguru) than the product of it (individual deities) Do not think of Para-Brahman/Waheguru as some sort of separate entity, it is reality itself. It is a primal force that has always existed and will always exist that interconnects all of us. It permeates the Universe and beyond. Guru Nanak’s *Mool Mantar* describes what Para-Brahman/Waheguru is. Therefore, the Gurus discouraged idolatry out of sympathy for the masses, as they knew that most people would fall into empty ritual when doing it and not be fully devoted and understand the amount of love required for it to be helpful.\n\nWhat is life in Sikhism? It is a divine play. Imagine that Para-Brahman/Waheguru is a dreamer and we are characters in this dream, in-fact this metaphor is used in Gurbani itself. We are not separate entities - we are actually Para-Brahman/Waheguru but our ego (‘haumai’) does not allow us to realize our true divine nature. This is the non-dualistic philosophy of Sikhism. This is exactly the same in many schools of thought within Hinduism, please read the Bhagavad Gita and the concept of “leela” (लीला).  Where is this supposed difference between Sikhism and Hinduism? I am not seeing any so far!\n\nOn the topic of “idolatry” (murti-pooja), you need to be very careful. The act of murti-pooja itself is not an evil or heretical act like it is portrayed as in Abrahamic religions like Islam and Christianity. Nobody is automatically destined for hellfire in Sikhism just because they waved a fire around an idol. What is the position of murti-pooja within Sikhism? The Gurus *never* claimed that this was an offensive, heretical, or evil act that offended some sort of mister God sitting in the clouds somewhere. It is simply a very fickle matter and it is very difficult to do true aarti in a murti-pooja. A true murti-pooja is ascending beyond the material world and using the idol as a means to connect to this greater divineness - it is not actual worship of physical material or depictions. The reality is, many people do not understand this and they fall into empty rituals and do not connect to the divineness - this is what the Gurus warned us against in-regards to murti-pooja. But there are many saints, whose writings were included in the Guru Granth Sahib, who were avid practitioners of murti-pooja and used actual stones as their idol, such as Bhagat Dhanna the Jat. Murti-pooja only works if your entire being is dedicated, devoted, and full off pure love for the divine. It is not effective if done as an empty ritual. The Gurus believe that one does not even need an idol as a means for connection, we can use the ‘tenth door’ (dasam duar) that is found within ourselves! Therefore, you can do murti-pooja but you have to be very careful or else it will be fruitless and a waste of time. Do you honestly believe that if the Gurus thought *the very act* of murti-pooja itself was offensive and not **the intention behind it**, that they would include writings of “idolaters” in their sacred Guru Granth Sahib? Give me a break!\n\nHistorically, Sikhs celebrated our shared Indic mythology, canon, practices, beliefs, and iconography with Hindus. The Gurus themselves wore tilak &amp; earrings (go look at contemporary depictions of the Sikh Gurus, not colonial and post-colonial ones made by Abrahamicized Sikhs), and fully understood the teachings of Indian civilization. The armies of Ranjit Singh carried flags showing Indic deities like Chandi! The Gurus explained the teachings of Sikhism using pre-existing Indic terminology and deities as a metaphor - not once did they reject to this Indic heritage. They were active protectors of it.\n\nSikhism is a divergent offspring of Hinduism with some new inventions like the Five K’s, placement of importance on maintaining uncut hair, kar seva, sant-sipahi idealism, community of the Khalsa, and a few others (Indic civilization is constantly inventing and adapting to the times). Why was Sikhism needed? It was an Indian civilizational response and development to the challenges that Islam had brought to our land. The Kshatriya traditions of Hinduism were ailing and people were abandoning this civilization and adopting the robes of Islam - a befitting reply, that was born philosophical and martial in-nature, was needed to safeguard this civilization from this enemy.\n\nIn-fact, Sikhism was successful at reversing the inroads that Islam had made in the northwest regions of the subcontinent. Let me quote Mughal Emperor Jahangir as evidence:\n\n&gt; "In Goindwal, which is on the river Biyah (Beas), there was a Hindu named Arjan, in the garments of sainthood and sanctity, so much so that he had captured many of the simple-hearted of the Hindus, **and even of the ignorant and foolish followers of Islam**, by his ways and manners, and they had loudly sounded the drum of his holiness. They called him Guru, and from all sides stupid people crowded to worship and manifest complete faith in him. For three or four generations (of spiritual successors) they had kept this shop warm. Many times it occurred to me to put a stop to this vain affair or to bring him into the assembly of the people of Islam." \n\n- Emperor Jahangir, Tuzuk-i-Jahagiri (“Memoirs of Jahangir”)\n\nLet us not forget that the Sikh Confederacy and Empire was the first time that indigenous Indic people ruled the northwestern part of the subcontinent for over a millennia! Even the Khyber Pass was safeguarded under Indic-control and the Afghan menace was repulsed beyond the Hindu Kush. It was the fault of the British that Islam revitalized in the subcontinent.\n\nWhy is this shared Indic connection being abandoned and distanced from by modern-Sikhs? Because they have been eating-up Abrahamic propaganda and distortions ever since the British set foot in this land. This is why Sikhism has been in-decline in the modern-era. How can something thrive if it’s not even being understood or followed properly by the vast majority of its adherents? Time for Sikhs to wake-up. We **ARE** Hindus but in some ways, we are also not (it depends on how you want to define what a Hindu is). Time for us to face truths that is bound to make many in the community feel uncomfortable but the Truth will always prevail and triumph in the end.\n\nDo you know what the last words of Guru Tegh Bahadur were to Aurgangzeb before he was executed in Delhi for objecting to the forced conversion of Kashmiri Hindus?\n\n“My answer is that I am a Hindu and I love Hindu dharma. How can anyone destroy it? It provides happiness both in this world as well as in the other world. There is no other religion like it. Only a deranged person or a fool would leave it to become vile. Hindu dharma would remain in the world for ever. It is not going to be destroyed by your efforts.” - Tegh Bahadur’s reply in Hindi to Aurangzeb when he was asked to become a Muslim. Source: Kshitish Vedalankar: Storm in Punjab, p.178.\n\n“Listen All! Said Tegh Bahadur: Those who stick to their Dharma are called brave. I know my Hindu Dharma to be the best. How can I forsake that which is very dear to me? It (Hindu Dharma) gives immense joy in this world and the next. Even life is trivial compared to honor. The fool whose intellect is corrupted, That idiot alone will forsake it. I will endure harm to establish Hindu Dharma in this world. It will never be destroyed even if you try.” - Attributed in Sri Gur Pratap Prakash written between 1835-1843 CE by Kavi Santokh Singh\n\nGuru Gobind Singh quote:\n\n“Let the path of the pure [khâlsâ panth] prevail all over the world, let the Hindu dharma dawn and all delusion disappear. \nMay I spread dharma and prestige of the Veda in the world and erase from it the sin of cow-slaughter.” - Gobind Singh, quoted in Shourie, Arun (1993). A secular agenda: For saving our country, for welding it. New Delhi, India: Rupa. also quoted in Elst, Koenraad (2002). Who is a Hindu?: Hindu revivalist views of Animism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and other offshoots of Hinduism. ISBN 978-8185990743\n\nBefore you call me a “Hindutva propagandist”, you should know that I was born in a typical Jatt Sikh family in the Western-based diaspora. Growing-up, I also thought Sikhism was alien to Hinduism and India. I was even a proponent and supporter of Khalistani separatism. It is only through educating myself throughout the years that I have understood what our Gurus started and what Sikhism really is. It all makes complete sense now - none of it made sense when I was younger. There were always contradictions, fuzziness, and things that did not make sense in the mainstream modern interpretation and following of Sikhism by the masses. I hope all Sikhs come to the same realization that I did so we can bring about the changes in Kali Yuga that we are destined to be the saviours of.\n\nBole So Nihal Sat Sri Akaal!\n\nAuthor: tera_tera\n\nDate of Writing: April 17th, 2021 CE / Shanivaar, 4 Vaisakh, 553'<br />Author: 'tera_tera'  id: 'mt5h09'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mt5h09/why_sikhs_are_hindus/</li>

Gerry Arathoon, the head of ICSE decided that for some reason, postponing the decision about whether the boards should be kept or not is a better idea than cancelling it. The official release from CISCE states that the students have two options, they can either write the boards along with the 12th graders once the conditions are conducive for holding an exam (the decision for keeping the boards will be done on the first week of June) or they can refrain from writing the boards and can instead get evaluated by a subjective criterion which is yet to be announced.***\n\n***Obviously, this is far from ideal as it puts the students who opt for the first option through academic hell for nearly two months just on the false pretence that the boards will be held. Mr Arathoon can very well decide to keep us waiting until then and then just announce the boards are cancelled and all the hard work will be for nothing. This also affects those who want to migrate to different syllabuses from ICSE such as state or CBSE but now it won’t be possible for those students as they may or may not have to write the boards in June. By that time most of the intermediate (PU) college seats will be occupied by CBSE and State board students, and the ICSE students will have ISC as the only other option.***\n\n***Secondly, for those who opt for the second option, we are still in the dark about the way we are going to be assessed and graded and once we choose option 2 we can’t choose option 1 if we aren’t satisfied with the grade, something which the students of CBSE have the luxury of enjoying as all of them will be graded in a certain way and only if they are unsatisfied they can write the boards at a later date. This also raises the question about how each individual schools set the papers, grade the students and how they give the internals as no two schools use the same way of grading. Some schools have had only one preboards/prelims/mocks while other schools may have had 2 or 3 or even more.***\n\n***With this decision, we can say that the mental health of students and parents are completely disregarded. This decision brings a lot of stress to the students who opt for the first option as they’ll have to study continuously for nearly two months for a board exam which hasn’t even been confirmed. And the students who opt for the second option and are not satisfied with the marks will go through a great deal of stress and ridicule from their parents and society in general since our society cares more about marks rather than the mental health and safety of students.***\n\n***And finally going back to the first option about writing the boards, we still don’t know how the COVID situation will develop by then but it is certain that having thousands of children throughout the country appear for the boards when the cases are down will only worsen the pandemic situation and may lead to the loss of life not only of the students but also the family members of the students, the teachers, invigilators and so on. With all this in mind, we humbly request you all to come in aid of us ICSE students as we have been done a great injustice by the CISCE board and Mr Arathoon. We all stood with the students of CBSE and helped them in their dire time, all we request you to do is to come to our help now, please tweet with the hashtags #cancelicseboardexams2021 #CBSE #ICSE #cancelallboardexams2021 #dontpostponeboards #internalassessmentforall and let's ensure this gets on trending and CISCE notices the situation students are facing.***\n\n***Sincerely***\n\n***Students of ICSE***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vuei4j8oept61.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dce50ad253e882147634b6eea0aa76b6ee365ba"<br />Author: '0_metzgermeister_0'  id: 'msnrq7'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/msnrq7/icse_fiasco_the_struggle_of_the_students_and_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Why are we so passionate about claiming sikhs are hindus? This is damaging relations with our sikh brothers and is theologically flawed. (Please read the whole thing before casting judgement) Thankyou, Jai Shri Ram🙏🏾'<br />Body: 'Hey brothers and sisters my aim here is to create an open discourse and I\'m curious to see your opinions. I use blunt language but I mean no offence 🙏🏾. \n\nI have messaged about this previously however I did not articulate my points very well, therefore I\'ve added information to make my point clearer. Ultimately my goal here is to highlight that it is a waste of time to keep imposing that Sikhism is a sect of Hinduism. I have two main reasons why I think it is a bad idea to go down the route of claiming Sikhs as Hindus. 1. It does not benefit us and is actually a hindrance. 2. The theology behind it is flawed. (Read the reasons before judging) \n\n1. It damages the reputation of Hindus: \nSikhs, Muslims and even english people are using the term "Hindu extremism" to reference Hindus calling sikhs a sect of them. They say that we are imposing our beleifs on others. (I dont know why Muslims are getting involved, Ahmadi Muslims constantly claim Guru Nanak was a Muslim you can read their articles online). Even many Hindus are saying we are imposing our beliefs on them. So from a PR\xa0 standpoint this is a really bad look for Hindus and actually hinders us. Because they look at us as just another abrihamic religion trying to control or appropriate the faiths of others. (Our religion does not teach this) \n\n\n2.\xa0 The ideology behind this argument is flawed:\nWhen I was looking at arguments of whether Sikhism was a sect of Hindusim, firstly I was looking only at ideologies (presented to me from fellow hindus) which imposed the idea that Sikhism is indeed a sect of Hinduism. After this I was convinced and I started to debate with some of my close Sikh friends, ultimately this didn\'t end well for me 😂. They encouraged me to go and look from the Sikh perspective. Which seems reasonable as I wouldn\'t go to a mosque and talk to an Imam to try and understsnd Hinduism, I would go to a pandit. So I researched the Sikh perspective and tbh it completely blows away the argument that Sikhs are a sect of Hinduism and highlights just how faulty this ideogy is. That is why I\'ve come to conclusion that this is a losing battle. \n\nWhen I look at the ideology behind claims that Sikhs are a sect of Hinduism it is ultimately flawed. I know the intentions are good but ultimately it falls apart when you have a conversation with an educated sikh. When I look into the arguments claiming that sikhs are a sect of hindus they are extremly selective and do not look at the wider concept. Lets leave the scriptures for now and start with the lives of the gurus "Guru Nanak was born into a Hindu family". This is not a valid argument Christ was born into a Jewish family, that doesn\'t\xa0 make him a jew or mean that Christians are jews. Guru Nanak heavily criticised many aspects of Hinduism he also did this with Islam. His religion was so ambiguous that Muslims and Hindus fought over how to bury him. Guru Nanak does not claim inspiration from Hindusim but claims it from God himself and as he explains it, this god is the same god Muslims beleive and the same god Hindus believe. He states and Sikhs themselves beleive that he reflects god in human form and is above all previous prophets. From a Sikh perspective it is clear that Guru Nanak himself is saying that none of his teachings are derived from Hindusim and any correlation that there is with hinduism e.g. reincarnation reflects the truth that is in hinduism and not from hinduism itself. \n\n(Be under no illusion Hindus, Sikhs themselves make very bold claims and believe their religion is the ultimate truth derived from god). When I look at sources that claim Sikhs are Hindus they often strawman what sikhs beleive to make the gurus seem more in touch with Hindusim. They fail to mention that the first sikh convert was muslim (bhai mardana). They try to state that as a people Sikhs have solely hindu ancestry or 95%. This is factually untrue and when reaserched it is closer to 50/50 or at the very, very least 70/30 (hindu to muslim) there are recorded cases of mass conversions of muslims to sikhism from mughal and Sikh sources. Guru nanak converted many sufi saints and their followers. Guru Arjan converted big groups of muslims as referenced by the mughal king Jahangier in his autobiography (even if they were all hindus which they weren\'t thats akin to me saying all Christians should become jewish it\'s not a sound argument). Guru Gobind Singh Jis army was 20% muslim (when I found this out I was gobsmacked and didn\'t know what to say). Even after the gurus, Banda Singh Buhadur (a sikh warrior who converted from Vaishnava to Sikhism under guru gobind) when he took punjab he converted many muslims on mass (by free will). Also there is a Hindu obsession with Guru Tegh Buhadur because he stuck up and helped Hindus in Kashmir. This argument is based on a reference in which he calls himself a "hindu". This Is a really bad reference that was made in the 19th century and secondly It is a reference to his heritage being past the indus river a "hindu" (the word hindu did not even exist in a religious context then, only in a geographical sense so he is saying he is an Indian). Many sufis such as Bulleh Shah refer to Guru tegh Buhadur as a ghazi (meaning a warrior of Islam and Allah) again idk why we tend to miss these points out and cherry pick the ones that suite us. (Bulleh Shahs sufi poetry at the time of the Sikh gurus clearly distinguished sikhs, hindus and muslims as separate\xa0 religous groups).( It is clear that guru Tegh Buhadur was neither a muslim or a hindu but a sikh and to represent him differently is extremely disrepectful. This is espically so considering all the things he did for hindus.)\n\n\nThe ideology that sikhs are hindus also crumbles when you look at the Sikh scriptures. The guru granth sahib rebukes all hindu texts multiple times including the vedas and the purans "He is beyond the world of the Vedas, the Koran and the Bible. The Supreme King of Nanak is immanent and manifest". The guru granth sahib also qoutes "Rama, Mohammad, eighteen Puranas (Books of the Hindu faith), and Quran (muslim faith) say a lot about their own religions but I do not follow any one of them". (Again highlighting Sikhs believe guru Nanak is god and his teachings are not derived from Hinduism. This also highlights that the sikh scriptures themselves are presenting the idea that they are different/distinct from Islam and Hindusim) "The great volumes of the Simritees and the Shaastras only extend the extension of attachment to Maya". "One may read all the books of the Vedas, the Bible, the Simritees and the Shaastras, but they will not bring liberation". (Guru Granth Sahib Ji, Ang 747). Sikhs beleive indisputably that the guru granth sahib contains a higher level than all the hindu and islamic books that have come before it so therefore there must be something deeper in it than both hindus and muslims can supply. This is what we hindus are missing, we will never convince sikhs that they are hindus because they believe their teachings are deeper than ours. Guru Gobind Singh Ji openly states this, that compared to hinduisim and islam "the new way of the khalsa is supreme". This idea that Sikhism holds Hindu theology in a high regard and above other faiths is a made up concept and is highlighted again when pir Bhiken shah (a muslim saint) prayed to guru gobind when he was a baby (as he saw the light of Allah in him). Pir Bhiken shah then held out two sweets one from a muslim shop and one from a hindu shop, to see which one the guru preferred Hindusim or Islam. Guru Gobind Singh Ji then put his hands on both to symbolise they are the same. This is what\'s not understood by many hindus, though on a theological level Sikhism and Hinduism are more similar to each other than Islam, Sikhs and their gurus themselves veiwed Hinduism and Islam (Sufism) the same while stating that their own religion is superior ( what I mean by this is Sikhs believe that belief itself is not important. They beleive that for a human good actions and connecting to god is the most important thing one should do. So believing they are the "superior" in this sense means they believe that their path and teachings are the best out of any to facilitate that connection to the one and good actions. They do not beleive their path is the only path to do this, so in this case "superior" is not the same "superior" that Islam has where they are exclusive.) Any theology you try and pin on them will fall apart such a reincarnation (yazdis believe in that and so do arab nostics they aren\'t sects of hindusim, agian they believe any similarities that are apparent are a reflection of truths that hindusim has and not from them). \n\nThe issue of Ram comes up alot too, but Sikhs openly say they believe in Ram and revere him but that doesn\'t make them hindu (just as us revering the sikh gurus doesn\'t make us sikh). Just as swami vivekanad writes about his reverence for jesus, this does not mean he is now a Christian. Muslims also revere Jesus that doesnt make them Christian either. Sikhs do not beleive, however that Ram or Krishna are on the same level as their gurus and claim their gurus to be perfect (the gurus hold this view too). They also use the word Ram in two situations one to represent the historical figure and one to represent the one god. They use this representation to compare him to Allah saying they are one in the same (speaking up for hindus being persecuted because of their beleifs, saying to the muslims the allah you pray to and the Ram they pray to are one in the same. Sikhs use the names Allah and Ram interchangeably for the name of god. Sikhs also have their own distinct names for god such as Waheguru and Akal Purakh). \n\nThe issue of the Dasam granth (a book written by Guru Gobind Singh ji) also comes up to reinforce the narrative that sikhs are hindus but again this is destroyed by context and education. It is claimed that Guru Gorbind Singh Ji worships Durga, how can this be the case when in the dasam granth it also says “I have killed hill Rajas (kings) who are bent on mischief. They are stone idol worshippers, I break idols and I worship ONE lord.”\n(Zaffarnama, Guru Gobind Singh Ji).( Hindus shouldn\'t really be too worried about this line I know it sounds extreme but the hill rajas were bad hindus that sided with the mughal government and were complicit in the forced converstions of other hindus). Even though Sikhs are against idol worship (im sure no hindu would disagree with that) when I speak to my sikh friends they say that the word idol in this verse is a metaphor for greed and pride as these were the things that the hill rajas worshiped and so these are the things guru gobind singh ji came to destroy (not an idol in the physical sense we know it). So how do we reconcile a praise to Durga in dasam granth with "I worship ONE lord". The sikh perspective is this, hindus aren\'t taking into account context. Just as the Bhagvad Gita is presented in the context of Krishna having a conversation with Arjan (a hindustani living in 1500BC). The dasam granth is presented in the context of a sikh who has already read guru granth sahib and achieved moksha. (Dasam granth is an important text to the sikhs but not as important as the guru granth sahib). Guru Gobind wrote this text to then embolden the sikhs and give them "bi ras" to fight the mughals at overwhelming odds. So unlike the context of the guru granth sahib where Sikhs argue that the text is universal across time and culture (individuals from two completely different cultures can read it and understand it such as hindus and muslims). So in the instance of the dasam granth the storys told arent factual stories, Sikhs OPENLY say this (such as the story of krishna with muslims in it when islam wasn\'t even a relgion). But it does not matter to the sikhs because the overall purpose of the dasam granth is not to educate or reach moksha ( it presumes you have already reached that level at this stage) its purpose is to inspire sikhs to be active, fight injustice and to not fear death ( maybe this is the reason behind sikh over representation and their rather large effect on India in comparison to their small numbers 2%.\xa0 They had a big impact on the mughals despite their numbers and during the struggle for independence against the British 80-90% of people who recieved life imprisonment or were hanged were sikhs). \n\nSo no Sikh scholar or intellectual sikh accepts worship of Durga for it would contradict the guru granth sahib and even the dasam granth "I worship ONE lord". They exclaim that the poem chandi di var is worship of the khalsa and not Durga ( I see many hindus singing chandi di var on navarati, beware we are not singing in praise of mata ji but in praise of the khalsa) they reference Durga as Bhagauti which means weapon. What does every khalsa memeber have at their side? A Bhagauti (kirpan). What is Bhagauti (Durga) sitting on? A lion or better known in punjabi as a "singh". What does the kirpan sit on? A singh (Durga symbolises a singh going into battle being lead by his shasta/kirpan). The story is a metaphor for the khalsa. Bhagauti fighting the demons is a metaphore for Sikhs fighting the mughals. (I can go deeper into how it relates more to the khalsa but I think you get the gist). \n\nThere is a real historical story to back this up from guru gorbind singh ji. Guru Gorbind after saving a mundir was encouraged by the pandits to pray to Durga for she is the protector of dharma and the sikhs can win any battles with her on their side. Guru Gobind humours the head pandit Keshav das and asks him how is this the case? Keshav das replies I can summon her for you. He would reveal the goddess by reciting the “Chandi Mantra” one lakh times but would need a ridiculous amount of samagari for a havan (thinking this would be too tiresome for the guru to do). The Guru surprises the pundit and asks his sikhs to get all the samagari for the Havan. When the items are gathered the Guru goes up to Keshav das and asks him to summon Durga for all to see. Keshav das begins to get visibly stressed as he knows he cannot summon Durga and exclaims that to summon Durga a sacrifice of your most beloved son is needed (looking at guru gobinds eldest son) the guru laughs and touches Keshav das saying anyone who would go through this trouble for me is my most beloved son. Keshav Das soon after this runs away with the pandits. Guru Gobind Singh Ji then asks his sikhs to grab all the samagri and and dump it into a fire creating a massive havan near the mundir. Soon hindus and sikhs begin to gather as a great flame arose. The hindus ask the guru is Durga here to which he replies yes, Guru enters his martial form and raises his sword in the air and exclaims "This is Chandi”. This is the real Durga which vanquished enemies in battlefield, this is the Kaalka which drinks blood of enemies and destroys them, this is the Bhagauti which protects Dharam and destroys evil”. (The message here to the hindus is if you want to protect your faith from the mughals pick up the sword and fight) he is also exclaiming that he does not beleive in the same Durga we hindus beleive, which takes the form of a beautiful women sitting on a lion but in the form of a man/woman raising the sword to protect dharma (to a sikh the real protector of their faith is themselves this is why sikhs use imagery and metaphors to describe worship of "the sword or Bhagauti" in the sense that we use metaphors and imagery through worship of the "mother cow"). \n\nSo this argument that sikhs worship Hindu gods is false \n“I do not adore Ganesha in the beginning and also do not mediatate on Krishna and Vishnu; I have only heard about them with my ears and I do not recognize them; my consciousness is absorbed in the feet of the Supreme Kal (the Immanent Brahman).434". When a Sikh uses the word Brahman or Ram in reference to God it is in reference to one formless god. For a Sikh it is not stating any special relations with Hinduism as it can be interchangeable with Allah and many verses in the guru granth sahib use reference to arabic words for god such as Allah instead of the hindu or Sanskriti words for god ( the word "khalsa" itself is an arabic word meaning pure). This may be obvious to most but when I read arguments or watch videos based on arguments for sikhs being a sect of hindusim. They don\'t seem to realise the fact that the gurus were indian and of course they are going to use Indian concepts to explain god such as Brahman otherwise their followers would have no idea what they were talking about. (Remember alot of their converts if not a majority were hindu). Just as Arab Christians refer to god as Allah, this does not make them muslim. A better argument I think for us to make is that Sikhism comes under the dharmic branch of faiths and just like Christianity shares ancestory with Judaism and they are under the same abrihamical branch. So is Sikhsim and Hindusm under the same dharmic branch. But it is without a doubt evident that the Sikh gurus preached a religion seperate from Hinduism. Not one educated sikh or scholar of Sikhism accepts the claim that Sikhs are a sect of Hinduism and that in itself is a very bold statement that I think we should consider. We are not convicing anyone but ourselfs, not one Christian, Muslims or Sikh accepts this perception of Sikhism not even many Hindus. This concept of dividing Hinduism if sikhs aren\'t apart of us is absolutely silly, sikhs being a seperate religion doesn\'t weaken Hindusim our culture is distinct and more than beautiful enough as it is. We also need to let go of our pride it\'s not worth dying on this hill arguing that sikhs are Hindus. No one is convinced and we are talking to ourselfs, the only ones outside of hinduism that are listening are mocking us and using this flawed ideology as fuel to propagate the term "hindu extremism" WE NEED TO STOP.\n\n\n(In reference to Sikhs thinking their religion is the best just because they think this does NOT mean they are entitled to talk down and disrespect other faiths and this is referenced In their guru granth sahib. I have no problem with them thinking their relgion is the best because I beleive Hinduism is the best and I beleive that we should he more confident in saying that. To each their own and we should not be disresptecting the faith of others unless they attack us first Jai Shri Ram 🙏🏾)'<br />Author: 'jujuubaaa'  id: 'msbne8'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/msbne8/why_are_we_so_passionate_about_claiming_sikhs_are/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Humped Zebu,most dominant cattle breed today originated in India &amp; were first domesticated in Indus c6000 BCE.Inspite of intimate trade,zebu genome is detected in Fertile Crescent only 4000 years later.This human-mediated migration coincided with multiple century drought &amp; decline of IVC c.2000 BC.'<br />Body: "&gt;Together with their sister subspecies Bos taurus, zebu cattle (Bos indicus) have contributed to important socioeconomic changes that have shaped modern civilizations. **Zebu cattle were domesticated in the Indus Valley 8000 years before present (YBP). From the domestication site, they expanded to Africa, East Asia, southwestern Asia and Europe between 4000 and 1300 YBP, intercrossing with B. taurus to form clinal variations of zebu ancestry across the landmass of Afro‐Eurasia. In the past 150 years, zebu cattle reached the Americas and Oceania, where they have contributed to the prosperity of emerging economies.** The zebu genome is characterized by two mitochondrial haplogroups (I1 and I2), one Y chromosome haplogroup (Y3) and three major autosomal ancestral groups (Indian‐Pakistani, African and Chinese). **Phenotypically, zebu animals are recognized by their hump, large ears and excess skin. They are rustic, resilient to parasites and capable of bearing the hot and humid climates of the tropics.**\n\n&gt;According to data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2019) approximately 1.48 billion cattle are reared worldwide, and over half of this population is concentrated in only eight countries (Fig. 1). **Brazil currently tops the list with the largest cattle herds in the world, having 218 million head of cattle and a cow‐to‐person ratio of approximately 1. Following closely is India, with a herd of 186 million animals. Importantly, the vast majority of the cattle found in these two countries are either B. indicus or carry substantial zebu ancestry.** To illustrate the magnitude of that figure, the global buffalo population is estimated at no more than 200 million. Therefore, there are twice as many zebu cattle in Brazil and India alone as buffaloes in the whole world. This datum highlights the importance of the B. indicus subspecies, and justifies this review article's interest in the population genomics and evolutionary history of zebu cattle.\n\n&gt;The Indus Valley was the domestication site of B. indicus cattle about 8000 YBP (Loftus et al. 1994; Meadow 1996; Bradley et al. 1998; Patel 2009) (Fig. 3).\n\n&gt;**Although B. indicus cattle are not prevalent in modern‐day Europe, molecular data show a clinal variation of zebu introgression in Eurasian taurine cattle, decreasing from southwestern Asia toward northwestern Europe** (McTavish et al. 2013; Utsunomiya et al. 2014). This is particularly evident in southern European taurine cattle, especially in central Italy, where local breeds exhibit components of both African taurine and zebu genomes (Decker et al. 2014). Although the timing and circumstances of these introgression events remain under investigation, a recently published analysis of 67 ancient Near Eastern cattle genomes suggests that the **influx of B. indicus ancestry into B. Taurus populations was likely mediated by human agency and further driven by an abrupt climate change event about 4200 YBP (Verdugo et al. 2019). A multi‐century drought, coinciding with the decline of the Indus civilization and the collapse of the empires in Mesopotamia and Egypt, is hypothesized to have contributed to the spread of zebu ancestry in Eurasia.**\n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/age.12836\n\n&gt;Genome-wide analysis of 67 ancient Near Eastern cattle, Bos taurus, remains reveals regional variation that has since been obscured by admixture in modern populations. Comparisons of genomes of early domestic cattle to their aurochs progenitors identify diverse origins with separate introgressions of wild stock. **A later region-wide Bronze Age shift indicates rapid and widespread introgression of zebu, Bos indicus, from the Indus Valley.** \n\n&gt;**This process was likely stimulated at the onset of the current geological age, ~4.2 thousand years ago, by a widespread multicentury drought.** In contrast to genome-wide admixture, mitochondrial DNA stasis supports that this introgression was male-driven, suggesting that selection of arid-adapted zebu bulls enhanced herd survival. This human-mediated migration of zebu-derived genetics has continued through millennia, altering tropical herding on each continent.\n\n&gt;The pattern of genetic variation in extant cattle is well established. European B. taurus ,West African B. taurus , and B. indicus of South Asian origin represent three distinct apices in plotted principal components (PCs) Geographically intermediate populations, such as Near Eastern and East African animals, fall in genetically intermediate positions. Projecting ancient cattle genomes  against this genetic landscape, we observe that to the left of PC1, earlier (Neolithic and Bronze Age) genomes fall in three geographical clusters (a, Balkans; b, Anatolia/Iran; and c, southern Levant) along with modern European and African B. taurus ,\nwhereas B. indicus breeds are separated and represented on the far right of the PC plot. This suggests that **cattle origins included two divergent aurochs populations that formed the basis of the B. indicus –B. taurus divide.**\n\n&gt;B. indicus cattle are adapted to, and predominate in, modern arid and tropical regions of the world (11). **Zebu cattle originated circa 8000 yr B.P. ( 12). However, despite archaeological evidence for contact between civilizations of the Fertile Crescent region and the Indus Valley ( 9), the influence of the zebu genome is detectable in ancient Southwest Asian cattle only 4000 years later (Fig. 2). However, after ~4000 yr B.P., hybrid animals (median 35% indicine ancestry) are found across the Near East, from Central Asia and Iran to the Caucasus and Mediterranean shores of the southern Levant (table S2 and fg. S1). During this period, depictions and osteological evidence for B. indicus also appear in the region** ( 9,13). In contrast to autosomal data, but similar to earlier work ( 14 ), we fnd persistence of B. taurus mitochondria, suggesting introgression may have been mediated by bulls\n\n&gt;**This sharp infux may have been stimulated by the onset of a period of increased aridity known as the 4.2-thousand-year abrupt climate change event (9,15–17). This multi-century drought coincided with empire collapse in both Mesopotamia and Egypt as well as a decline in the Indus civilization and has been accepted as the boundary defining the onset of our current geological age, the Meghalayan** (18).\n\n&gt;**Three features of this zebu influx after ~4000 yr B.P. attest that the infux was likely driven by adaptation and/or human agency rather than passive diffusion.** First, the extent of indicus/zebu introgression does not follow a simple east-to-west gradient; for example, it is pronounced in Levantine genomes from the western edge of the\nNear East. Second, the introgression was widespread and took place in a relatively restricted time interval after four millennia of barely detectable B. indicus infuence. Third, it was plausibly driven by bull choice, as we observe up to ~70% autosomal genome change but a retained substratum of B. taurus mtDNA haplotypes(Fig. 2\nand table S3). Hybrid B. taurus –B. indicus herds may have enabled the survival of communities understress and perhaps facilitated expansion of herding into more-peripheral regions. Restocking after herd decline may have also been a factor.\n\n&gt;**Westward human migration has been documented around this time ( 19, 20) along with archaeological\nevidence for the appearance of other South Asian taxa such as water bufalo and Asian elephants in\nthe Near East ( 21), suggesting the movement of large animals by people**\n\nhttps://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02188455/document\n\n“This study of ancient Near Eastern cattle has very interesting parallels to what we know about human populations from ancient DNA,” says Harvard Medical School geneticist Iosif Lazaridis, who was not involved in the research but has done extensive genetics work on early humans and agriculture. **“South Asia, which is where Bos Indicus originated, was not isolated during this period. People seem to have migrated from the Indus Valley civilization into Central Asia around the same time as the climatic effect that happened around 4,200 years ago. This may have introduced zebu cattle ancestry into Near Eastern cattle populations.”**\n\nhttps://www.natureasia.com/en/nmiddleeast/article/10.1038/nmiddleeast.2019.100"<br />Author: 'littichoka'  id: 'mr7z8m'<br />Score:28<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mr7z8m/humped_zebumost_dominant_cattle_breed_today/</li>

Sadhguru and his yogis enter my body every day and minuplated me in many ways making me feel like a human experimant. They disconnect parts of my brain and connect it in ways to make my mind work against me in unexplainable ways making me anxious for hours. They use this technique and drain parts of my brain making me brain dead and to make me not be able to write about the truth every day. Sadhguru and isha yoga center yogis and monks also minuplate my emotion first by making me happy for minutes but its just a trick, i remember sadhguru saying if you work hard on somebody they can make you believe anything they wish and then they start minuplating my mind with new connections pushing my mind wishing i was dead and attempt suicide then they try to help me and play their trick on me again. One may wonder why i have fallen for this trick but it is simple, the simple answer is they keep disconnecting my mind till it i can't generate another thought and make me forget everything they did so i started writing notes talking about how they minuplate my daily life to not fall for this trap once disconnecting my mind. Sadhguru and isha yoga center use this technique before i meet with people trying to embarrass me in front of others and at my work place making me incapable of living a normal life generating my thoughts with energy and pushing on my brain daily so i had to give up living and had to write this for the world to see. Sadhguru and isha yoga center play also with my physical body as if the mind was not enough, they control my facial expression and my energy in ways any sane person would be startled to hear my story. They kept disconnecting my brain as i wrote this passage so im sorry if by the end of the truth if i am unable to continue but i am trying my best to let the truth be heard. I am a regular person not a guru nor a yogi but once a seeker of truth and tried to protect myself by messaging other yogis and gurus for their help from Sadhguru and Isha yoga centers evil wishing their was an escape but if it doesnt work this message will be sent. Sadhguru and isha yoga center also have minuplated me in a way where they press on parts of my brain making me say what they want.

Let\'s see what the congress has done, immediately after independence in was Jawaharlal Nehru who made sure India is bulletproofed from military coups, have you noticed we have never had a military takeover since independence while all our neighbors have! It was under his leadership that most institutes of excellence in the fields of science were established. He made sure that the development of \'scientific temper\' is a civic duty(a duty BJP wants you to fail in). It was under UPA that the Right to Education and Right to Information became civilian rights and empowered civilians to keep in check the government of the day. It was under the UPA that we historically became the first and only country not party to the NPT to receive nuclear material for our power plants. Let\'s check the BJP report card, increase in communal violence, lynching of people for what they eat and then the murderers being considered heroes by the administration. A demonitization exercise in which the responsible minister had no idea ir was taking place, catching everyone off-guard, causing deaths, took a huge hit on the economy at the end of it all the RBI says 99.9% printed currency returned and the entire exercise considered futile and detrimental. The demonizing of intelligentsia by the administration bolstered by the support of party workers and the absolute erosion of autonomous institutions. A confused populace on CAA and the absolute bigotry in its phrasing has embarrassed us on an international level. Who is the BJP, its just two old despicable dinosaurs accused of a pogrom, stalking a women, extra judicial killings and the deaths of a party worker and a judge. Wasn\'t L.K. Advani the PM candidate and wasn\'t it him who initiated the NDA? He was relegated to an office because of a new rule yet the BJP broke this rule for Sreedharan in Kerala. The PM using his office creates a private fund called PMCARES when PMNRF already exists. The audacity to keep this fund beyond the ambit of the CAG, even the beneficiaries and benefactors have been made confidential, the oversight committee are his ministers and party workers, says a lot about transparency.

Of course, we had brave soldiers and a overall a glorious-sounding tale to tell when it comes to the Indian Independence struggle, but don\'t you guys think it was a bit too drawn out? I do. And very much so.\n\nI am a huge army fan and an IAF aspirant too on top of it, but I cannot simply digest the how our revolting procedures used to be in those times. I respect all the contributors of Indian freedom open-heartedly, without a speck of a doubt. However my respect be, reading about how unconsolidated we were based on ideology and approach, is unsettling. There apparently was no common ground when it came to leaders and leading factions, like the Congress *itself*. Common Indians did not seem a wee bit ambitious and just followed whoever or whichever political group looked "juicy" and promising. It kind of reminds me of how Adolf Hitler came to power: through strategic influencing and intense wordplay. Well but in case of India, it was more like giving people a wake-up call from hibernation to follow rather than only persuading them. Many of them would not have even cared had it not had in it any personal agenda or they would probably have only sulked in unjustifiable misery inflicted upon them, without taking counter measures. Or maybe I\'m just a jerky misanthropist. \n\nIt\'s hard not to notice that the picture might have been quite different if the rigor we showed in the QIM, would have been done before so in the NCM or CDM. Mr. Gandhi by that time, had probably realised that using force was the easiest, most convenient and *deserving* way to deal with the British. But thanks to his experimental nature, we lost countless priceless soldiers and patriots which can never be undone. But but, I greatly admire how despite going through what he was going through along with other national leaders at that time, Mahatma Gandhi stuck to his ideals and principles. I do not have much information about his personal life history currently, so I shall not comment on that part. (I\'ll appreciate if you share your thoughts regarding this!) \n\nMoving forward: I do NOT mean to insult any of the esteemed national leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru or Mahadev Desai who followed MK Gandhi, nor Mr. Gandhi himself for that matter, *I am stating my humble observations*. I believe wholeheartedly that whatever was done was done so in the best of all possible mindsets, and with the best result in mind; and agreed, not everything goes as planned. ***No decision taken in the pages of History has ever known to be mono dimensionally fair.*** There always exist downsides; which is again how it happened with us. Going fast in any of those Historical epics could not possibly have reaped any more advantageous fruit, except hasty mistakes or an early Independence (in the best case). \n\nTo be extremely super-extravagantly honest, the title was a clickbait and I didn\'t mean any of it. In fact, I think that given the VAST ethnic and religious and faithful diversity of India, chronology of event unfolding and decision making was excellent. That adversary made me cuss a bit more than my exams do, but never mind really.

      <li>Title::: "A person's fortune is changed through their mind; A person's mind is changed through the power of repetition."<br />Body: 'Fear is the strongest barrier between a person and the greatness they seek. Every day, you are bombarded by subversive messages that manipulate your insecurities: propaganda claiming that pacifism is the solution to differences; falsehoods insisting that you will never be worthy of wealth or power; distractions and deceptions pushing you to be a pawn in\xa0the games of others instead of the master of your own. Though the chains of fear are invisible, their hold can be stronger than the tightest metal shackles. \n\nThroughout our history, Ancient manuscripts have played an important role in Bharatiya traditions – not only as beautifully well written pieces, but also as key elements to reinforce the mental exercises in our rituals. \n\nPlace this message where you will see it in the morning and at night. Spend a few moments reading its words to yourself, using the power of your inner voice to realign your mindset with the peace and harmony of the universal design. Allow yourself to reclaim your power – to insist that you are your only master and that your future is dictated by your choices alone. As this becomes a habit, the subconscious fears that stand between you and your goals will begin to lose their strength and fade into the ether. \n\nA\xa0time of global change is upon us.\xa0Fear Not.\xa0Now is the time to seize the\xa0reins of your future.'<br />Author: 'rabbi9'  id: 'mnankp'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mnankp/a_persons_fortune_is_changed_through_their_mind_a/</li>

Thus with an unagitated, subdued mind, devoid of fear, completely free from sex life, one should meditate upon Me within the heart and make Me the ultimate goal of life.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe goal of life is to know Kṛṣṇa, who is situated within the heart of every living being as Paramātmā, the four-handed Viṣṇu form. The yoga process is practiced in order to discover and see this localized form of Viṣṇu, and not for any other purpose. The localized Viṣṇu-mūrti is the plenary representation of Kṛṣṇa dwelling within one\'s heart. One who has no program to realize this Viṣṇu-murti is uselessly engaged in mock-yoga practice and is certainly wasting his time. Kṛṣṇā is the ultimate goal of life, and the Viṣṇu-murti situated in one\'s heart is the object of yoga practice. To realize this Viṣṇu-murti within the heart, one has to observe complete abstinence from sex life; therefore one has to leave home and live alone in a secluded place, remaining seated as mentioned above. One cannot enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend a so-called yoga class and thus become a yogī. One has to practice controlling the mind and avoiding all kinds of sense gratification, of which sex life is the chief. In the rules of celibacy written by the great sage Yājñavalkya it is said:\n\nkarmaṇā manasā vācā sarvāvasthāsu sarvadāsarvatra maithuṇa-tyāgo brahmacaryaṁ pracakṣate.\n\n"The vow of brahmacarya is meant to help one completely abstain from sex indulgence in work, words and mind-at all times, under all circumstances, and in all places." No one can perform correct yoga practice through sex indulgence. Brahmacarya is taught, therefore, from childhood when one has no knowledge of sex life. Children at the age of five are sent to the guru-kula, or the place of the spiritual master, and the master trains the young boys in the strict discipline of becoming brahmacārīs. Without such practice, no one can make advancement in any yoga, whether it be dhyāna, jñāna or bhakti. One who, however, follows the rules and regulations of married life, having sexual relationship only with his wife (and that also under regulation), is also called brahmacārī. Such a restrained householder brahmacārī may be accepted in the bhakti school, but the jñāna and dhyāna schools do not admit even householder brahmacārīs. They require complete abstinence without compromise. In the bhakti school, a householder brahmacārī is allowed controlled sex life because the cult of bhakti-yoga is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual attraction, being engaged in the superior service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-gītā it is said:\n\nviṣayā vinivartante nirāhārasya dehinaḥrasa-varjaṁ raso \'py asya paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate\n\nWhereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense gratification, a devotee of the Lord automatically refrains because of superior taste. Other than the devotee, no one has any information of that superior taste.\n\nVigatabhīḥ. One cannot be fearless unless one is fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A conditioned soul is fearful due to his perverted memory, his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with Kṛṣṇa. The Bhāgavatam says, bhayaṁ dvitīyābhiniveśataḥ syād īśād apetasya viparyayo \'smṛtiḥ: Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the only basis for fearlessness. Therefore, perfect practice is possible for a person who is Kṛṣṇa conscious. And since the ultimate goal of yoga practice is to see the Lord within, a Kṛṣṇa conscious person is already the best of all yogīs. The principles of the yoga system mentioned herein are different from those of the popular so-called yoga societies.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the position or status of a householder brahmacārī in bhakti, jñāna and dhyāna schools ? Why is it so ?**\n\n**Question 2 : Why a conditioned soul is fearful ? How can he become fearless ?**\n\n**Question 3 : What are the rules of celibacy written by the great sage Yājñavalkya ?**\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wseg9vhqw2s61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29b7e9e02d13c18cdc567f299106e5b14bc7b416\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual&amp;hl=en_IN&amp;gl=US)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'mn9xhq'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mn9xhq/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is61314/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Lal Ded, aka Lalleshwari Ji - Yogeshwari of the Kashmir'<br />Body: "**“Shiva is the sole reality and witness, In whichever direction you look.”**\n\nThese beautiful words were written by none other than Lal Ded also known as Lalleshwari Ji. Lalleshwari Ji was a saint of Kashmir. Although forgotten and rarely mentioned she was an astound Poetess and follower of Kashmiri Shaivism.\n\nDuring the 1320s when the last Hindu King of Kashmir was defeated, The land of Kashmir had fallen into disarray. After the attacks of Zulchu, and then the occupation by Sah Mir had left Kashmir a broken place. In these turbulent times, Lalleshwari Ji spent the majority of her life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Background\n\nNot much is known about the Poetess’s personal life other than that she was a devout follower of Lord Shiva from a young age. According to some scholars she was born in 1301 or 1302 near Sempore or Pandrenthan to a Brahmin family. She was married at a young age according to the customs of the land. Although her marriage was not a happy one she used to find time to follow her heart.\n\nShe was never happy with her marriage as it is assumed that she wasn’t treated well. She was never given enough to eat and never treated with respect by her mother-in-law. She was at times given stones covered by a layer of rice for dinner.  There is a famous anecdote about her married life that sheds more light on it, the story goes like, Once there was a feast hosted by her family, her neighbors teased Lalleshwari Ji how she will eat a sumptuous dinner that night, to which Lalleshwari Ji replied with  “Hand ma’rytan kina hath Lalli nalavath tsali na zanh” meaning  (Whether they kill Ram or a lamb, Lalla will get a stone to eat). This is now a popular proverb in Kashmiri.\n\nShe used to go to get water from the river every morning and come in the evening way later than anyone else. During this time, she used to pray near the Shiva temple. Her Mother in law though could not understand why it took her so long and started to look at her with suspicion. Lalleshwari Ji soon found herself being blamed for infidelity by her Mother in law. Her marriage life was never great but it had now gotten even worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Following Kashmiri Shaivism\n\nBut unlike other Girls, **Lalleshwari Ji refused to go along with it and left her married life**. It was a bold step from her but the one that changed her life and the life of many who would come to know about her. After leaving her house she became a wanderer, going from place to place and begging sometimes even naked, showing that she has given up every materialistic desire. She used to recite her poems also called Vakhs.\n\nThen she met her Guru, Sant Shrikanata who gave her teachings of Kashmiri Shaivism. She followed Shaivism with utmost devotion and went onto become a great philosopher and poet. She wrote many poems about mysticism and even if People at the time period, which used to mock and throw jeers at her, came to respect her work and Intelligence.\n\nShe wrote\n\n*A thousand times at least I asked my Guru*\n\n*To give Nothingness a name.*\n\n*Then I gave up. What name can you give*\n\n*To the source from which all names have Sprung?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer Sayings, Poems, or Vakhs as they are known are famous for every Kashmiri and although her works were against orthodox practices in religion they do describe the Kashmiri Shaivism to its best. Her Vakhs laid the foundation for the modern Kashmiri language as they borrowed words from many different religions and cultures that used to thrive in Kashmir before Muslim invasions. **She took the words from culture and religions like Buddhists, Nath Yoginis, Bhramins, Tantrics, etc and combined them to write her magnificent works which have become a part of the essence of the Kashmiri language.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Death and Legacy\n\nFor many years after taking teachings from her Guru she again spent many years roaming and writing works that would become famous. In 1932 the Famous Shaivism Poet and Saint breathed her last breath and passed away. She may have gone but her work remains and inspires us to this day.\n\n**In her life Lalleshwari Ji wrote poems that inspired all the sects, defying any boundaries made between cultures and religions.** She was critical of many practices by Hinduism but still was a devotee of Lord Shiva in the utmost respect. Her belief was that to find God we must look within ourselves.\n\nOne of her famous works –\n\n*I, Lalla, came through the gate*\n\n*of my Soul's jasmine garden*\n\n*and found Shiva and Shakti there,*\n\n*locked in love!*\n\n*Drunk with Joy, I threw myself*\n\n*into the lake of nectar.*\n\n*Who cares if I'm a dead woman Walking*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is a sad reminder of the destruction of Hindu and other cultures from Kashmir that even after centuries of admiration and respect shown by the people of Kashmir, Lalleshwari Ji has now being forgotten. Ranjit Hoskote, the man who has translated a lot of Lal Ded’s works, writes\n\n*Since the 1980s, however, Kashmir's confluential culture has frayed thin under the pressure of a prolonged conflict to which transnational terrorism, State repression, and local militancy have all contributed. Religious identities in the region have become harder and more sharp-edged,* ***following a substantial exodus of the Hindu minority during the early 1990s, and a gradual effort to replace Kashmir's unique and syncretically nuanced tradition of Islam with a more Arabocentric global template***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*P.S - If you find any factual mistake    in the above article please feel free to correct.

      <li>Title::: 'Do you all think the distribution of resources by this Government has been fair and well-rounded, that the welfare of the people has been looked after and that the performance report of the present Government outshines that of any other party/alliance that could have possibly been at the Center?'<br />Body: 'The Asian Development Bank estimates that between 2016 and 2030, developing countries in the region will need to spend $1.7 trillion per year to build the infrastructure require to "maintain its growth momentum, eradicate poverty and respond to climate change". In December 2019, India set a goal of building infrastructure worth $1.4 trillion in the next 5 years.\n\nIf we look at the indexes like the HDI, education, poverty, disparity (inequality), income/composition of resources, the reports have all been bad, even before the pandemic appeared. \n\nEven industrial growth rate has decreased in the recent years. India directly went from the primary to the tertiary sector, except for only IT that received a boost earlier. We export a lot of high-skilled manufacturing goods and services completely avoiding to look at the other end of the spectrum. Given the population can produce large amounts of relatively low-skilled or less-educated labor, we could have used that to reverse the imbalance in the country\'s economic sector. While modernization would have fueled the agricultural system besides eventually putting an end to the low-income trap, the policy changes were not well-received by the farmers. \n\nIf we look at the \'Make in India\' initiative, the manufacturing sector was supposed to increase 25% by 2022 with the growth at 12-14% each year. Even the additional 10 crore jobs promised never seemed real (even if the pandemic did not happen). The unemployment has risen and the Govt. has not spoken about that in any of his speeches. Not a single remark!\n\nIf we look at the budget, there should be more focus on education, health care, innovation or R&amp;D (which has always been treated as the black sheep under every Govt.) to name a few. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile one can achieve only this given the constraints in the resources, do you all think the distribution has been fair and well-rounded, that the welfare of the people has been looked after and that the performance report of the present Government outshines that of any other Government that could possibly have ruled the nation?\n\nDon\'t shoot the messenger, don\'t be sensitive.

I think this is largely true in the Indian context.\n* The Indian parent demographic is likely to grow on reddit.  We are the next gen "UNKILS AND AUTIEZ"!\n* I\'m frankly kind of shocked this wasn\'t already present /active yet.\n\n## PARENTING INVOLVES BOTH MOM AND DAD\n\n* And depending on your family setup- Grandpa and Grandma\n* Or perhaps just the mom.

      <li>Title::: "A question on basic physics (asked by my dad) but I didn't know clear answer that I am confident of. And another question on boomerangs"<br />Body: 'So, I was talking about basic aerodynamics and lift mechanism. In this context I mentioned bernouli\'s principle. There are two things here\n\n1. Lift - A fluid flowing around the surface of an object exerts a force on it. Lift is the component of this force that is perpendicular to the oncoming flow direction\n\n2. Bernouli\'s Principle - In fluid dynamics, Bernoulli\'s principle states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in static pressure \n\n(Now I have read the article on Wikipedia but not when I was talking to my dad)\n\nAs an illustration of Bernoulli principle, I gave an example of putting your finger at the mouth of a garden pipe in which water is flowing. Here you notice that the speed of the water increases.\n\nHis question : How does illustration of Bernoulli\'s principle translate into explaining the lift phenomenon? How is air flow around a foil an analogue of illustration of Bernoulli\'s principle?\n\nI had no answer.\n\nAfter a bit of reading, not a lot (don\'t have much time at hand too, quite busy), I\'ve come to following explanation : Fast flowing air is at a lower density when compared to slower flowing air. So on a foil, if the bottom has a slower flowing air, it will have a higher density. Difference in density at top and bottom of the foil will create a squeeze in upward direction. This squeeze is analogue of placing a finger at the mouth of garden pipe with flowing water. \n\nIs the above explanation correct? If there is a better one, I\'d like to know. \n\nNext question was on how does a boomerang function. I turned blank. Here he is visibly annoyed - it\'s a reflex i.e. even if he planned to not show his annoyance, he\'d have. "So, 5000 years ago, Australian aborigines knew how to make weapons out of boomerangs and here you an IIT graduate don\'t even know how it functions?" It was pretty insulting. Not gonna lie, it hurt me.\n\nSo did any one attempt to make a boomerang? Either by yourselves or for your children (I could see lot of boomerang toys on Amazon)? I\'d like to make one. Any pointers?

Unlike our media houses, I am not going to treat \'allegations\' made by \'mediapart\' as the same as facts rather will try to explain and maybe debunk some of their points. \n\nFor that part, I was going through different Forum from the french forum ( air-defense ) to our Indian ones ( BRF and DFI ), I tried gather some of the great points made by them and will quote them here, so let\'s just go through few of the points/questions which are being mindlessly repeated in the Indian media : \n\n**1) Is Defsys a middleman or offset partner?** \n\nThis part should have been clarified first by the Indian newspapers but they didn\'t so just for the information Defsys is one of the partners along with many others of the Dassault which were supposed to receive some sort of offset, from the website of Dassault itself : \n\n&gt; ***3. Partnerships have also been signed with other Indian companies such as*** *BTSL* ***,*** ***DEFSYS*** ***,*** *Kinetic, Mahindra, Maini, SAMTEL,… Negotiations are underway with a hundred other potential partners.* \n\nSource :  ( [https://www.dassault-aviation.com/fr/groupe/presse/press-kits/a-propos-contrat-rafale-inde/](https://www.dassault-aviation.com/fr/groupe/presse/press-kits/a-propos-contrat-rafale-inde/)) \n\nAs you can see there are multiple companies which were signed a contract with Dassault and one of them is guess what Defsys, this literally clears the whole drama about why they were paid. \n\nComing to Defsys company, since I am running out of time I will quote it from the french forum : \n\n&gt;Ah! This is who the payment was made to, the company DEFSYS.  \nAnd here is the object of the offense! 50 "large scale models of Rafale"!  \n... Except that since Defsys Solutions manufactures RF measurement equipment , it is not surprising.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://www.defsys.co.in/infrastructure.html](https://www.defsys.co.in/infrastructure.html)  \n[https://www.defsys.co.in/about.html](https://www.defsys.co.in/about.html)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I quote the DEFSYS website:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*"In Defsys we execute Design and Manufacture of:*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Integrated Electronic Systems, Electro-Optical Payloads, Thermal Imagers, Flight and Firing Simulators,* ***Weapon Replicas*** *, Electro-Mechanical systems, On-board electronic sub-systems, Automated Test Equipments (ATEs),* *RF* *&amp; Microwave Sub-assemblies, Radar &amp; Seeker Simulators,* ***RF*** ***Test and Measurement systems.*** *The Company also provides a range of support services such as maintenance and on-site upgradation of existing military systems.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Defsys Solutions is an ISO 9001: 2008 certified company spread on five locations across India;* *two of them being the manufacturing units. "*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hmmm, a company that manufactures " **gun replicas** " generally used for wind tunnel tests for example, and **radio-frequency test and measurement systems** ... would therefore have the skills to manufacture ... **Rafale replicas intended for radio-frequency measurements** ?!? Noooo, impossible, I can\'t believe it.\n\nI think most of the people here are thinking that middleman is just one person who got the money but no, first of all they are partners, not a middleman and second they were part of the contract under which they were supposed to deliver a certain number of the replicas, some wanted image proof, well here it is, when this report was written at least 2 of such models were delivered in partnership with Dassualt at IAF headoffice and IAF chief office, these are not toy planes but larger replicas of the rafales itself as shown here in the pic as a proof: \n\n[Humans for size comparision](https://preview.redd.it/z4koydr54jr61.jpg?width=1201&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51c624577d7c7151540202ff3892189151b209fd)\n\nThe amount **is less than 500k euros ( around 4 crores ) which is wayyyyyyy lesser than the total deal of 57000 crores, around 0.0008% of the total deal. If anyone remotely thinks that this is the price if there was actual corruption then they should connect to Anil Vaze who will proly get you more than 100 crores per month not just once.** \n\nWhen factored into the cost, 25 model large size replicas sit around 20k euro which is not bad if we are looking at models shown above and factor that many models may or will be used for RF measurements as hinted, the rest can be used for various purposes. When the article was written at least 2 to 3 were already delivered. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2) 1 million euro paid for 50 models which to DEFSYS as a \'gift\' because of middleman which were not seen anywhere and doesn\'t exist**\n\nOn the contrary to the headline, the deal was for 1million for 50 models but the amount paid was 500k euros for 25 such models but most of the articles didn\'t mention it, they just copied exact terms and rest with it, coming to the \'didn\'t exist\' part...that\'s clearly either lazy paperwork from Dassault side or they were just ignoring for it being a small deal or that time those models images which were shown above weren\'t made cuz the models did actually were delivered and some of the pics of the models were actually published in the mainstream media like the print ( [https://theprint.in/india/rafale-jet-model-installed-outside-iaf-chiefs-house-bang-opposite-congress-hq/243629/](https://theprint.in/india/rafale-jet-model-installed-outside-iaf-chiefs-house-bang-opposite-congress-hq/243629/) )\n\nAs mentioned above. Now coming to report itself, now from the media part : \n\n&gt;***In spite of the apparent irregularity*** *,* ***the AFA*** *, which is answerable to both the budget ministry and the ministry of justice in France,* ***did not refer the matter*** *to* *prosecutors, according to Mediapart.*\n\nMaybe because there was nothing to tell? When you are talking about a deal for 59k crores slight deviance could be for multiple reasons, here unless medipart proves that there\'s actual corruption their claims are just claims, hell they claim there was no model but above you can see the model itself being covered by news outlets. Plus another part, about the image, remember the keyword \' **Rafale replicas intended for radio-frequency measurements** \' this could be the combined work of Dassault and Defsys, so do they really think they will provide the images of EM equipments? really? \n\n**3)  About the \'mediapart\' itself** \n\nReminder when the media part report came many people knew that it was a hit piece, many regular reliable Indian OSINT like \'wolkpack\' who is anything but a bjp supporter came in full force and sated that it was another hit piece. He even provided this : \n\n&gt; Mediapart which published the new report on Rafale middleman, is run by Edwy Plenel (a French journalist).  Edwy Plenel, an ex-Trotskyist, was allegedly working for the American CIA in the 80s as per a claim by former French President Mitterrand: \n\n[https://twitter.com/reg\\_bit/status/1379064261872218113](https://twitter.com/reg_bit/status/1379064261872218113)\n\nApart from these i couldn\'t confirm but they are a leftist media and whose reference was removed from Wikipedia overnight. \n\nA probable hit piece from a US indirectly backed agency, since similar to India France doesn\'t really control these agencies like scroll the wire but it is pretty easy to understand who they are batting for. Even guardian a propaganda pusher batted for media part and we all know that US / UK + Germany + Italy and gang / Sweden have their own agenda here, they will push hit pieces because if another 36 rafale deal materialises then they will lose on billions of dollars, hit pieces or lobbies are nothing new here.  The only issue is that our media mindlessly serving their interest without putting their own brian into it. \n\nWhatever be that case, indulging in ad hominem is not the best way but it\'s better to get this point aside too so that we have an idea of possible interests groups here, that\'s why i mentioned this part. \n\n4**) What I think.**\n\nMy first reaction was that fuck this is \'hit piece\' and I got in an argument with one of the earlier posters but later it was better to go through the points which they are quoting and debunk or explain it rather than involving further. \n\nThough I think it\'s a hit piece but no one can outright reject it, at the end we are going to state what we collected from the various source we might not know everything that\'s why I wish it would be better if GOI and Dassault come clean on it, it is clear that Dassault has been reckless here but I don\'t think anyone is going to destroy their billion-dollar deal due to some million so they would have been careful if that was the case but a clearance from that will be better.\n\nOr like earlier if our opposition actually rather than mudslinging goes to court and forces government to answer or court taking care as the last time and rejects their petitions for obvious grounds that claims are not facts and they have no merit. \n\nThanks.

Some farmers felt ambiguousness in this haste.\n3. **Anxieties related to the farming sector:** A small farmer faces a lot of anxieties, such as price fluctuations, demand and supply issues, etc. related to farming sector. These reforms do not seem to address a lot of such anxieties of the farmers.\n4. **Provisions of MSP:** Some misplaced concerns from Haryana and Punjab farmers that MSP system will be eventually withdrawn.\n5. **Unrelated reasons:** The protests have at time displayed flavors of identity concerns of Punjabi's Sikhs (Khalistani movement), which is unrelated to the subject in matter of these protests which were the farm laws.\n6. **Exaggeration about implication of these laws:** People who are participating in these protests, while discussing these laws, have at times seem to heavily exaggerate the impacts these laws are going to have, such as takeover of the entire farming sectors by the Ambanies and Adanies, farmers becoming slaves of the corporates etc. which of course was a heavy over simplification of the issue in order to fit one particular narrative.\n\nSome of the Justifications for these laws are:\n\n1. **Primary reason for bringing these laws:** These laws were primarily introduced to fix the shortcomings in the existing APMC system which was to limit the roles of the middlemen and traders in the APMC mandies. This is because, given that usually there are only few traders in the APMC mandies who are licensed to trade, such traders therefore have disproportionate powers over farmers in agricultural deals. Therefore the government bought these reforms to allow trading outside of APMC mandies and in Private mandies to limit the role of middlemen in APMC mandies. This is the primary reason why these laws have been bought, and these laws were not bought just to corporatrize the farming sector as have been at times suggested.\n2. **More options gives opportunity of more income:** The provisions such as the contract farming, private mandies etc. which are there in these laws are for providing more options to the farmers to sell their produce. One can, although simplistically, deduce that more options provided to the farmers will mean they will have a better chance of making more money.\n3. **Predicting the future is not easy:** The exaggerations which are being done on implications of these farm laws are not justified as one cannot make the prediction of the future - such as Corporate takeover - this simplistically. More so, even if these laws were not bought it would still have been difficult for anyone to estimate what the shape of the agricultural market would have been in the future. So to say these laws will spoil every thing in the future or to say every thing is and will remain great if the status quo is maintained is not the something that anyone state with absolute certainty. Therefore efforts made by the government for reforming the sector, even if there is tentativeness in those, should not be out-rightly rejected.\n4. **Repealing the laws without sufficient reasons:** Some of the farmer union leaders have been asking to out-rightly repeal the laws, and they do not seem to provide sufficient justification for such demand, this is a fundamentally incorrect recourse to have and if done so, will set up incorrect precedence for the law making process of the country in the future.\n\n**P S** : For those interested I have done a bit more detailed discussion on the above in the following video(s).\n\nIn English: [Farmers protests - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3M86pTHLI4&amp;t=204s)\n\nIn Hindi: [किसानो का आंदोलन - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNkvzb-pQO8&amp;t=66s)\n\nThanks and may you have a nice day."<br />Author: 'yuganshs'  id: 'ml71ds'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ml71ds/as_farmers_protests_in_india_seem_to_be_subsiding/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Review of book: Swift horses Sharp swords'<br />Body: 'This book attempts to keep the things in perspective and critically look at our weaknesses and their origins. The first chapter of the book emphasizes the need to read history. Comprehending the past is necessary to evaluate the present and prepare for future. It provides a shared identity composed of the images that we have of ourselves as a people with a collective sense of shared destiny. It gives a definite sense of who “we” are and ensures a deep psychological bond among ourselves along with feeling that the nation is worth defending.\n\nPost Independence, the work of writing history has been left in the hands of Marxist historians and they were found to be propagating the distorted and secular viewpoint. Nothing positive or uplifting is taught about India. India’s monumental achievements in the areas of science, mathematics, astronomy, grammar, logic, mind sciences, warfare and administration are missing from today’s curriculum. Instead what we find is blatant Hinduphobia disguised as secular scholarship, perpetuated through tropes likes “Buddhism Good, Hinduism Bad”, “Islamic egalitarianism”, “syncretic culture”, “scientific spirit” and so on. This book is an honest attempt to introspect on the finer points of Hinduism. It also dwells upon the weaknesses and cites “Dharmayudda” and “Caste system” as the major reasons for our defeat in hands of Islamic invaders.\n\nThis book encompasses a vast sweep of events, which changed the history of India forever, and introduced it to an alien faith and a religious despotism such as the country had never experienced before. It also dwells upon the point that many glorious civilizations like Egypt, Persia and Mesopotamia were put to rest by Islam and fanatical version of Islam was savagely imposed. Nations from the straits of Gibralator to the banks of Indus were assimilated in Islamic empire without any struggle in a very less time, but why it has failed to convert whole of Indian population into Islam. The author lists main reason for this to be great heroism, untold savagery, stout resistance, of Hindu Kings because of whom India is the only ancient civilization to have its culture and religion intact. Sagas of Hindu contributions and the valour of Hindu kings like Raja Dahir, Lalitaditya, Pulakeshin, Nayaki Devi, Jaipal, Suhel Dev, Prithvi Raj and many more in medieval era (which were emphasised in this book) were comfortably brushed under the carpet by Marxist historians.\n\nIt is therefore not a travesty to say that Islam struggled for 500 years to conquer India but failed due to stiff and continued resistance of Hindus. Hindus have survived as a majority in their motherland not because Islam spared any effort to conquer and convert them but because Islamic brutality met more than its equal in Hindu tenacity for freedom.\n\nOnly disagreement I have with author is that of his claims about Aryan Migration Theory. Aryan Migration Theory has been categorically debunked with the help of corroborative scientific evidence from the fields of archeology, geology, linguistics. The ancient-DNA results reject the theory of Steppe pastoral or ancient Iranian farmers as origin of the ancestry to the Harappan population, and questions the earlier hypothesis about mass human migration during the Harappan time from outside South Asia. It sets out to pitch Harappans as Indo-vedic people. Apart from this, every other chapter in the book is fascinating and is based upon extensive research.\n\nOriginally Posted by u/Im_impossible\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pmx12rnkfdr61.png?width=1410&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1141394e1c16f8500d83c428d797f57314bffc2c'<br />Author: 'RutabagaNo4448'  id: 'mkn1dd'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mkn1dd/review_of_book_swift_horses_sharp_swords/</li>

Bela Bhatia's husband is Jean Dreze who was on Sonia Gandhi's National Advisory Council for deciding India's policy during UPA. Jean Dreze also co-authored papers with Amartya Sen, who himself is married to Rothschild family which funds Naxal groups via their NGOs.\n\nOne organisation it funds is Prerana, which lists Asha for Education as a partner on its website. In 2002, the founder of Asha for Education, Sandeep Pandey, attended the party congress of the Naxalite group Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)-Liberation and called for the unity of “revolutionary” organisations. CPI(ML)-L openly advocates an “armed revolution” and its stated objectives include the use of “illegal” methods and raising an army to wage a war against India. At their 2002 meeting, the party also honoured “comrade martyrs” or terrorists killed in action.\n\nPanda revealed that he had arranged meetings of activists from Delhi with Maoist leaders like Ramanna and Hidma several times in the interior villages of Sukma, the SP said, adding that his surrender is an important achievement for the cops.\n\nhttps://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-arrested-naxal-says-nandini-sundar-had-links-with-hardline-ultras-du-prof-denies-allegations-2443559\n\n#Hidma is the Maoist commander who orchestrated today's massacre of jawans\n\nThe operation was mounted against Battalion No. 1 Area Commander Hidma, one of the most dreaded and wanted Maoists. However, the intelligence input about the presence of the most wanted Maoist leader Hidma in the area, it seems, was a well-laid out trap. The Maoists, armed to teeth with light machine guns, were waiting in the foliage and caught the special forces off guard. The fierce gun battle that ensued continued for over three hours.Sources believe Hidma was “actively present” in the area and his team was responsible for the attack Saturday.\n\nhttps://www.indiatoday.in/india/video/bijapur-naxal-attack-intelligence-on-hidma-a-trap-for-security-forces-1787105-2021-04-04\n\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/india/chhattisgarh-maoist-attack-encounter-bijapur-sukma-7258123/\n\n#Hidma is believed to have played an important role in all major attacks against security forces since 2013. This includes the Jhiram Ghaati attack on a Congress convoy in May 2013 leading to the death of 27 party leaders, and two other big back-to-back offensives, one being the well known Burkapal attack against security forces in 2017 that left 25 CRPF personnel dead. \n\nHidma is said to be involved in one of the worst attacks on security personnel in 2010 when 76 CRPF jawans were killed at Tadmetla in Dantewada district. His involvement is also suspected in the March 2017 incident when 12 CRPF jawans were ambushed as they had gone to secure a road-construction party near Bhejji in Sukma.\n\nEvery year from January to June, Maoists launch their tactical counter-offensive campaign (TCOC), where red ultras carry out the deadliest ambush targetting the security forces.\n\nLast March, they had laid a similar ambush in Sukma’s Minapa, where they killed 17 personnel. In April 2019, BJP MLA Bheema Madavi, his driver, and three personal security officers were killed in an attack in Dantewada.\n\n#In 2010, Nalini Sundar and JNU Professor Archana Prasad have been booked along with some Maoists over the murder of Shamnath Baghel, a tribal in the insurgency-hit Sukma. Baghel, had been spearheading the protest against Naxal activities.\n\nBaghel and other villagers had registered a complaint with the Tongpal police in May, this year, against Sundar, Prasad, Tiwari, Parate and an unidentified woman activist from Sukma for allegedly inciting tribals against the government and seeking their support for Maoists. According to the police official, some armed Ultras were referring to that complaint and anti-Maoist demonstrations while attacking Baghel.\n\nIG Kalluri said that Baghel’s wife had accused Sundar and others of murdering her husband. She had said that her husband had been getting threats from Maoists since he and other villagers had complained against Sundar in May this year.\n\nGiving further insight into the activities that possibly could have led to Baghel’s death, IG Kalluri stated,  “Villagers of Nama and the neighbouring Kumakoleng village (both under Kumakoleng village panchayat) had started a self-motivated protest against Maoist activities in their villages after forming their own security group named ‘Tangiya (axe) group’ in April this year. Following the development, according to villagers, Sundar and others came to the village to allegedly threaten them not to oppose the Maoists.”\n\nhttps://newsable.asianetnews.com/news/maoists-nalini-sundar-chhattisgarh"<br />Author: 'YepGrasshopper'  id: 'mkfkro'<br />Score:179<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mkfkro/du_professor_wife_of_wire_founder/</li>

The  bench passed the order despite counsel for Dr. Sen seeking adjournment  of the matter.\n\n On 15 April 2011, the Supreme Court of India has granted bail to Dr.  Binayak Sen, after questioning the sedition charge against him and adding that "the question of passing letters or documents does not arise."

      <li>Title::: '[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Suez Canal jam cleared, WHO team releases report, and the story of Hong Kong'<br />Body: 'Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Geopolitics Thread! Here, we discuss the latest news from around the world. Discussion does not have to be related to India. Please share and discuss news in the comments. Here are a few stories to get the conversation started:\n\n# Top stories\n\n1. [Attempted attack on US Capitol](https://news.yahoo.com/us-capitol-lockdown-vehicle-shooting-police-victims-173000580.html)\n\nA policeman, Billy Evans, was killed after a car rammed into a barrier outside the US capitol building (which was not in session at the time). The attacker, identified as 25 year old Noah Green, proceeded to attack other police officers with a knife before being shot and killed. According to Green\'s social media posts, he had become radicalized through the Internet during a period of unemployment during the pandemic. He identified with the radical neo-religious cult called the Nation of Islam which, despite its name, is not a mainstream form of Islam and is generally categorized as an anti-Semitic black nationalist group.\n\n2. [Suez Canal traffic jam finally cleared](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/stranded-ships-suez-canal-cargo-dislodged)\n\nNormal traffic finally resumed on Saturday through the Suez Canal, the world\'s busiest trade choke-point, a full week after the giant Ever Given ship was dislodged. The hold up caused such a massive traffic jam (over 400 ships were left stranded in the Red Sea) that it took a week for authorities in the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) to clear it. An investigation into what caused the incident is underway, with high winds being blamed initially. Ships that sail through the Canal are piloted by SCA engineers from Egypt, so mistakes by the mostly-Indian crew seems unlikely.\n\n3. [Iran nuclear talks on the cards](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20210403-france-calls-on-iran-to-be-constructive-at-nuclear-talks-in-vienna)\n\nFour years after then US President Donald Trump unilaterally walked out on the Iran nuclear deal (formally the JCPOA) and imposed the most crushing sanctions ever on the Islamic Republic, the US and Iran seem ready to hold talks again. This has been facilitated by France and Germany, who are technically still in the JCPOA and are pushing the US to return. The sanctions saw Iran\'s economy shrink by about a third as its only significant export - oil - became harder to sell. The US state department welcomed talks but refused to lift sanctions as a pre-condition.\n\n4. [Massive train crash in Taiwan kills 50, injures 178](https://apnews.com/article/world-news-taiwan-05d6f99b2405f75ee71bd8a79935d016)\n\nA high speed train in Taiwan faced a rare crash after colliding with a truck that was sitting on the tracks just before a tunnel. The crash killed 50 people and injured 178. An arrest warrant has been issued for the truck\'s owner as authorities investigate the series of events that led to the crash. This is the worst crash since 1948 on the island nation that depends heavily on train infrastructure to move people around. Among the dead was the train\'s young, newly-married driver.\n\n5. [WHO team criticized for vague COVID-19 origin report](https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/us-13-other-nations-concerned-about-who-covid-origins-report)\n\nThe US and 13 other countries issued a joint statemen where they criticized a report prepared by a multi-national team of WHO investigators. The report on the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (aka the coronavirus) was largely inconclusive except for two aspects: it came from an animal, and it didn\'t come from a Chinese lab in Wuhan. The team was severely hamstrung by Chinese officials, with half their one month allocated time in China being used up at a quarantine facility. China has refused to grant further access to investigators, calling instead for an investigation of US military facilities. China has spread a conspiracy theory that the virus was created by the US military.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The rise of Hong Kong\n\n*This is the fourth and final part in a series on the Asian tigers of the last century: Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and South Korea. Please share feedback and ideas for new stories.*\n\nHong Kong has been in the news in the last few months for its anti-China protests and Beijing\'s apparent success at containing democracy on the island. In some ways, this mirrors the economic history of the area: from being the dominant economic power in the area, it is now but a small footnote as compared to even neighbouring Shenzhen. Modern Asia\'s first economic giant is gobbling up its first Asian Tiger, both politically and economically. \n\nThis was not always the case though. In 1842, the Qin Empire (after whom the exonym China comes) was defeated by the British in the First Opium War, a once-unthinkable event that could only happen because the British had established control over India and had an abundant supply of sepoys from there to fight their wars. In the Treaty of Nanjing, the Qin ceded Hong Kong island in perpetuity to the British as a natural port to conduct trade from. In 1860, after the Second Opium War cemented European domination over Asia\'s once great civilization, the British further annexed Kowloon and added it to Hong Kong. However, while these areas served as excellent ports, they lacked freshwater and sources of food. As a result, the British leased the New Territories in 1898 for 99 years, which made up for these shortages.\n\nRight from the beginning, Hong Kong was setup to serve but one purpose: to facilitate trade between China and British India, and from there Britain itself. To that extent, most laws and regulations were lax save those that pertained to trade. Commercial courts for speedy arbitration of disputes, infrastructure for quick transshipment, a massive financial industry to bankroll the endeavor (the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation or today\'s HSBC Bank was established for this),  absolutely minimal labour protections, and a complete absence of democratic representation were the chief characteristics. Over time, sugar and cement industries also rose. However, the party came to an abrupt halt in WW2 as Japan occupied Hong Kong after handily defeating the British garrison there, ravaging the area. After Japan was defeated, Britain took back control of the territory even as mainland China fell into chaos with the Civil War and the victory of the Communist Party.\n\nIn the 1950s and later, Mao\'s destruction of China\'s economy with the disastrous Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution saw a flux of refugees from China going to Hong Kong. By then, the British had granted some minimal self-government though the focus was still very much on industrial growth. The territory became dotted with small and medium enterprises, literally factories of 10-50 people that produced things like furniture and nuts and bolts to support the giant shipping and banking industries. This was in stark contrast to the other Asian Tigers, which used either foreign-owned or family-owned large companies to generate industrial activity (notice that nobody chose to depend on state-owned enterprises like China and India at the time). During this time, Hong Kong also served as a port to quietly import food into China, where people were starving to death even as the country was officially exporting food to show the "success" of its collective farming efforts. \n\nBy the early 1980s, Hong Kong had settled into a steady rhythm: the colonial government created an enabling environment for businesses with minimal regulation, focusing instead on providing housing and universal school education. The society was deeply unequal, with those with ties to British companies gaining the most. But overall, conditions were much better than in neighbouring China. But change was in the air: in the mainland, Deng Xiaoping had become Chairman of the Communist Party and immediately denounced Mao. He opened up the economy to foreign trade and investment, clamping down heavily on Mao-style labour unions and dropping all socialist ideology in practice. Within a decade, industries started moving out from Hong Kong into China, suddenly finding equally lax regulations but much cheaper labour. In response, the financial industry in Hong Kong grew even bigger to support these industries, as China still maintained significant capital controls. Hong Kong abruptly went from a manufacturing economy to a services economy. The reintegration of China with the world began with Hong Kong.\n\nIn 1997, the 99 year lease on the New Territories was up, and Britain decided to cede not just that but all of Kowloon and Hong Kong island back to China - with the promise that newly-established democratic institutions (the so-called Basic Law) would continue. Thus, "one country, two systems" was born and served China well - Hong Kong was still a bigger economy then China at this point, and Deng had no intention of killing the goose that laid the golden eggs. As long as Hong Kong\'s financial sector would service China\'s manufacturing industries, everything else was acceptable. The Asian Financial Crisis and the SARS epidemic hit Hong Kong hard and further cemented the symbiotic relationship with the mainland. \n\nThings are of course changing now. China is a much larger economy than Hong Kong and tightly integrated with the rest of the world. It has no problem in attracting financing for its industries, and therefore has no need to maintain one country, two systems. And China\'s President-for-life Xi Jinping is on a mission to once again make China the "middle kingdom" - the economic and political sun around which every other Asian nation will have to revolve. In this world, Hong Kong may be the first territory that Communist China pulls into itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What stories caught your attention?*'<br />Author: 'ididacannonball'  id: 'mk9p5b'<br />Score:36<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mk9p5b/rindiaspeaks_biweekly_geopolitics_thread_suez/</li>
      <li>Title::: "Caste system is just occupational lobby system gone rigid over millennia. Has little to do with religion. It's really bad. But religion doesn't dictate it."<br />Body: "Back in historical times, people did not have internet to browse their career options. Universities in ancient India, while they were several, offerred a limited number of courses that did not cover all the occupations required for the functioning of an economy. Plus as we all know, not everyone can afford a university education. So people learned their occupational skills mostly from their parent(s). This led to nepotism in every industry.\n\nPeople belonging to same professions tend to form groups and band together, often to assert their rightful place in or dominance over the society. This leads to creation of lobbies. Some lobbies are more powerful than others, and the power struggle is constant. Depending on technological advances and cyclical fluctuations in the economy, the dominance hierarchy of these lobbies rearranges from time to time. This is a worldwide phenomenon.\n\nImagine you are a member of a lobby that's based off of a particular occupation. How do you ensure that your hierarchical position within the lobby is secure and strengthened? You marry off your kid(s) to those of other influential figures within your lobby. If someone does it, everybody else does it as well. This eventually lead people to marry within their own lobbies only (people of the same profession).\n\nOver time, segregated communities were formed. These communities shared similar lifestyles, had their own unique traditions, beliefs, celebrations, cuisines, festivities, rituals, etc. All the castes that exist today are named after the profession that the particular community practises/practised.\n\nNepotism + lobbying + marrying within the community made the lobbies more and more rigid over time. Yet one could still change their occupation, although the entry barriers were high.\n\nThen the British came and in their attempt to understand how the system worked, they conducted a caste based census in India. They wiped out entire communities that were considered as 'criminal castes' (google origin if the word thug). The census made the social hierarchy prevalent at the time permanent. Post that, people haven't been able to change their castes. The caste you are born into is the caste you die in no matter what.\n\nThe Varna System, which is a broad categorisation of castes, also is a world wide phenomenon.\n\nBrahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra and untouchables were basically Intellectuals, Kings or Warriors, Businessmen, Working class and social outcasts respectively. These classes exist the worldover even today.\n\nThe caste system developed over a long course of time as a natural consequence of voluntary compartmentalisation of the society.\n\nIndians were smart enough to identify its development, and dumb enough or short sighted enough to think it was the correct course for the economy and for the society. Not many objected since everybody wanted to benefit from their own respective lobbies. They still do. Which is really sad because what many don't realise is that they are burdened way more than they are benefitted from adhering to the culture and traditions of their castes.\n\nAnyway, the point is, religion has little to do here other than occasional justifications for the system.

      <li>Title::: 'Important things to remember while admitting patient in Covid ward (Or any kind of hospitalisation)'<br />Body: '*Important things to remember while admitting patient in Covid ward (Or any kind of hospitalisation)*\n\nHowever fancy the hospital maybe, it does not mean that nursing staff will be attentive. Recently we had to admit a close family member into Covid ward in a big hospital. This was the first time I was handling hospitalization process. I have the following observations. \n\n* 1] For each patient there is a file with the staff. In that file, all the daily monitoring details of patient are mentioned. Patient’s signature is also taken on the sheets in that file, on regular basis. Most of the times, this file is filled by the nurses or attending doctors. Senior doctors may check the file once in a while, to assess patient recovery.\n\n* 2] Above file also serves as a proof to submit to the insurance company. Insurance companies required that certain bio stats (body temperature, blood pressure, SpO2, sugar level, urine tests, etc. etc.) are recorded regularly in this file.\n\n* 3] The staff who enters data in this file can be negligent. They may simply write the same data points in the file again and again, without even visiting the patient. \n\n* 4] I was surprised to know that body temperature was taken by bare hands by the nurses in Covid ward. When the nurse was asked about this, she said that they “know” how much is the temperature is from hand reading. We feel that it is unhygienic to take temperature from multiple patients by bare hands. \n\n* 5] BP, temperature, SpO2 were monitored once a day (or not at all), only when patient insisted on it. But there were multiple readings mentioned for them in the patient’s file.\n\n* 6] Saline - Usually in normal wards, a relative of patient usually sits who can call the nurse to stop saline when the bottle is empty. In covid ward, the staff can be negligent and may “forget” to stop the saline when the medicine is finished. \n\n* 7] For another patient in the same ward (who is our family friend), on the patient’s file, the nurse had written 98% SpO2 everywhere. Whereas the patient was given oxygen during the whole time because the real oxygen level was low (it was 86% in reality). If insurance company notices this discrepancy, I think it will surely raise the questions about why oxygen was given to patient when SpO2 level were good.\n\nIn order to deal with above issues, following are my suggestions - \n\n* A] If the patient is in good health, they should talk with the staff and keep on reminding them to do their duties properly. Patient should inform the relatives immedialty whenever they see negligence.\n\n* B] The relative of patient, should speak with staff and doctors, if they see such negligence.  \n\n* C] The patients relative / patient should take the photos of patient’s file on regular basis. This file can be easily obtained from hospital staff. \n\n* D] Do not depend on hospital to do their job properly. Be proactive!'<br />Author: 'randianNo1'  id: 'mjyr64'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mjyr64/important_things_to_remember_while_admitting/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Congress and their love for India.'<br />Body: 'Please read this and give your feedback. If anything is false or misinformation kindly inform me where you disagree. (Source : A telegram channel, guy is banned on twitter and social media) \n\n\n\n"Please give me back my Rajiv, I will return to my country, and if you cannot let me die here so that my remains is also part of this earth - Sonia Gandhi"\n\nIf you look at the activities of Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, who is saying this, then you understand on what mission she is actually engaged in.\n\nSonia\'s hold was not as strong on the system until Rajiv Gandhi\'s assassination. Then came PV Narasimha Rao, who continued to do his work, ignoring Sonia Gandhi.\n\nAtal Bihari Vajpayee was Prime Minister from 1999 to 2004 and during this time Sonia was also kind of helpless. But as soon as congress came to power in 2004, although she could not become the PM Sonia via her National Advisory Council started the mission she was waiting for, ever since she came to India.\n\nIn 2005, under the pressure of Sonia Gandhi, the Manmohan government made the 93rd amendment to the constitution. This amendment meant that the government could take over the educational institute of Hindus but could not even touch the institutes belonging to SC and ST or minority institutions.\n\nThis was Sonia Gandhi\'s biggest move to separate Dalits and Adivasis from Hinduism. The effect of this was that it became very difficult for Hindus to run their educational institutions. Sonia enacted the Right to Education Act in 2009 on the advice of the Church. Through this, it was made necessary to enroll 25 percent poor students in general educational institutions whereas there is no such obligation on other institutions belonging to ST/SC and minority institutions. Infact minority institutions were even exempted from giving reservation to scheduled castes and tribes.\n\nSonia\'s stakes have fatal effects:\n\nThe 93rd amendment of the first constitution and then the Right to Education (RTE) Act made it much cheaper for Christians and Muslims to run educational institutions. \n\nOn the other hand, educational institutions belonging to Hindus were being closed.\n\nMany medical and engineering colleges run by people of the Lingayat community in Karnataka. When the crisis arose in front of them, they started demanding recognition of the Lingayat community as a separate religion different from Hindus. A similar demand also arose from the Sai devotee community. \n\nActually, it was the bet of Sonia Gandhi, so that on seeing this, different communities of Hinduism started demanding the status of separate religion themselves calling themselves different from Hindus. The plan even went so far as to give vent to the demand for recognition of a separate religion to communities like Kabirpanthi, Nath sect, Vaishnavism. \n\nAt the time of independence with similar stakes, the Congress separated the Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists from Hinduism.\n\nIn fact, since 2004, at the behest of Sonia Gandhi, the Congress governments took many decisions which were really an attack on the backbone of Hinduism. Surprisingly, the media fully supported the Congress in all these.\n\nAffidavit on Ram Setu:\n\nIn 2007, the Congress government gave an affidavit in the Supreme Court that since Ram, Sita, Hanuman and Valmiki are fictional characters, Ram Sethu cannot be considered of any religious significance against a case filed by CM of TN JJ and not Swami as he claims\n\nWhen the BJP took up the matter (not Swami) and fought vigorously, the Manmohan government had to pull back.\nHindu terrorism term was coined to discredit Hindus in their own land:\n\nEarlier the word terrorism was never used with Hindus. After the Malegaon and Samjhauta train blasts, contrary to the evidence the Congress governments, in a very deep conspiracy, wrapped up Hindu organizations in this blast and expressed that the threat of Hindu terrorism was looming in the country. \n\nThey falsely implicated and tortured an army officer and a Hindu monk for over a decade. Whereas the truth was far from it. These conspiracies of the Congress have been dismantled in the court.\n\nTrying to divide the army on caste lines:\n\nDuring Sonia Gandhi\'s time, there was a great effort to divide the Indian Army into caste and religion. Then, based on the recommendation of the Sachar Committee, a survey was conducted on Muslims in the army. The matter was suppressed after the opposition of the BJP, but it is still seen as a serious attempt to break the forces of the country. Also the upgradation needed for the army in terms of equipment and machinery was denied seriously hampering their preparedness\n\nGovernment help to the church:\n\nLittle will be known that wherever the Congress government was formed, to what extent the government-funded the church from tax payers money. This was revealed by the RTI in Karnataka, where the Siddaramaiah government in the name of repairing and maintaining the church Crores of rupees were distributed.\n\nOur sage Shankaracharya arrested:\n\nIn 2004, when the Congress came to power, Shankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati of Kanchi Kamakoti Peeth was arrested on the night of Diwali, which was considered to be the work of the then Jayalalithaa government of Tamil Nadu. But the former President Pranab Mukherjee later mentioned the incident in his book, which showed that the game was actually created by the Central Government. \n\nShankaracharya was a hindrance for the Christian missionaries in their conversion of Hindus. He was implicated by the Congress to defame Hindus.\n\nObject to the prayer of the Kendriya Vidyalaya:\n\nThis is the case of 2019 when an application was filed in the court to change \'Asato Ma Sadgamay\' through a lawyer as this was the daily prayer in Kendriya Vidyalaya schools. It is claimed that Sonia Gandhi\'s mind was behind this. She had tried to put an end to this even before her reign of 2014 but could not succeed.\n\nDoordarshan logo:\n\nThe logo of Doordarshan was "Satyam Shivam Sundaram" which was also removed during the Manmohan government, at whose behest, we can very well guess.\n\nThere is so much more behind the scenes perhaps we will never know which died with pappu\'s father and AHMED PATEL (Sonia Gandhi).\n\nJai Hind'<br />Author: 'Aye_chup'  id: 'mjuj86'<br />Score:79<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mjuj86/congress_and_their_love_for_india/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Representing against the new Re-registration &amp; Fitness Tax hike proposals for older cars'<br />Body: "The proposed hikes in taxes to sustain the older (15 years or older) private motor vehicles are quite draconian and the attached notification by the Transport Ministry dated 15.03.2021 is evidence enough that the government is now coercing old motor vehicle owners to either pay more or scrap. Many gullible owners will try to avoid paying such huge fees and maybe fines to retain their respective motor vehicles and will under duress succumb and hand over his or her otherwise fit old vehicle to the scrap yard. The Media Handout in the second attachment was released by the Transport Ministry to justify the scrapping policy and is coloured and distorted with fudged figures and statistics, much to the old vehicle owner's disadvantage.\n\nThe hike in taxes, huge fines for delays in fitness can be represented against to the Ministry of Road Transport and our representation will reveal how much damaging the proposed measures are to nearly destroy our automobile history in one go. Hence, owners, enthusiasts and well-wishers of the targeted 15-49 year old motor vehicles need to positively send representations within 30 days w.e.f. 15.03.2021 i.e. by 13.04.2021, the date of issue of the draft notification no. G.S.R. 191 (E) to comments-morth@gov.in, their designated email id for the purpose. Confirmation copy can be also sent to director-morth@gov.in, the Director (MVL). MVL stands for Motor Vehicle Legislation.\n\nA draft is appended herewith which may please be edited according to your choice. But please positively send as many representations for the cause. Reading through, the potential damage it is capable of can be well fathomed. Read with the Scrapping Policy, the combination of the two in unison is lethal for the well-being of our poor old automobiles.\n\n**Draft**\n\nTo\n\nThe Joint Secretary (MVL)\n\nUnion Road Transport and Highways Ministry,\n\nNew Delhi 110 001\n\nDated ...\n\n\nSubject:- Objections and suggestions with regard to Re-registration Fee Hikes and Vehicle Scrapping Policy\n\nReference:- Your Draft Notification no. G.S.R. 191 (E) dated 15.03.2021 read with the Scrapping Policy\n\nSir/Mam,\n\nThis is to register my objections and suggestions with regard to the above draft notification for re-registration and fitness fee hikes in respect of 15-49 year old private motor vehicles, under the non-transport category.\n\nSection A - THE PROPOSED FEE HIKES\n\n(1) The proposed fee hikes listed under para 3 (ii) Sr. No. 4 pages 5 and 6 TABLE in respect of renewal of registrations for private/ non-transport motor cycles as in Sr No. 4(b) (Rs 1000=00) , as in Sr No. 4 (c) three-wheelers (Rs 2500=00) , as in Sr No. 4 (d) light motor vehicle (car/jeep) Rs 5000=00 and as in Sr 4 (g) also those for imported motor cycles (Rs 10,000=00) , as in Sr No. 4 (h) imported light motor vehicles (Rs 40,000=00) and as in Sr. No. 4 (i) for any vehicle not mentioned above (Rs 6000=00) are extremely high, inequitable, irrational, unreasonable and not at all commensurate with the services provided or for the enhancement in the existing services provided by the concerned authority.\n\nThe levy of such astronomical amounts of fees is uncalled for. You may appreciate the fact that the owners of such motor vehicles older than 15 years belong to the lower class, daily wagers, retired persons who could have bought their last vehicle before superannuating and also enthusiasts, who treasure the family owned motorcycle or car, sometimes since more than one generation.\n\n(2) We have to bring to your notice that such old vehicles do not ply like regular vehicle on the road, particularly the Vintage and Classic vehicle. On the contrary, they are preserved and cherished as heritage and maintaining such vehicle by itself is very costly. At any rate, the levy of fees and taxes on such vehicles in astronomical proportion as compared to new vehicles defeat very purpose of term “Quid Pro Quo”. The Services provided by the state are not utilized by such vehicles proportional to fees levied on them and therefore, the increase in fees is contrary to the principle of quid pro quo and is rendered confiscating in nature. Such impression of confiscating fees is unconstitutional and cannot stand scrutiny of law.\n\n(3) The classification made also does not have any rational with the objective sought to be achieved. The unreasonableness in the classification is writ large from the categorization which clearly depicts that the same has been fixed without application of mind and in most unreasonable and irrational manner. Before making such classification, it would have been proper for ministry to have obtained information from experts and such exercise would have helped in making a reasonable classification or categorization. Such classification, therefore, cannot stand scrutiny of law.\n\n(4) The additional fees referred to in the draft notification in para 3(ii) Sr. No. 4 in the contents of Note 2 : on page 6 states:-\n\n“case of delay in applying for renewal of certificate of registration , an additional fee of three hundred rupees for delay of every month or part thereof in respect of motorcycles and five hundred rupees for delay of every month or part thereof in respect of other classes of non-transport vehicles shall be levied.”\n\nIt is brought to your notice that referring to your additional fees proposed to be levied vide notification no. GSR 1183 (E) dated 29.12.2016,the Hon’ble Madras High Court in W.P. nos 1598, 1067, 2117, 3519 and 4939 and five other W.M.P.’s of 2017 on 03.04.2017, ruled that :-\n\n“We fail to see any justification for the levy of an additional fee in the nature of the penalty when there is no change in the nature of service rendered by the authority under the Act particularly in the absence of any statutory backing for the same. The purpose, as is apparent from the recommendation of the committee is the fond hope that such levy would act as a deterrent for non-compliance of various provisions. Such non compliance is however, a matter to be addressed using such powers as have been extended to the authorities. The Motor Vehicles Act and the Central Motor Vehicles Rules at present, only contain a provision authorizing the levy of a fee and nothing more.”\n\nThe proposed additional fees are irrational, inequitable and illegal and beyond your jurisdiction. This could be out of reach for many classes of persons owning such 15-49 year old vehicles as already stated in para (1) above.\n\n(5) In para 3(iii) Sr. No. 4. page 6, the fees for conducting tests indicated in the Table at 10 A. of a vehicle for grant and renewal of certificate of fitness for such older vehicles stated in (a) (i) and (ii) for Motorcycle for manual (Rs 400=00) and automated tests (Rs 500=00) and in (b) for Three wheeled or LMV or quadri-cycle for (i) for manual (Rs 800=00) and (ii) automated (Rs 1000=00) are irrational, inequitable and unreasonable and are solely meant like other clauses to frustrate and coerce old vehicle owners to either pay huge and uncalled for enhanced fees and additional fees or surrender their otherwise fit and non-polluting vehicles under compulsion to the scrapping centres.\n\n(6) The total amounts as stated above in paras (1) and (5) inclusive of all new levies payable by old vehicle owners for fitness and re-registration thus works out to Rs 2400=00 for Indian motorcycles, Rs 11,500=00 for Imported motorcycles, Rs 13,300=00 for Indian cars and Rs 48,500=00 for Imported cars, once every five years. These amounts do not include any fines for delays. This is lawfully contrary to the principles of natural justice.\n\nSection B - THE SCRAPPING POLICY\n\nThe proposed hike in fees with levies of additional fees read with your scrapping policy indicate the link between these two documents, that are solely meant to discourage owners of older (15-49) year old privately owned vehicles from owning them by falsely and with malafide intentions labeling them as unsafe and polluting. The reality is much different. You may please note that:-\n\n(1) The Delhi and NCR ban on 10 and 15 year old diesel and petrol private cars w.e.f. 2016 has resulted in not removing pollution from the areas. In fact, the smog and AQI (air quality index) of the winters of 2019-20 and 2020-21 were the worst ever in history. Before apportioning the blame on old motor vehicles , you need to identify and penalize the other main polluters.\n\n(2) Such old vehicles are very less used on a regular basis as daily drivers. Not more than 5 to 10 % of such old vehicles are visible in any traffic jam or parking lot as you may infer through studies by accredited institutions. On the other hand replacements with newer vehicles will entail usage of five to ten times more causing more pollution and increases in oil import bills.\n\n(3) We will be eliminating a substantial part of our automobile, industrial and mechanical history. We have had automobiles with truly 100 % Indian made components and with Indian brand names like Yezdi, Bajaj, Premier, Ambassador, Vijai, Lamby, Mahindra, Allwyn, Luna, Kinetic, Badal, Sipani and more since the late 1960’s and mostly from the early 1970’s. The Ambassador and Rajdoot as brands were in vogue much earlier. The natural rates of attrition are very high presently and usually older vehicles are discarded by most owners after 10 to 15 years.\n\n(4) All developed Western countries in are encouraging preservation of 30 year or older vehicles, labeling them as Historic or as Young Timers and are valuing their worth as a part of their national wealth. Germany, U.K. and France lead the other nations here. The U.K. estimates that its 1.2 million such old vehicles to be worth 17.8 Billion pounds (Rs 167,000 crores). The US has accorded a special status to 30 year old vehicles aiming at preservation and estimates that it has about 21 million such old vehicles/cars.\n\n(5) China is among the rarest of nations that has a compulsory automobile scrapping policy. The Chinese are known for the disdain to preserve their own history. Hence, if we follow the coercive and deterring methods for owners to compel them to scrap old private vehicles, we could be emulating the Chinese model.\n\n(6) The handing over of an otherwise fit and non-polluting vehicle for scrapping by any owner should not be under duress or after being throttled, due to such high and disproportionate fees. In fact, the owner needs to hand over the vehicle to the scrap yard with a smile and with his own willingness.\nWith such a coercive and deterring levy of fees and additional fees vide the draft notification of 15.03.2021 under reference will only punish the daily wage earners, poor, lower class, lower middle class, retired persons and also automobile enthusiasts. Some among the enthusiasts are maintaining the older cars/bikes for generations in the best possible conditions, which form a part of the family heirloom. Moreover, the present state of the economy due to the pandemic has paralysed the earnings of many of the owners of such older automobiles.\n\nHence, it is to request you that the above points as listed in Sections A and B may please be sympathetically looked into and the extremely high, inequitable, irrational and unreasonable proposed hikes be done away with.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\n(Name)\n\n( City )\n\n(contact number)"<br />Author: 'Arjun_Pandit'  id: 'mjtk49'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mjtk49/representing_against_the_new_reregistration/</li>

You must understand that China has vested interest in destroying myanmar's democracy and make it a vessel state like North korea.I do believe that they want a route bypassing malacca straight which they tried with CPEC project.They realized terrorism in baluchistan and corruption in pakistan might even delay their project alot, so they tried to support myanmar coup.River flowing through myanmar connecting china is excellent for moving  goods.Russia is there to divert attention from their Ukraine crisis to myanmar.\n\nSo let's take it into India's situation.Our Northeast countrymen have deep ties culturally and ethnically with myanmar citizen.Especially mizoram with chin people on myanmar area.I might have done the same to rescue as much people as I can.But India has an Insurgency situation with Arakan army which gets it arms from China.Military junta helped us to hunt them down for an extend.Also we are trying to create [India–Myanmar–Thailand Trilateral Highway - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%E2%80%93Myanmar%E2%80%93Thailand_Trilateral_Highway) and  [Sittwe Port - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sittwe_Port) which connects north east to kolkata port .There are different forces exisitng inside myanmar other than junta and they have different desires.What ever military move we do might not get them back into democratic rule again.\n\n[List of equipment of the Myanmar Army - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_equipment_of_the_Myanmar_Army) by looking at their military weapons,small arms that can be supplied by India to help local militias won't do much.India is a democratic country and we should hold our values but the other countries involved in this coup has great [stake.](https://stake.It) It should be noted that both russia and China got veto power. You should understand that US,EU and other big guys haven't moved a finger yet other than sanctions. .India is forced into a geopolitical dilemma like happened in Srilanka  and if we interfere and support either side in myanmar will result in huge casulalities.Our current govt has taken this into account and choose to stand aside wisely!\n\nThe world is pretty bad and some problems can't be easily fixed."<br />Author: 'settayi'  id: 'mjep8c'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mjep8c/discussion_what_should_india_do_with_the_myanmar/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Parents not agreeing for marriage - help!'<br />Body: 'Hi! I am an Indian girl living in US. Me(27)and my boyfriend (27) are in a relation since 10 years. We came to US to study and we are currently working here in IT since a few years. My boyfriend is a Brahmin boy and I am from OBC caste. When my family got to know about my relation before I came to US, they were a bit hesitant but gradually they were all fine. They know him very well since my bachelors in India and they like my boyfriend and were okay to get us married. The real problem begun then when my boyfriend told about our relation to his Brahmin family.  They started to cry and emotionally black mailing him saying all sorts of things like “no one will marry your sister, we will die, these all are attractions and will never stay forever, this is a sin in our Brahmin culture and you cannot pray for elderly dead people, we may have not nurtured you and loved you properly and that is the reason you took such decision, what is the need for you to love someone when we love you so much, can’t we bring you a girl with same qualities? Why did you go and search a girl for you? Etc etc..\n\nThere is another twist to this - my boy friend’s grand father (mother’s father) is always against this idea of marrying other caste / person of children’s choice even if they are from the same caste. He believes it is a sin and it will bring wrong name to the family and relatives and their social status and religious faith. And due to some reasons, his parents are not ready to cross his words and allow our marriage. Even if my boyfriend tried to convince them and they agree to marry us in a instance, his grand father will change them and everything will come back to zero again. And they were putting his sisters marriage issue in front of him whenever he tries to convince them. They will say that her life will be spoilt because of his decision. But the truth is his sister also has a love story of same caste which his parents came to know a month ago and they were not even agreeing to that.\n\nMy parents who were trying their best to understand all this and trying to get rid of relatives who are thinking that my parents are not getting me married because of my money is driving me crazy. They have to hear all this because of my choice. They don’t know about his sisters love affair and the discussions about them and I chose not to tell them. \n\nMy parents and grand parents tried to talk to his father when my boyfriend went to India to convince them. But they didnot agree to meet my family. His  grand father is black mailing him to not so such things now.  We live together in US and I am not able to see him go through all this stress. We love each other a lot and this has been going on since 4 years and I am fed up with all this. We decided to get married here in US this year, but my boyfriend is not sure how to convey this to his family that we will get married if they didnot agree for this and  that he cannot endure this pain anymore. He is afraid that his parents will also emotionally black Mail him that they will die if he does such a thing. \n\nAlso, I feel like they wanted to drag this as long as my parents will get me married to someone else as girls parents will want to get their daughter married sooner. \n\nI know the story is long. But please give your suggestions to help us get through this.

      <li>Title::: 'How to share the gospel with atheists'<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast week I sat next to James on a flight from St. Louis to Denver. As we talked the subject turned to religion. I confessed that I was a preacher and he confessed he was an atheist. What unfolded on the rest of the flight was a deep, thought-provocative gospel conversation.\n\nOver the years I’ve had the privilege of engaging many atheists like James in various settings. I’ve discovered five helpful tips when sharing the gospel with someone who says to not believe in God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Don’t be shocked and do ask tons of questions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome atheists like to shock believers with the fact that they don’t believe in God. This brand of atheist pulls the pin on the “there is no God” grenade and drops it in the middle of the conversation, expecting believers to run for cover.\n\nDon’t be phased. As a matter of fact start asking questions about their atheism. Find out what they mean by atheism (some are agnostics but call themselves atheists). Ask questions about their background.\n\nAnd remember that, as you ask questions, your goal is not to trap them but to understand them. Find out areas where you agree. Just like Paul found common ground with the athenians when he discovered an altar “to the unknown God” we can find common ground in a mutual rejection of legalistic religion and a passion for science\n\nAlthough James spoke somewhat negatively of religion he spoke well of Jesus. While he didn’t view Jesus as the Son of God he did perceive him as an enlightened soul. At the minimum that was something I could build on in making my own case for Christ.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Listen deeply for the real “why”:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes it’s anger over losing a loved one or because they were hurt by the church in some way. Sometimes there other reasons, like the fact that they are afraid of the truth, because if they embraced the truth, they would be submitted to God, and would not be free as they were before; so they prefer to embrace a lie which makes them freer. Whatever the reason, there’s always a “why” behind the lie they are embracing.\n\nJames shared with me about his upbringing in England and his regular attendance at the Church of England. He told me about how his wife had left him and how he could only see his kids every other weekend. James shared how he reads at least a book a week and how he loses himself in novels.\n\nAs he shared I couldn’t quite nail why he was an atheist but I could sense that he was a lonely man. My heart went out to him and I think he could sense my sympathy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Connect relationally:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJames and I joked together as we sparred each other. I listened to him and he listened to me. Bottom line is that I like James. He is an interesting guy with an interesting story.\n\nWe should heed Paul’s reminder to Timothy about how to deal with those who disagree with us theologically,\n\n“Don’t have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels. And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will” (2 Timothy 2:23-26).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. Atheists knew the truth:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose who claim to be atheists have known the truth (i.e. God), but have rejected it. For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. Scripture makes it clear in Romans 1:18-22:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. Claiming to be wise, they became fools" (Romans 1:18-22).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey may try to suppress their belief in God, but in the discussion, atheists might say something like, “Well if God is so good then why does he allow…” This is the point in the conversation where they have “forgotten” their atheism and revealed some of their doubts. You can be sure that, the gospel is churning in the soul of the atheist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. Frame the gospel as a love story (that just happens to be true):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I shared the gospel with James I wasn’t trying to prove God’s existence, I was simply sharing the story of God’s love. I said something like, “James, at the core of Christianity is a love story. Jesus put it this way, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son that whoever believes in him will not perish but has everlasting life" (John 3:16).\n\nI could tell that James was intrigued by this view. He listened respectfully and asked thoughtful questions.\n\nYes, I dipped into some apologetics at this point (C.S. Lewis’ Lord, lunatic or liar argument, teleological argument, etc.) but only after I had framed the gospel as a love story. In the words of my friend Bill Jack, too many times too many believers use apologetics as a sledge hammer instead of a crowbar to pry open closed minds.\n\nJames and I had a respectful conversation where I heard him and he heard the good news of Jesus. My job is not to lead him to Jesus but to “set forth the truth plainly” and let the Spirit of God continues his work.\n\nJames didn’t say the sinner’s prayer when the plane pulled up to the gate after landing. But I believe that somewhere between Denver and St. Louis the Spirit of God nudged him closer to Jesus. It is my prayer that he will cross the line of faith and receive Jesus as his Savior.'<br />Author: 'BibleSharer'  id: 'mhfoje'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mhfoje/how_to_share_the_gospel_with_atheists/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Diversity of Civilizations - Good or Bad'<br />Body: ' **Estimated reading time:** 3 minutes, 29 seconds. Contains 697 words \n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Diversity of Civilizations - Overview\n\nThe distinctiveness of the cultural and spiritual matrix of dharma civilizations is under siege from something insidious: the widespread dismantling, rearrangement, and digestion of dharmic culture into Western frameworks, by disingenuously characterizing the latter as ‘universal’.\n\nThis process of absorption of dharmic ideas can take place with good intentions and also with the tacit cooperation of individuals immersed in dharma. They sometimes question:\n\n* Why not assimilate?\n* Aren’t we all really ‘the same’?\n* What is incorrect about a ‘universal’ point of view?\n* Isn’t the large-scale absorption of Indian ideas, arts, sciences, medicine, business practices and letters something positive?\n* Isn’t it wonderful that millions of Americans and Europeans practice and propagate yoga and that Indian cuisine has gone global?\n* Besides, doesn’t the West have something to offer India in exchange – such as scientific advances, social justice, business and political know-how?\n* *The obvious answer to all these questions* ***would at first be a ‘Yes’.*** *Yet, much of what appears to be an explicit Indian influence on the West is indicative of a process that threatens to deplete the very sources of dharma on which it draws.*\n\n# Talk of global culture and universalism often creates the sunny impression that the fusion of dharmic and Western cultures is always good.\n\n* **This assumption ignores the many distortions and unacknowledged appropriations on the part of the West**, as well as the highly destructive influences of fundamentalist Christianity, Marxism, capitalist expansionism and myopic secularism.\n* **Global culture is bridging and blurring boundaries across races, ethnicities, nationalities and faiths.** Consumerism is redefining lifestyles and aesthetics by blending universal components. The increased mobility of people, goods and capital is more likely taking us closer to a world of true meritocracy (a phenomenon that Pulitzer Prize winner, Thomas Friedman calls the ‘flat world’), and economic and ecological integration is helping dismantle localized obstacles.\n* **The youth is especially quick to embrace new kinds of global identities, often at the expense of native traditions**. At the same time, an appreciation of the exotic, colorful and novel aspects of Indian culture appear to be on the rise, owing to the influence of Yoga, Indian cuisine, the film industry, traditional music and dance, and so on. Indian spiritual capital enjoys a pride of place in the global quest for greater well-being, as evidenced by the popularity of Yoga, meditation and Ayurvedic medicine in various forms and by the influence wielded by certain self-help guru-s in popular culture.\n\n# Several prominent critics have blamed religious, cultural, racial and national divisions for much of the violence and fragmentation that are destabilizing the world today.\n\n* **They argue that all such distinctions are obsolete and primitive.** The arguments that distinct cultures should coalesce into something universal are expressed in theories that perceive ideal societies as ‘post-modern’, ‘post-racial’, ‘post-religious’ and ‘post-nationalistic’.\n* **When all collective identities are discarded and all boundaries challenged – whether under the rubric of post-modern critique or as a result of a vague sense that ‘all are one’ and ‘we are all fundamentally the same’** – the result is not a world free from dominance but one in which the strongest identities along with their versions of history and values prevail.\n\n# Weak cultures and civilizations will end up getting digested and rendered irrelevant in the face of this hegemonic march of history. \n\n**The Indian situation in the clash of civilizations is indeed disheartening. T**he Indian state was weakened to a deep state of atrophy after close to one thousand years of colonial rule and became further diluted after independence in 1947 by way of poor policies and inefficient and corrupt governing structures.\n\n**It is only recently, after seventy-odd years, that the need and relevance of a truthful civilizational narrative as the basis for nation-building is being considered at the highest levels of governance.** Steps, however small, are being taken to build a foundation for an India based on India’s self-narratives and its civilizational riches.\n\n**The economic prosperity over the last few decades, and the marked absence of crippling poverty has, for the most part, freed Indians to think beyond survival and mere economic progress** to take control of the civilizational narrative and regain the authority to interpret the world on their own terms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources: Sanskrit Non-Translatables - Rajiv Malhotra'<br />Author: 'xsupermoo'  id: 'mh5twc'<br />Score:30<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mh5twc/diversity_of_civilizations_good_or_bad/</li>

R. R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth is full of fortified citadels and imposing fortresses. Hundreds of years ago, a region in the central Himalayas might have resembled Tolkien’s fictional realm.\n\nNagendra Rawat at Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University in Srinagar, India, and his colleagues analysed the distribution of the remnants of 193 medieval strongholds in northern India. The researchers identified at least 12 clusters of forts. In each cluster, the forts were located 15–25 kilometres from one another — distances over which fire and smoke signals would be visible.\n\nMost fortified sites were built on ridges or hilltops, and some would have been visible from several other forts. These ‘hubs’ could have served to relay information about enemy incursions or other events to a large number of nearby sites.\n\nEach network of strongholds could represent either a state within the Katyuri kingdom, which controlled the region from the eighth to the twelfth century, or an independent chiefdom from the eleventh century. The visually linked forts might have facilitated the region’s fifteenth-century unification, the authors say.\nFrom [Nature]( https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00685-w)\n[Archive Link](https://archive.is/RNRzt)\n\n[Original Paper](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/abs/networked-medieval-strongholds-in-garhwal-himalaya-india/76B854F10803EF29AB100662DB016819) (needs subscription)'<br />Author: 'dhatura'  id: 'mghv8a'<br />Score:57<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mghv8a/researchers_have_identified_193_medieval_forts_in/</li>

We need to get as much Indian population vaccinated as possible before we send off the "excess" vaccine to other countries. But what is the criteria to define "excess"? \nVaccination at such a large scale requires not only sufficient and trained personnel but also proper procedure (follow-ups for any side effects, keeping those vaccinated in observation, the works). The same pool of medical professionals are engaged in covid duty as well. It also requires proper inventory management. Safe transportation while maintaining the temperature is challenging. Additionally, the shelf life of the vaccines available in India is about 6 months. \nIn toto, there\'s only so much vaccines Indian hospitals can safely give provided the infrastructural and personnel constraints. Even if we manage to manufacture enough vaccines for the entire population, vaccination drive will take more time and most of those vaccine vials will get expired even before we can use them. \nOn the other hand, those "excess" vaccines can better be used to save lives in other countries to which India is exporting as a grant/gift or commercially. This is not only building India\'s soft power and credibility but also helping in bringing some investment in the pharmaceutical industry. \nAnd the added advantage, India is building a strong case for compulsory licensing of life saving drugs under TRIPs (WTO). \nThe only concern is that if the experts in the government/bureaucracy are able to safely determine this "excess" with the help of the vaccine manufacturers.'<br />Author: 'Akhil0110'  id: 'mgffmb'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mgffmb/thoughts_on_vaccine_diplomacy_gift_from_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Buying ELSS from PaytmMoney'<br />Body: "Please bear with me as I'm not the most prudent investor. As this was the first year where I'd have any tax liabilities, I decided to invest 1.5 lakhs claimable under 80C into some ELSS via PaytmMoney on 26th March 2020 at about 12.30 pm. I was under the impression that I'll get the same day's NAV, but it didn't happen and the transaction was stuck in progress (it says that the money has been forwarded to the AMC and PaytmMoney is waiting for confirmation from the AMC), and as the next few days were holidays, the status stayed the same. However, it should've changed today (30/03/2020), but it's still the same. To check if there's a problem with PaytmMoney, I invested Rs.500 in the same fund on Kuvera at about 12.00pm today, and its status too is in progress.\n\nI'm really concerned whether I'll get this year's NAV. How long does it typically take for the NAVs to reflect in your account on PaytmMoney or Kuvera? Is there some delay due to it being close to the end of financial year? Do you think it's possible to get this year's NAVs? And if yes, then how long would it take for the NAVs to reflect in my account? If it's not possible to get NAVs for this year then I'll probably buy NSC from post office tomorrow, but I really need to make a decision today. How long do you think I should wait before abandoning any hope of getting NAVs this year and pursue another route?\n\nSome background: On PaytmMoney I invested in a couple of ELSS (DSP, Axis, Mirae, FT, Kotak), and on Kuvera I invested in Mirae. I used UPI and Netbanking for these transactions and the banks from which payments were made are SBI and HDFC. I have read the various circulars, and it seems I should've gotten same day's NAVs due to my payment methods.\n\nSorry if it sounds dumb. I'll try to be more careful about my investments from the next year. I'll probably start a SIP. But right now I really need your help to figure out how long I should wait for the NAVs to be allotted."<br />Author: 'chodbahadur2'  id: 'mgczul'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mgczul/buying_elss_from_paytmmoney/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'India’s high import duties are killing MSMEs'<br />Body: '[https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/india-s-high-import-duties-are-killing-msmes-1783664-2021-03-25](https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/india-s-high-import-duties-are-killing-msmes-1783664-2021-03-25)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nAnil Bhardwaj, secretary general of the Federation of Indian Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, an organisation with hundreds of members from the MSME (medium, small and micro enterprises) sector says India’s increased import duties have made the industry highly uncompetitive. “We have a mindset that exports are good, imports are bad. But in a globalised world, it is the reverse. If we make steel expensive by increasing import duties, then all the sectors \\[that use steel as an input\\], such as engineering goods and auto component become unable to compete globally.”\n\nIn 2017, the government of India raised import duties on a slew of products from footwear and mobile phones to motor vehicles and others. At the time, it said that the increase in import duties was not a revenue-raising measure, but a move to nurture the Make in India campaign to boost domestic manufacturing. Even so, over the years, there has been a consistent rise in import duties across key raw materials such as steel, copper, polymers and aluminium amongst others. However, this protectionism has not built the MSME sector into a force to reckoned with. In fact, the increase in import duties has benefitted about 20 big companies, who have, in turn, increased the prices of the raw materials they produce, hurting the competitiveness of the MSME sector. “Under the garb of Make in India, companies with lobbying power have benefitted the most,” alleges Bhardwaj.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Arvind Panagariya, former vice chairman of the Niti Aayog and a professor of economics at Columbia University, one of the most vociferous critics of increasing protectionism, explains that when import duties are increased, it incentivises the manufacture of a set of products, not production in general. The reason that certain products are imported is that domestic manufacturers are not good at producing those products to begin with. When tariffs are reduced, efficient suppliers come into the market, displacing less efficient producers. “When I liberalise, I displace less efficient producers—but I am more efficient in my exports than my foreign counterparts in sectors where my country is efficient.”**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Trade restrictions are a model that India has been following for at least the past three years. Some economists say that this time period is not long enough to gauge the results of import protectionism. Others point out that the duty revisions have been ad-hoc, with no clear long-term plan being articulated by the government. There has been a lot of apprehension within the Indian industry about how to read into the import duty revisions—were they one-off moves, whether there would be continuity in these policies. The clearer the government makes its intent, the more confidence Indian manufacturers will have in setting up production facilities in sectors that are being protected with import tariffs.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Panagariya presented a paper at the Exim Bank Commencement Day lecture in which he stated that India is turning protectionist and has been raising import tariffs since 2014, imposing more anti-dumping duties than any other country and weakening domestic companies by insulating them from competition. In his analysis of the Indian experience of nurturing the electronics industry via import substitution, he stated that “imports of electronic goods have gone up from $32.4 billion in 2013-14 to $55.6 billion in 2018-19, while exports inched up from $7.6 billion to $8.9 billion over the same period.” He added: “Predictably, protected and subsidised, several mobile phone assembly firms have come up during these years, but they have not added up to a vibrant electronics industry. Nearly all locally owned firms are small by global standards with none that is about to turn into an export powerhouse.”**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Panagariya’s key point in the paper is that India’s best growth years were from 2003-2014 when India had low import tariffs. Import substitution could be one of the interventions for making ‘ Make in India’ a success but making Indian industry competitive by cutting red tape and simplifying myriad regulations is the key to unleashing India’s manufacturing potential.**'<br />Author: 'itisverynice'  id: 'mfv20t'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mfv20t/indias_high_import_duties_are_killing_msmes/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Under Modi govt, Indian bureaucracy is facing biggest shakeup in seven decades'<br />Body: '[https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/politics/under-modi-govt-indian-bureaucracy-is-facing-biggest-shakeup-in-seven-decades-6703321.html](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/politics/under-modi-govt-indian-bureaucracy-is-facing-biggest-shakeup-in-seven-decades-6703321.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nThe higher Indian bureaucracy is being put to the litmus test like never before—and there are many who are flunking the scrutiny.\n\nThe test is being conducted at two levels; one, many senior officers—\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# nearly 400—deemed incompetent or corrupt, have been sacked or superannuated compulsorily and prematurely in the last few years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pulling no punches when it comes to taking on the country’s elite Indian Administrative Service (IAS). In a move that can be regarded as unprecedented, he told the Parliament last month: “Babus will do everything. By dint of becoming IAS officers, they’ll operate fertiliser warehouses and chemical warehouses, even fly airplanes. What is this big power we have created? What are we going to achieve by handing the reins of the nation to\xa0babus? Our\xa0babus\xa0are also citizens, and so are the youth of India.”\n\n**Public Criticism**\n\nThe Prime Minister’s emphatic public denouncement of the IAS has surprised and shocked many in equal measure. Surprised, because the Modi model of governance has involved heavy reliance on IAS officers, both earlier when he was Chief Minister Gujarat and now as Prime Minister, often even at the\xa0expense of his ministers.\xa0Shocked, because while politicians have in the past derided bureaucrats individually, a collective assault of this nature and that too on the floor of the House, is nothing less than groundbreaking.\n\nOfficers of doubtful integrity and conduct, those that have faced vigilance and corruption charges, or others whose work has not been found up to the mark or are of dubious conduct, have always had the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. The difference now is that the sword is not merely hanging, **it is also severing heads.**\n\n# Last year, the central government instructed all ministries and departments to maintain a register of government servants in the 50-55 year age bracket, and those who have completed 30 years in service, as it plans to weed out the ‘corrupt’ and `inefficient officials.\n\nAccording to an order issued by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT)—which comes directly under the Prime Minister’ Office (PMO)—all ministries and government departments now have to conduct a quarterly review of the officials, in order to ascertain who among them need to be prematurely retired from service.\n\n**A Series of Long-Pending Reforms**\n\nThe steel frame, the once invincible government service, which assured job security like few employment opportunities in the world, is a lot more fallible now.\n\nIn the last few years, virtually hundreds of Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Revenue Service (IRS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and other central services officers have been compulsorily or prematurely retired.\n\nThe government rules are clear. It is armed with\xa0FR 56 (j),\xa0read together with Rule 48 of Pension Rules, which deals with premature retirement of senior officers. According to it, the appropriate authority, in the public interest has ‘the absolute right to retire any government servant’ with three months’ notice, after one has attained the age of 50/55 years or completed 30 years of qualifying service, whichever is earlier.\n\nThe corresponding pension rule stipulates that the officer, so retired in the public interest, will be entitled to pension based on his qualifying service.\n\n**To get a sense of what is happening, it would be instructive to turn to a few numbers and events.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* *On March 17, 2021, the Ministry of Home Affairs ordered three Indian Police Service (IPS) officers of the Uttar Pradesh cadre to be retired prematurely in ‘public interest’ after their services were found to be “unsuitable to continue working as a public servant”.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* *In 2019, 50 Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officers were compulsorily retired.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* *In 2019, 284 officers from the Central Secretariat Service (CSS) were considered for compulsory retirement on account of alleged corruption or inefficiency. The list included officers posted across ministries such as defence (19), home affairs (18), finance (18), and health (22), among others.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* *in 2017, DoPT said it has taken actions like premature retirement, cut in remuneration against 381 bureaucrats, including 24 IAS officers for non-performance.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* *Between May 2014 and May 2019, sanction for prosecution under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, was granted against 23 IAS and four IPS officers, according to Union Minister Jitendra Singh.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* *In 2019, the government\xa0compulsorily retired\xa0over 50 IRS officials accused of corruption and sexual harassment, among other charges.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is the story here? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is little doubt that the Indian bureaucracy is amid its biggest churn of the last seven decades. A push for the lateral entry of domain experts, forced retirement of officers in bulk, concerted attempts to break the stranglehold of the IAS, experiments with the time-tested recruitment rules of civil servants, have evoked applause and invited brickbats, by the serving and the superannuated, in equal measure.\n\nSays former Union Secretary Anil Swarup: “Well, the rules provide for such removals, so to that extent they are in order. If the idea is to cleanse the system, then it is a laudable step, but there are many who doubt the intentions of this government.”\n\nA lot of this has to do with perception—the commonly held view among the masses, who often deal with the lower echelons of bureaucracy—is that government servants are not just corrupt but incompetent.\n\nSays Amitabha Bhattacharya, a former IAS officer, who has also served in the private\xa0sector and with the UNDP: “Public perception about pervasive corruption, more so in certain departments, particularly at the level of public-interface and at the highest decision-making level, is real. The fact about large-scale inefficiency — mostly at the middle and lower level of bureaucracy stares in our face.”\n\nHe believes that if pursued objectively and methodically, measures that the Modi government has taken will have a sobering effect on the bureaucracy and a beneficial impact on public administration at large.\n\n“in cases of premature retirement, there is always a possibility of subjectivity creeping in. Therefore, the review process must be so robust and transparent as to be in a position to stand sustained legal scrutiny,” says Bhattacharya.\n\nThe key point is, has it?\n\nIt is necessary to understand the systemic architecture to deal with inefficiency and corruption in public service. The limiting conditions of government servants are largely defined by the Fundamental Rules (FR), Conduct Rules, and CCA (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, which came into force decades ago but are amended from time to time.\n\nThe ubiquitous Annual Confidential Report/Performance Assessment Report intends to give a picture of an officer’s performance and integrity, as assessed by their superiors.\n\nBesides these, there are specific Acts like the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA) and the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, to deal with such issues.\n\n**Let’s Talk About Results**\n\nNevertheless, there is not much evidence that corruption is declining or inefficiency receding.\n\nThat the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is clear about what it is doing, is in no doubt. In its election manifesto released before the 2019 general elections, the party stated: “To transform India into a developed nation, we need to work with the guiding principle of ‘minimum government and maximum governance’ and we will bring reform in the civil services and implement it in a manner to achieve.”\n\nFrom the ramparts of the Red Fort in 2019, Modi stressed the importance of the anti-graft drive against officials. “You must have seen, in the last five years, and this time after coming to power, we have dismissed several people who enjoyed cushy positions in the government,” he said, adding for good effect, \\`\\`Those who used to be roadblocks in our endeavours (to eradicate corruption), we told them to pack their bags (because) the country doesn’t need (their) services.”\n\nSays a former IAS officer, Vijay Shankar Pandey: “Action against corrupt and inefficient senior officers under FR 56 (j), is not new. I have done it several times in my career. But if you say it is to streamline governance, then I will not agree. In the past, services of many incompetent and corrupt officers have been terminated, but that has hardly brought about efficiency and high standards in governance.”\n\nPandey is critical of the Prime Minister’s attack on the\xa0*\\`babus.’*\xa0\\`\\`If you did not have the\xa0*babus*, it would be difficult to implement Article 370. Within a moment of it being scrapped, every District Magistrate and Superintendent of Police in Jammu and Kashmir was enforcing it with gusto. Minus the civil bureaucracy, could such a move have been possible,” he queries.\n\nHe says it is easy to criticise, but not a single creative line has been said on what should replace the IAS and the civil bureaucracy.\n\n***There are other ways, which are threatening to clip the powers of the all-powerful civil bureaucracy. In 2018, a small advertisement in some newspapers sent shock waves in the hallowed portals of the bureaucracy.***\n\n***The advertisement, which called for 10 lateral entries into the central government, were not new by any chance. It is an old P Chidambaram plan that goes back to the 1980s. Of 450 posts of joint secretary in the central government, 10 were being opened for laterally hiring domain experts.***\n\nWrote Amitabh Kant, CEO of the NITI Aayog: “Civil servants together with fresh inputs from lateral entrants can provide synergies to policy and implementation like never before. The role of civil servants becomes even more vital since for lateral inductions to get immersed in the government, the system will entail a steep learning curve.”\n\n**Reforms, Meet Resistance**\n\nClearly, the decision has put question marks on a generalist’s approach to administration and has highlighted the need for domain knowledge experts, given the demands of a growing economy and the need to quicken decision making.\n\nSays a serving officer, tartly: \\`\\`It is not as if the lateral entrants into the bureaucracy know how to fly planes,” referring to the Prime Minister’s Parliament speech. He did not want to be named.\n\nFor some officers, the government’s actions have been disagreeable enough for some IAS officers to leave the service altogether.\n\nIn July 2019, former finance secretary Subhash Garg offered to quit from the government after he was abruptly shunted out of the finance ministry.\n\nSoon enough, three relatively junior officers left the service arguing that democratic principles were being compromised under the Modi government — an unprecedented statement from serving officers of the IAS. Incredibly, two of them cited \\`ideological’ reasons for the decision, while a third left for having been posted to the Northeast.\n\nDays later, Karnataka cadre officer S. Sasikanth Senthil resigned from the IAS arguing that it was \\`unethical’ to be an IAS officer when the \\`fundamental building blocks of diverse democracy are being compromised’.'<br />Author: 'itisverynice'  id: 'mfuxzm'<br />Score:77<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mfuxzm/under_modi_govt_indian_bureaucracy_is_facing/</li>

      <li>Title::: "India's biggest problem is it's Agricultural Industry and Farmer Voting Block"<br />Body: 'I know this post will be controversial, but it\'s meant to be. I\'m ethnically half Indian, but I spent my life growing up in the West; I am a doctoral student and I am greatly interested in the development of India as a nation.  \n\n\nBut one thing I\'ve observed is that a lot of Indians don\'t actually understand its biggest problem, atleast with regards to governmental policy and long term economic growth.  \n\n\nIndia\'s long term economic growth, as of right now is strongly impacted by three things, and it is these three things that will continue to hinder it\'s future economic growth unless Modi undemocratically takes control of the nation and uses voter suppression and religious politics to ensure he can pass the necessary reforms - I know what I\'m saying is not popular, but it is *necessary*.  \n\n\nIndia\'s three main problems arise from:  \n1. [India has outdated codes on land acquisition and eminent domain which overtly privilege rural landowners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_acquisition_in_India) and they **impede urbanization.** These were explicitly set up with regards to the "rights of farmers". These laws privilege states over the central government and massively inflate costs for important national infrastructure projects such as expressways, high speed rail and increased freight capacity. \n\nFarmers have lobbied for them and vote en masse to ensure state governments negotiate for sale of their land (via eminent domain) at inflated prices or don\'t sell their land at all - holding to perpetually increase the value of their unearned investment. This ends up stalling and killing important infrastructural investments, such as the Salem expressway in Tamil Nadu, the Mumbai Ahmedabad bullet train, and is the largest impediment to increasing India\'s national expressway infrastructure - an investment that has the highest economic multiplier.  \n\n\n2) The Indian Central government and Indian States governments disproportionately favor rural subsidies to farmers, their income support and other such subsidies that massively shifts resources away from productive endeavors. Not only this, it causes maligned incentives which discourages urbanization, encourages higher fertility rates (among farmers), and supports an industry that is not necessary. [As much as 30-40% of union and state budgets in India are dedicated to agriculture, in countries like China its less than 3%, in the US its less than 1% of total government spending.](https://prsindia.org/budgets/states)   \n\n\nNot only this, this directs important resources that should be used for urban infrastructural development, solid waste disposal, road paving, expressway construction, metro expansion, bullet train construction, freight rail procurement, energy generation and various other development friendly and economic investments away to a WASTE OF MONEY into a negative valued social program. The only benefit this even has is in lowering food price inflation, and that too at marginally negligible rates to total economic growth.   \n\n\nUnlike South East Asian countries (which are less Democratic than India) which actually invest massively in infrastructure; the only Indian states that seem to ironically invest in infrastructure close to necessary levels are either urbanized states like Gujarat or "corrupt" states wherein the BJP uses "religious tensions" to override farmers short term economic self interest.  \n\n\nIndia\'s farmers as a voting block continue to support this ***parasitic policy*** that delivers them short term benefits whilst dooming even their own selves and children\'s selves in the longer run. \n\n3) India\'s democratic system privileges state government\'s over local governments which prevents the growth of cities upwards and outwards, as state government\'s control much more revenues than cities; as a result, money that should go to making Mumbai and Bangalore better is instead spent on welfare programs that are unnecessary in india\'s present state. India should instead encourage education and urbanization as a way to lower TFR, not to waste vital resources on rural health, irrigation and development programs that have a marginally lower impact on TFR. Studies have repeatedly shown it\'s urbanization that targets fertility rates, not "rural development", which is much more resource intensive.  \n\n\n***In short, India\'s woes arise from Democracy, which is it\'s biggest problem***. ***Corruption, unironically, is the solution***. Corruption will free the Indian government to cater to business interests, which are much more aligned to long term economic growth than short term interests of the population; *imagine Tata or Ambani controlled India, or a farmer from Karnataka or Bihar, who would you prefer?*'<br />Author: 'Commercial_Put_3660'  id: 'mfspcp'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mfspcp/indias_biggest_problem_is_its_agricultural/</li>

Take it with a grain of  anecdotal salt and dont crucify me. \n\nIn India - \n\n- non religious tambrahms in TN have been dicks to me. traditional ones are either avoidant or extremely considerate plus trust worthy, westernized returnees even better. Exposure better? \n\n- apolitical urduwoodified North indians and East Indians have been dicks to me except the right wing ones or the liberal westernized returnees of pre woke era. When I say north I only mean BIMAU and exclude pahadi mountains, Rajasthan, northeasterners and western coastline. Bengali ones are fucking cowardly sleazy and snobbish even if they have returned from the west and even while in the west. Bangladeshi or Assami hindus are okay. Hope Modi delivers a vaccine to them.\n\nThey are much better to dark christians, muslims who speak hindi urdu unlike md and my lighter taller hindu cousins. Dark lower caste north Indians are worse but just dont use kalu slurs on me.\n\n-North Indians (haryana, Up, punjuab delhi) are quick to jump fists but very forgiving unlike south indians who dont confront but avoid adversaries passive aggressively forever if done . Northeasterners are polite when in mainland, but brutal if I go to their place and am not christian. \n\n- dark Tamils and telugu especially the low caste christian converts have been dicks while they lecher over my lighter skinned  female cousins. \n\n- Kerala christians who are light skinned mostly orthodox have been nicer to me than the hindus who I find are snarky, lazy and sarcastic crabs in the well especially if they are or were communist leaning regardless of their tone or caste. No postive experience with the dark skin latins. Cant trust either when it comes to business partnerships based on alignment ( not competence). Whereas for hindus or muslims alignment is alright but not the competence. \n\n-Positive takes on mangalorean catholics, karnataka or marathi hindus and most goan ones of both religions or any politics are okay if they are not . \n\n- Muslims (including moppilas), intial extrafriendliness but betrayal if not subordinated later on disagreement. Literal trap. Applies to BOTH religious and westernized with latter being more cunning. Gulf or overseas returnees are more islamist even though they are treated like dogshit by arabs. Aggressiveness and Condescension like North indians but on a collective basis without the forgiving nature. \n\nExceptions are rich shia trading folk,  those from kargil region, apostates and westernized apolitical muslim girls. \n\n- Very very postive experience with pahadis in india and West both genders, beats even canadians in Canada. If I were to return to India, Id pick pahadi or southwestern ghats to settle. \n\nIn west-.\n\n- Woke SJWs are horrible in person, much worse than supposedly racist southern rural trump supporters. Wokes give protection only to brown women not us men. 2nd gen included, as they give off snobbish superiority vibes especially the self hating women. Whites are much friendlier especially the rural ones. Those from industrial run down towns are the worst not the country boys or girls. White feminist SJW men are sleazeball up to black latino muslim voting blocks but are condescending to asian or hindu men. \n\n- Blacks, good on a personal basis as long as you are in higher ed professional setting not near ghetto or woke poltical crowd. Christian immigrants from africa carribean are good as long as they are more into church music over rap gangsta wannabes. Non somali eastern africans are extremely understanding to us. Muslim blacks dont like us unless we are Muslim. \n\n- Latin plus southern Europeans extra extra friendly, more ambitious and family minded than whites. Beautiful warm. Women. But unlike whites or jews, not sure if sentiment remains upon disagreements. I would have want to settle in southern europe or safer parts of latam if not India. Gangsta dirt poor ones not included. \n\n- Asian men, get along the most with them more than other Indians. Especially, the south east Asian ones (indonesian muslims hands up, Malaysian ones as worse as bangladeshi ones). Sinhalabuddhist catholics treated me better than SL tamils (Christians were bad) . 2nd gen koreans are less racist than fob koreans. \n\nNon japanese Asian women? More racist against us than Nazis, unless they are too ugly to be a sellout to white men, EXCEPT vietnamese fobs or half-thai ones. \n\n- Surprise exception: francophone muslim women  levantine or North african ones and ex soviet central asian muslim women are very truly liberal in terms of sexuality and european values moreso than fake indian islamophobia accusing feminists. For these women, sexual competition from liberal french or Russian women stealing their men makes them one up on it to play catch up. \n\n- The best indicator of how women treat you or how attractive other women are as competition thats why you see  fat ugly feminists pro islamists wanting to cover up bikini supermodels in burkas out of jealousy.\n\n- Eastern europeans are ill mannered and crass but they are the same to each other not just us. Neutral to positive opinions on other Europeans. Irish and Scots are friendly while English run policy by money over values unlike the French. \n\n- Very positive experience with Jews as Indian but noticed they are more insular to non asians prolly cause of bad history. \n\n- Dutch are direct to the point and best folks to do business with. Afrikaaner are as brave as non-london british and not as racist as they are accused to be. \n\n- young gen gaming adict hollywood junkies arent refined and lazy entitled brats unlike those born before 1985, same in india\n\nWill add more soon. \n\nPatterns I notice gets you treated better-\n\nLooks! Light skinned Indians who look italian or like tall athletic blacks get treated much better by everyone, especially the girls. If you are dark male you would do much better in west than in india. \n\nThose who look distinctively skinny fat or skinny short dark Indian with the pedostache and bad dress sense and accent will be bullied by the blacks muslims and avoided by the asians or whites or  2nd gen desi\n\nMoney! Stick yourself to professional crowds you will be respected but not on political and casual sphere. \n\nGangsters. There is a reason why world is going RW, being betabux bank account is not respected inhigh tax regimes even by gold digging women. Thats why you see 2nd gen kids of even doctors playing pretend gangsta let alone mirpuri or khalistani blue collar ones - those tantrums work with loose white women there. \n\n\nDo you resonate?

      <li>Title::: 'Civil Disobedience and Making your voice heard'<br />Body: 'This is in continuation of [my previous post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/mevy8x/civil_disobedience_and_hindu_festivities/). The theme is slightly different and is OC so request the mod to not remove.\n\nThere are a number of books that one can read to cause the kind of civil unrest witnessed during Shaheen Bagh and Farmer protests. But this is abhorrent for the common citizenry (like you and me) and silent candle marches are just a trope now. So, let me share a few ideas which are peaceful, follow social distancing, and can send a loud message to the concerned parties. *Inspired slightly by Munnabhai MBBS.*\n\nHere are ways to celebrate and make your voice heard:\n\n1. Play loud festive music. If it is aarti or devotional music, all the better. The chance of offending the neighbours is lesser.\n2. Remember the request Modiji made about an year ago about banging pots and pans. Please follow his instructions again. Call people in your neighbourhood and organize it at a particular time and videotape the clangs echoing in the neighbourhood. Send to local media channels with a short message like "Holi ki pawri ho rahi hai".\n3. Take lots of photos of faces of family members with colour on them and people drenched in colours. Then tweet them out. Do not forget to tag everyone who commented about Diwali or Holi recently. Show to them that you \'appreciate\' their opinion about how to celebrate Holi.\n4. Buy Holi greeting cards and colour packets from Dharmic shops and use a Dharmic business to send it to your local MLA. Do not forget to add a personal note along the lines of "Wishing you a Happy Holi. Thanks for your immeasurable support." Members of legislature who really \'enjoy\' Hindu festivals should definitely be given special consideration.\n5. If you or your group is especially thankful to a prominent person, please buy these gifts and in person deliver it to the person. Maintain decorum, form a queue with 6 feet gap and do ring the bell to greet them. Bells are considered to be able to cleanse mind and soul. I am sure consistent doorbells will bring joy to them.\n6. While others dump animal dung in legislators houses, this is illegal and not Dharmic. Kindly consider buying garlands of flowers from a local flower shop and get it delivered. The smell of flowers after a few days do make it an especially pleasant affair. Also, you are supporting your local artisans.\n7. Such ideas have a low-cost impact on individuals, can be anonymous for the most part and can really show how you plan to support your local lawmaker in the next 5 years.\n8. These expressions of joy can also be utilized by writing a postcard to your local MLA with the content "Greetings from Indraprastha"/"Greetings from Bhagyanagar" etc. The more, the merrier. Similarly, if there is a recent display of communal harmony from a person, please do wish the person with "Get well soon" wishes govt postcard.\n9. *Kindly DO NOT take out your bike\'s silencer and annoy everyone. This is a known modus operandi of hooligans and public harassers of women. This has no place in our civil society.*\n\nBaaki all you are great at jugaad and creative thinking.'<br />Author: 'halla-nahi-hamla-bol'  id: 'mfak3i'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mfak3i/civil_disobedience_and_making_your_voice_heard/</li>

Holi symbolizes the victory Good over Bevil and Positivity over Negativity. It is the epitome of Happiness and Love and shows that Truth always prevails in the long run.\n\nThis festival always celebrated on full moon night in the month of Phalguna. This year Holi is being celebrated on 29 th March 2021. There are two Holis Badi and Choti which celebrated on two days consecutively.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k76mp5aaksp61.jpg?width=246&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd9d485f3e753f211f44523bb33763170edc67ad\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs per Hindu Mythology, This day marks the importance of Lord Vishnu's Killing Hiranyakashyapu. There was a Demon King called Hiranya Kashyap who had a son named Pralhad. Pralhad was an ardent devotee of Lord Vishnu.\n\nAs Hiranya Kashyap was a Demon King so he wanted all worshipped him, He insisted his son worship him instead of Lord Vishnu. In the feat of anger, he ordered his sister Holika to take Pralhad in her lap and sit on the pyre. Since Holika was given a mystic shawl type of cloth that would protect her from Fire. Seeing this Lord Vishnu appeared and Vishnu saved Pralhad and that mystic shawl could not save Holika. Thus Holika was burnt to death so the Holika Dahan tradition came to life.  After Vishnu took the form of Narasimha, that beast was half Human and Half Lion and killed him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother legend is associated with Holi, As all, we know that Shree Krishna was an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Everyone knows the Krishnas all '**Leelas**', Krishna was mischievous and playful but was concerned about his dark complexions and thought, Radha is extremely fair and she would not like him due to his dusky color. On complaining to mother Yashodha, mother told him to go and apply color her that made her look the same as Krishna.....This is how this festival become about smearing people with Color and Love."<br />Author: 'mohnish1983'  id: 'mf3lks'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mf3lks/holi_2021_the_festival_of_colors_and_love/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Pakistans Two Front War'<br />Body: 'One thing that really stuck with me for the last few years was a warning from Obama to Trump when Obama left the White House. Obama warned Trump that the geopolitical situation he worried about the most was the border between India and Pakistan, that the situation there could spiral way out of control very quickly and the consequences would be devastating. If you factor in the nuclear weapons both sides here process it is pretty easy to see why the stakes are so high on this one, and how any escalation in this theatre may push Pakistan into a "use them or lose them" line of thinking in the event India were to push across the border. \n\nTo take this further we put together a panel of experts to talk through this exact problem, and what it means for the region.\n\nThis week on the panel.\n\n\\- AYESHA JALAL (Tufts University)  \n\\- ADAM WEINSTEIN (Quincy Institute)  \n\\- ANDREW SMALL (German Marshall Fund)\n\nAs I see it Pakistan faces a two-front war, one against its historical rival India; and the other being internal factors that pull at the fabric of the Pakistani nation. Pakistan has many geographical advantages, but also many disadvantages. One of the major disadvantages is their reliance on the Indus river, as this river supplies the majority of the country\'s water and internal transportation. The river is the lifeblood of Pakistan, but it originates in the Kasmiri region of the Himalayas. Pakistan knows that if any more of Kasmir were to be occupied by the Indians it would put New Dehli in a position to build dams on the river tributaries and control the flow of water into Pakistan, a situation our expert from Tufts tells us would almost certainly push Pakistan into war with India. There is almost no way Pakistan could ever be comfortable with New Dehli having that much leverage over them at any point. \n\nThe geography of a war between India and Pakistan is also terrifying as well for Islamabad, as once again the situation is stacked against them. Most of Pakistans major cities like Islamabad, Karachi and Lahore are less than a few 100km from the Indian frontlines, meaning if the Indians were to pull off a massive surprise attack (although that is very difficult in today\'s satellite age) the Indian army could be approaching the outskirts of these cities in a matter of days or hours. In the case of Islamabad, India\'s starting positions are only 86km from the outskirts of the city; meaning Pakistani leadership would have little time to formulate a response to the attack. This may force them to panic and turn to tactical nuclear weapons to slow the rapid Indian advance, but once the nuclear genie is out of the bottle is it very hard to put it back in. India may fear it is only the first wave and seek to use their nuclear arms to destroys as many of Pakistan\'s missiles as they can before they can be launched. All in all, a terrifying set of circumstances. \n\nAs we so often find when we research these pieces colonial borders are often the source of internal problems, and I am not even going to get into the whole Kasmir situation. Pakistan has the Baloch people (split between Iran and Pakistan) seeking independence, and the Pashtun people (split between Afghanistan and Pakistan) both seeking independence. If the Baloch manage to pull away it would destroy much of the Chinese coastal investment that has been sunk into the country, and if the Pashtuns manage to pull away it would take a huge chunk of the Pakistani heartland with it. Pakistan tries to keep the lid on these two groups but other actors such as India seek to rile them up.  India for years has attempted to improve its relationships with Afghanistan hoping to turn them against Pakistan and form a two-front war, and on occasion they have pushed Kabul slightly in that direction. \n\nThe real game at the moment though around Pakistan is between Beijing and Washington. Washington needs Pakistan for a logistical route into Afghanistan, as well as a potential jumping-off point for operations in Iran, Central Asia or Western China. Washington is also keenly aware that if Pakistan were to crumble it would likely become a much worse hotbed for terrorism than Afghanistan ever was, and if that were to spill over into domestic upheaval that may place nuclear arms in the hands of whoever takes control.\n\nChina though wants Pakistan for two completely different reasons. The first is as a way around any possible blockade of the South China Sea, hoping that Pakistan could accept the goods China needs into its Southern ports and then transport those goods up Pakistan and into Western China, but the trouble is that road they built to achieve this actually snakes into Indian territory for a few miles; and additionally due to it being high up in the mountains it would be even easier to cut off than the South China Sea would be. The second use China has for Pakistan is a wedge against India, knowing that tensions between Islamabad and New Dehli force India to concentrate its forces toward Pakistan, rather than China. \n\nI don\'t think it would happen any time soon but in the horrifying case of a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan the likely overall winner of the situation would be China, with India having to suffer the devastation and China unscathed. \n\nI don\'t think nuclear war is "likely" between these two, but if I had to pick the area of the world it was most likely to occur in I would probably pick this one. \n\nThanks again to this sub for all of your articles and recommendations, I would love to get your thoughts on the piece and the questions below? \n\nHow likely do you think nuclear war is here? \n\nWould a trade corridor from Gwadar to Western China actually work in the event of a South China Sea Blockade? \n\nWhat would be the most like event to trigger off a war between these two, and how far into Pakistani territory do you think Indian tanks would have to get before Islamabad considered a nuclear response? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to hear the full discussion you can listen here below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAPPLE &gt;&gt; [https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/39-pakistans-two-front-war/id1482715810?i=1000513855851](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/39-pakistans-two-front-war/id1482715810?i=1000513855851)\n\nSPOTIFY &gt;&gt; [https://open.spotify.com/episode/2N6X1BN5K2teA4cHThvIZI](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2N6X1BN5K2teA4cHThvIZI)\n\nGOOGLE &gt;&gt; [https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVyZWRsaW5lLmxpYnN5bi5jb20vcnNz/episode/OGQ2YWM3N2MtN2IxYy00M2JkLWE4MTUtN2IxNjlhMmE2YmEz?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwjwr9b0otPvAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVyZWRsaW5lLmxpYnN5bi5jb20vcnNz/episode/OGQ2YWM3N2MtN2IxYy00M2JkLWE4MTUtN2IxNjlhMmE2YmEz?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwjwr9b0otPvAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ)\n\nYOUTUBE &gt;&gt; [https://youtu.be/96fJkeb6e5c](https://youtu.be/96fJkeb6e5c)\n\nWEBSITE + SUMMARY &gt;&gt; [https://www.theredlinepodcast.com/post/episode-39-pakistans-two-front-war](https://www.theredlinepodcast.com/post/episode-39-pakistans-two-front-war)'<br />Author: 'pungrypungryhippo'  id: 'mf2vsp'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mf2vsp/pakistans_two_front_war/</li>

They might as well call Kejriwal Deputy L-G from then on.\n\nAmit Shah had a hush hush meeting with Pawar in Ahmedabad at the same time when Shiv Sena spokesperson Raut has taken Anil Deshmukh to the cleaners in his latest editorial in Saamna (Shiv Sena mouthpiece) Maharashtra is a major state which has India's financial hub and BJP will leave no stone unturned to get back in power there. They have found an opening now.\n\nPinrayi Vijayan is slated to come back into power thus ending decades long alternating of power between LDF and UDF. This will be a massive embarrassment for RaGa since he has spent the bulk of his last few weeks campaigning there.\n\nSo Mamta, Kejriwal and Shiv Sena may be tamed with BJP taking over in the respective states/union territories in a matter of a few weeks. If Congress loses Kerela AND Assam in the upcoming elections , it will be a severe blow to Rahul Gandhi's credibility (or what's left of it) and there is a realistic possibility of G23 culminating into a breakout faction of Congress. \n\nWith Congress broken and Kejriwal/Mamta/Sharad Pawar tamed,  BJP is set to take over Indian politics for quite some time until a new leader emerges. This is all just speculation though, but I feel the next few weeks will decide the future of Indian politics for this decade and beyond."<br />Author: 'SwamiVivekamunun'  id: 'mez9zs'<br />Score:36<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mez9zs/opposition_mukt_bharat_on_2nd_may/</li>

Exposure to open defecation has serious consequences for child mortality, health, and human capital development. **South Asia has the highest rates of open defecation worldwide**... The **rate of open defecation in sub-national regions of Bangladesh, India and Nepal is highly correlated with the fraction of the population that identifies as Hindu**, in part because certain rituals of purity and pollution discourage having latrines in close proximity to one’s home.... this paper estimates how much the rate could be reduced if rural households in regions that have a higher fraction of Hindus, where open defecation is still common, altered their behaviour to reflect that of **non-Hindu households in regions that are predominantly non-Hindu, where the rate of open defecation is much lower.** Using non-parametric re-weighting methods, this paper projects that **rural open defecation** in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal could be reduced to rates of between 6 and 8 per cent, compared to the **prevailing level of 65 per cent.**\n\n[**https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6183933**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6183933)'<br />Author: 'Altar_of_rishabh1'  id: 'meyund'<br />Score:84<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/meyund/while_muslims_are_poorer_hindu_children_have/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Civil Disobedience and Hindu Festivities'<br />Body: "There is a common saying that nearly every region in India has at least one festival every (lunar) month. Festivals in India have always played multiple roles. They have connected people to each other,  connected people to the divine, and connected people to the world about them. Nearly every festival is a celebration, where neighbours come out of their houses to meet each other, visit friends and proudly and with great joy shake away the blues and mundaneness of the daily life.\n\nOur festivals have their own history, traditions, food, dresses, prayers and fond memories. Festivals have been the glue of the Bharatiya samaaj from time immemorial. I would go so far as to say that unlike Western festivals (New Year, Valentines, Mother's Day etc.) celebrated in India nowadays, our traditional days do not lead to a feeling of loneliness and depression. Even if you are not in your region, you can participate in a regional festival on the same day, albeit with a different name and traditions.\n\nEvery Indian knows this. Then why am I saying this. Because I want you to remember that festivals are an ESSENTIAL part of our way of living. In fact, our lives are meant to be a joyous occasion in themselves.  So, when our festivals are maligned and our traditions distorted to suit someone's agenda we should stay strong. However, when governments start banning and completely restricting them, then we must act. No, I do not seek any violent or vulgar display of power or public anger. That is not the Indian way.\n\nI propose that you enjoy your festivities as a mark of civil disobedience. Yes, the virus is around. So, limit your gathering to one or 2 families only. But, ensure to enjoy yourselves. Play with colours. Share your greeting and sweets. If. however, you want to stay safe, then at least play festive music loudly during the day. Will it cause discomfort to others? Maybe. But, we have to take a stance.  \n\n*We’re fighting for our right to live, to exist.* [We will not go quietly into the night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V16tMmTezFQ)*. We will not vanish without a fight. We’re going to live on. We’re going to survive.* Never forget, we are the free citizens of a great civilization.\n\nHoli ki aapka shubhkamnaye! Happy Holi!

Enjoy Life!"<br />Author: 'halla-nahi-hamla-bol'  id: 'mevhs0'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mevhs0/civil_disobedience_and_hindu_festivities/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'How The British Sowed the Seeds of Khalistan before independence of India'<br />Body: 'In the past we have seen many sikhs in UK,US etc and some even in India has tried to show themselves as separate from hindus and india. In recent past we have seen incident like sikh serving food to Saheenbag Islamists, Sikhs cleaning mosque to the recent the infamous red fort incident. All of this is done by foriegn funded khalistani separatist.\n\nBut many of you wonder how sikhs who were opressed by islamic invaders throughout our history(eg.- Murder of two sons of Guru Govind singh by Wazir Khan) became like this. \n\nThis is how our sikh bhratas and bhaganis have been manipulate by the British.\n\n**#Exploitation Of Sikhs By British:**\n\nBritish wanted to appropriate the Khalsa as a fighting force for heir empire. To this cause they created Brit-Sikhi. They told Sikhs that they’ve lost the true teachings of the Gurus since before that most Sikhs followed Hindu customs.\n\nThey manufactured a “religion” for them.\n\nHarjot Oberoi\'s \'The Construction of Religious Boundaries: Culture, Identity, and Diversity in the Sikh Tradition\' is a good read on the subject:\n\n"Pre-British Sikhs largely followed the same "Hindu" customs for birth, marriage, death etc. Sikh identity was constructed during British times and this based on Abrahamic template of \'religion.\' (cf Balu. there is no religion in India)"\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Construction-Religious-Boundaries-Diversity-Tradition/dp/0226615936\n\nFor this British had employed Max Arthur Macauliffe as British Adminstrators.\n\n\nThis irish man who is literally unknown in ireland has become significant western figure among sikh throughout world.\n\nThis man even tho was an irish refered himself as an English Man throughout his life. He arrived in Bengal,India in 1864 passing the IAS exam in 1862. He was known as Michael McAuliffe back then but he changed his name to Max Arthur Macauliffe in Honor Max Muller. This shows he was walking on the same path as Max Muller.\n\nWhen he arrived in Amritsar he became interested in Sikh scriptures and language he spent 16 years studying them. But his aim was not learning the spiritual importance of sikh panth, it was something else. (ref. :- https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/abroad/the-limerick-man-unknown-in-ireland-but-revered-by-millions-worldwide-1.4052622)\n\nBut this guy which is thought like a saint among sikh throughout the world especially khalistanis was just a clever manipulator.\n\nThis Says it all about Brit policy in regards to Sikhs for loyal cannon fodder:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/wvM9QRQ.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/kL7vGnq.jpg\n\nSource:- https://archive.org/details/cu31924021023654\n\nSimilarly these British indologists peddled the now debunked martial race theory.
