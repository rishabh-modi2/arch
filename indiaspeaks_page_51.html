The book is around 110 pages long and can be found \\[here\\]([https://archive.org/details/HowIBecameAHinduSitaRamGoel](https://archive.org/details/HowIBecameAHinduSitaRamGoel)). It can get slightly dreary at times, but generally it is quite engrossing and it\'s not a long book, so you can get through it quickly. It is about his intellectual journey from his school days, coming in contact with the Arya Samaj, the Independence movement and Gandhian principles, then on to Marxism, Socialism, Western Philosophy with some reading of Hindu texts and Sanskrit literature in between and finally becoming a hardcore Sanatani Hindu.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just wanted to share some thoughts and events he discusses, paraphrasing in my own words. He says Communism and Capitalism are basically by-products of the same Western Materialistic, Industrial based thinking. Ultimately, a society is made up of individuals and for him, the fundamental difference between Aurobindo and Marx was that Marx wanted to make society perfect saw the way to achieve the best society was to start with the individual. This is the view of Sanatana Dharma and the Vedas.\n\nHe was so amazed and awed by Communism, he says that without ever reading a single book or news report about the Soviet Union, he started to believe it had to be a paradise because it was unabashedly Communist. He later said about himself - "I am amazed at the imbecility of my mind with regard to concrete facts while it was alert with regard to theoretical questions".\n\nHis close friend and guide Ram Swarup, who played a major role in his life to the very end once said to him - "You are too intelligent to not be a communist. Luckily, you are also too intelligent to remain a communist for long" :D \n\nHe spent few days under the care of a Catholic priest who he met when he was really sick and recovering in the hospital. The man said he would guide him to God and Goel-ji just went with it. One day he asked the priest why exactly he should accept Christ as the saviour and why just incorporating Christian values and virtues in his daily life was not enough. The priest replied that that is not how it works, it is eternal hell-fire unless you explicitly accept Jesus alone (or maybe the father of Jesus who is technically God, I\'m not sure). He was never planning to convert anyway, but this decisively turned him away from Christianity even though as a small boy, he really liked Jesus\' story and even had a small murthi of Jesus along with Hindus Gods and other figures like Gandhi. \n\nOn Direct Action Day, a Muslim mob cornered him near his house in Kolkata which was at the edge of a Muslim colony. He saved himself by claiming he is a Muslim. His western dress and good urdu saved him. In general, throughout his life he was poor and without a job very often. \n\nHis interactions with the RSS and Jan Sangh were generally friendly, but he laments that they keep trying to present a secular face and are too concerned with what the rest of the world says about them, spending too much energy to wash off the "fascist" and "communalist" tag to be able to do anything constructive. He doesn\'t like their anti-intellectual stand and their belief that action alone is important, intellectual work and building an ideology is a waste of time. For example, from the beginning of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, even after nearly a decade, none of the Hindu organisations had produced any literature about the existence of a temple and its destruction by Muslims while the other side produced more and more literature. Also, he observed that the more clear it became that there was indeed a temple there, the more the Muslim side hardened its stance. \n\nThe most damming thing he said was about the Sangh response to his carefully researched series of articles on what happened to Hindu temples across India (now a book as well) in the RSS weekly, Organiser. Some bigwigs had it shut down because it seemed communal - still this same obsession with image and branding. He interacted and worked with Jayprakash Narayan as well, and he too distanced himself from Goel-ji because he was too "anti-Muslim". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Islam, he said a few things that struck me. He said from the very beginning, Islam has had a habit of destroying the places of worship of other faiths and has always used street riots and street violence as a means to get what they demand. We saw this with the creation of Pakistan and I think we see this to date whenever anyone indulges in blasphemy against the Prophet. He is of the very firm opinion that Islam and Christianity are not religions in any sense, but are actually just totalitarian political ideologies like Communism and Nazism, masquerading as faiths. \n\nOn patriotism/nationalism, again he is of some very clear opinions. His allegiance is first and foremost to Sanathan Dharma, then to the society which has inherited this Dharma and only then to Bharatavarsha, or the land where they reside. Bharatavarsha to him is just another piece of land otherwise. India is Sanathan Dharma and Sanathan Dharma is India. He believed in what we might call "Bhagwa-e-Hind", which is to bring the people of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh back into the Hindu fold, considering them as only people temporarily estranged from larger Hindu society because of Islamic influence.  He says something along the lines of - We Sanatanis have never been aggressive outside our ancestral homeland and sphere of influence, and we must not spare efforts to bring it back under our sphere of influence again. He believed that if Sanatan Dharma dies, India dies. \n\nHis ideology, he says is just "Hinduism", he believes Jainism and Buddhism are strains of Hinduism. \n\nHis biggest lament was the erosion of Indian culture because children are being educated mostly by Christians. He says even though Islam in India was iconoclastic and violent, it never struck the root of Hinduism because the violence usually inspired heroic and violent responses. Also, Islamic influence was limited to the large cities, the centres of politics, but the village was virtually untouched by this and so, education remained in the hands of the Hindus. With the entrance of the British and the missionaries though, he says the subterfuge was very subtle, wore a very sophisticated face and since it captured education, was way more effective than all the violence and forced conversions by Islamic forces. \n\nHis biggest message for Sanatani-minded folks was - Study Islam and understand them carefully, educate the masses about its ideology. The same for Christianity. He felt the building of the Ram temple at Ayodhya was a great initiative, but very soon it became an end in itself and a movement to improve electoral fortunes, for which even comprises with the Muslim community was considered. He felt there should be no compromise and felt there were bigger goals for Hindu society. \n\nThen comes the colourful bits - Many time during his career he was ostracised suddenly, without a job and during the emergency he even received a tip-off that if he visited a certain place he went to regularly, he would be arrested. \n\nHe has a whole postcript on Nehru and Nehruvian secularism. According to him, Nehru was a terrible human being. There was \\[a post\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b4e4y0/if\\_what\\_sita\\_ram\\_goel\\_has\\_said\\_about\\_nehru\\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b4e4y0/if_what_sita_ram_goel_has_said_about_nehru_is/)) on this previously on this sub by u/Young_Rustic, so I will directly quote from that post - \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;"Goel in his book "How I became a Hindu," recounts what he saw of Nehru during a public address in 1930s. During the speech when the mike went off due to some glitch, Nehru smacked in front of public the local congress leader who was responsible for organizing that address. And when the mike started functioning, he told the gathered crowd that "Delhi ki Congress ke karkun kamine hain, razil hain, namaqul hain. Maine kyati baar kaha hai ki intezam nahi kar sakte to mat bulaya karo par ye sunte hi nahin."\n\n\\&gt;The public on hearing this warmed up to him, and clapped their hands to pain, in their appreciation. Pandit ji was famous for his temper, and the public loved him only the more for it. The slapped leader was as effusive as if he "had won some coveted prize."\n\n\\&gt;Goel also tells us of another public gathering, later on, where Nehru was to speak. And then too he conducted himself in a totally rude, vain and distasteful manner." \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoel-ji strongly believes that the entire government just became willing servants of one family (duh) and he was very very unhappy about the creation of centres like JNU to breed "Stalinist professors". He also goes into some detail about how Nehru completely misled the nation before 1962, while building up his persona as the great mediator between the East and the West, a sane voice in a war-hungry world. His reputation abroad lay in absolute tatters after 1962, but it was still propped up by a pliant media in India after that. \n\nEven the grand failure of the 1962 war was written off as a blunder by home minister VK Menon, but Goel-ji has written a whole book in defence of him. I plan to read it soon. It is called - "In Defence of Comrade Krishna Menon: A Political Biography of Pandit Nehru". \n\nHe lamented that the new order after 1947 was only interested in bashing everything about Hinduism as communal, obsessed with RSS and their fascism while going soft on all instance of violence and crimes by Muslims. My main take-away from this was that today\'s Indian politics is along exactly the same fault lines as 60 years back and 30 years back. \n\nThe last thing I want to say is a couple of encounters he had with devout, highly learned Brahmins. They were pretty casteist and he said while he respected their knowledge and it somehow didn\'t diminish their respect for them, he ignored them when they criticised him for working for upliftment of Harijans. The same for the people of his family. He doesn\'t, however, touch very much on caste. \n\nHe started a movement, or a magazine maybe, I\'m not sure, called "Voice of India".

      <li>Title::: 'Should India focus on domestic sports instead of international ones?'<br />Body: "Some Indians lament about how the country is so bad in Olympic sports. **I think India should do the opposite, which is to focus on domestic sports instead of international ones.** My reasons are as follows:\n\n1) **Most Olympic sports are a bad investment.** People forget that, with the exception of some superstars in their respective sports, most Olympians don't get brand endorsement. They have to pour in their own money to get to that stage. That's why developed countries generally have more athletes in the Olympics, besides Communist countries, who state-sponsor their athletes.\n\nMost Indian athletes aren't rich enough to sponsor themselves while the govt needs to spend tax money on more important sectors. As for Indian brands, they'd only be interested if the athlete is a household name. Looking at it this way, it's just a waste of resources to focus on Olympic sports.\n\n2) **Becoming famous in an Olympic sports is gazillion times harder.** Indian athletes are basically competing with the rest of the world in a sports where some countries already have a rich history of excelling in it. Besides, the Indian public won't be interested in that particular sports, unless and until someone wins a medal in international stage. In contrast, some local sports have a huge following, even in the most tribal of areas. It's a lot easier to get local brand endorsement if you're famous, at least to one specific region. \n\n2) **India is a large country.** As the IPL and Pro-Kabaddi League has shown, India is capable of having it's own large sports franchises, just as the US has MLB, NBA and NFL. These franchises are capable of growing to a point where a lot of interest will be generated outside India. It'll be a great export of the country. \n\n3) **A lot more jobs can be generated.** $1 million in sports like swimming or sprinting is like a drop in the ocean. There's no guarantee that the local athletes can even qualify for Olympics, let alone win a medal. Instead, if the money is used in creating a domestic league for a local sports, it has a multiplying effect. Even the food vendor next to the stadium or the clothing retailer who sells fake jerseys can benefit immensely. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'c6l16c'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c6l16c/should_india_focus_on_domestic_sports_instead_of/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Satanic Empire'<br />Body: 'In this post, I would like to share something interesting about one of the world\'s most bloodthirsty empires.\n\nThis is a very long one, so bear with me.\n\nThe men who built and ran the British Empire were not only highly intelligent, but utterly ruthless. In order to try and understand them, I present in the following paragraphs a portion (not word for word) of a Quora answer written by Trilochana Rout to the question, " Can anyone give a comparison of the Middle East before and after the discovery of oil? ".\n\nA nation that is capable of forcing it\'s culture upon another nation is at the peak of its existence and capacity, thus deserving the title of "Empire". Rome was capable of this, the Mauryas were capable of this, as were the Ming and Showa Japanese.\n\nBut all of these were nothing; in power, in ability, in greed, in decadence, in brutality and in hatred, compared to the one true Empire in human history.\n\n**The Imperial British.**\n\nBut Trilochana, you ask - why is a certified Mongol fanboy like you eulogising the British?\nTo this,Papa Tikip says, read my answers again. I have respect for the Mongols. I have nothing but sheer terror when talking about the British.\n\nNo one really thinks about the Imperial British, and for good reason - **they are all dead**. Dead fighting the Imperial Japanese Navy in the Straits of Malacca. Dead in the snows of the Khyber. Dead in the deserts of Asia and Africa. Dead fighting the Wehrmacht.\n\nThe Wehrmacht - the finest fighting force ever created by Europe. They conquered the continent, performed feats not even Napoleon or John Churchill could, laid waste to empires and didn\'t even lose a hundred thousand. Until they ran into Stalin - a true Ubermensch - they had no equal under the sun.\n\nThe Imperial British matched them in quality, but not in numbers, so they are all dead now. The present British race is nothing more the dregs of what it used to be, nothing more than mere mortals. Good for them, **for the Imperial British had as little in common with us human beings as the gardener has with his garden**.\n\nTo the Imperial Briton, the world was a garden to be pruned at will, carved as he saw fit, a thing of enjoyment for him and him alone. God damn the millions of dead left behind. They were a reptilian race, with little idea of mercy, honesty and faith. They were supreme sociologists, able to treat mighty empires like a bunch of retarded children.\n\nTo this day, the average westerner or Russian considers them to be harmless Monty Pythonesque tea drinkers, the Asian liberals think of them as gods, the Asian nationalists hate them. Even I am guilty of this at times.\n\nFools, all of us! The only rational emotion any of us should be feeling when discussing the Imperial British is sheer, unadulterated terror. One day, I will talk about what they did in Sri Lanka, in Malaysia, the Great Game, in Africa, in India. \n\nNow OP, we come to the real story.\nOil, you say? Oil? This is where we go wrong. We focus on the machine and forget the man. Man is far superior to the Machine….\nThe watershed of the Middle East - social, political, economical, cultural and everything in between - were two Civil Wars.\n\nThe first, smaller one, was fought between the House of Saud and their rivals - especially the House of Rashid.\n\nThe second, far greater one, was fought in the gentleman clubs of London, the shikar lodges of Central India and ballrooms in Paris. It was fought between the India office of the British Raj and the Foreign Office of the British Empire.\n\nOne of the most hilarious things one can read online are the usual arguments and rants about Radical Islam in the wake of a terrorist attack in the west. However, I have never seen a similar response in western forums when it comes to attacks in Asia. Does any westerner even remember Beslan? What about the attack on the Indian Parliament? Anyway…\n\nIn this case though, the liberals and Muslims crying "Islamophobia" have a point. The entire business of Islamic Radicalism was carefully nurtured, delicately cultivated and painstakingly transported into the heart of Islamdom by none other than the loyal servants of the British Crown in the India office.\n\n**Wahhabism might have been founded in Saudi Arabia, but it\'s true birthplace was India.**\n\n*"I can remember….being absolutely baffled when a local (Afghan) Khan told me….to look out for what he called….the Fanatic Camp (referring to the cantonments of the Khyber Rifles of the British Indian Army)".*\n**-Charles Allen, quoting a Nineteenth century Irish trader, Hidden Roots of Wahabbism in India.**\n\nTo understand this, we have to look at the two distinct breeds of Britons that inhabited Imperial Era Britain.\nThe first group - let\'s call them the **Lilies of the Field**: the nobility, the sons of rich houses, of trade, first sons of industry - born in luxury, transferred directly to positions of power, people who neither gilded nor spun.\n\nThe second group were **the Nabobs**: second sons, wastrels, men who couldn\'t sit still, men with unnatural levels of aggression, petty criminals, the outcome of an exploding English population.\n\nThe first group ruled Britain, created the Foreign Office, earned nothing but grew fat on the riches of the East. The second group died, died, and died some more to secure those riches for the enjoyment of the first.\n\nAnd thus rose the India Office - voice of the resentful Nabobs.\n\nThe Lilies were a cultured race who knew little of the cruel realities of the Colonies and the terrible cost of their luxuries. The Nabobs knew nothing but War, Death, Loot - and tribute, hated tribute to the Lilies. A shared blood and mystique of Empire kept them from attacking the Lilies; indeed if the Lilies had promoted a sense of social equality - as they ended up doing after WW1, Wahhabism may have died out in the 1800s. But they didn\'t.\n\nBy the 1870s, political and social one-upmanship between the old school Lilies and the colonial Nabobs had exploded into a virtual Civil War. Both groups competed for prestige, political control, foreign trade and of course, personal wealth. \n\nThe Nabobs had the advantage of the limitless slaves they owned in India, Malaysia, Oceania (of course, they didn\'t call us slaves. We were "indentured labour".), their natural industriousness, their hunger for success, their war like nature and contempt for the laws of Man. From their capital in Delhi, they controlled all their imports into London.\n\nThe Lilies had the advantage of their ancestry, the lopsided laws and unfair balance of payments in their favor, ability to dictate terms to the Nabobs, the natural servility of the Nabob when faced with a Lily, and an iron hold on every single product exported from the shores of London.\n\nSo they fought, and fought and finally ended up in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\n**The Lilies, true to their nature, threw in their lot with the cosmopolitan, civilized, tolerant, open minded Al Rashidi**. Not much is known about them - but one thing is certain. They - like practically all Muslims of the time - were arguably the most "liberal" religious group on the planet then. At one point, they controlled all of modern day Saudi Arabia as well as most of Yemen. Their attempted conquest of Kuwait, and thus link up with the Persian Shah was thwarted by the intervention of the Royal Indian Navy.\n\n**The Nabobs chose the Al Saud** - a smaller, more tightly knit, more violent, vicious, business minded, xenophobic tribe. There is a kind of terrible parallel between the hard riding, hard living, slave trading megalomaniac Colonial British and the Wahhabi Al Sauds. The Raj officers actively promoted an interpretation that would encourage a culture of violence and martyrdom within the Saud - but retard any sort of social progress - thus keeping the Arabs open for military recruitment. Is it any wonder that Saudi Arabia as such a terrifying land today?\n\n*"Lord Curzon and his senior officers had their own glorious reception from the sheikhs of Al Khalifa. What happened was that Sheikh Isa ordered his children to carry the white men on their own shoulders. But the Lord refused to let anyone touch or carry him, and sheikhs of Al Khalifa had no choice but to carry the Lord over his throne made of gold and silver, which Curzon brought specially from India."*\n**-Robert Lacey, The Kingdom**\n\nUnder Nabob influence, Wahhabism - originally a redneck petty cult grew to the horror we still suffer today. Indian Islam was just emerging from a massive shock. An attempted pan-Indian "Jihad" (War of 1857) had just failed and reconstruction had led to the emergence of an educated, powerful Hindu bureaucratic elite. However, while this discontent had led to social and educational reforms within the Shia community, the Sunnis had turned to the Deobandi School.\n\nThe Nabobs, ever conscious of the need for Divide and Rule, groomed the Deobandis as a weapon against the Hindus and Sikhs, and interestingly against the Shias, who were suspected of maintaining links with Persia. The transfer of vast numbers of Deobandi clerics to the Al Saud was as much to counter Persian influence as it was to encourage an interpretation of Islam completely at odds with the versions followed in Iran.\n\n*"We must put an end to Islamic unity. We must ensure there never rise again unity for the Muslims, be it intellectual or cultural…"*\n**-Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India**\n\nSo there you have it. Wahhabism is a manufactured religion made in the smoking rooms of the India Office, by people whose aim was to keep Islam divided and primitive for ever, to keep Arabia a cesspool of sectarian and divisive thought and to foster a culture as violent and barbaric as possible to ensure a stable source of military power in the very backyard of the Ottomans. Al Wahhab? Don\'t make me laugh. His "works" are in all likelihood, forgeries planted by agents of the Raj. I only wonder how much Curzon paid to buy his sons and followers…\n\n**When ISIS claims that the Wahhabis aren\'t true Muslims, they are so right that it is hilarious!**\n\nIn the end, the victory of the Al Saud was never in doubt. They had it all - a more martial religion, a culture that promoted barbarism and glorified warfare, training from the most powerful army in the world (the British Indian Army) as well as an irrepressible sense of cultural superiority they\'d copied from the Nabobs. The Lilies, as World War 1 would go on to show, simply lacked the stomach for total war.\n\n*"Your grace are my father and you are my mother. I can never forget the debt I owe you. You made and you held my hand, you elevated me and lifted me. I am prepared, at your beckoning, to give up for you now half of my kingdom...no, by Allah, I will give up all of my kingdom, if your grace commands me!"*\n**-Sultan Abdul-Aziz Al Saud to Sir Percy Cox, British High Commissioner, early 20th Century.**\n\nIf you want a picture of what the British Raj really was like, just take a look at the Al Saud family. The women have to wear a few more clothes in general and the overall decor is more ugly - but from the right perspective, they are pretty much the same culturally...'<br />Author: 'GoodSerKnight'  id: 'c6iivy'<br />Score:34<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c6iivy/the_satanic_empire/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The End of Feminism and why Jordan Peterson is a crucial figure for Civilization in these unsettled times. (long but worth the read, I think)'<br />Body: " \n\nThe End of Feminism and why Jordan Peterson is a crucial figure for Civilization in these unsettled times. (long but worth the read, I think)\n\nSomething very interesting is happening. OK Cupid, a dating app, released data showing that men rate most women as above average in attractiveness, but 80% of the men were rated below average by women. A study just released showed that 1 in 4 adults are not having any sex at all, and they are mostly young men.\n\nWhat does this tell us?\n\n1. Women are choosy, men are not. Or rather, women are far more choosy than men. The man's happy to get almost anyone, the woman is much more discriminating and most men don't make the grade for most women.\n\n2. If many more women than men are having sex, then:\n\na. Polygamy (sex, not marriage) is happening. Lots of women are having sex with a few men. That means women are sharing those men. The men who are having sex, are on average getting it on with more than one woman. Doesn't mean that there aren't women playing the field. But on average, a few of the men are getting in bed with most of the women.\n\nb. If its the young men who are not having sex, but young women are, it means young women are choosing older men. Even when it means sharing that man with other women.\n\nc. If young women and older women are all having sex with the same older men, it means younger and older women are in competition for those few men.\n\nSome thoughts about this:\n\n1. It seems that women, when freed from all societal control on sex and marriage, freed from the compulsion to marry young, free to choose their own mate, freed to choose their own mating arrangements, are choosing polygamy with older men. Men who can meet the competing needs and demands of more than one woman, are getting more than one woman. The only thing preventing it from becoming recognized as a developing reality is the legal requirement of monogamy and the disaster in court for infidelity.   \n2. This means that if people are left to themselves, with neither family nor society nor courts dictating arrangements of copling, we will end up with a few men marrying lots of women, and the losers will be young men.   \n3. But as we look across human history, virtually all human societies have rituals of boys entering manhood and taking a wife. Polygamy occurs in very few cultures. If the natural tendency of unstructured society is for women to choose polygamy with older men, it would seem that virtually all cultures across humanity and through out history have evolved to prevent this.  \n4. Why? It can only be that young men, full of energy, lust, and strength, if deprived of sex, have no incentive to follow the norms of society. No reason to learn any craft, take on any responsibility, attain maturity of competence and value to society. Men like that are trouble. Robbery, gangsterism, rape, fighting, dominance plays, exercise of that dominance over everything within reach, are all inevitable outcomes.   \n5. Lets look at Lions and Gorillas. Both species have a family of one dominant male and multiple females. The male gets mating privilege with a group of females. Adult males are not welcome in the group at all, or they are kept subservient by the dominant male with reduced or no mating opportunities. The dominant male has to maintain his dominance, and roving lone young males are a constant threat. One day the Dominant lion defeated by an invading youngster, and loses his females to the winner. One day the male gorilla is unable to protect his tribe, or dies, and the family scatters, the females dispersing to join the families of other still dominant males.  \n6. It would seem that as humans started to collect from individual families of 10 or 20 members into villages and settlements, letting natural preferences for mating play out was not feasible. In the earliest villages of 200 or 300 people, young males without a sexual partner would have been very dangerous. If the older men, the patriarchs, had all the women, all the children, all the resources, and all the authority and command, and the young bulls had no sex and no status, and only the expectation to do labor and take risks for the tribe, the young bulls would have torn the society apart by beating up and killing the old men and taking the women for themselves.  \n7. It would further seem that the development of bigger settlements that were stable and didn’t tear themselves apart, it was required for older men to give up the claim to younger women, and to give up the claim to more than one woman, so that young men got sex, and with it, the responsibility to care for a family and be responsible to the society, instead of raping and pillaging. The only way you could avoid this were if your social norms channeled the lust and energy of young men to unending conquest, rape and pillage of other societies, the acquisition of their women, and their resources, while the patriarchs kept what they had, including multiple wives for each one. It also indicates that such a society would have to find some balance between polygamy and monogamy depending upon the opportunities for conquest rape and pillage. When the opportunity is small or non existent, polygamy would be reduced. That is indeed what we see in Islam.  \n8. It would seem that civilization, sexuality and war are very fundamentally intertwined. It would seem that limiting the freedom of women and men to do whatever they want is an essential basis of civilization. When those limits are removed, society starts to tilt into the chaos that those limits were developed to prevent.\n\nSo what are our take aways?\n\nFirstly, ladies, if you’re in your 20s and not in a hurry to settle down, because this is time for career, and free sex and there is plenty of time to find a good man, you’re heading for trouble. When you think you’re ready, the most of the best men will already be off the market, and those that remain will be spoiled for choice, and won’t have as much incentive to commit themselves and their resources exclusively to your wants, needs, demands, expectations as you are going to wish for. If a woman chooses a mate when she’s twenty two, she sets the rules and power structure of the marriage. If she waits till she’s 35, that opportunity is gone. While you were building your career and having a boyfriend you were never going to marry, you didn’t build up anything of value to a prospective mate that would cause him to surrender his freedom and power and resources to you, not when there is a 25 years old in the picture competing for those resources. The guys who would have given it all to you when you were 22 or 27, they’re gone.\n\nSo what does tell us about the future that’s coming? Its not like young American women are going to suddenly decide to start looking for love and marriage with young men. Those young men are turning into rebels and it can’t be stopped. They’re not going to give a crap about the rules and norms of society that keeps them in control because they’re not getting the rewards and responsibilities of following those rules and norms.\n\nRespect women? Why should they?   \nRespect immigrants? Why should they?   \nRespect gays? Why should they?   \nSeek higher education? Why should they?   \nWork hard? Why should they?   \nBuild up financial security and a nest egg? Why should they?   \nTolerate Muslims? Why should they?\n\nThese are all rules for a stable, progressive society, no doubt, but the benefits of these rules society accrue to everyone but them. Why should they be the ones maintaining the order for everyone else while they go without the rewards of taking responsibility?\n\nThey’re not going to. What they are going to do is stand up for Free Speech and the right to bear arms. They have things to say and they want to say them. And much of what they have to say are truths that have been made taboo to speak. Men who are long dead guaranteed that individuals would always have the right to bear arms, as their personal power against oppression. These young men don’t have to go down the Nazi route. They only have to speak the truth as they see it, and they’re armed. Very well armed. And they are confident that as long as they follow the spirit of the constitution that gave them the rights of free speech and the right to bear arms, they can exercise their muscle, with the blessings of the wisdom of the Founding Fathers of America, no matter what the prevailing norms are.\n\nThese men are going to upset the village.\n\nBluntly put, we’re back to the dynamic that would have applied to the first villages. Women being set free from the compulsion of marrying early so that they can pursue their careers and be free to have romantic and sexual relationships that they do not intend to turn into marriage, has caused society to drift into the primitive behaviours of dominant males possessing multiple females, by the female’s choice, and bands of young unattached males looking to upset the order for everyone.\n\nFeminism has run its course. We have found out what happens to society when women are empowered with education and careers and set totally free. It creates an army of deprived young men who have no investment in that arrangement, and plenty of incentive to reject it. They’re going to reject it, and its not going to be pretty for the feminists, the multiculturalists, the social justice warriors, the sharia Bolsheviks.\n\nAnd the only thing that we have to count on that this will be for the better and not the worse, is that these young men are guided still by the highest ideals of western civilization, as articulated by the Founding Fathers of the United States. Which is free speech, equality freedom of the individual, democracy, opposition to rule by kings, generals, clerics.\n\nThese principles are the only protection we have against the rize of neo-Nazis. This is why the rise of Jordan Peterson is so so crucial. He is guiding all these lost men towards those high ideals of western civilization, instead of letting them fall into easy bigotry and brutality towards immigrants, muslims, women, and so forth.\n\nThe days of postmodernist theory, neomarxism, social justice warriors, and feminism are over. The future is going to be decided by the West reclaiming its original principles and rethinking how much of the progress of the 20th century is for keeps, and what parts of it get thrown away."<br />Author: 'batman_is_dull'  id: 'c61nk1'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c61nk1/the_end_of_feminism_and_why_jordan_peterson_is_a/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Emergency 101'<br />Body: 'My post from 4 years ago. Copy pasting it. \n\nHistorical origins of an emergency type clause\n\nThis clause is not a new concept nor is it specific to the Indian constitution alone, if you go back to the Roman republic, even they had a similar clause. The overarching logic was that a democracy could be fractious and quarrelsome and while this plurality is good in times of peace, during times of war or extraordinary stress on a nation you needed quite literally a\xa0Dictator. One person who would govern the republic on behalf of its assembly but not needing to turn to the assembly to make or pass laws.\n\nAcross time this provision has been mostly misused by power hungry politicians to stay on in power. The worst abuser of this power in ancient times was one Gaius Julius Caesar who used a malleable Senate to make himself dictator 5 times in a row and finally to make himself dictator et perpetus (or dictator for all eternity). As with other aspects of our political system including the Westminster style governance model, this “emergency” law is inspired by the\xa0UK emergency powers act,\xa0only the President is replaced by Her Majesty the Queen.\n\nThere is a historical basis and validity for having an emergency provision in the constitution.\n\nChecks and Balances in the System\n\nNow, the founding fathers must have clearly seen the misuse that this act could be put to and hence put in place a lot of checks and balances which can be found under [Part XVIII of Article 352](http://lawmin.nic.in/olwing/coi/coi-english/Const.Pock%202Pg.Rom8Fsss(24).pdf). In a nutshell the checks and balances are as follows.\n\nEmergency can only be declared by the President.\n\nOnly the cabinet can recommend such an invocation of the Emergency act\n\nThis is check &amp; balance number 1 – In theory the President is to be the supreme head of the nation and is supposed to be apolitical and above all politics. The PM and his / her cabinet are supposed to be elected representatives acting with the interests of the people in mind. Hence a power hungry President nor a power hungry PM could highhandedly invoke this act.\n\nAll proclamations issued under the period the nation is under a state of emergency have to be ratified by the Parliament once it is reconvened.\n\nThis is an interesting ‘twist’ as historical emergency laws like the\xa0Senatus Consultum\xa0which usually gave complete immunity to the law maker acting as the supreme authority. In the Indian constitution, you could be a “dictator” in the (traditional) Roman sense, yet you had to get your laws ratified by the parliament or they would lapse within 30 days of said law being passed.\n\nEach state of “emergency” was valid only for 6 months and needed to be extended by the President or else the state of emergency would automatically lapse after a year.\n\nAgain a wonderful check and balance on paper that failed miserably in the real world. Clearly, you could (or so the founding fathers must have thought) get away by passing an emergency proclamation once, but once it ended 6 months later, you would have to once again push it past the President who has the authority to reject the same.\n\nIf even 1/10th of the members of the house vote against a proclamation (in writing), the President has to then reconsider the proclamation.\n\nThis is the final check on potentially power hungry leaders. Even if the President is tainted, even if the PM is tainted, the Indian parliament should have at least 60 MP’s capable of independent thought is the logic…and yet how it failed in the real world.\n\nIndia is Indira, Indira is India\n\nBefore we get into these macro events that lead to the Emergency being proclaimed in India, we need to understand the psyche of Indira Gandhi and how she first rose from obscurity to becoming the absolute master of her cabinet and the Parliament.\n\nMrs Indira Feroze Gandhi – Who was she really? How did she get to be the PM of India?\n\nIn 1959 she was “elected” to the post of the President of the INC, and even earlier on, she had unofficially wielded a lot of power in her father, Nehru’s cabinet by merely working as his personal assistant.\xa0Some biographers\xa0suggest that PM Nehru had offered the PM post to his daughter while he was alive, but she declined and after he died, the post went to L.B.Shastri.\n\nElected into parliament for the first time in 1961 became a cabinet minister for I&amp;B in Shastri’s PM cabinet. During these days, the PM (defacto head of the Congress party) held the reins of power in the governement while the party was controlled by others called “The Syndicate”.\n\nIn 1966, Shastri suddenly died (conspiracy theories abound on how Indira could have orchestrated this death) and there was a huge power vacuum in Delhi. While in the case of Nehru, his death was more or less planned for and a succession plan in place, this…sudden death threw up possibilities for many a Congress strongman eager to play the Game of Thrones.\n\nThe leading contenders were, Y.B. Chavan (Defence minister), S.K Patil (the precursor to Sharad Pawar as the proverbial Maratha strongman in Delhi), Kamraj (very strong base in TN, but weak outside), and the proverbial 800 pound Gorilla in the room – Moraji Desai fortified by the daily intake of his own urine.\n\nNow, despite his urine drinking habits (and his lackluster tenure) might suggest he was in the 60’s seen as this pro business, centre right politician. However his policies and views clashed with Nehru who had him shunted out of the cabinet and into the political wilderness. Moraji also did not enjoy the support of a lot of other Congressmen because he was seen as a “strongman”. Moraji had made plays at being PM repeatedly in the 60’s, but was originally thwarted by Nehru and after that by what was emerging as “The Syndicate“. A group lead by the Petyr Baelish of the Indian political scenario in the 60’s. Kamaraj! Now he might have not had a mass base, but as the head of the Congress brain trust he called all the shots and pulled all the strings and he formed a group called “The Syndicate” which comprised of himself at the head and had Sanjiva Reddy, SK Patil, Atulya Ghosh and S Nijalingappa.\n\nWhat is interesting about the Syndicate is that, compared to a Moraji Desai, these men all did not have the mass base that would have gotten them to the PM’s post, BUT they controlled the states of TN, Bengal, Maharashtra &amp; Karnataka and hence had immense political clout when they combined forces.\n\nThe Syndicate first thwarted Moraji (how Kamraj did it is a lesson in Chankyan politics which would put a Peyter Baelish to shame, but a separate topic in itself), installed a politically rather weak (but administratively excellent PM) L.B.Shastri. However on his sudden and unexpected death, the power struggle which Kamraj had managed to prevent from erupting…came to the fore.\n\nThe Syndicate was in a massive dilemma. Bring in Moraji and he would shut down their power. Bring in a YB Chavan and he might do the same, and so Kamaraj hit upon the biggest #facepalm level idea. Bring in the “Goongi Gudiya” (as Indira was derisively called) as PM, control her from behind the scenes. Thus, Indira Priyadarshini Feroze Gandhi became the PM of India. Here is an interesting plot twist. Before he died, L.B.Shastri was (after political differences) planning on ending her political career by forcing her to resign from the cabinet and then using the Syndicate to get her to resign from the INC itself and then he promptly went and died (which is why the conspiracy theories).\n\nTo do a Tl;dr version, Indira morphed into Kali from the Goongi Gudiya (brilliant political machinations again, only this time, Kamraj was completely outplayed by this “naive babe in the woods”) destroyed the Syndicate, split the party into two camps, pushed Moraji into submission, eliminated Kamaraj as a political threat and consolidated her hold over her cabinet AND the party (the first time a single power centre controlled both the government as well as the party) and went into elections with the hope filled slogan of “Garibi Hatao” and won a massive victory.\n\nShe then did exactly what Modi is doing now, which was to centralise all power in the PMO. Strengthen the bureaucrats while ensuring that the cabinet remained a side-show and a cabinet in name only. She then nominated political non-entities to cabinet posts and became “Kali”\n\nThe sociopolitical background to the crisis of 1975\n\nBy 1974, Indira had managed to consolidate her hold over the party (by causing a split with a Moraji Desai lead faction) and formed the Congress (I) which is the current Congress party’s name, she had lead India into a successful war in 1972, nationalised banks and had a huge vote bank of the poor ready to back her in the elections.\n\nHowever, India was also in the grip of constant strife, unrest and violence that largely stemmed from her policies. The OPEC crisis exploded India’s gas bill and Indira had allowed a policy of easy imports into the country to fuel growth (or a sense of growth). These two factors pushed\xa0inflation upto 20%\xa0for some context, the inflation that partly defeated the UPA II did not cross 9%. Her nationalisation policies almost totally stopped the flow of FDI into the country and her pushing up Income Tax rates to obscene levels chased away money circulation in the system. With industries fleeing, high inflation across the board and massive unemployment came massive unrest.\n\nAt this time came to the fore, the great activist\xa0J.P Narayan. He organised massive rallies in Bihar (and Gujarat) in which he called for a “Total Revolution”. He was a believer in Ahimsa, yet his processions were lathi charged, and tear gas fired into it. He then lead a strike of the Railway workers Union, and Indira despite being adviced to negotiate with them, saw this as an affront to her personal self and ordered the Police to brutally assault these protesters, throw the main leaders into jail and evict the families of those participating in the strike from their government quarters. All this did not go well with the people of India, and the tide was beginning to turn against Mrs Gandhi.\n\nWhile all this was going on, parallely she was waging a struggle against the judiciary. She controlled the executive totally, she controlled the party, but she did not control the judiciary which thankfully acted as the one bulwark of resistance against the Gandhi assault and when the Judiciary passed judgments against her, she simply went to the parliament (rubber stamp parliament) and got the constitution amended to suit her own political requirements. A classic test case was the\xa0Golaknath case.\n\nI am going to for the sake of brevity, provide a\xa0short\xa0version of it. The government under it’s socialistic leanings passed a law that said any citizen was entitled to only 30 acres of land, and anything in excess of this would be deemed “surplus”. While this was done by Nehru in 1953, the plaintiffs filed a case that said that this law in itself was illegal.\n\nGiven the speed at which our cases travel in our courts, the SC passed judgement in 1967 that said “The Constitution does not allow for any laws to be passed that affect the fundamental rights as described within the constitution and hence the land law was illegal and extra constitutional”.\n\nIndira could have simply taken the verdict and respected it for what it was, but again she decided that the judiciary controlling the executive was not done and started the process of “constitutional amendments”. In essence this (almost childishly) amended the part in the constitution which said that the Parliament cannot touch the fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution. Once this was done, the SC verdict became null &amp; void. Indira’s (read the Executive) power was supreme!!!\n\nShe had in the past already exhibited her tendency to flout constitutional requirements or use them when it suited her needs when she convinced Nehru to dismiss the\xa0first democratically elected Communist government in the world\xa0under the very same constitutional provision she would use to declare emergency. So you could say that the the evidence was already there and a pattern established.\n\nThe Catalyst and the consequence\n\nIn 1974 the\xa0Nav Nirman movement\xa0in Gujarat caused immense civil strife and shut down the state. It demanded the resignation of the CM &amp; the education minister on charges of corruption and inefficiency. The state responded with violence and lathi charges. This caused more people to join the agitation and at a point in time, almost the whole of Gujarat was under curfew and the army called out in Ahmedabad.\n\nIndira asked Chimanbhai Patel to resign, and she got the pliant governor to “suspend” the state assembly and President’s rule (once again) was imposed. The opposition now lead by Moraji Desai was having none of this, and they demanded that the assembly be dissolved and fresh elections held. After a lot of resistance, Indira agreed only to be promptly defeated by a coalition of parties called the “Janata Party”. This was an absolute shock to her as she had expected the Congress (under a new CM) to come back into power. It showed that electorally she was no longer untouchable.\n\nThe proverbial straw that broke the camels back was the\xa0Case of UP versus Raj Narain. In 1971 she won from Rae Bareli in\xa0a massive landslide victory. Her main opponent, Raj Narain filed a case in the UP high court that alleged misuse of government machinery to gain an unfair advantage in the elections. The case finally came up for sentencing in 1975 in which Judge Sinha found her guilty on all charges, declared her victory as basically illegal and barred her from holding any public office for 6 years. She appealed this in the SC, and the SC granted a stay of execution (it agreed with the HC judgement) and asked for all benefits provided to her as an MP to be retroactively rolled back. The judgement came in on the 24th of June 1975.\n\nOn the 25th of June, the pliant President proclaimed a state of emergency!\n\nFinis'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'c55wtl'<br />Score:70<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c55wtl/emergency_101/</li>

These are both landmasses existing on their own tectonic plates, and have a variety of ethnolinguistic factions that occupy a certain portion of their respective peninsulas. However, it is clear to me that Europe allows for the independence of each of these diverse linguistic populations while maintaining a Union through which the sovereign states can communicate, while India is intent on the subjugation of all of its diverse peoples under one messy institution. Noticing the success of the EU and the autonomy that each country in the union maintains while helping each other out, I truly wish for a day that India can follow this model and form a union of states since almost every state in India has its own unique predominant language and cultural heritage. This would not only allow for cultural unity within each sovereign state, which India as a whole currently lacks, but would allow for the issues that each state faces to be solved in a much more efficient manner rather than grouping everyone into a highly inefficient billion-person “democracy”. Let me know what your thoughts are on this and if this would be a reasonable path forward for the Indian subcontinent to ensure economic and societal prosperity in the future, which the subcontinent is currently severely lacking.'<br />Author: 'thecarboncreature'  id: 'c4k26b'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c4k26b/india_vs_europe/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Is it true that Vasco Da Gama was guided to India by an Indian merchant? If so, how?'<br />Body: "Vasco da Gama ! A Navigator or another Christian pirate.\n\nDr Vivek Arya\n\nVasco da Gama! This name is mentioned in our History books as a great navigator who through daring expedition searched the sea voyage between Europe and India. Vasco broke the Muslim domination on the trade route to Europe from India. This indeed proves importance of our country in those days. For centuries all together Europeans fought with Muslims to establish this trade route.\n\nVasco de gama landed at Kappad Beach near Calicut, Kerala on 14th May,1498. It was an open harbor filled with vessels of different sizes and the beach was lined with shops and warehouses. Local families of curious sight seekers, along with their children, came out to see the ships that looked quite different from those plying the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe local king Samudrin(Zamorin) of calicut lived in a palace. On his way to the palace, Vasco stopped to pray at a Hindu temple. He was under the mistaken belief that the Hindus were heretical Christians.\n\nHis landing party had assumed that Hindu temples were Christian churches, they had misconstrued the Brahmans invocation of a local deity as veneration of the Virgin Mary and they had decided the Hindu figures on the temple walls were outlandish Christian saints.” True, “the temples were also crammed with animal gods and sacred phalluses,” but these surely reflected exotic local Christian practices. What mattered to the Portuguese was that these long-lost Indian Christians permitted images in their “churches.” Thus, whatever their idiosyncrasies, they could not be Muslims. The Portuguese joined in the chants and invocations with gusto. When the Hindu priests chanted “Krishna,” the Portuguese heard it as “Christ.”\n\n[Ref. Nigel Cliff, Holy War:How Vasco da Gama's Epic Voyages Turned the Tide in a Centuries-Old Clash of Civilizations,2011]\n\nIn the Palace the navigator was received with traditional hospitality, including a grand procession of at least 3,000 armed Nair's. The king while seated on a green couch below a silk canopy was wearing a string of pearls and a heart shaped emerald surrounded by rubies, the insignia of royalty.The presents that Gama sent to the Zamorin as gifts were trivial, and failed to impress. However the King agreed to trade in pepper and other spices in exchange for gold and silver. Vasco returned soon to Portugal. Though he lost many man on the voyage but he succeeded in breaking the monopoly of Arabs.\n\nPreparations now began in Portugal to send a larger fleet of thirteen ships, armed with cannons and 1200 men. The fleet arrived in 1500. The reached calicut and demanded the King to expel all Arabs and to trade exclusively with Portugal. Indians were not interested on such arrangement. While negotiations were ongoing the Portuguese captured a large ship of Arabs. They retaliated by attacking a Portuguese contingent in city. Portuguese now seized ten more ships in the harbor and burned their crew alive. Now they bombarded the city for two days and even forced the Samudrin to flee from his palace. It was a humiliation that the rulers of Calicut would never forget. Portuguese fleet returned home with loads of pepper. This was first attempt by Europeans to dominate on the Indian Ocean.\n\nVasco returned soon to establish his image as a cruel navigator. He again refused to negotiate and bombarded the city for three days. He seized all the ships on harbor and their crews-800 men in all. They were paraded on ship’s decks and then killed by having their arms, noses and ears amputated. The body parts were piled into a boat and sent ashore. When the Samudrin sent a Brahman messenger to negotiate for peace. He was gruesomely mutilated and sent back. His two sons and a nephew, who had accompanied him, were hanged from the mast.\n\nThe same story repeated again and again along with the coastline of Indian ocean for the next decade. Portuguese established their rule in Goa in 1510 under the command of Alfonso de Albuquerque. A new era of Christian persecution and forceful conversion was penned by the Christian missionaries. Not to forget Francis Xavier was foremost in this heinous crime against Humanity.\n\nThe historical account of Portuguese invasion on India is not a simple historical record but a dismal record of greed, savagery and fanaticism. Vasco through his expeditions and the manner in which he handled the Samudrin proved that was a cruel Christian missionary in the grabs of explorer. They looted our country and never refrained to kill anyone. It will be right to say that this expedition by Vasco was nothing more than a Christian Jihad.\n\nBiggest agony is that Communist historians of our country portrayed Vasco as a great navigator who established the trade link between India and Europe. Truth is that he was a greedy, religious bigot and an oppressor pirate.\n\ncan anyone verify this claim?"<br />Author: '10100011a10100011a'  id: 'c4k1y1'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c4k1y1/is_it_true_that_vasco_da_gama_was_guided_to_india/</li>

(Google definition 👇)\n\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects children and teens and can continue into adulthood. ADHD is the most commonly diagnosed mental disorder of children. Children with ADHD may be hyperactive and unable control their impulses. Or they may have trouble paying attention. These behaviors interfere with school and home life. \n\nCommon symptoms-\nIs easily distracted; Doesn't follow directions or finish tasks; Doesn't appear to be listening; Doesn't pay attention and makes careless mistakes; Forgets about daily activities; Has problems organizing daily tasks; Doesn’t like to do things that require sitting still; Often loses things; Tends to daydream\n\n(https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/childhood-adhd/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd link for more info)\n\nThese things are often mistaken with laziness, which is really not the case. I am sure there are people who suffer from it, but don't know it themselves because they don't know such a thing exists. \n\nThis struck me when i watched a YouTuber's (Ryan Higa's) video who has ADHD, and made a video about it. Till then, i didn't even know such a thing exists, mainly because of absence of conversation. Parents don't tend to talk with their children about various mental diseases, and it happens either because they feel uncomfortable about it, or they also don't know anything about it. I didn't even know what OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) was until i watched a stand up set about it. \n\nThe reason i decided to write and share it is because after watching the video and taking some online surveys about it, i thought i had it. I shared it with my friend and she said it is only in my head (as people mostly address depression - it's only in your head) and then later thought that it is some kind of a serious mental illness. She and all my friends don't know it is normal, and not an excuse of laziness. Having this is not a big deal and is not some rare shit. That was the moment i realized how we as a society don't know about some important things and that needed to be discussed. \n\nI'm really sorry if you think this is stupid, but I'm sure this will generate some discussion and that was the main purpose. And people who didn't know about it, well now you do. If you are a teenager or young, make sure to check if you have it or not. It can affect with your day to day life. And adults, if you think people around you may have it, start a conversation and help them the way you can.

      <li>Title::: 'In the background of water crisis in our major cities, it is interesting to read how cities in developed countries fare'<br />Body: ' \n\n&gt;**The water resources of Singapore** are especially precious given the small amount of densely settled land. Singapore receives an average of 2,400mm of rainfall annually, well above the global average of 1,050mm. The constraint is the limited land area to catch and store the rainfall, and the absence of natural [aquifers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquifer) and lakes.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Singapore#cite_note-Luan-6) Therefore, Singapore relies on four water sources, called "the four taps":  \n&gt;  \n&gt;rainfall, collected in artificial [reservoirs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_(water)) that collect water from carefully managed catchment areas (200-300 million gallons per day, depending on rainfall),  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Imported water from [Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia) (up to 250\xa0million imperial gallons (1,100,000\xa0m3) per day, according to the 99-year agreement signed in 1962, plus an additional quantity under the 1990 agreement),  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[Reclaimed water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reclaimed_water) (producing what is called [NEWater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEWater)) (up to 115\xa0million imperial gallons (520,000\xa0m3) per day, officially only "30% of demand"), and  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Seawater [desalination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desalination) (up to 50\xa0million imperial gallons (230,000\xa0m3) per day, officially only "10% of demand").  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This "four tap" strategy aims to reduce reliance on supply from Malaysia by increasing the volume supplied from the three other sources, or "national taps". Since water demand in 2011 was 380\xa0million imperial gallons (1,700,000\xa0m3) per day, Singapore could actually already have been water self-sufficient in 2011 except in years of very low rainfall. The official figures downplay the share of reclaimed and desalinated water in water supply, and thus the ability of the country to be self-sufficient. However, the Chairman of PUB admitted in 2012 that water self-sufficiency could be achieved well before the target year of 2061.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In Singapore, water management is closely integrated with land management. The latter is tightly controlled in order to prevent any pollution of water resources through sewage, sullage or other sources of pollution. The management of water supply, sanitation and stormwater drainage is managed by a single agency, the Public Utilities Board, in an integrated and coordinated manner.'<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'c41e37'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c41e37/in_the_background_of_water_crisis_in_our_major/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Wing Commander Abhinandan being shot down is the real Rafale scandal'<br />Body: '#Ok Guys, You guys have to read this ..Some real good points raised and few important questions asked ..\n\nPAF had outranged and outgunned India’s best fighter jets, and it’s only because of IAF’s training, awareness and some luck that Pakistan’s 27 February mission failed.\n\nWhether the Rafale deal is a scam or the best thing for India’s defence, people with greater eminence are fighting over. Let me, meanwhile, list four facts emerging from the 26-27 February air skirmishes to bring the story of what we can call the real Rafale scandal.\n\n* In the Rajouri-Mendhar sector air skirmish a day after the IAF’s successful Balakot strikes, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) was able to create surprise and local superiority—technological and numerical—in a chosen battlefield. It struck in daylight when least expected, and perfectly timed the changeover of IAF AWAC patrols. The outnumbered IAF pilots (12 aircraft of three vastly different types) scrambled from various bases showed the presence of mind not to walk into the ambush set for them. But they failed to deliver a deterrent punishment on PAF.\n\n* Four Sukhoi Su-30s, the IAF’s most powerful air-superiority aircraft, were involved in the melee at beyond visual range (BVR). They were surprised by the PAF F-16s firing their American AMRAAM missiles from so far that the Sukhois’ own radar/computer/missiles were not able to give them a “firing solution”. Translated: India’s best fighter, which constitutes half of IAF’s combat force, was outranged and outgunned.\n\n* Fortunately, two of the upgraded Mirage-2000s were on patrol. These have new French missiles (MICA, or Missile d’interception, de combat d’autodefense) which are the exact peers of the F-16/AMRAAM. They were able to lock-on to some of the PAF planes, which panicked into dropping their South African-origin stand-off weapons (SOWs) in a hurry, mostly missing the targets. Nevertheless, one fell in the middle of the Nowshera brigade headquarters compound. It was closer than we think.\n\n* Surprised, and outnumbered, the IAF scrambled six MiG-21 Bisons from Srinagar and Awantipur. Since these climbed in the shadow of the Pir Panjal range, the PAF AWAC failed to detect them. Their sudden appearance at the battlefield upset the PAF plan. This was fortuitous.\n\nIt is only because of IAF’s good training, situational awareness, and some luck that this audacious PAF mission failed. No ground target was hit. Its larger objective of luring vastly outnumbered and outranged IAF jets into a pre-set “killing zone” was the bigger failure.\n\nWhich brings us to our central question: Should we have even been having this conversation today if we had the military capability to match our economy (eight times Pakistan’s) and strategic ambition? 27 February reminded us that we don’t.\n\n\nIf we had a functional defence acquisition system, by now we would have built such a gap that Pakistan wouldn’t even dare a retaliation. Check out on a rarely-reported Mirage-2000 laser bomb raid to clear a Pakistani incursion across the LoC in the Machil sector in 2002. Forget retaliation, the Pakistanis pretended nothing had happened. Indian air-to-air missiles then, on both Mirage-2000s and MiG-29s, had better range than the PAF which ducked the challenge. Computers, radars and missiles decide the outcome in modern, mostly BVR, post-dogfight era air warfare.\n\n#How did India lose that edge?\n\nThis serial crime began under the Vajpayee government. In 2001, the IAF projected the need for a new fighter to replace the MiGs. Its choice was more Mirage-2000s. Dassault was willing to shift its production line to India, the IAF knew the plane and loved it. By this time, the IAF would have had 6-8 more squadrons of the upgraded, Made-in-India Mirages with new missiles. The Rafale would probably not even be needed so desperately. PAF wouldn’t have dared to carry out the 27 February raid, and if it did, it would have been mauled. But then, George Fernandes, smarting under Coffingate and Tehelka, refused to go with a ‘single-vendor’ deal. The full process for a new acquisition was launched.\n\nWe slept for a decade. The Pakistanis got their new F-16s and AMRAAM missiles from the US after 2010. Tactical balance in the air shifted. We, meanwhile, took until 2012 for a new fighter—Rafale—to be chosen. Except that wrapped-in-latex defence minister A.K. Antony wouldn’t take a decision. Three of his negotiation committee of 14 dissented, so he set up a committee above them. To ensure further delay, he set up another committee of three outside ‘monitors’ to supervise this committee. Like Sunny Deol’s “taareekh par taareekh”, Antony’s method was ‘committee par committee’. Finally, all inputs in, the choice was clear. Sure enough, Antony ducked again.\n\nHe has said three things at different times: Within the MoD, he then said, call fresh bids. To the media, he said he didn’t have headroom in the budget that year. And now, in a moment of self-serving pusillanimity, he told the media three weeks ago that he put off the deal in the “national interest” since two eminent persons, Subramanian Swamy and Yashwant Sinha, had written letters pointing out problems in the deal and he had ordered an inquiry. He has since refused to talk about these letters, even when chased by our reporter. The issue is too sensitive, he tells her. Chances are, his party knocked him on the head for nearly killing its Rafale story just to save his own neck. I would be pleasantly surprised if he talks about those letters again.\n\nThe earlier 126-aircraft MMRCA deal was dead by the time the NDA came in. The first wake-up call came early enough, with the Pathankot raid. As usual, the air forces were first off the blocks, and during aggressive patrolling, IAF realised the PAF’s range superiority. It’s an unwritten story yet, but some MICA missiles were bought overnight, slung on Mirages, which flew deliberately close enough for PAF to observe them. In the four years since, how many of our 40+ Mirages can even carry that missile? Don’t ask me for the truth because, as Jack Nicholson’s Marine Col. Nathan R. Jessep said in A Few Good Men, “you can’t face the truth”. Be grateful that those two on patrol on the morning of 27 February did.\n\nAs I had promised, I am telling you about the real Rafale scandal without mentioning the Rafale deal. The Vajpayee government wouldn’t buy additional Mirages, scared of touching a single-vendor order. The MICA missile had first been sought by the IAF in 2001, the first only came in 2015 when Pathankot shocked the MoD to pull the file down from ‘orbit’. Existing Mirages then had to be upgraded. Two were upgraded by Dassault. HAL said it would do the rest. How many has it done yet? I warned you, you can’t face the truth.\n\nThen it gets even more scandalous.\n\nHow did Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman cross the LoC? He was in visual pursuit of a PAF fighter for sure. But his controller was warning him to return. He didn’t. Because he couldn’t hear. As you’d expect in 2019, the battle zone had full radio-jamming. That’s why modern fighters have secure data links. Why didn’t that MiG have it? Ask the gallant Sir Humphrey of the MoD who blocked the purchase for three years claiming that a defence PSU would make it. Don’t ask me his name, find out. You might learn another truth you don’t want to face.\n\nThat order has lately been placed. With Israel. Soon enough, all IAF fighters will have this secure data link. And you’d die of shame, probably by jumping into the Yamuna’s stinking waters, when I tell you it is a purchase worth a mere Rs 630 crore, less than half the price of one Rafale. We were lucky to lose just one MiG that day.\n\nSource :[Wing Commander Abhinandan being shot down is the real Rafale scandal](https://theprint.in/opinion/the-factivist/wing-commander-abhinandan-being-shot-down-is-the-real-rafale-scandal/212399/)'<br />Author: 'yeloblu'  id: 'c3gbda'<br />Score:173<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c3gbda/wing_commander_abhinandan_being_shot_down_is_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: "A story map - India's River Linking Project"<br />Body: 'Text is derived from the original article found at the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rivers_Inter-link\n\n#India\'s River Linking Project\n\n\n\nThe Indian Rivers Inter-link is a proposed large-scale civil engineering project that aims to link Indian rivers by a network of reservoirs and canals and so reduce persistent floods in some parts and water shortages in other parts of India.\n\nThe Inter-link project has been split into three parts: Himalayan rivers inter-link component in north, Peninsular component in south, and starting 2005, an intrastate rivers linking component.\n\nThe project is being managed by India\'s National Water Development Agency (NWDA), under its Ministry of Water Resources. NWDA has studied and prepared reports on\n\n14 inter-link projects for Himalayan component,\n16 inter-link projects for Peninsular component and\n37 intra-state river linking projects.\n\n#Inception\n\nThe desirability of interlinking rivers was first visualized by a British engineer, Sir Arthur Cotton, who designed the provisions for linking Godavari and Krishna rivers. The idea was to speed up movement of import and export from the British colonies in South Asia and also to cater to water deficiency in south eastern India, now the state of Andhra Pradesh.\n\n \n\nPost Independence, Dr. K.L. Rao, a dam designer and former irrigation minister proposed "National Water Grid".\n\nThe river inter-linking idea was revived in 1999, after a new political alliance formed the central government, but this time with a major strategic shift.\n\n \n\nThe proposal was modified to intra-basin development as opposed to inter-basin water transfer.\n\n#The Need\n\n\nThere are two major reasons that warrant Water Resource Management in India:\n\nTo bring about a balance in the Flood and Drought prone areas:- Certain areas receive excessive rains as compared to others resulting in flood and drought conditions respectively, during the same period (i.e. the north-eastern region of the country receives heavy precipitation, in comparison with the north-western, western and southern parts).

      <li>Title::: "Excellent insights on India's River Linking Project with proper maps and"<br />Body: 'Text is derived from the original article found at the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rivers_Inter-link\n\n\n\nThe Indian Rivers Inter-link is a proposed large-scale civil engineering project that aims to link Indian rivers by a network of reservoirs and canals and so reduce persistent floods in some parts and water shortages in other parts of India.\n\nThe Inter-link project has been split into three parts: Himalayan rivers inter-link component in north, Peninsular component in south, and starting 2005, an intrastate rivers linking component.\n\nThe project is being managed by India\'s National Water Development Agency (NWDA), under its Ministry of Water Resources. NWDA has studied and prepared reports on\n\n14 inter-link projects for Himalayan component,\n16 inter-link projects for Peninsular component and\n37 intra-state river linking projects.\n\n#Inception\n\nThe desirability of interlinking rivers was first visualized by a British engineer, Sir Arthur Cotton, who designed the provisions for linking Godavari and Krishna rivers. The idea was to speed up movement of import and export from the British colonies in South Asia and also to cater to water deficiency in south eastern India, now the state of Andhra Pradesh.\n\n \n\nPost Independence, Dr. K.L. Rao, a dam designer and former irrigation minister proposed "National Water Grid".\n\nThe river inter-linking idea was revived in 1999, after a new political alliance formed the central government, but this time with a major strategic shift.\n\n \n\nThe proposal was modified to intra-basin development as opposed to inter-basin water transfer.\n\n#The Need\n\n\nThere are two major reasons that warrant Water Resource Management in India:\n\nTo bring about a balance in the Flood and Drought prone areas:- Certain areas receive excessive rains as compared to others resulting in flood and drought conditions respectively, during the same period (i.e. the north-eastern region of the country receives heavy precipitation, in comparison with the north-western, western and southern parts). So this project will give an effort to channelize the excess water, where it is actually needed for several primary uses, resuming a water balance across the country.\nWater Security across India:- In a tropical, agricultural economy like India, where monsoon plays an erratic role , water security can lead to food security for several irrigation purposes.

The Turkey Coup is the beginning of the end of the Great Game, as it is known. With Russia slipping out of their hands, the eyes were set on an unfathomably resource-rich country, which even after thousand years of non-stop plunder and looting still captures the imagination of one and all, thugs, thieves and robber-barons alike with her yet-unknown massive economic resources potential — that country is India. Are you aware that one of the key dimensions of the Strategic Defense Initiative required the reduction and degradation of Indian Army from a formidable and feared fighting force, capable of protecting the country from any threat, into a degenerate, fourth-grade and politicized institution? The main cause of the financial ruin in the interval between 2008 to 2012 was this currency manipulation, without any gold left to back it up. If the countries were not of European origin, they are all subjected to what we can now call as Gold Wars or Pipeline Wars in which Iraq and Libya were knocked out and promptly their gold-reserves were confiscated. The world is witnessing the similar brink-of-war situation with the other four powers. India in Cognitive Dissonance is an explosive hard-hitting myth-buster, a timely reminder for the decadent Indian society; a masterpiece on Geopolitics and International Relations from an Indian perspective.\n\n[sauce](https://notionpress.com/read/india-in-cognitive-dissonance)'<br />Author: 'sadhunath'  id: 'c37h48'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c37h48/has_anyone_read_india_in_cognitive_dissonance_by/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Did India's bad geopolitics contribute to 60 years of underdevelopment?"<br />Body: "Experts often put the blame on internal problems, like bad governance or bad economic policies, but there may be a large external factor we turn a blind eye on. \n\nThere's a theory that suggests that **all countries that are either allies or had a good relationship with the US in the postwar era enjoyed tremendous economic progress**. This includes Western Europe, Anglosphere, Japan, S. Korea, Israel and Gulf countries. To a smaller degree, this includes Mexico from 1994, China from 1972 and even Pakistan, especially from 1979 to 2011. \n\nIf you compare India vs Pakistan in many indicators, the differences are not so big. In fact Pakistan's GDP per capita (in dollar terms) was higher than India's till 2009. Perhaps its a major reason why the Pakistani military dared to go to war in 1999, something that I don't think is possible had they not been propped up by the invisible hand of Uncle Sam. \n\nIf the theory is true, then we can say that India made a strategic blunder by (loosely) aligning with the Soviet Union. It didn't directly cause the 60 years of backwardness, but it certainly aggravated the situation. **The opposite may also be true that one reason for India's rise today is because the US allows it to.**\n\nI understand that it's a very controversial statement to make.

BIOT: British Indian Ocean Territory, a dependency under the British Monarchy which includes Chagos Archepagalo (from Mauritius) and Aldabra, Farquhar and Desroches (from the Seychelles). They did this when Britain had to give freedom to both Seychelles and Mauritius in 60s.\n\n3. Deigo Garcia: The largest island in Chagos. Permanent military station operated by both US and UK. The UK allowed US to station a base because they needed some discount for purchasing polaris nuclear missile in 1971 under a treaty. The base hold heavy significance to both US and NATO as it acts as a launch pad for US forces into Asia, and was used heavily in Gulf, Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\n4. Forced depopulation of Deigo Garcia: Some 2000 natives living in D. Garcia were moved forcibly to Mauritius in 1966, and the entire island was depopulated.\n\nNow the interesting stuff,\n\n&gt; The islanders and their descendants, who now reside in Mauritius, the Seychelles, and the UK, have continually asserted their right to return to Diego Garcia\n\n&gt;On 11 May 2006, the English High Court ruled that a 2004 Order in Council preventing the Chagossians\' resettlement of the islands was unlawful, and consequently that the Chagossians were entitled to return to the outer islands of the Chagos Archipelago.\n\n&gt;According to a WikiLeaks disclosure document, in a calculated move in 2009 to prevent re-settlement of the BIOT by the Chagossians, the UK proposed that the BIOT become a "marine reserve" with the aim of preventing the former inhabitants from returning to the islands. The summary of the diplomatic cable is as follows:\n\n    HMG would like to establish a "marine park" or "reserve" providing comprehensive environmental protection to the reefs and waters of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), a senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) official informed Polcouns on 12 May. The official insisted that the establishment of a marine park – the world\'s largest – would in no way impinge on USG use of the BIOT, including Diego Garcia, for military purposes. He agreed that the UK and U.S. should carefully negotiate the details of the marine reserve to assure that U.S. interests were safeguarded and the strategic value of BIOT was upheld. He said that the BIOT’s former inhabitants would find it difficult, if not impossible, to pursue their claim for resettlement on the islands if the entire Chagos Archipelago were a marine reserve.'<br />Author: 'sadhunath'  id: 'c2twvj'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c2twvj/til_uk_to_prevent_natives_of_chagos_archepagalo/</li>

For example, we know from history that Animism was practiced all over Eurasia during the Middle Paleolithic and Neolithic era. During the Bronze age, polytheism became prevalent, especially the worship of Goddesses. Europe and the Middle East completely discarded these believes, but India **retained** them, or at least large elements of them.\n\nAnother example is India's wildlife. A lot of environmentalists are puzzled as to how a lot of large animals didn't go extinct in India, despite the dense population. Asiatic lions used to roam all over Eurasia, so did tigers, elephants and rhinos. One theory is that Indians always had a tradition of **conserving** the natural habitat that they inherited from their ancestors, since the hunter-gatherer days. \n\nI hope I managed to convince you that Indians have always been relatively more conservative than liberal.

      <li>Title::: 'A personal take on the West Bengal medico assault and its aftermath'<br />Body: "A personal take on the West Bengal medico assault and its aftermath\n\nIt's known that there is a fear of aggression from the patients' relatives in the minds of the doctors, especially among doctors serving in govt operated tertiary care centres. There are surveys out there indicating this. This is a poor situation, no doubt. Also, the working conditions there aren't that nice. So, how should this be addressed? The answer that immediately comes to the mind is - Government needs to do more, make workplace safer, put police out there in the wards to protect doctors from any possible physical harm while they do their job. This sounds plausible, but might be difficult to implement, as it entails placing manpower. So, what can be OK to implement and at the same time be effective. I have a suggestion (I welcome criticism), which is - government should pass a bill, an ordinance, per which anybody that gets physical with the care staff i.e, doctors, nurses, technicians, housekeeping etc, will not receive any medical treatment anywhere in the country going forward, in addition to punishment per penal provisions; that a database of such miscreants be created with a retrospective effect and be made available to all govt primary and tertiary care centres across the country for perusal, and that patients/relatives of patients need to sign an undertaking of no-mischief while seeking registration and treatment at any govt hospital. All this with immediate effect. This may have some effect in alleviating the fear from the minds of doctors, doctors who're no other people but us. This should make their workplace a little tension free. This is my suggestion. I can't think of any other effective measure save this.\n\nNow, taking a deeper look at the incident, we see that the assault was perceived as an assault on every working doctor out there irrespective of location. Solidarity poured in from all corners of the medical fraternity and equally in measure from the general public, as well. This should be proof enough to doctors out there that the public at large are reasonable people who empathize with any victim of violence anywhere, more so when it's a medico. This should be a morale booster for aspiring medicos in our country. Now, medicos, too, need to be careful before engaging in strikes because a good number of innocent people suffered as a consequence. Some deaths, too, seem to have occurred on account of this. Again, they're intelligent people, and we should leave things to their own better judgment.\n\nA totally personal opinion on the medical profession: Doctors are not God. Yes. Doctors sacrifice a lot to become qualified professionals. Agree. They have no personal life. Agree. Doctors attend work at odd hours. Yes. But, there are certain things that need to be acknowledged in the same spirit and at the same time. Amongst the lakhs of doctors in this country, only a handful ever chose willfully to serve people in some remote place. There're just a few who solely desired to serve humanity. For the majority, it always is/was a good choice of career. Agreed that they're human beings, and they've their own aspirations, but nobody's denying that, ever. People are free to do per their own free will. But, no doctor occupies a pedestal just by virtue of being one. I'll rate a social worker higher to a salaried doctor any day, for obvious reasons. That doctors save lives; yes, and again it's the doctors exactly who tell me that CPR works only 5 times out of 100. Yes, it's a noble profession, but I see nobleness in only a scant few, the majority are simply professionals. That they make us feel better; yes, but if it's only at a payment, then I don't see any greatness in it. I absolutely have a soft corner for some doctors at govt hospitals who do a tremendous job treating the poor and the uneducated. Have seen it with my own eyes. But, not all of them though.\n\nIt's the level of humanity inside a qualified doctor that makes him eligible for greatness. Just being so never does. If we are to condemn violence, let's condemn violence on everybody, everywhere. Why limit it just to doctors. The injured intern has my sympathies, but so do all the people who do risky jobs. Doctors should acknowledge the fact that people personally thank them for doing their job, a monetary consideration notwithstanding, and there are people out there who do hazardous, thankless jobs but live in penury and obscurity.\n\nMad respect to all the people, among them to the physicians and surgeons especially, who serve humanity irrespective of stature and place.

      <li>Title::: 'Mission Hospitals: Serving the poor does not give someone agency to alter religious beliefs'<br />Body: "Context: Mission Hospitals are one of the forces for good in the country - health care wise. Providing excellent care at affordable prices, these are often staffed by christian doctors and staff who have been trained well, and plan to accessible health care to those who are often poor to afford it.\n\nThere exists an undercurrent of religion intruding upon the nature of work/ care provided. These are often devout Christians, and strongly profess their faith, at work and at home, often citing successful procedures and outcomes to God. While that is admirable, what is  not is their preaching of God during rounds. Religious views should not be price for the quality care provided. And often, these poor people, who have been chronically suffering from some disease, get better, they kind of attribute it to the God residing in that hospital. And sometimes convert. Now that is their choice, but it was done in an underhanded way. \n\nThis had happened inadvertently to me. There was this extremely poor patient who had come with necrotising fasciitis for weeks. He didn't have money to afford food - as being a daily wage worker, if he didn't work, he couldn't earn. i admitted him for two months, treated him for free, and he went home walking. A month later, he came back for follow up, and proudly stated that he had adopted Christianity because he was convinced that God had answered my prayers over his wounds. \\[ I used to pray to God to guide my hands while doing debridement\\]. I was beyond horrified, as that wasn't the intention with which i had prayed. And that set me thinking.\n\nTLDR\n\nProvide Medical Care, not faith.\n\nReligious Discussions only if the patient asks, not before that.\n\nFaith is not the leverage for providing care. It's part of the healing process. My God answers my prayers is no justification."<br />Author: 'LibConLibCon'  id: 'c2elxh'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c2elxh/mission_hospitals_serving_the_poor_does_not_give/</li>

With this the total number of senior tax officials shown the door has gone up to 27 in eight days. All the officials are from the Indian Revenue Service.\n\nThe last set of officials told to retire was from the Income Tax Department, while this time, senior officials with ranks such as Principal Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner, dealing with indirect taxes, have been asked to leave.\n\nAccording to the Finance Ministry, these officials are Anup Srivastava *(Principal Commissioner)*, Atul Dikshit *(Commissioner)*, Sansar Chand *(Commissioner)*, G Sree Harsha *(Commissisoner)*, Vinay Brij Singh *(Commissioner)* and ten others.\n\n# Rule 56\n\n* Orders issued by the Finance Ministry have quoted clause J of rule 56 of the Fundamental Rules. Based on this rule, the President retires these officials with immediate effect.\n* Rule 56 covers Group ‘A &amp; B’ officers who entered service before 35 years of age and have attained 50 years of age.\n* A review is carried out on a quarterly basis, including of officials and employees facing serious allegations of corruption. If the review committee finds the allegations to be true, it recommends compulsory retirement and the order is then signed by the President.\n* The compulsorily retired officials will be paid a sum equivalent to their pay and allowances for thee months, calculated at the same rate at which s/he was drawing them immediately before retirement.\n* Such an action is considered as a penalty and the government believes that it will act as a deterrent for others flirting with corruption.\n* At present, the retirement age is 60 years. The loss of 10 years of service means loss in terms of the benefits and perks for that period and, more importantly, a lifelong loss of honour.\n\n# CBI cases\n\nThere are serious charges against these officials. For example, according to sources-\n\n* The CBI registered a case against Principal Commissioner Anup Srivastava alleging that he had entered into a criminal conspiracy to favour a realtor and obtain illegal gratification.\n* Another case against the Principal Commissioner by the CBI alleges bribery by an importer to cover up a case of duty evasion. Srivastava was arrested in 2012 and subsequently released on bail.\n* Similarly, there are two CBI cases against Commissioner Atul Dixit and he was under suspension. \n* Sansar Chand, G Sree Harsha and Vinay Brij Singh also face CBI cases.\n* Others being prosecuted by the central investigative agency are Additional Commisoners Ashok R Mahida, Virendra Agarwal and Raju Sekar, Deputy Commissioners Amresh Jain and Ashok Aswal, Joint Commisioner Nalin Kumar, and Assistant Commissioners SS Pabana, SS Bisht, and Ashok Aswal.\n* Assistant Commissioner Vinod Sanga faces charges related to the clearance of two consignments of over-invoiced goods without making efforts to ascertain the correct market value of the goods and drawing samples despite there being specific instructions regarding verification of the declared value and examination of the packets.\n* Assistant Commissioner Mohammed Altaf is alleged to be the mastermind and investor in smuggling of Red Sanders in two cases.\n\n[Source](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/policy/crackdown-on-corruption-govt-sacks-15-customs-central-excise-officers/article28064941.ece)'<br />Author: 'RevenantPanda'  id: 'c2bpcy'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c2bpcy/15_more_senior_tax_officials_forced_into/</li>

It challenges India to produce "unequivocal  evidence" and not merely claim it won the match yesterday.\n\nNDTV has supported Pakistan\'s claim.\n\nManishankar Aiyer claimed in fact Pakistan won the match. \n\nArundhati Roy has claimed that whilst Prima Facie there is no evidence that India defeated Pakistan,  if it did so,  it was a gross violation of the rights of innocent Pakistanis.  She plans to go to International Human Rights Commission for getting this investigated. \n\nShashi Tharoor has said it is an "exasperating farrago of distortions, misrepresentations &amp; outright lies being broadcast by an unprincipled showman masquerading as a journalist". When the journalist tried to search for the meaning of Tharoor\'s words, the computer crashed .  \n\nNidhi Razdan meanwhile ousted Sambit Patra from the debate when he claimed that Pakistan lost the match. \n\nRavish Kumar could not be seen since the screen was kept black in mourning \n\nKejriwal said that if Pakistan lost,  it was probably due to "hacking of the scoreboard" and challenged ICC to have a rematch.    \n\nPrashant Bhushan plans to take this to Supreme Court at around 2 am. \n\nSarfaraz was asked about the match. All he could say was: "The boys played well". \n\nRahul Gandhi said he would have to analyze the results and meditate before commenting. He is going to Bangkok for a month for the same purpose. \n\nAkhilesh Yadav,  when asked about the match first wanted to know how many players from Gujarat were in the winning team.  \n\nArun Jaitley directly described the win as a result of demonetisation.\n\nAmit Shah said this win is another proof that the people wanted BJP government in 2019. \n \nYogi Adityanath said Pakistan lost because it ate beef. \n\nTrump has sent a confusing tweet congratulating India.  It strangely reads: "Covfefe"\n\nA correspondent, tried to contact Arnab Goswami to know his reaction.

      <li>Title::: "Chad Narendra Modi's best Hits from 2002"<br />Body: 'Power hungry people are out to defame Gujarat. At such a time, the five crore people of Gujarat will gain strength from the blessings of Becharaji to build tomorrow’s glorious Gujarat.\n\nWe are dubbed Hinduwadi because we have allocated Rs eight crore towards the development of Becharaji. Is it our fault? Are we communal?\n\nThe Congress also accuses me of bringing the Narmada waters to the Sabarmati river in the month of Shravan. But the dam has already been built... **I want to ask the Congress, why do you object if people on the banks of the Sabarmati derive spiritual peace through the Narmada waters brought in the month of Shravan? When you come to power, you are free to bring water during Ramzan.**\n\nWhen we allocate funds for Becharaji, they do not like it. And if we bring Narmada waters in the month of Shravan, then too they say they dislike it. ***So what should we do? Do we go and run relief camps? Should we open child producing centres?***\n\n**We want to firmly implement family planning. Hum paanch, humare pachees (We five, our 25) (laughs).*" Who will benefit from this development? Is family planning not necessary in Gujarat? Where does religion come in its way? Where does community come in its way?\n\nThe population is rising in Gujarat, money isn’t reaching the poor? **What’s the reason? They make a beeline, fix cycle punctures (Audience laughs).**\n\nIf Gujarat is to be developed, then an economic system has to be developed where every child born in Gujarat gets education, manners and employment. **And for this, those who are multiplying population at a rapid rate will need to learn a lesson.** If we object to population growth, then too they dislike it. Will someone please tell me is there any (such) country in the world? Is there BJP rule in China? Yet, China has enacted laws to control population growth. Arrey, what does religion have to do with this?\n\n**We talk of madrasas. Madrasas have flourished in Gujarat. A child has a right to primary education. But a child going to a madrasa is deprived of primary education. What will such a child do once he grows up?**\n\n**Those who have got no education, and got only religious education, would they not become a burden on Gujarat?**\n\nWe started thinking about madrasas in Gujarat. When we express concern over madrasas, they call us communal. Why? The Communist government in West Bengal applies laws in madrasas, curbs their activities, and it is still secular? And if we try to regulate madrasas in Gujarat, we are dubbed as communal? After all, any institution has to be regulated.\n\n**If Gujarat needs peace, a long-term plan has to be drawn. The merchants of death will not be allowed to run their activities in Gujarat as they like.**\n\nAnd as I sit here at this seat of strength, standing at the feet of mother Becharaji, I want to assure you that the high seat (of power) may go today or tomorrow, but **I will not allow the merchants of death who want to destroy Gujarat and harass the innocents to settle here.**\n\nGujarat needs prosperity, it needs peace. Gujarat is forging ahead on the unity and strength of its five crore people. **The days are gone when Dawood Ibrahim sitting in Karachi could instruct the merchants of death here and Gujarat could be set on fire. We will not allow this.**\n\nWhat for? For power? Power may go today or tomorrow. We have not applied Fevicol on the chair. We are sitting at the feet of the people of Gujarat. If people feel we are performing, they will welcome us, otherwise they will throw us out.\n\nIf the Congress is afraid of going to the people, then they should come out openly and say that since they are sure of their defeat, the election should be delayed. Indira Gandhi had done it too. You do it, who’s stopping you?\n\nBut no, they abuse Gujarat and Gujaratis instead. If you abuse Gujarat, that is not acceptable to us. Come out openly and give us a fight if you are strong enough. Why do you escape instead?\n\nIt is I who has been defamed. Yet, I am ready to go to the people. You go straight to Italy, plead with the Election Commission to stop polls. But we are not like you, we are proud of approaching the people. We take pride in applying the dust from people’s feet onto our foreheads.\n\nItaly’s daughter has insulted Gujarat and its five crore people. The land of Sardar Patel is insulted. This has got to be explained. Sanjay (Gandhi) was only Maneka’s husband. Yet, it is his samadhi that lies in Delhi, not that of Sardar Patel. The Congress is out to erase Sardar Patel’s name, but beware\n\nSource - https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/should-we-run-relief-camps-open-child-producing-centres/217398'<br />Author: 'panditji_reloaded'  id: 'c1zdi9'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c1zdi9/chad_narendra_modis_best_hits_from_2002/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Caught between animosities, India is increasingly losing sight for its potential for greatness'<br />Body: ' \n\nThe Constitution of India is one of the most impressive (a)political documents in the world. Drawing from the best(at that particular time) of ideologies around the world, it was condensed succinctly into easy, explainable words, generalised as to ensure flexibility, which evolves with the social and political climate of the times. And inclusiveness has been an integral part of Bharat since the Vedic society. The caste system was a product of the times, but wasn\'t something enforced on people of other beliefs as they came into contact with the indigenous community of the subcontinent. The use of the term Hinduism to describe a collection of practices and beliefs is a recent European construction, the term "Hindu" was coined in position to other religions and used to describe those that were not of the other religions. Before the British began to categorise communities strictly by religion, Indians generally did not define themselves exclusively through their religious beliefs; identities were segmented on the basis of locality, language, caste, occupation and sect. Initially referring to the geographical area beyond the Indus river, it gained popularity as catch all for the purpose of description rather than understanding. The core tenet of Dharma - a way of life - is much broader than the term religion gives it credit for. Because of the wide range of traditions and ideas covered by the term Hinduism, arriving at a comprehensive definition is difficult. It defies desire to define and categorize it, and to grossly understates the spectrum of beliefs - polytheistic, pantheistic, panentheistic, pandeistic, henotheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic or humanist - which exist within it. And since these "Hindus" were tolerant of other beliefs being practised alongside theirs , because of the wide spectrum amongst themselves as a whole, it became known as a land for tolerance. People often use the justification that Hindus never waged war - that idea is incorrect. They waged war on each other - motivated by money, resources to name a few, and since there are formidable barriers to accessing the subcontinent - rivers, mountains,seas, deserts, it was relatively self contained. Invasions happen because of two primary motivations - lack or resources in the current place and abundance of resources in another. And they waged war over it and won. And since now the invaders had control over the source of the resource, they set about strengthening their hold, and introduced new belief systems into the subjugated region. Some people may have found the concept of a singular, non anthropomorphic God attractive, we can\'t say for sure. Maybe forced conversions took place. All we know is that a new faith entered the previously mono religious subcontinent. Similarly, the European came searching for trade routes, and established them. Differing ideologies came into contact and they gradually took over overtly waging war under the guise of carefully crafted reasons. The reasons people tend to discard old beliefs is (grossly)ABC. It\'s gives Assurances that salvation is achievable through Belief in a precise theology, and that Conversion will infact let them lead better life. By the time 1947 cane around, there is a multitide of Faith\'s co- exsisting in the subcontinent. The forefathers of the Constitution knew better than to oust "new" religions just because they were new. That\'s why generalised open terminologies to ensure inclusiveness were inscribed. And it\'s only been modified by addition, and not subtraction - because subtraction takes away the inclusiveness. With Liberals bemoaning the increasingly unsafe environment propagated by Conservatives who are demanding that people of other religions leave them be, there is fault in both sides. Someone in the present cannot be held responsible for what atrocities happened in the past, and that doesn\'t give you the right to prosecute them for not believing in your "idea" of God. These perceived injustices in both sides cannot be what defines the nation today. Because all it will lead is to attrition. The world has become a much smaller place and is both better and worse for it. As a nation predominantly populated by "Hindu\'s" the aim should be aiming for inclusiveness not exclusiveness. For example, the matter of consumption of cow meat. Slaughter of animals was frowned upon in Hinduism, but wasn\'t not mandatory. Non violence applied to all animals equally. Gandhi once said: "I worship it and I shall defend its worship against the whole world", and stated that "The central fact of Hinduism is cow protection." Yet even Gandhi never called for the banning of cow slaughter in India. Stating “How can I force anyone not to slaughter cows unless he is himself so disposed? It is not as if there were only Hindus in the Indian Union. There are Muslims, Parsis, Christians and other religious groups here.” Now The slaughter of cattle is allowed with restrictions (like a \'fit-for-slaughter\' certificate which may be issued depending on factors like age and gender of cattle, continued economic viability, etc.), but only for bulls and buffaloes and not cows in fourteen states. It is completely banned in six states with pending litigation in the supreme court to overturn the ban, while there is no restriction in many states. To act in rumours and blind belief without allowing for explanations or the legal process to investigate, and by taking matters into our own hands, we are fostering a aura of intolerance and fear mongering , which inevitably leads to conflict as the oppressed section will eventually respond to continued denigration. And liberals are no better . If they are so intelligent, and better off than the conservatives, why haven\'t they made the great strides they profess to achieve in the years when a predominantly liberal government was at the helm. That does not give the conservatives an out. The liberals failed. You have the opportunity to do better. Do not state the failures of previous thought processes as your reason for your lack of success. A fresh start is your hands. The rise of jingoism is a dangerous precedent. It promotes vigilantism and is violated the sense of security a nation should provide it\'s citizens. Live your life as you would see fit. You wouldn\'t appreciate someone forcing their belief on you. They wouldn\'t either. As a country we can only grow upwards of we set aside our differences to work together. Both are in the right. And both are in the wrong. Trust is a two way street. And we have to meet halfway for this to work. Otherwise all that remains will be mutual distrust, and that will be harmful to the potential greatness of this country as a land for inclusiveness and harmony, not not as a ground for distrust and despair.\n\nEDIT: People might say why I speak about Hinduism extensively, but as the predominant faith of the region, it has a responsibility towards other beliefs, which is why it matters.'<br />Author: 'LibConLibCon'  id: 'c1b402'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c1b402/caught_between_animosities_india_is_increasingly/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Here's some basic background about Purbiya (Eastern UP and Western Bihar Brahmins and Rajputs) Warriors"<br />Body: "I wanted to write this for a long time but I didn't know where to start or where to write this. This all started when I read a blog written by someone about how Brahmins never had empires or kingdoms of their own and how they weren't warriors ever in history. All one needs to do is make a Google search for every Brahmin empire and dynasty in history. These Brahmin kingdoms existed in Afghanistan as well. But, here's a perspective from the point of view of the legendary Purbiyas. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo begin with, the term Purbiya originated in medieval India. It's used as a term to refer to mercenaries belonging to Brahmin or Rajput castes from Central and Eastern UP and Western Bihar. Throughout the medieval and early modern period, these were among the preferred groups of fighting men, that mansabdars, Wazirs, Rajas and Emperors recruited. These men were land owning Brahmins and Rajputs. The Brahmins specifically, did not do priestly or scholarly work, and preferred to fight for the right fee. They were recognised for their good physique. Boasting an average height of 5 feet 8 inches, rather impressive given their time period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese men were proficient warriors and presumably they were taught the art of war from their family members i.e fathers, uncles and brothers. These men were proficient with firearms, bow and arrow, swords and were an equal to the Western Rajputs on horseback. There are several accounts of Purbiya soldiers holding their ground against Sikh, Western Rajput and Afghan armies. They were revered and recruited for this martial skill. \n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purbiya\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Brahmins among this Purbiya group gained specific prominence during the establishmeny of the Bengal Presidency, by the East India Company. The Bengal Presidency raised the Bengal Army. Within this Bengal army, the demographic composition gives us a glimpse of the image of a martial race these Brahmins had in the eyes of the British.\n\n\n\n\n\n40% of this army was Brahmin\n\n\n\n\n20% Rajput\n\n\n\n\n\n20% Indian Muslims (Shia and Sunni)\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd a sprinkling of others, barring the Dalits or SC/St communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.amritworld.com/main/?p=563#sthash.C60jsHFz.ttbHHmTr.dpbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.indiandefencereview.com/interviews/soldiers-the-rajput-and-brahman/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Bengal Army even had a 1st Brahamans Regiment. This was the army that subdued the Marathas, Sikhs, Mysore, Nepal and Burma. They fought the Opium wars and the Afghan Wars. They were the ones who went on military expeditions throughout the country defeating one army and empire after the other. They had a history of engagements spanning nearly two centuries and the entire Indian subcontinent and beyond. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese regiments and this army, was the army that revolted in 1857, which eventually led to the downfall of the Purbiya Brahmins in the Presidency Armies. Eventually, by the end of the Word War 1, most of the army was disbanded, the names of the regiments changed. The contemporary historians, perhaps consciously, sideswept this side of history to proclaim the Brahmins the ultimate exploiters and to propagate the image of a pot bellied priest, living off of dakshina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Brahmans\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_Native_Infantry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_Army\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI suggest you read the aforementioned articles and pages in full, to get an in depth understanding of the topic."<br />Author: 'MujheBawasirHai'  id: 'c1a574'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c1a574/heres_some_basic_background_about_purbiya_eastern/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'What are the possibilities of India turning into an authoritarian dystopian nation? [Debate]'<br />Body: "As the titles says, what the the chances of India becoming into any form of dystopia in this century?\n\nMy argument:\n\n1. Our world already has a couple of dystopian nations (China and N.K.), in both these nations, people are living in an alternate reality, they are totalitarian in nature and have gone through too much brain washing to really be considered as people with any amount of 'free will'. If I was never aware of these nations, I would have never believed that a dystopian nation would be possible, but now that these two exist, I do have some amount of fear that things might go wrong in other countries too. \nHaving said that, China and NK managed to become totalitarian because they had complete control over all information when the respective regimes came to power, which doesn't really seem possible in today's day and age. If you look at Europe or India or U.S. the level of freedom of expression (information) is enough to counter any attempt by a totalitarian regime to control information flow.\n\n2. Diversity - If you look at some of the dystopian ideas, whether it is Leila or anything else. they were all surrounding one core ideology that was not questionable by the masses. There is no such ideology in India. A lot of leftists make the mistake of condensing everything about Bharat to 'Manu', whereas I and many Indians and Hindus have neither heard of Manu for most of their lives, nor consider him to be a driving factor in our ideological space. Hinduism itself has its roots in questioning everything. So if there are people who want a totalitarian ideology, they will not have the support of quite a large chunk of the society. India has a very rich culture of practicing and tolerating diverse ideologies. \n3. Human beings, at least most of them in India, have financial wellbeing as their top priority. People are just too busy working their asses off to eek out a living, buy a house, run a family etc. It is very difficult to imagine a vast majority of people focusing on actively working towards building a totalitarian nightmare. There is always a section of society, be it Hindus, Christians, Muslims or anybody else, who would dream about building a state like that, but they are far too few and far less powerful to achieve anything like that.\n\nHaving said that, there are a few things to look out for, to absolutely make sure we don't end up becoming a dystopian nightmare.\n\n1. Introduce critical thinking in schools, let children in ALL schools explore different philosophical concepts from around the world. Build the education system in such a way that it will allow every individual to develop their own thought process.\n\n2. Government should completely disassociate itself from religion (maybe even caste). \n\n3. Religion should disassociate itself from education. Brainwashing kids from a very early age just feels inhuman. It takes away the ability of an individual to look at the world from a fresh new perspective, it is really sad that this is still being allowed.\n4. Technology education should become an integral part of education system. It is simple, you can sensor a nation if everybody knows how to use a VPN. If proper basics of computer science and electronics are taught to everyone in the country, if everybody has the know how to rig a raspberry pi and connect to a VPN, it would be impossible for anyone to have absolute flow over control of information.\n\nMy writing skills suck, so I might not have been very succinct.

This stand was taken to maximize revenues so that metro fares could be kept low so as to be affordable to ordinary citizens at the same time metro would make sufficient operational surpluses to pay back the loans taken from *JAICA*. This stand of Delhi metro was greatly appreciated by all including the then PM Shri Atal Bihar Vajpayee ji...even officers and staff including the managing director of *DMRC*, when they travel on the metro on official duties purchase tickets.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If ladies are to be given free travel concession in Delhi metro, it would set an alarming precedence to all other metros in the country. The argument of Delhi government that the revenue losses would be reimbursed to *DMRC* is a poor solace. The amount involved is about 1000 crore per annum today.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Succeeding governments of Delhi will not be able to play this subsidy. What is worse, once concession is given to one section of the commuters, immediate demands will arise from more deserving sections such as students, handicapped, senior citizen etc. The disease will spread fast to all other metros in the country making them dependent on state governments for subsidies  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I would earnestly request you not to agree to the Delhi government’s proposal of free travel to ladies in the metro. If Delhi government is so keen to help lady commuters, I would suggest Delhi government can pay directly to the lady commuters the cost of their travel rather than make travel free on the metro\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-sos-to-pm-modi-metro-man-sreedharan-asks-him-to-reject-aap-s-free-ride-plan/story-OEqCjEarJ6rqL007iikgJN.html)'<br />Author: 'RevenantPanda'  id: 'c0o4y5'<br />Score:49<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c0o4y5/disease_will_spread_metro_man_e_sreedharan_asks/</li>

You sure its not the 500,000 soldiers you have stationed there?\n\nReading comprehension clearly is at about grade 3 for you. I specifically said "social spending, excluding military". \n\nPlease first show me the resources the Indian govt is stealing from Kashmir. \n\n&gt;India loves to blame their internal issues on Pakistan, hell, even an Indian news show was talking about Pakistan \'sending hot weather to India\', usually Indian claims of Pakistani involvement are baseless, nevertheless, the "jihadis" are pretty much rebels fighting back to reach their objective and prevent their women from being raped and killed among other things.\n\nLol this is such a weak and pathetic argument, but still I will humour you. \n\nThese are the currently active Jihadi terror groups in Kashmir. \n\nAs the HuM and its splinter groups is one of the largest Jihadi terror outfit let us look at its leaders,\n\n* Maulana Masood Azhar, Sajjad Afghani - Both Pakis (later is "Azad Kashmiri"), fought in Afghanistan under Gulbudin Hekmatiyar, then Afghani briefly fought in Chechnya before settling on terror in India\n\n* Nasarullah Manzoor Langaryal - Paki, was even a Paki spec ops operator, before becoming a Jihadi. He was arguably the only leader of this group to have actually been based in India (aside from Azhar that is) and was shot dead for his efforts.\n\n* Maulana Saadatullah Khan - Paki again.\n\nSo, the largest terror group in Kashmir, the HuM and its splinter group HuA and whatever variant it is in now was founded in Pakistan, by Pakistanis and Algerian Arabs and since then headed by Pakistanis and Arabs. Not one Indian leader of this group thus far.\n\nThe CIA in its various reports has clearly established its linkage with ISI. This was even documented in the Australian Parliament. DO search “Information on Jamiat ul-Ansar (JuA) for the Review of the re-listing of Abu Sayyaf Group, Jamiat ul-Ansar and Al-Qa’ida in Iraq" in the Australian parliament website and you will get  a full list of citations.\n\n[CIA reports](http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2014/08/harakat-ul-mujahidee.php)\n\n* LeT - Founded by Hafiz Saeed in Pakistan, HQ\'d in Pakistan and funded by Pakistan. His second in command, Abdul Rahman Makki is also a Paki. The chief planner of 26/11, Zarrar Shah also Paki, was the pointsman for ISI. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123068308893944123](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123068308893944123) that is just one source, from Wikileaks to public MI6 and CIA reports have all established this linkage. The co-founder of this group was Zafar Iqbal, a Paki....again. [LeT has deep ties with the ISI](https://www.scribd.com/doc/70694522/Pakistan-Violence-Versus-Stability). HQ in Muridke Pakistan. \n\n* JeM- Splinter of HuM started by Mazood Azhar who it is already established is a Paki. The JuM itself splintered into the Jamaat-Ul-Furqan, headed by another Paki by the name Abdul Jabbar. [A declassified DIA report establishing its ISI linkages](https://www.dia.mil/FOIA/FOIA-Electronic-Reading-Room/FOIA-Reading-Room-Pakistan/FileId/104756/). HQ in Bawahalpur Pakistan. \n\n* Al Badr - Founded by one Arfeen Bhai, he is also a...gasp, Paki. His chief commander was Bakt Zameen, another Paki. [This outfit does not just have links to the ISI, but has had ISI officers involved in its operations directly](https://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/jandk/terrorist_outfits/Al_badr.htm). HQ in Rawalpindi with a branch office in Karachi. This received a lot of volunteers from the Hizb-e-Islami Mujh group which fought in Afghanistan. \n\n* Al Umar Mujahideen - Founded by Mushtaq Zargar, he is the first and arguably only Indian Kashmiri to found a Jihadi outfit. He did escape India and has been living in Muzzafarbad from 2000 onwards, so am guessing by now he is also a naturalised Paki. However, he too [received all his training and arms in Pakistan](https://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/jandk/terrorist_outfits/Al_Umar.htm), so you could argue that only his nationality was Indian. \n\n* Lashkar-e-Jhangvi - Founded by Messrs Riaz Basra (Paki) and Malik Ishaq (Paki), they were also back ended by the ISI till they declared allegiance with the SSP and then went off the deep end as far as the ISI was concerned when the massacred 100 Shias and attacked the Sri Lankan team in Lahore. Both were then killed by the Pakistani police.  HQ somewhere in the vague frontier in FATA province, possibly on the Afghan side. Current leader is Akram Lahori....a Paki.\n\n* JKLF - Kashmiri outfit, founded by Kashmiris, with Jihadi volunteers from Chechnya to Saudi Arabia, but defunct now. \n\n* HuM- The only remaining Kashmiri outfit per se.\n\nSo....of the 10 odd outfits and 25 odd leaders who formed these outfits, 7 were founded in Pakistan and some 22 of the leaders are a mix of Pakis, Arabs, Algerians, Chechens and a Saudi. Of the 10, only 1 is still based in India, the rest all have always been based out of Pakistan with one possibly based out of Afghanistan. \n\nJust from 2001-2016, [some 7,000 Jihadis have been infilitrated in from Pakistan](https://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/jandk/data_sheets/infilnew.htm).

      <li>Title::: 'Why I will never trust Mr. Arvind Subramanian'<br />Body: "Many might know. The media is going full on about Arvind Subramanian, the former Chief Economic Advisor of PM Modi and his suggestion about the GDP numbers.\n\nNow, I'm no economist and might not be even 1% aware about economy as much as an expert might like Arvind Subramanian might know. However, I still don't trust him. Why, because it's not about capability but it's about credibility.\n\nI will like to mention few reasons why Arvind Subramanian is one of the reasons behind the economic problems of the country. Now this is what I have gathered from reading but I cannot give specific evidence so take it as my opinion.\n\n**Demonetisation**\n\nWhen demonetisation happened, there were talks about the planning of demonetisation being aware only to a few people. There were strong suggestions that Arvind Subramanian was in the people who were part of the planning of demonetisation. It's also said that Rajan was not in favor but Arvind was. Even if you ignore the rumors, it's almost impossible that the Chief Economic Advisor of PM Modi would not be aware or made part of such a big thing. Years later, Arvind Subramanian came out and says that he was never made aware about it. How can the PM's go to man for economy doesn't have any idea whatsoever that something massive is being considered that might change the economy. How did not even get a sniff of it while working with Modi and his close associates. How is it even possible.\n\nBut it doesn't stop at that. During demonetisation, Arvind Subramanian came and defended it. He, [in his economic survey said](https://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/what-ex-cea-subramanian-says-on-note-ban-now-what-he-said-earlier/articleshow/66880909.cms), shortly put, that demonetisation has good long term benefits that will help the country. A year or two later, his term completed and the government or he himself decided not to renew his term. 6 months after his term completes, the same Arvind Subramanian who had good words for it on his paper, suddenly writes a book and calls demonetisation a draconian act which troubled people. How so Mr. Subramanian. How can something which you called great in your survey, which the government relies on, suddenly become draconian when you leave the office. If the government asked you to say good things about it, then you should have showed your credibility and come out with the truth. Either you lied then or are lying later or admit that your work of the economic survey was not credible. Thing is, it was your survey which the public and government studied and if you were wrong in it then you did nothing but to misguide the people.\n\n**GST**\n\nGST. One of the biggest pains for the businesses in this country. But many in the know-how would know that GST was not going to be this hard.\n\nThose aware about how VAT used to work would know that in VAT, each bills, both from the buyers side and sellers side, needed to match, rupee by rupee, even if the person is a common retailer with no computer in his business, each and every rupee should match in VAT. This made VAT quite hard to follow for everyone. Came in the proposal of GST, where sellers upload the bills and buyers just need to approve them, with government unaware that those who were never used to VAT and it's problems were suddenly introduced to GST and they were never going find it easy, as it was based on the improvement of VAT, unaware that VAT itself was so flawed that even if it's improvement called GST, when implemented on the national scale would still be flawed. Still, a lot of changes and improvements were made to it.\n\nGST was also going to be great for businesses for other reasons. Tax rates. In VAT, businesses were already tired in bifurcating two different tax rates. Everyone, including the businesses thought that GST, which was called one nation one tax would fix this problems. Then came in Arvind Subramanian.\n\nArvind Subramanian was highly bent that GST was going to increase the already tremendously decreased inflation (due to demonetisation). He felt that poor will be effected by the inflation after GST and it's single tax rate. Then he came up with the idea of having different tax slabs in GST. For him, the single greatest thing to prevent GST from having problems was to have multiple tax slabs, not two, but 5 of them. Those who might have seen him giving his vision of multiple tax slabs in GST would know how for him, it was one of the greatest of his suggestions and how he was so defensive about it.\n\nBut was it great. People who saw GST as one nation one tax were left in bad mood after multiple slab announcement. There were jokes made on the slogan. Businesses who were already tired by two slabs in VAT, had their work tremendously increased after GST, so did the accountants and CA's work. People were confused and still are about multiple tax slabs. GST which was aimed for easing of indirect taxation in this country, had an opposite effect, just because Mr. Arvind Subramanian had a great idea. Those who doubt upon it being his idea need to go through his speech about it. It also decreased the already decreased inflation further, hurting the capital of the country further.\n\nThe question on his credibility doesn't come from there. But it comes after he left the post. Again, months later he comes with an excuse that [government didn't follow *his* suggestions](https://www.aninews.in/videos/national/gst-could-have-been-better-my-initial-recommendations-former-cea-arvind-subramanian/) for GST. Is he joking. He was widely regarded as the brainchild behind it's so called implementation. Then he comes and says his suggestions were not followed.\n\nIt doesn't stop there. In his tenure, he used to come with one after another suggestions for GST. The suggestions which made GST, an already flawed implementation, more miserable. Infact, it was only after him leaving the post did we have even better improvements to the GST.\n\n**GDP**\n\nComing to the GDP data where all of this controversy comes from. In his paper, Arvind Subramanian writes that governments, both UPA-2 and NDA overestimated the GDP data. He blames this a lot on the new method of counting of GDP introduced during the UPA-2 era and lack of granular data.\n\nHow can Arvind Subramanian, who was in charge of the Chief Economic Advisor of the country for whole 4 years, suddenly say that India's GDP is overestimated by not 1% but 2.5%. If it's so then why didn't he say anything during his tenure and why he did nothing about it. Why did he not mention this in his economic survey. Again, if the government and he were not in same terms, why he preferred to stay quiet rather than do about it. If the data was so flawed then why did he not alert the PM during his tenure, after all, he is blaming it on the UPA era counting of it. This again, if you ask me, raises questions on his credibility.\n\nNow anyone who tells me that India's economy is great currently might be lying. But outright saying that GDP data, were outright wrong after you leave the post, is questionable.\n\n**Before NDA**\n\nSomething special had happened before he became the Chief Economic Advisor of PM Modi. As a Senior Fellow, Peterson Institute for International Economics and Center for Global Development, he had advised, not India but someone else, that in order for India to open up on its imports, he specifically asked for discriminating against Indian companies and Indian exporters, so that India is forced to open its economy to the world. Not only that, in his paper he specifically had bad words for India signing free trade agreements with different countries. Now think about it, a person who's whole idea of better trade is to hurt India's interests and instead of trying to improve the relationship with other countries, is suggesting questionable ways to hurt both India's relationship with other countries and also it's companies and it's exporters. Now a year later same person is appointed as India's advisor.\n\n**Rajuram Rajan and other things**\n\nMost people are not aware that not only Rajuram Rajan and Arvind Subramanian are close friends, but they have also written famous research papers together.\n\nNow this is even more personal opinion than the above. I personally believe Rajuram Rajan was a Congressman in the cloak of a RBI governor. He has suggested many times and even recently so that he would have joined politics if it was not for his wife and family refusing it. It's for anyone's guess that, Arvind Subramanian a close friend of Rajan, who was suggested to the post of Rajan himself, where would his political beliefs and supports go to.\n\nWhen Arvind Subramanian was the Chief Economic Advisor and even now, he used to regularly give interviews to NDTV like channels. You used to find him not elsewhere but on lutyens media channels. I used to think that he did that to counter the narrative against the government which he was part of, little did I know that he belonged to the same type of people which lutyens media was made up of and looked like someone part of it.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSo yes. To complete all this. It's my personal belief that Arvind Subramanian, one, tried, not once but multiple times to hurt India and his economy, two, had questionable credibility, three, wants to only see things in hindsight, four, did nothing about it when he was in power to do so. All this suggests that he shouldn't be trusted by the people."<br />Author: 'Mumbaikarsevak'  id: 'bzno28'<br />Score:34<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bzno28/why_i_will_never_trust_mr_arvind_subramanian/</li>

(एम.एल.) के उत्तरप्रदेश के सेक्रेटरी हैं।" मैंने पूछा, "एम.एल. के तो कई गुट हैं। एक से ज्यादा लाइनें हैं। आप किस गुट के हैंसत्येन्द्र नारायण सिंह के या खोकेन मजुमदार? या नेगी के साथ हैं? लिन पियाओ लाइन अभी भी मानते हैं या डेंग सियाओ पिंग की कोई नई लाइन है? सी.पी.आई. (एम.एल.) का एक गुट तो सी.आई.ए. ने भी बना रखा है। क्रान्ति का इतना बड़ा कारोबार हो रहा है और उसमें सी.आई.ए. का शेयर न लगा हो, तो यह असम्भव है।"\n\nसवाल और रिमार्क मैंने एक साथ नहीं कर डाले। बातचीत में आते गए। उनका कहना था कि उनकी पार्टी इन सबसे अलग है। यह जितने गुट सी.पी.आई. (एम.एल.) के हैं, सब भ्रष्ट विचारधारा रखते हैं। फिर उन्होंने वह मुहावरे मुख से निकाले और वह वक्तव्य दिए जिनसे हम लोग अच्छी तरह से परिचित है, सामाजिक साम्राज्यवादी रूस और अमरीकी साम्राज्यवादी में साठगाँठ है। दोनों मिलकर बाकी दुनिया पर कब्जा कर रहे हैं। इनमें अन्तर्विरोध को बढ़ाएंगे । अफगानिस्तान के मामले में यही अन्तर्विरोध प्रकट हो रहे हैं। सामाजिक साम्राज्यवादी रूस अफगानिस्तान पर कब्जा करना चाहता है। हम अमरीका की मदद से इसका विरोध कर रहे हैं। रूसी साम्राज्यवादी पहला दुश्मन हैएनिमी नम्बर वन! फिदेल कास्त्रो उधर रूसी साम्राज्यवादी का एजेण्ट है। इधर वियतनाम का फामवान डांग एजेण्ट है।\n\nअच्छा, ये बातें भी एक साथ नहीं हुईं, होती गईं। क्रान्तिकारी ने कृषिशास्त्र में एम.एस.सी. तीनचार साल पहले कर लिया था। पिता लोककर्म विभाग में अफसर थे। रिटायर हो गए हैं। उनके पास ड़े सौ एकड़ जमीन है। युवा क्रान्तिकारी फॉर्म चलाते हैं। मैंने पूछा "कॉमरेड, आपके फॉर्म पर खेत मजदूर तो होंगे। उन्हें मिनिमम वेज (न्यूनतम मजदूरी) आप क्या देते है?" "मुझे पता नहीं। हिसाब पिताजी देखते हैं।" "कॉमरेड, खेत मजदूरों से काम आप लेते हैं और मजदूरी पिता पर छोड़ देते हैं।" आपके पिता न्यूनतम वेतन नहीं देते होंगे, यह पक्का है और आप अपने पिता से न्यूनतम मजदूरी दिलाते नहीं हैं, तो माक्र्सवाद-लेनिनवाद के हिसाब से क्रान्ति के लिए हमेशा दूसरे के बाप की तलाश करनी चाहिए। अपने बाप को खून चूसने की सुविधा दी जाती है क्रान्ति में। उस खून का एक हिस्सा क्रान्तिकारी बेटा भी पीकर सर्वहारा का नेतृत्व करने पहुँच जाता है।\n\nयह अतिक्रान्तिकारी अपनी पार्टी के संगठन या प्रचार के काम से नहीं आए थे। कई साल पहले अमरीकी सहयोग से खुले कृषि विश्वविद्यालय की मार्फत अमरीका में \'फेलोशिप\' प्राप्त करने की कोशिश के लिए आए थे।\n\nक्रान्तिकारी की यह नस्ल नई नहीं है, पहले भी थी। अब बढ़ गई है। कई सालों से देख रहा हूँ। अच्छी नौकरी लगने पर घूस खिलाकर पुलिस रिपोर्ट ठीक कराता है। अच्छा धन्धा जमने पर माक्र्सवाद की जगह दो नम्बरी दर्शन का अध्ययन करता है। जवानी में जैसे अच्छे कपड़े, अच्छे जूते, अच्छी टाई का शौक होता है, वैसे ही सम्पन्न घरों के कुछ युवकों को क्रान्ति का शौक हो जाता है। क्रान्तिकारिता को वह एक और अच्छा सूट, और एक और अच्छी टाई, एक और अच्छा जूता समझते हैं। इससे शोभा बढ़ती है। प्रतिष्ठा बढ़ती है। क्रान्तिकारिता नया फैशन हैं। कुछ दिन से क्रान्तिकारी \'हीरो\' बनकर उछलकूद करते हैं। मैं कुछ क्रान्तिकारियों को जानता हूँ जिनकी बाकी जिन्दगी इस प्रचार को धोने में गुजरती है कि वे कम्युनिस्ट थे। क्रान्तिकारिता, जिसे उन्होंने कभी द्वार पर रंगोली की तरह सजाया था, अब पाँवों में काँटे की तरह चुभती है। उसे वे नष्ट कर देना चाहते हैं। वे अखबारों में समय समय पर बयान छपाते हैं कि यह  "दुष्टप्रचार है कि मैं कम्युनिस्ट हूँ। मैं कभी भी कम्युनिस्ट नहीं था।" ऐसा वे नौकरी में सुरक्षा और तरक्की के लिए करते हैं।\n\nएक विश्वविद्यालय है, जिसके बारे में प्रचार है कि वहाँ वामपन्थी भरे हैं। वहाँ खूब आन्दोलन होते हैं। कहते हैं, वहाँ उग्रवामपन्थी भी बहुत हैं। खूब पोस्टर लगते हैं। प्रचार साहित्य बँटता है। बहसें होती हैं। मैंने एक वरिष्ठ अध्यापक से कहा, "आपका विश्वविद्यालय तो वामपन्थ का गढ़ है। वामपन्थी दलों को बहुत काडर मिलता होगा आपके यहाँ से।" उन्होंने कहा, "हाँ, सी.पी.आई., सी.पी.आई. (एम.) के भी बहुत हैं। अतिउग्रवादी वामपन्थी भी हैं। पर वामपन्थी दलों को बहुत कम कार्यकर्ता मिलते हैं। अधिकांश लड़के उच्चवर्ग के हैं, खातेपीते घरों के। वामपन्थी कहलाने वाला यह विश्वविद्यालय वास्तव में सम्पन्नों का है। बढ़िया खाते हैं, पीते हैं, पहनते हैं, बहुत अय्याशी है। सारे मनोरंजन हैं। क्रान्तिकारिता एक और स्कॉच की बोतल है। इनमें जो खास क्रान्तिकारी होते हैं, वे फेलोशिप लेकर अमरीका चले जाते हैं या किसी मल्टी नेशनल में।" वामपन्थी रूप धारण करके क्रान्तिकारिता का नाटक करने से इन युवकों की कीमत बढ़ती है बाज़ार में। वह अपने खरीददार को जानते हैं। उसे माल की \'क्वालिटी\' दिखाते हैं। क्रान्तिकारिता के पानी में जो मछली ज्यादा उछलती और उतरती है, उसे अमरीका बगुला उतनी ही फुर्ती से पकड़ता है।\n\nकाशीनाथ सिंह की एक बहुत अच्छी कहानी है ऐसे झूठे क्रान्तिकारी पर। क्रान्तिकारी कॉमरेड साथियों में बैठकर गुरिल्ला युद्ध की योजनाएँ बनाते हैं। फिदेल कास्त्री, चे-ग्वेवारा, माओ, ही ची मिन्ह का नाम जपते हैं। कॉमरेड की शादी कर दी जाती हैं और वे कर लेते हैं। कार में अपनी दुल्हन को लेकर आ रहे हैं, सोच में क्रान्तिकारी ही रहे हैं। नारी उनके लिए अर्थहीन है। उन्होंने क्रान्ति का वरण किया है। रास्तें में पहाड़ी मिलती है। वे कहते हैं…गुरिल्ला युद्ध के लिए यह बढ़िया जगह है। कार को झटका लगता है। उनकी पत्नी सहारे के लिए कन्धे पर हाथ रख देती है। क्रान्तिकारी हाथ अलग करके कहते हैं…यह कन्धा बन्दूक के लिए है, स्त्री का हाथ रखने के लिए नहीं।\n\nआगे क्रान्तिकारी अपने चोर सामन्तवादी ससुर से अपने राजनैतिक प्रभाव का उपयोग करके छोटे भाई को नौकरी दिलवाते हैं। बहन की ससुराल से भी लाभ लेते हैं: समझौते रखते हैं। फायदे उठाते हैं। हूँहूँ करते हैं। मगर क्रान्ति के तेवर कायम रखे हैं। एक बार बहन की ससुराल गए। वह भी सामन्ती परिवार है। वहाँ कोई उनसे यह कह देता है कि छोटे मालिक भी क्रान्तिकारी हैं। रात को आँगन में वह और उनकी बहन का देवर सो रहे हैं। क्रान्तिकारी उस युवा से क्रान्ति की बातें कर रहे हैं। वर्ग युद्ध की योजना पर चर्चा कर रहे हैं। गोरिल्ला युद्ध की रणनीति तय कर रहे हैं बहुत रात हो जाती है, तो वह लड़का खींझकर कहता है, "भाई साहब, अब ज्यादा बोर मत कीजिए। आप भी सोएँ और मुझे भी सोने दीजिए।" \n\n-"कॉमरेड, अपने देश के बारे में भी तो कुछ सोचते होंगे?"\n\n"देश के बारे में क्या सोचना है? भारतीय एकाधिकार पूँजीपतियों और रूसी साम्राज्यवादियों ने मिलकर इन्दिरा कांग्रेस की सरकार बनवा दी है। इस सरकार को हथियारबन्द संघर्ष में गिराना है। आर्म्ड क्लास वार! \n\n-"यह अकालराहत कार्य क्या है?" \n\n"इन्दिरा गांधी की इमेज बनाकर उसका शिकंजा मजबूत करने के लिए है। ज्योति बसु भी राहत कार्य खोलकर प्रतिक्रान्तिकारियों का साथ दे रहा है।"\n\n-"तो कॉमरेड, जो लोग प्यासे मर रहे हैं, उन्हें पानी पिलाने से क्या क्रान्ति पीछे हटती है? तो प्याऊ बन्द कर देने से क्रान्ति नजदीक आ जाएगी? लोग भूखप्यास से मर जाएँगे, तो क्या ठीक होगा?"\n\n"रेवोल्यूशन करना है तो आदमी के मरने की क्या चिन्ता?" \n\n-"तो कॉमरेड, अगर पाँच लाख आदमी गन्दा पानी पीकर हैजे से मर जाएँ तो क्या क्रान्ति हो जाएगी? क्या दस्त की बीमारी से भी क्रान्ति होती है?"'<br />Author: 'fasc2'  id: 'byyxho'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/byyxho/अतकरनतकर_हरशकर_परसई/</li>

Jio will rule all finish other ISP\'s and then regulate the internet.\n\nMost arguments I hear fall into these 3 buckets.  \n\nHere is a basic premise: We are yet in a country where  Government Babu A interprets the rule in  one way and another Babu B in another. We are also in a country where a Judge lets a rapist father go despite being convicted. And in all countries, there are people who lobby for their interests, whether it be Washington, London, Paris, Berlin, Moscow or Beijing. \n\nNow let us break down the arguments:\n\n1.  Of course RIL has an immense influence in the Government. But so do many many other business groups. RIL directly and indirectly provide jobs to thousands of people, pay crores in tax. Head to a single Reliance Digital store and you may see 30 people whose income is directly attributable to RIL. And another 20 who are indirectly employed (think of plumbers, drivers, loaders et all). Everyone watches out for their interests. We lobby with our bosses and try to curry favours from them. We also help our friends and family whether it be by making introductions to get them jobs or banks. RIL lobbies as is their right to improve their business. Some things go their way, some against. And it is the same for **all** Business groups in India.\n2. Some people argue that Reliance is bad because "Indians are uneducated and use internet wrong". To me, this is classist. Not all Indians have the opportunity to learn in school. The Government public school system is pathetic. Some people watch porn, others talk. Some stream music. With Jio, I see rickshaw drivers and other blue collar labour staff talk and video chat with their families. It makes them happy. They can see how their parents &amp; children are doing. They use "Whatsup" to share what is relevant to them. A rural UP boy can see what job opportunities are available on the internet. He can also learn how to code and see courses on the internet. Look at  the impact [Grandpa Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0bDzCqtPIQ) has. They feed people and monetize the channel. (Fun channel to watch in my opinion.). Of course, some redditors believe the " We are not ready yet" argument. Flimsy arguments include porn watching, which many people do. I personally believe that many of those giving this argument are worried that now even a blue collar labourer now has a smart phone.\n3. Now another fear mongering going on is "JiO WiLl ReGuLaTe aLl iNtErNeT". If anything, Airtel &amp; Vodafone have cleaned up their act. Both of them raised money recently. They are here to stay. Vodafone with YouBroadband &amp; TataSky is now in the broadband business. India is too large a country to  regulate. The others are here to stay and fight.'<br />Author: 'JainMutton'  id: 'byv3br'<br />Score:107<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/byv3br/unpopular_opinion_jio_has_connected_more_people/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Is resource scarcity a good thing for India in the long-term?'<br />Body: "There's a theory formulated by some historians and economists that the reason why Europeans began exploration of different continents and ultimately colonize most of the world is because of the scarcity of resources in their own continent. That struggle has also greatly aided in their technological advancement.\n\nIn contrast, the Indian and Chinese subcontinent had adequate resources to feed and provide all sorts of basic needs for their entire population. So they could just shut themselves off from the world, either by not doing trade or conquest, and still have political stability. But that 'comfort' has also caused them to be overtaken by the West in many fields. \n\nWe see a similar problem today in resource-rich countries in the Middle East and Latin America. In most cases, the locals of the country are unproductive and non-competitive. In the case of Latin America, they're stuck in the middle-income trap while Gulf countries rely too heavily on foreign labor and expertise. \n\nIndia has a problem with overpopulation. When the population reaches 1.7 billion in 2040, it'll be very difficult to provide basic human needs like water, food, shelter, healthcare, etc for everyone. If the theory is right, then that struggle will force Indians to come up with new innovations that'll ultimately revolutionize the way people live. **Ultimately, human resource is a lot more important than natural resource.**"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'byrx01'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/byrx01/is_resource_scarcity_a_good_thing_for_india_in/</li>

      <li>Title::: "[Unpopular Opinion] Caught between religious animosity, India is at risk of losing sight of it's potential for greatness."<br />Body: 'The Constitution of India is one of the most impressive (a)political documents in the world.  Drawing from the best(at that particular time) of ideologies around the world, it was condensed succinctly into easy, explainable words, generalised as to ensure flexibility, which evolves with the social and political climate of the times. \nAnd inclusiveness has been an integral part of Bharat since the Vedic society. The caste system was a product of the times, but wasn\'t something enforced on people of other beliefs as they came into contact with the indigenous community of the subcontinent. The use of the term Hinduism to describe a collection of practices and beliefs is a recent European construction, the term "Hindu" was coined in position to other religions and used to describe those that were not of the other religions. Before the British began to categorise communities strictly by religion, Indians generally did not define themselves exclusively through their religious beliefs; identities were segmented on the basis of locality, language, caste, occupation and sect. Initially referring to the geographical area beyond the Indus river, it gained popularity as catch all for the purpose of description rather than understanding. The core tenet of Dharma - a way of life - is much broader than the term religion gives it credit for. Because of the wide range of traditions and ideas covered by the term Hinduism, arriving at a comprehensive definition is difficult. It defies desire to define and categorize it, and to grossly understates the spectrum of beliefs - polytheistic, pantheistic, panentheistic, pandeistic, henotheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic or humanist - which exist within it. \nAnd since these "Hindus" were tolerant of other beliefs being practised alongside theirs , because of the wide spectrum amongst themselves as a whole, it became known as a land for tolerance. \nPeople often use the justification that Hindus never waged war - that idea is incorrect. They waged war on each other - motivated by money, resources to name a few, and since there are formidable barriers to accessing the subcontinent - rivers, mountains,seas, deserts, it was relatively self contained. Invasions happen because of two primary motivations - lack or resources in the current place and abundance of resources in another. And they waged war over it and won. And since now the invaders had control over the source of the resource, they set about strengthening their hold, and introduced new belief systems into the subjugated region. Some people may have found the concept of a singular, non anthropomorphic God attractive, we can\'t say for sure. Maybe forced conversions took place. All we know is that a new faith entered the previously mono religious subcontinent. Similarly, the European came searching for trade routes, and established them. Differing ideologies came into contact and they gradually took over overtly waging war under the guise of carefully crafted reasons. The reasons people tend to discard old beliefs is (grossly)ABC. It\'s gives Assurances that salvation is achievable through Belief in a precise theology, and that Conversion will infact let them lead better life. \nBy the time 1947 cane around, there is a multitide of Faith\'s co- exsisting in the subcontinent. The forefathers of the Constitution knew better than to oust "new" religions just because they were new. That\'s why generalised open terminologies to ensure inclusiveness were inscribed. And it\'s only been modified by addition, and not subtraction - because subtraction takes away the inclusiveness. \nWith Liberals bemoaning the increasingly unsafe environment propagated by Conservatives who are demanding that people of other religions leave them be, there is fault in both sides. Someone in the present cannot be held responsible for what atrocities happened in the past, and that doesn\'t give you the right to prosecute them for not believing in your "idea" of God. These percieved injustices  in both sides cannot be what defines the nation today. Because all it will lead is to attrition. The world has become a much smaller place and is both better and worse for it. As a nation predominantly populated by "Hindu\'s" the aim should be aiming for inclusiveness not exclusiveness. For example, the matter of consumption of cow meat. Slaughter of animals was frowned upon in Hinduism, but wasn\'t not mandatory. Non violence applied to all animals equally. Gandgi once said: "I worship it and I shall defend its worship against the whole world", and stated that "The central fact of Hinduism is cow protection." Yet even Gandhi never called for the banning of cow slaughter in India. Stating\n“How can I force anyone not to slaughter cows unless he is himself so disposed? It is not as if there were only Hindus in the Indian Union. There are Muslims, Parsis, Christians and other religious groups here.”\nNow The slaughter of cattle is allowed with restrictions (like a \'fit-for-slaughter\' certificate which may be issued depending on factors like age and gender of cattle, continued economic viability, etc.), but only for bulls and buffaloes and not cows in fourteen states. It is completely banned in six states with pending litigation in the supreme court to overturn the ban, while there is no restriction in many states. \nTo act in rumours and blind belief without allowing for explanations or the legal process to investigate, and by taking matters into our own hands, we are fostering a aura of intolerance and fear mongering , which inevitably leads to conflict as the oppressed section will eventually respond to continued denigration. And liberals are no better . If they are so intelligent, and better off than the conservatives, why haven\'t they made the great strides they profess to achieve in the years when a predominantly liberal government was at the helm. That does not give the conservatives an out. The liberals failed. You have the opportunity to do better. Do not state the failures of previous thought processes as your reason for your lack  of success. A fresh start is your hands. The rise of jingoism is a dangerous precedent. It promotes vigilantism and is violated the sense of security a nation should provide it\'s citizens. Live your life as you would see fit. You wouldn\'t appreciate someone forcing their belief on you. They wouldn\'t either. As a country we can only grow upwards of we set aside our differences to work together. Both are in the right. And both are in the wrong. Trust is a two way street. And we have to meet halfway for this to work. Otherwise all that remains will be mutual distrust, and that will be harmful to the potential greatness of this country as a land for inclusiveness and harmony, not not as a ground for distrust and despair. \n\nEDIT: People might say why I speak about Hinduism extensively, but as the predominant faith of the region, it has a responsibility towards other beliefs, which is why it matters.'<br />Author: 'LibConLibCon'  id: 'bykn5p'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bykn5p/unpopular_opinion_caught_between_religious/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Reviving Sankhya 4 – The war of life and Yoga'<br />Body: "In the previous thread, I noticed a prevalent scepticism among the commenters. There was doubt about whether it was possible to practically pursue the 4 Purusharthas or goals/meaning of life. The demands made by Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha mostly if not always are antithetical to each other. How can we be righteous(Dharma) and at peace(Moksha) while fulfilling all our desires(Kama) and earning enough(Artha)? There is disillusionment and dejection in life even if we know that this is what we need to aspire to. Life seems like a war on whose battlefield you stand and see all the worse aspects in front of you. Yet only by winning at this game or war called life can you get everything that you want(Kama and Moksha) and what you need(Artha and Dharma). We also feel a sense of just leaving the battlefield and never return thus ending everything. These aren't new questions and have been raised in the past. Who are we, how should we live our lives and how should we act in the world are the questions every generation wrestles with. In fact, there was a warrior who raised the same questions in an actual battlefield. He too had the desire to just leave the battlefield and threw his weapon. These were the same questions which were answered and the same concerns that were dispelled by his charioteer. That answer is what became what is for me the most important book in history called Bhagavad Gita. There is a reason why Krishna chose to elucidate the Gita in the middle of the battlefield,  our lives are our very own Kurukshetra and it is a battle every human being needs to fight. The fact that the philosophy painted in Gita is Samkhya tells us very much about the influence and importance of this philosophy in our culture. This is the very reason why made this series to revive it. Samkhya is the philosophical foundation on which Gita stands and Yoga is how we need to act to actualize it.\n\nThe Yoga of Bhagavad Gita isn't the stretching exercises you are familiar with but a system where you actually achieve Moksha navigating the battle of life. If you have read my previous post you would know that the thing standing between you and Moksha is Ahamkara, the false ego created by you. By doing Yoga you can not only kill your Ahamkara but also live a better life. Yoga is a practical way to achieve the 4 Purusharthas but you would also need the knowledge of Samkhya as a foundation to achieve it. Here are the 4 Yogas discussed in Bhagavad Gita-\n\n1. Karma Yoga - The Yoga of action. You practice it by taking actions without any attachment to any fruits of the said action. You don't get sad when the result is bad and neither are happy when the result is good. You accept it as it is without any attachment. This is what purifies the Mind. When you forsake any right to the fruits the action it doesn't just remain any other action but is a form of worship and spirituality. Right action is something that is denoted by 4 Purusharthas. Artha and Kama are pretty much =easy to comprehend as they are gross in their existence and easily perceived. Moksha is something to go for. But Dharma is complicated. Dharma is something that is very very subtle is the core of what is the right action. So the question now is what is the right action?\n\n2. Jnana Yoga - This is the Yoga of knowledge. It is a pursuit of knowledge and truth about our reality. By pursuing the truth and changing your mind when you find out you are wrong. It's our Ahamkara that doesn't let us see the truth and change our minds. It is the most difficult of the paths since you are dealing with a formless reality/truth that is constantly changing. So the question arises what is the right knowledge of the truth?\n\n3. Bhakti Yoga - This is the Yoga of devotion. By devoting and losing yourself to something or someone. By completely surrendering yourself to someone you set aside your own false ego or Ahamkara. It could be a personal God, a cause, your country or a person. A very beautiful metaphor for this is Arjuna. You see there is an allegory of Chariot in philosophy. Chariot denotes our body. We denote our souls. The Horses our senses and the reins our mind. Arjuna surrenders the reins of his chariot to Krishna to guide him in this battlefield. Like we need to surrender ourselves to something to denote a beacon to guide us. This is the easiest Yoga to practice but it is also very susceptible to corruption and become fanaticism. The question is what is the right devotion?\n\n4. Raja Yoga - While the other Yogas are concerned with the outside world this is concerned with the inside world. It is called Raja Yoga because it is the best of the Yoga. We in this world are too busy searching for Moksha in the outside world whereas the actual Moksha is inside. If you look closely the different Yogas that I have mentioned though are based on outside actions they address the problem inside. They are a tool to cleanse our mind. Raja Yoga is to meditate and look inside yourself. To better explain it, it is what our traditional preconception of what a yogi does to achieve enlightenment is. Here you use looking inside yourself and eliminate Ahamkara there.\n\nNow since that is over I would elaborate on the questions that I asked in Karma, Jnana and Bhakti Yoga. There must be a question in your mind that which Yoga should you do and what yoga is right for you? The answer to this is all of them. No one person just practices one Yoga but rather a personal synthesis of them. These three yogas are interrelated and these questions are very much dependent on each other. But to see that you don't have to limit yourself to the static consideration of these question but a dynamic one. Don't consider it a adjective but a verb. How do you take the right action? You need the right knowledge for it. But that alone doesn't make it the right action for you. You also need to be willing to take that action. That you can only know through right devotion. How do you acquire right knowledge is? You should be devoted to find it and take the right action of acquiring it. How do you devote yourself rightly? You use the right knowldege and take the right actions to express it. This is why it was hard to percieve how to pursue the 4 Purusharthas. Because all the Yoga are one and the same and yet completely different. Interdependent yet independent. Formulated yet formless. You would need to look inside to know what you have to do so Raja Yoga is the key to Yoga. And the key to Raja Yoga is the Samkhya philosophy.\n\nEveryone's synthesis of these yoga would be different and unique. I cannot tell you how to achieve it as I don't know what your path would be. You yourself have to find it. One way that I have found helpful is to read about how other people followed their path. Mahabharata and Ramayana are good examples. Life of Vivekananda, Paramahansa Yogananda and others are also good pointers. I would highly recommend to read [this paper](https://web.archive.org/web/20150315110638/https://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/Hijiya.pdf) on how Oppenheimer followed Dharma and yoga to understand how to do so in a modern context. Other than that I would also be posting another supplimentary post which would be the last one in this series to better explore this.\n\nPS: I haven't gotten around to working on the Language and Culture post since I found this subject is much much deeper than I thought it to be. I would be posting it as soon as I complete my research on it.\n\nhttp://dgkl.in/reviving-sankhya-4-the-war-of-life-and-yoga/\n\nPrevious posts-\n\nReviving Sankhya 1: Monist Vs Dualist\n\n[Blog post](http://dgkl.in/reviving-sankhya-1-monist-vs-dualist/) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bd1dxg/reviving_sankhya_1_monist_vs_dualist/)\n\nReviving Sankhya 2: Prakriti and Purusha\n\n[Blog post](http://dgkl.in/reviving-sankhya-2-prakriti-and-purusha/) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bdi2gw/reviving_sankhya_2_prakriti_and_purush/)\n\nReviving Sankhya 3 - The 4 Purushartha\n\n[Blog post](http://dgkl.in/reviving-sankhya-3-the-4-purushartha/) [Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bv9xmj/reviving_sankhya_3_the_4_purushartha/)"<br />Author: 'srthk'  id: 'byiqyl'<br />Score:62<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/byiqyl/reviving_sankhya_4_the_war_of_life_and_yoga/</li>

While one TN student made it to top 50 ranks, across the board the performance seems to be terrible. The poor pass % is a repeat performance from last year. Such poor performance means that entire generation of TN students have missed the opportunity  to become doctors. \n\nPreviously TN students used to secure medical admission based on 12th board results. Now that there is an entrance test, their true abiity is being exposed. This indicates that TN education system is truly shambolic.

Institutions like the judiciary, state bureaucracy and state police would function a lot better in a smaller state because of the smaller area and less people. \n\n2) **Less people will be neglected** \\- Often times, all the investments will go to the major city in a state, and the other regions get left out. In the past, the people of Andhra had to go to Hyderabad for jobs, making Telangana people feel overwhelmed by 'outsiders'. Now, the various regions of Andhra would get more focus by the state govt. \n\n3) **Smaller languages and cultures can get state patronage** \\- Imagine if people who speak Tulu or Gondi have their own state. It'll make the country more diverse and save the smaller languages/cultures from going extinct. \n\n4) **The center becomes stronger when the states become weaker** \\- At the moment, Delhi doesn't have as much influence as Beijing, Moscow or Washington over the entire country.

      <li>Title::: 'KERALA'<br />Body: 'I am from Kerala and I can assure you that there are a lot of people here who support Modi (myself included), including some muslims (usually minorities like ahamadya who has ideological differences with sunni).\n\nI\'d like to point out that I work in my dad\'s manufacturing company in Kerala and hence some of my observations are based on interactions with political party members from the congress,BJP and CPIM, which one has to interact with when running an industry.\n\nHere are some points that can help you understand the current situation better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. State BJP Unit, Congress and CPIM (Communist party)-\n\nAll three of these parties come to our company to collect donations before elections ( this is legal and documented) . The amounts are usually small and is usually done just for good will, it\'s not like we need their help or they expect us to ask them for any assistance. However when you are running an industry you have to play their game and maintain good relations with everybody-\n\na) Kerala BJP unit is very pathetic and has very poor leadership. Most of the members are very incompetent and have no vision. They are corrupt and  have no administration skills or experience. Hence even if there is support for Modi, people are very hesitant to actively support a political entity in Kerala consisting of such members. I  voted for BJP even though I don\'t want them to rule my state because these people are not fit to run it.\n\nb)  They focus too much on these incompetent candidates instead of promoting "Brand MODI" and only advocates for the religious aspects of the party and do notspeak about the issues of  development of infrastructure, industries etc, the things that Modi ji stands for.\n\nc)  The CPIM of kerala is nothing like the "LEFT" parties in other states. They are far more competent. During the initial years of our state they did a good job in reducing poverty (poverty is non existent in Kerala and they got lucky with the gulf boom that was also largely responsible for this). Apart from this they have been pretty anti infrastructure for the most part, however the current leadership of Pinarayi Vijayan has been very pro business and pro infrastructure , hence although they are the communist party in name and symbol and culture, at the moment they operate in many aspects like a capitalist one. My point here is to illustrate how different they are from the Communist party in other states like west Bengal.\n\nd) The Biggest issue with the communist party is that they still blindly believe all this propaganda about "USA BAD, SOVIET UNION GOOD, CAPITALISM BAD". The current leadership may be a little smarter but the ground level workers have been so brainwashed that they still support this nonsense. In fact there are cases where when the current government tried to acquire land for roads, some of the low level party members protest due to usual "retarded left wing" reasons. And of course the appeasement of muslims and christians . This has reached some next level and they think that standing shoulder to shoulder with salafis and rape accused bishops and bashing modi is "secular" and "liberal". An of course there is the Sabarimala fiasco.\n\ne) Congress is like any other state congress party.  More corrupt, more appeasement (alliance with muslim league is a travesty) and also less competent. If they have one ideology it is mismanagement. However they are not brainwashed like the communist and is less anti hindu.\n\nf)  The leadership and supporters of both these parties are majority hindu and most of them are religious ! On average they are all more religious than me because I ammore or less an atheist who is culturally Hindu. They go to temples very often, do poojas etc. The recent sabarimala incident was mostly instigated by the CPIM head and alienated most of these people but instead of voting for the BJP they voted for congress. This whole thing continue to boggle my mind, but like I said, BJP here sucks\n\n2.  Hindus,Muslims and Christians-\n\nOne thing you need to understand that majority of hindus including me grew up with christians and muslims and that there is a bond that is beyond religions. Unlike other states, for the most part of kerala, we live together and although their religions are cancerous , they are good people who have been simply misled.\n\nThere is a strong christian lobby here that ensures that their religion is promoted, and that the church has a major hold over them. However there are many christians who don\'t give a fuck and there are a considerable amount who admire Modi for the work he has done. The biggest issue here is the influence of the church. There are conversions , but not forced and they are much less than what it used to be because most of the people who can be converted (usually poor hindus) have already been converted. But at the same time a large number of them celebrate hindu festivals, have hindu names , identify with hindu culture and are malayalees and Indians before christians.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen it comes to muslims its a completely different scene. They used to be very liberal for a long time but over the last 30 years have become the most conservative due to gulf migration and the funding from that region to spread conservative islam. There is much less conversions, but the birth rates are very high and this is how they intend to increase their numbers and if things go the same way it has, they will definitely become the majority in a few decades.\n\nHowever you need to understand that they are nothing like muslims in other states and that they are comparatively more liberal even now. However they are becoming more and more conservative and have started to identify with the global "Wahabi" spirit and the fucking communist and congress continue to appease them as they fail to see the danger here. At the moment my assesment is that bout 20-30% are fairly liberal and do not exercise Islam more than ramdan and daily prayers with low birth rates and do not wear any islamic clothing, criticize their religion to a certain extent and have low birth rates. About 20-30% have become very conservative with high birth rates and have reached the pointed of no return. The remaining are in the process of getting radicalized.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the BJP can replace these useless state politicians and replace them with competent administrators and espouse a more inclusive agenda in Kerala , they can easily win the elections here within 5-10 years, it is definitely possible because there a lot of people respect Modi and a lot of people are beginning to respect him. However the key word here is MODI.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is very much possible that I may have gotten some of my observations or assessments wrong and I would love to have further discussion regarding this topic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJAI HIND.'<br />Author: 'daydreamer1923'  id: 'bxyyda'<br />Score:78<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bxyyda/kerala/</li>

Certainly violence in the "cause" of Allah is more righteous than non-violence:\n\n&gt;(4:95) - Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame, etc.), and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home)...\n\nAnd what is the "cause" of Allah for which Muslims are encouraged to fight? Fight till only Muslims remain:\n\n&gt;(8:12) (Remember) when your Lord inspired the angels... "I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them"\n\n&gt;(8:39) And fight with them until there is no more fitna (disorder, unbelief) and religion is all for Allah\n\nIn this matter, don\'t listen to your conscience, for Allah knows best:\n\n&gt;(2:216) Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.\n\nAnd what to do when you encounter peaceful Gandhians? Don\'t show mercy otherwise Allah will be angry with you:\n\n&gt;(8:15-16) O ye who believe! When ye meet those who disbelieve in battle, turn not your backs to them. Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless maneuvering for battle or intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah...\n\nAnd what about those Muslims who are "liberal"? Per the Hadith, they are hypocrites:\n\n&gt;(20:4696) the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: \'One who died but did not fight in the way of Allah nor did he express any desire (or determination) for Jihad died the death of a hypocrite.\'\n\nAnd what to do with hypocrites:\n\n&gt;(33:60-62) If the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease (evil desire for adultery, etc.), and those who spread false news among the people in Al-Madinah, cease not, We shall certainly let you overpower them, then they will not be able to stay in it as your neighbors but a little while Accursed, wherever found, they shall be seized and killed with a (terrible) slaughter.\n\nExcept the one Hadith verse, the rest are from Quran, and cannot be changed for the word of our Allah is perfect.'<br />Author: 'papermaker007'  id: 'bxdgcz'<br />Score:73<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bxdgcz/totally_not_the_religion_of_terrorism/</li>

The White-Black race relation hasn't improved much. There's still a lot of segregation in property, schools and work. Black Americans continue to have the lowest median household income, highest poverty and Black neighborhoods have the highest crime rate. MLK's dream of Blacks being equal to Whites remains a dream.\n\nAs for South Africa, racial segregation is as bad as at any time in their history. White houses and farms are heavily fenced and guarded because they fear the intrusion of Blacks. In contrast, Black leaders feel like Whites have too much control over large swathes of S. African land. Also, their economic situation is barely improving. \n\nThen there is India. From 1947 to 1990, India was the undisputed poster child of 3rd world poverty. The birth rates were so high that the population tripled. Because of socialist red tape, corruption became a culture. Internally, there were constant riots and externally, even a tiny and insignificant country can dare to challenge India to war 3 times, forget China.\n\nIn contrast to these good men, look at countries of evil men from the 20th century. Hitler's Germany and General Tojo's Japan are two of the most developed countries in the world. Mao's China is rising fast. The only exception is Stalin's Russia, but it's still a major power in the world. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'bxba1y'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bxba1y/mahatma_gandhi_martin_luther_king_jr_and_nelson/</li>

During the Cold War, the then Soviet Union used long-term tactics such as contacting or recruiting western students at prominent universities. Among the most famous were the “Cambridge five”, the ring of British diplomats and spies who had been secretly recruited by the KGB while they were at Cambridge University.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntelligence officials are understood to hold a range of concerns about how the data could be exploited, including using it to build profiles of existing government officials based on their backgrounds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe more immediate prospect is that the Chinese agencies could target promising young students who might also have personal vulnerabilities that are revealed through data stolen from the university’s computers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe success of the hack and the length of time it took to be detected has concerned Australian authorities because the university upgraded its cyber defences after a previous attack that was revealed a year ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne intelligence official said: “China probably knows more about the ANU’s computer system than the ANU does.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow China is safely assumed to be the culprit here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is quite likely they have or are doing the same for Indian Unis.

Nobody denies that merit-based selection, with due deference to seniority, is the best method. The question is who determines merit? Is it the RM under Def Secy's advice? Is it the PMO? Is it Intel or the NSA?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;All the above have only peripheral knowledge of the officer concerned. Besides political leanings, we need to factor in professionalism too.

She has outstanding dues of Rs 3.76 lakh upto January 31, 2004. Same Bungalow commands a monthly rent of Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 4 lakh at present."<br />Body: 'Thanks to a RTI filed by Dev Ashish Bhattacharya, we have come to know  that it was "beyond" Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s "capacity" to pay a minimal  rent of Rs 53,421 for a sprawling 2,765 square meter colonial bungalow  in the prized Lutyens\' Delhi.  A generous Atal Bihari Vajapee government  took her plea on face value and drastically slashed an already  subsidised "rent" by a whopping 82 percent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n14 years ago she got the Vajpayee government to pare down the monthly  rent to her sprawling 2,765.18 sqm house in Lutyens\' Delhi from Rs  53,421 to a mere Rs 8,888. She said it was \n\n&gt;***"beyond her capacity to pay  the high amount".***\n\nAt present, Priyanka pays Rs 31,300 for her type VI government accommodation at 35, Lodhi Estate.\n\nPriyanka wrote to the government in May 7, 2002 ,\n\n&gt;***that Rs 53,421 was "too  high" an amount and "beyond her paying capacity".*** \n\nShe informed the  government that she had been "occupying the bungalow on the request of  the SPG.\n\nShe requested that she may "continue to pay rent at the earlier rate of  Rs 28,451 per month, instead of the increased rate of Rs 53,421 per  month". She notched up outstanding dues of Rs 3.76 lakh up to January 31, 2004.\n\nThe directorate of estates said 35, Lodhi Estate was allotted on  February 21, 1997, on payment of market rent of Rs 19,900 per month. The  rent has since been revised periodically. The directorate of estates  said the market rent for the property is Rs 81,865 per month. \n\n&gt;To put  this in perspective, a house one-tenth the size of Priyanka\'s bungalow  in the tony Jor Bagh commands a monthly rent of **Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 4 lakh**  at present. There are no houses of this size available in the heart of  Delhi for private citizens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe is neither an MP nor a MoS. She is not a bureaucrat/employee of the state. It is thus not clear in what capacity Priyanka was allotted to this bungalow. The only reason being was security fears.

      <li>Title::: 'Cricket World Cup 2019: Starting later than everyone else is an advantage - Virat Kohli'<br />Body: '**Team India is all set to begin its World Cup 2019 campaign on Wednesday when they take on South Africa at Southampton** , with every other team having played at least one game in the past week. Captain Virat Kohli felt starting late gave his side an advantage in sussing out conditions and strategies. \n\nSpeaking on the eve of the match, he also welcomed the expectations people had of him, and how he has learned to go along with them.\n\n* **On being the last team to start their World Cup campaign**\n\nIt is a bit of an advantage, I have to say, in terms of understanding how the games have gone, what the conditions have to offer, what the overcast conditions bring into play when the sun is out. It\'s a totally different ball game altogether, what the conditions are at 10.30 in the morning compared to the afternoon. I think from that point of view, we have a lot to absorb. We have a lot to learn from looking at how the other teams play.\n\nFrom that point of view, we would say that we have a lot of positives that we can take out of starting after everyone else.\n\n* **On Kedar Jadhav\'s fitness**\n\nKedar is doing well, he is back to full fitness. Kedar is batting in the nets now, he is hitting the ball well, so it is always nice to have him back in the mix because of the variety he brings into the side.\n\n* **On whether there is pressure of scoring a century in the opening match, having done so in 2011 and 2015**\n\nWhen you perform for a long time, expectations are always there. I understand how to go along with the expectations rather than saying I\'m not. You don\'t go out there to prove anything to anyone, which is a fact, but you have to accept that expectations are going to be there.\n\nWhen I walk out to bat, come down the stairs, people will say "we need a hundred" and all those kind of things will happen. So, for me, that\'s just a part of the process. It\'s not something that I don\'t want to hear, or something that I think people should not tell me because when you do well, people obviously want to see you do well again and again because they want to see the team win.\n\nSo my focus is if I\'m in a position to be able to do that again, but more importantly, make the team win. And if it takes a hundred runs, 150, 50, 60, 70, 40, whatever it is, I\'m ready to do that and that\'s the frame of mind I\'m going to be in.\n\n* **On the 10.30am start time, and how it affects team combinations**\n\nIf the conditions offer you a lot in terms of the pitch.. we know it\'s a different situation in England when there is a cloud cover and when there is sun out. With two new balls, if the pitch has something to offer, then an extra seamer comes into play big time.\n\nBut even on a good pitch, on a batting-friendly pitch with two new balls, I foresee the first 10 overs to be challenging if there is cloud cover. Because we are playing in England and the ball does a bit more than any other place in the world.\n\nFrom bowling point of view, even if you play with two spinners, two seamers or three seamers, they are going to be in the game in the first half if you start at 10.30. The dynamics will change from morning to afternoon big time, and the bowlers will have to adapt very quickly.\n\n* **On Kuldeep Yadav\'s weak IPL 2019 form**\n\nI have had great IPL seasons and I have entered playing for the country and I have felt like, "I feel like I\'m going to dominate this tournament so much" - and you can\'t put bat to ball.\n\nSo every tournament, every game that you play has no connection to what you have done in the past. You can only take out the positives and the learnings and take it to the next tournament or game that you play. Whether you have done well in the IPL or you haven\'t, you still have to work hard. And to me, IPL has no connection to the World Cup.\n\nHe\'s a guy who has done so well in the last two years. I don\'t think three or four games of a T20 tournament will do anything to harm his confidence.\n\nWe know when he pitches the ball in the right areas the batsman has to make better decisions or you are walking out. And he\'s back to bowling at his best. In the nets he is bowling well, attacking the stumps, his variations are spot on, he is pitching the ball in the right area. So I see batsmen having to take better decisions against Kuldeep rather than the other way around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[*Source*](http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/26895091/starting-later-everyone-else-advantage-virat-kohli)'<br />Author: 'RevenantPanda'  id: 'bwrsvm'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bwrsvm/cricket_world_cup_2019_starting_later_than/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Do liberals have a long-term problem in India?'<br />Body: "When I say liberals in the Indian context, I mean people who believe in (strict) secularism, socialism, multiculturalism, affirmative action for groups that are considered weaker, (strict) environmentalism, advocacy of English language and a country with a loose immigration and naturalization policy. \n\nPersonally, I think liberals have a major problem in attracting Indians to join their cause. The main reason for that is because of **demography**. When the Hindu population of India was above 80%, the state can be very liberal and kind towards minorities, as did Congress and Communist state govts for almost 60 years. \n\nNow the Hindu population has dropped to below 80%; if you add to that the high Muslim birth rates, Christian conversions and an increase in number of people who consider themselves non-affiliated instead of Hindu, you get a majority population that is feeling an existential threat. And that emotion will only grow stronger as the Hindu percentage goes lower. It's a similar problem, but with race in USA, Europe and Australia.\n\nThe second problem that liberals have to overcome is **national security**. India is in a tough neighborhood and therefore needs to beef up its defense and security. And at times of war, it needs a strong nationalist leader who's open to all options.

      <li>Title::: 'Key Points From the Draft New Education Policy (2019)'<br />Body: 'Link : https://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/Draft_NEP_2019_EN_Revised.pdf\n\nThe document itself has 3 parts:\n\n1)School Education\n\n2)College/University Education\n\n3)Additional Key Focus Areas\n\nIn the interest of keeping the discussions focussed and understandable, I have split it into 3 posts. This is part 1.\n\nThis policy is easily the biggest change to the education system since the old policy came in. It is in many ways, entirely unrecognisable, while in many other ways, simply formalising what was informally already done.\n\nThe first and biggest change, is that primary education, from ages 3-6, is now a formal part of school education, and public school must offer this. The second change, what goes hand in hand, is the abolishing of the 10+2 system. In many ways, the 10+2 system completely ignored the way a student\'s mind developed, and thus made for a poor learning system. The new system is 5+3+3+4. These stages are as follows:\n\n      - 5 years of the Foundational Stage: 3 years of pre-primary school and Grades 1, 2.\n\n      - 3 years of the Preparatory (or Latter Primary) Stage: Grades 3, 4, 5.\n\n      - 3 years of the Middle (or Upper Primary) Stage: Grades 6, 7, 8.\n\n      -4 years of the High (or Secondary) Stage: Grades 9, 10, 11, 12.\n\nThe new Foundational stage, is supposedly meant to be "age fluid". Your age does not matter, as long as you are within the age group 3-8. The Policy recommends this time, there should be no textbook based education, and instead play based and activity based education. It also emphasises on introducing a variety of new "stimuli" to force children\'s brains to develop in a holistic manner. These stimuli include : music (classical or modern, both singing and listening), art (regional, national, sketching, etc.), literature (folk tales, literature from the region, and national quality authors, both modern and classical). This is a massive departure from the present system, and the new emphasis on arts, is excellent. To add to this, a new bilingual policy is introduced. Students who learn languages are shown to have much better cognitive abilities than those don\'t so the new system makes all students learn 2 languages right from the start. One of these has to be the mother tongue, in order to preserve it. The other language may vary by region and requirements. The three language policy remains, but I\'m not sure exactly when a third language will be taught. The final changes to the primary education, is the integration of "anganwadis" into schools, and shifting them from primarily health workers, to full scale trained teachers, satisfying the needs of the students. Another thing the policy requires is the full development of people-skills, through a variety of things like weekly assemblies, to daily show-and-tells. This improves the speaking ability, something that IMO Indian students have historically been terrible at. New extras include group reading of stories, learning morality and ethics (along with a proper framework), puzzle solving of various types, etc. to make sure a child has a significantly better development. Students who fall behind are not left out, instead the teachers are required to identify and help them, as studies suggest that students who fall back early almost never recover.\n\nThe next "Preparatory stage" lays emphasis on shifting from a more informal style in the Foundation stage, to a more formal textbook oriented education, in the Middle stage. It is a bridge stage. Please not that the policy emphasises that any and all technical education must take place in the native language (mother tongue) first. This is because students who learn in their mother tongue have a noticeable advantage over those who learn in say English. The policy also has a very good writeup on why the emphasis on English has hurt India a lot, in many ways. The preparatory stage also keeps this focus on arts, and expects students to fully develop other skills beyond the "textbook education". The policy also demands the abolishing of the so called "co-curricular activities" instead integrating them into the core curriculum. This makes things like PE, yoga, art, music, a core part of the education, as opposed to "side stuff". It also requires that every student specialise in at least one of these subjects. Another new concept here is the selection of the best students, to help the worst students. The best students are selected by the teacher, and then become part of a sort of "national training system".\n\nThe third stage is the "Middle Stage". By this time, the student\'s mid would have developed enough. It is now time to start the fully formal education. Subjects start splitting from generic versions into more detailed subjects (like science -&gt; physics + chemistry + biology). Students at this point will slowly start to also learn technical subjects in English. The idea is that students will be able to think in their mother tongue (which has a lot of advantages), while being able to understand and present ideas in English.\n\nThe fourth, and final stage is the "High Stage". At this point, students have developed a lot. Their mind now starts thinking in "the bigger picture" mode, and they can start planning for the rest of their life. In order to support this, students are now allowed to freely select courses and specialise. They are still required to understand and complete art courses, as this is paramount to their abilities, regardless of the final course they choose.\n\nSome important courses that come over the 12 years include : course on ethics and morality, Indian languages and their history, regional literature,\n\nThe next major changes come to the school management system. Schools can now form "complexes". A complex is comprised of nearby schools, such that each complex has at least one school offering the above stages, i.e., a student in this complex can complete their entire school level education without leaving the complex. Complexes are then given funds and other resources, like teachers. These resources may then be split up among the schools as necessary. This is important, because some types of teachers are relatively rare, and thus it provides optimal utilisation of resources. Sometimes other resources like libraries may also be shared. The exact details of what is shared will vary depending of the schools and their locality (population density, and "backwardness" of the population).\n\nSchools also get a new level of autonomy, that was previously missing. Teachers are allowed to be the final deciders on the courses, and how they will be taught.\n\nIn order to improve attendance, the schools will do a number of things. Depending on the area, buses may be provided. Roads will be redone, so that transport is easier. Older students will be provided with free bicycles. The mid day meals will also be extended to offer basic breakfast to students. Adequate and safe infrastructure, including working toilets, clean drinking water, clean and attractive spaces conducive to learning, electricity, computing devices, and internet, will be important to provide to all schools.\n\nTo reduce inequality is a primary goal of the new policy. In order to do this, each school complex will have committee overseeing the demographics, and why students aren\'t attending. Specific groups called out include Muslims (for unwillingness to attend), and women in general. The policy requires that people of all castes and religions be integrated into the schools. The teachers are also required to emphasise on equality, by preventing acts that discriminate (e.g. not allowing SC/STs to sit with "upper caste students", etc.). The schools are required to join with the community in eradicating inequality. They are required to talk with parents and try and change their behaviour. This could be the groundwork to eliminating the reservation system. The policy sets the target of 2030, by which the majority of the students will be "equalised", not by pulling down the richer and higher caste, but by pulling up the poorer and downtrodden. Special Education Zones will be set up in disadvantaged regions across the country. The Central government will support extra investment and per-child expenditure in the ratio of 2:1 for each rupee spent by the State in these Zones. A special National Fund will be created specifically for providing scholarships and developing resources and facilities for students from Under Represented Groups.\n\nThe next set of changes are aimed at teachers. The primary aims are to improve teacher pay, and status in society. It recognises that teachers are already heavily burdened with a lot of work, so no government work may be offloaded onto teachers. They are also educated better, and stricter standards are set. Teachers are required to "re-educate" themselves by joining workshops, and the vertical mobility of teacher is to be improved. Teacher education will gradually be moved into multidisciplinary colleges and universities. By 2030, the minimum degree qualification for teaching will be a four-year liberal integrated B.Ed. degree that teaches a range of knowledge content and pedagogy. Developmental opportunities, in the form of local, State, national, and international teaching and subject workshops, as well as online teacher development modules, will be available to all teachers. Substandard stand-alone Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs) across the country will be shut down as soon as possible. New teachers will have to register with an authority, and then will be quickly shifted into a school complex, for integration with the schools as necessary.\n\nThe next major changes comes to the testing system. The new system will be run by the National Testing Agency (which was newly set up in 2017 for entrance exams). They will be conducting the tests, and the new tests will be more like aptitude tests. They will de-emphasise rote learning, instead encouraging an understanding of the subject. The policy claims that by 2020, all schools will have internet connected computers. It thus pushes for some degree of digitisation, by allowing for continuous evaluation through computers. Board exams in 10th and 12th are no longer. Instead we have exams in 3rd, 5th and 8th, called Census exams. The idea is to reduce the importance of Board exams. Teachers will also be more involved in the governance of schools and school complexes.\n\nThis policy also paves the way for better recognition of "top talent" in students. If a student is really good for e.g. in Math, then they will be attending special summer schools to improve their performance. As already mentioned, top students are also required to tutor the students who are have a hard time coping. There is also a new emphasis on Olympiads.\n\nThe RTE act sees some changes. It is now extended to the full duration of school, from ages 3-18. The RTE act itself will have to be reviewed, as the policy notes.\n\nAs for private institutions, there has been some misinformation. Private institutions will have to undergo some changes to have a similar system, so that they too can reach out to all students. The main changes are how fees is regulated. Fees needs to be rationalised, and can\'t be arbitrarily high. Once set, fee increments must go inline with inflation and reasonable increases, as opposed to random increases. Schools are also now required by law to be non-profit, and must be verified regularly by submitting all of their financial details. Private schools are also prohibited from having the word "public" in their name. So be prepared to see a lot of name changes.\n\nSchools will now also be accredited and regulated in a slightly more free manner. However, they are required to release all details to the public. A framework and guidelines for ensuring school safety and security of children will be developed, and will be made a part of the eligibility conditions for a school education institution for recognition and registration. Every principal and teacher will be made aware of the provisions of the relevant Acts, Rules, Regulations, etc. relating to child rights, and what constitutes their violation, by including a module in the teachers’/principals’ education/training programmes and refresher courses .Self-learning online programmes on child rights will be developed for the benefit of students, teachers, and parents. Credible mechanisms for students to report breaches of their rights, and for appropriate actions to be taken against perpetrators, will be developed and implemented, in collaboration with local police. The Adolescent Education Programme and National Population Education Programme will be integrated into the curriculum of schools in a phased manner. (please note that Adolescent Education Programme is not sex education).\n\nAlso, in addition to all this, alternative forms of schools like gurukulas, patashalas, and madrassas will be encouraged, as long as they follow a modernised system of education, and are fully transparent.\n\nThe first changes will be implemented by 2020, with most major changes being in place by 2022. The first benefits will be seen by 2025, and by 2030, we should have fully transitioned, with all benefits in place.\n\nSo that concludes the major changes. Now for the comparison with the existing system:\n\nThe existing system failed primarily in 2 ways: Languages were poorly integrated, and many schools did not even offer three languages, as the policy notes. Hindi speaking states were the primary offenders. Now all students are required to learn Hindi and English, in addition to a third language. The other way was in testing. NCF (2005) laid heavy focus on eliminating rote learning, and in introducing a system where discovery based education was encouraged. The 10th grade NCERT textbook for science is a testament to that. Yet the system failed, because tests were primarily focussed on facts. Tests emphasised on how well a student could mug up and vomit arbitrary facts, instead of trying to test a deeper understanding of the subject. The new policy does try to fix this, but how much will improve remains to be seen.\n\nThe other more minor ways in which it failed was the integration of "extra curricular" subjects. Many schools actually refused to teach these subjects, considering them a time waste. The new system makes them a core part of the education system, so there should be an improvement, but I remain sceptical.\n\nPlease discuss, and if you have any doubts, feel free to ask.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n1.Learning to learn\n\n2.Mother tongue as primary language of learning\n\n3.Focus on trilingual policy, with English no longer as primary language\n\n4.Equality of all students\n\n5.Arts, Sports, Music, literature, etc. are all now of primary importance, and each student has to specialise in one of these, in addition to courses of their choice\n\n6.Digital Education\n\n7.Freedom of choice in higher stage of education\n\n8.Board exams removed in favour of more frequent "census exams"\n\n9.Testing now to focus on aptitude and understanding, with more frequent tests, a la CCE under CBSE\n\n10. 10+2 eliminated in favour of 5+3+3+4, with full focus on primary (3-8 years) of education\n\nThanks to u/gryphus-scarface'<br />Author: 'dhinkachika123io'  id: 'bwnl84'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bwnl84/key_points_from_the_draft_new_education_policy/</li>

Balasubrahmanyam has been entertaining movie lovers with his magical voice for over 50 years now. He was born as **Sripathi Panditaradhyula Balasubrahmanyam** to Mr. and Mrs. P. Sambamurthy in Nellore on June 4th, 1946.\n\nThe iconic singer is celebrating his 73rd birthday today!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[S. P. Balasubrahmanyam \\(Courtesy: Google Images\\)](https://i.redd.it/qrzlsn4tpa231.png)\n\nS. P. Balasubrahmanyam (S.P.B) is a living legend. One of the reasons he is revered by fans across age groups is the fact that he has made an unparalleled contribution to the musical landscape without even receiving a formal education in music. By his own admission, even after nearly six decades as an award-winning playback singer, he can’t write a musical notation. And yet, there is no match for the might of his singing prowess. He is a natural phenomenon.\n\nOn the occasion of his birthday, let’s take a look at some interesting and little known facts about him-\n\n**1.** S.P.B’s biggest singing idol was Mohammed Rafi.\n\n**2. The Beginning**\n\n* S.P.B enrolled in JNTU, Anantapur to become an engineer, but had to drop out because of Thyphoid. He later joined Associate Member of Institution of Engineers, Chennai.\n* With a passion in music, he used to perform at various music shows and competitions and one of the competition which he won, was judged by S.P.Kodandapani and Ghantasala, where finally Kodandapani became his mentor. \n* S.P.B made his debut as a playback singer in 1966 with Sri Sri Sri Maryada Ramanna, a Telugu film scored by his mentor, S. P. Kodandapani. Soon then he debuted into Kannada, Tamil and Malayalam respectively.\n\n**3. No Beginner's Luck?**\n\n* After he was selected to sing 'Aayiram Nilavae Vaa' starring M.G.R and Jayalalitha, S.P.B suffered from typhoid just before the recording and hence couldn't lend his voice to the then Superstar, which disappointed him greatly.\n* But M.G.R, who was adamant in providing S.P.B with a chance, went to the extent of delaying the shoot and waited patiently for the singer to recover completely. Once S.P.B was able to sing, the song was recorded and then was shot at a famous palace in Jaipur.\n\n**4. Leading The Maestro** \n\n* S.P.B was the leader of a light music troupe which had Ilaiyaraaja(on guitar and later on harmonium), Baskar (on percussion), and Gangai Amaran (on guitar). \n* His association with Ilaiyaraaja started even before the two had made their respective movie debut.\n\n**5. Records Galore : The Song Machine** \n\n* He holds the Guinness World Record for recording the highest number of songs, for any playback singer with over 40,000 numbers in various Indian languages. \n* He has a unique record of singing most number of songs in a day. That is 21 songs in the span of 12 hours for Kannada composer Upendra Kumar, 19 songs a day in Tamil and 16 songs a day in Hindi. \n* He said he used to sing around 15 songs for Anand Milind in Hindi and then come back to Chennai by night.\n* He has sung in various Indian languages including a tribal language Gond. He has sung over 200 film and private albums.\n\n**6. Awards &amp; Recognitions**\n\n* S.P.B has won Indian Civilian Honours Padma Shri in 2001 and  Padma Bhushan In 2011.\n* **National Awards:** He has won 6 National Awards, most by any singer over four languages. 3 in Telugu for Sagara Sangamam, Rudraveena and Shankarabharanam, 1 in Hindi for Ek Duje Ke Liye, 1 in Tamil for Minsara Kanavu and 1 in Kannada for Sangeetha Sagara Ganagoyi Panchakshara Gavai.\n* 25 Andhra Pradesh state Nandi Awards for his works towards Telugu cinema, numerous other state awards from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.\n* In addition, he garnered the Bollywood Filmfare Award  and six Filmfare Awards South.\n\n**7. Collaboration with Musical Maestro AR Rahman**\n\n* S.P.B recorded three songs for AR Rahman in his star-making 1992 debut soundtrack Roja, which included singing the Tamil, Telugu and Hindi versions of the songs. They have frequently collaborated since then.\n* S.P.B is the singer to have recorded most number of songs for A.R.Rahman. \n* S.P.B got his first Tamil national award under AR Rahman's composition.\n\n**8. S.P.B The Music Director** \n\nS.P.B has worked as a music director in 46 films in four different languages which includes Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Hindi.\n\n**9. S.P.B The Actor** \n\n* S.P.B has acted in 72 films in three different languages, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada. \n* He is probably the only Indian singer to have acted in so many films. \n* He can also speak these three languages fluently, though his mother tongue is Telugu.\n\n**10. S.P.B The Dubbing Artist** \n\n* The amazing language skills served him well as he has provided the voice to A-list leading men Like Salman Khan, Kamal Haasan, Rajnikanth And Anil Kapoor when their films were dubbed in other Indian languages.\n* He even dubbed for Ben Kingsley in the Telugu dubbed version of Oscar-winning film *Gandhi*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**11.

      <li>Title::: 'CMV: Modi will not pursue large structural reforms'<br />Body: "There are two kinds of reformers, those who do it out of necessity and those who do it out of conviction. Modi is neither of them.\n\nModi doesn't care about economics. He cares much more about social/cultural changes. In 2015 he was briefly flirting with labour reform but as soon as the heat started, with the cries of suit boot ki sarkar accompying it, he backed off and then never went there again for the rest of his term.\n\nGST and IBC are significant reforms but they do not generate the kind of heat that labour or land reform do. The easy reforms are done, now comes the part where successive Indian governments have stumbled.\n\n P.V. Rao became a reformer under the gun of the IMF. Once the crisis faded, he stopped reforming in a big way. Vajpayee was a genuine ideological reformer, but he paid for that with a heavy price, something Modi undoubtedly learned from.\n\nWhy should Modi care? A politician is primarily interested in survival, and he has seen his vote tally go *up* even as he moved in a more welfarist direction. As long as BJP's social/cultural agenda is implemented, Modi is happy to be a fiscal hawk and implement gradual reforms (further rationalising GST etc) without doing major disruptive structural reforms. He doesn't need to and the only person who would do it in Modi's position when safe is an ideological reformer like Vajpayee, but Modi has proved that he is a pragmatist and doesn't care much about the economy as long as it hums along."<br />Author: 'FriendOfOrder'  id: 'bwjqmr'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bwjqmr/cmv_modi_will_not_pursue_large_structural_reforms/</li>

This is about a massacre which was carried out in WB government and police force. The summary is as follows :\n\n&gt;*In 1978, around 1.5 lakh Hindu refugees, mostly belonging to the lower  castes, settled in Marichjhapi — an island in the Sundarbans, in West  Bengal. By May 1979, the island was cleared of all refugees by Jyoti  Basu’s Left Front government. Most of the refugees were sent back to the  central India camps they came from, but there were many deaths: of  diseases, malnutrition resulting from an economic blockade, as well as  from violence unleashed by the police on the orders of the government.  Some of the refugees who survived Marichjhapi say the number of those  who lost their lives could be as high as 10,000, while the-then  government officials maintain that there were less than ten victims. How  does an entire island population disappear? How does one unearth the  truth and the details of one of the worst atrocities of post-Independent  India?*\n\nI was utterly shocked to see the apathy and total cover-up done by the media establishment. \n\nVideo   :   [https://youtu.be/9dOL\\_is9iYA](https://youtu.be/9dOL_is9iYA) \n\nAuthor :  Deep Halder,  Executive Editor, India Today Group Digital\n\nBook     : [https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Island-History-Marichjhapi-Massacre-ebook/dp/B07QWVW1RK/ref=tmm\\_kin\\_swatch\\_0?\\_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=](https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Island-History-Marichjhapi-Massacre-ebook/dp/B07QWVW1RK/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is going to be my next book.

      <li>Title::: "East Asian monoculture is working better than Western multiculturalism. Don't you agree?"<br />Body: "If you look at Europe and the Anglo countries today, there's a common trend. Locals are getting fed up with globalization and the rise of immigrant populations. As a result, they're voting for leaders who are nationalist and populist, who promise conservatism, trade protectionism and closed borders. The politics is becoming very toxic and polarized. Terrorism, from jihadists and far-right is on the rise. **Looks like multiculturalism is failing and becoming a dirty word everywhere it was tried.** \n\nIn contrast, East Asian countries did not subscribe to the idea of multiculturalism. If you look at Japan, S. Korea, China and Taiwan, all of these countries have over 90% of people who consider themselves to be ethnic Japanese, Koreans, etc. This is because their govts didn't allow decades of high immigration; and within the local population, they made sure that people are culturally as homogeneous as possible through education and strict norms (eg. Ethnic Koreans in Japan are forced to adopt a Japanese name). And **these countries look a lot more united and politically stable.**  \n\nSome people say that there's no way for India to become like an East Asian country. These are also the people who said before 2014 that there's no way Hindutva will ever be accepted by the Indian electorate.

      <li>Title::: 'Where did the BJP get its votes from in 2019?'<br />Body: '* Who voted for the Bharatiya Janata Party in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections? \n* How has the party’s support base changed in the last five years? \n\nThe magnitude of the BJP’s 2019 victory clearly indicates that it has consolidated gains made in 2014 and further expanded support beyond its traditional base.\n\nWhen a party wins an election with an increased vote share (the BJP’s vote share in 2019, increased from 31.1% to 37.4%), it usually gains votes across the board. Yet, an analysis of the National Election Studies 2019, a post-poll survey conducted by ***Lokniti-Centre for the Study of Developing Societies***, reveals that the BJP made disproportionate gains largely among groups where it has traditionally lacked support.\n\n# In the 2019 elections, the BJP increased its vote share across groups, apart from Muslims\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/cxgq1cwiz3231.png\n\n* Support among Dalits for the BJP deepened further in this election: more than one-third (34%) Dalits voted for the BJP in 2019 as compared to around one-fourth (24%) in 2014.\n* Traditionally, the BJP has received higher support among lower other backward class (OBC). The difference in support for the BJP between lower and upper OBCs decreased from 12 percentage points in 2014 to 7 percentage points in this election. This was primarily due to a relatively higher increase in support for the party among upper OBCs. \n* The only social group among which the BJP failed to make gains were Muslims: the party’s vote share among Muslims remained almost the same at 8%.\n\n# BJP secured its biggest gains among rural voters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 4ggf77i104231...*\n\n* Troubles in the rural economy, such as *stagnating farm prices and wages,* had led to concerns about disenchantment with the BJP in the hinterland. But in this election, there has been a sharp increase in the BJP’s vote share in rural constituencies of 7.3 percentage points. \n* This has meant a weakening of the urban-rural divide in support for the BJP. \n* The difference between the party’s vote share in urban and rural constituencies reduced from 8.9 percentage points in 2014 to merely 3.5 percentage points in 2019.\ufeff\n\n# BJP increased its vote share across classes - but the most among the poorest\xa0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/x0ed9vv904231.png\n\n* The bedrock of the BJP’s electoral dominance in the last few years is high support among economically weaker sections of the electorate. \n* While 2014 witnessed a surge in support for the BJP among the poor and lower economic strata, this election saw further bridging of the class divide. \n* The BJP had almost an equivalent vote share among the poor, lower, and middle-class voters in this election.\n\n# Youth  (voters aged 18-25 years)\n\n* In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the youth (voters aged 18-25 years) had voted decisively in favour of the BJP. The party’s vote share among young voters (34%) was 3 percentage points higher as compared to its overall vote share. \n* Even in this election, the party had higher support among the youth - 41%. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[*Source*](https://www.livemint.com/politics/news/where-did-the-bjp-get-its-votes-from-in-2019-1559547933995.html)'<br />Author: 'RevenantPanda'  id: 'bw8oyt'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bw8oyt/where_did_the_bjp_get_its_votes_from_in_2019/</li>

      <li>Title::: "[Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] 'Traffic jams' on Mt Everest, trouble for Huawei, and the Conquest of Sindh"<br />Body: "Welcome to another edition of the Biweekly Geopolitics Thread! I skipped the last edition of since the biggest geopolitical news of all - India's general election - was the overwhelming topic of discussion on the sub. But now, as the dust settles on the new Modi government and we go back to our usual lives, let's see what's happening in the rest of the world. Discussion topics do not have to be related to India, and can be on any topic of interest. Here are a few stories to get the discussion started:\n\n# Top 3 stories from India's neighbourhood\n\n1. [Sparring continues over blame for SL bombings](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/sri-lanka-blasts-police-blames-president-easter-sunday-bombings-11589268)\n\nWeeks after the worst bombing in post-Civil War Sri Lanka, there is no clear understanding of what led to the massive intelligence failure that could have potentially prevented the tragedy. On one side, President Sirisena insists that he was not informed by intelligence officials, often putting the blame on his rival, Prime Minister Wickremsinghe. Now, the suspended head of the country's police, Pujith Jayasundara, has filed a petition in the country's Supreme Court, outlining failures by departments under the President and alleging that he is being made a scapegoat. \n\n2. ['Traffic jams' on Mt Everest](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mount-everest-deaths-nepal-no-rule-climber-permit-changes-yet-official-says-today-2019-05-30/)\n\n11 people have died so far this year while trying to scale Mt Everest in Nepal, and part of the blame is being assigned to Nepal's government issuing far too many permits for climbers - nearly 400 this year. Climbing, even with a permit, is allowed only on a few days when the weather is favourable, and pictures posted online have shown traffic jams of people slowing climbers down. This is compounded by the fact that there is no health screening required to make the climb - even unfit climbers can do it. An American climber collapsed on the way down, and could not be taken by sherpas to medical staff because of the traffic jam. Yet, Nepal has little incentive to limit the number of permits or change screening procedures, as it earns a large amount of revenue from it: a permit costs $11,000, and hiring sherpas and equipment can earn the economy $45,000 per climber.\n\n3. [US escalates military presence around Iran](https://www.apnews.com/10044ee6ce494283ba4c2e7f86f7b650)\n\nThe US further escalated its ongoing campaign against Iran. After deploying warships in the region, the White House announced that it would send 1,500 troops and several planes in a 'protective role' in US bases around Iran, while also selling an additional $7 bn worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia in violation of a US Congressional resolution against it, by invoking emergency provisions. The US has blamed Iran for the bombing of an Emirati oil tanker and bomb blasts in Iraq. However, the US has given little proof its claim, insisting that it has intelligence to back it up but refusing to disclose it even to legislators. US NSA John Bolton, one of the chief architects of the disastrous US invasion of Iraq, is said to be the main architect of the current escalation and ironically, US media reports that President Trump is the one who has scaled down the plans. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Top 3 stories from the world\n\n1. [Theresa May resigns](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48395905)\n\nHaving failed to deliver a Brexit deal that could pass Parliament, UK Prime Minister Theresa May resigned, although she will continue on an acting PM role until her Conservative party can find a replacement for her. Several MPs are seeking the post - including arch-Brexiteer and colourful Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who is a front-runner. Separately, the original Brexiteer Nigel Farage's newly formed Brexit Party chalked up impressive wins in recent European Parliament elections. His party supports a clean, no-deal Brexit that economists predict would lead to disaster for the country.\n\n2. [Trump administration adds Huawei to Entity List](https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/05/15/white-house-declares-national-emergency-over-chinese-tech-blocks-huawei-from-importing-us-components-without-federal-approval/)\n\nContinuing its resistance to Chinese technology theft and spying, the Trump administration added Chinese smartphone giant Huawei to the Entity List, which effectively bans any US company from dealing with it. And although the ban has been held in abeyance for 90 days to allow consumers to make the shift to other companies, the effects are already being seen: Google has reportedly removed Huawei phones from the PlayStore and has prevented it from accessing anything beyond the publicly-available Open Source version of Android, Foxconn has reportedly stopped manufacturing Huawei phones, Qualcomm and Intel have reportedly stopped selling chips to the company, IEEE has banned Huawei researchers from reviewing scientific papers, and Huawei has effectively been banned from participating in 5G with any company or country in the world that so much as touches the US economy. In retaliation, China is reportedly looking to ban a large list of US companies, in addition to the many that it already bans like Google and Facebook.\n\n3. [Israel heads to fresh election](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-politics/israel-faces-second-election-in-months-as-netanyahu-fails-to-form-government-idUSKCN1SZ11E?il=0)\n\nIsraeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu was unable to put together a coalition despite winning the general elections in the country, forcing Israel to conduct another election that may yield similar results in September. The official reason is the feud between Netanyahu and his Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman on one side, and ultra-orthodox Jewish parties on the other. The latter want en masse exemption for religious scholars in the country's military conscription system, while the former insist that they should share the burden of defending the Jewish homeland. However, another reason is the potential corruption indictment that Netanyahu faces. His party has been trying to grant the Prime Minister constitutional immunity from prosecution, but allies disagree. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The Conquest of Sindh\n\nThis week's story from history comes from much closer to home, an event whose consequences can be seen today but is rarely talked about or taught in our history. After Prophet Muhammad established his new religion in the Arabian peninsula, he was succeeded by a number of religious leaders, who were called Caliphs (Khalifa), and the system was thus called the Caliphate (Khilafat). But it was much more than just a religious system: it was an administrative system, with governors appointed to provinces of the expanding Muslim Empire, and armies and generals further pushing its frontiers. From its birthplace in the Arabian peninsula, the Muslim Empire swiftly conquered many ancient empires: Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia (Iraq), and the most prized of them all: Persia (Iran). \n\nBut one prized territory proved difficult to conquer: India, being right next to Persia, was the next logical front for conquest. The many empires of India had traded with the Arab world for centuries, and were already well-known for their riches and spices. During the time of Caliph Walid I (707-715 AD), piracy based in Sindh was a major problem for merchants, and a source of tension between the Sindhi **King Dahir** and the Caliph's governors. While exact historical facts are difficult to come by, it is believed that sometime around 710 AD, an Arab ship bearing gifts from the Emperor of Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka) to the Governor of Iraq Hajjaj Bin Yousuf and the Caliph was hijacked by pirates off Debal (near modern Karachi). The governor demanded compensation from King Dahir, who refused on account of the fact that he did not control the pirates, although he did little to control their menace. \n\nThus began the first military action against Sindh, under General Ubaidullah, which was however defeated and  Ubaidullah was killed. The second invasion under Budail also failed, leading to extreme frustration. It was in 712 AD that Hajjaj chose a young 17-year old general, **Muhammad Bin Qasim**, to lead a third expedition to conquer Sindh with a massive cavalry of 8,000 men as well as ships. This conquest proved to be successful: King Dahir himself was captured after he fell from his war elephant, leaving his wife and queen to continue the fight. Her army was defeated, and she committed suicide through Jauhar. Bin Qasim's men continued to slaughter the local population, with accounts of over 100,000 people being killed in the span of three days. He also sent 60,000 slaves, including 30 young women of the former royal court, as slaves to the Caliph. Bin Qasim extended his control all the way to Multan, establishing the first Muslim Empire east of the Indus, and controlled if for four years, during which time he imposed the religious tax, jizya, and established Sharia law.\n\nHowever, fate played a trick on Bin Qasim, or maybe his karma caught up with him. Even as he prepared for further conquests into the rich and fertile plains of India, the Caliph died, and a new Caliph Sulayman ibn Abdul Malik took over. His first order of business was to purge the caliphate of all supporters of the former Caliph, and Bin Qasim was the prime target, being arguably the most successful general of the time. He was recalled to Iraq, where he was executed. A different story is recalled in the Chach Nama: it is told that the daughters of King Dahir, having been sent as sex slaves to the Caliph, tricked him into believing that Bin Qasim had raped them before sending them to the harem, thus making them 'impure'. As a result of this subterfuge, Bin Qasim was ordered back, stitched up into an ox hide, and sent to Syria, where he died of suffocation along the way. The Caliph also ordered the two daughters to be buried alive in a wall.\n\nBin Qasim's conquest of Sindh became only the first chapter in the thousand-year long expansion of Islamic empires into India, continuing with the Delhi Sultanate and reaching its peak under the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, being interrupted by the Marathas and the British Empire, and finally ending with the creation of the world's first Islamic Republic: Pakistan. Sindh proved to be the gateway of Islam in India (although Islam was already present along the southern coast, especially in Kerala), with the Indian subcontinent today hosting the largest number of Muslims in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat events from the world caught your attention?

      <li>Title::: 'Sunday Samskara - Science, Indian Science and Pseudoscience'<br />Body: 'Before I jump into the main topic, I must tell why I am writing this. \n\n&gt; Whenever we hear some minister uttering weird stuff like evolution, Vimanas, Astrology, plastic surgery and so on. There is a section of people in India, who come out of their caves and start bashing ancient scientific achievements of India. Some people on the other hand try to separate actual science from mythical tales. Some delve into symbology and so on. All in all, a layman either keeps batshit crazy theories about Indian science, OR just ignores it altogether. \n\nThe Indian attitude, in fact, I would say, the major attitude towards science in modern world is affflicted with two maladies, namely : Ignorance and Arrogance. \n\n1. **The Ignorance malady** : Though we all have been introduced to science in school, and a lot of us pass through exams. Very few people actually can perform science, solve mathematical equations and are comfortable with actual scientific jugglery. Thus, vast majority of educated class has to nod their heads in favor of scientific jargon, because they lack the mechanism to call out any bullshit themselves.\n\n2. **The Arrogance malady** : Since, science has been told to us as primary medium of understanding the world. The fear of looking stupid in the crowd of "scientific yes-sirs", makes us deride ancient traditions and basic thumb rules that the human race has been using since their existence. \nThis has turned into a full blown church like priesthood, where we get to see scientific lobbying, scientific jargon being used for political purposes and so on. A religion of modern age aka scientism. \n\nI stumbled across this problem firsthand. Because once upon a time in my life my dayjob was to figure out misconceptions children had in science. Due to absence of children in the schools in May, I started off with asking questions to my colleagues, degree holders, fellow engineers and so on. \n\nWhat I found out was new and very interesting. \n\nAlmost nobody could properly explain why seasons occur. All had told themselves some shitty story about it. I am pretty sure, hardly one or two readers will actually know it. There is no need to be embarrassed about it. One must learn in face of ignorance. \n[Earth\'s seasons occur due to earth\'s tilt, which causes the rays per unit area falling on earth to vary, it has nothing to do with distance] \n\nVery few could draw the shape of earth\'s orbit correctly. In fact, those who thought they knew less, got it right, ironically. [Earth\'s orbit is circular, not elliptical. It is elliptical in a very precise academic sense. Otherwise if seen from top, it would appear a proper circle. It is an ellipse of near circle eccentricity.]  \n\nSame was true for heat, do I emit heat, or I have heat. Basic questions of science. \n\nWhere do plants get their weight from, air, water or soil.\n\nThe reason why educated people fumble, and fail miserably in face of simple questions like these is because they have been ordained into the order of science, without any real practice in the discipline. Even the PhDs who practice the discipline have begun to have a very narrow domain of work and expertise. This is a very real problem. \n\nVery few people can actually work from scratch. Very few people can prove by geometry, like copernicus, that it is the earth that revolves around the sun and not the other way around. \n\nVery few people can form differential equations for motion systems, and then solve them, like Newton did. Engineers can, but humanities, commerce students, not at all. But all of these people have to pretend as if they stand for science, as if they know science and logic.\n\nIn the older world, either you knew science or you didn\'t. But you didn\'t nod at every sentence that a scientist spoke. You nodded at every word that the priest spoke. The scientific expert is the new priest. And with every priesthood comes dogma, bureaucracy, corruption and arrogance. \n\nRule 1 of Science Club :  If you can\'t solve a differential equation, you can\'t talk about science. Separates most journalists. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Indian Science**\n\nThis is an important topic, which I would like to take up as a series. The Indian tradition of "science" is as old as civilization itself. The first science of all, astronomy got pretty advanced in India. The prosody and grammar, also led us to make handsome advances in maths. The abundance of people and plants made us advance quickly in herbal science, and soon with ample philosophical support, we had Ayurveda.\n\nNow, some of us like to separate wheat from the chaff. They want to hide astrology, and mention only astronomy. \n\nIt would be interesting to note that most of our stellar giants on whose shoulders did Newton stood, i.e. Bhaskara, Varahamihir, Brahmagupta were noted astrologers too. In fact, the story of Lilavati is premised on an astrological calculation. They fed their bellies by doing very intricate calculations of planets and stars. Without the business of kundlis, there would not have been a good incentive to invest in lengthy calculations. \nWithout the OCD level paranoia of Brahmins and Jain Monks for Muhurats of marriages and opening of upvaas, we would not have developed water clocks, sine tables, and algebra. \n\nFor every good that comes out in the universe, there is some bad that\'s in the origin. Like Halalhal comes before Amrit.   \n\nOne might think that Kundlis are stupid, what they predict might not be scientific. But the process of making a kundli from scratch would make you sweat for days. I would say 99% of people would fail to make a kundli from scratch. They would lack the required geometrical and algebraic skills. Don\'t believe it ? Just try for once, and you will know how ignorant you are. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nScience, Pseudoscience, Nerds and Rules of Thumb\n\nDarwin gave us evolutionary theory in Origin of Species. Wonderful idea. We all know it, celebrate it, take it as a word of truth. \n\nBut it is sheer misfortune, that actually it was our ancestors who knew more about cross-breeding and mutation. They were the ones who bred their cows and horses. They were the ones who kept the seeds of the largest melons. They were the ones who maintained lineages so that we don\'t intermarry in the same family. \n\nThey knew more about evolution than we do. \n\nThey were actively playing the games we now know the abstract version of. \n\nDarwin coincidentally got a chance to see these old games play out fast forward on a very dynamic and isolated island. He was intelligent enough to abstract the laws out of the small games of breeding we had been playing out for millenia. AND THIS EXACTLY, IS SCIENCE.\n\nThe modern nincompoop may make fun of someone who says he doesnt believe in evolution. But that nincompoop would marry someone from his gotra, will eat the biggest watermelon of his farm, would not why Indian breed of cows are important, and would eventually cry lactose intolerance for every stomach upset that he gets. THAT IS NOT SCIENCE. \n\nScience is not an opinion that you keep so that you don\'t look stupid. \n\nScience is something you do, it is a discipline. \n\nBetter follow rules of thumb, if you are incapable of doing science. And live life thanking the ancestors for laying down these rules for you. \n\n\\m/'<br />Author: 'Kootanuvadak007'  id: 'bvzmla'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bvzmla/sunday_samskara_science_indian_science_and/</li>

Please critique.'<br />Body: 'These are replies to someone, just adding here to get your thoughts:\n\n&gt; It\'s been over 70 years since independence and people from different parts still can\'t understand each other because of language chauvinism. Joke of a country. Let Sanskrit be imposed like Ambedkar wanted, it\'s an objectively superior language to all others. It\'s no one\'s language and everyone will have to make an equal effort to learn it (in a 3 language system). Enough of this play-a-victim.\n&gt;\n&gt; I\'m from the South btw. Also people from the South have as much "Aryan" DNA in them as people from the North. Look at the latest DNA studies. No one is a pure native in the South.\n\n&gt; &gt; Don’t we already have English as a link language?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why would we need English to communicate with the world and Hindi to communicate with Rest of India? Brain dead logic.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After all we are all already communicating in English in this thread.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is with an eye on AI. It will be far far easier to make computers understand Sanskrit than English (if ever), because of its regular grammar. English is terrible for AI applications - changes every year, there\'s no 1-1 correlation between spoken and written English, it\'s grammar cannot be formalized etc. In fact Sanskrit is already used as a language engine to translate between languages (acc. to Rajiv Malhotra). If our news, laws, communications are all in Sanskrit, in the future we\'ll have already built a compendium of knowledge that AI can peruse and provide insights from.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, it\'s for the same reason Indians stick to their regional languages. Language is more than just a way to communicate, it provides an identity and a link to the past. Erasing language is erasing identity. Why else do we need regional languages at all? All our past literature is in that language, and not all will be/can be translated. Just break all ties with that? The substitute will be western philosophical ideas - are they objectively better? Each civilization\'s ideas are subtly baked into its language. This determines the some of the psychological biases of its users.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Besides there are other technical benefits to Sanskrit that make it a great language for several things (transmission of knowledge with error correction built in, poetry, resistant to change over time etc.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also for it be used as a language engine, it must have more expressive power than other langauges it is translating. There\'s a hypothesis called Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language limits what we can think of. If the hypothesis is true, a more powerful language would allow thoughts that cannot occur with a less powerful language.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There\'s many other reasons incl. seemingly mystic ones (which I won\'t get into - you need to perceive it yourself to see it. Most people won\'t be that perceptive about subtle psychological processes).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; English - international communication\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sanskrit - national &amp; machine communication\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regional language - regional identity'<br />Author: 'papermaker007'  id: 'bvyaa5'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bvyaa5/thoughts_on_3_language_system_please_critique/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Will Hindi become the lingua franca in India instead of English?'<br />Body: "I think many people predicted (and hoped, especially if you are urbanized and Westernized) that at some point in the future, all Indians will be speaking to those outside their state in English. But now I see an alternative future, where Hindi becomes the lingua-franca.\n\nIt's only natural for BJP to undermine English and give priority to Hindi. It's more pragmatism than anything. Modi, despite being a Gujarati, elevates Hindi because that's where the bulk of BJP's votes come from. And the bulk of their critics are liberals who attack them only in English media and articles.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see how Modi and BJP will react if there comes a situation where a significant portion of their vote base is from non-Hindi states (it's already happening now). BJP has a dilemma because they need to make sure that their non-Hindi voters don't feel threatened by Hindi imposition. Tamils obviously take it one step further by completely restricting the use of Hindi in their state. \n\nThe way I see it, the nationalist forces in every country would want a communication tool that's common to everyone within the country but alien to those outside. Meanwhile, the globalist liberal forces would ultimately want everyone in every country to communicate using the same tool. And then there are sub-national forces who want their own region to use only their own communication tool. \n\nIt'll be interesting to see how all of these pans out.

(Remember that recessive genes need two copies to express themselves)\nSince the offspring could receives the mutated gene from both parents, these genetic disorders would be more prevalent among this group.\n\n1/3rd of indian caste groups have as  strong or stronger bottleneck than  Ashkenzi Jews and the possibility of recessive genetic disorders is high. \nThis also presents an opportunity to identify risk factors of diseases among different Indian Castes.\n\nFor eg: The Vysya [ A caste in Andhra Pradesh], are known to have a high rate of prolonged muscle paralysis in response to muscle relaxants given prior to surgery.As a result, clinicians in India know not to give these drugs to people of Vysya ancestry. The condition is due to low levels of the protein butylcholinesterase in some Vysya. Genetic work has shown that this condition is due to a recessively acting mutation that occurs at about 20 percent frequency in the Vysya, a far higher rate than in other Indian groups.\n\nThis presents a historic opportunity for biological discovery, as inding genes for rare recessive diseases is cheap with modern genetic technology.\n\n####Source: [*Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the new science of the human past* ](https://www.amazon.in/Who-Are-How-Got-Here/dp/0198831447/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1L1MI01OSUWUA&amp;keywords=david+reich+who+we+are+and+how+we+got+here&amp;qid=1559463427&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=david+re%2Caps%2C404&amp;sr=8-2) by David Reich'<br />Author: 'indra_sword_rises'  id: 'bvvclc'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bvvclc/indian_caste_system_and_recessive_gene_disorders/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How Air India was destroyed by Praful Patel and the UPA - reposting my post from Rwanda'<br />Body: '[The best source on all things AI and Praful Patel](https://www.amazon.in/The-Descent-India-Jitender-Bhargava/dp/938295113X)\n\nSince Praful Patel got that book banned, and all copies of it destroyed, you might not get copies of them, I will do a tl;dr\'ish version of it.\n\nIn 2004 when PP took over (incidentally, the newest Boeings AI has, have call signs ending in PP), AI was making an operating profit, but net loss, while IC was making a relatively smaller loss. Combined both these entities were making a loss of roughly Rs 700 crores a year, however IC was improving it\'s profitability every year and it was expected to climb out by 2006-2007. IC was number 2 in terms of market share in the domestic market.\n\nIn 2007 the now combined AI+IC entity called AI (Indian) had an annual loss of Rs 3,000 crores and a debt burden of some Rs 50,000 crores. It was number 4 in terms of market share by 2009 (it regained # 3 position after KF went down).\n\n**How did Praful Patel achieve this?**\n\nCripple the financials of this entity by adding on a massive debt - So in 2003, AI had closed an RFP and had shortlisted Airbus Industrie as a vendor to supply 28 A340-300 aircrafts. In 2004 before the order book could be signed, PP took over. He arbitrarily decided to increase the order to a 110 planes, he also equally abirtrarily (and without any transparency) decided to change the order to Boeing. It is no surprise that [Dinesh Keskar](https://www.boeing.com/company/key-orgs/boeing-international/dinesh-keskar.page) was a personal friend of PP\'s and he found the Indian governments attitude to Boeing [very friendly and receptive] (http://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06MUMBAI1707_a.html), as a quid pro quo, Boeing agreed to invest $ 100 million in a MRO centre in Nagpur (PP\'s home base). Thankfully IC refused the order of 40 odd planes and hence only 60 or so were ordered.\n\nSo, suddenly AI had this massive massive debt of $ 15 billion (15 times it\'s annual revenue at that time) and just servicing the interest of this debt worked out to an annual figure of roughly $ 1 bn a year.Back then, it\'s revenues were around Rs 7,000 crores a year...the annual service burden wasalso Rs 7,000 crores a year.Updated to today, its revenues are 22k crores, debt is 55k crores and annual servicing costs alone are in the 6k crore mark, without even touching the principle.\n\nPP had accomplished his mission...that of crippling the entity with massive debt, now he had to help out his friends (Mallya, Rahul Bhatia, Goyal), and a bunch of foreign airlines for a start)\n\n**Strip away market share, assign it to his friends**\n\nThe brazen way in which he did this was BREATHTAKING. This is how it works. Countries sign bilaterals agreements which restrict the number of carriers that can fly into each country. So for instance, India and Singapore might have an agreement that only 3 carriers of each country can fly into the other. So India can have 3 of it\'s carriers and Singapore the same.\n\nProblem for PP here was that AI+IC operated seperate call codes and were different entities flying into the most lucrative destinations like Singapore, Qatar, HK, Dubai amongst others.\n\nNow PP did two things, firstly he parcelled out rights to foreign carriers like Emirates and Lufthansa but without asking for an increased Indian share. In essence he said EQ could fly into India on increased routes, but India did not want a corresponding increase for it\'s carriers! Clearly he must have been well compensated for this yeoman service.\n\nSecond, he unilaterally cut almost 40 highly profitable routes out of India...he simply had AI walk out of their MOST profitable routes, but...you might ask, we still had bilaterals so we did have that extra slot, what happened to them?\n\nSimple, Jet flew into that gap seamlessly, but he needed to figure out a way to help out Mallya and KF also, so he hit upon the worst business idea ever.\n\nMerge the two entities. This instantly freed up one spot on every single bilateral route.\n\nThese two steps combined dropped AI market share (internationally)from the # 1 Indian carrier to # 3...almost overnight.\n\nDebt burden - Check Destroy market share - Check Help friends - Check.\n\n**Only one thing left to do and that is the pesky bureaucrats.**\n\nFire every single IAS official who was reasonably competent\n\nSunil Arora, Arvind Jadhav, Raghav Menon, even the non IAS CMD Gustav Baldaff...all of them tried to fix things and were fired. Replaced by a Praful Patel factotum by the name of V.Thulsidas.\n\n**Miscellaneous Stuff**\n\nPatel got Accenture to do a "revival plan" for a fee of Rs 90 CRORES, a plan that was dumped as useless\n\nPP himself in an RTI query had to say that he used KF almost exclusively for all his domestic travels while forcing AI to upgrade all his family members and friends to business class for whenever they travelled abroad.\n\nCapt Gopinath, who had initally refused to sell to Mallya found that parking bays, hangars, permits etc etc all were almost impossible to obtain and hence was "persuaded" to sell to KF.\n\nAccording to the Radia tapes Praful Patel himself had a stake in Indigo...talk about conflict of interest.\n\nIn summation, ONE MAN destroyed AI and caused it losses running into a billion a year. He and his political master Sonia need to be called to task someday for this.\n\n[Praful Patel doesn\'t fly AI](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/praful-patel-aviation-minister-doesnt-fly-air-india-427588)\n\n[bonus reading](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/praful-patel-plummeted-air-india-into-financial-mess-133323-2011-05-08)\n\n[Disintegration of AI](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/masala-noodles/praful-patel-and-the-disintegration/)\n\n[lovely long form article](https://caravanmagazine.in/reportage/tailspin)\n\nJaggi and First post [https://www.firstpost.com/business/the-praful-patel-guide-to-destroying-ai-revised-edition-34635.html](https://www.firstpost.com/business/the-praful-patel-guide-to-destroying-ai-revised-edition-34635.html)\n\nBastard Patel needs to see jail time for this, but we know he never will.'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'bvuclw'<br />Score:122<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bvuclw/how_air_india_was_destroyed_by_praful_patel_and/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Key Points From the Draft New Education Policy (2019) Part I'<br />Body: 'Link : https://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/Draft_NEP_2019_EN.pdf\n\nThe document itself has 3 parts:\n\n1. School Education\n\n2. College/University Education\n\n3. Additional Key Focus Areas\n\nIn the interest of keeping the discussions focussed and understandable, I have split it into 3 posts.\nThis is part 1.\n\nI would like to give my own background here : studied in a private CBSE school in Bengaluru all the way from primary to 12th.\n\nNow this policy is easily the biggest change to the education system since the old policy came in. It is in many ways, entirely unrecognisable, while in many other ways, simply formalising what was informally already done.\n\nThe first and biggest change, is that primary education, from ages 3-6, is now a formal part of school education, and public school must offer this. The second change, what goes hand in hand, is the abolishing of the 10+2 system. In many ways, the 10+2 system completely ignored the way a student\'s mind developed, and thus made for a poor learning system. The new system is 5+3+3+4. These stages are as follows:\n\n- 5 years of the Foundational Stage: 3 years of pre-primary school and Grades 1, 2.\n\n- 3 years of the Preparatory (or Latter Primary) Stage: Grades 3, 4, 5.\n\n- 3 years of the Middle (or Upper Primary) Stage: Grades 6, 7, 8.\n\n- 4 years of the High (or Secondary) Stage: Grades 9, 10, 11, 12.\n\nThe new Foundational stage, is supposedly meant to be "age fluid". Your age does not matter, as long as you are within the age group 3-8. The Policy recommends this time, there should be no textbook based education, and instead play based and activity based education. It also emphasises on introducing a variety of new "stimuli" to force children\'s brains to develop in a holistic manner. These stimuli include : music (classical or modern, both singing and listening), art (regional, national, sketching, etc.), literature (folk tales, literature from the region, and national quality authors, both modern and classical). This is a massive departure from the present system, and the new emphasis on arts, is excellent. To add to this, a new bilingual policy is introduced. Students who learn languages are shown to have much better cognitive abilities than those don\'t so the new system makes all students learn 2 languages right from the start. One of these has to be the mother tongue, in order to preserve it. The other language may vary by region and requirements. The three language policy remains, but I\'m not sure exactly when a third language will be taught. The final changes to the primary education, is the integration of "anganwadis" into schools, and shifting them from primarily health workers, to full scale trained teachers, satisfying the needs of the students. Another thing the policy requires is the full development of people-skills, through a variety of things like weekly assemblies, to daily show-and-tells. This improves the speaking ability, something that IMO Indian students have historically been terrible at. New extras include group reading of stories, learning morality and ethics (along with a proper framework), puzzle solving of various types, etc. to make sure a child has a significantly better development. Students who fall behind are not left out, instead the teachers are required to identify and help them, as studies suggest that students who fall back early almost never recover.\n\nThe next "Preparatory stage" lays emphasis on shifting from a more informal style in the Foundation stage, to a more formal textbook oriented education, in the Middle stage. It is a bridge stage. Please not that the policy emphasises that any and all technical education *must* take place in the native language (mother tongue) first. This is because students who learn in their mother tongue have a noticeable advantage over those who learn in say English. The policy also has a very good writeup on why the emphasis on English has hurt India a lot, in many ways. The preparatory stage also keeps this focus on arts, and expects students to fully develop other skills beyond the "textbook education". The policy also demands the abolishing of the so called "co-curricular activities" instead integrating them into the core curriculum. This makes things like PE, yoga, art, music, a core part of the education, as opposed to "side stuff". It also requires that every student specialise in at least one of these subjects. Another new concept here is the selection of the best students, to help the worst students. The best students are selected by the teacher, and then become part of a sort of "national training system".\n\nThe third stage is the "Middle Stage". By this time, the student\'s mid would have developed enough. It is now time to start the fully formal education. Subjects start splitting from generic versions into more detailed subjects (like science -&gt; physics + chemistry + biology). Students at this point will slowly start to also learn technical subjects in English. The idea is that students will be able to think in their mother tongue (which has a lot of advantages), while being able to understand and present ideas in English.\n\nThe fourth, and final stage is the "High Stage". At this point, students have developed a lot. Their mind now starts thinking in "the bigger picture" mode, and they can start planning for the rest of their life. In order to support this, students are now allowed to freely select courses and specialise. They are still required to understand and complete art courses, as this is paramount to their abilities, regardless of the final course they choose.\n\nSome important courses that come over the 12 years include : course on ethics and morality, Indian languages and their history, regional literature, \n\nThe next major changes come to the school management system. Schools can now form "complexes". A complex is comprised of nearby schools, such that each complex has at least one school offering the above stages, i.e., a student in this complex can complete their entire school level education without leaving the complex. Complexes are then given funds and other resources, like teachers. These resources may then be split up among the schools as necessary. This is important, because some types of teachers are relatively rare, and thus it provides optimal utilisation of resources. Sometimes other resources like libraries may also be shared. The exact details of what is shared will vary depending of the schools and their locality (population density, and "backwardness" of the population).\n\nSchools also get a new level of autonomy, that was previously missing. Teachers are allowed to be the final deciders on the courses, and how they will be taught.\n\nIn order to improve attendance, the schools will do a number of things. Depending on the area, buses may be provided. Roads will be redone, so that transport is easier. Older students will be provided with free bicycles. The mid day meals will also be extended to offer basic breakfast to students. Adequate and safe infrastructure, including working toilets, clean drinking water, clean and attractive spaces conducive to learning, electricity, computing devices, and internet, will be important to provide to all schools.\n\nTo reduce inequality is a primary goal of the new policy. In order to do this, each school complex will have committee overseeing the demographics, and why students aren\'t attending. Specific groups called out include Muslims (for unwillingness to attend), and women in general. The policy requires that people of all castes and religions be integrated into the schools. The teachers are also required to emphasise on equality, by preventing acts that discriminate (e.g. not allowing SC/STs to sit with "upper caste students", etc.). The schools are required to join with the community in eradicating inequality. They are required to talk with parents and try and change their behaviour. This could be the groundwork to eliminating the reservation system. The policy sets the target of 2030, by which the majority of the students will be "equalised", not by pulling down the richer and higher caste, but by pulling up the poorer and downtrodden. Special Education Zones will be set up in disadvantaged regions across the country. The Central government will support extra investment and per-child expenditure in the ratio of 2:1 for each rupee spent by the State in these Zones. A special National Fund will be created specifically for providing scholarships and developing resources and facilities for students from Under Represented Groups.\n\nThe next set of changes are aimed at teachers. The primary aims are to improve teacher pay, and status in society. It recognises that teachers are already heavily burdened with a lot of work, so no government work may be offloaded onto teachers. They are also educated better, and stricter standards are set. Teachers are required to "re-educate" themselves by joining workshops, and the vertical mobility of teacher is to be improved. Teacher education will gradually be moved into multidisciplinary colleges and universities. By 2030, the minimum degree qualification for teaching will be a four-year liberal integrated B.Ed. degree that teaches a range of knowledge content and pedagogy.\nDevelopmental opportunities, in the form of local, State, national, and international teaching and subject workshops, as well as online teacher development modules, will be available to all teachers. Substandard stand-alone Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs) across the country will be shut down as soon as possible. New teachers will have to register with an authority, and then will be quickly shifted into a school complex, for integration with the schools as necessary.\n\nThe next major changes comes to the testing system. The new system will be run by the National Testing Agency (which was newly set up in 2017 for entrance exams). They will be conducting the tests, and the new tests will be more like aptitude tests.  They will de-emphasise rote learning, instead encouraging an understanding of the subject. The policy claims that by 2020, all schools will have internet connected computers. It thus pushes for some degree of digitisation, by allowing for continuous evaluation through computers. Board exams in 10th and 12th are no longer. Instead we have exams in 3rd, 5th and 8th, called Census exams. The idea is to reduce the importance of Board exams. Teachers will also be more involved in the governance of schools and school complexes.\n\nThe RTE act sees some changes. It is now extended to the full duration of school, from ages 3-18. The RTE act itself will have to be reviewed, as the policy notes.\n\nAs for private institutions, there has been some misinformation. Private institutions will have to undergo some changes to have a similar system, so that they too can reach out to all students. The main changes are how fees is regulated. Fees needs to be rationalised, and can\'t be arbitrarily high. Once set, fee increments must go inline with inflation and reasonable increases, as opposed to random increases. Schools are also now required by law to be non-profit, and must be verified regularly by submitting all of their financial details. Private schools are also prohibited from having the word "public" in their name. So be prepared to see a lot of name changes.\n\nSchools will now also be accredited and regulated in a slightly more free manner. However, they are required to release all details to the public. A framework and guidelines for ensuring school safety and security of children will be developed, and will be made a part of the eligibility conditions for a school education institution for recognition and registration. Every principal and teacher will be made aware of the provisions of the relevant Acts, Rules, Regulations, etc. relating to child rights, and what constitutes their violation, by including a module in the teachers’/principals’ education/training programmes and refresher courses .Self-learning online programmes on child rights will be developed for the benefit of students, teachers, and parents. Credible mechanisms for students to report breaches of their rights, and for appropriate actions to be taken against perpetrators, will be developed and implemented, in collaboration with local police. The Adolescent Education Programme and National Population Education Programme will be integrated into the curriculum of schools in a phased manner. (please note that Adolescent Education Programme is not sex education).\n\nSo that concludes the major changes. Now for the comparison with the existing system:\n\nThe existing system failed primarily in 2 ways: Languages were poorly integrated, and many schools did not even offer three languages, as the policy notes. Hindi speaking states were the primary offenders. The other way was in testing. NCF (2005) laid heavy focus on eliminating rote learning, and in introducing a system where discovery based education was encouraged. The 10th grade NCERT textbook for science is a testament to that. Yet the system failed, because tests were primarily focussed on facts. Tests emphasised on how well a student could mug up and vomit arbitrary facts, instead of trying to test a deeper understanding of the subject. The new policy does try to fix this, but how much will improve remains to be seen.\n\nThe other more minor ways in which it failed was the integration of "extra curricular" subjects. Many schools actually refused to teach these subjects, considering them a time waste. The new system makes them a core part of the education system, so there should eb an improvement, but I remain sceptical.\n\nPlease discuss, and if you have any doubts, feel free to ask.'<br />Author: 'gryphus-scarface'  id: 'bvtnrb'<br />Score:173<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bvtnrb/key_points_from_the_draft_new_education_policy/</li>

For example, why do most Indians call themselves as Hindus and are increasingly subscribing to Hindutva. Why have people always been suspicious of foreign imports like Abrahamic religions, Communism, Western languages and laws, etc. And I came to the following conclusion:\n\nThroughout the millennias, most people who lived in the Indian Subcontinent have always considered themselves to be different to those outside of it. Two major reasons for this exceptionalist identity is India's unique **geography and climate**. \n\nGeography because the Subcontinent is almost fully enclosed by mountains, with the exception of Khyber Pass (hence the reason why Pakistan is the way it is). So Indians have always had more contact with each other than outsiders, and this influenced the creation of a unique culture and identity. Climate because the monsoon has also tremendously impacted Indian culture. \n\nAnd the reason for India's unique geography and climate is because of the **Indian tectonic plate**, which moves independently from the Eurasian and Arabian plates. So if you're a liberal, who's scratching your brilliant head as to why are most Indians Hindu nationalist instead of globalist and secularist, blame the Indian tectonic plate.\n\nLooking forward to your opinions on this."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'bvkutn'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bvkutn/is_indias_geology_the_root_cause_for_strong/</li>

      <li>Title::: "An interesting take on Indian elections by Shekhar Gupta at Centre for Policy Research on 'How India Voted'"<br />Body: "This is going to be a long read but one of the best post-election analysis that I've seen. I have transcribed, paraphrased, and highlighted was Gupta said [here](https://youtu.be/mL5quXQzLkY?t=4925).\n\nToday Congress and the rest can complain about resources but in 2014 Congress was in power and Modi was an outsider. To analyse this, first of all we need to forget our voting preferences. We have to now admit that Modi’s rise is not a fraud on India. Modi’s is a phenomenon and has had a better story and a better product for almost a decade. \n\nSince it suited everybody around Congress, they said BJP lost due to 'India Shining'. Cut down those number : **BJP just got 9 seats less than Congress. BJP lost because of Gujarat 2002 where so many regional parties that earlier went along with BJP were no longer willing to ally with them (Mamata, CBN) because BJP could not fire Modi for 2002.**\n\nAnother myth was spread after 2009 - **you see the incumbent comes back with a larger majority than the previous one. Who do you then give credit to? Now if you give credit to MMS, it’s an outrage in the Congress party.** So you have to find an excuse to give credit to Mrs.Gandhi and whatever she had done. So you say loan waivers and MNREGA. \n\nIn urban areas, where least poor 30% people live Congress party’s strike rate in 2009 was 68%. In the areas where 65/70-% of Indias poorest live, Congress party’s strike rate was 30 something percent. This data was available, and the party was not willing to see the reasons - that **India had seen 7 years of breathless growth and because the intellectual establishment and political darbaar of the Congress party was not willing to accept that, they undermined UPA2**, pushed it back - people got so angry who got used to growth people brought in Modi from Gujarat because he’ll bring you something. So sometimes we make convenient analysis which becomes our pitfall. \n\n**In this election campaign, the most striking thing was Modi getting away with saying that nothing happened in this country before 2014** - that history of this country begins in 2014. That is not true. **The previous 10 years had a lot of growth, built a lot of infrastructure - many things happened**. Look at the way global economic downturn was handled by India, it was a great economic success story. Look at how Satyam was handled. But the amazing thing was, in so many days of campaigning I never heard anyone from the Congress party say anything about what their govt did under UPA2. \n\n**This is the autoimmune disease of the Congress party. This Congress party wants to blame Modi, media - they’re watching the wrong channels. That fact is the only achievements the Congress party was willing to talk about was not even of Rajiv Gandhi but of Indira Gandhi when 80% of the voters are born after Indira Gandhi had passed away.** So don’t blame others. Look inside - the voter is transactional. The transaction that the voters is NREGA money, the gas cylinder, or it can also be the pride/security of the country and how good is the leader. \n\n\n**First of all this idea of keeping India secular has been outsourced to it’s 15% muslims. This idea of secular vote, the same muslims vote no? The muslims are fed up because nobody does anybody for them but you keep dragging them everywhere as if it’s their responsibility.** You have to save secularism, I have the Yadavs with me, so and so will bring the Dalits. Dalits are not with her anymore. She has has 10 seats, Akhilesh has 5 seats. But that tells you that Mayawati is finished. Because that tells you that Akhilesh has been able to transfer his Muslim votes to her, but she hasn’t been able to transfer her Dalit votes to him. Because Dalit votes are now changing.\n\nYou know, this time as I drove around the country I would just get ordinary people and ask who are you voting for and why and record it. I have 60 of these recordings. All 60 are voting for Modi. This north KA, south KA, Bengal, UP, Bihar, MP, Rajasthan, Haryana. See you can blame media, money, whatever - **if in Haryana if BJP can get 68% vote, and Haryana’s premier Jatt party INLD only gets 1.8% that tells you, that you are looking at something else.** Somebody just had a much better product. So respect the verdict, but for that first you have to first accept that there was a much better product on offer. \n\nPeople have been defeated despite money. Look at CBN, he wasn’t short of Money in Andhra. You can have a great organisation but you need to have workers who have the commitment. Look at what YS Reddy has built in AP. It’s an organisation that can fight BJP anyway. Look at Mamata in WB - if it weren’t for BJP would have gotten 35 seats. \n\n**The voter in this country does not trust Congress schemes. Forget it. Anything that happened in the past, very little got to her. This time LPG, the house - even if the govt didn’t build the house for you they gave you 1.5 lac. I was looking for evidence to the contrary but we were not finding it. We were finding gas cylinders - we would even peek inside the houses and found gas cylinders. You build a house govt gave you 1.5 lac, you build a toilet and govt gave you 15k. The govt didn’t build anything for you - they use Direct Benefit Transfer. They used something that in this city everyday gets angry about. The used the JAM trinity. Jandhan - Aadhar - Mudra loans. Initially I thought Mudra loans were all rubbish and they were all fake. But I have videos of a Dalit saying that I got 50K mudra loans to build a chai shop and I pay 1300 back and if I don’t the branch manager comes. Check the data - 4.81 cr have gotten Mudra loans and 2.1 cr loans has been disposed.**\n\n**I have to say, we journalists and commentariat chose not to see it. Even when we see it, we compulsively tried to deny it. “Oh they’ve got gas cylinders - but they cant afford the next one”. But the fact is they got one. “Oh the next one is full price” - that is a lie - the next one is not full price. Next one you pay the full price and you get your subsidy account back in bank account. But once you have the connection - you’re empowered. Once you have the toilet, “Oh but water is not there” - but the water will come. The fact is these people had never seen delivery of anything. And even if they got anything they did not see anything they could get without having to bribe including In most cases the NREGA wages.** So this is a big change. This is a big governance exercise - you may like it or not like it. But smart people will learn from it. KCR did, Babu did it and now Jagan will do it. Non-smart people will complain about. \n\nIt’s wrong to say this is only Hindutva. Hindutva has helped Modi consolidate upper caste. I have never seen any caste vote bank so cohesive. Because they also see him as this guy having protected “merit” . Ensure that these other “faltus” don’t walk into this territory. He has taken away all the other OBC’s simply because caste based parties became family run parties. Because SP &amp; RJD family run Yadav parties - Yadav stayed there, other OBC’s fled. Similarly for Dalits - jatavs became powerful, the rest have fled. These are really big changes. \n\nIn a lot of rallies, Rahul spoke out “Chowkidar char hai” - a lot of people spoke out went back saying “Ye angrez Aadmi hai, jo apna desi Aadmi hai our khudse banke Maya hai use chor Bol haha hai” . There was this video going around where Priyanka was talking about Rahul being black belt, diving etc. This was being circulated by the other side! The ordinary people were saying they also wanted to dive, become a pilot. So they started asking what does Rahul do that he has so much money. This India hates elitism. Modi is now elite - he dresses well, he’s got style. People say he has earned it unlike you guys who came because your daddy gave it to you."<br />Author: 'ExMuslimHyderabad'  id: 'bvhl0i'<br />Score:31<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bvhl0i/an_interesting_take_on_indian_elections_by/</li>

This is what we prize most of all although this has been dimnished yet not disappered. From Tulsidas to Dinkar, Kabir to Nirala, Nanak to Premchand this is what has been reflected in everything that have defined our identity. This is what we all spire to whether consciously or subconsciously. This is what has united us against Islamic invaders, British, Portugese or Dutch. This is the core of our identity and this is my personal opinion but Indic culture would disappear when this does.\n\nThe aspiration of these goals of life is our take on the tragedy called life which is full of sorrows. Artha, Kama, Dharma, Moksha. These simple words contain the essence of the ethos of this land as we know it. For better defintion if you are unfamiliar it's this-\n\n* Artha-  The pursuit of things that enables us to be alive. Artha is the quintessential need as basic needs to be alive i.e. Roti, Kapda, Makaan. whatever enables to survive and be alive. When you can't live how can you enjoy anything. Further reading tha I recommend highly is Arthashastra.\n\n* Kama - The pursuit of things that gives us pleasures. Whether sex, good food, beauty or music. Our Indriyas(the five senses of sight, taste, sound, smell and touch). Sense in Sankhya's context is important as we(the purush or consciousness) are in this world to enjoy the prakriti(which is nature or worldly) and what is point if we can't even enjoy this. Further reading and I highly highly recommend reading is the text of Kamasutra. Do read as the nature of  the materialistic western society is in Kama. You would get to know the modrated way as opposed to the excessive indulgence way of the west on the path of Kama.\n\n* Dharma -  Not the definition that you already know as religion. Dharma is much much deeper than that. Without Dharma we live in an unjust society. Why live when the society is unjust and unfair. But I warn that the path of Dharma is subtle as upposed to gross way of Artha and Kama. In a society with all the means to live and with endless pleasure that the world can offer you without Dharma cannot fulfil the void that you find in yourself inside you. I believe this resonates with every single person in an urban setting. The west especailly communist society find themselves at this precipies. The lack of Dharma is what breeds discontent and to fill that discontent the society gives birth to elitism and an illusion of rightousness which you can see in the current left. Further reading should be supplemented by Bhagvad Gita.\n\n* Moksha - If you would remember from the previous posts on this series that I talked a lot about pure Purusha(consciousness). This is what Moksha is. Experiencing purusha forever despite living in prakriti which gives you freedom from the unreal. Remember my definition that the only thing real is something that doesn't change like death, change, consciousness. Anything that changes like your own body, geography, chemicals, language, political parties, ideology are unreal. When you are free from these then you attain Moksha. This is true bliss and as someone who has temperoraily has experienced this it's the most beautiful thing you would ever expirence. Nothing matters and what matters is you and you alone yer everything does. Language is a fickle thing and you need to see for yourself for this. There are many paths to it and Sankhya is just one of them. Again note that truth itself isn't real and it may or may not lead you to it depending on the circumstance of it. Further reading itslef is Bhagavad Gita. \n\nThese are the things everything that a Hindu must aspire to. I have found these in Ramayana, Mahabharata to the ghazals. Regardless of religion or region, caste or varna, poverty or riches these are what sustains us as a civilization.But the path itself is difficlult. No one can teach you how to pursue this as the context of every single human being is different and you would have to find your path itself. One advice which I can give you is remove your Ahankara(false ego). Identifying itself is very very difficult let alone remove it. \n\nThe path that Hindu ethos shows is Yoga. It's not a bunch of excercises as the west has appropriated but something much different. Sankhya and yoga are something that are indivisable yet different. Remembering these 4 Purushartha regardless if you agree with my philosphy without a doubt would enable you to lead a fulfiling life reagradless of what you are seeking and what your context is."<br />Author: 'srthk'  id: 'bv9xmj'<br />Score:59<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bv9xmj/reviving_sankhya_3_the_4_purushartha/</li>
