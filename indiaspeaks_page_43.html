      <li>Title::: 'Tanaji Malusare movie vs reality...'<br />Body: 'Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior review-\nGreat acting by Ajay, Saif, Sharad Kelkar, Kajol and others. A lot of CGI/effects put to decent use(watched in 2D). Good build of the story in creating the visuals of 16th century, showing the greatness of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in building hindavi swarajya in those critical times. Everything is fine until last minute of the movie, I couldn\'t believe they made a disappointing twist to the story at the end. Almost every Maharashtrian kid grows up reading the original story and I kept waiting for the moment where shelar mama cuts (or orders to cut and Suryaji cuts) the ropes which never came. The movie ends abruptly after Tanaji-Udaybhan fight. That to me, misses the spirit of this historical battle which Suryaji and others fought back hard after losing their leader. I am not writing what was exactly shown in the movie to avoid spoilers.\n\nOriginal story: \n"In March of 1670, in the middle of one night, Tanaji Malusare attacked Kondhana(later Sinhgad) on Shivaji’s orders. He, his brother Suryaji and his maternal uncle Shelar mama, and the soldiers climbed the cliffs to enter the fort and caught the fort army by surprise. In the battle that ensued, Tanaji was killed. The soldiers started running back to the ropes they used to climb. At this time, Shelar mama ordered to cut the ropes, cutting the only retreat option of soldiers. Soldiers turned back and Maratha army won the fort."\n\nThere is no question about dedication and bravery of Tanaji. However the award for excellent military tactics goes to Shelarmama/Suryaji. Sadly after 100 years, Maratha army lacked any Shelarmama on the battleground of Panipat. When Vishwasrao fell, Maratha army dissolved, leaving giant wound on Marathas that would take decades to heal.\n\nMay it be battleground, or may it be personal life. One thing is clear. History cannot be made unless the ropes to retreat are cut off.\n\n#Tanhaji #TanajiMalusare #Sinhgad'<br />Author: 'shaunpb'  id: 'eppu01'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eppu01/tanaji_malusare_movie_vs_reality/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Must read article by Gaurav Pradhan on RSS and Nehruvian policies'<br />Body: 'Everyone from Sagarika Ghose to Amartya Sen, middle aged JNU scholars to Communists of Kerala, Pashant Bhushan to Sundry Congress person, Mamta Banerjee to even Imran Khan is lamenting the Lost World that was Nehru\'s India. Looking at so many "Eminent Intellectuals" shedding copious tears for the legacy destroyed by Narendra Modi, it would be fair to look back and assess "What exactly have we lost ?"\n\nWhat did Nehruvian Legacy mean ? Here is an attempt to understand the difference between Nehru\'s India, the Lost World and Modi-fied India, the Jurassic Park.\n\nIn Nehru\'s India, Muslim League was an alliance partner of Congress party but any party talking of Hindu causes was divisive. National Conference, the family enterprise of Abdullahs was originally All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference. That, we must understand wasn\'t against the secular spirit of the nation. But RSS or Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was a Jurassic Park of dinosaurs and that is why they blocked it out of national debate.\n\nIn Nehru\'s India, the constitution gave everyone the right to practice, preach and propagate one\'s religion. Thus mass conversions by Evangelical organizations was a matter of right but "Ghar Wapsi" was communal and hence condemned. In a strange development, the Evangelists and Islamist groups feel the Anti-conversion law is against them but they want Ghar Wapsi to be outlawed.\n\nIn Nehru\'s India, RSS that trained cadre in self defense with sticks was a dangerous terrorist organization and the Maoists were "Gandhians with guns". RSS collected funds and sent tribal children to modern schools. Hurriyat leaders hired Kashmiri children to pelt stones at Indian security forces. Maoists collected funds and gave guns and rocket launchers to tribal children. But Nehruvian legacy always wanted dialogue with Hurriyat and Maoists and isolate RSS.\n\nIn Nehru\'s India, the Congress and other Secular parties wanted to hold talks, even with Pakistan but RSS was untouchable. A secular Politician or a former President could openly meet Hurriyat leaders, share information with them and break Iftaar with them. But attending RSS function was a huge taboo. In a total travesty of all that was sacrosanct in Nehruvian worldview, one RSS man is the President of India, second one is Vice President and the third RSS man is Prime Minister.\n\nIn Nehru\'s India, we were taught only about Invaders, the benevolent Mughals, Bapu Gandhi, Chacha Nehru and Independence. All others were just footnotes in the history books in schools. Today, the unbridled social media is countering those thousands of "well-intentioned, sugarcoated untruths" of Nehruvian Historians. All the Secular Historians wanted was to keep the atrocities of Islamic invaders buried and create a peaceful India. The Nehru\'s India, where Hindus had to feel ashamed of their past and Muslims had to be proud about their ancestors. This noble Nehruvian thought train has been derailed after decades of smooth ride.\n\nIn Nehru\'s India, we were preached not to hate the Muslims of today for the alleged atrocities of their ancestors. But in Nehru\'s India, we were also told, Brahmins were responsible for all the problems faced by this country. Allama Iqbal, the "Spiritual Father of Pakistan" was a hero in Nehru\'s India while Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was a traitor and villain. In essence, Brahmin hate was necessary for the continuation of "Divide and Rule policy" but we should keep out Islamophobia.\n\nIn Nehru\'s India, "Minorities, especially the Muslims have the first rights over the resources of the nation", said a Prime Minister and that was epitome of secularism. But when another Prime Minister said, "Progress for all, appeasement of none", that was marginalizing of minorities.\n\nIn Nehru\'s India, awards, rewards, positions of power, institutions, control over the narrative and the right to moral policy were controlled by a miniscule minority concentrated around Luteyen\'s Delhi. Imposters were not allowed anywhere near this closed circle of entitled few. With an imposter as Prime Minister, the Nehruvian Legacy truly has been damaged.\n\nIn Nehru\'s India, there was so much of democracy, it was overflowing everywhere. Journalists, Industrialists, shady middle men, Radiating lobbyists and practically anyone could decide who would be or who should be Minister in the Union Cabinet. Gone are those lovely days. Nobody outside PMO and RSS top echelons knows who will be a Minister, leave alone portfolio allocations.\n\nIn Nehru\'s India, celebrity journalists could telecast live, the rescue efforts during terror strikes and "inadvertently" help the terrorists. We also had "satellite phone carrying "brave journalists accidentally" betraying our armed forces and getting our soldiers shelled by Pakistani forces. In De-Nehrufied India, the brilliant, know all journalists have been reduced to merely reporting Surgical strikes and Airstrikes with ghastly disbelief. In short, the media has been robbed of their right to (leak) information.\n\nIn Nehru\'s India, the less than 0.001% self proclaimed Intellectuals or Left Liberals dictated terms on our Nuclear policy, International policies and Economic policies. The changed world order has shattered this well entrenched equilibrium. They now can only write and read how horrible the policies of present government are, long after the policies are implemented.\n\nIn Nehru\'s India, there was an abundance of patience. Pakistan could go on and on sending terrorists and trigger bomb blasts in India. India were always ready for never-ending dialogue. Sometimes, they reluctantly put conditions like, "Stop cross-border terrorism" for talks with Pakistan. The "Aman Ki Aasha" gangs would immediately remind the government of the importance to adhere to Nehruvian egalitarianism. There was unlimited scope for dialogue as long as the other side didn\'t talk about petty issues like ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Hindus. All those Lahore Biriyani and Karachi Wine dialogues have been rendered redundant by the Modi-fied India.\n\nIn Nehru\'s India, victims in a communal violence could only be Muslims or Christians. The only cause for all strife was Brahminical Patriarchy. But if Hindus were the targets of communal violence or ethnic cleansing, there always had to be some justification. Justification like agrarian crisis in Malabar, socioeconomic disparities between the rich Hindus and poor Muslims in Kashmir, road-rage in Delhi, some kind of prior instigation on behalf of the victims of violence in Godhra and many more. The social media has become ruthless in these Un-Nehruing modern times. It just doesn\'t allow the Nehruvian Legacy to run away with the narrative like they always did in the good old days.\n\nTo sum it all up, Imran Khan and his Nobel cheerleaders on this side of LOC are right. This unfortunately isn\'t Nehru\'s India anymore. This is RSS version of India. There are nor privileges in this India neither perks for being a Nehruvian liberal. The moderate pacifist whose heart used to bleed for Palestinians, Maoists, Burhan Wani and everyone else except Hindu victims has become undesirable stranger today. The dinosaurs have woken up after over 1000 years of slumber, suppression and slothful subsistence.\n\nWelcome to the Jurassic Park !'<br />Author: 'apadipodu'  id: 'epiza0'<br />Score:53<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/epiza0/must_read_article_by_gaurav_pradhan_on_rss_and/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Discussing the CAA with the Opposers.'<br />Body: "So,this has been oft repeated. But then here are my justifications for the CAA.\n\n1. It supports the Religious minorities who have fled the three aforesaid countries and want citizenship. There are some glaring omissions such as the Atheists and the Tribals of Pakistan and Bangladesh. However, it's a workable solution which can be improved over time. \n\nIn the case of Pakistani Hindus and other minorities,in case they return to Pakistan because their visas expire,or they aren't granted the status of refugees,there is another factors which come into play. \n\nThe Hindus who return to Pakistan (on expiry of their visas) are normally forcibly converted-\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/m.timesofindia.com/city/jaipur/over-500-hindus-converted-to-islam-in-pakistan/amp_articleshow/63538595.cms\n\nThe above Article shows as to how people enmasse converted to Islam. Some reports state that they were converted at gun point. \n\nSo,in essence,they're stuck in India. They won't be going back and if they go, they'll be converted immediately. \n\nFor arguments which say that Ahmadiyas and Rohingyas should be subject to similar treatment? Ofcourse,they will be. So Ahmadiya Refugees should never be sent back(In case of the Rohingyas,they've been returning back by their own accord). However,when it comes to citizenship,I do believe that the matters are different altogether. \n\nMany communities,not just Rohingyas,maintain affinities to their homelands and are content with the status of permanent residence and asylum. They don't want Citizenship. There have been some anecdotal cases like these-\n\nhttps://thewire.in/rights/caa-india-refugees/amp/\n\nIn the above articles,most of the refugees highlight their desires to go back to their homelands once the conflicts end. This isn't the case with them only-In case of the well established Tibetans,it's similar too:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN19D019\n\nMost Tibetans don't see India as their place of indefinite residence. They'd like to return back to Tibet in an ideal situation. Just like the Rohingyas or Hazaras. \n\nHowever,in the case of Pakistani Hindus,they stand convinced that the fundamental nature of the state of Pakistan (which discriminates against them legally) is unlikely to change. Therefore,they ultimately conceive India as their homeland, unlike the other refugees. Therefore,I do think that the CAA makes sense."<br />Author: 'memetasticqueer'  id: 'ep52v9'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ep52v9/discussing_the_caa_with_the_opposers/</li>

Within a few days, the\xa0Marathas\xa0captured\xa0Panhala\xa0fort (near the city of\xa0Kolhapur). Meanwhile, another Maratha force, led by\xa0Netaji Palkar, pushed straight on towards Bijapur. Bijapur repulsed this attack, forcing Shivaji, some of his commanders and soldiers to retreat to Panhala fort.\n\nThe Bijapuri force was led by Siddhi Johar, an\xa0Abyssinian\xa0general. Discovering Shivaji's location, Johar laid siege to\xa0Panhala. Netaji Palkar made repeated attempts to break the Bijapuri siege from outside, but these failed.\n\nFinally, a very audacious and high-risk plan was hatched and put into action: Shivaji, Baji Prabhu Deshpande with a select band of troops would attempt to break through the siege at the night, and make for\xa0Vishalgad. In order to deceive the Bijapuri forces, who would give a chase once they found that Shivaji had broken the siege, Shiva Nhavi, who had an uncanny physical resemblance to Shivaji, volunteered to dress like the king and let himself be captured.\n\nOn a stormy full moon's night (night of Guru Pournima, Ashadh Paurnima) a band of 600 select men, led by Baji Prabhu and Shivaji, broke through the siege. They were hotly pursued by the Bijapuri force. As planned, Shiva Nhavi allowed himself to be captured and taken back to the Bijapuri camp, fully comprehending that he would be put to death once the charade was discovered. This sacrifice, however, gave the fleeing Maratha force some breathing space.\n\nAs soon as the Bijapuri force realized their mistake, the chase was on again, led by Siddhi Masood, the son-in-law of Siddhi Johar. Near the pass of Ghodkhind (Horse's Pass), the Marathas made a final stand. Shivaji and half of the Maratha force pushed for Vishalgadh, while Baji Prabhu, his brother Phulaji and the remaining\xa0Bandal Sena\xa0of about 300 men blocked the pass and fought against 10000 Bijapuri soldiers in the\xa0Ghodkhind Pass\xa0for more than 18 hours.\n\nTradition and legend describe feats of valour displayed by the Marathas during this rear-guard action. Through the entire battle, Baji Prabhu, even though grievously injured, continued fighting, inspiring his men to fight on until Shivaji's safe journey to Vishalgadh was signaled by the firing of three cannon volleys. It should be mentioned that when Shivaji approached Vishalgad with 300 men, the fort was already under\xa0siege\xa0by Bijapuri sardars named Suryarao Surve and Jaswantrao Dalvi. Shivaji with his 300 men had to defeat Surve to reach the fort."<br />Author: 'EngancheIN'  id: 'ep3223'<br />Score:37<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ep3223/the_man_who_saved_hinduism_baji_prabhu_deshpande/</li>

There are references of how Bhagat Singh was deeply influenced by a small English biography of Savarkar that he read in the Dwarkadas Library of Lahore. 83 Copies of the book were found during raids conducted on all the members of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) who were accused in the Lahore Conspiracy Case (1928–31), including Bhagat Singh. This fact is bolstered by a first-person account given by Durga Das Khanna in an interview in 1976. \\[...\\] Bhagat Singh and his associates expected new recruits to the HSRA to not only read about the Russian Revolution and the Irish Republican Army, but also Vinayak Damodar Savarkar’s life story.”\n3.

Bharat is neither secular nor theocratic, socialist/communist nor capitalist/fascist, sexist nor ableist, or any other simplistic binary Western political-economic ideology; it is a Dharmic rashtra which is closest embodied as \'unity in diversity, out of many, one for all, all for one\' or Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.\n\n[Religion Vs Dharma](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_875314)\n\n&gt; The word "dharma" has multiple meanings depending on the context in which it is used. Monier-Williams\' Sanskrit-English Dictionary lists several, including: conduct, duty, right, justice, virtue, morality, religion, religious merit, good work according to a right or rule, etc. Many other meanings have been suggested, such as law or "torah" (in the Judaic sense), "logos" (Greek), "way" (Christian) and even \'tao" (Chinese). None of these is entirely accurate and none conveys the full force of the term in Sanskrit. Dharma has no equivalent in the Western lexicon.\n\n&gt; Dharma has the Sanskrit root dhri, which means "that which upholds" or "that without which nothing can stand" or "that which maintains the stability and harmony of the universe." Dharma encompasses the natural, innate behavior of things, duty, law, ethics, virtue, etc. Every entity in the cosmos has its particular dharma -- from the electron, which has the dharma to move in a certain manner, to the clouds, galaxies, plants, insects, and of course, man. Man\'s understanding of the dharma of inanimate things is what we now call physics.\n\n&gt; British colonialists endeavored to map Indian traditions onto their ideas of religion so as to be able to comprehend and govern their subjects; yet the notion of dharma remained elusive. The common translation into religion is misleading since, to most Westerners, a genuine religion must:\n\n&gt; 1) be based on a single canon of scripture given by God in a precisely defined historical event;\n2) involve worship of the divine who is distinct from ourselves and the cosmos;\n3) be governed by some human authority such as the church;\n4) consist of formal members;\n5) be presided over by an ordained clergyman; and\n6) use a standard set of rituals.\n\n&gt; But dharma is not limited to a particular creed or specific form of worship. To the Westerner, an "atheistic religion" would be a contradiction in terms, but in Buddhism, Jainism and Carvaka dharma, there is no place for God as conventionally defined. In some Hindu systems the exact status of God is debatable. Nor is there only a single standard deity, and one may worship one\'s own ishta-devata, or chosen deity.\n\n&gt; Dharma provides the principles for the harmonious fulfillment of all aspects of life, namely, the acquisition of wealth and power (artha), fulfillment of desires (kama), and liberation (moksha). Religion, then, is only one subset of dharma\'s scope.\n\n&gt; Religion applies only to human beings and not to the entire cosmos; there is no religion of electrons, monkeys, plants and galaxies, whereas all of them have their dharma even if they carry it out without intention.\n\n&gt; Since the essence of humanity is divinity, it is possible for them to know their dharma through direct experience without any external intervention or recourse to history. In Western religions, the central law of the world and its peoples is singular and unified, and revealed and governed from above.\n\n&gt; In dharmic traditions, the word a-dharma applies to humans who fail to perform righteously; it does not mean refusal to embrace a given set of propositions as a belief system or disobedience to a set of commandments or canons.\n\n[Secularism Vs Dharma](https://youtu.be/UI2tRm7cf8U)\n\n&gt; So, in this book \'Being Different\', I would like you to read a chapter on \'Secularism and Dharma\'. I will give you a synopsis. Secularism is a Western concept, to solve a western problem. Those of you who have a sense of Medicine, know that you need to solve the disease, but you cannot put that solution where there is a different disease. The problem in Western Religion was the \'Exclusivity Claim\', which means \'Only I am Right, others are Wrong\', which is built into the western religion. Not only, the \'Religious claim\' of the Church, that it is the ONLY bona-fide religion and others are not Valid, but also Science if it questions, has to be killed or persecuted, because even Science cannot have it own independent inquiry.\n\n&gt; So, This was the state of European culture, European intellectual life for a long time. And a reformation to limit the powers of the church, because the church was asserting the Official powers (It had the Fatwa Power), the Bishops could announce Police authority, arrest people, kill people and they did that in Millions for a long period of time. So, Secularism was to curtail the excessive State Authority and State Power that the Church had, not only over the people who dissented and belong to some other religion, but also people who were Scientists.\n\n&gt; In India, the Dharma never had a posture against scientific inquiry. The Raja never had authority to impose his dharma over others. Manu was very clear that Raja must practise his dharma, and he must allow others to practise their dharma. In fact, not only its theoretically the case, but in practise like, when the early Syrian Christians came, the Raja even gave them Land, so as when the Zoroastrians from Persia came to India, they were also given land to live and practice their religion. And Hinduism is not necessarily a one religion like in a western sense, it got a lot of claims within it, there are people who believe in different philosophies, there are people who are Atheists, which is also ok, you can be a Nastik.\nSo, there is a built-in \'Pluralism\' within the Dharma has made it different than the built-in \'Exclusivity\' in the Abrahamic religions. And I explained (in book being different) why exclusivity is built-in abrahamic religions, because of the historical prophets being exclusive, and One prophet has to be Right and others have to be Wrong. I gave it a term \'History Centricism\'.\n\n&gt; Now, If the Dharma has a built-in pluralism (Sapeksha Dharma) which means inclusive of all the dharmas. Sufis can have their dharma, Muslims can have their dharmas, as long as you also Respect others to have their dharma. I explained this in the first chapter of my book \'being different\' that We can have difference with \'Mutual respect\'.\nMutual respect means I respect you for being different but, I want you to respect me also. Its NOT a one way, that I respect you and you can disrespect me. No, we BOTH have to respect each other. This is a very deep principle in Dharma.\n\n&gt; So, rather than Secularism, which was a solution to a problem that Europeans had, which was NOT a problem we had. Because, we never persecuted scientists and beheaded them like they did with Galileo, Copernicus and these kind of people. We never said that if your scientific conclusion is different then you are disobedient and its a blasphemy. We never had any blasphemy law kind of things. So, free thinking was there always.\n\n&gt; So, rather than Secularism as a Solution to our situation, there is a idea of \'Pluralism\', built into the Dharma itself. Lot of Indians believe that Secularism is a Gold standard because they have been brainwashed. They don\'t even think what it is, where it came from, what does it do. They are just taught that way and they have learnt it from childhood and parroted saying ain\'t we Seculars, this and that.\n\n&gt; So, this is to understand that Secularism is a Western idea to be able to create a space with different religions can be tolerated and science can be tolerated, We have a different idea that is \'Sapeksha Dharma\' which also gives you pluralism in our own way.\n\n&gt; As far as would India be a Hindu society, I use the term Dharmic Society. India is a Dharmic society and I do not use the word Hindu, because Dharma also includes Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, it includes anyone which complies with the basic principles like Mutual respect.\nSo, the people who themselves want to be called as Hindus are fine, or something else are also fine. But, if you use Dharma, then Yes, Indian civilization is a Dharmic Civilization.'<br />Author: 'deficient_hominid'  id: 'eozq31'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eozq31/caa_secularism/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[Controversial Opinion] How CAA Protests taught me to hate Seculars &amp; Muslims'<br />Body: 'So, I never held too much of a strong views against either of the communities. I used agree with the progressive liberals on some points myself. However, it all started to change when the CAB was discussed in the parliament &amp; eventually became act that we now know as CAA. Here\'s the "chronology"\n\nI was seeing people being agitated against the act because they thought it favored Hindus, so I told them that it only favors persecuted minorities (including Christians, Sikhs &amp; Buddhists) from Muslim majority nations. They said I was a Hindutva bigot &amp; CAA should include Muslims from those nations as well, remember that these were the same guys who also said that why we should take so many migrants from these nations when in fact we aren\'t going to take any new people but just legalize those who have shown their status as refugee &amp; were here for more than 5 years. I saw Shah &amp; BJP doing a huge campaign to spread awareness regarding the CAA &amp; yet these people didn\'t even bother to look at all the facts provided &amp; continued with the protests. \n\nAnd then the protests themselves, they were by no means peaceful protests, they kept attacking people. They had nerve to say things like "but police started it first in Jamia" when the reality of the Jamia video is questionable at the best. This kind of whataboutism, overreaction continued. Then they got into the next phase, that of comparing Modi to Hitler &amp; India to Germany of 1930s. This protest wasn\'t limited to India anymore &amp; now received support from enemies of India like Pakistan, Turkey &amp; Western media which is focused on defaming India (remember movie Slumdog Millionaire) kept pushing this issue everywhere. A sidenote, Turkey has done numerous genocides &amp; Erdogan can put Hitler to shame with his bigotry. I didn\'t see a single protester disowning the support from these enemy states. I saw that they rather welcomed it. **They welcomed support from enemies of our nation.** \n\nThen the last stage started, the one of painting a propaganda picture. Attacking people under disguise and then blaming BJP &amp; ABVP for it. Delhi police has said that attackers belonged to the JNUSU &amp; yet these people didn\'t accept that fact. They kept making misleading comments &amp; misrepresenting the fact.\n\n#I used to be a bit skeptical about calling these people break India forces but whatever happened in last one month has truly opened my eyes to the reality.

Please read the text below to understand.'<br />Body: 'Liaquat–Nehru Pact\n\n- The pact was supposed to ensure that minorities living in both East and West Pakistan(Bangladesh) were allowed to return to dispose of their property, abducted women and looted property were to be returned, forced conversions were unrecognized, and minority rights were confirmed.\xa0\n\nNot only did Pakistan break this pact it went on an overdrive to ensure either people converted to Islam or they were harrassed until they either converted or left pakistan. Post partition minorities made up 22+% of Pakistan and by 2020 Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Parsis and Buddhist combined formed less than %3 of the population of Pakistan. Now compare this to India not only are the minorities aka Muslimd had their rights respected. Their population has also grown and were given special treatments. Infact to the point where the entire constitution was tampered with and securalism was added to it. Did Pakistan respect the minorities? NO!. Did Bangladesh upheld its minority rights? NO!. \n\n\nYou many say why Afghanistan?\n\nWell have you seen what they have done to Buddhist and Buddhist temples? Have you see what they did to Sikhs and Hindus living there?

      <li>Title::: 'Cultural Nationalism of India is in sync with Global Narrative'<br />Body: "The world has rejected the KGB-run United Nation Organization and the global communist awakening. The left has now been reduced to a mockery even in societies such as China and Russia which earlier were staunch communists. There is a new pattern emerging across the globe of nationalistic government with the people voting conservative governments to power in countaries likes India, USA, UK, Brazil, Israel and many more. This is a signal that the world has left behind the old pattern and is steadily moving towards a multilatralism and multipolarism with new players emerging and each having something fresh to offer on the table. But one thing is clear from the mandate of the people about what these countaries have to offer culturally and that reflects in the pattern of governments getting elected. We cannot emphasise the need of instituitions such as UNO and EU enough but slowly they are losing their importance and a new world order is emerging before it will rearrange the existing order in place. And that order is of, cultural nationalism. The world wants to go back to its culture, fortify it before it could move towards the direction of a world government. \n\nCultural nationalism comes to India naturally, before the transfer of power by Britain in 1947 for India to become a modern state, it has been one of the most ancient, infact the most ancient and culturally rich civiliazational state out there. India's history of for foreign occupation by Islamic invaders maybe have its own cultural implications in various fields such as architecture, cuisine, literature, clothes etc but its predecessor Hindutva culture outweighs the foreign occupation to the extent that it seems minuscule to the magnaminty of the thousands years old society. \n\nThere has been a recent shift in India's society by the election of a government with roots in the Hindutva movement. There have been some voices of dissent which are part of a healthy democracy but the worldwide pattern says something else and India's mindset is well in accordance with it. The global narrative is shifting towards nationalism before globalism. With UK leaving the EU for its own reasons, China undoing the wrongs of cultural revolution and US taking a stepback from world stage to look at its own affairs such as its Southern borders. India is on the same page but rather has always been a forerunner in the same due to the foundations set by its sages. There has almost been a uninamious voice of the world against the iconoclastic Islamic radicalisation which advotes an enforcement of Arabic culture across the foreign lands. It resembles world's rejection of the global communist awakening. Similarly, the world is rejecting the Ummah, including the Muslim world with new power faction coming up within itself. Ummah was always a facade with each Islamic country fighting with the other and pursing its own national identity. In this scenario, India is on a crossroad of an interesting phenomenon with its historic wrong of partition, article 370 amd unresolved boundary with its neighbours. \n\nComing to the modern Indian state, the government has taken a slew of steps such as Article 370 and Ram Mandir which ensure to safeguard India's cultural interests."<br />Author: 'OfficialDGISPR'  id: 'eojozb'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eojozb/cultural_nationalism_of_india_is_in_sync_with/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Hindutva by V.D. Savarkar - A Summary'<br />Body: "*What is Hindutva?* \n\nVeer Savarkar explores this topic in his book 'Hindutva' in a great detail and I will try to explain it briefly as I could. So, according to Hindutva, India is not something created in 1947 with an English speech by Nehru; but it is a milleniums year old ancient country. Savarkar discusses the etymology for the name of the country, starting with earliest mention of river Sindhu mentioned in one of world's most ancient scriptures Vedas to the degeneration of Sanskrit to Prakrit and citing foreign Zorastrain sources to being called Hindustan. The word India is also Greko-Romanisation of word Sindhu/Hindu. \n\nHe explores who are people of India? The mulanivasis, the dalits or the migrants, Aryans? He says all of them. He rejects the name Aryavrata, or Bharat named after a partiarch as the geopolitical landmass of India had already been inhabited by sapiens before the Aryan migrations and sticks to the dictum 'Hindu' for everyone as derived from the name of the river Indus. He goes on the explore the landscape of India and he concludes it as the landmass between the two Sindhus (Indus and Brahamputra due to their closeness of their origin and Indian penensula and its surrounding areas. \n\nNext, he discusses the various sects and castes indigenius to the development of India such as Sanatanis, Buddhists, Jains, Dalits etc until the reactivity of people to Mohemmedan invasions who become Sikhs. According to him, all are Hindus due to geo-cultural identity. Later, he discusses the nationality and arrives at 3 a mix of 3 cases: A: A person born in India. B. A person whose holy land is India (many foreigners who become hindus) C: A person whose fatherland is India. Now, let's look at the proposition C in detail. There are some religions such as Christianity and Islam and their father land is in Middle East. Savarkar rightly raises the question that they need to prove their loyalty and it has become even more important after the anti-national protests against CAA. We can give them a temporary benifit of doubt. Lastly, he also discusses the common language. So, Hindi as we all know is the common language of Indian subcontinent. We can speak in Hindu with a Nepali to a Southerner, no matter how much he can deny after his Periarian language politics. He concludes with describing Indians or Hindus as a racial and ethnic identity which no matter how much Pakistanis to South Indians have tried to oppose but cannot escape! \n\nI cannot stress this enough, Savarkar's views about the caste system that inter-caste marriages were the norm since the Vedic period and even know caste mixing is rampant but what more important is that we are all Hindus. \n\nPlease correct and forgive me if I'm wrong. Your suggestions, opinions and views are welcome.

It has been used my many countries over the years like US, China, Russia, Pakistan etc. Yuri Bezmenov an ex-KGB agent who worked in USSR ambessy infilterated to CIA desrcibes in detail in this [video](https://youtu.be/pgCnpCBORyM).\n\nBasically, it started with invitations sent out to intellectuals, actors, writers, members of civil society to USSR. A lot of them were leftists, so they had no trouble making them an agent. Rest of them were blackmailed. Many professors from DU, JNU etc when to USSR, later when they came back they indoctrinated left-leaning students, many of whom later became beaurocrats, diplomats etc. Lenin used to describe them as 'useful idiots', who were knowingly or unknowingly helping in their cause.\n\nYou can see its extent that a patriotic PM Lal Bahadur Shastri was poisoned in USSR and even Indira Gandhi was a victim of it in the movie *Tashkent Files*. And how the words 'Socialist and Secular' were added in the holy preable of Indian Constitution at mid-night during emergency to suit an agenda.\n\nUSSR collapsed, but its ghost of global communist uprising still remains. These remanents of ideological subversion were picked up the West, China and Pakistan, alongside waging a proxy war on India on many fronts such as Kashmir and Red Corridor. Here is a detailed [article](http://www.indiandefencereview.com/news/caa-pakistan-and-china-engineered-the-protests/) by Col. RSN Singh recently published. \n\nThere's a very interesting phenomenon used by the left. They kill the Jaichands before the Prithvirajas. The killings of Urban Naxal Gauri Lankesh and Rationalist Dabolkar were blamed on fringe Hindu outfits were in reality killed by Maoists over some mismanagement of funds. Whenever a useful idiot serves their purpose, their masters execute them. Another example of how even a martyr like Hemant Karkare was dragged into this dirty game by none other than Digvijay Singh who tried to malign two pillars of strength of India, i.e. Hindus and the Army by wrongly framing Sadhvi Pragya and Colonel Purohit over Malegaon blasts which were actually conducted by SIMI. RVS Mani, an insider, describes it in his book Bhagwa Atankwad or Hindu Terror. We have all know Digvijay's fondness for his master Osama and Hafiz Saheb. Even Sonia and Rahul are anti-nationals who work on the direct orders of the Church, since the day this woman came to India, it has lost 2 PMs, 2 ministers (Scindia and Pilot seniors) and members of Vadra family all died under mysterious circumstances. NAC under UPA was nothing but a hotbed of useful idiots. We also know how Junior Scindias and Pilots are given small roles in their parties to save one product of dynastic rule i.e. Pappu. Many of whom such as Medha Patkar, Arundhati Roy, who oppose development projects such as Narmada Dam projects are given benifits and people such as Binayak Sen who fuel Maoist insurgency in India's most resource rich areas. Not forget to mention pressitutes/pidis like S Varadrajan, Rajdeep Sardesai and whole of NDTV crew.\n\nNow the present situation of JNU. A attack by the leftist goons on their own student wing relects their agenda. Many useful idiots like Swara Bhaskar, Anurag Kashyap, now Deepika have come out to fuel their agenda. The former ambassador of Pakistan, Abdul Bashir had laid down the foundations of these protests during his tenure. The present protests in institutes like JNU, Jamia, AMU, Jadhavpur, Osmania etc are nothing but all funded by China, Pakistan and some US think tanks who have an ideological position. Consent is being manufactured (see documentary by Noam Chomsky) using a network of protests, media etc against the government policies such as CAA, 370, Triple Talak etc. That even the people who had earlier voted for BJP have started to question the policy of this government. They have only one agenda i.e. Breaking India, they have only one vested interest a weak India to be ruled and a profit to be made. \n\nIndia has finally woken up from its geopolitical slumber by electing a nationalist government twice and they cannot stand their invisible shadow empire getting crumbuled and have started out their anti-India activities in full swing.

      <li>Title::: 'The Gruesome Murder Which Eventually Led To The Ban on Student Elections &amp; Campus Politics In Maharashtra'<br />Body: 'It was October 5th, 1989, the last day to file nominations for student elections that would be held three months later in colleges across Mumbai. BJP MLA Parag Alavani, the then secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP- student body of RSS), claims he was sitting in the principal\'s office at the Jitendra Chauhan Law College in Mumbai, when news of an attack on campus reached them.\r\n\nOwen D\'Souza, District President of National Students Union of India (NSUI- student body of Congress), had been stabbed 64 times, his fingers chopped off by unidentified assailants while he was on his way to file his nomination. \r\n\nFew hours later, an FIR was filed against Parag Alavani for the murder of Owen D\'Souza. \r\n\r\nThe brutality of Owen\'s murder shook the city &amp; student bodies across India. But those who were aware of the nature of student politics in the 80\'s would tell you that it was an incident waiting to happen. Previously, kidnappings had taken place to prevent students from voting or standing in elections. Bullying, beatings, frequent boycott of classes, strikes, disruption of academics and similar violence had become commonplace during campus elections with political parties backing student leaders with finances &amp; other resources. A few months before Owen\'s killing, another NSUI district leader had been murdered due to connections with the Underworld. \r\n\nThe increasing menace of political parties using student bodies as pawns to further their own ideologies &amp; agendas was being felt across several campuses in India. The Punjab Government banned student elections in 1984 following the rise of militancy on campus after Operation Blue Star. Similarly, the Karnataka Government had banned campus politics in 1989 for perpetuating caste-based violence on campus. \r\n\nDuring Owen\'s murder trial, Alavani continued to maintain that he was not guilty &amp; was being framed by the police under the pressure of Congress, the then ruling party in Maharashtra. He was acquitted in 2002 due to lack of evidence. Alavani believes that Owen was killed by a rival gang as gang wars had pervaded student politics. Owen\'s sister is unsure of who her brother\'s killers could be. She states several within the party were jealous of Owen\'s rise &amp; closeness to Sunil Dutt &amp; Murli Deora.\r\n\nOwen\'s murder remains unsolved.\r\n\nNamrata Mukherjee, an ex student of NUJS, writes in her blog, ".. evidence has showcased that campus politics have ended up doing more harm than good. Not only are students subject to violence and coercion but the quality of education also tends to suffer on account of the frequent disruptions by such bodies, which often resort to mob tactics to get their demands heard." She further argues, "Politicization of student unions has the inevitable consequence of imposing a fixed ideology on highly impressionable minds with the affiliating political party exercising undue influence on its members. This prevents member students from developing an independent and comprehensive outlook, as they are obliged to pay loyalties to the stance of their respective parties."\r\n\n‘Discipline is the bedrock on which an educational institute is founded’\xa0and it is the duty of the State to preserve the same and ensure that vested interests do not negatively affect it. The quality of our future leaders can only be ensured if the integrity of the institutions who produce them is maintained.\r\n\nIn 2016, Maharashtra government enacted the Maharashtra Public Universities Act which reintroduced campus elections in the State. Ashish Shelar, state education minister, has stated that elections will have no political influence although it\'s a challenge to prevent the same at the ground level.\r\n\nCompiled from: https://www.mid-day.com/articles/mumbai-murder-student-movements-owen-d-souza-campus-politics-news/18042175\n\nhttps://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/student-elections-to-be-back-on-campus-but-without-political-intervention\n\nhttps://jilsblognujs.wordpress.com/2013/10/01/campus-politics-in-india/'<br />Author: 'Chutki30'  id: 'eo4ptf'<br />Score:94<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eo4ptf/the_gruesome_murder_which_eventually_led_to_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Anniversary: It was nine years ago since the last case of Polio was detected in India on Jan 13, 2011'<br />Body: 'It was a remarkable feat considering the odds against achieving this status. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) considered India to be the most difficult region of the world to eliminate wild polio virus transmission and then maintain that status. Significantly, India borders on Pakistan, which is still experiencing intense WPV circulation\n\nCentral and state governments led this extraordinary achievement, with the energy and dedication of millions of vaccinators, Rotarians and community mobilizers and the support of religious and local leaders. Movie star Amitabh Bachchan became the UNICEF Brand Ambassador for polio. \n\nIndia, a vastly diverse country with a 27 million birth cohort, undertook the largest vaccination drive against polio in the world. With high population density, poor civic infrastructure, poor sanitation, an almost nonexistent public health system, rampant malnutrition and diarrhea, difficult-to-reach locales, high population mobility, and extremely high force of polio transmission in few states,  the interruption of polio transmission was extremely difficult and demanding. \n\nOne of the challenges faced at the time was the reluctance of parts of the Muslim community to accept the vaccine. Social mobilisation efforts were intensified to gain support from religious leaders, Muslim institutions, mosques and madrasas.\n\nThe last polio case in India was reported in 2011 in a two-year-old girl, Rukhsar Khatun in Howrah, West Bengal. Notably, her two siblings received polio vaccinations. Rukhsar, however, was often sick with diarrhoea and despite encouragement from local health workers, her parents had thought it was safer for her to avoid the vaccine.In response to the lone case of polio in 2011 in Howrah, a large-scale mop-up immunisation activity was launched within seven days of notification of the case. This targeted action worked and India was finally removed from the list of polio endemic countries after completing a year without reporting any case of polio in January 2012. Three years later in March 2014 India was certified Polio-Free.\n\nhttp://www.virology.ws/2014/01/13/india-has-been-free-of-polio-for-three-years/\n\nhttps://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/138/4/e20160461\n\n[How India fought polio and won](http://archive.is/EcNkW)\n\n[History of Polio in India](https://www.healthissuesindia.com/history-of-polio-in-india/)'<br />Author: 'dhatura'  id: 'eo2m7h'<br />Score:79<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eo2m7h/anniversary_it_was_nine_years_ago_since_the_last/</li>

The East-West metro line has been under-construction for the last 10 years.'<br />Body: "Meanwhile Mumbai Metro Line 3, and entirely underground line finished almost 30 km of tunneling in 24 months. Kolkata metro is now smaller in length than Kochi metro. \n\nThe most ironical part is, back in the late 70s, the first metro line was built faster than what is being done now. Construction of the line started in 1978 and by the mid 80s, metros were running underground. Unlike today, the line was built by Cut-and-Cover, a painstaking process where you literally dig up the earth, build the line and then cover it. No tunnel boring machines and it cut through the heart of the city. \n\nNow, metro lines are lying abandoned all over the city. When Mamata has the Railway Minister, she tried everything she could to stop the East West Metro (it was Budhadeb's project) which was started back in 2004 and construction in 2009. Constant tussle between whether it will come under railways or not, then change in the alignment etc. Then when she became CM she announced 5 more lines, none of which has been completed as of yet because they were announced with no planning, funding future, permissions etc. \n\nRecently the long suffering EW project finally came to a grinding halt (literally) when one of the tunnels hit a water aquifer causing a subsidence and collapse of houses above. So the machine is also stuck, the matter is in courts now and Kolkata now has a couple of empty tunnels under the city."<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'enucwg'<br />Score:62<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/enucwg/kolkata_ready_to_protest_at_a_drop_of_a_hat_has/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Can anybody help me with following questions on CAA and NRC?'<br />Body: "Please provide answers with authentic sources. \n\nThe Citizenship Amendment Act of 2019\n\n1. Before the CAA, wasn't there any provision for granting citizenship of India to non-Muslim refugees?\n\n2. Earlier, if a Muslim refugee had asked for citizenship of India, was there any compulsion on the government to accept his/her demand? Couldn't the government refuse to make him a citizen?\n\n3. If the government already had full authority to grant or not give citizenship to a refugee, what further strength has the government got from this new amendment?\n\n4. Will Muslim refugees never ask for citizenship in India from now? If asked, can he/she get citizenship of India?\n\n5. To date, how many Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Christian, Parsi refugees have been given citizenship? How many Muslim refugees has India given citizenship in the last 70 years?\n\n6. If the government already had the right to grant or not to give citizenship in the past, and Muslims can still apply for citizenship under the old law, then what was the need of this new law, except that the minimum duration of stay in India as illegal migrant or refugee has been reduced from 11 years to five years? And why has that been done?\n\n7. Why has the Government put December 31, 2014 as the cut-off date? Is it because no infiltrator has come in after that date ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNational Register of Indian Citizens\n\n1. What will be the cost of preparing the NRC across the country?\n\n2. NRC in Assam alone took ₹ 1600 crores, 10 years of time and 52000 people were engaged in this work. Assam has a population of a little over three Crore. So, How much expenditure, how many people and how much time is needed for verifying the citizenship of 135 Crore people?\n\n3. How will the government deal with non-citizen Muslims? How much time and expense will it take up? Will they be deported? How many Bangladeshi migrants have been deported by the Modi Government so far?\n\n4. Will Aadhaar number, Passport, Voter ID, PAN card, birth certificate be valid to prove citizenship?\n\n5. If all these are proof of residency and not citizenship, then which documents would be required for proof?\n\n6. What will happen if the name or any other information in the NRC is written or mistyped by Babu sitting there? Will the citizenship stands cancelled until that mistake is rectified?\n\n7. How will the citizens or children who are born after 1987, and if their parents do not have proof of date of birth/place of birth, prove their citizenship? Because in law both mother and father must be certified citizens for their children's citizenship.\n\n8. How will citizens or children born after 2003 and if their parents do not have proof of date of birth / place of birth, prove their citizenship?\n\n9. If people who are unable to prove citizenship due to a clerk's mistake, will their cases go to appeal? Is there a time limit for deciding the appeal? Because their citizenship will stand cancelled during the appeal.\n\n10. In India the Aadhaar project is 11 years old, PAN card has been there for 25 years and the Indian Passport for the past 70 years. If there are still leakages and Aadhaar, PAN card and Passport holders can be ‘foreigners’, what is the guarantee that NRC exercise will not suffer from similar flaws?\n\n11. People who do not have such paper and are illegally hiding in India, will they show up in-front of NRC officials and say they do not have these papers?  The Government would still have to detect them, even after the NRC. So, why doesn't the government find them now?\n\n12. Will illegal migrants stop coming after NRC?"<br />Author: 'adhishthaan'  id: 'enkyde'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/enkyde/can_anybody_help_me_with_following_questions_on/</li>

They said they were a charity working to feed poor people. My dad gave them some money,  many people in our colony did. I was at school when they came. Afterwards when i came home I saw that receipt and I remember that the first thought that came to my mind was that this "Salvation army" was like a real army, fighting on the borders, and how wierd it is that there can be private armies... Sure there can\'t be private armies right? So i asked my mom about it and she said it was just some charity. I looked the word salvation up in the dictionary (no smartphones in those days and internet wasn\'t this ubiquitous either as most of you will remember), and since salvation means an act of saving, i accepted that it must have been a charity. That name stuck in my mind just because Salvation seemed to me a cool word and also because at first I had thought it was a private army which was even cooler. Fast forward to tonight, I just saw a post on Reddit that mentioned The Salvation Army. And it\'s a church. An American Protestant church. \n\nTldr- all these years i had been made to think The Salvation Army was a charity that helped feed the poor and the starving, when in fact it\'s a Protestant Church.'<br />Author: 'Hloddeen'  id: 'enbjx7'<br />Score:41<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/enbjx7/how_evangelists_take_monetary_donations_even_in/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'CAA+NRC protests: A political analysis'<br />Body: 'This is going to be a long post and given the complexity of this issue and nuances I would highly recommend that you read the whole post before commenting. Though if you don\'t have patience or the desire to understand feel free to skip it.\n\n#Introduction\n\nThe CAA+NRC protests has rocked the whole nation. The whole country is divided with everyone from students to retirees have an opinion and is a politically senstive topic invoking strong emotions on both sides. A lot has been said about the moral, legal and practical implication of the act itself but not much has been discussed about how we got here and how this became the focal point of the political storm that our country is facing. As much as the righteousness of the act is important it is also important to understand the context of how we got here in the first place to better understand the situation we are in. I think there is a need to declare that I am right leaning according to conventional standards of our country(though I consider myself a centerist). I have made an effort being as unbiased as possible but since a lot of ideas that is conveyed through this piece of writing arise through my own political inclination it\'s difficult to completely remove influences. I would argue that the integrity of this piece be judged by the strength of the arguments made rather than your political inclinations.\n\n#The election that changed India\n\n23^rd May 2019 may be the most important date in the last decade. The humoungous mandate that the BJP recieved in this election is a testament to the amount of confidence that has been placed in the BJP government. There was a mandate that shocked the nation. This marked a perception shift among the Right about the popularity of their ideology. You see the supporters of the government were fairly confident about the return of BJP but the sheer enormity  of the mandate recieved was something unexpected for even the supporters of the current government. The Lefton the other hand were completely demolarised. In the backdrop of rejection of values espoused by the Left on a world scale a defeat in their own country made individuals with firm belief in Left were dumbfounded.\n\nTo the run up to the elections the Left firmly believed in defeat of this \'fascist\' regime. This confidence in if not complete defeat of BJP then a hung parliament was affirmed by the political parties opposing the BJP. This was a wake up call for everyone from the normal Left leaning individual to the Left influencers to their leaders. This idea of the possibility of Modi\'s defeat was also something that prevealent in Right Wing circles who were observing the social media ideological war and sense of relief was established when the result was a massive mandate for BJP. After the elections there were numerous attempts to explain this collasal defeat of the Left.  There was near a consensus among the Left leaning crowd that BJP wouldn\'t be able to repeat a 2014. \n\nWhy was the left unable to predict this result and was convinced that Modi would be dislodged? The answer to this is three fold-\n\n* The left on the ground looked to anything that affirmed their belief than something that refuted it.\n* The social media engagements of anti-BJP content was significant though it had been driven by younger non-voting age users.\n* Their strategy was to make an Anti-BJP movement rather than a pro-Left movement.\n\nAfter this explaination everyone else moved on. They now knew what happened and that was the end of it. Especially the Right, who as usual mocked the Left for being far removed from the nation\'s perspective. As far as the Right was concerned BJP had won and nothing else mattered. In this arrogance of win everyone ignored was the massive advantage that the Left had gained, that is the massive support among the non-voting age citizens.\n\n#The run up to CAA+NRC\n\nNow we have a Left that essentially has an existential crisis and desperate for survival. Add to that the BJP didn\'t repeat the mistake of 2014 and didn\'t get complacent. They immediatly got on to their agenda of implementing their manifesto promises. The 370 abborogation and Ram Mandir verdict was a testament to their zeal to correct historic wrongs. The Left that had been watching this was even more scared. From their perspective these were signs of India being converted to a Hindu Rashtra. You see in addition to the reasons I have mentioned they geniunely believed that the BJP hype was driven primarly by Whatsapp propoganda and BJP IT cells dominance in social media. This was driven by their unwillingness to accept that there is geniuine acceptance of BJP\'s ideas among the voters. This unconscious rejection of validity of BJP mandate is something that drives the left. The prevalent thought is that BJP has fooled the voters into voting for them through propoganda. Though this perspective is highly biased and has no basis in reality. The congress and aap IT cells have also has unleashed a significant propoganda campaign trying to stir up the Anti-BJP sentiment. This simple fact is ignored by the left to convinience themselves their righteousness and purity of their own views and view their perspective as something unbiased.\n\nFor the 370 abborogation and Ram Mandir verdict though the Left were feeling anxious they weren\'t able to do anything due to the masterful political management of these issues by BJP. The Right and the BJP now exudes confidence to point of arrogance of the core Hindu issues by these historical success whereas the left is still looking for an opening to make a mark. Even the social media activists of the lefts agenda were getting agitated in their wait for something through which they can make a dent on this fascist regime. This is evident in their memes and videos that were being made at the time. The Godi Media as they called it was indoctrinating the whole country towards a Communal destiny. Something needed to be done no matter the cost. Oppositions inability to organize the resistance was something that infuriated them. Mind you most of the Left is opposed to Modi rather than supporting the current leaders of left. This anger slowly built up. Modi\'s India was a pressure cooker for this anger ever increasing over their inability to do anything to stop this. Then CAA+NRC unleashed all this supressed anger.\n\n#Arrogance of Right wing\n\nI called up my younger brother in college the other day. To give you a background my brother is the most compassionate and righeteous individual that I ever had a privelage to ever know. He is apolitical, deeply religious and changes his mind when faced with information that doesn\'t conform with his views. So imagine my surprise when he came out in support of agitations against CAA+NRC. With a hour long talk with him we deconstructed the CAA+NRC issue. He told me about his own apprehensions about it and the things that concerned him, I then addressed those issues and gave my own perspective of the issue changing his mind on CAA+NRC. When the conversation came to an end he made a single comment on my arguments that made me realise the gravity of the situation, "Why isn\'t anyone else making the points you made to me?"\n\nThis simple comment is strong crtique of the Right Wing ecosystem. From the perspective of a normal college attending student who is more on Instagram, youtube and google news than on actual places where these issues are deconstructed. Take the right wing mouthpiences like Youtube channels, news sites, Instagram accounts, twitter handles. Think of all the right wing content creators. Swarjya, sham sharma show, pushpendra kulshreshtha, opindia, Republic, FMF etc. They all are limited to ideological content. Swarjya started out as something good but they are now only focussing on ideological content cause that\'s where their clicks comes from. That\'s the reason you even click on the swarjya news clip. Don\'t you think they should do proper news too so they can attract readers who are neutral to their site. Republic does cover other news too but it\'s rehtoric so loud that it lowers everything else. I don\'t think I need to start on OpIndia. There are two exceptions though MemeMandir and WION. Both because they are not ideologically limited.\n\nIt was through sheer dumb luck that some people did get pushed to the right in CAA+NRC protests. The left attracts people through non political content and indoctrinates them through their political ones. The right ones are lacking that. Add to that the fact that many right wing supporters are unwilling to engage people on this issue due their own lack of ideological clarity dents the credibility of these people. It\'s a fact that I have observed in reddit too that RW is more inclined to name calling than to argue. They run from any arguments that calls them fascist and communal.\n\nThe more concerning is the left\'s dismissiveness of any view that opposes their own as something from Whatsapp university or Bh@kt logic or Godi media. This has dented the credibility of Right. This left is even treating their own parents as enemy beecaue they don\'t agree with their political position. The need of the hour is to create more mouthpieces that effectively addresses the concern of the people rather than indoctrination or BJP is bound to lose when the next generation comes of voting age. This younger generation doesn\'s The right needs to remember the very people that it caricatures as libt@rds are the people that they need to persuade to  abandon lefts ideology. They aren\'t aware as people of older generation does of what pseudo-secular nature insisting on a fundamentalist view of secularism.\n\nIf the right fails to do the left wins yet again and the gains in this 5 years are reduced to 0.'<br />Author: 'srthk'  id: 'en8d2f'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/en8d2f/caanrc_protests_a_political_analysis/</li>

But is it justified to jeopardize the lives of innocents in the name of absolute free speech when you have to be very cautious of what information you share and how it might affect the lives of others?\n\nLooking at how the politics in our country is polarized and the viewpoint of most of our politically active folks is in black and white, it really raises the question of whether the propaganda stir and the manipulation of people on the internet by people on both ends of the political spectrum is justified, if yes, then to what extent?\n\nThe most common justification given by the governments when they have to shutdown the internet temporarily is to maintain "Law &amp; Order", which is quite reasonable considering the fact that rumor and fear mongering has become quite common in our country nowadays. There are various examples to showcase in support of this notion, where, very recently in the JNU mess, everyone was hellbent on pushing their agenda without any evidence or thorough checkup as such, the infamous CAA-NRC fiasco, where the internet worked really well for *violent protesters* to organize, agitate and riot, in situations like these disabling the use of internet in those areas comes in handy to maintain peace and law and order. *I\'m not taking a political stand on this, and I hope you don\'t too, which gives us room to think rationally.*\n\nThere must be absolute freedom of speech in a vibrant democracy, no denying that, but under adverse circumstances it is the go-to option for the authorities as a first step to address the escalating tensions, and ever since the 2008 terror attacks, internet surveillance has been the top priority for security forces.\n\nInternet shutdowns can actually be harmful as people can\'t find out if their loved ones are safe. Even for the authorities to coordinate. Governments need to share more about why they order shutdowns to let the public make an informed choice about the issue.The Internet helps us realize our human rights, including freedom of expression and privacy. When governments shut off the Internet, people can\'t run their businesses or even visit their doctors during an emergency. More and more people need the Internet to connect and make a living, and cannot afford to lose access on a routine basis. The worst thing we can do is sit and do nothing.\n\nI urge our users to participate in the debate and keep it civil for good discussions and opposing viewpoint.\n\n**Those in favor of the notion can begin their defense/arguments with \\[For\\].**\n\n**Those who are against this notion can begin their criticism / arguments with \\[Against\\].**'<br />Author: 'OnlysliMs'  id: 'emq5en'<br />Score:47<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/emq5en/weekend_debate_temporary_internet_bans_justified/</li>

If any such profile is reading this, please answer.\n\n  \n\n\n1. Do you support speculations? The government has not produced any draft for nationwide NRC. We don't know if it will differ from the Assam NRC. How is protesting/rioting based on speculations right?\n\n  \n2. The government said that it's in no hurry to bring NRC but it will. Same was iterated by both PM and Shah. So, where is the 'PM lies' part exactly?\n\n  \n3. Are you telling me to 'Ignore History'? Ahmadiyyas and Shias wanted Pakistan. They led the movement to create a Muslim state claiming that Muslims can't live with non-Muslims. Are we going to push it under the carpet and pretend it never happened?\n\n  \n4. The riots are no longer on CAA. Multiple slogans are being raised. From Kashmir to JNU college fees issue to political opportunists and ISIS sympathizers raising the slogans of 'Freedom from Hindus', the whole movement has become a Hydra. Which faces do you support and how do you distinguish them from each other? Do you support PFI?\n\n  \n5. If you support protests based on speculations, will you support a movement against Muslims on basis of speculations that they will soon become majority and turn India in a Sharia state?\n\n  \n6. If government should bow down to any and every movement, will you ask government to bow down to a movement against the secular fabric of country? Is this the template to follow?\n\n  \n7. A case against this law can be and has been filed in SC. The constitution does not provide the public with the right to interpret it's provisions. SC is the designated institution. By contesting it, are you not going against the sacred constitution of India?\n\n  \n8. Everyday we read about new war fronts, propaganda being used to make the country unstable. How do you ensure that you are not a part of this machinery?\n\n  \n9. Yes the government is and has always acted like the biggest goon. It provides, but it also demands obedience. Democracy allows us to decide it's fate periodically. If you disagree with this system, what is your alternative? Let's be pragmatic about it.\n\n  \n\n\nTo non-left, What do you think?

      <li>Title::: 'The forgotten struggle of Kashmiri Hindus, exodus, genocide which world hardly heard of. Mosques broadcasted divisive, inflammatory messages, asking for purge of Kashmir Pandit. As of Oct 2015, only 1 Kashmiri Pandit family returned acc to J&amp;K govt, Only 2,000–3,000 Hindus remain as of 2016.'<br />Body: "The Hindus of the Kashmir Valley, were forced to flee the Kashmir valley as a result of being targeted by JKLF and Islamist insurgents during late 1989 and early 1990 Of the approximately 300,000 to 600,000 Hindus living in the Kashmir Valley in 1990 only 2,000–3,000 remain there in 2016.\n\nThe Kashmiri Pandits had been a favoured section of the population of the valley during Dogra rule (1846–1947). 20 per cent of them left the valley as a consequence of the 1950 land reforms, and by 1981 the Pandit population amounted to 5 per cent of the total.\n\n#  Islamization of Kashmir - Mohammed Abdullah Sheikh's Role\n\n Islamization of Kashmir began during 1980's when Abdullah Government changed the names of about 2500 villages from their native names to new Islamic names. The Sheikh also started delivering communal speeches in mosques similar to his speeches in 1930's. Additionally, he referred to the Kashmiri Pandits as “mukhbir” or informers of the Indian government.\n\n ISI's initial attempts to create unrest in Kashmir against the Indian government were unsuccessful until it started growing in late-1980s. The Afghan jihad against the Soviets, the Islamic Revolution in Iran and the armed struggle of the Sikhs in Punjab against the Indian state became sources of inspiration for large numbers of Kashmiri Muslim youth.\n\nIn 1986, Shah decided to construct a mosque within the premises of an ancient Hindu temple inside the New Civil Secretariat area in Jammu to be made available to the Muslim employees for 'Namaz'. People of Jammu took to streets to protest against this decision, which led to a Hindu-Muslim clash. In February 1986, Gul Shah on his return to Kashmir valley retaliated and incited the Kashmiri Muslims by saying Islam khatrey mein hey (trans. Islam is in danger). As a result, Kashmiri Pandits were targeted by the Kashmiri Muslims. Many incidents were reported in various areas where Kashmiri Hindus were killed and their properties and temples damaged or destroyed. The worst hit areas were mainly in South Kashmir and Sopore. In Vanpoh, Lukbhavan, Anantnag, Salar and Fatehpur, Muslim mobs plundered or destroyed the properties and temples of Hindus.\n\nDuring the middle of the night of 18 and 19 January, a blackout took place in the Kashmir Valley where electricity was cut except in mosques which broadcast divisive and inflammatory messages, asking for a purge of Kashmiri pundits.\n\n# Militancy in 1990s\n\nThey began to leave in much greater numbers in the 1990s during the eruption of militancy, following persecution and threats by radical Islamists and militants. The events of 19 January 1990 were particularly vicious. \n\n***On that day, mosques issued declarations that the Kashmiri Pandits were Kafirs and that the males had to leave Kashmir, convert to Islam or be killed. Those who chose to the first of these were told to leave their women behind.*** \n\n***The Kashmiri Muslims were instructed to identify Pandit homes so they could be systematically targeted for conversion or killing.***\n\n \n\nOn Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi, on October  14, 1989  a massive crowd gathered near  the Budshah chowk in the heart of  Srinagar, and from there, it marched  towards Eidgah to the graveyard  that had been renamed the ‘martyr’s  graveyard’. The onlookers cheered  and showered *shireen* on the   marchers as if to welcome a marriage procession. The crowd was shouting  slogans that had shocked most of the Kashmiri Hindus and a few Muslim  Nationalists,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*Yahan kya chalega, Nizam-e-Mustafa*  \n*La sharqiya la garbiya, Islamia Islamia*  \n*Zalzala aaya hai kufr ke maidaan mein,*  \n*Lo mujahid aa gaye maidaan mein*\n\n***English Translation:***\n\n&gt;What will work here? The rule of Mustafa  \nNo eastern, no western, only Islamic, only Islamic  \nAn earthquake has occurred in the realm of the infidels,  \nThe mujahids have come out to fight\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccording to a number of authors, approximately 100,000 of the total Kashmiri Pandit population of 140,000 left the valley during the 1990s. Other authors have suggested a higher figure for the exodus, ranging from the entire population of over 150,000, to 190,000 of a total Pandit population of 200,000, to a number as high as 800,000. The nature of the planned exodus has remain controversial, with the involvement of then Governor Jagmohan in organizing a clandestine exodus been a subject of controversy. Many of the refugee Kashmiri Pandits have been living in abject conditions in refugee camps of Jammu. The government has reported on the terrorist threats to Pandits still living in the Kashmir region.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion** :\n\nSome Hindus across India tried to help the Pandits. Bal Thackeray from Maharashtra got seats reserved in engineering colleges for the children of these Pandits. He was one of the first persons to help them after which Punjab also followed suit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*As of October 2015, only 1 Kashmiri Pandit family returned to the Kashmir valley since 1990 according to the Jammu &amp; Kashmir government despite the financial assistance being given for rehabilitation*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Did the India govt do something on similar scale ?**\n\nIn 2009 Oregon Legislative Assembly passed a resolution to recognise 14 September 2007, as Martyrs Day to acknowledge ethnic cleansing and campaigns of terror inflicted on non-Muslim minorities of Jammu and Kashmir by terrorists seeking to establish an Islamic state.\n\nEven though article 370 has been abolished , I have a little hopes, the land which belonged to many Kashmiri Hindus and esp Pandits would see the glory days and would be restored back to those times. I nevertheless appreciate the efforts taken by the Govt of India in taking the first step towards this direction.\n\nI would also request them to showcase atleast now what the Hindus of Kashmiri had to go through, declared a day which mourns this!\n\n \n\n***Source:***\n\n[***https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiri\\_Pandit***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiri_Pandit)\n\n[***https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiri\\_Pandit#cite\\_note-exodus-28***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiri_Pandit#cite_note-exodus-28)\n\n[***https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exodus\\_of\\_Kashmiri\\_Hindus***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exodus_of_Kashmiri_Hindus)\n\n[***https://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/more/news/from-sheikhs-land-to-tiller-to-azads-raj-tilak/***](https://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/more/news/from-sheikhs-land-to-tiller-to-azads-raj-tilak/)\n\n[***https://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1953\\_5/37/the\\_kashmir\\_land\\_reforms.pdf***](https://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1953_5/37/the_kashmir_land_reforms.pdf)\n\n[***https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9ftx2b/14\\_sept\\_1989\\_the\\_day\\_tika\\_lal\\_taploo\\_was\\_shot/***](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9ftx2b/14_sept_1989_the_day_tika_lal_taploo_was_shot/)\n\n[***https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cra0e1/the\\_story\\_of\\_kashmiri\\_pandits\\_and\\_the\\_ethnic/***](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cra0e1/the_story_of_kashmiri_pandits_and_the_ethnic/)"<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'ema7tj'<br />Score:253<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ema7tj/the_forgotten_struggle_of_kashmiri_hindus_exodus/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Issue with flatmate'<br />Body: "TLDR; Flatmate committed for 6-months stay period whom I moved into new house with. Has to go abroad, is leaving without arranging new guy and wants to take his stuff from home.\n\nI moved into a 1BHK flat along with a guy in November. I knew the other guy as an acquaintance for around an year and he said that he is committing to stay in house for 6 months. I stay in the house full-time and the other guy comes 1x / 2x in a week since he already has a house in the city otherwise.\n\nThis month beginning he told me he's going abroad on 16th of this month ( January ). Of course, if he has to go he will go abroad so I can't change that but the concern was what about sharing the house expenses now. So he shared one contact with me for a guy ( his acquaintance ) to share the house with. I talked to him and he didn't seem much interested to talk in general. Turns out he just had a chat with him and on next call he tells me he doesn't know about the house thing but to just put a word with him when I meet him. That didn't go further.\n\nNow, he calls me yesterday and says that he wants to take his belongings and asks me when I am free. I tell him that first he should clear the money balance. But again he calls me today saying what can he do if he has to go abroad and if I can allow him to take his belongings ( good thing he doesn't have a separate key yet - we have used one common key for now ). I have argued and put up my stance that the money balance has to be cleared before he can take away his stuff.\n\nMy concerns is how much money should he pay? He has paid 1/3 of house deposit which should be sufficient for 2.5 months of rent - so I am inc that in his assets in this house since he will be going away totally. And as per our initial discussion 4 months are remaining ( inc this one ) before his committment is over. For the past two months he has shared rent, drinking water, electricity and internet charges. From what I understand he should at-least pay 1.5 months of rent since his committment was 6 months. What about electricity, internet etc? Also I wouldn't be put up with any other random guy in house since as per our discussion and as it was going on he used to come to house occassionaly to take rest since he travels a lot and otherwise has a house ( with his mother - though not a native ) in the city and the other person should also have similar needs.\n\nHe has been arguing that what can he do if he has to go somewhere to which I have said that he should first clear his responsibility - either pay remaining rent and leave or find another guy with similar flat requirements. On last call ( today evening ) he said he will pay me for a month and half rent from next month ( don't know what sense does it make ) or so from now until I arrange a flatmate but at the end added if he can take his stuff for now - on which I said that would be unfair and money should be settled first and cut call. Have this discussion over call recorded on a video also.\n\nAlso let me know if there can be any legal implications over this? He is financially good and seems to be coming from decent background, also not native to the state or city and is 32-35 years of age. Haven't yet felt some criminal consequences yet though don't want to get comfortable.\n\nWhat's your take on this?"<br />Author: 'purezen'  id: 'em976n'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/em976n/issue_with_flatmate/</li>

This is not correct.\n\nWhile Sanskrit words cannot be easily translated, the closest English word for **Hindutva is Hindu-ness**. *NOT* Hinduism. Hindu-ness or Hindutva refers to the essence, the core of Hindu Dharma. It emphasizes that which is common among all the Hindus across the world, belonging to various different sampradayas, paramparas, Vedic and non-Vedic, etc. Hindutva refers to the essential common factors among this diverse set of 1 billion-plus people. The term Hinduism refers to the entire collective Hindu Dharma with all its diversity and variety. It is more of an umbrella term.\n\nTo give an analogy, vyakti or person refers to a whole person or being. Whereas, vyaktitva or personality refers to the essential character or personality of the being.\n\nNow, why is Hindutva hated? It is very simple - Hinduism as a collective mostly minds its own business, adjusts and exists. Hindutva as the common qualities of Hindus, seeks to unite the community on the basis of their common core. The common core of Hindus is a dynamic, undefeatable Shakti. When Hindus are united by this Shakti, they do great things like say... establish the wisest, wealthiest, most stylish, most artistic, strongest civilization in the world. The other cannot accept this.

This prompted me to do more research on the topic and after watching several youtube videos, searching for articles on the web and reading a couple of freely available books, I decided to give it a try.\n\nSo, I started drinking my own urine twice a day -- once the first urine of the morning and once after lunch. None of my family or friends know about it and I intend to keep it that way for some time because of taboo nature of the topic and general repulsion around it. So far after about 5 weeks into the practice, I only had good results to show. Indeed it was difficult to consume it in the beginning but I fought it out and it got easier after 2-3 days. I am usually a healthy person but still noticed after 2 weeks that my body felt lighter and I had more energy. I also noticed that my skin has cleared up on my face. forehead looks less dark. Less dandruff in hair and generally healthier and shiny hair.\n\nAfter extensive reading up on it, I find that there are several myths surrounding the practice. People think that urine is a waste product of body just like poop. This is not true. Urine is produced by the kidneys as a process of filtering excess nutrients from the blood in order to keep nutrient contents balanced in the blood. In fact the body reabsorbs a whole lot of urine before it ends up to the bladder. \n\nIt is 95% water and the rest 5% has over 2000 compounds in it including hormones, enzymes, minerals, antibodies and proteins.\n\nReading the literature, I find that it has helped people get rid of acne, psoriasis, eczema, ear issues, even helps with healing wounds and burns. Please Google it to find more. There is a urine research institute in Kolhapur as well.\n\nI feel like I (re)discovered a unique medicine that helps me stay healthy and fit. This is why I wanted to share it with you folks. I hope it helps others who are tired of medicines which have their own side effects and costs. This is free.

      <li>Title::: 'Am i going crazy or there are trolls in this group ?'<br />Body: 'Like i am just seeing a lot of random posts and comments which say things which are a little bizarre. I mean they are extreme or ridiculous and they are exactly the same kind of things which are used as "evidence" that right wing is extreme or stupid or something like that. \n\nSome posts/comments are a little out there in other ways. (For e.g. in one comment someone linked an article comparing muslim temple destruction with 2 Hindu kings fighting over an idol of a god as evidence that temple destruction was common in India and hence when muslims did "it was NBD". I mean you would forgive this as confusion, but the article was in scroll.com, written by a Muslim man (which is not in itself a problem) but the article qouted two white men and only two white men who had written a gross and to any hindu a very evident even intentional mis-interpretation of what the kings were doing vs what muslims did) \nAnd this commentator wanted clarification and refutation of the points made in the article. \nHe was baiting people into saying something (like my description here) which could easily be used out of context to say i am a Hindu fascist. \n\nSoooo am i going crazy or does this sub have a lot of trolls ? \n\n\nP.s. - some things that i know that you might not. I used to work with someone who worked in the online division of a news agency. Her job was to be am online troll. So everytime there was a story about kashmir or indian army for e.g. she would go the Tweet of that story and post some anti-india extremist bs in the comments, while pretending to be a Pakistani. There would be a colleague of hers who would post extremist hindu bs as a regular indian or something. The idea was to rile people and comments up to make the story travel more and more. This was her job. She was paid to do that and she can legit claim she worked as a journalist. So i might be a little paranoid/enlightened about this.

Before giving in to sensational headlines and consuming them like an ostrich with its head buried in sand, every Indian should ask these questions:\n\n1. Are JNU/Jamia/AMU the only three universities in India? Why does the media always focus on these three?\n2. Those handful of protesting students doesn't even represent 1% of total student population of India (which is about 3 million). Then why is media behaving as if there is a huge support for these protests?\n3. Is it the first time that there was violence where student unions are involved? Take out the history of JNU and you'll find it bloodied with a violent history. Then why is media creating so much sensation around this one?\n4.

      <li>Title::: 'How India is at risk of becoming an Islamic nation'<br />Body: 'When the Muslim population remains under 2% in a country, they will be seen primarily as a peace-loving minority and not as a threat to other citizens. This is the current situation in:\n\nUnited States — Muslim 0.6%\n\nAustralia — Muslim 1.5%\n\nCanada — Muslim 1.9%\n\nChina — Muslim 1.8%\n\nItaly — Muslim 1.5%\n\nNorway — Muslim 1.8%\n\nAs the Muslim population reaches 2% to 5%, they begin to recruit from ethnic minorities and disaffected groups, within prisons and street gangs. This is happening in:\n\nDenmark — Muslim 2%\n\nGermany — Muslim 3.7%\n\nUnited Kingdom — Muslim 2.7%\n\nSpain — Muslim 4%\n\nThailand — Muslim 4.6%\n\n“From 5% on, they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population,” Dr. Hammond notes. “For example, they will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic standards) food” and increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature such food on their shelves — along with threats for failure to comply. This is happening in:\n\nFrance — Muslim 8%\n\nPhilippines — 5%\n\nSweden — Muslim 5%\n\nSwitzerland — Muslim 4.3%\n\nThe Netherlands — Muslim 5.5%\n\nTrinidad &amp; Tobago — Muslim 5.8%\n\nSoon they begin to apply pressure to allow Sharia law within their own communities (sometimes ghettos).\n\n“When Muslims approach 10% of the population, they tend to increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions,” Dr. Hammond notes. “In Paris, we are already seeing car-burnings. Any non-Muslim action offends Islam, and results in uprisings and threats, such as in Amsterdam, with opposition to Mohammed cartoons and films about Islam.” These tensions are seen on a regular basis in:\n\nGuyana — Muslim 10%\n\nIndia — Muslim 13.4%\n\nIsrael — Muslim 16%\n\nKenya — Muslim 10%\n\nRussia — Muslim 15%\n\nThe violence increases when the Muslim population reaches 20%. “After reaching 20%, nations can expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations, sporadic killings, and the burnings of Christian churches and Jewish synagogues,” such as in:\n\nEthiopia — Muslim 32.8%\n\nAt 40%, nations experience widespread massacres, chronic terror\xa0attacks, and ongoing militia warfare,” such as in:\n\nBosnia — Muslim 40%\n\nChad — Muslim 53.1%\n\nLebanon — Muslim 59.7%\n\nFrom 60%, persecution of non-believing “infidels” rises significantly, including sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia law as a weapon,\xa0and Jizya, a tax placed on infidels, such as in:\n\nAlbania — Muslim 70%\n\nMalaysia — Muslim 60.4%\n\nQatar — Muslim 77.5%\n\nSudan — Muslim 70%\n\nAfter 80%, expect daily intimidation and violent jihad, some State-run ethnic cleansing, and even some genocide, as these nations drive out “infidels,” and move toward a 100% Muslim society, which has been experienced to some degree in:\n\nBangladesh — Muslim 83%\n\nEgypt — Muslim 90%\n\nGaza — Muslim 98.7%\n\nIndonesia — Muslim 86.1%\n\nIran — Muslim 98%\n\nIraq — Muslim 97%\n\nJordan — Muslim 92%\n\nMorocco — Muslim 98.7%\n\nPakistan — Muslim 97%\n\nPalestine — Muslim 99%\n\nSyria — Muslim 90%\n\nTajikistan — Muslim 90%\n\nTurkey — Muslim 99.8%\n\nUnited Arab Emirates — Muslim 96%\n\nA 100% Muslim society will theoretically usher in their version of peace — the peace of ‘Dar-es-Salaam’ — the Islamic House of Peace. “Here there’s supposed to be peace, because everybody is a Muslim, the Madrassas are the only schools, and the Koran is the only word,” such as in:\n\nAfghanistan — Muslim 100%\n\nSaudi Arabia — Muslim 100%\n\nSomalia — Muslim 100%\n\nYemen — Muslim 100%'<br />Author: 'sidorsidd'  id: 'eloxdm'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eloxdm/how_india_is_at_risk_of_becoming_an_islamic_nation/</li>

So, It is up to you to believe this, as should be your default approach to any information without conclusive evidence as proof. Having said that I will explain a little bit in detail and there won\'t be a tl;dr\n\nSo, $12million worth of crypto-currency. It\'s not new that ISPR does this, they have often pent much more before, but, whats different this time around is the method of attack. Instead of their usual routine of going to media houses and their choice of "academics" (read lobbyists, completely normal, even india has those) who can influence policy. But this particular fund is different because they are hiring regular joes, junkies etc., this time around. Unlike before, ISPR will have more control over the content and they use these regular people who don\'t care about the issues but only a paycheck. They are using these assets and then deploying them in public speaking platforms (psps, their term). This might be anything, a speech at an even, a city hall meeting, local public forum, hoa meetings , anything. The plan is not to spread some kind of grass roots propaganda, but to use the documentation/recordings of those proceedings on the internet platforms to spread propaganda, basically ack to ISPR\'s usual signature.

      <li>Title::: 'Why the India education system is so much better than the western education system.'<br />Body: "I am a firm hater of the American education system, and a firm believer in how India does things. The only reason they are better than us is that we are broke, societal reasons, bad quality of teachers and parents. Not actually the basic system itself.  \n  \n#Notebooks  \n  \nHere in the land of shoot shoot pew pew, schools don't believe in notebooks. They write material down, and move way too fast through the course to allow effective notebook note-taking to take place. Problem? Just by reading stuff on a paper, we don't retain memory. But in India all the question answers have to be written down on a notebook, mandatory, multiple times. Writing stuff down helps retain memory. Here I can't remember jack shit after one class, but in India I easily could retain it until the unit test, then study for it. Here I can't.  \n  \n#Chances to learn from failures  \n  \nOur parents beat us if we do badly on a Unit Test. But does that one 20% affect our grade overall? NO. In USA, every single thing, every single assignment, and unit test counts towards your grade. If you fuck up once, thats some percentage of your grade chipped off that you wont ever get back. In India there are 80 points final and 20 points internal (atleast where I've been to). The unit tests do barely anything for you in the end. But in US, they make up atleast 50%, so failing at a Unit test isn't an option. In India, most students don't realize this or utilise it effectively, but every mistake made on a UT is a chance to learn (and get slapped by mom)  \n  \n#Wierd syllabus  \n  \nIn India, we have uncountable study materials that focus specifically on the NCERT syllabus, which many schools follow. In US there isn't a set syllabus that most schools follow, so students have very little material like sample tests to study from. (yes Khan Academy, but they don't do nearly enough sample questions to make sure students get all kinds of applications to the concept. In India we can just google NCERT class 10 sample board paper/past papers to get our stuff.)"<br />Author: 'i-like-dicknpussy'  id: 'elmd3g'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/elmd3g/why_the_india_education_system_is_so_much_better/</li>

You\'d find the same people who are going to protest with you, day in and day out. You can cry about fascism etc in one place.\n\nThe mere fact that you are allowed to protest for the past 6 months while you are a student means you aren\'t living in a communist country. \n\nThe mere fact that you are allowed to protest without being caught by the gestapo and leaving no traces of you ever existing means you aren\'t living in a fascist country. \n\nThe mere fact that you are allowed to have an opinion, allowed to voice it means you still live in a democracy. \n\nThe mere fact that you are allowed to vote means you aren\'t living in a country which lives by the principles of Karl Marx, Joseph Stalin or Mao Zedong. \n\nAs a democracy it\'s your choice to protest. And if you turn that into violence, the same democracy also allows you to be arrested. The same violence also allows you to be identified by a facial recognition software. The moment you walk into a protest, you have to allow the law to function as well. That\'s how democracy functions. \n\nAm I justifying violence by the Police? Nope. I feel that violence by the security forces where there was no need for it should unequivocally condemned and such policemen should be tried with the same severity a violent protestor is tried. \n\nTwo wrongs don\'t make a right. Just like some of you say, "I hate the BJP doesn\'t mean I like the Congress". I can condemn violent protests, I can laugh at pointless protests but I don\'t have the right to question your right to protest. \n\nBut if in a protest all you are going to say is - unconstitutional, fascism etc. Bro if it was real fascism, you\'d be worried about getting out of your toilet, forget going for an actual protest. \n\nA democracy functions on the whims of an electorate. And the electorate voted for a party which had a very clear manifesto which they are fulfilling. By calling those decisions undemocratic, the only person being undemocratic is YOU. \n\nProtest as much as you want. That\'s your right. Make the government think over the decision they have taken and maybe even roll it back, that\'s your right as well. But that doesn\'t mean the country agrees with you.

      <li>Title::: "The untold story of Veer Savarkar. This is what they don't tell you"<br />Body: "26th February is the death anniversary of Veer Savarkar, one of the bravest revolutionary freedom fighters of India. Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was born on 28 May 1883 in Maharashtra. Savarkar, since his childhood was attracted towards freedom movement and while he was studying in school, he developed the habit of participating in freedom fights. Fearlessness, bravery was the hallmark of this young boy who had a determination to get India out from the hands of the British.\n\nIt was the time when British used the tactics of divide and rule. They propped up Hindus against Muslims and spread communal hatred in places where the freedom movement gained momentum. When Savarkar was only 12 years old, he witnessed communal clash for first time in his village. A gang of Muslims attacked his village, burning down houses and forcing people to convert to Islam. Veer Savarkar at a young age had resisted this Muslim domination in his town and although his boys were outnumbered, he inspired his friends to join him and chase away the Muslim mob which had attacked his village. The boys fought until last man in the mob was sent out of the village.\n\nThis incident disturbed Veer Savarkar very much. He understood that different community members were pitched against each other by the British in order break India and they had succeeded in their ploy to divide India on religion and caste. He realised that Indians were losing national identity and there was a need for a nationalist movement to galvanize the people of India. At just 15 years, he started a youth organisation called Mitra Mela (Band of Friends) to advocate nationalist ideas. Same time he lost his parents and his elder brother, Ganesh, took the responsibility of the family.\n\nIn 1902, he joined the Fergusson college in Pune for BA, where he started giving speeches on nationalism, patriotism and revolutionary movements. He was inspired by Lokamanya Balgangadarnath Tilak’s call to boycott all foreign clothes and organized a bonfire during Dusshera festival to burn all foreign clothes. At a small age of 18 years, he started writing poems, books on nationalism and Hinduism. He was fondly called VEER by his friends for his unbending attitude.\n\nAfter he completed his degree, nationalist activist Shyamji Krishna Varma helped Vinayak to go to England to study law, on a scholarship. It was then, Tilak started an organisation called Garam Dal, literally “Army of the angry” as a result of a split between the Indian National Congress and Tilak. Tilak was upset with Congress's ideology to hold talks with British and convince them to leave India. He felt that many leaders in the Congress were happy under the British rule and were developing the radical mindset which was against the core ethics of the nation. Tilak was immediately jailed for opposing the INC and British.\n\nSavarkar in England started Free India Society to motivate students in freedom struggle and declared to fight for independence through revolutionary ideas. He said  “We must stop complaining about this British officer or that officer, this law or that law. There would be no end to that. Our movement must not be limited to being against any particular law, but it must be for acquiring the authority to make laws itself. In other words, we want absolute independence.”\n\nSavarkar who was an avid reader, read many books on war techniques and applied them in freedom movement. He believed that the right strategy was the keen to tackle British and wrote a book emphasizing guerrilla warfare called 'The History of the War of Indian Independence'. It was via this book that Savarkar became one of the first writers to allude the uprising as India’s “First War for Independence”. The book gained so much popularity in a short span, that the British banned the book throughout India.\n\nIn India, Ganesh Savarkar organised an armed revolt against the Morley-Minto reforms of 1909 after which he was arrested and sent to cellular jail in Andaman islands. The British also named Savarkar in the case for plotting the crime and was issued a look out notice for Savarkar. Finally, in 1910 he was arrested in Paris and shipped to India. Savarkar escaped from the ship and swam for over 2 Km in sea to reach the shore hoping that his friend would be there to help him. But the late arrival of his friend helped the British recapture him and he was taken to jail.\n\nArriving in Bombay, Savarkar was taken to the Yervada Central Jail in Pune. Following a trial, Savarkar, aged 28, was convicted and sentenced to 50-years imprisonment and transported on 4 July 1911 to the infamous Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nFrom here started Savarkar’s life of Hell!\n\nSavarkar in cellular Jail was treated with utmost disrespect, humiliated and insulted by British jailer. Savarkar was given a corner cell where he had no access to any outer world. He was made to work for 18 hours a day, given minimum food and minimum clothes. He was made to work for hours without break in oil mill under regimental strictness, he wasn’t allowed to talk to anyone including his brother who was in the same jail. He was tortured on a daily basis by the British officers beating him, abusing him and poking him with hot iron sticks. But Savarkar never broke down even once. He was made to see the hanging of his fellow inmates and freedom fighters to make him mentally weak. He was made to witness the torture of his friends where their head was smacked with iron rods and sticks.\n\nIt was then Savarakar decided to write his views and ideas of nationalism and Hinduism. He was denied access to pen and paper after which he plucked his own nails, collected thorns and pebbles to write on the walls of the cell. He spent 13 years in cellular jail writing endless scripts on nationalism. His famous description of who is Hindu, who is a nationalist was written on the walls of the cells.\n\nHe described a Hindu as — a patriotic inhabitant of Bharatavarsha, venturing beyond a religious identity. He described Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism and Buddhism as one and the same. He outlined his vision of a “Hindu Rashtra” (Hindu Nation) as “Akhand Bharat” (United India), purportedly stretching across the entire Indian subcontinent. He defined Hindus as being neither Aryan nor Dravidian but as “People who live as children of a common motherland, adoring a common holyland.”\n\nFinally in 1923, due to extreme pressure from Tilak and other prominent leaders, Savarkar was released under strict conditions of not participating in politics for 5 years and barring to leave Ratnagiri district. Savarkar who was barred from participating in politics, focused on abolishing untouchability in the district. He fought for caste unity and achieved 100% success in a span of just 2 years. Dr B.R. Ambedkar who was the editor of the ‘Janta’, a monthly, was impressed by Savarkar’s work so much that he compared his work to Lord Buddha.\n\nHe continued his work on nationalism and opposed the Gandhian principles of Ahimsa saying that Indians were not cowards and we cannot beg foreigners for Independence. He strongly pitched for a uniform civil code and strongly opposed the division of India based on religion.\n\nBased on Dr B.R. Ambedkar’s writing — Mr. Savarkar insists that, although there are two nations in India, India shall not be divided into two parts, one for Muslims and the other for the Hindus; that the two nations shall dwell in one country and shall live under the mantle of one single constitution. In the struggle for political power between the two nations, the rule of the game which Mr. Savarkar prescribes is to be one man one vote, be the man Hindu or Muslim. In his scheme, a Muslim is to have no advantage which a Hindu does not have. Minority is to be no justification for privilege and majority is to be no ground for penalty. The state will guarantee the Muslims any defined measure of political power in the form of Muslim religion and Muslim culture. But the State will not guarantee secured seats in the Legislature or in the Administration and, if such guarantee is insisted upon by the Muslims, such guaranteed quota is not to exceed their proportion to the general population.\n\nHe wrote more than 8 books in his lifetime and over 10,000 pages in Marathi language. His literary works in Marathi include “Kamala“, “Mazi Janmathep” (My Life Sentence), and most famously 1857 – The First War of Independence, in which Savarkar popularised the term “First War of Independence.” Kale Pani (Black Water which means “life sentence” on the island prison on the Andaman islands), which reflected the treatment of Indian Independence activists by the British. He wrote an inspirational historical work, Saha Soneri Pane (Six Golden Pages), recounting some of the “Golden periods” of Indian history.  He wrote the atrocities of British and Muslims on Hindu residents in Kerala in the book, Mopalyanche Band (Muslims’ Strike) and also Gandhi Gondhal (Gandhi’s Confusion), a political critique of Gandhi’s politics.\n\nHis poems include, Sagara pran talmalala (O Great Sea, My Heart Aches for the Motherland), and Jayostute (written in praise of freedom).\n\nHe spent his life fighting for the country but was accused by Congress of inciting violence and hatred. But B.R. Ambedkar believed that Savarkar's way of life and his fight to unite all castes and religions was something which was recognized by very few. Savarak became the victim of political games of Congress which found him as an easy target. But even today, his ideas about nationalism, love for country and the struggle he faced can never be denied and he became a role model to many revolutionists in the country.\n\nJai Hind.

CAA only states about giving citizenship ( not treating as illegal migrants ) to religious minorities that have lived in India before 1st Jan 2015.\n\nThe criticism against these leaders is not something i am against (or the criticism against this post if you find this annoying) , but to hate for sake of hating and being disrespectful, disingenuous and quite frankly just stupid is something that is idiotic. You are not winning any Modi ji supporter by calling PM names, and you need those Modi supporter on your side if you want to win an election."<br />Author: 'Fluid-Lock'  id: 'ekcs5g'<br />Score:35<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ekcs5g/why_liberals_are_so_anti_nationalist_regardless/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The real reason for Love Jihad.'<br />Body: "There has been a fair amount of posts on this sub regarding Love Jihad as a way to convert hindus into muslims. While we all know that this is happenning at some level, I think most people are unaware/wrong on why exactly this happens. \n\nLet me elaborate on the  shocking and real reason why love jihad happens - and its not because of dumb non muslim women who fall for scheming muslim men - but largely because of the dumb dharmic society who themselves complain about love jihad.\n\nSome people are of the view that Muslim boys 'target' non-muslim women to convert them into islam. This happens a fair bit but a large part of why this happens is because a lot of muslim women are wrapped up in a burkha whereas non-muslim women are more liberal. There is an islamic theology angle to it but the main reason is still that single men would be seen to 'target' 'available' women. That their religion provides support to this impulse is helpful but not the root cause. \n\nThe second reason people thing why this happens is because they thing women are dumb and fall for the approaching muslim men without thinking of the consequences. This is also partially true because a lot of women who should know better still do this thing - case in point are the khans in bollywood who are married to hindus and those women dont seem the kind who can be lured by fake promises. This line of thought is partially true but the REAL reason why these women are attracted to muslim men is what I will elaborate next.\n\nThe REAL reason why love jihad happens in India is BECAUSE of how the non-muslim society behaves with the representation of muslims in media. This has nothing to do with muslim men targeting non-muslim women or dumb women falling for muslims but entirely because of the behaviour of non-muslim people when the next 'khan' starring movie comes up in bollywood. \n\nWhen you take your daughters to watch a movie which has muslim protagonists, you are sub-consciously grooming them to see muslims as objects of romantic attraction. This sub-conscious grooming is the single most important reason why love jihad happens in india and the person to blame is not your daughter or the muslim guy she falls for but you yourself who allowed their mental state to be groomed around seeing muslim men as objects of romantic attraction.\n\nShahrukh khan might himself be a secular person (even though he has been on video and openly lied about quran being secular) but just because DDLJ was such a big cinematic hit he is the single biggest reason why love jihad happens in India at the scale that it does. The biggest culprit is bollywood, but not the only one. Indian cricket team also popularises muslim cricketers as heros and that also grabs mind share of young girls the wrong way. \n\nIt doesnt matter what specific role a muslim plays, even nawazuddin sidiquis negative portrayal would result in this sub-conscious grooming. When an independent women makes a decision to date a muslim, she is simply allowing that decades of 'grooming' to dictate those choices.  And the biggest influence of this decision is not the muslim guy but her parents and society who have normalised this depiction of muslim men in bollywood. \n\nThis is exactly similar to how an independent muslim women makes a choice to wear a burkha as a symbol of her freedom. The decision has been 'groomed' into her since birth and what she considers to be a choice is mostly a sub-conscious brain washing.\n\nIncidently, this is the exact same reason why indian men are seen as extremely undesirable in the dating market in the west. This is because the predominant display of indian men in american media is around 'Apu' from simpsons or 'Raj' from big bang theory - both extremely poor depictions of men anyone would want to date.\n\nThe next time you want to watch a bollywood movie or a netflix series which has any muslim cast, think about if you still want to stay in a secular country or would you rather have india become pakistan."<br />Author: 'oth0cean'  id: 'ekb9fj'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ekb9fj/the_real_reason_for_love_jihad/</li>

For example, in the solar sector, *China’s Ministry of Finance subsidized 50 to 60 percent of production costs of select solar companies*, and 50 to 70 percent of installation costs for solar generation and distribution systems. Local governments, which account for the largest share of financial aid, provide additional support to local champions. *At least 21 cities and five provinces have pledged a combined $6 billion in subsidies for robotics. These subsidies account for an estimated 10 percent of total operation revenue for Chinese robotics firms Siasun and Estun.* Local governments are also subsidizing between 15 and 30 percent of the purchase price of robotics to encourage greater usage. Designated national  champions also received advantageous capital terms from state-owned banks and investment funds (e.g., *wind turbine manufacturer Goldwind received a $5.5 billion loan from the state-owned China Development Bank*).\n\n**Government R&amp;D Funding :**  The Chinese government provides significant R&amp;D funding to strategic sectors. From 2005 to 2015, total government R&amp;D spending grew more than 350 percent to reach $44.5 billion. *China’s R&amp;D expenditures are rapidly catching up to the United States, with China’s total R&amp;D spending (public and private) increasing from 26.5 percent of total U.S. R&amp;D expenditures in 2005 to 75.1 percent in 2015*.\n\n**Government Procurement :**  The Chinese government leverages its large central and local government procurement markets to benefit domestic firms in strategic sectors. For example, *in 2012, the central government mandated its agencies to purchase only Chinese automobile brands, leading several municipal and provincial governments to follow suit*.\n\n**Technology Standards :**  The Chinese government has repeatedly *created China-specific standards to raise the costs of market entry for foreign firms*. For example, the People’s Bank of China announced *a new technical encryption standard for bank cards—incompatible with existing international standards and only used by the state-owned China UnionPay*—effectively cutting foreign electronic payment firms such as Visa and MasterCard out of the market and forcing them to spend additional money to redesign their cards to meet the standard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ncontinued in the comments....'<br />Author: 'LichchaviPrincess'  id: 'ek5635'<br />Score:71<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ek5635/chinas_technonationalism_toolbox_a_primer/</li>

Magnanimously, thereafter, Pakistan returned all the conquered territories to India.”\n\nThe Punjab Textbook Board published the following text on the causes for the separation of East Pakistan in 1993 for secondary classes — “There were a large number of Hindus in East Pakistan. They had never truly accepted Pakistan. A large number of them were teachers in schools and colleges.\n\nThey continued creating a negative impression among students. No importance was attached to explaining the ideology of Pakistan to the younger generation.\n\nThe Hindus sent a substantial part of their earnings to Bharat, thus adversely affecting the economy of the province. Some political leaders encouraged provincialism for selfish gains. They went around depicting the central Government and (the then) West Pakistan as enemy and exploiter. Political aims were thus achieved at the cost of national unity.”\n\n\n“While the Muslims provided all sorts of help to those non-Muslims desiring to leave Pakistan [during partition], people of India committed atrocities against Muslims trying to migrate to Pakistan. They would attack the buses, trucks and trains carrying the Muslim refugees and murder and loot them.” The latter excerpt was taken from an intermediate classes textbook — Civics of Pakistan, 2000.\n\nSome more examples of totally contorted and misleading, yet ingenious and amusing, narrations of the history of Pakistan can be extracted from a single text, A Textbook of Pakistan Studies by M. D. Zafar.\n\n\n“Pakistan came to be established for the first time when the Arabs led by Muhammad bin Qasim occupied Sindh and Multan. Pakistan under the Arabs comprised the Lower Indus Valley.”\n\n“During the 11th century the Ghaznavid Empire comprised what is now Pakistan and Afghanistan. During the 12th century the Ghaznavids lost Afghanistan and their rule came to be confined to Pakistan”.\n\n\n“By the 13th century Pakistan had spread to include the whole of Northern India and Bengal. Under the Khiljis Pakistan moved further South to include a greater part of Central India and the Deccan”.\n\n“During the 16th century, ‘Hindustan’ disappeared and was completely absorbed in ‘Pakistan”.\n\n“Shah Waliullah appealed to Ahmad Shah Durrani of Afghanistan and ‘Pakistan’ to come to the rescue of the Muslims of Mughal India, and save them from the tyrannies of the Marhattas…”\n\n“In the Pakistan territories where a Sikh state had come to be established, the Muslims were denied freedom of religion.”\n\n“Thus by the middle of the 19th century both Pakistan and Hindustan ceased to exist; instead British India came into being. Although Pakistan was created in August 1947, yet except for its name, the present-day Pakistan has existed, as a more or less single entity for centuries.”'<br />Author: 'DanaDanDoga'  id: 'ejudr3'<br />Score:36<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ejudr3/lies_and_fake_facts_peddled_to_students_in/</li>

      <li>Title::: "2nd Battle of Panipat - Raja Hemu's brilliance undone by one stray arrow"<br />Body: 'The Second Battle of Panipat is one of the more fascinating battles from a military tactics pov. It was fought between one of India’s best military minds (top 5 all time) Hemu Chandra and another very capable general, Bairam Khan. It was a constant battle of absorbing the enemies’ stratagem and devising new stratagem to counter it.\n\n\nThe battle that could have potentially changed the future of India no Mughals, very strong Hindu leader in Delhi as the emperor was lost thanks to a chance misfortune of war. One stray arrow changed the course of the battle and all Indian history to come.\n\n\n**Background**\n\n\nNorth India (in this context, all of North India, Gujarat, Rajsthan, Bangladesh and Pakistan) was in turmoil, the Mughals under the weak Humayun had been thrown out by a Pashtun warlord named Sher Shah Suri. While Sher Shah was a dynamic ruler (and one of the more progressive secular rulers) his successors were a weak quibbling lot. After his death the dynasty collapsed in a fratricidal war. Without going into a lot of details (this is scope for an entire write up by itself), Jalal “Islam Shah” Suri who was the second in line of succession was chosen over his elder brother (and the heir presumptive) Mohd Adil Khan. Civil war ensued which Islam Shah won, but he in turn died very early into his regime. This left a power vacuum with a 12 year old Emperor holding power nominally but in reality the power was held by a coterie of his nobles. Into this vacuum stepped in Mohd Adil Shah (the nephew of Sher Shah himself), poisoned the child emperor and took over the reins of power. His rule was in turn challenged by his brother in law and the governor of Bengal who rose in rebellion. Mohd Adil Shah at this time appointed Hemu Chandra as his Army commander, Hemu destroyed all opposition and chased out Ibrahim to a non-descript town in Orissa. The Son of the Bengal governor then took up the mantle of the rebellion and in a battle killed Mohd Adil Shah.\n\n\nThe power vacuum was now a literal blackhole, into this stepped one of India’s greatest generals, Hemu Vikramaditya Chandra. According to Fazl’s Akbarnama, Hemu was undefeated in 20 battles, enemies would flee upon sighting his banner. The only battle he lost was one that he had almost won, but a chance arrow struck his eye and he fell unconscious and was captured. The only battle he lost was the battle in which he died. To paraphrase Fazl in his Akbarnama, “Hemu was so mighty that he achieved deeds which no other mortal could even think of”.\n\n\n**Hemu**\n\n\nHis origins are very cloudy. The only thing that is clear is he belonged to a poor Brahmin family from Rajasthan. Akbarnama says that his father was involved in the Saltpetre (used in gunpowder) trade while other later sources say his father was a poor Brahmin priest. Again it gets murky after this, one source says that he offered his services to a local Modi (a person who supplied soldier to various armies – a Mercenary if you will). Somehow he came into contact with Islam Shah (the short lived emperor of the Suri dynasty) and impressed him with his abilities so much that Islam Shah made Hemu the head of his logistics ministry, he was then made the head of Islam Shahs Markets and Produce ministry (Sher Shah centralized all trade, and introduced standard measures) and quickly rose to become chief of his espionage services. In this time period he also convinced the Sultan to shift his capital to Gwalior as he felt Delhi was not defensible.\n\n\nIn the civil war that followed Islam Shahs death, Hemu chose the winning horse and offered his services to Adil Shah who on the threat of the Bengal Governor (Ibrahim Shah) made him chief of his army. Hemu won many quick victories against superior forces and established himself as the king maker upon whose authority Adil Shah was allowed to continue his reign. Upon Adil Shah’s death, Hemu crowned himself Emperor. Just when he was settling down, trouble brewed on his Western Frontiers. While he was busy putting down the rebellion in Bengal the Mughal forces, Humayun with the help of the Shah of Persia had reconquered Delhi and vast parts of North Western India, Humayun then promptly died- some say he was assassinated by Bairam Khan (ancient Indian conspiracy theory?), but the generally accepted theory is that he fell to his death after tripping on his robe.\n\n\nNow we have another 13 year old King – Jalal-ud-din Muhammad, also known as Akbar Shanshah in power, but this time around he had a very strong and loyal regent by the name of Bairam Khan. Bairam Khan quickly mobilized the nobles and marched on a Suri remnant in Gujarat by the name Sikandar Shah Suri leaving a general named Tardi Beg in charge of Delhi (and his empire while Akbar was away on campaign).\n\n**Hemu’s tactic &amp; Innovations**\n\n\nHemu was a very visionary leader, he saw the value of a robust supply chain which allowed his army great mobility and ensured that the local populace was spared from robbery and depredation. He used a chain of supply depots (Forts held by garrisons) to feed his army. This ensured he could bring to the war a very strong army. According to Akbarnama, Delhi had a massive famine during this period, yet Hemu could comfortably feed his army which was very Elephant heavy using his supply base in Bengal. He like Napoleon later relied extensively on mobility and attacking the enemy when they least expected it in a place they least expected it. He also again very similar to Napoleon, relied on artillery. A keen student of past battles &amp; wars, he quickly must have realized that Babur won his victories only because of two factors, • Horse Archers • Superior Artillery Using Portugese traders and arms dealers he equipped his army with the latest European Artillery which outmatched the Persian artillery of the Mughal army. Horse archers he could not source as they came from the steppes and the Mughals dominated the trade in steppe mercenaries. He however to counter these came up with an innovation – Musket &amp; Bow armed war elephants. Using their superior height and armour, they could act as a spectacular armored tank.\n\n\n**Tactical Innovation**\n\n\nHe innovated a new tactic which helped counter the increased mobility (via horse archers) of the Mughal armies – in a tactic eerily similar (though the tactically the opposite) to one used by Hannibal the Great in the Battle of Cannae, he had a very flexible flank which allowed him to separate the strong enemy centre from their flank protection. He would push in his strong Elephant army into the centre at just the right time to break the strong but isolated enemy centre.\n\n\n**Hemu Tactics 101**\n\n\nAs explained in my previous great battles write up, the armies of that time lined up facing one other. The Centre was the strongest, and the battle was usually decided in the flanks. The objective of the army was to break the flanks and attack the army from 2 directions (frontally and from the side), to pressure the centre, surround it and attack it from 4 directions. In the battle of Cannae for instance, Hannibal kept bending his weak centre using a feigned retreat (of sorts), forcing the Roman centre to get lured into the Crescent and at the right time his strong flanks surrounded the Romans and destroyed them.\n\n\nHemu (very uniquely in the annals of military history) used a feigned and controlled retreat…on the FLANKS! He weakened his wings, and on the enemy assaulting it, he would slowly pull them back. This would mean that the enemy flanks would start overextending depriving the centre of its protection. At the right time, he himself would lead his Elephant army in a charge on the enemy centre shattering it completely. This was an unprecedented tactic as it needed close cooperation between units and a resounding faith in their commander.\n\n\nWhat was more intestesting is that it played into the Mughal classic tactic of Tauqama which was invented by Babur. Tauqama was the classic stratagem of enveloping the enemy flanks and destroying it from the sides.\n\n\n**Battle of Delhi – Hemu 1, Akbar 0**\n\n\nWith Bairam &amp; Akbar away in the East, Hemu as was his signature style chose to strike first. Moving fast, he attacked Delhi which was under the command of Tardi Beg. Using the tactics I described above, Hemu lured Tardi beg into over extending his flanks, and launched an unstoppable attack on Beg’s centre using some 5,000 Horses &amp; 500 war Elephants. His centre disintegrated, Beg fled the field and Hemu quickly occupied Delhi and crowned himself Emperor of India.\n\n\nOn hearing this news, the Mughal nobles wanted to flee to Kabul, Bairam however had a couple of them beheaded for cowardice, had Tardi Beg the Governor of Delhi tortured and then beheaded for his incompetence, rallied the army with an inspiring speech and marched on Delhi. After his coronation, Hemu moved towards Bairam and the stage was set for the grand denouncement. While Bairam used fear to drive his soldiers, Hemu showered largesse, granted promotions and land grants to his troops and motivated them with promise of greater rewards.\n\n\n**First Mistake- Akbar finds his opening**\n\n\nHemu made the first flaw in his career and this was almost fatal. As I had explained earlier, he liked to move very fast and his all cavalry + elephant army could indeed move very fast. To aid this, he had sent his artillery much ahead of his full army, he assigned only a small body of troops to guard this vital arm.\n\n\nThe Mughals, who used a long range recon patrol called the Harawal-I-Mankula (like the Brits created in WW2 – the LRDP) under Lal Khan who were ranging well ahead of the Mughal army looking to pick off the vanguard of Hemu’s army spotted the Artillery column. They pounced on this weak force and destroyed it taking large number of guns as a prize. A major blow, but given the balance of forces Hemu still held the upper hand and he decided to give battle outside Panipat.\n\n**Out Hemu-Hemu, Bairam Khan’s tactical innovations**\n\n\nBairam Khan, no mean leader himself had studied Hemu’s campaigns and planned his deployments in a unique way. Aside from the Vanguard (already seen under Lal Khan) a strong corps was placed between the centre and the Vanguard (so they had two centres). The flanks were strengthened by cavalry archers to maintain mobility (and rush back to aid the centre if needed) and a ditch was dug between the Centre and the advance centre unit to prevent Hemu’s Elephant Corps from striking the centre.\n\n**The Battle**\n\n\nThe battle was on, Bairam Khan took to the offensive (though vastly outnumbered), his flanks tried the Tauqama tactic of using the flanks to rush Hemu’s centre, but his Elephants stood firm. He ordered his flanks to start their withdrawal, and into this gap the Mughal flanks followed, he had despite Bairam Khan’s counter planning managed to create a gap between the Mughal centre and it’s flanks. Into this gap, he pushed in his massively strong offensive corps…the ditch barely stopped them.\n\nReaching the Centre, the Elephant corps and the following Cavalry started to rout the Mughal centre, and the battle was won, India was his…after 350 years India would be united under a Hindu king…when at this point in time a stray arrow (could have even been a friendly fire incident) flew out of nowhere and struck him in his right eye. Hemu lost consciousness, and without his banner to rally under, Hemu’s forces meekly surrendered. Bairam Khan and Akbar had won only thanks to luck and not skill.\n\n**The Aftermath**\n\n\nBairam Khan went on a beheading spree under his Emperors name. He was said to have beheaded all Hindu soldiers (some 15,000) in Hemu’s army, beheaded all Afghan nobles and their families in Hemu’s court and is said to have created minarets of heads. Even Hemu’s father was tracked down, told to convert to Islam and when he refused…beheaded. Akbar took over from Bairam and spent 10 years conquering all of Hemu’s previously held lands all the way till Bengal. Mughal rule was solidified and would be deposed only by the Marathas some 3 centuries later.\n\n\n\nSources-\n\nHemu the Napoleon of India by Bhardwaj\n\nAkbarnama &amp; Babur Nama for the actual battle and other Mughal tactics.\n\nJohn Keays A History of India for the Suri dynasty part, A History of India by Romilla Thapar also covers these periods and engagements.'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'ejpho2'<br />Score:98<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ejpho2/2nd_battle_of_panipat_raja_hemus_brilliance/</li>

Imagine the opportunity to eradicate all genetic disease with a few simple alterations.  Envision a society in which prospective parents can flip through a catalog and shop for traits to “design” their children.  This imagined world may soon become possible through the rapid development of genetic engineering.\n\nOn the eve of the new decade, a Chinese researcher named He Jiankui was sentenced to prison for three years [^(theguardian)](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/30/gene-editing-chinese-scientist-he-jiankui-jailed-three-years) for genetic manipulation of babies. The case which is believed to be first case worldwide of creating designer babies, has set off a fierce debate among scientists and the general public.\n\n*So, what was the transgression?* In contrast to the usual artificial insemination, which doctors worldwide perform on couples who have an unfulfilled desire to have children, He Jiankui had carried out a process called **germ-line interference** using gene editing tool called *CRISPR-Cas9*. He manipulated the genetic material even before the sperm and egg were joined, with the aim of creating new, altered genetic material.\n\nHe also claimed the modifications would make the children immune to HIV by turning a gene called **CCR5** into a mutant form that prevents the virus from invading cells. This kind of work is banned in the US and other countries due to the ethical concerns and risk the work poses to other genes, where it can create unintended side-effects that could be passed on to future generations. The scientific community back then was outraged of the work, and He was subsequently fired from his university position at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen. [^(weibo)](https://www.weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309404310626552916754)\n\nEthicists in medicine and the life sciences reject germ-line intervention in humans almost without exception. They fear that such an approach could tempt doctors to play God and *create human life a la carte*: Parents might be able to select certain characteristics of their offspring, which can then be built into the genome before fertilization. *Anyone remember playing Fallout 3?* According to a study [^(dw)](https://www.dw.com/en/crispr-cas9-babies-likely-to-die-earlier-berkeley-study-says/a-49025884) by doctors at the University of Berkeley, the life expectancy is probably significantly lower than that of children conceived normally.\n\nEven if the science could be perfected, is it morally wrong? Would it lead to eugenics and a stratified society where only the rich enjoy the benefits of genetic enhancement? Or would the real injustice be depriving our children of every scientifically possible opportunity?\n\n**Those in favor of the motion can begin their defense/arguments with \\[For\\].**\n\n**Those who are against this motion can begin their criticism / arguments with \\[Against\\].**'<br />Author: 'nipples_brown_area'  id: 'ejhrre'<br />Score:47<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ejhrre/debate_genetically_engineered_humans_an_ethical/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[Career help] [18M] Can anyone help me figure a way out of this mess?'<br />Body: 'I’m probably going to talk to a career counselor also. \n\nBackground: \n\nI wouldn’t call myself a bad student. In fact I got 10cgpa in class 10, and got good grades in the first few months of 11th but grades dropped in 12th because I couldn’t follow the pace at which my teachers covered the syllabus, and often ended up studying the previous chapters when a topic was being taught, sometimes even studying 11 th and 10th topics in class 12. \n\nI originally meant to take my CBSE 12th boards last year. But due to many difficulties I could only take the practicals. I found out that there is a thing called CBSE improvement exams that you can take to, well improve your marks. I also found out that if you take improvement exams, your practical marks will be carried over next year. Since I couldn’t complete the syllabus to the extent that I was failing my pre-boards, I skipped the theory exam entirely hoping to take the improvement exam next year, as a private candidate. I decided to wait until the improvement exam registration started. So, I continued self-studying throughout the year as much as I could. I had to relocate a few times because of family problems. While I was waiting for the registration date and was away from home, my father decided to sign me up as a regular candidate to my previous school for some unfounded reason. \n\nPresent: \n\nA teacher told my brother in school (KV) yesterday that I’d need to reappear my practicals. He told me because I was signed up as a regular candidate, all my previous marks got deleted, I’ll have to do everything anew. I’m finding it hard enough completing the theory syllabus of my subjects, now I’ll have to do practicals too. I’m never trusting my father with my academic decisions again.\n\nMy goal is and always has been to become independent of my parents asap, they’ve always been abusive to me, especially my father. I have a better relationship with my mother though.  \n\nNeed advice on these topics: \n\nWhat can I do if I fail? I’m still way behind in my physics, chemistry, and math syllabus, and with the headache of practicals there is a chance I’ll fail. Can I take compartment exams for three subjects? \n\nWhat are some B.Tech or BSc schools that I can get into with relatively low marks, and then work my way up from there? I’m not sure I can stay at home for one more year and retain my sanity. Maybe join a random cheap college while I prepare for compartment or improvement exams possibly? Any suggestions welcome. Thanks for reading.\n\nOne more thing: It could also be that I’m not able to complete the syllabus in time because I’m not gifted in science and math or because I’m not particularly interested in the subject. I seem to be naturally interested in history, humanities and the social sciences. I tend to read long articles and listen to long youtube videos of these topics. However, I’ve heard that the job market is not very good if I study this, so I’ve neglected this interest after class 10. Also I’ve committed three years already to science and math, and have gone into a bit of depth in the topics by reading books outside the CBSE prescription. Would it be a good idea if I pursue this instead if I fail this year?'<br />Author: 'Cheeky9'  id: 'ej0ua5'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ej0ua5/career_help_18m_can_anyone_help_me_figure_a_way/</li>

I don\'t say car because your car is decided by your salary, but in motorcycle where people have a choice and aren\'t too constricted by money, you can accurately predict their nature by looking at their motorcycle. Here\'s my observations:\n\n1. RE Classic/Bullet 350:  Douchebag. Usually spends some extra money on an aftermarket exhaust from Karol Bagh that earns him the ire of mohalla wallahs around him. Thinks his "patakhas" are impressing people.\n\n2. Bajaj Pulsar/TVS Apache: Poor douchebag. Usually a chapri.\n\n3. RE Thunderbird 350: Hippie kind of guy who thinks the Tibetan flag strung across his handlebars make him cool.\n\n4. Yamaha R15 or KTM Duke 200: College guy with daddy\'s money who thinks he\'s better than those "lowly Pulsar wala chapris"\n\n5. Honda CBR250R: People with either their daddy\'s money or their own, who think that an R15 makes them look like chutiyas. Usually not total chutiyas but still agressive if you rub them the wrong way.\n\nThese are the popular bikes, atleast in the northern India. Now lets talk about bikes that aren\'t as commonly seen.\n\n1. RE Classic/Bullet 500: Usually an older, mature enthusiast who doesn\'t buy an RE purely for the street cred or the "dug-dug-dug". They actually are old time RE fans and like the brand for its legacy.\n\n2. Honda Unicorn: Hands down the nicest people on the road. Since a Unicorn doesn\'t have the swagger or the sharpness of a Pulsar or an FZ, it is usually bought by middle aged people looking for a reliable commuter that can do decent speeds on a highway. I have never, ever seen a Unicorn owner drive rashly.\n\n3. Yamaha Fazer: Chill guy who just wants to ride to Leh and shoot  video with his GoPro.\n\n4. Duke 390: Has a death wish. Thinks he could win Dakar if they let him compete. Ride fast but is also (Usually) a responsible rider. *NOT* a chapri.\n\nWhat do you guys think?'<br />Author: 'nogs897'  id: 'eizor0'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eizor0/motorcycles_and_personality_types/</li>

Not only did they oppose the bill at  every stage, but that when it became law they started a campaign of  Civil Disobedience against that Act. Fortunately the Civil Disobedience  campaign of the Muslims against the Act did not swell and was submerged  in the Congress Civil Disobedience campaign which synchronized with it.

Israel could've mass-expelled the Arabs in their territory many times in the last century and avoided the problem of perpetual conflict. But that's precisely what those in the right of Israel's political spectrum don't want. \n\nA stable Israeli state will give no reason to continue the Zionist cause. A highly liberal govt will come to power and be very open to Arab migration and resettlement and in 100 years, there won't be a Jewish state. To make sure that doesn't happen, it is necessary to have a constant conflict between Israel and the greater Islamic world. It'll ensure Jewish unity and a separate identity. \n\nIf the theory is right, then it has parallels to what's happening in India today. In order to achieve an almost impossible Hindu unity amongst the various castes, languages and classes, perhaps the best way is to have a perpetual tension with Pakistan, greater Islamic world or maybe even the entire non-Hindu world in the future. **You may hate the race and religion you're born into but ultimately, when you see outsiders smearing your people and call for their utter destruction, you will change your mind.**"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'eijjtg'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eijjtg/is_bjp_trying_to_achieve_a_longterm/</li>

It has been hinted by both orthodox and heterodox economic thinkers like Banerjee, Sanyal and Taleb that India lacks risk taking, and improvement in that area can simplify a lot of things for us.\n\n* Respect high skill vocational jobs. As a practitioner of AI, I can say that plumbing is still going to be in high demand, so will be electricians job. These specialized vocational jobs, are often seen negatively as we reach middle class, but these guys are often the saviors.\n\n* Respect Indian culture and products. We are less likely to argue over price of an overpriced marvel toy, but argue over price of a Ganesha idol. This is some real display of apathy, inferiority and lack of love for our own culture. Pick Indian companies, give them reviews, ask them to improve. \n\n* Give respect to local infrastructure, an infrastructure well preserved significantly decreases the cost of repair, renovation and risk of diseases. Use social media to put pressure on local bodies. The real political work starts with local bodies, rest is mostly a distraction. \n\n* Discourage corruption by social ostracisation. A lot of us are idealists when young, but soon in the garb of pragmatism with start compromising with our ideals and morals and let corruption have a free reign. Try to avoid corruption personally.\n\n* Engage in family values and traditions. Our tribalism, family structure is deeply wired in us, no amount of sophistry can deny that.

      <li>Title::: 'India has no choice but to be hostile with its Muslim neighbors'<br />Body: "The reason why I think so is purely because of demography. \n\nImagine 2 countries, country A &amp; country B. In both countries, 2 kinds of people live, each group has a closer affiliation to each country, so I'll call them people A and people B. Now country A has 95% people A (and 5% people B) while country B only has 75% people B (and 25% people A). **This changes the geopolitical landscape completely!!**\n\nLike all countries, the politicians of both countries will try to wield influence over the other. If countries A &amp; B have a friendly relationship, it is very advantageous to country A. They can try to influence people A of country B and because of demography, they can get a result that is 5 times bigger compared to whatever country B politicians try to do. \n\nNow if both countries have a strained relationship, there is no demographic leverage for country A over country B. Not only that, it can become advantage country B if its politicians can *make* *use* of the 25% people A in their country in order to sway the actions of Country A politicians. Country A is less capable of doing this because people B in their country are only 5%. \n\nIn a nutshell, country A has more carrots while country B has more sticks, hence their actions are different."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'eife5m'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eife5m/india_has_no_choice_but_to_be_hostile_with_its/</li>
      <li>Title::: '"BJP IT Cell" vs "Reddit IT Cell"'<br />Body: 'So OP in the other "universe" most likely this guy :  [https://www.producthunt.com/@onosmosis](https://www.producthunt.com/@onosmosis)  , has done twitter account analysis to figure out how many bot account does BJP "IT" cell have. In the process racked up a big bill (well may not for him). \n\nThere are a couple of  amusing things about our "batman" boi,\n\na ) He fails to hide his identity through his own post history &amp; then makes a claim his identity is "compromised". A bit like Rakhi Sawant and Mikha Singh controversy. OP being Rakhi Sawant of course. And now makes claims about some death threats. Classic victim card move, like the Islamists, do it. Demand sharia, kill people and when the police enter the scene, just scream "victim victim" till your lungs give out. At first, I thought the guy is just a technical dude without an agenda, respect in that case regardless of whether he was pro or not pro bjp. \n\nb) He goes through in detail on how he went about finding out the bot accounts and the aws setup etc to create this "mini product" only for defeating BJP IT cell by spending 2L. Well, no prizes for guessing better products already exist: For ex:  [https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/#!/](https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/#!/) . They analyze more features and would cost far less. So why run "40 aws servers?" . Beyound me.\n\nc) The guy then makes a claim he has no agenda no bias. But "only" choose to run analysis on BJP accounts. Running the same analysis on different political parties would be a logical thing to do and then publish findings so it\'s neutral. So clearly this is targetted against a group in this case BJP as was evident in the post. The problem is this is against twitter rules to target:  [https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/enforcement-philosophy](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/enforcement-philosophy)  The claim that "BJP IT" cell owns this account NEEDS proof that these accounts were created by them. Just because they benefit them doesn\'t necessarily mean they created it. That part of it also breaks twitter rules. \n\nd) Ever heard of Social media marketing, the guys on fiverr that will promote your product on social media platforms? Right from those small guys to larger social media marketing teams use bots. They have since twitter came out with an API. It is not new, there is no "breaking news" there. The attempt to create this fake narrative of "this evil empire" to create sensation and unrest is a little disappointing. No  "coalgate" or "telecom" level scam here or  "wikileaks" level stuff here, so let\'s move on.\n\ne) Then batman goes on creating a platform to talk about islamophobia. At a time when, more than 19,000 underage girls were molested by Pakistani origin Muslims, when people in UK are literally taking defence classes and walking in stab-proof vests because they fear a Muslim terrorist will stab them or their family, a paris girl was brutally raped by a muslim "in the name of allah", when Indian congress politicians basically says loyatly is for dogs in essence callling all the freedom fighters and people loyal to the country including armed forces/police/firefighters etc dogs. Batman wants to talk about islamaphoa. Not about the actual suffering of persecuted non-Muslims some of whom faced ISIS style treatment in pakistan.\n\n A more logical thing, a logical person would want to talk about would be:\n\ni) How can CAB be improved(if you disagree with the current form)\n\nii) How can reforms in Islam be bought so we don\'t have another west bengal or kashmir style genocide &amp; reduce the aggression and radicalization in Islam. Logic would say more integration of muslims should reduce a huge number of problems on all ends. \n\nBut no, let\'s talk about how the whole world is wrong and we need to dole out special treatment for Muslims because if the world doesn\'t then the world is Islamaphobic . Surely that solves all the problems. But what do I know, I haven\'t ever run 40 aws servers at the same time. Certainly not m5 instances.'<br />Author: 'LiberatedSoul1984'  id: 'eifc6f'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eifc6f/bjp_it_cell_vs_reddit_it_cell/</li>

Well, it was even more popular than scary-end-of-the-world predictions of 2012 among others! Well, for once hope won over fear!\n\nNow that 2020 is on us, are we the India 2020 that was popularised by Dr. Abdul Kalam? \n\nThat dream is officially 24 years old. Kalam and his team at TIFAC prepared a vision document for the country in 1996, a decade after TIFAC itself was born, incubated under the Dept. of Science &amp; Technology. Kalam took as much pride in the document as in his successes with ISRO and DRDO.\nTIFAC laid down a roadmap for sixteen sectors the country should focus on, with numerous sub-areas of technology assessed as the means to acheive it. TIFAC certainly inspired many govt. funded programmes and missions, including TIFAC-CORE which gave a major push for research infrastructure and Industry-academia interaction.\n\nBut will 2020 be the year that Kalam and others dreamt of? Most probably not, we are most likely just halfway in that journey. But on the optimistic side, haven\'t we grown in all terms in the last 24 years?\n\nBut it doesn\'t stop here, and we needn\'t dwell in regret. In 2015, TIFAC came up with a renewed mission Technology Vision 2035, a sort of version 2.0, in tune with the changes within India and around the world- a fresh technological roadmap for the country\'s progress. It\'s a document prepared with so much love, and all lovers of sci-tech should look into it. As the document says: \n"... while TV 2020 spoke to an aspiration of a developed India in 2020, TV 2035 speaks to the realisation of a developed India in 2035"\n\nhttps://tifac.org.in/index.php/activities/technology-vision-2035\n\nSo lovers of science and the country, let\'s keep dreaming- this time more vividly and work more vigorously to give our tiny bit to it! :)\n\nHappy new year ! let the dreams keep going!'<br />Author: 'SOCH-staymoderate'  id: 'eidewd'<br />Score:38<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eidewd/is_the_dream_of_kalam_dead/</li>

Or they\'re at the center of the whole thing. Before 2014, I never saw any kind of urgency. It was all "sab chalta hai" and "whatever" kind of mentality in people. We were hopeless. Corruption was all time high and most of us didn\'t even think we could ever get out of this quicksand of hopelessness, and have a better nation in front of our eyes.\n\nThen came Modi with tall promises of "acchhe did". Although I\'d voted for them, I wasn\'t hopeful. All the politicians are bad. I wasn\'t too much into the politics either, but one thing was sure. There was no urgency before that. \n\nEver since the Modi govt came, things went haywire. People, instead of mumbling "whatever", "I don\'t care" or "sab chalta hai", gradually started talking about economy, development, govt schemes. They either hated the govt for their policies or admired them. Before that, I *personally* didn\'t think we had a backbone as a nation. \n\nNeed weapons? Beg the West to help.\nNeed to tackle Pakistan effectively? Beg America. \nNeed to work on our internal matters? Beg some powerful country. \n\nMost of us dreamt of moving to some other better country because we had no hope. Not gonna lie, a lot has changed since then. Not only I feel we have some backbone, because our diplomats are respected there, but also we are capable of a lot more positive. We don\'t have all our problems solved magically but we\'re getting there. \n\nHowever,*some people* waged a war against us. We\'d be abused:\n\nFor being a Hindu.\nFor being upper class Hindus.\nFor sticking a harmless sticker of lord Hanuman in our cars.\nFor chanting Jay Sri Ram. \nFor celebrating our festivals. \n\nDiwali is all about pollution. Holi is all about water wastage and sexual harassment. Bhai Dooj, Raksha Bandhan and Karwa Chouth are about misogyny where some evil upper class Hindu men are tormenting the innocent Hindu women. Someone made a post how on Dhantares Hindus waste their money on gold instead of doing some charity, unlike **other religions**. \n\nThis became mainstream since Modi came into the power for the first time. \n\nMuslims are being tortured in India. Evil Modi is going to kill all the Muslims. Lynchings are happening and the victims are only Muslims. \n\n*Desh ka musalaman dara hua hai*. \n*Muslims feel afraid because of tall statues of Hindu deities.*\n*Mughal rulers were not bad.*\n\nAnd so on... \n\nWhen elections\' results in 2019 were declared, there was a WORLDWIDE hysteria on how Muslims in India are in danger now. When Art. 370 was removed, the same happened. \n\n**No one** talks about Hindu genocide at the hands of the Mughals. Those who do, are guilt-triped into believing they\'re hurting the minority feelings. I don\'t see how our ancestors\' genocide is any different from that of the Jews\' and doesn\'t deserve to be talked about. No one mentions what happened to the Kashmiri Hindus. If you do, you are avenging them by hurting poor Muslims of Kashmir. The fact that those Kashmiri Hindus are still around doesn\'t even matter and all you get is exasperated groans from the people who are ready to wipe our existence out of this planet. \n\nAt the end of the day, for saying anything in your defence, you\'re called out. \n\n- Cow urine\n- Cow dung\n- Temple goers\n- Bh@kt\n- Misogynistic\n- Nazis\n- Hitler\n- Terrorists\n- Rapists \n\n[I\'m not sure how many people are going to read this, but it\'s been in my mind for months.

      <li>Title::: 'CAA and those who would be left out of the soon to be implemented NRC'<br />Body: "What would happen to all those individuals who would be left out of the NRC? Theoretically all the non-muslims can still become citizens of they claim and prove that they are illegal migrants from the CAA related countries. But there seems to be some serious practical and procedural problems for this so called safety net offered by the CAA to non-muslims. Some of these are listed below. I hope everyone would engage with these questions and give their suggestions on how these situations will be dealt with by the state. Also feel free to post your own doubts and problems in the comments which haven't been listed here.\n\n1. According to the Assam model, there will be multiple arbitrations and updations after the first NRC and during these procedures the involved parties in all probability would make claims that they are Indian citizens and might even give affidavits confirming these claims starting from local bureaucrats to the foreigners tribunal. Once these statements are in their files how can they claim that they are undocumented migrants from foreign countries who could avail the protection offered by the CAA, if they are absent from the final NRC?\n2. How can people prove that they are from the specific countries. It should be kept in mind that most of the m couldn't produce any documents prove their Indian citizenship. How would they then establish foreign citizenship and religious affiliation convincingly?\n3. What would be done if people convert or blindly claim that they belong to one of the persecuted minorities ?\n4. What would happen with children of undocumented migrants (born in India) belonging to minorities from the three countries? They were never foreign citizens and never faced persecution for their religious beliefs.\n5. What would be the status of atheists and children from inter-religious marriages?\n\nUnless the government can give convincing answers to these questions and to the numerous others raised by various critics and sceptics moving forward with the implementation of CAA-NRC would be disastrous and would render very large sections of the society stateless. It might also lead to a mafia supplying fake documents and would encourage rampant corruption among the various levels of the bureaucracy. The Muslims who can't prove their citizenship convincingly will be surely screwed. Also beyond this a large number of poor Hindus and other religious minorities and dalits will also be rendered stateless by the NRC and they might not be protected by the CAA (which I believe was a main agenda for the government). I think the government is lying to almost every community in the country except the rich individuals/groups and even maybe planning to remove poverty by removing the poor."<br />Author: 'jacobt478'  id: 'ei03op'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ei03op/caa_and_those_who_would_be_left_out_of_the_soon/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'MODI AND SHAH WILL FAIL, PROVE ME WRONG( NOT A LIBERAL)'<br />Body: 'Now to start with let me make one thing clear \nFascism is my preferred political ideology,   I don\'t mean fascism in the more common use of the word which retarded liberals use to reference the Nazis, I mean it in the much more literal sense, in the sense of a govt. Which uses it\'s governing power to serve the nation and the people above all else which also includes how you approach it economically.  Something along the lines of the Falangism of Franco. \nHowever, it\'s not hard for me to recognize the fact that it can never work without the population being homogenous in ethnicity, religion and race.\n\n\nNow it\'s obvious to all of us India would have been much better off had all the Muslims and Hindus been completely separated in two different countries at partition.  \n\nThere would have been no contradictory political parties and no religiously driven conflicts not to mention the lakhs of people who have been massacred in the name of religion. \nAlas now that we have hundreds of millions of Muslims in our country, the nationalist route is doomed from the start, since a huge majority of the Hindu population harbors a huge hereditary grudge against the Muslims for conquering them in the first place. Also, The Muslim minority will never go along with a India first agenda as well, because of the bjp and it\'s massively retarded campaigns recently, because now the India first agenda is justifiably seen as Muslims last. \n\n\nThe Muslims saw triple talaq as a affront to their religious customs, they reacted violently to Kashmir being liberated from article 370 and now they are going fucking wild over CAA and NCR. \nCan you blame them ? I certainly can\'t. \nEven though there is literally zero reason for them to get worried about this new bill but still it singles out Muslims and of course you can\'t blame them for not trusting such a Hindu nationalist govt. Can you. Certainly not. \n\n\nAnyway moving , how do you see it going from here though ?\nLet me tell you. \nModi and Shah have said they will not repeal the bill no matter what. \nThe protests will continue until the bill has gone which we also all know, something similar to what\'s happening in hong Kong with the extradition bill although not exactly the same scenario. \nSo what Happens next ? Around 25 people are dead already. \nPeople are dropping like flies now. \nSo the protestors will also get more violent, they already have a pretty violent religion so not much is required for them to do that. \nSo then a couple cops and constables get killed. And then 50 protestors get killed and then more cops get killed \nFinally it turns into a mini civil war all over the country , army will of course side with the bjp since everybody knows by now Bipin Rawat is basically modi"s dog by now. So the protestors get brutally repressed by the army , shoot on sight orders given and many are killed and the protest ends. \nSo what next ?\nWell we have millions and millions of domestic terrorists in the county overnight. The maoist insurgency will look like a joke conpared to what these people will get up to because make no mistake they are not afraid to die for a cause and kill 20 people along with them. \n\n\nModi is retarded. there\'s 200 million Muslims in the country.  200 million. Do you know how huge that number is ?\nA lot of "Sanghi Hindu Rashtra Now !! " Warriors, thousands lakhs will also die.  Because there will be a civil war if this continues for sure.\n\n\nit\'s all very blackpilling to be honest, another major drawback that I also feel in reaction to this  there will be a rise of a  super liberal party which will now have to capitulate to the demands of the minorities, which I do not want at all. \nMost of all I feel disappointed in modi and his fucking retarded way of doing things, he has destroyed the vision of a right wing government as a force for doing good for many foreseeable years now.\nHopefully some sort of Civic nationalist movement will rise up but I fear it will take a long long time.\n\n\nBut all of thats besides the point. The point is that of you play out the events happening today to their logical conclusion, the only thing they will end in is decades and decades of strife. And will further put this country into the gutter. Since we are all realists , we must be under no confusion as to how bad the state of our nation is , in almost any metric imaginable.

Incidentally, it is the monocultural societies like Japan, Korea and China that aren't suffering from these problems; China of course is *Sinicizing* it's non-Chinese populations with ease, like they've been doing for Millenias. \n\nHomogeneity gets less credit than what it deserves. It brings more order, unity, stability, continuity and a general sense of oneness within the state. I think BJP leaders see the value of homogeneity and are trying to, dare I say, *Confucianize* India by whichever means possible.

The bias is so terrible that, they even constantly put down Kshatriyas very often whom they are narrating about. \n\nNow, I wonder if there was any Mahabharata written through a Brahmin perspective?

Now, I understand that most minorities in those countries have no where to go and it is really noble for the government to provide them citizenship. But, we are still a developing country with major issues like unemployment and overpopulation. \n\nI am not saying that we should deport all illegal migrants, we should rather look into their case on a case-by-case basis and make a decision. I mean a minority returning to a Taliban controlled area in Afghanistan is totally different than them going back to a province in Bangladesh. We could also get assurances from certain countries like Bangladesh that there minorities will be protected. \n\nSome people say that they don’t have anywhere else to go other than India, I mean I’m sad that they don’t, but we have to make sure that our citizens are living a good life before we look into brining more people in. I mean, Ughiur  people don’t get automatic citizenship if they go to a middle eastern country. The same way, no persecuted Christian minority is going to get an automatic citizenship in a western country, the best thing they could hope for is a refugee status and that too if they have a good case. The same way, just because they are Hindus shouldn’t be enough for them to be eligible for citizenship.

It was then my 6th sense started working,y would someone leave 2 youngesters ar home alone? Was my dad right? My parents would never move an inch,and y the girls left\n\nI stayed away from Alam knowing something was wrong here. He tried to get close to me but I just couldn't loosen up.i moved out in next 15 mins saying my mom is calling me. He called me next day saying sorry and I said for what. He was like I thought u didn't like it\n\nNext his mom calls after 3/4 days asking me sweetly y m I not coming down and how she was missing me when she cooked chicken biryani. This time my stomach started churning bec y would someone else mom who has got 5 kids rem me for chicken biryani. She asked me to visit her\n\nI thought maybe it's in my head and said let me loosen up and meet her,anyways she is a nice and sweet lady. I enter her house and see her reading Quran. She makes me sit and keeps on reading it. After 15 mins she looks to me and says let me read the first page of Quran to u\n\nShe read the first page of Quran and I said hey listen my mom reads hanuman chalisa but I don't dwell into it. She looked at me and said this are infidel stuffs please avoid them\n\nThat's the time I realised this is fucked. I acted as if my phone rang and my mom calling. Ran away from the house. Dad was at home,I took all my guts and told him what happened.thinking will get nice slaps today. My dad had tears in his eyes. He hugged me and started crying\n\nHe looked at me and called my mom.

I didn't want to post this at a time when this sub was brigaded by trolls seeking to disrupt, naive new users and Pakistani users. Now that this issue is in it's final phase of dying it's time for some introspection.\n\nWhat the fuck was going on. The amount of substandard, shitty content that was on this sub in the last 3 weeks would put any circlejerk to shame. The anger, the name calling, the fallacy in arguments made the discussions very very low quality. Though in between there were many useful and high quality discussion about this topic the amount of bad ones outnumber them. This is not ideologically targeted, but will speak about both left and right. Kudos to mods to manage this shit so effectively.\n\nFirst of my Bhrahtas on Right, especially the new users. Though I appreciate your zeal in countering misinformation and falsehoods, more than an asset you were a big big liability. You see when debating a political issue 'Typical leftists mentality' and 'Fuck off to the sub that shall not be named' aren't valid fucking arguments. Also, you may want to highlight the hypocrisy of the left by mentioning news which involves Muslim preparators which aren't reported or misreported by mainstream media but the result you achieve is a sub full of them. What use is getting butthurt over them? Yes the mainstream media omits such stories, in other news water is wet. Do you think you would achieve anything other than reveling on your own ideology? Fuck no. What you would achieve is this becoming a echochamber. Why do you think I care? Because I have seen this happen before. Before any idiot who happens to identify with left wing opens their mouth saying 'yes, this is an echochamber', no it isn't. There are still many users including mods who are calling bullshit when they see it and do not give a fuck calling a spade a spade. \n\nLook the problem in the first place isn't you all coming here and voicing your opinions. The problem is you coming here to affirm your political opinions. On this CAA+NRC issue I stand like a fucking rock behind the BJP, but that isn't because I support BJP. It's because I took dwelled deep I to this topic and listened to the argument on both sides. If you actually believe in anything you need to be disciplined enough to not let your emotions cloud your judgement and fuck it up. Think about your consequences before your actions.\n\nThen I turn to left. The problem is the most of users on the left rather than guided by a zeal to protect secularism or to protect the right are more guided by their visceral hatred of BJP and Modi. Another problem is something shared with the new users here you obviously haven't made any effort to find more about RSS or Sarvarkar or Hindutva yet act as an expert on them. At least have the common decency to learn about the thing you hate to understand it more. As with RW users 'fascist, b#@kts and whatsapp university' aren't valid arguments. Neither is calling this subreddit an echo chamber when you just came from a subreddit that is. It's like a pot calling the kettle black.\n\n And it's not that this sub doesn't has good users who are left wing. There are many who argued properly like /u/gryphus-scarface /u/whydoieven_ /u/lister971191. The problem is all the left wing users that come here don't come here as a  permanent users. Their permanent refuge is another subreddit. They only come here to participate in political posts when a political event happens. That is participating in bad faith.\n\nThis event has pushed both left and right even further left and right respectively. And looking at the current political situation, the ones who move into center first will win.\n\nPS: I will make a different post analysing the current political situation."<br />Author: 'srthk'  id: 'ehkgfc'<br />Score:87<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ehkgfc/rant_the_caa_clusterfuck/</li>
