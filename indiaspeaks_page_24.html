The practice started in the 3rd millennium BCE, evolved in early-medieval times and ceased by the late 19th century CE, where these structures were ascribed with sacred values.

At the water level, there is a sculpture of Vishnu reclining on a 1,000-headed snake. Vishnu, also known as "Narayan", meaning one who lives in water, highlighting the nourishing attribute of water and its relationship with the world; before anything existed, there was water.*\n\n*The architecture is more than just a structure. It is utilitarian and more. It focuses on sustainability for its community. It offers religious elements - a shrine for worship. It offers a social space for community.

The user then has 48 hours to petition the new court to have their content reinstated, and the court then has seven days to consider the petition.\n\nIf the court finds in favor of the user and the social media platform does not restore the content or unblock the account, they will be fined up to ‚Ç¨1.8 million by the Office of Electronic Communications. The whole process will happen online, according to Ziobro.\n\nThe victims of ‚Äúideological censorship‚Äù are unfairly quashed by social media platforms ‚Äújust because they express views and refer to values that are unacceptable from the point of view of communities‚Ä¶with an ever-stronger influence on the functioning of social media,‚Äù the justice minister said. \n\n\nThe user of social media must feel that his rights are protected. Nor can there be any censorship of speech. Freedom of speech and freedom of debate are the essence of democracy.\n\nThe new court will also be tasked with handling blocking requests regarding content that does violate Polish law. Additionally, it will handle a new type of ‚Äúblind‚Äù lawsuit in which someone who is wronged by an anonymous party on the internet can file a lawsuit to correct the wrong, even without the defendant‚Äôs personal data. All that would be needed for such a suit is the offender‚Äôs username, the website where the offending post was made, and the date and time of posting.\n\nSecretary of State Sebastian Kaleta said this solution represents a significant improvement over attempts by countries such as France and Germany to handle such problems, noting that their efforts are ‚Äúprimarily repressive‚Äù and focus on the quick removal of content rather than protecting free expression.\n\nA government press release specifically cited the European Commission‚Äôs Digital Service Act ‚Äì a sprawling EU-wide piece of legislation which also ‚Äúfocus[es] on removing prohibited content‚Äù ‚Äì as one of the motivating factors behind Warsaw‚Äôs rollout of the new protections for online speech. \n\n‚ÄúPoland wants to adopt its own regulations, effectively defending the constitutional right to freedom of expression, so that in the event of a dispute‚Ä¶the courts will decide on a possible violation of the law,‚Äù it said.\n\nhttps://www.rt.com/news/510352-poland-free-speech-social-media/'<br />Author: 'BalHanumanJi'  id: 'ktpv5d'<br />Score:63<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ktpv5d/while_the_land_of_the_free_is_using_ownership_of/</li>

      <li>Title::: "After Dark : Three King's Ritual"<br />Body: "#Welcome my fellow insomniacs to Indiaspeaks : After Dark. \n\nHeres a proper way to personify the no sleep. Do share your midnight macabre here with us. \n\nThe Three Kings\n\nThere have been many accounts, of night travellers and sleepy bike riders,  encountering spectral apparitions in the mist of the darkness of night. \n\nPerhaps something about the night or tiredness or the constant humming of the engine shifts you into a suspended sleep state. But what happens when you see dreams with open eyes?\nYou see things which aren't supposed to exist. \n\nThe Three Kings ritual delves into the same machinations to provide you with an opportunity to talk to your subconscious. \n\nIts not a a ritual for the faint hearted. \n\nIf you must play this game, you play with its rules, which are fairly simple but necessary. \n\nIf you plan to do this, you must have a trusted person with you, who genuinely cares about your safety. \n\nIdeally only two of you should exist in the house. The night before the ritual you need to prepare for it.\n\nFind a room in your house, if you have a basement, even better. If its a room cover the windows with black paper, no light should come in from the outside. \n\nYou will need the middle area of the room, so clear it off. Here's what you will need\n\nThree chairs\n\nA bucket full of water with mug\n\nA table fan\n\nA candle\n\nA lighter\n\nA wrist watch\n\nTwo big mirrors, big enough for you to see atleast till your torso.\n\nA small sentimental object (*although personally I think its just to spook you for giving the ritual extra edge*)\n\nThe night before the ritual you set up the room. After clearing the room place a chair in the middle of the room. People say it just face north,  but again I think its just for dramatic effect.\n\nPlace the fan exactly behind the chair. Turn its swing function off. Keep it on medium or low.  Turn it on and leave it on. \n\nNow place the other two chairs on the sides of the middle chair, facing it. Put the mirrors on the chair. The mirrors should be placed as such that, you should be able to look at your reflections from the corner of your eyes,  without turning.\n\nPlace the water filled bucket infront of the middle chairs with the mug in it. \n\nTurn off the light and leave the room keeping the door open. Turn off all the lights in the house.\n\nBefore going to sleep, keep the candle the lighter and your mobile beside your bed. Put an alarm for 3.30 am. Sleep wearing the wrist watch. \n\nWhen you wake up at 3.30 am, you will need to move fast. Grab the mobile put it in your pocket. Take the candle and the lighter, dont turn on any lights. \n\nLight the lighter and go into the ritual room. Shut the door but don't lock it. \n\nBefore 3.33, you should be seated on your chair or throne. Check the time on your wrist watch.  Light the candle at exactly 3.33 am. \n\nYour ritual has begun. \n\nFor the ritual to be successful you must look straight. At any point you are not supposed to look in the mirrors. You should only be able to make out your reflections through corner of your eyes. \n\nYour eyes should stare into the darkness infront of your, continuously. \n\nIf you have done everthing well, a joker and a queen will appear on either side. Which is which, will be up to you to find out? \n\nYou can ask then any question you would like. About yourself and others. The queen will tell you the truth the joker will tell lies. \n\nFor them you are either their queen or joker.  That's why its called the Three Kings ritual.\n\nThe ritual ends at 4.34 am. If you aren't back by yourself by then, your friend should call you on your cellphone. \n\nIf you aren't answering the friend should open the door and call your name out. \n\nIf arent responding the friend should take the mug front the bucket and douse you.\n\nIts said at any point the friend is not supposed to touch you. But then again its more for dramatic effect it seems.\n\nAnd again its said if everything fails to bring you back the sentimental object will be your path finder for your way back. \n\nThe people who have tried have had experiences on varied kind. Some feel asleep, some didnt see anything, some came out with profound truths about themselves and others. \n\nBut still, it remains the game of the strong willed."<br />Author: 'Sakthlavda'  id: 'kta7p8'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kta7p8/after_dark_three_kings_ritual/</li>

At the various doctors I\'ve seen, the costs have been up by about 20-30% than what I remember a year and half ago. This includes everything, consultation, tests, procedures, medicines. Also a thing to note is that I\'ve only been at private practitioners and most of my expenses have been out of pocket barring for one for which I\'ll have to get my insurance to reimburse me and I\'ll have to have a whole ordeal of what cost was necessary and not like I had to when I was hospitalized when I was young. \n\nI know the government heavily regulates medicines so as the costs remain competitive but I am slowly seeing us going the US route of having private insurances and private hospitals and practitioners that screw us financially a lot. I\'ve seen first hand how bad it is in the US (not the healthcare per se, but the costs, like my friends not going to the doctors until it\'s too bad resulting in complications later, etc.) I believe the government introduced a Rs. 5 lakh insurance (which I do like, however it might contribute to increased privatization). Also, these WhatsApp forwards of malpractices don\'t help restore public beliefs in the system and resulting in people going the "alternate medicine route" that screws them more (seen this firsthand too) (Also, I believe this to be one of the few reasons why people in the US believe in conspiracies like anti-vaxx, essential oils, etc.).\n\nThe last sentences might be a little emotional to say the least, but I can\'t help but notice the trends and parallels. Also, I\'m not accusing the current government of this, I\'ve been noticing this trend for a very long time, regardless of the central and state governments I\'ve seen.\n\nAny Doctors?

      <li>Title::: 'The Third Battle of Panipat, 14th of January, 1761'<br />Body: '(This is the last post in the series. I\'ll post relevant related posts, but not all, as I expect you all to look for them in my profile. Thanks for reading these posts and I hope you enjoy this last one as well.)\n\n\n\nWe resume our story where the two armies were faced off against one another, the Maratha Army as an imperfect inverted crescent and the Durrani as an imperfect crescent itself.\n\n\n\nThe Two Armies at Panipat :\n\n\n\nAccording to Kashi Raj, the Shah had inspected a muster of his troops a day after Dussehra, October 20. The number then, was 41,800 horse and 38,000 foot. Of these 24 \'dastas\' of 1200 men each, or 28,800 men along with 10,000 foot were composed of the Shah\'s regular Afghan force, along with their 200 camel swivels, 40 pieces of artillery and some "shaturnaals". This along with Najib-ud-Daulahsl\'s 6000 horse and 20,000 foot, Hafiz Rahmat and Dunde Khan\'s 15,000 foot and roughly 4,000 horse. Allowing for the fact the pre battle skirmishes had claimed the lives of soldiers on both sides, the Abdali army in the field may be estimated to a total of 60,000\n(this estimate being borne out by Sir Jadunath Sarkar himself)\n\n\n\nNow, we look at Kashi Raj\'s record of Bhau\'s muster at Kunjpura, on October 19, 45,000 horse, 15,000 foot, latter including 9000 Gardi sepoys. Allowing for casualties, estimates show that at Panipat, the army had 45,000 total men on the field.\n\n\n\nDeployment of Forces :\n\n\n\nMaratha Forces \n\n\n\nThe Maratha camp had debated all night regarding a plan of action, yet most historians agree with the conclusion that the conduct of the Battle shows that such a plan did not materialise.\n\n\n\nHence, Bhau\'s army was deployed in part, according to the political situation in the camp and in part, owing to the confidence Bhau placed in individual commanders. He placed Gardi closer to the enemy, at the left, himself in the centre and the Maratha Sardars, whose troops and they themselves were low on morale due to previous defeats, furthest away from Durrani on the left. \n\n\n\nIbrahim Gardi occupied the extreme left wing with 8000 (approx) musketeers. Heavy Maratha cannon were placed in front of the infantry, in 3 deep columns in the form of a spear head, to lead their march. To support him stood, Damaji Gaikwar (2500 horse) and Vithal Shivdeo (1500 horse) and some petty captains (2000 horse) with their light horse.\n\n\n\nBhau and Vishwasrao occupied the centre with their persona Huzurat (13,500 Huzurat cavalry) \n\n\n\nThe Right being formed by Antaji Mankeshwar (1000), Pilaji Jadav\'s son, Satvoji (1500), Yashwantrao Pawar (1500) and Shamsher Bahadur (1500) with Jankoji Scindia (7000) and Malharrao Holkar (3000) contingents, all horse, along with petty captains (2000 horse) at the extreme end. Light artillery was placed in front of these positions.\n\n\n\nDurrani Forces\n\nGiven that Abdali commanded absolute control, he placed his forces in the centre, as a wedge between his Indian Allies to avoid defection. He also held back reserves and himself observed and commanded from his observation post close to his camp.\n\n\n\nThe Durrani Right facing Ibrahim, was under Barkhurdar Khan (3000 Kabuki Infantry) and Amir Beg with Persian Horse. Along with Hafiz Rahmat Khan and Dunde Khan ( 14,000 of which 1/4th was cavalry) followed by Ahmad Khan Bangash (1000 foot) .\n\n\n\nThe Centre was under Wazir Shah Vali Khan with 15,000 troopers, 2,000 camel swivels and 1,000 Kabuli Infantry.\n\n\n\nThe Afghan Left was under Shah Pasand Khan (5000 Persian horse). Najib-ud-Daulah with 15,000 foot and dismounted cavalry followed by Shuja-ud-Daulah with roughly 4000 men 1/3rd of whom were musketeers.\n\n\n\nThe Battle of Panipat 14th of January, 1761 :\n\n\n\nFirst Phase (9 AM to 12 PM noon)\n\n\n\nThe Battle began, as was custom in those days, with a salvo from both sides. The was followed by a Maratha cannonade, meant to carve a way for the Gardi Infantry, yet the inherent faults of Maratha cannons, made the cannonade ineffective. This fiasco continued for an hour, until Ibrahim sized the initiative, halted the cannonade and advanced his musketeers towards the Afghan left. He detached 2 batallions to keep a watch on Barkhurdar Khan and Amir Beg, covering his flanks. The remaining 7 batallions, marched under him personally, slowly towards the enemy. Yet, the infantry outpaced the heavy guns mean to support them.\n\n\n\nThus, the Gardis, now marching towards the enemy fell upon them, killing many in Rohillas, though they were outnumbered. Just then, Vithal Shivdeo, commanding the light horse, made a charge upon the Rohilla foot in front of him, yet the hail of Rohilla bullets, meant that he soon had to retreat. He had broken the order of battle, euffered casualties and had nothing to show for it. Instead, he sapped his soldier\'s morale as well.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Gardis had inflicted a loss of 8-9000 men on the Rohillas. Yet in the exchange, he had lost almost all of 6 battalions. Had Vithal Shivdeo held back, a tremendous charge could have routed the Rohilla left now, yet, as we have already seen, the Maratha commanders and the army had fallen from their disciplined days of old.\n\n\n\nThe Second Phase (12:30 onwards) \n\nIn the centre, Bhau\'s light artillery in front of his troops fired its rounds and Shah Vali Khan, took this as a signal to commence the attack. Soon his camel swivels took down the Maratha light artillery and Bhau knew that he had to reply.\n\n\n\n With their traditional war cry of "Har Har Mahadev!" the pride of Maratha Cavalry, the Huzurat began and impetuous charge so ferocious that the Afghan forces of the centre were swept before them, despite being armed with muskets and Matchlocks. The over-powering and irresistible charge of a sea of 13,500 swords and spears that flashed in the sun, fell like tornado of fury and inflicted heavy casualties on the Afghans. As Kashi Raj himself says "The fighting was so violent that the earth and sky couldn\'t be seen and the eye of heaven became dazzled at the beholding spectacle".\n\n\n\nAnd yet, despite this, the advantage of an Afghan centre in retreat or a beaten Afghan left, couldn\'t be pressed home. The Marathas lacked good cavalry in reserve which could drive home these gains and hold the territory gained, plus, how could Bhau abandon his position, given the camp full of women and civilians in his rear and the Abdali reserves in the enemy camp?\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, when Abdali heard news of these events, he took the following steps. He ordered his "Zenana" to mount their steeds and wait inside his pavilion. Next he commanded the 500 "nasaqchis" or military provosts to drive out by brute force, both retreating and reserve forces. Hence, within an hour, Abdali had reinforced his position with 4-7000 men. On the other hand, such communications were not maintained by Bhau.\n\nThus, by 1 PM, Durrani had fresh troops in the field.\n\n\n\nThe Final Phase (post 1:30 PM)\n\nDurrani had reinforced his lines with fresh troops against the Marathas who were famished for a fortnight not to mention exhausted. He had also commanded all position to advance and take down the enemy before them.\n\n\n\nAll this while the Afghan left had remained silent as well as the Maratha right. However, Najib-ud-Daulah, was the exception this. He was brave, cunning and adventurous. His tactical acumen showed itself here. \n\n\nHe commanded his cavalry to dismount with their muskets and thus instead of cavalry and foot he now had 15,000 musketeers, in total. Next, he ordered his rockets, 2000 of them, to fire at once, to create a thick wall of smoke. Behind this wall, he moved his infantry, quarter of a mile at a time, and they would throw up breast works of sand in front of their lines. Thus, he covered his movement, disorientated  and froze the enemy and advanced in order at the same time. By 1 PM he stood only within a long range musket shit of the Maratha Right.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the centre, Shah Vali Khan had made an attack into the Maratha centre, being reinforced by the Abdali Guard cavalry and foot. He attacked with no restraint and it was during the attack, that an unfortunate zamburak, hit 17-year old nominal commander of Maratha army, Vishwasrao, who now lay dead in his uncle Bhau\'s arm. \n\n\n\nNews of his death spread in the camp and the left and right wings, demoralising all men, which now being raised by a detachment of rebellious Afghans who had been recruited before the Battle. Gardi was overcome by sheer numbers and the impetus of Najib-ud-Daulah\'s attack, forced the right into rout. Here Holkar, Scindia and others retreated with what civilians they could take.\n\n\n\nAnd so, there he was, Sadashivrao Bhau, holding the lifeless corpse of the graceful pride of the Chitpavan Peshwa\'s manhood in his arms, his own nephew, a warrior like his ancestors were, who had died in that hell on Earth called Panipat.\n\n\n\nIn his last desperate and vengeful assault, Bhau charged and rallied his men three times, changed his mount thrice, killing as many Afghans as his strength would allow, until finally he was wounded by a spear and musket shots. He was lurching on the ground when some Durrani horsemen attacked him. "The wounded lion, now cornered" killed 2 of the 3 men attacking him, until he was killed himself. And beheaded.\n\n\n\nI will not say anymore, than this, that both Bhau and his nephew, were given proper Hindu last rites, by the Brahmin Prime Minister of Awadh, Kashi Raj himself. Marathas casualties in terms of troops is estimated 30,000. While the Abdalis suffered 10-20,000 themselves. Surajmal Jat, fed and clothed 50, 000 Maratha men and women fleeing the site. More could be said, but the Battle is what we are interested in.\n\n\n\nSources : "Marathas and Panipat" by Hari Ram Gupta\n\n\n\n"Ahmad Shah Abdali in India" and "Fall of Mughal Empire Vol I and II" by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n"Military System of the Marathas" by S.N Sen\n\n\n\n"Ahwal-eJang-e-Bhau-va-Ahmad" by Kashi Raj'<br />Author: 'PushyamitraShunga1st'  id: 'ksdzy4'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ksdzy4/the_third_battle_of_panipat_14th_of_january_1761/</li>

I'm a senior in American high school and I elected to take an Ancient Civilization course to learn more about cultures. My teacher seems open to discussion and he has always been respectful of customs when teaching them. \n\nToday we started a unit on ancient India. He described how the original settlers in India were the dark-skinned Dravidians, who had a complex language and built the cities Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa. He said that these cities were unique in ancient civilization because their grid pattern suggested they had a strong central government.\n\nHe went on to say that light-skinned Aryans from Europe eventually came to India and conquered much of the population of the Dravidians, comparing the scenario to the genocide of Native Americans or the Aborigines. Also, he noted that their language was Sanskrit. He showed the class comparison images of the Dravidians and Aryans--there was a very pronounced difference between their skin tones and features.\n\nI was interested in this topic so I looked up some more about it after school. I found out that the Aryan Invasion Theory has been pretty much debunked. I'm just perplexed that he, an older history teacher, would be so ignorant.

      <li>Title::: 'The story of disinvestment under Congress, UPA , NDA, Who fared better ?'<br />Body: "# Congress Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao who had started the disinvestment of some of the state-owned companies by selling minority  stake sales \n\n**What happened to the Disinvestment Ministry under UPA**\n\nIn the 2004\xa0Lok Sabha election, the\xa0Congress-led UPA\xa0had raised the issue of disinvestment and managed to\xa0defeat\xa0the\xa0BJP-led\xa0NDA government‚Äôs\xa0‚ÄòIndia Shining‚Äô campaign. \n\n# But the first thing they did when they came to power was,\n\n After Manmohan Singh became\xa0the\xa0Prime Minister was shut down  the\xa0disinvestment\xa0ministry. It was turned into a department in  the\xa0finance\xa0ministry, relegated to the periphery, some would say. \n\n# Before disinvestment proceedings stood at,\n\nThe disinvestment proceed in 1995-96  was Rs 168 crore against a target of Rs 7,000 crore, Rs 379 crore  against a target of Rs 5,000 crore in 1996-97 and Rs 906 crore against a  target of 4,800 crore in 1997-98.\n\n# The story of  Atal Bihari Vajpayee who took this to another level\n\nOne of the better-known economic legacies of former prime minister  Atal Bihari Vajpayee was his push for privatization of the central  public sector enterprises (CPSE).\n\nIt was the first government to set up a separate disinvestment ministry with Arun  Shouri as the minister. \n\nThe Vajpayee-led government privatized as many  as 12 public sector companies during their tenure, including big ones  such as Maruti Udyog, Hindustan Zinc, Bharat Aluminum, Videsh Sanchar  Nigam Limited among others. \n\n# Despite oppositions, under Vajpayee, the government fetched Rs  37,000 crore through disinvestment of various central government  entities from 1998 to 2004. \n\nTwo of the major public sector companies privatised in the Vajpayee  regime \n\n**Hindustan Zinc, Bharat Aluminum (BALCO)** \n\nIt was taken over by Anil  Agarwal-led Vedanta group's flagship company Vedanta Limited. \n\n# Hindustan  Zinc posted a turnover of Rs. 1,418 crore during 2001-02 has now grown  17 times in as many years post-privatisation. \n\nThe company has posted a  turnover of over Rs. 24,000 crores during 2017-18. \n\n**BALCO**  \n\nUnder the same group has grown to over Rs. 9,000 crore turnover in  2017-18, according to the financials filed by the company with RoC.\n\n**Maruti Udyog** \n\nSold it to Japanese automaker Suzuki Motors. In the  first phase, Maruti Udyog issued rights issue of Rs. 400 crore with the  government renounced its rights shares to Suzuki. Suzuki paid Rs 1,000  crore to the government as control premium to gain management control in  Maruti. In the second phase, the government sold its existing shares  through a public issue and exited completely in 2006 and the company was  renamed as Maruti Suzuki India.\n\nThe company posted a turnover of  around Rs. 6000 crores during 200-01, is now 14 times bigger in size as  on date. The company posted a turnover of Rs. 88,581 during 2018-19.\n\n# Now\n\n# Maruti\xa0Suzuki\xa0is now one of the biggest wealth-creating\xa0companies\xa0in India\xa0with\xa0more than Rs 3 trillion\xa0market capitalisation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CMC and Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL)**\n\nTata Group also took over two the  public sector companies.  Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL). CMC Ltd, involved in hardware  maintenance, systems engineering, system design, development,  consultancy and networking had recorded a turnover of little over Rs.  500 crores before getting privatised have doubled its revenues by  2013-14 to Rs 1,339 crores and before getting merged with the parent  company TCS in 2014. \n\nSimilarly, VSNL was also sold to Tata group for Rs. 1,439 crore and  was renamed Tata Communications had posted revenue of almost Rs. 8,000  crore during 2001-02, however, the company's revenue only increased two  times to around Rs. 17,000 crores in 2017-18.\n\n# Banking Sector\n\n Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha\xa0in the Vajpayee government had also\xa0mooted\xa0the  idea of cutting down government stake in PSU banks to 33 per cent. \n\n# Now\n\nThat has still not happened\xa0as the Modi government\xa0has been stuck at\xa0the  proposal of\xa051 per cent\xa0**even as these banks have been among the biggest wealth destroyers.**  \n\n#  Modi-led NDA  government raked in around Rs. 2.8 lakh through disinvestment during  2014-15 to 2018-19, which translated into 91% of the amount they had a  target to raise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jmgyruavar961.png?width=799&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f3333876231220b12612427a7510e9a23397655\n\nWith Air India sale on cards, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman  announced a hike in the government's disinvestment target for FY20 to  Rs. 1.05 lakh crores in her first budget as compared to Rs. 90,000 crore  in the interim budget presented by the BJP-led government in February.

      <li>Title::: 'After Dark : Which is your strange/ paranormal experience that you cant explain to this day? Heres mine.'<br />Body: "It happened when I was a wee young lad, bounding up the twelfth class. I remember it clearly to this day.\n\nThe city I used to live at was somewhat weird in its planning. Well which city isnt in India barring a few exceptions. So for the tuition classes I used to go to the other part of city and there was a bridge which joined both parts. \n\nThe bridge was an important construction as it was the only thing which joined both the parts of the city. And weirdly even after being in the smack middle of the city there was no human settlement near one kilometre vicinity of the bridge, on either side. \n\nAnd it wasnt devoid of a reason. Its an ancient city and since time immemorial, the bridge or the area near it was known to be haunted. \n\nI never paid any heed to such old wives tales. Until that fateful night. \n\nI had planned to stay back on the other side of the bridge at a friend's place as early in the morning next day, we had a test at the tuitions at 6.00 am. Bring the winter season it was a lot of trouble crossing the town on my moped, teeth chattering all the while to reach the tuitions. \n\nBut as my misfortune would have it, someone from my friends family was critical following a major accident. So the family had to leave urgently, my friends protest to stay back fell on deaf ears and I was in a precarious position. \n\nBut not wanting to be a point of bother for the family I decided myself to get back to my home. \n\nMust have been around 12.30 pm I bade farewell to the family and self started the moped. I tucked myself well with the jerkin, pulled its hoodie above my head and tied it. \n\nIt was especially foggy that night. As I crossed the slumbering city, I found myself the only dweller on the roads. The air was icy cold. \n\nAs I neared the bridge I thought to myself look at this bridge looking so innocent and harmless, people just get spooked cause of the  deserted place, thats all.\n\nJust as I finished this thought I felt a significant drop in power of the moped, its engine started sputtering. I was already on the bridge by now, no matter how much throttle I gave her, she gave feeble signs of life and died exactly at the middle of the bridge. \n\nI tried the self, I tried the kickstarter, nothing worked. Before the engine had stalled I had managed to get it near the wall of the bridge, to avoid collision in case of incoming traffic. Because the fog had really thickened up by now.  The golden light of the streetlights were the only sign that there were street lights. \n\nThe place was eerie, with the halos of light formed around the street lights and no sound from any direction. It was weird for an open space to be this silent, I thought. \n\nJust as I moved towards the wall of the bridge to see if there was water flowing below, because I couldn't hear anything, I heard a  whisper, inside my left ear. It was just a sound, as if someone had exhaled near my ear. \n\nWhat bothered me was that both of my ears were well covered. I had made sure no wind could pass in. I looked sound warily, there was nothing, nobody. \n\nFor a moment I thought of making a break for it. It was impractical, I wasnt thinking straight. My home was long way from there and the cold was biting. I took a deep breath, grabbed the handles of the moped and started dragging it. There was a slope just where the bridge ended which I thought could jump start the engine. \n\nAs soon as I started walking away from the spot, I felt as if mutiple cold needles were piercing my body. I had never experienced anything like this, it was almost too painful to bear. I felt I was burning up, by cold. I took every ounce of energy I had and didnt stop. I kept pulling the moped. It wasnt getting better,  I felt as if I was getting pierced more and more as I went further.\n\nAs soon as I reached the end of the bridge I jumped on the moped gave it a mighty push with everything I had. The moment I left the bridge, the sensation stopped. But the remember trying to self start the moped like a madman, somehow it started on the first try. \n\nI zoomed so fast till home that I didnt even realise I was at the front gate. Once inside I pulled up my shirt and saw multiple small red indurations on my skin. For once I thought I may have got chickenpox. But it wasn't. \n\nI didnt tell anyone about it. And to this day you can always hear water flowing when you stand near the walls of the bridge.\n\nBut that night, that night was different."<br />Author: 'Sakthlavda'  id: 'krw3je'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/krw3je/after_dark_which_is_your_strange_paranormal/</li>

This needs to be read by every Indian.'<br />Body: '#Long Kept Secret\n\nWe, in ISRO, occasionally heard about highly suspicious death of Prof. Vikram Sarabhai in 1971. Also heard occasional doubts about sudden death of Dr. S Srinivasan, Director of VSSC in 1999. Case of Shri Nambinarayanan in 1994 is well known. But I never thought that I will be at the receiving end of such mystery.\n\nI was poisoned with deadly Arsenic Trioxide on 23rd May 2017, during promotion interview from Sci/Eng SF to SG in ISRO HQ at Bangalore. Fatal dose was probably mixed with chutney along with Dosai, in snacks after lunch. What followed was nightmare lasting for almost two years Severe loss of blood to the tune of 30-40% through anal bleeding. I barely could come back from Bangalore and was rushed to Zydus Cadila hospital in Ahmedabad. It was followed by severe breathing difficulty, unusual skin eruptions and skin shedding, loss of nails on feet and hands, terrible neurological issues due to hypoxia, skeletal pain, unusual sensations, one suspected heart attack and Arsenic depositions and fungal infections on every inch of skin and internal organs. Treatment was received in Zydus cadilla, TMH-Mumbai and AIIMS-Delhi over a period of two years. Famed forensic specialist, Dr. Sudhir Gupta told me that in his whole career, for the first time he was seeing a live specimen of a survivor of assassination attempt with fatal dose of assassination grade molecular As2O3. Otherwise his experience was limited to cadavers.\n\nI am thankful to one of my Director colleagues, present at the same meeting, who warned me on 5th June 2017, of possibility of poison given to me. Probably, I guess, he witnessed poison mixing in my food. On 7th June, MHA security agency personnels met me and alerted me of Arsenic poisoning. I am thankful to them, as their info helped doctors to focus on exact remedy instead of scratching their heads with unusual signatures of my ailment. Security agencies took me to different cities. I am sure, without their intervention, I would have been dead with multiple organ failure within two to three weeks.\n\nI learnt that this poison is given in molecular level suspension (crystal level is harmless) just after heavy meal. It is a colourless, odourless, tasteless suspension and hence cannot even be suspected. It gets absorbed through stomach during food ingestion, kills RBCs immediately to such large extent that the fine blood vessels are clogged, leading to heart attacks and strokes within two to three hours and the victim can easily be passed of as heart attack death. Fortunately, that day, I did not take lunch. Arsenic passed directly to colon region and most of them got rejected through bleeding. The small remnant created so much damage to my health that I only know and I kept my morale high to face the danger with poise.\n\nThe motive appears to be espionage attack, embedded in the Government set up, to remove a scientist with critical contribution of very large military and commercial significance, like expertise in building Synthetic Aperture Radar. I will also not rule out it also as a new modus operandi of adjusting seniority and clear me who was perceived as obstacle. Whatever may be the reason, it was a great shame for the country and our security apparatus.\n\nWhat pains me is that ISRO hierarchy and my colleagues tried to shun me as pariah. I pleaded with two successive Chairmen to help me in getting justice. Kirankumar tried his best to convince me that my earlier case of squamous cell carcinoma is resurrecting. I personally talked to Dr. Kasturirangan and Shri Madhavan Nair and they developed cold feet. What followed was a series of nightmares, alongwith severe deterioration of health. I was bombarded with hundreds of threatening emails to keep my mouth shut. I was saved by whiskers, due to alacrity of security agencies, from massive explosive incident, in which Rs. 100 cr. lab was destroyed. This happened on 3rd May 2018.\n\nOn 19th July 2019, an Indian American professor of one of the topmost US university suddenly appeared in my office. He requested me not to utter a word in future. As a quid pro quo, my IITK grad son will be accommodated in a top notch college in USA. I declined and he left my office at 1430 hrs. And my thirty plus years contributing career was consigned to sinecure position at 1630 hrs. on the same day. I was removed from all responsibilities, including SAC Directorship.\n\nMy security was breached and I was poisoned with gaseous poison, probably Hydrogen Cyanide, which hypoxiates leaving no trace, on 12th July 2019. I was hypoxiated severely, leading to convulsion, loss of senses and memory. I survived because of NSG training of my PSO. I was transferred immediately to hospital, administered ozonised oxygen and had to spend couple of days in ICU. Hospitalization was followed by a long treatment for hypoxia, which is still continuing. Curiously it happened just two days prior to planned launch date of Chandrayan 2 on 15th July. Probably to prevent me to be present there on this occasion.\n\nThere was a plan to defame me by doctoring the CCTV recording of my room on 23rd and 24th Jan, 2020. It still baffles me how this high security recorder, located in the room of Director, SAC was accessed, contents were digitally edited and played back in analog for rerecording. CCTV recorders are special recorders which can only be fed in analog and can be digitally retrieved. The attempt was foiled because of alertness of security agencies. I still marvel at the cinematographical quality of editing of such an unimpressive fellow like me.\n\nFor last two years there were mysterious appearances of poisonous snakes like cobra, krait at a regular intervals of a few days in my quarter. Karbolic acid vents are put every 10 ft. Yet nobody could prevent intrusions of the snakes. Fortunately because of my four cats and my security staff, they could be killed or caught alive. Only three months back, we accidentally discovered a carefully laid secret tunnel in my compound and hidden in a trove of banana plantations. Once we blocked the tunnel, all snake intrusions stopped. Two incidents convinced me that the mysterious people are after me and probably going to hit me hard before my superannuation at the end if this month. They want my mouth shut forever.\n\n1. All the signatures point to deliberate poisoning of my mentally challenged son with Covid 19. The poor boy, who cannot even speak or eat or carry out hygiene activities himself, had to be hospitalized for 10 days, followed by months of complications.\n\n2. There was a failed attempt in poisoning me with Arsenic, probably in first week of September 2020. It failed, but it was enough to create signature of quite good amount of poisoning, leading to skeletal pain, skin peeling and nail dying.\n\nEnough is enough. I have faith in our security apparatus and men. But these mysterious men are much more equipped, trained, lethal and determined to snuff out living witness of the most shameful incident of Indian science.

WHO has already declared it a pandemic. Common blood groups of most humans include A, B, AB, and O.  Laure Segurel, a human evolutionary geneticist and a National Museum of Natural History researcher from France, once stated ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs fascinating, the evolutionary history, even though I don‚Äôt think we have the answer to why we have different blood types.‚Äù\n\nBlood types are like genetic traits that you inherit from your parents. The Austrian immunologist and pathologist Dr. Karl Landsteiner discovered blood groups in 1901 and won a Nobel Prize for his work later.\n\nHowever, antibodies help in identifying any foreign antigens and tell the immune system to destroy them. Antigens that recognize the ABO blood group are a combination of sugars and antibodies which are part of the body‚Äôs natural defense system and proteins that coat the surface of red blood cells. Thus, giving some other person blood from the wrong group can be life-threatening.\n\nRead more [https://www.quantnix.com/index.php/2020/09/12/which-blood-groups-are-at-higher-risk-from-covid-19/](https://www.quantnix.com/index.php/2020/09/12/which-blood-groups-are-at-higher-risk-from-covid-19/)'<br />Author: 'techxiler'  id: 'kr0j1f'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kr0j1f/which_blood_groups_are_at_higher_risk_from_covid19/</li>

After entering the college I slacked off really hard tanked all my grades. Partially due to my attitude and partially due to misguidance from seniors. Now I have a really low goa that means I am getting the worst of the companies to sit in. Pandemic hasn't been useful either.\nI did prepare for competitive coding and data structures really good but none of that matters because my cg is really bad. I am in my final year. I think I have wasted my potential. I am now looking towards government exams like ssc cgl rbi etc.  But I think I keep a negative company that keeps making me think every thing is going to shit under Modi era and there will be no government jobs.  I know this not true because obviously there are things like income tax sebi rbi which can never be privatised. But the negativity is too much and is having effect on my preparation. I am not sure what I am looking for posting this here maybe some motivation maybe some assurance that everything is not gonna go to shit and things I am preparing for will still remain. I gave my CAT exam got a okayish 95 percentile but it's worthless because my cg is really low I will have to score higher to get something.

      <li>Title::: 'Sad situation of UP-Bihari Labourers in Punjab'<br />Body: 'While Part Time Punjabi Farmers are Partying on Delhi-Punjab Border, The Immigrant Bonded Labourers from UP-Bihar had been working tirelessly since the time when LockDown was eased due to CoronaVirus so as to ensure that Riches of these Part Time Farmers grow by leaps and bounds. No One cares about them, not even those Part Time Farmers who are Protesting on Delhi-Punjab Borders. So, Let\'s have a look at Minimum Wage paid by Punjabi Farmers to Bihari Labourers in Punjab. I am adding up the Excerpts and News Links related to it:\n\n**Low Salary**\n\n[https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/paddy-farmers-migrant-worker-up-bihar-punjab-6441914/](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/paddy-farmers-migrant-worker-up-bihar-punjab-6441914/)\n\n"For paddy sowing, Punjab needs nearly 6 lakh migrant labourers to complete the task. This year only 5 to 7 per cent of the required migrants are available for this work in the state due to the [Covid-19](https://indianexpress.com/about/coronavirus/) outbreak.  \nIn such conditions, Punjab‚Äôs local ‚Äòkhet mazdoor‚Äô (farm labourers), who are over 15 lakh in number, have been demanding between Rs 4,500 to 5,500 per acre for the job (the amount is split between number of workers who complete the task per acre), which is a hike of 25 per cent to 53 per cent compared last year‚Äôs rate.  \nIn Punjab, the usual rate for paddy transplantation ranged between Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,600 per acre depending upon the region till last year.  \nThis has led to hundreds of panchayats, particularly in the Malwa region of Punjab, pass resolutions to cap rates for paddy transplantation in their respective villages between Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000 per acre. Some of these panchayat resolutions also mandate imposing a fine of up to Rs 50,000 on farmers not abiding by the diktat and paying more.  \nJagmohan Singh, general secretary, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Dakaunda, said:‚ÄùAs per our initial estimate around 35 to 40 per cent, farmers will go for the ‚ÄòDSR‚Äô. We need labour for transplanting paddy on around 45 lakh acres, which can be done by our khet mazdoors.‚Äù  \nBut for even this labour gap to be filled farmers and the ‚Äòkhet mazdoors‚Äô have to find common ground on wages.  \n‚ÄúIn our area, a large number of village panchayats have already passed resolutions capping the per acre rate. An increase of Rs 200 to Rs 300 per acre is acceptable, but local\xa0khet mazdoors are demanding a hike of Rs 900 to Rs 1800 per acre,‚Äù said BKU Ugrahan leader Jagsir Singh from Bathinda.\n\nLachhman Singh Sewewala, who heads the Kheti Mazdoor Union in the state, however, justified the higher rates being demanded.\xa0‚ÄúEvery year the rates are increased and if we are increasing them this year, they why are some farmers making it an issue and involving panchayats? At least 6 persons are required to transplant paddy on one acre in one day and if they will get just Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000 then each one among them gets only Rs 400 to Rs 500 as their share. However, if the same work is done by three migrants in one day on one acre, then they earn Rs 800 to Rs 1,000 as their per person share.‚Äù\n\n**Poor Living Conditions**  \n[https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/migrant-workers-in-bihar-up-they-want-trains-to-take-them-back-to-work-in-punjab-fields-6392575/](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/migrant-workers-in-bihar-up-they-want-trains-to-take-them-back-to-work-in-punjab-fields-6392575/)\n\nJaipu Sharma is anxious for train services to resume. ‚ÄúIf they start running today, I‚Äôll be the first to board and reach my destination tomorrow,‚Äù says the 30-year-old farm worker.\n\nThat is a sentiment voiced by many migrant labourers stranded in other states and out of work amid the nationwide lockdown. But Sharma‚Äôs journey is the reverse ‚Äî from his village of Singhpur in Rupauli block of Bihar‚Äôs [Purnia](https://indianexpress.com/elections/purnia-lok-sabha-election-results/) district to ‚Äúanywhere in Punjab‚Äù for work.\n\n‚ÄúI spend 8-9 months of the year in Punjab. I would have been busy harvesting wheat there now. Instead, I am stuck harvesting rabi maize here, which pays Rs 200-250 daily, and the work will be over in the next 10 days. There, I get Rs 350-400 and the landowners also provide 5 kg of dry ration (flour, dal, salt and spices) per acre,‚Äù he says, speaking to [The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/) over phone.\n\nAt his village in Bihar since mid-January, Sharma was to return to Punjab by April 1, in time for wheat procurement. Now, he is keen not to miss out on paddy transplanting that starts mid-June. ‚ÄúThe government has declared that farming activity will continue even during lockdown. But for that, labourers have to be allowed to move. How can transplanting happen without us? They should start sending trains from here. All the workers in my village are ready to leave for Punjab,‚Äù he says.\n\nPaddy transplanting is normally done by labourers in groups. ‚ÄúSix of us can cover two acres daily or 60 acres in a month. At Rs 2,500-3,500 per acre, the rate varying depending on supply and demand, we earn Rs 25,000-35,000.

If you recall what happened just after Maharashtra elections, it was Ajit Pawar who deflected first and went to BJP, even the governor allowed them to form a govt. and Fadnavis even became the CM for a day, didn\'t he?\n\nBut what happened the next day was simply unbelievable. We come to know that SS+Cong+NCP announce that they did have numbers and that they are going to form a govt.\n\nThe problem with this narrative or story is that BJP didn\'t even try to push against their opponents (at least the central leadership anyway). In an interview later with Rajat Sharma, when he asks this same question (what went wrong with BJP), Amit Shah doesn\'t answer that in a straight manner. All he says that our alliance partner (SS) broke with us. But the story can\'t be that simple, right?\n\nHow can a party with 300+ seats in center and the one that changed Kashmir\'s politics forever didn\'t even have enough clout to fight this minor pushback against a few local Maharashtra politicians?\n\nOne theory I\'ve heard is that Fadnavis is "too liberal" for BJP\'s taste and many BJP members don\'t like him. Is this internal politics the cause for that then? Is it possible that some BJP members initially prepped up Fadnavis to do the swearing in with Ajit Pawar just to make him look like a fool in the media once Pawar took back the support next day? Politics is complex and difficult to understand in general but its impossible to believe that BJP lost this almost won battle without any kind of internal sabotage, what do you think?'<br />Author: 'learned_cheetah'  id: 'koqen5'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/koqen5/did_bjp_deliberately_lose_to_shiv_sena_and/</li>

All other divisions like regionalism or caste are a structural weakness for a country.\n\nBut to fully transition to that reality India will have to implement electoral reforms first and move away from First Past the Post voting, to a mixed system, where parties which don't have concentrated vote share in a constituency but one scattered throughout the country are not at an inherent disadvantage."<br />Author: 'Silent-Entrance'  id: 'ko8unp'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ko8unp/i_think_the_allies_leaving_the_nda_because_they/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'An interesting article about a historic hero our textbooks did not mention'<br />Body: "Tilka Manjhi: A Tribal Hero Our History Books Forgot\nwww.livehistoryindia.com\nThe Revolt of 1857 may have cost the British East India Company its biggest cash cow ‚Äì India, eventually leading to its closure ‚Äì but there were many rebellions before this one that resisted the British oppression in the subcontinent. Many of these were tribal revolts, the first of which was the one led by Tilka Manjhi, a revolutionary leader from the hills of what is present-day Bihar. The mass rebellion he mobilised, or the Manjhi Revolt, in the late 18th century, set the tone for other tribal rebellions that followed.\n\nTilka Manjhi was born ‚ÄòJabra Pahadia‚Äô on what is believed to be 11th February 1750, in a village called Tilakpur in Sultangunj, Bihar. Historians are not sure whether Manjhi was a Pahadia or a Santhal tribal but he is known as ‚ÄòJabra Pahadia‚Äô as this is how he is mentioned in the British records of that time. But it was his fiery nature that earned him the nickname ‚ÄòTilka‚Äô, which in the Pahadia language means a ‚Äòperson with angry red eyes‚Äô. He earned the moniker for his rage against the British East India Company, whose officials started addressing him by that name. Jabra later became the head of his village and it was customary in his tribe to address the village head as ‚ÄòManjhi‚Äô.\n\nBengal under the East India Company in 1770 &amp;nbsp;\nBengal under the East India Company in 1770  |Wikimedia Commons\nSetting the Stage: Confiscating Tribal Land\n\nEven though Bengal was established as a suba or a province independent of Mughal rule after the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707 CE, the Nawabs of Bengal persisted with the Jagirdari system of administration, a feudal set-up whereby revenue officials called jagirdars and zamindars were appointed to collect revenue from the land, most of which they handed over to the state treasury.\n\nHowever, the local jagirdars and zamindars exploited the adivasis or tribals by levying taxes that were much higher than justified. Just when the adivasis thought it couldn‚Äôt get worse, the zamindars were replaced by the British East India Company, which pushed the tribals to a tipping point. The only option they had was to revolt.\n\nThe Company had already acquired the Jungle Mahal region (adivasi lands in today's Midnapur District of West Bengal) from Nawab Siraj-ud- Daula in 1750 CE. This was followed by the Company taking control of Santhal Pargana and Chhotanagpur in 1765 CE, after the defeat of Mir Qasim in the Battle of Buxar in 1764 CE, and the resultant transfer of the Diwani of Bengal to the Company.\n\nWith the Company directly administering and collecting taxes in Bengal and Bihar, the adivasis became more and more indebted to mahajans (money lenders). The Company had connived with the mahajans to wrest the land from the tribals, in lieu of unpaid loans, and the British became landowners in the Santhal Pargana region. Thus, in no time, the simple adivasis were reduced to mere agricultural labourers or ‚Äòtenants‚Äô on their own lands. The British had broken the almost sacred and umbilical bond that Bengal‚Äôs tribal communities had with the land.\n\nTilka Manjhi, in his youthful years, had witnessed this transition. Around 1770 CE, Tilka was already addressing and mobilising people in small gatherings in Bhagalpur, urging them to oppose Company rule and to rise above the divisions of caste and tribe to reclaim what was theirs.\n\nThe People's Robin Hood\n\nThe year 1770 CE is remembered as the year of the Great Bengal Famine when an estimated 10 million people are believed to have starved to death. Santhal Pargana and Bihar were some of the worst-hit regions. Under these dire circumstances, the people expected humanitarian aid as well as tax exemptions from the Company. On the contrary, the Company increased taxes and resorted to collecting them forcefully. While the Company filled its coffers, it provided no relief or aid to the people and millions perished out of starvation.\n\nResentment against the British was building and Tilka looted the Company's treasury at Bhagalpur, the district capital where the treasury was located, overpowered the guards, and distributed the spoils among the peasants and his tribesmen, who were reeling under the double whammy of the famine and the forceful collection of taxes by the Company. This is the first attack by Tilka Manjhi in recorded history. Immediately, Tilka gained the respect of his people and became a local Robin Hood.\n\nAt the time, Bengal was under the command of Governor Warren Hastings and he immediately dispatched an 800-strong force led by Captain Brook to capture Tilka and quell his revolt. The force unleashed atrocities on the Santhals but failed to capture Tilka.\n\nIn 1778 CE, the adivasis united under of a 28-year-old Tilka Manjhi and they attacked the Punjab Regiment of the Company stationed in the Ramgarh Cantonment (in present-day Jharkhand). The tribal force was so fired up that their traditional weapons outdid the rifles of the Company‚Äôs soldiers. As a result, the British fled the cantonment.\n\nTilka Manjhi vs August Cleveland\n\nFollowing this humiliation, the British realised that if not handled properly, the tribals could become a real threat to their interests in the forest areas of Bengal. Thus, they appointed August Cleveland, a shrewd British officer, as the Collector of Revenue for Munger, Bhagalpur and Rajmahal districts. Cleveland realised that the best way to suppress the rebellion was by making a dent in adivasi unity.\n\nHe learnt the Santhali language to communicate effectively with the adivasis, and it is said that around 40 tribes in the Santhal Pargana region soon accepted the authority of the Company due to benefits such as tax exemptions bestowed on them by Cleveland. The canny British officer also raised an army unit from among the tribes in the hills. Employing the adivasis as sepoys in the Company and thereby providing them with employment was a master stroke that aimed to break their unity.\n\nTilka was also offered a job in the hill force raised by Cleveland as well as the exemptions granted to the chiefs and their tribes. However, Tilka understood the real intentions of the British, so he resisted these enticements. He still had the support and love of the people and worked tirelessly to strengthen adivasi unity for the final showdown with Cleveland. Tilka sent messages on sal leaves to tribal groups that had not yet accepted British authority, asking them to unite to save their lands. This had the desired effect and he was able to rally massive support among his people.\n\nLieutenant General Eyre Coote\nLieutenant General Eyre Coote|Wikimedia Commons\nThe Attack on Bhagalpur\n\nTilka took a daring decision to attack Bhagalpur and catch the enemy napping, and the adivasi charge on Bhagalpur in 1784 CE took the British completely by surprise. Heavy fighting ensued between the tribals and the British. In the midst of the chaos, Tilka fired a shot from his bow. His poison arrow found its mark and Cleveland fell from his horse, fatally wounded. He died a few days later. Having dealt a major blow to British morale, Tilka Manjhi and his comrades retired to the safety of the jungle, largely unharmed.\n\nCleveland being killed by an Indian adivasi was a wake-up call for the East India Company, which sent a strong force under Lieutenant General Eyre Coote to put an end to Tilka's revolt and capture him, dead or alive. It is believed that someone from Manjhi's camp betrayed him and revealed the whereabouts the adivasi leader to the British, who attacked Tilka and his men in the middle of the night. Tilka barely escaped but a large number of his comrades-in-arms were martyred in the skirmish.\n\nA painting illustrating the execution of Tilka Manjhi by Dr Lal Ratnakar&amp;nbsp;\nA painting illustrating the execution of Tilka Manjhi by Dr Lal Ratnakar \nCapture and Execution\n\nTilka fled into the forests of his hometown, Sultanganj, and continued to wage guerrilla warfare from the safety of the forest against the British. However, the British effectively blocked all supply routes to Tilka and his men. Eventually, Tilka had no option but to engage with the British. It is believed that it was 12th January 1785 when Tilka's forces clashed with the British for the very last time. Hungry and tired, they were quickly overpowered and Tilka was finally captured.\n\nWhat followed next was horrific. Tilka was tied to horses and dragged for miles, all the way to Bhagalpur. It is said that he was still alive when he was untied from the horses, on reaching Bhagalpur. As people watched, Jabra Pahadia's short yet well-lived life was brought to an end on 13th January 1785 CE by hanging. He was only 35 when he died.\n\nSadly, the revolt did not have an impact on what the tribals were fighting for. The British with all the might further aggravated the suppression of the adivasis and the exploitation of their lands. However, his revolt actually made the Company realise that they could not take the tribals lightly. His revolt, in the long run, inspired the adivasis to organise themselves and take up arms against the British in the region in the future.\n\nTilka Manjhi‚Äôs story has fallen through the pages of our history books. In 1991, though, the brave tribal leader‚Äôs supreme sacrifice received some recognition when the Bihar Government renamed Bhagalpur University the ‚ÄòTilka Manjhi University‚Äô, and a memorial dedicated to him was erected at the site of his hanging.\n\nTilka Manjhi‚Äôs heroic stand against the British would inspire generations of adivasis to rise up against colonial oppression. The most notable among them were the Kol Uprising in Singhbhum, Jharkhand in 1831 and the very successful Santhal Uprising in Santhal Pargana in 1855. While forgotten by the rest of India, Tilka Manji lives on, immortalised in the songs of the tribals, who eulogise and keep alive the memory of a David who tried to slay a Goliath in the hills of Santhal Pargana.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nAkash Anurag is an aspiring legal mind whose heart still beats for anything with a historical association.\n\nTilka Manjhi\nYou May Also Like\n\nSnapshort Histories\nDadabhai Naoroji travels to England\nBy Dinyar Patel\nDinyar Patel tells the story of Dadabhai Naoroji, the foundational figure in India‚Äôs modern political history\n\nSnapshort Histories\nPanchatantra: The World‚Äôs Timeless Classic\nBy Akshay Chavan\nThe story of how Panchatantra travelled across cultures, to become a part of the world literature.\n\nSnapshort Histories\nIndia‚Äôs Stamp on Palaeontology\nBy Aditi Shah\nIndia scripts its own Jurassic World, being home to some very significant dinosaur finds.\n\nSnapshort Histories\nDogs Through the Ages\nBy Aditi Shah\nA faithful relationship that goes back 15,000 years.\nSupport\nSupport\nEach day, Live History India brings you stories and films that not only chronicle India‚Äôs history and heritage for you, but also help create a digital archive of the 'Stories that make India' for future generations.\n\nAn effort like this needs your support.

A specific group of local influential men were targeting young girls. First Farooq Chisti trapped one of the girls from Sophia Senior Secondary school, Ajmer and took obscene photos of her. Then the accused blackmailed the girl into familiarising them to her classmates and friends. Eventually, other girls would be raped, sexually exploited and have their pictures taken at a farmhouse. The cycle continued so forth. The gang continued to expand its operations and victimise an increasing number of girls. They photographed the girls in compromising positions, using the images to exploit the victims.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How The Serial GangRape came to Light ?**\n\nThe editor of Navjyoti, Deenbandhu Chaudhary, had admitted that the local law enforcement authorities were aware of the scandal almost since a year before the story broke, but they allowed the local politicians to stall the investigations. Even Choudhary himself was hesitant before running the story, the reason was the perpetrators of the crime belonged to the family of ‚ÄòKhadims‚Äô. Khadims are the families of traditional caretakers of the Ajmer Dargah, they claim to be the direct descendants of the first followers of Khwaja Moinuddin Chisty and hold significant influence in the local communities. The police had stalled the case because the local politicians warned action against the accuse would lead to massive communal tension.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChaudhary stated that finally, they decided to go ahead with the story because that seemed to be the only way to wake the local administration into action. Finally, the police lodged an FIR against eight of the accused. Further investigations led to 18 men in total being charged and tensions ran high in the town for several days. Most of the accused were Muslims, many from the families of Khadims and most victims were young Hindu girls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Islamic Rapists:**\n\nOf the 18 accused who were charged with abduction and gang rape under the Indian Penal Code and Indecent Representation of Women (prohibition), one has since committed suicide. Interestingly, Farooq Chishty, one of the main accused who also happened to be a youth Congress leader, was declared mentally unstable. Farooq Chishty was the president of the Ajmer Youth Congress while two other accused, Nafis Chishty and Anwar Chishty were the vice-president and joint secretary respectively of the city Congress unit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 1998, a sessions court in Ajmer sentenced eight men to life imprisonment but the Rajasthan High Court, in 2001, acquitted four of them. The sentence of the other four was reduced to just 10 years by the Supreme Court in 2003. They were named Moijullah alias Puttan, Ishrat Ali, Anwar Chishty and Shamshuddin alias Meradona. Another absconder Salim Chishty was arrested by the Rajasthan Police in 2012. Another main accused, Alamas Maharaj, is still at large and is believed to be in the US. CBI has issued a red corner alert for him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFarooq Chishty, who was earlier declared mentally unstable, was convicted by a fast track court in Ajmer in 2007. In 2013, the Rajasthan High Court upheld the decision though it reduced the period of the sentence from life imprisonment to the period already served by him. The memories of the case were brought back recently when Suhail Chishty, after absconding for 26 years, surrendered at a court on February 15.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**News Links:**\n\n[https://www.opindia.com/2018/02/india-rotherham-ajmer-chisty-congress-dargah-muslim-rape-gang/](https://www.opindia.com/2018/02/india-rotherham-ajmer-chisty-congress-dargah-muslim-rape-gang/)\n\n[https://hindi.opindia.com/national/ajmer-rape-case-1992-congress-chishti-dargah-rajasthan/](https://hindi.opindia.com/national/ajmer-rape-case-1992-congress-chishti-dargah-rajasthan/)\n\n[https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rajasthan-almost-three-decades-after-a-rape-blackmail-case-rocked-ajmer-surrender-of-an-accused-opens-old-wounds-5076914/](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rajasthan-almost-three-decades-after-a-rape-blackmail-case-rocked-ajmer-surrender-of-an-accused-opens-old-wounds-5076914/)\n\n[https://askburg.com/hundreds-of-hindu-teenage-girls-were-raped-at-moinuddin-chishtis-dargah/](https://askburg.com/hundreds-of-hindu-teenage-girls-were-raped-at-moinuddin-chishtis-dargah/)\n\n[https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/crime/story/19921015-murder-of-ajmer-daily-editor-exposes-sordid-sex-scandal-involving-criminals-politicians-767014-2012-12-26](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/crime/story/19921015-murder-of-ajmer-daily-editor-exposes-sordid-sex-scandal-involving-criminals-politicians-767014-2012-12-26)\n\n[https://askburg.com/hundreds-of-hindu-teenage-girls-were-raped-at-moinuddin-chishtis-dargah/](https://askburg.com/hundreds-of-hindu-teenage-girls-were-raped-at-moinuddin-chishtis-dargah/)\n\n[https://www.thelallantop.com/tehkhana/ajmer-rape-case-infamous-rape-case-in-indian-history/](https://www.thelallantop.com/tehkhana/ajmer-rape-case-infamous-rape-case-in-indian-history/)'<br />Author: 'PatronSaintOwl'  id: 'knmrdh'<br />Score:93<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/knmrdh/the_forgotten_1992_ajmer_sharif_dargah_gangrape/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Third Battle of Panipat, 1761. A Comparison of the Maratha and Durrani Armies'<br />Body: '(This was to be my final post in my series, but I\'ve decided to provided a detailed analysis of the two armies and the battle separately, and my own conclusions in the end. Thanks to everyone who has interacted with these posts)\n\n\n\nTHE MARATHA ARMY AT PANIPAT :\n\n\n\nNature of the Army \n\n\nThe Maratha army present at Panipat was an opposite of the armies commanded by Shivaji Maharaj during his legendary campaigns. His army had one Supreme commander, himself and was predominantly infantry with limited cavalry.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, at Panipat, the army was one where with the exception of Gardi Infantry, the remaining army of largely cavalry and the force although under the command of Bhau, had many allegiances to Sardars, Rajas and other feudal lords.\n\n\n\nMaratha Cavalry\n\n\nThe cavalry consisted of 4 classes :\n\n\nThe "Khasgi Paga" or Peshwa\'s private cavalry, was heavily equipped, armoured and trained. At Panipat, these were at a strength of 6000 apart from the 37,000 total cavalry under different chiefs. The Marathas usually used melee weapons on horseback, never being proficient with using firearms on or off the horse. \n\n\nThe "Silhedars" were paid lower than the Khasgi and hence were relatively less armored.\n\n\n\nThe "Ekas" were individual volunteers, who brought their own horses and equipment.\n\n\n\nThe "Pindaris" were a plundering, mercenary force that was laid out of what it could loot. They were mostly ill equipped and very less reliable.\n\n\n\nMaratha Artillery\n\n\n\nThis department of the Maratha Army was more a handicap than an asset during the Battle of Panipat. The Guns were relatively well cast, but were carried in clumsy carriages. No standard calibre existed, and balls were cast indiscriminately. Hence, when being shot the guns would be damaged. Not to mention, poor logistics meant a long baggage train that trudged along at a snail\'s pace.\n\n\nA word ought to be said about the Gardis. Ibrahim Gardi was present at Udgir and his Gardis played a pivotal role in the victory. Hence the Bhau and Ibrahim grew close and bought advocated for pitched battles, which went against traditional Maratha understanding of war. Hence, the traditional sections of the army and the Gardis had bad blood.\n\n\n\nTHE DURRANI AND HIS ALLIED ARMY :\n\n\n\nNature and Organisation :\n\n\nThe army was divided into the Askar-e-Munazzam, literally Regular Army, and the Askar-i-Ghair Munazzam, the Irregular Army. The Regular Army constitued 1/3rd of the Durrani forces. While the latter, constituted of tribal horsemen, constituted the remaining Durrani Force.\n\n\n\nDurrani Cavalry\n\n\nThe Regular Army was 3/4th cavalry, armed with carbines or muskets, with long scimitars. Protected by buff jackets and often with mail shirts as well as with helmets or chain-twisted turbans. Compared to their Maratha counterpart, these cavalry were proficient in the usage of the firearms, both on and off horseback. They ride Afghan horses, and used lances, etc. \n\n\n\nThe irregular or tribal cavalry, did the reconnaissance duties of Pindaaris but also were held in the reserve and finished the rout by hacking the feeling enemy when they routed. \n\n\n\nDurrani Infantry\n\n\nA 4th of the army was comprised of infantry. Armed with swords and heavy Jezails, these guns allowed for heavier projectiles and more accuracy.\n\n\n\nDurrani Artillery\n\n\n\nThis was the flower of the Durrani force and the Shah\'s pride. 2/3rds were heavy guns and 1/3rd were light pieces. Heavy ordnance was drawn by horses, while the lighter ones such as "Zamburaks" or "Shaturnals" were carried individually, in twos or threes on camel back.\n\n\n\n\nBefore finishing the description, an analysis must be made of the forces of Najib-ud-Daulah of Rohillas and Shuja-ud-Daulah of Awadh.\n\n\nNajib-ud-Daulah and his Afghans:\n\n\n\nNajib had organised his regiments in imitation of the European system. They were armed with matchlock and swords, while the Matchlocks had bayonets attacked to them.\n\n\n\nThey were taught to draw and fire by order and were drilled in simple and useful maneuvers using Persian words of command.\n\n\n\nHe also had a contingent of sappers and war rockets.\n\n\nShuja-ud-Daulah of Awadh:\n\n\n\nShuja-ud-Daulah, had a detachment of Gosain and Purbiya Infantry and Qizilbash Cavalry. These troops were the envy of many. The Qizilbash cavalry were the horsemen, introduced by Nadir Shah and those who had stayed in India in service of Saadat Khan and his family.\n\n\n\nThe Purbiyas, are renowned even by the Europeans as the finest infantry in the subcontinent and were, in the words of European contemporaries, a match for the European infantry.\n\n\n\nA COMPARISON :\n\n\n\nThe fundamental difference between the forces was of firepower, discipline and maneuver.\n\n\n\nThe Marathas had become an imitation of the slow marching Mughals, and would spend months in their marches. They had heavy and extensive baggage trains, further encumbered by numerous non combatants.\n\n\n\nThe Durrani payed a premium on movement. He emphasised speed and mobility. His flexible light artillery was a step in this direction.\n\n\n\n\nThe Marathas had dithered in the realm of discipline as well. In one instance, Vithal Shivdeo, in 1758, was ordered to Patna by Raghunath Rao. Instead he looted the outskirts of Delhi. When this incident was brought to Bhau\'s attention, Antaji Mankeshwar said that Vithal was beyond reproach as he was backed by Malharrao Holkar.\n\n\n\nIn sharp contrast, when an incident of a few Abdali cavalrymen, who had disrupted Shuja-ud-Daulah\'s camp was brought to Ahmad Shah\'s attention, he ordered to have their "noses bored with arrows and strings passed through those holes. They were led in such condition to Shuja-ud-Daulah, who would punish them as he saw fit."\n\n\n\nOverall, the Marathas also lacked in firepower because of the obvious differences in the military traditions of the Durrani and the Marathas and also because the Maratha Artillery was still underdeveloped.\n\n\n\nHence, the Marathas, sadly, suffered from logistical, organisational and disciplinary problems. Here the Shah had an edge. This edge, would prove it\'s utility in the Battle.\n\n\n\n\nSource : Marathas and Panipat by Hari Ram Gupta\n\n\nMilitary System of The Marathas by Surendra Nath Sen\n\n\n\nFall of the Mughal Empire by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n(The next post will cover the Battle of Panipat itself.

      <li>Title::: 'My opinion on the farm bill'<br />Body: 'I will start by giving some background about the current situation before i talk about the 3 bills and their effects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs agriculture is vastly varied by state, each state has their own laws for trading farm produce. \n\nAPMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committees) is a marketing Committee operating under the state governments.\n\nThe APMC sets up markets locally known as "mandis" where farmers can sell their produce.\n\nIt ensures that the trade is fair for both sides and neither side is exploited in the process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, the government has introduced these 3 farm bills - \n\n1. The Farmers\' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 (FPTC Bill)\n\n2. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 (FAPAFS Bill)\n\n3. The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis enables the farmers are free to sell outside of APMC Mandis. \n\nNo market fee will be charged to the farmers when selling outside the mandis.\n\nThis will also reduce the transportation costs of the farmers as there are very few mandis and they are far apart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe farmers opposed this bill as they thought that they thought the mandis and MSP are being abolished.\n\nHowever, this is not true. The bill has nothing to do with the mandi system or the MSP. \n\nIt simply gives the farmers another option to sell the produce.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second bill allows retailers to enter into a contract with farmers also known as "contract farming". \n\nPrivate firms can enter into a contract with the farmers for the produce at a fixed quality And a guerantee of a minimum price.\n\nIt also prevents the firms from obtaining the land of farmers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, it may seem like these bills can only benefit the farmers. The farmers will have more freedom to choose whether to sell to private retailers or the APMC Mandis.\n\nTheoretically, this appears to be a positive for the farmers. \n\nBut this might not work out in their favour in reality. \n\nThe farmers are worried that due to there being no fee charged to the private firms, they will be able to sell the goods for cheaper as compared to the APMC Mandis which will result in the APMC Mandis running out of funds in the long run and being shut down eventually.\n\nThough both sides have reasonable arguments, i think the farmer\'s concern is completely rational.\n\nThough none of the meetings between the government and farmers so far have amounted to anything, i hope that some changes can be made to these bills to address the farmer\'s concern. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want a tldr, check out this post which explains it in brief [https://www.instagram.com/p/CJG24sUAMyl/?utm\\_source=ig\\_web\\_copy\\_link](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJG24sUAMyl/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)'<br />Author: 'Dreamkasper2001'  id: 'kmkuiz'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kmkuiz/my_opinion_on_the_farm_bill/</li>

Easy way to claim save taxes is to invest money into different provident funds available in India as it can be done in single click.\n\nIn this post, let‚Äôs discuss in detail about the different types of Provident Funds (PF) available in India.\n\n**What are the 3 types of Provident Funds?**\n\n1. Employee Provident Fund (EPF)\n2. Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF)\n3. Public Provident Fund (PPF)\n\n**What is Employee Provident Fund (EPF)?**\n\n* Most of you know about this already as almost all the employers use it. Both Employer and Employee should contribute 12% of Basic Salary into EPF (Govt employees have been moved into NPS, I'm not considering that aspect here).\n* At 8.5% interest (subject to revision), this is producing highest return among all the debt instruments with Sovereign guarantee - which means it provides 100% safety. You can check your EPFO Account/Passbook to ensure amount is credited properly every month &amp; interest is credited every year. You can use UAN Account number to verify the details.\n* Interest Earned is 100% Tax Free as well.\n* Returns Generated is re-invested automatically, so over the years effect of Compounding is significant.\n* Withdrawal is at Retirement but intermediate withdrawal is possible in specific cases (Building a house, Marriage, etc).\n* Also as per the new rules, 75% of corpus can be withdrawn if you remain unemployed for a month and remaining 25% can be withdrawn if you remain unemployed for 2 months.\n* All the contributions towards EPF is eligible for Tax Deduction under 80C with limit of 1.5L.\n* This is the best Debt (Fixed income generating) investment available in India at the moment.\n\n**What is Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF)?**\n\n* All the rules mentioned (regarding taxation, interest/returns, withdrawal, compounding) for EPF is applicable for VPF as well. There is only 1 difference which is on the contribution.\n* Contributing towards VPF is completely voluntary and you are allowed to decide the amount or % of contribution. Maximum contribution allowed is 100% of Basic Pay + DA as per your salary structure (remember 12% of basic is already going for EPF, so at the max you can mark VPF as 88%).\n* Account number used for VPF is also same as EPF, so contribution is very simple - no need for any documentation or account opening. You just have to inform your Payroll Team on the amount or % you want to invest every month. If your company provides a portal for salary structure, you can do it yourself as well. Most of the employers allows you to change this every month as well.\n* If you are risk averse but long term investor, this is the best way to utilize 80C component every year.\n\n**What is Public Provident Fund (PPF)?**\n\n* It is another Fixed income generating instrument started with the objective of giving financial security to employees from unorganized sector. But it is open for subscription for everyone - salaried, self- employed, business(wo)man. Even Rakesh Jhunjhunwala is using it.\n* It has Sovereign guarantee - which means it provides 100% safety.\n* You can contribute Maximum of 1.5L every year. You can do it in 1 shot or maximum of 12 installments.\n* Currently PPF generates 7.1% interest.\n* The interest received on the subscription is compounded. You earn interest on the interest earned.\n* All the amount (investment and returns generated) is exempt from tax.\n* Withdrawal is possible after 15 years, 50% withdrawal is allowed after 6 years.\n* If you don't want to withdraw at the end of 15 years, you can extend it in the block of 5 years. Most people opt for this.\n* Few people open PPF account and contribute just 500 Rupees (minimum) for first 10 years and from 11th year they contribute 1.5L each year and use it like a 5 year FD.\n\nSo, which is your favorite instrument for generating fixed income? Is it EPF, VPF or PPF? Are you contributing towards VPF, which is a great product by itself. If not why?\n\nFeel free to ask any questions, I'll be happy to help.\n\nAlso, let me know if you find this post useful. If it is useful, I will post more information on investment and taxation frequently in this sub if Mods permit."<br />Author: 'marketsecrets'  id: 'km6zyt'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/km6zyt/tax_savings_what_are_the_different_types_of/</li>

For Islam divides as inexorably as it binds. Islam is a close corporation and the distinction that it makes between Muslims and non-Muslims is a very real, very positive and very alienating distinction. The brotherhood of Islam is not the universal brotherhood of man. It is brotherhood of Muslims for Muslims only. There is a fraternity, but its benefit is confined to those within that corporation. For those who are outside the corporation, there is nothing but contempt and enmity. The second defect of Islam is that it is a system of social self-government and is incompatible with local self-government, because the allegiance of a Muslim does not rest on his domicile in the country which is his but on the faith to which he belongs. To the Muslim ibi bene ibi patria [Where it is well with me, there is my country] is unthinkable. Wherever there is the rule of Islam, there is his own country. In other words, Islam can never allow a true Muslim to adopt India as his motherland and regard a Hindu as his kith and kin.‚Äù'<br />Author: 'random_dude_176234'  id: 'klz9xp'<br />Score:31<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/klz9xp/ambedkar_on_hinduism_and_islam/</li>

Earlier this year, a black man named George Floyd was killed by cops in America and that resulted in almost the whole of internet burning with rage. Not just the goras of west but most of our own desi McCaulay putras were shouting at their highest decibels pleading for the justice of black people like George Floyd, Breyonna Taylor, Daniel Prude, etc.\n\nSimilarly, two white people were killed few months ago in France, one was in fact beheaded. Again, the whole of internet was crying and protesting as one (though perhaps less than the BLM movement). In both these instances, people actually took to the streets too.\n\nNow, on the day before christmas, a desi Baloch immigrant named Karima Baloch was [found murdered](https://techtudor.blogspot.com/2020/12/canada-couldnt-protect-her-slaying-of.html) in lake in Canada but this time there is eerie silence everywhere. Only a few youtubers like Tarek Fateh and Arif Aajakia are talking about it but the mainstream media is maintaining pin drop silence happily ignoring this large elephant in the room.\n\nI don\'t think this has anything to do with "Secularism hai" as someone commented few days ago, this is something else. Who gets to decide that a George Floyd will have a footage but not some desi from India or Pakistan? After all, this side did reciprocate the BLM movement despite having literally nothing to do with black-white racism. And this Baloch girl was a proper citizen of Canada. My instinct is that they\'d have raised havoc by now if a black or white citizen was killed instead. I think all of Asian diaspora living in western countries irrespective of their nationalities should raise voices of justice for this girl.'<br />Author: 'learned_cheetah'  id: 'klr2in'<br />Score:66<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/klr2in/desi_lives_matter_too/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[debate/discussion] The right wing logic regarding Muslims/Islam seems a bit inconsistent to me'<br />Body: 'Let me start by saying I consider myself a right winger. I am not a Hindutvadi, but I still consider myself right of the spectrum (and of course, my opposition to Indian Left Libs). Even though I know about the history of our country and its relation with Muslims and Islam I find the attitude of right wingers towards Muslims quite unjustified. I am aware that this sub is mostly right wingers and therefore, hope to have a good discussion about this.\n\nThe very common argument that I find all over the place when it comes to right wing\'s opposition to Islam is the text Qu\'ran. It is violent and has intolerant verses about us \'kafirs\' and that is why right wing thinks they are incompatible with our culture. Now, theoretically this argument has some logic to it. But it doesn\'t hold, if I assume two important things:\n\n1. The Right Wing in India supports Israel\n2. Right Wingers condemn the killing of Jews\n\nAssuming the above two, the "Qu\'ran is violent" stop making much sense. Have you ever read the Old Testament? Qu\'ran seems to bear the same tone and theme as that of the Old testament. Same narcissistic violent God, same kind of authoritarianism, same kind of attitude towards pork, same killing of adulterers, same intolerance of heretics, same intolerance of idol worship, etc. If Qu\'ran is violent and therefore makes Muslims violent is true, then Jews should be extremely violent too, isn\'t it? And by your logic, your attitude towards Jews and Muslims should be the same. But, it isn\'t. It seems you guys have a strange double standard when it comes to Muslims.\n\nSee, I understand the hatred towards Islam since they invaded us and split our country into 3 pieces (and now the Kashmir controversy). But the attitude that therefore 150 million Muslims are bad and they should be reconverted because their ancestors were Hindus or that they should always be seen in eyes of suspicion doesn\'t seem appropriate to me. Do you think it was justified what Hitler did to Jews because their \'book says so\'? You might object that "no, we aren\'t planning on killing Muslims". Ya but you don\'t seem to be treating Muslims that generously. Don\'t lie to yourself, this sub and other right wing forums are filled with instances of Muslims committing crimes trying to portray the whole group as some kind of a villain. In case you say "We are doing that because the Left doesn\'t report them", well, the comment section seems to say otherwise. Be honest, the comment section is filled with hatred and utter generalizations of Muslims based on the Qu\'ran and the news. Its like watching Leftist news like The Wire taking an instance of casteism and ranting about how India is "brahmanical patriarchy" and stuff. By your logic, even if Hitler shouldn\'t have killed them, he should have tried to convert them to Christianity, treat them as different, and spread hatred and gross generalizations against them because "their scriptures are bad". \n\nFeel free to criticize my argument. I know the  quality of arguments in this sub and know abuses are gonna rain here. I won\'t stop you but remember to at least provide a valid argument.'<br />Author: 'IdiotNoOne'  id: 'klqr5w'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/klqr5w/debatediscussion_the_right_wing_logic_regarding/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Alert: Racist propaganda against Indians spread by organised Pakistani subreddit brigades on Reddit'<br />Body: 'Before I begin, help yourselves by looking at my previous post on [why r|Pakistan creates so many fake accounts and larpers](https://www.removeddit.com/r/indiadiscussion/comments/grz54r/pakistani_larper_and_propagandist_fashbasher1_is/) as a refresher to better understand the issue I\'m going to discuss in this post. You may notice that it has been removed even after receiving 200+ upvotes as it was mass-reported by *you-know-who* but hopefully you\'ll know exactly *who*, by the end of this post.\n\nSome may have known this for a while but this one is for those who aren\'t aware. **Ex-moderator of r|Pakistan, BillBatori, who [LARPed as an Indian Sikh under the alt TylerGladd](https://imgur.com/n95g62c) ([link](https://www.removeddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/arinqx/_/egnucfj/)), has been tacitly restored as a mod by the other r|Pakistan mods through his new alt, ZakoottaJinn.** \n\n Both accounts have almost identical writing styles and post the same type of content, i.e. pro-Pakistani, left-leaning/secularist (for a Pakistani), anti-Indian propaganda (compare their histories on camas). It\'s evident that this account is solely built to propagate an agenda. Add to the fact that he was made mod just shortly after the creation of his account, almost too suddenly for a fresh account. This implies that **the other r|pakistan mods know that he is BillBatori, reinstated him as a mod, and unspokenly condone that their subreddits makes fake accounts to deceptively influence Reddit**. I will cover this in detail through the rest of the post.\n\n* **BillBatori=ZakoottaJinn: an open secret that cannot be buried completely**\n\n Displeased by his didactic mod behaviour and for being supposedly too liberal,  this r|chutyapa (which is r|Pakistan in its rawest, most jingoistic and vitriolic form) user calls out ZakoottaJinn for his Sikh LARP with receipts. \n\n &gt; ["Honestly this guy just uses the subreddit for his own agenda to push and then pretends like he is above it all. Used to be BillBatori but he deleted his account after his sikh LARP was discovered and then made a new account which his mod buddies reinstated"](https://imgur.com/K6jQ4K3) + [link](https://np.reddit.com/r/chutyapa/comments/g9u3fq/who_are_the_mods_of_rpakistan_indians_disguised/fovuh59/)\n\n ZakoottaJinn gets teased for being a "wannabe sardar jee" (a Sikh) on r|Pakistan. Comment gets deleted.\n \n &gt; ["Well considering your wannabe Sardar jee traits youd fit right in"](https://imgur.com/M00gKTI) + [link](https://www.removeddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/hf30e5/_/fvvod5b/)\n\n ZakoottaJinn restarts his quest to influence r|ACBDesis by lambasting Indians. Gets recognised by me and called out. Panic-deletes his own comment and hasn\'t appeared on that sub since.\n\n &gt; "This sub in a nutshell lol"\n &gt;&gt; ["Go back BillBatori"](https://imgur.com/xcBrTs3) + [link](https://www.removeddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/fx7kh8/pakistani_culture/fmsyub4/)\n\n Another r|chutyapa calls out BillBatori for his Sikh LARP. Pakistani hivemind ridicules him in return.\n \n &gt; ["He\'s pakistani you smartarses. He larped as a sikh on the other subs with his alt but he\'s still one of our own."](https://imgur.com/Sp6GayE) + [link](https://www.removeddit.com/r/chutyapa/comments/biy48d/did_you_ever_hear_the_tragedy_of_billbatori_the/em7glwj/)\n\n* **But what is perhaps the most undeniable proof that BillBatori and ZakoottaJinn are the same person?**\n\n The usernames BillBatori and ZakoottaJinn are both **characters from a 1990\'s Pakistani children\'s show** called *[Ainak Wala Jin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainak_Wala_Jin#Cast)* (Bill Batori and Zakoota Jin). Yeap, this guy named both his original account and alt after the same exact Pakistani kids show that he probably watched as a kid. **This is not and cannot be a coincidence**.\n\n--- \nNow, let\'s cover the original BillBatori expose and its aftermath. Obviously, it was too compromising and outright embarrassing for a mod of a national subreddit with 60k subscribers to be caught in such a manner, so the BillBatori/TylerGladd accounts were wiped clean (but not deleted).\n\n* **The response of r|Pakistan on this? Plausible deniability.** \n\n Well...there wasn\'t any acknowledgement that this even happened; not on their main subreddit, that is.\n\n Here is the responses of r|Pakistan and r|chutyapa mods on the thread where BillBatori was exposed:\n\n &gt; ["Holy shit hahaha. We just removed him from modship at r/Pakistan, thanks for bringing this to light. **Some people have way too much time on their hands...**"](https://imgur.com/2M3TxPl) + [link](https://np.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/as4pxf/turns_out_one_of_the_sikh_regulars_was_actually/egrtckf/)\n\n &gt; ["As we can see here today, the truth came out in regards to Billbatori as well...**Not all of us in the diaspora care about the politics back in Pakistan and India**, some just want healthy lighthearted conversations with other fellow confused Desis...Why can\'t we all just be friends?"](https://imgur.com/5z3AkDQ) + [link](https://np.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/as4pxf/turns_out_one_of_the_sikh_regulars_was_actually/egt8cuk/?context=10000)\n\n* **Lies become truth; a Pakistani LARPer becomes an Indian** \n\n They act like this was a surprise to the r|Pakistan mods, who wipe their hands clean off of this lone wolf\'s mistake and graciously settle the matter by removing BillBatori as a mod. Note that they makes these comments on r|ABCDesis, a sub consisting of the Desi diaspora. [However, to their own fellow Pakistanis on Islamofacist sub r|chutyapa, they sell a different story and insinuate that BillBatori was in fact an *Indian larping as a Pakistani*](https://imgur.com/rkdxa3q) + [link](https://np.reddit.com/r/chutyapa/comments/biy48d/did_you_ever_hear_the_tragedy_of_billbatori_the/). \n\n As you can see in the preceding thread, other r|Pakistani mods like step in to confirm this new fabrication: \n\n &gt; ["The mods of r/Pakistan are \\(supposed to be\\) Pakistani. If we find out that isn\'t the case \\(as with Bill\\) we will take prompt action."](https://imgur.com/LkbSAMh) + [link](https://removeddit.com/r/chutyapa/comments/biy48d/_/em8og9j/)\n\n This is a literal case of Orwell\'s 1984 *doublethink*: the reality that BillBatori was a Pakistani larping as an Indian Sikh to spread anti-Indian rhetoric is denied and instead, the reality is reversed and a new clearly false statement, that he was an Indian larping as a Pakistani, is touted. To the r|Pakistan mods, the facts that BillBatori was a veteran mod of r|Pakistan for several years plus that [he spread anti-Indian rhetoric](https://imgur.com/mml8nsF) [(link)](http://removeddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/arml4v/_/egoe30l) is both irrelevant and ignored; they must protect and sell their version of reality, that he was not Pakistani, even if it\'s totally contradictory to reality. [Comments that point out said contradiction are silenced, like this user here who was unwilling to accept khanartiste\'s narrative](https://imgur.com/Sp6GayE) [(link)](https://removeddit.com/r/chutyapa/comments/biy48d/_/em7glwj/)\n\n* **r|Pakistan mods is an exclusive boys club. Only way to get in, is by being in** \n\n I will keep this section short as it is a whole different can of worms but tl;dr: **r|pakistan/r|chutyapa mods are an in-group of select few users who control all subs on Reddit that are related to or have benefit to promoting Pakistani interests. They all operate with each other\'s knowledge, working together on social media outside of Reddit like Telegram, and rarely let an outsider into their ranks to protect their ulterior motives**. You can see this by viewing the other subreddits they mod: you will find they all mod the same other subs that all kowtow the same pro-Pakistani/anti-Indian sentiment. This is consistent with the promotion of the fresh account ZakoottaJinn to mod, as the other mods were well aware that he was BillBatori.\n\n Remember when BillBatori was exposed and the r|Pakistan mods acted as if they were shocked? Here is a cursory glimpse as to the familiarity that the mods all shared such as sharing their personal face pics, and how they functioned on external social platforms:\n\n [1](https://imgur.com/RJie55P) [linka](https://www.removeddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/5mclcu/_/dc3lvcr/) [linkb](https://np.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/5mclcu/rpakistan_what_do_you_look_like/) +\n [2](https://imgur.com/h6CVtNY) [link](https://np.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/6h19xm/what_are_the_latest_trends_in_shalwar_qameez_and/div2dok/?context=10000) +\n[3](https://imgur.com/aBpIIsJ) [link](https://www.removeddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/5mclcu/_/dc2xgxx/)\n\n---\n**What does this mean?**\n\nOne can draw a parallel between the Pakistani subreddit\'s denial of publicly acknowledging that it supports and operates troll accounts at the moderator level, and the actual Pakistani state\'s denial of publicly acknowledging that it supports and operates terrorists against its neighbouring countries at the national level. It\'s almost poetic, just how accurately the subreddit acts as a microcosm of its namesake\'s infamous duplicitous nature.\n\nIt is evident that r|Pakistan is subreddit that is deliberately controlled and manipulated by a select few, namely its mods, by cleansing the subreddit of content critical of Pakistan/promoting content that makes the country appear positive, and through fake accounts that LARP as Indians/non-Muslims to justify Pakistan\'s pro-military, anti-Indian stance. **They do this not just to steer the narrative of its own subreddit and radicalise the local population into that of a jingoistic, extremist pro-Pakistani, anti-Indian slant, but to also influence other subreddits and Reddit as a whole to adopt its anti-Indian and to a degree, Hinduphobic, sentiment by disseminating propaganda content and subversive narratives.**'<br />Author: 'stopthelarp'  id: 'klpopq'<br />Score:28<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/klpopq/alert_racist_propaganda_against_indians_spread_by/</li>

It was said that the INC was started by Viceroy Lord Dufferin with the help of an ex Civil Services member as a ‚ÄúSafety Valve‚Äù against the popular discontent.  \nThe following arguments were put forward to the safety valve theory:  \nA O Hume and other British thought that\xa0the educated Indians may become leaders of the Indian public and organize a rebellion against the government. So if the Government itself provides them a platform to raise their voice, it may be possible to stop such nuisance.  \nA O Hume was a retired British Civil Servant and he had a series of meetings with Lord Dufferin, the Viceroy.  \nHe also lobbied with some other people such as\xa0Sir James Caird, Lord Ripon, John Bright etc.  \nA large number of British in India such as Sir William Wedderburn, George Yule,Charles Bradlaugh etc. \xa0supported AO Hume.  \nThis theory has been discarded now. But still, the contribution of British cannot be disregarded in creation of first all India political front in which majority of the people were Hindus. The Muslims took congress negatively in the beginning but there were leaders such as Badruddin Taybji who were active leaders. The contribution of British in foundation of this organization was accepted and verbalized by Gopal Krishna Gokhle in 1913 as follows:  \n‚ÄúNo Indian could have started the Indian National Congress‚Ä¶if an Indian had come forward to start such a movement embracing all Indians, the officials in India would not have allowed the movement to come into existence. If the founder of the Congress had not been an Englishman and a distinguished ex-official, such was the distrust of political agitation in those days that the authorities would have at once found some way or the other to suppress the movement‚Äù\n\n1659 ‚Äì The Marathas defeat the Adilshahi forces in the [Battle of Kolhapur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kolhapur).\n\n&gt;The victory at Battle of Kolhapur and the conquest of Vishalgarh, gave Shivaji a decisive edge, as he began to occupy more and more of Adilshahi territory.

      <li>Title::: 'Do you think that peace with Pakistan is possible?'<br />Body: "This age old question has troubled our country greatly. However, I still feel pessimistic about it.\n\n&gt; India has tried peaceful relations with Pakistan. It started with the gesture of returning all land that India had captured in the 1965 war(THREE times more land India had in control then). However, we lost a great Prime Minister then and no solution.\nWe tried again under successive regimes. For eg, Vajpayee did the Lahore Bus Yatra and got Kargil in return. He later invited Musharraf to Agra and got the Parliament attacks.\n\n&gt; Pakistan's policy of *bleeding India by thousand cuts*. It was under this policy that they supported the Kashmir insurgency in particular and the various terror attacks undertaken by groups funded by them in general.\n\n&gt; There is no leadership to negotiate with. This is the biggest factor. No civilian govt. in Pakistan has completed its five year term. Military dictators like Ayub Khan(in the 60s), Zia ul Haq and Yahya Khan compromise the process. What makes it harder is the fact that even these dictators don't have pure power. They are either soon overthrown and a new civilian govt. starts a different policy or a new coup happens. Where exactly the power centre lies between the PM, ISI and military is unknown. For eg, when Kargil war started, Indian PM Vajpayee phoned his counterpart Nawaz Sharif. However, the later was  astonished to know about it and claimed he had no idea(it was most likely the doing of then chief Musharraf). Sharif was soon removed from power and is in exile(and hence, all peace overtures with him went in vain). Same went for Musharraf; he was leader for some time but was soon deposed and consequently, any peace talks with him went down the drain.\nFrom my POV, peace with China is much easier to achieve since they atleast have a proper power center to deal with.\n\n&gt; *Ghazwa e Hind* : Many Islamic fanatics dream of conquering India once again and sadly Pakistan has tons of such people. This increasing Islamisation of Pakistan was done in the 70s under Zia and it has contributed to the rise of anti India sentiment.\n\n\nI wish to know what you folks think.

While he was more ruthless in collecting Jizya.\n\nThe **historian Barani** who was contemporary to the above Tughlaq rulers, was indignant at *\'allowing all possible freedom to the infidels\'* in exchange of *\'a few tankas by way of Jizya.\'*\n\nHe further laments:\n\n&gt;How could the true religion get the upper hand over other religions and how could the emblems of Islam be held high?  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...How will the true faith prevail if rulers allow the infidels to keep their temples, adorn their idols and to make merry during their festivals with the beating of drums and *dhols*, singing and dancing?\'\n\n **\'Afif, another \'great historian\'** of the time writes that *\'through God‚Äôs grace the destruction of the infidels has achieved remarkable success.\'*\n\nMajumdar comments:\n\n&gt;If a learned historian and a distinguished Muslim felt no scruple in openly expressing such views in writing... one can well understand why the gulf between the Hindus and the Muslims could never be bridged."\n\n# #2. Muslims rulers had many Hindus at higher posts\n\nMajumdar writes:\n\n&gt;With a few exceptions here and there, almost all the high offices were bestowed upon the Muslims, whether Indian or foreign. It is interesting to note that many Muslim noblemen or adventurers, coming from Iran or Turan, were immediately appointed to posts of honor, dignity and importance in a Muslim court, which were practically barred to the Hindus.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Bahmani court was, for long, the scene of rivalry between the foreign and the indigenous Muslim, but the Hindus had no place there. The Muslim politicians and writers of the period took for granted that the *natural distinction was between Muslims and Hindus, and not between Indians and foreigners.* The State and society were divided horizontally and not vertically \n\n# #3. Razing of temples out of political considerations\n\nWriting of  **Ala-ud-din Khalji\'s (1296-1316) campaign in Gujarat**, the then historian **Wassaf** writes that:\n\n&gt;The vein of the zeal of religion beat high for the *subjection of infidelity and destruction of idols.* With a view to holy war, and not for the lust of conquest, he enlisted about 14,000 cavalry and 20,000 infantry  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;. . . The Muhammadan forces began to kill and slaughter, on the right and on the left unmercifully, *throughout the impure land, for the sake of Islam*, and blood flowed in torrents.   \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;. . . They took captive a great number of handsome and elegant *maidens***,** *amounting to 20,000, and children of both sexes*, more than pen can enumerate...  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Many temples were deserted and the idols were broken and trodden under foot, the largest of which was one called *Somnath*. The *fragments* were conveyed to Delhi, and the *entrance of the Jami‚Äô Masjid was paved with them,* that people might remember and talk of this brilliant victory.\n\nAnother Muslim historian writes of **Sikandar Lodi (1489-1517)** that\n\n&gt;He was so zealous a Musalman that he entirely ruined the shrines of Mathura, the mine of heathenism, and turned their principal Hindu places of worship into caravanserais and colleges. *Their stone images were given to the butchers to serve them as meat-weights***,** and all the Hindus in Mathura were strictly prohibited from shaving their heads and beards, and performing their ablutions . . .  Every city thus conformed as he desired to the customs of Islam.\n\nNear the eastern gateway of the famous **Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque, Ibn Batutah** **found** \'two very big idols of copper connected together by stones. Every one who comes in and goes out of the mosque treads over them.\'\n\nThus comments Majumdar that "It would be idle to deny the fact that the spirit with which the military campaigns were undertaken was often as much political as religious, i.e. anti-Hindu."\n\n# #4. Hindu women under Muslim rule\n\nThere are several references to Hindu female captives of the highest rank being accorded the most humiliating treatment. \n\nConsider the account of Ibn Batutah.\n\nHe was a Muslim traveler from Africa who visited India in 14th cen during the reign of Muhammad Bin Tughlaq.\n\nIn his travelogue, he writes about an Eid ceremony at Sultan\'s palace in Delhi:\n\n&gt; Then enter the musicians, the first batch being the daughters of the infidel rajas -- Hindus -- captured in war that year. They sing and dance, and the Sultan gives them away to the amirs and *a\'izza*. Then come the other daughters of the infidels who sing and dance; and the Sultan gives them away to his brothers, his relations, his brothers-in-law and the maliks‚Äô sons.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n. . . At that time there arrived in Delhi some female infidel captives, ten of whom the wazir sent to me. I gave one of these to the man who brought them to me, but he was not satisfied. My companions took three young girls, and I do not know what happened to the rest‚Äù \n\n**#5. The Hindu-Muslim harmony**\n\nVidyapati, the famous Mithila poet of 15th cen, writes: \n\n&gt;The Turks force the Hindus to work without pay, place the leg of the dead cow on the heads of Brahmanas, lick the sandalwood mark on their foreheads, tear off their sacred thread, break temples and build mosques in their place, abuse the Hindus and assault them. \n\nDuring the reign of **Husain Shah (1493-1519) in Bengal**, considered a very liberal ruler, the contemporary writer **Isana Nagara** has this to say about the condition of Hindus: \n\n&gt; \\[Muslims\\] throw into fire Srimad Bhagavat and other holy scriptures, forcibly take away the conchshell and bell of the Brahmanas (two necessary articles of worship), and lick the sandal paints on their bodies. They urinate like dogs on the sacred Tulasi plant, and deliberately pass faeces in the Hindu temples. They throw water from their mouths on the Hindus engaged in worship, and harass the Hindu saints as if they were so many lunatics let large. \n\nFrom ***Chaitanya-mangala*** **of Jayananda**:\n\n&gt;If a conchshell is heard to blow in any house, its owner is made to forfeit his wealth, caste and even life . . . The bathing in the Ganga is prohibited.\n\nMajumdar comments that:\n\n&gt;\\[Hindus\\] had to live in perpetual dread of the religious bigotry and intolerance of the Muslims during the rule of even the most enlightened Muslim Sultan of Bengal. No wonder that many Hindus embraced Islam to get rid of this ignominious fate.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Duarte Barbosa who visited India during the reign of Husain Shah observes with reference to Bengal: ‚ÄúThe Heathens of these parts daily become Moors to gain the favor of their rulers‚Äù \n\n`***`\n\nReading all this has been very sobering. At once the heart goes out to our ancestors who had to suffer such indignities and horrors. But it\'s also a tale of their tenacity that even then they held steadfastly to their faith.\n\nAt the same time, the way that the contemporary historians have cheated us with their bigoted narratives is a sheer crime.\n\nOn the **responsibility of historians**, the **novelist SL Bhyrappa** has written that:\n\n&gt;Anybody who embarks upon writing a historical work essentially needs to conduct concrete research to support even the tiniest detail. The author‚Äôs responsibility is towards the historical truth of the subject on which his/her work is based. When truth and beauty are put on a scale, the writer‚Äôs fidelity must invariably be in favour of the truth. An author doesn‚Äôt have the moral right to violate truth and take refuge in the claim that he/she is only a creative artist.\n\nMost Indian historians made fidelity to a political party, in exchange of the patronage received, their distinguishing persona. And it would have been humorous had they not been historians.\n\n [History and Culture of the Indian People, Volume 06,The Delhi Sultanate : R. C.

      <li>Title::: 'Protesting Farmers in Delhi borders are behaving childishly.'<br />Body: 'I understand you guys don\'t like the bills and want it removed. I understand it\'s your democratic right to protest against government. I understand it\'s somehow not good for you people. But why block the roads and highways. It\'s also democratic right of people to move around. These Farmers are blocking the lifeline of logistics of our country. The effects of the protest are also showing up. India is losing 3500 crores daily due to Delhi blockade.\n\nWhy not go protesting in empty maidan or someplace else. It\'s like these guys are trying to intentionally crumble the nation. The already ailing economy will be die if these continues. \n\nThe person who suffers the most are common people of Delhi. Think about it for a second , you wake up early to go to office. You get ready and drive only to find that there\'s 12 km (last time I checked) long traffic jam and you\'ll be late for office. And you\'ll be late for reaching home too. It takes a mental toll on person to go through this everyday. This is just the surface. The ambulances are getting stuck in traffic jam and have to take other way due to protestors (although they claim they\'re letting emergency services through but I doubt it) . \n\nIt now looks like they\'re celebrating holidays on highway and roads. (Having massage saloons , eating pizza , bringing out their Mercedes) . It\'s ironic to call them "gareeb kissan" after seeing this. The far left recently put demands citing farmer protest that Sharjeel Imam be released. If this news is true we know how sincere the protests are and what\'s their motive.\n\nThe kissan protests in my opinion have exposed how "gareeb" these kissan are (while owning BMWs and Mercedes). They were first protesting for MSP guarantee by government (MSP has never been guaranteed by previous governments). The government at end agreed to give and implement MSP but now they want the government to withdraw the 3 farm bills. It\'s like they don\'t want to go back. \nIf Modi agrees to withdraw farm rules , then I\'ll be disappointed in him.\n\n\nMy idea : the government should give them a big maidan (or big ground) in Delhi to protest. If they don\'t agree then use force. If protesting is their right , then they\'re infringing on people\'s right to free movement. The protest should be done such that there\'s no disturbance to non protesting people especially when government is always ready for debate and discussion\n\nhttps://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/farmers-protest-resulting-in-losses-of-rs-3500-crore-everydayassocham/story/424952.html'<br />Author: 'lantern552240'  id: 'kkft1h'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kkft1h/protesting_farmers_in_delhi_borders_are_behaving/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'We Westerners must stop demonising India'<br />Body: 'To make this very clear, I am a very liberal, secular and progressive gay man.  \nSo you would probably think that I am here to insult India, its culture, people and government, but you are wrong if you think that.  \n\n\nThis post is simple, I want to apologise on behalf of many Westerners who are tired of seeing India being demonised in our extremely biased media and political discourse.  \n\n\nIf you follow Western media (which you probably do given the huge influence that the USA and the UK still hold over much of the English-speaking world) then you\'ve noticed that there is a weird pattern in which muslims are constantly portrayed as innocent pious people who fall victims to hateful far-right groups, and whenever an islamic attack happens we just go on about how "NOT ALL MUSLIMS ARE THE SAME!!!" but with the same breath if anything happens in India we will start blaming Indian society and culture as a whole.  \n\n\nThis can of course be explained in a simple way.  \nOur media is full of distortions, manipulations and inaccuracies, and they wish to promote a certain vile agenda.  \n\n\nAs such people only receive a very negative image of India on TV and the newspapers and won\'t bother to investigate it themselves.  \n\n\nThis of course does not help at all when even many Indian media outlets also join in on the India-bashing and constantly belittle and insult their own culture and motherland.  \n\n\nThe BBC could be used as a great example of anti-India bias, when reporting on the cases of love jihad, the BBC referred to this as a conspiracy theory without any evidence grounded in reality.  \nThis despite the many cases that have happened across both India and other countries of non-muslim women being seduced by muslim men and then expected to convert.  \n\n\nI am not saying there aren\'t any good muslims, but it seems that they are the exception rather than the rule.  \n\n\nIndia when shown through the lens of our media seems to be like an underdeveloped hateful hell hole where everybody lives miserably and is either getting raped or lynched.  \n\n\nThis despite the fact that in India minority groups have been growing, some top politicians in the BJP have shown support for LGBT rights, religious freedom in India is so tolerated that foreign governments and groups interfere in India\'s spiritual life, etc...  \n\n\nYou would ask yourselves, why doesn\'t our media treat countries like Pakistan the same way?  \nIn Pakistan gay men like me are either jailed or killed, the Hindu population has been declining rapidily every year (whilst the muslim population in India breeds like rabbits), and that sad excuse of a country was built to be an islamist nation ruled by islam, while India remains a secular country of sorts.  \n\n\nSo why do we ignore your dangerous and radical neighbour while attacking you?  \n\n\nIt\'s easy.  \n\n\n1) Anti-Hindu bias:  \n\\- Hindus are sadly viewed by most muslims and conservative christian groups as nothing more than a bunch of idolaters and crazy people.  \nThis reminds me of a muslim friend who once told me "Hindus are even dumber than Atheists" (so he thinks little of both Hindus and Atheists.. but Hindus go even lower).  \nHe went on to describe Hindus as crazy for worshiping "false idols" and that their religion "makes no sense", words that were echoed by a devout catholic friend of mine.  \n\n\nBecause you know, a prophet who kept sex slaves and married a child and the wife of his adopted son (he then disowned his son and banned adoptions), or a man who is the son of himself and died but then came back, clearly make a lot of sense.  \n\n\nDon\'t get me wrong, I am very secular myself so I do not pay much attention to religion, but I find it pathetic how people can defend their own religion a lot and claim it is perfect (in this case christianity and islam) while bashing with glee the faith of others (Hinduism).  \n\n\nIn my oppinion Hinduism even makes more sense than those 2 faiths!  \n\n\nThis is not an anedoctal anti-Hindu experience by the way.  \nThis is systemic.  \n\n\nIn my country of birth I received religious education besides normal secular education.  \nWe would have 1 class per week on catholic morals and such.  \n\n\nNow, the class did try to be balanced, but it was clearly not.  \n\n\nOur teacher once refered to Hinduism (when we were learning of world religions!) as this "Oh Hinduism is not a religion, it\'s just some sort of backwards paganism", he also mentioned how one of his neighbours converted to Hinduism, which he said "Oh it\'s a phase, these people just join whatever is popular at the time, she\'s just a bit crazy" (because you know, a white person believing in Hinduism means she\'s crazy, but Indians adopting christianity is a sign of civilisation).  \n\n\nSo this anti-Hindu bias is spread out even amongst people in a position of power and influence who mold young people\'s minds.  \n\n\n2) India is a democracy, therefore it is an easy target.  \n\n\nYou probably also noticed that our (and to some extent also your) media doesn\'t care so much about dictatorial regimes.  \n\n\nChina, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia and so on get a few mentions, but they are never as savagely bashed or pursuited as nations that are actually democratic and free, such as India, Israel, USA, France, Australia, etc...  \n\n\nThis is because they know that dictatorial regimes like China, Pakistan and so on just won\'t care at all about what they say!  \nThe media relies on views and clicks and attention in order to survive in the modern competitive world, so they try to get draw the audience of young woke "activists" whose idea of changing the world is dying their hair blue and going on the streets to protest about stuff that they don\'t even understand.  \n\n\nSo they use sensationalist headlines and give short and simple "reports" because they know these young woke "activists" are too dumb to read that much.  \n\n\nThese "activists" will then protest against democracies because they know their governments actually have to care about public image, hence they alway protest against India, Israel, France, USA, Australia, etc... but they will turn a blind eye to Pakistan, Palestine or China because they know they will get no reaction and can\'t go brag about it on social media.  \n\n\n3) Self-hatred in our education system.  \n\n\nThe education system both in India and in the Western World teaches us to hate ourselves!  \n\n\nFor many years Indians were told by so called intellectuals the the highest point in Indian History was being colonised by either the Mughals or the Brits.  \nYou are taught that your own native Indian culture is only so rich and beautiful thanks to muslim influence, this despite muslim countries being total sh tholes, you are told that all of your advancement you owe it to European colonisation, even though Indians highly contributed to Western mathematics, medicine and other sciences.  \nThankfully Modi is changing that and hopefully Indians will start appreciating their own culture, which is the oldest, uninterrupted culture still in existence!  \n\n\nWe in the West learn as well that we are nothing but barbarians who went on to invade the world and do horrors, this while ignoring the fact that basically everybody else in the world also committed attrocities at the time, and some do this even today!  \n\n\nAs a result, we have a huge number of muslim and other such migrants, who come from a nationalistic system where they are taught that their culture and History is perfect and that we Westerns owe them something because our ancestors did messed up stuff!  \n\n\nSo now we end up with highly entitled migrant wankers who none of us dare confront because we are scared of being called bigots!  \n\n\nHeck, the UK even allowed their own children to be raped just to not appear racist (please google: Rotterham sex abuse scandal).  \n\n\nSo left-wing woke idiots tend to view minorities as special and in need of protection (Except Hindu and apostate minorities for some weird reason, they just fetishise your culture for a bit while daring to try to define it for you), and the recent attempts by Indian society to move pass that and to instead treat everybody as equal goes against woke principals  \n\n\nBecause once they have nothing real to be outraged about they will have no choice but to either cease to exist or start making up falsehood to rant about.  \n\n\n4) Our journalists are not prepared for the real world.  \nOur journalists are usually upper middle-class idiots who studied only humanities and other social sciences and therefore understand nothing of reality.  \n\n\nTo make this clear I myself studied Humanities, however I clearly studied it right because I didn\'t become a woke activist.  \n\n\nIf you study humanities you are supposed to study different cultures and perspectives in order to understand them from a neutral perspective, no matter how heinous a certain culture might be.  \n\n\nSadly instead, our Humanist students have learned as I mentioned before, to hate some cultures and glorify others, to take some parts of History out of context and to downplay differences between peoples.  \n\n\nThey wish to create a new world instead of acknowledging our current one.  \nIf you wish to change the world you must first know how it works at the moment, if you can\'t do that because you view everything from an ideological perspective, as most of our journalists do, then all you can do is complain and cry.  \n\n\nIt\'s no wonder that even when Europe falls victim to islamic terrorism we still downplay the danger present in this community!  \n\n\nFinally, there are some things I want to say about India that I do criticise:  \n\n\n1) India is not really a secular country.  \n\n\nA real secular country would support a uniform law for all of its citizens (thankfully the BJP is fighting for this, too bad that Congress is in the way)  \n\n\nRight now as it stands, marriage, family and some personal laws are different depending on each person\'s religion.  \n\n\nThis makes no sense! Everyone in India should obey Indian law! One country, one law!  \nInstead muslims and christians get to seperate themselves from regular Indian society and still complain about the same country that has welcomed and tolerated them for thousands of years!  \n\n\nIn France there is only one law, one education system and one society, they are the best example of secularism in the world and India should really look up to their example.  \n\n\n2) The Caste System.  \n\n\nIt makes no sense that the people who oppose it the most are the ones that preserve it.  \nThe caste system also existen in Europe for many years, where we were divided into 3 Estates (Nobility, Clergy and People), this system only vanished (mostly) because we stopped talking about it.  \n\n\nInstead in India certain jobs, school placings and even government positions will be reserved for people from "lower" castes.  \n\n\nThe caste system in today\'s Indian society has almost no effect on the common people.  \nLet\'s face it, the modern world\'s biggest factor when it comes to discrimination is financial status, and nowadays you could find a rich Dalit and a poor Brahmin.  \n\n\nPeople should get a job or join a University based on their skills alone, not on any other "special" trait.  \nThe caste system will only disappear when people stop talking about it, and the fact that these quotas exist only reenforce this system and stigmatises entire segments of India\'s population.  \n\n\nAssistance and support should be based on NEED, not on caste.  \n\n\nI wish India the best, hope one day to visit this great country and I hope that in the future we can cooperate more.  \n\n\nI hope that you can forgive us for our biased and media and politicians, they do NOT represent us.  \nI love you, your culture and your nation.  \n\n\nYou will rise great, because your love and respect for your culture will guard you from the self-destruction that our nations to the West are committing.  \n\n\nSincerely,  \n\n\nA European Friend'<br />Author: 'EmmanuelDeLaRiviere'  id: 'kjjgom'<br />Score:309<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kjjgom/we_westerners_must_stop_demonising_india/</li>

The Vedic scriptures and Jain Aagams contain a lot of knowledge and were the important centres of astronomical research for ages.\n\n4 Key arguments of the Petitioners:\n\n1. During the time of the ruler Qutubuddin Aibak, the mosque was built by breaking the temples located in the Qutub-Minar complex. Qutubuddin Aibak could not completely demolish the temples, so some parts of it were torn down and made mosques from his material.\n2. The walls, pillars and ceilings of the existing complex have paintings and religious symbols of deities.

      <li>Title::: 'Ahmad Shah Abdali, The Prelude to Panipat'<br />Body: '(Here it is bois. I asked you guys to vote and it was a tie between those who wanted this post and those who didn\'t. So I\'ve decided to make this post today. This is the second last post before the analysis of the 3rd Battle of Panipat. Enjoy)\n\n\n\nAhmad Abdali, was born in the Sadozai clan of the Abdali tribe of Afghans in about 1722 CE. After having defeated the Russians and the Turks, Nadir Shah of Iran, had set out of Iran to punish the Afghans for their actions. During his invasions in 1732 CE, he captured two boys, brothers, Zulfiqar and Ahmad. Ahmad, distinguished himself in Nadir\'s service, quickly becoming a favourite and rose to the command of 3000 troopers in Nadir\'s personal guard. He was with Nadir Shah when Nadir invaded Delhi. It is said that Nizam-ul-mulk who was known to read faces, said when he saw Ahmad Abdali, that he would one day be a king. When Nadir Shah was assassinated by his own trusted advisors, Abdali, took Nadir\'s seal, the Koh-i-Noor, valuables and a Mughal princess who was married to Nadir\'s son. He left for Afghanistan and took his troopers and many other Afghans with him, who elected him as their leader. And so, upon a Throne of dirt, with a crown of strewn grass, Ahmad Abdali, was made Ahmad Shah Abdali of Afghanistan. The Abdalis styled him Durrani Padshah or Pearl Among Kings and called themselves henceforth, Durranis. \n\n\n\n\nHe had claimed for himself, the provinces of the Mughal Empire that Nadir Shah had conquered which included Qandahar, Kabul, Peshwar, Lahore, Sindh, Ghazni, Hazara, Kohat, Bannu, Derajay, Qalat and Chahar Mahal. \n\n\n\nHe began his conquests for these provinces by taking Sindh. The Mughals sent an army under Safdar Jung of Awadh, and Ishwari Sigh of Jaipur. In the Battle of Manupur, Ishwari Singh disgraced his Rajput name and pride, by fleeing the field in the face of enemy fire and left Safdar Jung to struggle alone. Here the Nawab of Awadh proved that he was a patriot once again, and fought the battle bravely, his Awadhi troops consisting largely of Brahmin and Rajputs in infantry and Irani Shia cavalry, defeated the Afghans. Yet, the Mughals failed to take advantage of victory and allowed Nadir to slip away.\n\n\n\nWe now skip a few years ahead, to discuss his fourth invasion of India. This invasion was at the invitation of Najib-ud-Daulah and the Mughal Emperor\'s wife, as they were offended by Imad-ul-Mulk and invited Abdali to suppress him. Therefore, he had the opportunity to do what he had always desired. In January 1757, he was in Ludhiana, with Imad chastised, his troops went plundering and sacking cities mercilessly. They dragged away men\'s wives and daughters, so cruelly, that a large number of them committed suicide. Hindus were ordered to paint their foreheads and were beaten for failing to do so.\n\n\n\nNajib-ud-Daulah joined his forces with Abdali and with about 100,000 troops, they set out on their expedition to suppress Surajmal who had refused to surrender in person. On this occasion, Surajmal\'s pride would cost him and innocent people alike. Jahan Khan and Najib-ud-Daulah were sent out with 20,000 troops each, and another 20,000 marched under Abdali. They planned to make the the festival of Holi, their time of attack, to inflict the greatest offences upon their enemy. So they set out on 27th of February and planned an expedition which would last till 6th of March. \n\n\n\n\nIn Bulandshahr, a general slaughter was ordered and according to an eye witness account of Ghulam Hasan Samin, "unnumbered dead bodies flooded the streets".\n\n\n\nAt Mathura, Jawahir Singh, Surajmal\'s son, opposed them with 10,000 men but after killing 8000 Afghans and losing 4000 Jats, he returned to Ballabhgard. Once again we have an eye witness account of Ghulam Hassan - " I saw a number Bairagi and Sanyasi huts by the edge of the stream. These are ascetics of the Hindu faith. In each hut lay a severed head, with the head of a cow tied to its mouth by a rope around it\'s neck."\n\n\n\nAt Ballabhgard, the fort was captured and Jawahir Singh escaped to Kumbher where Surajmal was. Ghulam Hassan once again gives his account -" Horsemen set out with 10-20 horses each at midnight. They return with plunder and women captives atop the plunder. Male captives carry baskets on their heads, which have bundles of severed heads in them. For each head the Prime Minister pays Rs.5. Then the male captives are beheaded and the women ravished, whose screams deafen the ears of civilised men."\n\n\n\nAt Brindaban Ghulam narrates "At one place, 200 children lay dead in a heap"\n\n\n\nAt Gokul, "4000 Naga Sadhus, fought the Abdalis and each side lost 2000 men." At the behest of Jugal Kishore,  an agent of the Bengal Viceroy, who assured the Shah that there were only beggars and Sadhus in Gokul, Gokul Nath temple and its people were saved.\n\n\n\nAt Brindaban, the Afghans had encamped by the Jamuna, downstream from Brindaban. The water was choked due to dead bodies and the polluted water caused cholera in the Afghan camp and hence the Afghans retreated.\n\n\n\n\nOn his return, he sacked Delhi, took a 16 year old Mughal princess and her sister as wives. Along with 16 other women from the imperial harem.\n\n\n\n\nBefore returning to Afghanistan, he conquered Sarhind in 1757 and finally went back.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1758, Adina Beg Khan, Mughal Governor of Jalandhar Doab, allied with the Sikhs to push the Afghans out of Punjab. He then realised that soon the Durrani would invade once more and invited, the Marathas who were encamped at Delhi. Raghunath Rao accepted the offer and set out with a grand army. \n\n\n\n\n\nAnd hence, Raghunath Rao arrived to liberate Punjab and the west with Malharrao Holkar, Sakharam Bapu, Manaji Paygude, Gangadhar Bajirao, Hari Raghunath Bhide, Bapuji Trimbak, Renako Anaji, Gopalrao Ganesh Barve, Rayaji Sahdev, Tukoji Scindia, Narsoji Pandit, Khandoji Kadam and Vithal Shivdeo, assaulted any and all Afghans they encountered between Delhi and Attock. They took back Peshwar, Multan, Sarhind, Punjab and Lahore. Glorious celebrations were held and nazars were offered to Raghunath Rao. Finally, the stage was set, for the Third Battle of Panipat. Soon, Najib-ud-Daulah would invite Abdali, to invade once more, for loot and land. Dattaji Scindia, would be slain and the great battle would be fought.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next post shall be my last in this series. Thanks for staying tuned and wait until I finish with the next one. I know I could make more posts by providing more and more context, but that would be too exhaustive and I\'m very eager to cover the Battle itself. \n\n\n\n\n\nSources : "Marathas and Panipat" by Hari Ram Gupta\n\n\n\n"Ahmad Shah Abdali in India, Islamic Culture" and "Fall of Mughal Empire Vol I and II"by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n\n\n" History of The Jats" by K.R Qanungo\n\n\n\n"Tarikh-e-Ahmad Shah" by Imad-ul-din-al-Husaini'<br />Author: 'PushyamitraShunga1st'  id: 'kjbphd'<br />Score:35<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kjbphd/ahmad_shah_abdali_the_prelude_to_panipat/</li>

      <li>Title::: "A response to r/Nepal's post on Nepal India friendship"<br />Body: '\n&gt;Dear Friends of India,Greetings from your friend in Nepal.Although the world has often assumed Nepal as India\'s small brother, I would like to address you as my friend. Irrespective of Nepal possessing an infinitesimal fraction of land, human resources, economy, and development than India possesses, we, a citizen of Nepal, would still like to call you as a friend.\nWe have seen no other friends like you. Let me be more specific. No two countries in the world share so much of the closeness that India and Nepal do. We share a similar culture and tradition. \n\nOk. \n\n&gt;We have been traveling borderless with no passport needed ever since the Sugauli treaty\'s establishment in 1816, and our economy depends on each other. \n\nOur economies are intertwined but not dependent. Indian remittances from Nepal are only a fraction of the total remittances and of thr overall economy. Compare this to Nepali remittances from India. \n\nThe Indian economy is not reliant on Nepal owing to its size. The Nepali economy is reliant on India because of Nepal\'s geography. \n\n&gt;We see so much of us in you. You are our neighbor, and we love you.We, as a Nepalese, can never forget your generosity.I am personally indebted to India because I have spent my valuable life with you, including my college days. Today, in this letter, I would like to write not about the personal side.Let me begin this letter with a thank you note. I am overwhelmed by India‚Äôs support and rescue during the disastrous earthquake in April 2015. We, as Nepalese, will not forget your generosity.Those were one of the golden periods of our friendship. Eight months before the earthquake, India‚Äôs newly appointed Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, addressed Nepal\'s parliament. His speech was applauded and accepted by the whole nation, irrespective of their ethnicity and political ideology. This was the first instance that any foreign representative had the privilege of standing and speaking from Nepal\'s parliament house.\n\nOk. \n\n&gt;It‚Äôs not that the outrage in Nepal against India was null before 2015. There were many, but in those earlier issues, however big they may, our anger waves were concentrated towards our political leaders who compromised national interests.\n\n\nThere was a mini riot over some obnoxious comment made by Hrithik Roshan (came out to be false). The riot was aided by a Kashmir Origin media baron close to the D Company \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamim_Shah\n\nChanneling funds for extremists in Kashmir, he had become a headache. \n\nThing being,Nepal has always had an anti India sentiment. \n\n&gt;In only five years, how we see each other has somersaulted. I am afraid the distance between our friendship is increasing, which is an enormous concern for me. The current understanding of the border dispute has grown outrages on both sides of the border. While Nepalese have united for this issue, I observe that India\'s people have contradicting views differentiated by their political beliefs. I do not want to put my statement on who is right, Nepal, or India, but I want to let you know that most of the statement in your outrage has been discussed in baseless claims with no historical research.It concerns me because I do not want to lose you. As a friend of yours, I would like to put my arguments on what political steps might have generated a hard feeling among our country\'s people.I will include the following significant points in my letter.\n\n&gt;1. Blockade in Nepal\n\nThat is like blaming Nepal for the West Bengal gorkhaland movement. \n\n&gt;Road construction in disputed territories\n\nOur territories. \n\n&gt;India‚Äôs accusation of Nepal being a puppet to China\n\nHave you seen an ambassador dwelling on how a party should not split ? China\'s ambassador does that. If an ambassador has control over the ruling party, it is in charge of the country. \n \n&gt;India‚Äôs political interference in the last sixty years.\n\nYou have a problem with interference or with Indian interference  ? Does not seem to be the former since you are okay with other countries interfering in your country. \n\n&gt;India‚Äôs six-month-long Blockade of Nepal in 2015 was a nightmare.\n\nIt was not a blockade. \n\n&gt;Most of the citizens of Indian are still not aware of India‚Äôs unofficially sanctioned blockade, which followed a few months after the earthquake. In Nepal, a community and political party were unhappy with our new constitution, and they announced an indefinite strike in the southern part of Nepal. The government of India not only supported that strike but also executed it.\n\nTruck drivers were hesitant to go ahead because of the andolans. \n\n&gt;This was not the first instance Nepal had faced blockade from its neighbor. The 2015 blockade prevailed from all three sides of the country. None of the mainstream media from India reported it. Do you believe that we spent six months of a nightmare with a shortage of food, fuel, and other necessary items, including vital medicine and women‚Äôs sanitary napkin? Massive queues of customers for cooking fuel packed public vehicles, and those bursting electric transformers (because of excessive load) were a nightmare. This abnormal experience was a new interference in their life for residents below 35 years old as we hadn‚Äôt experienced 1989‚Äôs blockade.\n\nThe 1989 blockade was the result of Nepal buying anti aircraft guns from the Chinese. Nepal has two neighbors. It buys anti aircraft guns from one. Who do you think it was bought against  ? \n\n\n&gt;I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you also are unknown to those happenings. One of my close Indian friends said, ‚ÄúThere was no ever blockade to Nepal sanctioned by India.‚Äù He asked me to show some articles or references to prove it. I had no articles or links published from Indian media. Still, I showed him a Rajya Sabha (Legislative Upper house) video of Late Sushma Swaraj, Minister of Foreign Affairs (2014‚Äì2019), where she says such (2015) blockade had happened earlier (In 1989) too. My friend got to know that there was a blockade from the Indian side, but that couldn‚Äôt convince him how tough were daily Nepalese life for six months in 2015, mainly when the country was on the verge of recovering earthquake shock.\nThis blockade was a significant reason Nepal had to push itself towards China for alternate borders. Because of K. P. Sharma Oli‚Äôs (Prime Minister of Nepal, 2015‚Äì16) in the chair) nationalist stand against the blockade, he and his communist party won the landslide victory in 2017.\n\nSwaraj rendered to the disruption of supply lines. \n\n&gt;As a Nepal\'s general life, I wish no civilized community in the world ever experiences the blockade that we Nepalese have gone through.\nIndia constructed a road in the disputed territory.\n\nMongolia went through the same alleged cutting off of lines of communication. Was allegedly initiated by China. \n\n\n&gt;The part of Lipu lake, Kalapani, and Limpiyadhura is in the west northern part of Nepal. Sugauli treaty mentions that the eastern part of the Mahakali river decides Nepal‚Äôs western border. We understand that those India-Nepal disputed territories are strategically crucial for India. Still, it doesn‚Äôt mean that India can construct and inaugurate the road by ruling out any diplomatic discussions.\n\nThat is our territory. \n\n&gt;This construction raged a complete outrage in Nepal. It is a direct interference with the sovereignty of an independent nation.\nThe government of Nepal updated its map with those missing parts. Nepal pointed to this issue in 1960 and a few times more, but unfavorable political situation suppressed the voice, which has now taken an uglier turn. You might wonder why Nepal never issued its correct map till last year?\n\n&gt;The possibilities why Nepal took so long to release their map can be as follows.\nNepal didn‚Äôt have proper tools in the pre-internet era to make a map on its own.\n\nNepal published maps in the pre internet era.\n\n&gt;Nepal‚Äôs leader lured and silenced for their benefits (More detail in the coming sections).\nThe disputed land is not so densely populated, and the major.\n\nIn that case,how do we believe that they are not being lured and sushed now. \n\n&gt;India should realize that China has no role in the Nepal border‚Äôs stand.\n\nThis came on the heels of the India China standoff.  Not coincidence. Moreover, the mood of the r/Nepal club was perfectly summed in an anti India post. \n\n&gt;Nepal is not a puppet of China or India.\nFrom the critical situation of blockade until today, India has slammed Nepal into a puppet of China. Recently, the army chief statement hinting China‚Äôs hand in Nepal‚Äôs protest is an unacceptable attack on the freedom and independence of the Nepalese. In any of the cases, Nepal has to balance its relationship with both countries, and neither India nor China can be the one to force an independent state to overload its priority at one side.\n\nEver seen an ambassador meeting daily with the ruling party members ? \n\nRegardless you can not eat the cake and have it too. You have to choose a side. Nepal went on an anti India tirade. This damaged the official relations and the unofficial relations as well. \n\nIndians woke up to news of all sorts of crap. Covid in India is more dangerous. Ram was born in Nepal. India is following Sinha Meva Jayate. Diplomatically insensitive comments by the Nepali PM. \n\nEnded up creating a negative image of Nepal among Indians. \n\n&gt;While the Nepal mainstream political party Nepali Congress, a trusted ally of India, never mentioned the 2015 nightmare as ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs blockade,‚Äù the border issue brings all national parties to a single platform. All political leaders in Nepal have expressed their dissatisfaction and concern about bringing a nation united in this crisis.\n\n&gt;A few Indian media are falsely reporting the Nepal-China relationship. This propaganda is a mindset of many of my friends who think we are inclined to China. As a Nepal citizen, I would expect no one to direct us in what we do, and we not, but they keep accusing Nepal is a puppet of China.\n\nWhat exactly is the Chinese ambassador doing ? Not directing ? \n\n&gt;Nepal has its government chosen by people, and it is our interest in how we balance our relationship. Nepal is the puppet of neither China nor India.\nI retaliate once again; the India blockade in 2015 waked up Nepalese from our overdependence in India.\nHas India‚Äôs political interference outweighed its good deeds?\nIndia has been helping Nepal at every stage of its history. India‚Äôs job and scholarship schemes to Nepalese have benefited millions of families. However, India has played a dominant role, especially in shaping many governments of Nepal and changing for their personalized interest. They supported the Maoists movement, which led Nepal\'s domestic violence to rise for a decade. They have lured Nepal‚Äôs politicians for their interest. Their dominant role and strategy in shutting down valuable industries in the 1990‚Äì2000 era, which could have been a major development index, will always keep India on a darker side in the heart of Nepalese people. No document might be available to justify this claim, but this is a story every Nepalese will tell you.\nHad the Indian government implemented the right strategy for the development of this small Himalayan nation, had they focused on winning people\'s hearts rather than few opportunistic politicians, Indo-Nepal friendship would have been on a different level today.\n\nDo not blame us for your internal turmoil.  Your leaders came to India for support. \n\nSecondly, it is not as if Nepal has its share of follies. Nepal has continously sheltered alleged extremists. One of them ended up becoming a minister. \n\nhttps://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/how-an-exministers-son-runs-dcompanys-operations-from-a-remote-jail-in-nepal-ians-exclusive/1859823\n\nSecondly,we even had our plane hijacked from Nepal. \n\n\n&gt;Yes, my friend, your government interference. Nepalese have severely noticed Their strategy and unhealthy political support. Your television channel openly trends #ChinaUsesNepal; your former MEA secretary openly discusses on television that dissolving the government and putting their assets work for your country. And being blind to their propaganda, friends from India have their share of hate speech for Nepalese.\n\nHate speech ? Say it to the ones who are called Dhoti because they are brown.  \n\n.\n&gt;It is high time two governments discuss issues on the table, and we disregard all other negative thoughts, including the TV channel of republic and Times Now. \n\nAh,and while you continue hailing radio houses like these ? \n\nhttps://m.timesofindia.com/india/nepal-stations-play-anti-india-songs/articleshow/76488425.cms\n\n\n\n&gt;Let me clear you one thing. If I am asked to choose India and China as a close friend, I will choose India as my closest friend. I am sure the maximum percentage of people will also choose...But this choice of ours comes as free will and not with not any predefined condition, definitively not at this condition what our generation is facing. It is my individual choice and fundamental constitutional right to vote for the Socialist or Communist government. Neither you nor your government should be the one to interfere in our choices.\n\nAt this point, we do not even need your friendship. We can do only so much. Nepal matters from a security POV only. If Nepal already has a communist party which is perceived to be close to China (not only by us but by the west too), there is little we can do.\n\nThe sheltering of Pro Kashmir extremists in Nepal would hardly stop with a Pro China government in power. \n\nThe only antidote to this would be to seal the borders so that it can be better policed. As they say,good fences make good neighbours. \n\n\n&gt;Our hate game for each other benefits not of the country, so I see no advantage in arguing our agenda on a personal level. However, there can be healthy discussions at an individual level with the knowledge of the following checklist.\nThe treaties were signed throughout history.\nThe 2015 blockade effect to Nepal.\n\n&gt;Nepal is an independent nation and a puppet of neither China nor India.\n\nNepal by the unfortunate-ness of its geography will always assume a subservient role towards one country because the two neighbours are at logger heads. \n\nThis is not because of any inherent fault in Nepal but because its geography makes it difficult. The Chinese might sugar coat it with phrases such as "Equal friends" but that is only rhetoric.'<br />Author: 'treesisnicesoothing'  id: 'kj8ihf'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kj8ihf/a_response_to_rnepals_post_on_nepal_india/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The mighty myth of Sikhs saving Hinduism. The narrative of Sikhs coming to the aid of Hindus needs to be re-examined.'<br />Body: '&gt;‚ÄúTumhari quam ke liye khade na hote, tumhari ma behan biwi ke liye lade na hote, to tumhare waris kabhi bade na hote‚Äù (If we have not stood for your religion, if we have not stood for your mothers, sisters and wives, your children would‚Äôve never grown) said a fluffy face Sikh girl rhapsodically with laborious effort in an effort to sound savage ‚Äì in a short video message; which was later shared by the best selling author from the Sikh community, Harinder S Sikka on his Twitter account. The sonorously angry girl with a discernible supremacist tone and dramatically plain expression continued to add a very casual threat ‚Äì ‚ÄúAgar pata hota nazre humhi par hai to jis zameen ke taraf bad rahe ho, usi me gade na hote‚Äù (If it was known that your eyes are on us, then you would‚Äôve been buried in the same land towards which you‚Äôre heading to).\n\n&gt;Another one of the influential Sikhs ‚Äì Yograj Singh, father of cricketer Yuvraj Singh ‚Äì proudly regurgitated it with same rue ‚Äì ‚Äúwe saved their women‚Äù. Recurrences of this theme ‚Äì of Sikhs saving Hindus ‚Äì has seen particular accretion in the past few years. The narrative ‚Äì which has now turned into mammoth propaganda ‚Äì is clearly short of any legitimacy at historic evaluations.\n\n&gt;Since the start, till up to the 5th Guru, Sikhism had hardly established itself as a separate religion. It was seen more as a long extending branch of the great tree of Hinduism. And this branch, under the ruling, or rather guidance, of the earlier 5 gurus, was largely a peaceful one ‚Äì not habitual to carrying arms &amp; far away from proper militarisation. It was under the celebrated clans of Rajputs, particularly Rathores, that the militarisation of Sikhs was initiated. According to Sikhan di Bhagat Ratan Mala (written in the 17th century), Guru Hargobind was taught Shastarvidya by two Rajputs, namely Rao Sigara and Rao Jaita. His great-grandson Guru Govind Singh, the tenth Guru of Sikhs, was taught Shastra-Vidya by Rao Bajjar Singh Rathore, great-grandson of Rao Mandan Ji Rathore. And later Guru Govind‚Äôs kids were taught by Rai Alam Singh Chauhan, who, till today is considered as one of the finest generals to have ever lead Sikhs.\n\n&gt;The most prominent of names, under the Sikhs saving Hinduism claim, is of the tenth Guru, Govind Singh. However, history around him is not as simple as has been painted over the years with a thick bold brush. When his father Guru Teg Bahadur, who later became the ninth Guru, was facing heavy opposition from other Sikh groups against heading the Sikh community; it was Sawai Jai Singh who supported and played a crucial role in ensuring his elevation to the top. The same Sawai Jai Singh also, along with Rana Raj Singh, saved Guru Teg Bahadur from the evil clutches of Aurangzeb and gifted Gurudwara Bangla Saheb to the Sikhs.\n\n&gt;As per Guru Govind Singh‚Äôs own confession in the Zafarnama ‚Äì a letter, of him to the tyrant Mughal ruler Aurangzeb, with a complex set of challenging and pleasing words of pure puffery ‚Äì Guru Govind was an ‚Äòidol-breaker‚Äô.\n\n‚ÄúI vanquished the vicious hill chiefs, they were idol-worshippers and I am idol-breaker,‚Äù he said as per the verse 95.\n\n&gt;Aurangzeb was sufficiently pleased with the letter for he ordered his governor Wazir Khan ‚Äì who was in conflict with Guru Govind prior to the letter exchange ‚Äì not to trouble the Guru anymore. One of the instances of Wazir Khan troubling Guru Govind comes at the famous battle site of the Chamkaur-sahib, in 1704, when Guru Govind, after being chased by Wazir Khan and 700 horsemen and losing his 40+ men and 2 young sons, was in a hapless and life-threatening situation. If it wasn‚Äôt for Roop Chand &amp; Jagat Singh ‚Äì the two Hindu Rajputs of Kachhawaha clan ‚Äì who provided protection &amp; refuge to the Guru, darkness would have swooped the time frame.\n\n&gt;Guru‚Äôs conflict with the hill Rajas was not confined only to words. His men had plundered the domains of the semi-autonomous Hindu Rajas in the Punjab hills, some of them being the same who gave Guru Govind asylum post his father‚Äôs execution.\n\n&gt;Similar contrasting records to the recent narrative can also be seen in events relating to another Sikh Guru, Hargobind Singh, the 5th Guru. When Guru Hargobind was released from Gwalior jail in February 1620, he had with him the company of 52 Rajput princes of the Rathore clan. These Rajputs then went on to raise an army of 700 horsemen for the protection of the ruling house of Sikhs. The local Jagirdars of Punjab ‚Äì who, being unhappy after Guru Hargobind‚Äôs release from Gwalior, had struck an alliance with Mughal governor Abdul Khan ‚Äì attacked Guru at Rohilla, in, what later came to be known as the first battle of the Sikhs. Luckily for the Sikhs and the Guru, Rajputs under Rao Mandan Ji Rathore were standing as the bulwark in between. The Mughal governor was badly defeated and Jagirdars, the enemies, were made to flee. Subsequently, the Sikh Guru was saved &amp; protected by the mighty and glorious among the already battle-hardened Rajputs.\n\n&gt;Another of such instances of effort and sacrifice by Hindus for the Sikh Guru can be seen when in 1628 CE Guru Hargobind visited Raja of Bilaspur Kalyan Chand at his capital Kot-Kehloor. Raja gave him patronage along with the village of Kiratpur and Kalyanpur as Jagir. The Mughal Emperor Jahangir, taking serious objection to it, asked the Raja to remove the Guru from the hill state of Kehloor, to which the Raja refused. Later Raja Kalyan Chand shifted his capital from Kot-Kehloor to Sunhani (Bilaspur), but didn‚Äôt renege from his stance[1].\n\n&gt;In modern propaganda, both the contributions of Hindus in saving Sikhs is often sidelined and slipped under the carpet. \n\n&gt;And the other who can‚Äôt be ignored gets appropriated. As with Banda Bahadur, the man who slaughtered Afghans and Mughals greatly and protected the Sikh Guru, is now being claimed by some as Sikh. While he was a Hindu Rajput (of the Manhas Clan) and was born as Lakshman Dev. The first Sikh state was created by him. As part of a Bairag Vaishnav sect, he had an ashram of his own, where Sikhs used to throw meat and slaughter goats. Infuriated with which his contempt against those Sikhs increased and is apparently seen in verses (18, 19, 20, 21) of Sri Gur Panth Prakash. Verses tell that Banda Singh had written that he was no longer a follower of the Guru but now of Bairagi Vaishno seat. Adding that he harassed and tortured those Sikhs as brutally as they had slaughtered goats in his monastery.\n\n&gt;No single caste or community holds the exclusive prerogative to wear the badge of saviours of Hinduism. The safety, security and prosperity of Hinduism has been and is a collective effort. There is no ‚ÄúAssi Hindua Nu Bachaya Si‚Äù.\n\nhttps://pragyata.com/the-mighty-myth-of-sikhs-saving-hinduism/'<br />Author: 'alubonda'  id: 'kiudq2'<br />Score:21<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kiudq2/the_mighty_myth_of_sikhs_saving_hinduism_the/</li>

Please read.'<br />Body: 'Honestly curious cuz,  yes most arguments are baseless and useless ,  most are favoured on one side or another and to those i say fuck it.\n\nBut I\'ve seen two very logically sound people or groups that are of individuals that start a conversation both present their points and even like humans discuss and admit things that their respective sides have done and / or  believed , but then eventually when questioned with facts over their most supreme followed they turn hostile and call each other these terms that are i guess the ultimate end term to disagree\n\nBoth being\n\nLi** , li****u or b***t or right w*.\n\nKeep in mind that this happens from both sides\nAn example here is when i heard people in a group discussion say the few good things about the new farm laws people agreed and discussed but when mentioning the both , all of them just ended up saying those terms.\n\nSo there the first side is wrong\n\nBut in cases such as another discussion i oversaw said if after Assam floods and many businesses losing homes and their financial problems be it business or private at such a bad rate is construction of a 1k+ crore parliament really necessary instead of giving out Surplus cheques to help households/businesses? \n\nWhich is again a fair argument , both sides agree but when questioned the current leader they both turn hostile .\n\n\nSo honestly my main question really is the title again... Why does this happen? Why is it that we have such differences in opinions and when we try to resolve them one party or another has few people that initiate the argument of  " Are ye to b***t h kya mu lagna " , " abe ye l****u h kyu bother karna inse"..\n\nWhy? Why does this happen? Is it that hard to just come together and accept both sides are wrong? Is the ultimate argument and agreement of opinions only stopped because of pride and ego?\n\nLook I\'m just a 26 year old guy doing well where he is earning enough to provide myself and family but it just makes me irritated because both sides are educated so why does this exist? Is it really so hard to accept that farm laws are actually bad in few ways , current leader didn\'t address the nation when there were 90k+ cases but came back around 40k after the whole sssr fiasco?\n\nAnd is it so hard to accept that there are few good things about this govt too such as not many terrorism attacks and other laws that have passed in past that have done good too and the fact that other parties  are just as shady and have done same Things you\'re accusing the current govnt for but in worse?.\n\nNo one is perfect yes but why is it so hard to accept the flaws?\n\nHonestly I\'m just a bystander drinking tea and reading news thinking whoever is my next leader I don\'t care as long as he or she  can sustain the country and run it like a leader would.\n\n\n\nSo please don\'t label me as either of these cuz i could care less whether the top man is or anyone else , all i want is a responsible individual that admits when hes wrong and does what\'s right not  play political bs and blame the opposition on something going wrong. However if you still want to go ahead I don\'t really care either way which word you call me.\n\nIndia isn\'t a perfect country. That\'s pretty obvious.\nSo please answer this question cuz i want to know why is it that everytime a conclusion comes \n\nLi***u or b***t is the answer given or yelled at the end of it.\n\nEven this sub and others have terms like these banned in posts yet I\'ve seen mods saying these words themselves in comments.. its disheartening because bharat is amazing i love this nation so why are we like this?\n\nThanks for reading , I\'ll be asking this on both the subss cuz i want opinions of all.\n\nMaybe even I\'m wrong and id like to be and hear what you or they have to say cuz.. dude we are the next generation , what\'s the point of arguing over this bs we\'ll forget in next 10 years instead of being united?.. that\'s all.

So I wrote down the transcript of 8-9 min long video.\n\xa0\nVideo Titled - Turkey: Thousands jailed for insulting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan | World News | WION\n\xa0\n**** Video Starts****\n\xa0\nAnchor (Molly, not Palki): Countless people including minors have been jailed for insulting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Insulting the President in Turkey is punishable by up to 4 years in jail. Data released by Turkish Justice Ministry show that nearly One Hundred and Thirty Thousand people were facing trial over insulting the President over past six years. Nearly Ninety Six Hundred cases resulted in imprisonment. Some of the jailed minors are only 12 years old. Foreigners have also become victims of this draconian law. At least Nine foreigners were handed down prison sentence in last six years. Social media post critical of President are enough to land a person in jail. However the government has defended the law saying ‚ÄúIt protects public order and democratic society.‚Äù Joining us is Onur Erim, Political Analyst for more on that from Istanbul. Hi Onur, while the law is not recent, its use has increased under Erdogan. Hundreds of minors have been tried, what is your assessments of these latest figures that have been put out.\n\xa0\nOnur: Well first of all I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs due to a lack of translation, but what‚Äôs portrayed to be the Nine Thousand plus jailed it‚Äôs actually sentenced. Most of these trials end up in a, if they find guilty, in a sentencing less than 3 years, which under Turkish law is automatically no imprisonment unless it say the way they present which means if they don‚Äôt commit a crime within the next 5 years there is no sentencing. On the other hand there is no minor jail. I don‚Äôt know what the article is getting that from, under Turkish law that is also impossible. Yes they will be until if there is a sentence, it will be delayed sentence. But there is no minor jailed. Period. Period. Whoever is telling you this or translating this is not telling the truth. But the overall problem you know with this law, which is been around for a while as you have said, is being used more now. Also the law is not for the President, it‚Äôs for the Presidency. Let me just remind you, the biggest reason this is coming about is Turkey has had over the years has been the top three or five users in the world for all social media platforms, has asked for these social media companies to open up a representative office in Turkey. As most of these insults, these curses that these most of these trials are resulting of, threats were not being handled by any of these social media platforms. The rule was or the way it was is that you are taking these guys to court that are insulting you, threatening you, using foul language which to an unacceptable degree obviously‚Ä¶.you have to go to court. If the courts finds you right, then that court sends the decision to the US which 99.9% time they get no result back. So, Turkey because of the social media companies, the big ones ‚Äì the Instagram, the Twitter. They were not showing responsible you know businessmen practices. Turkey tried to do this on her own. At the end of the day, these are people that are cursing to a person and it‚Äôs not just the President, I also have been victim of this. These are people threatening a person whether it‚Äôs a President or somebody else or me or you. And you couldn‚Äôt do anything. It‚Äôs not like the US. US you can get a court order or a direct response from a social media platform. These social media platform for years has not done their responsible part. And right now this is the Turkish Justice System taking care of what Twitter, what Facebook, what Instagram should be doing.\n\xa0\nAnchor: Absolutely, so any social media post which is even borderline critical of the President is enough to land the person in jail.\n\xa0\nOnur: This is not borderline critical, I have the same thing. I‚Äôm a victim of this too.\nAnchor: Yeah, Yes.\n\xa0\nOnur: I took 130 people to court because they had cursed to my late mother. Because they had cursed to me for my religion. Because they have cursed because of my national view. This is NOT criticism. None of this are criticism. Wherever you‚Äôre getting this news is wrong. We could go case by case ‚Äì Hundred and Twenty Thousand whatever pending cases or resulted cases. None of them are for criticism, none. None. I know this because I‚Äôm also a victim of this.\n\xa0\nAnchor: Alright, if you can elaborate for our viewers what you went through and what happened in your case and the process that was followed.\n\xa0\nOnur: Absolutely. Again Hundred plus cases people were either cursing to my late mother in a language beyond foul. I mean it was beyond foul. People were cursing at me because of my religion. People were cursing at me because of nationalistic views. Again these are all, I mean this is, I don‚Äôt I can‚Äôt even say profound, these things were beyond profound. Beyond foul.

      <li>Title::: 'A Thief Raju and an Activist Jomon Puthenpurackal who helped in delivering justice to Sister Abhaya after 28 years'<br />Body: "At last justice delivered to Sister Abhaya after 28 years crossing all hurdles put by the religion\n\n **What the case was about**\n\nAbhaya was a 19-year-old who was living in the Pius X convent in  Kottayam. On the morning of March 27, 1992, she was found drowned inside  a well in the convent premises. The local police visited the crime  scene, removed the deceased body and investigated the case. Subsequently  the local police and the Kerala Crime Branch who took over the case  closed it as a case of suicide.\n\n### What did the chargesheet say - Father Thomas, Father Jose and Sister Sephy in a  compromising position.\n\nThe  CBI, in its reports, said that on the day of the crime ‚Äì March 27, 1992  ‚Äì Sister Abhaya, who was doing a pre-degree course, woke up at 4 am to  prepare for an exam. She was walking towards the kitchen to drink some  water when she found Father Thomas, Father Jose and Sister Sephy in a  compromising position.\n\n Fearing that she would complain, Father Thomas allegedly strangled her  in the kitchen while Sephy (the third accused) struck her with an axe.  \n\n **Sister Abhaya died due to drowning.**\n\n# KT Michael, the Crime Branch SP who was incharge of the initial  investigations in the case and who closed the case as suicide back in  1992 was accused of destroying key evidence. \n\n**Role of  Jomon Puthenpurackal (poor young man studied upto sixth class) who forced the reopening of the case**\n\nWe must congratulate activist Jomon Puthenpurackal (poor young man studied upto sixth class) who spearheaded campaign &amp; legal fights for Justice for Sister Abhaya for past 28 years and CBI Investigating Officer DySP Varghese P. Thomas for chargesheeting the accused\n\nSister Abhaya case - Local police tried to make first local thief Raju as killer. He stood stern saying what he witnessed. He landed for theft but witnessed murder and dumping of body in well. He stood firm all the way in Court during trial, while many educated became hostile.\n\nCBI IO DySP Varghese P Thomas stood stern challenging his SP Thiagarajan who retired as Addl.DGP in Odisha. After filing Chargesheet DySP Varghese took VRS with 7 years pending service. Was seen today with tearful joy in TV Channels describing pressures on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The role of the judges, they rejected CBI findings of 1993**\n\nUltimate credit in Sister Abhaya case to Judges. 3 Judges rejected CBI findings from 1993. At last CBI forced to file 4th report Chargesheeting in 2008. Credit also to CBI Investigating Officer DySP Varghese P.Thomas who stood stern &amp; activist poor Jomon campaigned for 28 years\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***Reporter*** *: One chappal in Kitchen, another Chappal near well?

Karunakaran &amp; Home Minister Vayalar Ravi - to transfer this case to CBI - ignoring Religious pressures and listening to public outcry \n\n**Eye witness and local thief Raju**\n\nAnother interesting fact in Sister Abhaya case - One of the main witness Raju was a local thief who was on spot in that night witnessing the murder &amp; dropping body in the well. He stood firm on trial saying what he witnessed while many educated changed stand\n\n# ‚ÄòSo happy, I will drink tonight‚Äô: Former thief who became key witness in Sister Abhaya murder case\n\n&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôm very happy today. Maybe it was God‚Äôs will that I be present  there at that time. Many people over the years have approached me with  crores of rupees for changing my testimony.

      <li>Title::: 'Left-leaning person here I feel this bill is for the better. I have some questions that I would like to be answered please.'<br />Body: 'The farmers who are protesting are from Punjab and Haryana. The question is why are only these states jnvolved? The answer to which seems simple. These states are the only one who actually are in profit with MSPs. I feel that this bill will most definitely reduce MSPs. If not now then later. So it is natural that farmers are protesting from Punjab and Haryana. What is in this bill that will be profitable for them too? This question itself is wrong tbh. The poor farmer in India mostly is not able to sell his crops at msp and the added cost of farming and transport only enables him to get a minor profit.  But that\'s not a problem for rich and large land owning farmers. And its a shame that I even have to ask this to entertain a minor group of farmers. It would be a disgrace if somehow the government concedes that this bill won\'t cover Punjab and Haryana. But then again no one wants to lose their money right? Another question of mine is why most economists are against this bill? I don\'t want you to say "because they are paid by congress." I am looking for constructive answers here. What economist are in support of this bill? Another question is if the APMC system dies gradually how will the government ensure food security down the path. Thank you for reading! I hope you guys can answer my queries.\n\n(As for why a left-leaning person think this bill is beneficial is because I am someone who does support free markets but there should be some regulations.  And this system where a farmer can only sell his/her crops in APMC is absurd. Other producers can sell their products anywhere so why should farmers be bounded by this. Especially when we are already a net exporter in food stuff and rising education levels among farmers. If India was still under Nehruvian Socialism this country would have died. But 30 years of economic liberalisation and I definitely feel this is fucking better. Reforms always face some agitation from the opposing groups but will we wait for a crisis to happen again before opening our eyes? Most countries with healthy economies doesn\'t have anything that will hinder there farmers and tell them where to sell their produce. It only hinders both the farmers and the corporations to turn a profit also increasing the prices for ourselves in the process.)'<br />Author: 'midnightverses'  id: 'ki45s6'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ki45s6/leftleaning_person_here_i_feel_this_bill_is_for/</li>

Do not buy ‚ÄúTear Free/No Tear‚Äù products as numbing/anesthetic agents are used in the product to numb the eye irritation.\n2. Do not buy products packed in plastic as chemicals stored in plastic can leach into the liquid especially during warm to hot temperatures. And logistics/transport is certainly not temperature controlled. And of course, we all know about the bad impact plastic has on our environment.\n3. Do not get carried away by brand names, make an effort to know ingredients. If you cannot pronounce or understand ingredients ‚Äì keep the product down. While reading ingredients ‚Äì make sure to look for a complete list of ingredients that went into the making of the product. If the product has a mention of **‚ÄúKey‚Äù/‚ÄùActive‚Äù ingredients that means there is more added to the product but the manufacturer is hiding the rest of the ingredients.** Also if the product labels **‚ÄúBase q.s.‚Äù** it certainly has chemicals in it.\n4. Do not buy **soaps/creams/oils** etc. with attractive colors as shown in the picture. Natural products derive color from the oils and are never as bright as pink, purple, blue, orange, yellow, green, etc.\n5. Do not buy baby products with fragrance. Look for soaps/creams/oils made with [Steam distilled essential oils](https://www.snaana.com/pure-essential-oils) only.\n6. Do not go after labels of ‚Äúorganic‚Äù&amp; ‚ÄúNaturaL‚Äù because for a product to be called organic/natural it need not be 100% made with organic/natural ingredients and therefore products available in the market often have organic/natural ingredients as little as 1%, Only for the sake of name to lure customers.\n7. Words like **‚Äúdermatologically tested‚Äù** are mere marketing tools so always make an effort to know ingredients.\n8. Do not buy lotions as lotions are the chemical composition and cannot ever be 100% natural. Instead buy ‚Äú[after shower oils](https://www.snaana.com/after-shower-oils)‚Äù\n9. Buy a cream that is 100% natural completely free from any base/chemical. If the cream contains water/aqua then it just cannot be a **chemical &amp; preservative free.** Also to know the purity of cream take a pan, heat it, and add a tablespoon of cream to it, if the cream melts completely to oil, then it is free from emulsifiers but could contain chemical/synthetic in the form of fragrance. If it turns to milky running liquid then it is a cream with added base ‚Äìchemical, emulsifiers, etc., and in no way natural.\n\n**The application of the right product is as important as feeding the child with the right food.

Even my grade card for semester 3 was with PASSED remarks.\n\nBut in 4th semester, the university decided to automatically give marks on the basis of 3rd semester marks, and then in entire 4th semester I have NaN (Not a Number) computer error because of that one blank. Now this NaN has casted shadows on my 5th semester admission and examination.\n\nI have spoken to university examination office, they asked me to clear the 3rd semester at college level. The concerned professor has recently sent marks to the office in Manual writing since her portal was locked for 3rd semester.\n\nBut the case is as it is, and my entire academic life is stuck. \n\n*Any advice, suggestion, etc. shall be appreciated.*\n\nP.S. I'm at my hometown, not near the university.\n\nThank you üôè."<br />Author: 'Substantial-Fall-103'  id: 'khc08b'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/khc08b/important_query_regarding_my_university_exam/</li>

It only helps  build confidence, it won‚Äôt magically attract girls towards your dick, you will still have to work for it. \n\nNow that Lund ki bhook is out of the way let‚Äôs talk about the benefits I got. The major one is energy beyond expectations, I dont need to sleep during the day anymore neither do I feel tired all the time, same energy through the day. I wake up early, 4 am everyday and I am surprised how much time I have in my hands and you will be surprised too, now you struggle with ‚Äútime nahi hai‚Äù then you will struggle with ‚Äútime kaise paas karun‚Äù . Please note that I am not saying you should wake up at 4, I always wanted to wake up early and this practice helped me achieve it.   \nI now get pleasant dreams during my sleep And there has not been a single night where I haven‚Äôt dreamt, this was important for me as when I was a regular fapper I never used to get dreams at night And I would wake up at weird hours.\n\nyou will start judging women based on what they bring into the relationship and not just their looks becuase now you have control over the strongest energy in your body And due to this your relations will be much better in all the parameters and not just sex. You will become a master of your emotions, nothing from the outside would be able to affect you. \n\nyou would be able to concentrate better. A lot of people will agree on this one.   \nand yes your penis, when erect, would be no less than a ‚Äú patthar‚Äú, not exaggerating. If you cum early in like less than 30 seconds, this will help you go beyond 5 minutes in the first 2 months itself and then will increase with practice. On the other hand if you have ED then too this will definitely help Although might take a little bit longer.   \nthere‚Äôs no way on earth you can stay depresse/sad/whatever if you practice this, your mind will automatically bring you up and you will start working towards your goals again.   \nDon‚Äôt fall for those bullshit studies that show fapping is necessary and all that, no it isn‚Äôt necessary.   \nwill your face glow? 100% there‚Äôs no way it won‚Äôt.   \nFinally I would like to end with a famous quote from a great man who walks on earth even today.   \n‚ÄúMuth mat maar bhosadi-ke‚Äù - a quote by RizeIng.'<br />Author: 'RizeIng'  id: 'kh93ph'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kh93ph/someone_asked_about_the_benefits_of_nofap_ive/</li>

It also said that today\'s Cabinet meeting was expected to recommend the replacement of the ordinance.\n\nThe ordinance to amend the Constitutional Council Act was introduced on December 15, and allegedly undermined the principle of checks and balances. It allowed the Constitutional Council to convene a meeting if a majority of its members attend it. PM Oli then held such a meeting on December 15 evening itself, according to The Kathmandu Post.\n\nProtests have been underway across the country in early December, where thousands marched in Kathmandu, the national capital, calling for a Monarchical restoration.\n\nDemands for the restoration of the Hindu Monarchy in Nepal has been steadily gaining momentum in recent times. Two weeks after the first round of protests for the same, the Rashtriya Shakti Nepal on the 30th of November threatened the restoration of the ‚ÄòHindu Kingdom‚Äô status of Nepal through a peaceful movement.

So it is only fair that these godmen should be held up to the standard they set for themselves.\n\nThe Hindu tradition has always been open to debates and criticism. In fact, the great Adi Shankaracharya was one of the greatest debaters too. And through debates, he won many to Hindu faith.\n\nIt's not our culture to put curtains on bad aspects of our faith, but rather to debate them out, and expunge them if they really are bad or not in accordance with prevailing times.\n\nI have seen some arguments on the lines of 'Just make something like this about Muslims/Madrasas and then you'll know'. Honestly, it's an ad hominem.\n\nIf Islam is primitive and is not willing to reform itself, that doesn't mean we too shouldn't. Why should we follow their primitive attitude of not being able to take criticism? If the PC culture is taken off the table, the non-Muslims will say in chorus that Islam is the most primitive religion. We need not follow them to our own degeneration.\n\nWith the revelations about godmen Asaram, Nithyananda and others like him, we have to acknowledge that some godmen are practicing perversion in the garb of faith.\n\nAnd they need to be called out.\n\nWhatever be the intention of Prakash Jha in making this web series, it does expose the nefarious side of all this godmen business.\n\nSome have argued that there are many good saints, why not celebrate them, rather than keep on harping about the bad ones?\n\nIt's because bad apples need to be urgently taken out and isolated, so that the rot they create is limited.\n\nAnd anyway, people are there to celebrate the good gurus. For example, I have been to Vipassana retreat twice, and it has helped me in various ways. So I also prodded my friends to do these retreats. That's a way of celebrating Goenka ji and his teachings.\n\nSame is the case with J Krishnamurti. I have read some of his books and have gifted it to some friends.

I know about this Institute and know that they are not scammer but how the heck did they get the information.\n\nHOW DOES THIS HAPPEN? There is clearly information being leaked which brings me into the picture because the kid is my maids son and I paid his fee from my own personal bank account.\n\nI had to give SOL my bank account information. I was reluctant but the kid came in on the last day with a maybe 4 hours left.\n\nI have previously done courses through IGNOU in the past, they have a significantly superior website. They accept credit cards and do not require you to input bank details or scans of cancelled cheques.\n\nI am beyond uncomfortable with this. There are so many points of data breach possible, it is giving me anxiety just thinking about that.\n\nI always take all precautions when it comes to banks and money. If it was my own admission, I would have never input the required information. I also learned the information is being verified by humans i.e. they get to see and do whatever with the user information although I do not know how true that is.\n\nI found that out from a conversation about something else with a person whose designation in SOL was secretary of something, he spoke like a peon. Didn't seem like an educated chap. The number was listed on a list available on SOL website.\n\nBiggest point of failure are the people working there, nowadays integrity is not a real thing in India and people will kill someone if they were paid enough to do it."<br />Author: 'kivaarab'  id: 'kgd8df'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kgd8df/how_safe_is_school_of_open_learning_delhi/</li>

I made it clear that I will not pay so much for home loan insurance when they are better, cheaper options available.\n\n A week later the loan agent came back to me saying that if I don't buy home loan insurance from Bajaj Housing Ltd. then they'll decrease my loan amount by 1 lac.

      <li>Title::: "What anti-Reservation folks in India don't get. A short guide."<br />Body: "I have to preface this by saying that of course the current system is not perfect but removing caste as the basis of reservations is being in denial of social realities in many parts of India. I mention some ways at the end where the current system can be modified to remove some flaws.\n\n\n\n 1.   Reservations are not a poverty alleviation program. There are poor people across groups, but there are a disproportionately high number of poor number of people in some groups i.e. groups that were historically marginalised\n\n 2.   Sure poverty is a problem, that's why there exist scholarships to remedy that problem.\n\n 3.   Casteism isn't just a problem of lack of resources but also one of social prejudice. Dalits weren't (and aren't in instances) discriminated just because they're poor but rather because they were forced to perform occupations that were traditionally considered demeaning.\n\n 4.    There's definitely a gap in how you're treated in society if one is a poor Dalit vs when one is a poor forward caste, with caste prejudice compounding the former's already bad situation. A simple example where this can be seen is the rental market where still exist barriers to Dalits relative to other communities irrespective of their income levels.\n\n 5.    Finally to pretend it's an equal race for all communities goes against the ground reality. Things like your family's wealth and educational attainment definitely give some groups way more social capital than others. Wealth begets wealth. Groups with a larger number of wealthier folks can (and do) help and support poorer individuals within their communities.\n\n 6.    It's like thinking of a running race where some participants have rocks attached to their legs and are starting distinctly behind, it can't be called a fair race by any standard. That's what the anti- reservation folks don't get.\n\nIt's for these reasons I believe caste based reservation still has to exist considering our social realities, though I'll be the first to admit the current reservation system isn't perfect. I personally believe there should either be a creamy layer excluding wealthier individuals from groups like there exists currently in OBC reservations for all reservations or a generational cap based on grade of service (say class A or Class C employees), the latter of which would be more fool proof in my opinion."<br />Author: 'indian_kulcha'  id: 'keujc1'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/keujc1/what_antireservation_folks_in_india_dont_get_a/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'The Rajputs and The Marathas, Swords of the Saffron drawn against one another'<br />Body: '(This is the third in my series of posts before I make a post on the Third Battle of Panipat. I hope you guys love this one as well and stay tuned for more. Cheers)\n\n\n\n\nThe Brahmins and Kshatriyas had since the days of King Sudas and Guru Vashishta, defended the borders of Aryavarta, with iron and blood. Yet, after 500 years of resistance against the Arab Caliphate, between 700AD to 1200AD, the Brahmin domains of Sindh and Kabul had withered away. It now fell upon the Rajputs, to struggle and sacrifice in service of nation and religion. For the next 700 years, the Rajputs stood as the bulwark for the Hindu nation in the face of absolute subjection, displaying standards of chivalry and morality, which have never been surpassed by any other race in any other country.\n\n\n\n\nYet, when the Marathas rose to prominence, the Rajput character had changed. Just as a sword dulls with age and iron rusts with time, so did the nobility and chivalry of the Rajputs suffer the ravages of jealousy, clan rivalry and centuries of war. Emperor Aurangzeb, given his suspicion of non-Muslims, distanced himself from the Rajputs who had served the Mughals since the days of Akbar, as renowned generals and administrators. Hence, they were robbed of court prestige and overseas posts which filled their coffers. The age wasn\'t conducive to the Rajput way of war anymore either. Gone were the days when the sword and the lance could carry the day, it was the age of muskets and cannons that made so much fodder out of massed cavalry charges. Hence, to prosper, the Rajputs needed to acquire rich lands, outside their barren and poor homelands.\n\n\n\n\nIt was this internal rivalry and constant strife among the great houses of Rajputana, that gave the Marathas an opportunity for expanding their influence. It\'s questionable, whether Maratha policy in Rajputana was a well thought out strategy or, simply fortuitous pragmatism, but what is certain is that the Marathas who were employed by the Rajputs as mercenaries and confederates, in the end reigned supreme.\n\n\n\nThrough their constant interference and employment in Rajput affairs and civil wars, Peshwa Bajirao, his son and Peshwa, Nana Saheb as well as Malharrao Holkar, Ranoji Scindia and Jayappa Scindia managed to extract huge sums out of the Rajput coffers, as legitimate payments, as war indemnity and as plunder out of their lands.\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the best example of the chaos of this period can best be understood from the example of Raja Madho Singh of Jaipur, and the War of Succession for the Throne of Jaipur (1743-1750).\n\n\n\nMaharaja Jagat Singh of Udaipur, married off his sister to Sawai Jai Singh of Jaipur on the condition that their son would take the throne of Jaipur, even if he had elder siblings from Jai Singh\'s other wives. \nThis son, was Madho Singh.\n\n\n\nSawai Jai Singh died in 1743, and when Madho Singh demanded part of the patrimony, Ishwari Singh his elder brother, declined which led to civil war. Ishwari Singh secured the support of Ranoji Scindia. Madho Singh secured the support of Jayappa Scindia and Malharrao Holkar for a sum of twenty lakhs. The following battles resulted in the two Maratha chiefs getting richer and the two brothers bleeding each other dry. Eventually the Peshwa intervened and after Madho Singh promised him 15 lakhs, Peshwa Balajirao "Nana Saheb" of which he received 10 lakhs when he arrived in person to confirm upon Madho Singh four districts. Ishwari refused the proposal and after being defeated in the subsequent battles that followed, committed suicide in 1750.\n\n\n\nTherefore, Madho Singh became Raja. He proposed to pay 10 lakhs in tribute on top of the 5 lakhs already promised to the Peshwa. But here too, the Maratha appetite for gold, showed its ugly face. The Marathas now demanded cession of at least 1/4th of his country. This was resented by Madho Singh, his nobles and his people.\n\n\n\nTherefore, to escape such unjust demands, Madho Singh plotted and murdered 4000 Marathas in Jaipur, through deceit, including generals and their families.\n\n\nIn response, Raghunath Rao, who was already in the North, settling arrears, proceeded to Jaipur. After a brief war, in 1758, a total sum of Rs. 55,14,962 was imposed on Madho Singh of which he paid only 6 lakhs to Raghunath, promising the rest in installments.\n\n\n\nIn 1759, Malharrao arrived to collect the arrears, but by now, Madho Singh knew, through regular communication with Durrani, that the Afghans would invade and Holkar would have to leave. He therefore held out and paid nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, greed, rivalry, lust for power, land and plunder was what made the Marathas and the Rajputs into bitter rivals. Though, one must not consider this to characterise the relationship between these two powers throughout their history, but certainly this was the picture, before the Third Battle of Panipat.\n\n\n\n\nSources : "Marathas and Panipat" by Hari Ram Gupta\n\n\n\n"Military History of India" by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n\n\n"Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan" by Lt.

Recently many Muslims have been saying that it is haraam to have any business dealings with the Jews whatsoever. To the best of my limited knowledge, even when the Muslims were fighting the Jews in the time of the Prophet, sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, he did not forbid trade with them, and when he died his shield or armor was with a Jews as collateral on a loan. Please inform us as to the correct position on this issue.  \n\n\nAnswer  \nPraise be to Allah.  \nFirstly:\xa0  \nThe basic principle is that it is permissible to interact and do business, buying and selling, with the Jews and others, because it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions interacted with the Jews of Madeenah, buying and selling, lending and putting items in pledge, and other kinds of interactions that are permissible according to our religion. The Jews with whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) interacted were people with whom the Muslims had a treaty; those who broke the treaty were either killed or expelled, or were left alone if that served some interest.\xa0\n\nBut there is evidence which indicates that it is permissible to buy and sell with kuffaar who are in a state of war against the Muslims.\xa0\n\nImam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n\nChapter: Buying and selling with the mushrikeen and people who are at war with Islam.\xa0\n\nThen he narrated (2216) that ‚ÄòAbd al-Rahmaan ibn Abi Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: We were with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) then a mushrik man came with some sheep that he was driving. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‚ÄúAre they for sale or a gift?‚Äù He said: ‚ÄúFor sale.‚Äù So he bought a sheep from him.\xa0\n\nAl-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Saheeh Muslim (11/14):\xa0\n\nThe Muslims are unanimously agreed that it is permissible to interact with ahl al-dhimmah (non-Muslims living under Muslim rule) and other kuffaar, so long as the object of the transaction is not haraam, but it is not permissible for a Muslim to sell weapons or tools of war to those who are waging war against the Muslims, or anything that helps them to support their religion.\xa0\n\nIbn Battaal said: dealing with the kuffaar is permissible, except for selling things to those who are at war with the Muslims that may help them against the Muslims.\xa0\n\nIt was narrated in al-Majmoo‚Äô (9/432) that there is scholarly consensus that it is forbidden to sell weapons to people who are waging war against Muslims.\xa0\n\nThe reason for that is obvious, which is that these weapons will be used to fight the Muslims.\xa0\n\nSecondly: \xa0\n\nThere is no doubt that it is prescribed to engage in jihad against the enemies of Allaah, Jews and others, with our lives and our wealth. That includes every means that will weaken their economy and cause them harm. Money is the lifeblood of wars ancient and modern.\xa0\n\nThe Muslims in general should cooperate in righteousness and piety and help the Muslims in all places in ways that will lead them to prevail and strengthen them and enable them to manifest the symbols of religion, to practise the teachings of Islam and to implement the rulings of sharee‚Äôah and carry out hudood punishments, and whatever will lead to their victory over the kuffaar, Jews, Christians and others. They should strive their hardest in jihad against the enemies of Allaah with all the means at their disposal. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‚ÄúStrive against the mushrikeen with your wealth, your lives and your tongues (speech).‚Äù Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2504; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.\xa0\n\nThe Muslims have to help the mujaahideen as much as they can, and do everything that will strengthen Islam and the Muslims. They must also strive against the kuffaar in whatever ways they can, and do everything they can to weaken the kuffaar and the enemies of Islam. They should not employ them as workers such as typists, accountants, engineers or servants in any kind of service that gives them more power to collect the wealth of the Muslims and use it against them.\xa0\n\nConclusion:\xa0\n\nThe one who boycotts the products of the kuffaar who are waging war against Islam, intending thereby to make manifest the fact that he does not like or support them, and to weaken their economy, will be rewarded in sha Allah for this good intention.\xa0\n\nWhoever deals with them on the basis of the principle that it is permissible to deal with the kuffaar ‚Äì especially buying things that he needs ‚Äì there is no sin on him, in sha Allaah, and that does not affect the principle of al-wala‚Äô wa‚Äôl-bara‚Äô (loyalty and friendship vs. disavowal and enmity) in Islam.\xa0\n\nThe Standing Committee was asked: What is the ruling on Muslims not cooperating with and not wanting to buy from Muslims, and preferring to buy from the kuffaar; is this permissible or forbidden?\xa0\n\nThey replied:\xa0\n\nThe basic principle is that it is permissible for the Muslim to buy whatever he needs of things that Allaah has permitted from both Muslims and kaafirs. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) bought from the Jews, but if a Muslim turns away from dealing with his fellow Muslim for no good reason ‚Äì such as deceit or high prices or bad products ‚Äì and he prefer to buys from kaafirs with no reason, that is haraam, because it implies that one is befriending the kuffaar, approving of them and liking them, and because it involves reducing the Muslims‚Äô business and preventing them from selling their goods, if the Muslim takes that as his habit. But if there is a reason for that, such as those mentioned above, then he should advise his Muslim brother to give up these faults. If he accepts the advice, then praise be to Allaah, otherwise he should go to someone else, even if he is a kaafir, if he is honest and decent in his dealings.\xa0\n\nFataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa‚Äôimah, 13/18\xa0\n\nAnd Allaah knows best.  \n\n\nSource: [https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20732/boycotting-the-products-of-kuffaar-who-are-hostile-towards-islam](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20732/boycotting-the-products-of-kuffaar-who-are-hostile-towards-islam)"<br />Author: 'PatronSaintOwl'  id: 'kep9yw'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kep9yw/bds_campaign_and_its_origin_in_hadiths/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Wardrobe Mirror That Led To Five Year of Horror'<br />Body: 'So, for all of you children of the precious soil that is Mother India, you will have to forgive me for being a foreign Hindu man. Although both my parents were born in India and follow Santana Dharma I was born in the UK so technically I am not an Indian - but as with all things my soul cannot be taken away from its true home.\n\nI was guided to this sub by another son of India, who thought you might be interested (or not) in some of the occult traditions that have followed the diaspora into Europe. This account was written for a primarily western audience so please forgive the dumbing down of Hindu concepts and words.\n\n**To set the scene, my family are of Hindu Indian background that settled in the UK in the 1960‚Äôs.**\n\nApart from my parents everyone else was born In the UK.\n\nTwo things of note are:\n\n* A, My grand-uncle was a Hindu Exorcist.\n* B, The Hindu religion (or Santana Dharma to give it its correct name) has an extensive belief structure based around the dark side ‚Äì demons, monsters, witchcraft etc ‚Äì that is also affected by the local environment and folklore.\n\nAs a family we moved to a new house that was previously owned by an elderly lady. The lady was found dead in the home; downstairs, were apparently she was sleeping.\n\nThe only furniture that we kept was beautiful wardrobe that had a long mirror on its door. It was situated in the master bedroom.\n\nWithin 2 years my father died. Apparently, a heart attack (he did have underlying illnesses).\n\nThen within six months weird things begin to happen after my first nephew was born.\n\nMy mother said she saw my father looking over his first grandchild early one morning.\n\nAfter that she began to hear voices coming from the master bedroom calling her name at odd times when no one else was in the house.\n\nThe family put it down to stress and grief. No more occurrences until my second nephew was born.\n\nHis birth seemed to trigger a cascade of events.\n\nInitially it was voices that would moan in agony coming again from the wardrobe area of the bedroom. Then shades (shadow people) crossing the top of the stairs. My mother &amp; sister-in-law were scared to tears when they heard screams and footsteps pounding all around them ‚Äì yet no one else was in the house.\n\nThen the attention centred on my youngest nephew. He was 2 when it began. He would sit for hours talking to various ‚Äúpresences‚Äù in various rooms in full front view of the whole family.\n\nOne evening everyone was in the living room just talking. The two boys were playing their respective toys when suddenly the youngest stopped and shouted loudly ‚ÄúNo No No No ‚Ä¶ stay away stay away‚Ä¶ stay away‚Ä¶‚Äù. My brother had to hold him tight to stop him from having a fit. From then on one adult would always be with him.\n\nFinally, one night my sister-in-law woke to hear name being called ‚Äì she looked to the wardrobe and found ‚Äúpeople‚Äù on the other side looking into the room ‚Äì most of them were of Indian heritage.\n\nShe thought she was dreaming ‚Äì went back to sleep but awoke an hour later ‚Äì again the people where still there but this time she saw one pushing its way through the mirror into the bedroom!\n\nThis is when her screams woke everyone. Cue the whole house lit up and the family staying at a cousin‚Äôs place that night\n\nNext day we brought in a Hindu priest who went around.\n\nHe came back down, looking very unsettled.\n\nHe told us that the old woman who owned the house was living downstairs because of the mirror. The mirror was the focal point of all the issues. It was acting like a portal and our family history of dealing with the occult ( re my grand uncle) had attracted all the individuals in our family who had died and not reincarnated due to attachment to this material world. They were angry and hungry.\n\nThey were looking for peace, so they decided to use this portal to attract the attention of the family to do the final rituals for them hence all the activity, attacks etc.\n\nWe asked what would happen if we just got rid of the wardrobe.\n\nHis answer, now 30 years old, scares me to this day:\n\n‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt matter. They have gained a foothold in our world. The door has been opened. If you don‚Äôt do the rituals in India, they will possess the youngest and then each one of you in turn. You will all die but not before you suffer mightily‚Äù\n\nMy brother, sister-in-law, mother, and youngest nephew (the most affected) went to a special place in India and did the rituals over a day.\n\nThe moment the final mantra was spoken myself and my eldest nephew heard the door of the wardrobe shut forcefully. Then, under, the instructions of the priest we took the wardrobe apart taking care not to break the mirror and then disposed of it.\n\nToday, 30 years later, my youngest nephew is 32 and hates all things spooky. My sister-in-law only uses small vanity mirrors and I sometimes get sudden chills that alert me to never look into any mirrored surfaces within the location I am in. I did once and scared myself so badly I did not leave my house for a week.\n\nIt seems that the ‚Äúoccult sensitivity‚Äù that made my granduncle an exorcist jumps one generation, and now it is myself and two cousins who display, two varying degrees, sensitivity to the occult.\n\nI appreciate your patience in reading thus far. I have collected more anecdotes of the South Asian occult experience in the West (and India) and maybe I may relate some more here.\n\nIn the meantime, please be incredibly careful what furniture you keep or old furniture you buy and if you can, do buy brand new mirrors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jbnlxq9yun561.jpg?width=1162&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d37005ef395ecc6e1e7f5587efb39c177d0a47e7'<br />Author: 'NeverMindTheCarrots'  id: 'keodx3'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/keodx3/the_wardrobe_mirror_that_led_to_five_year_of/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'WTF is wrong with Education Minister and NTA'<br />Body: "NTA has decided JEE mains to be held 4 times in a year from Feb to May. This is just a stupid decision tend to increase the stress of students.\n\n1) Do they even realize that students have to live in a constant pressure to improve their ranks every month by reattempting JEE Mains.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Even if a student gets a good score in the 1st attempt, this doesn't ensure a good rank as at the end of the 4th attempt many students will have better score than him and his rank will decline. This will certainly add the pressure to give Mains every single month to ensure a good rank. And mind you students have to study for JEE Advanced too and not just give Mains every fucking time. \n\nAlso the normalization sucks, If you have given exam this year you would have noticed that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Also, what does Education Minister means by improving marks. This may sound rude, but this is a competition exam tend to filter students by giving them ranks. \n\nIf you provide a student chance to better his marks you are just doing this on the cost of other students. This is because marks does not count, there are just ranks. If I get a better rank then it is not only my benefit but also disadvantage of those other students whom I surpassed by reattempting Mains. Because this process does not ensure that your rank will be the same as January rank after the end of 4 months. Also this will be done by without even warning them that there ranks are getting lowered.  \n\nThis system will only add more stress and fear of exam among students.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLink:[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/4lakh-questions-in-12-languages-21-jee-m-to-be-held-in-4-cycles/articleshow/79731444.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/4lakh-questions-in-12-languages-21-jee-m-to-be-held-in-4-cycles/articleshow/79731444.cms)"<br />Author: 'MacTavish_28'  id: 'kecbnt'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kecbnt/wtf_is_wrong_with_education_minister_and_nta/</li>

It has been called "one of the most influential religious movements in 20th century Islam. "\n\n**Why Should we call it Tablighi Jihad ?**  \nWhen Delhi was put on Alert due to CoronaVirus, Tablighi Jamaat called "CoronaVirus as Wrath of Allah on Kaafirs/Non-Muslims" and refused to suspend the meeting of 15000+ Members which was happening in their "Official Headquarters". After they are caught by Delhi Police, The Jamaat Members were involved in Abusing, Misbehaving, Loitering, Urinating, etc on Quarantine Center Staffs, Doctors and Security Guards. These methods were clear enough to show that this Islamic Org posed threat to India in the long Term. and so it did happen.\n\n[https://www.news18.com/news/india/quarantined-tablighi-jamaat-attendees-misbehave-spit-at-doctors-staffers-at-delhi-railway-facility-2560707.html](https://www.news18.com/news/india/quarantined-tablighi-jamaat-attendees-misbehave-spit-at-doctors-staffers-at-delhi-railway-facility-2560707.html)\n\n[https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/coronavirus-india-tablighi-jamaat-attendees-misbehave-staffers-spit-doctors-delhi-quarantine-units-1662322-2020-04-01](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/coronavirus-india-tablighi-jamaat-attendees-misbehave-staffers-spit-doctors-delhi-quarantine-units-1662322-2020-04-01)  \n[https://www.opindia.com/2020/04/tablighi-jamaat-coronavirus-quarantine-tantrum-abuse-official-spit-doctor/](https://www.opindia.com/2020/04/tablighi-jamaat-coronavirus-quarantine-tantrum-abuse-official-spit-doctor/)  \n[https://www.opindia.com/2020/04/tablighi-jamaat-misbehave-doctors-nurses-kanpur-no-disease-coronavirus/](https://www.opindia.com/2020/04/tablighi-jamaat-misbehave-doctors-nurses-kanpur-no-disease-coronavirus/)\n\n**Various others News Links**  \n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia\\_pacific/india-coronavirus-tablighi-jamaat-delhi/2020/04/02/abdc5af0-7386-11ea-ad9b-254ec99993bc\\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/india-coronavirus-tablighi-jamaat-delhi/2020/04/02/abdc5af0-7386-11ea-ad9b-254ec99993bc_story.html)  \n[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/4/7/how-tablighi-jamaat-event-became-indias-worst-coronavirus-vector](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/4/7/how-tablighi-jamaat-event-became-indias-worst-coronavirus-vector)  \n[https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/things-to-know-about-tablighi-jamaat-and-covid-19-controversy-linked-to-it-1662252-2020-04-01](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/things-to-know-about-tablighi-jamaat-and-covid-19-controversy-linked-to-it-1662252-2020-04-01)  \n[https://www.rt.com/op-ed/485205-india-covid-19-tablighi-jamaat/](https://www.rt.com/op-ed/485205-india-covid-19-tablighi-jamaat/)  \n[https://www.livemint.com/news/india/coronavirus-nizamuddin-s-tablighi-jamaat-has-doubled-cases-in-india-11586088692350.html](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/coronavirus-nizamuddin-s-tablighi-jamaat-has-doubled-cases-in-india-11586088692350.html)'<br />Author: 'PatronSaintOwl'  id: 'ke94gy'<br />Score:67<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ke94gy/why_has_india_forgotten_the_tablighi_jihad/</li>
