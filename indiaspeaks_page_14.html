      <li>Title::: 'Guys Is Nationalism something bad?'<br />Body: ' \n\nI was on Quora and I came across this answer saying and potraying how nationalism is bad\n\nAs you guys are more knowledgeable than me, I want you guys to dismantle and if possible find the faults in this answer and expose this answer completely point by point\n\nHIS ANSWER:\n\n"***T******here has long been a brouhaha over the difference between nationalism and patriotism. While the liberals argue that it a menace for an inclusive society, the conservative right wing cadre deems it as an imperative integrating force.***\n\n***Nationalism in my view is a parochial concept that doesn’t just preach about taking pride in one’s ethnic identity but also to have a sense of superiority over others. While the former is completely normal the latter is what disturbs the liberals because that sense of superiority consequently develops into acrimony towards other creeds,ethnicities, cultures etc and thus one can infer that nationalism emanates from xenophobia and racial prejudice. Geoff Mulgan very aptly put this into words stating that “All of nationalism can be understood as a kind of collective narcissism”.***\n\n***Nationalism, furthermore, classifies people in two groups namely nationalists and anti-nationalists, and anyone who doesn’t conform to that yardstick is called an anti-nationalist***\n\n***Nationalism in India under BJP.***\n\n***As I am an Indian I can speak about nationalism in Indian context and most importantly under BJP \\[ the right wing political party which is in power right now\\]. As I have closely seen the vicious nature of nationalism under this regime I can delineate it through the example of this government.***\n\n***In the last 5 years, debate has been reduced to whataboutery, dissent has been dubbed treason and jingoism has become the new nationalism.***\n\n***The nationalism that BJP- RSS endorse is a distorted and rather noxious version of patriotism to woo the voters by exploiting their sentiments which is further promulgated by the mainstream media to entrench that into the subconscious of Hindus specifically in Indian context. BJP has somehow ably indoctrinated the masses with vitriol and lately this has been palpable in the society.***\n\n***Nationalism in India is often viewed with a Hindu perspective which is evident from the recent occurrences where Naseeruddin Shah was dubbed an anti-national for expressing his concern over the hatred spread in society following the gruesome incidents of Mob lynching’s, but when the Hindu nationalists carp “Hindu Khatre me hai” they are hailed as nationalists. This hypocrisy is often glossed over by the mainstream media who tend to abhor the so called “selective outrage” by the left liberals.***\n\n***Changing definition of nationalism.***\n\n***What fazes me even more is that the idea of nationalism is getting even more blinkered with the passage of time. While BJP from the very beginning has made it clear that anyone who refuses to chant “Vande Mataram” is an anti-national and obviously loathing Pakistan is tantamount to loving India, Subramanium Swamy a few years earlier said that anyone who doesn’t agree that Hindus were there ancestors are anti nationals and today anyone who stands for the languishing Kashmiri’s and highlights their plight is pronounced an anti-national because they believe that all this being done in national interest, recent example of it was Kannan Gopinathan, an IAS officer who resigned from his post protesting against the arbitrary clampdown in Kashmir. So the yardstick of nationalism has been getting narrower with time and it won’t take me by surprise if a few years later only a particular creed will fit into the requited measure of Indian nationalism.***\n\n***What kind of national interest is it where consent of the people of the nation is not considered?***\n\n***What kind of integrating force is this which assails the syncretic ethos of the world’s largest democracy?***\n\n***What sort of notion is nationalism where a student who crusades against the atrocities of government is deemed as an anti-national but the assassin of the father of the nation is thought of as a nationalist?***\n\n***How is Patriotism different?***\n\n***Patriotism on the other hand doesn’t dictate one’s ideology or coerces someone to abide by any nationalist rule book. A patriot can love other nations like one’s own and still not be declared a threat to his nation. A patriot does not have to prove his allegiance towards a nation by chanting slogans for the sake of it. A patriot does not validate someone else’s allegiance towards the nation. A patriot serves the nation to make it greater rather than being complacent and convincing oneself that the nation they live in is the greatest.***\n\n***Nationalism played a salient role in the Indian freedom struggle but remember that the actions of freedom fighters were not driven by animosity towards the Britishers but their despotic regime***.**"**\n\nI HOPE WE CAN HAVE A HEALTHY, KNOWLEDGEABLE AND A CONDUCIVE DISCUSSION IN THE COMMENTS'<br />Author: 'SujathaVenugopal'  id: 'pyfjin'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pyfjin/guys_is_nationalism_something_bad/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The TFR rates are incorrect. It becomes more apparent if you look at it religion-wise.'<br />Body: "I would like to thank u/Propoganda_Account for this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo TFR means Total Fertility rate and is calculated by dividing the number of births **for an age group** by the total number of women **in an age group**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut this is the catch. It deals with the age group of **15-49.** So what's wrong with this ? Absolutely nothing right ? Every birth takes place in that age group right ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's incorrect actually.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason ? Because there are births outside this age group. Those births are counted for the census, but are not counted when calculating the TFR.  Let's take Kerala for example. Why is the TFR wrong ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://swarajyamag.com/politics/population-control-kerala-numbers-show-why-official-definition-of-tfr-will-not-work-in-india](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/population-control-kerala-numbers-show-why-official-definition-of-tfr-will-not-work-in-india)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n&gt;The Census-2011 for the state of Kerala shows that a large number of children were born to women aged less than 15 years and greater than 49 years, especially among Muslims. However, the TFR figures based on the same Census-2011 for the state of Kerala are 1.53 for Hindus, 1.7 for Christians and 2.3 for Muslims.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**If the two age groups (less than 15 and greater than 49) are also included in the TFR calculation, it will** ***drastically*** **increase the Muslim TFR over other religious groups.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut why muslims specifically ? From the 2nd link,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Social commentator and writer M N Karassery said one probable reason could be the status of Muslim women who face several restrictions while accessing higher education or pursuing own careers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurther, while the muslim personal law says that the minimum marriage age is 15, some muslim organisations in India say that there should be no minimum age of marriage. Such as,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/nation/story/20130715-child-marriage-indian-union-muslim-league-kerala-underage-marriages-764491-1999-11-30](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/nation/story/20130715-child-marriage-indian-union-muslim-league-kerala-underage-marriages-764491-1999-11-30)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom 2013.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, we do have the Prohibition of Child Marriages Act (POCMA) 2006. However, the act mentions ONLY the Hindu Marriage Act. Not any other personal law. Which means, this law doesn't apply to muslims.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough, [while the Madras HC held that the POCMA Act dominates the muslim personal law](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/child-marriage-act-prevails-over-muslim-personal-law-madras-hc/article7057892.ece) ,  The Punjab and Haryana HC [did not](https://www.firstpost.com/india/muslim-law-allows-girls-to-marry-anyone-on-attaining-puberty-rules-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-9293291.html) . I can't find any other info, so I am assuming in all states except TN, child marriage for muslims is allowed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure, since it's above 15, it's counted. But what about for those under 15 ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, some muslims organisations are saying **they don't want any minimum marriage age.** Even if such a request is denied, **they may still encourage it.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain looking at Kerala, from the 1st link, we get this\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n&gt;For instance, the number of births by Muslim women and Hindu women for the year 2016 were 21,1182 and 20,7831 respectively, **which indicates that despite their population being almost half of the Hindu women, Muslim women gave birth to more children.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**In other words, on an average, there were 100 per cent more births from Muslim women than their Hindu counterpart.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMuslims are about 27% in Kerala as of 2011, hindus at about 55%. By now, they should be at 28% and 54% roughly\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics\\_of\\_Kerala#Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Kerala#Religion)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is also the fact that muslims have more children than hindus.  From the 2nd link\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n In terms of birth order, Hindu birth rate is always higher than that of Muslims in case of first and second deliveries as per the data between **2010 and 2015**\n\n According to 2015 data, the Hindu birth rate for **first delivery** was 22.31% while that of Muslims was 15.36%.\n\n The birth rate of Hindus for **second delivery** was 17.63% while that of Muslims stood at 14.34%. \n\nWhile Hindu birth rate for **third, fourth and fifth deliveries** are 2.23%, 0.23% and 0.09% respectively, the Muslim birth rate **shows an upward trend**, registering rates of 8.32%, 2.38% and 0.85% respectively \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain from the 2nd link, let's look at live births\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; **As per the vital statistics report 2015, out of the total 5,16,013 live births in the state, 42.87% belong to** [**Hindu community**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hindu-community) **, 41.45% to Muslim community and 15.42% to Christian community .** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite their population being a**bout half** of hindus, the number of births registered is **almost equal** to that of hindus. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what does that mean ? A muslim woman has almost 100% more births than a hindu woman. To put it more simply, a muslim woman, on an average, has **double the number of children** as compared to a hindu woman.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, taking into account marriages before 15, number of live births (which is from the  **Annual Vital Statistics Report-2016**), the TFR, from the 1st link is actually..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; If we calculate the TFR for Kerala on the basis of the Annual Vital Statistics Report-2016, it comes to **around 2.8 for Muslims, while the same for Hindus is 1.3**, which actually shows that the Muslim TFR is **more than a 100 per cent higher** than that of Hindus in the state. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a comparison, the census 2011, states that the TFR for muslim women in Kerala is 2.3. When in reality, it's 2.8.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom the 2nd link\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; The percentage distribution of live births by age of mother and religion between 2010 and 2015 shows that **Muslims recorded higher birth rates for younger mothers aged between 15 and 24** when compared to Hindu and Christian communities. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics\\_of\\_Kerala#Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Kerala#Religion)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOfc, the muslim growth rate is slowing down as well as you can see. But it will take much longer for their population to stablise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKerala is fated to become a state where hindus would be in minority **in about 15-20 years** , and muslims and christians **together**, become a majority. \n\n# \n\n# Is this true for all other states ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost likely yes but the rates can vary. It depends on whether the muslims in that state follow the personal law strictly or if they practice 'no minimum marriage age'. \n\n In those states where the muslim TFR is already lower ), where muslim TFR is equal to hindu TFR  or it's almost equal, will stabilise faster. Or it may have even already stabilised in some. In these states, 'conversions' will be the main enemy for hindus rather than 'births'.\n\n(Data from census 2001 and 2011)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.ideasforindia.in/topics/human-development/hindu-muslim-fertility-differentials-in-india-what-do-district-level-estimates-from-census-2011-tell-us.html](https://www.ideasforindia.in/topics/human-development/hindu-muslim-fertility-differentials-in-india-what-do-district-level-estimates-from-census-2011-tell-us.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.ideasforindia.in/templates/i4ihome/images/author/saswat.table1.jpg](https://www.ideasforindia.in/templates/i4ihome/images/author/saswat.table1.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# So how do we prevent hindus from becoming a minority in these states ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. PCB, but has to implemented properly for **ALL religions.**\n2. Increase the TFR for hindus\n3. Sex education (a taboo in this country but must be done)\n4. Encourage use of contraceptives, particularly for muslims\n5. Bring in UCC and outlaw the muslim personal law. Let the marriage age for all be fixed at 21.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUCC however, can reduce the **child marriages** among muslims only to some extent. They need to be educated instead of being pushed into marriage and I am not sure if any law will fix that. Only social awareness can. Such as sex education, contraceptives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have not taken child marriages among hindus though. If we do take them, the rates can change for hindus but it would be small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to point out any errors."<br />Author: 'itisverynice'  id: 'pxstuj'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pxstuj/the_tfr_rates_are_incorrect_it_becomes_more/</li>
      <li>Title::: "India's need for a paradigm shift in her Internet Subculture"<br />Body: '## India\'s need for a paradigm shift in her Internet Subculture\n\n## 1. SYNOPSIS\n\n* Over the last decade or so, plenty of lamentations have  been expressed that our attention-span and mental-circuitry  is getting similar to that of **Odentotermus obesus**  lost in the flood-lights of IPL final, thanks to a lot of dark-patterns in consumer internet application design, which are optimized for increasing  user-engagement and revenue, and not necessarily the reader\'s intelligence or self-awareness.\n* This is obviously not  a phenomenon where Indians are an anomalous irritant. World-over,  a humongous disparity exists between those who **create content**  and those who **consume content** or **react to content**.\n* India needs to reassert and redefine her internet subculture, or her true voice will never be heard or known.\n\n## 2. WHY WE NEED TO CHANGE\n\n* Indians have become utterly prejudiced and lulled into a sense of disillusion towards the power of the written word, the raw-power that it harnesses, and the magnitude of changes it can spring forth.\n* It\'s a learned prejudice, a consequence of subliminal messaging being hammered down every minute you spend consuming what  someone else has written- that somehow the person expressing his opinion on some topic on the internet is a superior being on altar, and your defined role is only to react to it.\n* The prejudice on the opposite spectrum, obviously, is that everyone on the internet writing content is a donkey, and that nothing ever amounts to anything, and hence it is deterministically,irrefutably  inconsequential.\n* As Indians, if you are reading this content, just for minute- pause and ponder for a minute what it actually means. As you are reading this text - this writer, an unknown entity, is triggering changes in your pattern of thoughts, while he continues his quest for the misplaced packet of Aloo Bhujia. It **IS** magic and It **IS** powerful.\n\n## 3. FIRST PRINCIPLES  IN CONSUMING CONTENT\n\n* We need to divert our consciousness in the direction of first principles.\n* Let\'s see what it means with an example. I am not an expert in this, I am throwing some ideas.\n* Let\'s say you are viewing an image of a magnificent temple-complex that a king of the Chola empire had built.\n* We could potentially react to this image in various ways:\n   * Our ancestors were talented folks.I\'m proud of them.\n   * Our ancestors were idiots.\n   * Not my ancestor. I don\'t care.\n   * Zilch..Scroll over to next image..Where is that darn Bhujia packet anyway?\n* If you are thinking along first-principles, your instinctual focus would be to **get into the mindset of the creator**\n* This could mean the following\n   * How did the architect create a design-spec of this monument?\n   * How did they deal with project-management, and timeline estimates?\n   * How was stone-cutting skill taught, disseminated, and quality-control maintained?\n   * How were raw materials procured, stored? How were the tools of artisans made?\n   * Why is this component made the way it is?\n* The reason I believe this matters is that it will bring forth a fundamental shift in discussions, even when we are passively, in leisure, consuming content.\n\n## 4.  FIRST PRINCIPLES  AND OUR HERITAGE\n\n* The monumental tragedy, sadly, is not that over the millenia, Indians lost her obsession with first principles.The monumental tragedy is that we are not obsessed with it **right now** as a civilization.\n* Blame it on our extreme reverence our ancestors, or the transgenerational effect affect of colonisation. That\'s a moot point now.\n* We are in need of an extremely fundamental mindset shift  as a contemporary civilization, to course-correct. We need to rediscover the mindset of tinkerer that our ancestors were!\n* **Spiritual First Principles**\n   * This is a reasoned hypothesis.\n   * We can reasonably posit that our ancestral Santana Dharma pioneers  approached their relationship to the divine with the same mindset of scientists of Mars Rover or Mangalyaan -designing tools for scratching and making sense of an unknown world.\n   * It was **this mindset**  that let them experiment on meditation techniques, breathing techniques, dietary influences that helped them discover and formalize yoga, pranayama and so on.\n   * We need to **embrace and reclaim that fundamental kernel of our heritage**\n\n## 5. FIRST PRINCIPLES  :  CONTEMPORARY LONG FORM CONTENT\n\n* We have multiple points here that we need to meticulously consider\n   * **Long form articles are powerful**: Simply put, they are the best tool what we have to purely transfer complex human thought from one brain to another in it\'s pristine,undiluted form.\n   * **There is a lot of fluff and falsification**: We have information overload, people have become accustomed consuming 140 characters of witty banter\n   * **Intellectual pandering of content** : Low density of thoughts articulated in long-form content.  The point of communication is economy of effort over conveying of ideas.  The bias is sometimes towards the esoteric critic, than the actual reader.\n   * **It\'s not just about text anymore** :  The images accompanying the text matters. If you are talking about data, having data-sources referenced matters. If you dealing with graphs, the selection of graph-type matters.\n   * **Adopting best practices for structuring written content** : We need to steal some ideas from the academic world where they know the art of presentation in some sort of a  structure\n   * Example  (1) Abstract,  (2)Literature Survey  (3) Actual Content (5) Conclusion/Future Work\n\n## 6. ART OF LONG FORM CONTENT FOR EVERYONE\n\n* **Power of presentation has compounding results** :\n   * Does not matter what your profession is. If you can present your thoughts structurally clearly in long form- It gives you a great edge professionally.\n* **Profession Immaterial** \\*  You could be Doctor, Lawyer,Engineer, or a student. You should be able to publish a long form content easily online. \\* I strongly urge each reader to learn how to use **markdown**. Even for this article, I have used markdown. -  **Data proficiency** \\*  Learn the ability to generate graphs using data, and use them efficiently. \\* It sets you apart from the rest, and also when you provide citations it gives you credibility to any random layperson.\n* **Civilizational perspective** \\*  There are plenty of Indians who rightly feel that the contemporary western publications do not view Indic civilizational narrative with respect, or that it is  even viewed with contempt. - **Upskill Writing and presentation** :-  Content matters, but presentation matters too. - Nothing, absolutely nothing, can beat the reach of quality content and top-notch presentation. \\* Content of today **sets for the tone and tenor for the generation that will grow** reading it for over the next couple of decades\n   * We need hundreds or thousands of well-intentioned Indians who present and preserve their knowledge/skill in long-form text with great quality.\n   * &amp;#x200B;\n      * That should be a conscious part of the legacy that we bequeath to the next generation. As an individual.  How we evolved, How we grew, How we tried, and How we failed.\n* Your written words today may be the singular reason of a major decision of someone in the future.\n\n## 7. GROWTH MINDSET: INTELLIGENCE AND TALENT\n\n* I feel that we as a nation have recently developed an unhealthy obsession with an individual\'s "talent" and "intelligence" - We should place a cultural onus on having a **"Growth mindset"** in the words of Bill Gates and few other prominent people. - What this boils down to is that, we shouldn\'t be overawed by an act of an individual\'s demonstration of "talent" or "intelligence". - What really matters in the long run is a **tenacious pursuit** of excellence in skill or knowledge **without ego** \\- This means that  **you accept you will fail**, but still upskill and go ahead. This also means you are willing to learn from someone else who knows better than you. - This is also relevant to writing. Your initial articles, will be crappy. However, you need to sit back, observe, reboot and badger on.\n\n## 8. CONCLUSION\n\n* India\'s internet subculture should be consciously  driven towards generation of quality written content.\n* We should strive to be a nation of quality long-form written content producers.\n* We should have an ecosystem invested in writing long-form content.\n* Internet content is a state of "**everlasting now**". There is absolutely no sense of actual contemporary history, unless people chose to document/write about things.\n* Our sense of culture, and what we bequeath, will be inextricably be tied with the internet, and the content therein. As it is becoming fundamental part of our identity, and hence it is even more crucial that this time around, after millenia, **Indic civilization is the narrator and author of  it\'s story**\\- the story of each person, their trials and tribulations, their failures and success.\n* We owe it to our next generation to be inspired  from us to be  "tinkerers", "makers", "hackers", and be inspired from us, irrespective of the profession we chose.'<br />Author: 'DabakurThakur'  id: 'pxsn3z'<br />Score:60<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pxsn3z/indias_need_for_a_paradigm_shift_in_her_internet/</li>

For non-income tax payers, they could get swachh bharat tax credits for goods. This obviously needs some monitoring to ensure people actually do some work. This is complex, but if there\'s a will, it can be implemented and improved over time. Getting citizens to \'own\' the cleanliness of their areas can go a long way in making India really clean! \n2. **Ban Laal Thook: My post** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l9z3t0/swachh_bharat_please_ban_paan_gutka_and_laal_thook/)\n3. **Make builders accountable:** Make every builder accountable for maintaining cleaniliness in the 200 mtr radius of their building. Penalize if the cleanliness doesn\'t meet the standards.  \n4. **Tourist places:** Collectively penalize businesses around the place if the cleanliness standards aren\'t maintained, along with the govt. employees responsible. \n\nThere are a lot more things we can do..if muncipal corporations just do their job, India would be clean! So, it\'s probably time to privatise waste management and cleaning of the cities so employees can be made accountable for their jobs.'<br />Author: 'CoolGuess'  id: 'px249s'<br />Score:42<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/px249s/cleaning_india_for_real_some_ideas/</li>

Be more creative &amp; make more money in your job or in any business. Free 4-min method which is so simple and it works!'<br />Body: 'Hi, I am a 61 year old Indian author and I have discovered a simple spiritual method that works to help people achieve success at anything.  This really works!\n\nAre you a student and want to do great in your school or exams?  Learn this, it\'s simple and free!\n\nAre you a CA, engineer, professional or busy housewife or own your own business and want less stress and more flow?  Learn this!\n\nAre you a doctor or healer and want to learn to heal people far more effectively?  Learn this!\n\nDo you want to achieve any goal easily?  Learn this!\n\nDo you want to improve your health, remove stress and increase clarity and focus?  Learn this!\n\nWhat is this about?  It\'s a simple Spiritual method called Light Channeling.  I am teaching this for free in a Sunday morning zoom online meeting to anyone globally who wants to learn it.  It will remove stress and increase flow in whatever you want to use it for.  You will gain success much more easily.\n\nLet me tell you more about this and about myself.\n\nI have lived outside India (USA and other countries) most of my life.  I have been in the IT profession.  I have also been spiritually minded since a young age and did meditation and other spiritual practices for many decades now.\n\nAre you aware that human consciousness is growing or evolving?  All these things such as pandemic, the viruses that China is developing as bioweapons, this crazy stuff that is going on in Afghanistan, etc.  It\'s causing many people to question what is going on in our world?\n\nFor this reason, I created a Spiritual group.  Because I wanted to help people connect to their higher natures, or true spiritual selves.  My group is called \'Let\'s Create Bharat 2.0!\'  Because I really wanted to connect people to the true Spirit of Bharat also - or our ancient Spiritual values!  I love Bharat and believe Bharat is a very Spiritual land, that brought together and gave refuge to people of all faiths.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6klx6hodd5q71.jpg?width=420&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d48f2f9a2e24ce35729659d98507b8fe5b6912eb\n\nDid you know that the true meaning of Bharat is the "Rath" or chariot that travels in the "Bha" or Light?\xa0 So it\'s supposed to be a Light Chariot!\xa0 Bharat is supposed to be a land full of Light.\xa0 This is what it was in ancient times.\xa0 But all of that was destroyed by the invaders.\xa0 I believe Bharat will return back to that.\xa0 It may take some time, but it will happen!\n\nAll the Spiritual methods I provide are 100% free.\xa0 I never charge for\xa0any methods,\xa0and they are all provided online.\xa0 So you never have to go anywhere. People are learning this simple 4 min method and many people love it so much that they want to start doing it 2, 3, or 4 x daily!\xa0 Because it really works!\xa0 This will change tons of people\'s lives.\xa0 It\'s only 4 mins to do and you can easily learn it in10-15 mins.\xa0 It will create a night and day difference in your life!\xa0 And help you achieve whatever you want in life much more easily!\n\nOur group is not religious.\xa0 We have Hindus, Christians and Muslims in our group.\xa0 This is Spiritual.\xa0 And the methods we provide are from the human potential movement.\xa0 We believe that humanity is growing.\xa0 So these methods will add more Light and Love, Joy and Flow in anything you want to achieve.\xa0 It will make you a better human being also, or more compassionate and caring for others.\xa0\xa0\n\nMany people say that our methods are far more powerful than LOA or Law of Attraction.\xa0 I have been a LOA Coach in the past also.\xa0 But the Light Channeling is much more powerful and creates better results to create anything you want in life.\n\nI have just started the group in India a short time ago.\xa0 And I have a few testimonials of people who are loving the methods.\xa0 (I was teaching this to a Western group - people from US and Europe - previously and I have many testimonials from them also.)\n\nTo find out more about our Sunday morning Zoom calls (8:30 am every Sunday), just send me a DM.\xa0 We will teach you the 4 min method on the call free.

Over the past few days, I have been going through another one of my phases of trying to identify the subtle manifestations of casteism that I\'ve witnessed first-hand in my life - around me. The reason I\'m writing this post is to *bring attention* to this issue. I hope more capable people and more resourceful people will see this as a starting point to take up this issue and do something about this by moving some wheels in the cog. I am just narrating my first-hand experiences *as an outsider* after having thought about how disgusting this culture is and having strongly felt that something needs to be done to remedy this.\n\n# Background\n\nBefore I can get to my rant, I feel I need to set up some context for those not familiar with the workings of engineering college admissions in Karnataka. Most engineering students in Karnataka enter their colleges either through CET, COMED-K, one of the "management quotas", or in very specific cases (university-specific entrance exams such as PESSAT, but that\'s mostly not relevant to our discussion because it\'s such a small sample). However, there is also another mode through which you can enter - and it\'s called the Lateral Entry System. This is for the folks who have completed their Diplomas after high school. They can also write the CET (albeit, a different one) and directly enter into the second year of engineering. I believe they might have to cover some extra credits for what they missed out on in the first year, but beyond that, they are pretty much the same as a regular engineering student who entered in their first year.\n\nTo start off with, for most people who pursue a Diploma after high school, it is seen as a "backup" option for them to get into the job market sooner in case they have to support their family and have no time/money to pursue a full-blown engineering degree. Of course, some of them end up doing pretty well in their Diploma courses, and also have some bandwidth to go through the full BE/BTech degree, so that\'s where the lateral entry comes in.\n\n# The Rant Begins\n\nBefore I begin, I want to do a full disclosure: I am an upper caste, English-medium educated middle-class dude currently living in the United States, but I have grown up in an ultra-conservative lower-middle-class family setting as a child, so I have certainly seen the "raw" side of casteism around me (although not directed at me, ofc).\n\nI first encountered the incoming Diploma students on the first week of my second year, and straight away from Day 1, you could feel that they felt out of place in this new environment. It was not just the newness of being in a new place - everybody gets that. It was a very visible feeling of being out of place.  Many of them came from Tier 2 cities, and this was their first time in the thick of a metropolitan environment. Most of their classmates were richer, louder, more articulate, and probably largely upper caste. Their English was obviously good enough to pass the academic checkboxes, but conversational English was another matter altogether (they were in their comfort zone speaking Kannada). It was quite natural that all these factors led to an instant inferiority complex that they turned inward and formed a clique of their own, and barely interacted with anybody outside their group.\n\nAnd it was not that the rest of the class didn\'t notice this. Oh, we very much did. Despite that, nobody (including yours truly) offered to help them out with course logistics, just general fitting in, or anything along those lines. It was almost as though there was a tacit agreement that any strong association with them was a surefire way to be an outcast yourself.\n\n## Peer Interactions\n\nMost students had one of two modes of interaction with them - 1) Ignore them 2) Be patronizing (subtly, of course). The caste dynamic at play was obvious. The diploma folks, when talking to anyone outside of their clique, would talk in toned-down voices in almost apologetic tones. I do not recall a single instance of a diploma student getting into a loud conversation with a non-diploma student about anything in the class (or outside). At best, their interactions with the Outsiders were limited to one-on-one situations or when they approached other groups as a group themselves.\n\nMaybe someone with a keener eye for these things could pick up more signals / chime in in the comments.\n\n## Fests / Cultural activites\n\nNone of the students participated in the tech fests or the cultural events (at least that I know of (there might have been a few exceptions)). I don\'t recall even considering any of them when I would think about which of my classmates I would team up for a competition or a group activity. Sure, it wasn\'t because I was casteist; it was simply because I was trying to find the best set of folks for getting the job done. But shouldn\'t we think hard about what\'s preventing these folks from being just as good as any of the others? It\'s obviously systemic.\n\nNone of them felt that they had the agency to form a club of their own or even something like a formal meetup group of Diploma folks to help each other out. Nope. I\'m in an American university campus, and I can tell you that if the same thing were to happen here, these folks would make sure to bring the whole fucking university to its knees until things changed. Now, I know that political unions are banned in engineering universities, so that\'s probably unrealistic. But at least something like a support group of their own where they can inform one another about resources, and lift each other up would be great. I believe at this point, the colleges need to take responsibility to make this happen.\n\n## The Professors\n\nTo the credit of most professors, there were almost no outright incidents of discrimination that I saw at least during the class. I\'m sure I do not know the stories that took place behind the scenes and the staff room walls, so I will refrain from making any umbrella statements. However, there were certainly very obvious patterns that I noticed in their interactions with the professors as well.\n\n1. I remember ZERO instances of a Diploma student asking an even slightly challenging question to a professor. ZERO.\n2. Some professors obviously went out of their way to help these students do better in exams, assignments, etc. And make sure that they understood the material well. But surprise, surprise - there was a very obvious patronizing streak in their behavior throughout. No surprises at all, ofc.\n3. Professors were more likely to ask one of the front-bencher "Diploma students" to help them with small chores. This could be something as small as carrying books back to their staff room, but I still felt like they were disproportionately being asked to do these things. Or maybe I\'m reading too much / overgeneralizing. I don\'t know. But I wanted to put it out there nevertheless.\n\n## Career opportunities / Campus placements\n\nI would wager that most of the students from that cohort are doing fairly decently in their lives, especially considering that we were from the CS department of a top-tier college in Bengaluru, but I cannot speak for people from other departments (I\'m pretty sure my cohort was probably one of the better off ones).\n\nHowever, AFAIK, none of them actively considered grad school or see no realistic path where they end up in, say, a FAANG company (I\'m from CS, so this is the gold standard career path for us, but think equivalent stuff for other streams).\n\nI don\'t know anyone from the cohort who tried to reach out for internships or research apprenticeships (except for in their last semester when it was compulsory to do so).\n\n# "What does this have to do with caste?"\n\nIf you have to even ask this question, you are not my target audience. I don\'t have the patience to explain to you what this has to do with caste (and not simply a difference in incoming knowledge / them joining late / etc.). Go read The Annihilation of Caste a few times and come back.\n\n# If you were part of this cohort / know someone...\n\nMy intention with the post is not to speak FOR you, but just to narrate the things I saw. So if you were in such a cohort, I would love to hear about your experiences, anecdotes, ideas for changing the status quo, etc. If you know someone, please share this post with them (or get the message that they shouldn\'t go through this alone across in any way possible). My DMs are open to help in any way.'<br />Author: 'ItemPsychological223'  id: 'pvynwo'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pvynwo/guilt_rant_about_casteism_towards_diploma_lateral/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Wikileaks on John Podesta,Clinton lobbyist revealed Narayan Murthy lobbying for CIA front Ford Fdn to let it operate in India as Modi govt was trying to ban it in 2014-15.Modi backtracked after US embassy threatened that banning Ford Fdn will lead to international boycott of India as rogue nation'<br />Body: 'Taken from this BS article:\n\n[https://archive.is/vokRn](https://archive.is/vokRn)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNew Delhi: In the winter of December 2014, months before the Modi government’s crackdown on over 13,000 NGOs started, the Ford Foundation’s offices in New Delhi learnt through informal sources that its funding of an organisation run by activist Teesta Setalvad had drawn the interest of Gujarat state police.\n\n**Although the funds that were granted were for routine activities related primarily to research and the building of organisations dedicated to improving communal harmony – according to Ford Foundation internal documentation of the affair – the language used in Setalvad’s initial proposal regarding the 2002 Godhra violence kicked off a series of events** that plunged the foundation into a chaotic mess.\n\nThe stakes involved? According to the account pieced together by one of the world’s wealthiest charity funding organisations, **Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have been initially tempted to send Ford Foundation “packing” from India.**\n\nA set of e-mails leaked by Wikileaks detail the developments after December 2014 from the perspective of Ford Foundation officials – how they grappled with the impending controversy, their view on the Modi government’s motivations, the allies they recruited and the strategy they formulated.\n\n**The e-mails are from the personal inbox of John Podesta, campaign chief chairman to Hillary Clinton, and are mainly from Darren Walker, president of Ford Foundation, as they troubleshoot their way through the sticky situation of finding themselves on the ‘watchlist’ as part of the evolving criminal investigation against Setalvad.**\n\n**These emails, mostly sent from May 2015 to July 2015, show that there was a very active outreach from the Ford Foundation, not only through its senior global and India officials, but also by roping in the help of Ford Foundation trustees such as Infosys co-founder N.R. Narayana Murthy.**\n\nApril 2015: How it started\n\nOn April 13, nearly six months after the Ford Foundation first learnt that its connection to Setalvad was being viewed warily by Modi government, Times Now reported that the Gujarat police had asked the Ministry of Home Affairs to look into whether the Ford Foundation had violated rules governing foreign donors and, more importantly, whether the foundation had acted in conflict with “India’s national interest”.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Times of India reported that the organisation had been put on the government watch-list. Throughout this month, the foundation’s internal communication suggests that “neither Gujarati law enforcement nor any agency of the national government formally contacted the foundation” until the month of May.\n\nWhile no official government contact was in the offing, the foundation did receive a tip-off from an Indian journalist in the form of a document that confirmed its position on the Modi government’s watch-list.\n\nAfter learning of the government’s action indirectly, an internal Ford Foundation document notes that all grant-making within India was ceased.\n\nBy the beginning of May, officials in its New Delhi office, along with Walker, kicked into damage-control mode, reaching out to lawyers and engaging international media monitoring firms. Multiple requests for a meeting with Modi were sent out, requests that apparently “stressed the foundation’s readiness to strengthen its review procedures and find common ground in terms of programmatic priorities”. These requests ultimately proved to be unsuccessful.\n\nHowever, on May 21, the trio of Walker, Infosys’ Murthy and Kavita Ramdas (Ford’s India head) met Nripendra Mishra (principal secretary to the prime minister), finance minister Arun Jaitley and what one document describes as the “influential \\[resident\\] Commissioner for Gujarat” (Bharat Lal) in separate meetings.\n\n**It’s unclear how successful these meetings were, because three days later, on May 24, Walker sent one of his first e-mails to Podesta. “I’m just back from Delhi and need your advice on a sensitive matter. Would you have time for a brief chat in the next couple of days?” the email reads.**\n\n**Follow-up emails show that this is around the time that Podesta started receiving semi-regular updates from the Ford Foundation team in New Delhi. In one correspondence on May 26, Walker attaches a document of “background materials on the current controversy” – which explains in detail their short-term action plan and thanks him for reaching out to foreign secretary S. Jaishankar.**\n\n“Many thanks for speaking with me last night and your willingness to reach out to S Jaishankar on our behalf. As promised, please find attached background materials on the current controversy between Ford and the Indian government. I’m happy to speak further if the information contained raises questions that need clarifying,” Walker wrote.\n\nModi’s gamble, through the eyes of Ford Foundation\n\n**“\\[The\\] PM’s initial reaction seems to have been to send us packing, de-authorize us fully” – this was the assessment of the Ford Foundation last year, based on “insider accounts and insights”, that was shared with Podesta.**\n\nModi’s reaction was apparently influenced by the Gujarat police’s investigation into Setalvad. “When the Gujarat police contacted Home Affairs, the Intelligence Bureau also got involved and flagged Ford’s perceived transgressions in the Setalvad funding to the PM,” the Ford Foundation’s background reads.\n\n**The troubles began when the Gujarat police ordered the foundation to turn over internal documents related to Sabrang’s (Setalvad’s organisation) funding.**\n\n**The original 2004 Sabrang proposal to the Ford Foundation included “strong and accusatory language” against the BJP and then-chief minister Modi for the 2002 Gujarat riots.**\n\n**“Although the foundation’s funds were stipulated for routine activities related to research, public education, an online archive, and the building of a network of organizations interested in advocating for improved communal harmony, the language included in the background portion of Sabrang’s proposal was very personal with respect to Modi’s potential culpability, and once in the custody of Gujarat police became a new center of focus – and eventually the source of another allegation of foundation meddling in political affairs,” said the US group’s version of events leading up to its inclusion in the ‘watchlist’.**\n\nIt was apparently the Intelligence Bureau’s evaluation which stopped Modi from following through on his initial instincts to “send us (foundation) packing”. “IIB (Indian Intelligence Bureau) warned that it did not have strong enough evidence to justify that,” the background note says.\n\nModi’s political advisers also tallied up the “risks, of say, an embarrassing defeat for the government in court”.\n\n“Thus the decision to place us on a watch list, a relatively standard move related to the treatment of Greenpeace and others,” it said, referring to the suspension of FCRA license and the freezing of the bank accounts of the environmental NGO.\n\n**A couple of weeks before this evaluation was shared, US ambassador to India Richard Verma had publicly expressed concern about the “challenges” being faced by NGO. “Because a vibrant civil society is so important to both of our democratic traditions, I do worry about the potentially chilling effects of these regulatory steps focused on NGOs,” he said at a lecture on May 5. In April, US state department spokesperson Marie Harf said that the US remained “concerned about the difficulties caused to civil society organisations” after suspension of Greenpeace and restrictions on Ford Foundation.**\n\nThe foundation, however, felt that these public pronouncements may not have had the desired impact on the Indian government.\n\n“It is very possible that the interventions by the USG \\[US government\\] did not go down well at all, especially those carried out in public,” it said. “Lack of subtlety and nuance—or at least none perceived,” was the denouncement from Ford Foundation.\n\nThe US’s public statements were criticised in the foundation’s background notes as being rather tone-deaf. “It was all delivered as very general concern, tied to respecting civil society and the usual American narrative about threats to democracy in other countries and how other governments should behave, not “we understand and respect your concerns about Ford, but it would be great to resolve this in ways that serve all our interests”.\n\nBureaucracy running amok; MHA at fault\n\nThe darkest days, however, were over, felt the foundation. “Some advisors suggest that the worst – in the way of official action – has been done by now. The points have been made, the financial squeeze is in place. From the government’s perspective, why risk defeat through formal charges, for example”.\n\nThe “suggested talking points” drafted for Podesta to take forward the issue with the Indian leadership were built on this analysis.\n\n**The Ford Foundation wanted Podesta to convey to Indian interlocutors that a “long and rudderless process driven only by the bureaucracy won’t play out well”. The message was clear: “Your Home Affairs Ministry has made it all but impossible for Ford to operate although senior officials – including the PM’s Principal Secretary – have assured the foundation’s president and Narayana Murthy that India wants Ford to continue to operate in India”.**\n\nThe line to be pursued by Podesta was that an over-eager bureaucracy should not push India into joining the international community’s rogues’ gallery. “If that’s indeed to case, I have to say, unintended bureaucratic snarls could lead this to spiral in a direction that’s very difficult to walk back. It would be a shame if India ended up in the tiny ‘club’ of nations that have forced the Ford Foundation to depart – Mugabe’s Zimbabwe, Pinochet’s Chile, Nigeria under military dictatorship,” said the section under ‘talking points’.\n\nDawn of a resolution\n\nAs part of their Podesta briefing, internal documentation also shows how Ford officials approached a possible resolution with the Modi government. \n\n“\\[In\\] the absence of any specific request or guidance from the government on a resolution, the onus is on the foundation. We must diplomatically propose a face-saving way out for government,” the note says.\n\nAny forthcoming resolution, the organisation’s officials felt, would have three key components.\n\nThe first would be a formal apology for any procedural sloppiness seen in the Setalvad case, even though this was not a “general pattern or practice” carried out by the Ford Foundation.\n\nThe second component would have the foundation conceded its “exceptional status” within India and register formally under the appropriate law. “This would support the political and bureaucratic narrative that government ‘won’ something once it detected inappropriate behavior by a long-privileged American donor, and it would help remove the sense of undeserved special privileges that apply to Ford alone, not Gates or others,” foundation officials note.\n\nThe last aspect of reassurance would be the promise of “tougher internal oversight”. This oversight would include things that the foundation would do internally “over and above legal requirements” to avoid similar mistakes in the future.\n\nResolution and conclusion\n\nThe draft resolution that Ford Foundation appears to have been a blueprint for what eventually did happen; albeit with Podesta’s help. On June 13th, an e-mail from Walker to Podesta has nothing in the body, while the subject line reads: “Much improvement coming from PMO, thank you! thank you! Will keep you posted. Darren.”\n\n**A month later, on July 16th, a Times of India report declares that the stand-off between the Ford Foundation and the government has ended, with the organisation agreeing to register its India arm under the FEMA Act – a concession that the foundation’s draft resolution had agreed to make in May as a “face-saving measure” for the Modi government.**\n\nOne day before the TOI report was published, however, an e-mail from Ford Foundation board trustee Thurgood Marshall Junior profusely thanks Podesta for his intervention.\n\n“I learned from Foundation President Darren Walker during a sidebar discussion of your pivotal assistance with the Indian Prime Minister. Remarkable – You never cease to amaze. Thanks – I remain a loyal member of the Podesta Fan Club and in your debt for being one of my best bosses and colleagues,” the e-mail reads.\n\n# In March 2016, almost a year after the troubles surrounding Ford Foundation India began, the situation finally returned to a state resembling normalcy. A week before Modi was set to leave to Washington for the nuclear security summit, the ministry of home affairs decided to remove the foundation from the “prior approval” category. Simply put, it meant Ford Foundation no longer had to get clearances from the government before handing out any grants, putting an end to its year-long tussle with the Modi government.'<br />Author: 'StarsAtLadakh'  id: 'pvww7w'<br />Score:61<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pvww7w/wikileaks_on_john_podestaclinton_lobbyist/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Identity crisis in the Tamils - culture wars and the moral engineering project'<br />Body: 'Dravidian parties are not fans of free speech so there’s been little to no criticism of their policies within the state, and national parties rarely understand TN enough to dissect its politics. \n\nAny kind of critical analysis of Dravidian identity is rare, even though it can be very insightful. This speaks to the awful state of journalism and social sciences in the nation. I am not a social scientist, this is based on personal observations.\n\nThe preoccupation with a unique Tamil identity begins in earnest half a century ago, after the rise of the Dravidian parties to power. This was initially pushed in the political rallies, but it was particularly pernicious in schools, where children were told the values of their parents are rubbish, the values of their grandparents are out of date.\n\nThis created a lot of confusion. Starting about 40-50 years ago they were not only told to reject the past, but they were not told what values to believe in for a wholesome life. Thirukkural was added as an afterthought to remedy the vacuum, yet Kamba Ramayanam was excluded despite being the best example of Tamil poetry, because it was Hindu. Even Thirukkural has now become problematic in a way for its Vedic links, which is the very thing Dravidianism set out to destroy.\n\nThirukkural cannot come to your aid when you wonder whether it is proper to go out on a date, and how far do you take it.\n\nPabulum such as self esteem / self respect, everyone should be praised and supported was, and even now is in vogue. It hasn\'t worked in 50 years of political enforcement.\n\nThe population is thus estranged from what has gone on beforehand, and has become obsessed with identity. Instead of allowing the population to find out for themselves, this vacuum of identity is politicized and profited by the politicians, Tamil experts, entertainers and movie makers.\n\nTamils used to live in a world where identity issues were in the margins of society, nobody would begin a political meeting or movie by emphasising their Tamil identity.\n\nMatinee heroes and heroines could speak Tamil in thick Telugu, Kannada or Malayalam accents or even Brahminical accents and be accepted. People, even politicians could own their diverse heritage. Today this permission to be different is only for the imported Bombay heroines.\n\nThe politics of social justice, equality and Tamilness has created a fake and artificial society where everyone has to constantly prove their Tamilness and social justice credentials, even if they have to stand for a movie council election.\n\nThe desire to reinvent one\'s own identity speaks to a loss of identity, an inability to make sense. A loss of control and agency over the world.\n\nYou acquire identity through your work, through your achievements. As people lost connection with achievement and merit, they had to find a positive identity however infantilized and make-believe. \n\nThis confusion is seen in the simultaneous fluidity of identity and fossilization of identity.\n\nThe old ideas of caste and religion, Sanskrit and Dharmic links are rejected. A new self respect movement where everyone is equal is praised. Yet, paradoxically caste identity has become stronger than ever in Tamil Nadu and temples still draw crowds more than ever.\n\nIn seeking to invent this liquid modernity where everyone can be everything, the politics of TN has given birth to a rock solid fossilized history. Whether that is Thevar, Dalit or Gounder, the voting blocs are along caste lines more explicitly than before.\n\nBesides being deeply harmful to democracy, this reveals elements of insecurity and anxiety. People want to find some sort of grounded way to express identity, and they see it in caste and language, even as they profess a casteless society.\n\nEquating Tamil identity with destiny has become a fatalistic accomplishment. It erases the original liquidity and modernity impulse, and leads to increased forms of anguish, because the invented identity is never satisfactory. Who is a Tamil remains a deeply problematic question.\n\n“Who is a Tamil?” is a subject of big debate in political meetings of parties like NTK. Speaking Tamil is not enough to be Tamil, this is somewhat like the “Who is woke?” debates the global Left has.\n\nYou have some “Tamil experts” who say the Mahabharata took place in Tamil Nadu between local tribes and was appropriated by the Aryans, and equally you have others who reject the Ramayana and Mahabharata as Aryan. There is a contradictory desire to reject and to appropriate the same cultural products. This is like the Jataka tale where a crow tries to deny that it is a crow.\n\nCurrent Dravidian political dynamics is an attempt to define the Tamil self, create a sense of belonging. The motive is also to include the Eelam Tamils who have forcibly had to disown their Sri Lankan identity after the war, and are in search of a home.\n\nDravidian politics springs from an active corrosion of earlier definitions. This births a desperate search for a glorious past. Whether through literature or through archeological finds there is a movement to invent a better alternative to Aryan-hood, contradictory DNA results notwithstanding.\n\nWhen you are not sure where you stand with the rest of society, it leads to an intense level of social fragmentation. Social equality becomes the disease instead of the cure.\n\nThere is an active rejection of facets of life that minimize alienation - solidarity among languages and castes is rejected for a new "equal" society that doesn’t exist in practice. Skilled work and merit is not respected, instead empty platitudes are mouthed about respect for all labour.\n\nWork and vocation do not provide you with the kind of solidarity of identity any longer, because it is not earned. Through the pride you get as a mechanic, carpenter or plumber you get a sense of identity - but these identities are subtly undermined as less desirable to a professional qualification. \n\nSince only a few can become professional bureaucrats, doctors, lawyers and engineers the majority feel like they’ve lost out. A sense of victimhood is actively promoted.\n\nThe many losers are carrying the burden of the lie that “everyone can be everything” in the new social justice utopia. This forces the politicians to dilute educational standards like NEET, and satisfy the craving for a new social standing.\n\nPressure of heavy urbanization in TN where 60% of the population are in cities means nothing lasts for very long. People find it difficult to understand who they are when there’s no permanence. North Chennai is praised as being better than South Madras - new rivalries are created where they didn\'t exist. \n\nSocial interaction becomes a kind of divination and occult where depending on the words that are used one\'s social standing is interpreted and judged. \n\nMost people derive clarity about the meaning of life and purpose from society, but when the promised society is classless and open on paper, there is no official attempt to give meaning to people in relation to their peers and family. Removing caste from last names has only led to a charade of caste divination through other symbols.\n\nEveryone carries the burden of individualism, whereas in the past identity was shared across the collective.\n\nSocio-economic or material factors don\'t give identity - wealth creation has kept increasing in Tamil Nadu, yet the new culture lacks a system of meaning through which to interpret one\'s experiences. Your identity as the owner of the new iPhone is fragile, it vanishes in 3 months.\n\nThe confusion is clear when you see contradictory value systems are being promoted - youngsters are asked to seek their destiny in far away lands and places, but immediately they are also told not to leave their parents to the mercy of senior homes. The young are told to live the international life, but are immediately also told to respect tradition. Material wealth is promoted as the new symbol of success, yet  immediately the glorious poverty of farming and the honest villager with roots to the soil and family are held up as ideals to aspire to. The corporate villain is a cinema trope even as the young trip over each other to get selected into these corporate companies. Love marriage and casteless romance is promoted as the new normal, but immediately there is also a backlash against logical social arrangements such as living together.\n\nSince society fails the individual, you fall back on yourself, focus your world around this tiny entity called the ego. This leads to psychological depression and social harm.\n\nAny public discussion of Tamil identity suffers from historical amnesia whenever facts are not politically advantageous.\n\nTamil society is in a state of cultural adolescence without the anchor of tradition. The stage of adolescence, which is really an extended childhood, makes people fragile, emotional, and likely to kick out. \n\nWhen facts are shown to be contradictory to beliefs, such as the growing casteism and lack of standards in education, the response isn’t to re-examine founding ideas, but to immaturely lash out.\n\nMany even begin to believe that becoming an adult is not a particularly positive step. If reservation gets you a degree there is disappointment when it doesn’t get you a job. \n\nWhen the new “socially just” world doesn’t get you the romantic partner you seek - this can even lead to acid attacks because the population has been told for long that they can get whatever they dream of in this new utopia. Karl Marx actually foresaw this and had suggested that all women be collective property of the state and men wouldn’t have to compete over women, the state would provide. Phew, a good thing that never came to be anywhere in the world.\n\nAdulthood where one has to be responsible for one’s actions is seen as inferior to that of adolescence. This adolescence is politically useful since it becomes an army of political supporters. \n\nThe pressure on politics is thus to constantly promise to break society away from the bad old ways to a new semi-utopia. Constantly keeping the adolescents from becoming adults.\n\nThe pressure of urbanization and a tradition-less society is stoked and maintained for the benefit of builders, real estate barons, large business owners and capitalists who don’t want many holidays and traditions to slow down production.\n\nThe cardinal sin of Dravidian social justice is that it is dispossessing youngsters of their cultural heritage. The choice to be a rebel, to overthrow the old ways is not made by the individual. It is made for them. This is violence.\n\nThe people are left at the mercy of the experts who continually tell them what to believe. Ultimately you don\'t think for yourself and rely on what to believe from the media and the movies.\n\nTV and Movies begin engineering morality at a very early age. Moral entrepreneurs hold the levers of cultural power. Subliminally promoting a set of ideas as the new moral truth every so often. When to love, who to love, what to aspire for, what to be loyal to, what is permitted. \n\nThe average individual cannot argue back at this heavily packaged new morality or new ideal, and he begins a process of self censorship. \n\nOnce you begin to self censor, slowly but surely you internalize. Language that was alien to you becomes who you are. These mass market re-education programs are more successful than what the Maoist Chinese put people through.\n\nPeople are freed from the traditions of the past, but dragged into a confusing present where new forms of control are brought.\n\nMost forms of control are not direct, yet people are essentially told - "you cannot do this".\n\nUse of language is necessarily, and consciously opaque - words that were once acceptable are now no longer considered Tamil, or too Sanskrit or too casteist, or too Brahminical. \n\nAccents are policed. Words spoken with a Brahminical lilt are lampooned. English usage is criticized, unless it is spoken by the children of the Dravidianist leaders.\n\nThese controlling devices are put forward by an elite that is no less convinced of its own truth than the traditions it seeks to overthrow.\n\nMedia and businesses know how to spin according to the prevailing political conditions.\n\nLeaders publicly state their desire to rescue you from your own ignorance. Translation: Make sure you think the way I do, the moment you don\'t, you are my enemy. It is a coercive effort to ram an ideology down the throats of the Tamil people.\n\nThe spirit of enlightenment is about doubt, about skepticism, about questioning things. Modern Dravidian social justice is very certain about what qualifies as good, without a critical examination of the past. This is not any kind of liberation or enlightenment as promised.\n\nPeople are denied any space to understand or know themselves on their own terms and participate in the collective human flourishing.\n\nIt is a deep wound on the future.\n\nI am certain large parts of this analysis can also be applied to many other identity movements in India. \n\nFootnote:\nThis analysis builds on the work of many social scientists on identity politics, any credit goes to those experts.'<br />Author: 'greasesoda'  id: 'pvotaz'<br />Score:108<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pvotaz/identity_crisis_in_the_tamils_culture_wars_and/</li>

She told this story in front of a Sessions Judge M.N.Pattnik.\n\nOn the eve of Makar Sankranthi on January 1999, Staines had organised an annual camp for local Christians. The camp was setup to discuss the locals’ Christian belief in a social setting and was conducted at the border of Mayurbhanj and Keonjhar in Odisha. Hemalata Karua and her husband too were invited to participate in the camp. She told the judge that Staines persuaded her and her husband to convert to avoid financial difficulties. Both converted to Christianity and stayed over at the camp for the night. Recounting the events of the night Hemalata said, “He entered and asked me to close my eyes and meditate. As I was meditating he laid his hands on my body, I protested but he continued to persuade me, saying physical relationship with him would benefit me.” When she screamed, Hemalata said, Graham fled. She left the camp with her husband the next day. Two days later Staines was killed. She also told the judge that 20 days after the incident, Staines wife, Gladys, approached her and expressed regret for her husband’s actions. BJP MP Satya Pal Singh accused Graham Staines of molesting 30 tribal girls and converting them to Christianity. He said Staines behaviour with women and relentless conversion activities angered the locals who took law into their own hands. He also accused a senior Congress leader of forcing CBI to exclude this accusation from the charge sheet\n\n#Church influence on Indian Supreme Court\n\nIn 2011, the Church applied pressure and connived with the anti-Hindu State to force the Hon. Supreme Court to expunge two paragraphs from the original observations made in the sentencing of Dara Singh, prime accused, in the death of Staines. In a rare move Justices P. Sathasivm and B.S. Chauhan reversed two original paragraphs after immense pressure from the media cabal and Christian organisations. The original observations of the Supreme Court carried references to conversion activities by the Church.\n\nOriginal observation of Supreme Court\tReplaced with\n\nIn the case on hand, though Graham Staines and his two minor sons were burnt to death while they were sleeping inside a station wagon at Manoharpur, the intention was to teach a lesson to Graham Staines about his religious activities, namely, converting poor tribals to Christianity.”\tHowever, more than 12 years have elapsed since the act was committed, we are of the opinion that the life sentence awarded by the High Court need not be enhanced in view of the factual position discussed in the earlier paragraphs\n\n \nIt is undisputed that there is no justification for interfering in someone’s belief by way of use of force, provocation, conversion, incitement or upon a flawed premise that one religion is better than the other.\tThere is no justification for interfering in someone’s religious belief by any means.\n\n \nAnalysis of changes to Supreme Court judgement in the Dara Singh sentencing\nIn the original observation, the Supreme Court had come down heavily on the activities of Christian missionaries. The original bench of the Supreme Court had observed, “the investigations revealed that Staines was involved in conversions and there are materials to suggest that the missionaries were involved in forceful conversions“. The Wadhwa Commission stated that Dara Singh was not connected to Bajrang Dal since there was no evidence. But the National Commission for Minorities ignored the Commision’s report and adjudicated Dara Singh as a Bajrang Dal member.'<br />Author: 'StarsAtLadakh'  id: 'pv7x9w'<br />Score:163<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pv7x9w/hemalata_karuaa_tribal_woman_had_accused_graham/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Definitive guide (or an attempt) to debunking the Out Of India Theory'<br />Body: ' \n\nWith the advent of Indic nationalism in India, there have been people like Srikant Talageri, Nilesh Oak and Abhijit Chavda along with other "indic wing" YouTubers and so called "Historians" (none of them credentialed) ; there is a pseudo-historic theory floating that "Aryans" were Indians and they subsequently moved out of India and then conquered the rest of Indo European world, which is complete quackery. This is an attempt to create a definitive guide towards debunking this Psudo-History.\n\n**Basics:**\n\nTo debunk the Out of India Theory (hereinafter, OIT), you need to understand what is the scholarly view of Indo-Aryan migrations. To oversimplify, there is a hypothised homeland of "Aryans" (which is not the Aryans that Hitler states) known as the "Urheimat". This homeland is a hypothesis not because it did not exist, but because we don\'t know where it is. It is commonly accepted to be the pontic steppe, which started after the Horse was first domesticated around 5200 BCE ( Anthony, David W. 2007). These people after domesticating the horses started moving in a lot of directions, one of which is south, towards India and Iran as well as west towards the Europe.\n\nThese people, also known as the "Proto-Indo Europeans" (hereinafter PIE) carried their language and culture all around Asia and Europe. These people were pastoralists who moved all around Asia and Europe for a variety of reasons, the most accepted of which is climate change. In short, there was an event called the 4.2 kiloyear event which was, as the name suggests, 4.2 kiloyears from now. This event created climate change which made the steppe colder and also created aridification around the globe, which resulted in the decline of Bronze Age civilizations like the Indus Valley Civilization, Mesopotamian Civilization as well as Egyptian civilization. ( Staubwasser, M.; et\xa0al., 2003) . So the first point, is why the Aryans started to move. Climate change as well as their pastoralist nature, hence they were not averse to moving.\n\nThese people brought their genes, their culture, their language and their way of life down south (only for our discussion, they moved westwards also, but we are not concerned by that for now). So technically, Sanskrit (or the ancestor thereof) as well as the Vedic Aryan culture came from the outside of the Indian subcontinent. You can understand why the nationalists refuse to accept this.\n\nSo what are the evidences of such a migration?\n\n1. **Linguistic evidence**: The best way to know how a culture changes is to look at the language that they speak. Let me start with an example. In hindi, the word for father is " **पिता** ", we know it came from the Sanskrit "**पितृ** ". But then again, we find similar words for "Father" in other languages. Father in English, Vater in German, Pader in Farsi. How is that possible? Indians and Greeks didn\'t have significant contact before Alexander, so how do we speak similar languages?\n\nTo answer this question, we employ a comparative analysis of language. We start from the languages that we speak right now and start to move towards the ancestors of that language. When we have reconstructed all that, we can come to a conclusion, that all the Indo European languages (hellenic, Indo Iranian, Italic, Celtic, Germanic, Armenian, Balto-Slavic, Albanian) started from a common ancestor known as the "Proto Indo European" language, this language is still being reconstructed.\n\n**First argument of an OIT proponent: All these languages started from Sanskrit. This is not true because Sanskrit and other PIE languages have a common ancestor. Quite like the theory of evolution. The language changes simply do not signify that Sanskrit was the mother of PIE languages. (Examples can be provided on demand in the comments, since I dont want to make it too technical)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Indo European language family](https://i.redd.it/xnh0n1jk9hp71.gif)\n\n \n\n2. **Archaeology:** The oldest nucleus of PIE people could have been the Samara culture, but there is already debate about it (6000-5000 BCE), but we can certainly see the similarities between the Yamnaya culture (3600-2300 BCE) and Vedic culture. Yamnaya culture is also called the Pit Grave Culture. This can be called the nucleus of the PIE culture. From this particular area, the Indo European (hereinafter, IE) languages spread west, south and east, starting from 4,000 BCE. These languages and culture was mostly patriarchal, that means, mostly men moved, along with their culture. (David Anthony, 2007).\n\nSo the Yamnaya people, who were located north of the Black sea. These people moved east and created Sinthasta Culture (2200-1800 BCE). This is the place where Indo Iranian (the progenitor of Sanskrit and Persian/Farsi) was spoken. (Anthony, 2007). This culture then developed into the Andronovo Culture (2000-900BCE) which interacted with the Bactria Margiana Culture (BMAC) \\[timeline: 2400-1600 BCE\\]. This is where the group split indo the Indo-Aryans (which later became the vedic culture) and the Iranian (they became, well, Iranians). The migration in India was in waves and it **was not an invasion!** These groups were genetically diverse and they spread their culture everywhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Pattern of PIE migrations](https://preview.redd.it/yygtvimxahp71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5261be36c665e80e28d16e4e086d56e860421edb)\n\n \n\n3. **Genetics:** This is your Brahmastra. This will conclusively destroy all claims of OIT. India has two genetic components, first is the Ancestral North Indian (ANI) which is made up of Middle Easterners, Central Asians and Europeans and Ancestral South Indian (ASI) which is completely distinct from each other. Today, Indians are a mixture of both. Endogamy started after 4200-1900 BP (before present) so, we are a mixture of ANI/ASI. Dravidian/Aryan on the basis of genes just does not exist. Period. [Recommended Reading and source of this info.](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002929713003248)\n\nThis undeniable, peer-reviewed research paper proves :\n\n*By sequencing 523 ancient humans, we show that the primary source of ancestry in modern South Asians is a prehistoric genetic gradient between people related to early hunter-gatherers of Iran and southeast Asia. Following the Indus Valley Civilization’s decline, they mixed with people in the southeast to form one of the two main ancestral populations of South Asia whose direct descendants live in southern India. Simultaneously, they mixed with descendants of Steppe pastoralists who spread via Central Asia after 4000 years ago to form the other main ancestral population. The Steppe ancestry in South Asia has the same profile as that in Bronze Age Eastern Europe, tracking a movement of people that affected both regions and that likely spread the unique shared features shared between Indo-Iranian and Balto-Slavic languages*.\n\n[Link to the paper.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6822619/)\n\nNarsmihan studies prove that there was indeed a migration from north to south in the Indian subcontinent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Yamnaya and other ancestries\' geneflow into India and Europe.

Asuras of Rig Vedas became ""Ahura" in Zoroastrianism with flipped roles. Long story short, Asuras are the good guys in Zoroastrian faith, their supreme god is called "Ahura Mazda", whereas the opposite is the case in Rig Veda. The same can be observed in other myths as well. Another name of Ahura Mazda is "Varuna" which is a prominent Rigvedic diety. These similarities are not possible unless they came from the same source. . \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 1e06b6h2bhp71...*\n\n \n\nThere are many other things that I can answer if anyone asks in the comment section, if I include them all, the post will become unbearably huge. So now, I will move on to the counters to the OIT narrative. Find below, the arguments from OIT proponents and the debunking of the said evidence.\n\n1. **\\*\\*Rig Veda makes a mention of Saraswati (Ghagghar Hakra) when it was a great big river some 7000-9000 years ago.Saraswati became seasonal later, how did Rig Vedic people write about Saraswati when it was in full force**?\\*\\* : Saraswati is bound to remain a mystery given how less writing survives from the Vedic era, yet let me make an attempt to put the Saraswati question in context.Saraswati, according started to decline around 3000 BCE. Which should be contemporaneous with the Indus valley civilisation, more specifically, the Early Harappan Phase which lasted from 3300-2600 BCE. Now the problem with Saraswati arises when we take Rig Veda as the reference document for accurately dating itself. At 3000 BCE, in the Sapta Sindhu region, Sanskrit was not being used. We know this for a fact because we find no remnants of Sanskrit in the Indus Valley seals or other items there.\n\nAnother issue that comes up is about the horses. Horses were not a thing in Asia minor till around 1800-1700 BCE. Rig Veda mentions horses extensively. We find no irrefutable proof of horses in the Indus Valley. I have seen the seals and most of the publically available items with my own two eyes. There are no horses to be found there. Other cattle are found, just not horses. . The problem with dating rig Veda pre-1800BCE is that the horse question remains unsolved. How can a civilization that did not see horses write so much about horses?\n\nThese two points should be kept in mind when you try to date the rig Veda pre-1500-1300 BCE. How can these logical inconsistencies be answered?\n\nIf the Vedic people were around in the Sapta Sindhu region in 3000 BCE, we would find evidence, but we find none.\n\n2. **Astronomical evidence:** In short: it is pseudoscience. Astronomical evidence cannot be taken on face value when other material evidence is against it. Plain and simple.\n\n**3. Yamnaya people were not white, hence they were indian:** There is a misconception that all central asian people looked white 500 years ago. This is just completely false. [This is a peer reviewed study](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003912) done by an indian scientist who reconstructed people who lived in Europe 7000 years ago, which would be around 500 BCE. Those people had dark skin and blue eyes.During the 84th annual meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists, it was concluded that when it comes to skin color, the team found a patchwork of evolution in different places, and three separate genes that produce light skin, telling a complex story for how European\'s skin evolved to be much lighter during the past 8000 years. The modern humans who came out of Africa to originally settle Europe about 40,000 years are presumed to have had dark skin, which is advantageous in sunny latitudes. And the new data confirm that about 8500 years ago, early hunter-gatherers in Spain, Luxembourg, and Hungary also had darker skin: They lacked versions of two genes—SLC24A5 and SLC45A2—that lead to depigmentation and, therefore, pale skin in Europeans today.\n\nBut in the far north—where low light levels would favor pale skin—the team found a different picture in hunter-gatherers: Seven people from the 7700-year-old Motala archaeological site in southern Sweden had both light skin gene variants, SLC24A5 and SLC45A2. They also had a third gene, HERC2/OCA2, which causes blue eyes and may also contribute to light skin and blond hair. Thus ancient hunter-gatherers of the far north were already pale and blue-eyed, but those of central and southern Europe had darker skin.Then, the first farmers from the Near East arrived in Europe; they carried both genes for light skin. As they interbred with the indigenous hunter-gatherers, one of their light-skin genes swept through Europe, so that central and southern Europeans also began to have lighter skin. The other gene variant, SLC45A2, was at low levels until about 5800 years ago when it swept up to high frequency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Probable facial reconstruction of the Yamnaya Pastoralists. ](https://preview.redd.it/dzkvrhj4bhp71.png?width=1342&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d0d0251d79c768666a40389c8fcb25ce7e0c566)\n\n \n\nEurope was not always white. Yamnaya people were brown, and that does not imply that Indians went out.\n\n4. **These accounts were written by racist Britishers:** There is some truth to it. The British were racists who gave the Aryan INVASION theory. Various Indian scholars have also concluded that there was no invasion, but migration in small waves. This is an outdated theory which no one accepts.\n\n5. **Chariots found in Sinauli is conclusive proof of chariots being indigenous to India:** Chariots are vehicles that are used in war. They are lightweight horse hauled and spoked wheeled vehicles used to haul soldiers and supplies. The vehicles found in sinauli are not horse-driven chariots, but are solid wheeled carts. These vehicles are impractical in a war, and hence, do not fall within the category of Chariots.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Carts and not chariots, found in Sinauli](https://preview.redd.it/3wpug4z6bhp71.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a19a466d19cc2857e29da5b3e01769b69d37bdd1)\n\nFirst sinauli is not a Vedic site conclusively. It is a late Harrapan, Ochre Colored Pottery/ Copper hoard site. SK Manjul, the director of excavations at sinauli had also stated that these are most probably not hauled by horses, but instead by other bovines. [Research paper by Asko Parpola debunking the Sinauli myth](https://journal.fi/store/article/view/98032)\n\n6. **Horse paintings at Bhimbetka in MP which date back to 10,000-20,000 years BP**:\n\nBhimbetka is archaeologically layered. It was inhabited from the Indian Mesolithic Era (\\~10,000 BP) to the medieval ages. Horse paintings found in Bhimbetka were created during periods VI and VII which are medieval.\n\nThese paintings themselves can be dated by comparing the style as well as the material used in the painting. The colours used by the cave dwellers were prepared by combining black manganese oxides, red hematite and charcoal.\n\nThis puts the horse paintings around the medieval era.\n\nSource: Mathpal, Yashodhar (1984).

Even the Hero Electric cycles are designed by Germany\'s designing &amp; research company, brought to india, labelled under Hero lectro &amp; sold for profit.\n\nRoyal Enfields uses a british R&amp;D team to design, develop, create, test for all their new successful motorcycles, uses indian low grade employees as low skilled drones to reproduce the work of British company, "manufactures\' in india then, assembles &amp; sells as Royal Enfield similarly appealing to \'desi\' emotions on indians.\n\nTATA motors simply acquires Jaguar, European Technical Centre PLC, TRILIX SRL, Marcopolo Motors etc companies from around the world, uses their developed platforms, designs, research, ideas to produce \'cars\' and then labels them TATA &amp; appeals to emotional indians with their larger than life altruistic stories spread in Media &amp; Social Media.\nMakes huge profit using indian employees as lowly skilled drones in assemble lines.\n\nSame story for indian software companies, Wipro, Infosys, KPIT, HCL etc.\n\nHero Motocorp, Bajaj, TVS all are still using engines designed by Japanese companies like Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, Yamaha etc.\n\nSo, the moral of the talk is --- all the colourful story of high GDP, high economic growth, high manufacturing, Trillion dollar economy, world super power --- all these are simple lies unless R&amp;D is happening in india, unless india is leading with actual brainpower like Israel, Dutch etc does.\nTill then you are just a manufacturing hub, whenever america &amp; Europe wants they will replace india with bangladesh, vietnam as manufacturing hub(which is already happening).'<br />Author: 'sanchak'  id: 'ptsmoc'<br />Score:90<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ptsmoc/indian_corporates_accelerate_indias_braindrain/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Over Religious Mom with declining Mental and Physical Health'<br />Body: ' \n\nHi,\n\nThis is very personal to me but I want to share this because it is now increasingly affecting me.\n\nMe and mom live alone (I work from home since covid), Dad is in the gulf, and my sisters are married.\n\nLast month was shravana so she fasted every Monday and made me a vegetarian for the whole month. I did not want to confront her so I went ahead with it. Within shravan there were certain other days like Saatam, Athama, Janmastmi, teej, etc so apart from fasting on every Monday, she also fasted on these days.\n\nEverytime she fast, she wants to go to a temple a few km away from our house, to see a pandit who sits there and perform some pujas, yagnas. Before covid, I was in a different city, so she would either go with her friend or alone, using ola or auto rickshaws. now, since I am here, I have become her ferry for any where she wants to go. Apart from that from last few months she has started another routing of visiting another temple, about 600 m from our house, and she has trouble in her knees so she insists I take her there every evening.\n\nnow, from last few days, the new month is called "Shradha" where we are supposed to please our ancestors. She is now forcing me to go and feed cows every morning so that the food reaches our ancestors.\n\nOver and above, she gets easily irritated and feels over burdened with all responsibilities. When I tell her half of the things she does (all the religious activities) she can let them go and have more free time on her hands. She does not even keep maid for household chores, because she is a clean freak and is never satisfied with maid\'s work. Everytime I request any maid in neighbourhood to help my mom, the maid stays for at most one month and then runs away because my mom keeps pestering them to do things better.\n\nMy mother is increasingly becoming sensitive and hostile to any criticism, and she stubbornly is sticking to her religious duties as well as works to the bone to keep the house clean. I am a freelancer with my own client base and mostly stick in my room working on it, which pisses her off as well. She tells me I never help her with anything and always stay confined in my room which couldn\'t be further from truth. I don\'t know how to deal with her anymore and I cannot leave as well because there is marked decline in her physical and mental capacity that I have noticed for over past few months.\n\nPlease suggest what I should do, or how I can convince her to be less religious so she can relax and try to enjoy a good life.'<br />Author: 'desi_raman'  id: 'ptpmmy'<br />Score:48<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ptpmmy/over_religious_mom_with_declining_mental_and/</li>

      <li>Title::: "[Discussion]- Caste based reservations are not valid in today's age, and how might we possibly rebel against it?"<br />Body: ' People might be quick to say "caste system is equality of opportunity not outcome", but a seat in an IIT/AIIMS ***is the outcome.*** Your whole life depends on whether you made it in a GFTI, or a GFMC, tell me that\'s not an outcome.\n\nRead [This](https://www.edexlive.com/news/2021/aug/09/dropouts-in-indias-iits-nits-more-than-60-per-cent-of-them-are-sc-st-or-obc-finds-study-23150.html). I literally cannot bear someone with literally 12%ile less than me, cannot cope up with the pressure now, and ends up occupying a seat just because he has a "certificate", dropping out in 2nd year.\n\nI\'m all for **Income Based Reservation,** but you have to get the same marks as everyone here.\n\nDo you want to be treated by a doctor, who got into med schools with substantially lower marks?\n\nLet me tell you, It\'s a flawed system that breeds nothing but mediocrity.\n\nBy offering reservation through relaxed entry criteria, we are fueling inflation of moderate credentials as opposed to the promotion of merit based education system, which is the foundation of many progressive countries. Meritocracy should not be polluted by injecting relaxation of entry barriers, rather should be encouraged by offering financial aids to the underprivileged although deserving candidates only.\n\nCaste Based Reservation only perpetuates the notion of caste in society, rather than weakening it as a factor of social consideration, as envisaged by the constitution. Reservation is a tool to meet narrow political ends. (Read, Vote Bank politics)\n\nWhich leads to another point- Poor people from “forward castes” do not have any social or economical advantage over rich people from backward caste. I\'ll give you an example- My neighbour happens to be one of the prime real estate developers in my state. I\'m talking hundreds of crores. But, he also happens to be an SC. As a result, his son was able to get an admission in my city\'s Gov. Med Clg with relative ease to say the least.\n\nI, technically belong to an ST (later OBC), but after my family lifted itself out of "bad financials", we discarded the use of our ST tag. It\'s very simple, once we became affluent, it was unnecessary to misuse the provisions of the Constitution.\n\nA combination of factors like Wealth, Income, and Occupation etc. will help to identify the real needy people. Most often, only the economically sound people make use of most of the seats reserved for “back\xadward” castes, thus making the aim a total failure.\n\nThe most important is by creating this caste-based reservation system we are automatically supporting the anti-secular bearings. I will elaborate it for you, we usually see that there is a strong anger for the reserved caste-group by non-reserved or semi-reserved caste group and vice\xa0versa. So, this creates unwanted trouble in the society which results into a\xa0nuisance in the democratic country which is exactly opposite to the basic principles of reservation system. Reservation system came in action to create equality between all the castes, creeds and religions but it is affecting society in exactly opposite way.\n\nNow, IIST, a premier Aerospace institution in India, has nearly 64.5% reservation, add to that, no concept of projcet, creativity based admission. I think we have the reason for ISROs recent slow pace and failure. /s.\n\nI do intend to draft a letter to the PM, get it digitally signed by as many people as possible, highlighting how this very system is the reason for a massive brain drain from the country. How we cant blame our education system, when teachers with trash marks are allowed to teach, just because they belong to a "disadvantaged sector". A student who lost out on the basis of reservation, now is a high earning grad from Harvard, Berkeley, Yale, all because they seek merit and not your "birthright".\n\nThank you for listening. Ngl, the way Modi is playing this game legit is starting to make me dislike him a bit.\n\nLet\'s keep discussions civil, and remember, capitalism is the answer. meritocracy or nothing. I might jump into politics with drastic reforms, just to see how masses react to revolutionary ideas.'<br />Author: 'Fragrant-Treacle7316'  id: 'ptn03t'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ptn03t/discussion_caste_based_reservations_are_not_valid/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The new trend of gut biome/functional medicine, how the American food and pharma industry brought in the diabetes and autoimmune epidemic, and how Ayurveda was right all along.'<br />Body: '###The dawn of functional medicine after the exposure of sugar lobby-medicine journals nexus\n\nWe all know the west has already appropriated upvasa and pranayama and dhyana as intermittent fasting, mindful breathing and minfulness. Now the new fad is the gut microbiome.  You see, for the better part of the last 60 years, medical research and its publications ware highjacked and closely vetted by the food and pharma lobbies in the USA. They said that fat was bad for you.  Saturated fat was even worse. But it never ever insulted sugar or carbs for some reason. Because of this there is a clear misconception of what constitutes as a good diet in USA which is then parroted by people all around the world even back here at home. \n\n\nWhat they do not know that even the surgeon generals of the USA have been unclear of what a really good diet is supposed to be. Now that doctors are really waking up as they start suffering from problems themselves, these American doctors are now starting a branch of medicine called "functional medicine". This is basically a type of practice where every patient is looked at as a unique entity. Rather than clumping together symptoms into one general condition or disease, the doctors are now evaluating patients more carefully, properly listening to the whole problem and most importantly- they are now looking to solve the CAUSE of the problem, rather than just resolving the SYMPTOMS, which has been the standard procedure in medicine until now.\n\n\nThis has lead to many improvements because antibiotics usage is frowned upon and is only prescribed if absolutely necessary.  And the most important development is that this branch of medicine acknowledges the importance of the GUT BIOME on the health of an individual. \n\n\n###What exactly is the gut biome?\n\n\nGut biome is a combination of bacteria, fungus and viruses that work for YOU inside your intestine. \n\n\nThey are a mind boggling **100 trillion in number**. That means they outnumber your body cells by 10. That means there are more gut bacteria in you than there are cells OF you. \n\n\nThey regulate your immune system, take care of your digestion and basically have a very close bond with your brain to take care of your body. It\'s being called as your SECOND Brain because of te plethora of tasks it performs.\n\n\nDysfunction of this gut biome is responsible and is linked to diabetes, autism, dementia,  psoriasis, eczema, ibs, and many more diseases modern medicine is absolutely useless against.\n\n\nThis gut biome is now the star of the functional medicine bandwagon  and the doctors now focus on getting the balance back into the biome and thus the body.\n\n\n###How Ayurveda has been prescribing improvements in diets to bring about well being overall -\n\n\nThis is all fine but this is EXACTLY what ayurveda has been propagating for a better part of two thousand years.\n \n\nAyurveda does not look at symptoms but looks at the dosha,  or the cause that is making the symptoms. It says that any person is a combination of kapha, pitta and vata. I am not going to go into details because it is not my place. But the point is that the focus of the ayurveda doctor is to bring these doshas into balance again. If you have "too much heat", which means that your digestive system is taxed due to heavy and rich foods, a lighter diet is prescribed and medicines that consist of herbs that will help your gut digest better will be prescribed. \n\n\nA major part of Ayurveda is focused of diets. The sattvik diet is known as a good diet because it is easy on your digestive system and is known to propagate good health and good mental well being. \n\n\nCompare this with the way medicine has been dealing with autoimmune conditions. For example a case of inflammatory bowel disease AND a skin disease like eczema are treated the same way - by giving steroids. Which makes the problem even worse by directly affecting the gut bacteria.\n\n\nThis is the number one reason Ayurveda and Homeopathy are still so popular today. Because they intend to look at the patient as a unique entity that has a problem that is unique to that body. They also look at the cause rather than the symptoms.\n\n\nAs this new fad of "functional medicine " will get even more famous, they will start heavily borrowing from ayurveda, because it has been for bringing balance into the body for millennia. \n\n\nRemember how they even demonised ghee for being fattening? Because it was purely saturated fats? Papers upon papers published about the evils of saturated fat.\n\n\nNow they come to know that it contains essential omega fatty acids and vitamins that propagate good health and a healthy gut biome.\n\n\nThere was a research published in the USA where the author said that 94% of all type 2 diabetic patients can reverse their disease in just two years if they cut out sugar and processed carbs. This study was shunned by the media over there completely. Even though the country reels in a diabetic epidemic.\n\n\nBack at home, where diabetes is slowly gaining a foothold, we need to get back to our roots and harness the knowledge of ayurveda to bring about a positive change in health across the population. The AYUSH is doing a decent job, but needs to do better by training better ayurveda doctors and homeopaths. \n\n\nWe need to bring some urgency into the issue because even India, which never dealt with nut and tree and dairy allergies is now dealing with them on an increasing number. These allergies are supposed to be linked to a leaky gut where a complete part of the microbiome is dead on the intestinal wall, which then absorbed undigested food which then invokes a immune and inflammatory response by the body. This is alarming. A place where peanut allergies was unheard of is now dealing with them because of the trend of American diet of highly processed junk food for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

      <li>Title::: "South India is India's Achilles's Heel and China knows it. This is where China will defeat India - Part 1"<br />Body: 'Warning: Long read. Some might be offended. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel stupid writing this. I have written this four/five times and each time I discarded it because it feels stupid. I have no military background, no idea about defense strategies, not much idea about our military or China\'s military strength and not much geopolitical knowledge to write this. But, I keep having this recurring dream and the more I think about the dream the more it looks like a possibility. I hope you guys tear my argument to pieces, so that I can sleep peacefully. So here goes nothing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImagine this Scenario\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe year is 2027. India has just celebrated its 80th Independence day. After some minor border skirmish in Ladakh and Arunachal region, China mobilizes its military to Indian border. India also mobilizes but it goes slowly and border clashes starts. After couple of weeks of clash and when India has fully mobilized its army to Northen and eastern border. Chinese troops along with Sri lankan troops lands in Rameshwaram, south India. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReading this, you might think, it will never happen and I am wasting time in reading this. But if you could hear me out, I will try and explain why this is how China will defeat India. Before I tell you, why, when, where and how the war will happen, I will explain my views on China, Sri lanka and India. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChina\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo simply explain Chinese diplomacy in two rules its, "Never give anything, Take everything" and "Never leave strong position and make the enemy disengage from its strong position". Chinese have followed these two rules in everything. From business where they never opened the Chinese market but allowed western companies to dilute itself by associating with Chinese companies, to trade where they never reduced trade imbalance and made them dependent on Chinese goods, to border dispute where they never backed down from the advantage position. Even in recent border clashes, they made us withdrew from positions where India was strong like Pangong lake. But Chinese are still occupying positions where they are strong like Depsang plains. Chinese never truly reveal their intentions. Nobody really knows what China is upto and what china will do. But we can say for sure China is for China only. Nothing else matters. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSri lanka \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSri lanka and India has always had love-hate relationship. From Indira days where she trained and armed LTTE, to Rajiv days of IPKF and current events of RAW involvement in Sri lankan elections. To Sri Lankan establishment especially the Rajapaksas, India is always a potential enemy. Sri Lanka is also currently under debt trap of China and they will go into even deeper debt when the 15 billion dollar Colombo development project goes into full swing. But it is not the worrying part. What is worrying is Sri lanka has one of the largest, battle tested and modern army compared to its Size/population. For a population of 21 million they have an armed force strength of 350,000 personnel. They rank 13th in Active personnel size. For a country with no threat, its a strong army. Even their military budget has doubled in peace time after the last war in 2008. To sum up, Sri Lank has a dictator President with his family members in all positions, its economy in ruins, inescapable debt trap and has a Strong military. Sure sounds like a disaster in waiting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIndia\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhether we like it or not, BJP has lots of anti incumbency right now and it will increase by 2024. And our economy is not in strong position. There is a chance that we might have a weaker BJP government with coalitions or a even weaker Congress government UPA 3 on 2024. Right now, Most of our Military budget is spend in salary and pensions. Also due to Chinese border mobilization last year and this year we have spent more in operation cost than capital expenditure. Even though we have a strong and experience and dedicated military, we have equipped them with decades old weapons. During Balkot strikes, we didn\'t even have secure communication radio for our pilots and even now we have to go to UAE for mid air refueling for Rafael aircraft. Our Jawans sacrifices has kept us safe so far. But it might not be enough. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSaying all this, now let me go back to the Why, When, Where and how of the war. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has taught Chinese and the world something. Even when the entire world economy collapses due to pandemic, the Chinese economy did not get affected. And China now controls the worlds supply of finished goods. Chinese know that soon the entire world will wish to change this. Even right now, the world sees India as china\'s backup where India and other southeast aisa countries can become worlds factory. The world is looking at Taiwan, Korea and Japanese for chips and electronics goods. This is not acceptable to Chinese for obvious reasons and China has proved twice (2008 and 2020) that it can withstand world economic downturn. Based on this, China knows it has to do something to stop this. China has ambitions, it has to get  a strong military, it had to have a strong economy and Xi is not going to give up his seat. So the only way all these can be achieved is by keeping the worlds factory in China. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow lets take a step back and see what CCP is doing to achieve this.  We know that CCP does not do anything that hurts CCP or do anything that leads to people questioning the CCP and we know that CCP does not do something without any reasons. So why all of a sudden the CCP is hell bent on destroying the Chinese economy? First they came for tech groups, then edutech groups and now they are going after real estate groups with their three red line rules? China is also flooding the commodities and oil market with their strategic reserves. Why does China releases its reserves to open market? Why are they pulling down the commodities and oil market down?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts economy stupid. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the surface it might look like Chinese have gone mad but they are not mad. This is where they hide their true intentions. The obvious answer everyone will say is Xi is consolidation power, he is fearful of tech companies gaining knowledge or he is fearful of tech entrepreneurs gaining stardom, he is purging potential competition Or china is trying to control spiraling debt etc. These are all the surface answers but if you join the string, you will come to the conclusion that Chinese are trying to orchestrate a global economic downturn. But why, why are they shooting themselves in the foot? Its because by shooting themselves in the foot, they are shooting their enemies in head. Remember coronavirus downturn? Who emerged stronger after all the pain and suffering? The Chinese... And they are going to do it again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have to understand that Chinese always plays the long con. Nothing is obvious until they reveal the con. Nobody really know why the Chinese are doing this, until the last moment or until its too late. For example, in late 2019 Chinese government had quietly started stockpiling masks and PPE from other countries and in 2020 Jan there was a mad dash by Chinese diaspora in all countries for supplying mask and PPE to china. The sino-vac vaccine preliminary trails started in Feb 2020, when the world is still learning about Covid.  Similarly Chinese are preparing for this downturn from 2019. So from 2019 they have started selling Chinese companies debt bonds to US and western markets and increased the western market exposure to Chinese market. Today the US exposure has gone from \\~70 billion in Chinese bond in 2017 to \\~500 billion in 2021. Chinese firms listed in US are close 1.5 Trillion in market cap in late 2020. Global investment into Chinese stock market is close to 800 billion. In short the world got greedy and China is ready to dump us. What happens everything evaporates? We are looking at the largest wealth transfer from other countries to Chinese in world\'s history. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCollapse the economy and make enemies/allies weaker.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChinese knew coronavirus will affect world economy expect theirs. They are also know that if Chinese bond market and stock market collapses the world will get affected more than their own economy. The Chinese downturn is coming and Chinese are trying to soften the blow to their own economy by suppressing commodities and oil prices and increasing manufacturing and construction. Initially the Chinese economy will take a major hit (just like 2020 during pandemic) but soon they will recover. But, by the time other countries wake up, they will deep in economic downturn. Initially the CCP will allow this go on, till it started affected the world\'s economy and they will start recovery activities only when its too late for other countries to do anything.. The coronavirus has already caused India and US economies to go down and go into debt. The upcoming downturn will cause even further miseries to ours and world economy. It will make Sri Lanka weaker, it will make Pakistan even weaker and both the countries will further get trapped under China and both will do whatever China says... And once all this economic downturn is done and dusted, the Chinese will emerge stronger than ever before in a weakened world in 2024-2025.. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn this weakened world, the Chinese will have to prove that they are the big daddy now. What is bigger proof than swiftly and utterly defeating India, the worlds second largest and fourth strongest army? It will showcase the Chinese strength, Strategy, military might to the world. It will signal to Americans clearly that China is now the TOP dog. To everyone saying You cant defeat the worlds second largest army, I would say refer to Iraq in 1990 and Polish army in 1939. In both cases they were the fourth largest army at the time and both were poorly equipped with outdated and insufficient weapons. Both army were defeated within weeks by modern smaller army with newer weapons. Remember, India has no military alliance with any country in the world. No one is coming for our help. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf we don\'t learn from history we are doomed to repeat it.. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen, where and how continued later..'<br />Author: 'sco_black_scorpio'  id: 'psf1vy'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/psf1vy/south_india_is_indias_achilless_heel_and_china/</li>

Sidhu\'s Pak Connection out/NK Sood, Ex-RAW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdx0d3SDkkw)\n\nWhat is the role of Pakistan in the sacking of C.M Amarinder Singh in Punjab? Well, arms and ammunition coming in from Pakistan daily using drones. These drones carry weapons, granades, ~ 50k rounds of ammunition. The Punjab CM met Home minister and Prime Minister to seek help to counter these drones a few weeks ago. Did the congress think this is political. And is this why congress fired Amarinder? There is something more going on here.\n\nDr Subramanian Swamy tweeted today \n\n&gt;First new initiative after Pakistan secured Afghanistan was to take Chinese help to try and take over Punjab, using people like Farida Ataullah, TDK was persuaded to remove Amarinder from CM post since he is the obstacle to Pakistan in Punjab. Now Pakis will set fire in Punjab.\n\n&gt;Who is Farida Ataullah? She is in nexus with Sonia Gandhi weather it is Idols business or being a facilitator. To understand more about her, we need to read a letter that Dr. Subramanya Swamy written to the then PM Dr. Manmohan Singh on 10^th Dec, 2010. Though this is on 2G scam, he has written about Farida in some context. He says " I also draw your attention to the baneful influence of Farida Ataullah, a pakistani with dubious connections. During the tenure of Benazir Bhutto at the time, she was close friend of Sonia Gandhi for decades. So much so, that she was a guest of honor at a select gathering of wedding of Priyanka. She is based in Dubai and coordinates all kinds of nefarious activities in and out of India. Perhaps because of her influence, an important member of the core group of congress party called the mumbai and maharastra police officials to a suit in oberai hotel after 26/11 terrorist attacks and directed that indian collaboration in 26/11 should not be probed and ignore pakistan\'s complicity.\n\nAll these facts put together paint a grim picture of the national security scenario in the country.'<br />Author: 'ennis-jahsiah'  id: 'pracvg'<br />Score:47<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pracvg/national_securitysree_iyer_on_pakistans_role_in/</li>

No, it\'s terrible news.\n\nWhy?  Because it\'s achieved through Modi\'s policies of import substitution  (i.e. using Nehruvian  economics - increasing Custom Duties to decrease  imports)\n\nHow does it matter how it\'s achieved as long as it\'s reduced, right? If that\'s true, then **we were doing fabulously till 1991 - when imports were just 8.49%**  of our GDP. Our imports never crossed 10% of GDP ever in the  pre-Manmohan Singh era (pre-1991). Nehru would have been proud of how  Modi is taking us back to our Nehruvian years of very low imports.  Manmohanji was a bloody fool of an economist to open up our market  internationally &amp; take away our low import rates of our pre-1991  years.\n\nWhy is it bad to reduce imports based on import substitution rather than on actually improving the country?\n\nBecause  it\'s not an isolated system - policies have 2nd &amp; 3rd order effects  - most of these effects which India knew about very well about in it\'s  fully socialist years till 1991.\n\nLet\'s see a very important effect of decreasing imports through protectionism &amp; increasing customs duty. **India\'s exports as percentage of GDP has also decreased from 25.43% to 18.08%** in the Modi years.\n\nIndia\'s Imports &amp; **Exports** as a percentage of the GDP\n\n|Type|1991|2013|2020|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Imports|8.49%|28.41%|18.39%|\n|Exports|8.49%|25.43%|18.08%|\n\nAs  we see in the table above, when Imports are reduced by artificially  strangling them with protectionist policies which aim to protect local  inefficiencies, our exports also go down. And this is not a surprise, we  have seen it through India\'s history till 1991. In each year in the  table above, see how close Import &amp; Export percentages are.\n\nIn  7 years, our commie-in-chief has raised import duty &amp; tariffs on  practically everything - this is what lead to decrease in imports -  imports didn\'t decrease because our products became better or cheap. It  decreased because our products became "cheaper" than foreign products  because of Nehruvian protection - ergo our locals can be inefficient,  most wasteful &amp; still be market winners - but they will be worse off  to compete in the international market &amp; we do see that. It\'s the  same thing which happened till 1991.\n\nSince  2014, India has been very reluctant about Free Trade Agreements, even  those they signed they have signed very reluctantly. On the other hand,  Vietnam over this same period has embraced every FTA they could find.\n\nThis is an excellent 2018 article on Vietnam - [https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/09/how-vietnam-became-an-economic-miracle/](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/09/how-vietnam-became-an-economic-miracle/)\n\n&gt;It  wasn’t always thus. A mere 30 years ago, Vietnam was one of the poorest  in the world. How did this southeast Asian nation grow to become a  middle-income country?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Growth  under the Vietnames government’s subsequent five-year central plans was  anaemic. By the mid-1980s, per capita GDP was stuck between $200 and  $300.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It  has embraced trade liberalization with gusto. The analysts point to the  various free trade agreements Viet Nam has signed in the last 20 years.  **The cumulative effect of all  these agreements was to gradually lower the tariffs imposed on both  imports and exports to and from Viet Nam**.\n\nVietnam exported 0.9 Billion$ of mobile phones in 2009. In 2020, they exported **31.2 Billion$ of mobile phones** \\- as compared to **3 Billion$ for India**. A small country, Vietnam, exports 10 times as much mobile phones as India. Vietnam exported **122 Billion $ of electronic goods as compared to 12.8 Billion $ by India**.  Vietnam\'s total Electronic Goods exports are 10 times as much as  India\'s. Their imports have also increased but does it matter - the  country is prospering unlike us. They are the new Asian Tiger. **Anyone who wants to move out of China, their #1 choice is Vietnam**.\n\nIndia  was also on the same path from 1991 on - transforming from one of the  poorest countries. But Saala Nehru\'s disciple has fuckin put a brake on  it &amp; is taking us back.\n\nReposting  some data I had covered in an earlier post many months back about  India\'s abysmally bad export performance under Modiji.\n\nThis is how India\'s exports performed under different terms\n\n* **Exports grew at an average of 17.92% each year during UPA**\n* **Exports grew at an average of 1.89% each year during Narendrabhai**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Term|Average Yearly Growth rate|\n|:-|:-|\n|UPA1|26.04%|\n| UPA2|10.32%|\n|Combined UPA|17.92%|\n|**Narendrabhai**|**1.89%**|\n\nWorld  Export Growth crashed during both UPA2 &amp; Modiji\'s term. But as a  developing country/emerging economy, we were never competing with the  world export figures. As an emerging economy we were expected to do much  better than the world exports (developed nations &amp; also very  backward nations don\'t have much growth so they always pull the world  figures down).\n\nFor e.g. in UPA2  also world exports growth rate had gone down from earlier highs. But  even during UPA2, India\'s CAGR growth rate was nearly 3x times of World  Exports CAGR. Now, under Modiji our CAGR is not even 2x of World Exports  CAGR.\n\nSeveral countries with Good Governance are performing far better in exports than both India &amp; the World.\n\n|Country|CAGR|Cumulative|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Modiji**|**1.89%**|**11.88%**|\n|Burma\\[1\\]|14.36%|95.6%|\n|Ireland|12.18%|99.31%|\n|Vietnam|11.81%|95.35%|\n|Cambodia|8.6%|74.2%|\n|Bangladesh|7.95%|58.21%|\n|Phillipines|6.23%|30.40%|\n|Sri Lanka|4.29%|28.64%|\n\n\\[1\\] Only 5 years data is available for Burma as compared 6 for other countries\n\n**Atmanirbhar Bharat through Nehruvian Protectionism &amp; Tariffs is taking us back to 1991**\n\nSources\n\n* [https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.IMP.GNFS.ZS](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.IMP.GNFS.ZS)\n* [https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.EXP.GNFS.ZS](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.EXP.GNFS.ZS)\n* [https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IND/india/exports](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IND/india/exports)'<br />Author: 'One-Raspberry1877'  id: 'pr3t2h'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pr3t2h/i_read_this_post_on_some_other_subreddit_can/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] AUKUS pact, Russian elections, and book review of The Exile'<br />Body: 'Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Geopolitics Thread, the place where we discuss all the latest events from around the world. Discussion does not have to be related to India. Please share your thoughts and interesting news articles in the comments. Here are a few to get the conversation started:\n\n# Top Stories\n\n1. [AUKUS pact changes strategic picture in Indo-Pacific](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2021/09/15/auukus-pocus-china-focus-494341)\n\nIn a sudden announcement that caught the strategic community off guard, US President Joe Biden joined the PMs of the UK and Australia to announce a new strategic alliance - AUKUS - that would see the US and UK transferring nuclear-propelled (but not nuclear armed) submarine technology to Australia. With this, Australia would become the third Quad member, after India and the US, to possess nuclear-propelled submarine technology, potentially giving it a range well into China\'s littoral waters as well as the vast southern Indian Ocean. The move was condemned by China, Malaysia, and Indonesia as the start of a new arms race in the region, while Singapore welcomed it. France also condemned the deal for commercial reasons - Australia cancelled a $100 bn conventional submarine agreement with France\'s Naval Group. France has recalled its ambassadors to the US and Australia in protest, and has called it a stab in the back akin to Donald Trump\'s foreign policy. Biden will host an in-person summit of Quad heads of government, including PM Modi, next week.\n\n2. [US admits its killed civilians, not ISIS-K](https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-calls-deadly-kabul-strike-an-error-25e2b83a9a0ae9a95d1aac71fe5f4ca7)\n\nDuring the last days of the Biden administration\'s shambolic retreat from Afghanistan, the US claimed to have a foiled an attempted suicide bombing by ISIS-K after a drone attacked and destroyed a car. This week, the Pentagon admitted that it was a mistake - the car was full of innocent civilians, including seven children. The US Defense Secretary and several top officials in the military have issued an apology and are considering paying reparation payments to the affected families. Meanwhile, the Taliban continues to clamp down on women and freedom in the country, with the governor of one province announcing that girls will only be able to study till Class 7, after which they are legally old enough to be married off and produce babies. \n\n3. [Massive Chinese real estate company on the brink of collapse](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/17/china-developer-evergrande-debt-crisis-bond-default-and-investor-risks.html)\n\nThe world\'s most indebted property developer, Evergrande, which makes apartments and commercial buildings in 280 major Chinese cities, is on the brink of collapse. With a debt burden of $300 billion - more than Pakistan\'s GDP - the company has struggled with declining sales in the past few years. Worse, new Chinese rules that limit the amount of debt that real estate developers could carry, a move supposedly aimed at making housing more affordable, has caused the company to run out of capital and unable to pay even interest. Banks have stopped extending loans to homebuyers of Evergrande properties. The Chinese government is expected to intervene at some point to avoid a massive ripple across China\'s already over-leveraged banking system.\n\n4. [Google, Apple take down Russian strategic voting app](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/09/apple-and-google-cave-to-putins-censors-block-navalny-app-as-election-begins/?amp=1)\n\nElections to Russia\'s Parliament - the Duma - are underway, and allegations of foreign election interference are running thick and fast. Russia\'s main opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, is in jail and his party is largely banned from contesting. However, they came up with an innovative app, also named Navalny, that enables voters to unite against any candidate in their constituency in a bid to defeat candidates from President Putin\'s United Russia party. Call it strategic voting, but it has caused the Russian government to threaten to jail the heads of Google and Apple in Russia, calling the app election interference and a violation of Russian law. The companies took down the app, leading to criticism from the opposition for the companies succumbing to Putin\'s threats. \n\n5. [Iran becomes SCO member](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210918-iran-looks-east-after-china-led-bloc-oks-entry)\n\nIn a meeting of the members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, the members decided to admit Iran into the security grouping of which India and Pakistan are also a part. This is a rare move by Iran, which has historically been a western-looking civilization. The admission to the organization, which is largely led by China and Russia, comes as Iran failed to make any headway with the Biden administration to ease up on crippling sanctions imposed on it by the previous Trump administration. In his speech to the organization ahead of the vote, Iranian Pressident Ebrahim Raisi condemned US sanctions as "economic terrorism" and called for a more multilateral world order.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Book Review: The Exile\n\n*The Exile:  The Stunning Inside Story of Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda in Flight* \n\nBy Adrian Levy and Cathy Scott-Clark \n\nPublished by Bloomsbury in 2017\n\nLast week, the US marked the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, when Al Qaeda terrorists hijacked commercial planes and flew them into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, missing the third target, the US parliament building (capitol), because of brave passengers who forced the last plane to crash land. 3,000 people died in one day from the attacks, after which President Bush launched the War on Terror with the invasion of Afghanistan. That invasion ended earlier this month.\n\nIn the long arc of America\'s Afghan War, many lives have been lost and many stories written. But one that remains mysterious to this day is that of the architect of the chaos: Osama bin Laden. Born into a wealthy Saudi family, he rose to be the face of Islamist terrorism, then virtually disappeared off the face of the earth, emerging intermittently in slick propaganda videos, and finally meeting his humiliating end in the Pakistani garrison town of Abbottabad. In this well-researched and fast-paced book, journalist couple Adrian Levy and Cathy Scott-Clark pushed the curtain back from those mysterious years when bin Laden seemed to have turned into a shadow.\n\nThe book is rich in detail, but I will only highlight three events here that stood out for me. In the run up to what was being called the "Planes Operation" i.e., 9/11, a large part of Al Qaeda\'s council, or *shura*, was opposed to it. The opposition stemmed from both the indiscriminate killing of people as well as the sure wrath that it would bring from the US. Al Qaeda had been forced out of Sudan and hounded by the Gulf monarchies, but they finally had a stable base in Afghanistan. Not only was the *shura* opposed to it, so was the Taliban, with Mullah Omar having regular arguments with bin Laden about their stay in the Emirate. Bin Laden however was adamant, so much so that the Planes Operation was organized in secret even within Al Qaeda to fend off opposition. That only left Mullah Omar - how could the Taliban leader be convinced to continue to give shelter to Al Qaeda despite the inevitable US pressure? Bin Laden ordered the execution (by suicide bombing, then still a novel technique) of the Taliban\'s greatest foe: Ahmed Shah Masood of the Northern Alliance in Panjshir. Omar now owed bin Laden and, sure enough, refused to give him up to the US after 9/11. That brought the US into Afghanistan, and we know how that ended.\n\nThe second story is that of bin Laden and his stay in Pakistan (and his humongous family of four wives, many children, and those teenage children\'s children... I lost track of who is who). The story of bin Laden\'s escape from Tora Bora into Pakistan\'s Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) is well known, but he got a little help from Jaish-e-Mohammed, which launched an attack on the Indian Parliament to move Pakistani troops away from their western frontier and thus give bin Laden a way out. This brings us to the theme of the relationship between Al Qaeda and Pakistani terrorist groups, and ultimately the ISI. Perhaps the most prominent Pakistani involved in 9/11 was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM), who is currently standing trial in Guantanamo Bay. He was a major force in co-opting Pakistani terror groups to save bin Laden, moving him to safe houses in Peshawar and Karachi, before he ultimately built the house in Abbottabad. The question for everyone is whether the ISI knew. The thing about the ISI is that it is not a monolithic organization - every directorate within it is a little fiefdom unto itself, mainly because it is still very much a desi bureaucracy. Most independent of all is the S-Wing, which is responsible for managing the Islamist terror groups. The ISI director and the S-Wing are removed from each other, partly for the aforementioned bureaucratic reasons and partly to give the former plausible deniability. Then there are the freelance retired ISI officers who run their own private operations - none more so than Hamid Gul, who most certainly had a hand in bin Laden\'s safe haven. Another actor was Ilyas Kashmiri, a terrorist in Indian Kashmir who worked for the S-Wing but defected to Al Qaeda to launch attacks on Pakistan itself, including revenge attacks after the US killed bin Laden. It is difficult to see through this mess, but all evidence suggests that the main ISI and the Army did *not* know about bin Laden\'s whereabouts - although what they would\'ve done if they did know is another matter. I\'ll leave it to you to figure out what that says about the ISI\'s capabilities and the image it creates for itself.\n\nThe third and final story is about an actor that we in India don\'t think much about - Iran. The Islamic Republic without nuclear weapons has historically been a western-looking civilization, while we in India were the eastern-looking one (the Indus river being the border). But in many ways, Iran and Pakistan are similar in that they both use terrorism as state policy albeit against different targets. While bin Laden and many members of his family found safe haven in Pakistan under the radar of the Army and the main ISI, many in the Al Qaeda leadership, including several of bin Laden\'s sons, were kept in Iran by the elite Quds Force (al Quds is the Arabic name for Jerusalem) of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). Unlike the Pakistani operation, which was based on low level connections and unmarked safe houses with poor electricity and water, the Iranian operation was led by none other than Qasem Soleimani, the most powerful general in Iran who was later assassinated on the orders of Donald Trump. The Al Qaeda refugees were kept well, much better than those in Pakistan, with water, electricity, entertainment, visits to the mall, apartments with their families, shopping trips... everything but the freedom to move about outside of their golden cages. Why did the Quds Force give refuge to Al Qaeda? Naturally, to use them as a bargaining chip against the US. This arrangement was initially resisted by Iran\'s civilian leadership, but after Bush\'s disastrous speech at the UN calling Iran as part of an "Axis of Evil," Soleimani had his way. But the Al Qaeda prisoners knew that they were pawns, and a handful did escape from their guards, warning others not to come. This is why bin Laden stayed put in Pakistan despite the fear of US drone strikes in that country. To this day, it is believed that many of those Al Qaeda refugees remain imprisoned in Iran, to be used whenever they are useful. Perhaps the most famous of them who is speculated to be trapped in Iran is Dr. Ayman al Zawahiri, the Egyptian leader of Al Qaeda who fled Pakistan\'s FATA after bin Laden\'s capture. But that is speculation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What stories caught your attention?

Choosing the language is completely upto the student.\n\nFrom class 6th to 8th (or to 12th, for extended studies), a north Indian child would have to learn English, their regional language and a North-Eastern or South Indian language. Similarly, a North-Eastern would have to study either a North Indian or South Indian language **&amp;** a South Indian student would have to study either a North-Eastern or North Indian language.\n\nPros\n-\n\n- This *may* further integrate India and unify us even more. The North-eastern states which are so alienated from the main land India will become more connected this way.\n\n- You can get a job *more easily* in the state where your 3rd language is spoken, if your qualifications are good.\n\nPossible Cons\n-\n- Students of South Indian and North-Eastern states only opt for studying Hindi, the most spoken language. Which means, South Indians **might** not choose a North-Eastern language.\n\n- Similarly, North Indians **might** also not choose North-Eastern languages and instead, opt for a South Indian language.\n\n- Thanks to this policy, North-Eastern states start feeling more alienated and start demanding a separate country (kind of an exaggeration but it's possible)."<br />Author: 'SixIsNineWithoutS'  id: 'pqjb2y'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pqjb2y/would_you_support_my_language_integration_policy/</li>

Obviously, my dad denied their offer and that's why I am writing this (my highest percentile in mains is 98.7 and others were 96.6, 97.6 and 97.8 if you wanna know) and I believe that this is wrong and we should do something about it.\n\nI tried searching for the number, from which my dad received the call, but it doesn't exist anymore, or else I would have posted it here or told the police or NTA about them.\n\nPlease, if you guys can make this post come to the notice of other people, it would be very good and if I can help in any way to stop this, I will be more than happy to help.\n\nYou can DM me any questions you want to ask my dad, I will ask him by evening and reply to you guys.\n\nPS: I am not trying to farm Karma, this is actually real and I would love to help if we students get some justice. Because it's now not only about Mains but also Advance (as they told me they would get me admission in IIT Bombay).\n\nEdit: Mods please don't remove it. It's important that people can come to know, specifically the higher authorities.\n\nI am not on Instagram but if someone can screenshot this and tag NTA or some other officials on other social media, it would be really helpful. I have a good rank but still, this is unfair."<br />Author: 'EVILLORD225'  id: 'pqchd1'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pqchd1/so_i_posted_regarding_the_jee_mains_scam_on/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'My observations on common perceptions surrounding the Mughal Empire'<br />Body: 'The following is a listing down of some statements and assertions associated with the Mughals that I have seen quoted often online, sometimes their source is Wikipedia, or sometimes, wishful thinking. This is simply an attempt to analyse their veracity and draw conclusions based on the sources at my disposal and my own abilities. \n\n\n&gt; Aurangzeb expanded the Mughal Empire to 4 million square kilometres in the south and ruled over a population estimated to be over 150-158 million subjects with annual revenue of $450 million in 1690.\n\nSo this figure actually needs to be called into question because it makes absolutely no sense based on the evidence available to us. May this serve as a cautionary tale, don\'t use Wikipedia as your source for history, you will be a victim of misinformation or outdated information. So now, let\'s get down to business shall we? Before we do, remember, I\'m merely trying to update outdated perceptions and counter some misinformation that have become widely accepted as fact online. I shall first give a rough, yet more accurate estimation of the Mughal revenues under Aurangzeb.\n\n\nAccording to Bernier (1660-1665), out of a list of 20 provinces the total revenue of the Mughal empire was Rs. 22,59,35,500 or for Western audiences Rs. 225,935,500. These are silver rupees. More on that later. For now let\'s take an account of our sources. Now, Bernier made a clerical error of omitting a zero from the revenue of Kashmir and recording it as Rs. 350,000 instead of 3,500,000. Accounting for this error the total revenue now comes out to be Rs. 22,90,85,500 or Rs. 229,085,500. Or let\'s take a round figure of Rs 23 crore or Rs 230 million for convenience.\n\n\n* Constable, Archibald (Transl.), *Travels in the Mogul Empire, A.D. 1656-1668 by Bernier, François, 1620-1688*, p. 455-460.Oxford University Press. 1916\n\n\n\nAnother source, the *Malumat-ul-Afaq* (written at some point between 1707-1715) gives the revenue of 19 provinces, as 9,241,716,082 dams, which is nothing but Rs. 231,042,902 (1 silver rupee = 40 dams) and 2 dams. Once again, for convenience, let\'s take a round figure of Rs. 23 crore or Rs 230 million. Also, to keep in mind, out of this, only Rs. 4.5 or Rs 45 million went to the *Khalisa-i-Sharifa*, which is the revenue from the Khalisa lands, the rest being the salaries for the *Jagirdars*.\n\n\n\n* Aziz, Abdul. *Imperial Treasury Of The Indian Mughals*, p. 100-101. Abdul Aziz, Lahore. 1942.\n\n\n\nSo, now we have two sources, both claiming a figure of roughly 23 crores or 230 mils, however, there\'s the question of acquisition of new territory between 1665 - 1707/1715. Here, the territories we are taking into consideration are as follows Bijapur, which was conquered in 1686 and Golconda which was conquered in 1687. Therefore, 1691 or thereabouts, can be treated as the largest extent to which the Mughal Empire may have stretched. So now the question is why did revenues not increase in proportion? Let\'s look at the fact that between 1627-1660, a period which was relatively peaceful as compared to the latter half of the 17th century, the revenue increased from 17.5 crores to 22 crores (from 175,000,000 to 200.000,000). It therefore, becomes understandable why constant war, economic degradation, and stagnation, over the period from 1670-1690s was responsible for this stagnant revenue figure. With all that said and done, now let\'s go back to a point made previously.\n\n\nThis rough Rs. 23 crores, is 23 crores in silver rupees. Now normally, I would compare wages, grain wages etc to draw an actual comparison between contemporary and present day economic standards, let\'s ignore nuance and hardwork, since that won\'t be necessary to bust this myth. The quoted figure under Aurangzeb is $450,000,000. Remember a Mughal Rupee was 10-11 grams in weight. We\'ll take 10 grams for convenience. \n\nSo, Rs.230,000,000 becomes 2,300,000,000 grams of silver. Or 2300 tons of silver. Let\'s take the modern day price of a gram of silver (this really isn\'t prudent, but just for the sake of it, let\'s go through with the exercise) which is Rs. 63/gram and multiply this with the above figure in grams and you get the following equivalent in modern day rupees, Rs.14,490,000,000 ( **Note : Not adjusting for inflation** )\n\n\nLet\'s, now divide this by 73, which is the value in rupees of $1 USD, today, and we get $1,984,931,506. Or simply $1.9 billion. But, this by itself, doesn\'t reflect the postion of the Mughals compared to other powers (neither does it reflect the conditions of the landed peasantry and the landless masses). On Wikipedia, it says\n\n\n&gt; He (Aurangzeb) had an annual yearly revenue of $450 million, more than ten times that of his contemporary Louis XIV of France.\n\n\nSo, we know that the figure quoted isn\'t true on the face of it. What about the comparison? Well, the following are the revenue figures for France in 1715?\n\n\nAccording to the *Historie Financiere* Vol 1, by Marrion, pp. 63-65, as quoted in *Banking on the King: The Evolution of the Royal Revenue Farms in Old Regime France* by Noel D. Johnson, the entire tax system of France was able to produce 165,000,000 livres a year. Now, in the year 1710, a livre was worth 0.38g in gold. This gives us 62,700,000g of gold. It would be far too crude I suppose to compare prices of silver and gold, and understandably so, here\'s a conversion of gold to silver based on the value of gold in the time period, which is 15g to 1g. Therefore 62,700,000 g of gold is 940,500,000 g in silver. Or 940 tons in silver. Again, converting to modern day prices for silver gives us Rs. 59,251,500,000 and dividing by 73 ( $1 USD = Rs 73) we get $811,664,383 or $811 million. ( **Note : Not adjusting for inflation** ) \n\n\n\nThis above figure by the way, is ignoring the fact, that the French economy enjoyed the added value of a middle class, and the ability to raise funds, far in excession of their revenues, to meet necessary expenditures. As an example, after the death of Louis XIV in 1715, it was revealed that the government had a total debt of 2 billion livres.  Compare this to the tributary nature of the Mughal state, which stagnated to the extent that credit to the central government was absent or negligible, and social and economic and administrative institutions hadn\'t seen much change for more than a 100 years.\n\n&gt; He expanded the Mughal Empire to its greatest extent, subsuming most of the Indian subcontinent under a single imperial power for the first time in human history\n\n\nI guess Mauryans, and The Guptas didn\'t exits? What\'s "most"? Even the Mauryan Empire subsumed "most\' of the subcontinent under a single Imperial power. This statement is rather vague. And it\'s claims are highly doubtful. \n\n&gt;He made lasting contributions to the interpretation and exercise of legal codes and was renowned- by people of all backgrounds and religious stripes-for his justice\n\n\n**The discriminatory policies of Aurangzeb :**\n\n\n1)The pilgrimage tax was re-impised.\n\n\n2) Bernier tells us that at the time of an eclipse of the sun, a sum of three lacs was paid to the state.\n\n\n3) The Holi ceased to be celebrated by Imperial orders issued on 20th of November, 1665.\n\n\n4) On the 10th of April, 1665, it was ordered that the custom duties on Muslims be fixed at 2.5% throughout the Empire, and at 5% in the case of the Hindus.\n\n\n5) On 9th of May 1667, orders were issued totally forbidding the levy of custom duties tax on the Muslims, being reimposed only on 1682.\n\n\n6) Further the tax on the produce from gardens was realised at the rate of 20% from the Hindus and 16.6% from the Muslims.\n\n\n7) In 1669-1670, it was ordered that in a lunar year, the Muslims should pay 2.5% on the price of the cattle as tax, while Hindus 5%.\n\n\n8) Minting charges were also differed in 1682, 2.5% for Muslims and 5% for Hindus.\n\n\n9) Jizyah, again, this may seem like a common feature of Islamic monarchies but in the context of the Mughal Empire, it\'s reimposition is a clear departure from any progress made by Akbar in the direction of reconciliation, integration and tolerance. \n\n\n* The Religious Policy of the Mughal Emperors by Shri Ram Sharma\n\n\nIn conclusion, there\'s very little evidence to show, that he was respected, by people from all religions or backgrounds, for any reason whatsoever. \n\n\n\n&gt; Aurangzeb\'s imperial bureaucracy employed significantly more Hindus than that of his predecessors. Between 1679 and 1707, the number of Hindu officials in the Mughal administration rose by half, to represent 31.6% of Mughal nobility, the highest in the Mughal era.[33][63] Many of them were Marathas and Rajputs, who were his political allies\n\n\n**The argument of Hindu officers :**\n\n\nIt is rather odd that we ignore the gross increase in the number of officers under the reign of Aurangzeb, while trying to assess his employment of Hindu officers in his beaurocracy/nobility. By merely analysing the gross increase of total number of officers there is no appreciation for the fact that in real terms the value of offices and postions that the Hindu nobility was granted under Aurangzeb had depreciated considerablly. The inflation in the total number of Hindu officers is a result of the influx of the Marathas, who weren\'t recruited out of a concern for religous tolerance or integration, but rather due to the practical necessity to employ local chiefs, to facilitate smooth conquests of the Deccan. Between the period of 1658-78 according to M. Athar Ali, in his *"The Mughal Nobility Under Aurangzeb"* : **The number of Rajputs began to go down in this period and continued to go down in the next**. \n\n\nYes, numbers and percentages increased in the lowest grades. And while absolute numbers increased in the upper grades, the percentage of total number of officers went down. His "pragmatism" of recruiting the Marathas was a result of the latter **"practically forcing their way"** in the words of M. Athar Ali, into the Mughal service. \n\n\nAfter the death of Jaswant Singh, Hindu nobles rarely held a Subehdari. Jai Singh, after years of service in the Deccan and the invaluable service of capturing Shivaji was, yet, upon Shivaji\'s escape, his son was accused of aiding the Maratha King, his estates were siezed and he was sent to die in the east in a hopeless campaign. Jai Singh himself was accused of aiding his son, he was neither laid for financing his campaigns which he funded out of his pocket, nor was he compensated for his efforts.\n\nHis "pragmatism" should more aptly be called reluctant and suspicious delegation of authority, revoked at the first opportunity which presented itself.\n\n\n&gt; Richard Eaton, upon a critical evaluation of primary sources, counts 15 temples to have been destroyed during Aurangzeb\'s reign.[94][88] Ian Copland and others reiterate Iqtidar Alam Khan who notes that, overall, Aurangzeb built more temples than he destroyed\n\n&gt; Modern historians reject the thought-school of colonial and nationalist historians about these destruction being guided by religious zealotry; rather, the association of temples with sovereignty, power and authority is emphasized upon\n\n\n\n**Destruction of temples, non-Muslim places of worship and education :**\n\n\nThe following is an order, drafted by the provincial governor of Orissa, after he had been given orders to issue the same by Aurangzeb :\n\n\n*To all the fojdars, garrison commanders, accountants, district collectors of land revenue and the officials from Cuttack to Midnapore in the frontiers of Orissa.*\n\n\n*The Imperial Bakshi Asad Khan had sent a letter written according to the instruction of the emperor to say that the emperor learning from the newsletters of the province of Orissa that in the village of Tilkkuti in Medinipur a Temple has been built, has issued his august mandate for its destruction and the destruction of all temples built anywhere in the province. Therefore, you are hereby to command with extreme urgency that immediately on the receipt of this letter you should destroy the above-mentioned temples. Every Temple built during the last ten or twelve years should be demolished without delay. Also, do not allow the Hindus and infidels to repair the old temples. Reports of the destruction of Temple should be sent to the court under the seal of qazis and attested by pious shaikh.*\n\n\n* Recorded by Muraqat-i-Abul Hasan, completed in 1670, by Maulana Abul Hasa, quoted in Sarkar, Jadu Nath, History of Aurangzeb,Volume III, also in Last Spring: The Lives and Times of Great Mughals by Abraham Eraly\n\n\n*“When the imperial army was encamping at Mathura, a holy city of the Hindus, the state of affairs with regard to temples of Mathura was brought to the notice of His Majesty.

Lokhandwala, Baroda, 1965, P. 194\n\n\n* Elliot and Dowson, in their volume 7 on page 184, on their translation of Ma\'asir-i-Alamgiri by Muhammad Saki Musta\'Idd Khan, note the following –\n\n*“On the 17th of Zi-il ka\'da 1079 (18th April 1669), it reached the ear of His Majesty protector of the Faith, that in the provinces of Thatta, Multan and Benares, but especially in the latter foolish Brahmins were in the habit of expounding frivolous books in their schools, and that students and learners, Musalmaans (Muslims) and Hindus, went there, even from long distances led by a desire to become acquainted with the wicked sciences they taught. The ‘Director of Faith’ consequently issued orders to all governors of provinces to destroy with a willing hand the schools and temples of the infidels; and they were strictly enjoined to put an entire stop to the teaching and practicing of idolatrous forms of worship. On the 15th of Ra\'bi-ul-Akhir it was reported to His religious Majesty, leader of the unitarians, that in obedience of order, the Government officers had destroyed the temple of Bishnath at Benares.“*\n\n\nIn the same text, Ma\'asir-i-Alamgiri by Muhammad Saki Musta\'Idd Khan, again, we find the following -\n\n\n*"On the 7th Muharram Hasan Ali made his appearance with twenty camels taken from the Rana, and stated that the temple situated near the palace, and one hundred and twenty-two more in the neighbouring districts, had been destroyed. This chieftain was, for his distinguished services, invested with the title of Bahadur.\nHis Majesty proceeded to Chittor on the 1st of Safar. Temples to the number of sixty-three were here demolished.\nAbu Turab, who had been commissioned to effect the destruction of the idol-temples of Amber, reported in person on the 21th Rajab, that threescore and six of these had been levelled to the ground."*\n\nAlso, these, as quoted/interpreted by Jadunath Sarkar :\n\n\n*On 14th October, 1666, learning that there was a stone railing in the temple of Keshav Rai, which Dara Shukoh had presented to it, Aurangzib ordered it to be removed, as a scandalous example of a Muslim’s coquetry with idolatry. And finally in January 1670, his zeal, stimulated by the pious meditations of Ramzan, led him to send forth commands to destroy this temple altogether and to change the name of the city to Islamabad. Ujjain suffered a similar fate at the same time. A systematic plan was followed for carrying out the policy of iconoclasm. Officers were appointed in all the sub-divisions and cities of the empire as Censors of Morals (muhlasih), to enforce the regulations of Islam, such as the suppression of the use of wine and bhang, and of gambling. The destruction of Hindu places of worship was one of their chief duties, and so large was the number of officers employed in the task that a “Director General” {darogha) had to be placed over them to guide their activity*\n\n\n* History of Aurangzeb, Volume III, p. 281\n\n\n*"The temple of Somnath was demolished early in my reign and idol worship (there) put down. It is not known what the state of things there is at present. If the idolaters have again taken to the worship of images at the place, then destroy the temple in such a way that no trace of the building may be left, and also expel them (the worshippers) from the place."*\n\n\n* Letter of Aurangzib in the last decade of his reign. Quoted in History of Aurangzeb, Volume III, p. 295\n\n\n\nColonial era histriography being used to claim that primary sources are obvious examples of exaggerated claims made by court histrians to glorify their rulers, is true in the sense that it argues for the disregard of absolutely absurd claims made by certain medieval court historians who made claims such as  "*millions of kafirs were killed, enslaved*"\n\nHowever, behind every exaggeration there is a fundamental true thing, which occured. This event, however exaggerated, remains true, and that cannot be brushed aside.\n\nLets take the example of the primary sources I quoted. Are the numbers quoted here an exaggeration? If yes, there must be some evidence to claim that these numbers are exaggerated, since the onus to prove that they are the same, lies on those who deny this evidence, not on those who use it to present a picture of Islamic rule as it was recorded by its own historians.\n\nTherefore, complete rejection of primary sources recorded in later Persian histories of the 17th and 18th centuries, as exaggerations, or as simple fantasy for self-aggrandisation, is stretching the previously conceded point that medieval historians exaggerated figures.\n\nSince the claim that that hundreds of thousands of people were lost in a battle where the same numbers could not have been brought forth, is an obvious exaggeration, this is confirmed by simple analysis of the population of any region in the time period, but also by reading the statement with the slightest bit of skepticism. \n\nHowever, the claim that 251 temples were destroyed in the war agianst Udaipur, can\'t be refuted as such on first glance, and unless someone conducts the research to disprove it thoroughly, claims of its exaggeration are unfounded.\n\nA pattern of exaggeration can\'t be extended to all recordings of history in the period in Persian. Since then we would be in a situation where the claims of Ferishta, would be placed on the same weighing scale as those farmans which dictate and record the exact numbers of temples destroyed by order of Aurangzeb.\n\nI think it\'s a case by case basis. Ofcourse, primary records should be studied with the idea of exaggeration in mind, but, there shouldn\'t be preemptive disregard, unless such research or evidence exists as would disprove the claims being made. Also, it\'s ridiculous to draw a comparison between temple destruction by Hindu kings and idol destruction, temple destruction and desecration by Islamic monarchs. The nature scale is incomparable.\n\n\n\nI have quoted my sources wherever necessary. I have provided my observations as well. For the most part, the post is meant to provide some context to statements that are erstwhile quoted online quite often without any enquiry into their veracity. My observations are my own, and while I appreciate readers who go through them, I hope people use this post to place some of these claims in their context, instead of quoting them blindly. Criticism is most welcome.

Often, I have observed, they follow the Pakistani narrative: that Islam came to India and \'civilized us\' and that we were a barbaric mess before Islam invaded India.

      <li>Title::: 'An unbiased opinion about Hindutva.'<br />Body: 'First, little info about my background which validates the unbiased part of title to a certain degree.\n\nI was a muslim. Now I am an Atheist and I dislike all religions equally.\n\n1.HINDUTVA\nNow, comming back to the topic. Hindutva, the elephant in the room. My opinion about it is simple. It is a big NO NO. You know why, because I have observed it and analysed it in full action. But in Islamic Version. How dare you compare Hinduism to Islam, you ignorant ass? Our Sanatan Dharma is nothing like terrorist religion. You might say.\n\nBut, here why.\n\nHinduism is a religion. Hinduism is okay. But Hindutva is a weaponised version of Hinduism. No, that is not right. It is a tool to weaponise Hindus by people who want more power.\n\nWhen a religion is only used as a religion, it is okay. But when it is politicised, boy does it make some fireworks fly.\nIslam is so violent. Why? Because politics is in its scripture. It dictates every part of your life. From sex to ecocomy, everything. That\'s why it is so sensitive, that\'s why it is so violent sometimes. Well, most of the time. Because it is engrained in your day to day life and an attack to it, is an attack on your existence.\n\nThese so called Hindutva leaders are trying to Islamify Hinduism. Make it part of your identity which you are willing to die for in the process of defending it.\nIn these recent years Hindutva has gained a lot of traction. But has crimes against Hindus decreased? No. Have crimes done by so called muzlims decreased? No. Infact, violence increased across the board.\n\nAnd the  other thing that increased were votes for both Hindu and Muslim extremists parties. And donations  to religious and political organizations.\n\n\n2. SECULARISM\n=&gt;Leftist Secularism\n\nNow coming to secularism, which was also mentioned in the previous post. Yes, I fucking hate these pseudo seculars of India, they praise Islam for no reason and go after Hinduism without a valid argument. They are not seculars at all. They are brain dead individual at best and sellouts at worst.\n\n=&gt;Right wing Secularism\n\nOnce in an interview, Yogi Adityanath was asked what will happen to people of other religion under a hindu rastra. His reply," They will all be treated as equal as a Hindu". Isn\'t that secularism we are talking about?\n\nThis here sums up the problem perfectly. One claims secularism doesn\'t work and others claim it does. But both are wrong in their definition, which is one of the reason we see secularism fading in India. We don\'t even know what it means.\n\n\n3. What is the solution to Muslim problem of India, in my opinion?\nWe all can agree that there are certainly problems in India relating muslims. Terrorism, forced conversion, communal violence,etc. But the question is how do we tackle it? \n\nIf you think it can be solved through Hindutva, you are dead wrong. If radical Islam is fire, then Hindutva is the oxygen. And trust me when I say this, the more you poke Islam, the worse it gets.\n\nThe more Hindutva grows, more Muslim preachers and terrorist recruiters will radicalise Muslim youth, more communal incidents happen, more anger amoung hindutva groups. This visious cycle had already started.\n\nTake the example of Cow vigilantes. They are radicalised just like a muslim is, to believe that the life of cow(a different species) is more important than a fellow human. They kill a muslim who is transporting beef, this story is used to radicalise other Muslims who then go on to take part in communal violence.\n\nHow can this cycle be stopped? I am not an communal violence expert but what comes to my brain is by telling both sides to calm the fuck down. By reducing the influence of religion on our lives and teaching the nations youth rationality and critical thinking. \n\nOne might argue, it is wishful thinking and I am afraid they might me right. The solution may not be this simple.\n\nHindutva, if it does succed in solving the problem, it will be either by establishing an authoritarian regime or through genocide. \n\nThe former is the most likely outcome, but you know what? It is not the Hindu utopia you so dearly desire for, it will be the ruling class supported by the ultra rich to suck everything out of you to benefit them.'<br />Author: 'VeganStalin'  id: 'pp7p3r'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pp7p3r/an_unbiased_opinion_about_hindutva/</li>

In his case, the alleged National-Socialist connection ofSanskrit is heavily over-interpreted and emphatically taken to be causal, as if the interest inSanskrit has caused the Holocaust. We verify the claims on which he erects this thesis one byone, and find them surprisingly weak or simply wrong. They could only have been made in aclimate in which a vague assumption of these links (starting with the swastika, which inreality was not taken from Hinduism) was already common. Yet, even non-specialists couldeasily have checked that Adolf Hitler expressed his contempt for Hinduism, repeatedly and inwriting. Pollock’s attempt to even link the Out -of-India Theory with the Nazi worldview is thediametrical opposite of the truth; it was the rivalling Aryan Invasion Theory (which Pollockhimself upholds) that formed the cornerstone and perfect illustration of the Nazi worldview.This linking could only pass peer review because of the general animus against Hinduism andIndo-European indigenism in American academe.

A sense of achievement while there have been instances where he had to borrow money to fulfill his obsessions. He feels insulted in front of the construction workers and says I’ve caused shame. Wtf is shame when literally 30-50k is leaving our family every month. How can I put and end to this obsession. He refuses to sit down and cool his heels and enjoy his life.

There should be some check done on Judiciary, considering previous erratic, and even so wrongly Motivated Judgements. \n\nIn my opinion, the appointment of Judges should bore Transparent and should be subject to approval of atleast one house of the Parliament.

      <li>Title::: 'Is there a possible connection between Maharashtra and Eastern Africa?'<br />Body: 'The reason I\'m asking this is due to the naming convention of Maharashtra. A good number of Maharashtrian surnames (with the suffix -e) are also found in Africa.\n\nFor example: Jericho Shinde (Zambian footballer). Alejandro Balde (Footballer of Senegalese origin). Sadio Mane (Senegalese). Other last names like Kale, Kode, Bunde, etc.\n\nNot only are the last names similar, but identical. Even some of the most Maharashtrian last names that exist, like Shinde, are related to tribes in Eastern Africa. \n\nOn [https://forebears.io/](https://forebears.io/), a surname database, many surnames that end in the "-e" suffix are shown to be prevalent in both Maharashtra and Africa.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question is, did Africans perhaps settle in Maharashtra before the "Dravidians" and "Indo Aryans" did? I don\'t think anyone in India looks too similar to Africans, so maybe they got mixed, but if anything Maharashtrians usually do have thicker hair or some other features. But I\'m starting to doubt that it\'s a mere coincidence that so many Marathi last names are found in Africa. It\'s really interesting.\n\nMarathi surnames have always been distinct from other Indian ones. Btw, this doesn\'t apply to Konkan based surnames ending in "-kar". This for "-e" suffix ones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd before anyone tries to say I want to be African, first of all, I\'m not even Maharashtrian so there.'<br />Author: 'viksuper123'  id: 'poem2i'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/poem2i/is_there_a_possible_connection_between/</li>

Also been seeing some peeps on twitter boycotting against Hindi being the national language. Is it not good to have an indigenous language that is understood all over the country? (Unlike English, because it has no tradition in India whatsoever and Hindi has been THE language of the masses in the freedom struggle, partially due to the population of hindi speakers being large, and maybe not widespread or "everybody knows it" use of Hindi)\n\nI understand that many people in the southern parts are not brought up in a Hindi environment, and they feel alienated when a majority of content is in hindi. But wouldn\'t that be the same if we were to have no national language? Wouldn\'t then every state\'s content need to be translated to every other states\' languages?\n\nI am a native gujarati speaker and I never learnt Hindi till the age of like 5-6. Still, seeing this amount of hate towards such a beautiful and elegant language hurts my soul. (Given the fact that it is VERY easy to learn, unlike dravidian or romantic languages (I may be trippin here)). One more topic I\'m confused over is why people are confusing Hindi with Urdu? I\'ve seen some say "Bollywood gave Hindi it\'s glorification" or "Hindi is useless everybody like Urdu" on some online forums.\n\nThis isn\'t a hate post/satirical post at all, it\'s just a lost soul looking for answers. I really wanna know why people are getting offended over Hindi. Is it that the schools over there are forcing people to learn Hindi (which IS in fact wrong, it should be their choice whether they wanna learn it or not) or is it people just being pseudo-secular over languages?\n\n(also I dunno if this post follows Rule no.2 and 4, I really couldn\'t find a neutral sub to discuss this.)\n\nThanks! :-)'<br />Author: 'Intezard006'  id: 'pobasb'<br />Score:58<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pobasb/whats_up_with_all_the_hindi_hate_that_im_seeing/</li>

People around me have been suggesting me to do a normal graduation and take a part time job and then prepare for govt jobs. I understand their POV and that would totally be a good step considering my situation right now but if I go in that direction, everything I've built in the last 2-3 months as an artist, I'd be ruining all of that progress and my potential chances to succeed in art.\n\nBut even working as a freelancer artist is very uncertain, you don't know when you'd get projects and when you could remain without a work. Whenever someone buys my artworks, I get anxious about when would be next time someone buys my next work, so I can pay my bills.\n\nI want to get into BFA or B.Des somewhere, but I don't know where I should take admissions and whether I can afford it or not.\n\nSo I have two choices now, abandon my passion and interest and go for the conventional route to secure some stability in life, or do what I really want to, but I could end up wasting years if I fail to do anything.\n\nWhich path should I take now?

      <li>Title::: 'Indians need to know why prepaid mobile recharges have skyrocketed recently'<br />Body: 'Unless you\'re a 5 year old kid, you must remember that incoming calls were absolutely free even as recently as 2018. That\'s when VI (then Vodafone and Idea) and Airtel made it mandatory to have a small monthly recharge of Rs. 26 per month to retain incoming on a prepaid number. This "small" recharge then increased to 35 and 45 some time later and now it stands at about 80. All this happened just in a matter of 2-3 years!\n\nAnd to make matters worse, they even removed "outgoing sms" facility from most minimum recharges after they realized that this is often used for things like UPI verification and other things. Now, the minimum recharge if you want outgoing sms is no less than Rs. 200 - which obviously comes bundled with data and voice too whether you need it or not (I\'m sure this would be an anti-trust matter or something if this were the US).\n\nNow, the reason why this keeps happening is clouded in some mystery. Most people just blame "the government" for this but if you go into some detail (where the devil lies!), you\'ll find that this has something to do with mounting "AGR dues on spectrum" from these companies to the govt. The obvious question that arises is why do these dues keep mounting and mounting to the extent that telcos are forced to apply these pathetic tactics that hurt their customer\'s pockets? To understand this in detail, you\'ll have to understand how spectrum itself is priced in India (and why it is so unfair), [this video by Shekhar Gupta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h6EtSXGRlY) titled **Collapse of Vodafone-Idea, how Govt of India scripted its telecom debacle** explains this perfectly.\n\nThe whole mystery can be traced back to mid 2000s when 2G spectrum was first auctioned in India (A Raja and 2G corruption scandal which nobody in Delhi wants to talk about on either side of the political aisle!). This was the time when the rules to impose license fees for specturm use on telcos were defined by the telecom ministry and these rules were way too unfair by any standards (as Shekhar talks in his video).\n\nFor example, the license fees (or AGR) is calculated as 10% of the yearly profits earned by the licensee on EVERYTHING it does. That means if VI or Airtel has earned an income from any of their allied or non-telecom source (like selling or renting a property), even on that the AGR dues will apply! Even govt. owned corporations like Power Grid Corporation of India and Delhi Metro (which have nothing to do with telecom) keep paying (or at least accruing) 10% as AGR dues to govt. on account of an odd radio signal or wireless equipment they may have ever used.\n\nAn obvious question that needs to be asked here is what exactly is spectrum and why its usage should incur such high costs when there are only 3-4 market players in the entire telecom industry? And guess who is paying for these excesses? It is us common people of India as increased tariffs on our bills and recharges!\n\nChallenging this AGR dues tariff structure is nearly impossible as Shekhar says because nobody wants to disturb this arrangement and the support for this is across the political spectrum (pun intended!). The least we Indians can do is be aware of what the problem is and make each other aware.'<br />Author: 'learned_cheetah'  id: 'pnid5p'<br />Score:40<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pnid5p/indians_need_to_know_why_prepaid_mobile_recharges/</li>

I am in no way saying that they should be killed, but effective policies and actions should be implemented to counter the problems that arise with stray animals :\n\n1. Life for the animals isn't fun. They often suffer from starvation. And with their population rising, the fight for the limited food available increases too. And unfortunately they are also subjected to abuse by some vile humans. Some people beat these animals for fun, some to take their frustrations out and horrifyingly so some even sexually violate them. A reduced population thus can be better fed. And if we can take them off the streets, the human abuse part can also decrease.\n\n2. They also create a lot of filth. Some people do feed stray animals regularly but still most of them rely on exploring trash cans for food. In process they create a lot of filth. Also they shit on the streets, esspecially cows and buffaloes. And this doesn't just only ruin the aesthetics of the city, it is also a public health hazard. There are lots of pathogens in animal faeces, that can easily infect humans too. \n\n\n\nWhat can we do about it?\n\n1. Government should support various NGOs working for animal rescue and then they can effectively control the population by prevention of breeding. Also there are millions of citizens who would happily support such causes. We can have separate cattle shelters too (which some hindu religious institutions might also support) where the cows and buffaloes can be well fed and they can sell milk products for local consumption and exports as well. \n\n2. Stricter punishment against animal abuse is required. \n\n3. People should be taught to clean up after their pets. But this is more of a personal responsibility, rather than government.\n\n\n\nDoing these things can make lives of animals and humans better."<br />Author: 'devansh_-_'  id: 'pnbdfb'<br />Score:97<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pnbdfb/we_need_population_control_for_stray_animals/</li>

Doesn't that says all....what happened so very bad, so they have to close their factories....no its never about money....they are American companies they are cash rich.\n\nIs this a myth about Make in India dream, which is failing badly now, this is in term giving very bad motivation to investors or big businesses to set up anything in India.\n\nDon't you think how bad it is; its like ripple effect, almost 4000 jobs associated with ford will go. With this 4000 job roles another 40, 000 to 3lakh people who were directly or indirectly associated with ford will looses their jobs means the jobs of those workers like ford dealer sales man, office attendant, ford dealers losses, those technician, mechanics....etc. \n\nAll these closing of factories doesn't point towards health economy of a country. Look at those countries like south africa, Zimbabwe in news all the investors, businesses are running away from their country....their is so much divide in rich and poor... Is our country India is moving towards thoses country economy like south africa, zimbawae??\n\nPlease do share your opinions if I missed any such points.."<br />Author: 'maxspartacus'  id: 'pmoex3'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pmoex3/ford_closing_its_factory_in_india_says_much_about/</li>

      <li>Title::: "How are God's different from current superheroes in movies/comics?"<br />Body: "Idk if I'm an atheist or not. I like the idea of God and like listening to Bhajans, prasad, and simple things around it like the culture. But I hate the extremists who use these god's names to perpetrate violence.\n\nSo I have been thinking about this(I don't have knowledge of any religious text, Vedas, Upanishads, Quran or whatever is there, etc, that's why I'm asking) like how we have current comics showing some powerful humans helping the world, and making it a better place to live. All the knowledge about gods comes from religious texts and some archeological scriptures or their temples/churches/mosques etc. But we also have comics in place for this, for scriptures we have places in Disney World where we have their statues and all.\n\nSo if there's a possibility to blackout the flow of information for even 100 years, I could easily present current superheroes as gods and present evidence in the form of comics and statues. And it was so easy back in around 1000years coz people didn't have any way to verify or any better to know it.\n\nSo basically what propagates your belief that god's existed back then, and we are currently carrying their legacy/culture.\n\nIt's in no way an attack on your belief, I'm just curious about this and don't have time to read all the religious texts and books.\n\nGanpati Bappa Morya!!

      <li>Title::: 'Why is Hindutva compared to Nazis, Taliban and the American Right wing? We are not the historical oppressors like they were, but quite the opposite, we are the oppressed.'<br />Body: 'Recently it has become quite popular to compare BJP/RSS to Nazis (Not just Indian liberals, but the Pakistani Prime Minister himself has compared BJP to the Nazis several times).  Some more moderate types prefer to compare BJP with the American Republican Party (Which likes painting itself as a victim even though they literally kept blacks as slaves)\n\nThis narrative has spread to the west, and now most western liberals see the Muslims as a poor minority, historically oppressed by the Hindus. Records of historical oppression of Hindus, Jains and Buddhists are seen as overblown and exaggerated.  Scholars like Romila Thapar and Audrey Trueshke aren\'t helping either. \n\nIn their minds the majority community almost always oppresses the minority, so they can\'t wrap their head around the fact that the opposite has happened in India for the past 1000 years, first with the Muslim rulers, then with the British. \n\nHowever, I find this comparison of Hindutva to Nazis and Republicans really disingenuous.  Jews or Blacks did not rule over the white majority for centuries. European Christians were not forced to pay taxes for following their religion.  Their churches were not burned down by  Blacks and Jews.  In fact it was the opposite. Black culture was destroyed by their masters, and most of them converted to Christianity.  Jews were convenient scapegoats for the rulers of the time and were routinely genocide and cleansed.  \n\nNONE OF THIS HAPPENED TO MUSLIMS OF INDIA.  MANY OF THESE THINGS HAPPENED TO HINDUS, YET, WHY ARE MUSLIMS PAINED AS VICTIMS, AND HINDUS OPRESSORS?\n\nDo you know what turned me from someone who didn\'t give a fuck about Politics in general, from a "Hindu Muslim Bhai Bhai" guy, to someone that hates Muslims and their very existence in India? \n\nAnswer - ***The Temples.*** \n\nI\'m a Jain dude from Rajasthan. Whenever I visited some ancient Jain temples, I always found that they were desecrated in varying degrees by (you guessed it right).  The idols that weren\'t beheaded were stolen. All the beautiful carvings of figurines were disfigured beyond recognition.  I just felt very...sad. Why did this happen? We are the most peaceful people in the world, all we want is living with \'ahimsa\', why did these barbarians do this? What did they gain? \n\nI cannot capture the true extent of the destruction of Indian temples, and the persecution Indian religions like Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism faced.  I\'ll just link some articles -\n\n[This one accurately represents how I feel](https://openthemagazine.com/cover-stories/where-did-the-temples-go/)\n\n[This article published on the diplomat is one of the most neutral one I have found on the topic](https://thediplomat.com/2016/08/indias-hindu-right-is-correct-about-one-thing-indias-muslim-rulers-did-destroy-hindu-temples/)\n\nAlso look up the persecution of  [Hindus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus) in India.  Even in post independence India there have been more massacres and bombings of Hindus by  Muslims than vice versa. \n\nAs I read more stuff, I came to know about the concept of Kafir and the sin of  Shirk. How Hindus, Buddhists and Jains are seen as idol worshippers, how Kafirs are seen as the sworn enemies of Islam.  I came to despise religions like this, who condemned me to eternal hell just because I did not follow their god. Indian religions didn\'t have this kind of concept, for example  Jainism treats all it\'s followers and non-followers equally. Only your karma and good deeds decide your fate.\n\nI was sad that some Muslims saw me as their sworn enemy just for being a Kafir. Still, knowing all this, I wasn\'t really angry at Indian Muslims as a whole. Most of them were just normal people who wanted to live their lives. \n\nNow comes the part that makes me REALLY angry.  The real reason that I\'m this radicalised. \n\n**MUSLIMS LEADERS PAINT THEMSELVES AS VICTIMS. THEY, ALONG WITH \'LIBERALS\' DOWNPLAY AND SOMETIMES STRAIGHT UP DENY THE GENOCIDE AND PERSECUTION DONE BY THEIR ANCESTORS AND CALL US INTELORANT. "*****ULTA CHHOR KOTWAL KO DAATE*****"**\n\nArticles like this make my blood boil -\n\n[https://scroll.in/article/769463/we-will-never-know-the-number-of-temples-desecrated-through-indias-history-richard-eaton](https://scroll.in/article/769463/we-will-never-know-the-number-of-temples-desecrated-through-indias-history-richard-eaton) ( Hindutva ideologues claim that 60,000 temples were demolished under Muslim rule.

The democratically elected government of Modi-ji is now being compared to the Taliban. LMAOOOOOO.  \n\n[https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/north-africa-west-asia/the-talibans-return-contains-a-warning-for-india/](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/north-africa-west-asia/the-talibans-return-contains-a-warning-for-india/) (Muslim writer)\n\nEven Javed Akhtar, who pretends to be progressive, compared RSS to Taliban in his recent video. Even the enemies of BJP, Shiv Sena, were offended. \n\n[https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/shiv-sena-unhappy-with-javed-akhtars-comparison-of-rss-with-taliban/article36318880.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/shiv-sena-unhappy-with-javed-akhtars-comparison-of-rss-with-taliban/article36318880.ece)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, someone might ask - ***The persecution was committed by their ancestors, modern Indian Muslims have nothing to do with this. Why should they pay for the crimes of their  ancestors?***\n\nA similar question is raised by some Non Dalit Hindus, who ask that "Why are seats still reserved for Dalits even though untouchability was made illegal more than 700 years ago".\n\nThe answers the same is similar. Dalits are still woefully unrepresented in many areas, and because of their historical oppression are still poor and uneducated compared to UCs.  Making caste based discrimination did not erase the historical wrongs against them. \n\nApply the same logic to Non-Muslim Indians.  Just because Muslims no longer rule India does  not mean that the ancient temples and idols they destroyed will magically come back. The women who were raped by the invaders and forcefully converted to Islam will never get their dignity back. The ashes of the women and children who committed Johar rather than become slaves won\'t turn alive. \n\nThe Hindus/Buddhists/Jains who converted because they were too poor to pay Jizya, they (or their descendants) won\'t ever turn back to their ancestor\'s religions.\n\n Our society will always retain it\'s trauma, with the destroyed temples, desecrated idols, looted wealth, and stories of the barbarity of the invaders, serving as the remainder of our humiliation and slavery.\n\nAfter all this, how are we supposed to accept Muslims as victims?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**To be clear, I don\'t want the Indian Muslims of today to spay or suffer for crimes they never did.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, **What do I want?  What does the average BJP supporter want from today\'s Muslims?**\n\n# Acknowledgement, Acceptance and Repentance. \n\nLook at the world around us. The white westerners (except the alt right) are rightly apologising for the crimes committed by their ancestors. The Canadians are apologising for the mass graves of native American children hidden by the catholic church. Americans study the genocide of native Americans extensively. \n\nStatues and monuments in the name of racist politicians, genocidal kings, slave traders were pulled down all over the world. Their names re-written in history, their crimes taught to all. \n\nWhy is the same not happening here? Why are Muslims and Liberals silent on this?\n\nWhy are the mosques that were clearly built on Hindu, Buddhist and Jain temple allowed to stand? Why are cities/roads still named after people who cleansed us?  Why is their history glossed over and whitewashed?\n\nGenocide denial like this must go - \n\n[https://thewire.in/history/high-time-discarded-pernicious-myth-indias-medieval-muslim-villains](https://thewire.in/history/high-time-discarded-pernicious-myth-indias-medieval-muslim-villains)\n\n[https://www.siasat.com/did-aurangzeb-persecute-hindus-2176720/](https://www.siasat.com/did-aurangzeb-persecute-hindus-2176720/)\n\n(Author is  Audrey Truschke, who has built a career out of Muslim appeasement )\n\nThe real history should be taught and written, even if they think it might stoke \'communal tensions\'. We won\'t be able to move ahead if we are still hung up on the past.  Unless this happens, Muslims will always be though of as Invaders. \n\nI still believe in "Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas". However, if Indian Muslims want to be a part of that Vikas, they must stop revelling in their victimhood, and start acknowledging and apologizing their historical wrongs.'<br />Author: 'IT_Cell'  id: 'plig3i'<br />Score:514<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/plig3i/why_is_hindutva_compared_to_nazis_taliban_and_the/</li>

A CIA study of 1966 argued that this technique was ‘particularly effective for democratically run membership organizations, which need to assure their own unwitting members and collaborators, as well as their hostile critics, that they have genuine, respectable, private sources of income’. Certainly, it allowed the CIA to fund ‘a seemingly limitless range of covert action programs affecting youth groups, labor unions, universities, publishing houses, and other private institutions’ from the early 1950s.**\n\nMore can be read here:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/op8nmj/antimodi_article_in_mit_fechnology_review_by/\n\n**What more, the tradition of Carnegie supplying CIA directors continues to this day!**\n\n&gt;*The chairperson of Carnegie\'s board of trustees is former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker,[6] and the organization\'s interim president is president is Thomas Carothers,[7] who replaced former Endowment president and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William J.

It introduces Yeshu who is the Truth, the Light of the world, the eternal Life, and the peace Granter. Please read one of the Gospels in the New Testament on the internet. It may take about 2 hours for reading. If you split time to read it, it does not take much time. You need Yeshu no matter what kind of birth community and samaj dharma you belong to. Believe and invite Yeshu as the Sadguru and your Ishta Devata. The Heavenly guru will answer to you. According to His promise, the Holy Spirit resides in believers' hearts and gives an experience of liberation (Moksha). And create a deep relationship with Him. It does not mean to abandon your culture, identity, or your community, but rather be followers of Yeshu and seek for the way how to serve the only true God whom Yeshu revealed and Yeshu as your Ishta Devata in your samaj dharma.\xa0 His Spirit will teach you how to love and serve your community well.

      <li>Title::: 'How the British stole from India to feed their war effort, triggering unchecked inflation'<br />Body: 'And they paid for the resources they purchased with useless scrip.\n\nCollective Revenue (centre + provinces) went from Rs 180 crore in 39-40 to Rs 590 cr in 45-46. An increase of 3 times.\n\nDebt went from GBP 440 + Rs 450 in 39-40 to GBP 34 + Rs 2282 in 45-46.\n\nBasically the debt was all in worthless Indian currency.\n\nThen the Brits got clever, they fixed prices at which they purchased raw materials but opened it up to the mARkET foRcES for general consumption.\n\nThis meant the the empire purchased vital foodstuffs, raw cotton etc at costs lower than what the Indian populace had to pay for it. \n\nThen to pay for all the Indian rupees debt, remember the one that went up 5 fold, the Raj simply printed notes.\n\nThe result? Roaring inflation.\n\nIn Aug 1939  Rs 179 crores of notes were in circulation\n\nBy Dec 1945 this was at Rs 1,200 crores. A whopping 7 fold increase in currency in circulation.\n\nBut and we aren\'t done here, the purchase by the Raj for the war effort sucked out all resources leaving a severe shortage married to a now worthless currency.\n\nNow we come to taxation.\n\nTax receipts of the Indian Govt went from Rs 50 cr in 39-40 to Rs 400 cr by 44-44, a whopping 8 fold increase in taxes.\n\nLet me repeat an 8 fold increase in taxes over 4 years.\n\nWe now have\n\nLow supply of goods + worthless currency + obscene taxation\n\nWar expenditure touched 57% of total expenditure in 41-42, averaging 42% from 42-46.\n\nWPI inflation hit 50% by Jan 43.  Closing the war at 150% by 46 (compared to pre war prices from Sept 39)\n\nIn summary despite an 8 fold increase in taxation during the war period, only 55% of the vastly increased expenditure was funded by taxes and borrowings. The balance was done by deficit financing, notes were printed and increased the currency in circulation by 400%, the price index increased 200%, inflation sky rocketed.\n\nBy comparison the UK itself saw an increase in paper currency by 180% and price index  by 74%.\n\n\nWill leave you with a statement published by 20 leading Indian economists, published as a warning to the Govt of India on April 12, 1943.\n\n&gt;&gt;The Government seems to act as if it is enough for it to take care of its own budget deficit\nwhile meeting the needs of the British Government by printing more notes. This is a grave\nmisreading of the whole situation and has resulted in an ever increasing expansion of\ncurrency unrelated to the needs of internal production and trade. As a result, the inflationary spiral is already at work in India. . . . . . . . The inflation in India is, therefore, a\ndeficit-induced, fiat-money inflation. It is the most disastrous type of inflation.\nInflation is the most inequitable way of distributing the war burden and usually large\ntransfers of wealth from the poorer and the middle classes to the richer classes. It is also\nundesirable because it increases the cost of war and impairs the war effort by hindering\nproduction and distribution.

There is also no means\nopen to the Reserve Bank of putting any artificial restraint on the rate at which sterling is\naccumulating with it.\n\nExcept, price rise in India was 5 times that of in the UK, and the measures proposed by the economists were in line with measures adopted by the US and UK to protect their home markets (the detailed proposals are listed in pp 11-14 in the RBI report)\n\nHMG had this to say,\n\n&gt;&gt;!

      <li>Title::: 'The spiritual culture of this land'<br />Body: "\nOne pays the price for aggression - always. Where are the successful empires of the Cholas and the Marathas? Or the Mughals? Only their temples and mausoleums remain. \n\nWhereas, the spiritual culture (which is ineffable, and not found in books and buildings, but in the untaught attitudes of people) is still alive in a recognizable form after millennia, that is the staying power of Shanti.\n\nJust as violence invites death and destruction, Shanti (a loving peacefulness) invites life and evolution.\n\nThe memories of violence and peace always linger. If Indians are a deeply peaceful people, it is the guidance of their memories, which are largely peaceful.\n\nI am glad we are not running an ethnic slave camp or operating organ harvesting prisons like China. I am glad we are not bumping people off on the street for speaking out against the state like Pakistan. I am glad we don't kill revolutionary leaders like MLK and Malcolm X, and unlike the US we respect native tribes and marginalized communities and their own cultures.\n\nWe have had an SC/ST President, women as CM/PM, a Muslim &amp; Sikh President, whereas the US / Australia will not have a Native American / Australian tribal person in power even in a 100 years. Nobody had to teach India all this - we didn't need a feminist / BLM movement.\n\nWhile we blame the spiritual tradition for the caste system, we should see that the caste system has successfully preserved the various cultures in India. In every other nation in the world the weaker populations (native tribes, backward classes) have been forcibly absorbed into the mainstream, or ethnically cleansed. Isn't it a wonder that we still have thousands of cuisines, thousands of castes with their unique identities, thousands of linguistic variants - only because there was differentiation. That is only possible with Shanti. How many native tribes are left today in Europe, or in China? \n\nThose who protest about caste and language rights should ask why the rest of the world doesn't have this problem? It's because they solved it by forcing a single language and a single culture upon all. \n\nShanti is eroding even in India, which is why the caste system went from differentiation to discrimination in the last few hundred - thousand years, but thankfully not yet extermination. We should at least arrest it if not reverse it, now.\n\nThere's not a single large predator species in Western Europe - all their bears and wolves were killed off systematically. In all of Italy there are some 3 bears, and they are geo-tagged and monitored so that they don't get near any city. If they do become a nuisance, they won't hesitate to kill it, and import one from Romania to replace it. Whereas we live in peace with innumerable leopards, tigers, lions, bears, and what not. Even if a Leopard wanders into Mumbai or Bengaluru we don't decide to kill all the leopards within a 100 miles, which is what they do in the West even now. \n\nThe deforestation in India was a result of colonial ravages, 200 ships left India every week with timber bound for Europe. We are reversing it now. Without any international pressure we are leaders in solar energy, and green commitments.\n\nTo the degree that we are able to live without fear, it is because we live without violence. America with all the wealth is still such a terrified nation in comparison to India.\n\nEspecially given this population density and poverty just look at how peacefully we co-exist - without this shanti bhavana India would be worse than Afghanistan, awash in internecine wars. Everyone in India can feel like a victim if they look back in time, but hardly anyone does anything about it, beyond occasionally complain.\n\nShanti doesn't mean success all the time, but it does mean you are happier to live with yourself, and you tend to do better in the long run.\n\nIt requires great bravery to be peaceful and non-violent. More bravery than it requires to fight.\n\nWe will always have some portion of the population whose natural tendencies are to fight, we never control them. A forced non-violence is no non-violence.\n\nPeople are free to act as their nature dictates, we had both Gandhi and Bose. And we had Aurobindo who was both a violent revolutionary and later a sage.\n\nIndia is but the sum total of the nature of its population"<br />Author: 'greasesoda'  id: 'pjgpl4'<br />Score:102<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pjgpl4/the_spiritual_culture_of_this_land/</li>

India has 15 cat species , more than any  continent ( except Asia of course ) and country , we also had cheetahs until they were hunted to extinction . Another big cause of their extinction was captivity . Akbar the bitch had 5000 hunting cheetahs . Cheetahs can’t breed in captivity .\n\n. Both the smallest ( rusty spotted cat ) and the largest ( Bengal tiger ) cat species can be found in India .\n\n. India has 4 bear species more than any other country ( the brown [ Himalayan black bear , Tibetan blue bear ] , the black ( Himalayan black bear , Tibetan black bear ] , the sun bear in northeast India and the sloth bear .\n\n. India used to have 3 rhino species , now we have only Indian or greater one horned rhinoceros one and it is thriving . The other two were Indian Sumatran and Indian Javan rhinoceros ( hunted to extinction ) .\n\n. India’s wildlife is one of the most diverse on the planet . the Ladakhi wildlife is basically a part of Central Asian wildlife , lifeless yet the most colourful landscape with the most unique rock and plain formations . Kashmir , Himachal , Uttarakhand and many other northern states host the Himalayan wildlife found in countries such as Nepal , pakistan , Bhutan and some parts of china , Afghanistan and Myanmar . Many parts of Northeastern India are home to southeast Asian wildlife and the rest basically hosts native , Himalayan , the plains wildlife. Northern Sikkim is also a host to the Central Asian wildlife . The northern plains has its own unique wildlife and is pretty diverse ranging from grasslands , forests , river systems . Northwestern Indian wildlife can be somewhat seen as a blend of the plains and Arabian wildlife deserts , scrubland , salt flats and plains rock this area it is also home the the Indian wild ass , and asiatic lion ( only found here ) it also has a pretty unique marine wildlife . Central India is full of thick deciduous jungles ( jungle book took Place in central India ) and it can be described as a conjunction of northern and southern Indian wildlife . The western and southern region is full of evergreen forests and has its own endemic wildlife . The east has the eastern ghats rocky patches with deciduous and evergreen forests , some regions also host mangroves which are home to the infamous maneater and saltwater drinking tigers and the coasts are the egg laying ground for Ridley turtles . The Andaman archipelago has its own endemic wildlife a lot of unique birds , shrews and marine wildlife and an island full of elephants ( not native ) .

Make a holy war**, do not embezzle the spoils; do not break your pledge; and do not mutilate (the dead) bodies; do not kill the children. When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withhold yourself from doing them any harm. **Invite them to (accept) Islam**; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them. Then invite them to migrate from their lands to the land of the Muhajireen and inform them that, if they do so, they shall have all the privileges and obligations of the Muhajireen. If they refuse to migrate, tell them that they will have the status of Bedouin Muslims and will be subjected to the Commands of Allah like other Muslims, but they will not get any share from the spoils of war or Fai\' except when they actually fight with the Muslims (against the disbelievers). **If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya.** If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. **If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah\'s help and fight them.**\n\nthis just proves what br ambedkar says about islam in his book\n\n*Hinduism is said to divide people and in contrast Islam is said to bind people together. This is only a half-truth. For Islam divides as inexorably as it binds. Islam is a close corporation and the distinction that it makes between Muslims and non-Muslims is a very real, very positive and very alienating distinction. The brotherhood of Islam is not the universal brotherhood of man. It is brotherhood of Muslims for Muslims only. There is a fraternity, but its benefit is confined to those within that corporation. For those who are outside the corporation, there is nothing but contempt and enmity. The second defect of Islam is that it is a system of\xa0social\xa0self-government and is incompatible with\xa0local\xa0self-government, because the allegiance of a Muslim does not rest on his domicile in the country which is his but on the faith to which he belongs. To the Muslim\xa0ibi bene ibi patria \\[Where it is well with me, there is my country\\] is unthinkable. Wherever there is the rule of Islam, there is his own country. In other words, Islam* [*can never allow a true Muslim*](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/412d.html) *to adopt India as his motherland and regard a Hindu as his kith and kin.”*\n\nwell now i think the terrorists are actually representing their community and tbf they are doing nothing wrong if believed for their allah and boy it has actually caused me a panic attack after seeing this post in Kerala\n\n[https://np.reddit.com/r/Kerala/comments/p5zp1h/how\\_did\\_islamic\\_extremism\\_being\\_again\\_in\\_kerala](https://np.reddit.com/r/Kerala/comments/p5zp1h/how_did_islamic_extremism_being_again_in_kerala)\n\nwill kerala be the next kashmir i don\'t know but the government must do something for this radicalism'<br />Author: 'dil_se_hun_BC_253'  id: 'phvfok'<br />Score:344<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/phvfok/why_is_islam_so_violent/</li>

Remember, this is a group that is funded by western governments and George Soros.\n\n&gt;The award to The Wire was in collaboration with International Media Support\n\n&gt;The International Media Support (IMS) is another western government funded group that has funded regime change propaganda in the past. It received as much 92% of its funds from governments of European countries in 2019.\n\n&gt;31% of its funds in 2019 came from the Denmark government apparatus, 44% from Sweden and 17% from Norway. The total contributions received amounts to almost 20 million Euros.\n\n&gt;The IMS was one of the prominent funders of Radio Rozana. “The priority is to hear the voice of Syrians inside Syria. They are suffering and being killed every day. We want to support them,” its founder Chawaf had claimed.\n\n&gt;Radio Rozana also hosted the Syriaza. Syriaza is “a Syrian-to-Syrian storytelling, archiving, and dissemination project for peace-building, created by the Rome-based international organization Ara Pacis Initiative and led by Syrian poets, defenders of human dignity and human rights, community leaders, and citizen journalists.”\n\n&gt;The Ara Pacis Iniative stated on its website, “From the 18th of July to the 4th of August, 2015, with funds from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, an intergenerational, interethnic, and interreligious group of 30 Syrians convened in Viterbo, Italy, for phase one of the Syriaza project: capacity building.”\n\n&gt;In this context, it is important to remember that Syria is currently fending off a civil war incited by the USA. The Syriaza and Radio Rozana, both funded by western governments, clearly appear to be part of a propaganda to justify regime change wars.\n\n&gt;It is also pertinent to mention another member of the Ara Pacis Initiative as well is Harsh Mander, Antonia\'s supercabinet NAC member whose NGOs ended up "accidentally" employing wife of top Maoist terrorist &amp; who was appointed on board of foreign ISI linked Kashmir secessionist terror apologia orgs.

Its mandate includes issues such as arms control, promotion of human rights, freedom of the press, and fair elections. It employs around 3,460 people, mostly in its field operations but also in its secretariat in Vienna, Austria, and its institutions. It has its origins in the mid 1975 Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) held in Helsinki, Finland. The OSCE is concerned with early warning, conflict prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict rehabilitation. Most of its 57 participating countries are in Europe, but there are a few members present in Asia and North America. The participating states cover much of the land area of the Northern Hemisphere. It was created during the Cold War era as an East–West forum.[3]\n\nFollowing an unprecedented period of activity in the 1990s and early 2000s (decade), the OSCE has in the past few years faced accusations from the CIS states (primarily[citation needed] Russia) of being a tool for the Western states to advance their own interests. For instance, the events in Ukraine in 2004 (the "Orange Revolution") led to allegations by Russia of OSCE involvement on behalf of the pro-Western Viktor Yushchenko. At the 2007 Munich Conference on Security Policy, Vladimir Putin made this position very clear:\n\n"They [unnamed Western States] are trying to transform the OSCE into a vulgar instrument designed to promote the foreign policy interests of one or a group of countries. And this task is also being accomplished by the OSCE\'s bureaucratic apparatus, which is absolutely not connected with the state founders in any way. Decision-making procedures and the involvement of so-called non-governmental organizations are tailored for this task. These organizations are formally independent but they are purposefully financed and therefore under control".[48][49][50][51]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe'<br />Author: 'StarsAtLadakh'  id: 'phtvky'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/phtvky/wire_receives_award_from_international_press_inst/</li>

Therefore, I decided I don't want to get married anytime soon atleast before I find answers to few of these questions. \n\nHowever, my parents are steadfast to get me married. They are using all emotional things like this is one thing we want or you always do what you want and never listen to us or you're too old already and won't get a good girl etc. One thing which some friends suggest is just stop talking to them, they cannot force me. But I don't want to stop talking to them, I love them and want them to be a part of my life.
