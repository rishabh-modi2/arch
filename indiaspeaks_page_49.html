The people are some of the nicest people I've come across, even though their past and current governments have done nothing but create more problems for the world and their people. This has been something that's been on my mind for some time.\n\nIndia used to be one of the world's most powerful countries until the British came over and colonised the entire country. We had land, opulence, power. But that all quickly diminished during the time of British rule. British rule in general had a net negative impact on the country - Natives were oppressed and countless human rights violations were committed.\n\nThe worst act, by far was when the entire country was partitioned. This eventually sowed the seeds for future territorial wars and conflicts such as the Kashmir conflict, insurgencies within the North Eastern part of India, and so on. The partition was so poorly executed that even today, the country still has to reel from the effects of British colonial rule. Because of this, India has been engaging in a bitter diplomatic fight with Pakistan for the past 80 years while still trying to stymie other civil disorders and conflict.\n\nFor many years altogether, Palestine remained a British protectorate and the people remained happy and joyous. That was until they started allowing mass numbers of immigrants into the area, sowing the seeds for the future Israel-Palestine conflict. While Israel remains wealthy, the people of Palestine remain poor and impoverished. And nothing has been done to ensure that the Palestinian people have a positive future.\n\nAfrica, being a continent rich in natural resources, was exploited immensely by the British along with several other European powers. Now that the British have left, many former British colonies in Africa remain poor and impoverished. Sudan is dying thanks to civil wars and conflict, Nigeria has been hobbled with political instability and poverty, and so on. Many African countries could've easily become the world's wealthiest countries if only decent governance was ensured by the British along many other European countries.\n\nTo what end was this all necessary? Absolutely nothing. These places now have to deal with the effects of colonisation, while the British enjoyed themselves with all of the riches they've stolen. I've said this before, the only reason the British have a name in the world is because of the things they've done. Had they not done any of this, nobody would even know what the British are."<br />Author: 'Krenoso'  id: 'cu8sz6'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cu8sz6/we_can_blame_india_or_any_country_for_whatever/</li>

The name *PƒÅ·πáini Backus form* was also once suggested in view of the fact that the expansion *Backus normal form* may not be accurate, and that [PƒÅ·πáini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini) had independently developed a similar notation earlier.\n\n Ingerman, P.

The cash paid to Arun went to an influential politician in Tamil Nadu who was a Cabinet minister in the UPA regime for 10 years. What is JD Group? Which is Vasan Eye Care?

This shouldn't be something that is decided over the opinions of anonymous strangers on the internet but I look forward to listening to your personal experience and understand what it truly means to be a doctor or an engineer. I've only ever heard the biased opinions of a few people and lack the insight to properly make a judgement on either of those professions. I will start by giving some background of myself.\n\nI scored 85% on boards and 333 in neet and did not attempt jee. I am not a studious person and my strategy is to slack off all the time and study in the end. My father kept pushing me into becoming a doctor and that's why I gave the exam. I don't have an ambition of my own. I always avoided thinking about my future, I don't know why. Now I have joined a repeaters course for neet prep. I don't know why but Now I suddenly came to my senses and started questioning why I'm doing this. If I'm going to work hard for 10 years then I should be able to get a job 9-5 job with weekdays off right? But a friend of mine said his father (doctor) works 80 hours a week. I can't work hard for 10 years just to keep working hard for the rest of my life. So I've been thinking what if I switch to engineering and tech based career options. Well most of the colleges have been filled but there are some vacancies. With my marks I can make it to tier 2 colleges at best. With the current state of engineering in our country and the stiff competition for jobs I doubt that I will get a satisfying job with a good work life balance as companies will try their best to maximise profit by making you work overtime and if you refuse there is always another person who is waiting in line for that job.\n\nAs for my interests it has always been anime, video games, tv shows and browsing the internet (imageboards and forums). Very few people have common interests with me but my friends are awesome regardless of whether they like what I like. I'm an introvert. I don't have many big plans for life and I usually find happiness in trivial things like watching a good show and reading a good book. No intention to start a family, at least for now.\n\nI'm sorry this whole thing is badly structured but guys please do your best to help me out.thank you very much"<br />Author: 'Rockpaperpenguin1'  id: 'csvtia'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/csvtia/career_advice_should_i_choose_engineering_or/</li>

Today is Tuesday, and according to her, women whose husbands are alive (like me) shouldn\'t wash their heads (shampoo) on Tuesdays. And guess what, on Thursdays too, and on Saturday and Sundays as well. Its not for the first time that I\'ve heard such a rule and many others as well. My mother had a similar rule, difference being that then, it was girls who have only one brother (like me) should not wash their heads on Tuesday, etc. The thing is that that was my mother with whom I could argue, fight and emerge victorious. But this time, its my mother in law and I can\'t just snap back with a quip.\n\nI understand that our elders grew up with different set of values and they place their trust in such things, like when to not wash head, on which days to not pluck Tulsi leaves or even utter the name Tulsi (phew), when to not buy steel, iron, etc etc. Its just that I can\'t follow all this and even if I should, I won\'t because I don\'t believe in whatever this will be called - superstition, belief, quirk, I don\'t know.\n\nI don\'t want to sound rude or like someone who doesn\'t respect Hindu Dharm and its practices (if these are one of them). I also don\'t want to appear like a pushover who will follow all such practices, because in the morning when she saw my wet hair and (politely) mentioned this rule, I just said "Hmm. Okay", as I was getting late for office. I am sure there must be some explanation behind such rules which is why so many ladies practise them for the well being of their kids, husband, family, etc. I also understand this is not that big a thing and I could totally schedule my shampoo days, but its just that I don\'t believe in that. I am not looking for logic behind the practice; she follows it, good for her, but I won\'t.\n\nI also don\'t want to involve my husband because a) he is under recovery after an accident and b) I want to stand up for myself. Besides, its honestly not that big a matter and I should be able to solve it myself. \n\nSo guys, what steps do you follow in such situations, when elders mention such rules and expect you to follow? Married men whose wives might have faced something like this, what did you/they do?'<br />Author: '2throwawaythrowaway'  id: 'csutje'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/csutje/how_to_handle_situations_involving_superstitions/</li>

Doesn't that just open up the most important part of India, Delhi to a hostile foreign power?

      <li>Title::: "Osho's take on the Kashmir conflict"<br />Body: '"In India I knew many politicians, but I have not seen any brains in them.\nSimple things that anybody will understand, things which don\'t need great genius, politicians will miss. One of my friend was commander-in-chief of the Indian Army. When Pakistan invaded India, this man - his name was General Chaudhri - asked permission of the Prime Minister to counter attack; it was needed, just being defensive would not help. That\'s a simple military strategy; if you become defensive you are already defeated. The best way is to be aggressive.\n\nIf Pakistan had invaded one part of Kashmir, Chaudhri\'s idea was that we invade Pakistan from four or five fronts. They will be confused, they will run amok, they will not be able to decide where they have to send their armies. Their attack will become a failure because they have to defend all the borders of their country.\n\nBut politicians! The Prime Minister, Nehru, informed him - \'Wait till 6 \'o\' clock in the morning.\' \nGeneral Chaudhri told me that he was thrown out of the army - not publicly. Publicly he retired honorably, but he was kicked out. He was told - \'either you resign or we will throw you out.\'\n\nThe reason was that he attacked Pakistan at 5 \'o\' clock in the morning - one hour before the order. That was the right time, by 6 \'o\' clock, it would be sunrise, people would be awake. 5 \'o\' clock was the perfectly right time - everybody was asleep - to drive them crazy. And he did what he was saying - he made the whole of Pakistan tremble. He was just 15 miles from Lahore - Pakistan\'s biggest city.\n\nThe whole night Nehru and his cabinet were discussing this way or that way - to do it or not to do it. And even by 6 \'o\' clock in the morning they had not come to any conclusion. They just heard on the radio - \'General Chaudhri is entering Lahore.\'\n\nThat was too much for the politicians. They stopped him just 15 miles before Lahore. And I can see that was sheer stupidity. If the man had taken Lahore, the problem of Kashmir and India would have been solved forever. It is not ever going to be solved, the problem of the territory of Kashmir which Pakistan has occupied - and it was because General Chaudhri was told to come back, \'because India is a non-violent country and you did not wait for the order.\'\n\nHe said to them - \'I do understand military strategy, you don\'t. Even by 6 \'o\' clock where was your order? Pakistan has already occupied a certain territory, the most beautiful part of Kashmir - and you were just discussing the whole night. This is not a question to be discussed - this has to be decided on the warfield. If you had allowed me to take over Lahore then we would have been in a position to bargain. Now we are not in a position to bargain. You pulled me back. I had to come back.\'\n\nThe UN decided for a ceasefire line. So now for 40 years, UN armies have been there patrolling, on the other side Pakistani armies are patrolling, on this side Indian armies are patrolling. For 40 years - just nonsense! And in the UN they go on discussing and nothing comes out of it.\nAnd the territory that has been taken by Pakistan you cannot take back because of the ceasefire. They have decided in their Parliament that the territory occupied by them is combined into Pakistan. Now they show it on their maps. It is no longer occupied territory, it is Pakistani territory.\n\nI had told General Chaudhri - \'This was such a simple thing that you had to be in a bargaining position. If you had taken Lahore, they would have immediately agreed to leave Kashmir because they could not lose Lahore. Or if a ceasefire was to come, okay, then Lahore remains with us when we ceasefire. Either way there will be something to bargain. India doesn\'t have anything to bargain with - why should Pakistan bother?\'\nBut politicians certainly don\'t have brains."\n\n- Osho, From Darkness to Light'<br />Author: 'karmache'  id: 'crz6y3'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/crz6y3/oshos_take_on_the_kashmir_conflict/</li>

But the encounter happens within the first 5 minutes, and the rest of the movie is about its political and media fallout, and how it affects the lives of the cop who led the encounter.\n\nIMO this is the only movie I know of that tackles the issue of minority appeasement in India.\n\nIt doesn\'t shy away from showing media and upa era politicians\' blatant pandering to minorities, and how it gets in the way of domestic security. At one point, a minister asks the protagonist who is hunting the Indian Mujahideen to not just go after one community. In a climatic scene, the hero says that the 2 biggest enemies of these "misguided youth" are the people who recruit them to do violence in the name of religion, and the people who call them the victim even when they do something wrong.\n\nThere\'s also a Sheila Rashid lookalike organising protests for the terrorists, and a scheming political party loosely based on Samajwadi Party.\n\nThe movie isn\'t perfect, there are narrative hiccups and a pointless wife character, and more than its fair share of "the good Muslim" archetype. But the movie is earnest, and does a great job of portraying the India of 2008 that was wrecked by terrorist attacks and a sinister government.\n\nYou could keep complaining about Hindu villification in Sacred Games or Leila, or you can support a movie that shows the reality.\nSo vote with your wallets, and we will have more such stories being brought into the mainstream.'<br />Author: 'rec350'  id: 'crsbus'<br />Score:124<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/crsbus/why_you_should_watch_batla_house_the_movie/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Why does the rapes, massacre, land grabbing, demographic, and religious change in Gilgit Baltistan gets ignored?'<br />Body: 'Gilgit was once part of J&amp;K state leased to british to check russian influence in the region. During partition the british officer posted in the region revolted against the maharaja with muslim soilders help(massacring hindu and sikh soilders), proclaimed accession to pakistan, even though they had no legal authority, and the region fell into pakistan hands. \n\nGB at that time(1948) was a shia majority(85%) state with many ethnic groups and languages. And what happened after it till 1970 is in dark. It\'s hard to find articles and sources over it and everything starts again in 1970\'s which we will also be focusing on.\n\nIn 1974 pakistan basically passed laws that enabled demographic change. And this was exactly what they intended to do.\n\n&gt;Pakistan had been facing difficulties in governing Gilgit-Baltistan, which was a multi-lingual Shia-dominated region unlike Sunni and Punjabi-dominated Pakistan. Following the humiliation in the 1971 war, Pakistan carved out a separate region of Gilgit-Baltistan, renamed it as Northern Territory and placed it under direct rule of the federal government.\n\n&gt;In 1974, Pakistan notified a rule overriding the 1927 law promulgated by the maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir that denied property ownership to outsiders. \n\n&gt;Having done away with the legal barrier, Pakistan pushed settlement of Sunni Muslims from neighbouring North West Frontier Province (renamed as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2010). This led to a series of sectarian clashes in Gilgit-Baltistan, which got its name back in 2009.\nToday, Gilgit-Baltistan has a legislative assembly with limited powers. It is governed by the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit Baltistan in the government of Pakistan. The real power resides in a council headed by the prime minister of Pakistan.\n\nhttps://www.indiatoday.in/news-analysis/story/beyond-kashmir-status-of-gilgit-baltistan-is-a-case-in-contrast-1580373-2019-08-13\n\nPakis were allowed to legally move in and buy land and move in they did. **From 85% shia the region is now only 39%(or even less now) according to the data shia with sunnis coming second at 30%**. \n\nPakistan doesn\'t allow people there to learn their own languages and customs.\n\n&gt;A confluence of many different cultures and languages, especially those related to Tibet, Central Asia and India, Gilgit-Baltistan today faces what some experts call a "cultural genocide". Pakistan\'s educational policy bans mother tongue learning as a strategy to promote cultural assimilation and to erode indigenous identities. Plans to implement Mandarin as an optional language in schools of Gilgit-Baltistan have further raised concerns over the linguistic heritage of the region.\n\nhttps://unpo.org/members/8727\n\nPakistan sunnis have no love for shias and we often hear about attacks on hazara and shia mosques being blown up. The same was the case for shias in GB. With sunnis slowly gaining numbers and connections to taliban and other terriost groups the region also started experiencing sectarian violence.\n\n&gt;Shias\xa0alleged discrimination by the Pakistani government since 1948, claiming that\xa0Sunnis\xa0were given preference in business, official positions and the administration of justice.\xa0\n\n&gt;The first major anti-Shia riots in\xa0Gilgit\xa0broke out in May 1988 over the sighting of the moon, which ushers the end of the holy month of\xa0Ramadan. When Shias in Gilgit celebrated\xa0Eid al-Fitr, a group of extremist Sunnis, still fasting as their religious leaders had not yet declared the sighting of the moon, attacked them. This resulted in violent clashes between Sunnis and Shias. Following a brief calm of about four days, the Pakistani military regime reportedly used a number of militants along with local Sunnis to ‚Äòteach a lesson‚Äô to Shias, which resulted in the hundreds of Shias and Sunnis being killed.\n\n&gt;There was a revolt in Gilgit by its Shia population, which called for a separate Shia state. The\xa0Pakistan Army\xa0then transported\xa0Osama bin Laden\xa0and his hordes massacred and raped several hundred Shia civilians in Gilgit.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Gilgit_massacre?wprov=sfla1\n\nAround 700 people were killed and raped in this massacre. \n\nSince then shias in GB have been facing such attacks.\n\n&gt;The Pakistan government had planned and organised settlement of non-locals from tribal areas, Kohistan, Kashmir and parts of Punjab which further deteriorated the situation. This transformed the demography of the locals. In the 1990s the ratio of locals to non-locals was 4:1 but now it has been raised to 4:3. The rise of extremism and growth of unrest in Gilgit Baltistan shows that\xa0sectarianism is officially being promoted as a calibrated policy to keep people engaged in trivial issues.\xa0A systematic ethnic cleansing of Shia community is being carried out in\xa0Pakistan administered Kashmir.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Kohistan_Shia_massacre?wprov=sfla1\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_2012_Mansehra_Shia_massacre?wprov=sfla1\n\nhttps://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/pakistan-12-girls-schools-burnt-down-in-gilgit-baltistans-diamer-district/1268721/\n\nNow the situation is so bad thay terrorist groups(*cough sunnis) attack girls schools because they want to enforce their laws and customs in the region. And constituting 30% of population with government and military support they soon will be dominant culture, sect in the region.\n\n\nGB has suffered a huge demographic change. They are ignored exploited part of today\'s pakistan. Their culture, language and religion is dying. They are becoming minority in their own land. \n\nAnd pakistan which has done all of this, barks about us doing these things in kashmir. \n\nIndia has not changed the religion, kashmiri culture and language is preserved(dying in pakistan btw), no demographic change has happened. Unless you count them driving away pandit and giving citizenship to paksitanis and central asian muslims while not giving the same benefit of hindu sikh 1947 refugees. We gave them self rule which they wasted. We have even wasted money on them and let them rule over jammu and laddkah even though both of these regions wanted to be part of india.\n\nNow, who is actually performing Nazi Lebensraum here?'<br />Author: 'obvlux'  id: 'cr3bmy'<br />Score:149<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cr3bmy/why_does_the_rapes_massacre_land_grabbing/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'The lies and lies of R Guha'<br />Body: 'R Guha in his polemical write up in WaPo argues that somehow democracy has been besmirched by Modiji and that the pure democracy of the past has somehow eroded. As is his wont, he has a blindside the size of a tank when it comes to his beloved Nehru-Gandhi family.  He left out so many acts by this family that it would be come clear to any neutral observer that it was a ‚Äò40-60‚Äô democracy in the past and is a stable democracy now. \n\nHe says, \n\n&gt; To be sure, there was violence at its birth, and rebellion afterward, in Kashmir, Nagaland and elsewhere, put down by force. But when one considers how much blood was shed in the forging of the British or American or French or Chinese nation, I think Indians have gotten off relatively lightly.\n\nWhat a monumental glossing over of the terrible bloodletting that was the partition. The approx. costs of partition including events like direct action day is no less than 1 Million.  You then consider events outside the actual partition like Operation Polo in Hyderabad, the Sunderlal committee estimates the minimum killed to be 40,000 civilians and the upper estimate at 200,000 killed. All told we are looking at something like 1.1 million civilians killed in a span of 2 years. This is a monthly death rate of 45,000 killed per month, every month for 2 full years and these are the middle end of the estimates, the higher estimates would put this in excess of a 100,000 killed every month for 2 years.\n\nTo put things into context, the English civil war saw a total of 200,000 killed over a decade. That is 1,600 killed per month on average. The US civil war was extremely bloody no doubt, with 1mn causalities in 4 years, but even this was spread across twice the time period and was mostly combatants with about 1,20,000 civilian dead which pales in comparison with 1mn civilian dead in India.\n\nThe French revolution for all its imagery about the Guillotine and the Reign of Terror saw no more than 40,000 deaths. Even if we account for the deaths from the street fighting, this is around 50,000, far far less than the bloodletting India went through.\n\nIt is only the Chinese civil wars that in their sheer bloodletting that can be compared or are worse than ours. Mr Guha, you are objectively wrong when you say that France, UK, USA all had a far worse death rate when they forged their nation. You also omit to mention Mr Guha that the Sunderlal \n\nMoving on, Mr Guha continues in covering up the sins of Nehru (and the family) by glossing over or phrasing events in a manner that removes accountability from them for their actions or provides them an agency they did not have. He says for instance,\n\n&gt; Wisely, the founders of India rejected the conventional wisdom that a single language would enhance national unity and refused to impose Hindi across the republic\n\nNehru didn‚Äôt just wake up one fine day and decide that Linguistic plurality will be a cornerstone of India. On the contrary Nehru had always pushed for Hindi as a national language. He even as a part of the SVP committee endorsed the Dar committee findings that partitioning of states on linguistic grounds was unhealthy for the nation. It was Ambedkar with his brilliant foresight who as always went against Nehru and fought for linguistic division. It was HE who came up with the solution that the official language of each state would be one of the official languages of the nation as a whole. Nehru OPPOSED HIM the whole way. \n\nLet us not forget Potti Sriramalu who wanted a state with Telugu as its language (linguistic plurality) and yet Nehru hemmed and hawed as riots raged in now AP part of Madras province. Sriramalu himself went on a fast unto death‚Ä¶.and died! This then sparked a wave of riots across now AP and Tamil Nadu states. More than 7 were killed in police firing and after that the Indian Nero said that AP would be carved out of TN. In this same period you had massive protests in Maharashtra, Gujarat and other states pushing for language determined borders.\n\nAll this Mr Guha, the eminent historian has glossed over in 2 lines saying Nehru stood for plurality in language when this was never the case and his hand was forced. His original and stated intent was always Hindi as a core language, a language of unity.\n\n&gt; On the other hand, in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, linguistic differences helped provoke bloody conflicts and even secession.\n\nI can‚Äôt even make sense of this as the sectarian warfare in Pakistan is driven entirely by Islam and the conflicts within it. Sri Lanka was always about cultural identity and not about language. Looks like the eminent historian needs to brush up on his history.\n\nMr Guha then says,\n\n&gt; We have a Muslim minority who are so large in numbers that they cannot, even if they want to, go anywhere else. They have got to live in India. That is a basic fact about which there can be no argument. Whatever the provocation from Pakistan and whatever the indignities and horrors inflicted on non-Muslims there, we have got to deal with this minority in a civilized manner. We must give them security and the rights of citizens in a democratic State.‚Äù\n\nYet his own Army massacred 10‚Äôs of thousands of Muslim civilians in Hyderabad just a year later and not ONE person was made accountable for this gross act of ethnic cleansing. Neither was anyone made to pay the price for the culling of Hindus by the Muslims prior to Operation Polo. \n\nWhat did this great secular Nehru do? He buried the report under layers and layers of reinforced concrete. [Only snippets are found to this day]( https://frontline.thehindu.com/static/html/fl1805/18051140.htm)\n\nMr Guha, you cry crocodile tears about lynching violence, something that is despicable and has claimed 25 lives in 5 years, and in every case the guilty are behind bars, either awaiting trial or already sentenced (and in one case, Pehlu Khan, a not guilty verdict was found) and yet, in 1948, a year after this quote of Nehru‚Äôs, nothing less than 50,000 Muslim civilians were butchered by the army and police you ostensibly controlled and what did you do?\n\nNothing, like literally nothing! Is this secularism Mr Guha? Is this democracy Mr Guha?\n\n&gt; So long as Nehru was alive there was little religious conflict, but after his death in 1964 riots between Hindus and Muslims began breaking out episodically.\n\nYes, if you exclude the 50,000-200,000 killed in Hyderabad which alone would be more than the total of all other riot related deaths since 1947!\n&gt; These conflicts have only accelerated since the 1980s, with the rise of the Hindu-first Bharatiya Janata Party. With the BJP now in power in Parliament and in most major states, and with many of its leaders and virtually all of its cadres being absolutely majoritarian in their outlook, India is closer to being a Hindu Pakistan than at any time since 1947.\n\n1980-2000 were particularly bloody decades, and 1980-1996 was when the Cong was in power. 1980-1991 was when it was mostly in power unchecked in either houses of parliament.\n\nYet Mr Guha, why have you not mentioned that riots have almost disappeared after 2014? This could arguably be the longest major riot free period we have had after 1964 as you mention it. Do you not mention it because for you agenda &gt;&gt;&gt; Facts?\n\n&gt; A second failure consists of the steady dismantling of impartial, rule-bound public institutions. India is in danger of becoming what I have called an ‚Äúelection-only democracy.‚Äù\n\nReally Mr Guha? Have you forgotten the Emergency when these institutions did not even exist? Don‚Äôt forget, Nehru and his daughter dismissed state governments at will! The govt in Punjab was dismissed only because the CM did not appoint Nehru toadies to his cabinet.\n\nWhy go so back in time? From 2004-2014, your own Sonia Gandhi, created and then ran an entirely extra constitutional body called the NAC. Your own Rahul Gandhi disrespected the office of the PM in such hideous ways that even the detractors of Manmohan felt sorry for him. What was the case when Naveen Chawla (accused of running concentration camps as per the Shah Commission on the emergency) made CEC, or that non entity Pratiba Patil besmirched the office of the President?\n\nMr Guha, you are a filthy hypocrite, but thankfully these days you and your pet Nehru Gandhi family do not control all information flows, so your lies can be exposed what they are, Goebbelsian!'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'cr35lm'<br />Score:103<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cr35lm/the_lies_and_lies_of_r_guha/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How Vietnam Data Localisation &amp; Cyber Laws has helped in creating Homegrown Social Networking Sites'<br />Body: 'This is an article behind paywall so:\n\nHANOI -- Vietnamese companies have started a string of new social networks in a bid to crack a sector dominated by Facebook, which boasts more than 60\xa0million users out of a population of over 96 million.\xa0\n\nThe latest debut was announced on July 23 by Gapo Technology, a unit of Hanoi-based G-group.\xa0\n\nGapo is a homegrown social network with chat, posting and other functions. "We are confident of being able to attract 50 million users by 2021," CEO Ha Trung Kien said at the launch event in Hanoi.\xa0\n\nGapo arrived just one week after Nguyen Manh Hung, Vietnam\'s minister of information and communications, told a gathering of IT executives in Ho Chi Minh City that he wanted more native social networks.\n\nHung said it was time for Vietnam\'s IT industry to move up the value chain after a long focus on outsourcing. ‚ÄúIt is high time\xa0we develop a new social network that is more humanitarian and really values its clients,‚Äù Hung said.\xa0He called for local IT companies to create a unique social network that can compete with the likes of Facebook, according to local media.\xa0\n\nThe ministry of information and communications would support businesses by issuing a policy for sandboxes so that businesses could securely test new technological models in a controlled and secure environment, Hung reiterated.\xa0\xa0\n\nSince January, three social networks have been launched by local companies. Ho Chi Minh City-based based Hahalolo Travel Social Network officially announced its platform on June 10, setting an ambitious target of 2 billion users by 2024.\xa0\n\nThe following day, the Communist Party\'s Central Commission for Communication and Education and state telecom carrier Viettel Group launched the VCNET social network.\xa0VCNET is designed to "fight against incorrect information and fake news," said Nguyen Thanh Long, deputy head of the commission.\xa0\n\nTwo more social networks are set to take off in the second half, bringing the total number of new platforms developed by private investors to five this year, according to the ministry. Last year, the number was two, according to local reports.\xa0\n\nIndustry observers say these moves could accelerate owing to a cybersecurity law that came into effect in January. The law requires companies engaged in telecommunications, online services and online content to locate offices and servers in Vietnam and store data within the country.\xa0\n\nThis has encouraged local companies to start social networks in anticipation that foreign players will scale back their presence in Vietnam, observers say.\n\nIn January, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc directed the ministry of information and communications to do more to ensure foreign social networks comply with the cybersecurity law. He also told it to continue its effort to promote homegrown alternatives, according to local media reports.\xa0\n\nHanoi has increased pressure on Facebook and Google since the cybersecurity law was implemented. In June, the ministry of information and communications asked the two U.S. tech giants to open representative offices in Vietnam, perform tax obligations, and manage content within the country. The ministry said the companies collected advertising revenue of $235 million and $152.1 million, respectively, in the country in 2018.\xa0\n\nIn May, the ministry said Facebook had agreed to remove 208 fake accounts, 2,444 links advertising unlawful products and services, 215 fanpages touting gambling, and more than 200 links opposing the party and the state.\xa0\xa0\n\nIn June, the ministry announced it identified about 55,000 YouTube videos deemed "harmful" or in violation of Vietnamese law. Google and YouTube in Vietnam deleted 8,000 videos at the request of Vietnamese authorities, according to local reports.\xa0\n\nWhile making requests to Facebook and Google, government officials are rousing local tech companies to start rival services. "The social network Facebook runs on contributions from its users, so they (these users) must have a voice in deciding the rules for that platform. The social network reflects real life, so basic moral values must be respected. At the same time, the platform must comply with the laws of the host country," Hung, the minister of information and communications, insisted at an industry gathering in Ho Chi Minh City, according to local media.\xa0\n\n"Facebook refuses to follow local rules when it enters a new country, saying it has own rules. Why don\'t we create a social network where users decide their own rules?" Hung said.\n\nLe Hong Hiep, a fellow at the ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute based in Singapore, expressed doubts about\xa0Vietnam\'s\xa0goal to come up with its own answers to Facebook.\n\n"I don\'t think Vietnam will be able to develop viable social media platforms that can compete with global players like Facebook or Google," he said.\n\n"As long as Facebook and Google are still around, domestic social media platforms will not be Vietnamese users\' first choice," he said.\n\nSince Facebook entered Vietnam in 2007, Hanoi has issued more than 300 licenses for local social networks as of 2017, but few of them are active. Users have complained that most of the platforms built by local companies are not user friendly and that functions tend to be copies of those on Facebook. Some experts say Hanoi wants to tighten its grip on social networks as does China, where Facebook and Google services are blocked. But not all observers agree with this view.\n\n"Hanoi will not shut down its internet and block the country from the international community, at the cost of building a new platform to replace Facebook or Google," said Tran Hong Ninh, a digital business analyst and founder of the Ho Chi Minh City-based Performance King, a consulting firm.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nA nation with population of 100 Million has been able to take on such Humongous Tech Giants yet we are still contemplating whether to implement Data Localisation or not. If we want to move up the value chain in IT then its necessary to build an ecosystem of homegrown Tech Companies or atleast try to level the playing field for them.\n\nDiscuss.'<br />Author: 'PawanJyotiSingh'  id: 'cr2igq'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cr2igq/how_vietnam_data_localisation_cyber_laws_has/</li>

Any law to curb population growth or restrict the number of child births will mostly and more likely only affect Hindus.

( I am far more worried about that front.)\n\nIf you are worried about Investors scaring off because of Kashmir, well capitalists don't give a fuck about anything other than their profits. As long as we have saner heads in Delhi nothing will happen. Chinese are cracking skulls in Hongkong, Tibet and Xinjiang as I write this, yet global supply chains will collapse in a moment without their co-operation.\n\nRest assured if Indian PM can ensure 7%+ growth he will be well feted by most Capitals in the World (I am more worried about this tbh).\n\nIn the end, if whining of a 'Trans cutie' from r/ChapoTrapHouse or that of a victim of 'Russian Aggression' from r/politics is too much to take then it's time to do actual patriotic things in your leisure for once like doing the fundamental duties as enshrined in the Constitution.\n\nMaybe the things we are doing in Kashmir are amoral but laws of realpolitik were as true for Romans and Brits as they are for us and they were summed up by Athenian general  Thucydides as ‚ÄúRight, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can, the weak suffer what they must.‚Äù\n\nCiao."<br />Author: 'NikolaiKardashev'  id: 'cqqwvk'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cqqwvk/why_bother/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'A brief analysis of Indian Politics'<br />Body: "Broadly speaking, I can see recent events in three phases:\n\nPhase-1 (pre 2014, Left wing Dominance): Before NaMo became the PM in 2014, I didn't even remember what left/right wing means can you believe that! It was as if I was living in the blissful ignorance about politics, I simply thought all politicians are corrupt but maybe the country's PM isn't (or maybe he is, but why do I care!).\n\nPhase-2 (2014-2019, Left-Right conflict): When azaadi slogans were heard in JNU in 2016, that was the first time I knew that unpatriotic people exist in our country! I was surged with anger at the mere thought that how can someone shout anti-national slogans in our country sitting right in our capital. But I soon learned that this is just part of politics. I also learned that azaadi slogans are just the tip of the iceberg, the rot goes deep within. Heck, maoists and urban naxals have infiltrated right into our parliaments and govt. offices!\n\nPhase-3 (2019-present, Emergence of Right wing): After a whole term of conflict and politics that included several attempts from the left wing to destabilize our govt. (Rafale controversy, DeMo, Gauri Lankesh death, MeToo, etc.), we learn that our govt. not only survived all that but emerged yet again as victorious to lead another term! And now, they are not just surviving but taking the anti-nationals head on by removing article 370.\n\nLooking at all these events in retrospect, how do you think our system works? Does everything work as it looks or is there a lot going on deep within which we don't see?"<br />Author: 'eagle_monk'  id: 'cqqcbz'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cqqcbz/a_brief_analysis_of_indian_politics/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Kashmir issue: If you don't like what is being said, change the conversation."<br />Body: "Any sane person can see why abrogation of article 370 is right in every way. Some people have a problem with how it was done. Well, that's okay. It isn't done in the perfect way but that is the best way given the circumstances and 70 years of history. Right now people are trying to defend Indian government, why army is there in the valley and why it is needed? But no matter what you say about it, it looks bad. Until, you show them the alternative. Good for us, Kashmir had 70 years of autonomy and you have perfect examples to show the alternative. Not imaginations.\n\nYou don't have justify Indian government is doing. You have to tell people why Kashmiris are wrong in what they are doing. Tell people about ethnic cleansing. Tell them about discriminatory laws. Tell them how Kashmiri laws due to article 370 comply more with Sharia and less with any secular constitution based on universal declaration of human rights. Tell them why exactly Kashmiris are complaining. Tell them about their desire to make a Sharia compliant nation.\n\nBecause let us face it. Every citizen of India, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, has got the same rights. In fact you get little more freedom for being a minority which Kashmiri Muslims, the only ones complaining about it, will have. We are often told to not dwell on the past but this is perfect time to dwell on past. So that people can see what the fight is about. The fight is not just about a subset of people's right to chose. It is between democracy, secularism, and equality on one hand and discrimination, deprivation, and religious bigotry on the other hand.\n\nYes, I am an enlightened secular, liberal, libtard, centrist...whatever you might want to call me.

      <li>Title::: 'How differently did Hedgewar and Golwalkar impact the RSS?'<br />Body: 'Ideologically, RSS has been deeply influenced by the thinking of Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar (the two are known as Doctorji and Guruji respectively within the RSS). After Hedgewar‚Äôs death, Golwalkar took over as chief (sarsanghchalak) in 1940 and continued in this position till his death in 1973. Under Golwalkar, the RSS spread its presence outside Vidarbha in Maharashtra, and grew to be a national organization, creating a written constitution and expanding shakhas. Many front organizations like the Jan Sangh, the ABVP, and the VHP were all created in this period. The RSS, under Gowalkar, also played incendiary roles in events such as Gandhi‚Äôs assassination, the violence at the time of Partition etc. After independence, the Sangh increasingly started considering the question of society as a whole and began to intervene more in areas like education, industry, agriculture etc. as well.\n\nHedgewar, in his writings, had dealt extensively with some fundamental concepts, engaging with works such as Savarkar\'s concept of *Hindutva.* Savarkar\'s book is central to the RSS ideology. Howevver, when ordinary members discuss ideological issues, they often cite M. S Golwalkar, especially his *Bunch of Thoughts* (published in 1966). As has been pointed out, even if a member of the RSS has not read this book, they are familiarized with its contents at the time of training. However, the RSS has distanced itself from some works of Golwalkar\'s such as *We or Our Nationhood Defined*, published in March 1939. \n\nHedgewar was also more involved in the freedom struggle than Golwalkar. In 1930, Hedgewar endorsed Congress\' call for complete independence, and said that it was ‚Äúour duty to co-operate with any organisation working towards that goal.‚Äù Even though the RSS as an organization did not participate in the salt satyagraha, Hedgewar stated that any individual could take part in a personal capacity if they wanted to after getting permission from the Sanghachalak. This is not to say that Hedgewar didn\'t criticize the Congress. He was critical of the INC for not "protecting the Hindu Dharma and Hindu culture." However, in essence his opinion was that the RSS should ‚Äúco-operate with the Congress in the efforts to secure freedom, as long as these efforts do not come in the way of preserving our national culture.‚Äù Later, he resigned as sarsanghchalak and himself joined the salt satyagraha. \n\nHis successor Golwalkar, however, stayed away from political activity. To the call of *Quit India* in 1942, he said that Right from the beginning, the Sangh has decided to observe certain constraints in some matters.‚Äù He also said that ‚Äúthe Congress leaders did not make what they considered adequate preparations before giving the necessary directive for the agitation.‚Äù He kept the Sangh away from the freedom movement citing this lack of planning. He said, "I have realised that we cannot reach our goal even if we took part in it with all our might,‚Äù and that ‚ÄúIn such a situation, I think the Sangh‚Äôs participation in the movement would serve no purpose.‚Äù Unlike Hedgewar, Golwalkar also didn\'t take part in the movement personally. As Hartosh Singh Bal has pointed out, thought this created some disenchantment among the cadre, but might have ultimately helped the RSS to expand, since it remained one of the few organisations whose leadership remained intact in these years. Thus, Hedgewar and Golwalkar has had different impacts on the Sangh.\n\nRead more: [https://caravanmagazine.in/reportage/golwalkar-ideology-underpins-modi-india](https://caravanmagazine.in/reportage/golwalkar-ideology-underpins-modi-india)'<br />Author: 'politicsresearch'  id: 'cpqcqv'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cpqcqv/how_differently_did_hedgewar_and_golwalkar_impact/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Posting here too to get a more varied opinion on the issue of minority appeasement and the rising right wing politics'<br />Body: '[Please remember this is my personal opinion. I am open for counter arguments and honestly hoping that I am wrong as I would like for things to be better]\n\nHi,\nI\'ve been wondering about this for some time. The Indian voter had become increasingly politically polarized in recent times. Many would attribute this to the rising right wing in the country. But I believe the rise of right wing in recent time is linked to rising resentment in the majority Hindu population with the invearse in minority appeasement politics in the other mainstream parties.\n\nDemocracy works best when parties campaign on generic issues on the forefront. This leads to voters voting for the party with the best manifesto. Voters are not loyal to one party and will vote for they opposition if the current ruling party messes up.\n\nBut what if one party starts providing benefits specifically to one Minority/ group? Humans are instinctively selfish creatures and tbh if a party promises something specific to me or my community, I would vote for them. Keep doing this and you generate a messaiah subject relation with the voters, and the respective community becomes faithful to your party. This might be enough to sway the total votes to your favour, given the majority is still divided.\n\nWith time, the public is increasingly divided and hostile to other parties as it is now either their party (with the specific benefits promised) or the others, which do nothing for you. \n\nThis has carved up the voter base in India into distinct sections voting only for freebies or specific policies which only affect them, even at the expense of others.\n\nDo you guys think this is an issue in current times? \n\nIf yes how does politics go back to the way it was before? Why would a party running on appeasing a specific community give it up when this doesn\'t give them any benefits?\n\nI believe the rise of the BJP can be related to this too. With regards to my relatives living in UP, they will now not vote for SP or BSP in any situation as this will only lead to development of "other" people and believe BJP is the only way to get their voice heard. Given that my relatives are conservative hindus, and with them being the majority, how will other parties ever win, given that they have lost the majority votes to a party doing minority appeasement, only this time, it is for the majority.'<br />Author: 'unvital_archduke'  id: 'cp95eo'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cp95eo/posting_here_too_to_get_a_more_varied_opinion_on/</li>

Of course, the biggest geopolitical story of the week - the unification of India - has been discussed in this sub already. But what else has been happening in the meantime? This is the place to discuss events from around the world - the discussion does not have to be related to India. Here\'s some stories to get the discussion started:\n\n# Top 3 stories from India\'s neighbourhood\n\n1. [Hong Kong erupts in protests, again](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3022290/new-phase-protesters-and-police-clash-across-north-hong)\n\nA new round of protests erupted in Hong Kong even after the city administration dropped plans for an extradition treaty with Beijing. While the overall concerns of protesters remained the same - reversing the Communist Party\'s creeping hold over the city-state - the current protests were centered around bringing the police to account for their brutality during the last round of protests. Meanwhile, Beijing cracked down on some protesters, refusing to allow Cathay Pacific flights to use its airspace unless the Hong Kong flag carrier purged its staff of members who had participated in the protests. \n\n2. [Afghan President rejects foreign interference](https://www.dw.com/en/afghanistans-president-rejects-foreign-interference/a-49984066)\n\nWeeks before US Afghan Representative Zalmay Khalilzad is set to unveil a peace plan with the Taliban, and as Afghanistan prepares for its delayed presidential elections, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani rejected foreign interference in the country and insisted that the country\'s future would be decided by the country itself.  "Our future cannot be decided outside, whether in the capital cities of our friends, nemeses or neighbors," he said. However, this might just be all talk, as the Taliban has refused to talk to the Afghan government, which it views as illegitimate. \n\n3. [UAE withdraws from Yemen War](https://www.ft.com/content/3a8e2934-ae31-11e9-8030-530adfa879c2)\n\nThe long-drawn out war in Yemen reached a new phase, as the United Arab Emirates decided to withdraw from the war. The country has one of the most competent armies in the region, although like the main sponsor of the war (Saudi Arabia), it too depends heavily on foreigners and mercenaries as well as US-made weapons to do its fighting. It is speculated that the reason for this withdrawal is fears that a war with Iran is imminent as American sanctions bleed the country. \n\n# Top 3 stories from the rest of the world:\n\n1. [More mass shootings in the US](https://www.apnews.com/456c0154218a4d378e2fb36cd40b709d)\n\nMass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio in the US brought - yet again - into sharp focus the scourge of mass shootings in the US. In El Paso, the shooter, 21-year old Patrick Crusius, was later caught at a traffic light and claimed that he did it to target Mexicans. He had entered a Walmart with an AK-47 and multiple magazines, and killed 22 people including 8 Mexican nationals. The incident has rekindled debate on stronger background checks, which President Trump initially seemed to support but has since backed down from.\n\n2. [Five killed in mysterious explosion in Russia](https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/10/europe/russia-jet-propulsion-blast-radiation-intl/index.html)\n\nAn explosion in  Severodvinsk, Russia killed five employees of Russian nuclear agency Rosatom on what officials blamed on an accident concerning a rocket propulsion system.  "After the tests were completed, the rocket fuel ignited and detonated," the agency said. However, the local region reported that radiation levels had spiked after the explosion, although it took down that statement from its website within hours. The Russian Ministry of Defense now handles the investigation. Local reports suggested a shortage of iodine tablets as residents rushed to purchase them. Iodine is commonly used to treat radiation sickness.\n\n3. [160 migrants stranded off Italy spark war of words](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-10/italy-s-salvini-tells-richard-gere-to-take-stranded-migrants)\n\nA ship carrying 160 migrants from North Africa en-route to Italy remains stranded in international waters as Italy\'s government has refused to take them in - they claim to seek asylum. Italy\'s Deputy PM Matteo Salvini, who is currently in the midst of a snap election, asked Spain (where the ship is registered) to take them instead, although Spain has refused. Meanwhile, an NGO Open Arms that includes Hollywood actor Richard Gere appealed for Italy to take the migrants in, but was met with scorn by Salvini.  ‚ÄúAs the generous millionaire airs his demands about the fate of the Open Arms immigrants, we thank him: he will be able to bring everyone in his private jet to Hollywood and keep them in his villas,‚Äù Salvini said in a statement after Gere‚Äôs press conference.\n\n# Geopolitical History: The Great Leap Forward\n\nThis week\'s Geopolitical History continues with my series on Communist atrocities from around the world. \n\nWhen Mao Zedong took control of China after the Second Sino-Japanese War (World War II) and the Chinese Civil War, he made it amply clear that his revolution had not ended at China\'s borders. He intended to export his brand of Communism - but was constantly held up by China\'s poor, agrarian economic system and its dependence on the Soviet Union. Thus, he came up with a plan to rapidly industrialize China - in other words, to make A Great Leap Forward. At the heart of this plan was state monopolization of agriculture, banning private farming and forcing all farmers to work in collectivized farms owned by the government. Agricultural exports would then be used to fund new industries. \n\nSimple enough, but disastrous in a way that only a centralized economy can be. When the Communists came to power in 1949, they seized large landholdings and redistributed them to peasants, who depended on the land for their food, livelihood, and culture. By 1958, when the Great Leap Forward officially took off, the state once again seized the land and made it illegal to own land privately. Peasants were either forced to worked in collectivized farms, moved to new factories, or forced to produce low-quality pig iron behind their homes. \n\nFrom each farm, a portion of the grain (amounting to as much as 30%) would be taken away by the state. However, with a shortage of farmers (due to diversion of peasants to factories), production was low after an initial increase. However, fearing punishment, local Communist cadres faked production data to show record harvests, which then increased the actual quantity of grain that the state would take. This led to widespread famine and revolt, which was put down with mass executions and torture. Local cadres organized camps to force people to toe Mao\'s line... or else. These camps largely replaced traditional rural festivals and cultural practices, leading to further misery. Party members, such as Defense Minister Peng Dehuai, who spoke up against the program, were purged. At the same time, China actually exported grain to other countries and refused food aid in order to save face while people in the countryside starved to death.\n\nThe Great Leap Forward was a colossal failure. In the years that it lasted (1958-62), China\'s death rate exceeded its birth rate, something that had not happened even during the wars of that century. Its population actually shrank between 1960 and 1961. Industrial production increased initially but declined later, as food rationing in urban areas lowered productivity. This stands in contrast to Mao\'s stated objective of China exceeding Britain\'s industrial output within 15 years of the policy. About 30-40% of houses were destroyed to make way for new factories, a level of destruction that even the bombings of World War II had not achieved. The economy as a whole shrank.\n\nBut the greatest fallout was the number of deaths from this hair-brained policy: in the four years that the policy was implemented, between 18 and 56 millions died as per various estimates, which equaled and possibly exceeded all the deaths around the world combined during World War II. In 1962, the policy was ended after Mao was forced to step down as state chairman and was extensively criticized for the man-made disaster. For four years after that, Mao was sidelined and the leadership tried to reverse the effects of the policy, with some success. That process ended in 1966, when Mao launched his next deadly movement: the Cultural Revolution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat stories from the world caught your attention?

      <li>Title::: "Operation Gibraltar - One of Pakistan's many misadventures"<br />Body: ' [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation\\_Gibraltar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n&gt;**Operation Gibraltar** was the codename given to the strategy of [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan) to infiltrate [Jammu and Kashmir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir), and instigate the locals in starting a rebellion against Indian sovereignty.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Pakistan specifically chose this name to draw a parallel to the [Muslim invasion of Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_conquest_of_Hispania) that was launched from the port of [Gibraltar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar).[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-Riedel2013-7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Following the [First Kashmir War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Kashmir_War) (1947‚Äì1948), which saw India maintaining its hold over two-thirds of Kashmir, Pakistan sought an opportunity to win the remaining Kashmir areas. The opening came after the [Sino-Indian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_War) in 1962 after India\'s war with the [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China) and as a result the [Indian Military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Military) was undergoing massive changes both in personnel and equipment. During this period, despite being numerically smaller than the Indian Military, Pakistan\'s armed forces had a qualitative edge in air power and armour over India,[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-Dennis-10) which Pakistan sought to utilise before India completed its defence build-up. The [Rann of Kutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rann_of_Kutch) episode in the summer of 1965, where Indian and Pakistani forces clashed, resulted in some positives for Pakistan. Moreover, in December 1963, the disappearance of a holy relic[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-11) from the Hazratbal shrine in Srinagar, created turmoil and intense Islamic feeling among Muslims in the valley, which was viewed by Pakistan as ideal for revolt.[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-12) These factors bolstered the Pakistani command\'s thinking: that the use of covert methods followed by the threat of an all out war would force a resolution in Kashmir.[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-13)[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-14)[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-15) Assuming that a weakened Indian military would not respond, Pakistan chose to send in "[mujahideens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujahideen)" and Pakistan Army regulars into Jammu and Kashmir \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n&gt;The original plan for the operation, codenamed [Gibraltar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar), was conceived and prepared as early as the 1950s; however it seemed appropriate to push this plan forward given the scenario. Backed by then foreign minister [Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulfiqar_Ali_Bhutto) and others, the aim was an "attack by infiltration" by a specially trained irregular force of some 40,000 men, highly motivated and well armed. It was reasoned that the conflict could be confined only to Kashmir. In the words of retired Pakistani General [Akhtar Hussain Malik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhtar_Hussain_Malik), the aims were "to defreeze the Kashmir problem, weaken Indian resolve, and bring India to the conference table without provoking general war."[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-Hassan_Abbas-16) As a result, groundwork and intelligence gathering for execution of the plan was laid by launching "Operation Nusrat", the purpose of which was to locate gaps in the Cease Fire Line (CFL) that were to serve as entry points for the mujahideen, and to gauge the response of the Indian army and the local population.[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-17)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Despite initial reservations by the [President of Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Pakistan) [Ayub Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayub_Khan_(Field_Marshal)), the operation was set in motion. In the first week of August 1965, (some sources put it at 24 July)[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-Pervaiz-18) Pakistani troops who were members of [Azad Kashmir Regular Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azad_Kashmir_Regular_Force) (Now [Azad Kashmir Regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azad_Kashmir_Regiment)) began to cross the [Cease Fire Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Control) dividing Indian- and Pakistani-held Kashmir across the [Pir Panjal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pir_Panjal) Range into [Gulmarg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulmarg), [Uri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uri,_Jammu_and_Kashmir) and [Baramulla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baramulla). Several columns were to occupy key heights around the Kashmir valley and encourage a general revolt, which would be followed by direct combat by Pakistani troops. According to Indian sources as many as 30,000[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-kvkr-4)[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-Rediff-19) ‚Äì 40,000 men had crossed the line, while Pakistani sources put it at 5,000 -7,000 only.[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-20) These troops known as the "Gibraltar Force"[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-kvkr-4) were organized and commanded by Major General [Akhtar Hussain Malik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhtar_Hussain_Malik), GoC 12 Division [\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-Mustasad-5)[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-Sukhwant-6) The troops were divided into 10 forces (5 companies each).[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-kvkr-4) The 10 forces were given different code names, mostly after historically significant [Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim) rulers.[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-Rediff-19) The operation\'s name, [Gibraltar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar), itself was chosen for the [Islamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam) connotations.[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-21) The 8th century [Umayyad conquest of Hispania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_conquest_of_Hispania) was launched from Gibraltar, a situation not unlike that Pakistan envisaged for Indian Kashmir, i.e. conquest of Kashmir from Operation Gibraltar. The areas chosen were mainly on the de facto Cease Fire line as well as in the populous Kashmir Valley.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The plan was multi-pronged. Infiltrators would mingle with the local populace and incite them to rebellion. Meanwhile, [guerrilla warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare) would commence, destroying [bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge), tunnels and highways, harassing enemy [communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication), logistic installations and headquarters as well as attacking airfields,[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-22) with a view to create the conditions of an "armed insurrection" in Kashmir ‚Äî leading to a national uprising against Indian rule. It was assumed that India would neither counter-attack,[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-23) nor involve itself in another full-scale war, and the capture of Kashmir would rapidly follow. Out of the 9 Infiltrating Forces, only [Ghaznavi Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghaznavi_Force) under command Maj [Malik Munawar Khan Awan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malik_Munawar_Khan_Awan) managed to achieve its objective in Mehndar-Rajouri area.\n\n \n\n&gt;While the covert infiltration was a complete failure that ultimately led to the [Indo-Pakistani War of 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1965), military analysts have differed on whether the plan itself was flawed. Some have held that the plan was well-conceived but was let down by poor execution\\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\\], but almost all Pakistani and neutral analysts have maintained that the entire operation was "a clumsy attempt"[\\[28\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-28) and doomed to collapse. **The Pakistani Army\'s failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir. The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt. Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of Operation Gibraltar and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars**.[\\[29\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-Mankekar1967-29)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;According to then Chief of the [Pakistan Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Air_Force), [Air Marshal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Marshal) [Nur Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nur_Khan), there was little coordination amongst the military services on the impending operation.[\\[30\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-30) Pakistani author [Pervaiz Iqbal Cheema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervaiz_Iqbal_Cheema) notes that [Muhammad Musa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Musa), Pakistan\'s [Chief of the Army Staff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Chiefs_of_Army_Staff,_Pakistan), was reportedly so confident that the plan would succeed and conflict would be localized to Kashmir that he did not inform the Air Force, as he believed the operation would not require any major air action.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-Pervaiz-18) Many senior Pakistani military officers and political leaders were unaware of the impending crisis, thus surprising not only India, but also Pakistan itself.[\\[31\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar#cite_note-31)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Many senior officials also were against the plan, as a failure could lead to an all-out war with India, which many wanted to avoid'<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'coxhn5'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/coxhn5/operation_gibraltar_one_of_pakistans_many/</li>

Chinese exporters hand over their $ at the gate and take Yuan issued/printed by the govt, into China depnding on what the exchange rate set by the Chinese govt is.\n\nAmerica therefore howls and says "Oo! look you are manipulating your currency" because the yuan-to-$ rate is set by the govt. However, with America being the largest buyer of Chinese goods, the supply of $ to China is controlled by the US by virtue of imports from China. Americans import and pay in $ &lt;-- this was done when they WON World War 2. Normally, the buyer of imported goods pays in the currency of the manufacturer. \n\nAmerica\'s the only country that\'s allowed this luxury of paying for goods, in their own currency, by virtue of having won WW2. Anyhow, because of tariffs, the Chinese have to increase printing of Yuan and pay the same Yuan amount to their importers - this causes inflation in China. \n\n**Basically the Chinese workers are working for \'free\'. Why?** **Because they need to preserve manufacturing in case of a war.**\n\nWhich means **they HAVE TO Export and force-feed America goods** BUT the price of Chinese raw materials still has to be payed - which means **there\'s a point where this stratergy of force-feeding goods won\'t work.**\n\nThe Rupee is going to get squished anyhow because we are a weak country and cannot \'defend\' our country. \n\nWhat is interesting is how the US retains $ strength vs Yuan**, allowing them to buy resources in a recession AT A DISCOUNT:** because everyone who buys oil supports the $ (oil payments are billed in $). \n\nTherefore the obvious conclusion is that China will lose a war with the US - they can\'t buy resources to fight a war with the USA.\n\n**However China has better infrastructure, colleges, schools, manufacturing and loads of educated people:** while the US has a strong army. \n\nMy point is this: China/Russia/India can polarize the world because PEOPLE ARE THE ULTIMATE resource. **By offering FREE schooling for everyone**, **in China/Russia/India**, they can create a vacuum of people between Africa/Asia and the West. A kind of \'dead zone\' which the West has to traverse to reach China.  **People can bring resources to China - a barter system - Free education for resources/work-in-China** till this American threat passes**.** \n\nThere\'s little America can do if people want to study and improve their lives IN China.

      <li>Title::: "Why weren't Kashmiris asked when removing 370? Because they simply don't deserve it."<br />Body: 'So this question has come up a lot in our mainstream media, and so far, even the the supporters of the move have been giving out politically correct answers, or just resorting to plain what-aboutism about how this is a decision in the national interest. \n\nThe truth is nobody is ready to address the elephant in the room. So let me just do that. Why weren\'t the Kashmiris asked? Because they simply don\'t deserve it.\n\nAs a community who is in Majority, and yes I am talking about the Kashmiri Muslims, they have proven them to unfit to govern themselves. The reasons why we have a federal structure, albeit much weaker than federal systems in the west, is because we believe that individual states should have a fair degree of autonomy to govern themselves according to their own needs as long as what they are doing don\'t really jeopardise the values of the nation. \n\nThis is exactly the argument I want to make why Kashmiri people and the local government deserved to be disenfranchised in this exercise of what to do with 370. The local governments and the local people not only allowed but actually perpetuated ethnic cleansing of a major community from the land. \n\nI mean, yeah, We have had riots in almost every state and things have returned to normalcy. But when did we have an entire community ousted from their homelands (Kairana? Well who are the perpetrators again?). By just virtue of this, the Kashmiris have lost the right to self govern and need to be handled by the scruff of their necks to bring order to the land. And when the state machinery fails to do that, the centre has to intervene, which is exactly why making it a UT makes total sense. \n\nAgain, we have had arguments that the youth is misguided because they don\'t have jobs and they have been fed propaganda. True, but at max, this can affect their political outlook. But what happened to Pandits at hands of these very "misguided public" roots from something much deeper than politics. I vehemently oppose the Congress and I\'d like to see them go in single digits, but would I go about raping their women and killing their men? No!\n\nWhy? Because the differences are political. To stoop to such a low level, the motivating forces has to be much deeper than that of a political identity. Yes, we have had political murders and riots, but to bring out about mass demographic changes? Naaah. \n\nSo to address the elephant in the room, the problem with Valley is that it\'s majority Muslim. Unlike Dharmic Religions, Islamic is by its inception, is as much as of political philosophy as a spiritual one. If a place has majority Muslims, their Muslim identities will mingle with their political aspirations, and given the sort of "respect" Islam has for other religions, it would always wreak havoc on other communities whether be it Pakistan or Kashmir. \n\nI sincerely hope this all talk of uplifting poor in Kashmir is either Dharmic Taqqiya or just a small part of the bigger solution by Modi-Shah. Because as long as political Islam doesn\'t have a worthy rival in the valley, it would never be a land of Indian values. And there\'s one, albeit a rather ugly solution for it, Demographic Change.\n\nStart settling dharmics in Jammu first, then have delimitation increasing the number of seats in Jammu. Give JK it\'s first Hindu CM. I\'m not advocating killing for any community. Given the state is not very populated, the influx of a huge number of dharmics can do the job.'<br />Author: 'stolenrhymes'  id: 'cohc0u'<br />Score:80<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cohc0u/why_werent_kashmiris_asked_when_removing_370/</li>

      <li>Title::: "[NP] Dhrupad: One of India's oldest classical forms of music"<br />Body: "I attended a Dhrupad concert, and it pained me to see such a wonderful performance only being attended by a handful of people. I believe in the larger scene of Indian classical music (which itself is a bit neglected), dhrupad goes somewhat unnoticed. I don't claim to be an expert on Dhrupad - far from it. I am just a beginner listener who happened to fall in love with this form, and want to share this with other people - to show them a glimpse of what it is like.\n\nBut the first question - what is dhrupad?\n\n&gt;Dhrupad is the most ancient style of Hindustani classical music that has survived until today in its original form. The Dhrupad tradition is a major tradition of Indian culture.\n\n&gt;The nature of Dhrupad music is spiritual. Seeking not to entertain, but to induce feelings of peace and contemplation in the listener. The word Dhrupad is derived from DHRUVA the steadfast evening star that moves through our galaxy and PADA meaning poetry. It is a form of devotional music that traces its origin to the ancient text of Sam Veda. The SAM VEDA was chanted with the help of melody and rhythm called Samgana. Gradually this developed into other vocal style called ‚ÄòChhanda‚Äô and ‚ÄòPrabandha‚Äô with introduction of verse and meter. The fusion of these two elements led to the emergence of Dhrupad.\n\n&gt;The language of Dhrupad changed from Sanskrit Brij Bhasha some time between the 12th and the 16th century. About six centuries ago, Dhrupad came to be patronised by the royal courts and its complex rendering became intended for highly sophisticated royal audiences. The compositions became more secular. Some were written in praise of the emperors; others elaborated on music itself. However the pristine nature of Dhrupad survived and even today we hear this majestic form of music performed like it was more that 500 years ago in the royal courts of the emperors and kings of India.\n\nI don't want to make this too long, and you can read more about it online easily.\n\nBut the most important part - status of Dhrupad in India right now.\n\nHere is what Ustad Bahauddin Dagar, from the Dagar gharana and who plays the rudra veena, has to say about Dhrupad's future in India, taken from [here](https://www.darbar.org/article/ustad-bahauddin-dagar-interview/22)\n\n&gt;Meanwhile, audiences back in India have steadily dwindled, with material support proving hard to come by for such decidedly irreducable, non-commercial music. The resulting geographical disbalance led the late vocalist Ustad Sayeeduddin Dagar, Bahauddin‚Äôs great-uncle, to quip that ‚Äúone day dhrupad will be imported to India‚Äù.\n\n&gt;Two days after the performance I met with Bahauddin, and we discussed the music‚Äôs curious modern context over a somewhat jarring backdrop of coffee-house Sinatra. ‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt find a concert like that in India, with three hours of solo rudra veena. Producers there won‚Äôt take the risks. At the end of her life [Hindustani vocal pioneer] Kishori Amonkar said she wanted to do a concert with no tabla, but even then none of the organisers would let her‚Äù.\n\n&gt;But how did this situation come about? Surely cities such as Benares have enough dhrupad devotees to fill several auditoriums? ‚ÄúThe sponsors have a very big say. They want particular artists, and can even request particular renditions. The organisers may be obliged to try and make this happen‚Äù.\n\nFinally, some performance if you want to give it a try:\n\n[Raag Bhimpalasi - Pt.

      <li>Title::: 'Who is the Dassault-Reliance partnership really benefiting?'<br />Body: ' From an initial wealth of $42 billion in 2008 after Ambani established the Reliance conglomerate, the latest financial figures on his core companies (Reliance Infrastructure Limited, Reliance Capital Limited, Reliance Communications Limited and Reliance Power Limited) show a total debt of $15 billion. In such a scenario, the Rafale deal was a lifeline to the corporation. With the deal would come a massive infusion of funds. The Rafale deal itself requires that around Rs. 30,000 crore rupees be pumped back into Indian industry, and since Dassault has made a subsidiary of Reliance its main partner, this reinvestment will mainly benefit reliance. In 2017 alone Reliance secured business worth Rs. 21,000 crore with Dassault. In July 2018, Dassault announced a ‚Ç¨100-million investment in its joint venture with Reliance Group as well. This is in spite of the fact that the Reliance Group has had a history of delivering much lesser than is promised (see the cases of power plants, a line in the Delhi metro etc). Ultimately once cannot deny that this is an example of government initiatives strangely coinciding with Ambani‚Äôs interests. \n\nRead:  [https://caravanmagazine.in/business/india-gambles-defence-interests-reliance-group](https://caravanmagazine.in/business/india-gambles-defence-interests-reliance-group)'<br />Author: 'businesspolitics'  id: 'co2xdb'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/co2xdb/who_is_the_dassaultreliance_partnership_really/</li>

He was hit by a 4 wheeler coming from the left road on a junction/square (‡§ö‡•å‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡§æ) when he was crossing the square, driving straight on his 2 wheeler. The 4 wheeler guy immediately brought us to the hospital. My husband received first aid and underwent surgery the next day as he broke his left radius and ulna (forearm bones). He will be recovering in 3 months time as per the doctor.\n\nA policeman came to record my husband's statement on a plain A4 sheet. He wrote it in Telugu and someone translated it for us to English. All details were correct. Now, I have a few questions.\n\n1) Since the policeman took the statement, does this mean an FIR has been already filed by us? Or the statement he took was just a statement but FIR will be filed after we agree to filing it?\n\n2) The policeman called us yesterday to collect the FIR (its been a week). Does merely collecting the FIR equate to lodging a case against the 4 wheeler guy? We don't intend to file a case against him as he's ready to pay compensation and we're ready too. (Our family hasn't decided an amount though)\n\n3) Can a filed FIR be withdrawn? How? (General question)\n\n4) Do we need to involve the police while doing the compensation conversation with the 4 wheeler guy, or should it be done outside the police station in private with the guy with no involvement of police?\n\nI request people who have been in road accidents and went through the process to answer these questions. Also, any lawyers or people with knowledge of legal matters, please provide your advice.\n\nA few more details: \n\n* My husband and I are both government officers and our organization took care for all the medical bills.\n\n* We live in Andhra Pradesh but are not from here.\n\n* The policeman asked for Rs.1000/- when he took the statement.

This will ensure improved speed, service, safety and create capacity. As part of Mission Raftaar, Indian Railways is working in mission mode to improve the average speed of trains across the network. Increasing the speed of the Delhi-Mumbai Section to 160 Kmph will ensure upto 60% increase in average speed of passenger trains and doubling of average speed of freight traffic.\n\nThe 1,483 Kms long Delhi-Mumbai Route passes through 7 states, namely Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra. The travel time between New Delhi and Mumbai will be reduced by 3.5 hours, now making it a fully overnight journey. Increasing the maximum speed of the Delhi-Mumbai route will also give further impetus to semi-high speed trains. It will allow such trains to unlock their full potential and travel at a speed of 160 Kmph, to ensure passengers have best in class speed and service. In addition, it has been found that the safer LHB coaches too can be made fit for this speed.\n\nThe scope of the project includes fencing, Automatic Train Protection System (ETCS 2/TPWS), Mobile Train Radio Communication, and automated and mechanised diagnostic systems, which will considerably enhance safety and reliability. Besides the above main inputs, the policy also requires removal of all level crossings which are being eliminated otherwise under a separate plan head.\n\nThe entire project has been structured on a new approach of route wise single composite work with single agency execution, and complete funding through\xa0 Extra Budgetary Resources - Institutional Finance (ERB-IF). With improved funding, better coordination, economies of scale, and induction of state of the art technology, the project will be completed in 4 years from the date of approval.\xa0 Furthermore, work along the line will be planned with minimum disruption of traffic, ensuring passengers and businesses are least affected during the construction phase.\n\nThe project will help boost employment during the construction phase with more than 3.6 crore mandays to be generated directly. It will also help kick start an economic multiplier that will give a boost to growth in all states. The project will also lead to an increase in throughput on the route by 30-35%, paving the way for PPP models in the future.\n\nAs a part of Mission Raftaar, Government has also granted similar approval for the Delhi-Howrah route, which together with the Delhi-Mumbai route account for 29% of passenger traffic and 20% of freight traffic. Railways is also working to cover the complete Golden Quadrilateral and Diagonals of Indian Railways, which consist of 16% of the total Indian Railways Network, but account for 52% of total passenger traffic and 58% of total freight traffic.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n**VRRK/SH**'<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'cni2jw'<br />Score:38<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cni2jw/mission_raaftar_govt_approves_projects_to/</li>

Govt could have easily waited until winter when the valley would have been frozen (less infiltration chance and too cold for protests). Well, it has everything to do with USA.  \n\n\n**America is desperate for a deal with Taliban, so they can pull out their troops from Afghanistan.** And, the only country that can broker the deal is Pakistan, which is why IK was invited to the white house last month for negotiations. Once a deal is brokered (which it looks like will be announced next month), Pakistan would have complete leverage to ask favors from the US. The reason being is that the deal has a transition period during which peace must be maintained by Taliban and only after which the US will start pulling out the troops. Pakistan can easily disrupt or blackmail to disrupt the peace to prevent American retreat to continue to hold the leverage. Pakistan knows it will never be able to solve the Kashmir issue bilaterally in its favor nor win in a conventional warfare with India, so it is trying to rope in US for arbitration. Modi and Shah had to do something before the deal was announced as America would not allow anything to jeopardize the peace deal after, and, hence, they urgently had to scrap it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecondly, once the Taliban takes over Afghanistan, I doubt all of its fighter will drop their guns and jump into a civilian life. **Taliban fighters will look for next target and Kashmir is a big prize.** Pakistan can easily divert the fighters towards J&amp;K through back channel funding and support. This actually happened in the past - after the Soviet retreat from Afghanistan there was a huge spike in militancy in Kashmir. The current J&amp;K political families right out blackmail India and sometimes even work with Pakistan for their own agenda. Anyway, it would become a thorny issue for India in the next couple of decades due to infiltration, constant terror attacks, and a risk of rise in separatist sentiment. This would explain why Shah wanted J&amp;K to be a UT, so that the central govt. can control the security tightly, without any blackmail and double games from the local govt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was an explosion in Kabul today claimed by Taliban, which was uncalled for, particularly when the deal was almost finalized with US. It was actually a warning message by Pakistan - no peace with Taliban unless the US takes care of Kashmir issue. Immediately after this, US has dispatched its SouthAsian affairs secy to Pakistan. You can interpret the rest.\n\nEither way, I'm glad 370 is gone. I really hope it will integrate J&amp;K with India, bring in economic progress in Kashmiri and reduce the infiltration and attacks. But I'm scared for the future. Buckle up boys, we have barely solved the actual problem. My worst fear is that if a fragile coalition comes into power in future, then it might be forced to declare J&amp;K as a state for support in parliament, which would take it back to the same old days. I dont even have any ideas how India would tackle this in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResources:\n\n[An Excellent Reading about this](https://www.orfonline.org/research/jammu-kashmir-and-ladakh-exploring-a-new-paradigm-54185/)"<br />Author: 'chocolate_muffin'  id: 'cnf0ok'<br />Score:106<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cnf0ok/explained_why_it_became_extremely_urgent_to_scrap/</li>

      <li>Title::: "How removing 370/35A WRECKS Pakistan's plans towards India"<br />Body: 'Some people seem to think that Pakistan remains relatively unaffected by India\'s abrogation of 370/35A. While for India, obviously this is an internal matter, for Pakistan it is much more than that.\n\n#Pakistan has suffered a MASSIVE setback in their India Policy.\n\nIt undermines Pak\'s long-term goals in the region irrevocably. \n\nIn fact, it destroys them altogether. Pakistan\'s entire strategy has fallen apart.\n\nGhazwa-e-Hind has not been postponed. It has been *cancelled*.\n\n______________________\n\nLet\'s back up a step. \n\n#What is Pak\'s long term goal in the region?\n\nPak, since Day 1 of partition, has been after the strategically significant region of J&amp;K. This was not out of any love for their population - the population is irrelevant aside from the convenient fact that it was Muslim Majority already, that made it an effective **tool**. The last part is clearly established by [Pak\'s treatment of the residents of PoK](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cmrqbz/we_are_part_of_india_poks_gilgitbaltistan/ew4lkkt/). The fact that they\'ve been after it from Day 1, is evidenced by the initial attack on J&amp;K immediately after partition, when they were afraid the Raja was going to accede to India - in a classic Picklestaini blunder, their actions precipitated *precisely* that. However they managed to wrest control of about 1/3rd of the state of J&amp;K, in the ensuing war. \n\n#WHY would they want this land from Day 1 though? \n\nAs it was (without PoK) their northern borders were still in a very defensible position, among difficult terrain, lots of high-ground. They were quite well-situated with traversable borders to Afg, Iran, and India for trade, reasonably good port locations, 5 rivers flowing through, some of the most fertile lands in the region after the Gangetic plain. They controlled the vast majority of Punjab. Hell, they had another section of their country on the other side of India (flanking it like two guns pressed into India\'s ribcage) that also held some prime ports, as well as the silt-rich highly navigable fertile outflow delta of the aforementioned Gangetic Basin. **Pak literally got the best deal ever. Multiple ports, less population, huge tracts of fertile land, borders for trade, naturally defensible territory, a tactical advantage over the only potential threat, all of it!** They were pretty damn set. Right?\n\nBut Pak was founded on animosity and supremacism. The belief that Muslims could NOT live with Hindus, and a Muslim state free of Hindu savages would be more prosperous. It was the 1947 equivalent of *"hurr durr let\'s just give B*\\**MA.RU states away to Pak"*, except all non-Muslim states were the "B\\*MA.RU" here. Because they were imagining that a country without *"the burden of these ungovernable infidels"* was gonna be a cakewalk.\n\nThat supremacist ideology has been carefully nurtured over eons (and was even more amplified encouraged in Pak, post partition). \n\n###But there are other things too:\n\n1. Pak already had a huge border with Afg. But the old land trade-routes that India used to use, all ran THROUGH PAKISTAN... except via Kashmir. Because through Kashmir, India had a direct line to a narrow stretch of Afghan Border going literally over Pak\'s head. And Pak couldn\'t have that. They wanted to absolutely DOMINATE India. India *deserved* to be their vassal state, looking to their "Mughal-descended" overlords for permission to pass into Asia by land. Paying duties and taxes as per the whims of the Pak govt. And vice versa, for trade going *into* India. Pak could get tax revenue for every pistachio crossing its borders, despite 99% of the consumers AND producers of those Pistas, being OUTSIDE their borders. It would become the ideal middleman. No overhead, max profit.\n2. Pak did not like the idea of their rivers - their lifeline - all passing through India. If India realized the blade they held at Pak\'s throat, *surely* those scheming infidels would use it without hesitation. Who wouldn\'t? Pak knew *it* sure would! So they needed to strike first obviously. Purely self-defense you see.\n3. It was not enough for Pak\'s territory to be naturally defensible from the north. Pak wanted to hold the *ABSOLUTE ADVANTAGE* over India in the north. They wanted to hold the highest territory with the greatest shelling range. They wanted to have total tactical dominance. They wanted to be able to sweep down and capture Delhi within hours, whenever they felt like it was convenient or necessary to do so. At least part of Pakistan still dreamed of turning India into a Caliphate (and getting rid of all the pesky Hindus), owing to their poisonous ideology. And if they were to ever control all of J&amp;K, they WOULD be able to literally reach Delhi in a matter of hours. Pakis were absolutely correct about that.\n\n###So.. it was about controlling Trade, Water, and Strategic Military Positioning... (and hating kaffirs)\n\nBut while they managed their first objective, and blocked our only route to access the rest of Asia by land, they did not manage to gain control of the rivers, nor did they manage to capture the highest ground. \n\nOver the years, given how India stated progressing faster, held greater military might, defeated them repeatedly, Pakistan started to have to invent lies and tell fairy-tales to their kids and population, lest they find out that the whole "Idea of Pakistan" ^([the supremacist mentality, that Muslims cannot live and progress alongside Hindus, and that they need a separate Islamic land to truly flourish]) was just plain lies. Generation after generation grew up indoctrinated, that evil Hindu India was the enemy and great Muslim Pakistan was the only solution to India\'s \'aggression\'.\n\nBut above of all that, sits the fantasy/prophecy of turning India 100% Islamic from top to bottom. Ghazwa-e-Hind. Google it. And the route for Ghawza-e-Hind. And the route for that.. the one to be used by their Jihadi crusaders in the coming decades for their Holy War... would go from Kashmir to Delhi, and then to the rest of India. \n\n#So where does Article 370/35A come into this?\n\n**Some background facts:** Keep in mind that the atmosphere was *highly* vitiated around the time of partition and for a long time after, across the subcontinent, and people with the same ideology that formed the Razakars existed in many parts of undivided India. Among certain \'Islamist\' segments of Muslims ^([keep in mind, many common Muslims did not engage in this and there are also positive tales of heroism and friendship from every segment of society]), this crystallized into a POLICY of sorts, that focused on precipitating demographic change in certain \'contested\' regions. When exactly this emerged, I am uncertain, but it was DEFINITELY in existence before the date of partition.\n\nSo when the first invasion of Kashmir failed in 1948, the Pakis realized that they were probably not gonna be able to grab Kashmir in a direct face-off against India, unless they used the local Muslim population, demographics, and Islamist indictrination. \n\n###So let me lay down the sequence events as they happened:\n\n* Pakis demand J&amp;K (bcuz Muslim majority = Bakispam).\n* Pakiscam INVADE FIRST in a surprise attack (fearing Raja would accede to India).\n* Raja Accedes to India (**Paki**chu face). \n* The accession document signed is the exact same, down to the comma, as the one signed by every other state btw. (No special pre-conditions or *\'promises made to ppl of J&amp;K\'* gobshite. Nothing.)\n* India gets involved, defends the rest of J&amp;K, but there\'s a ceasefire (at now-LoC).\n* Pakistank start *SCREAMING* for a referendum, NOW!.. AFTER trying to capture it by force and failing. (This was never an Indian demand).\n* Now remember, Puky leadership hope that IF referendum is held, JK Muslim majority will pick Ummah over Life/Future **if kept stupid and illiterate enough**.\n* Pak conspires with Sheikh Abdullah while the J&amp;K Constitution was being made.\n* Abdullah raises a demand for 370 (out of the blue) as a kind of "POST-HOC-precondition for acceding to India". (Like.. wtf?)\n* Nehrutiya agrees like a dribbling tard, and hammers it through without parliamentary approval.\n* 370 allows them to add some "interesting" laws... ALL THESE ARE FOCUSED AROUND ONLY ONE THING. Betterment for the people of J&amp;K? Not at all. It was purely **to enable population manipulation**. That was all. Women who marry an **Indian non-resident**, have their own resident status revoked, LOSE ALL PROPERTY, inheritance, etc etc. Women who marry *PAKISTANIS FROM ACROSS THE BORDER* not only can stay, but the Paki men get resident status... in an INDIAN state. Men have no such restrictions. Outsiders are barred from resident status. No mention of minorities. Total subjugation of non-Muslim regions of J&amp;K. Enabling massacres and jihad. Opacity of funding and banking. Fuckall education of kids (keep \'em dumb remember?). Many were denied voting rights. Some Dalits were made residents but there was a condition... it only applied as long as they continued to work in manual scavenging and "dirty" jobs like sanitation. Even worse.. their KIDS HAD TO also work in the same jobs - if they tried finding a better profession, their residency was revoked. So multiple generations of sanitation workers BY LAW. Etc etc etc.\n\nThe end goal was to make the entire state SO HOSTILE to non-Muslims, and SO FULL of bonafide Pakis, that they\'d all simply leave and THEN Pak would pull out the trump card of "UN Resolution", hold plebiscite, win via its gradually planted \'residents\', nonexistent non-Muslims, and gain full control of the **entire state of J&amp;K.**\n\nIn the middle, both nations became nuclear powers. Terrorism also became a useful tool as they learned in Afg, since they could not win against India headon. But that\'s mostly irrelevant to this, besides ruling out a direct military conquest altogether...\n\n[contd..]'<br />Author: 'fsm_vs_cthulhu'  id: 'cncazr'<br />Score:131<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cncazr/how_removing_37035a_wrecks_pakistans_plans/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'In detail: Everything about Kashmir, Article 370, 35A and how it was created. Do not Miss.'<br />Body: '\n                            35A\n\nThe Presidential Order was issued under Article 370 (1) (d) of the Constitution. This provision allows the President to make certain ‚Äúexceptions and modifications‚Äù to the Constitution for the benefit of ‚ÄòState subjects‚Äô of Jammu and Kashmir.\nSo Article 35A was added to the Constitution as a testimony of the special consideration the Indian government accorded to the ‚Äòpermanent residents‚Äô of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n         \nThe parliamentary route of lawmaking was bypassed when the President incorporated Article 35A into the Constitution. Article 368 (i) of the Constitution empowers only Parliament to amend the Constitution. So did the President act outside his jurisdiction? Is Article 35A void because the Nehru government did not place it before Parliament for discussion? A five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court in its March 1961 judgment in Puranlal Lakhanpal vs. The President of India discusses the President‚Äôs powers under Article 370 to ‚Äòmodify‚Äô the Constitution. Though the court observes that the President may modify an existing provision in the Constitution under Article 370, the judgment is silent as to whether the President can, without the Parliament‚Äôs knowledge, introduce a new Article. This question remains open.\nA writ petition filed by NGO We the Citizens challenges the validity of both Article 35A and Article 370. It argues that four representatives from Kashmir were part of the Constituent Assembly involved in the drafting of the Constitution and the State of Jammu and Kashmir was never accorded any special status in the Constitution. Article 370 was only a ‚Äòtemporary provision‚Äô to help bring normality in Jammu and Kashmir and strengthen democracy in that State, it contends. The Constitution-makers did not intend Article 370 to be a tool to bring permanent amendments, like Article 35A, in the Constitution.\nThe petition said Article 35 A is against the ‚Äúvery spirit of oneness of India‚Äù as it creates a ‚Äúclass within a class of Indian citizens‚Äù. Restricting citizens from other States from getting employment or buying property within Jammu and Kashmir is a violation of fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.\nA second petition filed by Jammu and Kashmir native Charu Wali Khanna has challenged Article 35A for protecting certain provisions of the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution, which restrict the basic right to property if a native woman marries a man not holding a permanent resident certificate. ‚ÄúHer children are denied a permanent resident certificate, thereby considering them illegitimate,‚Äù the petition said.\n\n\n The Supreme Court is hearing a PIL petition challenging the constitutional validity of Article 35A.  Article 35A allows the Jammu and Kashmir legislature to define the list of ‚Äòpermanent residents‚Äô of the state, who\n  \n1. Are eligible to vote \n \n2. Can work for the state government\n \n3. Can own land, buy property\n \n4. Can secure public employment and college admissions, etc.\n \nNon-permanent residents are denied all these rights.'<br />Author: 'shassamyak'  id: 'cmcpk6'<br />Score:99<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cmcpk6/in_detail_everything_about_kashmir_article_370/</li>

Many anti-terrorists missions are carried out in the state. Due to this the separatists and other militant groups are more agitated over this. They try more to retaliate back at the Indian army. Events like Uri, Pulwama happen and then India strikes back. All these 5+ years the valley is in constant unrest. \n\nNow BJP in Dec 2018 pulls out of the coalition with the Mufti government because they feel Mufti is not cooperating with them. J&amp;K goes under President's rule since then, means the Governor as per the Constitution. In June 2019, when the J&amp;K assembly elections were to be taken place the EC sent officials to see and report if the conditions were conducive for elections. The 3 EC observers found out it was not the case. EC was also against the idea of having Assembly and Lok Sabha elections at the same time. As a result the assembly elections were decided to take place at the end of 2019.\n\nFinal Blow, according to article 370, being temporary. transitional and special provision it can be abolished by the President with discussion with the J&amp;K assembly.

      <li>Title::: 'How I got airtel to fix Coverage &amp; Connectivity issues'<br />Body: "I'd been a long time Vodafone India user who recently (about 5 months back) ported to Airtel due to the network and coverage issues I encountered in my residential telecom circle. \n\nPorting into Airtel was no different since coverage and connectivity issues at my place (were) are bad. The housing society doesn't allow any network equipment anywhere within the confines and unfortunately for me (from a network perspective), I live in an area surrounded by tall buildings and lush green cover with big trees. But I mostly got fairly decent coverage/speed for my mobile data needs in other places. \n\nI first raised the no connectivity issue through the my Airtel application and recieved a call from Airtel's network team to inform me of upgradation of a nearby cellular site without a definite ETA. \n\nI then went ahead and emailed Airtel's national escalation team (net@airtel.com) about the concern with an offer to help in anyway I can help solve the coverage issue. Promptly, I got a call from the NET team and another call was scheduled with Airtel's network team for the same evening. \n\nI explained the dBm readings (118-122 dBm) to the person concerned and a site visit was scheduled at my billing address the next day. The readings were  just as I had told them. Even band 8, which wasn't yet officially reframed for LTE had terrible signal strength. One could've blamed my cellular device but it has Snapdragon X20 modem and device factor was ruled out. \n\nFor the next two week after the RF engineer visited, there wasn't much that I could do since there were no updates on what could be done. I then decided to send Airtel NET team daily e-mails about my network connectivity issues with signal strength readings. I also marked circle nodal officer and circle CEO on these. Needless to say, I did tell them that I will port out if they cannot provide me the services I pay for. \n\nIt took about 150+ emails over a period of roughly under three months and three more of RF engineer visitations for Airtel to install a Femtocell at my house. Yes, 150+ emails :) \n\nThe Femtocell connects you to the TSP's core network through a broadband connection and generates cellular signals within a small area. Mine is good for about 3000 sqft. Think of it as a personal mini-cell tower within your house. The Femtocell is a single band (Band 3, 1800 MHz) manufactured by a UK based company called: IP Access. Speed on this is capped at 32mbps which is more than sufficient for me. But call clarity is fantastic and allows me to attend calls without any problems. The network strength is about 70-85 dBm throughout my house post installation of the Femtocell.\n\nGlobally, French Telecom company _Free_ gave Femtocell's to its customers for connectivity issues and because it was paying over 2 billion euros in roaming payments to other major French TSP's. Verizon sells these LTE Femtocell's for about 250 USD off the counter.  They are manufactured by Samsung. Unlike Vodafone UK's Femtocell, I cannot register the numbers that can access the network through it. Any Airtel user in the vicinity can latch onto the network generated by the Femtocell. I've not had any problems with overloading as of yet, but I don't mind if someone can benefit from this. \n\nThis is certainly one way to go about if telecom operators are serious about improving QOS and retaining customer churn. Happy to answer any questions, if at all. \n\nTL;DR- Got Airtel to install a Femtocell at my location after 150+ emails sent to its customer service team to improve network connectivity."<br />Author: 'GauMataCo'  id: 'clvuiu'<br />Score:30<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/clvuiu/how_i_got_airtel_to_fix_coverage_connectivity/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'A few thoughts on the Kashmir issue'<br />Body: "For the past 80 years, India and Pakistan have continued to engage in a series of bitter political disputes, with the Kashmir issue being the most sensitive political dispute. Before we find a solution to the Kashmir issue, we must understand why there is turmoil in Kashmir. \n\nBefore the partition of India, Kashmir was one of the largest princely states in British India. The region, to this day, is predominantly Muslim. During the partition, The Maharaja of Kashmir wished for an independent Kashmir because he felt that it wouldn't benefit from joining either Pakistan nor India. Many political parties accepted this decision, except an Islamic political party, which was at the time (and still is) allied with Pakistan.\n\nPakistan made various efforts into convincing the Maharaja of Kashmir to acceed to Pakistan, and when a decision couldn't be reached, Pakistan chose to support a rebellion in Poonch, which  ended up exploiting a great amount of political unrest and instability in Kashmir. As a result of this and the subsequent events that followed, many people were killed. This rising rebellion also prompted many Hindus and Sikhs to fight back as well, further exacerbating the tensions in the region. The counter violence is believed by many Muslims to be sponsored by the Maharaja. \n\nFacing a difficult decision, the Maharaja of Kashmir eventually came over to India and asked for assistance regarding the rising Muslim rebellion. India agreed, under the condition that Kashmir join India. The Maharaja accepted, and Kashmir joined India. Over the course of the next few years, India and Pakistan would continue to fight and engage in skirmishes in the region, putting many people at risk of death, grave injury, and being internally displaced. \n\nWhether we accept it or not, the Maharaja of Kashmir was right all along. India's presence hasn't really helped the Muslim population as many of them are very resentful towards everything Indian, and have resorted to joining militant and insurgent groups that aim to forcefully remove India's presence in the region and join Pakistan. Many insurgent groups reside in Pakistan, and it would not come as a surprise if it turns out that Pakistan is actually sponsoring and funding those terror groups. Continued military excesses from India and Pakistan to help simmer the tension in the region doesn't really help the local population that much either. \n\nIt goes without saying that the real culprit of this mess is the British Empire. The partition of India was a poorly executed plan that ended up causing more trouble than what it solved, and nothing good came out of it. Their poor organisation and execution of colonialism are the sole reason why India and Pakistan continue to fight."<br />Author: 'Krenoso'  id: 'clu3sd'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/clu3sd/a_few_thoughts_on_the_kashmir_issue/</li>

We dont need to make animals suffer any more than they have to. Animals are banned in zoos as they should. We dont allow hunting of a lot of animals as we should. And any modern society should not allow Halaal if they have a modicum of compassion.\n\nIt might seem that Hindu religion has nothing to say on Halaal. But it is not required that Hindu religion limit itself to text written thousands of years ago. We arent brainwashed and we choose to revise our religion. Today we should redefine our religion to stand for animals rights and fight against halaal at every platform. Halaal has to go. Animals do not need to suffer any more than they have to. Hindus have to defend them as there isnt anyone else.\n\nCompassion has always been a part of Hindu dharma. We have extended it to cows and lots of other animals. Banning Halaal is just an extension of that compassion. I as a Hindu consider it as my dharma. I as a citizen consider it as a moral imperative of a compassionate state.\n\nYou might find my proposal preposterous. But the only reason you see it this way is because you have been blinded by the congress propaganda. For some reason no one finds anything wrong with Halaal. It is accepted in the name of secularism. There is zero debate around the cruelty of Halaal and some Hindus l openly support the practice. It is time for Halaal to end. Its advocacy in a book written thousands of years ago by a man who considered black dogs as devil is not enough at best and ridiculous at worst.\n\nWe need to stop using Zomato and then stop going to restaurants which serve Halaal. There is no debate around halaal in this country. It is time to make it one.'<br />Author: 'zorgar4'  id: 'ckrvtt'<br />Score:25<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ckrvtt/halaal_has_to_go/</li>

The catch is that if the divorce was done via TT, the husband would have to pay a much higher alimony and be subject to disproportionate distribution of assets. He would also be automatically disqualified from custody of his children. This would encourage the men to actually go to the courts and follow the usual procedures to a divorce. This would in turn reduce frivolous cases of divorce, leading to gradual extinction of TT.\n\nMaking the practice illegal and punishable by imprisonment up to 3 years does not help the wife, who is burdened with an unhappy marriage and a husband in jail.

      <li>Title::: "RRC's History Corner - The fall of the Mauryan Empire and the rise of the Satavahana Dynasty who went on to rule for over 4 centuries a century more than the Mughals"<br />Body: "With the fall of the Mauryans who had held sway across most of the subcontinent, 2 things happened,\n\nPrevious Vassal states broke free ‚Äì Vassal states are those who owe  nominal allegiance to an overlord or emperor, pay them tribute, provide  them soldiers in return for peace, and the permissions to trade freely  within an empire. When the Mauryan‚Äôs collapsed, many such vassals broke  free and with no threat of a large imperial army marching upon them,  declared independence.\n\nThe now free vassal states started fighting amongst themselves in a quest to achieve dominance.\n\nOne such dynasty that broke free from the Mauryans was the Satavahana  Dynasty. The Satavahanas find mention in the Puranas, sacred Hindu  texts, but their rise to prominence was led by Simuka, who declared his  independence from Mauryan rule in about 230 BC. He then embarked on  conquests of Malwa and Maharashtra, and annexed parts of western and  central India. We know\xa0Simuka as the first king of the Satavahana  Kingdom as he is mentioned as the first king in a list of royals in a  Satavahana inscription at\xa0Naneghat.\n\nThe rulers from Satavahana dynasty are also known as the Andhras on  the basis of their reference in Puranas. It was a dynasty, which ruled  in Southern and central India starting from around 230 BCE. Satavahanas  were the first ancient dynastry of Maharasthra. The rulers from this  dynastry had occupied a major part of southern India which included  modern Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and part of Gujrath and Karnataka  statses.\n\nThe period when Simhuka established his kingdom though are themselves  in dispute. One suggests that he rebelled against the Mauryans around  230 BCE, but other sources,The\xa0Matsya\xa0and\xa0Vayu\xa0Puranas mention that the  first Andhra king overthrew the\xa0Kanva\xa0king Susharman (c. 40‚Äì30 BCE).  Based on identification of Simuka with this king, some scholars believe  that Simuka's reign started in 30 BCE.\xa0We also have the Greek  Megasthenes in his Indica talk about the Andrae (sounds close enough to  Andhras I guess) and their mighty kingdom with an army of no less than  100,000 infantry and countless horse and elephant cavalry. But if we  consider Megasthenes, we then go back\xa0 in time to around 300 BCE which  makes the Satavahana contemporaries of the Mauryan Empire. Aside from  his conquests, we only know that Simhuka possibly converted to Jainism,  turned into a power hungry ruler and was killed for his troubles.\n\nSimuka's brother, Krishna / Kanha , reigned next. He added Nasik to  the kingdom. We know about Krishna through inscriptions carved mostly  during his reign in the Nashik Caves. What is interesting and talks  about the fluidity of religions and religious beliefs in the India of  this period is, Krishna was possibly Buddhist. So you had a Hindu  Simukha who became Jain, succeeded by a Buddhist king. Kanha was  succeeded by Satkarni Satavahana.\n\nWhile the periods as always are sketchy, we can establish that he  reigned for 10-12 years and greatly strengthened and expanded the Empire  ‚Äì under his relentless expansion, the kingdom rose to be a much larger  empire. He annexed Berar, Malwa, and many southern states. He performed  the traditional Ashwamedha and Rajasuya sacrifices that only the most  powerful of rulers performed.\n\nTo briefly digress, the Ashwamedha yagna was performed to impose upon  neighbouring kingdoms the sheer strength and magnificence of the  Emperor. In this, a brilliantly caparisoned horse, accompanied by a  small force would wander for a period of a year. Wherever it went was  considered the Emperor‚Äôs territory and any enemy could challenge this by  seizing the horse. If it by chance wandered into hostile territory, it  was war and the enemy subjugated. At the end of the year, the horse  would be taken back to the capital and sacrificed.\n\nWe also know from the Hathigumpha inscriptions (inscriptions in a  cave near Bhubaneshwar Orissa), that the famous King Kharavela (King of  Kalinga / Odisha) possibly invaded the Satavanahanas,\n\nAnd in the second year (he), disregarding Satakamini, dispatches to  the western regions an army strong in cavalry, elephants, infantry  (nara) and chariots (ratha) and by that army having reached the  Kanha-bemna, he throws the city of the\xa0Musikas\xa0into consternation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Religious Loop**\n\nTo complete the religious loop, Satkarni reverted back to Hinduism,  abandoning the Buddhism of his father and Jainism of his grand father.  Satkarni was followed by the last great ruler of the Satavanahas,  Satkarni 2, we know he ruled for close to 50 years, and while expansions  were limited, he strengthened the administration, and ably defended his  empire.\n\nAfter this though a period of instability began with the invasion of  the Steppe tribes called the Sakas. Under pressure themselves from a  bigger and more powerful nomadic tribe called the Kushana, they migrated  into India, conquered large parts of West India and started invading in  all directions.\n\nThis was the time when the Satavahanas were ruled by weak rulers like  Hala who was a great patron of the arts, erudite and himself composed  books such as the Gaha Sattasi\xa0 - a collection of poems talking about  love and longing. Interestingly though, this compilation tells us that  topics which are taboo in modern India to this day such as dating were  possibly accepted and not taboo topics.\n\nWhile Hala might have been a poet, he was clearly not upto the task  of fighting wars with these warriors from the steppe and the Empire  lost\xa0Malwa and even northern Maharashtra to the Shakas. Around this time  (100 AD) you also had the Indo Persians and Indo-Greeks all invading  into India, it was a period of great instability and war.\n\nAfter a period of decay came the greatest of the Satavhana,  Gautamiputra Satkarni son of Gautami Balshri (thus Gautamiputra‚Ä¶duh!).  He took on all the three challengers, the Sakas, Indo Persians and Indo  Greeks, defeated them and took back the lost territory. It was around  him that the Satavahana reached their full territorial reach.\n\nThe territory would roughly include,\n\nAll of Maharashtra,\xa0 northern united Andhra right upto the coast,  parts of Madhya Pradesh and a portion of Gujarat, mostly around the  Saurashtra region. Its capital was in Pratishtan\n\nWe get a good amount of details in another set of Nashik cave  inscriptions, his title and description alone I will quote here because  they make for a stirring read,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwho was in strength equal to mount Himavat, mount\xa0Meru,  mount Mandara; king of Asika, Asaka, Mulaka, Suratha, Kukura,\xa0Aparanta,  Anupa, Vidabha, Akaravanti; lord of the mountains Vindhya, Chhavata,  Parichata, Sahya, Kanhagiri, Macha, Siritana, Malaya, Mahendra,  Setagiri, Chakora; obeyed by the circle of all kings on earth;\n\nwhose face was beautiful and pure like the lotas opened by the rays  of the sun; whose chargers had drunk the water of three oceans; whose  face was lovely and radiant like the orb of the full moon; whose gait  was beautiful like the gait of a choice elephant; whose arms were as  muscular and rounded, broad and long as the folds of the lord of  serpents; whose fearless hand was wet by the water poured out to impart  fearlessness; of unchecked obedience towards his mother; who properly  devised time and place for the pursuit of the triple object (of human  activity); who sympathised fully with the weal and woe of the citizens;\n\nwho crushed down the pride and conceit of the\xa0Kshatriyas; who  destroyed the\xa0Sakas,\xa0Yavanas\xa0and\xa0Palhavas; who never levied nor employed  taxes but in conformity to justice; alien to hurting life even towards  an offending enemy; the furtherer of the homesteads of the low as well  as of the twice-born; who rooted out the\xa0Khakharata\xa0race; who restored  the glory of the Satavahana family; whose feet were saluted by all  provinces; who stopped the contamination of the four varnas; who  conquered multitudes of enemies in many battles; whose victorious banner  was unvanquished; whose capital was unassailable to his foes;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Satavahana role in development of Madhya and Dakshina Bharatam**\n\nThe Satavahana played a crucial role in the independent development  of both Madhya and Dakshina Bharatam. This period also coincided with  the period when the 3 key dynasties of the peninsula were all subjugated  and powerless themselves. Without the Satavahana standing as a bulwark  against invasion by the Indo Persians and Indo Greeks, history might  have turned out very differently.Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund  have observed that the central Indian empireof the Satavahanas showed  great longevity and connectivity.\n\nThe Sakas though rose up again, under Rudraraman, and took back  territories lost to Gautamiputra. The Satavahana‚Äôs had one last throw of  the die under Yajna Sri Satkarni. A warlike Emperor, he went to war  with the Shakas‚Ä¶again, and again regained lost territories, however the  endless series of wars weakened the Empire so much that like they did  with the Mauryans, their own feudatories started to rise up, rebelled  and broke away, weakening the state and it within a short span of time  collapsed and died.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Source:**\n\nThis is solely the work of RRC u/RajaRajaC I have just posted it on his behalf, long ago he decided on doing podcast series, he did the first and wanted to do a follow up and this is the 2nd episode of it!!

      <li>Title::: 'Blatant disregard for community rules and apparent hypocricy in enforcing them on subreddit r/India'<br />Body: "Gonna be a rant!\n\nAfew weeks ago I posted a picture of the two female lawyers on r/India, who fought for the removal of sec 377, coming out as a couple. It got a round 900 upvotes and in the comment there were several heart-breaking stories of people who are still fighting with the guilt of being gay and how to come out to their families and friends, it also had many people supporting the cause and some genuine questions regarding the case. A very lively debate and discussion was there.\n\nCut to the mod deleting the post and eventually blocking me. Why? Because my post was a 'meme' with no 'context'. Even though i provided the link to the news article as well and also tried to convey my view that its a fairly popular topic and not much context was needed as the caption and the pic were self explanatory.\n\nNow why I am so triggered? Because for past week I have been seing senseless cow related memes, Modi related memes on the subreddit with their comment sections becoming hotbed of bull crap with almost no action from mods! Now they don't worry about how the posts which are actual memes!! are against the subreddit's rules!\n\nSuch hypocricy!\n\nHas this ever happened to any of you as well?\n\nTLDR; got blocked from r/India because the mod is a hypocrite and may be, I am going on a limb here, averse to thoughtful posts."<br />Author: 'cynic1996'  id: 'ckdho6'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ckdho6/blatant_disregard_for_community_rules_and/</li>

Some see this as mere wishful thinking‚Äîan unachievable target. There is another set who argues that the prime minister is asking for less. India should target a much higher growth, a much bigger size to accommodate millions of young skilled youth in the job market and lift the economy to the next level as the world‚Äôs next big manufacturing hub, they say. Who are the realists here?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Dreaming big is essential; for only a target-based approach backed by a solid roadmap has delivered in economies that have achieved great scale. But, before targeting the $5 trillion mark, India will have to get its act together in a range of areas, unclog the sizeable number of stalled projects, remove policy shortcomings and blunders that were strictly avoidable. Finally, the government must understand the problem areas that are pulling it down in the race among peer economies.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The first problem is the depressingly slow pace of infrastructure development in the last decade. India is still at the position where China was 20 years ago in terms of infrastructure development**. The 2019 Union Budget by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has laid out an ambitious roadmap. It talks about plans with a pan-India focus to give a further boost to Sagarmala, Bharatmala and UDAN projects, besides the dedicated industrial and freight corridors. The plans are ambitious, but the problem is resources.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Here is the puzzle: The government estimates Rs 100 lakh crore infrastructure investments over the next five years or an average Rs 20 lakh crore a year. This is a far cry from what is spent on infrastructure currently which is barely one-third of what is estimated. The question is, where will this money come from. India does not have powerful institutions that can fund long-gestation infrastructure projects**. Banks do not have enough long-term liabilities to match such loans. Lenders have gone terribly wrong in the past by not following healthy lending practices.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**About 70 percent of the banking system (read state-run banks) are at the mercy of the government for capital for its survival. India does not have a deep bond market to take up the financing burden**. The state-insurer Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has been overexploited to do businesses it has never understood. There aren't many other options left to take up the infra-funding burden. The government's plan to borrow off-budget is risky and unadvisable. The question that comes up again is, who will fund the multi-billion infra dream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The second major drag is the government's excessive involvement in businesses. **The government remains a majority, active participant in several entities including banks, airline, infrastructure firms. It controls 70 percent of the banking industry. This participation has resulted in a lot of money getting stuck in these entities**. The government will have to exit these businesses backed by a solid, aggressive disinvestment plan to unlock this money.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The third is the depressing pace in carrying out land and labour reforms. This has been a major turn-off for investors looking at setting shop in the country**. Sitharaman's Budget talks about narrowing labour laws. This is a step in the right direction but quick execution is important. Since land is a state subject, respective state governments need to work with the Centre to bring about the change. In the past, investors got a shocker from episodes such as Singur. These kinds of incidents cannot be allowed to be repeated if India\xa0wants\xa0to progress economically.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fourth, the government will have to also need to work out an exigency plan to get private investors back. **This is even more critical now since domestic consumption is dropping to dangerous levels.** ***Mint*** **quoted a**[ **CMIE report**](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/new-investment-plunges-to-a-15-year-low-1561976363936.html) **that said investment in new projects plunged to a 15-year low in the quarter ending June 2019. Both private and public sectors announced new projects worth Rs 43,400 crore in June 2019 quarter, 81 percent lower than what was announced in the March quarter and 87 percent lower than during the same period a year ago. According to the finance ministry‚Äôs data, projects worth almost Rs 11 lakh crore remain ‚Äòstalled‚Äô or are having issues**. Railways, roads, and power sectors account for more than half of these stalled projects.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fifth, as this writer argued in an earlier article,\xa0**so far the economy has been largely riding on** [**public money**](https://www.firstpost.com/business/union-budget-2019-private-investors-are-doing-the-vanishing-act-will-nirmala-sitharaman-pull-a-trick-to-lure-them-back-6917471.html)**. Government spending has largely aided GDP growth. Sure, this was needed at a time when private investors were absent. However, an economy which rides largely on government money for a prolonged period of time does not promise much to the economy in the long run**. What is needed is the participation of private investors.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The government‚Äôs $5 trillion target is ambitious and a strong statement of intent. But this intent must be followed up with action supported by a clear action plan to succeed. Else, it will remain mere wishful thinking. The year 2024 isn‚Äôt that far."<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'ck6547'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ck6547/narendra_modis_5_trillion_economy_dream_is/</li>
