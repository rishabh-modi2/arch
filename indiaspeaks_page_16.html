      <li>Title::: 'The campaign against the Nizam, led by Sadashivrao Bhau'<br />Body: 'Yesterday was 4th August, the 291st birth anniversary of the legendary Maratha commander, Sadashivrao Bhau. He was the son of Chimaji Appa and was a cousin of Nanasaheb Peshwa. His most well known feats are the battle against Abdali, and his march to the north.\n\nHowever, this thread is about his battles against the Nizam, one of his lesser known achievements.\n\nThe war was sparked off by the capture of Ahmednagar by Nanasaheb Peshwa, where he bribed the fort keeper, Kavi Jang[1] Cities such as Daulatabad, Bijapur and Burhanpur was also seized[2]\n\nBefore this it\'s important to note the recruitment of Ibrahmin Khan Gardi into the Maratha army. Ibrahmin Khan was trained under Bussy, the French artillery officer of the Nizam\'s kingdom. However, he was removed from his post due to the political intrigues in the Nizamshahi.[3]\n\nHe was then immediately recruited into the Maratha army by Sadashivrao Bhau, who entrusted this job on Keshav Panse, the officer of Maratha artillery.[4] Ibrahim\'s expertise would prove to be a severe advantage in the battle.\n\nThe Marathas had 40,000 soldier, while the Nizam had 12,000 soldiers , 10,000 Gardi troops and around a hundred guns. The fighting commenced from around 11th January, and lasted till 3rd February [5]\n\nThe first few days were small skirmishes. However the artillery played a huge role later on. Raghunath rao wrote to Bhausaheb on 19th January- "The attack of our artillery was very effective, the enemy has taken to fright" [6]\n\nThe havoc wreaked by the artillery was again referred to by Raghunath Rao in a letter dated 3rd February, where he states that the fort at Dharur was considered a refuge for the Nizam\'s army but even there a food crisis was going on.[7]\n\nA rough translation of an account of the last battle on 3rd February is as follows- "Bhausaheb on the right side and Dadasaheb on the left side were fighting like this everyday. When Dharur approached the three classes also made a plan that the Mughals(Nizam) would fight and reach Dharur. Then we would not be able to reach them. If help is not forthcoming, then attack and fight. After such a consultation, I called all the chiefs and told them to fight hard in the next morning. In the morning, as usual, the Mughals would start with horses and artillery. Our soldiers stood up to attack them with courage. Bhausaheb and Raosaheb(Vishwasrao) from the right and Dadasaheb from the left. They fought bravely and there was a great battle for a while. The Mughals lost many soldiers and they didn\'t have any more courage.Many fell in the battle and others were injured. The Mughals finally surrendered"[8] \n\nThe Nizam was camped at Ausa and sent messangers negotiating for peace. The terms were 1) To pay 60 lakhs as compensation 2) To surrender the powerful forts of Ashirgad and Daulatabad\n3) The imperial cities such as Burhanpur and Bijapur were to be submitted [9] \n\nThis was possibly one of the most humiliating defeats of the Nizam at the hands of Marathas. This also showed the expertise of Sadashivrao Bhau and Vishwasrao in battle, aswell as efficacy of artillery\n\n\nSources- \n\n1- New History of Marathas vol 2, pg 336 \n\n2- Ibid, pg 336 \n\n3- Solstice at Panipat, pg 116\n\n 4- Selections from Peshwa Daftar vol 1, number 4 \n\n5- Marathi Riyasat vol 6, pg 130\n\n6- Selections from the Peshwa daftar vol 1, number 36\n\n7- Selections from Peshwa Daftar, vol 1, number 79\n\n8- Marathi Riyasat vol 6, pg 131 \n\n9- Ibid, pg 132 and Selections from Peshwa Daftar vol 1, number 83'<br />Author: 'Vermakimkc'  id: 'oynq4c'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/oynq4c/the_campaign_against_the_nizam_led_by_sadashivrao/</li>

A U.S.-based persecution watchdog group now fears that attacks on Christians might intensify.\n\nThe Superintendent of Police of the Sukma District in Chhattisgarh state has issued a circular to all police stations directing officers to surveil the district‚Äôs Christian community and be on the lookout for ‚Äúfraudulent‚Äù religious conversions and to act against Christians where these activities are found, International Christian Concern reports.\n\nSeveral incidents of intimidation, threats and assaults against the Christians of Sukma have been reported since the circular was sent, ICC reports.\n\n‚ÄúFour policemen came to our village while we were having a prayer gathering on July 23,‚Äù Bhima, a Christian from Sukma, was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúThey enquired about conversions. They did not do anything to us, but after the police left the Hindu radicals in the village started using abusive words against all Christians. They threatened that they would chase us away from the village.‚Äù\n\nAnother local pastor was quoted as saying that all churches in the villages had been forced to stop all the worship gatherings.\n\nChristians make up about 2.5% of India‚Äôs population, while Hindus comprise 79.5%.\n\nIndia ranks as the 10th worst country globally when it comes to Christian persecution, according to Open Doors USA\'s 2021 World Watch List. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has urged the U.S. State Department to label India as a ‚Äúcountry of particular concern‚Äù for engaging in or tolerating severe religious freedom violations.\n\nThe Evangelical Fellowship of India says in a report that it documented 145 cases of atrocities against Christians ‚Äî three murders, 22 attacks on churches and 20 cases of ostracization or social boycott in rural areas ‚Äî in the first half of 2021.\n\n‚ÄúThe violence, detailed in the report, itself was vicious, widespread and ranged from murder to attacks on churches, false cases, police immunity and connivance, and the now normalized social exclusion or boycott which is becoming viral,‚Äù the report says.\n\n‚ÄúSince the current ruling party (Bharatiya Janata Party) took power in 2014, incidents against Christians have increased, and Hindu radicals often attack Christians with little to no consequences,‚Äù noted Open Doors‚Äô World Watch List last year.\n\n‚ÄúThe view of the Hindu nationalists is that to be Indian is to be Hindu, so any other faith ‚Äî including Christianity ‚Äî is viewed as non-Indian. Also, converts to Christianity from Hindu backgrounds or tribal religions are often extremely persecuted by their family members and communities,‚Äù Open Doors said at the time.\n\nSeveral Indian states have ‚Äúanti-conversion‚Äù laws, which presume that Christian workers ‚Äúforce‚Äù or give financial benefits to Hindus to convert them to Christianity.\n\nhttps://www.christianpost.com/news/india-police-surveillance-sparks-fear-among-christians-community.html\n\nReminder that Catholic Pastor Jegath Casper had openly declared thatAmnesty,Konrad Adeneur Fdn,Heinrich Boll,Rosa Luxembourg will fix Modi by WaPo,LeMonde,Guardian &amp; that global lib democrats will decide Indian leadership.\n\nMeanwhile this is how conversion is continuing in Punjab, practicing atrocities on women &amp; children alike. \n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Theintrepid_/status/1423271920783351816\n\nBut why would any child or female activist or even judge notice, when they are openly looking upto Christian supremacy orgs for deciding policies &amp; laws.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/owd6ut/maha_hc_ncw_nidmmha_all_partnering_with_christian/'<br />Author: 'StarsAtLadakh'  id: 'oyjl6p'<br />Score:72<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/oyjl6p/example_of_how_western_neocolonialist_regimes/</li>

This is not the way to treat the national players.\n\n&gt; Your team beat arch rivals Pakistan in the finals of the Asian Champions Trophy tournament last week, and you were offered a paltry Rs 25,000 each as a reward by Hockey India. How did that make you feel? It is not a matter of money. By giving Rs 25,000, they ridiculed our achievement. A team of youngsters which overcomes all sorts of hurdles and goes on to win a prestigious tournament like this cannot be treated in such a way. Money apart, the attitude shown by officials has been one of contempt. It breaks the confidence of the team which looks upon Hockey India (HI) as a father figure. If our management treats us like this, how can you expect others to show respect to us?

      <li>Title::: 'Is India a free country? Does Indian democracy work?'<br />Body: 'We will look at this at many levels, but along the way we must also try to define what is meant by freedom, and what is meant by democracy.\n\n# Freedom from the British:\n\nFreedom has to be earned. Freedom so earned has to then be protected.\n\nIndia didn\'t win her freedom in the traditional sense. It is true that there were many brave freedom fighters such as Gandhiji and Netaji, but the honest truth is that the British ran out of gas after WW2 and India was just not as productive an asset. What Britain did was a strategic disinvestment or exit. The percentage of freedom fighters to the total population was tiny, and nothing like the French resistance during the German occupation where the average Frenchman was resentful.\n\nThus there is no memory in the mind of the "average" Indian of a hard fought battle for independence unlike in the consciousness of the Israeli.\n\nThe why of it is long and detailed, but there is no such thing as the average Indian on most issues. Every Indian is first and foremost identified with a local culture, caste, tribe, religion or something before his identity to the nation. Thus every Indian is also a victim at some point in time - going back centuries almost every caste or tribe or person in India can claim to have been a victim of the state.\n\n# Political Freedom:\n\nThe state has never been strong in India, so whenever a serious opposition from any front builds up, the Indian state shares some power with it (J&amp;K, NE states, Maoists, Communists, SC/ST parties of middle India). On the plus side there has never been a breakaway republic from India despite over 200 secessionist movements. On the negative side each accommodation leads to further stress on the system and more compromises.\n\nEven [defeated](http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Members/memberbioprofile.aspx?mpsno=328&amp;lastls=13) [revolutionaries](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/veerappans-widow-to-contest-polls-in-tn/articleshow/1487688.cms) find a place in the political system.\n\nWhat is unique is that these secessionists who have a place in the political system always begin with an intent to undermine the political system from within it, but eventually become a part of it. The number of MPs and MLAs who claim to have been jailed on fake charges by the state and are therefore "revolutionaries" is innumerable. India never allows revolutionaries to grow larger than the state but makes them part of the state.\n\nAlmost everyone in BJP who is in power now was once upon a time jailed by the Congress government. Today much of the accusations levelled against the BJP were once used against the Congress. Almost everyone who is in jail now as a political prisoner will one day rule India. This is the hidden narrative of India.\n\nNever trust the Indian state to lift a finger against any invader - the immune system is non-existent, and whenever it wakes up it does as much damage as it does good.\n\n*TL;DR:*\n\n&gt;The Indian state is a perfect host - it accommodates every parasite, and trusts the parasites to not kill the host. The parasites have so far obliged.\n\nThe only way to succeed in Politics is to create division. Name one politician who said we are all one, we must forget our differences and actually won the votes. \n\nIn effect democracy and one person one vote made everyone equal, which is not always a good thing. If my stupidity is as good as your intelligence, and my ignorance is as good as your knowledge, and my lies are as good as your facts, then it leads to a society where the divisive forces will always win.\n\nNo Army can be a democracy, no successful corporation can be a democracy, and for that matter, even political parties who contest in a democracy are not democracies within themselves - yet we want a democratic state.\n\nAs far as the Indian state is concerned it doesn\'t care if it has to exist as India under Christian law, or Sharia law or atheistic communism or something else. You can term this as essentially a Hindu characteristic - there are many ways to the same power, just as there are many names for the same truth.\n\nMizoram and Nagaland can be effectively Christian states, J&amp;K can be a Muslim state, and so on with many states in India which have some secessionist identity that never seems to succeed but gets mainstreamed.\n\n*ekam sat vipra bahudha vadanti*\n\n# Ethnic freedom:\n\nTribals simply don\'t exist in any other country in the world wherever a settled civilization has existed for centuries or millennia. Can you find any tribes in Europe? All the Celtic tribes were Christianized or killed in Britain. The same with the Germanic or Norman tribes during the Roman empire. In more recent memory you see the plight of the Native Americans in the US and Aborigines in ANZ - a fraction of their past might, extinct or nearly extinct in their own land. There\'s no question of a native American or Australian aborigine becoming President of the US or PM of Australia, whereas in India no office is out of bounds. India must be the only country in the world where tribal populations are increasing year on year.\n\nIn the 70+ years of Pakistan the Hindu, Sindhi, Ahmadiya, Sikh communities have mostly vanished. Can this be said of India? Absolutely not. Religions flourish here, new religions are welcomed and new identities are always accommodated. \n\nWe still have dedicated parliamentary and assembly seats for Anglo-Indians and I assume we will have those seats until we run out of their population, which seems to be one of the few populations that is on the decline due to emigration.\n\nIndia has never had a strong central identity which can be politicized, but it has a shared dharma that you see in this societal compact.\n\n# Freedom of the press:\n\nThis is a real problem world wide. It is very difficult to govern a state if everything gets printed or reported - a lot of things get done in the process of politics that are not very pleasant to look at.  There is an old saying attributed to Prince Bismarck that "to retain respect for sausages and laws, one must not watch them in the making."\n\nIn the 1970s/80s it was common to hear of printing presses getting shut off to prevent problematic stories from being printed or censors stopping films that spoke too freely. Nowadays this is rarer, but this doesn\'t mean curbs on reporting don\'t exist. The cost of running a TV channel or Media house is so expensive that they co-operate eagerly with the state to act as a state media arm, and this is true across the world. You do see social media posts or videos inviting jail time now and then though, because this is where the real "freedom" is? \n\nIs freedom then the freedom to launch an attack on the system?\n\nWe can examine many more dimensions of freedom - there\'s linguistic freedom, religious freedom, financial freedom and the like, but I don\'t think we will actually discover what freedom is in any of these explorations. \n\nFundamentally no nation is ever free, just as no individual is ever free. We are all subject to the laws of nature, the laws of demand and supply, the laws of space and time. Even our so-called free will isn\'t free and is determined to a huge degree by DNA, and the millions of other events that occur in nature.\n\nThe true freedom as the wisdom traditions of India say is always found within. \n\n\\*Bramha satya jagath mithya\\*: look for the freedom inside yourself, this world is always going to be a prison.'<br />Author: 'greasesoda'  id: 'oxv9zs'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/oxv9zs/is_india_a_free_country_does_indian_democracy_work/</li>

Harishankar, an acclaimed archaeologist and Member of the Academic Committee, Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla has mentioned that attempts are being made to tamper with the archaeological findings at Keezhadi. He says that dubious organizations and individuals along with ideologically motivated academicians and certain politicians are trying to fix Keezhadi into their ideological framework by suppressing and/or tampering with the evidence.\n\nHe has raised concerns over the involvement of Father Jegath Gasper Raj and his NGO Tamil Maiyam. Jegath Casper is a Catholic priest and is also close to DMK MP Kanimozhi.\n\nGaspar Raj is officially referred in US crime records as ‚ÄòGaspar Raj Maria Paulian‚Äô according to senior national security strategist, Douglas C. Lovelace Jr. and Domestic Security and Intelligence analyst, Siobhan O‚Äô Neil. He is charged for ‚Äúinvolving in multiple criminal activities in support of LTTE, a Sri Lankan group designated by the US state department as a Foreign Terrorist Organization‚Äù.\n\nIt is Gasper Raj through his NGO and with the aid of DMK that has been meddling with the excavation at Keezhadi. Jegath Gasper Raj and DMK MP Kanimozhi were the first people to reach the Keezhadi once excavators announced that they had come across remarkable findings. It was DMK MP Kanimozhi who approached the Madras High Court and brought a stay order that prevented ASI from taking Keezhadi samples to labs under its jurisdiction. The stay was later vacated when ASI provided relevant proofs.\n\nDr. Harishankar, a dual post-doctorate holder who had earlier served as the Assistant Director of Indraprastha Museum in New Delhi says that all norms associated with excavation of a spot have been violated by ‚Äòself-styled archaeologists‚Äô digging at Keezhadi.\n\nHe said that those excavating did not even allow a former Director of ASI T. Satyamurthy to examine the findings.\n\n‚ÄúWhat is the need for such a secret operation while the entire excavations carried out in other places of the country were open books?‚Äù he asks in his paper titled Global Interventions in Keezhadi Excavations.\n\nDr. Harishankar says that there are people behind the project who are hell bent on coming up with the theory that there existed a separate ‚ÄúDravidian civilization‚Äù, meant to serve as a fodder for separatism.\n\nHe also questioned the need for sending the samples that were dug out from the excavation site to Beta Analytics in USA when there are enough facilities available within India itself for carbon dating.\n\n‚ÄúThey want a separate DNA result to establish a Dravidian race to raise separatist agitation,‚Äù Prof Harishanker, said.\n\nFormer ASI Director Dr. T. Satyamurthy said that Dr. Harishankar has flagged serious issues and goes on to say that whatever happened in Keezhadi under the pretext of archaeological excavation was dubious that needs a thorough probe.\n\nDr. Satyamurthy was quoted saying in The Pioneer that nobody should be allowed to manufacture or assemble history.\n\nAn intelligence official tracking flow of foreign funds said that the NGO headed by Gasper Raj that was receiving huge amounts of foreign funds has was trying to launch a secessionist movement with the help of DMK using Keezhadi. It is said that a number of Christian theologists have entered the Keezhadi seen and have vitiated the atmosphere. Earlier, the tried to do it with Pattanam excavation site under the Muziris Heritage Project that was patronised by a section of modern historians to subvert the history of south India.\n\nProf. C. Issac, a member of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) was quoted saying in The Pioneer that the entire landscape will get manipulated once these historians and dubious organizations succeed in establishing Pattanam and Keezhadi were connected through common bondage and linked to Rome."<br />Author: 'StarsAtLadakh'  id: 'oxu34v'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/oxu34v/vatical_trained_jegath_casper_who_stated/</li>

When he published his work\xa0Physical Factors Of The Historical Process,\xa0he proved that the cause for Russian revolution of 1905 and 1917 is Solar flares, not the economic disparity as proposed by revolutionists. This angered Stalin who imprisoned Chizhevsky for 8 years.\n\nIt is a well-established fact that earth and other planets were formed out of sun. And, living organisms sustain because of earth.

I\'m a guy who\'s lived here all my life and I would like to paint a picture of what reality is like here. Many of the points below apply to almost all countries but they\'re just on a different level when it comes to India.\n\n\n**Job Quotas.**\n\nAround 33% of all government &amp; public sector jobs are reserved for women. Some private companies like Google also have female quotas and often discriminate against men for internships, jobs, etc even though they won\'t outright admit it.\n\n\nExample:\n\n[Reservation in India.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_in_India)\n\n\n**Government Schemes.**\n\nPoliticians often boast about all the female-only schemes they implement to help female entrepreneurs, homeless women, etc but I have never in my entire life seen something like that done for men. Some famous politicians are even recently talking about a scheme to pay ALL housewives money every month for.... taking care of their own home. Hurray for gender equality.\n\n\nExample:\n\n[Free travel for women regardless of their financial status.](https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-free-travel-for-women-in-state-govt-buses-in-this-state-2884099)\n\n\n**False Dowry Cases.**\n\nA married woman can complain to the police that she\'s being harassed for dowry by her husband including anyone else in the husband\'s family with zero evidence and until recently, the protocol was to immediately arrest all of them first and then investigate later. Because of this there have been cases where even babies and 80+ year old people have been arrested. I personally knew a neighbour, an old man, whose family was accused like this by his daughter-in-law and they were arrested and taken by the police with the whole neighbourhood watching. He was so humiliated by this that he later committed suicide. This law is being heavily abused by women and some have even turned this into a career where they marry someone, file a case within a few weeks, agree to settle for a huge lumpsum of money and then repeat the process. They do this because they almost never get punished.\n\n\nExample:\n\n[Two month old baby arrested for harassing woman.](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/two-month-old-baby-gets-bail-396564)\n\n\n**False Rape Cases.**\n\nThis is similar to the above point but slightly different because the women doesn\'t even need to be married. Any woman can accuse any man with zero evidence and ruin his life and get away with no consequences even when it is proven that she lied. Many women are abusing this law to settle personal scores, extort money, intimidate others and even for social media attention. For example, a woman threatened to file a rape case on a bank official who went to collect debt. He had to touch her feet and beg for forgiveness and write an apology letter which she later posted on her social media and bragged about. Btw, the video you see in the example below was recorded and uploaded by the woman\'s family themselves. That\'s how confident they were that she would face no consequences and they were right. She received no punishment despite the incident becoming viral on social media and getting a lot of attention.\n\n\nExample:\n\n[Woman threatens to file rape case on bank employee who went to collect debt.](https://www.chennaimemes.in/woman-threatening-bank-officials-who-went-to-collect-loan-created-huge-outrage/)\n\n\n**Sex on the pretext of marriage.**\n\nThere is a law here which states that if a man has sex with a woman by promising to marry her and then later decides not to, then that\'s rape. Again, there is no need for proof that he actually said he\'d marry her. Just her word is enough and many bitter women abuse this law to ruin their exes\' lives when things don\'t work out and they break up. Btw, a lot of the rape cases reported to the cops here fall under this category and I have no problem in saying that they\'re not real rapes. She\'s a grown adult who decided to have consensual sex and she can\'t call it rape just because she regrets it later. The law itself is ridiculous because even if he promises marriage, what if her behaviour changes later or he finds out that she was cheating on him and he no longer wants to marry her? Doesn\'t matter to the police because he\'s now a rapist! By that logic, if a woman makes a man spend a lot of money on her by promising to have sex with him and then decides to bail, is that financial fraud?\n\n\nExample:\n\n[Woman gets Tinder date arrested for refusing to marry her.](https://www.businessinsider.in/tinder-date-gone-wrong-an-indian-woman-gets-a-man-arrested/articleshow/69885133.cms)\n\n\n**Police are afraid of women.**\n\nIt\'s not uncommon here for women to verbally and physically abuse men on the street if they get into an argument for whatever reason, even for something as silly as a parking space dispute because they know that nobody will dare stop them, not even the police because they\'re afraid of catching a false harassment case if they try to interfere. And in most of these cases, the police will usually automatically arrest the guy despite him not doing anything and the girl being the attacker. But you will never see a guy even slap a girl in public without immediately being thrashed by a mob of white knights. Some women will even abuse the police with no fear when they\'re caught breaking the rules because they know the police won\'t dare lay a finger on them. If a guy ever tries that he will immediately be eating asphalt. The videos in the examples for this one are really worth watching.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n[Woman beats car driver on road while a crowd and police watch. Woman was jaywalking and was mad that the guy didn\'t stop his car. Guy arrested ofcourse.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ox116d/the_girl_alleged_that_the_cab_driver_hit_her_with/)\n\n[CCTV footage shows woman kicking apartment staff for not going out and buying her cigarettes.

Still no punishment for the woman as far as I know.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuGkb4FTAyQ&amp;ab_channel=KhooniBhai)\n\n\n**But what about all the rapes!**\n\nAfter seeing all of this, please explain to me again how India is a patriarchy and how women are so oppressed. Whenever you bring up any of these issues, especially on reddit, you are always met with "but...but...women in india get RAPED!!!" as if that means all of the above points are invalid or women somehow have it worse and India is a misogynistic country. Rapes do happen just like in every other country and it\'s sad but here\'s the truth, the rate of rape in India is extremely low compared to other countries. Even when you account for unreported cases and multiply the number of reported cases by 10, India is still nowhere close to the top in terms of rape. Keep in mind that many of the reported cases here are either fake or reported under "sex under the pretext of marriage" which they call rape. But whenever a rape does happen, it gets MASSIVE media coverage and further reinforces the false narrative that India is just crawling with rapists everywhere and thanks to our media, Indian men are stereotyped as being rapists which makes me a little ashamed to even travel to other countries or even mention online that I\'m from India. Also, because of the huge population size of India, even though the percentage of rapes is microscopic, the total number of rapes is high and this coupled with our media\'s fetish for rape cases means you hear about them a lot more often.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n[Delhi commission for women\'s report about false rape cases.](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/north/story/false-rape-cases-in-delhi-delhi-commission-of-women-233222-2014-12-29)\n\n[Rape statistics by country.](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/rape-statistics-by-country)\n\n\n**Support for the rape victims.**\n\nThe police here are extremely corrupt and lazy and don\'t care about doing their job but even they take rape cases very seriously compared to other crimes. They even catch the supposed rapists and shoot them to death like dogs without giving them due process and are praised by everyone as heroes. There is also massive outrage from society and public marches on the street demanding justice when rapes happen and non-stop coverage on the news channels. You will never ever see even a fraction of this when a man is raped or killed or falsely accused by a woman even if it drives him to suicide. Nobody here condones rape and even being accused of rape is enough to be beaten to death by a mob. So please, enough with the bullshit lie that women here are being raped left and right. Btw, according to Indian law women cannot rape. There have been attempts to make rape gender-neutral but unsurprisingly, feminist organisations have been fighting against it.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n[Police shoot and kill four men suspected of gangrape without taking them to court. Public shower flowers on them and praise them as heroes.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-50682262)\n\n[Man accused of rape dragged out by mob, stripped and paraded naked on the street and beaten to death.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Dimapur_mob_lynching)\n\n[Girl travelling on bus TWEETS that she\'s being harassed and asked for her number by two guys.

They accurately reflect the current state of our country. India is a poor country plagued by corruption and incompetent governments and life sucks here for many people irrespective of their gender unless they are rich or powerful. Focusing only on women\'s problems and ignoring their privileges and men\'s problems and acting like women are oppressed is utterly stupid. There are literally thousands of men here committing suicide due to false accusations but unlike rape, they get no media coverage, no public outcry and no justice from the police and the false accusers walk free. You can watch [this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKRAkw5RUdw&amp;ab_channel=DeepikaNarayanBhardwaj) to know more. Here is [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc42V3WzAwA&amp;ab_channel=AmericanEnterpriseInstitute) to see how India is NOT such a hellish place for women like the media and feminists claim.\n\n\nI already know some people are going to argue against this post by pointing out problems faced by women so I\'m going to repeat my point again to really get it across. Men have problems too like I pointed out above and suffer just as much as women do, if not even more. Women are not oppressed here. If having problems means you are oppressed then does that mean men are also oppressed?'<br />Author: 'Shaloog'  id: 'oxm96r'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/oxm96r/absolutely_tired_of_the_myth_that_india_is/</li>

They treat u like inmates. They don't tell u how things work and behave like we should know all the process by default.\n\n* When our number come we have to go to doctor's chamber where Doctor don't even give attention to u as even if u have paid money he don't give u 1-2 minutes to describe your problem. He will not see your previous reports to understand your situation. He will just write prescriptions after listening first sentence from ur mouth.I don't argue because i don't want to get a wrong prescription.\n( **Ok i knew some doctor or good but it's very rare. I've seen 20+ doctors and out of which only 2-3 were attentive**)\n\n*Doctors always have an assistant near by who try hard so we can talk less with doctors. After doctor write the prescription we can't say anything to him and have to deal with arrogant employees rest of the process who almost never explain it properly.( **They are underpaid is not an excuse. Everyone should do their job properly as they have willingly came to work** )\n\n*Also is u have Any problem or pain or medical allergies b/w the visit doctors don't give their personal numbers to consult. U have to repeat all the above process.( **May be doctors r busy but they should treat the patients properly they already have in stead of seeing as many as possible they can** )\n\n* My point is majority of  people r unfit due to their diet and no physically activities end up going these doctors just for pills which will harm them more in long run and they will end up becoming permanent slaves to these organizations.\n\n*My post may seems little harsh and generalized but it is not 1 day experience. Rich people will not find it relatable because they can spent money to get personal doctor which even middle class people can't afford.\n\n* May be some of these seem to be problem created by huge population but still people can talk little nicely and do their job properly to explain something."<br />Author: 'Better__name'  id: 'oxlfq5'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/oxlfq5/private_hospitals_my_experience/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Absolutely tired of the myth that India is somehow a horrible place for women.'<br />Body: 'Whenever I see a post talking about the problems faced by men in India, almost always there is at least one person claiming that women have it much worse and foreigners who\'ve never even lived in India believe this nonsense. I\'m a guy who\'s lived here all my life and I would like to paint a picture of what reality is like here. Many of the points below apply to almost all countries but they\'re just on a different level when it comes to India.\n\n\n**Job Quotas.**\n\nAround 33% of all government &amp; public sector jobs are reserved for women. Some private companies like Google also have female quotas and often discriminate against men for internships, jobs, etc even though they won\'t outright admit it.\n\n\nExample:\n\n[Reservation in India.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_in_India)\n\n\n**Government Schemes.**\n\nPoliticians often boast about all the female-only schemes they implement to help female entrepreneurs, homeless women, etc but I have never in my entire life seen something like that done for men. Some famous politicians are even recently talking about a scheme to pay ALL housewives money every month for.... taking care of their own home. Hurray for gender equality.\n\n\nExample:\n\n[Free travel for women regardless of their financial status.](https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-free-travel-for-women-in-state-govt-buses-in-this-state-2884099)\n\n\n**False Dowry Cases.**\n\nA married woman can complain to the police that she\'s being harassed for dowry by her husband including anyone else in the husband\'s family with zero evidence and until recently, the protocol was to immediately arrest all of them first and then investigate later. Because of this there have been cases where even babies and 80+ year old people have been arrested. I personally knew a neighbour, an old man, whose family was accused like this by his daughter-in-law and they were arrested and taken by the police with the whole neighbourhood watching. He was so humiliated by this that he later committed suicide. This law is being heavily abused by women and some have even turned this into a career where they marry someone, file a case within a few weeks, agree to settle for a huge lumpsum of money and then repeat the process. They do this because they almost never get punished.\n\n\nExample:\n\n[Two month old baby arrested for harassing woman.](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/two-month-old-baby-gets-bail-396564)\n\n\n**False Rape Cases.**\n\nThis is similar to the above point but slightly different because the women doesn\'t even need to be married. Any woman can accuse any man with zero evidence and ruin his life and get away with no consequences even when it is proven that she lied. Many women are abusing this law to settle personal scores, extort money, intimidate others and even for social media attention. For example, a woman threatened to file a rape case on a bank official who went to collect debt. He had to touch her feet and beg for forgiveness and write an apology letter which she later posted on her social media and bragged about. Btw, the video you see in the example below was recorded and uploaded by the woman\'s family themselves. That\'s how confident they were that she would face no consequences and they were right. She received no punishment despite the incident becoming viral on social media and getting a lot of attention.\n\n\nExample:\n\n[Woman threatens to file rape case on bank employee who went to collect debt.](https://www.chennaimemes.in/woman-threatening-bank-officials-who-went-to-collect-loan-created-huge-outrage/)\n\n\n**Sex on the pretext of marriage.**\n\nThere is a law here which states that if a man has sex with a woman by promising to marry her and then later decides not to, then that\'s rape. Again, there is no need for proof that he actually said he\'d marry her. Just her word is enough and many bitter women abuse this law to ruin their exes\' lives when things don\'t work out and they break up. Btw, a lot of the rape cases reported to the cops here fall under this category and I have no problem in saying that they\'re not real rapes. She\'s a grown adult who decided to have consensual sex and she can\'t call it rape just because she regrets it later. The law itself is ridiculous because even if he promises marriage, what if her behaviour changes later or he finds out that she was cheating on him and he no longer wants to marry her? Doesn\'t matter to the police because he\'s now a rapist! By that logic, if a woman makes a man spend a lot of money on her by promising to have sex with him and then decides to bail, is that financial fraud?\n\n\nExample:\n\n[Woman gets Tinder date arrested for refusing to marry her.](https://www.businessinsider.in/tinder-date-gone-wrong-an-indian-woman-gets-a-man-arrested/articleshow/69885133.cms)\n\n\n**Police are afraid of women.**\n\nIt\'s not uncommon here for women to verbally and physically abuse men on the street if they get into an argument for whatever reason, even for something as silly as a parking space dispute because they know that nobody will dare stop them, not even the police because they\'re afraid of catching a false harassment case if they try to interfere. And in most of these cases, the police will usually automatically arrest the guy despite him not doing anything and the girl being the attacker. But you will never see a guy even slap a girl in public without immediately being thrashed by a mob of white knights. Some women will even abuse the police with no fear when they\'re caught breaking the rules because they know the police won\'t dare lay a finger on them. If a guy ever tries that he will immediately be eating asphalt. The videos in the examples for this one are really worth watching.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n[Woman beats car driver on road while a crowd and police watch.

Guy arrested ofcourse.](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/owg0ob/up_girl_thrashes_cab_driver_in_front_of_police_no/)\n\n[CCTV footage shows woman kicking apartment staff for not going out and buying her cigarettes. Police arrest the guy despite the evidence and the woman strips in front of the police to avoid going with them.](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/mumbai-woman-strips-policemen-andheri-lokhandwala-oshiwara-videos-1377694-2018-10-29)\n\n[Woman damages three cars while driving drunk.

      <li>Title::: 'Too afraid to ask: A few hand-picked questions'<br />Body: 'Too afraid to ask: I often hear criticisms on how the Hinduism is evil, how they created the 3000 year old oppressive caste system which still lives in certain parts of the country. I can not recall anything else that is as much associated with Hinduism or Hindustan (India) as this. The issue with this is, the oppression exists even to this day. Equivalently, I have seen Muslims being demonized for the Islamic invasion of India and for the terror acts committed primarily (statistically) from their religion.\n\n1. When the British left India, the country was ravaged. During the pre-Islamic era, the idea of India did not exist, whereas during the Mughal rule, the concept came into existence, and during the last Muslim ruler, India was a humongous economic powerhouse. What do you make of this? What have the Islamic rulers done that still exist to this day (like the caste system)?\n2. What do you think the followers of Islam in India should acknowledge, for something that\'s still a problem in today\'s society? Will that change anything?\n3. Why do you, if at all you do, think just by a mere change of history we are taught at schools will strengthen the social fabric?\n4. Do you believe in *"Unity in the midst of Diversity"* or would you prefer to see a Hindu Rashtra in the long run? How do you think that would benefit the country, and what makes you think that will be possible given it\'s a huge country and everyone has their individual beliefs and idea of India?\n5. What do you make of the reservation system in the country given the scarcity of schools, colleges and job opportunities? Do you believe in uplifting the poor/backward classes to the level of the Upper Castes in each sector followed by removing affirmative actions from the country or vice versa? (Do you have any evidence/research/data in support of your claim?)\n6. If the marginalised sections do not get reservations or any other form of support which you may justify, the inequality gap will keep swelling since the rich/more privileged progress from where they already are while their poor/marginalized counterparts will struggle to hold up. \n\nFeel free to answer as many you wish and whenever you have time.

      <li>Title::: "A history of the Delhi Sultanate's relations with and resistance to the Mongols"<br />Body: 'We can start by placing things into context.\n\nTo do so, we need to understand the political situations in the Mongolian Empire and the Delhi Sultanate during the period between the death of Chinggis Khan and the last major Mongolian invasions into India. This period spans the tenure of two dynasties at Delhi, the Mamlukes and the Khaljis. But let\'s start with the Mongols first.\n\n\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\n\n\n***MONGOL EMPIRE*** :\n\n\n\nWhen the Great Khan Chinggis or Genghis, died in 1227 CE, he left behind an Empire that spanned the modern day regions of Mongolia, to the Hindu Kush and North eastern Persia. He was succeeded by his son Ogodei in 1229, after an assembly (quraltai) of the tribes. And it wouldn\'t be until 1241, that they first attempted an incursion into the territory of the Delhi Sultanate. During the reign of Ogodei we see 3 major events that not only built up pressure on the border between the Sultanate and the Mongol Empire but also resulted in the first confrontation between a Sultanate force and the Mongols:\n\n\n\n1) In 1235, after the first *quraltai* roughly 20,000 Mongol troops advanced on the Qarlughids, a small Turkic tribe which controlled Ghazni at the time. The Mongols advanced into Kabul, Ghazna and Zabulistan and the ruling Qarlughid, Hasan Qarlugh was forced to accept a Mongol resident at his court.\n\n\n\n2) In 1235, after the second *quraltai*  in the same year, Mongols moved further troops into the region. They sacked Kashmir and attacked the Qarlughids a second time although they were their tributaries now. Further, they invested Uchch and conquered territory on the very fringes of the Sultanate. In 1241, attacked Lahore and took the city while Bahram Shah was the Sultan of Delhi, whose response was very disappointing for the army and the nobles.\n\n\n\n3) In 1245-6, the Mongols attacked a third time, taking Multan from Hassan Qarlugh who had taken the province during the lull in hostilities. The Mongols once again invested Uchch but this time a force of the Sultanate. This force was commanded in part by Ghiyasuddin Balban (more on him later)\n\n\n\nWhat followed after the death of Ogodei in 1241, however was a period of turbulence, intrigue, uncertainty and fratricidal conflict within the Empire until finally in 1260, the Empire broke into civil war. The fragmentation of the Empire was only resolved in 1304, when the Western Khanates namely the Ilkhanate, the Golden Horde and the Chagatai Khanate, accepted the nominal supremacy of the Yuan dynasty of Kublai Khan. However, this peace did not imply the same singular leadership and the unification of the Mongols as under Genghis Khan. Border conflicts were a regular occurrence, and the 4 Khanates functioned and operated as seperate entities, until each fell in its own time.\n\n\n\nNow we turn our attention to the Delhi Sultanate, to understand their perspective of the events that unfolded during this period.\n\n\n\n***DELHI SULTANATE*** :\n\n\n\n* ***The Mamluk Dynasty***\n\n\n\nThe Ghurid Sultanate ruled by Muizuddin of Ghur was divided among his Mamlukes or Turkish slaves in 1206 after his death. Two slaves Yalduz and Qutbuddin Aibak, divided the Sultanate, the former ruling at Ghazni and the latter creating the Delhi Sultanate. While, Yalduz ruled at Ghazni, he also claimed to rule over Delhi, which was unacceptable to Aibak who ruled from Lahore. Hence, the Delhi Sultans cut their ties with Ghazni early on, distancing from Central Asian politics.\n\n\n\nAibak died in 1210, leaving his Sultanate still in a fragile state to Iltutmish (1210-1236) whose reign saw the wester border being secured, and expansion of the Sultanate in the east. After Iltutmish died however, his daughter was placed on the Throne according to his own wishes, but tragically she met a quick end by 1239 when Turkish chieftains revolted and removed her from power. What follows was a period of struggle between the monarchy and the Turkish chiefs, until one Turkish noble, Ulugh Khan, known in history as the aforementioned Ghiyasuddin Balban took the throne after much intrigue and conspiracy in 1265.\n\n\n\nBalban was a brutal man for a brutal age, but he was no mere brute either, for he possessed the intellect to see past court intrigue and focus on objectives that mattered. He constantly sought ways to increase his prestige and power and that of the monarchy. He reorganised the army to a more centralised structure and also employed spies at all levels of the military and beaurocratic structure to keep himself well informed of any plots and conspiracies against him. He pensioned off old and unfit soldiers, reorganised the military department called the Diwan-i-Arz and created bodyguard corps to guard the person of the Sultan at court, in public and on the battlefield.\n\n\n\nIn 1220, when the Mongols attacked and later dismantled and overthrew the Khwarezmians, the reason for them not invading India can be credited to two factors. 1)That Chinggis Khan, in a display of understanding and observance of international practice, chose to refrain from attacking a state which had elected to remain neutral in the conflict. 2) That he was far too preoccupied with the suppression and conquest at hand to be bothered with another theatre into India. Either way, from that period itself, the Mongol threat was as apparent as it would ever be. \n\n\n\nHence, after assuming the throne in 1265, Balban adopted a policy of both force and diplomacy:\n\n1) He repaired border forts in crucial regions such as Tabarhinda, Sunam and Samana and garrisoned strong forces in them.\n\n2) He sent diplomatic envoys to the Mongol Il-Khan of Iran, Hulagu and received the diplomats of the same with grandiose style and display to appease the Il-Khan. \n\n3) He chose to leave a chunk of western Punjab to the Mongols. And while the Mongols didn\'t attack Delhi, ill defined borders meant annual raids\n\n4) To meet the aforementioned challenge, Balban stayed at Delhi, refusing to go on extensive campaigns into the subcontinent, in order to focus on and meet Mongol incursions head on. Which he did annually.\n\n5) He managed to establish a defensive line due to his efforts, the Multan-Beas line, which his own son died while protecting.\n\nBalban died in 1286, but left behind a strong foundation to defend the Sultanate against the Mongols.\n\n\n\n* ***The Khalji Dynasty*** \n\n\n\nAfter Balban\'s death, Delhi was once again in confusion. Meanwhile, the incompetent successors he had left behind squabbled for the throne. It was owing to these factors that a group of Khalji (Turko-Afghan tribe) nobles, led by Jalal-ud-din who had been a warden of the western marches and was a commander who had won against the Mongols, overthrew the successors of Balban and Jalal-ud-din took the throne in 1290.\n\n\n\nIn 1292, Jalal-ud-Din defeated a major Mongol advance to Delhi under a grandson of Hulagu, Abdullah, who lead a force of 150,000 horses (contemporary figure, modern estimates differ), along the border defensive line of Tabarhinda, Sunam etc. After the battle, roughly 4000 Mongols, surrendered and converted to Islam at the edge of the sword, and were accepted as refugees in Delhi.\nIn 1296, Jalal-ud-Din was assassinated and succeeded by his nephew and son-in-law, Alauddin Khalji. \n\n\n\nIt was finally under the reign of Alauddin Khalji that the the Delhi Sultanate took rigourous steps to counted the ever present Mongol threat and indeed, push them all the way to the Indus. This was possible due to the reforms he introduced into the state and army. \n\n\n\n***ALAUDDIN KHALJI\'S REFORMS*** :\n\n\n\n1) The territory of the Delhi Sultanate included that administered by the Sultan directly or his beaurocracy (Khalisa lands), his vassal\'s territory and that of his Iqta holders, (Iqta holders were nobles given tracts of land to collect revenue from and raise forces out of this revenue to support war efforts). Alauddin incorporated large tracts of non-Khalisa lands into Khalisa category.\n\n\n\n2) He imposed 50% *kharaj* or agricultural land tax on all agricultural holdings in these lands\n\n\n\n3) He introduced strict price controls and made sure that prices of essentials (food grains, meat) and horses never went above his price ceiling. This ensured that soldiers paid lower wages could live satisfactory lives and the Sultan could raise Imperial troops in large numbers of cavalry.\n\n\n\n4) He set up special shops and markets for sale of essentials and horsed and and made sure to appoint officials here to avoid cheating and malpractice.\n\n\n\n5) He raised a large force of cavalry, and paid them in cash, which he acquired by obligating his subjects in Khalisa lands to pay taxes in cash rather than kind. And to make sure his farmers could pay said taxes in cash he ensured that local, informal intermediaries known as *banjaras* would be registered and ordered to trade in farm produce in cities and rural areas.\n\n\n\n**THE CONFRONTATION AND COUNTER**\n\n\n\nTherefore, during his reign of 1296-1316, he constantly improved the state of affairs to the point where he could defeat repeated Mongol Chagatai invasions sent by their Khan Dawa. \n\n\n\nFirst under Dawa Khan\'s son Qutlugh Khwaja, in 1299, with a force of 200,000 men ( contemporary figures, modern estimates differ) when the Mongols cut off communications for Delhi, surrounded it and even entered a number of streets. Alauddin faced the Mongols outside Delhi in a Battle and thanks to the personal bravery of a general by the name of Zafar Khan, the Mongols were forced to withdraw.\n\n\n\nOnce again, the Mongols arrived in 1303, while Alauddin was in Rajputana on a campaign. Khalji rushed back, fortified himself at Siri near Delhi and waited out the siege despite great hardships and pains, finally sapping Mongol morale and forcing them to withdraw.\n\n\n\nIn 1305, the tables had turned and at the Battle of Amroha, a 30,000 strong Sultanate army, under Malik Nayak defeated the Mongols with great slaughter. According to the 16th century historian Firishta, the heads of 8000 Mongols were used to build the Siri fort.\n\n\n\nIn 1306, another army of the Mongols sent by Dawa Khan was defeated by Malik Kafur. Dawa Khan died next year and no further Mongol incursions were attempted during the reign of the Khaljis. Following this defeat, lost territory was retaken and the boundary of the Sultanate once again touched the Indus. \n\n\n\n**CONCLUSION** :\n\n\n\nThe 13th century was a period during which the Delhi Sultanate faced one of its biggest existential threats. The Mongol empire, had it been united, and prepared in the early 13th might have crushed all resistance in the Northern part of the Indian subcontinent and would have flushed into the plains of North India. However, due to their own instability and preoccupation, as well as due to the reign and reforms of strong Sultans who had the foresight to focus on objectives that were of absolute importance, and rise above court intrigue and petty disputes, the Sultanate was spared complete extinction.\n\n\n\n**SOURCES** :\n\n\nSatish Chandra, "A History of Medieval India", Chapters 6 and 7.\n\nPeter Jackson, "The Delhi Sultanate : A Political and Military History", Chapters 6,9,11 and 12.\n\nTarikh-i-Firoz-Shahi by Ziauddin Barani.'<br />Author: 'MaharajadhirajaSawai'  id: 'owzb6r'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/owzb6r/a_history_of_the_delhi_sultanates_relations_with/</li>

I was wishing death upon myself at the age when kids ask santa for gifts. I had nobody to talk to. No friends, no adults, nothing. I was also being bullied. Then in mid-class 3, I beat the fuck out of 3 bullies, and bullying stopped. Class 4 was fun, mainly because I did not have to live with my father for whole 6 months. Then my school was changed, and with that came another round of bullying. Then school was changed after an year again, and shit became stable. I wasn\'t bullied. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon\'t tell me to talk to my parents. Fuck them, my mother is in depression and my father never listens. Call me whatever you want, but you know what? I\'d be more than happy if my parents kill themselves. That\'s exactly how much I love them. My mother is already clinically depressed, so I don\'t think she needs anything more than a rope and some encouragement. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI grew up without love. My father thinks that not showing any love to small kids will discipline them. I don\'t give a fuck whether he gives me attention or not now that I have grown up, but shit hurt when I was a child. I remember bidding him goodbye and him not giving a fuck. I remember being hit with an iron rod for sharping new pencils "without asking him". (I did it because sharpeners often got lost and I didn\'t want to ask him for new ones.) I could always relate to Voldemort. I like to work alone and I am filled with hatred. Pure seething hatred.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy father constantly ridicules me for not studying enough. He starts screaming if I get irritated. He\'ll irritate me, give his best to annoy me, to provoke me and I am not supposed to be triggered. If I get triggered, I\'ll be in trouble. Big, big trouble. Also, he only criticises me. My whole life I have never been appreciated by him for the work I do. Never. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am in Aakash coaching institute. My parents threw me in for NTSE. I was never interested. I like history and politics and biology. Rest? Not so much. But hey, I am supposed to study for NTSE, then for NEET so that I can fulfil their dream of becoming a doctor. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told them I wanted to study arts. Guess who got scolded for a whole hour?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have learned how to bottle up rage, and never show any emotions on my face. I have also learnt to not tell my father anything about me. Everything I say will be used against me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no access to professional psychiatrists and I have no money to afford any. I literally have no one\xa0 of my own at my own house (usage of house instead of home is intentional). I have no friends at school and I don\'t have any sort of trusted adult either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just wish to kill everyone in close vicinity at school, and that includes me too. I have been wanting death for too long. I have been seeking the doors to death\'s home for so long, and I wonder when will I get the opportunity to knock on it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: Citizens of India can\'t easily get access to guns so rest assured, I won\'t be jumping onto a killing spree anytime soon. Also, my school has announced online classes so school assemblies are a big fucking no no.'<br />Author: 'Kaundisamein'  id: 'owcobd'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/owcobd/i_wanted_to_do_a_school_shooting_and_kill_everyone/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Joshua and the "Pagan" genocide: re-naming of Project 20/20 and the Christian Missionary wish for a biblical Hindu genocide.'<br />Body: 'Joshua project is a mission to "harvest" people lying in geographies between 20N and 20S. Since much of the countries are Muslims and disallow Christian soul-vultures, India is the biggest target of these groups.\n\nThe project was originally called Project 20/20, and is meant to "harvest" India for Christ this century. We know that this is mostly a cover for completing the imperial project that the British started, and one that the Delhi babus and kleptocrats wholeheartedly support (judging by ample evidence in the constitution, legislature and judicial precedents).\n\nIt\'s important for us to understand why "Joshua" was chosen as a name here. \n\nThe reason it\'s called Joshua project has to with the genocide of "pagans" from Canaan.  In the Bible, the land of Israel was originally inhabited by "pagan" tribes incl. Caananites, Hittites, Amorites etc., who we are told were sacrificing humans, and indulging in other "amoral" practices and were "worshipping" Moloch. The genocide of these "evil" tribes is therefore part of the "divine" punishment.\n\nAbraham is promised this land by God. Moses setups the process for invasion of Canaan by its resident Jewish tribes now freed from Egypt. Joshua takes over leadership from Moses and becomes the leader of the Israelite tribes, and he finally fulfills the task of "purifying" the promised-land of the "devil-worshippers".\n\nLike the "manifest destiny" of the Americans and the "christian discovery" doctrine of the Europeans to justify colonialism and genocide of the natives, "God" in the Bible "promises" the land of Israel to the Jews. \n\nJoshua is the guy who "purifies" the promised land of the "pagans" by savagely killing them off one by one. Within the promised land - there is no peace, every man woman and child is killed without mercy. Outside the promised land slavery is the only option for the "pagans".\n\nThe major ethnic groups targeted for extermination ‚Äì the Hittites,  Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites etc. Hittites, we know from archaelogical evidence were Sanskrit speaking and \\*very much\\* like Hindus. It\'d be unsurprising if the other tribes were as well.\n\nDo you understand what they want to do in India ? Do you now see why the Christendom and Islamists are so obsessed with showing Hindus as "devil-worshippers" involved in all sorts of evil, adultery, and other "evils" (caste, sati, dowry, child marriage, child sacrifice...) ? \n\nThis is repeated about \\*every single\\* non-Abrahamic tribe that has been destroyed in the Americas and Africas. Knowing the lies that have been spread about Hindus, one wonders how much of those about these other destroyed peoples is true ?\n\nDo you know that all the Hindu leaders in the constitutional debates speak \\*exactly\\* in this way about Hindus ? That Hindu traditions only deserve minimum possible religious freedom in order to justify missionary propaganda based colonial policies ? \n\nThis is \\*core\\* belief in Abrahamic religions. Christianity cherishes itself as the "religion of love" and apparently their hate and desperation to genocide you is because they "love" you.\n\nIt\'s also a bit weird to see "Hindu Zionists" for this very reason. Do you morons know what you\'re supporting ? These tales are taken \\*extremely literally\\* and historically by the Abrahamic religions, and very different from Greek Mythology and Indian Ithihasa. \n\nChristian Zionists are obsessed with Israel because the New Testament says that Jesus will return once the Jews are back in Israel (and then they\'re sent to hell IIRC). Bush Jr. even mentioned Gog-Magog as his justification for invading Iraq.\n\nI don\'t think Indians realize the power of the destructive fire they\'re dealing with as AIM mentioned in brilliant podcast. India is the last stand of the non-Abrahamics (much of East Asia/S.E Asia is lost to "secularized" Christianity or Islam) after a war of \\~2000y, and Hindutva and its dolorous Gandhigiri is failing us badly.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kfu8Q61cPkg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kfu8Q61cPkg)\n\nSee,\n\n[https://dogdemons.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/joshua-and-the-genocide-of-canaan/](https://dogdemons.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/joshua-and-the-genocide-of-canaan/)\n\nTLDR; Joshua was the ISIS leader of his day. The American missionaries want a similar genocidaire to kill off the Hindus in India in order further their imperialist mission and gain more people into their cult of slavery.

Islamic terrorism in Kerala and a forewarning to other countries.\n\nCurrently, The southern Indian state of KERALA has MORE THAN 50% of ACTIVE COVID CASES in India and the mainstream media which is heavily left biased never reports it. It was expected. The covid cases surged exponentially after the state government gave lockdown relaxation of 3 days for islamic festival of Eid. \n\nNow, you would argue, people have a right to celebrate their festivals, fair enough. But when it comes to non islamic festivals, the government of Kerala takes a strong stance towards lockdown.

This bias is infuriating and yet the mainstream media remains silent. \n\nOn one hand, Kerala is a beautiful state with beautiful natural scenery and ancient Indian architectural marvels, while on other hand, with INCREASE in MUSLIM DEMOGRAPHICS, Kerala has become a HUB of ISLAMIC TERRORISM and ISIS recruitment activities. These islamic terrorist groups have become a national security threat. Sadly, the Kerala state government is in cahoots with these terrorist groups and doesn't do anything to curb them. \n\nDemographic changes affect national security.

      <li>Title::: 'Economic performance and reforms under Narendra Modi - Arvind Panagariya and Richard Rossow'<br />Body: "I came across two great blogs from [Arvind Panagariya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Panagariya) (an Economist) on Modi government's performance on the Economic reforms and reasons to be optimistic about India's growth. \n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/six-years-of-reforms-modi-has-established-his-reformist-credentials-alongside-pms-like-rao-and-vajpayee/\n\n&gt; Economic reforms enacted during the ten day monsoon session ending September 23 firmly establish Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs credentials as a reformist PM. His record now rivals those of Prime Ministers Narasimha Rao and Atal Bihari Vajpayee and surpasses by a wide margin that of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during his entire ten year tenure.\n\n&gt; **What Modi has done begins to look particularly impressive when we take into account the fact that the reforms he has enacted have been politically far more contentious than those enacted by predecessor governments. The need for some of his big-ticket reforms had been recognised for nearly two decades, but all prior governments sidestep them on the pretext that there was no consensus for them.**\n\n\n&gt; Begin with the **Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code**. As far back as 2000, Justice VB Eradi Committee had documented the glacial pace at which companies under bankruptcy proceedings could be liquidated in India. It noted that as of December 31, 1999, 48% of the cases took more than ten years and 15% cases more than 25 years to complete. The present author had pitched for a bankruptcy law along the lines of the United States Bankruptcy Code in his 2008 book, India: The Emerging Giant. But it was not until 2016 that Modi government enacted such a law.\n\n&gt; Labour law reforms have an even longer history. They were discussed as far back as 1991 when Rao implemented the first set of reforms. But they did not get traction at the time. Later, finance minister Yashwant Sinha promised them in his bold 2001-02 budget but was unable to deliver.\n\n&gt; UPA, which came to power in 2004, ruled out these reforms. Indeed, it went so far as to drop even a small provision for a more flexible labour law regime in special economic zones (SEZs) that the outgoing Vajpayee government had made in its draft SEZ Bill of 2004. During its ten year rule, UPA introduced no labour law reforms. Ice was finally broken by the state of Rajasthan in 2014.\n\n&gt;** But genuine wide-ranging reforms have come only now, with the Modi government replacing 29 disparate and occasionally contradictory labour laws by four considerably more coherent labour codes that make labour markets far more flexible and employment friendly. The new labour law regime gives employers the right to terminate workers in enterprises with 300 or fewer workers (up from previous threshold of 100 workers). More importantly, it gives states full freedom to raise this threshold.**\n\n&gt; Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh governments, which had recently wanted to suspend labour laws for three years, can now be genuinely bold and raise the threshold to 10,000 workers ‚Äì to encourage large enterprises and create well-paid jobs. The new labour codes also cut inspector raj, lower compliance burden, empower women to work night shifts and do away with registration requirements for enterprises with less than 40 workers if not using power and 20 workers if using power.\n\n&gt; **The third set of reforms relates to marketing of agricultural produce, contract farming and controls on transportation, storage, prices and distribution under Essential Commodities Act (ECA) of 1955.** The Vajpayee government had initiated marketing and contract farming reforms in 2003 through a model act to be adopted by states, but the latter implemented it only half-heartedly. The problem remained largely unsolved. **As regards ECA, economists have called for its repeal or restrict its use for decades.** Modi government has finally implemented these reforms.\n\n&gt; The fourth difficult-to-navigate area of reform has been medical education. UPA had repeatedly tried to replace the highly corrupt Medical Council of India (MCI) with an alternative regulatory body, but failed. The present government has successfully put in place an entirely new legislation under which the National Medical Commission has finally replaced MCI. The government has additionally passed parallel laws governing education in homeopathy and Indian systems of medicine and laid down the foundation of a new regulatory architecture in medical education.\n\n&gt; **Fifth, Modi government has gone on to liberalise foreign direct investment in sectors such as defence, civil aviation, railways, coal, mining and e-commerce that prior governments had found difficult to open. It has also opened the automatic route to the point that it could disband the foreign investment promotion board.**\n\n&gt; **Finally, we have two truly mega reforms: GST and the drop in the corporate profit tax to 17% for new manufacturing firms and 25% for other firms.**\n\n&gt; Plugging of leakages in social programmes through direct benefit transfers; introduction of commercial mining in coal; building of roads, bridges, tunnels, ports and airports at accelerated pace; a robust digital infrastructure founded on innovative Unified Payments Interface platform; digitalisation of numerous government services to improve the ease of living; toilets for all in rural India; electrification of all rural households; and rapid expansion of rural roads and rural housing are some additional achievements worthy of note.\n\n&gt; The government‚Äôs record is not without blemish and I have written critically of its embrace of import substitution and inaction on privatisation. But criticism without appreciation of positive accomplishments misleads rather than informs the readers.\n\nAnd his excellent rebuttal to Chidambaram explaining the difference between the growth  vs reforms under an incumbent PM.\n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/defending-modis-reforms-record-chidambaram-shifted-goalpost-from-growth-delivered-by-a-pm-to-growth-in-his-tenure/\n\n&gt; Economist Paul Streeten famously said that whereas academics make progress by sharpening questions they ask, politicians do so by obfuscating them. My column last month had asked a clear question: Did the reforms by Prime Minister Narendra Modi place him in the same league as PMs Narasimha Rao and Atal Bihari Vajpayee and ahead of PM Manmohan Singh? Answering this question required comparing reform records of the PMs, which is what I did. I answered the question in the affirmative.\n\n&gt; True to his trade, distinguished politician and lawyer P Chidambaram has taken issue with my conclusion, not by offering evidence to the contrary but by changing the question. He asks which PM delivered most growth and concludes, ‚ÄúBy that unquestionable standard, the ‚Äòboom years‚Äô under Dr Manmohan Singh make Dr Singh the reformer par excellence. Let Mr Modi deliver growth before he can aspire to a place among the pantheon of economic reformers.‚Äù\n\n&gt; In view of the fact that the question ‚Äúwho delivered most reforms‚Äù is different from ‚Äúwho delivered most growth,‚Äù nothing Chidambaram has said changes my mind. He will need to offer a lot more evidence of reforms by Singh to change my mind.\n\n&gt; Nonetheless, let me dissect more carefully the question on which Chidambaram prefers to focus: Who delivered the most growth? The first point to note is that how much growth ‚Äútook place‚Äù during the tenure of a PM and how much growth he ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù are two distinct questions. As best as I can tell, Chidambaram considers these as one and the same question. Hence his conclusion: Singh ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù the most growth.\n\n&gt; For a moment, let us play by his rule and treat the growth delivered by a PM as synonymous with that taking place during his tenure. By this metric, Singh delivered 7.7% growth over ten years, Modi 6.8% over six years, Vajpayee 5.9% over six years and Rao 5.1% over five years. The obfuscation of the question thus does make Singh the best performing PM, as claimed by Chidambaram. But it also makes Rao the worst performing PM.\n\n&gt; If we additionally accept the growth during a PM‚Äôs tenure as the indicator of his reformist credentials, as Chidambaram would have us do, Rao would become the first PM to lose his place in the pantheon of reformist PMs.\n\n&gt; This would, of course, be an absurdity of the highest order. Growth during Rao‚Äôs tenure was low not because he was not reformist ‚Äì quite the contrary, he is the father of India‚Äôs economic reforms ‚Äì but from the crisis he had inherited. The growth rate during his first year was just 1.1%.\n\n&gt; But he did not ‚Äúdeliver‚Äù this growth in any meaningful sense. Instead, he inherited it from his predecessors who had brought the economy to the doorstep of a balance-of-payments crisis in 1991 by running large fiscal deficits on the back of large external borrowing relative to export earnings. In contrast, Rao himself handed his successor a financially sound economy that had grown 7.6% during his last year.\n\n&gt; **Turn next to Singh whom Chidambaram considers ‚Äúthe reformer par excellence.‚Äù When Vajpayee lost the 2004 election, he bequeathed to Singh an economy that had grown 7.9% in 2003-04. This growth had been the result of sustained reforms, especially during the last four years of his tenure. The question one must ask is exactly what reforms did Singh do to ‚Äúdeliver‚Äù 7.9% growth in 2004-05 and even higher rates in the following four years?**\n\n&gt; During a public debate with an erstwhile colleague of Chidambaram, I asked him to name three major reforms to which the high growth during the Singh era could be attributed. **Unsurprisingly, no answer was forthcoming. Chidambaram has likewise chosen to sidestep this critical question, resting his claim of Singh as the top reformer on the growth rate during his tenure.**\n\n&gt; To his credit, despite pressures from within the Congress and left parties in the coalition, Singh did not allow the reforms of predecessor governments to be reversed during his first term. That helped preserve the growth momentum he had inherited. But sadly, Singh was unable to resist those pressures in his second term.\n\n&gt; **Numerous policy mistakes including retrospective taxation, weakened fiscal discipline, repeated interest rate hikes, Land Acquisition Act of 2013, irresponsible lending by public sector banks and blocking of environmental clearances followed.

      <li>Title::: 'A proposal to replace the reservation system with a fairer one -OC'<br />Body: 'I cannot deny that caste system exists. However I also feel that the reservation system exacerbates it. I was a general student who was insulated from all this caste-vaste tomfoolery. I didn‚Äôt know the caste of my friends and I also didn‚Äôt care. Sure, my parents used to make casteist remarks and actions but i always thought it was wrong. This all changed when I entered the JEE rat race, I now got a personal hatred for the lower caste people. But then I realised it‚Äôs the system not the people who are bad. This is not only my story, even my parents were liberal and ‚Äòenlightened‚Äô became very casteist. Fortunately they mellowed out now but still the traces of hate are there.\n\nWhy I feel the reservation system is bad -fosters division -kills merit(very debatable but just putting it out) -changes the whole conversation from ‚Äòwe should build new schools to accommodate all people‚Äô to ‚Äòwhich group will vote in exchange for greater reservation ( all that Punjab Haryana Jat reservation)\n\nWhat I propose as a system instead(very similar to the Texas system) :\n\n-in all the schools top 20% will go to a magnet school and then to like super high end research shit in stem and arts and commerce -mid 60% will go to mid level stuff ( engineering schools to implement the research in the above schools) -bottom 20% will go to skill or vocational training\n\nObviously there should be a provision to move up and down the three ‚Äòclasses‚Äô because one can‚Äôt decide on a persons ability too early.\n\nWhy is this system better?\n\n-in the jee system a poor kid has to compete with all the rich kids who can afford coaching. In this you are only competing against those in your  ‚Äòweight class‚Äô I.e people with the same economic status -removes the need for reservations all together -generates a steady stream of people skilled workers to man the factories\n\nHopefully this helps us achieve the post caste society.\n\nNote: this is a draft.

      <li>Title::: 'LAC issue of Ladakh is a Political issue, not Military.'<br />Body: "And it can only be resolved Politically. India and China cannot solve the boundary dispute by making two Military commanders sit and talk out a solution.\n\nIndia and China are two of the oldest nations in existence and never was a need for a clearly demarcated boundary ever felt necessary. Historically, the two nations have always been natural allies, relentlessly defending themselves from uncivilized and barbaric invaders from north and west, and succeeded in surviving, even as the remaining civilizations in other parts of the world like Persians and Romans could not withstand the same invasive forces.\n\nIndia and China have much to gain from a friendly relationship when they are facing the same adversaries in the west led by US that does not want East to rise and pose a challenge to the west's global hegemony. China is standing up to US's interference in China's internal issues, it's time India stood up as well. Recently US Secretary of State came to India and brazenly interfered with India's internal issues, US would never attempt such a shenanigan against China. India should also communicate to US that this is not acceptable.\n\nIndia and China can benefit by mutually opening their markets and free trade as the two are the biggest consumers in the world and growing bigger. Technologically also the two nations are no longer dependent on the west and have attained a great degree of self reliance, more so China and India not too far behind either.\n\nWhat is required is the two heads of state sitting together and resolving the differences for good and let free trade between the two countries start benefitting their economies. Highways and Railways could be built connecting the two countries and make the flow of people and goods easier. For the first time in history a direct and fast land connection between India and China has become possible and both countries possess such technology.\n\nLike Europe came together after the two devastating WWs and progressed through trade, India and China can replicate the same phenomenon and bring about a golden Asian Age."<br />Author: 'nextpandemic'  id: 'ovlgu4'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ovlgu4/lac_issue_of_ladakh_is_a_political_issue_not/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'In India, it seems like no one is Indian anymore.'<br />Body: 'Either one is pro BJP or pro congress. And there are many more "pros"  that people use to identify themselves. Someone is pro Capitalism, someone is against it. Then there are rightists and leftists. Then there are people who are so called nationalists and people being termed as anti nationalists. Some are pro government and some are anti government. Everyone has taken their stand and no matter what they are not ready to change it. People who are atheists think that spreading of atheism will help solve nation\'s problem and  some other think that religion should be the driving force of nation. \n\nWe need to realise that if one whole group always thinks on similar likes then they have been indoctrinated. Democracy means that whatever majority want, country will be governed in that way ( not literally but still) and it is presumed that on evey new matter, definition of majority and minority will change. Because people who would be supporting stance of political party A on 1st matter might support stance of political party B on another matter. But that is not what happens. \n\nPeople who are in support of BJP are in favour of Ram Mandir construction, CAA, UCC, removal of article 370, they also support foreign policy of India and economic policies of India under BJP. People who are against BJP are against of all those things mentioned. See, that is the problem. We need people who form independent opinions on each matter. \n\nIt has been observed that in the political atmosphere, peope who are centrists are mocked for not taking a stand. But this needs to change now. Centralism should be the new trend. People who put their nation first and then anything else. Nearly everybody in India thinks that he wants India to move ahead ( apart from a few idiots), be it rights or leftists or anybody else, but they have narrow visions. In the name of developing India, they just want to spread their ideology. \n\nThe point that it is not wrong to change opinions on matters now and then and being a centralist is not something to be looked down upon needs to be mainstream. This constant usage of terms like those banned by India speaks need to go away. At least we should expect this much from youth of India. People who do genuinely care about India need to come together and make their voice heard.

Ours is the culture that produced Kamasutra and Khajuraho. It was only after Muslim invasions that our culture closed down. An open culture became a culture of shame and taboo. \n\n\nInvasions were not new to India even then. Many invaders came to Indian before Muslim invaders for example greeks but there was a marked difference between earlier invaders and Muslims. Muslims came with a lot of moral policing and anti-women violence. From taking women as slaves and selling them outside India to rampant rapes. Rape became an instrument to humiliate and break kafir women who were raped and sold as commodities in markets. The whole culture closed down and the tradition of keeping women locked up in houses packed in clothes started from fear of abduction, rape and sex slavery. \n\n\nThis cultural of sexual suffocation was further cemented when people of another Abrahmic religion i.e. The British started to rule India. British were as hard nosed and puritanical when it came to sex as Muslims if not more. Infact word ‚Äòvictorian‚Äô is used to describe anything conservative to the point of being close-minded and stiff in English language.  After being shoved down our throats our society absorbed the garbage of victorian morality too. Sex became obscene and indecent in law. There are British era law that criminalize distribution of sexually explicit material and physica/sexual affection in public (read anywhere outside home) that are still part of India's law. Although we celebrate independence day every year the same system and mindset that governed when we were colonized govern us now. Brown saheb replaced Gore saheb. Sex is still obscene and indecent. \n\nIn this process of imposing victorian era morality and laws present government has been cracking down on adult content by blocking it and arresting people like Raj Kundra for making it. Welcome to ‚Äúnew India‚Äù (Colonized India Repackaged). \n\nOn one hand we take pride in Kamasutra and Khajuraho telling the world and ourselves that we have always been an open society that did not look down upon sexuality. On the other hand we easily fall for the propaganda that adult content is bad and people making it are criminals. \n\nWe are not sexually frustrated culture that make people wait for an after life and 72 hoors. We are not Hijabi people folks. We are a culture that celebrated sex. The choice was upto you if you want to be ascetic or live a life full of sex. There is no church or maulvis to force in Indian culture.

Last year, Mizoram targeted a village on Tripura  border because Hindus of the village planned to construct  Shiva temple.\n\n [Mizoram imposes Section 144 in disputed village along Tripura border over temple construction | North East India News,The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/north-east-india/mizoram/mizoram-imposes-section-144-in-disputed-village-along-tripura-border-over-temple-construction-6758909/) \n\n For Mizoram, which does not celebrate "International Yoga Day" because Church considers Yoga "anti Christian", building a Hindu temple was too much.  Mizoram Government imposed section 144 because  "a Hindu temple would disturb peace and tranquility". \n\nHere is a question:  Mizoram was earlier a district in Assam by name "Mizo hills"  When it started agitation for statehood, its population was 1.96 lakh.  Even today, Mizoram population is 10.91 lakhs.  How could a small district bully the nation to accept its separatist demand? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o35oyp2bu5e71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cb77cccecdc20b2a06f0febf083afa54ceb5922\n\nTo attempt an answer, we delve into history. \n\nAnd history is shocking. \n\nThis region was ruled by Ahoms &amp; then British.   But there is not a SINGLE mention of "Mizos" or "Mizoram" until 19th &amp; early 20th century.  In-fact, it was officially known as "Lushai Hills" until 1952.\n\n Who are the "Mizos"?   Earlier, this region was inhabited by Reangs (Hindu) &amp; Chakmas (Buddhist).There was no trace of any "Mizo"  Who we now refer to as "Mizos" are actually a collection of distinct tribes like Lushai, Kuki, Paite  &amp; Hmar.  They all came to India in 18th century.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9x7mv1wou5e71.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1981137e0f7f21ecc355884d73c0e162238a7b0\n\nAccording to their own folklore, the original home of the "Mizo" tribes seems to be a place called Sinlung.  Mizo historians themselves identified this place to be present Silung in South East China.  They established themselves in Chin hills (present day Burma) by 17th century.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x4j0zsytu5e71.png?width=655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4104aaf9398a1069a6cf0c64f118d04cc858db3\n\n However, there was no common "Mizo identity" among these tribes and they were warring with each other. Abducting each other  and head hunting was the norm.   Infact, the earliest known picture of any Mizo was that of a Lushai woman  captured by a Southern tribe called Mara. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/7oqsoatyu5e71.png?width=532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b445472e62a135f48eff7225bfcb16f21a030df)\n\nWhen the Mizo tribes first encountered the Hindus of Assam,their feeling was of admiration.  An early Mizo Christian Newspaper warned  "Hindu customs,especially Assamese customs, are something the Mizo really appreciate.  Mizos even say \'If only we were born as Vai(plain Hindus)".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vknae314v5e71.png?width=490&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58c3a8f10aabe429a524615443659dae846396c8\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bs2pc1i5v5e71.png?width=529&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22c4d10b1b8ebf9e86a01af3a86aecd8e9306105\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n The missionaries sensed the danger of Mizos adopting Hindu culture and immediately sprung into action. Result was complete conversion of Mizos. Starting from dress, music, culture ,religion, and custom, everything was discarded.\n\nHere is their traditional Pre Christian  style:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5z3x9lknv5e71.png?width=1199&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa719a7d502070c3099bcc3bf80a1a664eb6ddc9\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c23267vov5e71.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be9c8a4abc77a8db7319f2f867e09cea641addaa\n\n It were the Christian missionaries who first started inculcating "Mizo racial  identity". For example, the Baptist church wrote that "the ethnicities of Lushei, Kuki &amp; Chin can be classified as one race. They are  sturdy hill warriors unlike the effeminate Assamese and Bengali".\n\nSoon enough, the traditional Mizo animist temples  were converted to Churches. Even at this point, Churches were not built in Christian style. They were still the old thatched huts with the traditional drum hanging out.  Drum had  great significance in Pre Christian Mizo religion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5tn0na5wv5e71.png?width=1199&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a452c89f82e923822ebd15a2a41d6ad74a93a14\n\nBy early 20th century, Mizos began shedding their traditional costumes which they themselves referred to as "primitive". They adopted western style, costume, religion &amp; script. Bands of Mizos children raised up in Churches began touring all over India to sing Christian choirs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53nxai80w5e71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd4223daf60e16c7739fb43a135ea662934fa37d\n\nThe new Lushai tribe converts formed a "Young Lushai Association" in 1935. One of the stated aims of the association was to "remove every trace of  pre Christian pagan culture among the tribes".  The Christian association stressed for  "a common identity of all converted tribes".\n\nConverted tribes began to increasingly use the common, now Christian, identity of "Mizo" as opposed to anything specific to any tribe.  "Young Lushai Association" renamed itself  "Young Mizo Association". \n\nLushai Hills were renamed as "Mizo Hills".\n\nThus the ethnogenesis of Mizos. \n\nDuring the time of Independence, A group of Mizos formed "United Mizo Freedom Organisation".  They demanded that this region be merged in Burma as opposed to India.\n\nThey claimed that they were ethnically closer to Burmese Chin than Hindus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q22jubxcw5e71.png?width=479&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0beed8ee3f6e5ba6db69d3b287426ee9a35d892\n\nWhen their demands of separate nationhood were ignored, Mizo separatists formed a terr0rist  organization named Mizo National Front (MNF) in 1966.\n\nTheir aim was to "kick India out of  Mizoram through violent means if necessary".  They began kiIIing Assamese, Hindus &amp; Army Men.\n\n MNF then received funding and training from Pakistan\'s ISI. Many of Mizo youth escaped to East Pakistan(Bangladesh) to receive military training.   The Present CM of Mizoram, was a member of this terr0rist group MNF.\n\nHe himself confessed it in a media conversation.\n\nWhen India defeated Pakistan in 1971, Mizo CM  was hiding in Pakistan along with his comrades.  He was involved with an MNF unit named "Joshua".\n\nIt was named after the Biblical commander Joshua who defeated, killed Pagan Canaanites and ended their Pagan kingdom in Israel. \n\nHere, as Mizoram CM himself confesses in his interview, he was in Islamabad until 1975 as part of ISI training to MNF.  When Indian army conquered Dhaka, he managed to escape narrowly.  He calls it "James Bond type escape".\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/65dj6a7tw5e71.png?width=648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e14079e96b1526e9e0af0978987280cb4154569\n\nDuring the Mizoram insurgency, Hindus were targeted.\n\nViolence was unleashed on Hindus and 34,000 Hindu Reang(Bru) were kicked out of Mizoram.  They are still living in refugee tents  of Tripura.\n\n [34,000 Bru refugees to be settled in Tripura - The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/displaced-bru-tribals-from-mizoram-to-permanently-settle-in-tripura/article30577152.ece) \n\nThe Hindus Reangs were original inhabitants before Mizo migration. However, they were ruthlessly targeted.\n\n"Quit Mizoram" notices with deadlines were posted in Reang villages.\n\n‚ÄúMizoram is for Mizos only‚Äù said Pu Laldenga. He later became Mizoram CM.\n\n [Quit Mizoram Notices : Fear of the Other | Economic and Political Weekly (epw.in)](https://www.epw.in/journal/2014/25/reports-states-web-exclusives/quit-mizoram-notices.html) \n\n "This thread will be continued..." - Bharadwaj'<br />Author: 'halfblood_ghost'  id: 'otyn4s'<br />Score:55<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/otyn4s/an_eye_opening_thread_by_bharadwaj_on_the_origins/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'India Tokyo 2020 - Athletics Competitor Guide and Analysis- Our best medal hopes.'<br />Body: " **With the Olympics Athletics finally starting tomorrow, decided to have a look at our Medal Hopes.**\n\n**Going by the media, most of the hope is pinned on Neeraj but quite a few of them are on the edge of medals, and with a PB performance might just get a bronze, or sneak a silver.**\n\n**So I decided to look where they'd have placed at Rio/Doha with a close to PB performance. In order of least likely to most likely contenders (in my opinion).**\n\n400M X 4 Relay\n\n***Rio 2016 Podium - USA - 2.57.30 (WL), JAM - 2.58.16, BAHAMAS - 2.58.49***\n\n***Doha 2019 Podium - USA - 2.56.59 (WL), JAM - 2.57.90, BEL - 2.58.78***\n\n* Indian team will likely be the best or second best asian team, but unfortunately Asians are at the bottom of this one. We're around 3-5 seconds off the podium places so very unlikely to spring a surprise. USA and JAM runaway favourites, and another world record may be set here.\n\n4 x 400M Relays Mixed\n\n***Rio 2016 Podium - N/A event debut.***\n\n***Doha 2019 Podium - USA - 3.09.34, JAM - 3.11.78, BAHRAIN - 3.11.82 (Another team full of bought athletes).***\n\n* First time it's held at the olympics. In Doha, India qualified for the final, and finished 7th. Gold is 6 seconds gap, Bronze 4. A bridge too far perhaps, but we're improving. USA and Jamaica the favourites, Bahrains bought team may also have a chance.\n\n50KM Racewalk\n\n***Rio 2016 Podium - Matej Toth (SVK) - 3.40.58, Jared Tallent (AUS) - 3.41.16, Hirooki Arai (JAP) - 3.41.24***\n\n***Doha 2019 Podium - Yasuke Suzuki (JAP) - 4.04.20, Joao Vieira (POR) - 4.04.59, Evan Dunfee (CAN) - 4.05.02***\n\nWhoever wins here, it may be the last time, the 50km Racewalk is out from the 2024 Olympics, so in a way Gurpreet may not be a medal chance, but he'll be in the last 50km walk in the olympics (for now).\n\n* **Gurpreet Singh - PB of 3.59.42 in National Championships (2021)** \\- Only one contender, his recent PB would put him in the mid 20's, going to need a stephen bradbury to win here.\n\n200M Women\n\n***Rio 2016 Podium - Elaine Thomspson (JAM) - 21.78s, Dafne Schippers (NED) - 21.88s, Tori Bowie (USA) - 22.15s***\n\n***Doha 2019 Podium - Dina Asher-Smith (UK) - 21.88s, Brittany Brown (USA) - 22.22s, Mujinga Kabundji (SWI) - 22.51s.***\n\nDutee isn't a podium contender, and a second is an eternity in the 200m sprints. Going on form Gabby Thomas (USA) is the favourite. Asher-Smith is also a top favourite, though she's restricted her recent running. The field is crowded with contendors, and the podium is anyone's guess.\n\n* Dutee Chand - PB of 23.00s @ Asian Games 2018 - (Possibly the second most known athletics person for India here apart from Neeraj) She is our only 2 event athlete in the athletics. Her 200M time isn't too great (relatively ofcourse), and she'll need to smash her PB to even reach the semis.\n\n400M Hurdles\n\n***Rio 2016 Podium - Kerron Clement (USA) - 47.73s, Boniface Mucheru Tumuti (KEN) - 47.78s, Yasmani Copello (TUR) - 47.92s***\n\n***Doha 2019 Podium - Karsten Warhold (NOR) - 47.42s, Rai Benjamin (USA) - 47.66s, Abderrahman Samba (QAT) - 48.03s (Bought athlete by Qatar, Born Saudi, and from Mauritania)***\n\n* **Jabir Madari Pillyalil - PB of 49.13 at Doha 2019 Asian Championship** \\- While he has decent experience, and His PB would get him through comfortably to the semifinals, he's not a medal chance. Ayyasamy Dharun who holds the NR missed out on Tokyo, stumbling in the qualification. For Jabir, it would take a stephen bradbury like event with the front runners all tripping into hurdles for a medal here. Jabir can still be proud to be India's first 400M hurdler at the Olympics.\n\n100M Women\n\n***Rio 2016 Podium - Elaine Thompson (JAM) - 10.71s, Tori Bowie (USA) - 10.83s, Shelley-Ann Fraser-Pyrce (JAM) - 10.86s***\n\n***Doha 2019 Podium - Shelley-Ann Fraser-Pyrce (JAM) - 10.71s (WL), Dina Asher-Smith (UK) - 10.83s, Maria-Josee Ta Lou (IVC) - 10.9s***\n\nDutee is a rank outside in this event. She failed to get past the heats last time, but this time round she looks to have improved enough to make it to the semi's. The favourites are Shelley and Ellaine, as well as the likes of Dina of UK and Javianne Olivier of USA.\n\n* **Dutee Chand (NR) - PB of 11.17s at Indian Grand Prix 4 (2021)** \\- Her 100M time is decent enough to get into the Semi's. She'll need to pull something special to bridge the 0.1-0.2s gap to the final, and the 0.3-0.4 second gap to Bronze but her PB is recent giving hope there's more to come.\n\nWomens Javelin\n\n***Rio 2016 Podium - Sara Kolak (CRO) - 66.18m, Sunette Viljoen (NED) - 64.92m, Barbora Spotakova (CZE) - 64.8m***\n\n***Doha 2019 Podium - Kelsey-Lee Barber (AUS) - 66.56m, Liu Shiying (CHN) - 65.88m, Lu Huihui (CHN) - 65.49m***\n\nAnnu Rani is unlikely to win a medal. She needs to keep improving her PB as she has, and hope one of the others has an off-day to sneak in, but it's unlikely. In her favour are defending olympics champions and athletics champions Kelsey and Kolak being in poor form. Neither have thrown above 61m, meaning Annu is in better form. Andrejczyk looks like a good chance for Gold going by her performances this year. The pack behind is quite open, with Christin Hussong, Maggie Mallone, and the chinese medalists from 2019 among the contenders.\n\n* **Annu Rani (NR) - PB of 63.24m @ National Athletic Championships in 2021** \\- Annu Rani has big stage experience, setting her first National Record at Doha 2019. At Doha she finished 8th. She is a good chance to make the final, but a medal seems out of reach for her. She'd need to beat her PB by 2 meters or so, and that to under the pressure of the olympics, but never say never.\n\n3000M Steeplechase\n\n***Rio 2016 Podium - Conseslus Kipruto (KEN) - 8.03.28 (OR), Evan Jager (USA) - 8.04.28, Mahieddne Mekhissi-Benabbad (FRA) - 8.11.52***\n\n***Doha 2019 Podium - Conseslus Kipruto (KEN) - 8.01.35 (WL), Lamecha Girma (ETH) - 8.01.36, Soufiane El Bakkali (MOR) - 8.03.76***\n\nConseslus Kiproto missed out this olympics, with his compatriot Leonard Bett among the favourites. Kenya has won every 3000m Steeplechase it has competed in (the 2 times they boycotted the games, they missed out). Girma and Bakkali will arrive as favourites.\n\n* **Avinash Sable (NR) - PB of 8.20.20 at the Federation Cup in 2021** \\- Avinash is our first competitor tomorrow. He's a man on a mission, having broken the National record 4 times in the last 3 years, Improving by 8 seconds in the process. He won the Silver in the 2019 Asian Championship and has experience with pressure and the bigger stages. His PB should put him into the final, but a medal is not really on the table here.\n\nMens Long Jump\n\n***Rio 2016 Podium - Jeff Henderson (USA) - 8.38m, Luvo Manyonga (SAF) - 8.37m, Greg Rutherford (UK)- 8.29m***\n\n***Doha 2019 podium - Tajay Gayle (JAM) - 8.69M (WL) (NR), Jeff Henderson (USA) - 8.39M, Juan Miguel Echevarria (CUB) - 8.34m***\n\nVery fine margins in Long Jump, and the jumping line adds another element of pressure. Overstepping with nerves, and mistiming often happens. JuVaughn Harrison is one of the favourites to win not just long jump, but incredibly high jump too. Echevarria is another favourite and has pressure experience unlike Harrison. Tajay Gayle too is among the favourites, though he's not jumped as well as Doha. It's an extremely crowded field, where you'd be lucky to predict the podium.\n\n* **Murali Shreeshankar (NR) - PB of 8.26m @ National Athletics Championships in 2021** \\- Talked about much less than Neeraj, but a performance close to PB would put him with an outside chance at medals too. His PB would have put him 4th at Rio. His performance at Doha only got a best of 7.62m, but he was 20 in Doha, and will have gained pressure experience from there. Recently he's gained attention for not jumping so well in the fitness trials pre-olympics. If he can find his mojo though, he's a strong challenger for a Bronze. He won bronze at the Asian Junior Championships at 19 years of age. He should be able to make it to the finals, and in a crowded field, he has enough to sneak a bronze if he performs at his best.\n\n20KM Racewalk Mens\n\n***Rio 2016 Podium - Wang Zhen (CHN) - 1.19.14, Cai Zelin (CHN) - 1.19.26, Dane Bird-Smith (AUS)- 1.19.37***\n\n***Doha 2019 Podium - Toshikazu Yamanishi (JAP) - 1.26.34, Vasiliy Mazinov (RUS) - 1.26.49, Perseus Kalstrom (SWE) - 1.27.00***\n\nRacewalk times are hard to compare event to event, and so it's hard to gauge where we sit exactly. Of our three competitors, the one who's had pressure experience is Irfan K.T. setting his P.B. in London. It's to be noted though that London's cool climate is a stark contrast to Tokyo right now, and so perhaps the best time in comparison is Sandeep Kumar who recently broke the National Record. The favourites like the Womens Race, includes the Chinese, but Yamanishi is outright favourite, and the Japanese could sweep the podium thanks to home advantage. The Heat and humidity of Tokyo may also suit our race walkers, so I wouldn't write them off a Bronze or even a silver.\n\n* **Sandeep Kumar (NR - Not ratified yet) - PB of 1.20.16 @ Indian Race Walking Championships 2021 -** At the ripe old age of 35, Sandeep Kumar is still walking away gleefully. He has experience at the big stage, he competed in Rio in the 50km, placing 35th of 50. He has just set a new National record, and he has the potential to be flirting around the podium areas.\n* **Irfan Kolothum Thodi (NR)- PB of 1.20.21 @ London Olympics in 2012 -** The man who's seen it before, Irfan K.T. He finished 10th at rio, and was only an agonizing 37 seconds away. The heartbreak in London will fuel his determination. He was 22 in London, and the 9 years of experience, may also give him a leg up.\n* **Rahul Rohilla - PB of 1.20.26 @ National Open Race Walking in 2021 -** The youngster of the Trio at just 25 years of age. He's improving a lot, and if he keeps the trajectory, he could open up a medal chance. He lacks big event experience though, and this will be his first test on the major stage.\n\n20KM Racewalk Womens\n\n***Rio 2016 Podium - Liu Hong (CHN) - 1.28.35, Maria Guadulupe Gonzalez (MEX) - 1.28.37, Lu Xiuzi (CHN) - 1.28.42***\n\n***Doha 2019 Podium - Liu Hong (CHN) - 1.32.53, Qieyang Shenjie (CHN) - 1.33.10, Yang Liujing (CHN) - 1.33.17***\n\nIt's hard to completely gauge where our rising stars sit. The atmospheric conditions are such a big part of racewalking, as you can see in Doha, times were 4-5 minutes slower. Two things are undeniable though, Liu Hong is the big favourite, and our racewalking has come up in leaps in bounds. The spots behind Liu are a bit more open, but a number of Chinese contenders are favourites.\n\nTokyo will be the first test of how it ranks on the world stage, but the wretched heat and humidity will be familiar conditions for Rajasthani Bhawna and UP's Priyanka. I'd consider them quiet contenders to spring a surprise podium, and disrupt China's dominance. The lack of big event experience will be a big hurdle to overcome though.\n\n* **Priyanka Goswami (NR) - PB of 1.28.45 at National Racewalking Championship in 2021** \\- The rising star, 24 months ago, she wasn't quick enough to make the cut, today, she's looking like a possible medal contender. Race conditions make times hard to compare, but with her rising performances, I believe she's a quiet contender for the podium, but lacks the big event experience. If she can holder her nerve, she has a chance to disrupt the Chinese dominance in this event.\n* **Bhawna Jatt - PB of 1.29.54 at the National Open Championships 2020** \\- Just like Priyanka, Bhawna has improved in leaps and bounds, her 2020 PB was over 8 minutes faster than her prior record. Considering how quickly the Indian walking times have improved over the last 2 years, a PB performance puts her at an outside chance in this one. The Tokyo heat should suit our 2 competitors. Just like Priyanka, she lacks big event experience.\n\nWomen's Discuss\n\n***Rio 2016 Podium - Sandra Perkovic (CRO) - 69.21m, Melina Robert-Michon (FRA) - 66.73m, Denia Caballero (CUB) - 65.34m***\n\n***Doha 2019 Podium - Yaime Perez (CUB) - 69.17m, Denia Caballero (CUB) - 68.44m, Sandra Perkovic (CRO) - 66.72m***\n\nSandra Perkovic is the favourite despite her poor showing at Doha, she's got the big stage pedigree, winning Gold at London and Rio. Yaime Perez and Denis Caballero will be looking to add to their tallies.. There is a new challenger in Van Clinken of the Netherlands, who recently threw a 70. Nonetheless, Kamalpreet can sneak a Bronze here, though this will be her first major test under pressure.\n\n* **Kamalpreet Kaur (NR) - PB of 66.59m @ Indian Grand Prix 4 in 2021 -** Kamalpreet is the rising star, her recent rise has put her in the range to sneak a bronze, or even a silver. What counts against Kamalpreet is a lack of big event pedigree. Her PB would have snuck her a bronze in Rio, and just off the podium in Doha. Her rise has been more prolific during COVID-19, and this has left her without a big chance at major event practice or accolades.\n* **Seema Punia - PB of 63.72m @ National Senior Championships in 2021** \\- Seema is the senior of the 2, competing as Seema Antil at the Rio olympics, Punia despite her age (38) is continuing to improve, a medal seems out of reach for her, but she can definitely still make the final round. She has won 3 commonwealth medals silvers, so pressure is no stranger to her.\n\nMen Shotput\n\n***Rio 2019 Podium - Ryan Crouser (USA) - 22.52m (OR), Joe Kovacs (USA) - 21.78m, Tomas Walsh (NZL) - 21.36m***\n\n***Doha 2019 Podium - Joe Kovacs (USA) - 22.91m (CR), Ryan Crouser - 22.9m, Tomas Walsh (NZL) - 22.9m***\n\nThe favourites for this competition are clear. Ryan Crouser has the all time record, breaking 23.37 last month. Joe Kovacs and Tomas Walsh are also favorites for the podium. Shotput like Javelin is all about pressure performances though, and the Silver or Bronze is firmly up for grabs if Toor can keep improving, or if Walsh, Kovacs have a rare slip up. Toor will need to beat his PB to win a medal here in my opinion, but it's possible.\n\n* **Tajinder Pal Toor (Asian Record) - 21.49M @ Indian Grand Prix 4 in 2021 -** The Asian record holder, the mighty Toor continues to improve with every competition. He recently set a new National Record at 21.49m, and another improvement, PB will put him in a tight battle for the 2nd/3rd steps on the podium. He has experience with pressure and won the 2018 Asian Games Gold with a 20.75, he's improved a lot since then though.\n\nMens Javelin\n\n***Rio 2016 Podium - Thomas Rohler (DEU) - 90.30m, Julius Yego (KEN) - 88.24m, Keshorn Walcott (TRD) - 85.38m***\n\n***Doha 2019 Podium - Anderson Peters (GRN) - 86.89m, Magnus Kirt (EST) - 86.21m, Johannes Vetter (DEU) - 85.37***\n\nThe favorite in this event is Johannes Vetter, who has been throwing 90's across many recent events, 18 times in the last 24 months infact, and the only athlete to do so.

Pressure will be high, though he's shown he can deliver under pressure. A point against is he's lacking the ideal preparation due to COVID lockdowns, but his PB has come this year, and should he hit those highs, a Silver is on the menu for him.\n* **Shivpal Singh - PB - 86.23M @ 2019 Asian Championships (Silver)** \\- The quiet dark horse, in a sport filled with stories of pressure getting to athletes, Shivpal's PB is good enough to be in the medal hunt if he can hold his nerve, as he did in the 2019 Asian Championships. He should make the finals at the least.\n\nTLDR: Shotput, Discuss, Javeling, Longjump, Racewalking are the 5 decent events. Though after our shooting collapse, I'm putting plenty of \\* for needing to perform under pressure. In short though, Neeraj isn't our only hope, and I hope people don't just tune in for Neeraj and forget the rest.\n\nHopefully if a couple or even one of them can sneak a podium, it will inspire the youngsters in our nation to take up some athletics too."<br />Author: 'RETAW57'  id: 'otxted'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/otxted/india_tokyo_2020_athletics_competitor_guide_and/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Many people here are convinced that the anti-Indian rhetoric is motivated by racism/white supremacy, however that cannot be further from the truth'<br />Body: 'I was having a convo with a friend today, who\'d brought up this topic and accused WaPo, NYT, Guardian, Vox, HuffPo, etc. of white supremacy. This reminded me of the opinions of some people here, which I think should be cleared up.\n\nThe mainstream media isn\'t railing against India, Modi, BJP due to colonialist mentality. You need to understand that the "white man\'s burden" or "missionary" colonialism is far into the past, now its all about woke mentality. Its true that they see our culture as ass-backward and primitive, but not because they\'re racists. In their eyes, you need to be against it *because* you\'re *anti-racist*. They view the caste system through the lens of racial enslavement, and they see Indian and Hindu culture enabling it scripturally. Secondly, and most obvious, the perceived oppression of Muslims. Islamophobia is definitely attempting to conflate itself as racism, and in the eyes of the Left, we\'re Islamophobes and ergo racists on that count as well. Succinctly put, anti-India/anti-Hindu (these two always overlap, due to the demographic majority of Hindus) hatred is "woke hatred", therefore "okay hatred". Hindus decrying bigotry against them is akin to whites decrying anti-white racism, though both phenomenon are very real. Due to conversations about Islamophobia and evacuating Muslims of criticism, it does not matter to them that Pakistan is a Muslim supremacist theocracy that has normalised hatred against the west, India, Hindus and Gandhi in their history curriculum. The chief antagonist in these books are Hindus, whose "majoritarian oppressive tendencies" justify their hatred of us. It doesn\'t matter that Muslims ruled all of North India before the Brits either. To some of them, the allegation that Pakistan sponsors terrorism is motivated by Indian islamophobia. So any criticism of Pakistan is considered criticism of Muslims and associating with islamophobic India. Dangerously dumb, true, but that\'s the sad reality. Its also the reason why Tulsi Gabbard is accused of allegedly supporting Modi, while Ilhan Omar\'s meetings with Erdogan are "explained away" by the wokes.\n\nSo lets get to the white supremacists, right wing Christians and other conservatives. Do they dislike Modi? A lot of them do, but not with vested interests as some might think. They view Modi as India\'s Erdogan, who is universally hated among the western Right. But because Modi is a Hindu Nationalist, they view him as a useful ally, with discomfort. Because Modi is hated by their enemies, the Big Three: global left, jihadis and the CCP, and because he doesn\'t threaten the west, they\'re ready to work with him. Sometimes, the white nationalists do admire him. For example, Jack Posbiec. Widely considered as an alt-right white nationalist, he is an admirer of Modi. He even tweeted that Modi is someone who protects his people from the global left, and took India\'s side when we were being hounded for the farmers\' protests. This doesn\'t mean they like his ideology, obviously. There are anti-semites among such people as well, nevertheless they admire Israel greatly. They\'re racists, but admire black nationalists in Africa greatly. They (I don\'t think Jack believes this though) want an ethno-state in the US and Europe, where the people in power are all white. They believe that the western civilisation is exclusively white. Just like how the people in power in Africa are all black, and Hindus wrt India. Of course, due to Islamic terrorism and growing Chinese threat, Islamo-fascism and Han Supremacy appeal to them very little. But Modi isn\'t just someone who\'s pro-America/pro-Israel with shared geopolitical interests. He\'s someone who broke the decades old fabian socialist tradition of India. The world\'s largest democracy which was considered a safe zone for liberal socialism just one decade ago, and Modi has caught them pants down. Now an entire 7th of humanity is ruled by right wing nationalists, the shoe\'s on the other foot and they\'ve become India\'s mainstream while the liberals have been relegated to the fringe elements. Its an admiration for someone who "defeated" the global left in his country, and for someone who\'s hated by the Big Three. This is also the case with many right wing Christians. While the perceived persecution of Christians in India does worry them, the aforementioned reasons still outweigh any gripe they may hold against Modi. Many others, of course, don\'t like him at all. Still, its not like they view him as a threat. They may also be anti-semitic, but they view Israel favourably. As for right wing Jews, anyone who supports Israel\'s right to exist is an ally. Regardless of how anti-Netanyahu the current government is and even if the Labor Zionists somehow return to power, they\'re not gonna renegotiate their partnerships with India. But all right wingers are the fringe in the US, ridiculed and hated.\n\nIn conclusion, we\'re the Indian equivalent of white nationalists and that\'s why the MSM is biased against India. In their eyes, the climate in India is akin to the God forbidden white nationalist rule in the US. This should be obvious since they\'re using similar terminology for both groups. When Modi was voted in, they were howling about the far right, radical, Hindu supremacist taking the world\'s largest democracy down the drain. As of 2021, the words "Indian", "Hindu" and "Hindutva" have become synonymous. So its best to know exactly where the "anti-Indian" tribe comes from: the wokes, mostly.'<br />Author: 'Akashi42'  id: 'otry8g'<br />Score:63<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/otry8g/many_people_here_are_convinced_that_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: "'Why Mohan Bhagwat's 'Common DNA' Remark Is More Hindutva Than You Think'"<br />Body: "*by Aravindan Neelakandan*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f6s99macp2e71.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f3765aef467d582864ea9e48d05b18d3b65d57e\n\nMohan Bhagwat, the RSS *Sarsanghachalak,* has been criticised and trolled for saying that Hindus and Muslims of India share the same DNA. Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati, the priest of the Dasna Devi temple in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, even went to the extent of saying that 'perhaps Bhagwat had the DNA of Aurangzeb but ‚Äònot us''.\n\nWhat Dr. Mohan Bhagwat said comes from a position of strength while statements like that of Yati Narsinghanand reveal fear and frustration, despite the veneer of bravado they may exhibit.\n\nGenetic purity, like cultural purity, is a myth. The search for, and attempts to forge, such purities, often result in suicidal movements like the Dravidian movement in Tamil Nadu. This ideology, in its search for 'pure Tamil', actually killed the spirit and genuine flow and growth of the Tamil language.\n\nWe share our DNA with not only fellow religious groups and national groups but with our extinct evolutionary hominid cousins and with Neanderthals too. If the charting of human evolution that has been painstakingly put forth through pieces and fragments of discoveries and DNA analysis is right, and there is no reason to doubt it, then we are all Africans. In fact there is no such thing as 'Indian DNA'.\n\nDr. Bhagwat is right in saying that Muslims and Hindus in India share a common DNA.\n\nThe Muslims of India are mostly converts from Hindu society, for various historical reasons ‚Äì mostly for survival and power. In the modern context though, the reasons stated for conversion include 'Islam being a more egalitarian religion', even though it was as socially non-egalitarian as any other religious-legal system of the pre-modern period.\n\n(The 'egalitarian nature of Islam' like the 'anti-caste character of Buddhism' is a later invention, but some good-hearted Hindu reformers even used that argument to accelerate reforms in Hindu society).\n\nThe point is that most Muslims in India, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh share common ancestry with Hindus rather than with Muslims of Arabia.\n\nStressing the common origin of Muslims and Hindus in India is an important way of reaching out to the Muslims. Hindutva is not an exclusive ideology. It is an inclusive national vision. A Hindutvaite does not want an Indian Muslim to be treated as a second-class citizen. Rather, he sees him as vulnerable to exploitation by forces of monopolistic expansion.\n\nA Hindutvaite wants to impress upon the Muslim Indian that the heritage of India‚Äîspiritual and cultural‚Äîis for his taking, even though he may have deserted it. Shri Rama and Krishna, the Upanishads and the Gita, *bhakti* and yoga are also the heritage of the Muslim Indian.\n\nIndia perhaps has more mystics of Islamic origin than the rest of the Islamic world put together. In the RSS daily morning prayer, Kabir and Ras Khan have been venerated by scores of *swayamsevaks*, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, for decades.\n\nAnd this is not to the usual Sufi-opiate of the Nehruvian variety. There have been aggressively proselytizing Sufis and then there have been ones like Bulleh Shah to whom is attributed the famous verse '*Agar na Hote Guru Gobind Singh Sunnat Hoti Sabki*'. Even in the 20th century, in the face of rising Islamist aggression, we saw Yogi Allah Yar Khan standing against it in an inspiring way.\n\nShirdi Sai Baba is worshipped in many Hindu houses despite a few obscurantist voices protesting the practice in recent times. Hazrat Babajan, a Muslim woman saint, was buried alive by fundamentalists in Afghanistan. She escaped and found asylum in the so-called 'Brahminical' Pune.\n\nBy emphasizing the Indic nature of the ethnic, cultural, and social roots of Muslim Indians, Dr.Bhagwat is calling them (and quite a number of Hindus also) to free themselves from artificial prejudices and limitations imposed by religious doctrines. He is asking them to come together through commonness and not to alienate themselves into ghettos through concessions to fundamentalist leadership of political Islam.\n\n*A call for liberation is not appeasement.*\n\nUnfortunately, a new generation seems to be coming up infected with what can be called the ‚ÄòGoel-Elst‚Äô syndrome. To be clear, this syndrome has nothing much to do with either Sitaram Goel or Koenraad Elst. Both intellectual giants contributed immensely to the awakening of Hindu conscience among Anglophone Hindus, who otherwise would have been consumed by the glitterati of Marxism and Nehruvianism.\n\nThe new keyboard warriors, without the kind of dedication and hard-work that consumed the lives of Goel and Elst, have only imbibed their criticism for the Sangh and transformed that into hatred. And sometimes this hatred even turns towards Dr. Elst, when he states the secular humanist truths which cannot be digested by fundamentalists, irrespective of their variation in DNA - genetic or memetic. Then, Dr. Elst is labelled a 'white racist.'\n\nEven at the height of the Ayodhya movement, the significant contributions of Elst and Goel remained contained within a small group.\n\nToday, we have webinars and courses on Sita Ram Goel and Ram Swarup. This is because the political milieu has changed. That change came from the works of millions of nameless *swayamsevaks*. They slept on railway platforms and bus stands; they cycled through the hot sun and torrents. If fortunate, they got heckled. If not, they got hacked.\n\nAnd yes, in the morning they venerated Kabir and Ras Khan along with Thyagaraja and Basavanna; Ambedkar and Gandhi along with Savarkar and Shivaji.\n\nAnd standing on their sacrifices and the silent tears of their families, we speak of our new found 'trad-wokism' and we damn them as fools.\n\nThe thrill of adrenaline one derives from hatred, however informed that hatred may be, is not the joy of Dharma.\n\nHindu Dharma should be preserved not because it is the oldest; it should be preserved because it contains and nurtures spiritual diversity in all its complexity. All the challenges, as well as possibilities, that come with nurturing that diversity, define Hindutva.\n\nThat is why Dara Shukoh, who definitely shared a lot of DNA with Aurangzeb, is dearer to Hindutva than Mirza Raja, a Hindu who tried to trap Chhatrapati Shivaji for the Mughal tyrant.\n\n\\------------------------\n\nSource: [https://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-mohan-bhagwats-common-dna-remark-is-more-hindutva-than-you-think](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-mohan-bhagwats-common-dna-remark-is-more-hindutva-than-you-think)"<br />Author: 'madeinbharat'  id: 'otps9g'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/otps9g/why_mohan_bhagwats_common_dna_remark_is_more/</li>

The matter is taken to the tribal elders who ask the youth, were you drunk? He says no, and they are all satisfied. The policeman cannot comprehend such a trial where the statements made by the youth are taken at face value. To the elders the policeman's attitude is surprising. What kind of a youth could lie to his elders?\n\nThis was the end of a certain kind of man, today almost everywhere the attitude of suspicion reigns.\n\nManu unlike Adam is not merely an ancestor but a co-traveler, the human archetype for each epoch of time and attitude of mind."<br />Author: 'greasesoda'  id: 'ota1sf'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ota1sf/manu_the_prevailing_attitude_of_mind_to_the_epic/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Scientific Vs Religious theory'<br />Body: 'Hi Guys\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are five properties of any so called "religious" idea. These five properties are as below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(a) These ideas postulate invisible powers and use these powers for their explanation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(b) These explanations acknowledge the dependence of human beings on such powers\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(c) These invisible powers are construed as (unknown) causes\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(d) All these causes are apprehended to be of the same kind ( i.e. causal in nature)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(e) Finally, these causes are modelled after human beings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhereas if we take any scientific theory or any philosophical theory from metaphysical to ontological ones in nature, it is obvious that all have the first four properties too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, any scientific theory postulates invisible powers/forces and its relations, they also make claim that humans are dependent upon them, the idea that they are causal forces and powers, which are of the same kind. Consequently, these four properties, severally or in conjunction,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ndo not help us to say that the ‚Äòreligious‚Äô ideas are , as against ‚Äòscientific‚Äô, ‚Äòproto-scientific‚Äô, or ‚Äòphilosophical‚Äô explanation. Thus, the weight falls entirely on the fifth property.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the fifth property if considered just as a theory ( not a fact) have two facets like any theory i.e. one is procedural activity involved in creating religious explanations and other is substantial feature regarding this theories.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow there are two aspects of procedural activity\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHuman beings provided an explanation or constructed a theory, which involved the activity of creating a model for that explanation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHuman beings made use of analogies in the process of constructing religious explanation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth are unexceptionable points, because neither the activity of drawing analogies nor that of constructing models makes some theory into a religious one. This point is hardly worth belaboring in a period where cognitive science, philosophies and sociologies of science are studying the role of not just models but also of metaphors and analogies in the development and propagation of scientific theories. That leaves us with just one possibility to explore: according to a religious explanation, the causal forces operating in the universe are personalized entities, endowed with intention, ‚Äúthought and reason, and passion‚Äù.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow only option left is ‚Äòanthropomorphising‚Äô on the part of the Early Human. As it is in the best tradition of scientific theorizing and rationality. The reason is obvious: the only thing, about which the Early Man had any knowledge, if he had knowledge at all, was himself. Consequently, when he developed an explanation about another domain, he cast it in terms of the ‚Äòtheory‚Äô he already had. That is to say, he was explaining the unknown in terms of the known. Is this not the activity of scientific theorizing under at least one description? In this sense, how could the emergence and origin of religion exhibit anything but human pride and strength, i.e. human rationality?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the next points which is most important is that the divinity not only assumes a human form but it also regulates the universe according to its\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nplans, intentions, goals and sentiments. This notion of divinity, however, is typical of the Semitic religions but not of Asian traditions: from Hinduism through Buddhism to Shintoism, none of them suggests that the universe is held together by one or even several deities, let alone that their thoughts, reasons and sentiments, regulate and govern the Cosmos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo how would you sperate scientific theory from religious one and if you want to go even deep how you would separate these theories from Asia traditions? ( and please refrain from so called scientific theory of evidence as human mind generally thinks or acts in that pattern just the definition of evidence changes with culture, logic, tradition or perspective of individual).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease respond if possible for positive debate.

      <li>Title::: 'Examination of Monotheism ‚Äì Dharma vs. Religion (Part 4)'<br />Body: '*In this brief excerpt, Sita Ram Goel explains the differences between the Tradition of Advaita and the Tradition of Monotheism. Differences arise when different individuals espouse the opposite traditions of Advaita and Monotheism intellectually and cherish them consciously. Then the tradition of Monotheism gives birth to Aurangzeb, and the tradition of Advaita to Shivaji.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 1igjjrw6zwd71...*\n\n**Firstly, Monotheism presents no proof in support of any of its propositions.** All its arguments are specimens of round-about logic. Existence of the One God is accepted because the prophet testifies to that existence. But the status of the prophet is hailed because he claims that the One God speaks through him.\n\nIf the exponents of Monotheism are asked whether any other person can, by spiritual seeking, attain that state of consciousness by attaining which the prophet had heard the commandments of the One God, they unanimously denounce it as inconceivable. Nor do they concede to any other person the capacity to see the One God directly by any method of spiritual seeking. To meet the One God directly is not possible for any other person before the Day of Judgment. Again, it all depends upon the sweet will of the One God as to when and whom he may send as his prophet.\n\n**In the history of Monotheism, it has happened many a time that persons more than one proclaimed themselves as prophets. Their dispute could be settled only when one of them killed the others or got himself killed.** In this situation, it cannot be decided whether the One God that the prophet has been raving about, has any real existence or not. Nor can it be said that the commandments which the prophet has issued in the name of the One God are not the ravings of his own mind.\n\nIn this context, the tradition of Monotheism is wholly contrary to the tradition of Advaita, which regards direct perception as the only proof, and which gives equal right to all humans to realize the supreme truth directly.\n\n**Secondly, Monotheism recognizes truth not as eternal but as the latest.** The truth that the prophet reveals thorough his sayings and, doings was not known to anyone before his advent. This definition of truth can only be termed as downright ridiculous. And when it is said that truth has become complete after the advent of the Last Prophet and that nothing can be added to or subtracted from it, then this definition contradicts itself. Truth, if it is the latest, cannot be complete till the end of time. And when countless persons born before the Last Prophet or in his time or after him, are pushed into hell simply because they have failed to profess faith in the Last Prophet, then Monotheism has to be termed as vile.\n\nAll these persons could not hear the message of the Last Prophet because either they were born before him or because no mullah or missionary could reach them. How can these persons be blamed for the offence of disregarding the Last Prophet?\n\nIn this context, the tradition of Monotheism is wholly contrary to the tradition of Advaita, which regards truth as eternal and equally accessible to all persons at all times and at all places.\n\n**Thirdly, Monotheism regards truth not as impersonal but as personal.** **The prophet alone is the person who can know or hear the truth. All other persons have to borrow that truth from the prophet and practice it as such.** Consequently, the prophet very soon usurps the place of the One God. Without submission to the prophet, worship of the One God is not possible. N0T can the gates of heaven open without recommendation from the prophet. In this situation, it should not be a matter of surprise if the One God takes leave or is left out. This is the inevitable transformation of Monotheism.\n\nIn this context, the tradition of Monotheism is wholly contrary to the tradition of Advaita, which regards truth as impersonal and admits that (whoever seeks, he finds).\n\n**Fourthly, Monotheism renders the supreme power impotent and the entire Cosmos an extension of matter.** The One God, intoxicated as he was with his omnipotence, did create the universe out of Nothing or the Void, but, for the same reason, he himself remained outside his own creation. He became incapable of establishing contact with his own creatures and, in order to convey his message to human beings created by himself, he had to seek the help of a prophet. To describe such a helpless One God as almighty is ridiculous. This debasement of the One God is surpassed by the debasement of his creation.\n\nAs a consequence of the One God remaining outside, whatever there is in the Cosmos is material and man has unhindered right to use it all. Therefore, with the decline of Christianity in the Western countries, there erupted a volcano of materialism and consumerism. The natural resources began to be ruthlessly exploited. The incurable epidemic of consumerism which is pushing the word towards destruction today, had its seed in the Monotheism of Christianity. Islam followed the same path.\n\nIn this context, the tradition of Monotheism is wholly contrary to the tradition of Advaita, which sees extension of the same divinity in all animate and inanimate beings and imposes limits on consumption.\n\n**Fifthly, the Supreme Being of Monotheism (whether Jehovah or Allah) comes out as a despot who is also an arbitrary, partisan, and jealous gangster.** If the sayings and doings which have been sanctioned in the various scriptures of Monotheism as commandments of the One God, really emanate from that One God, then there remains no scope for doubt that the One God is simply another name for Satan described in those very scriptures. That is why the devotees of the One God invoke him while committing all those atrocities which are described in detail in the history of creeds professing Monotheism.\n\nIn this context, the tradition of Monotheism is wholly contrary to the tradition of Advaita, which regards the Supreme Being as Sacchidananda ‚Äì Truth, Consciousness and Bliss, the savior of the virtuous and the purifier of the sinful.\n\n**Sixthly, by dividing human history into two periods and the human race into two mutually hostile groups, Monotheism gives to one group the right to destroy, without any compunction, the cultural wealth of the other group, slaughter that group mercilessly, grab its properties, and bind it into bonds of slavery.** In fact, the ideology of Monotheism is replete with an unquenchable barbarism the explosion of which has been witnessed time and again, and in consequence of which the progress of, human civilization and culture has been greatly impeded.\n\nMonotheism rationalizes the animal drives present in human nature. It is not an accident that whenever and wherever Monotheism has held sway, then and there an unbridled devil dance of evil has been enacted. The story of crimes committed under the auspices of Monotheism is exceedingly long.\n\nIn this context, the tradition of Monotheism is wholly contrary to the tradition of Advaita, which protects the precious cultural wealth accumulated in the course of time, and promotes the attitude of *vasudhaiva kutumbakam* (the whole world is one fraternity).\n\n**Lastly, it has to be said that Monotheism, by smothering diversity in belief and behaviour of people, fosters uniformity.** To describe this uniformity as universality, is the dreadful mistake that every kind of Monotheism has committed. Monotheism fails to understand that there are many regions, many countries, many races, and countless human beings with different natures and temperaments. It prescribes a uniform pattern of belief and behaviour for all countries, for all times, for all races, and for all persons.\n\nMonotheism fails to see whether all men are capable of living up to that pattern of belief and behaviour, or not. Moreover, for practicing that uniform pattern, man has got only one life. If in that one life a man fails to live up to that pattern, then he is consigned to an everlasting hell. Monotheism has not given any opportunity to anyone to rectify one‚Äôs mistake.\n\nIn this context, the tradition of Monotheism is wholly contrary to the tradition of Advaita, which provides for diversity of belief and behaviour in accordance with the stage of a man‚Äôs spiritual development and aptitude and which, affirming that each man is a bodhisattva, gives an opportunity to him for spiritual seeking through a cycle of rebirths.\n\n**The Tradition of Advaita**\n\nIn brief, the tradition of Advaita regards direct perception as the only proof of its propositions, whether that direct perception be through the senses or extra-sensory. The tradition of Advaita regards truth as eternal and impersonal, and grants to everyone the right to approach truth direct. This tradition sees the Supreme Truth manifest in many forms outside as well as inside the Cosmos, provides for different ways of worship, holds behavior superior to belief, denounces use of force for spreading of faith, does not rationalize any animal drive present in human nature, promotes many cultures in accordance with time and place, and repudiates all kinds of imperialism.\n\n**The Tradition of Monotheism**\n\nOn the other hand, the tradition of the Monotheism is not based on any kind of positive proof, regards truth as new and personal, describes its One God as unique and outside the Cosmos, provides for only one pattern of belief and behavior by presenting the Last Prophet as the ideal person, holds belief superior to behavior, gives validity to use of force for spreading the faith, rationalizes all kinds of animal drives present in human nature, and encourages imperialistic ambitions.\n\n**In the end, one clarification is desirable. The above analysis of Advaita and Monotheism is wholly right at the level of ideas. But this analysis cannot be applied mechanically to all persons born and brought up in these opposite traditions.** The head and heart of a person can be larger or smaller than any thought pattern. Unless a person brought up and bred in any tradition accepts that tradition consciously and begins to imbibe and promote it, the tradition does not become manifest in his life. It is not enough to merely mouth support for any pattern of belief and behavior.\n\n**Therefore, ordinary men born and brought up in both the traditions are found to be of good as well as bad behavior. Differences arise when different individuals espouse the opposite traditions of Advaita and Monotheism intellectually and cherish them consciously. Then the tradition of Monotheism gives birth to Aurangzeb, and the tradition of Advaita to Shivaji.**\n\n\\----------------------------------\n\nSource: [https://cisindus.org/2020/01/20/examination-of-monotheism-dvr-4/](https://cisindus.org/2020/01/20/examination-of-monotheism-dvr-4/)'<br />Author: 'madeinbharat'  id: 'ot5r76'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ot5r76/examination_of_monotheism_dharma_vs_religion_part/</li>

      <li>Title::: "The Sepoy of Awadh in the Bengal Army, his experiences, recruitment and role in the Rebellion of 1857 and it's aftermath."<br />Body: 'BACKGROUND \n\n\nThe Armies of the English East India Company were the precursor to the British Indian Army, which was itself the precursor to the Army of Independent India. The armies of the EEIC were divided into three Presidential Armies, these were the Bengal, Madras and Bombay Presidencies. These Presidencies themselves were the result of the establishment and expansion of "factories" (which were fortified settlements within which English traders stored their goods and used them as a selling station) by the EEIC between 1612 to 1757. These were established by acquisition of *firmans* which means edicts or grants from local rulers such as the Mughal Emperors, Mughal Governors or Marathas. By the middle of the 18th century, three factory towns, namely Madras, Bombay and Calcutta came into prominence as they grew in size and strength.\n\nEventually, the EEIC, began acquiring land and power in and around these fortified settlements, via a policy of supporting competing Indian princes in their wars for acquiring power. This was the experience of the Carnatic wars. The EEIC adopted a policy of helping native Nawabs and princes acquire power and promised to keep them secure while in return the Nawabs and princes gave them trade concessions. The EEIC also waged war against other companies and by 1757, had managed to kick out most of their competition. However, the watershed moment for the EEIC would come after their victory at the Battle of Plassey which assured them territorial rights in the Bengal province of the Mughal Empire. The conflict was the result of an Imperial Mughal *firman* being granted to the EEIC by then Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar, in 1717 giving the British East India Company the right to reside and trade in the Mughal Empire.  They were allowed to trade freely, except for a yearly payment of 3,000 rupees. The company was given the right to issue dastak (passes) for the movement of goods, which was misused by company officials for personal gain. The transgressions of the company brought them into conflict with the Nawabs of Bengal, and the defeat of the Nawab at Plassey allowed the British to place their own candidate on the Throne, to acquire all the land within the Maratha Ditch and 600 yards (550 m) beyond it and the zamindari of all the land between Calcutta and the sea.\n\n\nRECRUITMENT \n\n\nNow, we return to the Indian sepoy. The British had begun employing Indian sepoys to protect their "factories" as early as 1612 itself when the very first factories were established. However, initially these men served as watchmen and guards, with the passage of time, their function and proportion as part of the armed forces of the Presidencies grew significantly. By 1824, the size of the combined armies of Bengal, Madras, and Bombay was about 200,000 and had at least 170 sepoy and 16 European regiments. In 1844, the combined average strength of the three armies was 235,446 native and 14,584 European. For purposes of simplification, we shall take the example of the Bengal Presidency. The English shared the opinion that was common in India since the ancient period, that there were certain "races" best suited for the purpose of war. These races had a "mercenary spirit, were of good stature and complexion, were drawn from the yeoman or land owning peasantry and were suitable for the style of warfare practiced in the Early Modern period". This led to these races being labelled as "martial races". Not surprisingly, these were the same "races" that had since the ancient and medieval period held the privilege to rule or to hold beaurocratic or military positions. Such as Brahmins, Rajputs, Muslims (Afghans, Iranians, Turks,), Khatris eventually Sikhs. \n\nHence, the sepoys of the Bengal Presidency, were in fact not recruited from the Provinces of Bengal or Bihar or Odissa. The British felt that the Bengalis were best suited for clerical work and that the South Indians were smaller in stature and lacked the physical robustness they wanted in their soldiers. Therefore, the entirety of the soldiers of the Bengal Presidency were drawn from the Kingdom of Oudh, which was an ally of the British ever since their Nawab was defeated by the Company at the Battle of Buxar and signed the Allahabad Treaty.\n\nThe soldiers that were recruited were mostly drawn from the Brahmin and Rajput castes of Oudh commonly known as Purbiyas. The term Purbiya originated in medieval India. It was used as a term to refer to mercenaries belonging to the Brahmin or Rajput caste from Oudh and Western Bihar. Throughout the medieval and early modern period, these were the preferred mercenaries highered, by mansabdars, Wazirs, Rajas and Mughal Emperors.\n\nThe process of recruitment was quite informal. For example, men who sought mercenary work were easy to find, usually the infantry of the native armies received little attention and soldiers could be convinced by promise of better prospects to join the army. In addition to this, the old feudal networks of recruitment were utilised as well, meaning "zamindars" (hereditary rulers of enormous tracts of land and the peasants who enjoyed land rights within their jurisdiction, from whom they reserved the right to collect tax on behalf of imperial courts or for military purposes) as well as serving officers and soldiers were required to encourage enlistment in the army among their estates, their family and close friends. To give you a perspective, **by the early 19th century, this informal system of recruitment had become so well entrenched that the Brahmins of Oudh dominated the Bengal Presidential Army and represented roughly 40% of it\'s total strength.**\n\n\nMOTIVATIONS\n\n\nAs far as their motivations are concerned, the common peasant of this period usually did not posses a sense of nationalism or nationhood. War was ever present and Nawabs/Rajas and dynasties were overthrown quite often. Usually men enlisted in the army either because they were Brahmins and Rajputs and belonged to a long line of soldiers and military adventures, hence tradition. Or because they were land owning Brahmins or Rajputs who required additional income and were looking for livelihood. The taxation under the Mughal Empire used to vary but usually remained at around 20-25% of the total value of the produce from land cultivated. With the advent of the EEIC and their expansion, more and more areas were subjected to the practice of revenue farming in the North starting with Bengal, which raised tax rates to a crushing level, much has been said of the condition of the farmers in the Bengal region. And while the conditions of primary zamindars (farmers who held land as patrimony) was better in Oudh under the rule of their own sovereign, the King of Oudh, it gradually got worse owing to the heavy payments the King of Oudh had to pay to the British. To give you a perspective on this here\'s some background :\n\nThis particular time period starting from late 18th century, saw the expenses of Oudh sky rocketing owing to the fact that the army was growing and had to grow given the threat of the Sikhs and Afghans in the west.\nPlus, the Marathas were still an ever present nuisance, that could at any moment raid the border Provinces and cause loss of life, wealth and create chaos.\n\nThe Nawab\'s army under Shuja-ud-Daulah (the 3rd Nawab of Awadh), was a formidable force. Boasting roughly 50,000 men, most of them Purbiyas. This was further augmented with a force of Qizilbash horsemen, a remnant of the Nadir Shah episode, during which the founder of the dynasty of Oudh, Saadat Ali Khan and his successor, Safdar Jung made sure to remind the Persian conqueror and his forces of the fact that they are tied to Awadh and their roots lie in Nishapur, hence any Qizilbash horsemen who wanted to seek their fortunes in India, joined the Nawab\'s army.\n\nSadly for Asaf-ud-Daulah, the son of Shuja-ud-Daulah, the British had gained a firm foot in Bengal. They had defeated the Nawabi army at Buxar. And hence, the British resident at the Awadhi court required the Nawab to maintain a force of Englishmen within his territory, **at the Nawab\'s expense**. And make no mistake, these soldiers were expensive. To give you an idea, the Subsidiary forces in Oudh, in 1797, amounted to :\n\n1 Regiment of European Infantry rank and file (950 men)\n\n5 Companies of European artillery (332 men)\n\n14 companies of lascars (1032 men)\n\n2 Regiments of Native Infantry (924 men) \n\n2 Regiments of Native Cavalry (6800 men) \n\nThe Hindustani Regiment of Cavalry (367 men)\n\nThe 27th Regiment of Dragoons at Cawnpore or Kanpur (353 men)\n\nA total of 10,741 men.\n\nThese men, along with the native forces of Oudh itself, amounted to an expense of Rs. 75,00,000 give or take. Keep in mind, the total revenues of Oudh were estimated to be Rs. 2,37,98,557 in 1797 and the yearly expenditure was estimated to be around Rs. 2,36,82,895 meaning that the government often ran into deficit, given the pay for its armies, it\'s subsidiary armies, it\'s resident, its ministers, it\'s beaurocracy and the Nawab\'s private expenses.\n\nHence, the added pressure on the farmers of Oudh was not so much owing to maladministration (and it wasn\'t as if there was none of it) but more due to the growing burden of expenditure and payments to the British. \n\n\nEXPERIENCE BEFORE 1857 \n\n\nNow to discuss the experience that these soldiers went through. It should be no surprise, that despite being as able and as formidable as their European counterparts, the native soldier was paid less than his European counterpart, had very limited chances for promotion beyond the post of "subedar" or sergeant. Was required to take care of the manual duties of his European counterparts, such as carrying supplies, setting up tents etc. The campaigns were hard and the wars were constant. The Anglo Mysore wars of which there were 4, the Anglo-Maratha Wars of which there were 3, The first and Second Anglo-Sikh wars, the Anglo-Afghan wars and so on. The equipment of the native soldier was often comprised on. In any conflict, the death toll of the native soldier was always higher. Yet, there were a few bright spots for the soldier\'s life. Military service brought social recognition, the word of a subedar in the army, meant that his relative, for example his nephew who found himself facing a sentence at the local court could be spared on the promise that he would join the army. A steady flow of income was at least guaranteed and there was, until the early 19th century a feeling of camaraderie among the European officers and their native sepoys, since these officers felt that the well being of the sepoys was their responsibility.\n\nBut this wouldn\'t always be true and eventually, the older officer corps was replaced with a new batch of officers who saw India as the land of opportunity and plunder and cared less for their unit and native sepoys and more for acquisition of wealth to take back to England. The situation was also worsened by the fact that these new officers didn\'t have the same cultural sensitivity toward the sepoys as the older corps. They were very much products of their time, which meant that even though the native sepoys were just as capable and effective as them in combat, their European counterparts looked upon them as inferior, in racial and cultural terms. Needless to say, this atmosphere of racism only further charged the already tense atmosphere surrounding the period between 1856-1857. Not to mention such sentiments were only further aggravated and entrenched during and after the Rebellion, owing to the tone and language of reporting of the situation in Britain by local newspapers and the depiction of the events by contemporary writers. Such sentiments carried through to the World Wars themselves. \n\nNow, the Rebellion of 1857, did change a lot for these soldiers. Let\'s look at why the rebellion happened, who rebelled and what consequences they suffered as a result.\n\n\nMOTIVATIONS FOR THE REBELLION \n\n\nThe Rebellion of 1857, was started due to and was the result of in large part the discontent of the native sepoys of the Bengal Presidential Army. These aforementioned injustices that the sepoys went through only further strained the relationship they had with their employers, especially after the company usurped Oudh from its Nawab on false ground of maladministration and imposed heavy tax farming revenues obligations on its zamindari/taluqadari class. This imposition of a heavy tax burden meant that the rural peasantry of Oudh, the very peasantry which supplied the Bengal Army with it\'s native sepoys had become more and more hostile towards it. The discontent of the farmers and families of the sepoys would naturally find its way into the general perception and feeling the sepoys had towards the Company. Hence, due to its polices the Company had turned the sepoys of Oudh, it\'s peasantry and its lower nobility against itself. Meanwhile, thanks to the Company\'s policy of aggressive expansion, the Company had made enemies of many prominent noble houses in North India, including, The Nawabs of Awadh, the Kingdom of Jhansi, the successor of the Peshwa of the Maratha Empire at Kanpur and many smaller noble houses as well.\n\nThe discontent of the Oudh sepoys were manifold. Apart from the aforementioned concerns the sepoys also felt cheated when they were denied the "bhatta" or bonus for foreign service. Since, after the annexation of Punjab, Awadh and most of North India these regions weren\'t considered "foreign". The Oudh sepoys of the Bengal Presidency were also incredibly strict regarding their caste and religious practices. Crossing the Indus was considered to result in a loss of caste. Consumption of pig and cow meat was forbidden for the Muslim and Brahmin and Rajput members of the Bengal army. The Brahmins were roughly 40%, the Rajputs were around 20% as well as Ahirs and Muslims. This meant that the Bengal Army was also a lot less diverse compared to the armies of Bombay or Madras. The fact that the British organised their armies into homogenous single battalion regiments drawn from one caste, also added to the large support base that the resentments found among the Bengal Army and the ease with which sepoys could organise and prepare themselves for action. \n\nTherefore, there existed a powder keg, of resentment against the Company which the Company lit itself by introducing the "match" which was the Pattern 1853, Enfield, rifled musket. To load the new rifle, soldiers had to bite a cartridge open and pour the gunpowder it contained into the rifle\'s muzzle, then stuff the paper cartridge (overlaid with a thin mixture of beeswax and mutton tallow for waterproofing) into the musket as wadding, the ball being secured to the top of the cartridge and guided into place for ramming down the muzzle.\n\nMany sepoys believed that the cartridges that were standard issue with the new rifle were greased with lard (pork fat) which was regarded as unclean by Muslims and tallow (cow fat) which angered the Hindus. The sepoys\' British officers dismissed these claims as rumors, and suggested that the sepoys make a batch of fresh cartridges, and greased these with pig and cow fat. This reinforced the belief that the original issue cartridges were indeed greased with lard and tallow.\n\nOn the 29th of March, 1857, a Brahmin sepoy named Mangal Pandey, attacked his British officers and his capture and subsequent hanging marked the beginning of the revolt.\n\n\nAFTERMATH OF THE REBELLION AND CONSEQUENCES FOR THE SEPOY \n\n\nOnce the revolt was suppressed, those noble houses that had participated in it with the sepoys were either extinguished or fled into exile. The sepoys themselves were either killed in action or sentenced to be shot by a cannon. Among the groups that were recruited into the Bengal Army, the Brahmins of Oudh payed the heaviest price for this revolt, as the perception among the British was that the Brahmins being the highest in the social ladder had invoked religious fervour among the Rajputs and were the primary cause for strict caste and religious practices prevalent in the Bengal Army. Hence, in subsequent years, once the British Crown assumed full ownership and control of the Company\'s property and armies, the recruitment policy of the army was changed. The percentage of Brahmins fell from 40% to around 8-12% until the World Wars.\n\nOverall, the perception of the Oudh sepoy, who was until the mutiny, considered an invincible conqueror of the Sikhs, the Marathas, Mysore, Nepal and Afghans changed and he was now seen as an inferior in military affairs when compared to the loyal Sikhs of the Punjab, and the Rajputs of the Rajputana or the Marathas and the Southerners who had remained loyal and had not joined the revolt.\n\n\nSources :\n\n"The Hybrid Military Establishment of the East India Company in South Asia: 1750‚Äì1849" by Kaushik Roy\n\n"Military Synthesis in South Asia: Armies, Warfare, and Indian Society, c. 1740--1849" by Kaushik Roy\n\n"The Martial Races of India" by Lt.

RSF itself receives funding from the US Government.\n\n&gt;Another donor of FS is Limelight Foundation (LF). The LF funds numerous organisations. One of the prominent among them is Bellingcat, a media initiative that produces propaganda that seeks to legitimize the West‚Äôs illegal war against Syria.\n\n&gt;Bellingcat has extensive ties to NATO, as reported by The Grayzone, and has cooperated with United Kingdom‚Äôs efforts to ‚Äúweaken Russia‚Äù. In addition, it also receives grants from the National Endowment for Democracy, which in turn is a US Government funded project.\n\n&gt;Omidyar channels its donations to FS via Luminate which is a bigger umbrella of NGO funding for furthering US strategic goals than even OSF of Soros. For example: Luminate donated to the Sundance Institute for producing films ‚Äúused strategically to articulate pressing public issues and movement-building campaigns.‚Äù The Grayzone report states, ‚ÄúAmong the films cited by Omidyar‚Äôs Luminate as a strategic success was The Last Men in Aleppo, an Oscar-nominated propaganda vehicle for the Syrian White Helmets that was produced by the Sundance Institute.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe White Helmets are a Syrian insurgent-aligned ‚Äúcivil rescue‚Äù group founded in Turkey by a British former military intelligence officer.

It eluciates how from the era of 1930s, how US came to be a nation whose policies, particularly foreign policies, were determined by the plutocrats, for the plutocrats. And the means of determination would come to be the plutocratic &amp; corporate funds featuring swivelling doors with CIA with CIA donating its officials for these megafunds and the megafunds donating money and a respectable, non-hostile channel for achieving CIA\'s foreign policy objectives.*\n\nIn words of the most acclaimed book globally on ColdWar "Cultural Cold War":\n\n&gt;The use of philanthropic foundations was the most convenient way to pass large sums of money to Agency projects without alerting the recipients to their source. 1952 Congress committee appointed to investigate US foundations concluded that ‚ÄòAn unparalleled amount of power is concentrated increasingly in the hands of an interlocking and self-perpetuating group. Unlike the power of corporate management, it is unchecked by stockholders; unlike the power of government, it is unchecked by the people; unlike the power of the churches, it is unchecked by any firmly established canons of value.‚Äô\n\n&gt;**‚ÄòBona fide‚Äô foundations such as Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie were considered ‚Äòthe best and most plausible kind of funding cover‚Äô. A CIA study of 1966 argued that this technique was ‚Äòparticularly effective for democratically run membership organizations,** which need to assure their own unwitting members and collaborators, as well as their hostile critics, that they have genuine, respectable, private sources of income‚Äô. Certainly, it allowed the CIA to fund ‚Äòa seemingly limitless range of covert action programs affecting youth groups, labor unions, universities, publishing houses, and other private institutions‚Äô from the early 1950s.\n\n&gt;The system of private patronage was the pre-eminent model of how small, homogenous groups came to defend America‚Äôs ‚Äì and, by definition, their own ‚Äìinterests. Serving at the top of the pile was every self-respecting WASP‚Äôs ambition.

      <li>Title::: '[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Flooding in China, Russia warns Britain, and Operation Wrath of God'<br />Body: ' Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Geopolitics Thread, the place where we discuss events from all over the world. News and discussion do not have to be related to India. Please share interesting stories and your thoughts in the comments. Here are a few to get the discussion started: \n\n# Top Stories\n\n1. [Flooding in central China leads to deaths](https://www.euronews.com/2021/07/21/flooding-in-central-china-turns-streets-to-rivers-kills-12)\n\nThe Chinese province of Henan witnessed record-breaking rainfall and flooding, with the city of  Zhengzhou recording 20 cm of rain in an hour, essentially the amount of rain it usually gets in a year. The resultant flooding saw an underground metro station flooded, with rescue teams having to cut open stranded trains to evacuate people. A nearby dam also had be destroyed in a controlled manner to avoid catastrophic failure from the heavy rains. At least 25 people have been killed so far, but the number is expected to rise.\n\n2. [Protests against lockdowns reported in Australia](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/24/1020158692/australia-covid-lockdown-protests-sydney-arrests-coronavirus)\n\nProtesters in Sydney and other Australian cities marched maskless to protest against continuing lockdowns and business closures over the coronavirus pandemic. Protesters chanted slogans and raised signs with the words "freedom" and "truth". It\'s not clear how many of them were simply dismissing the severity of the pandemic and how many were just tired by over a year of lockdowns. Several arrests were made after crowds started throwing projectiles at police. Australia has fully vaccinated about 15.6% of its 16+ population, administering about 1 million doses a week. \n\n3. [First direct flight between Israel and Morocco launched](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-airlines-launch-direct-route-to-moroccos-marrakesh/)\n\nIsraeli carriers Israir and El Al launched direct flight between Israel and the historic Moroccan city of  Marrakesh, eight months after the two countries normalized ties with each other in a US-brokered deal. The deal was in exchange for the US recognizing Morocco\'s sovereignty over the Western Sahara territory, although most of the world still considers it to be an occupied territory. Morocco hosts North Africa\'s largest Jewish population at about 3,000, with over 700,000 Moroccan Jews living in Israel as well. \n\n4. [Pride marches in Budapest to oppose anti-LGBT laws](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2021/07/24/budapest-hungary-pride-parade-oppose-lgbt-law-draws-thousands/8083424002/)\n\nOrganizers of Budapest\'s annual Pride parade focused their attention this year on laws recently passed by Viktor Orban\'s government. The laws forbid teaching or exposing minors to any information related to LGBT people and what\'s more, are part of a larger bill related to pedophilia. The law is widely believed to be a way for Orban to win the support of Christian conservatives for next year\'s elections. The European Union has launched an investigation of the laws, with the EU Commissioner going as far as warning Hungary that it would have to leave the EU if it retained the law. \n\n5. [Putin reviews Russian fleet, warns of missile strikes](https://indianexpress.com/article/world/putin-warns-of-unpreventable-strikes-by-russian-navy-7421912/)\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin reviewed naval warships in St Petersburg, where he warned that the Russian Navy was prepared to carry out "unpreventable strikes" from the seas if any country threatened it. The warning is believed to be targets towards Britain, which in June had sent a warship, HMS *Defender*, into waters around Crimea, the territory that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. It is also an allusion to the new Zircon hypersonic missiles that Russia inducted, widely believed to be the most advanced missiles in the world today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: Wrath of God\n\nThe Olympics started on Friday, a celebration of sport and peaceful competition between countries. One of the highlights of the Olympics is the participation of countries that diplomatically may have icy relations with each other, to show that sports can rise above politics. Of course, not all countries or organizations agree with that assessment. The 1972 Summer Olympics were held in Munich, which was then part of West Germany. The Black September faction of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), with help from West German neo-Nazi groups, took 6 coaches and 5 athletes of the visiting Israeli contingent hostage and eventually killed them. The terrorist attack led to widespread international condemnation, with ceremonies to mark the massacre being conducted at both the 2016 Rio Olympics as well as at the opening ceremony of the 2020 (2021) Tokyo Olympics. \n\nBut while Jordan was the only Arab country to condemn the attack, and the US chose to take its case to the UN, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, often nicknamed the Iron Lady of Israel, had more direct actions in mind. Although Israel retaliated swiftly by bombing PLO camps in Syria and Lebanon, Meir felt that a stronger response was necessary - a dramatic and public assassination of every member of Black September that had carried out the massacre at Munich. While several members has been killed during the failed rescue operation, three had survived and has been imprisoned by West German authorities, but were then released after the PLO hijacked Lufthansa Flight 615 to force West Germany\'s hands. Israel\'s intelligence agency, Mossad, was tasked with the operation, whose aim was not just to kill the terrorists and their handlers, but make the PLO itself fearful of any future attacks. To make them fear, as the operation was named, the wrath of God. \n\nThe operations lasted from 1972 to 1988, showing just how long Israeli memory of the massacre of its people lasts. The first set of assassinations happened in Europe, specifically in Rome, Paris, and Cyprus. Four PLO operatives were bombed in their rooms or killed through gunfire - very public events that led to a lot of media coverage but never any definitive evidence that could be used in court. The next set of operations targeted high level PLO officials living in heavily-guarded complexes in Lebanon. These were more complicated, and involved Israeli military commandos working with Mossad operatives. The commandos secretly landed in Lebanon by boat, hid as civilians, and stormed the complex to kill three top PLO members as well as close to 100 other members, who died in gunfire - it was not a quiet operation by any means. Most dramatically, the leader of the PLO, Yasser Arafat, lived in the same complex although he was safe. Over the next 10 years, at least 10 other PLO members in Europe were killed using everything from car bombs to silent guns killing them on the streets. \n\nOne of the biggest targets in Wrath of God was Ali Hassan Salameh, nicknamed the Red Prince, who was thought to be the mastermind behind the Munich massacre. This proved significantly harder, as Salameh seemed to have left a lot of decoys but could not be actually found. Several very public botched attempts in Europe, including Norway, led to the death of innocent civilians, and international pressure forced Golda Meir to suspend operations. It was only after a new Prime Minister Menachem Begin was elected, did Mossad restart. Having taken a break, Mossad was able to start afresh and located Salameh much closer to home - in Lebanon. In the fifth attempt, they killed him by detonating a heavily bomb-filled Volkswagen just as he and his security team were driving past it. Lebanese officials launched a hunt to capture the Mossad agents responsible, but they had already fled the country by then.\n\nWrath of God is also believed to have consisted of other methods that did not lead to assassinations. For example, PLO leaders would be sent letter bombs that would injure, but not kill, them. Their personal details would be leaked (this at a time when people did not readily put it up on social media). Living militants would wake up one day to see their obituary in the newspaper, making them walk the streets in fear of being killed by Mossad. Arab countries were outraged and some began putting pressure on the PLO to stop their terrorist activities, lest Mossad should land up at the doors of their officials too. The PLO attempted a revenge campaign, including a failed assassination of Golda Meir in Rome. However, it did not work - ultimately, many have argued, Wrath of God ended Palestinian terrorism against Israeli civilians, but made Israel an even greater pariah state in the region as well as in Europe. Was that a price worth paying for the Jewish people who lived as pariahs all over Europe for 2,000 years? You decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What stories caught your attention?

      <li>Title::: 'Niyogi Commission Report on Christian Missionary Activities by MP Government in 1956 to gauge the method &amp; impact of missionaries in India, Attempt of MIssionaries to Alienate the Indian Christian Community from their Nation, Churches of India functioning as arms of foreign powers'<br />Body: 'On consideration of the material before us we arrive at the following conclusions of fact:-\n\n1. Since the Constitution of India came into force there has been an appreciable increase in the American personnel of the Missionary organisations operating in India. This increase is obviously due to the deliberate policy of the International Missionary Council to send evangelistic teams to areas of special opportunities opened to the Gospel by the Constitutional provision of religions freedom in some of the newly independent nations, equipped with new resources for mass evangelism through the press, film, radio and television. (Pages 27 and 31 of the Missionary Obligation of the Church, 1952).\n\n2. Enormous sums of foreign money flow into the country for Missionary work, comprising educational, medical and evangelist activities. It was out of such funds received from abroad that in Surguja the Lutherans and other proselytizing agencies were able to secure nearly 4,000 converts.\n\n3. Conversions are mostly brought about by undue influence, misrepresentation, etc., or in other words not by conviction but by various inducements offered for proselytization in various forms.  Educational facilities such as free gifts of books and education are offered to secure the conversion of minors in the primary and secondary schools under the control of the Missions.  Moneylending is one of the various forms adopted as a mild form of pressure to induce proselytization.  This is found very prominently in the case of Roman Catholic Missions operating in the hill tracts of Surguja, Raigarh, Mandla, etc. Cases where coercion was reported to have been used are generally of those converts who wish other members of the family to join their Christian parents or to secure girls in marriage.\n\n4. Missions are in some places used to serve extra religious ends.  In spite of assurances given by foreign and national Missionaries to authorities, instances of indirect political activities were brought to the notice of the Committee.\n\n5. As conversion muddles the converts sense of unity and solidarity with his society, there is a danger of his loyalty to his country and State being undermined.\n\n6. A vile propaganda against the religion of the majority community is being systematically and deliberately carried on so as to create an apprehension of breach of public peace.\n\n7. Evangelization in India appears to be a part of the uniform world policy to revive Christendom for re-establishing Western supremacy and is not prompted by spiritual motives.  The objective is apparently to create Christian minority pockets with a view to disrupt the solidarity of the non-Christian societies, and the mass conversions of a considerable section of Adivasis with this ulterior motive is fraught with danger to the security of the State.\n\n8. Schools, hospitals and orphanages are used as a means to facilitate proselytization.\n\n9. Tribals and Harijans are the special targets of aggressive evangelization for the reason that there is no adequate provision of hospitals, schools, orphanages and other social welfare services in the scheduled or specified areas.\n\n10. The Government of Madhya Pradesh, have throughout followed a policy of absolute neutrality and non-interference in matters concerning religion and allegations of discrimination against Christians and harassment of them by Government officials have not been established.  Such allegations have been part of the old established policy of the Missions to overawe local authority and to carry on propaganda in foreign countries.\n \n\nCHAPTER II.- RECOMMENDATIONS, WITH REASONS\n\nOn the conclusions of facts reached by us we now proceed to deal with certain important considerations which arise out of them ÔøΩon a review of the question from historical and other points of viewÔøΩ, as a prelude to the framing of our recommendations.\nAvenue of approach to the problem\n\n4. Now that India is independent, the question is as to the point of view from which the problem before us should be examined. We think that the spirit which animated the representatives of the various communities in India, including the Christians who participated in the deliberations of the Constituent Assembly affords us the best guide.  Laying aside all their differences based upon the dogmas of their respective religions, they approached the national problems from a purely, rational point of view, and arrived at the unanimous conclusion that the national State of India should be a secular and a welfare State.  The basis of the Constitution of India is, thus, Reason, not Faith; and it is from the point of view of Reason that we propose to approach the problem for a satisfactory solution.\n\nWhat is a Secular State?\n\n5. What is a Secular State? In negative terms, we may say that it is one that is not a Theocratic State, viz., a state in which the Government is believed to be under the immediate direction of God and in which religion and politics are inextricably interwoven.  In a Secular State, one may broadly say that there is no recognition of Dogma, everything that comes before the Government concerning the temporal interests of the citizens is open to full and free discussion.  It does not mean, as is generally supposed, that the State is against any or all religions, or that it overlooks moral values.  The Articles in the Constitution of India, which relate to a Secular State, are 25 to 29.  According to Article 25, all persons are equally entitled to freedom of Conscience, and the right freely to profess, practise and propagate religion, subject to public order, morality and health.  There can be a dispute only on the point of the interpretation of the expression ÔøΩpropagate any religionÔøΩ.\n\nSuffice it to say here that the State will not allow its citizens to do whatever they please in the name and under the guise of religion.  Article 25 itself specifies the limits within which religious freedom can be exercised.\n\nPast history of persecution in the name of religion\n\n6. The idea of a secular State emerged after centuries of experience in human history.  While our Constitution was founded on the liberal principles evolved in Europe, it was not blind to the red signal of the history of Christian countries in which indescribable acts of cruelty were perpetrated in the name of religion.  It has been recently calculated that the number of men who lost their lives in the Papal persecutions of heretics, the Inquisition, the Christian religious wars, etc., is much more than 10,000,000 (page 293, The Riddle of the Universe, Sixth Impression, 1950, ThinkersÔøΩ Library).  They could be justified only in the words of Shelley: ÔøΩthe word of God has fenced about all crimes with Holiness The American Constitution, which was the first in modern times to create a secular State, had to take into account the previous blood-stained history of the Christian Church. Jefferson, who drafted the Declaration of Independence of the U.S.A., set his face firmly against persecution and compulsion in the sphere of religion. ÔøΩIs uniformity attainable?ÔøΩ, he asked, ÔøΩMillions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, imprisoned; yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half of the world fools and the other half hypocrites.ÔøΩ (Page 19 The American Ideal by A. Bryant).  Jefferson was Vice-President once and President twice of the U.S.A. and declined that office the third time.  The principle which he followed in the matter of religion is the one which underlies the Constitution of India. ÔøΩAs to myselfÔøΩ, he said, ÔøΩmy religious reading has long been confined to the moral branch of religion which is the same in all religions; while in that branch which consists of dogmas all differ, all have a different set.  The former instructs us how to live well and worthily in society; the latter are made to interest our mind in the support of the teacher who inculcates them. Hence for one sermon on a moral subject, you hear ten on the dogmas of the sect.ÔøΩ (Pages 88, 89, Jefferson, Living Thoughts Library presented by John Dewey).\nSecular State does not imply Abandonment of Religion\n\n7. Thus, our Constitution has, in principle, followed the American model.  In America, although the national policy affecting religion involved a separation of State from Church, she did not cease to be Christian.  The American principle of religious liberty expressed very tersely is this: That the State should not forbid its citizens to do what their religion requires, not require them to do what their religion forbids. The principle assumes of course that what a citizenÔøΩs religion forbids or requires does not involve the violation of the fundamental human rights of those who hold different convictions from his own (Religious Liberty by M. Searle Bates, pages 90-91).  It is clear that neither Hindus nor Muslims nor Christians nor Parsis cease to be Hindus, Muslims, Christians or Parsis because the State is secular.  It only means that a secular State will not interfere with the articles of faith of any religion, is modes of worship and such other matters of a strictly spiritual nature unless the religious activities come in conflict with the fundamental rights of the citizen or the authority of the State founded on the Constitution.\nMissionary Movement of Mass Conversion, 1930-1940\n\n13. The profound significance of GandhijiÔøΩs statement will not be clear without the knowledge of the political situation as it developed in the decade 1930-1940 since the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909 which followed the agitation over the partition of Bengal.  It was unfortunately discoloured by anarchical crimes.  Sir Andrew Fraser, the Lt. Governor of Bengal, wrote, in 1912 (3rd edition), a book entitled ÔøΩAmong Indian Rajahs and RyotsÔøΩ in which he propounded the doctrine that the hope of India lay in the elevating and civilizing power of Christianity (p. 275), and that ÔøΩShe ought to receive of our bestÔøΩ (p. 276).  He said, ÔøΩall parts of India, so far as education and association with the West have directly affected life, feel the unrest which comes from intellectual awakening and the revival of national spiritÔøΩ (p. 278) and it seemed to him that ÔøΩto give them civilization without Christianity is to withhold that to which our civilization owes all that is best in it and by which alone it can be kept pure and healthfulÔøΩ (p. 279)ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ ÔøΩto leave them without religion may make them a probable source of danger in the future history of the raceÔøΩ (page 279).  In 1920, Gandhiji began his non-violent movement, taking his stand on the Geeta and rallying round him the masses including the rural population.  The Report of the Royal Commission on Agriculture in India was published in 1928.  In that report there was a very significant statement, viz., ÔøΩThroughout our investigation we have constantly been impressed with the thought that mere material improvement alone will not bring lasting benefit to the agricultural populationÔøΩ (page 58),\n\n14. After Gandhiji launched his movement for Indian Independence the contest was given a religious turn by the Muslims with their demand for a separate independent State.  The Missionaries were straining their nerve to break up the solidarity of the Hindu society as will be shown in the sequel.\n\n15. The Report of the Simon Commission was published in 1929.  It recommended the exclusion of the aboriginal areas from the purview of the newly constituted Government, apparently for the purpose of according to them special protection so as to facilitate their advance as quickly as possible to the level of the population as a whole.  The Missionaries came forward to take advantage of the provision with a scheme for proselytization of the rural and aboriginal people.  In response to the initiative of the Jerusalem Meeting of the International Missionary Council and the invitation of the National Christian Council of India, Dr. Kenyan, L. Butterfield (appointed by the International Missionary Council), visited rural India and focussed attention ÔøΩon the vast area of human need and limitless spiritual possibilitiesÔøΩ, in the words of Dr. J. R. Mott, who wrote the preface to his report called ÔøΩThe Christian Mission in Rural India (1930)ÔøΩ.  That report. referred to GandhijiÔøΩs statement made at the outset of the campaign of civil disobedience, viz., ÔøΩthe future of India will be decided not in her cities but in her villagesÔøΩ (p. 42, Report), and also to the aforesaid observation of the Royal Agricultural Commission made at page 58 of its report. (ButterfieldÔøΩs Report, page 146).  Dr. Butterfield called for cooperative and united work among the Missions and Mission institutions to make clear that there was a powerful Christian enterprise in India which was to win the sixty million outcastes and an equal number of unprivileged masses to a more abundant personal and social life.  He suggested that the problem of the Indian villages should be laid before the American public and their co-operation enlisted.  He pointed out the forces which had to be faced in these words: ÔøΩthe urge of the Christian enterprise to permeate and lead the ethical and spiritual advance in India will hire to meet in India, as elsewhere, the forces of secularism, of an exaggerated nationalism, perhaps of Communism, certainly of a material industrialism.ÔøΩ As an offset he recommended that Christianity must present in an aggressive and effective fashion first Jesus Himself ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ the type of Christian individual embodying in some measure at least the spirit of Jesus and a Christian social order. (Butterfield Report, pages 126-127).\n\n16. The Round Table Conferences came to be held in 1930, 1931 and 1932.  In that hectic period of excitement, the LaymenÔøΩs Foreign Missions Enquiry Committee was appointed in America.  It consisted of 15 distinguished citizens of America, presided over by Dr. Hocking.  In their report was adumbrated the vision of a worldwide Church and world unity in civilization as Christianity was not Western but universally human (Rethinking Missions, page 8).  It propounded that the original objective of the Mission was the conquest of the world by Christianity.  It was a world benevolence conceived in terms of a world campaignÔøΩÔøΩ the universal claim of one historical fact : the Work of Christ. (Page 35, ibid).  It declared that for Christianity God is not far off but in all actions, in ploughing, sowing, reaping, etc., (page 52), and that Christianity was prepared with a polytheistic faith to see God in varied aspects (page 53).  In tones 6f imperialism it proclaimed ÔøΩMissions must go on because concrete obligations have been assumed by our institutions to the peoples of the East which could not fairly be abandonedÔøΩ (p. 5, ibid).\n\n17. That report was presumably intended to supply the spiritual background to the Missionary adventure to present in an aggressive and effective fashion first Christ himself, etc., as had been recommended by Dr. Butterfield in his report.\n\nMass Conversion\n\n18. The natural result of this united vigorous activity was that many mass conversions were effected.  Dr. Pickett, obtaining 25,000 dollars from the Rockefeller Foundation and 10,000 dollars from Dr. Mott, carried out a survey and published his report entitled Christian Mass Movement in India, in 1933. (Gharbandhu 1931, July, page 104).  Dr. Mott wrote a foreword to it.  In a conversation with Gandhiji in which he described his work of mass conversion as a work on behalf of the oppressed, Gandhiji said, ÔøΩI could understand the Muslim organisations doing this but the Christian Mission claims to be a purely spiritual effort.  It hurt me to find the Christian bodies vying with the Muslims and the Sikhs in trying to add to the number of their fold.  It seemed to be an ugly performance and a travesty of religionÔøΩ (P. 420, Christian Proselytism in India by Parekh).  The World Missionary Conference held at Tambaram in 1938 expressed itself deeply moved by ÔøΩthe cry of the multitudes for deliveranceÔøΩ and proclaimed ÔøΩthe great need for a true and living faithÔøΩ (page 16, Tambaram Report).  Missionary bodies, like the Church Missionary Society and the Salvation Army, rushed forward to save the souls of ÔøΩthe underprivileged millionsÔøΩ, apparently with a view to make out a case for separate treatment of the Christian community.  As money began to pour into the country Gandhiji exclaimed: ÔøΩMammon has been sent to serve India and God has remained behindÔøΩ and Dr. Mott said ÔøΩmoney is stored up personalityÔøΩ (page 245, Christian Missions, Navajivan Press).\n\n19. It is remarkable that in the Census of 1941, heads were counted communitywise, not on the basis of religion.  Mr. Yeats, the Census Commissioner of India in his short note on Community (Census of India, Volume I, Chapter IV, page 29, Part I, Table) tried to explain the mystery.  On the calculations made by Shri S. N. Parashar (in his article Published in Mahratta, February 16, 1946), in the light of that note, the actual increase in the Christian community was found to be 34,74,128 approximately, in the decade 1931-1941. (PP. 448-450, Christian Proselytism in India, by M. C. Parekh.)\n\nIn Hyderabad the increase in the Christian population was 141.6 per cent in the decade 1921-31, and 45.6 per cent in the decade 1931-41. (P. 103 the Directory of Churches and Missions in India and Pakistan, 1951.)\n\n20. Another noteworthy feature was that in Burma the Karens like the Muslims set up a demand for a separate State and pressed their claim before the Round Table Conference.  This move was evidently inspired by the Missionaries, judging from the remark found in the Rethinking Missions at page 138 as follows:\n\nÔøΩThe Missionaries gave them education and through the translation of the Bible a written language.  This remarkable achievement, the giving of a nationality to the peopleÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ has resulted in one embarrassment.  The Missionaries are held responsible for breaking apart an important minority group. The Karens have today a strong national society which has sent a delegation to London to plead for a Karen nation.ÔøΩ (Italics ours.)\n\n21. Judging from the nature of the part taken by the Missionaries in the decade 1930-40 we are inclined to think that their activities were directed to segregate Christian Indians and to encourage them to demand special treatment.  Their activities were thus clearly political.\n\n22. One may think that this is but a history of a bygone age which has disappeared with the attainment of Independence by India in 1947.  To think so is to misunderstand the situation.\n\n23. Towards the end of the World War II the ecumenical movement designed to unify the Christians of the world under the aegis of a Universal Church became very vigorous.  In 1945 the Commission on a just and Durable Peace stressed as one of the four points of peace requiring Christian action the development of Christian unity on a world-wide basis and affirmed that the Christian forces of the world must ÔøΩbecome a well organised and militant minorityÔøΩ (page 57, World Christian Handbook, 1952).  When we asked for an explanation of the phrase ÔøΩmilitant minorityÔøΩ the representative of the National Christian Council replied that it was an unfortunate phrase, but that it meant only ÔøΩenergetic effortsÔøΩ, (Italics ours).\n\n24. It will be clear from what follows that the movement which was started in 1930, if not before, is now found flourishing in greater vigour, backed by much increased resources in men and money.  It is a continuation of the same process on a wider scale.  In Christian Missions in Rural India it was proposed to convert 600,000 villages to overcome the forces of secularism, of exaggerated nationalism, Communism and material industrialism (page 127).  The ecumenical movement follows the same line. Rev. McLeish, a trustee of the World Dominion Press which maintains a close liaison with the International Missionary Council (page 94, World Christian Hand Book, 1952), proposed the conversion of 600,000 villages in the course of 10 years (page 7, address at the Conference of the Fellowship of the International Missionary Council, June 1-3, 1948), and the objective of the ecumenical movement is to combat, besides Communism, ÔøΩthe Utopian expectations of the non-Christian religionsÔøΩ (page 28, Elements of Ecumenism), and discountenance the rapid development of modem technology and industry in Asia. (Pages 93-94, Christianity and Asian Revolution.).\n\n25. It may be recalled that Dr. Mott, who was in the vanguard of the Missionary activity in the decade 1930-40 and contributed 10,000 dollars to the survey of the mass movement (Gharbandhu, July, 1931, page 104), carried out by Dr. Pickett and wrote prefaces to the ÔøΩChristian Mass Movement in IndiaÔøΩ and ÔøΩthe Christian Mission in Rural IndiaÔøΩ and also had discussions with Gandhiji on the subjects of mass movement and the use of money (which he contended was stored up personality), had then been regarded as a highly practical Missionary statesman (page 8, Elements of Ecumenism).  When the World Council of Churches became a thoroughly organised structure in 1948 at Amsterdam be became its Honorary President. It may be recalled that Mr. Dulles and Rev. Lakra were also present at the Amsterdam Conference.\nAttitude and Activities of the Ecumenical Movement\n\n26. The attitude of the World Council of Churches was greatly influenced by the experience the Missionaries had m the struggle with the rising tide of Indian nationalism.  They found nationalism pervading, not only the Hindus as a community, but also the educated section of the Christian Indians.  The policy of the ecumenical movement in regard to both of them is made clear in the two paragraphs which follow:\n\nÔøΩIn spite of many efforts in many forms it cannot be pretended that Christianity has made any serious impact on Hindu learning or the Hindu upper and middle classes; its successes have been among the outcaste groups ÔøΩÔøΩ the capacity of Hindu culture for absorbing other elements appears once again in the recommendations on religious teachings of the Radhakrishnan University Commission.  The task of Christian Churches and Missions in Hindu India isÔøΩÔøΩ to seek ways of communication with Hindu culture at its points of need. The time for this may be short in view of the possibility of Communist infiltration from within or pressure from without.ÔøΩ (italics ours).\n\nÔøΩIn the old Mission fields there are now Churches touched by new nationalisms, independent in temper and organisation and yet needing help from other Churches.  The act of giving and receiving, within the context of the Church and the Churches ÔøΩÔøΩ involves ÔøΩÔøΩ a new understanding of the nature of the Church ÔøΩÔøΩ the need of particular Churches to be rooted in the soil and yet supra-national in their witness and obedienceÔøΩ (page 14 and 29, World Christian Handbook,1952). (Italics ours.)\n\n27. To come to grips with the adamant Hindu society, phrases such as ÔøΩHindu NationalismÔøΩ, ÔøΩUtopian expectations of non-Christian religionsÔøΩ came to be coined. The Hindu belief that all religions truly practised lead to the divine is ridiculed as a dogma. (Page 136, Christianity and Asian Revolution).  Hinduism was quite free from the secular idea of nationalism until it had to face the aggressive attacks of the Christian religion which came armed. There were declarations as that of Archbishop of Canterbury that Christianity was an Imperial religion (page 234, Imperialism by Hobson).  To call the liberal attitude of the Hindu religion as a dogma is tantamount to intolerance of toleration itself.  The Hindu is denounced because like the Christians he does not believe that outside his own religion there is no salvation, but, as had been remarked by Rousseau, such a dogma is good only in a Theocratic Government (Chapter VIII, Social Contract).  The action he proposed was ÔøΩwhoever dares to say outside the Church there is no salvation ought to be driven from the State unless the State is the Church and the Prince, the Pontiff.  Such a dogma is good only in a Theocratic Government; in any other, it is fatalÔøΩ.  Western Christianity unfortunately overlooks the fact that it seeks to foist upon the world the tribal God of Mount Sinai.  Hinduism, like other far-Eastern religions, is not a tribal nationalistic religion.  They are all international religions, except Shintoism for the reason that in none of them is the divine a God of the chosen people (page 402, The Meeting of East and West, Northrop).\n\n28. Why should Christianity fight shy of the absorbing power of Hinduism? Christianity could hold its ground in India for centuries without any opposition.  It was only after Western Christianity came armed with the Portuguese that there sprang up resistance to it.  One fails to see why the introduction of St. JohnÔøΩs Gospel in University studies upsets the Universal Church. The Hindu has no objection to the Geeta or the Upanishads being read or studied by any one in the world.  Presumably the fear that may be haunting Western Christianity is that if St. JohnÔøΩs Gospel is studied in Indian Universities it will have to face the True Jesus that will be brought to light.\n\n29. It is remarkable that the Missionary appeal is addressed to those who live ÔøΩin conditions of abject. poverty and under oppressive systemÔøΩ, to exploit the economic distress to which the country was reduced as the result of colonialism.  Everett Cattell says: ÔøΩOur point of contact, therefore, with any soul to whom we wish to give the Gospel, is first to find out what his particular sense of need may be and confront it with Christ.  It may not at first even be expressed in spiritual terms.  The late Paget Wilkes in his ÔøΩDynamic of ServiceÔøΩ points out that in a very fruitful service in Japan he almost never saw anyone converted through a sense of sin.  That came later through gazing at the Saviour.  But most men come with a need, social, physical, economic, or the like and an awakened faith that Christ could meet that need.ÔøΩ (page 17, Ways of Evangelism).  The distress of the poor looms large in the evidence before us as well as in the reports of the Tambaram and Willingen Conferences.  This is a disruptive method followed by the Missionaries for the reason that Christianity was originally a religion of the proletariat and was in opposition to the favoured classes from the beginning and it, therefore, carries wherever it turns the seed of disruption (page 56, Travel Diary of a Philosopher by Count Keyserling). As a creed is a tool (in the words of Sir A Toynbee) it is used as a weapon to combat the creed of Communism as also to disrupt non-Christian societies.\n\n30. Gandhiji resented this approach to these classes and asked the Missionary to influence the minds of the intelligentsia, but he was told that the uneducated and the unsophisticated classes were more responsive to religious appeal as they were in real need of it.  The real reason is to be found in the Census Report of 1881 (Bombay), where Mr. Baines stated as follows:-\n\nÔøΩThe greater receptivity of the member of the lower class is due to the emotional appeal which neither his intelligence nor his education disposes him to enlargeÔøΩ (quoted at page 79, Census of India, 1891, Volume XI, Part I).\n\nThat places the converts entirely under the domination of the Missionary and wipes out his individuality altogether.\n\n31. We have already described how money flowed into the Surguja district to effect mass conversions after it was opened to Missionary work, pursuant to the liberal provisions of the Constitution of India.  The mass conversions were made exactly in accordance with the instructions contained in the Missionary Obligation of the Church, 1952, published by the International Missionary Council.  At page 27 it says, ÔøΩIn wide regions of the world the major problem is hunger ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ in the present situation there are opportunities for the Church ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ Constitutional provisions of religious freedom within some of the newly independent nations ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ new resources for mass evangelism through the press, film, radio and televisionÔøΩ.  There is evidence before us that the people are called by some kind of public advertisement, offering inducements of loans and they are regarded as enquirers when they appear in response to the call. What species of spiritual impulse prompted the crowds to embrace Christianity en masse can well be imagined from what follows:-\n\n1st February 1952 ÔøΩ 10 families consisting of 69 members. \n3rd February 1952 ÔøΩ 28 families consisting of 144 members. \n5th February 1952 ÔøΩ 18 families consisting of 85 members. \n10th February 1952 ÔøΩ 16 families consisting of 65 members.\n\n(Gharbandhu, May 1952, page 5.) This is but an illustrative case.\n\n32. One wonders whether this is the way of diffusing spiritual illumination.\nAttempt to Alienate the Indian Christian Community from their Nation\n\n36. There also arose the question as to the meaning of the phrase ÔøΩrooted in the soilÔøΩ.  This was interpreted by the International Missionary Conference, held at Willingen, in 1952, as meaning ÔøΩrelated to the soilÔøΩ.  The Church can only be ÔøΩrooted in ChristÔøΩ (page 9, The Missionary Obligation of the Church, 1952).  Upon this interpretation, it was emphasised that the task before the younger Churches was a formidable one, as they had to be ÔøΩrooted in ChristÔøΩ, first before they could be ÔøΩrelated to the soilÔøΩ (page 271, Christianity and Asian Revolution). As. one reads the Missionary literature one comes across phrases such as ÔøΩcolony of heavenÔøΩ, ÔøΩin the country but not of the countryÔøΩ, ÔøΩhistorical community of the redeemedÔøΩ. All these smack of extra-territoriality which figured so prominently in Chinese Treaties. It appears to us that the Missionary ÔøΩstrategyÔøΩ (a word which recurs frequently) is to detach the Christian Indian from his nation.  It may well be a suspicion, but it is strengthened by certain views expressed by prominent persons. Dr. Pickett of North India speaking in the Assembly of the World Council of Churches in 1954, remarked that one of the reasons for the development of Church Unity was to obviate the danger of the growth of nationalism as the rational churches were apt to reflect the spirit of political nationalism (Page 544, National Christian Council Review, December 1954).\n\n37. Rt. Rev. J. E. L. Newbigin, who is the Chairman of a group of thinkers within the World Council of Churches (page 26, Elements of Ecumenism), laid stress on the fact that Christians were the chosen race in these words : ÔøΩWe cannot understand the New Testament without the Old ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ the central theme of that book is God choosing (election) a people to be His Own People ÔøΩÔøΩ now (and this is the next great point) we, who read it today in the Church read it as members of that People.ÔøΩ (page 75, National Christian Council Review, February 1954).\n\n38. In an article ÔøΩChristian AwakeÔøΩ, it is propounded that ÔøΩwhen there is a conflict of loyalty between Christ and country, the true Christian has necessarily to choose obedience to ChristÔøΩ. (page 158, National Christian Council Review, April 1955).  We have before us a pamphlet entitled: ÔøΩFor Christ and CountryÔøΩ, issued in America.  We wonder whether the Americans would accept this interpretation of the duty of a Christian in America.\n\n39. In India, there is the danger of such a conflict arising for the reason that in the report of the Commission on Christian Social Action, ÔøΩcompetitionÔøΩ is preferred to ÔøΩco-existenceÔøΩ (page 114, 1955 Blue Book Annual Reports of Officers and Boards of the Evangelical and Reformed Church).  Here there is room for disagreement.  Co-existence implies ÔøΩlive and let liveÔøΩ, as also ÔøΩlet us live togetherÔøΩ, i.e., it may include co-operation, but it cannot include competition which means ÔøΩeither you live or I liveÔøΩ.  In co-operation, rewards are shared, in competition they are monopolised.\n\n40. The information which has come before us regarding the Abundant Life Movement started with the aid of the funds received from America, presumably in terms of ÔøΩthe strategy of the Christian enterprise to win these great under-privileged masses to a more abundant personal and social lifeÔøΩ (page 126, Christian Mission in Rural India) shows that it is confined to the converted Christians and intended to encounter Communism. The Jeevan Tara Movement in Damoh and the farm purchased by Dr. Clines in the Yeotmal district are also meant to benefit the Christian converts.  Nowhere did we find Christians taking part in the nation-building activities.  At page 158, National Christian Council Review, April 1955, even a Christian writer admits that Indian Christians, as a whole, have not identified themselves with nation-building activities.\n\nDanger of Foreign Control during Crisis\n\n41. The tendency to keep the Christians, separate from the mass of the people and under Missionary control engenders the suspicion that they might be used in critical times to promote foreign interests, as was attempted to be done by the Missionaries of Chhota Nagpur, by offer the offer of 10,000 armed Kols and by Dr. Mason in Burma, of a battalion of Karens, in the critical year of 1857 (page 206, History of Missions in India, by Richter). The recent hostile attitude of the Karens. Nagas and Ambonese points in the same direction (p. 215, Christianity and Asian Revolution). It is, therefore, necessary to have a strict watch on the activities of Missionaries in the hill tribes areas.\n\n42. The idea underlying the Christian Mission in Rural India (Dr. ButterfieldÔøΩs report) was to facilitate mass proselytization.  The work was conceived either to forestall the national effort to rehabilitate the villages or to show that without Christianising the villages the rehabilitation of the villages was not possible. But what do the Missions now think about the work of the Government? In the Blue Book Annual Report of the Evangelical and Reformed Church, for the year 1954, it is said, ÔøΩIndia is changing so rapidly that even those who are closely connected with the country through our Missionary endeavours find it difficult to keep up with every phase of our political, economic, social and religions development. Within seven years after gaining Independence, India has moved into a place of world leadership.  In spite of adverse circumstances intensified by drought, floods, and other calamities, Communism and resurgent Hinduism have been held in check.  IndiaÔøΩs progress in social and economic welfare leaves one astounded.  Two and a half million additional acres have been brought under irrigation during the past year. Some 5,000 wells were dug to provide a more adequate water-supply.  Foodgrains were increased by eleven million tons last year in spite of devastating floods.  New fertilizer plants, research centres, laboratories, schools and colleges are the order of the day. Recently, divorce laws were enacted which prove how quickly India is forgetting her old religions teachings and social customs.  To what extent can Christ be regarded ÔøΩthe Hope of the WorldÔøΩ in such a situation?  Is man after all ÔøΩthe architect of his own salvation?ÔøΩ What relevance have Christian Missions in a country like India? Perhaps the remarks of a leading Hindu gentleman in Raipur indicated the answer when he said, ÔøΩThese plans will succeed if character is built upÔøΩ and an honoured leader of our Evangelical and Reformed Church said, ÔøΩwe must provide the leavenÔøΩ.  Jesus announced ÔøΩI am the Way, the Truth and the LifeÔøΩ. (page 61).\n\n43. It is not easy to understand why the Missions should be surprised if man becomes the architect of his own salvation. Perhaps it is because the Missions look askance at ÔøΩmaterial industrialismÔøΩ and ÔøΩthe Utopian expectationsÔøΩ of non-Christian religions.\n\n44. The Hindu gentleman must have known that centuries before Christ the, Indian Rishis proclaimed ÔøΩTruth wins ever, not falsehood; with truth is paved the way to the divine (Mundaka Upanishad quoted at page 67, Discovery of India by Shri Nehru).  To the Hindu, ÔøΩcharacterÔøΩ has ethical implications; but one usually finds that in the Missionary literature and speeches character is stressed as ÔøΩChristian characterÔøΩ.  What is the kind of Christian character liased on truth that the Missionary wants to build up?  Is it to create men of Christian character that the mass movements in Formosa have been initiated? (page 49, World Christian Handbook 1952).  Perhaps, it is necessary to do so for the reason that Chiang-Kai-Shek proclaimed himself as a ÔøΩfollower of Jesus ChristÔøΩ and added that the success of his revolution depended upon men of faith and of character and that the best of his officers were Christians and the large number of his Generals were the members of the Church! (pages 424-425, The Meeting of East and West by Northrop).\n\n44-A. On many occasions Gandhiji expressed his suspicion about the ulterior motives of Missionary enterprise. Dr. Asirvatham points out that such a suspicion springs from the manifestation of the American foreign policy in such aggressive forms as in the slogan : ÔøΩLet Asians fight AsiansÔøΩ (page 35, Christianity in the Indian Crucible).\n\n45. As the United States has no territory abroad she tries to compensate for this by establishing military bases and military alliances (page 22, Christianity and Asian Revolution).  It appears that by this drive of proselytization in India she desires to create psychological bases. The persons who came before us expressed such suspicions about American aims very strongly, and this is also pointed out at page 23 of the aforesaid book in these words : ÔøΩThe West is using the threat of Communism as an excuse to regain political mastery over the liberated peoplesÔøΩ.  The American Missionary activity in some of its aspects, is too tinged with the anti-communist world strategy to elude notice (p. 29, World Christian Handbook).  Morrison in his report on the subject of ÔøΩReligious Liberty in the Near East, 1948ÔøΩ, also notes in more places than one that there is a suspicion of the foreign Mission being the agents of foreign political power.  His conclusion is remarkably frank in these words : ÔøΩNo doubt in the past Missions have been used to promote political endsÔøΩ (page 49).\n\n46. In a lecture which the Director of the Commission of the Churches on International Affairs, Dr. O. Frederick Nolde, delivered in 1954, he declared that the effectiveness of the United Nations would be dependent upon the extent to which real world community existed recognising no national frontiers.  He accordingly asked the Christians who are party to the ecumenical fellowship which recognises no national frontiers to view the problem in three aspects, viz. (i) the standpoint of faith and life within the churches, (ii) the need to promote world community, (iii) the United States ÔøΩpotential contribution to world peace and justiceÔøΩ (National Christian Council Review April 1954, page 195).\n\n47. As one reads the Christian literature one comes across phrases like ÔøΩcolony of heavenÔøΩ ÔøΩhistorical community of the redeemedÔøΩ, a Christian being ÔøΩin but not of the countryÔøΩ suggesting that a Christian does not belong to the country of which he is a citizen and on this basis he is expected to view the problems from the point of view of the United States idea of peace and justice.'<br />Author: 'vcr48'  id: 'orcye2'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/orcye2/niyogi_commission_report_on_christian_missionary/</li>

Also, when I point out India had a much higher GDP than colonial nations but that changed after colonization. They say India was very poor per capita terms and not wealthy(implying Britain didn't plunder India?)\n\nWhat do you think about this perspective? I was always taught colonial powers plundered resources and wealth from their colonies but many people(especially westerners) seem to disagree. They point out it was only the ruling class and the private companies that benefitted.

Here's a resketched map of the 1812 Brahmaputra River just leaving Assam and draining into the Mouths of the Ganges.

      <li>Title::: 'Sanskrit texts on Astronomy translated into Arabic by the Abbasid Empire of Baghdad were used to find the time and direction of prayer (Mecca)'<br />Body: '\n&gt; At this time, scientists translated studies in Sanskrit, Pahlavi, and Greek into Arabic, and, for the first time, recorded Arab Bedouin traditions. The Indian Sanskrit and Persian Pahlavi sources taught medieval astronomers methods for calculating the position of heavenly bodies, and for creating tables recording the movement of the sun, the moon, and the five known planets. The Bedouin traditions contained knowledge on the fixed stars, the passage of the sun and moon through the zodiacal signs and lunar mansions, and the seasons and associated phenomenon. This body of knowledge was refined in part because of the specific requirements of Islam; the religion required the ability to correctly determine the time and direction of Mecca for prayer, the moment of sunrise and sunset for fasting during Ramadan, and for fixing the appearance of the moon that marked the start of a new month. This led to the refinement of scientific instruments, an improvement in methods for making observations, and the creation of new calendrical systems.\n\nSource: https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/astr/hd_astr.htm\n\n&gt; The mathematical astronomy text Brahmasiddhanta of Brahmagupta (598-668) was received in the court of Al-Mansur (753‚Äì774). It was translated by Alfazari into Arabic as Az-Zƒ´j ‚ÄõalƒÅ Sinƒ´ al-‚ÄõArab, popularly called Sindhind. This translation was the means by which the Hindu numerals were transmitted from the Sanskrit to the Arabic tradition. According to Al-Biruni,\n\n&gt; As Sindh was under the actual rule of the Khalif Mansur (AD 753‚Äì774), there came embassies from that part of India to Bagdad and among them scholars, who brought with them two books.\nWith the help of these Pandits Alfazari, perhaps also Yaq≈´b ibn TƒÅriq, translated them. Both works have been largely used, and have exercised a great influence. It was on this occasion that the Arabs first became acquainted with a scientific system of astronomy. They learned from Brahmagupta earlier than Ptolemy.\n\n&gt; ‚Äî\u2009Alberuni (Ed. &amp; trans. Edward Sachau), Alberuni\'s India [The Indika of Alberuni] (1910)\nAlberuni\'s translator and editor Edward Sachau wrote: "It is Brahmagupta who taught Arabs mathematics before they got acquainted with Greek science." Al-Fazari also translated the Khandakhadyaka (Arakand) of Brahmagupta.\n\n&gt; Through the resulting Arabic translations of Sindhind and Arakand, the use of Indian numerals became established in the Islamic world.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_influence_on_Islamic_science#Astronomy\n\n\nAlso see,\n\nIndia and the Golden Age of Islam\nhttps://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-and-the-golden-age-of-islam/237691\n\nCaspian Report - Rise and Decline of Science in Islam\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60JboffOhaw\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_influence_on_Islamic_science#Astronomy'<br />Author: 'greasesoda'  id: 'oqoav1'<br />Score:43<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/oqoav1/sanskrit_texts_on_astronomy_translated_into/</li>

      <li>Title::: "'Fundamentals of Monotheism ‚Äì Dharma vs. Religion'"<br />Body: '*In this brief excerpt, one of India‚Äôs greatest modern historians, Sita Ram Goel discusses the fundamentals of monotheism and how it differs from the fundamentals of polytheism. This excerpt discusses the fundamentals which differentiate Dharma from Religion.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s87mukhij4d71.png?width=597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4633a163e1c2ce85074c8a5f6ec5c87fb0c980c7\n\nMonotheism has three sects ‚Äì Judaism, Christianity and Islam. These three sects are scions of the same mother. They are born out of same psyche, and the main mythical and doctrinal propositions of all the three are similar. Therefore, first of all, we will describe the propositions shared in common by these three faiths.\n\nThe first proposition of Monotheism is that the creator and controller of the Cosmos is the One God who is unique, who does not manifest himself in different forms, and who does not permit the worship of any god or goddess other than himself. There is no element outside or inside the Cosmos which is of the same substance as the One God, or is his part, or is pervaded by him. Therefore, to worship any other gods or goddesses or to regard any part of the Cosmos as divine, is a serious crime against the One God.\n\nThe second proposition of Monotheism is that the One God has created the Cosmos without the aid of any substance, that is, out of sheer Void or Nothing. This miracle is indicative of the omnipotence of the One God. If the One God had taken the least aid from any substance, his omnipotence would have suffered disparagement. For this very reason, he himself also remained outside of his own creation.\n\nThe third proposition of Monotheism is that the human male is the highest creation of the One God. At the time of creating the human male, the One God made a clay figure of the human form and blew his own breath into it. This breath became the soul of the human male. Monotheism is not quite sure whether the human female has a soul or not. The One God had taken one rib out of the human male and carved it into a figure of the human female without blowing his breath into that figure. Nor can human soul be regarded as a divine entity. After acquiring the soul, the human being became conscious and capable of thinking and also attained the capacity to distinguish between vice and virtue. But this soul cannot be considered a part of the One God. Monotheism is also quite clear that all other animate and inanimate parts of creation have been created merely for enjoyment by humans, and humans should not harbour any other feeling towards them.\n\nAccording to the fourth proposition of Monotheism, man has only one life and the supreme elevation of that life is an exclusive worship of the One God. An indispensable part of that worship is that man regulates all his conduct and thought in accordance with the commandments of the One God. But man cannot acquaint himself with those commandments by establishing direct contact with the One God. The One God remains outside the Cosmos while man remains inside it. Therefore, direct contact between the two is inconceivable. Thus finding man groping in the dark, the One God takes pity on him and, in order to convey his commandments to man, he sends his prophets from time to time. Every commandment of the One God revealed by each prophet is unprecedented; it had never been heard before. In this process of history, the One God at last sends his perfect prophet through whose mouth a comprehensive and complete code of commandments of the One God is received by man. This prophet is called the Last Prophet who pronounces the final commandments of the One God, to which nothing can be added and from which nothing can be subtracted. In the revelations by the Last Prophet, the whole truth is incorporated.\n\nAccording to the fifth proposition of Monotheism, two events take place after the advent of the Last Prophet. Firstly, the history of mankind gets divided into two periods. The period before the coming of the Last Prophet, becomes the period of darkness or ignorance, and the period thereafter the period of light or knowledge. No mode of worship or cultural heritage or social custom of the earlier period, remains valid and a complete destruction of whatever prevailed earlier, is considered conducive to salvation of mankind. Secondly, after the coming of the Last Prophet, mankind is divided into two groups. One group is that which professes complete faith in the Last Prophet and begins to follow the path shown by him. The other group is that which professes doubts regarding the Last Prophet or repudiates him. The first group becomes dear to the One God, and the second invites his wrath. The One God commands the first group to wage ceaseless jihad against the second group, and either make that group submit to the Last Prophet or annihilate it altogether.\n\nThe sixth proposition of Monotheism is that the One God has bestowed sovereignty of the whole world on his Last Prophet, and the Last Prophet on the group professing complete faith in him. At the same time, the One God has confiscated the lives and properties of the group which rebels against his Last Prophet. Therefore, the believing group has the sacred duty to obey his commandments and seize the lives and properties of the rebel group. Those of the rebel group who take to arms in their defense, should be massacred. Their families should be captured and sold into slavery. Their movable and immovable properties should be plundered. Their religious places should be destroyed. Their religious books should be burnt. Their saints and sages and priests should be dishonored if not killed outright. And their whole cultural wealth should be obliterated. Those of the rebel group who accept defeat, should be converted to the faith of the conqueror. If for any reason their conversion is not possible, they should be made second class citizens and oppressed till they seek refuge in the Last Prophet. In order to carry out the commandments of the One God in the context of the rebel group, it is not required that the moral character of the believing group be higher or their consciousness purer. Professing exclusive faith in the Last Prophet is enough for them. (See Appendix 3 for the scriptural sanctions which Monotheism provides for this behavior pattern).\n\nAccording to the seventh proposition of Monotheism, on the Last Day, all those born and dead from the beginning to end of creation, will rise from their graves and present them-selves before the One God for his Last Judgment. On that day, the Last Prophet will reappear, sit on the right side of the One God, and give account of the good and bad deeds of each human being. Those who had professed faith in the Last Prophet will be sent to an everlasting heaven where all the objects of enjoyment of the terrestrial world will continue to be available for ever in their highest quality and limitless quantity. On the other hand, those who had rebelled against the Last Prophet will be thrown into an everlasting hell with full arrangements for subjecting them to indescribable torments. In the context of heaven and hell, it is to be noted that at the time of delivering his judgment, the One God will pay attention not to the conduct of the applicants but to their faith. Intense faith in the Last Prophet, will enable the One God to forgive many faults of conduct. The Last Prophet will also not falter in recommending favors for those devoted to him exclusively.\n\nAll these seven proposition are shared in common by Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The conflict among these three creeds is regarding the Last Prophet, leaving aside a few other secondary matters. The Jews believe in Moses as their Last Prophet, the Christians in Jesus Christ, and Muslims in Muhammad. Much maligning and also killing has taken place among these three creeds due to this conflict. The greatest sufferers have been the Jews whom Christians and Muslims call killers of prophets and corrupters of scriptures. Many holy wars have also been fought between Christianity and Islam. But in spite of these mutual differences, the followers of all these three faiths have displayed the same hostility against the followers of Advaita. Slaughters made by the Jews could not spread outside Palestine for various reasons. But the Christians and the Muslims have painted many countries with extensive bloodshed and destroyed the spiritual and cultural wealth of those countries as far as they could.\n\n\\-----------\n\nSource: [https://cisindus.org/2020/01/03/fundamentals-of-monotheism/](https://cisindus.org/2020/01/03/fundamentals-of-monotheism/)'<br />Author: 'madeinbharat'  id: 'oqmbbi'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/oqmbbi/fundamentals_of_monotheism_dharma_vs_religion/</li>

This is a tract written on the Nature of Islam in context of the rising Islamic terrorism the world over in 2002. This article discusses how Indian Secularism lies about Islam and how it affects the future of India and humanity. They are ultimately primed for conversion to Islam. Note: Krishnaswami is a penname of an author, who for more spiritual than political reasons, shall remain anonymous.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ze24di2ulyc71.png?width=647&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92e1230a24411625506e531c7239e3f5f656bead\n\nThe Present day Indian leadership and the pseudo-secular media cherishes the found belief that they can manage the Muslims in India and elsewhere by praising Islam, its Prophet, and its scripture. This is exactly the attitude of second class non-Muslim citizens of Islamic states, who by paying Jaziah tax and by praising Islam save their necks. And this mental attitude of slavery is known as **‚ÄòDhimmitude‚Äô**. These pseudo secular Dhimmies conveniently forget that this is exactly what Gandhi had done, and that this precisely is the reason why he failed. Dhimmitude will never pay, therefore, always call a spade a spade.\n\nThe pseudo-secular media has perverted India‚Äôs political parlance by inventing a fraudulent Dhimmi terminology to describe the current situation prevailing in the country. This deceitful jargon is their main tool to deceive Hindus. It is important to expose their Orwellian double speak. You can make these verbal weapons useless by using the alternative and truthful terminology in place of media-sponsored misleading jargon.\n\nFor example, use the following expressions:\n\n* ‚ÄúMuslim terrorist‚Äù in place of ‚ÄúKashmiri Militant‚Äù;\n* ‚ÄúWell guided by Koran and employed in the service of Allah‚Äù in place of ‚Äúmisguided and unemployed youth‚Äù;\n* ‚ÄúIslam‚Äù in place of ‚ÄúIslamic fundamentalism‚Äù (Islam is fundamentalism);\n* ‚ÄúIslamic Terrorism‚Äù in place of ‚ÄúPakistani Terrorism‚Äù;\n* ‚ÄúHindu victims of ethnic cleansing‚Äù in place of ‚ÄúKashmiri migrants‚Äù;\n* ‚ÄúOpportunistic Islam‚Äù in place of ‚ÄúModerate Islam‚Äù;\n* ‚ÄúMask-of-Islam‚Äù in place of ‚ÄúSufi-Islam‚Äù;\n* ‚ÄúTerrorist-rights‚Äù in place of ‚ÄúHuman-rights‚Äù;\n* ‚ÄúIslamic Dark Age‚Äù in place of ‚ÄúMedieval Muslim Rule‚Äù;\n* ‚ÄúBastard ‚Äì Harem culture‚Äù in place of ‚Äúcomposite culture‚Äù;\n* ‚ÄúDhimmitude‚Äù or ‚ÄúDharma Adharma Sambhava‚Äù in place of ‚ÄúSarva Dharma Sambhava‚Äù and ‚ÄúDhimmi‚Äù in place of ‚ÄúSecular‚Äù;\n* ‚ÄúPseudo-secularism‚Äù in place of ‚Äúsecularism‚Äù;\n* ‚ÄúAgents of Islam‚Äù in place of ‚ÄúLeftists and communists‚Äù;\n* ‚ÄúNationalism‚Äù in place of ‚ÄúHindu communalism‚Äù;\n* ‚ÄúNationalist‚Äù in place of ‚ÄúHindu Rightist, Reactionary and Revivalist‚Äù;\n* ‚ÄúNationalisation‚Äù in place of ‚ÄúSaffronization‚Äù;\n* ‚ÄúDenationalisation‚Äù in place of ‚ÄúSecularisation‚Äù;\n\nThe use of correct terminology is sure antidote to the pseudo-secular Dhimmitude and Muslim self-righteousness. Raise objection whenever and wherever the right expression is not used.\n\nAnother mean trick of the pseudo-secular Dhimmies is to blame Pakistan but insulate and absolve the Islam from any charges of terrorist crimes. *Pakistan has not invented Islamic terrorism, they are only religiously practising it* and even Pakistani people themselves are victims of it. It was invented and perfected by the Prophet of Islam himself. Islam is the political ideology of predator Arab imperialism thinly camouflaged in the garb of religion and implemented by terror and Pakistan is its geographical manifestation.  We should never forget that Pakistan is created by the Islam, for the Islam and it is the nation of the Islam. Therefore, the idea that ‚ÄúPakistan is bad but Islam is good‚Äù is a media sponsored fraud. Do not fall into this media manufactured mental trap. On the contrary, if Pakistan is bad, then Islam is essentially bad, because it is the ideological backbone of that state.\n\nBy simply blaming Musharaff, ISI or Pakistan for Islamic crimes committed on Indian territory, we can not solve this problem.  We can better serve our nation by reading Koran (the fountainhead of all Islamic terrorist activities) and by educating our people about its violent contents. So that ordinary Indian citizens can effectively counter the falsehood propagated by pseudo-secular media that ‚ÄòIslam is a religion of peace‚Äô, and thus save Hindu society from falling into Dhimmitude.\n\nPakistan‚Äôs objective is to complete the mission of Islam in India, which lay unfinished in spite of millennium long ‚ÄòJihad‚Äô. It is foolish to think that the problem will vanish if Kashmir is handed over to them. Pakistan‚Äôs motive is to convert Dar-ul-Harb into Dar-ul-Islam, bit by bit, first Kashmir, then Assam, then Kerala and so on. Only this Islamic mission provides the ideological justification for the existence of Pakistan.\n\n**A Questionnaire**\n\nBy finding answers to the following questions the pseudo-secularists can help their Muslim brothers:\n\n1. Is Islamic theology compatible with the concept of ‚Äòdemocracy‚Äô?\n2. Is Islamic theology compatible with the concept of ‚Äòsecularism‚Äô?\n3. Is Islamic theology compatible with the concept of ‚Äòuniversal human rights‚Äô?\n4. Is Islamic theology compatible with the concept of ‚Äòminority rights‚Äô?\n5. Is Islamic theology compatible with the concept of ‚Äòwomen rights‚Äô?\n6. Is Islamic theology compatible with the concept of ‚Äòfreedom of inquiry‚Äô and ‚Äòfreedom of expression‚Äô?\n7. Is Islamic theology compatible with the concept of ‚Äònationalism‚Äô?\n8. Is Islamic theology compatible with the ‚Äòfine and liberal arts‚Äô such as painting, sculpture, dance, drama, film, and music?\n9. Is Islamic theology compatible with the ‚Äòmodern economy‚Äô?\n10. Is Islamic theology compatible with the ‚Äòlogic, rationality and science‚Äô?\n\n**If yes, how? If not, why?**\n\n**Why totalitarian ideologies Nazism and Fascism are bad, but Islam is good?**\n\nWhenever and wherever you meet a pseudo-secular Dhimmi confront him with this questionnaire along with a copy of Koran and expose his intellectual dishonesty.\n\n\\-------------------\n\nSource: [https://cisindus.org/2020/01/01/islam-according-to-indian-secularism/](https://cisindus.org/2020/01/01/islam-according-to-indian-secularism/)"<br />Author: 'madeinbharat'  id: 'oq1rk3'<br />Score:32<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/oq1rk3/islam_according_to_indian_secularism/</li>
      <li>Title::: "'Muslims on Islam'"<br />Body: '*This is part 7 of the earlier article On the Nature of Islam. This is a tract written on the Nature of Islam in context of the rising Islamic terrorism the world over in 2002. This article discusses what free-thinking Muslims think about Islam. They are ultimately primed for conversion to Islam. Note: Krishnaswami is a penname of an author, who for more spiritual than political reasons, shall remain anonymous.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x4fg5gk5kyc71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b515f3de9434be015b735445b5934310c3c05e43\n\nBrigadier S.K. Malik of Pakistan wrote a book named ‚Äú The Quranic Concept of War ‚Äúin 1979. He collected and analysed the Koranic verses on war against kafirs. They add up to 267 and are spread over 17 surahs (chapters) of Koran. The book carries a foreword by the late General Zia-ul-Haq who promoted the concept of ‚Äúproxy ‚Äú war against India. The General says: ‚Äú This book brings out Koranic philosophy on the application of military force within the context of the totality, that is Jehad. Which is not the exclusive domain of the professional solider, nor is it restricted to the application of military force alone. The professional solider in a Muslim army, pursuing the goals of a Muslim state, cannot become ‚Äòprofessional‚Äô if in all his activities he does not take the ‚Äòcolour of Allah‚Äô.\n\nAllah Bukhsh K. Brohi who was the former Pakistan‚Äôs ambassador in India has written a preface for Malik‚Äôs book. He makes following points ‚Äì ‚Äú Islam views the world as though it were bipolarised in two opposite camps: Dar-ul-Islam facing Dar-ul-Harb the first one is submissive to Allah‚Äôs purpose‚Ä¶ but the second one is engaged in perpetuating defiance of Allah‚Ä¶ The idea of Islam is incapable of being realised within the framework of territorial states‚Ä¶Islam supplies the spiritual principle of integration of mankind‚Ä¶ a principle which is supra-national, supra-racial, supra-linguistic and supra-territorial‚Ä¶ in Islam, of course, no nation is sovereign since Allah alone is the only sovereign in whom all authority vests‚Äù.\n\nBrigadier S.K. Malik starts with ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Holy Quran gives us a philosophy of war. The divine philosophy is an integral part of the Quranic ideology‚Äù. In chapter three titled ‚ÄòThe Causes of War‚Äô he writes ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe central theme behind the causes of war as spelt out by the Holy Quran, was the causes of Allah (Koran 2:190,244; 4:84) it was essentially a war fought by Faithful Muslims against unbeliever Kafirs (Koran 4.76)‚Äù.\n\nIn chapter seven of the book ‚Äò the strategy of war‚Äô Brigadier S.K. Malik says -‚ÄúInstructions pertaining to the divine theory of military strategy are found in the Quranic revelations (Koran 3:124-26; 8:9-10,11,59-60). All these revelations urge the Faithful Muslim to prepare for war to the utmost in order to strike terror into the hearts of the enemies‚Äù‚Ä¶ (Pg. 58)\n\nMalik elaborates as follows **‚Äì ‚ÄúTerror struck into the hearts of the enemies is not only a means it is the end in itself ‚Ä¶ it is the point where the means and the end meet and merge. Terror is not a means of imposing decision upon the enemy. It is the decision we wish to impose upon him‚Ä¶‚Äù** (Pg. 60)\n\n**‚ÄúTerror‚Ä¶ can be instilled only if the opponent‚Äôs Faith (read religion) is destroyed. Psychological dislocation is temporary; spiritual dislocation is permanent. Psychological dislocation can be produced by a physical act but this does not hold good of the spiritual dislocation. To instil terror into the hearts of the enemy, it is essential, in the ultimate analysis, to dislocate his Faith‚Ä¶‚Äù**(Pg. 60)\n\nDoes it sound diabolical? Not to Muslim, Communist and pseudo-secular ears for sure. Terrorism in all its forms has been the most effective weapon in the armoury of Islam ever since its advent. Great terrorists have been the heroes whom Muslims cherish the most. And it is terror, which has seen to it that victims do not remember what they were subjected to before they were forced into the fold of the Islam. The victims thus converted and brainwashed are expected and exhorted to become- and do become in most cases- terrorist in their own turn! (Goel SR / The Calcutta Quran Petition / Voice of India).\n\nMalik writes, in chapter nine, ‚ÄúThe Application of Quranic Military Thought‚Äù, about the career of Prophet Muhammed as a warlord from 622 AD to 632 AD. Malik and Muslim scholars of his ilk want us to believe that the Muslim armies succeeded in these campaigns because they practiced the strategies of war reposited in the Quran. This is a Big Lie. *They succeeded because the Pagan Arabs lived in a series of tribal settlements and did not understand Muhammad‚Äôs game, while Muslims at Medina built up a formidable war machine with the help of plunder obtained in raids, and by recruiting desperadoes from all over Arabia through lure of loot &amp; free sex and bloodlust*. Later on, the militarized Arabs succeeded in overrunning the Persian and Roman empires because the two empires had exhausted themselves through mutual warfare for a thousand years. (ibid).\n\n‚ÄúThe Koran wants Muslim to retain the initiative to themselves through bold, aggressive but calculated and deliberate planning and conduct of war. The Muslim are to be harangued constantly and roused to commit aggression again and again, Koran-9: 5; 8:65‚Äù. ‚ÄúMachiavelli who had studied the history of prophets has observed in his magnum opus, ‚ÄòThe Prince‚Äô that ‚Äúall well-armed prophets have conquered and the unarmed failed‚Äù (ibid).\n\n‚ÄúIn fact, prophets other than Muhammad had arisen in Arabia itself, before, alongside and after Muhammad. But all of them had failed because they did not raise armies and assemble arsenals. Muhammad succeeded because he equipped his mission with a mailed fist. It may be noted that while he had only 301 ill-equipped warriors with him in the Battle of Badr (622 AD), he had 10,000 well-equipped men when he marched into Mecca eight years later (630 AD) and 30,000 when he planned an invasion of Palestine on the eve of his death (632 AD).‚Äù (ibid).\n\n‚ÄúThe term *‚Äòjihad‚Äô* may have acquired a mystic meaning for Muslims who believe in Muhammad‚Äôs ‚Äúrevelations‚Äù, and the divinity of Allah. But for the historian who studies recorded facts and uses normal human reason to reach conclusions, ‚Äò*‚Äò jihad‚Äù* is no more than physical aggression preceded by ideological aggression.‚Äù (ibid).\n\n‚ÄúA determined minority always succeeds if the victims of aggression do not understand the game, even if the latter are larger in number and more prosperous. That is how the Christians succeeded in Roman Empire, the Muslims in Arabia, the communists in Russia and China, the Nazis in Germany and the Fascist in Italy. It is as simple as that‚Äù (ibid).\n\n\\---------------\n\nSource: [https://cisindus.org/2019/12/31/muslims-on-islam/](https://cisindus.org/2019/12/31/muslims-on-islam/)'<br />Author: 'madeinbharat'  id: 'oq1m5t'<br />Score:25<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/oq1m5t/muslims_on_islam/</li>

When BJP was in power in Jharkhand, it organised campaigns against conversion citing anti-conversion/missionary statements of Gandhi. Jean Dreze who based himself in missionary-infested Jharkhand, broke on stage to announce talking of Gandhi\'s opposition to proselytisation &amp; conversion is communalism. (Now of course, we need to wonder why opposition to conversion irrespective of religion would be communal, but maybe Antonia Maino\'s researcher knows more than us..)\n\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/india/economist-jean-dreze-not-allowed-to-complete-speech-following-angry-objection-by-jharkhand-agriculture-minister-4796796/\n\n&gt;Speaking to The Indian Express, Dreze said: "I was interrupted when I argued that communalism was most dangerous when the state itself created antagonism between communities. I gave the infamous (government) ad quoting Gandhi (which had appeared on August 11) as an example."\n\n&gt;Dreze made this argument in the backdrop of the advertisement brought out by the government a day ahead of the tabling, and passing, the anti-conversion bill in the Assembly. The advertisement had quoted Mahatma Gandhi asking Christian missionaries not to go for religious conversion of poor and gullible tribals. The programme, called Jharkhand Conclave-2025, was held in the capital on Sunday.\n\n\nA researcher, who doesn\'t like history to be talked about because he didn\'t like it, and resented opposition to missionary conversion- That\'s Jean Dreze.\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nROCKEFELLER AND HISTORY OF AMERICAN PLUTOCRACY DEFINING &amp; ENACTING US FOREIGN POLICIES\n\n- Rockefeller Foundation akin to Ford Foundation has been noted to be covert foreign policy arm of CIA during cold war by acclaimed books.\n\n&gt;*The book The Cultural Cold War documents how the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation have long been "conscious instruments of covert US foreign policy, with directors and officers who were closely connected to, or even members of American intelligence"*\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BenjaminNorton/status/1282720650898083842\n\nReview of the book from Amazon/NYTimes/WSJ about its credibility:\n\n&gt;Called "the most comprehensive account yet of the [CIA\'s] activities between 1947 and 1967" by the New York Times, the book presents shocking evidence of the CIA\'s undercover program of cultural interventions in Western Europe and at home, drawing together declassified documents and exclusive interviews to expose the CIA\'s astonishing campaign to deploy the likes of Hannah Arendt, Isaiah Berlin, Leonard Bernstein, Robert Lowell, George Orwell, and Jackson Pollock as weapons in the Cold War. Translated into ten languages, this classic work‚Äïnow with a new preface by the author‚Äïis "a real contribution to popular understanding of the postwar period" (The Wall Street Journal), and its story of covert cultural efforts to win hearts and minds continues to be relevant today.\n\n&gt;"A major work of investigative history [and] an extremely valuable contribution to the all-important post-World War II record."‚ÄïEdward Said, London Review of Books\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Cultural-Cold-War-World-Letters/dp/1595589147\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Paid_the_Piper%3F\n\n\n&gt;*Ally of the CIA in its ‚Äòcultural war‚Äô in various countries: Rockefeller Foundation, like other US-based orgs like Ford Foundation, use the huge amounts of funds at their disposal to create and change narratives around the world, to benefit the USA. When the USA sets its sight on a government to topple it in order to ‚Äòestablish democracy‚Äô, these foundations are the first to prepare the groundwork for the same, by filling media with articles and opeds on how that country ‚Äòneeds democracy‚Äô.**\n\n&gt;NGOs and educational institutions funded by Rockefeller and Ford Foundations were the hidden arm of the US government to topple democratically-elected governments in Latin America, Iran and Indonesia. In fact, Rockefeller Foundation has been considered an arm of the US govt due to its cooperation in the foreign policy of the govt. Foundation utilises its considerable financial resources to shift the opinions of the policymakers and academics towards something which is more aligned with the interests of the American government.\n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2021/07/rockefeller-foundation-sponsors-anti-modi-govt-article-on-mit-technology-review/\n\n&gt;It is in the interest of Indian citizens to know the background of Rockefeller and Ford Foundations.\n\nMore about Rockefeller Foundation from "Cultural Cold War":\n\n&gt;In the early 20th century, the United States legalized endowed foundations. They were the new lifeguards of Imperialism, or call it Capitalism, under threat from Communism. Among the first to be set up was Carnegie Corporation, endowed in 1911 by profits from Carnegie Steel Company. The Rockefeller Foundation was endowed in 1914 by JD Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil Company.\n\n&gt;**The use of philanthropic foundations was the most convenient way to pass large sums of money to Agency projects without alerting the recipients to their source. By the mid 1950s, the CIA‚Äôs intrusion into the foundation field was massive. Although figures are not available for this period, the general counsel of a 1952 Congress committee appointed to investigate US foundations concluded that ‚ÄòAn unparalleled amount of power is concentrated increasingly in the hands of an interlocking and self-perpetuating group. Unlike the power of corporate management,  it is unchecked by stockholders; unlike the power of government, it is unchecked by the people; unlike the power of the churches, it is unchecked by any firmly established canons of value.‚Äô**\n\n&gt;**In 1976, a Select Committee appointed to investigate US intelligence activities reported on the CIA‚Äôs penetration of the foundation field by the mid-1960s: during 1963-6, of the 700 grants over $10,000 given by 164 foundations, at least 108 involved partial or complete CIA funding. More importantly, CIA funding was involved in nearly half the grants made by these 164 foundations in the field of international activities during the same period.**\n\n&gt;**‚ÄòBona fide‚Äô foundations such as Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie were considered ‚Äòthe best and most plausible kind of funding cover‚Äô. A CIA study of 1966 argued that this technique was ‚Äòparticularly effective for democratically run membership organizations, which need to assure their own unwitting members and collaborators, as well as their hostile critics, that they have genuine, respectable, private sources of income‚Äô. Certainly, it allowed the CIA to fund ‚Äòa seemingly limitless range of covert action programs affecting youth groups, labor unions, universities, publishing houses, and other private institutions‚Äô from the early 1950s.**\n\n&gt;‚ÄòThere was a cover branch at CIA whose job it was to help provide cover, like the foundations we used for our operations,‚Äô Braden explained. ‚ÄòI paid no attention to the details. The Finance Department would handle it, and talk to the cover officer. It was just a mechanism which you used. The Farfield Foundation was one of them. I don‚Äôt know the names of all of them, I can‚Äôt remember. But it was a criss-cross of money. There was never any danger of the\nCIA running out of money.‚Äô\n\n&gt;Farfield was by no means exceptional in its incestuous character. This was the nature of power in America at this time. **The system of private patronage was the pre-eminent model of how small, homogenous groups came to defend America‚Äôs ‚Äì and, by definition, their own ‚Äìinterests. Serving at the top of the pile was every self-respecting WASP‚Äôs ambition. The prize was a trusteeship on either the Ford Foundation or the Rockefeller Foundation, both of which were conscious instruments of covert US foreign policy, with directors and officers who were closely connected to, or even members of American intelligence.**\n\n&gt;**Incorporated in 1936, the Ford Foundation was the tax-exempt cream of the vast Ford fortune, with assets totalling over $3 billion by the late 1950s. Dwight Macdonald described it memorably as ‚Äòa large body of money completely surrounded by people who want some‚Äô. The architects of the foundation‚Äôs cultural policy in the aftermath of the Second World War were perfectly attuned to the political imperatives which supported America‚Äôs looming presence on the world stage. At times, it seemed as if the Ford Foundation was simply an extension of government in the area of international cultural propaganda.**\n\n&gt; **The foundation had a record of close involvement in covert actions in Europe, working closely with Marshall Plan and CIA officials on specific projects. This reciprocity was further extended when Marshall planner Richard Bissell, under whose signature counterpart funds were signed over to Frank Wisner, came to the Ford Foundation in 1952, accurately predicting there was ‚Äònothing to prevent an individual from exerting as much influence through his work in a private foundation as he could through work in the government‚Äô.19 During his tenure at Ford, Bissell met often with Allen Dulles and other CIA officials, including former Groton classmate Tracy Barnes, in a ‚Äòmutual search‚Äô for\nnew ideas. He left suddenly to join the CIA as a special assistant to Allen Dulles in January 1954, but not before he had helped steer the foundation to the vanguard of Cold War thinking.**\n\n&gt;**The Rockefeller Foundation, no less than the Ford, was an integral component of America‚Äôs Cold War machinery. Incorporated in 1913, its principal donor was the legendary John D. Rockefeller III. It had assets exceeding $500 million, not including an additional $150 million in the Rockefeller Brothers Fund Inc., a major think-tank which was incorporated in New York in 1940. In 1957 the fund brought together the most influential minds of the period under a Special Studies Project whose task was to attempt a definition of American foreign policy. Subpanel II was designated to the study of International Security Objectives and Strategy, and its members included Henry and Clare Booth Luce, Laurence Rockefeller, Townsend Hoopes (representing Jock Whitney‚Äôs company), Nelson Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger, Frank Lindsay and William Bundy of the CIA.**\n\n&gt;**The convergence between the Rockefeller billions and the US government exceeded even that of the Ford Foundation. John Foster Dulles and later Dean Rusk both went from the presidency of the Rockefeller Foundation to become secretaries of state. Other Cold War heavies such as John J. McCloy and Robert A. Lovett featured prominently as Rockefeller trustees. Nelson Rockefeller‚Äôs central position on this foundation guaranteed a close relationship with US intelligence circles: he had been in charge of all intelligence in Latin America during the\nSecond World War. Later, his associate in Brazil, Colonel J. C. King, became CIA chief of clandestine activities in the western hemisphere. When Nelson Rockefeller was appointed by Eisenhower to the National Security Council in 1954, his job was to approve various covert operations. If he needed any extra information on CIA-activities, he could simply ask his old friend Allen Dulles for a direct briefing. One of the most controversial of these activities was\nthe CIA‚Äôs MK-ULTRA (or ‚ÄòManchurian Candidate‚Äô) programme of mind-control research during the 1950s. This research was assisted by grants from the Rockefeller Foundation.**\n\n&gt;**The freelance transactions of the foundations at behest of CIA gave new meaning to the practice of governmental buccaneering, and were an inevitable bi-product of the semi-privatization of American foreign policy during these Cold War years.**\n\n&gt; Similarly, **the Council on Foreign Relations developed as a private think-tank made up of America‚Äôs corporate and social elite, which acted as a kind of shadow foreign policy-making unit (other members included\nAllen Dulles, John McCloy and David Rockefeller). An independent think-tan exerted enormous influence on American foreign policy, and which operated (and continues to operate) according to strict confidentiality rules which include a twenty-five-year embargo on the release of its records.**\n\nThe full book can be read here.\n\n https://oxfordre.com/americanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-760\n\nhttps://www.redstarpublishers.org/CulturalColdWar.pdf\n\n*More explanation from OpIndia on why &amp; how US plutocracy decided to use foundations for their foreign policy objectives. OpIndia in turn quotes from Arundhati Roy during the days she was anti- Anna Hazare/Arvind Kejriwal movement whom she had termed as regime changing ops funded by Ford Foundation. Of course, the irony is that Sonia\'s own supercabinet which dictated policies of India was entire composed of individuals funded by the same billionaire philanthropic groups-Rockefeller-Aspen-Soros-Ford, which she blamed for funding Arvind Kejriwal. So it was more like a case of ulta chor kotwal ko daate.\n\n&gt;**Rockefeller Foundation was the early patron which gave seed money to the United Nations, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).These Foundations had massive resources, all tax-free, with an unrestrained brief:  to turn economic muscle into political, cultural and social capital. Massive funds were not there to raise the wages of its workers. It was to turn money into power‚Äîto run the world. (So we have Bill Gates controlling health, education and agricultural policies all over the world from the seemingly dull occupation of selling software).**\n\n*Note: Here Arundhati Roy forgets to mention that the de-facto PM of her own UPA govt was meeting with CFR in secrecy even while sitting in opposition*\n\n\n&gt;**By the 1920s, the US had begun to swoop on overseas markets and its raw materials. In 1924, the Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundations had created the most powerful foreign policy pressure group‚Äîthe Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), later funded by the Ford Foundation as well. So far CFR has had two dozen US secretaries of state on its roll. No less than 5 CFR members were in the 1943 steering committee that planned the UN. JD Rockefeller bought the land for UN‚Äôs New York headquarters at $8.5 million grant.**\n\n&gt;Then came the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement to set up a new international monetary system. Now all other currencies were pegged to the value of the US dollar, which, in turn, was pegged to the price of gold. World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) became the checkpoints of world‚Äôs financial roadways. They demanded Good Governance (with remote in their hands), Rule of Law (as long as they shaped them) and transparent institutions. Ironically, these rules were mandated by two of the most opaque, unaccountable and non-transparent global organizations.  Country after country was cracked open by World Bank for global finance.\n\n&gt; All eleven of the World Bank‚Äôs presidents since 1946‚Äîmen who have presented themselves as missionaries of the poor‚Äîhave been members of the CFR. (The exception was George Woods. And he was a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation and vice-president of Chase-Manhattan Bank.) At Bretton Woods, the World Bank and IMF decided that the US dollar should be the reserve currency of the world\n\n&gt;Given that the World Bank has more or less directed the economic policies of the Third World, coercing and cracking open the markets of country after country for global finance, you could say that corporate philanthropy has turned out to be the most visionary business of all time.\n\n&gt;Corporate-endowed foundations administer, trade and channelise their power and place their chessmen on the chessboard, through a system of elite clubs and think-tanks, whose members overlap and move in and out through the revolving doors. Contrary to the various conspiracy theories in circulation, particularly among left-wing groups, there is nothing secret, satanic, or Freemason-like about this arrangement. It is not very different from the way corporations use shell companies and offshore accounts to transfer and administer their money‚Äîexcept that the currency is power, not money.\n\n&gt;**The transnational equivalent of the CFR is the Trilateral Commission, set up in 1973 by David Rockefeller, the former US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski (founder-member of the Afghan Mujahideen, forefathers of the Taliban), the Chase-Manhattan Bank and some other private eminences. Its purpose was to create an enduring bond of friendship and cooperation between the elites of North America, Europe and Japan. It has now become a penta-lateral commission, because it includes members from China and India. (Tarun Das of the CII; N.R. Narayanamurthy, ex-CEO, Infosys; Jamsheyd N. Godrej, managing director, Godrej; Jamshed J. Irani, director, Tata Sons; and Gautam Thapar, CEO, Avantha Group).**\n\nPersonal note: Godrej, NarayanMurthy and Tata all mentioned here are involved in funding disaffection against Hinduism &amp; India via "civil society"- Godrej via NGOs (Godrej funded LGBTQ NGOs had made a lot of noise during CAA protests &amp; Godrej periodically sponsors virulent "activists" at Harvard &amp; other forums), Tata via TISS &amp; NarayanMurthy via funding of Wire, etc.\n\n&gt;**The Aspen Institute is an international club of local elites, businessmen, bureaucrats, politicians, with franchises in several countries. Tarun Das is the president of the Aspen Institute, India. Gautam Thapar is chairman. Several senior officers of the McKinsey Global Institute (proposer of the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor) are members of the CFR, the Trilateral Commission and the Aspen Institute.**\n\n&gt;It‚Äôs with these lenses you need to view the activity of Ford Foundation which has invested tens of millions of dollars in India. Generous aids are given to specific university courses and scholarships. A lot of these funds go to writers, artists, film-makers and activists.\n\n&gt;These Foundations have made it an art to putting their pieces on the chessboard of a society. Elite clubs and think-tanks are formed. Ford Foundation makes no secret of intervening in grassroots political movements as its avowed ‚Äúgoals for the future of mankind.‚Äù\n\n&gt;It would do us no harm though to remember that Kejriwal-Sisodia have publicly conceded to generous grants by Ford Foundation to their NGO in the past. Captain Amrinder Singh had openly accused that Kejriwal‚Äôs NGO was funded by CIA.\n\n&gt;There‚Äôs a lot of money in poverty, and a few Nobel Prizes too.\n\n&gt;By the 1950s, the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations were in overdrive in funding NGOs and educational institutions around the world. They were the hidden arm of the US government to topple democratically-elected governments in Latin America, Iran and Indonesia. The Indonesian students, trained in counter-insurgency by the US army, played a critical role in effecting CIA-backed coup in Indonesia in 1965 that brought General Suharto to power. Similarly, eight years later, young Chilean students were trained at the University of Chicago (endowed by JD Rockefeller) to do their bit in the CIA-backed coup that killed Salvador Allende and brought General Pinochet and his reign of murders that lasted 17 years.\n\n&gt; Corporate-endowed foundations are the biggest funders of the social sciences and the arts, endowing courses and student scholarships in ‚Äúdevelopment studies‚Äù, ‚Äúcommunity studies‚Äù, ‚Äúcultural studies‚Äù, ‚Äúbehavioural sciences‚Äù and ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù. As US universities opened their doors to international students, hundreds of thousands of students, children of the Third World elite, poured in. Those who could not afford the fees were given scholarships. Scholars of the Foundation-friendly version of economics and political science were rewarded with fellowships, research funds, grants, endowments and jobs. Those with Foundation-unfriendly views found themselves unfunded, marginalised and ghettoised, their courses discontinued.\n\n&gt;One century after it began, corporate philanthropy is as much part of our lives as Coca Cola. There are now millions of non-profit organisations, many of them connected through a byzantine financial maze to the larger foundations. Between them, this ‚Äúindependent‚Äù sector has assets worth nearly 450 billion dollars. The largest of them is the Bill Gates Foundation with ($21 billion), followed by the Lilly Endowment ($16 billion) and the Ford Foundation ($15 billion). As the IMF enforced Structural Adjustment, and arm-twisted governments into cutting back on public spending on health, education, childcare, development, the NGOs moved in.\n\n&gt;These Foundations core philosophy is to prepare an international cadre which could extend Capitalism and the hegemony of the United States. Find natives who once served colonialism and would now do for them. Take over the fields of education, arts and entertainment; extend a hold on the minds of masses. What if it costs millions of dollars? Money is useless if it can‚Äôt buy global power\n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2019/08/ravish-kumar-magsaysay-award-and-connecting-the-dots-the-history-of-ford-foundation-and-rockefeller-brothers-fund/\n\n\n*In summary, Rockefeller Foundation, known as covert US foreign policy arm, tying up with Congress for anti-Modi propaganda.* There are obviously multiple blatant examples of attempts of regime change-but Anna Hazare/Arvind Kejriwal demanding a Rockefeller selected members to lead unelected supergovt Lokpal would perhaps count as the most blatant.'<br />Author: 'vcr48'  id: 'op9wyy'<br />Score:121<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/op9wyy/antimodi_article_in_mit_fechnology_review_by/</li>

Translated into ten languages, this classic work‚Äïnow with a new preface by the author‚Äïis "a real contribution to popular understanding of the postwar period" (The Wall Street Journal), and its story of covert cultural efforts to win hearts and minds continues to be relevant today.\n\n&gt;"A major work of investigative history [and] an extremely valuable contribution to the all-important post-World War II record."‚ÄïEdward Said, London Review of Books\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Cultural-Cold-War-World-Letters/dp/1595589147\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Paid_the_Piper%3F\n\n\n&gt;*Ally of the CIA in its ‚Äòcultural war‚Äô in various countries: Rockefeller Foundation, like other US-based orgs like Ford Foundation, use the huge amounts of funds at their disposal to create and change narratives around the world, to benefit the USA. When the USA sets its sight on a government to topple it in order to ‚Äòestablish democracy‚Äô, these foundations are the first to prepare the groundwork for the same, by filling media with articles and opeds on how that country ‚Äòneeds democracy‚Äô.**\n\n&gt;NGOs and educational institutions funded by Rockefeller and Ford Foundations were the hidden arm of the US government to topple democratically-elected governments in Latin America, Iran and Indonesia. In fact, Rockefeller Foundation has been considered an arm of the US govt due to its cooperation in the foreign policy of the govt. Foundation utilises its considerable financial resources to shift the opinions of the policymakers and academics towards something which is more aligned with the interests of the American government.\n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2021/07/rockefeller-foundation-sponsors-anti-modi-govt-article-on-mit-technology-review/\n\n&gt;It is in the interest of Indian citizens to know the background of Rockefeller and Ford Foundations.\n\nMore about Rockefeller Foundation from "Cultural Cold War":\n\n&gt;In the early 20th century, the United States legalized endowed foundations. They were the new lifeguards of Imperialism, or call it Capitalism, under threat from Communism. Among the first to be set up was Carnegie Corporation, endowed in 1911 by profits from Carnegie Steel Company. The Rockefeller Foundation was endowed in 1914 by JD Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil Company.\n\n&gt;**The use of philanthropic foundations was the most convenient way to pass large sums of money to Agency projects without alerting the recipients to their source. By the mid 1950s, the CIA‚Äôs intrusion into the foundation field was massive. Although figures are not available for this period, the general counsel of a 1952 Congress committee appointed to investigate US foundations concluded that ‚ÄòAn unparalleled amount of power is concentrated increasingly in the hands of an interlocking and self-perpetuating group. Unlike the power of corporate management,  it is unchecked by stockholders; unlike the power of government, it is unchecked by the people; unlike the power of the churches, it is unchecked by any firmly established canons of value.‚Äô**\n\n&gt;**In 1976, a Select Committee appointed to investigate US intelligence activities reported on the CIA‚Äôs penetration of the foundation field by the mid-1960s: during 1963-6, of the 700 grants over $10,000 given by 164 foundations, at least 108 involved partial or complete CIA funding. More importantly, CIA funding was involved in nearly half the grants made by these 164 foundations in the field of international activities during the same period.**\n\n&gt;**‚ÄòBona fide‚Äô foundations such as Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie were considered ‚Äòthe best and most plausible kind of funding cover‚Äô. A CIA study of 1966 argued that this technique was ‚Äòparticularly effective for democratically run membership organizations, which need to assure their own unwitting members and collaborators, as well as their hostile critics, that they have genuine, respectable, private sources of income‚Äô. Certainly, it allowed the CIA to fund ‚Äòa seemingly limitless range of covert action programs affecting youth groups, labor unions, universities, publishing houses, and other private institutions‚Äô from the early 1950s.**\n\n&gt;‚ÄòThere was a cover branch at CIA whose job it was to help provide cover, like the foundations we used for our operations,‚Äô Braden explained. ‚ÄòI paid no attention to the details. The Finance Department would handle it, and talk to the cover officer. It was just a mechanism which you used. The Farfield Foundation was one of them. I don‚Äôt know the names of all of them, I can‚Äôt remember. But it was a criss-cross of money. There was never any danger of the\nCIA running out of money.‚Äô\n\n&gt;Farfield was by no means exceptional in its incestuous character. This was the nature of power in America at this time. **The system of private patronage was the pre-eminent model of how small, homogenous groups came to defend America‚Äôs ‚Äì and, by definition, their own ‚Äìinterests. Serving at the top of the pile was every self-respecting WASP‚Äôs ambition. The prize was a trusteeship on either the Ford Foundation or the Rockefeller Foundation, both of which were conscious instruments of covert US foreign policy, with directors and officers who were closely connected to, or even members of American intelligence.**\n\n&gt;**Incorporated in 1936, the Ford Foundation was the tax-exempt cream of the vast Ford fortune, with assets totalling over $3 billion by the late 1950s. Dwight Macdonald described it memorably as ‚Äòa large body of money completely surrounded by people who want some‚Äô. The architects of the foundation‚Äôs cultural policy in the aftermath of the Second World War were perfectly attuned to the political imperatives which supported America‚Äôs looming presence on the world stage. At times, it seemed as if the Ford Foundation was simply an extension of government in the area of international cultural propaganda.**\n\n&gt; **The foundation had a record of close involvement in covert actions in Europe, working closely with Marshall Plan and CIA officials on specific projects. This reciprocity was further extended when Marshall planner Richard Bissell, under whose signature counterpart funds were signed over to Frank Wisner, came to the Ford Foundation in 1952, accurately predicting there was ‚Äònothing to prevent an individual from exerting as much influence through his work in a private foundation as he could through work in the government‚Äô.19 During his tenure at Ford, Bissell met often with Allen Dulles and other CIA officials, including former Groton classmate Tracy Barnes, in a ‚Äòmutual search‚Äô for\nnew ideas. He left suddenly to join the CIA as a special assistant to Allen Dulles in January 1954, but not before he had helped steer the foundation to the vanguard of Cold War thinking.**\n\n&gt;**The Rockefeller Foundation, no less than the Ford, was an integral component of America‚Äôs Cold War machinery. Incorporated in 1913, its principal donor was the legendary John D. Rockefeller III. It had assets exceeding $500 million, not including an additional $150 million in the Rockefeller Brothers Fund Inc., a major think-tank which was incorporated in New York in 1940. In 1957 the fund brought together the most influential minds of the period under a Special Studies Project whose task was to attempt a definition of American foreign policy. Subpanel II was designated to the study of International Security Objectives and Strategy, and its members included Henry and Clare Booth Luce, Laurence Rockefeller, Townsend Hoopes (representing Jock Whitney‚Äôs company), Nelson Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger, Frank Lindsay and William Bundy of the CIA.**\n\n&gt;**The convergence between the Rockefeller billions and the US government exceeded even that of the Ford Foundation. John Foster Dulles and later Dean Rusk both went from the presidency of the Rockefeller Foundation to become secretaries of state. Other Cold War heavies such as John J. McCloy and Robert A. Lovett featured prominently as Rockefeller trustees. Nelson Rockefeller‚Äôs central position on this foundation guaranteed a close relationship with US intelligence circles: he had been in charge of all intelligence in Latin America during the\nSecond World War. Later, his associate in Brazil, Colonel J. C. King, became CIA chief of clandestine activities in the western hemisphere. When Nelson Rockefeller was appointed by Eisenhower to the National Security Council in 1954, his job was to approve various covert operations. If he needed any extra information on CIA-activities, he could simply ask his old friend Allen Dulles for a direct briefing. One of the most controversial of these activities was\nthe CIA‚Äôs MK-ULTRA (or ‚ÄòManchurian Candidate‚Äô) programme of mind-control research during the 1950s. This research was assisted by grants from the Rockefeller Foundation.**\n\n&gt;**The freelance transactions of the foundations at behest of CIA gave new meaning to the practice of governmental buccaneering, and were an inevitable bi-product of the semi-privatization of American foreign policy during these Cold War years.**\n\n&gt; Similarly, **the Council on Foreign Relations developed as a private think-tank made up of America‚Äôs corporate and social elite, which acted as a kind of shadow foreign policy-making unit (other members included\nAllen Dulles, John McCloy and David Rockefeller). An independent think-tan exerted enormous influence on American foreign policy, and which operated (and continues to operate) according to strict confidentiality rules which include a twenty-five-year embargo on the release of its records.**\n\nThe full book can be read here.\n\n https://oxfordre.com/americanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-760\n\nhttps://www.redstarpublishers.org/CulturalColdWar.pdf\n\n*More explanation from OpIndia on why &amp; how US plutocracy decided to use foundations for their foreign policy objectives. OpIndia in turn quotes from Arundhati Roy during the days she was anti- Anna Hazare/Arvind Kejriwal movement whom she had termed as regime changing ops funded by Ford Foundation. Of course, the irony is that Sonia\'s own supercabinet which dictated policies of India was entire composed of individuals funded by the same billionaire philanthropic groups-Rockefeller-Aspen-Soros-Ford, which she blamed for funding Arvind Kejriwal. So it was more like a case of ulta chor kotwal ko daate.\n\n&gt;**Rockefeller Foundation was the early patron which gave seed money to the United Nations, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).These Foundations had massive resources, all tax-free, with an unrestrained brief:  to turn economic muscle into political, cultural and social capital. Massive funds were not there to raise the wages of its workers. It was to turn money into power‚Äîto run the world. (So we have Bill Gates controlling health, education and agricultural policies all over the world from the seemingly dull occupation of selling software).**\n\n*Note: Here Arundhati Roy forgets to mention that the de-facto PM of her own UPA govt was meeting with CFR in secrecy even while sitting in opposition*\n\n\n&gt;**By the 1920s, the US had begun to swoop on overseas markets and its raw materials. In 1924, the Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundations had created the most powerful foreign policy pressure group‚Äîthe Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), later funded by the Ford Foundation as well. So far CFR has had two dozen US secretaries of state on its roll. No less than 5 CFR members were in the 1943 steering committee that planned the UN. JD Rockefeller bought the land for UN‚Äôs New York headquarters at $8.5 million grant.**\n\n&gt;Then came the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement to set up a new international monetary system. Now all other currencies were pegged to the value of the US dollar, which, in turn, was pegged to the price of gold. World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) became the checkpoints of world‚Äôs financial roadways. They demanded Good Governance (with remote in their hands), Rule of Law (as long as they shaped them) and transparent institutions. Ironically, these rules were mandated by two of the most opaque, unaccountable and non-transparent global organizations.  Country after country was cracked open by World Bank for global finance.\n\n&gt; All eleven of the World Bank‚Äôs presidents since 1946‚Äîmen who have presented themselves as missionaries of the poor‚Äîhave been members of the CFR. (The exception was George Woods. And he was a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation and vice-president of Chase-Manhattan Bank.) At Bretton Woods, the World Bank and IMF decided that the US dollar should be the reserve currency of the world\n\n&gt;Given that the World Bank has more or less directed the economic policies of the Third World, coercing and cracking open the markets of country after country for global finance, you could say that corporate philanthropy has turned out to be the most visionary business of all time.\n\n&gt;Corporate-endowed foundations administer, trade and channelise their power and place their chessmen on the chessboard, through a system of elite clubs and think-tanks, whose members overlap and move in and out through the revolving doors. Contrary to the various conspiracy theories in circulation, particularly among left-wing groups, there is nothing secret, satanic, or Freemason-like about this arrangement. It is not very different from the way corporations use shell companies and offshore accounts to transfer and administer their money‚Äîexcept that the currency is power, not money.\n\n&gt;**The transnational equivalent of the CFR is the Trilateral Commission, set up in 1973 by David Rockefeller, the former US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski (founder-member of the Afghan Mujahideen, forefathers of the Taliban), the Chase-Manhattan Bank and some other private eminences. Its purpose was to create an enduring bond of friendship and cooperation between the elites of North America, Europe and Japan. It has now become a penta-lateral commission, because it includes members from China and India. (Tarun Das of the CII; N.R. Narayanamurthy, ex-CEO, Infosys; Jamsheyd N. Godrej, managing director, Godrej; Jamshed J. Irani, director, Tata Sons; and Gautam Thapar, CEO, Avantha Group).**\n\nPersonal note: Godrej, NarayanMurthy and Tata all mentioned here are involved in funding disaffection against Hinduism &amp; India via "civil society"- Godrej via NGOs (Godrej funded LGBTQ NGOs had made a lot of noise during CAA protests &amp; Godrej periodically sponsors virulent "activists" at Harvard &amp; other forums), Tata via TISS &amp; NarayanMurthy via funding of Wire, etc.\n\n&gt;**The Aspen Institute is an international club of local elites, businessmen, bureaucrats, politicians, with franchises in several countries. Tarun Das is the president of the Aspen Institute, India. Gautam Thapar is chairman. Several senior officers of the McKinsey Global Institute (proposer of the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor) are members of the CFR, the Trilateral Commission and the Aspen Institute.**\n\n&gt;It‚Äôs with these lenses you need to view the activity of Ford Foundation which has invested tens of millions of dollars in India. Generous aids are given to specific university courses and scholarships. A lot of these funds go to writers, artists, film-makers and activists.\n\n&gt;These Foundations have made it an art to putting their pieces on the chessboard of a society. Elite clubs and think-tanks are formed. Ford Foundation makes no secret of intervening in grassroots political movements as its avowed ‚Äúgoals for the future of mankind.‚Äù\n\n&gt;It would do us no harm though to remember that Kejriwal-Sisodia have publicly conceded to generous grants by Ford Foundation to their NGO in the past. Captain Amrinder Singh had openly accused that Kejriwal‚Äôs NGO was funded by CIA.\n\n&gt;There‚Äôs a lot of money in poverty, and a few Nobel Prizes too.\n\n&gt;By the 1950s, the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations were in overdrive in funding NGOs and educational institutions around the world. They were the hidden arm of the US government to topple democratically-elected governments in Latin America, Iran and Indonesia. The Indonesian students, trained in counter-insurgency by the US army, played a critical role in effecting CIA-backed coup in Indonesia in 1965 that brought General Suharto to power. Similarly, eight years later, young Chilean students were trained at the University of Chicago (endowed by JD Rockefeller) to do their bit in the CIA-backed coup that killed Salvador Allende and brought General Pinochet and his reign of murders that lasted 17 years.\n\n&gt; Corporate-endowed foundations are the biggest funders of the social sciences and the arts, endowing courses and student scholarships in ‚Äúdevelopment studies‚Äù, ‚Äúcommunity studies‚Äù, ‚Äúcultural studies‚Äù, ‚Äúbehavioural sciences‚Äù and ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù. As US universities opened their doors to international students, hundreds of thousands of students, children of the Third World elite, poured in. Those who could not afford the fees were given scholarships. Scholars of the Foundation-friendly version of economics and political science were rewarded with fellowships, research funds, grants, endowments and jobs. Those with Foundation-unfriendly views found themselves unfunded, marginalised and ghettoised, their courses discontinued.\n\n&gt;One century after it began, corporate philanthropy is as much part of our lives as Coca Cola. There are now millions of non-profit organisations, many of them connected through a byzantine financial maze to the larger foundations. Between them, this ‚Äúindependent‚Äù sector has assets worth nearly 450 billion dollars. The largest of them is the Bill Gates Foundation with ($21 billion), followed by the Lilly Endowment ($16 billion) and the Ford Foundation ($15 billion). As the IMF enforced Structural Adjustment, and arm-twisted governments into cutting back on public spending on health, education, childcare, development, the NGOs moved in.\n\n&gt;These Foundations core philosophy is to prepare an international cadre which could extend Capitalism and the hegemony of the United States. Find natives who once served colonialism and would now do for them. Take over the fields of education, arts and entertainment; extend a hold on the minds of masses. What if it costs millions of dollars? Money is useless if it can‚Äôt buy global power\n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2019/08/ravish-kumar-magsaysay-award-and-connecting-the-dots-the-history-of-ford-foundation-and-rockefeller-brothers-fund/\n\n\n*In summary, Rockefeller Foundation, known as covert US foreign policy arm, tying up with Congress for anti-Modi propaganda.* There are obviously multiple blatant examples of attempts of regime change-but Anna Hazare/Arvind Kejriwal demanding a Rockefeller selected members to lead unelected supergovt Lokpal would perhaps count as the most blatant.'<br />Author: 'vcr48'  id: 'op8n4s'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/op8n4s/antimodi_article_in_mit_fechnology_review_by/</li>

When the USA sets its sight on a government to topple it in order to ‚Äòestablish democracy‚Äô, these foundations are the first to prepare the groundwork for the same, by filling media with articles and opeds on how that country ‚Äòneeds democracy‚Äô.**\n\n&gt;NGOs and educational institutions funded by Rockefeller and Ford Foundations were the hidden arm of the US government to topple democratically-elected governments in Latin America, Iran and Indonesia. In fact, Rockefeller Foundation has been considered an arm of the US govt due to its cooperation in the foreign policy of the govt. Foundation utilises its considerable financial resources to shift the opinions of the policymakers and academics towards something which is more aligned with the interests of the American government.\n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2021/07/rockefeller-foundation-sponsors-anti-modi-govt-article-on-mit-technology-review/\n\n&gt;It is in the interest of Indian citizens to know the background of Rockefeller and Ford Foundations.\n\nMore about Rockefeller Foundation from "Cultural Cold War":\n\n&gt;In the early 20th century, the United States legalized endowed foundations. They were the new lifeguards of Imperialism, or call it Capitalism, under threat from Communism. Among the first to be set up was Carnegie Corporation, endowed in 1911 by profits from Carnegie Steel Company. The Rockefeller Foundation was endowed in 1914 by JD Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil Company.\n\n&gt;**The use of philanthropic foundations was the most convenient way to pass large sums of money to Agency projects without alerting the recipients to their source. By the mid 1950s, the CIA‚Äôs intrusion into the foundation field was massive. Although figures are not available for this period, the general counsel of a 1952 Congress committee appointed to investigate US foundations concluded that ‚ÄòAn unparalleled amount of power is concentrated increasingly in the hands of an interlocking and self-perpetuating group. Unlike the power of corporate management,  it is unchecked by stockholders; unlike the power of government, it is unchecked by the people; unlike the power of the churches, it is unchecked by any firmly established canons of value.‚Äô**\n\n&gt;**In 1976, a Select Committee appointed to investigate US intelligence activities reported on the CIA‚Äôs penetration of the foundation field by the mid-1960s: during 1963-6, of the 700 grants over $10,000 given by 164 foundations, at least 108 involved partial or complete CIA funding. More importantly, CIA funding was involved in nearly half the grants made by these 164 foundations in the field of international activities during the same period.**\n\n&gt;**‚ÄòBona fide‚Äô foundations such as Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie were considered ‚Äòthe best and most plausible kind of funding cover‚Äô. A CIA study of 1966 argued that this technique was ‚Äòparticularly effective for democratically run membership organizations, which need to assure their own unwitting members and collaborators, as well as their hostile critics, that they have genuine, respectable, private sources of income‚Äô. Certainly, it allowed the CIA to fund ‚Äòa seemingly limitless range of covert action programs affecting youth groups, labor unions, universities, publishing houses, and other private institutions‚Äô from the early 1950s.**\n\n&gt;‚ÄòThere was a cover branch at CIA whose job it was to help provide cover, like the foundations we used for our operations,‚Äô Braden explained. ‚ÄòI paid no attention to the details. The Finance Department would handle it, and talk to the cover officer. It was just a mechanism which you used. The Farfield Foundation was one of them. I don‚Äôt know the names of all of them, I can‚Äôt remember. But it was a criss-cross of money. There was never any danger of the\nCIA running out of money.‚Äô\n\n&gt;Farfield was by no means exceptional in its incestuous character. This was the nature of power in America at this time. **The system of private patronage was the pre-eminent model of how small, homogenous groups came to defend America‚Äôs ‚Äì and, by definition, their own ‚Äìinterests. Serving at the top of the pile was every self-respecting WASP‚Äôs ambition. The prize was a trusteeship on either the Ford Foundation or the Rockefeller Foundation, both of which were conscious instruments of covert US foreign policy, with directors and officers who were closely connected to, or even members of American intelligence.**\n\n&gt;**Incorporated in 1936, the Ford Foundation was the tax-exempt cream of the vast Ford fortune, with assets totalling over $3 billion by the late 1950s. Dwight Macdonald described it memorably as ‚Äòa large body of money completely surrounded by people who want some‚Äô. The architects of the foundation‚Äôs cultural policy in the aftermath of the Second World War were perfectly attuned to the political imperatives which supported America‚Äôs looming presence on the world stage. At times, it seemed as if the Ford Foundation was simply an extension of government in the area of international cultural propaganda.**\n\n&gt; **The foundation had a record of close involvement in covert actions in Europe, working closely with Marshall Plan and CIA officials on specific projects. This reciprocity was further extended when Marshall planner Richard Bissell, under whose signature counterpart funds were signed over to Frank Wisner, came to the Ford Foundation in 1952, accurately predicting there was ‚Äònothing to prevent an individual from exerting as much influence through his work in a private foundation as he could through work in the government‚Äô.19 During his tenure at Ford, Bissell met often with Allen Dulles and other CIA officials, including former Groton classmate Tracy Barnes, in a ‚Äòmutual search‚Äô for\nnew ideas. He left suddenly to join the CIA as a special assistant to Allen Dulles in January 1954, but not before he had helped steer the foundation to the vanguard of Cold War thinking.**\n\n&gt;**The Rockefeller Foundation, no less than the Ford, was an integral component of America‚Äôs Cold War machinery. Incorporated in 1913, its principal donor was the legendary John D. Rockefeller III. It had assets exceeding $500 million, not including an additional $150 million in the Rockefeller Brothers Fund Inc., a major think-tank which was incorporated in New York in 1940. In 1957 the fund brought together the most influential minds of the period under a Special Studies Project whose task was to attempt a definition of American foreign policy. Subpanel II was designated to the study of International Security Objectives and Strategy, and its members included Henry and Clare Booth Luce, Laurence Rockefeller, Townsend Hoopes (representing Jock Whitney‚Äôs company), Nelson Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger, Frank Lindsay and William Bundy of the CIA.**\n\n&gt;**The convergence between the Rockefeller billions and the US government exceeded even that of the Ford Foundation. John Foster Dulles and later Dean Rusk both went from the presidency of the Rockefeller Foundation to become secretaries of state. Other Cold War heavies such as John J. McCloy and Robert A. Lovett featured prominently as Rockefeller trustees. Nelson Rockefeller‚Äôs central position on this foundation guaranteed a close relationship with US intelligence circles: he had been in charge of all intelligence in Latin America during the\nSecond World War. Later, his associate in Brazil, Colonel J. C. King, became CIA chief of clandestine activities in the western hemisphere. When Nelson Rockefeller was appointed by Eisenhower to the National Security Council in 1954, his job was to approve various covert operations. If he needed any extra information on CIA-activities, he could simply ask his old friend Allen Dulles for a direct briefing. One of the most controversial of these activities was\nthe CIA‚Äôs MK-ULTRA (or ‚ÄòManchurian Candidate‚Äô) programme of mind-control research during the 1950s. This research was assisted by grants from the Rockefeller Foundation.**\n\n&gt;**The freelance transactions of the foundations at behest of CIA gave new meaning to the practice of governmental buccaneering, and were an inevitable bi-product of the semi-privatization of American foreign policy during these Cold War years.**\n\n&gt; Similarly, **the Council on Foreign Relations developed as a private think-tank made up of America‚Äôs corporate and social elite, which acted as a kind of shadow foreign policy-making unit (other members included\nAllen Dulles, John McCloy and David Rockefeller). An independent think-tan exerted enormous influence on American foreign policy, and which operated (and continues to operate) according to strict confidentiality rules which include a twenty-five-year embargo on the release of its records.**\n\nThe full book can be read here.\n\n https://oxfordre.com/americanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-760\n\nhttps://www.redstarpublishers.org/CulturalColdWar.pdf\n\n*More explanation from OpIndia on why &amp; how US plutocracy decided to use foundations for their foreign policy objectives. OpIndia in turn quotes from Arundhati Roy during the days she was anti- Anna Hazare/Arvind Kejriwal movement whom she had termed as regime changing ops funded by Ford Foundation. Of course, the irony is that Sonia\'s own supercabinet which dictated policies of India was entire composed of individuals funded by the same billionaire philanthropic groups-Rockefeller-Aspen-Soros-Ford, which she blamed for funding Arvind Kejriwal. So it was more like a case of ulta chor kotwal ko daate.\n\n&gt;**Rockefeller Foundation was the early patron which gave seed money to the United Nations, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).These Foundations had massive resources, all tax-free, with an unrestrained brief:  to turn economic muscle into political, cultural and social capital. Massive funds were not there to raise the wages of its workers. It was to turn money into power‚Äîto run the world. (So we have Bill Gates controlling health, education and agricultural policies all over the world from the seemingly dull occupation of selling software).**\n\n*Note: Here Arundhati Roy forgets to mention that the de-facto PM of her own UPA govt was meeting with CFR in secrecy even while sitting in opposition*\n\n\n&gt;**By the 1920s, the US had begun to swoop on overseas markets and its raw materials. In 1924, the Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundations had created the most powerful foreign policy pressure group‚Äîthe Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), later funded by the Ford Foundation as well. So far CFR has had two dozen US secretaries of state on its roll. No less than 5 CFR members were in the 1943 steering committee that planned the UN. JD Rockefeller bought the land for UN‚Äôs New York headquarters at $8.5 million grant.**\n\n&gt;Then came the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement to set up a new international monetary system. Now all other currencies were pegged to the value of the US dollar, which, in turn, was pegged to the price of gold. World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) became the checkpoints of world‚Äôs financial roadways. They demanded Good Governance (with remote in their hands), Rule of Law (as long as they shaped them) and transparent institutions. Ironically, these rules were mandated by two of the most opaque, unaccountable and non-transparent global organizations.  Country after country was cracked open by World Bank for global finance.\n\n&gt; All eleven of the World Bank‚Äôs presidents since 1946‚Äîmen who have presented themselves as missionaries of the poor‚Äîhave been members of the CFR. (The exception was George Woods. And he was a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation and vice-president of Chase-Manhattan Bank.) At Bretton Woods, the World Bank and IMF decided that the US dollar should be the reserve currency of the world\n\n&gt;Given that the World Bank has more or less directed the economic policies of the Third World, coercing and cracking open the markets of country after country for global finance, you could say that corporate philanthropy has turned out to be the most visionary business of all time.\n\n&gt;Corporate-endowed foundations administer, trade and channelise their power and place their chessmen on the chessboard, through a system of elite clubs and think-tanks, whose members overlap and move in and out through the revolving doors. Contrary to the various conspiracy theories in circulation, particularly among left-wing groups, there is nothing secret, satanic, or Freemason-like about this arrangement. It is not very different from the way corporations use shell companies and offshore accounts to transfer and administer their money‚Äîexcept that the currency is power, not money.\n\n&gt;**The transnational equivalent of the CFR is the Trilateral Commission, set up in 1973 by David Rockefeller, the former US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski (founder-member of the Afghan Mujahideen, forefathers of the Taliban), the Chase-Manhattan Bank and some other private eminences. Its purpose was to create an enduring bond of friendship and cooperation between the elites of North America, Europe and Japan. It has now become a penta-lateral commission, because it includes members from China and India. (Tarun Das of the CII; N.R. Narayanamurthy, ex-CEO, Infosys; Jamsheyd N. Godrej, managing director, Godrej; Jamshed J. Irani, director, Tata Sons; and Gautam Thapar, CEO, Avantha Group).**\n\nPersonal note: Godrej, NarayanMurthy and Tata all mentioned here are involved in funding disaffection against Hinduism &amp; India via "civil society"- Godrej via NGOs (Godrej funded LGBTQ NGOs had made a lot of noise during CAA protests &amp; Godrej periodically sponsors virulent "activists" at Harvard &amp; other forums), Tata via TISS &amp; NarayanMurthy via funding of Wire, etc.\n\n&gt;**The Aspen Institute is an international club of local elites, businessmen, bureaucrats, politicians, with franchises in several countries. Tarun Das is the president of the Aspen Institute, India. Gautam Thapar is chairman. Several senior officers of the McKinsey Global Institute (proposer of the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor) are members of the CFR, the Trilateral Commission and the Aspen Institute.**\n\n&gt;It‚Äôs with these lenses you need to view the activity of Ford Foundation which has invested tens of millions of dollars in India. Generous aids are given to specific university courses and scholarships. A lot of these funds go to writers, artists, film-makers and activists.\n\n&gt;These Foundations have made it an art to putting their pieces on the chessboard of a society. Elite clubs and think-tanks are formed. Ford Foundation makes no secret of intervening in grassroots political movements as its avowed ‚Äúgoals for the future of mankind.‚Äù\n\n&gt;It would do us no harm though to remember that Kejriwal-Sisodia have publicly conceded to generous grants by Ford Foundation to their NGO in the past. Captain Amrinder Singh had openly accused that Kejriwal‚Äôs NGO was funded by CIA.\n\n&gt;There‚Äôs a lot of money in poverty, and a few Nobel Prizes too.\n\n&gt;By the 1950s, the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations were in overdrive in funding NGOs and educational institutions around the world. They were the hidden arm of the US government to topple democratically-elected governments in Latin America, Iran and Indonesia. The Indonesian students, trained in counter-insurgency by the US army, played a critical role in effecting CIA-backed coup in Indonesia in 1965 that brought General Suharto to power. Similarly, eight years later, young Chilean students were trained at the University of Chicago (endowed by JD Rockefeller) to do their bit in the CIA-backed coup that killed Salvador Allende and brought General Pinochet and his reign of murders that lasted 17 years.\n\n&gt; Corporate-endowed foundations are the biggest funders of the social sciences and the arts, endowing courses and student scholarships in ‚Äúdevelopment studies‚Äù, ‚Äúcommunity studies‚Äù, ‚Äúcultural studies‚Äù, ‚Äúbehavioural sciences‚Äù and ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù. As US universities opened their doors to international students, hundreds of thousands of students, children of the Third World elite, poured in. Those who could not afford the fees were given scholarships. Scholars of the Foundation-friendly version of economics and political science were rewarded with fellowships, research funds, grants, endowments and jobs. Those with Foundation-unfriendly views found themselves unfunded, marginalised and ghettoised, their courses discontinued.\n\n&gt;One century after it began, corporate philanthropy is as much part of our lives as Coca Cola. There are now millions of non-profit organisations, many of them connected through a byzantine financial maze to the larger foundations. Between them, this ‚Äúindependent‚Äù sector has assets worth nearly 450 billion dollars. The largest of them is the Bill Gates Foundation with ($21 billion), followed by the Lilly Endowment ($16 billion) and the Ford Foundation ($15 billion). As the IMF enforced Structural Adjustment, and arm-twisted governments into cutting back on public spending on health, education, childcare, development, the NGOs moved in.\n\n&gt;These Foundations core philosophy is to prepare an international cadre which could extend Capitalism and the hegemony of the United States. Find natives who once served colonialism and would now do for them. Take over the fields of education, arts and entertainment; extend a hold on the minds of masses. What if it costs millions of dollars? Money is useless if it can‚Äôt buy global power\n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2019/08/ravish-kumar-magsaysay-award-and-connecting-the-dots-the-history-of-ford-foundation-and-rockefeller-brothers-fund/\n\n\n*In summary, Rockefeller Foundation, known as covert US foreign policy arm, tying up with Congress for anti-Modi propaganda.* There are obviously multiple blatant examples of attempts of regime change, and I definitely can\'t say this is the most blatant example (Anna Hazare/Arvind Kejriwal demanding a Rockefeller selected members to lead unelected supergovt Lokpal would perhaps count as even more blatant), but this certainly is right up there in blatantness, if not in impact.'<br />Author: 'vcr48'  id: 'op88dg'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/op88dg/antimodi_article_in_mit_fechnology_review_by/</li>
      <li>Title::: "'Islamic Theology ‚Äì The Root of Islamic Fundamentalism'"<br />Body: "*This is part 6 of the earlier article 'On the Nature of Islam'. This is a tract written on the Nature of Islam in context of the rising Islamic terrorism the world over in 2002. This article discusses the theological foundations of Islamic fundamentalism. They are ultimately primed for conversion to Islam. Note: Krishnaswami is a penname of an author, who for more spiritual than political reasons, shall remain anonymous.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bfzb9826ipc71.png?width=735&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=689c3d7d8ae64a5e16ae9aea092ebbed71d2b3be\n\nIt is necessary to make the distinction between Muslims and Islam. The two are not identical. In fact Muslims are the victims of the Islamic ideology. Therefore it is important to trace the Muslim behaviour pattern back to the Islamic belief system. Three Islamic thought-categories form the very foundation of Islamic theology and its belief system and it is these thought-categories which are primarily responsible for the intolerant and violent behaviour of the Muslims.\n\n1. Islamic theology divides human family into two incompatible and hostile factions. There are Muslim believers on the one hand who are Allah‚Äôs favourites to whom he has promised victory in this world and paradise hereafter. On the other hand, there are The Kafirs whose lives, liberties, properties and honour has been forfeited by Allah in favour of the faithful. Muslims can have a clean conscience when they slaughter, plunder, loot and enslave the Kafirs by every means and in every way. They are only fulfilling Allah‚Äôs inexorable will.\n\nThis aggressive war against **Kafirs** was held up by the Prophet as superior to all meritorious deeds such as prayer, fasting, pilgrimage etc. The Muslim who kills ‚ÄòKafirs‚Äô in Jihad is honored as **‚ÄòGhazi‚Äô** and enjoys a higher status in Muslim society i.e. **‚ÄòUmmah‚Äô**. The Muslim who gets killed in a jihad becomes a **‚ÄòShahid‚Äô** (martyr) and goes straight to Koranic paradise without having to wait for the Day of the Judgment like the rest of the Muslims. And in the paradise he gets seventy virgins and a number of young handsome boys for his enjoyment. **Therefore, Jiahd is salvation through murder and suicide.** Hence, we find suicide squads and Islamic belly-bombers around the world killing innocent children and women.\n\nThe captured Kafir women, snatched from their husbands, can be enjoyed with absolute impunity by the Muslims, in fact such acts are made lawful by Allah himself (Koran 4:24).\n\nThe captured Kafir children are the property of their master, who could dispose of them, as he like, selling them, gifting them away, hiring them out, lending them and mortgaging them. The master has the right to live in concubinage with his female slaves. The Koran (4:3, 4:24, 4:25, 23:6) has permitted this practice. The Prophet himself possessed at least fifty-nine slaves at one stage or another both male and female. Mirkhond, the Prophet‚Äôs fifteenth-century biographer, names them all in his ‚ÄúRauzat-us-Safa‚Äù.\n\nIslam knows no co-operation on the basis of equality or co-existence with the kafirs to whom it offers at most four alternatives: 1. Conversion to Islam 2. Death by sword 3. Slavery 4. Pay exploitative religious tax **Jaziah**, and to become **Dhimmi**, that is, to accept the status of second class citizen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Islamic theology divides the inhabited world into two irreconcilable camps. On the one hand, there is the Dar-ul-Islam, the land held by Muslims where the Shariat rules. This is the base from which Muslims operate. On the other hand, there is Dar-ul-Harb, the lands in which kafirs live and which the Muslims should subject to non-stop war. The Muslims should spare neither their persons nor their properties in the effort to convert every Dar-ul-Harb to Dar-ul-Islam. Thus Islam postulates ‚ÄòJihad bil Saif‚Äô (striving by the sword) the permanent war between these divisions, till all the kafirs are either converted or killed and their women, wealth and lands taken away.\n\nThe Prophet Mohammed claimed that one of the six points of his superiority over earlier prophets was that while loot was not lawful for them, Allah had made it so for him **‚ÄúEat you the spoils of war, it is lawful and pure‚Äù (Koran 8:69)**. He also laid down the rule according to which one-fifth of the loot belonged to Allah and his Prophet (Koran 8:41), while the remaining four-fifths was to be divided among those who took part in the raid which brought the loot. This ‚Äúsacred one-fifth‚Äù came to be known as the **‚ÄòKhams‚Äô** which became in the later times one of the four main sources of revenue for the Islamic state.\n\nAccording to the Hadis collections the main Jihad bil Saif, that is, Jihad by sword is to be supported by three other forms of Jihad, they are ‚Äì\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Jihad bil nafs‚Äì that is, cursing the Kafirs silently or in private if conditions do not permit them publicly by means of speech and writing, etc.\n2. Jihad bil lasan‚Äì that is, preaching against Kafirs publicly, passing pejorative labels on them and threatening them with the defeat and disgrace which await them in this world, and the doom hereafter. This is exactly the type of Jihad conducted by Islamic Madarsas (Islamic schools for teaching theology) throughout India and State Governments provide them financial aid in the name of secularism. This is one more example of how Hindu tax payer‚Äôs money is used against him by the Pseudo-secular State.\n3. Jihad bil Qalam‚Äì that is writing down on paper and other materials what Faithful Muslim has harbored in his heart against Kafirs. The written material is used for preservation of the Polemics as well as for its wider circulation. This type of Jihad is conducted by Urdu-Press, and Governments extend all facilities to them to uphold the principle of freedom of press.\n\nWooing Hindu girls, but at the same time compelling their own sisters to wear burqua and to stay away from the Hindu boys, practising polygamy, rejecting population control measures and encouraging cross-border infiltration from Bangladesh and Pakistan in order to reduce the majority of kafirs into a minority of Dhimmis by the end of 21st century, are the demographic dimensions of jihad.\n\nTo launder the Muslim‚Äìmafia money and present the Sufi-mask of Islam to befool kafirs is the cinematographic front of Jihad. The use of Internet to confuse the Kafirs, and to produce, push and percolate counterfeit-currency to undermine their economy are the modern dimensions of Jihad. Weapon smuggling and drug trafficking are other unholy sides of the holy war.\n\nSome of the insidious dimensions of Jihad are; to use freedoms granted by open democratic society of the Kafirs in such a manner that those very freedoms can be ultimately destroyed and the dictatorship of Islam can be imposed over the Kafirs, to plant Trojan horses in democratic institutions of the kafirs for subverting them and, to buy-out writers and journalists by petro-dollars and to place them strategically inside the print and electronic media so that Kafirs can be brainwashed and duped into believing that ‚ÄúIslam is a Noble faith‚Äù.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Islamic theology bifurcates human history into two sharply defined periods. The period before the proclamation of Mohammed‚Äôs prophet-hood is the age of ignorance ‚ÄúJahiliya‚Äù and the period that follows it is the age of illumination ‚ÄúIlm‚Äù.\n\nEvery thing that prevailed in the age of ignorance is to be destroyed outright or to be converted in such a manner that it looks as if it came into existence after the dawn of the Age of Islamic Illumination. The norms of ignorance and illumination are determined not by any objective or comparative criteria, but by the dictums of Koran and Hadith.\n\nFor example, Mullah Omar ordered the destruction of all the statues in Afghanistan. Accordingly, Buddhist relics, a legacy of the pre-Islamic time, were systematically pulverised. It was announced that two massive Buddhas standing over a hundred feet high, dated from the third and fifth centuries, at Bamiyan would be destroyed. In March 2001 job was finished once and for all with artillery and explosives.\n\nAfter the incident, Muslims slaughtered hundred cows to atone for delays in destroying country‚Äôs ancient Buddha statues. Some twenty butchers inside the presidential palace were seen chopping the cows into one kilogram pieces for general distribution among Muslims‚Ä¶(Hindustan Times / New Delhi / dated 20.03.2001)\n\nWhy were ancient Buddha statues destroyed by the Islamic Government of Afghanistan? Because **Buddha represents ‚ÄúJahiliya‚Äù** that is pre-Islamic ignorance while **Mohammed represents ‚ÄúIlm‚Äù** that is Islamic illumination. Therefore the pre-Islamic past of the nation has to be obliterated.\n\nIslam uproots the converted people from their native soil, culture, civilisation and history and imposes over them an unreal identity. This imposed and artificial Arab identity generates tremendous unease and social upheaval for generations. In the words of Bangladeshi authoress Taslima Nasreen ‚ÄúThe problem is not Islamic fundamentalism but Islam itself.‚Äù But more precisely these three dialectic Islamic thought-categories are the root of the problem.\n\nSecularism and Islam are mutually exclusive. The Islam can set-up only a theocratic state. The Islam has institutionalised slavery and degraded women and has laid waste many countries. Islam lacks any doctrine of co-existence. In Islam all human beings are not treated as equals. Islam has two sets of principles of morality, ethics and justice, one is for Muslims and the other for non-Muslims. For example, on one hand, they want to build mosque over the Ramjanmbhoomi at Ayodhya, the sacred city of Hindus while on the other, no non-Muslim can ever enter the city of Mecca where Kaba is situated and if found in the vicinity he will be beheaded as per the tradition of Islam. (Koran 9:5,28,29).\n\nHere it is pertinent to note that the mosque of **Kaba was previously a Pagan temple and was occupied by force** then desecrated, destroyed and converted into a mosque by Prophet Mohammed himself, thus setting an example, and making destruction of Hindu-temples, churches, synagogues, and Buddhist-vihars a lawful and pious activity for Muslims throughout the world and for all ages to come.\n\nThe prophet is traditioned to have willed that no Kafir should be permitted to reside in Arabia. **Mohammed initiated** **the violent campaign of** **ethnic cleansing of Arabia** by converting, kidnapping, expelling and killing the Arabian Pagans, Jews and Christians and their land, wealth and women were taken away. Find out, how prophet acquired so many wives? Therefore, today the Arabian sands lay ethnically cleansed of all non-Muslim impurities. Times have changed. Now Islam claims innocence, that ‚ÄòIslam is a peaceful religion‚Äô. Wonder! That is the ultimate performance in the art of hypocrisy.\n\nThus, like all totalitarian ideologies **Islam survives and thrives on moral asymmetry,** intellectual dishonesty, political hypocrisy, double standards of behaviour and **use of terror against the spirit of free inquiry.**\n\nIn short **Islam divides SPACE, TIME and MANKIND** into two incompatible and hostile parts that is why fundamentalism and terrorism is not accidental but essential to Islam. In Islam, truth is established by sword. These thought-categories make Islam a totalitarian and terrorist cult that it has remained ever since its birth. Thus Islam has invented eternally cruel **‚ÄòOne God‚Äô** and perpetually hostile **‚ÄòTwo Humanities‚Äô.**  In modern rational world **One God but Two Humanities** is an unacceptable preposition.\n\n\\-----------------\n\nSource: [https://cisindus.org/2019/12/30/islamic-theology-the-root-of-islamic-fundamentalism/](https://cisindus.org/2019/12/30/islamic-theology-the-root-of-islamic-fundamentalism/)"<br />Author: 'madeinbharat'  id: 'op85t4'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/op85t4/islamic_theology_the_root_of_islamic/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Soundarya Lahari. What it is actually about.'<br />Body: "&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe capacity of the human mind has been a very difficult topic of research from time immemorial.  From ancient philosophists, such as Aristotle, Socrates till  Freud and beyond , the attempts to understand , diagnose and treat the human mind were many.  Did you know the lyrical composition Soundarya Lahari is actually a take on how to guide and motivate the mind ? Yes the Soundarya Lahari, which is an ode to God visualised in the feminine form, is a guide, to strengthen and motivate our mind.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6hrd4ubvbpc71.png?width=294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=deec48ae96b6ccba65ac1cea3ebe8ed10bc01c0c\n\nYes, often there is a misapprehension and sometimes a confusion too, about the recital of Soundarya Lahari. The beauty of the goddess is extolled in an erotic fashion, etc are the grouses. This is my take on this topic. \n\nFirst let's go into what the Soundarya Lahari is about. The Soundarya Lahari, is a composition of 100 verses in Sanskrit, by Adi Shankaracharya. These verses or Shlokas address Goddess Tripurasundari,  praising  Her and describing Her supreme beauty all the while instructing us to tread the most beneficial path for us.\n\nThe First 41 verses teaches us how to worship Her through our mind and heart. Here comes the concept of the Kundalini and the Sri Chakra. The Kundalini is described as a serpent. While the Kundalini is a  metaphor for our  mental capacities, the Sri Chakra is the mind's  emblematic representation . Then, what about the remaining 59 verses? The remaining verses,from 42 till 100, are about the beauty of The Supreme Goddess. Just not lyrical poetry gushing on feminine beauty, mind you , each, verse could be an instruction as to how to divert our mind to higher goals ;  a method of worship with an Yantra or an instruction for self motivation or even a historical incident. Like the 75th verse \n\n‡§§‡§µ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á ‡§ß‡§∞‡§£‡§ø‡§ß‡§∞‡§ï‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á ‡§π‡•É‡§¶‡§Ø‡§§‡§É\n\n‡§™‡§Ø‡§É ‡§™‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞‡§É ‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§µ‡§π‡§§‡§ø ‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§§‡§ø‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§á‡§µ‡•§\n\n‡§¶‡§Ø‡§æ‡§µ‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§¶‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§∂‡§ø‡§∂‡•Å‡§É ‡§Ü‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§Ç ‡§Ø‡§§‡•ç\n\n‡§ï‡§µ‡•Ä‡§®‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•å‡§¢‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§Ö‡§ú‡§®‡§ø ‡§ï‡§Æ‡§®‡•Ä‡§Ø‡§É ‡§ï‡§µ‡§Ø‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡•§‡•§\n\nThe great mystic poet Thirugyanasambandar is praised in this verse , while the greatness of Tripurasundari's beauty and blessings are also being extolled. \n\n All the 100 verses are collectively known as 'Soundarya Lahari'.  So Soundarya Lahari is an ode to the Supreme Consciousness , while  also instructing the seeker, as to  how to rise the human capacities from the base level, if the case could be, and bring it towards the highest goals .   \n\nIn the Soundarya Lahari, The Supreme One Consciousness, is given a female aspect. According to the verse itself , Shiva her consort , is incapable of any action without Her. \n\n‡§∂‡§ø‡§µ‡§É ‡§∂‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Ø‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§É ‡§Ø‡§¶‡§ø ‡§≠‡§µ‡§§‡§ø ‡§∂‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§É ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§≠‡§µ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•Å‡§Ç\n\n‡§® ‡§ö‡•á‡§§‡•ç ‡§è‡§µ‡§Ç ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§É ‡§® ‡§ñ‡§≤‡•Å ‡§ï‡•Å‡§∂‡§≤‡§É ‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡§ø‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§Ö‡§™‡§ø‡•§\n\n‡§Ö‡§§‡§É ‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§Ü‡§∞‡§æ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§π‡§∞‡§ø-‡§π‡§∞-‡§µ‡§ø‡§∞‡§ø‡§û‡•ç‡§ö‡§æ‡§¶‡§ø‡§≠‡§ø‡§É ‡§Ö‡§™‡§ø\n\n‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§£‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•Å‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ã‡§§‡•Å‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§æ ‡§ï‡§•‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§Ö‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§™‡•Å‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡§É ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§≠‡§µ‡§§‡§ø‡•§‡•§\n\nThis poetry garland of 100 verses on Her, also relates to different means of Puja to Tripurasundari. The rituals , with use of certain Yantras and offerings are also given importance. They are said to be efficacious when recited continuously. \n\nThe Soundarya Lahari is also about the worship of Her through the means of an emblem, The Sri Chakra.  Because of this kind of a worship, people have concluded that the Soundarya Lahari is a ritualistic worship of the Goddess Tripurasundari. Also, some people doubt the authorship of Shankaracharya. So my article here is to answer all these questions.\n\nIs Soundarya Lahari a ritualistic mode of worship?  What is the Sri Chakra?.Is Shankara , the true author of Soundarya Lahari?\n\nMy experience with Guru's of Hinduism is that they often answer our deep queries in the form of mystic silence along with subtle allusions. Spiritual knowledge is a conundrum ,  that can be solved only  by strong efforts .  The Guru helps in solving this inscrutability, when the attempts are  sincere. A mystery is generally solved by picking up  subtle clues and allusions and finally deducing the end result,  with the  application of logic .  In the same fashion the Guru, who had understood great concepts of mind and life, under severe Tapas or training of the monkey mind, imparts to the seeker through subtle methods- allusions, metaphors, similes.  Hence the hoary tradition of spiritual literature right from the Vedas are in the form of metaphors allusions and allegories. Seldom are they direct , at least in the tradition of Hinduism.  So too, in Soundarya Lahari,  the approach to attain Goddess Tripurasundari has been through this emblem of the Sri Chakra. \n\nWhat is the Sri Chakra?  It is the representation of our mind. Because the mind is the cause of everything. In Hinduism,  our festivals and rituals have been arranged on the days when the mind works the best; the days, the earth aligns best in relation to Sun and Moon. Because, the sun has a positive effect on the mind , while the moon dulls it. So spirituality in Hinduism is mostly about the human mind and the ways to take this mind to the highest of all goals: to the one Supra consciousness, the Paramatman. \n\nThe Sri Chakra through representation or metaphors, are in fact methods and hacks ,  to strengthen our mind and eventually making  us focus on our goals. Because a good goal by itself a platform to reach the Absolute One. Like models are used to teach children , physics or chemistry, the same way to the children of spirituality, this model of Sri Chakra is a great explanation technique.\n\nThe mind is subtle and complex . It is a creature of habit. Good and wordly wise parents put their children in the right track of their mind, so that they achieve the best in their lives. Discipline and motivation  through the grooves of studies,extra curricular  activities, sports,  etc  help the child to attune his mind for the right things. \n\nBut often,  such blessings, when unavailable, spirituality helps to mould ourselves. And to achieve our goals. Good goals and their attainment become a  platform to achieve the highest goals of all. That is the one supreme soul, our Eternal companion.\n\nSoundarya Lahari is one great method to attune our mind to the highest of ideals, the union with the Supreme One Consciousness.\n\nThe Sri Chakra is the representation of the mind and it's varied aspects.  The mind is affected by the pulls of our senses. This balancing of choosing and warding away pulls of the senses is difficult for the ignorant. They succumb to wrong pulls of the senses and suffer. But if our mind, be brought up to high levels, then, it is used to achieve the greatest things.\n\nThe symbolic representation of the Sri Chakra tells about worship of deities that guard the different boxes of the Sri Chakra. Thus when we recognise the minds ways and then strengthen it by worship of divinity, the mind goes in the right track.  The tread through the razor edge of this mortal life that has ever so many attractions, distractions  and disasters enmesh the mind and makes it weak. It forgets its goals . It gets caught up in its own vicious circle. To regain the lost track and to remind ourselves what really matters and what is not even fit to waste our thoughts and energies on, is extremely vital for our betterment. This constant reminding ourselves and constant withdrawal from unnecessary things is what are the best things we can do to ourselves. This constant remembrance can get better only by practice. The main stress in the Bhagwat Gita is for this : Remember and practice to remember.. because the mind be filled with things that are good for our betterment.\n\n‡§Ö‡§≠‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∏‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡§Ø‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡•á‡§® ‡§ö‡•á‡§§‡§∏‡§æ ‡§®‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ó‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§®‡§æ |\n\n‡§™‡§∞‡§Æ‡§Ç ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å‡§∑‡§Ç ‡§¶‡§ø‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§‡§ø ‡§™‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§•‡§æ‡§®‡•Å‡§ö‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§Ø‡§®‡•ç || 8.8\n\nIs it easy to remember? \n\nThe lone rishi in the forest, surrounded only by beauteous flora with enchanting scents that led him only to dwell on the Divine Enchanter  and fauna, less vicious than the ones of the  jungles of the mortal life,  had it easy to put his mind in the right track.  But the ordinary human who has to fight day in and day out for his existence and survival, has the toughest fights.\n\nThe Sri Chakra tells us how to withdraw the mind from things that are no good for us. It helps us track away the mind to where Good lies. The different boxes formed by the lines of the triangles of the Sri Chakra represent the different levels of our brain or mind. The prayers to the divinities in these levels, only help to strengthen that aspect.\n\nIn the Soundarya Lahari the Kundalini or the serpentine energy in the humans that lies asleep in the base is metaphorically  aligned to Goddess Tripurasundari. \n\nCertain seekers of the Self are instantaneously able to ascend great heights immediately with their first steps. But others take a longer time. They need to pull their mind from the mires of the low levels that they had been accustomed to, previously.  The first level, hence, is  the Muladhara.  And after much effort to contemplate and concentrate on God or goodness, the  mind is habituated , to rise up. Thus,  the other levels such as \n\nNavel chakra (Swadhisthana)\n\nSolar plexus chakra (Manipura)\n\nHeart chakra (Anahata)\n\nThroat chakra (Vishuddha)\n\nThird eye chakra (Ajna)\n\nFinally the kundalini is brought to the brain which is the Sahasrara or the realm of the 1000 petalled lotus. The union of the latent serpentine energy with this lotus is the final stage. The final awakening. Nirvana or Mukthi,\n\nThere is a doubt as to the so called vulgar descriptions of Goddess in Soundarya Lahari. The 19th one, for instance.\n\n‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ñ‡§Ç ‡§¨‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Å‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ ‡§ï‡•Å‡§ö‡§Ø‡•Å‡§ó‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§Ö‡§ß‡§É ‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§§‡§§‡•ç ‡§Ö‡§ß‡§É\n\n‡§π‡§∞‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ß‡§Ç ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ø‡•á‡§§‡•ç ‡§Ø‡§É ‡§π‡§∞‡§Æ‡§π‡§ø‡§∑‡§ø ‡§§‡•á ‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ‡§•‡§ï‡§≤‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç‡•§\n\n‡§∏‡§É ‡§∏‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§É ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ï‡§∑‡•ã‡§≠‡§Ç ‡§®‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø ‡§µ‡§®‡§ø‡§§‡§æ ‡§á‡§§‡§ø ‡§Ö‡§§‡§ø‡§≤‡§ò‡•Å\n\n‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï‡•Ä‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§Ö‡§™‡§ø ‡§Ü‡§∂‡•Å ‡§≠‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø ‡§∞‡§µ‡•Ä‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Å- ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§®‡§Ø‡•Å‡§ó‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç‡•§‡•§\n\nThe shloka says that when one is agitated by 'such' thoughts, direct it to the One Supreme. Good or bad, direct it to Her. Even a negative thought , can be made positive when we direct them , or divert them to Greater things. Then, we become one with God . \n\nThe 22th verse  says that I am your dasa or slave. I see u in everything. And I become u.\n\n‡§≠‡§µ‡§æ‡§®‡§ø ‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§Ç ‡§¶‡§æ‡§∏‡•á ‡§Æ‡§Ø‡§ø ‡§µ‡§ø‡§§‡§∞ ‡§¶‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§ø‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§ï‡§∞‡•Å‡§£‡§æ‡§Ç\n\n‡§á‡§§‡§ø ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ã‡§§‡•Å‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§æ‡§û‡•ç‡§õ‡§®‡•ç ‡§ï‡§•‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø ‡§≠‡§µ‡§æ‡§®‡§ø ‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§á‡§§‡§ø ‡§Ø‡§É ‡•§\n\n‡§§‡§§‡•ç ‡§è‡§µ ‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§Ç ‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•à ‡§¶‡§ø‡§∂‡§∏‡§ø ‡§®‡§ø‡§ú-‡§∏‡§æ-‡§Ø‡•Å‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø-‡§™‡§¶‡§µ‡•Ä‡§Ç\n\n‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ï‡•Å‡§®‡§¶-‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡§Æ‡•á‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞ - ‡§∏‡•ç‡§´‡•Å‡§ü -‡§Æ‡§ï‡•Å‡§ü - ‡§®‡•Ä‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡§ø‡§§‡§™‡§¶‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç‡•§‡•§\n\nWhen we see god every where. Every moment becomes a prayer. Every moment we ascend the ladder of self betterment.\n\nWhatever distraction we have what ever pull of  senses we have and whatever negative emotion we experience like jealousy or anger, if we direct it to something to a positive aspect, better still to divinity, are mind only identifies itself with that divinity and becomes one with that divinity. \n\nKalidasa in his Kumarasambhavam , too describes Devi , thus. This kind of description in beauteous poetry was said to be part of Tantrik worship.\n\nThe latter part of Soundarya Lahari describes the incredible grace and sublimity of the Goddess. Her ravishing beauty is incomparable. \n\nEven a person who has ADHD will succumb to such vivid picturization . The visuals of Her form remain embedded in the mind, because, after all, the mind lingers after something pleasing.\n\nThe Kundalini is addressed as Goddess Tripurasundari. She meets her consort Parameshwara, the brain or the Sahasrara. This union brings enlightenment to the seeker.\n\nThe Kundalini is the representation of the jeevatma. And Parameshwara the Paramatman.\n\nSo raising the jeevatma to the level of the supreme.\n\nWhat is Tripura? \n\nPura is a city. ‡§™‡•Ñ means to fill. So the place filled with people. The three puras indicate ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§É , ‡§≠‡•Å‡§µ‡§É and ‡§∏‡•Å‡§µ‡§É. The 3 mental levels. \n\nThe 3 mental levels that are to be conquered and won over and finally enter the place of union with her spouse Tripureshwara. So,  She becomes the Queen of these 3 cities or levels of the mind. Because, if we see God even in these places we always become one with Her. This is actually a way typical in Hinduism, to see God everywhere. Even in an abstract form as that of your mind. In the Soundarya Lahari, the 3 levels are further divided by 2 . Thus there are the six levels, Muladhara, Svadhishtana, Manipura, Anahata,Vishuddha,Ajna.\n\nThe Sahasrara or the thousand petaled lotus, is in the brain, the place where Shiva resides. ( Shiva resides in our brain).\n\nWhy do I think the Shankara was indeed the author of the Soundarya Lahari?\n\n1) The text is about attaining unity  with the Paramatman. Which is nothing but Advaita. Shankara was a proponent of Advaita.\n\n2)Works from 12th AD , such as Vedanta Kalpataru,Durgapradipa,Tara bhakthi sudharnava etc quote Shankara's authorship of the Soundarya Lahari.\n\n3) Shankara's usage of words and phrases that are found in his other works. ‡§ï‡•ç‡§å‡§™‡•ç‡§§, ‡§≠‡•É‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó,  are a few words I can think of.\n\n4) His reference to the Dramilashishu, that is Sri Gyana Sambandar.\n\nSuccess is the culmination of all the efforts by the individual, after battling with failures and raising up again, undaunted. Whether we achieve or not , the effort is more essential than the end . The attitude that we do it is more important than getting it. That makes all the difference. \n\nThis path of Sri Vidya or the Auspicious Knowledge to win over the mind and reach unity with Eshwara, is by itself a great effort. The path of strengthening the mind through worship of the emblematic  Srichakra and the Chakras in our body is an edifying technique to rise us to Supreme goals."<br />Author: 'SquareBobcat6'  id: 'op7nqw'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/op7nqw/the_soundarya_lahari_what_it_is_actually_about/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'social distancing, untouchability, kegare or how india survived plagues/epidemics'<br />Body: 'disclaimer: Not a post promoting untouchability\n\nwith Olympics around the corner in Japan, came across the concept of Kegare in Japanese society. very similar to the ones practiced in hinduism aka sanatana dharma, or practiced mostly by the orthodox aka regressive families, or generally suggested by priests who perform ceremonies. the concept of purity or impurity is not isolated to our society, I believe it existed in Japan even before buddhism spread from india, and unlikely buddhism could have carried the concept of kegare from india. Kosher and Halal are also similar watered down concept of purity restricted to food. It would likely arisen from years and generations of observation, before modern idea of germs became documented in western countries.\n\nNow during covid, along with masks, main recommendation all over the world is social distancing, which is pretty much what was followed in the name of untouchability along with some more evilness. while it would make sense even today in the context of medical safety, it failed from social and humanitarian standpoint due to the rigidity of segregation. if some could cleanse themselves by doing some ritual, maybe they figured out rituals didn\'t work on someone who acquired some disease, and ended up outcasting them. there is even a mythological story of doctor/medicine gods who were denied offerings from a ritual, since they were polluted by patients.\n\nwhile &gt;25% of europe was wiped out from black death/bubonic plague, India has become one of the most populous country, we don\'t seem to have other documented cases of huge population drop due to pandemics/epidemics. Of course wars, famine have been present causing mass deaths, but i dont find mention of anything similar in the previous 2000 years. depending on how you look at it, segregation of castes and untouchability may have helped prevent such pandemics in India, and outbreaks might have been localized. This relates to both occupation based localization and "impurity of family", say, practices following death, will keep them isolated from rest of the community. So despite wars/invasions/famines, India had a steady growth rate for millennia.'<br />Author: 'IamParpananNotSanghi'  id: 'op70g9'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/op70g9/social_distancing_untouchability_kegare_or_how/</li>
      <li>Title::: "'On Dhimmis ‚Äì How Islam Treats Hindus'"<br />Body: '*This is part 5 of the earlier article* On the Nature of Islam*. This is a tract written on the Nature of Islam in context of the rising Islamic terrorism the world over in 2002. This article discusses the legal status of Hindus in an Islamic state and how many disabilities they endure. They are ultimately primed for conversion to Islam. Note: Krishnaswami is a penname of an author, who for more spiritual than political reasons, shall remain anonymous.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/drrfuikxtoc71.png?width=840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=725c1b6d478d8b30a5a34c5f3b922d4b13cdfdce\n\nHindus, by Islamic law, hold second class status in a country ruled by Islam. The Hadis and the four ‚Äúpious‚Äù Khalifas elaborated the prin\xadciples which are to be applied in **jihad** against those who do not accept Islam nor agree to pay **jizyah** *tax.* The non-muslim males capable of bearing arms are to be massacred; the non-muslim women and children are to be enslaved; the movable properties of the non-muslims are to be looted; their lands are to be confiscated; their temples are to be destroyed; their priests and monks are to be killed and their libraries, literature and scriptures burnt.\n\nThose who agree to pay jizyah tax are to be treated as **Dhimmis** who are allowed to live and work for the Islamic state under the following 20 disabilities:\n\n1. Non-Muslims are not to build any new temples.\n2. Non-Muslims are not to repair any old temples which have been destroyed by the Muslims.\n3. Non-Muslims are not to prevent Muslim travellers from staying in their temples.\n4. Non-Muslims are to entertain for three days any Muslim who wants to stay in their homes, and for a longer period if the Muslim falls ill.\n5. Non-Muslims are not to harbour any hostility towards the Islamic state, or give any aid and comfort to hostile elements.\n6. Non-Muslims are not to prevent any one of them from getting con\xadverted to Islam.\n7. Non-Muslims have to show respect towards every Muslim.\n8. Non-Muslims have to allow Muslims to participate in their private meetings.\n9. Non-Muslims are not to dress like Muslims.\n10. Non-Muslims are not to name themselves with Muslim names.\n11. Non-Muslims are not to ride on horses with saddle and bridle.\n12. Non-Muslims are not to possess arms.\n13. Non-Muslims are not to wear signet rings or seals on their fingers.\n14. Non-Muslims are not to sell or drink liquor openly.\n15. Non-Muslims are to wear a distinctive dress which shows their inferior status, and which separates them from the Muslims.\n16. Non-Muslims are not to propagate their customs and usages amongst the Muslims.\n17. Non-Muslims are not to build their houses in the neighbourhood of Muslims.\n18. Non-Muslims are not to bring their dead near the grave\xadyards of the Muslims.\n19. Non-Muslims are not to observe their religious practices publicly, or mourn their dead loudly.\n20. Non-Muslims are not to buy Muslim slaves.\n\nWhen an Islamic state was established over parts of northern India, the Ulama raised a great controversy. By now the inter\xadpreters of Islamic law had become divided into four schools ‚Äî Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki, and Shafii. The Hanafi school of Islamic law alone was in favour of extending the status of dhimmis to the Hindus. The other three schools were insistent that the only choice the Hindus had was between Islam and death. Ziyauddin Barani voiced his opinion against the Hanafi school of law when he wrote as follows in his Fatwa-i-Jahandari: ‚ÄúIf Mahmud‚Ä¶had gone to India once more, he would have brought under his sword all the Brahmans of Hind who, in that vast land, are the cause of the continuance of the laws of infidelity and of the strength of idolators; he would have cut off the heads of two or three hundred thousand Hindu chiefs. He would not have returned his slaughtering sword to its scabbard until the whole of Hind had accepted Islam. For Mahmud was a Shafiite, and according to Imam Shafii the decree for Hindus is Islam or death, that is to say, they should either be put to death or accept Islam. It is not lawful to accept jiziya from Hindus who have neither a prophet nor a revealed book.‚Äù (The Story of Imperialism in India/ Sita Ram Goel / p. 90 ‚Äì 92)\n\nThe Jizyah Tax on Hindus has played an enormous role in the spread of Islam in India. The so-called Sufi-saint Amir Khusrau laments that had Hanafite law, not prevailed in India, which allows Kafirs the concession of survival on payment of Jizyah tax, the Hindus would have vanished root and branch:\n\n*Ba-dhimmah gar na budi rukhsat-I shar,*\n\n*Na mandi nam-I Hindu zi sl ta far.*\n\nLiterally translated from Persian, -‚ÄúDid the Dhimmis (the second class Hindu citizen under Muslim rule) not enjoy the concession of shariya, all trace of the Hindu would vanish root and branch. (Amir Khusrau/Ashiqah/Ed. By Rashid Ahmad Ansari/ Alligarh/ 1917/ p.46)\n\nThe ‚Äúlaw‚Äù of Islam also prescribes death penalty for those who:\n\n1. Question the exclusive claim of Islam as the only true religion, and of Mohammed as the last prophet. Thus Islam has closed its gates to logical and open debate, becoming a closed system for all times to come.\n2. Try to revert to their ancestral faith after having been forced or lured to em\xadbrace Islam. Islam keeps firm grip on its people by making apostasy a capital offence, as is also blasphemy towards God and the prophet. Thus Muslims are hostages held as captives by the Islam, through brain washing, fear of hell, threats, use of force, and of course through promise of ultimate reward which Islam offers: Paradise, the place for unlimited sexual orgies, forever‚Ä¶ (Koran ‚Äì 2:25,4:13,9:111,10:9,47:15,52:17 ‚Äì 24)\n3. Marry Muslim women without first getting converted to Islam. Mani Ratnam‚Äôs film ‚ÄòBombay‚Äô (Hero ‚Äì Hindu, Heroin ‚Äì Manisha Koirala potraying a Muslim girl) is an example. A country made hand grenade was thrown at Mani Ratnam in Madras ‚Äì the message sent by this act was that you will have to pay with your life if you violate the provisions of Sharia even in fiction and films, leave alone the real life.\n\nNon-Muslims are also discriminated against, in matters of testimony in law courts, taxation, and appointment to public offices. To sum up, the status of non-Muslims (dhimmis) in an Islamic state is that of hewers of wood and drawers of water. They are subjected to every possible indignity and pressure in order to force them into the fold of Islam.\n\n**Indian Muslims are descendants of these victims of Islamic imperialism.** They are culturally and anthropologically very much Indians. Due to the imposed alien Arab ideology of Islam, their loyalties lie with the pan-Islamic issues, as they do not know the cruel history of the forced conversion of their ancestors. This unfortunate situation has induced an ‚Äòidentity crisis‚Äô among them and turned them into a culturally rootless and hostile mass.\n\n\\------\n\nSource: [https://cisindus.org/2019/12/27/on-dhimmis-how-islam-treats-hindus/](https://cisindus.org/2019/12/27/on-dhimmis-how-islam-treats-hindus/)'<br />Author: 'madeinbharat'  id: 'op681y'<br />Score:115<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/op681y/on_dhimmis_how_islam_treats_hindus/</li>

The copy I downloaded online turned out was an annotated version written by Arundhati Roy. Now before this I was not really \'aware\' of Roy\'s works/ activism other than the fact that she won some award for her book "God of Small Things". This was in my book shelf a few years back and every time I started reading it, I invariably drifted to sleep. Every. Single.

It won an award from America (or Britain). Overcome by this guilt (or inferiority), I started reading the Annihilation of Caste Book annotated by Roy.\n\nTurns out the book was more about Mahatma Gandhi than Ambedkar. The crux is this: Gandhi, a UC = bad; Ambedkar, Dalit = good. Apparently everything bad under the sun is the fault of Brahmins and UCs. I tried to persist with the book but halfway through, the leaps and complete lack of logic, cherry picking of facts, out of context quotes, etc. took its toll. I realized something that extremely important: speaking/ writing good English does not automatically make you good thinker. Being praised by Westerners does not make you good anything. \n\nThis realization was cathartic and liberating. I could be myself without having to constantly demean my religion and culture in the hope of being accepted into that cabal which will reduce me to my caste identity and nothing else - ironically failing to annihilate caste injustice in fact actively doing the opposite and make it persevere.

This is a tract written on the Nature of Islam in context of the rising Islamic terrorism the world over in 2002. This article discusses the atrocities done on Hindus by Islam during its rule in India and also the concept of ‚Äònegationism‚Äô. Note: Krishnaswami is a penname of an author, who for more spiritual than political reasons, shall remain anonymous.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7d14ezy3thc71.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84aebc854c02edb4c91757c637ba29e803d3754a\n\nAbout the large scale distribution of Hindu girl slaves on the occasion of celebration of Muslim festival of Id, Ibn Battuta writes:  ‚ÄúFirst of all, daughters of Kafir Hindu Rajas captured during course of the year, come and sing and dance. Thereafter they are bestowed upon Amirs and important foreigners. After this, daughters of other Kafirs dance and sing‚Ä¶ The Sultan gives them to his relatives. On the day after Id the Darbar is held in a similar fashion. Female singers are brought out‚Ä¶ The Sultan distributes them among the Muslim officers‚Ä¶‚Äù (Ibn Battuta /63). ‚ÄúThousands of Hindu women were distributed in the above manner in later years to celebrate Id festival‚Äù  (Afif / Tarikh-i-Firoz Shahi/ 119-20/ 180/265).\n\nAccording to Hedayah every slave girl could be used as concubine. Obtaining wives and concubines through all kinds of criminal means ‚Äì capture, purchase, enslavement‚Äîwas in vogue among Muslims.\n\nFatawa -i- Alamgiri declares ‚ÄúIf the breasts are large or vagina wide or baggy (which does not give requisite pleasure) whether in a virgin or a non-virgin, the purchaser has a right to return her to the seller and claim refund of money.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ (Fatawa -i- Alamgiri/ Deoband/ xxiv/ 5-6, 26-27).\n\nZiyauUddin Barani reckons regulations regarding sale of  ‚Äúhorses, slaves and quadrupeds‚Äù under one category ‚Ä¶(Barani/ 312).  Very similar rules apply both to the sale of animals and Hindu bonds men. ‚Äú A milch buffalo caused 10 ‚Äì 12 tankahs, a working girl was cheaper. The price of a good quality horse was 90 ‚Äì 120 tankahs that of a ghulam was 100 on an average. A handsome young boy could be obtained for 20 to 30 tankahs.‚Äù ‚Ä¶(Barani/Tarikh-i-Firoz Shahi/ 314 ‚Äì 15). It is therefore a matter of some satisfaction that under the Khaljis the value of Hindus in terms of price was not less than that of horses and buffaloes.\n\nHindu boys and men in thousands were emasculated in to Hijiras (eunuchs) to serve the Muslim cities as servants and guards in the harems.  Most of the Hijiras (eunuchs) comprised of Hindu slaves captured during wars and then castrated i.e. their sexual organs were removed. ‚ÄúDuring Aurangzeb‚Äôs time, in the city of Hyderabad, in the year 1659 alone, 22,000 individuals were emasculated and converted into hijiras‚Äù‚Ä¶ (Michel Erlich/ Les Mutilation Sexuelles/ Paris/ 1991/ p.59)\n\nThe custom of taking favorite homosexual hijira slaves in Palkies (palanquins) seems to have been common so that Sultan Sikander Lodi. (1489-1517) could boast that ‚Äú If I order one of my slaves to be seated in a palki, the entire body of nobility would carry him on their shoulders at my bidding‚Äù‚Ä¶ (Tahrikh-i-Daudi ). This statement incidentally conveys an idea of the importance of handsome favorite hijira slaves and also reflects on the status of nobles under autocratic Muslim rulers. Alauddin had a corps of 50,000 personal slaves, Mohammed Tughlaq 20,000 and Firoz Tughlaq 40,000. (Tarikh -i- Firoz Shahi / Shams Siraj Afif/ 270, 272)\n\nAccording to Ibn Khaldun, the captives after war were ‚Äúbrought from the House of War to the House of Islam under the rule of slavery, which hides in itself a divine providence; cured by slavery, they enter the Muslim religion with the firm resolve of true believers‚Ä¶‚Äù  (Ibn Khaldun; Ibar, trs./ Bernard Lewis in Islam/ 98). Muslims took pride in enslaving people; the feelings of Hindu victims were just opposite. In the flowery language of Edward Gibbon, ‚Äú By the repetition of a sentence (kalima) and loss of a foreskin, subjects or the slave, the captive or the criminal, arose in a moment the free or equal companion of victorious Muslims. ‚Äù  ( Gibbon/ii/782 and 720).\n\nHow did the Hindu women react to such a desperate situation? When Sindh lay prostrate before the armies of Mohammed bin Qasim, ‚ÄúRaja Dahir‚Äôs sister Bai collected all the women in the fort of Rawar and addressed them thus: ‚Äòit is certain that we cannot escape the clutches of these Chandals and cow-eaters‚Ä¶ As there is no hope of safety and liberty, let us collect firewood and cotton and oil and burn ourselves to ashes‚Äô. All of them were of one mind, and so they entered a house and set fire to it, and soon burnt to ashes‚Ä¶(Chachnama / Kalichbeg /153-55/E.D./ I /181)\n\nThereafter, throughout the medieval period, as soon as it was certain that there had been a defeat and the men had been killed, women perished in the **‚Äò****fire of Jauhar****‚Äô**, Jiva-har, i.e. taking of life.\n\nThe Jauhar at Chittor during Akbar‚Äôs invasion may be mentioned as an instance in the Mughal period. On the night of 23 February 1568, after Rajput commander Jai mal‚Äôs death people of Chittor resolved to perform the rite of Jauhar. Flames broke out at various places in the palace, as many as three hundred Hindu women were burnt in the fire of Jauhar‚Ä¶(Akbar Nama / II / 472 )\n\nDuring Jujhar Singh Bundela‚Äôs resistance in the Orcha in the time of Shahjahan, many women were captured by the Muslim army and treated most cruelly. It was in this fashion that Hindu women used to be captured and distributed for the service in the harems of the Muslim elite‚Ä¶(Cambridge History of India / IV / p.195)\n\n‚ÄúA left-over from this period is the North-Indian custom of celebrating weddings at midnight: this was a safety measure against the Islamic sport of bride catching‚Äù (K. Elst/ Negationism in India/ Voice of India/ New Delhi/ p.28)\n\n‚ÄúHere we should remember the Devshirme system (Greek for ‚Äòcollecting boys‚Äô). Initiated by the Ottoman Sultan Orkhan ( 1326-1359), it existed for about 300 years. It consisted of a regular levy of non-Muslim children from the enslaved population of the Balkans. These Christian, Jew and Gypsy turned Muslim children of about the age of seven, were trained to fight against their own erstwhile brethren. This system of forced levy of children formed for centuries the mainstay of the despotic power of Islam in Balkans and was kept alive by a regular contribution exacted on enslaved innocent populations annually in contingents of a thousand children. The Mohammedan legal expert attempted to apologize for this inhuman tax, collected in the form of live human beings, by representing these collected non-Muslim children as the one-fifth of the loot which the Holy Koran legally assign to the Muslim ruler as his lawful share‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúA sort of Devshirme system still exist today in the Islamic Sudan and has been described and denounced by the United Nations Special Rapporteur Mr. Gaspar Biro in his 1994 report, and by an article in the Times of London‚Äî‚ÄúSudanese Christian sold as slaves‚Äù, August 25, 1995‚Äù. (Bat Ye‚Äôor / The Decline of Eastern Christianity Under Islam, 7th to 20th century: from Jihad to Dhimmitude/ Associated University Presses/ 1996).\n\nAccording to Francois Gautier ‚Äì ‚ÄúThis is the profession of faith of a Muslim ‚ÄòI certify that there is no other God than Allah, of whom Mohammed is the only prophet‚Äô which means in effect: ‚ÄòAfter and before Mohammed, there is nobody else‚Äô‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúThus the whole religion of Islam is based on negation: **nobody but us, no other religion but ours. And if you disagree, you shall die.** This puts a serious limitation to tolerance and from this strong belief sprang all the horrors of the Muslim invasion of India‚Äù‚Ä¶ (Arise Again, O‚Äô India!).\n\n‚ÄúThe Bahamani Sultans in central India, made it a rule to kill 100,000 Hindus a year. In 1399, Teimur killed 100,000 Hindus in a single day. The Hindu population decreased by 80  million between the year 1000 and 1525 A.D. indeed the biggest holocaust in the whole world history‚Äù‚Ä¶ (ibid.)\n\n‚ÄúEntire cities were burnt down and their populations massacred. Every new invader made, often literally, his hill of Hindu skulls. Thus the conquest of Afghanistan in year 1000, was followed by the annihilation of the entire Hindu population there, indeed, **the region is still called ‚ÄòHindu Kush‚Äô, meaning Hindu Slaughter**‚Äù‚Ä¶ (ibid). Hindu-Kush range is literally the mountain of evidence of Islamic crimes against humanity. Muslims can still have a clean conscience and praise Islam, wonder!!!.\n\nFrancois Gautier writes, ‚ÄúThe happiest in this matter must be the Muslims themselves. What fools these Hindus are, they must be telling themselves, we killed them by the millions, we wrested the whole nation out of them, we engineered riots against them and they still defend us!‚Ä¶‚Äù (ibid).\n\n‚Äú**NEGATIONISM** means that this whole aspect of Indian history has been totally erased, not only from the history books, but also from the memory, from the consciousness of Indian people. Whereas the Jews have constantly tried, since Nazi genocide, to keep alive the remembrance of their six million martyrs, the Indian leadership political and intellectual (that is professional pseudo-secularists) has made a willful and conscious attempt to deny the genocide perpetrated by the Muslims. No one is crying for vengeance. It is only a matter of making sure that history does not repeat its mistakes, as alas it is able to do today. Witness the persecution of Hindus in Kashmir, whose 250,000 people have fled their 5,000 year old homeland; or the 50,000 Hindus chased from Afghanistan; or the oppression of Hindus in Bangladesh and Pakistan. And most of all, to remember, is to be able to look at today with the wisdom of yesterday. **No collective memory should be erased for appeasing a particular community‚Ä¶** (Ibid.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSource: [https://cisindus.org/2019/12/26/india-in-the-islamic-dark-ages-2/](https://cisindus.org/2019/12/26/india-in-the-islamic-dark-ages-2/)'<br />Author: 'madeinbharat'  id: 'ooiolm'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ooiolm/india_and_the_islamic_dark_ages_part_4/</li>

The world famous historian Will Durant writes, ‚Äú**Mohammedan conquest of India was probably the bloodiest story in history‚Äù**‚Ä¶ (The story of Civilization / vol.1 / New York /1972). Looked at from the point of view of Islam it was a dazzling period indeed, as faithfully recorded by the Muslim court historians‚Ä¶ (Elliot and Dowson: History of India as told by its own Historians / 8 vols. / New Delhi reprint 1990 / London 1867-77)\n\nIslam had the immense satisfaction of:\n\n1. Sending millions of accursed idolater Hindu Kafirs to hell by killing them in a millennium long Jihad.\n2. Converting millions of Hindus by force.\n3. Killing thousands of native scholars, Hindu and Jain sadhus and Buddhist bhikshus and burning their sacred books, libraries and universities.\n4. Demolishing and desecrating thousands of Hindu and Jain temples and building mosque over them with the materials of destroyed temples.\n5. Killing cows and forcing Hindus to eat beef.\n6. Capturing millions of innocent Hindu men, women and children and selling them in to slavery and concubinage in the far flung Islamic world.\n7. Violating the chastity of Hindu women and forcing them into Muslim harems or forcing them into prostitution, and thus degrading them in to sex-slaves.\n8. Castrating, that is removing and mutilating sexual organs of handsome young male slaves, and transforming them into GHILMAN and EUNUCHS (hijiras) for the purpose of homosexual and other harem services.\n9. Collecting vast amounts of loot and distributing it among Muslims according to the rules laid down and exemplified by the prophet himself.\n10. Imposing exploitative religious tax the Jizyah on Hindus.\n11. Establishing the truth of The Koran by power of sword instead of logic, debates and discourses.\n\nJust a few examples from the history of Islam will illustrate the above-mentioned points:\n\nConstruction of Masjid Quwwatul Islam (might of Islam) was commenced by Aibak in 1195. It was built with materials and gold obtained by destroying 27 Hindu and Jain temples in Delhi and Its neighborhood. A Persian inscription in the mosque testifies to this, it is reproduced in, Thomas/ Chronicles of the Pathan Kings of Delhi/p. 22-23.\n\nKazi Mughith ad Din told Sultan Alauddin Khalj ‚ÄúIf the Jizyah-collector ask a Hindu for a silver, the later should offer gold in all humility. If the tax collector wishes to spit in to Hindu‚Äôs mouth, the Hindu should open his mouth without demur, so as to enable the Muslim tax collector to spit into Hindu‚Äôs mouth‚Äù. (Diya ad-Din Barani/ Tarikh-I Firozshahi/ Sayyid Athar Abbas Rizwi/ selected Hindi translation in his Khalji- kalina Bharata/ Aligarh/1955/ p.70).\n\nIn 1679, Aurangzeb reintroduced Jizyah tax on Hindus at the usual rates of 48 Dhirams on the rich, 24 on the middle class, and 12 on the poor. Following the Islamic tradition, he also stipulated that Dhimmi (the second class Hindu citizen under Muslim rule) should carry the Jizyah tax with his own hand and should come on foot. Hindu Dhimmis should pay tax standing, while Muslim Jizyah-collector is sitting. The Hindu Dhimmi‚Äôs hand should be below that of the collector, who should snatch away the tax from the Hindu‚Äôs hands with this specific remark, ‚Äú**Pay the Jizyah, O Dhimmi!**‚Äù (Mirza Muhammad Hasan/ed. By Sayyid Nawab Ali/ Gaekwad‚Äôs Oriental series/No. xxxiii/ Baroda/ 1928/vol-I p.296-297).\n\nIt was not only Jahangir, a comparatively kind hearted emperor, who used to capture poor Hindu people during his hunting expeditions and send them to Kabul in exchange for dogs and horses; all Muslim rulers and governors collected Hindu slaves and exploited them ‚Ä¶ Under Shahjahn, peasants were compelled to sell their women and children to meet the revenue demand‚Äù‚Ä¶(K.S.Lal/ Muslim Slave System in Medieval India/ Aditya Prakashan/p.73)\n\nAbdulla Khan Uzbeg‚Äôs force destroyed all towns in the Kalpi-Kanauj area, be-headed the men, took away all their goods, their wives and children as slaves‚Äù. (Abul Fazl/Akbar Nama, ii, 195-96). Abdulla Khan Uzbeg once declared that  ‚ÄúI made prisoners of five lacs of Hindu Kafir men and women and sold them.

Have the British paid us any emancipation for looting us over 100 years. Did the Muslims give any emancipation for there crimes against Hindus? They literally caused exodus of Kashmiri Pandits and what did the Pandits receive for emancipation? Nothing. Still it is used for Vote Bank politics. The Modi Government did remove Article 370 but it was met with Criticism of  "It was an undemocratic process". Okay, let us for the argument assume it is , so my question(I think it is a loaded question) to you is - " Is democratic process more important than Human Rights of the Minorities in Kashmir?"  \n\n**Secularism**\n\nMan, this word should be removed from the constitution, whenever I debate with people , they always India\'s Secularism and by Secularism it is 100% in the context of Pluralism not the Separation of Church and state. Why don\'t just use Pluralism instead.\n\n**Love for Constitution and Democracy**\n\nMan, some people love for Indian Constitution and Democracy is so high like it is the two best things ever to India, but the fact is the Constitution is itself inspired by different constitution. There is no uniqueness in the Indian Constitution which we can brag about. Also, for Democracy , these same people love Democracy as it is the best system in the world but what is the point of Democracy when the opposition itself is non-existent.\n\nDemocracy is really region specific, you can cry about Democracy in America because other countries are no threat to America.\n\nBut in India\'s case, on the left we have Pakistan and now Afghanistan and on the right we have China.\n\nPlay Democracy- Democracy but the fact is that China has made ports in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka already, we rely heavily on China for a lot of goods and services.\n\nWho can challenge the BJP currently? Congress? AAP? Bahujan Samaj Party(lol)?\n\nSeriously man, these people pray to the Indian Constitution like it is their holy bible and hug on to Ambedkars Scrotum like it is there Holy Grail.\n\n**Reservation System**\n\nAah, the gold old Reservation System, I hate you so much. The fact that this outdated system is not reformed yet and political parties are afraid to touch it because touching it might ensue a Civil War is downright saddening.\n\nThe reservation system focuses on Equality of Outcome , not Opportunity, the whole concept is "Equal Representation" which IMO is a pipe dream. The RS has also failed in providing "Equal Opportunity" amazingly , so that is another thing.\n\nI don\'t know but IMO "You don\'t increase the confidence of Lower Caste People by putting them in a race where they think don\'t belong, you increase there confidence by making them better and providing more opportunities at the stuff they already do."\n\nIn Honkong , for Sewage Cleaning , you have go through 2 years of Rigorous training and 15 certificate, here in India, you just drop in a pile of Poo and hope you don\'t die. That is the difference, here in India , poop cleaner has no respect, in America and other countries they do. You want Dalits to have confidence, modernize the stuff they do and see the Results.\n\nThat\'s it. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.

She goes on to describe monogamy as socially enforced or some shit like that.\n\nloads of these young desi content creators are going the same way, spouting the same crap.\n\nI call BULLSHIT, and the number of eager young Indian followers cooing over her, going "aah you just opened my eyes" is just tragic.\n\nI\'m here to bash casual sex on its own terms, not to associate it with Western culture at all. I am also not criticising premarital sex at all.\n\nLet\'s list the cons of casual sex-\n\n1. Risk of STDs/ pregnancy\n2. Lowered threshold of fidelity/ higher risk of cheating (lots of studies to back it up)\n3. risk of assault/stalking/ stealthing/ grey definition of consent\n4. it\'s not EMPOWERING! Stop telling girls it\'s empowering. The dude is just gonna brag about his friends, and YOU\'RE gonna wind up feeling like shit. Many girls just do it to feel validated, or out of peer pressure\n5. It\'s not just something that happens one time and you move past. If it\'s happened once, it stays with you. You can\'t say \'I\'m still the same.\' You\'re not. You had sex with a stranger. You shared the highest level of intimacy with someone you know nothing about. It\'s weird.\n6. Just because it\'s safe and fun doesn\'t mean it\'s right. No matter how progressive you think you may be, this shit WILL bother you, if you think about your future partner, or someone you genuinely love and deeply care for. In having casual sex, remember, these are all things you have to live with and explain, once you actually meet someone you love. Or lie, and live with the lie. \n7. You view relationships and people as disposable. \n8. Someone IS going to get hurt in most cases. You can\'t just bump uglies and walk away scotfree. I\'m not saying it\'s impossible, but highly improbable.\n9. Easy to view sex as a replacement for genuine love and affection in a loving relationship\n10. The sex is probably gonna be terrible because neither party knows what the other one likes\n11. odds of actually having with a decent person, as opposed to a shitbag, are kinda skewed\n12. the logic that human beings are basically animals is BS too. we are NOT animals, our brains are much more well-developed. Yes, we get horny, but we really do need to think about the consequences before yielding to that horniness\n13. It\'s definitely being equated with being Cool. You know what\'s even more Cool? Being responsible, smart, and planning for your future\n14. Fuck whoever shames monogamy. Be single, be polyamorous, be whatever you want, but don\'t shame people who choose to be in a monogamous relationship, or accuse them of being coerced into it by a system\n\nTLDR; Fuck Casual sex, and fuck the affluent desi social media influencers promoting it as modern, and part of the good life'<br />Author: 'MelonAndPaeroa'  id: 'oo3g0k'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/oo3g0k/unpopular_opinion_rant_fuck_casual_sex_and_the/</li>

It was only when I began reading Western press did I see that the Western press and academia associates the \'caste\' of Indians with colour. The perpetuation of this idea is very harmful. It tries to establish two things:\n\na) Indian civilization was not created by the swarthy Indians (but rather the \'white\' Brahmins)\nb) Race, not class, was the basis of the Indian feudal system\n\nAnybody who has interacted with enough Indians knows that skin colour and caste are not related 1-1. I have seen some extremely dark Brahmins while pale OBCs and Dalits. Some people will point out a study conducted which shows a weak correlation by caste and skin colour, but this is more likely due to socioeconomic factors than supposed \'genetic\' factors. This ideology is very harmful, because it possesses a threat to national unity through a nonsensical idea of the `white\' Brahmins (who are almost as swarthy as the rest of India) and the `black\' Dalits; with almost no basis in reality. If we have to get really pedantic, skin colour allele distribution in India varies by region and not by caste. Punjabi Dalits and Kashmiri Dalits will be lighter than Tamil Brahmins. After all, Krishna, Rama, Draupadi, Arjuna, all were said to be black skinned. \n\nThe principal purpose of the caste system, or the ancestral class system, was the organization of labour, not the organization of people based on skin colour which is exactly what the \'caste system\' in Latin America was.'<br />Author: 'AzadInsan'  id: 'onze3e'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/onze3e/proposal_lets_not_called_it_caste_but_call_it/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The immediate aftermath and long term effects of the Third Battle of Panipat, 14th of January, 1761, and Maratha response to the Panipat disaster.'<br />Body: 'I think, an analysis of the aftermath and effects of the Battle is necessary, since the notion that Maratha ambitions in the North were completely thwarted owing to this singular moment and defeat is not based in any solid evidence.\n\n\n\n**The reception of the news of the Panipat disaster :**\n\n\n\nThe Peshwa Balaji Bajirao, had dispatched a magnificent army under Sadashivrao Bhau his cousin, along with his son Vishwasrao, and the flower of the Maratha Military, the *Huzurat* and the *Gardis* were with him, to guarantee him a victory against the Shah Abdali in the North. The last correspondence that the Peshwa received from Bhau was dated November 14th, the day when the Maratha and Durrani forces had confronted each other in the field around Panipat, before the long wait ensued and the fateful battle was fought in January next year. For the Peshwa, victory was expected, even if such victory did not materialise, given the disposition of the Maratha army, he was confident that Bhau would hold the Durrani in place while he marched from Poona to the north and the two armies would crush the Afghans between them. Therefore, with Supreme confidence in his cousin, the Peshwa leisurely left Poona around *Dussehra*, reached Ahmednagar and spent two months near the Godavari, before crossing it. On 9th January, he sent back Raghunath Rao, his brother to the Deccan to watch over the Nizam\'s forces, while he continued with his magnificent host to Malwa, which he entered on 18th of January. He immediately dispatched letters to Bhau, inquiring on his position and giving instructions regarding strategy. From this day onwards, news trickled in, in the form of men retreating from the Battle back to their homes, but none of these reports were conclusive, only this was clear, that Bhau\'s situation was desperate, that a starved Maratha army was defeated by the Afghans. Yet, no clear indications of who survived. Finally, in February, from Nana Purandare, he recieved the details of the horrible events that had transpired on 14th of January 1761, the death of his son and cousin broke his heart. He would remain in Malwa until 22nd March. Yet, the broken hearted Peshwa\'s mere presence halted any immediate changes in the Maratha position in North India. On the one hand, those who had deserted from Panipat were dealt with severely, namely the leaders who retreated and failed to even hold Delhi in their panic such as Malharrao Holkar, Naro Shankar and the Pawars. Their lands being confiscated for a few months and returned only when conditions were deemed normal. On the other, the soldiers and officers under the Peshwas immediate command worked tirelessly to restore Maratha rule and some sense of order to the Provinces of the North such as Malwa, Bundelkhand and the Doab territories. On the 10th of February, 1761, Gulraj, a diplomatic agent of Abdali reached Malwa and met the Peshwa along with a letter from Abdali which read as follows :\n\n\n***"There is no real reason why there should exist any ill-feeling between you and us ; true you have lost your son and brother in the unfortunate fight : but it was entirely provoked by Bhau Saheb and we could not act otherwise than we did in self-defence. However, we are deeply sorry for these losses. We readily leave to you the subject of the imperial management of Delhi, provided you allow us to hold the Punjab utpo the river Satlaj, and support Shah Alam as the Emperor. You must forget the regrettable events that have taken place and entertain a lasting friendship towards us, which we are anxiously soliciting."***\n\n\n\nThe peace would formally be concluded under Peshwa Madhavrao I, in 1763, since Balaji Bajirao would die soon after receiving news of Vishwasrao\'s death, on the 23rd of June 1761, but for the time being, the situation in the North was **status quo ante**. Ultimately, apart from a blow on Maratha military prestige and taking a toll on the noble houses of the Maratha nation and it\'s de facto ruling dynasty the Peshwas, the Battle and the results thereof, did not reverse the Maratha position to any considerable degree.\n\n\n\n**Actual long term effects of the Panipat disaster, on the Maratha nation and the subcontinent :**\n\n\n\n* **The second coming of the *"Heavenly Born General"*, Madhavrao I, becomes Peshwa :** Born on the 15th of February 1745, Peshwa Madhavrao I, was 16 years old when he ascended to the office of the Peshwa on the 23rd of June, 1761. He was dubbed by Grant Duff as ***"the greatest of the Peshwas"***, while the title may be contested, this fact is not, that Madhavrao I, was responsible along with his contemporaries Mahadji Scindia and Nana Phadnis for the era of Maratha Resurgence. To understand the value of Madhavrao\'s successes, one must first appreciate the odds he was against. From the very beginning, he had to contend against Raghunath Rao, his uncle and Regent, whose overbearing and constant attempt to take over the seat of the Peshwa was a challenge to Madhavrao throughout his career. Added to this was the political opposition to the recovering Maratha nation from every direction. In the Deccan the Nizam of Hyderabad sought to capitalise on the internal dissentions between Raghunath Rao and Madhavrao and waged war against them, only to be defeated by the latter. Another opponent in the south was Hyder Ali, now Sultan of Mysore. In his repeated expeditions against Hyder Ali, Madhavrao reasserted Peshwa military superiority over the south, though not conquering Hyder Ali completely. On the other hand, the Peshwa also contended with the English, and as one of the few princes of the period who had foresight regarding the grants of land to foreign trading companies and the consequences thereof, he never budged to English demands. During his reign, he checked the advances of the Nawabs of Awadh and Rohillkhand, and the Rajputs and strengthened the Maratha position in the Malwa, Bundelkhand and Rajputana regions, constantly keeping a close watch, dispatching forces and relief as necessary and utilising the valuable services of Holkar and Scindia. As Grant Duff said about this Peshwa : ***"And the plains of Panipat were not more fatal to the Maratha Empire than the early end of this excellent Prince"***. Therefore, until his death in 1772, Madhavrao served his nation well and restored and maintained the Maratha position in the North and the south.\n\n\n\n\n* **The rise of giants, Scindia and Phadnis :** Following the defeat of Panipat, Madhavrao I had become Peshwa. During the unfortunately short lived reign of this remarkable scion of the Peshwa line, these two contemporaries served him exceptionally well. However, after his untimely demise in 1772, it would be this duo, which would uphold the fate of the Maratha nation in the years to come. And their efforts would maintain Maratha supremacy at Delhi affairs, until the Second Anglo Maratha war. Mahadji would see a meteoric rise in his career, becoming the plenipotentiary Regent of the Mughal Empire. His Campoos would dominate North Indian battlefields and ensure him continued military success. Meanwhile, at the court at Poona, Nana Phadnis would ensure the protection of Madhavrao II, the continuation of proper administration, financial and external affairs management. Therefore, these two would sustain the Maratha Confederacy until the second Anglo Maratha War.\n\n\n\n\n\n* **The three days of consequence :** On the 14th of January 1761,  the Marathas were routed at Panipat. On the 15th of January, the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam was defeated on the banks of the river Son by a British force under the command of Major Carnac, in a failed attempt to take back Bengal which was lost at Plassey in 1757. On the 16th of January, 1761, French held Pondicherry, fell into British hands, thereby knocking out the only major European rival to British ambitions in the subcontinent. Given the occupation of Madhavrao in the Carnatic and against the Nizam and against the rebellious nobles of his nation, the British were virtually unopposed by any major contender for power in the Indian subcontinent. After the fall of the Angrias in 1756, which made the west coast vulnerable to the English navy, these events meant that the British now foresaw a new era in the political history of the subcontinent. One where for a considerable amount of time, they wouldn\'t have to look over their shoulders for Maratha intervention in their ambitions.\n\n\n\n**Observations :**\n\n\nFrom the above analysis, this much is certain : \n\n\nA) The Third Battle of Panipat, did not change so much the position of the Marathas in the North irreversibly, as much as it introduced a brief spell of undertainty and disorder, which under the capable leadership of Madhavrao, Nana Phadnis, Malharrao Holkar and Mahadji Scindia was restored to order and status quo ante until roughly the end of the 18th century and the Second Anglo Maratha War. \n\n\nB) That the British ascendancy in North India wasn\'t simply a result of the waning of Maratha power, but rather of various events as mentioned above that changed the political relationship of the British with the Mughals, the French and the Marathas and their perceptions of these powers and of their prospects in the subcontinent.\n\n\n**SOURCES**\n\n\n* "New History of the Marathas Vol II" by Govind Sakharam Sardesai\n\n\n* "Fall of the Mughal Empire Vol II" by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n* "Marathas and Panipat" by Hari Ram Gupta\n\n\n* "Peshwa Madhavrao I" by Anil Chandra Bannerjee'<br />Author: 'MaharajadhirajaSawai'  id: 'ony3pc'<br />Score:60<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ony3pc/the_immediate_aftermath_and_long_term_effects_of/</li>

They try to shift onus of responsibility not on the Muslims but on the victims.\n\nThe questions to be pondered upon are: Are the incidences such as attack on the New York WTC and on innocent civilians in Israel, Kashmir, Godhra, Bali and Timor isolated events of Islamic terror? Or is there an existence of a globally well-established behavior pattern throughout the Islamic history?\n\nThose who try to justify Islamic violence on the basis of concocted provocation theories are moral criminals. Indirectly supporting Islamic terror in its endeavor are the newspaper editors, powerful politicians and pseudo-secular ‚ÄòDhimmis‚Äô who at the same time deceitfully hide away the real, ultimate and so-called divine source of such violent acts. Let us have a look at The Koran in which the Allah commands:\n\n1. We shall say, \\`Lay hold of him and bind him. Burn him in the fire of Hell, then fasten him with a chain of 70 cubits long. For he did not believe in Allah. (69:30-33)\n2. Lo! Those who disbelieve our revelations, we shall expose them to fire. As often their skins are consumed we shall exchange them for fresh skins that they may taste the torment. (4:56)\n3. Garments of fire have been prepared for unbelievers. Scalding water shall be poured upon their heads, melting their skins and that, which is in their bellies. They shall be lashed with red-hot iron. (22:19-21)\n4. Lo! Ye and that which ye worship besides Allah are fuel of Hell. (21:98)\n5. ‚Ä¶award of Allah‚Äôs enemies, the fire. Therein is their immortal home. (41:28)\n6. Allah has cursed the unbelievers and proposed for them a blazing Hell. (33:60)\n7. Unbelievers are enemies of Allah and they will roast in Hell . (41:14)\n8. I shall cast terror into the hearts of the infidels. Strike off their heads‚Ä¶ (8:12)\n9. ‚Ä¶slay the idol worshipers wherever you find them. Arrest them, besiege them, and lie in ambush everywhere for them‚Ä¶ (9:5)\n10. Believers! Make war on the infidels who dwell around you‚Ä¶ (9:123)\n\nThis, it appears, is the real source of the provocation which again and again leads Muslims to rise up in riots against non-Muslims. The propaganda of **‚ÄúSarva Dharma Sambhava‚Äù** has blinded us to reality. Can Islam really be called Dharma?\n\nGandhi declared, **‚ÄúIslam is a noble faith.‚Äù** To reconcile Gandhi and Islam the only alternative left is to surrender one‚Äôs rational faculty at the altar of political correctness. That is exactly what happened to the Congress Party after Muslims forced the partition upon India through ‚ÄòDirect Action‚Äô riots. After independence congress party institutionalised this schizophrenic split as the principle of secularism and therefore created the double standards of political behaviour. For Muslims the policy of appeasement and for Hindus the policy of denial.\n\nAs a consequence of these policies, a spectre of deep neurosis is haunting the entire national media and polity. The ‚Äòobsessive-compulsive‚Äô pseudo-secular behaviour of national media can only be explained in psychopathological terms. It is indeed neurosis, which blinds them to see the obvious fact: that the foundation of Indian secularism rests upon the sands of Gandhian falsehood ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Islam is a noble faith‚Äù. The state incorporated this false assumption into its policy without critically examining it. Over the time, false assumptions lead to contradictions and conflict with reality. This is, what is happening all around us and manifesting in  the breakdown of law and order, but it is the collapse of the false assumption of the State ‚Äì that ‚ÄúIslam is a noble faith‚Äù. In fact, this false assumption of nobility of Islam collapsed in 1947 itself evident in the partition of the country, then again in Kashmir and now ironically in Gandhi‚Äôs own province.\n\n**There is plenty of evidence to show that the Muslim behaviour pattern and the mindset have remained unchanged even in the years after 1947. We have witnessed increasing incidence of street riots staged by the same sort of Muslim hooligans, on the same sort of petty pretexts as in the years preceding Partition.** Muslim spokesman, no matter what political platform they use, have levelled the same sort of accusations, namely, that the Muslims are a ‚Äòpoor and persecuted minority‚Äô entirely at mercy of a ‚Äòbrute Hindu majority‚Äô; that ‚ÄòMuslim lives, properties and honour‚Äô are not safe in the midst of a rising tide of ‚ÄòHindu communalism‚Äô; and that ‚ÄòHindu chauvinism‚Äô is seeking to wipe out all vestiges of Muslim religion and culture. It is the Pirpur report of pre-partition Muslim League against Hindus all over once again in Independent India. **This is secularism at the cost of Hindu culture, society and nation.**\n\nMoreover, in pseudo-secular view, the burden of maintaining communal harmony rests entirely on Hindus. It is high time to ask Muslims, what have they done to share this burden after partitioning India in the name of Islam? **What has been the Muslim contribution in maintenance of communal harmony in Independent India?** Does Secularism mean clamouring for special rights and privileges in a secular and democratic State?  Is secularism analogous to a one-way traffic?\n\n‚ÄúIt is also an undeniable fact that while the Muslims, especially the elite, expect the Hindus to protect them, they failed to protect the Hindus during the ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Hindus in Jammu and Kashmir. This cannot go on forever.‚Äù  (Rajaram NS.)\n\n**After partition of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have become Islamic fix deposits but India is a joint current account that can be operated at will.** In independent India, the secularism has degenerated into an instrument in the hands of militant Muslims and Nehruvian establishment to blackmail and harass Hindu majority. The political and cultural oppression in the name of secularism is now unacceptable to Hindus and Shri Ram Janam-Bhoomi movement is the expression of this change.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Source:* [*https://cisindus.org/2019/12/23/on-the-nature-of-islam/*](https://cisindus.org/2019/12/23/on-the-nature-of-islam/)'<br />Author: 'madeinbharat'  id: 'onf04m'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/onf04m/on_the_nature_of_islam/</li>

There is a new breed of Insurance policies out there which we need to talk about.'<br />Body: 'Around last year, in Policy Baazar website, a 1crore health insurance policy came up of Aditya Birla Group at similar costs as a 10lakh policy (Around 10k). This policy had some limitations, but still it became super popular and the best seller of the website.\n\nSoon other companies started launching similar 1 crore plans, and now due to healthy competition, there are policies of 1crore with seemingly no negative points at the same cost as 10lakh worth normal policies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lnaxyomon4c71.jpg?width=1378&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d32d03a089e4001829c1243809ea80988334587f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what is the catch? I can\'t figure out any. And that is the reason for this post.\n\nThere are no room sublimits or anything. But some of them have maximum room choice as "Single Private AC Room" which is totally fine as the room above it is Suite which is usually not needed.\n\nBut if you want room at "all categories" then some of them offers it if you increase the premium, but doesn\'t seem worth it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A case study :- HDFC ERGO\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn HDFC ERGO, they have a policy called Koti Suraksha which offers 1crore policy at around 12k for those younger than 35 with no illness. It may slightly increase if your age increases or have any illness. but this is the standard price. There is no sublimits for room rent but the max allowed is Single Private AC Room.\n\nYou get a choice of 3 Zones when trying to make payment. The default policy covers all hospitals all over the country except for few expensive cities mentioned where if you get hospitalized, you will have to pay 20% of the bill out of your pocket. But their zones are quite good especially for south Indians as the default plan covers entire southern India.\n\nIf you want to cover all of India except Delhi, then it would cost 2k more. If you want Delhi too, then it would cost further 3k more. Delhi seems to be very expensive! For most of the people I don\'t think this is required and cover without these cities is fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zef6puoqn4c71.jpg?width=1494&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5eeb275515975af13af225badffb6dacf93740a1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHDFC ERGO has two other policies, first one called Optima Restore offers 10lakhs premium at 11k and another one at 10k. But there appears to be no major extra benefit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jh9fbufsn4c71.jpg?width=2567&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55f3ec0cd5a3e91d8816a9a3a2fcb9d254bb3190\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**There are only 3 Major Differences I have found between the 10L policies and 1 Crore one.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Room will be Single Standard AC Room.** While in other two, there is no such mention, so you can even choose Suite. But the thing is, if you are sick, and you are in hospital, and your plan is only 10lakhs, you don\'t want to waste that money by choosing Suite as then you will quickly run out of your 10lakhs... So you will probably end up taking a room lower than standard AC room. Probably a non AC room to save money! Meanwhile if you had the 1Cr policy, you wouldn\'t have to worry about that.\n2. On few mentioned procedures shown in picture below , this 1CR policy has a sublimit of 75000. But, it seems that these are Illnesses that can be covered within that price range.\n3. The other two policies seem to cover ALL India, and doesn\'t have the zone choices. But this isn\'t an issue, as if you live in those zones, you can pay extra and get it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3dhtsw0wn4c71.jpg?width=1624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8587fff719ed06aca1025b7fa4470aae05c10b1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI couldn\'t find any issues with this 1 crore policy. So if there is someone who knows better, please comment out any other defects this plan may have. Or anything I missed. Otherwise, it seems like a crazy good plan. I guess it works out for the company because the medical expenses of most people will remain below 10L no matter which plan they choose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Few extra benefits\n\n# \n\n1. The 1cr policy require you to take medical checkup before they approve it to verify you don\'t have any illness. But this is a good thing as now you have proof that you did not lie about anything. Generally, if you get a big disease within 4 years of getting a new policy, health Insurers sometimes try to argue that you lied to them saying you have no illness, but after doing medical checkup they can\'t do that, thus you get a strong safety regarding those things.\n2. 1cr policy gives free health checkup up to Rs5000 every year! The other policies only give till Rs2000. Any diseases found in future checkups does not affect your policy or its premiums.\n3. Once you get a disease or get hospitalized for something serious, it is near impossible to get a policy with higher sum-insured as no insurer will be ready to take that risk at any reasonable costs. So if you take 10L policy, you will be stuck with that much, meanwhile with 1cr, even if you get stuck with it, the amount is big enough to be sufficient even many decades from now.\n\n# Conclusion - It seems to be Very Good policy, unless I am missing something...'<br />Author: 'Fdsn'  id: 'on9tmf'<br />Score:101<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/on9tmf/rs_900_per_month_gets_you_a_1_crore_health/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'islamist groups may attempt a hostage taking operation in afghanistan'<br />Body: "Afghanistan is in a very bad situation. The government is falling and its military cannot stop the taliban from advancing. Afghan president ashraf ghani has alleged that 10,000 pakistani terrorists have entered his country. vice president saleh claimed that pakistani military threatened to launch missiles at afghan forces if they attacked taliban positions on the border. Around the same time the daughter of the afghan ambassador to pakistan was abducted and brutally tortured. the ambassador has now been recalled.\n\nIndia has evacuated its staff from its kandahar consulate while indian expatriates elsewhere in the country are in the process of leaving. these include ex-prison staff from India. diplomats continue to work from kabul in dangerous conditions. for the pakistani and pashtun forces invading afghanistan the general situation is enticing but it also offers a shrinking window of opportunity for a medium risk high reward operation: the capture of indian hostages and exchanging them for high value terrorists in Indian jails.\n\nMany terrorists with links to pakistan are currently in Indian jails. Indian mujahideen LeT ISIS they are all there and many have received death sentence. they get tortured and sexually abused on a frequent basis. you can see this in movies like omerta. securing their release will ensure pakistan remains in the good graces of the islamist world while also outwitting its enemy india. this will ensure more charity donations from rich arab countries which is vital for pakistan's economy. \n\nIn march 2020 ISIS-K with help from the haqqani network attacked a sikh gurudwara in Kabul. Their goal was to kill as many as possible. today if i were a strategist in a pakistani terror group i would order the abduction of indian citizens in afghanistan. this is not to a psych op piece against indians. analysts are trained to apply creativity and view the situation from the perspective of the opposition. this identifies gaps in the security system and subsequent countermeasures reduce the odds of a prospective attack succeeding. \n\nyou may recall that i had made a post predicting a JMB-I attack during Modi's visit to bangladesh. fortunately that did not take place. however at least 15 JMB terrorists are known to have infiltrated india in recent weeks and spread across the country. Not all of them have not been apprehended. I posted that article on the evening of march 20. that same night 3 men set fire to 5 shops in ahmedabad. they had received money from paytm accounts and hawala. they were about to purchase weapons to kill prominent people when the police arrested them. these men were anil, ankit and praveen. The money was routed from Pakistan. the fact that even criminals who happen to be hindu are ready to do pakistans bidding is a cause for serious concern.\n\nOn June 17 a bomb exploded at darbhanga railway station. LeT men had hidden it in a bundle of clothes and according to nia it was supposed to explode on the train and kill many people. on june 23 a car bomb exploded near hafiz saeed's house killing 3. the terrorist leader was later reported to be inside the house at the time of the blast. pakistan announced the arrest of several people allegedly behind the attack. it said they were directed by the intelligence agency of a neighbouring country. on june 27 drones presumably operating from pakistan bombed the indian air force station at jammu. in july it was reported that the al qaeda module busted in up was being handled from pakistan. this is a series of escalations that can have serious consequences. soon after the march 2020 gurudwara attack, afghan intelligence arrested the head of ISIS-K. he was found to have links with pakistani intelligence. i think this time pakistan may attempt to use the same organisation. if they capture or kill indians especially senior ranking officials in large numbers it might provoke new delhi into reacting the way the islamists have been dreaming of for a very long time. of course i hope this doesn't happen but it's a possibility indian agencies must not ignore."<br />Author: 'Special-Finger-4576'  id: 'on5j51'<br />Score:30<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/on5j51/islamist_groups_may_attempt_a_hostage_taking/</li>

      <li>Title::: "If there is any lawyer in this forum, please guide me? Where do I file this case to remove my husband's name from my daughter's birth certificate?"<br />Body: "This question is directed to all the lawyers who can give me an advice on this. Legally a father's name cannot be removed from birth certificate but I want to remove it and want to approach the court. I want to know where should I file the case -  High Court or Supreme Court? The reason is simple - I feel my ex husband was just a sperm donor, he did not do anything for me or my daughter. My daughter was born in Pune. \n\nFor more clarity, let me give you some background - My husband never worked after marriage. He left his job in Mumbai and shifted with me to Pune saying he will look for a job there but he never really did. He met with a heart attack after 1.5 months of marriage, the entire expense of hospital was borne by my company's medical insurance. I got his treatment in one of the best private hospital in Pune. He spent all his time chatting to his numerous girlfriends on FB, whatapps, calls etc. He used to make me believe it was all for his networking. I found him cheating on me number of times and I showed it to him and his family. he never was ashamed, he kept doing it. He used to hit me, abuse me physically and verbally all the time. I even found he kissed my friend in my house 15 days after my marriage when she was drunk. Yet I was adjusting with him, I stopped saying anything to him for the sake of my peace of mind, I knew he will never change. I stopped meeting my friends, even stopped calling my family or relatives because he was always suspicious. Then I got pregnant, like all foolish women I thought this will change after the kid is born. He came to hit me with a rod when I was 2 months pregnant and the next time when he tried to physically abuse me I complained my neighbor for the first time because I was worried about my unborn child's safety and he vanished that day never to return. I waited for a long time, I filed a missing complaint. People kept telling me to file a domestic violence case. I approached NCW for redressal even after all these but nothing worked. One day he sent an email to NCW which was forwarded to me saying I was the reason for his heart attack, that day I cried a lot and eventually went ahead and filed the case of 498A in the police station after 6 months. I gave him 6 months to rectify his mistakes. I worked till the last day of pregnancy, even though maternity leave was extended from 3 months to 6 months I knew I will need leaves later. I was all alone during my entire pregnancy, had no one to take care of me, managed home, doctor visits, office, groceries everything all alone. It was extremely tough. Mine was a C-section which is termed as a major surgery yet I was on my toes the second day, asked the doctor to remove drips, etc. never had a day's rest. I informed him and his mom the same day my daughter was born yet no one came. After my daughter was 1 month old I moved to Guwahati to stay with mom and bro. My daughter is 4 years old now.\n\nI met him once in the court when my daughter was 7 months old. I asked him if he wants to see his daughter's face, he bluntly denied.\n\nI always say he vanishing was a blessing in disguise for me. Otherwise we (me and my daughter) would have still been in hell. That men was of no good.. he never did anything apart from abusing, hitting me and talking to numerous girlfriends on phone, whatsapp, fb, etc.. He never went out to work after marriage neither did anything at home. My life was hard then and still is but had he been around it would have been the living hell. He was suspicious of everything and everyone.. he used to abuse me like anything.. he used to pick me up and drop me to office yet he used to call me Vaishya, bahaar jaake dhanda karne waali, randi etc. What impact these things would have had on my daughter?? In a way I am happy he left on his own will.. I wouldn't have been able to walk out due to pressure from society and family.. and that's the whole problem. I speak to a lot of women, they are in an abusive relationships yet can't walk out due to children, society and family pressures and also due to fear of the unknown.. they don't know how life will be treating them and how she will handle her kids alone.. they say I am strong but I feel being strong was the only option I had.. it was destiny rather than my choice.. \n\nThe irony is I don't find a single person who tells me to keep fighting, everyone says - just move on, leave it. No one says I am with you, continue to fight if that gives you a mental satisfaction, they say karma will take care of him. They feel i am taking a revenge, they fail to understand I need justice. I need justice because had he been a good man my daughter would have had a father and I wouldn't have to struggle for everything everyday.. I need a closure.. I will not give it up no matter who is with me and who is not. Does he deserve to be called her father? For me he is a sperm donor and he has no right to be in my daughter's birth certificate hence I need to file a case in the court to get his name removed. Where do I file the case is my question? Would the court grant me virtual hearing?"<br />Author: 'only_mann'  id: 'omw9zs'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/omw9zs/if_there_is_any_lawyer_in_this_forum_please_guide/</li>

      <li>Title::: '1 Crore Health Insurance at the same cost as 10 Lakh ones with seemingly no negatives!! There is a new breed of Insurance policies out there which we need to talk about.'<br />Body: 'Around last year, in Policy Baazar website, a 1crore health insurance policy came up of Aditya Birla Group at similar costs as a 10lakh policy (Around 10k). This policy had some limitations, but still it became super popular and the best seller of the website.\n\nSoon other companies started launching similar 1 crore plans, and now due to healthy competition, there are policies of 1crore with seemingly no negative points at the same cost as 10lakh worth normal policies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/syqk0enlwzb71.jpg?width=1378&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a2c747e9280ac798ee639683aa27aa857d1e4b8\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what is the catch? I can\'t figure out any. And that is the reason for this post.\n\nThere are no room sublimits or anything. But some of them have maximum room choice as "Single Private AC Room" which is totally fine as the room above it is Suite which is usually not needed.\n\nBut if you want room at "all categories" then some of them offers it if you increase the premium, but doesn\'t seem worth it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A case study :- HDFC ERGO\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn HDFC ERGO, they have a policy called Koti Suraksha which offers 1crore policy at around 12k for those younger than 35 with no illness. It may slightly increase if your age increases or have any illness. but this is the standard price. There is no sublimits for room rent but the max allowed is Single Private AC Room. \n\nYou get a choice of 3 Zones when trying to make payment. The default policy covers all hospitals all over the country except for few expensive cities mentioned where if you get hospitalized, you will have to pay 20% of the bill out of your pocket. But their zones are quite good especially for south Indians as the default plan covers entire southern India.\n\nIf you want to cover all of India except Delhi, then it would cost 2k more. If you want Delhi too, then it would cost further 3k more. Delhi seems to be very expensive! For most of the people I don\'t think this is required and cover without these cities is fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5vgflw0dkzb71.jpg?width=1494&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4473a9b4c2c9b57151d34fc88c3ea0f2c79a3419\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHDFC ERGO has two other policies, first one called Optima Restore offers 10lakhs premium at 11k and another one at 10k. But there appears to be no major extra benefit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i30qzt7iszb71.jpg?width=2567&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4684d2dadcd3b27d0766aa2cfa93ca9c95d606f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**There are only 3 Major Differences I have found between the 10L policies and 1 Crore one.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Room will be Single Standard AC Room.** While in other two, there is no such mention, so you can even choose Suite. But the thing is, if you are sick, and you are in hospital, and your plan is only 10lakhs, you don\'t want to waste that money by choosing Suite as then you will quickly run out of your 10lakhs... So you will probably end up taking a room lower than standard AC room. Probably a non AC room to save money! Meanwhile if you had the 1Cr policy, you wouldn\'t have to worry about that.\n2. On few already mentioned procedures, this 1CR policy has a sublimit of 75000. But, it seems that these are Illnesses that can be covered within that price range.\n3. The other two policies seem to cover ALL India, and doesn\'t have the zone choices. But this isn\'t an issue, as if you live in those zones, you can pay extra and get it.\n\nAnother thing is that the 1 crore plan has one more limit\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yiuap0khtzb71.jpg?width=1624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=365fd06718bbfb85649481505aa96c18a1362819\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI couldn\'t find any issues with this 1 crore policy. So if there is someone who knows better, please comment out any other defects this plan may have. Or anything I missed. Otherwise, it seems like a crazy good plan. I guess it works out for the company because the medical expenses of most people will remain below 10L no matter which plan they choose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion - It seems to be Very Good policies, unless I am missing something...'<br />Author: 'Fdsn'  id: 'omtjcd'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/omtjcd/1_crore_health_insurance_at_the_same_cost_as_10/</li>

Will wait and report on that.\n\nThen I ordered from different account the same phone on exchange and COD. The exchange amount was Rs 2800.\n\nThis phone was delivered in 2 days flat. But the agent checked the phone minutely and for flimsy reasons, reduced the exchange to Rs 1200.\n\nI have ordered multiple phones via Amazon and their exchange is very easy.

      <li>Title::: '"If we had the atom bomb, we would have used it against the British" -Mahatma Gandhi. Non-violence, Gandhi is stating, was a Pragmatic method in the unique circumstances instead of a pacifist, unrealistic Moral High Ground lens that most young Indians equate Gandhi with.'<br />Body: ' "There was a time when people listened to me because I showed them how to give fight to the British without arms when they had no arms and the British Government was fully equipped and organised for an armed fight. But today I am told that my non-violence can be of no avail against the communal madness and, therefore, people should arm themselves for self-defence. If this is true, it has to be admitted that our thirty years of nonviolent practice was an utter waste of time. We should have from the beginning trained ourselves in the use of arms. But I do not agree that our thirty years\' probation in nonviolence has been utterly wasted. It was due to our non-violence, defective though it was, that we were able to bear up under the heaviest repression and the message of independence penetrated every nook and corner of India. But as our non-violence was the nonviolence of the weak, the leaven did not spread. Had we adopted non-violence as the weapon of the strong, because we realised that it was more effective than any other weapon, in fact the mightiest force in the world, we would have made use of its full potency and not have discarded it as soon as the fight against the British was over or we were in a position to wield conventional weapons. But as I have already said, we adopted it out of our helplessness. If we had the atom bomb, we would have used it against the British."\n\nSpeech (16 June 1947) as the official date for Indian independence approached (15 August 1947),\xa0as quoted in\xa0Mahatma Gandhi: The Last Phase\xa0(1958)\xa0by\xa0Pyarelal Nayyar, p. 326\xa0\\[10\\]  \n\n\nThe quote it comes from talks about the power of nonviolence as a movement and that non violence perpetrated by the strong (rather than the weak as it was in the dynamic between India and the British) would be one of the most powerful forces in the world. But he also points out the obvious fallacy that *if India were a nuclear superpower or allied with one as the British were, they would not have needed to use pacifism as a political movement to gain their independence and it would never have gained the momentum it ended up generating.* It would have been used or threatened to be used because it would have been the obvious means by which India would gain its independence.   \n\n\n**Non-violence, Gandhi is stating, was a Pragmatic method in the circumstances instead of Idealistic Moral High Ground**.

      <li>Title::: 'Why are Indians being targeted in South Africa, an analysis'<br />Body: 'Jacob Zuma is South Africa\'s first Zulu President. He was found guilty and sentenced for taking huge bribes from two Indian businessmen, the Gupta brothers. \n\nThe Zulu\'s are a powerful political group in SA who have a history of protesting to seek greater autonomy, despite, or because of high levels of crime and poverty in the KwaZulu-Natal province. Indians otoh are an affluent business community in South Africa based mainly in Durban and Johannesburg, but they are a minority of 2.5%. They are the largest population of Indians outside of India. \n\nFor Zuma\'s supporters who are very poor and marginalized Zuma is great Zulu ray of hope. Indians are seen by them as outsiders getting rich off the Zulus, and this is a rhetoric people like Zuma have carefully cultivated.\n\nThe majority of people tend to prefer ridiculously simple solutions to difficult problems. For example, "if only we got rid of the Indians all corruption in ZA will end" is appealing because it doesn\'t blame the majority. \n\nThis is the same reason people get suckered into buying instant fat loss pills instead of diet control and exercise, or lose all their money on lottery schemes instead of working hard and saving money.\n\nWe have several such "savior" politicians in India who have a very similar model of politics. They claim to fight for social justice for the backward classes and blame a small minority like the Brahmins and upper castes for everything that is wrong. It\'s a myopic and reductionist rhetoric, but it appeals to the victim mentality. Their supporters are looking for an excuse to feel better about themselves. They naturally ignore the shocking corruption of their own leaders because they have been taught to think that all their mistakes are because of others.\n\nThe objective of the planned civil unrest is to stoke the xenophobia for two reasons: 1. Send the message that Zuma is too powerful to touch; 2. Imply it wasn\'t Zuma\'s fault, it was the nasty Gupta brothers all along, those damn Indians corrupting the honest Zulu. Everything will be ok if we teach the Indians a lesson.\n\nIn Mao\'s China too nobody criticized him to his face, and when they finally worked up enough courage after his death, they decided to criticize his fourth wife for misleading Mao in his old age, and sentenced her to death. Yeah, like Mao could be led by anyone. \n\nThe point is that if one takes a very zoomed out view it is easy to see that whatever is happening in South Africa also happens everywhere else. \n\nUS politics is the same, one side says if only we got rid of blacks and hispanics this country can be saved. The other side says if only we got rid of the gun and Jesus loving fanatics this country can be saved. \n\nIt\'s all scape goat politics and divide and rule.'<br />Author: 'greasesoda'  id: 'okm04j'<br />Score:215<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/okm04j/why_are_indians_being_targeted_in_south_africa_an/</li>

Born out of a compulsion to serve the desire of the Mahatma to empower the people with the pen, Sulekha is the story of sacrifice: of the indomitable spirit of self-sufficiency, of a way of life that did not cower before the might of injustice, even as it sought to economically empower the people by creating a product that not only substituted costly imported inks but was also globally competitive in its own right.\n\nToday Sulekha pays tribute to those halcyon days when Swadeshi was a way of life and Nationalism was represented even in the ink that was used to write the words that spewed fire against the foreign yoke. Swadeshi was the soul of Swaraj and to be Swadhin was the goal of our forefathers to whom we pay our humble tribute. The naming is deliberate: the terms used, chosen to represent a value system that we continue to believe in and espouse.\n\n**Swadeshi comes in 3 colours: Royal Blue, Executive Black and Scarlet Red, all packed inside a Khadi Botua from Santiniketan.

      <li>Title::: 'Why the population bill is a bad idea'<br />Body: "I'll get straight to the points :\n\n1. Demographically we have seen different communities respond differently to population control and reduction measures with Hindus declining fastest and Muslims staying at higher number for longest. This will bring a forced demographic change which will lead to instability.\n\n2. While some Northern states have much higher TFR , it has helped offset a Europe like situation in South where TFR has fallen much below replacement. Once it falls , no country has been able to bring it back up.\n\n3. India's current TFR is 2.2 a whisker away from the needed 2.1\n\n4. India has a big base pyramid, which means it works on long term momentum , even bringing a policy this late into the game will translate into changes a much later when TFR would already be much lower. Worst case scenario see population peaking by 2050-60.\n\n5. Case study : pre 1970's India had one of the highest rates of male vasectomy, due to Sanjay Gandhi's barbaric and forceful nasbandi program that number literally dropped from millions to nill and is currently in the thousands. The muslim population in UP has already started seeing an appreciable in its high TFR which might see a similar reversal to what happened earlier when government tried such ham fisted approach in a personal human manner.\n\n\n6. This policy would be a big drain on resources for UP government especially when the incentives provided are to government employees who already have lesser sized families compared to a poor farmer or daily wage labourer.\n\nConclusion : What we have statistically seen to work in best way possible is to increase average age of marriage for women and to encourage bigger gaps between children both for the health of women the child and to allow them to pursue better pursuits in life that contribute to economic and social upliftment.\n\nFinally , gradualness of change and empowerment has the advantage of not drawing attention to the extremes of inequality and the concentration of wealth and power that rapid growth entails, as it has in so many fast-growing economies. The power of the Indian upper economic class has endured because notwithstanding the vulgarity of wealth, the corruption of politics, the prejudices of casteism and  communalism, a vast majority has come to accept the gradualness of change in their own lives. Their acquiescence is in this gradualness contributes to the resilience of India."<br />Author: 'jaeger123'  id: 'ojgbk8'<br />Score:55<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ojgbk8/why_the_population_bill_is_a_bad_idea/</li>

According to IB sources, the entire exercise is aimed at developing organised resistance against police action.\n\n‚ÄúThe Maoists have realised that the best way to reach out to the people is through NGOs and human rights groups. Since the NGOs are not under police scrutiny it is easy for the Maoist rebels to expand their support base without inviting trouble,‚Äù a senior IB official told DNA.\n\nSources said the Maoist-NGO nexus is being developed in two ways. ‚ÄúIn some cases, wanted Maoist guerrillas join reputed NGOs as volunteers and then under the garb of social work do their networking.

      <li>Title::: 'How effective were European-style infantry units as raised in the 1800s in India? With a special reference to the Campoo batallions of Benoit de Boigne, raised for the army of Mahadji Scindia.'<br />Body: 'I think it would be prudent to begin this analysis by first exploring some background into what led to the emergence of these formations in the armies of contemporary Indian states during the 18th century.\n\n\n\n***How and why did these formations emerge?***\n\n\n\nThe realisation of the inherent value of having reliable firepower in the hands of infantry formations in an army, had dawned upon Indian monarchs by the late 16th century, and arming a certain section of one\'s infantry according to how many musketeers one\'s finances would allow them to afford, became a trend in Indian militaries since then. Most states enjoyed limited success or abject failure, but none compared to the predominant power in the subcontinent which was the Mughal Empire. For a century or so, the Mughal Empire, outgunned it\'s neighbours and opponents. Yet, with the advent of trading companies and the opening of the subcontinent and it\'s commercial markets to the world, the military technologies, tactics and systems of Europe and European military adventurers, who would hire out their services to the highest bidders also arrived in India. Hence, when the Mughal Empire fractured, when the Maratha rise under Peshwa Bajirao Ballal from the 1720s onwards made the perception of Mughal invincibility nothing more than an illusion, the states that were once Mughal vassals and allies such as the Rajput kingdoms, the states that had rebelled against and gained autonomy from the Mughals such as the Jats and the Sikhs and Marathas, and the States that had succeeded the Mughal Empire but who still recognised the nominal authority of the Mughal Emperor while for all practical purposes functioned as autonomous entities such as Awadh and Hyderabad, got into the business of acquiring substantial numbers of musket armed infantry, to hold and expand their newly acquired territory and autonomy.\n\n\n\nBut while the realisation that firepower was necessary on the modern battlefield was dawning upon Indian monarchs it would still take until the 1750s and 60s, for any formidable Sepoy trained batallions to surface on the scene in 18th century India. Among these corps was the one commanded by Ibrahim Khan Gardi, a former Commandant de la Garde to Charles Joseph Patissier, Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau, he was trained in the French discipline and way of warfare by the latter during his service under him. He was then employed in the army of the Nizam of Hyderabad and his title "Gardi" was a souvenir from his service under his previous commander, a derogation of "Garde". Under the Nizam he was able to raise 2000 men, trained and drilled in the European/French fashion and had an efficient artillery arm to support his infantry. Having impressed upon the young Sadashivrao Bhau, cousin of the then Peshwa of the Maratha Confederacy Balaji Bajirao, during the former\'s campaign against the Nizam, the value of drilled sepoys and artillery firepower in warfare, he was soon employed in Maratha armies under the direct command of Sadashivrao Bhau, who allowed him to raise between 8000-10,000 "Gardi Musketeers" as his batallions would come to be known and a park of around 60 cannons. Ofcourse, these Gardi Musketeers, while enjoying limited success in the Deccan, they were ultimately destroyed in their entirety at the Third Battle of Panipat, 1761. The battle was an excellent education into the inherent weaknesses of such batallions, but more on that later.\n\n\n\nTherefore, it was first the realisation that a musket armed infantry was crucial and often decisive on a battlefield that prompted Indian monarchs to begin employing such formations in their armies. While some accomplished this under later Mughal rule, almost every monarch of note began trying to accomplish the same once the Empire\'s inevitable demise became apparent after the 1720s. Next, it was the education from harsh experiences such as the Battle of Karnal, the Carnatic Wars where regular European and French/English trained Indian Sepoys made a mockery of the forces of the Nawabs and Rajas of the Carnatic who grossly outnumbered them, that Indian monarchs learned the value and effectiveness of well drilled and disciplined infantry formations. Hence, from the 1750s, onwards, it was considered necessary to have such formations in one\'s armies and the avenues for the acquisition of these formations were several. Monarchs could pay military adventures to train and maintain and lead such troops, they could employ natives who were under the employ of the armies of the trading companies by seducing them with greater monetary prospects, or they could pay these companies to maintain such formations for them in their territory often bearing a huge cost for their maintainance and pasting with some elements of autonomy in trade and authority over their territories in the process.\n\n\n\nIt must be apparent, that any monarch who wished to expand and control his territories, chose one or both of the former options.\n\n\n\n***Mahadji and De Boigne : The Foundations Of An Invincible Army***\n\n\n\nNext, we arrive at the question of how did these troops fare against both - other Indian armies and the armies of the trading companies. For this we must first delve into the issue of how these troops were raised, how were they organised, how did they fit into the army as but one arm of a multi faceted instrument of destruction, and how did the various archaic elements of Indian armies interact with and respond to these troops. I think one of the best examples of a European military adventurer employed by an Indian Prince, to raise and command Indian sepoys drilled along European lines is that of Benoit de Boigne and his employ under Mahadji Scindia. While so much could be said of the life of these two men, we are for now, concerned about the performance of the Sepoy formations raised by the former in their service of the latter. De Boigne had entered Scindia\'s service in early 1784, while the latter in November of the same year, was assigned "Vakil-i-Mutlak" or the plenipotentiary Regent of the Mughal Empire, an office which combined the Wazirhsip and the Mir Bakshi functions. Only once in history had such a post been created by the Mughal Emperor and that was by Muhammad Shah who appointed Nizam-ul-Mulk to this position around the dawn of the 18th century. The task before Mahadji Scindia now, was to bring to submission the many rebellious chiefs, commanders of forts and garrisons, former vassal/allied Rajputs and local zamindars and Jagirdars who had ceased to acknowledge Mughal sovereignty and pay their obligated share of revenue from the taxes they collected from their territories. It would be for this endeavour, and to secure and expand his position and domain in Hindustan (North India) that Mahadji enlisted De Boigne, and had him raise Batallions of sepoys from Oudh and Rohillkhand, which the latter accomplished and raised a force of roughly 12,000 (privates, officers, water carriers and artillerymen included) after initial setback during the Lalsot campaign. This is the force, whose performance and failures should shed some light into the reasons for the military successes and failures of Indian Sepoy formations. For analysing the performance of these troops, we can look at the their actions during a few battles. But first, we must at least look at the organisation of these troops under De Boigne and their overall disposition.\n\n\n\n***De Boigne\'s Campoos, Organisation, Logistics and Equipment***\n\n\n\nThe most accurate description of De Boigne\'s corps, which at it\'s zenith reached two brigades in 1793, exists in an official note prepared for the Governor-General Sir John Shore in the same year. We find that the 2 brigades were subdivided into 10 batallions each, 6 of which which recruited from Oudh and made up of upper castes (Brahmins and Rajputs/Purbiyas) armed with flintlocks and were called *Telingas*. The remaining 4 were recruited from Rohillkhand, they were called *Najibs* and were armed with matchlocks. Each Batallion was made up of 8 companies of 68 men each (52 privates, 12 officers, 2 bandsmen and 2 water carriers otherwise known as *bhistis*) and 23 staff members ( 10 officers, 1 surgeon, 2 clerks, 1 *bhisti* major, 5 musket stock makers and 1 *pandit*), giving the total strength of the battalion as 567 men. This gives the total strength of the Campoos as around 12,000 men. Each batallion had two European officers i.e a Captain and a Lieutenant at Rs. 400 and Rs. 200 a. month respectively. A European Sgt. Major at Rs. 60 a month and the highest Indian officers were the Subahdars at Rs. 40 a month. The salary of each man of the rank and file was Rs. 5 a month.\n\n\nTo each brigade were attached 1000 Ruhellas (Afghans from Rohillkhand), armed with matchlocks, meant to act as skirmishing troops, capable of making use of the terrain and sniping at the enemy in defensive positions.\n\n\nThe cavalry was made up of (A) The Guards Regiment or De Boigne\'s personal guard of 300 regulars (men and officers), mounted on bay colour horses of excellent breed and quality, plus 75 irregulars for skirmishing and 32 mounted gunners for the light "galloper guns" attached to this formation, bringing the strength to 407 men. (B) These were the Cavalry attached to the brigade, 150 regulars (men and officers) and 75 irregulars each. These were all *shiladars* or men who provided their own mounts and equipment, for double pay. There were no Europeans in the cavalry.\n\n\nFinally, was De Boigne\'s magnum opus. His artillery. Each batallion had 5 guns attached to it, making a total of 100 field pieces, plus the 4 (3 pounder) galloper guns of the Guard cavalry and the "Park of Artillery" consisting of 1000 men. The ammunition provided to these formations was at a rate so liberal, it was unknown anywhere else in India. 45 rounds of grape and 12 shells for each howitzer, 400 rounds for each 3-pounder and 300 rounds for each 6-pounder a piece. Each gun was drawn by 8 bullocks and their tumbrill by 12 such beasts. 4 camels carried 240 rounds each for each "galloper gun", the guns being manned by 8 mounted gunners each and drawn by 2 horses each and *never* unlimbered, so as to pour death into the enemy lines at a moments notice. The man in charge of manufacturing De Boigne\'s arsenal was a Scottish watch-maker of great skill and abilities, by the name of Sangster. He was first appointed in charge of the arsenal and factory at Agra and then all other factories/*karkhane* passed under his supervision. According to EEIC observers, his muskets which were produced at Rs. 10 each were equal in quality to EEIC standards. Meanwhile his cannons were superior to all other native powers and almost a match for European ones. Wellington himself marvelled "*The iron guns are European made.... The brass guns, howitzers and mortars have been cast in Indian but the whole have a design and execution of a European artists..... The gun carriages are strong and good, after the French design*" \n\n\n\nIn terms of logistics he hadn\'t slackened either. Each batallion had 2 camels to carry 8 large bell tents for the sick, another 2 camels carried tents for the *Golandazes* and *Khalasis* attached to the guns, and 16 more to carry the sepoy\'s baggage. A total 20 camels per batallion, along with 2 hackery carts to carry the arms of the sick, tools for the sappers and wood cutters as well as other equipment of note.\n\n\n\nFinally, a word on De Boigne\'s consideration for the men who fought for him. He ensured that "any man wounded received a gift, and in proportion to his wound anywhere from 15 days to 3-4 months pay" without any stoppage of salaries during his time of cure. The disabled reiceved a pension for life, equal to half their regular pay, plus lands, and the deceased men\'s families were given the man\'s lands and property as compensation. These measures placed him above any Indian Prince of the era. Caring for his men, something most Indian states ignored. As such, in later campaigns, he commanded more respect and loyalty than most contemporary commanders.\n\n\n\n**BATTLE OF PATAN, 21st of JUNE, 1790**\n\n\nThe seeds for the campaign and battle of Patan were sown in the aftermath of the Battle of Lalsot fought three years earlier in 1787. Mahadji as *Vakil-i-Mutlak*, had demanded from the Jaipur Raja his arrears, due to the Mughal Emperor who was his nominal suzerain to the tune of Rs. 63,00,000. These the Raja refused to pay, and under the guise of negotiations forged an anti-Scindia alliance with Jodhpur state and a few Mughal general such as Ismail Beg. This alliance faced the vanguard and forward detachment of Scindia\'s army at the Battle of Tunga (Lalsot) in 1787. The main body under Scindia being miles away. The Sepoy batallions at this stage had numbered only 1300, yet they gave a good account of themselves, rallying under Boigne despite initial setback and while the battle was tactically indecisive, the event was a strategic failure for Mahadji who was now in worse off conditions. He was already under debt of Rs. 80 lacs at Mathura when he was made *Vakil-i-Mutlak*, his payments for his troops were in more than 30 months of arrears and now his army and morale were weakened. Yet, Mahadji executed a steady retreat yo Mathura. He had struck his own coins, the "Nana-Shahi ruppee", he provided ample funds to De Boigne to raise new batallions and the latter raised, drilled and organised 13 batallions in 6 months. Mahadj had sworn as he retreated from Lalsot, when he turned to face the land or Jaipur and said "If I live I shall burn Jaipur and Jodhpur to ashes".\n\n\nThe campaign had begun in 1790, and the two armies came face to face on 21st of June. Until about sunset, neither side committed its forces in the fighting, exchanging cannon fire and skirmishing with their troopers. By dusk, the Rajputs retreated to their camps, while the Marathas maintained their positions. This was when the realm fighting began, owing to unforeseen events. According to Jadunath Sarkar : *3 hours before sunset, some Maratha Pindaris from the left wing of Maratha lines, managed to seize animals that were a part of Ismail Beg\'s contingent. This inevitably led to a small skirmish with Ismail Beg\'s men. General de Boigne then directed his guns on Ismail Beg\'s contingent. Caught on unaware, the murderous fire of Maratha guns proved to be deadly. Gopal Bhau and de Boigne, sensing victory, went for the kill. Marathas descended upon enemy camps. Taken aback by the suddenness and the ferocity of the Maratha attack, Rajput resistance capitulated, many were slaughtered in their sleep while others were too intoxicated to fight. The only event worth noting was the Rathor charge on the Maratha right wing. The 4,000 strong Holkar contingent was saved by swift reinforcements sent by Gopal Bhau. The Jaipur Nagas were forced in their positions by the two battalions sent by Boigne. De Boigne after routing the centre and left wing of the alliance, turned all of his forces to the right. The Rathors were soon surrounded and routed, resulting in heavy losses and the death of the Jodhpur general Gangaram*. As a result of this action, Ismail Beg\'s forces were completely destroyed around 15,000, and the total losses in the Rajput side was roughly 20,000, including 3,000 Rathores. \n\n\n\n**BATTLE OF MERTA, 10th of SEPTEMBER, 1790**\n\n\nPatan, was not the end of the struggle between the Rajputs and the Scindia. While the Jaipur army was broken, the army of Jodhpur, the Rathores of Marwar, still was willing and able to put up a fight. Once again, a battle was to be fought and De Boigne and his sepoys gave an excellent account of themselves in this action as well. First, by marching before dawn close to the enemy camp, opening fire and breaking the enemy left and infantry. Next, when the Rathores countercharged at Captain Rohan\'s detachment and pushed them back on acccount of the latter having strayed some distance in excitement from the main Sepoy line, the sepoys reformed and stood their ground.\n\n\n\nSeeing an opening between the weakened detachment of Rohan and Boigne\'s main line, the Rajputs attacked in full force, the mounted levies organised into 7 divisions. They wheeled around De Boigne\'s foot, hoping to find the side and exposed rear of the formations, to ride down the infantry. What De Boigne presented instead was a hollow square. Once again, trained and disciplined artillery and musket fire, tore through Rathore lines. Meanwhile the Rathores, failing to break the infantry, charged straight towards the Deccani horse stationed in the infantry\'s rear. This contingent, broke on first impact under Rajputs pressure, but after being relieved and fighting a grim melee for around 2 hours, they managed to push back the Rathores, who were now spent and routed.\n\n\nBut the Battle would not be over before one final tussle. In the words of Lewis Ferdinand Smith, a British officer of the Campoos :\n\n\n***It is impossible for me to describe the feats of bravery performed by the Zard-Kaprawalas or forlorn hope of the enemy. I have seen, after their line was broken, fifteen or twenty men only return to charge one thousand infantry, and advance within ten or fifteen paces of our line, before they were all shot. It is but just to the enemy to acknowledge that, considering the situation in which they were found, and the disorder consequent thereto, they behaved very valiantly, as they actually cut down some of our people at their guns, and two of them with a desperate fury and intrepidity, made at De Boigne himself and might possibly have killed him if they had not been hewn in pieces by his bodyguards***\n\n\n\n**OBSERVATIONS :**\n\n\n\n***Why did the Indian Sepoy formations ultimately fail?***\n\n\n\nSo far we have noted how well the formations were organised, how they conducted themselves in operations and battles. And yet, ultimately, these sepoys failed against the English such as at the Battle of Assaye 1803. So, one must wonder why? Ofcourse, there are reasons such as the fact that De Boigne had resigned and left for France in 1793. That a duo such as Mahadji and De Boigne was rare and could not be imitated. That Perron, the new commander of Scindias sepoys betrayed his employer. But, when we look at the formations of native states in their entirety, certain fundamental problems present themselves and may answer the question as to why the native princes failed to defeat European forces despite having regular infantry formations trained along European lines. \n\n\n\n* ***Their Campoo batallions could never truly hold their own against a determined European force*** : Reason here being, the inherent problems with such a formation. The archaic elements of Maratha armies in the period, namely their Pindaris and their Silhadars, that is, their irregular cavalry, was supported by loot and plunder, while the Campoo were paid regular salaries, often higher than the irrelguar forces, since they were recruited from foreign lands and were obliged to fight in campaigns in foreign lands. The Campoo were recruited from the upper castes of Oudh and Rohilla Afghans, and had a sense of superiority about them, being the backbone of the new model armies. These two elements were always in a state of friction, and the common saying among the archaic irregular elements of the army was *Paltan barbad zhala*, meaning the Paltan was destroyed, which caused massive panic and rout among the older elements, which knew that without support in terms of infantry and artillery firepower, they could be swept from the battlefield like dust. A bitter lesson they had learned after the defeats in the Carnatic wars and the example of Buxar. Therefore, cohesion among the arms of the army was lacking. Cavskry depended on infantry and relied on the latter to take the strongest enemy positions and wouldn\'t mind if losses in life were suffered by the same. The infantry for its part, while an efficient arm, was doubtful of the abilities of the cavalry, whom they considered outdated and Inferior and capability and bravery. This compared with the professional troops, raised and trained in European fashion, disciplined and employed with better cohesion on the battlefield by professional and career officers and veterans, and the answer as to why native armies ultimately lost to European powers becomes clear. \n\n\n\n* ***The inability of Maratha Princes to modernise :*** The Campoo was the product of latest in military thinking. Of complex organisation, costly equipment and professional soldiers and officers. These required deep pockets. Now, keep in mind, that men like De Boigne when given the same land grants as Indian nobles, were able to finance and support a force of Oudh sepoys (Brahmins and Rajputs) and Rohilla Afghans, that conquered kingdoms across north India. Why? Well, because unlike Indian princes who used their treasury to decorate their halls and spent their time in their harems, De Boigne knew, his fortunes could only be realised by the efficient utilisation of his time and energy. Added to this was the fact that Scindia and Holkar were almost illiterate. They were inefficient in matters of administration. While they did conquer vast territories, they failed to check accounts, to curb corruption, to frequently visit their jagirs and ensure peace and stability which was so necessary for good harvest and a happy peasantry. Despite being rulers of such vast territories, they were not gifted with the same understanding and ingenuity of in the realm of development of administration and institutions as De Boigne and European military adventurers were. De Boigne was given *jagirs* by Scindia, when the former complained that his sepoy\'s salary was constantly in arrears and the latter gave him *jagirs* to administer and pay the salaries of his troops and for his own reimbursement. De Boigne raised the revenues realised from these *jagirs*, by regular inspection, vigilant accounting and strict administration, meaning his peasantry was happy, business and trade boomed, cash crops were cultivated and a higher revenue was realised. As an example - De Boigne settled European indigo planters in Aligarh. At Jalali, one such planter was Thomas Longcroft, who managed a factory. He produced between 3000-5000 *maunds* of finished indigo per season, which in 1830, went at Rs. 200 per *maund*, single handedly raising the revenue of the district by Rs. 10,00,000 if we suppose that indigo went by the same rate in 1793. How much could a Rajput or Maratha *jagirdar* realise as revenue from his district? Not even close. \n\n\n\n* ***The inherent problems of the Campoo Corps :*** The problem with these Campoo Corps was that they were created and officered by Europeans. Usually English and French. These men owed no loyalty to the Prince who employed them, save for the loyalty a mercenary owes to his employer, based on money. Therefore, they would always be unreliable. They would be even more unreliable when facing a European foe. These tendencies of switching sides, of treachery and betrayal, required of man of high calibre and moral standards such as De Boigne, to check them. But men like De Bogne are hard to come by. As was inevitable, such a system failed, as this innovation was not the result of Indian, or native ingenuity, but rather a foreign import. Mostly an ornament, rarely a tool. \n\n\n\n* ***No unified Grand Strategy, No cohesion, poor quality of leaders :*** When we look at the Maratha efforts against the British in the Second and Thrid Anglo Maratha wars, we find a few things to be clear. The quality of the leaders on the two sides was skewed in favour of the British. Lifelong professional soldiers and officers, will almost always beat an army, raised and officered by archaic standards, save for a few instances when a truly "heavenly born general" like Bajirao commands the outgunned forces. Maratha princes, weren\'t clear and upto date on the latest in military thinking and strategy. And above all, they simply didn\'t work together. Infighting among the Scindias, the Holkars and the Peshwas, cost them their sovereignty.\n\n\n\n\nSources :\n\n\n"The Fall of the Mughal Empire Vol IV" by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n"New History of the Marathas Vol III" by GS Sardesai\n\n\n"Persian Records of Maratha History Vol II - Scindia as Regent of Delhi 1787 &amp; 1789-91" by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n\n"Poona Residency Correspondence Vol I and Vol VIII and Vol IX" by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n\nPeople may find this in an answer format by me, over at AskHistorians as well.'<br />Author: 'MaharajadhirajaSawai'  id: 'oimu9v'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/oimu9v/how_effective_were_europeanstyle_infantry_units/</li>

These are then waved clockwise around an elder, saint, Guru, Devta or any other object/entity worthy of respect or reverence to give one\'s respect to the higher authority. This traditional Aarti became the Khalsa\'s method of worship and a way of saluting the Shasters(Weapons) and Gurbani.\n\n\n\n* This form of Aarti was conducted since the time of the Gurus, and slowly began to vanish in Punjab during the Singh Sabha reform movements (1870-1930) while Pseudointellectuals and Khalistanis continue to slander (Nindeya)\n\n\n\n* A contemporary account (now in the possession of Prof. Anurag Singh Ji) documents this with Guru Tegh Bahadur blessing a Sikh who did this Aarti.\n\n&gt; "Up ahead the camp was set up at Baher Jukh, at the house of a Sikh Tarkhan (now part of the Ramgharia caste). He was quite a loving devotee. He built a Takht for the Guru and installed a Chandoa (canopy) over it. **He worshipped the place everyday by offering incense (Dhup) and a Ghee Lamp (Deeva)** and would say to himself, that, "if I leave my house, the robbers will rob me (of this magnificent throne)." He prayed that the Guru will one day come to him and bless him right here at his house. Now, right before him, the Guru was sitting on the throne and the Sikh was overwhelmed with joy." \n(Sakhi 35)\n\n* Another contemporary account\n\n&gt;"Tradition holds that when Aurangzeb, like some of his predecessors, banned the Hindu worship, Guru Gobind Singh Ji, **following the precedent set by Baba Siri Chand, ordered his Sikhs to do the Aarti with lamps and boisterous music so as to show the enemies of Dharma that they would not intimidate the Khalsa and would give heart to the persecuted Hindus.**" \n(Analysis of Puratan Texts indicates that the ceremonial Aarti was present in Sikhism (even before the 10th Guru) but Guru Gobind Singh Ji turned it into an official Sikh practice for his Khalsa (the Third Panth). \n\n\n* Giani Ditt Singh of the Singh Sabha called Nirmalas and Nihangs imposters for Aarti and successfully got it banned in Punjab (1936)\n\n\n&gt;"The ƒÄrati would take place with lanterns at Sri Harmandir Sahib (verse 14)." "Those imposters who wear blue (Nihangs), and the Nirmalas are sinners for doing this (verse 4). They stand infront of the Guru with fire, Oh Saints\' (verse 6).\n\n\n* The Hazuri Sikhs, also known as Deccani Sikhs, maintained practices from the Gurus, noting the reforms and disagreeing, venerating both Guru Granth Sahib and the Dasam Granth to this day.\n\n\n* There was an incident in 2017 where an ignorant Sikh tried to extinguish the flame of the Aarti at Hazur Sahib\n\n\nPlease watch and share it with anyone you might think will benefit.'<br />Author: 'Competitive-Ninja416'  id: 'oiert6'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/oiert6/a_documentary_on_sgpc_interference_in_sikhi/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Taliban invades Kandahar, 52 workers die in Bangladesh, and the resistance of Josip Tito'<br />Body: 'Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Geopolitics Thread, the place where we discuss events from all over the world. News and discussion do not have to be related to India. Please share interesting stories and your thoughts in the comments. Here are a few to get the discussion started: \n\n# Top Stories\n\n1. [Kandahar on brink of collapse](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-enter-kandahar-city/articleshow/84309324.cms)\n\nAfter US President Joe Biden ordered troops to pull out of their main base in Afghanistan, Bagram Air Base, the Taliban has taken over large swathes of the country and is now setting its sights on the cities. Just today, Taliban fighters entered Kandahar, the country\'s second largest city and birthplace of the Taliban. Previously, they had taken control of Badakshan province, which borders China, Tajikistan, and PoK, forcing many government-backed militias and Afghan defense forces to flee to Tajikistan. The US President, under repeated questioning, washed his hands off, declaring that Afghans had both the right and the responsibility to handle their own affairs. China is evacuating its citizens from the country, and India has evacuated some diplomats.\n\n2. [President of Haiti assassinated at home](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/haiti-president-jovenel-moise-assassinated-at-home/articleshow/84201734.cms)\n\nThe President of the Francophone Caribbean country of Haiti, Jovenel Moise, was abruptly assassinated in a shocking attack in the Presidential palace. His wife was gravely injured and flown out to Florida for treatment. Several men, including former Columbian soldiers and two US citizens, have been arrested. Haiti has been under a constitutional crisis for over a year, with Mr. Moise being seen by many as a president whose term already ended. He, however, insists that he had an additional year and refused to hold elections. Haiti is currently under martial law imposed by the Prime Minister, and has requested US and UN troops to stabilize the situation.\n\n3. [G20 approves global tax, but govts have to implement](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/g20-approves-minimum-global-corporate-tax-of-15-7154961.html)\n\nThe G20 finance ministers, currently chaired by Italy, agreed to a 15% global minimum corporate tax to raise further revenue for COVID recovery and dent the pernicious effect of tax havens like Ireland and Mauritius. Under the proposed rules, companies based anywhere in the world would have to pay either local corporate taxes or 15% tax in the country with their largest presence, whichever is higher. Over 130 countries have previously endorsed this proposal, initiated by the US, but the G20\'s approval is significant as it encompasses 80% of the world\'s economy. A final agreement will be reached when the G20 heads of government meet in October. However, national governments will actually have to implement the law in their countries, and it seems unlikely that the US itself will be able to do it due to Republican resistance. \n\n4. [52 die in Bangladesh factory fire](https://indianexpress.com/photos/india-news/bangladesh-dhaka-factory-fire-photos-7397153/)\n\nIn what is becoming a sad but regular affair, a multistoried food and beverage factory on the outskirts of the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka was engulfed in flames, killing at least 52 workers and injuring many more. Local residents told journalists that most of the workers were teenagers, compounding the tragedy for poor families that depended on the extra hands. Industrial accidents leading to deaths are common in Bangladesh, where lax labour regulations may have boosted incomes and the economy, but have left workers with little protection and abysmal working conditions.\n\n5. [New but different COVID-19 wave in UK](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uks-daily-covid-19-cases-pass-32000-for-the-first-time-since-january/articleshow/84234459.cms)\n\nAfter fully vaccinating over two thirds of its population, the UK is seeing a new wave of cases, reporting over 30,000 new daily infections for the first time since January. The new wave has been attributed to the spread of the more contagious Delta variant, which has become the dominant strain in the UK, US, India, and most other countries. However, unlike previous waves, infections among vaccinated individuals has been mild and has not required hospitalization. The UK healthcare system has not been strained by the rise in cases. The UK government is looking to lift all COVID-19 restrictions on July 19 with the hope that the protection of vaccines will allow the novel coronavirus to become largely a non-lethal irritant in people\'s daily lives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The comrade who took on Stalin\n\n*This post is the last of a three-post series on the three \'independent\' Communist Eastern European countries: Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia* \n\nAs far as the Soviet Union was concerned, all Communist countries were part of a big family - specifically, the Soviet family. Having a Communist government was but a pre-requisite, those countries were required to integrate militarily, culturally, and economically with the USSR. The consequences for trying to feign independence, as we have seen in the earlier parts of the series, have been brutal. And yet some dictators did achieve a degree of independence from the USSR, the most successful of them being Josip Tito, former leader of Yugoslavia. \n\nSlavs are an ethno-linguistic group in Eastern Europe spread across dozens of countries, Russia being the largest of them. Despite being part of one group, Slavs are divided into many sub-groups that mostly dislike each other politically. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia (literally "Southern Slavic country") was one such country that actually consisted of several Slavic groups, such as Croats, Serbians, and Slovenes. Formed after independence from the remains of the Ottoman Empire in the south and the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the north in 1918, it was the birthplace of Tito. During WW1, he was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian army, captured by the Russians as a prisoner in the Ural mountains, and even participated in the Russian Revolution that created the USSR. After the war, he became a Communist revolutionary in Yugoslavia, starting with peaceful strikes but graduating to violence. He was arrested and briefly imprisoned, but continued his activities, becoming General Secretary of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY) in 1937.\n\nBut by then, the world was changing. Hitler was breaking up Czechoslovakia, and in response, Tito organized armed militias to help the resistance there, which of course failed. In 1941, the Axis invaded Yugoslavia itself, and the CPY launched the most successful resistance to Nazi occupation in all of Europe, with Tito as the Commander in Chief of the Partisans. Indeed, he was so successful that Churchill himself worked out a deal to have have him installed as the head of a post-war Yugoslavia. In 1945, after the surrender of Nazi Germany, Tito proclaimed the formation of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia under the CPY led by him. The new country had a classic Communist system: secret police, one-party rule, command economy, etc. but unlike all new Communist countries except the USSR, it had a relatively strong military, formed by the victorious Partisans. Within the Eastern bloc, although Tito swore loyalty to Moscow, he was always seen as the second-tallest Communist leader after Stalin.\n\nStalin did not like competition, and he looked upon Tito with a mix of suspicion and hatred. The fact that Tito refused to follow the USSR\'s foreign policy did not help. The Soviet bloc came close to invading Yugoslavia, but instead chose to expel it from the grouping and stop economic aid, hoping that Tito\'s regime would collapse by itself. To be doubly sure, Stalin also ordered many unsuccessful assassination attempts on Tito, always foiled by the Yugoslav secret police. Tito once wrote to Stalin after one such attempt, "Stop sending people to kill me. We\'ve already captured five of them, one of them with a bomb and another with a rifle. \\[...\\] If you don\'t stop sending killers, I\'ll send one to Moscow, and I won\'t have to send a second." Soviet economic sanctions did not work either: the United States quickly began providing aid instead to back up an anti-Soviet ally, even a Communist one. After Stalin\'s death in 1953, the Soviets tried to win back Tito and started providing economic aid again, making Yugoslavia the only Communist country to receive aid from both East and West.\n\nAid, of course, is never free. The expectation from both sides was that Tito would join in either bloc in exchange. But he had other plans. Together with Nehru from India, Naser from Egypt, Nkrumah from Kenya, and Sukarno from Indonesia, Tito co-founded the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in 1961 and refused to join either bloc, becoming the first Secretary-General of NAM instead. He was instrumental in anti-colonial movements around the world, providing weapons to national liberation groups across Asia and Africa, even anti-Communist ones. By 1967, Yugoslavia opened its borders to foreign visitors and also allowed its citizens to travel abroad, neither of which were allowed by other Communist countries. But perhaps Tito\'s greatest achievement was in keeping his own multi-ethnic country together. Using elements of personal popularity, harsh repression by the secret police, and significant devolution of power to states within the federation, Yugoslavia kept a lid on its internal divisions. But he was no democrat: a new constitution adopted in 1974 made him president for life, and there were no elections although power was significantly devolved to states. \n\nTito died in 1980 of a gangrenous infection, his funeral attracting the largest number of foreign dignitaries ever at the time. He was the recipient of 98 foreign awards and decorations from every major country in the First, Second, and Third worlds. However, his death marked an end to relatively better times within Yugoslavia, with economic crises leading to ethnic tensions and harsh repressions by the regime. In 1990, with the collapse of Communism in the Eastern Bloc, the Yugoslav member states failed to negotiate a confederation. Croatia and Slovenia declared independence, and fighting broke out between the remaining members. The Yugoslav Wars, which would last into the new millennium, broke out, with many allegations of war crimes remaining to this day. But even after such fierce fighting, most former Yugoslav republics have at least one city and many streets named after Tito, the only man who had managed to unite them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What stories caught your attention?

      <li>Title::: 'Do you have confidence that the 2021 census on religious demography will be accurate?'<br />Body: "This is a very touchy subject and I have doubts over whether any census, present or past, on religious demography can be accurate. The reason is because there will be a large number of people who pretend to be of one faith in survey, for whatever reason, but practise another. \n\nHaving said that, I think the past censuses have slightly overestimated the Hindu population of the country. Maybe its on purpose because if Hindu population was found to have fallen sharply, Congress may lose elections. This time, there is a chance to find out the closest estimate of Hindu percentage in the country. \n\nWhat's your opinion on this?"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'ohtdbd'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ohtdbd/do_you_have_confidence_that_the_2021_census_on/</li>
      <li>Title::: "The Indian Government and Media's silence post release of the Pentagon UAP report."<br />Body: 'Hello everyone here! So, some backstory here I don\'t know how curious some of you are here about this topic or are even remotely up-to-date with what\'s happening right now. \n\n\\*\\*CONTEXT\\*\\*\n\nI have been following this topic very closely for the past few months after the Pentagon declassified three videos of UFOs entering their restricted airspace. The [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TumprpOwHY) in question show \\*something\\* moving against the wind with no wings, no rotor blades, no heat-signatures, no signs of visible propulsion and made no sound. These objects supposedly dropped from 80,000 feet (which is basically space) to just 50 feet above water in 0.78 seconds and outran an FA-18 Super Hornet squadron that engaged one off the coast of San Diego during the [USS Nimitz](https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/us-government-report-on-ufos-fails-to-determine-extraterrestrial-links-1819598-2021-06-26) encounters in 2004. The pilot described the object to be about 15-20 feet in length about the size of his fighter-jet and was in the shape of a [mint of Tic-Tac](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Mint_Tic_Tacs.jpg/1200px-Mint_Tic_Tacs.jpg), white in color and had no wings, no rotor blades, and performed aerial feats no craft even today can accomplish. You can watch Commander David Fravor describe this incident himself and what he saw [here](https://youtu.be/ZA-h3dIeD_A) (which is what launched this investigation and interest in UAPs) after the "craft" disappeared from his sight the radio operator calls him and tells him that the thing is at his cap-point where the training exercise was to be conducted. The cap-point was over 75 kilometers away. I refuse to believe that any man-made craft can travel 75 kilometers in a couple of seconds except if it\'s in outer-space. And keep in mind, this thing accelerated instantaneously with no sound, no sonic boom and directly contradicts what we know about the law of conservation of momentum. The [report](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Prelimary-Assessment-UAP-20210625.pdf) has about 144 encounters (from 2018-2019) formally reported and investigated and only one had a prosaic explanation which turned out to be a large inflating balloon. About 80 of these reports have corroborative sensor data which is captured on multiple sensors (Definitely a solid object and not malfunction) and by visual contact. And about 18 of these "crafts" showed aerial feats like accelerating to beyond hypersonic velocities instantaneously, making mid air 90 degree turns at hyper velocities without having to slow down and even disappear out of sight. \n\nMost of these objects interrupted training activities, and also \\*\\*SWARMED\\*\\* the navy ship [USS Omaha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyP79v9e84). And some were spotted near nuclear silos, disabling nukes, enabling them and also getting control over them only to do nothing and \\*shoot\\* away back up into the sky. Notice how I say shoot. These things show interest in the military capabilities of Russia, China and the USA and I guarantee you, India too. \n\nThere is a lot I am leaving out here because this post is kind of very spontaneous and if somebody has been up-to-date with the topic can have some answers as to why the Indian government is staying silent about the topic. And the fact that they\'re silent says a #LOT\n\nNow, due to there being visual confirmations of these objects and even on [photos](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/uaptf-1607458179.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&amp;resize=980:*) ([here\'s the original](https://www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2021/04/Acorn.jpeg?w=876)) [a flying sphere from cockpit](https://www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2021/04/Sphere.jpeg?w=876), and what appears to be a [blimp](https://www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2021/04/Metallic-Blinp.jpeg?w=876) but is unidentified as of yet. I am almost certain that our Indian pilots have seen something bizarre flying around in our skies and don\'t talk about it because of the fear of being ridiculed and/or losing career opportunities. I believe that the stigma around the UFO topic needs to go away and it is time that we take these seriously. The fact that the Indian Military has multiple sensors to keep track of the airspaces around them makes it almost a certain fact that they\'ve seen these things and are not coming out with what appears to be (possibly) the biggest cover-up in human existence. Here\'s my two-cents. I hope I get some interesting replies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nUFOs are real, multiple governments around the world are coming forward like France, China, Russia and the US over their existence and they don\'t know what they are. And yet, the Indian government is staying silent despite knowing that these things are out there.'<br />Author: 'swerZZie'  id: 'ohn7ov'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ohn7ov/the_indian_government_and_medias_silence_post/</li>

But still you could see how fear could put you against each , against your own , someone you shared a tea , coffee or meal would be turned into a villian the very next day. So read on\n\n# Birth of Shiva Sena\n\n KK Ganapathy who was one of those few South Indians who had moved from  Palakkad, Kerala in 1953 to live in Bombay. \n\n *‚ÄúThe first time I was attacked, I was afraid and was taken aback by the  strong words of disgust hurled at me by the hooligans, who called  themselves the ‚Äòlocals‚Äô. I was very hurt, but chose to remain silent,‚Äù* \n\n *‚ÄúHowever, when I was stripped in public the second time, I was extremely  angry. When the hooligans abused and mocked me by asking me to ‚ÄòGet  Out!‚Äô I retorted by telling them that they could remove my dhoti but would never be able to take me out of the city‚Äù.* \n\n Several hundreds of South Indian families, who had moved in to Bombay in  search of better lives and livelihoods, were suddenly grappling under  the shadows of their own identities in the 1960s. \n\n* The garments they wore ‚Äì questioned.\n* The vermilion on their forehead ‚Äì mocked.\n* The language they spoke ‚Äì scorned.\n* The money they earned ‚Äì plundered.\n\nThe fear and competition for jobs and housing, telling the some of the locals and creating a fear on how the outsiders from South of India have taken over their business , did create a sense of fear, this was fear that turned into its ideology for Shiva Sena at its inception\n\n Marathi regionalism was its fodder  Bal Keshav Thackeray, a political cartoonist then formally instituted the Shiv Sena on19th June, 1966, it turned the urban employment into a issue which was further turned into hatred against the outsiders , an outsider who had moved to the city and lived there for decades, an outsider who was born in the city, an outsider who might followed the same religion too. Most important thing an outsider who belonged to the same nation.\n\n# Marmic - The Publication\n\nThackeray wanted a medium to show the   legitimate demands of the Marathi-speaking people in Bombay,  Thackeray‚Äôs weekly publication was used as a propaganda tool. Creating  Short, funny censures that appealed to the local population and their struggle.\n\n Between April and September 1967, lists of officers of businesses and  institutions were printed showing Maharashtrians to be in a distinct  minority, only 75 out of 1500 executives, vis-√†-vis South Indians who  occupied 70% jobs  was printed in its publications.\n\n**Attacks soon started**\n\n South Indian hotel in Kala Chowki in central Bombay in February 1967 was attacked  32 persons were injured in the stone-throwing by Shiv Sainiks,  and four Sena activists were arrested.  Thackeray praised the sainiks , no condemnation of violence.\n\nThere were headlines like   ‚Äò*Kaalcha Madrashi, thodyach divsat tupashi*‚Äò  printed,   which meant that the Madrasi, who came recently, has become rich soon.  \n\n**Bombay soon became a city between Locals and Outsiders**\n\n In the mid-1930s, Advocate CD Seshadri‚Äôs father ‚Äì a native of Kerala ‚Äì  moved to Bombay and set up a South Indian restaurant in the midst of a  Maharashtrian-dominated area of south Bombay. The family-run restaurant,  which was popular for its paper dosas and steamed idlis, was swarmed by  huge crowds including many Maharashtrian families, through the week. \n\nSeshadri‚Äôs family-run restaurant also met with a similar fate. The  last nail on the coffin was the fact that the attack was carried out by  vandals, which also included his ‚Äúfriends‚Äù.\n\nThey were informed that the hotel might be attacked, so they had already moved the cash to a safe place.  There was only six rupees in the cashbox, which probably, infuriated the Sainiks further , the cash box thrown on the ground outside. \n\nAnyone wanting to be a Sainik had to take an oath in which the following principles are enshrined:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. *The Marathi people should help each other, and see that the Marathi manoos takes the path to prosperity.* \n2. *Maharashtrians shouldn‚Äôt sell their property to outsiders, and  if any local is found doing so, the nearest shakha should be immediately  informed.* \n3. *As far as possible, Marathi shopkeepers should buy their goods  only from Marathi wholesale traders and treat customers with decorum.* \n4. *Maharashtrians who have their own establishments should only employ sons of the soil.* \n5. *Young Marathi-speaking boys should develop excellent  communication skills in the English language, and learn English typing  as well.* \n6. *Casting away laziness, the Marathi people should form their own  cooperative housing societies, and they should show willingness to go  to any place for a job.* \n7. *Celebrate Marathi festivals and functions with Marathi brothers and sisters by participating eagerly in huge numbers.* \n8. *Locals should involve themselves in the activities of  institutions, schools, ashrams, etc. belonging to Maharashtrians and  donate generously for their cause.* \n9. *Boycott all Udipi hotels and do not buy anything from shops of non-Maharashtrians.* \n10. *Don‚Äôt discourage the Marathi-speaking people involved in business and other professions, and keep them from losing heart;* \n\n*Instead, extend as much help as you can.* \n\n* *Do not behave arrogantly and crudely with your own Marathi  brethren, and in case any of them faces any difficulty, others should  collectively support him.*\n\n \n\nThe Sena thought of all people hailing from South India as one group.  Anyone who spoke in a language that was non-Marathi or had a perceptible  accent was immediately called a *lungi*\\-wallah or a Madrasi, as told by  Chakradhar Gundetty‚Äôs family, which had moved in to Bombay from Nizamabad in Andhra Pradesh in 1945 .\n\n# The 60s, birth of political parties\n\n The mid-sixties saw the rise of many local and regional leaders, and  political outfits. In Tamil Nadu, the DMK came to power, overthrowing  the Congress for good. \n\nIn Punjab, the Akali Dal established its roots.  In West Bengal, the Communists became more influential. The Naxalite  movement too came on the national scene in 1969-70. \n\nIn Bihar and Uttar  Pradesh, new opposition fronts were born in the 1967 elections. Though  the Shiv Sena could not become a regional party in the classical sense,  Thackeray roared just when this mood of rebellion and anarchy had begun  to spread .\n\n \n\nIf you look back to the dissolution of the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti after the  creation of Maharashtra in 1960. The Indian economy  was suffering from a financial slowdown, the unemployment rates including  among the middle-class Maharashtrians was high.\n\n It was for the first  time, Maharashtrians were developing political will, which encouraged  them to find jobs and understand the reasons for their poverty.\n\nThus, when Thackeray shouted from the rooftop, voicing the inner  concerns of the ‚Äòsons of the soil‚Äô and telling them that it was the  South Indians who had stolen their livelihoods, their enemy now had a  well-defined identity: A *lungi*\\-clad Madrasi speaking ‚Äòyandugundu‚Äô.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Struggle**\n\n Fears of being cornered, mocked and beaten up in public, and the trauma  of being called an ‚Äòoutsider‚Äô or ‚Äòthreat‚Äô in your own country was an  ordeal for the South Indians in Bombay at several levels. \n\n Parents refused to send their children to schools, the men usually moved  around in groups, and families settled down in ‚Äòsafe areas‚Äô, which  housed families that spoke the same language, hailed from the same  regions and experienced the same fears. \n\n# Jobs for locals\n\n \n\nIn 1972, Thackeray set up his Sthaniya Lok Adhikar Samitis (local  people‚Äôs rights committees) in banks and government offices, and began  ensuring jobs for Marathi-speaking youth (Punwani 2012). The fear of  violence and his own clout forced the ruling Congress government to  issue a directive to all employers in 1973 that 60% of managerial jobs  and 90% of other lower category jobs in Bombay be given to those  domiciled in Maharashtra for 15 years.

It's only in the best interest of everyone. I hope those students don't get trapped in this scam and this policy ends.\nYou can look forward to our subreddit r/MuvsBusigma for further details if you want to .\n\nEdit : The bond amount is around 15 lakhs and the amount is not given at the start to us. It is what we have to pay from our own pockets which frankly we won't even earn from 4 years in the organisation.\nThe pay structure for our 4 year is \n3 lpa\n5 lpa \n7 lpa\n10 lpa\nAnd this is CTC and not the actual amount we are gonna receive.\nAlso guys thanks a lot for the support if you have suggestions please help us by suggesting on our subreddit r/MuvsBusigma .

Crucially, none of these proposed consonants existed\xa0as consonants\xa0in any modern Indo-European language, and were only attested as alternations in vowel quality/quantity.\n\nIn 1915, Bed≈ôich Hrozn√Ω put forward a fairly convincing case that Hittite belonged in the Indo-European family, though there were still issues to be addressed. Among these was the nature of a consonant transcribed as\xa0·∏´. In 1935, Jerzy Kury≈Çowicz connected this consonant with the resonants proposed by de Saussure some fifty years earlier. Suddenly, we had languages that had consonants exactly where de Saussure had predicted them to be, and not elsewhere.\n\nBesides its implication for the phonological system of PIE, and the history of Hittite, laryngeal theory has tidied up PIE morphology as well. A fairly reliable characteristic of PIE roots is that they are monosyllabic and begin and end in a consonant (e.g. *pek ∑- 'cook' &gt;\xa0bake\xa0Russian\xa0peƒç'\xa0'bake', *g ∑·∏ón- 'woman' &gt;\xa0queen, *mel«µ- 'milk'). However, before the advent of laryngeal theory, some roots weren't reconstructible to this CVC template (simplifying a bit here). With laryngeals in the inventory of PIE, linguists were able to decompose the root *d≈ç- 'give', ending in a vowel, into *deh‚ÇÉ-, and the root *anti 'in front of', beginning in a vowel, into *h‚ÇÇent, on the basis of the\xa0·∏´\xa0in the Anatolian forms.\n\nSo, to recap: Using the comparative method (the standard method of linguistic reconstruction), Ferdinand de Saussure proposed the existence of consonants that had not survived in\xa0any\xa0attested descendants of PIE. *Fifty years later, another linguist identified them in the recently deciphered Anatolian languages.
