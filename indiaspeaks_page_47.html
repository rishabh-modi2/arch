This problem is very very acute coming from left. How acute you say - I\'ve been a subscriber of The Wire until last month. I\'ll leave it to your imagination the kind of paranoia they spread. 3 months down the line, watching how things are today, I really want to do "Jhatka" on few of the extreme fear mongering authors.\n\nRecent events in Kashmir have bought the peril of misinformation to its peak. Well, it worried me enough to put effort in learning the language.\n\n\nThe easy way is to watch 3-4 minute videos on youtube. **Not** feature length movies that are dubbed into your language. Quick feedback and reinforcement loop is necessary. This works extremely well if you watch advertisements in your language dubbed in Hindi or vice-versa. You can begin by understanding 5% of 3-4 minute video, that still is a progress. Initially it\'s an effort. But as you start understanding at least 20-25% of the video, it\'s lot more enjoyable. You\'d be surprised how much vocab you can pick just from context; keep few bookmarks of dictionary at your fingers.\n\nObligatory lungi promotion: Lungis (especaily white ones, vesti or our variety of dhoti) are dope to look at. There is a fucking class. They are suitable for our tropical climate. They should be promoted as official attire, right from schools.

They are arming them and telling them to create trouble at Indian border and its mainland. USA has also been doing this they want to Eliminate Hinduism along with creating religious rift by pushing Christianity and Radical islam in South. Indias biggest weakness is it's secular policy towards religion in our country. Like either we get a frame work which will effectively tackle radicalism in a certain religion or India is deeply screwed. Bangladesh's radical islam following population is also gonna be a big security headache for India. Though the current PM of Bangladesh has a good friendship with India. The local population have become extremely radicalised. Hindus have been wiped out of that country. India  is the last remaining ground in South Asia that is not dominated by muslims and remain a safe space of Hindus but I think even that is coming to an end. In certain future China is gonna be facing nation predominantly ruled by one religion and than their down fall will come. The only way for them to avoid this is to fight it along with India and keep radicalism at bay or that it. PM Modi may have done a lot for India but he knows that if India is to remain in distant future he will either have to get strong with certain religions and their policies/ ideology or India is pretty much screwed.

      <li>Title::: 'TIL: The Kumbh Mela were ancient trade fairs and the EIC killed it'<br />Body: '&gt;British civil servant [Robert Montgomery Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Montgomery_Martin), in his book *The Indian Empire*  (1858), remarked that "it is difficult to convey an adequate idea of  the grandeur and beauty" of the Kumbh Mela at Haridwar. According to  him, the visitors at the fair included people from a large number of  races and regions. Besides priests, soldiers, and religious mendicants,  the fair was attended by a large number of merchants: [horse traders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trading), elephant dealers, grain merchants ([banias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bania_(caste))), confectioners ([halwais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halwai)), cloth merchants and toy sellers. The horse dealers came from as far as [Bukhara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukhara), [Kabul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul), [Turkistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkistan_(city)), [Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabia) and [Persia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persia).  Besides horses and elephants, several other animals were sold at the  fair, including "bears, leopards, tigers, deer of all kinds, monkeys,  Persian greyhounds, beautiful cats, and rare birds". Europeans also sold  their merchandise at the fair. The fair was also attended by the [dancing girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautch), who performed for the rich visitors.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haridwar_Kumbh_Mela#cite_note-RMM_1858-2)\n\nEIC killed it because of a perceived military threat. Also because they wanted to control the trade.\n\n&gt;In 1804, the Marathas ceded the [Saharanpur district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saharanpur_district) (of which Haridwar was a part at that time) to the [East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company). Before the [Company rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_rule_in_India), the Kumbh Mela at Haridwar was managed by the [akharas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhara) (sects) of Hindu ascetics known as the [sadhus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadhu).  The Marathas taxed the vehicles and goods coming to all other melas,  but during the Kumbh Mela, they temporarily transferred all the power to  the akharas.[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haridwar_Kumbh_Mela#cite_note-KP_1990-23)  The Sadhus were both traders and warriors. Besides collecting taxes,  they also carried out policing and judicial duties. The Company  administration severely limited the trader-warrior role of the Sadhus,  who were increasingly reduced to begging.[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haridwar_Kumbh_Mela#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMaclean200857%E2%80%9358-24)\n\nThe next Kumbh Mela is in Haridwar in 2021.

The SC also restricted the timing on firecracker bursting. It summoned that the crackers will be allowed between 8 pm to 10 pm on Diwali.\n3. The court also asked all other states in India to start community celebrations which will especially allow them to come together and burn crackers. This was suggested as a means to reduce the pollution levels from firecrackers.\n4. In accordance with Article 21 which talks about the right to life, the SC mentioned that while banning firecrackers was essential, it should not, however, spoil the livelihood of firecracker sellers. \n5. The court also accepted the pleas of the firecracker sellers who argued that the pollution rise was not just because of the burning of firecrackers but other factors such as vehicular exhume and factories emitting smoke. \n6. The SC also cited that this temporary ban was to closely monitor the AQI levels before, on and after Diwali. In an aim to judge and analyse the amount of pollution firecrackers caused during Diwali. \n7. The SC also suggested that several cities in the North face poor visibility during the winter because of the fall in temperature and the wind. Therefore, pollutants from firecrackers alone cannot be singled out and held responsible for the poor air quality around this season of the year. \n\n**What has changed this Diwali?**\n\nThough the SC allowed the sale of green firecrackers last year and banned the rest, it was too late to bring it to effect last Diwali. Old stock firecrackers were still sold and bought by the people. Leaving no room for improvement in the pollution levels last year. On the contrary, this year, with the guidelines of the Indian Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the green crackers were made and produced. The police joined forces and have distributed green cracker licenses to firecracker sellers. These crackers are said to reduce pollution by 30%. Otherwise deemed as the environment-friendly, this announcement was made by the Union and Family-Welfare Minister Mr Harsh Vardhan. \n\nTo know more about legal news and updates visit: [https://vakilsearch.com](https://vakilsearch.com/)'<br />Author: 'NagarajaHarish'  id: 'dj2yaa'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dj2yaa/nuances_of_the_firecracker_ban_during_diwali/</li>

The move has scared away some global customers, but with few alternative suppliers of heavy oil, Indian refiner Reliance Industries Ltd ([RELI.NS](https://in.reuters.com/companies/RELI.NS)) has been buying Venezuelan crude from Russian major Rosneft ([ROSN.MM](https://in.reuters.com/companies/ROSN.MM)). The company is set to resume direct oil loadings in the South American nation after a four-month pause.\n\nSitharaman said the Indian government has expressed its view to the United States.\n\n“In specific issues which are critical for India’s strategic interests, we have explained to the United States that India is a strategic partner for the United States of America and you want a strategic partner to be strong and not weakened,” she said.\n\n“We value the strong partnership with the USA, but we should equally be allowed to be a strong economy.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe International Monetary Fund earlier on Tuesday lowered its outlook for Indian growth in 2019, citing weaker-than-expected domestic demand. The U.S.-China trade war will cut 2019 global growth to its slowest pace since the 2008/09 financial crisis, the IMF said.\n\nIndia’s gross domestic product grew at its weakest pace since 2013 between April and June, stoking expectations of further stimulus.\n\n“Global headwinds ... are getting stronger by the day,” Sitharaman said. Asked about further fiscal stimulus, she said: “I have not closed the door” on that.\n\nNew Delhi has been trying to boost domestic growth through an infrastructure package and a new loan programme organised with the banking sector that has doled out loans worth over 80,000 crore (8.7 billion pounds), she said.\n\nThe finance minister defended the government’s controversial actions in Jammu and Kashmir in August. India stripped the Muslim-majority portion of the state, which is claimed by both India and Pakistan, of autonomy on Aug. 5. Since then the government has shut off phone networks, imposed curfew-like restrictions in some areas, and arrested thousands, including hundreds of local politicians.'<br />Author: 'anuj_kgn'  id: 'diniah'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/diniah/india_cannot_sacrifice_economic_strength_to/</li>

Shopkeepers won’t have to take loss on already purchased plastic bags and it will be permanent. Plastic bag manufacturers are finite in contrast to shops. And they are more equipped than shopkeepers to adjust the losses elsewhere.

He denies that any of the co-accused had helped him in any manner in procuring the pistol (and ammunition) with which he murdered MKG. \n\nHe states that the teachings of MKG would ultimately lead to the emasculation and weakening of the Hindu community, and render it incapable of defending itself from aggressive Muslims; that MKG had a clear bias towards the Muslims while preaching ‘Ahimsa’, which he and Apte were not opposed to, which nevertheless proved detrimental towards the interests of the Hindu community. \n\nIn the newspapers operated by him, ‘Agrani’ and ‘Hindu Rashtra’, he’d always criticised MKG’s views, especially the ploy of fasting for achieving a desired goal. That he and Apte had made peaceful demonstrations against such moves of MKG at Panchagani, Poona, Bombay, and Delhi. On 13th Jan, 1948, MKG undertook a fresh fast unto death seeking unity of Hindus and Muslims in India, but the real intent, he says, was to compel the government to pay Rs 55 crores to Pakistan, which was had been refused. Apte suggested a peaceful demonstration against it at Delhi to which he reluctantly agreed, knowing that it would be futile. In Delhi he witnessed the plight of the refugees who’d fled Pakistan and was moved deeply towards radical intent, and it was there from a refugee that he bought the pistol he used in the murder. \n\nBorn in a religious Hindu family he came to revere the faith to the utmost. He’d worked actively to rid the religion of the ills that plagued it namely untouchability and superstitions. He publicly joined anti-caste movements and maintained that all Hindus should be treated with equality, irrespective of caste and profession. For that he used to take part in anti-caste dinners in which thousands of Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Chamars, and Bhangis, dined together to break caste rules. \n\nHindus constituted a fifth of the human race (then), he believed that working for the upliftment Hindus was his life goal. He’d read the works of Naoroji, Vivekanand, Gokhole, Tilak, and ancient and modern Indian history, along with history of Britain, France, America, and Russia, not to mention works on Socialism and Communism. He believed that the Savarkar and MKG had contributed most to the “thought and action” of India than any other single force. He emphatically denies that Savarkar had given him the green signal for the murder. On the contrary, he stated that Savarkar due to his ill health was no longer capable of leading the Hindu cause with force and vigour; that the Hindu Mahasabha, of which Savarkar was President, once a force to reckon under his leadership, had turned into a “hand-maid” to the Congress. Determined to check the growth of the Congress (led by the MKG group) and the Muslim League, both of which per him were detrimental to the Hindu Sanghatanist cause, he tried to organise a fighting force of the youth. Once a member of the RSS, he joined the Hindu Mahasabha, but after such events where Savarkar was more vocal and supportive of the Congress’ policies post partition, he and Apte decided to ditch Savarkar once and for all and decided to consult him no more on matters important to the Hindu cause. In his paper Agrani, he became more and more critical of Savarkar and other senior Hindu leaders. \n\nHe gives examples where MKG’s duplicity was evident, in that he called Shaheed Hussain Suhrawardy Shaheed Saheb in his evening prayers after the events of Naokhali (1946) where rape, murder, and arson were carried out against the Hindus by Muslims (under the directions of Suhrawardy). Not only that, after coming to Delhi, MKG would hold prayer meetings in a temple and persisted on reading out passages from the Qoran, despite opposition from Hindus. But, he dared not on insisting Geeta read out in a mosque out of fear of a terrible Muslim reaction. NG and Apte, taking together large numbers of refugees, condemned MKG and Suhrawardy by organising demonstrations to disrupt such prayer meetings. MKG would hide behind barricaded doors fearing for life, even when, per NG, force was not used in the least. He distanced himself from Savarkar even more when the latter denounced him for organising such demonstrations, instead of appreciating him. Savarkar also wanted to, and did, celebrate the day of partition when there was mass bloodshed in the Punjab against the Hindus, much to the chagrin of the NG group.'<br />Author: 'ProfessorSW'  id: 'dhncx0'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dhncx0/tldr_of_may_it_please_your_honour_part_2n/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Biweekly Science Thread [Chapter 2]'<br />Body: '# Fermat\'s Last theorem\n\nIn number theory, **Fermat\'s Last Theorem** states that no three  positive integers *a*, *b*, and *c* satisfy the equation *a\\*\\***^(n)* \\+ *b\\*\\***^(n)* = *c\\*\\***^(n)* for any integer value of *n* greater than 2. The cases *n* = 1 and *n* = 2 have been known since antiquity to have an infinite number of solutions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPierre Di Fermat loved to tease contemporary mathematicians and was notorious for often giving a theorem while hiding the proof and asking them to either prove or disprove it. He had great insight in mathematics, this particular last theorem he wrote down in 1637 in the margin of a copy of book arithmatica ( a 3rd century greek book on mathematics), Fermat added that he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin. Later when he died the copy of his book arithmatica was made public by his son. Although he claimed to have a general proof  of his conjecture, Fermat left no details of his proof, and no proof by  him has ever been found. His claim was discovered some 30\xa0years later,  after his death. This claim, which came to be known as *Fermat\'s Last Theorem*, stood unsolved for the next three and a half centuries, It led to mathematicians trying to prove this very simple theorem. While no formal proof could be discovered, mathematicians were unable to find counter example of it either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe unsolved problem stimulated the development of algebraic number theory in the 19th century and the proof of the modularity theorem in the 20th century. It is among the most notable theorems in the history of mathematics and prior to its proof was in the *Guinness Book of World Records* as the "most difficult mathematical problem" in part because the theorem has the largest number of unsuccessful proofs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe special case *n* = 4, proved by Fermat himself, is sufficient to establish that if the theorem is false for some exponent *n* that is not a prime number, it must also be false for some smaller *n*, so only prime values of *n* need further investigation. Over the next two centuries (1637–1839), the conjecture was proved for only the primes 3, 5, and 7, although Sophie Germain innovated and proved an approach that was relevant to an entire class of primes. In the mid-19th century, Ernst Kummer extended this and proved the theorem for all regular primes,  leaving irregular primes to be analyzed individually. Building on  Kummer\'s work and using sophisticated computer studies, other  mathematicians were able to extend the proof to cover all prime  exponents up to four million, but a proof for all exponents was  inaccessible (meaning that mathematicians generally considered a proof  impossible, exceedingly difficult, or unachievable with current  knowledge). In order to keep this article short and accessible to everyone I will skip over several mathematicians who contributed to the development of proof for this theorem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter 358 years of effort by mathematicians, the first successful proof was released in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, and formally published in 1995. It also proved much of the modularity theorem and opened up entire new approaches to numerous other problems and mathematically powerful modularity lifting techniques. I will leave the story of andrew wiles who almost isolated himself for decade to solve this problem or the story of Sophie Germain who had to hide herself because she was a woman and not supposed to do mathematics for future posts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever the question remains did Pierre Di Fermat really possessed a proof so simple which didn\'t require mathematics developed over next 350 years? Was he bluffing?  Is it that his proof had some flaw and accidentally the theorem was true? or is it that mathematicians over roughly 400 years now have been unable to figure out what he knew.'<br />Author: 'sharma_ji_ki_betii'  id: 'dgwmxe'<br />Score:32<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dgwmxe/biweekly_science_thread_chapter_2/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'In the most RETARDED move ever, the govt is now planning to force Companies to monitor whether the suppliers are uploading their GST returns on regular basis!!!'<br />Body: '&gt; “As per the amended CGST Rules (likely to become effective in days to come), input tax credit to be availed by a registered person, the details of which have not been uploaded by the suppliers, shall not exceed 20 per cent of the eligible credit available in respect of invoices or debit notes uploaded by the suppliers. **This means going forward, it will be mandatory for the buyers to match the ITC claimed with the details uploaded by the vendors**,” says Pritam Mahure, chartered accountant .\n\n&gt; For example, say in the month of April, the input tax credit available (as per books) is Rs 1,500. Out of this, certain vendors wherein input tax credit involved is say Rs 500 have not filed their\xa0GSTR-1. Now, due to amendment, the buyer can avail ITC only to the extent of Rs 1,200 (i.e. 120% of R 1,000) and not 1,500.\n\n&gt; “This restriction will actually mean that the Companies need to monitor whether the suppliers are uploading their returns on regular basis. Most Companies are likely to feel the pinch of the amendment (once it becomes effective),” says Mahure.\n\n&gt; **“The amendment has introduced another set of compliance on a monthly basis** i.e. check GSTR 2A if the credit claimed doesn’t exceed GSTR 2A by 20% and also determine the credit which are ‘eligible’ out of the GSTR 2A before applying this 20% rule,” says PwC, Partner, Priyajit Ghosh.\n\n#Ease of doing business my Ass.\n\n&gt; Singh echoes similar views when he states that this Notification now necessitates regular monthly reconciliation of input tax credit with vendor reporting.

Needless to say, many went out of business. \n\n&gt; Remember that the govt *allows quarterly filing* of GSTR-1. This means that we can\'t claim Credit until the quarterly GSTR-1 is filed by the counter party, even though goods has been paid for, delivered and transaction is complete. \n\n&gt; Now the impact of this move is devastating To the quarterly filers of course. Because even though they may be regular filers, the other party can\'t take credit. The cash flow implications for everyone in the chain will be -ve, except for the govt. **That is the whole intent here.**\n\n&gt; If everyone\'s cash flow is impacted on a turbulent economy across the entire supply chain, what really will happen to the GDP and the taxes? Would it not contract? Can someone please tell this to any economist in the govt?\n\n&gt; Oh, I forgot. There is none there. It is just Pandey-ji running revenue department just like how he ran #Aadhaar. Make up the rules as things move -ve. I am mind blown about how much of a destruction GST is to businesses are.

      <li>Title::: 'Hinduism and Evolution'<br />Body: 'The Sāṅkhya system describes evolution at cosmic and individual levels. It views reality as being constituted of puruṣa, which is consciousness that is all-pervasive, motionless, unchangeable, without desire who at the individual level is the sākṣin(साक्षी), the witness, and prakṛti (प्रकृति), which is the phenomenal world. Prakṛti is composed of three different strands (guṇas (गुण) or characteristics) of sattva (सत्व), rajas (रजस), and tamas(तमस), which are transparency, activity, and inactivity, respectively. \n\n\n\nEvolution begins by puruṣa and prakṛti creating mahat (Nature in its dynamic aspect, as energy). From mahat evolves buddhi (intelligence) and manas (mind). From buddhi come individualized ego consciousness (ahaṅkāra) and the five tanmātras (subtle elements) of sound, touch, sight, taste, smell. From the manas evolve the five senses (hearing, touching, seeing, tasting, smelling), the five organs of action (with which to speak, grasp, move, procreate, evacuate), and the five gross elements (ether, air, fire, water, earth). \n\n\n\nThe evolution in Sāṅkhya is an ecological process determined completely by Nature. It differs from modern evolution theory in that it presupposes a cosmic intelligence and further beyond a universal consciousness. In reality, modern evolution also assigns intelligence to Nature in its drive to select certain forms over others as well as in the evolution of intelligence itself.\n\n\n\nSource: "Matter and Mind: The Vaiśeṣika Sūtra of Kaṇāda" by Subhash Kak'<br />Author: 'ZackPhrut'  id: 'dgg95f'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dgg95f/hinduism_and_evolution/</li>

LGBTQ issues are insignificant right now. Since sexual acts between people of the same gender have been decriminalised, right now LGBTQ people don\'t need any other "rights". There are more important issues like Poverty and Pollution, and India can\'t worry about LGBT rights.\n2. The LGBTQ community should stop parading their sexuality/identity in public, because no one is interested in knowing about LGBTQ issues. LGBTQ people can do whatever they want in their bedrooms.\n3. After 70 years or so when India will finally have equal rights for LGBTQ people, Hindu conservatives would be the last group to oppose them; because unlike Muslim and Christian fundamentalists their stance on LGBTQ issues isn\'t based on religion.\n4. Indian conservatives are neutral on LGBTQ rights because most LGBTQ people are liberal or left-leaning (which in turn is partly because there was no support for the LGBTQ movement from the Right).\n5. LGBT is acceptable to some degree but non-binary, gender fluid, etc are mental disorders/delusions of Western people; and their psychologists who say that there are more than two genders are wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope I haven\'t missed anything. Do comment if you think anything more needs to be added.\n\nAnd lastly, thank you for taking time to comment on my posts. It really helped me understand what the other side thinks.\n\nSince this post sums up the topic "What the Indian Right Wing thinks about LGBTQ issues", I won\'t be annoying you with similar posts anymore. 😅\n\nThank you for your cooperation.'<br />Author: '_Yuyutsu_'  id: 'dg14yf'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dg14yf/my_observations_as_someone_who_is_prolgbtq/</li>

We started from a very weak and poor country 70 years ago. But during the last few decades, economy has been booming and hundreds of millions of people are lifted out of poverty, which the world has never seen. \n\n&gt; There is a hidden social contract between CCP and Chinese people that is CCP promising a bright and prosperous future and asking people to give up a small portion of their rights and leave the politics and country building to the party. And it's have been working pretty well and majority people put economic freedom in a higher priority over political rights. Because essentially poverty is the one of worst human rights violation. I personally grew up in a very poor family and have chance of getting cheap public education and then a scholarship to come to America for graduate school.\n\n&gt;There is certainly tighter control under Xi but it's very misleading to extrapolate China to impose our system onto the world.

Once American currency replaced animal skins as a way to pay for goods, the term "buck" remained as a slang term for one dollar.\n\n\nValue a buck equalled to $1 so they used the word even after introduction of currency.

I realized it much later when I started to read about more and more such propaganda and fictionalized stories.\n\nThis 2 movies are "**Mr. And Mrs. Iyer**" and "**Matrubhoomi**"\n\nMr. And Mrs. Iyer\'s whole story revolves around Kashmir and Hindu-Muslim riot in the region. Its shows Hindus in a bad light and Muslims as victims and a married Hindu wife falling for a Muslim man based on writers whims and imagination. In one scene a Hindu mob is shown barging into a bus and starts stripping boys pants to check whether they are circumcised or not. Than one Hindu snitches out an old Muslim man in the bus. This movie\'s pure agenda to guilt trap Hindus. One can clearly see how blatant anti-Hindu this movie is. \n\n"Matrubhoomi" movie is another such propaganda movie which shows blatant anti-Hindu propaganda under the garb of highlighting female infanticide issue in a fictionalized world. It starts in some future world(2050AD) where female population is at absolute low compared to male population. Its shows a Hindu brahmin priest involved in bestiality practices and whole movie\'s scenario follows on similar disgusting fictionalized story line. Showing Hindu-Culture in the most negative way possible. Its like the writer\'s utmost hate towards Hindus has made him vomit his inside filth on paper. It shows a woman gets married off in a family of 5 brothers and 1 windowed father. After some time they all take que to rape the woman and than even father also joins them later on. Everything is shown with blatant anti-Hindu agenda as central theme.\n\nMost of youngsters don\'t understand the real hidden meaning behind such movies.

By the end of the second day, when the value of the haul had risen to over Rs 1.6 crore they realised that they were participating in one of the most successful raids in the history of the department.\n\n&gt;*Even counting the haul has been a daunting task. The local branch of the* ***Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has had to pitch in to help.*** *Says Sayed Raza Zaidi, 50, the chief manager of the RBI: "****A special room was set aside and 45 people including some officers were deputed to count the cash and even then it took 18 hours."*** *The RBI had to lend their cash vans along with armed gunmen to transport the haul.*\n\nMore than **90 men had gathered for the raid.** As there were not enough officers to handle the job some upper division clerks were also drafted to help out and 200 policemen had been called in to assist in case the income tax men met with any resistance. As it turned out, they were not needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;By 8 a.m. the raid had begun. Simultaneously other groups were raiding houses belonging to members of Inder Singh\'s family in Tilak Nagar, Arya Nagar and Lajpat Nagar, the most exclusive colonies in Kanpur. At the same time all the factories of Singh Engineering Works Pvt Ltd situated in Fazal Ganj and Panki, were sealed and 15 bank lockers in different names in Kanpur, Delhi and Mussoorie were opened.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Each of the houses and the bank lockers turned out to be veritable Ali Baba\'s caves bulging with riches. By the end of the first day the tally from the raids in Kanpur was a staggering Rs 92 lakh in cash alone. Besides this the haul also included two gold bars of 250 tolas worth about Rs 11 lakh, two other gold bars worth Rs 9.12 lakh, jewellery worth Rs 7.54 lakh, 144 guineas worth Rs 1.85 lakh. Fixed deposits worth Rs 7.04 lakh were also recovered.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the lockers in Delhi search parties discovered Rs 72,000 in cash and fixed deposit receipts worth about Rs 1.10 lakh. In all a collection of Rs 1.3 crore. As it turned out there was still more to come. In the next two days, six gold bars of 250 tolas worth Rs 30 lakh were recovered from two lockers in Kanpur. And the search is not over yet.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He adds that notices have been served on Inder Singh, his wife Mohinder Kaur, 45, his four sons and two sons-in-law and a dozen other members of the family. All the lockers at the Punjab National Bank branch in Swaroop Nagar, Allahabad Bank (Swaroop Nagar) and Hindustan Commercial Bank (Arya Nagar) have been sealed and the owners of the lockers, mostly members of the Inder Singh family, have been asked to go to the bank on different days for a search.\n\nThe cash seized amounted close to 2 Crores and other gold assets a few more, maybe the total was around 3 crores in cash and other assets. What was 2-3 crores in 1981 , how much would that be in today\'s money ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Reasons for the Raids** \n\nThe subject of intense speculation in Kanpur. According to leading industrialists who do not wish to be quoted, a family feud had led to a tip-off to the Income Tax Department. Other rumours hint at a political reason for the raids.\n\nInder Singh\'s wife is the sister-in-law of Suresh Ram, son of the former Union minister Jagjivan Ram and it is hinted that this connection is the real reason for the problems of the Singh family. But income tax officers remain tightlipped about such matters.

      <li>Title::: 'A bust of privatisation looks imminent in India'<br />Body: '##A burst of privatisation looks imminent in India\nNarendra Modi, the incrementalist prime minister, may be turning into a radical reformer\n\nby\xa0Swaminathan Aiyar\n\nIs Narendra Modi the incrementalist suddenly becoming Modi the radical reformer? In his first term as Indian prime minister, from 2014-2019, Mr Modi made a number of small changes but avoided sweeping liberalisation of the economy. The first budget of his second term, presented in July, promised more of the same.\n\nThat approach is suddenly changing. Last month the government\xa0slashed the corporate tax rate\xa0from 30 per cent to 22 per cent (plus surcharges), and to 15 per cent for greenfield investments in manufacturing made by April 2023. India is at last competitive with its Asian rivals; companies exiting China have mostly moved factories to Vietnam and\xa0Bangladesh\xa0but can now consider India.\n\nNext, some of India’s biggest and best public sector companies are about to be privatised. In his first term, Mr Modi privatised nothing. He sold minority stakes in many public companies to raise revenue, but kept management control. A halfhearted\xa0attempt to privatise Air India\xa0last year attracted no bids because of onerous sale conditions. That fiasco put privatisation on the back burner.\n\nToday, a burst of privatisation looks imminent. Last week, a committee\xa0cleared the sale of government stakes\xa0in five companies. The matter will now go to a cabinet committee that is expected to clear it quickly, so that sales can be completed by the end of this fiscal year in March 2020. The star on the auction block, Bharat Petroleum, is India’s sixth largest company by sales. The Container Corporation of India is a major logistics company specialising in moving railway containers. The Shipping Corporation of India is the country’s biggest. The other two candidates are smaller and will probably be bought by larger public companies and don’t constitute genuine privatisation. But the first three companies are highly profitable and respected.\n\nMeanwhile, Air India is to be put up for sale again, this time without the restrictions. The government may also take over part of the airline’s huge debt to make the sale attractive.\n\nWhy has Mr Modi’s approach changed? His\xa0sweeping election victory\xa0in May has given him the political capital to take risks and the opposition is demoralised and divided. His victory has also helped to silence opponents of privatisation within his own party, notably the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh trade union, and the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch, an industrial-policy affiliate that hates Indian companies being sold to foreigners.\n\nIn his first term, Mr Modi could easily have been outvoted in the upper house, which is indirectly elected by state legislatures. But having won many state elections in the past five years, his Bharatiya Janata party is now not far from a majority there. He has won additional political capital through his\xa0takeover of Kashmir, supported by regional parties who gave him a two-thirds majority even in the upper house.\n\nMr Modi is reducing the government’s domination of the economy in other ways. He has auctioned the operation of\xa0six major airports\xa0and, despite trade union protests, auctions are planned for 20 to 25 more. Rail passenger services have long been a government monopoly, but tenders are being\xa0prepared for 150 routes\xa0to be auctioned to private parties. The hope is to attract big operators from across the world.\n\nThis will supplement the government’s “asset recycling”. Since last year, it has been auctioning rights to operate, maintain and share toll revenue from existing infrastructure — roads, ports, power stations and transmission lines. Cash from old infrastructure is recycled into new. Last March, a sale of 680km of roads fetched Rs97bn.\n\nAnother reason for Mr Modi’s new radicalism is fiscal stress. To win elections he was forced to match the freebies promised by opposition parties. India has at least one state election every few months so the pressure to offer giveaways never diminishes. Mr Modi promised a\xa0grant of RS6,000\xa0per small farmer before May’s election and has\xa0now extended it\xa0to all farmers. He also has ambitious but costly plans to provide healthcare for all.\n\nOnly creative accounting can hide the fact that the current year’s\xa0fiscal deficit\xa0will probably be more than 4 per cent of gross domestic product against the budgeted 3.3 per cent. The slowdown has badly dented tax revenue. Mr Modi is keen on fiscal prudence and his various forms of privatisation can help, apart from improving long-term efficiency.\n\nIndia still needs reforms to bring down the cost of land, labour, capital, electricity and freight rates to the levels of its Asian rivals. The old Mr Modi was incapable of such radicalism. Might the new version have a stab at it?\n\nThe writer is a Research Fellow at the Cato Institute'<br />Author: 'indra_sword_rises'  id: 'df0hc4'<br />Score:29<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/df0hc4/a_bust_of_privatisation_looks_imminent_in_india/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Am I in the wrong for refusing to reveal a girl's medical diagnosis even after legal involvement?"<br />Body: 'Background: I am a doctor working at a primary health clinic. Usually I get around 30-40 patients a day. So, a 20 year old girl comes in with her mother and the mother starts complaining of lower back ache and body aches and decreased appetite in the girl. Whenever such a thing happens, I usually sort of keep those "presenting complaints" in the back of my head, and try to get a fresh history from the patient involved. So I was asking routine questions and then asked her about her cycles. The mother interrupted saying that there was no issue with her cycles and that her main complaints was the low back ache and wanted an ultrasound [Here, ultrasounds are treated as the magic cure all for all illnesses]. Here, I got irritated and asked the mother to wait outside. She did so after great reluctance. So I asked the girl again, and she said she was amenorrheic for 4 months. I asked her about sexual contact (consensual or otherwise) , which she blatantly refused. So, I sent her for a urine pregnancy test, without telling her the purpose of the test. And it came out positive. So, armed with the test report, I asked her her again, and she broke down immediately, saying that there was this boy who she had intercourse with, but it was consensual. She begged me not to tell her mother and wanted an abortion. I performed an ultrasound, and found that it wouldn\'t not be safe for the girl to terminate her pregnancy (if she wanted to. Not that I was going to) as she had already crossed 20 weeks. This information also I relayed to the girl. After some time she settled down, and I asked for a hand written letter stating her acknowledgement of the diagnosis and that she wished to keep the information private.\n\nSo, then armed with the USG report and the Pregnancy Test, she goes outside. After an hour or so, the mother barges in screaming at me, while I was seeing another patient. I asked her to wait outside. When I saw her after finishing up, she demanded that I tell her the diagnosis. Which, in view of patient confidentially and the written request, I refused. I told her that as an adult , I could not reveal the diagnosis without the girl\'s written consent. And that the girl would tell her if she was comfortable. The mother got upset and started screaming at me that she was the one who paid for the investigation and she had every right to know the results. Next thing I know is that I have been served a legal notice requesting that I send the file to a court of law. Now, there is no case going on. That much even I found out. It\'s just that the mother wants to know the girl\'s diagnosis, and apparently the girl has not told her family. I gave a written explanation to the lawyer, withholding the diagnosis of course, and have gotten a lawyer to represent me in case things go south. This is a community hospital, and word of my refusal has spread. The people around don\'t know the whole thing and I have people approach me telling me do do the "right" thing and tell the mother.

      <li>Title::: 'The current State of RBIs monetary policy and borrowings by commercial entities'<br />Body: "Copied verbatim from this thread\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kaul_vivek/status/1181067584377982976?s=19\n\n* This is a table out of the Monetary Policy Report released by the RBI last week. \nIt makes for a very interesting reading. A small thread on this. \nFirst and foremost, the non-food credit of banks has collapsed. \n\n* What is non-food credit? Banks lend a lot of money to the Food Corporation of India and other state procurement agencies to help them buy rice, wheat, pulses and oil seeds, directly from farmers. \nOnce this credit is subtracted, what remains is non-food credit.\n\n* Non-food credit comprises of lending to industry, services, agriculture and retail (or what RBI calls personal loans). \nDuring the period, April to mid Sep 2019, it has collapsed. **What the table shows is that the non-food credit between April and Sep contracted by Rs 93,688 crore**\n\n* In simple English it means that banks on the whole, did not lend any fresh money during the period April to Sep. In fact, the total outstanding loans of banks came down. \nThis despite the RBI cutting the repo rate by 110 basis points, between January and September.\n\n* Take a look at the following chart. It plots the weighted average lending rate on outstanding loans of banks. It has gone up between December 2018 and August 2019. Tells you how ineffective the monetary policy is. https://t.co/l9b08GhQrx\n\n* Why is this the case? The deposit rates have barely moved since the beginning of this year. They have moved in a band between 6.85% and 6.9%. That being the case, there is no chance of lending rates coming down, in fact, they have gone up, marginally. https://t.co/4S7kmDDkdn\n\n* Why are deposit rates not falling? \nThe answer is simple. The govt is borrowing more in an environment where savings have been falling, leaving lesser for the private sector to borrow and interest rates remaining where they were. \nThe graph shows the same. https://t.co/aIkEqZPw1G\n\n* The larger point here being that an expansionary fiscal policy and an easy monetary policy cannot be executed at the same time. \nThis means the RBI can keep cutting the repo rate, unless government borrowing falls or savings go up, interest rates are not going to fall.\n\n* The flow of money from non-banks has more than halved. This is primarily because of the crisis in the NBFC sector and banks not lending money to NBFCs.\n\n* The foreigners seem to have saved the day, with the incoming FDI going up majorly in dollar terms. Also, the external commercial borrowings have gone up, which tells us that companies (at least the ones which still want to borrow) are doing it abroad.\n\n* Also, I think the FDI number doesn't adjust for the money that foreigners are taking out of India. (This is what it seems like if I look at the breakdown of the FDI data).\n\n* Long story short, **this is a crisis of confidence. There has been a fall in the confidence in the economic future both at an individual level and the corporate level. The numbers just reflect the same.**\n\nSummary of the analysis. \n- RBI total repo cut by 110 bp so far.\n- lending rate dint come down.\n- Govt increased borrowing from banks.\n- Since deposit in bank didnt increase, there is less or no money to lend to private industries.\n\nMoral of the story - RBI is useless."<br />Author: 'panditji_reloaded'  id: 'deg7yb'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/deg7yb/the_current_state_of_rbis_monetary_policy_and/</li>

The real victim's reputation would be destroyed if a FIR was filed against him and he would be put behind bars for a crime he didn't do.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court says that a false case is because of 'human error'. So ? What kind of fucked up logic is that ?! By that logic, a murder is due to a 'human error'. Theft is due to 'human error'. Rape is due to 'human error'.\n\n\n\nNow, the Act can be misused EASILY since there is no PRE-INVESTIGATION ! These guys can literally do anything they want now ! You can see the guy sitting in an office doing NOTHING but still receiving salary since no one can kick him out since he would file a FIR against the employer on the basis of 'discrimination'.\n\n\n\n\nThis isn't the solution. Something else must be done. \n\n\n\nInvest heavily in education ( our system is TRASH ). Education will bring down caste barriers. By investing heavily, government schools can get a higher number of students, quality and number of teachers would rise and therefore, quality will also rise.\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation can help promote the values to be followed, like if you want money, then work for it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you disagree with me regarding my above point, remember MNREGA. MOST STUPID IDEA EVER ! Giving work to a villager or else giving him Rs.100 every day. It discourages people from working.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why would someone want to work if they are going to get money anyways ? The same applies for this Act. Why would an SC/ST work if he is going to be paid anyways ? If he doesn't, he can just file a FIR and get away with it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSay what you want but it's this thing and reservations which are holding this country back.

A few are quoted below:\n\n&gt;of graver import is an interview by **Jawhar Sircar** to Newsclick on the 23rd of last month. Mr. Sarkar, who has served as Secretary, Culture and the Chairman of Prasar Bharti till he hung up his well worn boots in 2016, is among the *very few articulate* and *erudite* retired officers from this service who have the courage to speak up, and is well worth listening to.\n\nJawhar Sircar, the former director of Prasar Bharti was a classic self-hating Indian appointed by the Congress government essentially to subvert Indian culture. How can I tell? \n\n[Him spreading Fake News](https://www.opindia.com/2019/09/shashi-tharoor-fake-news-jawaharlal-nehru-in-ussr-moscow-as-usa-picture-downplay-howdy-modi-success/) (remember, he used to run DD).\n\nAs for "articulate" and "erudite", just take a glance through his twitter timeline. Those words are just synonyms for anti-BJP nowadays.\n\nBack to the blog:\n\n\n &gt;The IAS is no longer the service it was even twenty years ago. It has been hollowed out from within by the wrong kind of inductees- the KOTA type of engineering, medical and management graduates who are decidedly intelligent but lack a broader vision of history, of liberal traditions, humanism and social empathy. They are driven by algorithms and not by the values of a Gandhi or a John Stuart Mill, by the hardware of material aspirations, not the software of a troublesome conscience. It is not their fault, they are products of an uncaring, amoral if not immoral society. They are the products of an educational system that prioritizes material success and power as the new religion and the Apex scale as the new deity: there is no other meaning to life. Their belief in the utilitarian principles of today is total; they have no self-doubts, they exemplify what Mills called " the completeness of limited men."        \n\nTranslation:\n\nHow dare Middle-class Indians who go onto to give some of the most brutal and challenging competitive exams get into the pristine IAS reserved for those kids whose parents packed them to study liberal arts in western universities!!!\n\n&gt;Perhaps because of their training in the dog eats dog IIT type of exam system, they are competitive to a fault which is why there is no esprit de corps left in the IAS- it is every man and woman for him/herself and the CBI take the hindmost.\n\nTranslation: \n\nCivil services have the right to be corrupt. Before, when one of us was accused, we would all brazen it out because we had the right to be corrupt. \n\n&gt;lateral inductions being made to ensure the loyalty of such appointees to only one party, even UPSC question papers are being realigned to project the BJP\'s ideology.\n\nTranslation:\n\n*Experts* in government? An outrage!\n\nThere are plenty more gems.\n\nAnyhow, it is coming to light how much of a closed circuit the civil services were for decades after independence. We shouldn\'t regret those who\'ve resigned. The bureaucracy is the bane of every ordinary Indian citizen, and we\'re starting to see a democratization that has visibly shaken the old guard. But it is clear that they have not been able to reflect on their own errors.'<br />Author: 'Earthborn92'  id: 'ddcegi'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ddcegi/the_repeated_failures_of_the_indian_establishment/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Economist Article - Leader'<br />Body: 'Leaders\nKashmir\nVale of tears\nThe courts’ refusal to curb repression in Kashmir should alarm all Indians\nIt is two months now since India’s parliament abruptly amended the constitution to downgrade Jammu &amp; Kashmir from a partly autonomous state to a territory administered by the central government. That means it is also two months since the Indian authorities detained some 2,000 prominent Kashmiris—politicians, businessmen, activists, journalists—to prevent them from protesting. They continue to be held without charge, many in unknown places. Meanwhile the 7m-odd residents of the Kashmir valley, the state’s main population centre, are under a lockdown of a different sort. Mobile phones and the internet remain cut off; getting around is hard and getting in or out is possible only on the authorities’ say-so. In theory the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (bjp) is integrating Kashmir into the rest of India. In practice it has turned the valley into a vast open-air detention centre.\n\nThat the bjp has it in for Kashmiris is hardly news. The manifesto the party put out before it won its thumping victory in national elections earlier this year called for the scrapping of Jammu &amp; Kashmir’s special status. The state is the only one in India with a Muslim majority, and the Hindu-nationalist bjp dislikes anything that smacks of privileges for Muslims. The bjp also likes to parade its defiance of Pakistan, which controls a slice of Kashmir and claims the rest, and has vehemently denounced the upheaval in the valley. For Narendra Modi, the prime minister and leader of the bjp, picking on Kashmir presents an easy opportunity to pose as a resolute nationalist who will not hesitate to confront his enemies.\n\nBut if Mr Modi’s actions are not that surprising, the reaction of the courts has been (see Asia section). India’s judges are notoriously meddlesome and difficult. No question is beneath their scrutiny: what destinations state-owned airlines should fly to, say, or just how close a liquor store can be to a highway. They have dealt all sorts of embarrassing defeats to the central government in recent years, inventing a previously unknown right to privacy that almost scuppered a huge biometric identification scheme, and voiding a lucrative auction of mobile-telephone licences. Yet on the many glaring abuses occurring in Kashmir they have remained resolutely—and shamefully—silent.\n\nAlthough the courts in Kashmir are in theory functioning, lawyers are striking, making it hard for petitioners to get anywhere. The chief justice of the Supreme Court in Delhi has declared that he is simply too busy to hear all the cases related to the government’s actions in Kashmir. He passed them to other benches of the Supreme Court, one of which gave the government a further month to contemplate its response. Conveniently enough, that pushes any ruling about whether or not the government’s downgrading of Jammu &amp; Kashmir from a state to a territory was constitutional until after the change takes effect, on October 31st. It will also mean, in all likelihood, a further month of detention without trial for the Kashmiris rounded up by the authorities and another month during which humbler Kashmiris will be deprived of rights that other Indians take for granted.\n\nFew of those other Indians will care very much. The Kashmir valley is hemmed in by the Himalayas at the northern extreme of the country, far from most Indians’ thoughts and experience. It has been in some degree of turmoil since partition and independence 71 years ago. It suffers separatist violence, now mostly home-grown rather than instigated by Pakistan, which demands a response from India’s security services—though that does not justify today’s wholesale lockdown. To the extent that the rest of the country gives Kashmiris any thought, it tends to see them as troublemakers, if not traitors. Many Indians are toasting Mr Modi for at last giving them their comeuppance.\n\nBoth gleeful and indifferent observers ought to be more worried. Mr Modi’s authoritarian instincts are not confined to Kashmir. If the courts continue to let him, he will doubtless continue to reshape India in keeping with the bjp’s plainly stated goals. That includes stripping 1.9m poor and illiterate residents of the state of Assam of their citizenship, for example, if they do not have the correct paperwork to prove that they are Indian citizens. Then there is the bjp’s plan to finish the job begun by Hindu zealots in 1992 by building a temple on the site of the mosque they demolished. Events in Kashmir show that the government is ready to trample Indians’ civil rights in order to squelch resistance to its actions. If the Supreme Court is willing to look away today, who is to say that the government will not feel free to carry on?'<br />Author: 'Rbhadaur'  id: 'dcygti'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dcygti/economist_article_leader/</li>

The world economy could more than double in size by 2050, far outstripping population growth, due to continued technology-driven productivity improvements\n\n2. Emerging markets (E7) could grow around twice as fast as advanced economies (G7) on average\n\n3. As a result, six of the seven largest economies in the world are projected to be emerging economies in 2050 led by China (1st), India (2nd) and Indonesia (4th)\n\n\n4. The US could be down to third place in the global GDP rankings while the EU27’s share of world GDP could fall below 10% by 2050\nUK could be down to 10th place by 2050, \n\n5. France out of the top 10 and Italy out of the top 20 as they are overtaken by faster growing emerging economies like Mexico, Turkey and Vietnam respectively\n\n\n6. But emerging economies need to enhance their institutions and their infrastructure significantly if they are to realise their long-term growth potential.'<br />Author: 'aquaboy72'  id: 'dcphxa'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dcphxa/the_world_in_2050_the_long_view_how_will_the/</li>

It\'s easy and  its cool (hey look i don\'t rever the guy everyone thinks is great). But its also ignorant, entitled and disassociated with realities of early 20th century that we don\'t have a clue today in early 21st century. A lot of below may read like exceprts from our school books, but sometimes its important to remember the school lessons. \n\nFew facts\n\n\\- Gandhi had achieved biggest mobilization of masses ever seen in human history.\n\n\\- He made Independence movement a mainstream event for every Indian\n\n\\- He tied the concept of a united India (which was still fragmented among princely states) in mind of every Indian.\n\n\\- He did so without instigating violence and murder and mayhem.\n\nWhat we need to remember is that Britishers had no problem in killing thousands if there was an armed rebellion at any point, just like they did in 1857. 1857 also showed that an armed rebellion against Britishers by fractured Indians was futile. Especially so in 20th century when modern killing machines (Gattling gun, machine guns ) could be used to mow down violent masses in minutes .\n\nBut Britishers had no fucking clue how to deal with a Non-Violent opposition. It was pretty much unprecedented in history of world.  \n\nHowever its extremely interesting to look at profile of people who hate Gandhi. \n\n1. Leftists (who paint him peddling to upper class Hindus) \n2. Pakistanis (who see him peddling to all Hindus)\n3. Far Right Hindus (who see him peddling to Muslims ) \n\nAmazing, isn\'t it ? It\'s almost like his haters have there own special filters to view only selective actions of Gandhi and judged him based on parts, while completely ignoring the sum of the parts. \n\nThere were certainly errors in judgement from hims. Especially in the period between 1945-1948.

      <li>Title::: 'What caused the Indian Blackout of 2012?'<br />Body: "An electrical grid, like the one to which we all are connected, is based on AC current. An AC current has a specified frequency (for India - 50Hz) in which it has to operate. This means that the current which you receive reverses direction  100 times in one second, i.e., once in every 10 milliseconds. A little deviation from this is tolerable, from 49.5-50.2 Hz but any more or less than that will cause all equipment damage. Thus, on occurrence of frequency mismatch the generators are all disconnected from the grid. Restarting a generator is a time consuming affair, which may take upto 5-8 hrs and frequently require outside power source.\n\nThe affected areas are shown in this [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_India_blackouts#/media/File:Indian_states_affected_by_July_2012_power_cuts.svg).\n\n**Technical Details (Simplified):**\n\nAn electrical grid, like the one to which we all are connected, is based on AC current. An AC current has a specified frequency (for India - 50Hz) in which it has to operate. This means that the current which you receive reverses direction  100 times in one second, i.e., once in every 10 milliseconds. A little deviation from this is tolerable, from 49.5-50.2 Hz but any more or less than that will cause all equipment damage. Thus, on occurrence of frequency mismatch the generators are all disconnected from the grid. Restarting a generator is a time consuming affair, which may take up to 5-8 hrs and frequently require outside power source.\n\nAnother interesting characteristic about the grid is that there is no energy storage in the grid. Every equipment you (or any others) switch on, directly causes a generator in the grid to generate more power, as there is no storage of electrical energy. Grid frequency is directly related to power demand and supply mismatch. More mismatch there is, the greater the frequency deviation causing sub-optimal system performance.\n\nThe Indian grid is broadly classified into five grids - North, South, East, West and North East.\n\nSo to predict and manage this loading condition on the grid, Indian govt. has set up one National and five Regional Load Dispatch Centres (NLDC and RLDCs) which forecast the loads on any given day, hour or minute and assign generating stations to supply the electric power so as to maintain perfect match and coordinate power transfer between the regional grids.\n\n**What happened on 30-31 July, 2012:**\n\nAt 2:33:12 am on 30 July, the frequency of the grid started to drop and by 2:33:25 am, the frequency had dropped to 42 Hz, in a span of 13 seconds. Most generators in the grid were shut down by their protective systems, barring a very few. The reason for this was the poorly planned scheduled outages of high voltage transmission lines, large power transfer from the Western to the Northern Grid directly and via the Eastern Grid, and the final nail in the coffin - a tripping of another high voltage transmission line causing huge supply demand mismatch and subsequent blackout in the North, West and East Grid. Power was slowly restored over a period of 10 hrs.\n\nOn 31 July, at 12:57 pm, due to protection system malfunction the grids again collapsed, this time affecting North,East,West and North-Eastern Grids. This is the largest such power outage in the history of the world. Power was restored only by 2 August.\n\n**What were the effects:**\n\nTrains over half of India stopped, hospitals and offices were without power. People sweltered in the July heat. In one word, basic infrastructure took a big hit.\n\n**Can it happen again:**\n\nThe grid rules have been made more stringent and grid protection systems are now audited quarterly to avoid such a case. But with the increasing penetration of 'smart' grid technologies and rising urban power demand, it is not inconceivable that such blackout may occur again. Grid blackouts may also be used as a weapon to attack the nation by terrorists as well as enemy states in a case of war. Blackouts may be larger and more widespread too.\n\n**What can you do:**\n\nTechnically, not much. But always be aware of the nearest source of water, especially if you live in a metro city, that can be used as a drinking source without processing by equipment using electrical energy, or else keep a reasonable store of drinking water. Power restoration may take days.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n1. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012\\_India\\_blackouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_India_blackouts)\n2.

      <li>Title::: 'Streetside Linguistics - Rtu (ऋतु )'<br />Body: '&gt; Bringing back the [old series](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/wiki/streetside_linguistics), yo.\n\nWe have six seasons in India. They are called Rtus. Each Rtu (ऋतु) ideally goes on for 2 months. So, 6 x 2 = 12. The word Rtu, I reckon, comes from Rta.(ऋत)\n\nRta generally means law, the law of the universe. If ever we have 4 fundamental forces combined in a single equation. Remember, we have a word for it - Rta. \n\nBut Rta was also used to describe the path Sun/Moon took in the sky, i.e. ecliptic. \n\nThe ecliptic was properly divided into 6 sections. These sections were called Rtus. \n\n&gt;Of course there is flexibility, and we have varying durations and starting-ending points across India. But the underlying recipe for naming the seasons remain the same. Vasant starts somewhere around March, Greeshma around May, Varsha around July, Sharad around September, Hemant around November, Shishira around January.\n\nSo, what are these seasons ? \n\nBefore jumping onto seasons of India. I need to properly un-brainwash ourselves from our English training, which as we will find out completely fcks up how we understand seasons. \n\nThe year could be, irrespective of any region, can be broken down into 4 key focal points. These are March 21(equinox 1), June 21(solsctice 1), September 21(equinox 2), December 21(solsctice 2).  \n\nSo.. Seasons..\n\n1. Vasant (वसंत) or Vatsara-ant (वत्सर +अंत) evidently means end(ant) of vatsara(year). This is precisely why a lot of people still call the new year ceremony sam-vatsari | संवत्सरी  (completion of year). Most sub-regions in India start the new year from this point. Even Persia, i.e. Nowruz. Even the people celebrating Baisakhi, Bohag, Bihu, Tamil New Year celebrate the same time. The only difference is that they have stuck to Vaishakh month which once coincided with Equinox 1 (March 21), but has now moved forward into mid-April due to precession of equinoxes. \n\nVasant is called Rturaj (king of seasons), it is a friend of Kamadeva. The current incoming of Vasant is done on Basant Panchami, where Kamadeva is worshipped. The association of spring and love, (Valentine\'s day) is not so new after all. \n\n2. Greeshma (ग्रीष्म) is the season of summer. Summer itself is a cognate of the word "sama"(सम) in Sanskrit and "hama" in Avestan. "sama" means equal or half year. This tells that word Summer essentially carries in itself the information that the calendar would start from winter solsctice rather than spring equinox. So, Summer, technically is not Greeshma. Because using the word Summer means you follow a year starting from January.\n\n3. Varsha (वर्षा) is the season of rains, vRsha (वृष) means to distribute. The word for year, varsha (वर्ष), comes from Varsha only. The Hindi word Baras(year), barsaat(rains), baarish(rains) all come from the same root. \n\n4. Sharad (शरद) is the season of ripening. The word Sharad means both year and ripening. Sharad occurs at Equinox 2. Interestingly, because of this interesting position, a lot of sub-regions in India celebrated Sharad as new year instead of Vasanta. Gujarat is one of them. Diwali is supposed to be a new year/ half-year festival, it has shifted way deep into November (precession of equinoxes). Currently Navratri (which are relatively recent festivals) celebrate the incoming of Sharad. The Avestan word for year is Saredha. \n\n5. Hemant (हेमंत) - literally means "icy". Actually, the word Hima means ice/cold. Hence, the season with ice/cold is Hemant. \n\n6. Shishira (शिशिर) - literally means "cold". The root word shi means unmoving and indolent. \n\nNow, as I had mentioned 4 focal points. The seasons as they are 6, will not always match with the focal points which are 4. \n\nThe prime festivals at 4 festivals are -- \n\n1. Equinox 1 -- Holi, Chaitra Navratri, Gudi Padwa, Ugadi ( Bihu, Baishakhi, Bohag --&gt; drifting ) \n\n2. Solsctice 1 -- Guru Poornima\n\n3. Equinox 2 -- Navratri, Durga Pooja, Dussehra (Diwali, Narak Chaturdashi -- drifting). \n\n4. Solstice 2 -- Makara Sankranti ,Uttarayana ( drifting, one can back calculate to know that Makara Sankranti started in 300 BCE). \n\nIt is interesting to note that it was Greeks who brought the system of 12 divisions of Ecliptic (zodiac) in India. Thus, giving us the word "hora" (होर) in our Sanskrit language. The word "Hora" means year in Greek, also the word "year" comes from Hora itself. \n\nThus the system of Rashis as we know them came from Greeks, and as it stays, didnt come from Vedas. So, keep that in mind if someone tries to entice you by using "Vedic Jyotish" :D\n\n-------------------\n\nThere are more episodes to this series, [please check them out as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/wiki/streetside_linguistics).

      <li>Title::: 'Biweekly Science Thread [Chapter 1]'<br />Body: 'I would like to dedicate my first post to women in science.\n\n1. **Vera Rubin** (July 23, 1928 – December 25, 2016) was an american astronomer famous for providing evidence of the existence of Dark Matter. Rubin\'s calculations showed that galaxies must contain at least five to ten times as much dark matter as ordinary matter. She studied at Vassar college, Cornell university and then at Georgetown university.\n\nRecalling her high school years Vera said " I was very, very interested in  astronomy, and I just could keep myself going by telling myself that I  was just different than other people, that they just had different  interests than I did. I had a physics teacher who was a real macho guy.  Everybody loved him — all the males. He did experiments; he set up labs.  Everybody was very enthusiastic. I really don’t think he knew how to  relate to a young girl in his class… He never knew that I was interested  in astronomy, he never knew that I was interested in science. The day I  learned I got my scholarship to Vassar, I was really excited because I  couldn’t go to college without a scholarship. I met him in the hall, and  probably said the first thing I had ever said to him outside of the  class, and I told him I got the scholarship to Vassar, and he said to  me, “As long as you stay away from science, you should do okay.” It  takes an enormous self-esteem to listen to things like that and not be  demolished.\n\n She wanted to enroll in a graduate program at Princeton, but was barred due to her gender. Princeton would not accept women as astronomy graduate students for 27 more years. A college interviewer, who dismissed her interest in doing  research in astronomy, asked if Vera would consider instead a career  painting astronomical objects. A  department chair suggested that he should present her research paper at  an upcoming American Astronomical Society conference, instead of her,  because she was pregnant. Replied young Vera: “That’s OK; I’ll do it.”  She was denied observing on the Hale telescope at Palomar because women  were not allowed until the 1960s. They  told her, ‘It’s a real problem because we don’t have a ladies room,’ so  she went back to her room and took out a little piece of paper and cut  it into a skirt and went to the bathroom door and stuck it on the men’s  figure on the door. She said, ‘Look, now you have a ladies room.’\n\n “Don’t let anyone keep you down for  silly reasons” she liked to say. Vera passionately supported women scientists, always encouraging, inspiring, helping pave their way,  saying “worldwide, half of all brains are in women,” and “there is no  problem in science that can be solved by a man that cannot be solved by a  woman.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. **Kamala Sohonie** (14 September 1912 – 28 June 1998) was a pioneering Indian biochemist who in 1939 became the first Indian woman to receive a PhD in a scientific discipline. Her acceptance into and work at the IISc,Bangalore, paved the way for women to be accepted into the institution for the first time in it its history.\n\nKamala then applied to the IISc for a research fellowship, but her application was turned down by the then-Director and Nobel Laureate Prof. C V Raman on the grounds that women were not considered competent enough to pursue research.  Kamala responded to the rejection by holding a \'satyagraha\' outside  Prof. C V Raman\'s office which persuaded him to grant her admission, but  with three conditions attached:  \n\n* She will not be allowed as a regular candidate and will be on  probation for the first year also will be known throughout the campus  after she succeed her work\n* She has to work late night as per instruction of her guide\n* She will not spoil the environment of the lab (she should not be a \'distraction\' to the male researchers)\n\nAlthough admittedly humiliated by them, Kamala agreed to the terms,  thus becoming in 1933 the first woman to be admitted into the institute. She would later say, "*Though  Raman was a great scientist, he was very narrow-minded. I can never  forget the way he treated me just because I was a woman. Even then,  Raman didn\'t admit me as a regular student. This was a great insult to  me. The bias against women was so bad at that time. What can one expect  if even a Nobel Laureate behaves in such a way*?". after a year, many women got their admission to the institution.\n\nshe worked under Dr. Robin Hill at Cambridge University and studied plant tissues. From her work on potatoes, she discovered  the enzyme \'Cytochrome C\' which plays an essential role in the electron  transport chain (the process by which energy is created for organisms),  found in plants, human and animal cells. Her thesis on the subject was completed in 14 months and was 40 pages long, a departure from the usually much longer PhD submissions. She eventually received Rashtrapati award for her work.\n\nAlthough it has significantly improved but sexism in academia still exists. I personally know an esteemed science institution of roughly 150+ men faculty and students with the unsaid rule that women don\'t join it. The other case I know a brilliant female faculty who chairs two department who was sexually assaulted by two colleague and since has stopped working with men and those men were transferred to another institute. One of my friend was denied working on detectors because It involves working at odd hours.'<br />Author: 'sharma_ji_ki_betii'  id: 'datlf1'<br />Score:25<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/datlf1/biweekly_science_thread_chapter_1/</li>

Wells enunciated US President Donald Trump’s offers to mediate, saying it stems from his desire to reduce tensions between South Asia’s two nuclear neighbours.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“Prime Minister Khan has made important public commitments regarding the need to prevent cross-border terrorism and sanctuary for terrorist organisations, which, if implemented fully, would provide a strong basis for dialogue,” Ms Wells said in her opening statement.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In an apparent reference to reports that some protesters in AJK wanted to march up to the Line of Control (LoC) to show their rejection of India’s Aug 5 decision to annex occupied Kashmir, Ms Wells said: “We call on all parties to maintain peace and stability along the Line of Control.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;During this week’s 74th session of the UN General Assembly, US and other officials were heard expressing concerns over this report and some even pointed out that any attempt to cross the LoC in today’s tense situation could have dangerous consequences.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In her opening remarks, Ms Wells pointed out that President Trump had “made clear his concern over Indo-Pak tensions and his readiness to facilitate a dialogue if asked”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Official says Washington will help Islamabad avoid being placed on FATF blacklist*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Later, while answering a question about a possible US role in reducing tensions in South Asia, she noted that President Trump “speaks quite openly about his concerns over the level of tension between the two countries, particularly between two nuclear powers”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The US president, she added, was also open about “his desire to see those tensions reduced; his willingness to play whatever positive role he can, including mediation if he were to be asked to do so”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mr Trump first expressed his desire to mediate during a White House meeting with PM Khan in July and since then he has repeatedly raised this issue in his remarks and in meeting with Mr Khan and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Even India’s continued rejection of these offers has discouraged him who mentioned his offers in his media briefings during the UNGA as well.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ms Wells said the United States has already expressed its “continued concerns over the widespread detentions, including of local political and business leaders, and the restrictions on the residents of Jammu and Kashmir”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Reminding the Indian government to remove those restrictions, she said: “We look forward to the Indian government’s resumption of political engagement with local leaders and the scheduling of promised elections at the earliest opportunity.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Trade with US**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ms Wells said that in his meeting with Mr Khan on Monday, President Trump built on the conversations he started during the PM’s visit to the White House in July, including how to expand trade.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“We are going to host 15 separate Pakistani trade delegations over the next year in order to support trade and investment in energy, healthcare, agriculture, and franchising,” she added.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ms Well said that President Trump also has appreciated Pakistan’s efforts to bring peace to Afghanistan, and the US wanted to help Pakistan meet the requirements of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to avoid being placed on its blacklist, which could unsettle the country’s economy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“We look forward to the next FATF plenary meeting in October, where it’s important — and more important than ever — that Pakistan take the sustained and irreversible actions to achieve its policy goals on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism to satisfy fully its international commitments,” she said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ms Wells said that earlier this week, she spoke at the re-launching of the US-Pakistan Women’s Council, a public-private partnership that will leverage the power of US private sector to create opportunities for Pakistani women and girls.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“The event underscored for me the potential for our relationship to really be a force for good, but I think Pakistan’s actions in the coming weeks will be critical to determining the trajectory of our overall relationship,” she said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Asked if the US was doing enough to reduce tensions between India and Pakistan, she said Washington was “always actively promoting regional stability, and certainly one of the first strategies that was put forward by this administration was the South Asia strategy”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This was a strategy not just to stabilise Afghanistan as peace in Afghanistan “requires the full support of the regional countries and regional powers”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She pointed out that President Trump has been deeply engaged with his counterparts from India and Pakistani in meetings and in phone conversations.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“I think it’s evident the president has a very good rapport with both leaders, and the conversations that we have on some of the challenging issues that have been at the heart of the conflict over many decades — we engage in those issues intensively,” she said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ms Wells noted that while the disagreement was continuing between India and Pakistan, “our ability to engage with the leaders and our willingness to engage with the leaders and their receptivity to our engagement is positive”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The US official noted that Indian and Pakistani leaders had quite publicly framed their disagreements with one another during the UNGA.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“What we have to focus on is like can we achieve confidence that non-terrorist or non-state actors are no longer afforded sanctuary and able to operate in the region, can we achieve confidence that both sides are committed to a constructive dialogue,” she said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“And when the confidence emerges, I think then the (India, Pakistan) dialogue will follow. We will do whatever we can to try to help promote greater confidence between the countries, but practical steps have to be taken.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Published in Dawn, September 29th, 2019*'<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'dasqdz'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dasqdz/official_says_washington_will_help_islamabad/</li>

Not only are these western terms laughably inadequate in capturing the nuanced political mindset of our people, but these words are almost always used in a negative context. Which help no one but the enemies who would very much like to see us divided.\n\nWe are (un)fortunate witnesses to the chaos that is American democracy right now. If you have been observing long enough, you would remember that the political divide was always there, but it wasn\'t such a polarised environment it is today. The "left" hates the "right", the "right" hates them back equally. Everyone sees themselves as a soldier of their "side" and blindly follows the thoughts of their echo chamber without thinking about them individually. Rabid followers, left or right, are constantly attacking half the people of their own country, instead of attacking ideas. Foreign actors are likely fuelling the hatred on both sides.\n\nLet\'s not delve ourselves into ultra-polarized landscape the US finds itself in today. Groupism is an idiot\'s retreat. Sadly, idiots are often in abundance in every "group".\n\nPut very crudely, a diverse, but united society looks somewhat like [this](https://i.imgur.com/G1fRl6r.png).

Following your echo chamber blindly is what leads to it.\n\nWe are better than that.

Getting the host to accommodate your needs and comfort, and cater to your dietary requirements, prayer needs, translation services, physical needs, etc, keeps the engagement a bit more balanced, with the host accommodating the guest (as it should be). \n\nBut doormats and cowards, who are going to the event with a begging bowl mentality, where they aren\'t confident of their own self-worth, and want to appease everyone in the vain hope of a handout or some other concessions, will avoid doing these things, and try to be the most accommodating guests and bend over backwards to ingratiate themselves with others. This rarely works out though, because people like dealing with people who command respect, and those that seem to have some value - because a *bhikari* can\'t give you anything, but a self-respecting leader probably can. \n\n\n\n#So, how is this native-language issue a power play?\n\n* It forces the other side(s) to cross-analyze and independently translate the subtleties and nuances of your choice of words (because the quality of just the live-translation might not capture the subtleties of everything being said). \n\n* You also have a natural advantage and command over what you say, being a native speaker, keeping you from making any blunders or faux-pas. \n\n* You also force the organizers to provide multiple translators for your language - Hindi to English, Hindi to French, Hindi to Arabic, etc *(translation is generally done directly to the other languages, not Chinese-whisper style)*. This means people need to hire translators fluent in your language, thus increasing the value associated with your language - people who speak your language **get paid**. ImmyChan\'s speech needed only translation from English to other languages, which was already provided for.\n\n* And finally, it gives a clear signal to everyone present, that even when you\'re at their venue, in their country, you still command the attention of all your people back home, and are using their platform to send them a message too. It shows that millions of Indians are watching and listening to what is being said here today, and that the person speaking is not just playing to the international audience, but also to his power base back home. That is the source of his authority, and he is their representative - and that hint doesn\'t escape the attention of veterans of that arena.\n\n\n\n#What it projects:\n\nBasic confidence - it\'s the difference between going and trying to prove something to someone you view as your superior *("look sir, I speak your language so well!")* vs going and *being yourself* in front of peers that you view as being *equals* at the very least *("hi, do you speak my language?")*.\n\nSecurity - That you don\'t harbor deep-seated insecurities and weakness. Insecure people constantly latch onto others for approval and validation, blindly imitating and aping others, and trying desperately to "fit in". People have an innate distrust of people who do this.\n\nStrength - That you have strength of character and have the courage to go into a crowd of strangers and be openly different - a scary thing for many people.\n\nClarity of purpose and allegiances - You make no secret of where your loyalties lie. You\'re not sucking up to people, but dealing with them on an equal footing, for mutual benefit if possible.\n\nCore principles - You can compromise on many issues, be nice to everyone, be polite or formal or tough as needed, but you **will NOT compromise** on certain issues - your roots, your identity, your moral compass.\n\n#How could any of this *possibly* apply to you?\n\nThis entire topic is essentially about **using certain tools to create positioning and perception**, with the objective of maximizing your impact, and increasing your chances of success among groups of people (or even individuals). It could be a board meeting, a business negotiation, a marketing pitch, a job interview, a new school or college you\'re attending, an international event, a multicultural function. Your tool doesn\'t have to be language. It can be anything.\n\nThe key thing to understand, is that being unnecessarily self-effacing or overly conciliatory or excessively self-critical/deprecating does *NOT* (contrary to popular belief) win you anything. I\'ve interacted with thousands and thousands of people from every part of the world. They *always* will have more respect, warmth, and trust, towards someone who is not confused or ashamed about their identity, but is firm and confident in WHO THEY ARE. Be it your cultural clothing, your language, religion, nationality, history, songs, food, festivals... all of it. \n\n**Real. Secure. Unapologetic.**\n\nThe more connected you are to your roots, the more most people will respect, like, and even admire you. The more you try to "fit in", the less interesting you are, and the more insecure you seem. Nobody trusts insecure people. Nobody.\n\n**CAUTION: This does NOT mean you need to become a walking-talking cultural stereotype.** Far from it. You should craft your own identity, your own style, your own image, rooted *firmly* in your own convictions and beliefs. You\'re a Shaivite Hindu from Tamil Nadu, with a passion for black-metal? Incorporate it. Own it. Stop being embarrassed or apologetic about who you are. You don\'t need to give up eating pizzas or sushi or burgers or whatever, if that\'s what you like. If you\'re gonna turn around after reading this post and suddenly become Sattvik just to "fit in" to what your culture expects from you, you\'ve missed the whole point. Do whatever you do based on your own convictions. But *know* whatever it is you\'re doing and *why*. \n\nAnd none of this means that you can\'t laugh at yourself or take some mockery in stride. Quite the opposite. Remember Modi\'s laugh when Trump pointed out that he *intentionally* doesn\'t speak in English. It\'s excellent to be able to laugh at yourself, and not take yourself too seriously. The world is a stage and we\'re all just characters playing a part. Make yours a memorable one. \n\nBut don\'t shy away from standing up for your ideals and roots when they\'re being attacked, either. Educate people about why you stand by these things and share your perspectives.\n\nLastly, and a bit off-topic, there\'s a subtle psychological trick (or a vulnerability) called the foot-in-the-door technique. *If someone agrees to meet a small request of yours, they find it significantly harder to refuse when you follow that up with a more significant request.* The same principle is can be applied to a more personal, one-to-one application of this theme, where, if they have made adjustments for you on a small issue, they may be ever so slightly more inclined to adjust some more for future requests that are more significant. I\'m not sure how much that would play into what Modi did, but it\'s just something you should be aware of. If someone asks if you\'d like something to drink, *always* say yes please, and ask for whatever you prefer - tea or coffee or whatever else is available. Always. Even if you\'re not that thirsty. Meeting? Yes. Waiting room? Yes. Interview? Yes.\n\nAnyway, these were some tools, and some perspectives on the reasons Modi does what he does, and how some of it might apply to your own lives. More than the resident Indians, I would hope that NRIs and ABCDs read this and apply it. Too many Indians abroad are so eager to admit they know nothing about their culture or about yoga and are wholly westernized (read - "civilized"). It\'s high time that more of us started being proud of our identity, cultures, faiths, clothes, etc.\n\nJai Hind.'<br />Author: 'fsm_vs_cthulhu'  id: 'dai56s'<br />Score:94<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dai56s/why_modi_speaks_in_hindi_even_when_making/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Here, full text reply of India to Imran at UNGA'<br />Body: '**Mr. President,**  \nI take the floor to exercise India’s right of reply to the statement made by the Prime Minister of Pakistan.  \nEvery word spoken from the podium of this august Assembly, it is believed, carries the weight of history. Unfortunately, what we heard today from Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan was a callous portrayal of the world in binary terms. Us vs Them; Rich vs Poor; North vs South; Developed Vs Developing; Muslims vs Others. A script that fosters divisiveness at the United Nations. Attempts to sharpen differences and stir up hatred, are simply put - “hate speech”.  \nRarely has the General Assembly witnessed such misuse, rather abuse, of an opportunity to reflect. Words matter in diplomacy. Invocation of phrases such as “pogrom”, “bloodbath”, “racial superiority”, “pick up the gun” and “fight to the end” reflect a medieval mindset and not a 21st century vision.  \nPrime Minister Khan’s threat of unleashing nuclear devastation qualifies as brinksmanship, not statesmanship.  \nEven coming from the leader of a country that has monopolized the entire value chain of the industry of terrorism, Prime Minister Khan’s justification of terrorism was brazen and incendiary.  \nFor someone who was once a cricketer and believed in the gentleman’s game, today’s speech bordered on crudeness of the variety that is reminiscent of the guns of Darra Adam Khel.  \nNow that Prime Minister Imran Khan has invited UN Observers to Pakistan to verify that there are no militant organisations in Pakistan, the world will hold him to that promise.  \n**Here are a few questions that Pakistan can respond to as a precursor to the proposed verification.**  \n\n\n* Can Pakistan confirm the fact that it is home to 130 UN designated terrorists and 25 terrorist entities listed by the UN, as of today?\n* Will Pakistan acknowledge that it is the only Government in the world that provides pension to an individual listed by the UN in the Al Qaeda and Da’esh Sanctions list!\n* Can Pakistan explain why here in New York, its premier bank, the Habib Bank had to shut shop after it was fined millions of dollars over terror financing?\n* Will Pakistan deny that the Financial Action Task Force has put the country on notice for its violations of more than 20 of the 27 key parameters?\n* And would Prime Minister Khan deny to the city of New York that he was an open defender of Osama bin Laden?\n\n**Mr President,**  \nHaving mainstreamed terrorism and hate speech, Pakistan is trying to play its wild card as the newfound champion of human rights.  \nThis a country that has shrunk the size of its minority community from 23% in 1947 to 3% today and has subjected Christians, Sikhs, Ahmadiyas, Hindus, Shias, Pashtuns, Sindhis and Balochis to draconian blasphemy laws, systemic persecution, blatant abuse and forced conversions.  \nTheir newfound fascination for preaching human rights is akin to trophy hunting of the endangered mountain goat - markhor.  \nPogroms, Prime Minister Imran Khan Niazi, are not a phenomenon of today’s vibrant democracies. We would request you to refresh your rather sketchy understanding of history. Do not forget the gruesome genocide perpetrated by Pakistan against its own people in 1971 and the role played by Lt. Gen A A K Niazi. A sordid fact that the Hon’ble Prime Minister of Bangladesh reminded this Assembly about earlier this afternoon.\n\n  \n**Mr President,**  \nPakistan’s virulent reaction to the removal of an outdated and temporary provision that was hindering development and integration of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir stems from the fact that those who thrive on conflict never welcome the ray of peace.  \nWhile Pakistan has ventured to upstream terrorism and downstream hate speech there, India is going ahead with mainstreaming development in Jammu and Kashmir.  \nThe mainstreaming of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, as well as Ladakh, in India’s thriving and vibrant democracy with a millennia-old heritage of diversity, pluralism and tolerance is well and truly underway. Irreversibly so.  \nCitizens of India do not need anyone else to speak on their behalf, least of all those who have built an industry of terrorism from the ideology of hate.\n\n  \nI thank you, Mr President.'<br />Author: 'FirstInMillion'  id: 'dac20j'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dac20j/here_full_text_reply_of_india_to_imran_at_unga/</li>

What are some good sources(books, videos, online courses) to get a more in-depth understanding of **contemporary** economics, so as to be able to understand all the lingo, arguments in videos/articles I read.\n\nb) I want to play devils advocate and ask some questions :\n\n* Also, the steps being taken by govt. seem to be piecemeal, reactionary and there doesn\'t seem to be a coherent "vision". For example, the present reduction in corporate tax, why was it not done when the US-China trade war initially started, if the idea was to attract the industries relocating from China.\n*  The bad load thingy has been going on for 3-4 years now, what concrete steps has the govt. taken to resolve it. I remember Modi saying once that he was aware of the bad condition when he took charge in 2014 but didn\'t want to create panic by taking out a white paper. I understand that we are cleaning the rot of the bad loans given during UPA, but still...\n* Taken from the 3rd article, "I  would say that in the last four or five years, our exports were virtually stagnant. It is true that the world economy has not been growing too rapidly but we are doing much worse than other countries. Bangladesh, Vietnam and many other countries have done a much better job of export promotion". Why is it so?\n* In connection to above, what is the progress on labour reforms, land reforms, what\'s the holdup? Why can\'t the govt. bulldozer through with these?\n* And finally it seems that the people have done their job of giving a full majority to Modi in 2014, and reposed faith in him in 2019. It seems to me that the govt. is squandering away the political capital on economic front. I am more than happy say on the fundamental issues from(370, Ram Mandir). We can\'t afford to take a stroll, we have to run now, we might not get the same opportunity in 2024...\n\nThanks in advance.

His family, he wrote, is living in the Indian-administered side of the territory, but he had no way to find out if they were safe. The reason: the communications blackout imposed on Kashmir by the Indian government, soon to enter its third month. “Is there any humanity left in this country?” he asked.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As he wrote this, television channels were broadcasting images of President Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the glitzy “Howdy, Modi!” [event in Texas](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-plays-unusual-role-of-warm-up-act-at-massive-rally-for-modi-in-houston/2019/09/22/18cf7a2a-dd50-11e9-8dc8-498eabc129a0_story.html), attended by thousands of Indian Americans. Trump compared Modi’s popularity with that of Elvis Presley and referred to Modi as “the father of India” — in the same year that marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Indian television channels beamed in pride, calling it a moment of great honor for the country, while celebrities congratulated the prime minister for [receiving](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/bill-gates-to-honor-indias-modi-despite-kashmir-concerns/2019/09/16/6fcaf0f2-d8c3-11e9-a1a5-162b8a9c9ca2_story.html) the “Global Goalkeeper” award from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. As this all took place, 8 million Kashmiris are trapped in what seems like an endless limbo, as the curfew and lockdown India imposed last month largely continues. But Indian democracy has developed uncomfortable amnesia, as if Kashmir has ceased to exist in our imagination.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is not the only recent story to expose the moral vacuum in India. The government [has just announced the construction](https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-navi-mumbai-to-have-maharashtras-first-detention-centre-for-illegal-immigrants-report/338123) of one of the country’s biggest detention centers for migrants in the financial capital of Mumbai. The decision was made after India [declared](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/9/17/20861427/india-assam-citizenship-muslim-detention-camps) 2 million people from the northeastern state of Assam — many of whom are Muslim — to be “migrants,” who are potentially subject to deportation or detention. Home Minister Amit Shah, the second-in-command to Modi, has [infamously referred](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/a-crackdown-in-india-on-suspected-illegal-immigration-could-leave-millions-stateless/2019/08/26/4f46b3a0-b471-11e9-8e94-71a35969e4d8_story.html) to migrants as “termites” and has promised to implement this exercise throughout the country.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;India’s Muslims understand this messaging loud and clear. Mosques around the country have started asking the community to keep their documentation in order. During the Friday prayers, my local mosque in Mumbai recently asked Muslims to look out for their birth certificates and affidavits to prove their domicile. At least [30 percent](https://news.gallup.com/poll/157079/muslims-india-confident-democracy-despite-economic-educational-challenges.aspx) of India’s Muslim population [lives below the poverty line](https://qz.com/india/1399537/indian-muslims-have-the-least-chances-of-escaping-poverty/); [many have been excluded](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/no-respite-from-poverty-for-muslims/article25429598.ece) from education and jobs. These Muslims are struggling to make sense of the migrant paranoia and anxiety that has been unleashed by the Modi government.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Assam, Kashmir and the detention camp in Mumbai are early indicators of India’s future under Modi and his Hindu nationalist ideals. The Modi-led government also plans to revise the foundations of the secular constitution. It is [mulling over a law](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.dnaindia.com_india_report-2Dbill-2Dto-2Dprevent-2Dreligious-2Dconversion-2Dlikely-2Dto-2Dbe-2Dintroduced-2Din-2Dnext-2Dparliament-2Dsession-2Dsources-2D2780534&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=RAhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg&amp;r=tHmKDYZH6qCEQ8bCYILF2s7tyum2UoDlHUXhA875LVs&amp;m=tcD6wEJPXbPYAMKPR9RJiZu1RkofM1Gw6BDlp_yCAjY&amp;s=0JT_ZKHZR4HMTd9HULoEFkT4TmN6VFQx5GXFa29mzuk&amp;e=) to prevent citizens from converting to another religion. A similar bill was introduced in the state of Gujarat during Modi’s term as head of the government there, one that was also tainted by the 2002 anti-Muslim riots that killed [1,000 people](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/people/article/3010554/gujarat-riots-they-raped-me-butchered-my-child-because-we-were).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One of the rights guaranteed by the Indian constitution is the right to freedom of religion. In a robust democracy, inhabited by citizens who once venerated Gandhi as the father of a glorious nation, this religious fearmongering ought to be anathema to the legacy they claim to celebrate. But India is failing to live up to its founding ideals.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It stands in contradiction with the democracies it claims to compete with in greatness. Though the United States and Britain have elected Trump and Boris Johnson, the societies they lead are at least attesting to the great test of truth by holding their leaders accountable. Unlike the journalists, artists and activists of the West, their Indian counterparts use their social media and public platforms to sing the glory of the prime minister. Some of India’s leading filmmakers [are even queuing up](https://www.msn.com/en-in/entertainment/bollywood/ht-exclusive-sanjay-leela-bhansali-to-make-film-on-pm-modi/ar-AAHomNY) to make hagiographies of Modi, [reimagining him](https://www.news18.com/news/movies/pm-narendra-modi-biopic-reviews-critics-call-it-a-hagiography-vivek-oberois-acting-panned-2157687.html) as the next Gandhi. Indian commentators have even taken aim at Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, viewing her through the prism of our convenient nationalism and ridiculing her for protesting human rights abuses in Kashmir. The same people look the other way when asked to condemn hate crimes and the lynching of minorities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Those who dissent are either silenced or isolated. There are virtual lynch mobs who troll or silence any opinion or view that is critical of the Modi regime. Journalists face the prospect of either losing their jobs or being forced to become cheerleaders for the government. “Where do you find these reporters?” [Trump asked Modi](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-prime-minister-modi-india-bilateral-meeting-new-york-ny/) with envy at a joint Tuesday news conference.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A country that is celebrating the greatness of the Mahatma on the 150th anniversary of his birth should be embarrassed by the distorted morality and cowardice that has become all to prevalent — attitudes that Gandhi detested and combated, sacrificing his own life in the process. It is time India resets its moral compass.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thursday, as Modi takes to the podium of the United Nations to proclaim his message to the world, he would be well advised to acknowledge this uncomfortable truth'<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'da0oy4'<br />Score:32<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/da0oy4/rana_ayyubs_has_started_with_her_hit_pieces_on/</li>

Gives you a full overview of all the economic parameters.\n\n [https://www.cmie.com/kommon/bin/sr.php?kall=warticle&amp;dt=2019-09-23%2015:41:50&amp;msec=176](https://www.cmie.com/kommon/bin/sr.php?kall=warticle&amp;dt=2019-09-23%2015:41:50&amp;msec=176) \n\n \n\n&gt;Industrial production recovers, in parts  \n&gt;  \n&gt;IIP showed a y-o-y growth of 4.3 per cent in July 2019. This comes after growth slowed to 1.2 per cent in June 2019. Recovery was majorly driven by the manufacturing sector which grew by 4.2 per cent in July compared to a y-o-y growth of 0.2 per cent in June. 13 out of 23 industries in the manufacturing sector showed a y-o-y increase in production. Their combined weight in IIP is 55.2 per cent. The mining &amp; quarrying sector recorded a y-o-y increase of 4.9 per cent. Growth in electricity generation slowed to 4.8 per cent in July from 8.2 per cent in June 2019.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Capital goods production recorded a y-o-y decline of 7.1 per cent in July 2019. This was the sharpest monthly fall in this fiscal year. The index has been contracting on a y-o-y basis since January 2019, indicating a continuation of slowdown in investment activity.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The consumer durables index contracted by 2.7 per cent in April-July 2019 on a y-o-y basis. However, this is a somewhat heterogeneous group with heterogeneous growth rates within. A re-organisation of the constituents of this group shows that while the non-impulsive goods like automobiles and household goods saw a contraction in the current year so far, the relatively impulsively purchased goods saw a positive growth. Wearing apparels grew by 7.5 per cent and personal use goods grew by 7.3 per cent. The fall was restricted to automobiles and household goods sub-groups, which are the least impulsive buys. Electronic, furniture and jewellery sub-group which contains several non-impulsive buys did record growth, but a much smaller one at 2.7 per cent.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Domestic demand in the auto industry continued to worsen in August 2019, as per data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). Overall domestic sales declined by 23.5 per cent when compared to the same month in the previous year. The decline was steeper than the 18.7 per cent fall seen in July 2019. Domestic sales of passenger cars recorded a y-o-y decline of 41.1 per cent, which is the steepest fall in over 2 decades. Motorcycle sales declined by 22.3 per cent to touch a 32-month low in August 2019.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As per media reports, falling domestic demand for automobiles may be due to a combination of factors like rising prices due to compulsory safety norms, rising road taxes in certain states and postponing consumption owing to uncertainties over BS-VI emission norms. Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland are some of the companies which have announced non-working days across varying plants in the country, following the sharp drop in sales.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Unlike consumer durables, consumer non-durables recorded a 7.2 per cent growth in April-July 2019, as compared to a 2.7 per cent growth during the same year ago period. Primary goods recorded a y-o-y growth of 3.5 per cent in July compared to 0.4 per cent growth in June 2019. Intermediate goods and infrastructure / construction goods also recorded a growth of 13.9 per cent and 2.1 per cent in July, respectively.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Amidst reports of linking retail loans to the repo rate and heavy discounts, the demand in the festive season will decide the fate of the industrial sector. On Friday, the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a cut in corporate tax for certain companies to 22 per cent from the existing 30 per cent. She also amended GST rates on certain consumer goods. Rates for the gems and jewellery industry were reduced and increased for caffeinated beverages. There was no direct relief announced for the auto industry.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Imports worsen  \n&gt;  \n&gt;India’s trade deficit stood at USD 13.5 billion in August 2019, almost unchanged from July 2019. During the first quarter of this fiscal year, average trade deficit was higher at USD 16.3 billion. Even though both exports and imports have recorded a fall in August 2019, the steep y-o-y fall in imports of 13.5 per cent is responsible for the declining trade deficit. In August 2019, exports declined by 6.1 per cent.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Imports declined for all the three major segments in August 2019 i.e. crude &amp; petroleum products (POL), gold &amp; silver and non-POL and non-gold &amp; silver commodities. Imports of non-POL and non-gold &amp; silver commodities recorded a y-o-y decline of 9.8 per cent during the month. This segment has been declining for 3 months to reach its sharpest fall in August 2019. A fall in this segment affirms the continuing weakness in overall domestic demand.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Crude oil and petroleum products imports declined by 8.9 per cent in August 2019, owing to falling crude oil prices. The Indian basket of crude oil price dropped to USD 59.5 per barrel in August 2019, since its peak of USD 80.1 per barrel in October 2018. A high base effect is thus expected to continue till October 2019. But, there is some uncertainty owing to the drone attack on Saudi Aramco production facility in Saudi Arabia on 14 September 2019. This has led to the rise in the Indian basket of crude price by 9.7 per cent within 1 working day of the attack, after which the price has remained volatile.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Turning to gold, its imports recorded a y-o-y decline of 62.5 per cent in August 2019, which is the sharpest decline since August 2016. The fall in imports is related to a y-o-y increase in gold prices which rose by 24.8 per cent in August. The price reached USD 1,499 per troy ounce (London bullion). This is the highest price recorded since 2013. Gold imports have fallen for the second month in a row, owing to rising prices since June 2019. As per reports, the US-China trade war has some bearing on the rising gold prices.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Exports declined in August 2019 by 6.1 per cent over a high base of 19.1 per cent in the year ago month. This is the second month to show a decline in the current fiscal year. The average exports from April to August 2019 were USD 26.7 billion, lower by 1.7 per cent than a year ago. 22 out of 30 major commodities reported a y-o-y decline in exports in August 2019. Exports of petroleum products declined for the fourth month in a row, with a fall of 10.7 per cent in August alone. Non-POL exports also showed a 5.3 per cent decline in this month.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On 14 September 2019, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a host of measures to boost exports in the country. Two of the important announcements include the replacement of the existing Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS) with Remission of Duties or Taxes on Export Product (RoDTEP) from January 1, 2020 and to release additional funds for export credit.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Disparate trends in the transportation sector  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Revenue earning railway freight traffic for major commodities slipped to almost a 2-year low to reach 91.1 million tonnes in August 2019. It showed a y-o-y contraction of 6.1 per cent, which is the sharpest fall in over 2 decades. The slowdown is spreading across sectors as 8 out of 10 major commodities which form 82.7 per cent of railway tonnage showed a y-o-y decline in August. During April-July 2019, not more than 4 commodities had shown a decline in freight traffic.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Major commodities which showed a decline in railway freight traffic were coal and cement. In August 2019, coal tonnage alone recorded a decline of 9.5 per cent, which was the lowest in 3 years. Cement transported by railways continued to decline for the 5th month in a row in August with the average y-o-y fall of 10.2 per cent between April and August 2019. Growth in iron ore freight traffic decelerated to 9 per cent in August from an average increase of 15.3 per cent during April to July 2019.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Overall traffic at major ports recovered to grow by 3.5 per cent in July 2019 after a marginal decline in May and June 2019. In July 2019, 9 out of 13 major commodities recorded a y-o-y growth in port traffic. The recovery was majorly led by petroleum, oil &amp; lubricants (POL), containerised cargo and iron ore whose combined share in total port traffic is 65 per cent. POL and containerised cargo traffic grew by 7 per cent and 6.4 per cent, respectively. Iron ore traffic recorded a y-o-y growth of 48.9 per cent in July which can be attributed to a 297.4 per cent y-o-y growth in iron ore exports in July 2019. Coal weighs 14.8 per cent in total port traffic. It reduced the impact of the recovery in overall port traffic by recording a y-o-y decline of 13.1 per cent in July 2019.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Passengers handled at airports in India recorded a y-o-y growth of 0.8 per cent in July 2019, over a high base. It followed a 4.2 per cent growth in June. The after-effects of the shutdown of Jet Airways in April 2019 seems to have subsided. Cargo handled at airports recorded a y-o-y decline of 3.2 per cent in July 2019. It has been showing a y-o-y contraction since April 2019.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Energy sector weakens  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Electricity sector showed a 5.6 per cent y-o-y increase in generation in July 2019. It is lower than the growth of 8.6 per cent in June 2019. Growth in coal based thermal electricity generation fell from 9.5 per cent in June to 6.6 per cent in July 2019. Hydro electricity showed flat growth. Coal and hydro account for around 85 per cent of total electricity generation. Nuclear sources, which form less than 5 per cent of total electricity generation, recorded a double digit y-o-y growth in July 2019 for the third time this fiscal.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Growth in consumption of petroleum products slowed to 2.8 per cent in August 2019 from 3.9 per cent in July 2019. 5 out of 11 major petroleum products recorded a y-o-y decline in consumption during August 2019. Motor spirit, which is used as fuel for vehicles, recorded a y-o-y increase in consumption of 8.9 per cent in August 2019, even as vehicle sales have been falling month after month. High speed diesel recorded a y-o-y contraction of 1.1 per cent in August 2019. This is its first y-o-y contraction after a continuous increase for 8 months. Consumption of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) continued to fall in August 2019.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;LPG consumption recorded a y-o-y increase of 13 per cent. It is for the first time that LPG consumption recorded double digit growth in this fiscal year. But, the growth in consumption of LPG during April-August 2019 was 3.6 per cent, as against a 7.4 per cent growth seen during April-August 2018.'<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'd9w7vo'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d9w7vo/september_review_of_economic_performance_cmie/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Climate change hypocrisy'<br />Body: "Many ignorant Westerners like to complain how third world countries like India are at fault for climate change. Here's the rebuttal.\n\nIndia's production of CO2 per capita is [quite low](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita) relatively. Why per capita? Because the sacrifice for protecting the planet must be equal per person, not shouldered by populous countries only.\n\nSome argue developed countries are colder, but for example, heating only accounts for [20%](https://renewableheatnow.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/NY-HVAC-2017-07-19-updated.pdf) of New York CO2 emissions residentially, and probably similar for commercial.\n\n*But that's still not complete equality.*\n\nTrue equality should look at per capita emissions since the industrial revolution began. This needs to be made equal. Those who did the damage must pay for it. Simply equalizing current per capita emissions based on global CO2 targets is biased against undeveloped countries. The current CO2 target is based on the damage already done (by few countries), but the payment for that is being spread equally among all. Why pay for something you didn't do?\n\n*But that's still not complete equality.* \n\nDue to global supply chains, a few cheap labour countries manufacture goods demanded by the whole world. Surely, everyone buying the goods should pay equally, not just the manufacturing country A, otherwise their costs will be too high to be compete with another country B who follows no such restrictions. The customers will simply switch to B's products (loss of GDP to A). But if you tax the customers directly (many in the first world), then that's fair to both A and B.\n\n**Each of these 3 adjustments increases the share of blame on developed countries. Either allow us to pollute as much as developed countries per capita, or they should learn to pollute less like us.**"<br />Author: 'papermaker007'  id: 'd9kp7x'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d9kp7x/climate_change_hypocrisy/</li>

So this would make IVC a Dwapara Yuga civilization. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga\n\n\nConventionally the Harappan cultural levels have been classified into 1) an Early Ravi Phase (~5.7–4.8\u2009ka BP), 2) Transitional Kot Diji phase (~4.8–4.6\u2009ka BP), 3) Mature phase (~4.6–3.9\u2009ka BP) and 4) Late declining (painted Grey Ware) phase (3.9–3.3\u2009ka BP13,19,20). \n\n&gt; The successive cultural levels at Bhirrana, as deciphered from archeological artefacts along with these 14C ages, are Pre-Harappan Hakra phase (~9.5–8\u2009ka BP), Early Harappan (~8–6.5\u2009ka BP), Early mature Harappan (~6.5–5\u2009ka BP) and mature Harappan (~5–2.8\u2009ka BP). \n\nNote the change of date for mature IVC. The conventional date is "~4.6–3.9\u2009ka BP". This is interesting because Steppe people are supposed to have brought a new culture after the decline of mature IVC. So if it declined later than thought before, either the migrations happened later than thought (but that is not possible since evidence for mixing exists from 1500 BC onwards) or they didn\'t really change the culture until 2.8 ka BP. But by Vedic culture is already existing from at least 3.5 ka BP. So did they really bring Vedic culture? Hopefully, an expert can explain whether this is right.'<br />Author: 'papermaker007'  id: 'd8ncm0'<br />Score:31<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d8ncm0/indus_valley_civilisation_may_predate_egypts/</li>
