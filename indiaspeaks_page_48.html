I think it is wrong in some way. \n\nThe middle class always wanted to see some good movies, but the lower class/non working class always had the resource called time. Nowadays with high ticket prices , the one who had time are now no more going to movies as much as they could afford earlier. (I have been to a theater for 10 rs in 90's. Still very less compared to 400 we spend today. \n\nSo its now working/striving class who are going to movies and they choose what they want to watch. In this case, the viewers are now filtered and the frivolous crowds are away.\n\nBeing from Jharkhand (earstwhile Bihar) it was very difficult to go to watch movies if you are not with group of friends / if you are with female.\n\nThe whole scenario was a chaos. eve teasing and fights were common in movie theatres. Going to movies was a exhilariting experience for first timers, but for us it was excruciating. \n\nNow the things have changed for good, decent people go to movie theatres and women are relatively safer, likewise violence has reduced.\n\nAlthough we can be sad about rising prices of popcorn , but I cant deny that it is a price we are paying for a good experience.\n\nAlso I am proud that many of us would agree that vicky kaushal, pankaj tripathy, ayushmaan , manoj vajpai are greater actors and they would have never made it in 80's n 90's era.\n\nSimilarly, netflix came and it brought us the flabbergasting realization that star plus wouldnt rule our lives forever.I am relieved, and I can see better future tomorrow. Today it costs me 200rs per month more, but I can see more quality contents than compared to earlier.(I avoid Indian netflix series due to its strong communal motive), Documentaries are good.\n\nEarlier I used to pirate but now I feel like paying for every good stuff we watch. Also I am so happy that I watch meaningful Malayali/Marathi/Tamil movies which would have been impossible back those days.\n\nThe entertaintment industry is being organized, it became expensive, but it became better.\n\nWe used to see high amount of B grade stuff earlier be it Set max/ Star plus or local movie theatre, but now we are getting better choices.\n\nBut all that glitters is not gold. The Indian audeince that flooded the cinema halls are still there.They just dont frequent the halls as much as they used to. Dont believe me? Open T series and see the most viewed videos,  My man Sal man is still there.\n\nMoney really brings hapiness"<br />Author: 'me_lucky_lips'  id: 'd863z3'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d863z3/unpopular_thought_about_indian_audience/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'India should allow Dual-citizenship(with some restrictions). Not allowing it is causing a huge loss.'<br />Body: "The 50k people you saw in yesterday's event in Houston are all Americans who pay taxes to America and live there. They will never even consider returning to India and settling hereafter retirement because they are now fully Americans and it is difficult to again become Indian, that too by losing American citizenship.\n\nSo, we are losing out on both highly skilled people and their money. Most people would prefer to be a dual-citizen as this gives them more options, but they give up Indian citizenship forcefully as India doesn't allow a person to hold Indian citizenship along with other country's citizenship. This was initially done to prevent someone from being both Indian and Pakistani at the same time during partition I think.\n\nSo, maybe we can allow dual-citizenship with a clause saying this person cannot run elections in India, join the Indian military or get administrative government jobs in India."<br />Author: 'Fdsn'  id: 'd85a05'<br />Score:32<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d85a05/india_should_allow_dualcitizenshipwith_some/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Reminder that Democrats foreign policy has always sided with Pakistan and been anti India'<br />Body: "Reproducing a comment of mine\n\nHillary was always ANTI India. The current crop of Democrats from Sanders down to RO Khanna are virulent India haters. \n\nThe pivot towards Pakistan started under LBJ, his administration explicitly wanted a weaker India. \n\nThe R Nixon then continued this policy. \n\nCarter famously threatened to sanction us if we continued our nuclear experiments and even signed a presidential order banning export of fisile material to us. \n\nCarter also started Op Cyclone that completely deprioritsed India over Pakistan. \n\nIt was Reagan who righted this keel (again it needed a Republican), they provided increased aid, military equipment, even high tech gas turbines for our indigenous vessels. \n\nDubya SR then took it to the next level (relative to what it was then), he pushed for the DTAA, approved sale of high speed computers for our space program, when a GoI entity took over a US firm operational in India, he purposely stayed away from intervention. \n\nThen came Clinton and his post Pokhran sanctions, \n\nIt was a R, Dubya who again thawed it out. \n\nHe did ban Modi from entry but Obama continued the policy and used the USCIRF to vehemently attack Modi and India. \n\nDubya also pushed the landmark Nuclear treaty. \n\nHillary and her pal Huma Abedin were and are virulently anti India. Under her advise Obama pumped in billions of $ into Pakiland as aid while it is Trump who has been cutting it. \n\nHillary hated India so much that on her first tour to Asia as a secy of state, she skipped India purposely. \n\nObama hyphenated Kashmir with Pakistan unequivocally. Obama restricted H1B visas. The first POTUS to do so. \n\nHis choice of Ambassador to Delhi was Roemer, a strident advocate of the US negotiating a settlement on Kashmir which has gone against India's bilateral stand since the Shimla agreement. \n\nIn the meantime, Obama gave out\n\n* $ 7.5bn in aid to Pakistan in Oct 09,\n* $3.5bn in 2010\n* $3.5bn in 2011\n\nWhen the Republicans wanted to block aid to Pakistan in 2016, Obama fought tooth and nail against it. \n\nBill BJ Clinton bollocks - \n\nBill BJ Clinton applied the super 301 clause choking many industries. \n\nReagan approved sale of Cray Super computers and guess she Bill BJ Clinton did? Block them. \n\nAl Gore called Punjab, Khalistan\n\n\n\nRobin Rapahel a known India hater and Paki lover held a lot of power in the Dept of State. The is when the latest block 52 (iirc) fighters were offered to Pakiland. \n\nBush imposed the Pressler amendment on Pakiland that Rapahel helped repeal allowing full flow of arms and funds to Pakiland. \n\nBush had blocked monies paid for F16's which BJ Clinton refunded in full. \n\nRobin in her official capacity as Asst Secy of state literally questioned the Instrument of Accession and said India had to hold a plebiscite. \n\nClinton followed suit and raised this issue in the UN. \n\nPost the 93 Mumbai blasts, Republicans wanted Pakistan declared a state sponsor of terror. Rapahel convinced her boss BJ Clinton to stand down. \n\nClinton totally ignored these blasts then. \n\nRapahel and the Clinton administration insisted that India had to talk with Kashmiri terrorists! \n\nRapahel and her boss helped overtly and covertly the creation of the Hurriyat conference AND later insisted Delhi include this body in all negotiations. \n\nBJ Clinton's term 2 was no different. His sexy of state, Albright hated India, wanted a plebiscite in Kashmir, supported Pakistan openly and was a turd to Indian interests while supporting Paki ones. \n\nIt was Bill Clinton that set up the shitty USCIRF (that had reps from all faiths but Hinduism, not sure if it is any different now) and used it to beat India. \n\nFun bonus - Joe Biden sponsored a law in 1991 that promised aid to Russia IF it stopped the sale of cryogenic engines to India. \n\nSo yeah, you should stop your theoritical garbage and realize that every Democrat president after Kennedy has been anti India, anti Hindu and pro Pakistan and pro Jihad."<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'd846dg'<br />Score:225<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d846dg/reminder_that_democrats_foreign_policy_has_always/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Gulalai Ismail flees Pakistan, Greta Thurnberg reaches the US, and the Cultural Revolution'<br />Body: 'Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Geopolitics Thread - making a return after a month-long hiatus (sorry, I\'ve been very busy!). Here, we can discuss big events from around the world - topics do not have to be related to India. Here are some top stories to get the discussion going:\n\n# Top 3 stories from India\'s neighbourhood\n\n1. [Saudi oil facilities hit by drone strike](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/21/irans-warnings-to-saudi-arabia-are-laughable-saudis-al-jubeir-says.html)\n\nIn a shocking incident that led to a spike in crude oil prices, drones and missiles were used to hit two key oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, which led to half the country\'s crude oil production being shut down. Yemeni rebels claimed responsibility as revenge for the kingdom\'s war against them, but Saudi Arabia and the US blamed Iran for the attack. US President Donald Trump ordered oil to be released from the US\'s strategic reserves to calm prices, and has moved US troops into Saudi Arabia on their request. Meanwhile, Iran\'s foreign minister brushed off the allegations and said that Iran had nothing to do with the attacks.\n\n2.  [Gulalai Ismail flees Pakistan to seek asylum in the US](https://www.foxnews.com/world/pakistani-activist-flees-to-us)\n\nPakistani human rights activist Gulalai Ismail, after spending months on the run, has resurfaced in New York City and is seeking political asylum there. Ismail has been an outspoken critic of the Pakistani Army\'s operations in the former Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA) as well as their efforts to subvert a peaceful Pashtun movement against the army. She has made several allegations of rape and murder of women, which led to many cases being filed against her for treason and incitement to violence. The 32-year old has also been arrested several times and has alleged torture as well. She is on an exit control list, but managed to flee the country through other channels.\n\n3. [China begins another massive clampdown on Muslims and Islam](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=12269870)\n\nAs a video surfaced online, allegedly showing Uyghur Muslims in chains and blindfolds being marched into trains to be moved into concentration camps in China\'s Xinjiang province, China\'s latest clampdown on Islam and Muslims has returned to the focus. Stories have also emerged of Chinese authorities putting up posters disparaging Islam ([like this one](https://twitter.com/cjwerleman/status/1173630070356729856)) and banning the \'halal\' label in stores and restaurants. All this comes a few months after several Islamic nations, including Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, extended support to China for its \'human rights efforts\' in the region.\n\n# Top 3 stories from the world\n\n1. [UK govt collapses as Brexit deadline looms](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49630094)\n\nUK PM Boris Johnson\'s nascent government collapsed over his attempts to leave the EU without a trade deal, which could be potentially catastrophic for the economy and also renew turmoil on the Irish border. However, in the UK, only Parliament can call for a new election, and Johnson\'s attempts to get them to do so have failed twice as members of his own party (including his brother) have defected and voted against the proposal. Now, the battle has moved to the UK Supreme Court in what is becoming the biggest political mess in the country in centuries. \n\n2. [Greta Thurnberg addresses US Congressional hearing](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/09/18/greta-thunberg-climate-change-testifies-congress/2357930001/)\n\nTeenage Swedish climate activist Greta Thurnberg testified before a US Congressional hearing on Climate Change, calling for immediate action to save the future of her generation. In the process, she painted a dark picture of her generation, who see no future for themselves and their planet. She led a global \'strike\' against Climate Change that saw thousands of students walking out of school around the world. She met former US President Barack Obama and will address a UN climate conference as well. She is 16.\n\n3. [New whistleblower controversy erupts around Donald Trump](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/09/22/donald-trump-joe-biden-ukraine-whistleblower-standoff-explained/2388648001/)\n\nUS President Donald Trump finds himself in a new controversy, this time around his alleged attempts to have Democratic front-runner and former VP Joe Biden investigated for his son\'s alleged corruption deals in Ukraine. It is alleged that there is a secret whistleblower complaint about a phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian President, where the former asked to investigate Biden to supposedly discredit him in the US elections. Several Democratic lawmakers have rallied to protect the whistleblower, whose identity remains a secret, and has led to renewed calls to impeach Trump. The President has dismissed the allegations as fake news. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The Cultural Revolution\n\nIn the last edition of Geopolitical History, we learned about the Great Leap Forward, Mao Zedong\'s disastrous economic program that shrank China\'s economy and killed 30 million people. After that program, Mao was sidelined within the Communist Party as more moderate leaders moved to repair the damage. But Mao would not be kept aside for too long: within five years, he launched the Cultural Revolution to take back control of the party and reshape China in his image. \n\nIn May 1966, Mao called upon young people in China to rise up in arms and overthrow state institutions to take back the country from what he alleged were revisionists who had crept into the Party - in reality, he was targeting those leaders who had pushed him aside after the Great Leap Forward. In response, youth formed Red Guards (armed militias directly beholden to Mao). Revolution was in the air - revolution against anything. Temples and historical artifacts were destroyed, traditional arts and music were attacked, teachers and intellectuals were sent to rural areas and publicly humiliated, factory workers went on strike against their management, government workers revolted against their superiors. Mao called for change: the target eventually became to destroy the "Four Olds" (customs, culture, habits, and ideas) and replace them with "Mao Thought" (aka Maoism). \n\nIn this orgy of violence and revolution, Mao was aided by Lin Biao, head of the Communist Party\'s armed wing, the People\'s Liberation Army (PLA). Leaders who had challenged Mao, most notably Deng Xiaoping, were pushed aside and exiled. Particularly brutal was the treatment of ethnic minorities in China: Muslim minorities in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia faced persecution and their mosques were attacked, while Tibetans faced the destruction of over 6,000 monasteries. The police were ordered to give the Red Guard a free hand, and Mao personally felicitated them by wearing a red arm band in the heart of Beijing. Lin Biao was selected as Mao\'s successor and his name was written into the Party\'s  (and country\'s) Constitution. Mao had risen again, backed solidly by the PLA.\n\nOr so it seemed. In 1969, tensions were high between China and the Soviet Union, which had parted ways some years ago on China\'s refusal to become a Soviet vassal state. Marshal Biao issued an executive order to prepare for war, without consulting Mao. In Mao\'s eyes, this was the first hint that Biao would not wait for Mao to die, but would seize power through a military coup. Conspiracies raged, and Mao eventually turned on his chosen successor and, as per the official story, forced him to flee to the Soviet Union to seek asylum. However, Biao\'s plane crashed in Inner Mongolia, killing him and once again opening up the succession question. \n\nBy this time, the economy had begun crashing again, and it became necessary to rehabilitate many of those who had been pushed aside by the Cultural Revolution. One of them was Deng Xiaoping, who became Vice-Premier in March 1973. He went on to wrest control of the Party and the PLA, and after Mao\'s death, purged the party of those who rose through the Cultural Revolution. Deng went on to open up China\'s economy to the outside world, and set the stage for the Chinese economic miracle. \n\nThe Cultural Revolution\'s death toll varies: 400,000 people is seen as a conservative lower estimate, while a higher estimate puts it at 3 million.  By 1981, the Party under him declared that the Cultural Revolution was  "responsible for the most severe setback and the heaviest losses suffered by the Party, the country, and the people since the founding of the People\'s Republic". It was the last bloody revolution based on Maoist ideology. Well, the last one in China anyway. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat stories caught your attention?\n\n वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्'<br />Author: 'icecoolsushobhan'  id: 'd7vhyj'<br />Score:58<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d7vhyj/biweekly_geopolitics_thread_gulalai_ismail_flees/</li>

Mughal as well as Rajput sources tell us that Shivaji was a Rajput-phile, he used to dress like Rajputs, eat like Rajputs, used to follow culture and customs of Rajputs such as Devi Worship, things like this were not as famous as Rajputana Region during those times.\n3. Muslim as well as Hindu Dynasties since 7th century used to invite large number of North Indian,Arab, Central Asian warriors and horse breeders as both of these were considered superior to what natives in those lands had so its not surprising that during Late medieval period large number of Rajput kings and tribes as well as Afghans migrated to Maharashtra and Deccan.\n4. please note that Large number of Rajput tribes such as Solankis of Rajasthan-Gujarat, Kilji Turks of Malwa, Parmars, Yusufzais and Afridis migrated to south in serch of better opportunities and Sisodiya Clan lives in Southern Rajputana/Malwa/Gujarat region so its highly likely that his some great grand father was a Sisodiya Rajput.\n5. Muslim Sultans were very racist towards desi muslims and their turkic nobles used to produce articals that can put even manusmriti to shame, its highly unlikely that such an important post and land was granted to some "Sudra" when entire Deccan was filled with number of Warrior clans who were migrating at constant rate for employment.\n\nplease dont drag religion or any other things here, post your own counter arguments if you  have studied history of Indian Clans, Tribes and castes of that time period.'<br />Author: 'Vishwamitr'  id: 'd7dckn'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d7dckn/in_my_opinion_shivajis_claim_being_a_rajput_was/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Why are NBFCs allowed to operate in India under such lax rules?'<br />Body: 'So I was reading into the Dewan Housing crisis, and I was surprised at such shoddy regulations.\n\n [https://scroll.in/article/926444/scroll-explainer-what-happened-to-finance-firm-dhfl-and-what-that-means-for-the-indian-economy](https://scroll.in/article/926444/scroll-explainer-what-happened-to-finance-firm-dhfl-and-what-that-means-for-the-indian-economy) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n&gt;What happened at DHFL?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;DHFL is a non-banking financial company, also known as a shadow bank. **This means it doesn’t have a banking licence or access to central bank liquidity, but is nevertheless involved in financial services** – in this case, primarily giving loans to home buyers in India’s tier 2 and tier 3 cities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In 2018, another major NBFC, IL&amp;FS, went bust, causing alarm bells to ring throughout the industry. Banks became much more careful about lending money to NBFCs. But this led to a liquidity crunch, since there was limited access to credit. **Many NBFCs rely on** [**short-term borrowing to finance long-term lending**](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/dhfls-shadow-looms-over-real-estate-and-auto-5770415/)**, which puts them in a difficult spot when there is a liquidity crunch.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In September 2018, after the IL&amp;FS crisis emerged, DHFL’s stock also took a hammering, [by as much as 60%](https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/nbfcs-crash-here-s-why-dhfl-tanked-over-60-in-trade-today-118092100479_1.html). Then, in January, *Cobrapost* claimed that the company’s promoters were involved in a [Rs 31,000 crore scam to siphon off money](https://scroll.in/latest/911283/promoters-of-dewan-housing-finance-involved-in-rs-31000-crore-scam-alleges-cobrapost). The company denied these claims and later said that a[n independent chartered accountant’s inquiry found them to be untrue](https://www.ndtv.com/business/dhfl-share-price-dhfl-surges-after-independent-ca-firms-report-on-cobrapost-allegations-2003518).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;DHFL has insisted that the underlying assets that it holds, a big chunk of which are house loans, are valuable and have a very low non-performing asset percentage. **But those underlying assets are worth about Rs 1 lakh crore. As a consequence, if this is indeed a solvency issue, if the company’s survival itself is uncertain, it could be a huge blow to India’s financial markets**. This will lead to further panic – and tighter liquidity – across the system.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If the company fails, that will affect all of those that have extended credit to the company. T**hat includes about Rs 50,000 crore from banks, another Rs 30,000 crore from the Life Insurance Corporation, pension funds and more**. In other words, this isn’t about just one company failing: it is a danger to the already-beleaguered banking system.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;One sector has already been affected: mutual funds, which allow investors to put their money into a selection of stocks as picked by a fund manager. Indian regulations mean that once payments have missed their due date, ratings agencies have to move immediately to change the rating of the company, in this case move DHFL down to “D”. Subsequently, mutual fund companies have to immediately follow suit, and mark down all DHFL debt 75%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That means that, if a mutual fund owns DHFL debt – [even if it is not the bonds that the company was unable to pay in time](https://www.capitalmind.in/2019/06/abeyaar-what-is-this-dhfl-default-and-debt-mutual-funds-crashing/) – it has to be marked down 75%. UTI Mutual Fund, for example, which [owns a large amount of DHFL paper](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/these-two-fund-houses-alone-have-56-exposure-to-dhfl-debt/articleshow/69700830.cms) has written down [all of that debt completely,](https://www.financialexpress.com/market/uti-mutual-fund-marks-down-its-debt-exposure-to-dhfl-to-100/1601302/) meaning it doesn’t expect to get anything back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo how do these NBFCs lend lakhs of crores without adhering to the strict regulations which commercial banks adhere to?

Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), as measured by the survey was **Rs 3.31 lakh crore in 2017-18, compared with Rs 3.69 lakh crore in 2016-17**. “This is no surprise. The investment rate has been falling as is shown in the national accounts,” said Pronab Sen, former chief statistician. \n\n *Statistically it measures the value of acquisitions of new or existing* [*fixed assets*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_assets) *by the business sector, governments and "pure" households (excluding their unincorporated enterprises) less disposals of fixed assets.* ***GFCF is a component of the expenditure on*** [***gross domestic product***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product) ***(GDP), and thus shows something about how much of the new*** [***value added***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_added) ***in the economy is invested rather than consumed.*** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. While there was a **1.2% rise in the number of factories** in 2017-18, the number of **workers rose 4.8% to 12.2 million from 11.6 million in 2016-17**. The survey was conducted during November 2018 to June 2019 through ASI Web Portal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. The government was set a target of raising manufacturing share in GDP to 25% by FY22 from around 17% now through the ambitious ‘Make in India’ programme. According to the national accounts, **GFCF for the same period for the entire economy rose to Rs 49 lakh crore in FY18 from Rs 43.3 lakh crore** the year ago in terms of current prices.   \n\n\n*This means manufacturing got a small amount of this pie.*\n\n  \n 4. The same data also showed that interest paid in **2017-18 declined 0.9%** but r**ent payout rose 9.3%, a dampener on fresh investments**. \n\n5.

But the next generation isn't being taught either native language or hindi, only English. \n\nAfter some generation, will India too become English speaking nation with people who don't understand or speak hindi or their native regional language?

A professor of History from Madras Christian College, S Krishnawamy, was to get the manuscript ready.\n\nThe manuscript was believed to be misinterpreting historical facts and it was believed that the whole exercise of planting the time capsule was Gandhi’s way of exalting her and her father JLN's stature while simultaneously undermining efforts of other leaders in nation building.\n\nThe capsule was finally dug out by Janata Party government in 1977.

Rohingyas, who are people from the Rakhine state of Myanmar, were forced out by the Myanmarese forces in retaliation to the attacks assailed by the Rohingyas militants. Although the exodus of the Rohingyas dates back to 1990s. The recent so-called genocide of Rohingyas was in 2016 where they had to abscond and cross borders towards Bangladesh. The Rohingyas are considered immigrants in Myanmar which aptly they are.  \n\n\nNow, The problem of Rohingyas related to India is that there are 40,000 Rohingyas 17,000 of which are recognized by the UNHCR and the current Indian government is very anxious to banish them of the Indian soil and rightfully so that is what the majority of the country is expecting of them. Because not just Rohingyas are a burden on our economy and increasing population density. There have been corroborations of a link of some Rohingyan leaders with the terrorist groups such as JeM and ISIS.  \n\n\nBut for the lack of a good reason for Rohingyans to be given asylum, the leftist funded media is trying to give it a tone of religious-nationalist fervor. There is a cruel aestheticism by print media to celebrate an audacious evil for its audacity and mundane good is contempt because it is mundane. Adding to that is the UNHCR which is giving an undeniable whiff of notoriousness by speaking against the majority leaders of our country. I think it is going to be profoundly challenging to deal with Rohingyas as they creep into our territories.   \n\n\nThe opposition's (or whatever is left of it ) desperation writ large in their acts to win over the minority Muslim vote and develop a new vote bank through Rohingyas. And in this desperate act, they have already influx 40,000 Rohingyans. Now, the ruling government has passed a decree to do away with 19,000 of them but of course, the opposition has tried their best to thwart the decision. And this propaganda machinery of the opposition is what will be the reason for our country's development's slowdown."<br />Author: 'shubham2611199418'  id: 'd4mec2'<br />Score:54<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d4mec2/rohingyas_and_the_facade_around_it/</li>

Apart from contributing Rs 10,000 crore to complete construction of unfinished projects in affordable and middle income category housing, the FM announced relaxation of ECB guidelines for the affordable housing. By easing the financing for the home buyers, the government has paved the way for faster sale and possession of the projects. This will surely speed up the process of reaching the \'Housing for All\' target."\n\n**Dhiraj Jain, Director, Mahagun Group**, "The biggest relief came in the garb of last mile funding where projects that are 60% complete will get funding through special window. It is expected that around 3.5 lakh stuck units will benefit from the decision. With this support from the government the market will become more potent and many buyers will get the possession of their homes soon. Additionally, many unsold units of these stuck projects will come in the market opening an options galore for the property seekers. We welcome the FM for taking such a decision that is going affect so many lives and ease out the burden of real estate sector."\n\n**Pradeep Aggarwal, Co-Founder &amp; Chairman, Signature Global and Chairman - ASSOCHAM National Council on Real Estate, Housing and Urban Development**, "The latest announcement by Hon\'ble Finance Minister of establishing a special window will go a long way in helping affordable and mid-income housing. The move will ensure that mid-income and affordable income  projects that are 60% complete and are non-NPA and non-NCLT, will witness faster completion thereby benefiting the buyers. It will also help the Government in achieving its objective of \'Housing for All by 2022\'.\nToday\'s announcements also indicate as Government\'s effort of boosting the affordable housing as it had also announced  in the budget an additional deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh for interest paid on home loans borrowed up to March 31, 2020 for purchase of house valued up to Rs 45 lakh. This s going to help increase the sale of affordable housing in tier II and tier III cities."\n\n**Mohit Goel, CEO, Omaxe Ltd**, "Finance Minister’s announcement of setting up special window of Rs 10,000 crore for projects, which are 60% complete and are non-NPA and non-NCLT, is likely to ensure speedy delivery of projects. Needless to say, the measures will play a pivotal role in enhancing the confidence of home buyers in the real estate sector.\nMoreover, the prevailing yield on 10 year T-bills is hovering around 6.6-6.7%. The Government decision to link House Building Advance to it effectively means reduction of interest rate for government employees, which constitute the biggest chunk of home buyers. This also augurs well for the sector ahead of festive season."\n\n**Manoj Gaur, MD, Gaurs Group &amp; Chairman, Affordable Housing Committee, CREDAI**, "Announcements by Hon\'ble FM to boost housing sector is indeed welcome. Several mid-income and affordable housing projects which are witnessing slow progress due to lack of funds, will be expedited as the result of setting up of special window having a corpus of Rs 10,000 crore. It should help faster delivery of close to 3 - 3.5 dwelling units. The fact that the special window will be managed and monitored by professionals from housing and banking sector is another step in right direction. Also, govt decision to link housing building advance with yield on 10-year T-bill is likely to reduce effective interest rate for government employees, which should encourage them to buy new homes. Relaxation of ECB norms for affordable housing should also boost housing demand as the cost of funds will reduce for HFCs as a result of the move."\n\n**Mr. Mahesh Singhi, Founder &amp; MD, Singhi Advisors.** “FM Sitharaman has made a series of announcements to redress consumer concerns and kickstart the investment cycle in the economy with a specific focus on the revival of real estate and boosting the export competitiveness of the country. The roll-out of the special funding window for affordable housing reiterates the government’s commitment to provide low cost funding to home buyers in the lower and middle income housing segment. The announcement of an automated e-assessment system and the complete removal of human interference will lead to improved tax compliance measures and with the assessment unit remaining anonymous, instances of taxpayer harassment will be significantly reduced. The deployment of a fully electronic refund module for automated refunds of Input Tax Credit will accelerate the processing of refunds and place higher capital at the disposal of traders and businessmen.”\n\n**S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP Securities** says, "Measures to Boost Housing is a positive for Mortgage Companies in our view. Special Window to provide the much needed last mile funding for Housing Projects which are non-NPA and non-NCLT would also enable completion of unfinished homes. Moreover the relaxation of ECB guidelines for Affordable Housing including interest rates on house building advance is a good step. Exporters in labour intensive sectors should be happy with the new RODTEP scheme from 01-01-2020 as it proposes to more than adequately incentivise exporters. Speedy ITC refunds and higher insurance cover for exporters should help in our view".\n\n[Source](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/live-nirmala-sitharaman-to-address-media-announce-relief-measures-for-economy-slowdown-4436101.html).'<br />Author: 'Mumbaikarsevak'  id: 'd4flxk'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d4flxk/opinions_of_various_people_from_real_estate/</li>

Why is he so against right wing then, does it not have the same inclusive right to flourish like all other ideals? By distancing himself with right wing hindutva, Tharoor is going against his own inclusiveness principle which accommodates for all ideals and doesn\'t reject any of them.\n\nI\'d also like to ask that if his inclusiveness way really works, then why couldn\'t they prevent the partition in 1947?

More than 60% of irrigated agriculture and 85% of drinking water supplies are dependent on groundwater."<br />Body: '* If current trends continue, in 20 years about 60% of all India’s aquifers will be in a critical condition.\n* India is the largest user of  groundwater in the world. It uses an estimated 230 cubic kilometers of  groundwater per year - over a quarter of the global total.\n* More than 60% of irrigated agriculture and 85% of drinking water supplies are dependent on groundwater.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really hope the new Jal Shakti Ministry sees all these and the concerned people are already drawing measures or there are plans to bring about a change to this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Key Issues**\n\nIndia is the largest user of groundwater in the world. It uses an  estimated 230 cubic kilometers of groundwater per year - over a quarter  of the global total.\n\nMore than 60% of irrigated agriculture and 85% of drinking water  supplies are dependent on groundwater. Urban residents increasingly rely  on groundwater due to unreliable and inadequate municipal water  supplies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Farming:**\n\nFor example, a rainfall deficit in 1963-66 decreased India’s  food production by 20% but a similar drought in 1987-88 had very small  impact on food production largely due to the widespread use of  groundwater by that time.\n\nFarms irrigated with groundwater have twice the crop water  productivity of those that rely on surface-water alone. This is largely  because the resource allows farmers greater control over when to  irrigate their fields and how much water to use each time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Depleting aquifers**\n\nDespite the valuable nature of the resource, 29% of groundwater  blocks are semi-critical, critical, or overexploited, and the situation  is deteriorating rapidly (2004 nationwide assessment.) Moreover,  aquifers are depleting in the most populated and economically productive  areas. Climate change will further strain groundwater resources.\n\nThis will have serious implications for the sustainability of  agriculture, long-term food security, livelihoods, and economic growth.  It is estimated that over a quarter of the country’s harvest will be at  risk.\n\nIndia has both hard-rock and alluvial aquifers which differ  considerably in their physical and socioeconomic profiles and require  very different sets of solutions at both the macro and micro levels. As  global experience offers few comparable models, home grown solutions are  needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Community Management which was present in Ancient India is now dead**\n\nWorld Bank is telling us the same thing that we had ourselves implemented several years ago and which was part of our culture.\n\nTake for example a temple complex, any major or minor temple in rural , semir rural or any area had a Kalyani or a small tank multiple this with the amount of temples there are in a given area.\n\nAnd what are the state of these Kalyanis today, they are either dead or a place for dumping garbage or it has been encroached.\n\nCommunity management of ground water wherein the user community is the  primary custodian of the resource and is charged with implementing  management measures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Andhra Model**\n\nThe report showcases a model adopted in the drought-prone areas of  the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The state has produced the first  global example of large scale success in self-regulation of groundwater  use. At the cost of US$2,200 per village per year, communities have  shown the first large-scale example of self-regulation of groundwater.  Farmers have doubled their income, while bringing their groundwater use  close to sustainable levels. In many cases, farmers have voluntarily  reduced their water use, while continuing to safeguard their crops.\n\nAn exceptional program of farmer education which has created  \\`barefoot hydrogeologists’ has made this change in water use possible.  The approach is immediately replicable in other hard-rock areas (mostly  in peninsular India) which account for two-third of groundwater settings  in India. Other similar measures can be taken up immediately.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope each and everyone of us, thinks of water as god and treats it sacredly. The people who could afford could look at their homes and think of water harvesting systems.\n\nTell us your stories of what you have done already for water conservation or rain water harvesting or what you have already planned or planning to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Sources:***\n\n[***https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2012/03/06/india-groundwater-critical-diminishing***](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2012/03/06/india-groundwater-critical-diminishing)'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'd3tnpq'<br />Score:74<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d3tnpq/story_of_indias_ground_water_at_260_cubic_km_per/</li>

No matter how small or what is the issue with your phone, just make sure to backup and format your phone before giving to their (or any for that matter) service centre.\n\nLong story: So I went to Mobile Connect which is the only offical Nokia service centre in Chandigarh to fix my phone (Nokia 6.1 Plus) charging port today. \n\nThe receptionist first told me that it would take about 10 days for the replacement unit to arrive and to detect the issue it will take about 30 mins. She then handed me a paper to sign and asked me to remove the phone lock and hand it over to her.\n\nThe naive me trusted her and didn\'t take my phone backup as I thought it\'s just a charging port hardware issue and they won\'t be doing any software changes. I had even asked her to confirm this and she said they won\'t be making any software changes. It simply didn\'t occur to me that how could she even ask me to remove my phone lock when there\'s no software issue? \n\nAnyway, then she quickly gave it to the technicians at the back cabin. After patiently waiting for about 10 min they inform me that it will take about 2 hours to fix it. I refused to wait as I came there during my office lunch break and I had to go back to my office in Mohali asap. They simply refused to give me my phone back and kept iterating that my phone comes under warranty and they can\'t give it back to me just like that as they have already disassembled it. I requested them to give it back but they didn\'t listen. I even offered them to take 100Rs fees from me if they want, they didn\'t accept. It was so fishy and strange why were they so reluctant to give me my phone back? \n\nThey had basically hijacked my phone. And probably were happy to "fix" my phone for free as they had now full access to my all personal data. They asked me to come back after 2 hours. \n\nSo I went back to office and changed my google accounts passwords just to be safe. When I came back to collect it, they gave me some other handset which was dark blue variant of my phone model. I gave it back and told them to give me my phone back (black variant). After couple of minutes they gave me my phone back and didn\'t even fucking apologized for this serious blunder. Anyway, I got my phone, lo and behold, they had formatted my phone completely! I was so pissed and shouted at them but it seems it\'s very common incident there as they were not really bothered about it. There was one more lady there who faced the same issue and they had formatted her phone as well. I told the lady that these bastards have fooled us by copying (and then clearing) all our personal data and probably sold it in black market. \n\nI have now raised the issue to Nokia. They are bloody scammers. Never buying a Nokia phone again in my life.\n\n/end rant'<br />Author: 'ganesh2shiv'  id: 'd3l4va'<br />Score:36<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d3l4va/psa_backup_and_format_your_phone_before_giving_it/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Why should Indian women be right wing?'<br />Body: 'I\'ve been watching a lot of videos and listening to a lot of right wing podcasts, and as a woman, I notice it\'s very male dominated, and none of them are able to articulate why women should support right wing anything.\n\nThe best argument anyone comes up with is \'if not for us, you\'re going to be a baby machine for ISIS\'.\n\nNow when I\'m far away in America, it\'s easy for me to be like "yes we should preserve our culture", but when I lived in India, I hated all mention of \'culture\'. A few samples:\n\n* Female relatives in abusive marriages just couldn\'t divorce or find any way out. \n\n* Some members of my family followed very strict exclusion rules for women on their period. It was some shitty kind of untouchability. That crap does a number on your mind. \n\n* Sexual harassment was just something you put up with. Victim blaming was par for the course. Professors at college would just sexually harass female students if they were alone with them for even a minute and it didn\'t even occur to us to complain. It was just \'he\'s a man, why do you be alone around him?\'\n\n* Oh the pressure of arranged marriage. My parents raised me no differently than a son, but when the topic of marriage came about, they just lost their minds. \n\n* Don\'t even get me started on joint families. I grew up in one. It is terrible for women. And it was even worse in my grandmother\'s generation. Shit like the mother in law giving all the daughters in law new names, women having to eat only the leftovers after the men finished eating, wife beating, and I\'m only getting started.\n\nI can go on, but no matter what people say about \'oh in ancient India, women had equal rights, menstrual blood was supposed to have magical properties\'.... But for most Indians, Indian culture means a submissive wife and mother endlessly sacrificing herself for her family, and any deviation from this means a breach of culture. \n\nPlus a lot of the people who espouse right wing views, including the most liberal feminist seeming ones talk shit about Western feminism not being applicable in India, or even that it\'s ruining Indian culture. But they refuse to really explain why Indian women should reject it. If anything, it\'s given me the freedom to dress how I choose, freedom to be educated, to choose my partner, and to have a career. Things that are still not a reality for a lot of women.\n\nAnyway my point is, while I appreciate Indian history and culture and all that now when I don\'t face my rights being taken away, a lot of times it seems like some weird kind of Sophie\'s choice where I\'ve to pick who gets to take away my rights. \n\nGiven this, it looks like Indian right wing men are doing diddly squat to even try getting women on board their ideas. Yes there\'s some women who are virulently right wing, but there\'s also women who are virulently ISIS. Everyone likes to talk about how there\'s a culture war or whatever, but don\'t care about taking half the population along with them. \n\nAnyway that\'s my very long rant. If you want to respond with \'Acshually prostrating yourself on the floor is good for a woman\'s health\' and \'it\'s all because of Islamic conquest\', please don\'t bother, that stuff was 300 years ago and if I wanted that, I\'d go talk to my grandfather.'<br />Author: 'sensitiveinfomax'  id: 'd34gqx'<br />Score:58<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d34gqx/why_should_indian_women_be_right_wing/</li>

The norm for human design is to be conceived either male or female. Human sexuality is binary by design with the obvious purpose being the reproduction and flourishing of our species. This principle is self-evident. The exceedingly rare disorders of sex development (DSDs), including but not limited to testicular feminization and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, are all medically identifiable deviations from the sexual binary norm, and are rightly recognized as disorders of human design. Individuals with DSDs (also referred to as “intersex”) do not constitute a third sex. \n\nHermaphrodites aren't any kind of new gender. \n\n \n\n&gt;\n[From MRI scans it has been revealed that men has 6.5 times of gray matters compared to Female &amp; for female the White mater is 10 times more compared to men. Now what that has to do with transgenders: Well from autopsy &amp; MRI scans it has come up that for transgenders (F-M or M-F) THE RATIO OF GM:WM is the same to what gender they identify as. This is not faux science. It is a peer reviewed article that has been published on Journal of psychiatric research with a citation index of 84](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022395610001585)\n\nDon't encourage mental illness. Gender Dysphoria needs treatment. Don't jump into that rabbit hole that western society are drowning in. \n\nIf you are well accustomed with the transgender movement in west then you will know that they are now trying to make pedophilia a new social &amp; cultural norm.

Sure any hate crime in India is bad but only one particular type of hate crime (where Muslims are victims) are talked about and so many more in our neighbouring countries are ignored. Many of you might not know but treatment of minorities is horrible in Bangladesh. Their homes get torched and lynchings are much more common.\n\nThis selective propaganda has been making me furious and I cut myself from internet for almost about a month just to watch less of this.

      <li>Title::: 'Keep in mind, Auto factory dispatches and retail sales data are different metrics'<br />Body: 'What you see reported in media are factory dispatches (cars sent from factory and bought by dealers) since those numbers are available from 1st of the next month onwards and are released by manufacturers.\n\nHowever, a week later the retail sales (the actual numbers of cars bought and registered) are announced, but that is usually not given much attention, since usually both the set of numbers are mostly the same. \n\nHowever, for the past couple of months, factories have been cutting production because inventories have been piling up. This is why the dispatch numbers and retail sales have become different. Retail sales have not fallen much, which means, people are still buying cars. \n\nFor eg,\n\n&gt; Similarly, domestic PV sales saw its worst-ever fall in August, slumping by 31.57 per cent to **1,96,524** units from 2,87,198 units in the year-ago period. \n\n196524 is the production.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; As per retail sales data also provided by SIAM, total automobile sales declined by 4.15 per cent 16,00,376 units as compared with 16,69,751 units in August 2018. **Similarly, PV sales stood at 2,38,357 units last month** as compared **with 2,56,662 units in the same month of last year, a decline of 7.13 per cent.** \n\nSo in August,\n\nLast year **287198 cars** were built, **256662** cars were sold, adding to the inventory count.\n\nThis year **196524** cars were built, but **238357** cars were sold, cutting down on the inventory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSimilarly for July 2019\n\n&gt; **Retail sales** of passenger vehicles (PV) declined by 11 percent to **2,43,183 units in July** \n\nBut factory numbers, \n\n&gt;  The Passenger vehicle (PV) segment has recorded a **sales decline of 30.98 per cent selling 200,790** units as compared to 290,391 units which were sold in the same month last year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo as you can see manufacturers are clearing inventory at the rate of 40,000 units a month.

      <li>Title::: 'Tracking ISRO budget over the years'<br />Body: "In light of the Chandrayaan 2 mission and ISRO's ongoing quest for manned spaceflight I decided to track ISRO and Dept of Space budget for the past 10 or so financial years. I started off with 2009-10 as the starting year since data was easily available for years since 2009-10 and I didn't have a lot of time. All of the data was drawn from publicly available datasets on OpenBudgetsIndia.org\n\nHere's the link to the bar chart of the budget. \n[image](https://i.imgur.com/wiNDHJi.png)\n\nIt really is a tale of two halves in many ways. The chart tracks 3 numbers essentially: Union Budget, Revised Budget and Actual Budget. \n\nThe terms are pretty self explanatory but it's interesting to see how these 3 numbers compare before and after 2014-15. Every year before 2014, the government revised downward the budget of the organization and for 3 consecutive years allocated roughly the same amount of money to Dept of Space leading up to the Mangalyaan mission in 2013. The funding allocation to ISRO has seen a remarkable jump every single year since 2014. Although not shown, Dept of Space funding allocation has now crossed Rs. 12000 crores for 2019-20. So in about 6 years, ISRO has seen more than a 100% jump in it's funding which is quite a big deal. \n\nAnother thing to observe is the revision of the budget post 2014. The budget has been revised downwards only once and that too marginally. Every other year has seen an upward revision with ISRO utilizing almost the entire allocation of funding. I don't like to make things political in a discussion about a prestigious organization such as ISRO but the funding situation coincides with a certain general election in 2014.  \n\nTo further put things in perspective, India currently spends roughly the same amount of money on ISRO as a percentage of the GDP as the US does on NASA (0.07% vs 0.1%). \n\nOne can clearly see ISRO's growth in the quality of the experiments on board Chandrayaan 2 vs Mangalyaan and Ch1. I expect Aditya (L1) to be no less impressive and I hold a firm opinion that we must try a Ch2.1 mission and try and nail that soft landing without Japanese or Russian help. A successful and prosperous ISRO will help us build a space industry in this country and put many of our engineers to work on projects that would advance humanity in unimaginable ways.  \n\nGiven all this, I think we're really at an important juncture as a country and society. Any economic downturn will result in organizations like ISRO being the first casualty. If we see off this bump in the economic story of our country without too many troubles (and I trust this dispensation to pull us through this), we'd continue writing this glorious chapter of ISRO's growth as a organization to reckon with and to continue to be proud of."<br />Author: 'kl_rahul_sucks_ass'  id: 'd1jnob'<br />Score:40<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d1jnob/tracking_isro_budget_over_the_years/</li>

I think it is time to course correct. Big bang economic reforms have not come.\n\nThe liberals are not going to praise Modi no matter what and it is time Modi get back to his roots. It is nice and fine to hug everyone and be the good guy, what we need the hard hitting Modi.\n\nAnd this crisis provides a great chance to bring the real Modi. Without a crisis in 1991, Narasimha Rao would not be remembered at all. Without the crisis that following Asian economic crisis and Indian nuclear tests, Vajpayee would not have been considered as a great a leader.\n\nModi has nearly 5 years to recover from the crisis and make history. And that bounceback will what define a great leader.\n\nAs Obama said, “never waste a crisis”. It is crisis times when you have to bring your big, bold ideas. The government has already brought mega bank mergers that waited nearly 2 decades. It is time to go further.\n\n\n1. Pull out the excessively overbearing tax authorities going after businesses. Excessively moralism is going to do no good at this stage. Let them go after big tax fraud, but terrorising every entrepreneur and creating a climate of fear has to stop.\n\n\n2. Simplify the GST.\n\n\n3. Build a massive national skills database on Aadhar with the simplicity of UPI that should have coverage of every India. People should be able to bring their technical certifications — such as commercial driving, electrician, welding, plumbing, civil engineering etc — and the government centers could add them to their profile. Businesses could instantly discover, do background check and hire in record small times. That would unlock a whole new labour market.\n\n\n4. Businesses should be able to add new skills required and if a profile is not found, government could train for subsidised rates and put people on market. Again, the simplicity, trust and scale should be on UPI’s lines.\nAccelerate the logistics network that was announced in last budget. Businesses should be able to move goods across the country cheap and fast.\n\n\n5. Bifurcate all state power distribution companies into a Tier A service for commercial and industrial customers with over 99% availability and a Tier B service for others who are given a subsidised rate. This would allow factories and businesses to have near uninterrupted power and let it be up to the state governments to support the Tier B customers if subsidized rates need to continue. Power is a big issue for setting up major businesses.\nLet the government start pooling spare land from all its PSU’s and also acquire from others, and lease out to factories. Land leasing on 10 year terms should be swift.\n\n\n6. Put all PSU banks on 100% privatisation after the NPA crisis is sorted out. That would pull up the markets as private players would be more open to invest in banks when they are sure that government with their majority stake will not mess up. The influx of capital would put them back to loan giving track.\n\nIf power, labour, land, logistics and loans are sorted out businesses would start to go at breakneck speed, with more hiring, more consumption thereby restarting the virtuous cycle.\n\nIn the next Parliament session, the government should be ready to push a whole bunch of hard reforms with or without the involvement of the opposition. This is a make or break for this administration.'<br />Author: 'aquaboy72'  id: 'd18b48'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d18b48/balajis_answer_to_is_indias_gdp_growth_rate_fall/</li>

In other places, Indians get labeled as "creepy" or "rapey" seemingly far more than people from any other country, as if no other nationality of men harasses men (and if they do, it is rarely attributed to their nationality or culture).\n\nOverall, India seems to be the most hated country on Reddit after the US, China, and Russia, but in comparison to those, India has much less influence on the world to justify heated criticism towards it.\n\nMakes me wonder just what India and Indians have "wronged" American and European Redditors (the dominant sources of users on Reddit) in ways that seemingly other countries have not.\n\nWhat are your explanations for why this hatred is there?'<br />Author: 'greenitor30'  id: 'd14mk4'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d14mk4/why_is_there_so_much_outright_hatred_and_vitriol/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The crisis that is on our way that if not checked will seriously threaten the Republic.'<br />Body: ' Something that has been on my mind for sometime that i would like to speak about and get the opinion of others on.\n\nThis will be on the topic of inter state migration\n\nRecently many states have enforced local job quota rules or are on track of doing so. \n\nNamely,\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\n[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/andhra-passes-bill-giving-75-job-reservation-for-locals/articleshow/70374723.cms?from=mdr](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/andhra-passes-bill-giving-75-job-reservation-for-locals/articleshow/70374723.cms?from=mdr)\n\nGoa\n\n[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/in-favour-of-80-job-quota-for-goans-says-sawant/articleshow/70612628.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/in-favour-of-80-job-quota-for-goans-says-sawant/articleshow/70612628.cms)\n\nMaharashtra \n\n[https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtra-moots-80-jobs-for-locals/article28789094.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtra-moots-80-jobs-for-locals/article28789094.ece)\n\nHaryana\n\n[https://m.timesofindia.com/city/chandigarh/wont-mind-adopting-thackeray-style-for-ensuring-quota-for-youths-in-factories-dushyant/amp\\_articleshow/70166059.cms](https://m.timesofindia.com/city/chandigarh/wont-mind-adopting-thackeray-style-for-ensuring-quota-for-youths-in-factories-dushyant/amp_articleshow/70166059.cms)\n\nMadhya Pradesh\n\n[https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-madhya-pradesh-cm-kamal-nath-eyes-70-job-quota-for-locals-2770353](https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-madhya-pradesh-cm-kamal-nath-eyes-70-job-quota-for-locals-2770353)\n\nThis has got me thinking, the underlying reasons for such moves and the thought process which leads to such moves.\n\nWhen this country was created, the makers of the constitution had decided to give every Indian the right to reside anywhere that he/she wants. Underlying this thought was the opinion that it will foster national integrity.\n\nBut it failed to factor in the fact that India will forever be a republic of states where people are touchy about regional identities.\n\nThe crux of my thought revolves around the people who seemingly make up the majority of inter-state migrants i.e. people from UP, Bihar. (I understand that it is not necessary that all these states received their migrants from just these two states but since numerically they seem to make up huge numbers and much of this discussion seem to revolve around them, hence they can be pointed out)\n\nFor some personal information, I am from Delhi and have been around here for as long as I can remember. \n\nEach year that passes by I see more and more people from these states living on our parks and footpaths, creating slums, having extremely high birth rates, sections of them engaging in criminal activities(not at all because they are from these states but due to the low education and low income status of these people).\n\n(Before anyone say that they are here because there is a demand let me just stop you right there, there is ‘a’ demand but the supply is completely thought the roof, remember most of these people migrate to Mumbai/Delhi/Hyderabad in the ‘hope’ that they get a job  and not on some call letter from a company.)\n\nEveryone is ready to make the claim that Delhi is unsafe for women but no one wants to target the crux of the problem that is this pushing of low income/less educated people into a more modern society.\n\nI cannot give you the statistics that you desire (because none exist) but only anecdotal experiences that I have personally witnessed or have had others mention it to me.\n\nThe only Delhi CM who had the spine to call this out was Sheila Dixit in contrast the current one is a sniveling little shit who will do anything for votes, typical caricature of a politician.\n\nMy point is that this migration is unsustainable, our infrastructure is in shambles, parks, footpaths and fields are being taken over and being used to live in and reproduce in, dirtying up the place and making the area all the more unsafe.\n\nAll this has started to raise nativist sentiments(as much as people would like to disagree with) in Delhi which didn’t exist (or atleast to the extent) until some time ago, in closed circles and closed discussions talk is being had of the ‘labor class’ that is making the state unsafe and less livable.\n\nIt is with sadness that I say that it doesn’t seem far off in the future when reactionary tendencies of Delhiites will overcome our senses and revolt against this, the spark that will light the larger fire will come from another Nirbahaya like incident and people putting the ‘two and two together’ either ending up in violence at worst or immigration restrictions at best.\n\n(For example the recent Gujarat violence, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018\\_attacks\\_on\\_Hindi-speaking\\_migrants\\_in\\_Gujarat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_attacks_on_Hindi-speaking_migrants_in_Gujarat))\n\nThis is where it connects to the larger picture of states enforcing local job quota rules.\n\nWe cannot just keep denying that problems caused due to excessive inter-state  migrations don’t exist, by keeping our heads in the sand, not having an open discussion, fusing morality into the equation and diluting the arguments, we do a great disservice to this country and the republic.\n\nIf this problem is left unchecked, not far off in the future, the existence of this republic will be threatened due to many states enforcing such restrictions and takeover of regional politics by regionalist parties.\n\nAnd besides all that, the people of UP, Bihar deserve better.\n\nThey don’t deserve to scrape out hand to mouth existence working as a rickshaw puller or a chaiwalla in Mumbai/Delhi/Hyderabad with little to no betterment in their lives.\n\nThey don’t deserve the violence.\n\nI know that they inherently don’t want to leave their native states but are forced to do so because of incompetent state governance (and central as well, Nehru’s Freight equalization Policy which killed the native industry in Bihar for example) which has pushed their economy into shambles.\n\nIt is imperative that for the continued existence of this republic, to keep regionalism in check, cut down excessive inter-state migrations and push back on the emergence of regionalist parties that we industrialize all the parts of our country equally (I understand that such is not possible but we can definitely ensure that the states that are left behind have high literacy and small populations).\n\nWe cannot afford to have our largest states with the most people and least urbanization waste away, that is a recipe for impending disaster.\n\nThis is where the larger govt. policies come into play, the iron is hot for striking, we can liberalize our economy and flood the east of India with jobs by attracting manufacturing giants to set up shop in these states.\n\nAs manufacturing is a labor intensive, less skilled activity, with smart policy we can attract these jobs into the east thereby soaking up the people of these states which in turn will cut down emigrations and hence disarm the regionalists.\n\nWhy would anyone want to work as a rickshawpuller with barely any income in another state when one can find a better paid, more prestigious, regular wage job in their own?\n\nAnd as industrial activity picks up, it will propel the larger Indian economy into prosperity.\n\nThe road to prosperity and social stability lies through our east. Its high time we recognized that.\n\n(To finish this (rant?? Haha) off, let me just say that I hold no ill will against anyone and if I have in any way hurt people here who are from UP, Bihar let me clarify that such was not at all my intention, all I wanted was to put a case across so that we can make ourselves more aware and eventually ask for better policies and thinking from our leaders).'<br />Author: 'Deeznuts028'  id: 'd148ci'<br />Score:34<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d148ci/the_crisis_that_is_on_our_way_that_if_not_checked/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Chadrayaan 2 : A successful failure.'<br />Body: 'Here are my two cents on the probable rapid unplanned disassembly of the rover and the lander, based on my experience in the game KSP.\n\nThe whole mission was extremely well done and probably was very ambitious. Here\'s why. In any space mission, the two crucial parts are the launch and the landing.\n\nIn any mission critical project, it\'s essential to know how to do things but to increase the probability of success it\'s more important to know how not to do things. The launch, although has very high potential for failure, was no doubt was successful due to years of research in rocket engineering and the failures we have experienced as space race including recent fatal ones such as the Challenger and  the Columbia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spaceflight-related_accidents_and_incidents. In facr, ISRO has been lauded as masters of super low cost space launches internationally, which is a huge feat itself given the amount of components and research hours are put in it.\n\nNow the landing part was always going to be difficult. There are three major points in my opinion which had contributed to the complexity of the landing.\n\nFirst, the surface of the moon is not smooth. It has been battered with millions of years of meteor showers and had no chance of healing the craters due lack of seasons or any kind of surface altering activities. \n\nSecond, the area of exploration selected for the mission is the least explored part of the moon, in fact the the Chadrayaan - 2 is the first mission to attempt landing there. Which means we had hardly any information about the terrain where the lander was suppose to land.\n\nThird and the most relevant is, this is the first time ISRO has engineered the lander and the whole landing procedure was completely automated. From the visuals which I have seen so far it seems the braking part of the whole process went abnormally. Unlike on earth, where the atmosphere slows down the spacecraft, on moon the spacecraft has to use it\'s engines to reduce velocity. In case of the lander, presumably, the computer seems to have done a "correction" burn, that is a burn to correct it\'s direction of touchdown, which I suppose went wrong, and sent the rover in a tumble. This situation doesn\'t seem very promising for a soft touchdown.\n\nHow this could\'ve occurred? Now, this the question we must ask and keep an eye on.There are number of reasons this may have happened. I can only speculate two.\n\nFirst, the scientist may done some miscalculation - Like I said earlier, we have little to no info of the area where the lander was suppose to land. Hence, there is a chance, the data, including but not limited to the terrain elevation and the composition of the landing site, might be off by some points, The scientist at ISRO may done calculations based on this information and the error in the available data might be in fact more that the margin of error considered during the planning phase.\n\nSecond, which I think is very likely, there might a physical failure of components. The engine or the computer might have malfunctioned. \n\nIn, either of the above case, ISRO is now way more smarter that it was a morning ago since it knows more about how not to the next moon mission, if it keeps the same objective.\n\nPlus, the orbiter survives which is the 95% of the mission.\n\nTLDR: This  failure will only make future missions more robust and increase the probability of success. This is how ISRO does it.'<br />Author: 'ameyalive'  id: 'd0rben'<br />Score:45<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d0rben/chadrayaan_2_a_successful_failure/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'MGR- the man behind the legend. Part 1'<br />Body: 'Maruthur Gopala Ramachandran a man who by dint of extreme hard work elevated himself to a demigod. A Leader who died in 1987, but who still has shrines with his devotees praying to him to this day. A film actor whose real life persona influenced his roles and his roles influenced his real life persona so much that at some point they merged and the man and his avatar on the silver screen became the Ourobros, one ended where the other started. This is not some theory but he himself said it in a speech. \n\n&gt; It is not enough if you are a good man,” he said, “You must also appear to be so… You put forward an image of yourself if you want to get anywhere.” \n\nA vengeful man, corrupt to his bone, given to violent fits of jealousy cried his detractors. A man who exemplified generosity, a modern day Karna, a political genius who was unbeaten (except for one central election) from the day he took to the Kurukshetra of politics till the day he died and then from beyond his grave, influencing election verdicts to this very day. Who was this exemplar Tamilzhan that united Periyarites, Communists, DK faithfuls and most of all the common man or should I say woman and has had such a deep legacy on Tamil and Indian politics?\n\nHe was a Malyalee born in Sri Lanka and thus not even a Tamilzhan. In this tale I will try and take you through his life, his policies, his faults, his political Chankyaniti and hope you take away that much more understanding of this land called Tamil Nadu that seems so strange to people north of the Vindhyas.\n\nMGR was born to Gopala Menon and Sathyabama in Kandy, Sri Lanka (Ceylon as it was then known). Gopala Menon was if apocryphal stories are to be believed, a very strict magistrate who fought for the rights of the underprivileged in British India. MGR in later interviews would say that he saw his father smack upper caste elites who were treating lower castes poorly with his umbrella…and from that was born the idea of MGR using his favourite onscreen weapon, the whip. It is said that (we don’t have much documentary evidence of this phase of MGR or his father’s life) on a case he had to hear against his own family members, Goapla Menon found his relative guilty and imposed a harsh punishment. This lead to his being ostracised and thus he along with his young wife and young son and daughter fled to Kandy, Sri Lanka. There he found a decent job as a English teacher in a college there and soon the kids followed. MGR first, born on 17th January 1917, and his sister was born a few years later. Tragedy struck though, by 1920, both his father and his infant sister had died, and his mother was faced with crippling debts, no job and bleak prospects.\n\nShe migrated back to India, but again giving credence to the being ostracised story, chose Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu rather than go back to Kerala. Already having lost a sister, on account of desperate poverty, MGR and his mother saw the deaths of both remaining siblings. By the time he was 7, MGR was inured to tragedy having never seen anything but bone crushing poverty and the deaths of his father and 2 sisters. His mother wrote to her family to help but possibly vindicating the theory of Gopala Menon giving a verdict against his own and being made a pariah for that, his wealthy (by Indian standards then) family on both the mother and father’s side refused to help. A slight this child would never forget. His mother then became a maid and possibly a keep (alleged, we don’t know) to a wealthier peasant by the name Velu Nair. Whatever it was, Nair lent them money, provided shelter and even put young MGR into the Govt Boys school in Kumbakonam along with his brother, M G Chakrapani (a fringe actor, but made wealthy by MGR). Now, one thing that made MGR so popular, esp with the women folk (more on that later) was his fair skin. He was extremely fair even by North Indian standards and by Tamil standards he was as radiant as some god to the masses. This was noticed by a teacher who cast him as the lead in a stage play at age 8.  MGR would never look back. It is interesting though to note that some of his best schemes were rooted, much like Modiji from his poverty struck times as a child – be it the mid day noon scheme (he and his family went hungry for many days at a stretch, only eating enough to barely live), his famous raincoat / umbrella scheme from when they huddled in the cold rain under a leaky roof.\n\nThe acting bug bit MGR, and his colour while an asset, in those days cinema was still a very elitist pursuit. The choice for the aspiring thespian was the stage. Becoming an actor though meant a rigorous training period. You learnt everything from sword fights (swords and sandals dramas on kings and gods was very popular), you learnt singing, acting, you lifted weights to set up the stage and basically were 10 roles rolled into one. MGR joined the “Madurai Original Boys Company” for the grand salary of some Rs 12 a month! He was with this troupe till he turned 14 when puberty hit and also disaster with it. His voice cracked and his previously mellifluous voice became hoarse, and with this key asset gone, he was ready to be chucked out of Madurai Original Boys.\n\nLuckily he found another mentor at the right time, one M K Mudaliar who ran an even more successful troupe, but this was focused on the diaspora in Burma (Rangoon) and Singapore as well as Malaysia. Mudaliar saw the potential in this young boy and asked his mother permission to take him abroad….his mother approved, but showing the iron spirit of loyalty he did throughout his life, young MGR insisted that his brother should also be a part of the tour, and Mudaliar agreed. MGR went abroad, stars in his eyes….with only one problem. He hadn’t developed into his muscular (relative to the stars then) physique yet, and thus was cast as the heroine. He protested, but to no avail and acted in many plays as a girl. However on return, his original troupe offered him a role in a movie and MGR jumped at this chance. His first role was at the age of 19 as an inspector in a movie called Sati Leelavati. Interesting aside, this was the debut movie of  an American named Ellis Duncan. An Irish American, he had come to India to act as a star, but when that didn’t work out, he became a director, a wildly successful one at that too.\n\nThus started the small appearances, begging for roles in Kodambakkam phase of his life. In this his best friend through thick and thin was P S Veerappa. In his own words, this phase was tough as his childhood. His routine as he described it was, wake up at 5 AM, to make the rounds of studios, no breakfast, a very limited lunch on the money he could muster, back home at 10 PM, a small fruit for dinner, wash his one set of clothes, put it out to dry for the next day, and sleep on an empty stomach till the routine began again.  However as we will see, he never forgot those who helped him during this phase, from P S Veerappa to a kindly couple who never hassled him for rent and even gave him food when they could.\n\nFinally, after 15 years of struggle, he got his first real break. The lead in a sort of a loose take on Macbeth, “MARMAYOGI”. Opposite him was the legendary Tamil Cinema villain, M N Nambiar and thus formed a friendship that would last decades. In this also the template of MGR, the one that merged real and reel was created. MGR was the good guy, he always helped the poor. He never lusted after women (though heroines lusting after him in a dream sequence became a common feature). In a way he became the Marx of Tamil celluloid, promising social equity, a time when the rich would always get their just deserts when MGR takes away their always ill-gotten wealth and redistribute it to the poor.\n\nHis breakway role though was in the movie scripted by the young firebrand writer, M Karunanidhi, a partnership that would last decades till it turned into bitter enmity. In Malaikanan (Hill Thief), the template was burnished in stone. It also created cinematic devices that are a MUST to this day in Tamil / Telugu masala cinema. An introduction song, an introduction fight and a deeply philosophical song (where M K really came through) where the hero expounds his views on the poor, rich, life etc. In this movie, MGR was a secret vigilante, a super wealthy robber who robbed the rich and gave to the poor and who only lived for the poor. The movie became a stupendous hit and the mega star was born.\n\nIn between these two movies he also stared in many epic swords and sandals adventures including one bizarre one named Genoa (after the city) with really bizarre character names (go look it up), which were all hits, thus by the time Malaikanan rolled around, MGR was both wildly popular with the masses and seen as a sure fire bet by producers.\n\nThen followed a string of movies with the fiery M K writing the script of the Dravidian movement – atheism (though MGR personally was a very devout man, but more on that later), rationalism, caste struggle but most importantly as MGR would insist, wealth redistribution and class struggle.\n\nThe movies seen now would be very simplistic and utterly devoid of any cinematic merit, but back then when all Tamil (and Hindi cinema for the most part) had were tales of kings, stories from Hindu mythology, this was seen as revolutionary and pathbreaking.\n\nBy the time Malaikanan released, he was persuaded to join DMK from the Congress party and in 1953 he was a full fledged, card carrying DMK member under Anna. By 1960, he was a star campaigner for the DMK but he was not very interested in a political career and focussed on his still super hot and rising movie career.'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'd0d1jc'<br />Score:54<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d0d1jc/mgr_the_man_behind_the_legend_part_1/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Huge DNA studies published today on the origin of indians'<br />Body: "This basically confirms that modern South Asians are a mixture of 3 core populations.\n\nThe first being the AASI, Ancient Ancestral South Indians, who were the first modern-humans to populate India after migrating out of Africa. They most closely resemble modern-day South Indian tribal populations.\n\nThe third group is the Steppe Nomads, popularly referred to as the Aryans. They originated in West-Kazakhstan, and migrated through Central-Asia until they reached the Punjab. It was here they propagated the Vedas and early Sanskrit, before moving into the rest of India and extending their conquests.\n\nNext came Iranian Agriculturalists, who migrated East before arriving in the Indus Valley in modern-day Pakistan, where they mixed with the AASI peoples and produced the Indus Valley Civilization. Language is currently thought to be proto-Dravidian.\n\nThe third group is the Steppe Nomads, popularly referred to as the Aryans. They originated in West-Kazakhstan, and migrated through Central-Asia until they reached the Punjab. It was here they propagated the Vedas and early Sanskrit, before moving into the rest of India and extending their conquests.\n\nThese are the major population inputs into modern South-Asians, though regionally there are other significant admixtures. The East has some South-East Asian input, and the North-West has some more West-Asian input.\n\nAlso, South-India speaks Dravidian languages likely because of some early migration from the Indus Valley into the region. Its also possible they were never conquered by the Steppe-Aryans as North-India was, and were therefore able to preserve their languages.\n\nLinks! https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)30967-5#secsectitle0175\n\nhttps://scholar.harvard.edu/vagheesh/centralsouthasia\n\nIf you don't have access through a university, you can probably find full-text versions available by googling around.\n\nNow I know there are going to be idiots here saying this study is fake and just stick their heads in the mud.\n\n&gt;inb4 aryan is not a race its a title reeeeeeeee\n\nIn the case of India you are mostly right but as someone who speaks Sanskrit who was Aryan and who was not was often left to the whims of the writers. Sometimes it was if you did noble deeds and upheld dharma, sometimes it was by culture, sometimes religion, sometimes language and sometimes you just called enemy tribes non aryans just because you didn't like them. There were many Dravidian people who were declared Aryan because of their culture. Now for the love of fuck don't like me that charlatan Rajiv Malhotra.\n\n&gt;inb4 aryan migration theory is debunked reeeeeee\n\nNo my friend what was rejected was the Aryan INVASION theory. \n\nTl;dr: British dude saw a tonne of skeletons in an IVC city and came up with a bogus theory that Aryans invaded and slaughtered the Dravidians of the IVC to justify why the Brits were colonizing India- because lighter skinned people always ruled India\n\nThis theory was quickly discarded. In reality the Aryan migration took place over a long period of time and there is no documentation of warring with Dravidian tribes. The only documentations of hostility are with central asian and other aryan tribes. Dravidians and Aryans coexisted peacefully and with mutual respect for the most part.\n\nThis notion that all Indians are the same and have the same ancestors is nonsense. There is zero I repeat zero evidence that Dravidians and Aryans have the same ancestors. Tamil and Sanskrit developed independently and don't have a proto language. Indo-Aryans and Dravidians developed independently and don't have a proto tribe. There is no proto-Aryo-Dravidian tribe and if you can find any piece of evidence that says there is, it is welcome."<br />Author: 'certified_chutiya'  id: 'd0cpmv'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d0cpmv/huge_dna_studies_published_today_on_the_origin_of/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'IAF and the Govt needs to seriously accelerate fighter projects'<br />Body: "Right now, the IAF has a strength of around 30 squadrons, one of the lowest in recent times. \n\n1 squadron is around 16-18 aircrafts.\n\nIAF's sanctioned strength, or what it regards to be as required to protect two-fronts Pakistan and China, is 42 squadrons. Now this based on older requirements, today the requirements might be or more or lower, but it is definitely more than 30.  \n\n\nIn the next 5 years IAF will have phase-out even more squadrons.  \n\n\n1. 100+ Mig 21s will definitely be history in 2-3 years. That is 8 squadrons gone.\n2. Around a squadron of Mig-27s will also go, most of them have been retired already. This particular aircraft has had a very tortorous history with IAF and usually has been considered a bad buy.\n\nPresent strength:\n\n1. 66 Mig-29s, which have gone through a $1 billion upgrade program to extend their life by about another 10 years. These have been overhauled extensively with bigger fuel tanks, BVR missiles, upgraded avionics and air-to-air refueling.\n2. Around 120 Jaguars, which act as ground attack airplanes. These aircraft were supposed to receive engines since the current ones are considered to be under-powered. However, recently, IAF cancelled the engine upgrade citing high cost. Around 40 of them are expected to be retired from 2023, while the rest was to get the engine upgrade along with AESA radars, new avionics and instrumentation. The modifications included structural changes with addition of weight, hence the better engines, but with engines cancelled...this project is in limbo. Not frontline.\n3. Mirage-2000s, there are 40 of those and they have been upgraded at very high over $2.5 billion. They are thankfully what can be said as our front-line force, especially for precision ground attacks.\n4. HAL Tejas, 16 has been built and inducted. But these are Mk1 aircraft and they are based in South India. IAF has always maintained that the one they want is the improved Mk1a for combat. \n5. Finally the Su-30, 272 of those. Lost around 10 (?) to crashes which will hopefully be made up by the current order of 12 planes. Some of the Su-30 batches however are reaching 20 years of age, and they will need to go through a Mid Life Upgrade. The plan was to update them with AESA radars, integration of them with newer missiles like Meteors, better electronic warfare suites, structural upgrades and new engines. No news of this yet, minimum time for implementation and delivery is definitely 5-7 years away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProcurement:  \n\n\n1. 36 Rafales, so 2 squadrons over 4 years.\n2. 4 IOC Tejas and 20 FOC (Final Operation Certificate) Tejas Mk1s. This 40 airplanes is part of the original order and since they are based in South India, I dont think they will see combat. \n\nThat's it.\n\nPrograms:\n\n1. 83 Tejas Mk1a. Gov, HAL and IAF has been sitting on this order for years now. This version of Tejas is expected to come with slightly powerful engines, more range, air-to-air refueling, external targeting pods and AESA radar. This is the version IAF wants for combat. Gov still says price negotiations are going on. From signing the contract to delivery, a minimum of 5 years...2024 if we are lucky. More considering it is HAL.\n2. 110 aircraft MMRCA 2.0: This circus is still going on. MMRCA was envisioned as a single platform to replace Jaguars, Mig 27s and Mirages, capable of attacking ground and air superiority hence multi-role. Contenders include the Rafale, F-15s, Gripen etc. No movement going on with this. As is the case with everything else, if you decide today, minimum 5 years till delivery. Boeing is pitching hard for this contract.\n3. Why not just buy more Rafales? Too expensive, and will destroy the budget. Plus long allegations of bribery and a complicated procurement till now might make it difficult. Eitherways, no news on this front too. \n4. HAL Tejas MK2: It is looked upon as the Indian alternative to the MMRCA. It is envisioned as Mirage sized plane with twin engines. HAL has said first flight is in 2026-28. Development is going on, no concrete plans or orders. \n5. AMCA: Our fifth generation fighter jet, but it will require even more technology to mastered like stealth material, coatings, divertless air intakes, air exhaust masking, sensor fusion, very powerful radars etc. Expected production in the 2030s. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo as you can see between 2020 and 2025, things are looking a bit bleak. Either the government gets a move on in order the upgrades, new aircraft and domestic programs, this is will start looking bleaker.  \n\n\nUnfortunately we do not have limitless money. The defense budget especially after you divide into the many different forces, pay for operational expenses etc, there isn't a huge pile left for capital costs. 18 Rafales is enough to blow a massive hole every year.  \n\n\nThis is beside the fact that the IAF also has ongoing and urgent upgrades/procurement programs to replaces transport Helos, combat helos, 100s of older transport aircraft like An-32s and HS-748s, strategic transport, air-refuelers, AWACs aircraft, prop trainers, jet trainers, not to mention air-to-air missiles, upgrading air-force bases, conventional bombs, precision bombs, air-defense each of these projects runs into 10s of thousands of crores. \n\nI am sure many of you are more knowlegeable here and can add more info, but IAF+Gov+Research+PSUs seriously need to get a move on."<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'd065ae'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/d065ae/iaf_and_the_govt_needs_to_seriously_accelerate/</li>

New wave of ideas is coming upon us in India, the sole aim of which is to fragment and confuse the society to further help the ruling elite in controlling the population i.e. us. It is being done in west and soon the minions of the Indian elite who call themselves liberals would start to ape it. Infact the aping has started. The idea to divide and confuse us this time is 'gender is a social construct' presented in this article. I am sharing it with hope that it would clear your perception and help you recognize nonsense when you see . \n\nTwo gender approach is “wrong” and we have spectrum of genders shit has come to India. Negating biological truth here is a ... well here is a no one ,who got space to write in newslaundry, declaring that, “I am personally an advocate for approaching gender and sexuality as a spectrum.” No one can have a personal opinion conflicting science but here is a person trying to negate the scientific fact that there are two genders (Three at most if you consider transgenders), that gender is not something rooted in biology but is just a social construct and newslaundry is giving space to such person and her unscientific propaganda. \n\nThe writer asserts that, “The world is gradually giving up on specific personal pronouns like she or her for they or them.” Nothing of the sort is happening in formal or informal language written or spoken. There is a propaganda to make such things happen which Canada tried to institue by trying to pass a law, plans of which were dropped after the stiff resistence they had to face pioneered by Dr. Jordan Peterson. The idea was to address everyone with their preferred personal pronouns (even the ones that does not exist in English language and were invented by the people, this shit is true they came up with ze and zer! Search online you will find it.) A student chose his personal pronoun to be His Majesty to point out how ridiculous the whole exercise is. \n \nAs the article progress another line that catches your attention is, “We are tired of being castigated for being too much of the ‘other gender’.” Notice how other gender is written with quotation marks as if there is nothing called other gender and we all belong to whichever gender we choose to identify with, biology and sex organs be damned.\n\nThen she writes: One day, I was at a dance fitness class and mid-way, through a vigorous routine, the underwire in my bra came off. I was left shame-faced, extremely embarrassed and completely frozen. I did not know if I should run, adjust my clothes when no one was looking, or just carry on like nothing happened. I didn't run. Instead, tried a bit of the other two. I could see men around me moving their bodies freely, with abandon. But women around me, including myself, we were constantly worried. Will my breasts look vulgar if I move a certain way? Is this a bit too suggestive? This incident that had nothing to do with other people at the class and everything to do with how I felt, left me upset. It took me a while to decide what exactly it was that was bothering me so much. Outside of basic decency that we are all so mindful of maintaining, women are incessantly worried about their bodies. Oh, the ingenious ways we’ve have developed to hide them—dupattas, baggy shirts, saris, a veil even! Everything is designed to hide our form. All of this, so men are not inconvenienced in any way by the space we occupy? This is why I think breaking the stereotypes of gender normativity is easier for men than it is for women (and I use these words in generic manner). I cannot imagine a woman turning up at the gym without a bra although I wish she could, even if it meant reviving a movement from the 1960s.\n\nIf you are ashamed of your body that is your problem. Spare us the gender-is-a-social-construct bullshit. \n\n“only when we start thinking about the ways in which women's clothes have oppressed them over the years.” \n\nAgain if you are not wearing what you want to that’s your problem.\n\n“Many of these clothes aim to make the female form more desirable to men.”\n\nDon’t wear them. Don’t look attractive or desirable, who is stopping you! Wear a goddamned Burka \n\n\n“Women's clothes have been designed to keep them in check. Whereas men's clothes have been designed exactly for the purpose clothes are meant to serve—to cover them.”\n\nIf that were the case men would just wear a sack and be done with it. The fact that men have different outfits from suits to kurtas to casuals its evident they have style which is just another word for looking attractive to their peers and opposite gender. \n\n“This is perhaps why no one thought it necessary to have pockets in pants for women (and there was a global movement around this). Women were expected to carry bags and purses everywhere.”\n\nSo apparently women not having pocket in their pants is a global conspiracy to keep them in check.\n\n“If we collectively got rid of the dupatta, the bra and the shaper, eventually, no one would feel the need for them. A girl sure wants to have fun. But you don’t expect her to have any real fun if she’s busy balancing herself in six-inch heels while making sure the underwire in her bra doesn’t poke through her chest, do you?”\n\nShe speaks as if girls are being forced to wear bra. The fact is she does not have the courage to wear what she wants and wants to change the whole society’s tastes and preferences and outlook to fit her ideas."<br />Author: 'l6_6l'  id: 'czy6c8'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/czy6c8/postmortem_of_a_newslaundry_article/</li>

But Wednesday's debate caught my attention.\n\nIn one of the debate, Arnab mentioned an important thing which would surprise many.\n\nArnab says that there is strong fight happening in the Congress camp. The fight is not between it's second level ministers but right on the top. He said that there is a fight happening between Sonia and Rahul Gandhi.\n\nHe said that Sonia feels that Rahul Gandhi has destroyed the Congress and needs to be sidelined now.\n\nHe also mentioned that the lutyens media doesn't want to cover this news and is hiding it.\n\nThe last time a famous fight happened between such duo was the Indira and Sanjay Gandhi. While both instances are not comparable at all, but we all know what happened to Sanjay Gandhi after that.\n\nArnab has had a history of revealing secrets that many conventional journalists do not. Out of many, two instances I remember, one he was right, another he was wrong. First one being him saying that Fadnavis was all set to become the CM of Maharashtra when everyone said a Brahmin would never be allowed to become one. He was right about it. Second is more recent when he had said BJP and JDS were going to form the government in Karnataka. This came out to be untrue.\n\nNow, as for the unbelievable Sonia-Rahul fight, we can always have our doubts about it and its on the individual to believe that Arnab is saying the truth or not, but if it's indeed true, then it's a really interesting page in the politics of India."<br />Author: 'Mumbaikarsevak'  id: 'czqnl4'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/czqnl4/potential_soniarahul_fight/</li>

      <li>Title::: "The problem with today's Sikhism"<br />Body: 'On the Sanatani -&gt; Khalistani spectrum of Sikhi, the more you move towards the latter, the more flashy they become about every single thing. Its the "Look at my religion we are so good! We are so virtuous ! Please give us attention, please praise my religion. My religion cannot survive if people don\'t praise it even for a second." attitude.\n\nWhy does this happen? Because as the vessel is emptied of its spiritual dharmic essence, it starts making more and more noise. This almost possessive shrillness of modern Sikhism about its acts of philanthropy, is directly correlated with depletion of a dharmic core. This noise is desperately trying to hide a lack of foundation, a silence at the very core.\n\nHave observed this with many sikhs. The more and more they are emptied of the dharmic core, paradoxically, the more contradictory they (have to) become. Sikh doctrine loses all coherence as its dharmicness is chipped away bit by bit. So what happens? Essentially the philosophy becomes unstable, not only in \'belief\' but in \'practice\' too. Since the spiritual core is unstable now, the anchor of identity is sought somewhere else, more firm.\n\nWhat it effectively does is that the community identity is mainly linked to the philanthropic activity. This is how identity is sought and recognised. So such activity does becomes bigger than itself, it becomes a RITUAL. Now the thing with ritual is that it has to be \'showed\' to be done. It has inherent public nature. So the K-sikh longs for it, especially if he is aspirational. If no opportunity is available, he created one.\n\nYou will find with many such sikhs that if you have any talk of philosophy with them, the hidden atheism will shine through, and they will eventually boil down Sikhi to \'Do Good, Be Kind\' type of a philosophy. Many non-K shikhs do it too. They get away with only this in India, but the problem with those living outside a Hindu land is that such kind of ambiguity is not digestible there. They have to go full throttle showmanship on what they started with.\n\nWhat started with this philanthropy approach, does not remain limited here. The idea of equality also comes in - gender, caste, racial, etc. The K-Sikh now has to be \'seen\' to stand for them. It becomes almost a religious obligation. Now the thing is that this is not simply being done as a performance, although that is an essential part of it. It is also being done for the stability of internal moral framework. \'To feel good\'.\n\nIt is for this reason why you will find an aspiring Khalistani standing at exactly where the equality SJW compass is pointing at, in whichever society he is a part of. He is helpless before it. This is his religion now. To not be like this is blasphemy. This is why he goes against all common sense to support Islamists in Britain, they the civilizational enemies, the groomers of Sikh girls. This is because common sense is rational but the chains of the K-Sikh are memetic. Eventually at peak, the K-sikh will become open to memetic subversion and will have to take a leak of \'faith\' only to live with some coherence intact. That is the logical end of his project.\n\nIn India, the loss of dharmic religiousity manifests itself in a different way. Reduced to an atheistic "Be good, do good", Sikhs have begun to mass convert to Christianity. Sikhs already have low TFR and are quickly becoming a minority even in Punjab due to being outbred by Hindus and being converted to Christianity.\n\nBut do you see what it all started with? What set this in motion? It is in trying to distance himself from Hinduism that the Sikh truly confounded himself. The only real basis of clarity becomes "we do not imitate Hindus". In short term this will give cohesion but for a long term cohesion you need something of your own besides empty SJWing. When you start marketing philanthropic causes (endless virtue signalling) it\'ll eventually lead to progressives expecting more &amp; more. Thus the intersectional quagmire beckons the Sikhs.'<br />Author: 'CharmingRamsayBolton'  id: 'cznzmq'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cznzmq/the_problem_with_todays_sikhism/</li>

Although I call myself an agnostic hindu, people generally don’t see it that way. I don’t use my SC certificate for any favours which in turn angers everyone in my family. My grandfather came to India in 1955 from east Pakistan. He came with a wife and two sons (my father was one of them). My uncle and aunt were born later in India. You could say that they were the first Indians of my family. My grandfather settled in a small town by the river, on illegally acquired marshland, like many others who came and settled here. It took my family 40 years to come out of poverty. I remember that very clearly as it happened during my childhood. My generation was the first in my family to even finish school and go to college.\n\n\tNamashudras have been suffering for hundreds of years under the British and also hindu zamindars and muslim nawabs but the partition hit us the most hard. Before he had to come here, my grandfather was an independent fisherman in his own land but here he was a contract labour living on borrowed land. India welcomed the refugees but the people never really opened their hearts to us. I don’t want to generalise but this prejudice and alienation persists still today. For some elite ‘bhumiputra’ hindu bengalis, the Namashudra refugees rank lower than ‘bhumiputra’ muslim bengalis, no matter the circumstance. I can forgive but how can I forget the taunts from some of my friends that I have to endure despite being an Indian just like them. They do not feel like innocent japes.\n\n\tI am politically a bit left leaning but I don’t trust any political parties. In the last 70 years all parties have exploited our community for votes and I reckon they will continue to do so. My own uncle (who was the first Indian in my family) was arrested forcefully and killed in police custody (sometime between 1972-1974) because he had naxal friends and thus considered dangerous. All my life, people have tried to ignite my supposed resentment towards my country and they have failed. I have and always will love India and its people. Despite its flaws, I still have faith in the system. I do not have any anger towards any country, religion or community or hate all the people because of crimes committed by some of them who are lost. I still trust humanity.\n\n\tSo what has all this got to do with NRC? It is a complicated process to say the least and conducted by the Indian bureaucracy. Many mistakes will be made, both honest and dishonest. My family and many like us has some of the needed documents but they are in a sorry condition. It all boils down to the availability of our legacy data kept by the government. Even after all that, me or any of my relatives or people in my community whom I know personally, who have lived in India for many decades might lose their citizenship due to a technical glitch or clerical error. Many might get citizenship illegally. But this is not the time to panic or start fear-mongering but to become alert to our current predicament as a law abiding citizen of India. I do not claim to know all the technicalities but I have started to inform people in my locality as best as I can, to prepare the documents and get ready for this process as civililised people.\n\n\tBut some questions remain. Why only border states? Why not the whole country? Why not every region with or without any special allocation for any special community? Why only certain religious immigrants are invalid? If the law is the law and law is equal for everyone then why not all illegal immigrants are shown the door? India has enough mouths to feed. Does it need more come flooding in just because they are minority in another country but majority here? I am willing to take that risk but what about you?\n\n\tI apologise in advance for not being able to reply to your comments on time.\n\n\tJai Hind.'<br />Author: 'myogname'  id: 'cz4ylg'<br />Score:29<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cz4ylg/in_light_of_the_impending_probable_implementation/</li>

While it traded extensively with Rome and the Middle East, it also had a very high degree of trade with the east\n\n* Many Chinese coins found in this region testify to the presence of direct trade with China from this port \n\n* Even more symbolic, we have records of many Buddhist missionaries using Mamallapuram as a port of exit to reach the east. For instance we know one Buddhagupta reached Malaya sometime in the 5th century. Many of the merchants were Buddhist and aided the spread of Buddhism in the east. \n\n* Later with the arrival of the Chola, the focus shifted to Nagapatinam with Mahabalipuram relegated to a secondary port but still one that was very active and rich. Even a secondary port of the Chola would have rivaled any major port in contemporary Islamic or Europe. \n\n* It is possible (highly debated but a possibility nonetheless) that Boddhidharma the founder of Chan Buddhism and possibly Kung Fu was the son of a Pallava King and who might have emigrated to China via this very same port. \n\n* On Nagapatinam though, fun fact, during the rule of Narasimha Pallava 2, the Chinese Emperor sent an embassy and one of the requests of this embassy was a Vihara (place of rest and worship for Buddhist monks) in Nagapatinam to be built at his own (Chinese) cost. This was allowed and a Buddha Vihara was built. This though was lost to time by the 1000 AD's and the Cholas then were petitioned by the Sri Vijaya King for another Vihara and the Chudamani Vihara was built. Hiuen Tsang reports one more Vihara being destroyed by a giant Tsunami around 600 AD. All of this is referenced in Kalki's Ponniyin Selvan (one of the best historical fiction works ever written, go read it)\n\n* Nasrasimha Pallavan also sent an embassy to the Chinese Emperor. \n\nOkay one more tale on Narasimha Pallava, because he is so interesting and also it debunks so many lies on the caste system and the alleged Hindu tyranny. \n\nNarasimha Pallava was one of the greatest warriors in India of his era. He fought many foes he fought many foes in all directions but he was also such a great devotee of Shiva that he is one of the 63 Nayanars (great Shiva devotees). He was also a capable writer, he wrote many plays in Sanskrit and a few in Tamil (but muh Pallavas are Aryan not Tamil reee debunked) - his plays are performed to this day in TN and Kerala btw. \n\nHe married a possibly Jain wife who continued to be Jain (conversion by force was unheard of in Dharmic India). She could have been Buddhist also but definitely not Hindu. \n\nIn the Periyapuranam (read it), it is said that his wife who didn't know Hindu ways smelt a flower offered to Mahadeva. Enraged another Nayanar from the Vellalar caste (a lower caste... Who was and is venerated as god almost) chopped off her nose. The King got angry and asked Serthunnai Nayanmar ( lower caste) why he did what he did and when he explained, is praised for his actions and he allegedly chops of the his wife's finger for the crime. \n\nPoint is, a Hindu emperor who was a staunch Shaivaite, establishing Buddhist Viharas, marrying a Jain is the epitome of not discriminating on the basis of religion. An allegedly lower caste person being a venerated guru is one more debunking of the lies spewed by modern day historians. \n\nAnyway back on topic, Mamallapuram was a great port with regular commerical and religious as also cultural ties with China from at least 200-300 AD. The choice is very apt and symbolic of how deep our links and friendship between the two cultures run. \n\nGreat choice by whoever advised Modiji on this."<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'cz0ok9'<br />Score:100<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cz0ok9/modis_choice_of_mamallapuram_for_his_meet_with_xi/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'मिनहाज़ सिराज की रेल से बख्तियार-पुर जंक्शन तक का सफर- भारत में इस्लाम भाग 7 |'<br />Body: '\nबिहार का एक बड़ा शहर है बख्तियारपुर। रेलवे का एक पुराना जंक्शन। ये बख्तियार कौन है, जिसके नाम पर एक ऐसे राज्य के बड़े शहर का नामकरण हुआ, जहाँ की ज़मीन से दो धर्म दुनिया को मिले। बौद्ध और जैन धर्म की ज़मीन है बिहार।\n\nगौतम बुद्ध और भगवान महावीर की चहलकदमी से आबाद रही होगी कभी। इन दोनों महान राजपुत्रों के अनगिनत प्रसिद्ध अनुयायी हुए हैं। उनके अपने परिजनों के नाम भी सब जानते हैं। ये नाम इतने हैं कि बिहार के हर छोटे-बड़े शहर के नाम इन पर हों जाएँ तो नाम कम नहीं पड़ेंगे। 24 तो तीर्थंकर ही हैं। बुद्ध के संघ में सैकड़ों श्रद्धेय नाम बाद की चार सदियों तक मिलेंगे। अशोक से लेकर कनिष्क तक सारिपुत्त से लेकर बसुमित्र तक। मगर बख्तियार में कुछ खास होना चाहिए, जो इन सबमेें नहीं था।\n\nजनाब मुहम्मद बख्तियार खिलजी साहब आखिर किस लोक से अवतरित हुए थे और ऐसा क्या कारनामा कर दिखाया था, जिस वजह से उनके पाक नाम पर महान भारत का एक शहर अपना शानदार परिचय दुनिया को दे रहा है? क्या वह बुद्ध और महावीर से भी बढ़कर था? क्या उसने ऐसा कुछ किया था, जो चाणक्य, चंद्रगुप्त और अशोक की चमक को भी फीका कर दे? बिहार वालों ने अगर अपने एक शहर का नाम बख्तियारपुर रख छोड़ा है तो बिलाशक वह कोई पहुँचा हुआ इंसान ही होना चाहिए! हो सकता है कोई फरिश्ता हो!\n\nमुहम्मद बख्तियार की पुख्ता शिनाख्त के लिए आइए मिनहाज़ सिराज के पास चलते हैं। मिनहाज़ सिराज अकेला आदमी है, जो बिहार की धरती पर आए इस अनजान आदमी के बारे में सबसे ज्यादा मालूमात रखता है। उसके पास बख्तियार की पूरी कुंडली मिलेगी। हो सकता है इतनी जानकारी खुद बिहार के पास नहीं होगी और होगी भी तो मिनहाज़ से ही मिली होगी।\n\nहम सीधे 800 साल पहले मिनहाज़ सिराज के पास चलते हैं। वह इस वक्त ग्वालियर में है और यह सन् 1231 का वक्त है। ग्वालियर पर इल्तुतमिश का जबर्दस्त हमला हुआ है। इस्लाम के फौजियों ने इस शहर को भूखे-भेड़ियों की तरह घेर रखा है। वे दूर-दूर तक झुंडों में बदशक्ल लकड़बग्घों जैसे घूम रहे हैं। दिल्ली से ग्वालियर के रास्ते पर भारी चहल-पहल है। तरह-तरह की अफवाहें उड़ी हुई हैं। दहशत बढ़ रही है।\n\nमगर इस जानलेवा हो-हल्ले के बीच एकदम अलग एक शख्स हर दिन फौज को जोश से भरने वाली तकरीर देने में लगा है। वह इस्लाम की ऐसी-ऐसी फतहों की कहानियाँ सुनाता है कि थकेहारे, बेदम और जाहिल फौजियों की आँखों में खून उतर आए। यह आवाज़ मिनहाज़ सिराज की है। वह है तो एक कलमनवीस। लिखने-पढ़ने का काम करता है।\n\nइतिहास उसका पसंदीदा विषय है। वह इतिहास ही लिखता है। यूँ भी कह सकते हैं कि वह जिसे इतिहास समझता है, वही लिखता है। वह खानदानी आदमी है। मोहम्मद गोरी की सेना में उसका बाप काज़ी था। काज़ी मतलब शरिया अदालत का चीफ जज। उसके घर में मिनहाज़ की पैदाइश 1193 की है। यह वही साल है, जब गोरी ने पृथ्वीराज चौहान को हराकर दिल्ली पर कब्ज़ी जमाया था।\n\nअपने बाप के घर से मिनहाज 1226 में दिल्ली के लिए रवाना हुआ था। दो साल बाद जब उसने दिल्ली में कदम रखे तब यहाँ शम्सुद्दीन इल्तुतमिश की हुकूमत थी। इल्तुतमिश के ग्वालियर पर हमले का साल 1231 है। मिनहाज़ यहीं है।\n\nवह सुलतान के शिविर में इस्लाम की बेमिसाल फतहों की कहानियाँ सुनाता है। ऐसे जोशीले भाषण कि काफिरों के खिलाफ जंग के मैदान में इस्लामी लड़ाकों का खून उबाल पर बना रहे। रमजान-मुहर्रम में हर दिन भाषण और बाकी महीनों में हफ्ते में एक दिन। ग्वालियर के एक ही झपट्\u200cटे के दौरान उसने 95 भाषण दिए।\n\nग्वालियर पर फतह की खबरों ने दिल्ली तक माहौल गरमा दिया। मिनहाज़ सिराज ग्वालियर का पहला काजी नियुक्त हुआ। इस्लामी कानून लागू करने के लिए अब एक साथ उसके पास कई अहम जिम्मेदारियाँ थीं। वह लेखक भी था इसलिए अपने पसंदीदा विषय इतिहास में ही घूमता रहता। वह एक जगह टिका नज़र नहीं आता।\n\nजल्दी ही ग्वालियर से दिल्ली गया और अवध होकर बंगाल तक घूमता रहा। जब उसने ग्वालियर छोड़ा तो किताबों के दो बड़े बक्से भी दिल्ली भेजे गए। एक पल के लिए मत भूलिए कि यह गुलाम वंश के बेरहम सुलतानों का दौर था। कुतबुद्दीन एबक और इल्तुतमिश से लेकर बलबन और मुइज्जुद्दीन कैकुबाद के रोंगटे खड़े कर देने वाले कारनामों की सदी।\n\nमिनहाज़ ने तो ऊँचे ओहदों पर रहकर उनकी हुकूमतें देखीं और बहुत सारे ऐसे लोगों के बीच वह रहा, जो एक तरह से दिल्ली पर कब्ज़ा करने वाले “पहले बैच’ के हमलावर तुर्क थे। उसके पास सब तरफ की ब्रेकिंग न्यूज़ थीं।\n\nअपने मुस्तकबिल की तलाश में बख्तियार खिलजी ने दिल्ली छोड़कर बंगाल का रुख किया था। तब के बंगाल में आज का पश्चिम बंगाल, बांग्लादेश, बिहार और ओडिशा का भी कुछ हिस्सा था।\n\nयह इतना बड़ा इलाका था, जिसमें आज का एक आजाद मुल्क बांग्लादेश है और हिंदुस्तान के दो बड़े सूबे भी समाए हुए हैं। टैगोर ने मेरा सोने सा बंगाल तब कहा जब वह सदियों का लुटा-पिटा टूटा-फूटा सामने था। आठ सौ साल पहले बख्तियार के आसपास दौलत की लूटमार के जो नज़ारे हैं, उनमें आप हकीकत में देख पाते हैं कि सोने सा बंगाल होना कहते किसे हैं?\n\nइतिहास में ताका-झाँकी करने वाले थोड़े-बहुत महान भारतीयों को भी बख्तियार के नाम से सिर्फ इतना ही इल्म होगा कि इस मुस्लिम हमलावर ने सबसे पहले सदियों पुराने शानदार नालंदा और विक्रमशिला विश्वविद्यालयों को तबाह कर डाला था। बिहार में यह तबाही ठीक उसी समय फैली जब दिल्ली के महरौली इलाके में पुराने 27 मंदिरों को गिराया जा रहा था। मिनहाज़ सिराज ने बख्तियार का “बायोडाटा’ तैयार किया है। मुलाहिज़ा फरमाइए-\n\n“वह गोर और गर्मसीर के खिलजी कबीले से अलग होकर मुहम्मद गोरी के दरबार में पहुंचा। उसे दीवाने-अर्ज में एक छोटा सा पद दिया गया। (दीवाने-अर्ज एक विभाग था, जिसका काम युद्ध की मुकम्मल तैयारियों काे पूरा करने का था।)\n\nबख्तियार को यह ऑफर अपनी काबिलियत के मुकाबले में कुछ हल्का लगा। उसने इसे कुबूल नहीं किया और दिल्ली की तरफ रुख किया। दिल्ली में तो उसे इस मामूली से ओहदे के काबिल भी नहीं समझा गया। उसे यहाँ कोई पद नहीं मिला। तब वह बंदायू पहुँचा, जहाँ कोई नौकरी उसे मिल गई। उसके पास एक शानदार घोड़ा और कुछ हथियार थे। बदायूँ से वह अवध की तरफ चला गया और मलिक हुसामुद्दीन की नौकरी में लग गया।”\n\nतब के हिंदुस्तान में चारों तरफ फैले काफिर हिंदू राजाओं के खिलाफ लगातार लड़ाइयाँ ही एकमात्र ऐसा उद्योग बन गई थीं, जो लगातार फल-फूल रहा था और जिनमें लूटमार के बेहिसाब मौके खुल गए थे। निजी तौर पर जो जितनी ताकत दिखाने की हैसियत में होता, उसके लिए तरक्की के दरवाजे सुलतान के तख्त तक भी ले जा सकते थे।\n\nबख्तियार ऐसा ही एक जुनूनी आदमी था, जिसके पास दूसरे तुर्कों की तरह खोने के लिए कुछ था नहीं और वे रिटर्न टिकट लेकर आए नहीं थे। उन्हें हर हाल में यहीं रहना था। वे मेहनत-मज़दूरी जानते नहीं थे। पढ़े-लिखे थे नहीं। उनका किसी भी तरह के ढंग के काम से कोई लेना-देना नहीं था। वे शक्ल से एकदम जाहिल और खौफनाक थे।\n\nबख्तियार ने अवध में रुककर यहीं के ठिकाने से बिहार में बड़े धावे मारने शुरू किए। मिनहाज़ बताता है-\n\n“शुरुआती बहादुरी से ही उसे भीवली या भगवत नाम की एक जगह का अधिकार मिल गया (यह आज के मिर्जापुर जिले की चुनार तहसील में कहीं है। गंगा किनारे चुनार के किले में पृथ्वीराज चौहान के समय की एक शानदार बावड़ी अब भी है। दूर-दूर तक सब पर कब्जे शुरू हो चुके थे।)।\n\nवह मुनेर और बिहार में धावे मारता और बहुत सा माल लूटकर लाता। इस तरह उसके पास बहुत से घोड़े, हथियार, फौजी साजो-सामान और दौलत जमा हो गई। लूटमार से दौलत इकट्\u200cठा करने में ही वह इतना प्रसिद्ध हो गया कि खिलजियों के कबीले उसके पास इकट्\u200cठा हो गए। तब दिल्ली में सुलतान कुतबुद्दीन को भी उसकी खबर हुई…।”\n\nदिल्ली में जम चुके हमलावर हुक्मरानों की नजर में काबिलियत का पैमाना क्या होगा? हमले, कत्ले-आम, लूटमार, बेरहमी और क्या? दिल्ली में बख्तियार की भारी इज्जतअफजाई हुई। सुलतान ने उसे खिलअत भेजी। यह एक किस्म की सरकारी मान्यता थी कि वह जो करना चाहता है, खुलकर करे। अपनी पूरी ताकत पूरी आजादी से आजमाए। मिनहाज़ की “ब्रेकिंग न्यूज़“ है–\n\n“इस प्रकार दिल्ली की जानिब से इज्जत हासिल करके जनाब बख्तियार ने बिहार पर चढ़ाई की और इस इलाके को रौंदकर रख दिया। दो सालों तक उसने बिहार के कई इलाकों पर हमले किए। वह दो सौ सवारों को लेकर बिहार के किले के दरवाजे पर जा पहुँचा।“\n\nबंगाल की यात्रा के दौरान लखनौती में मिनहाज़ सिराज एक ऐसे आदमी से मिला था, जो बख्तियार के साथ बिहार की बरबादी में साथ रहा था। उसका नाम है- समसामुद्दीन। यह शख्स अपने सगे भाई निजामुद्दीन के साथ बख्तियार की लुटेरी फौज में थे। दोनों ही फरगना के रहने वाले थे। (यह तीन सौ साल बाद दिल्ली पर कब्ज़ा करने वाले मुगल हमलावर बाबर का मूलस्थान है। ताज्जुब नहीं कि बाबर ने अपने उस उजाड़ इलाके से पहले दिल्ली पर हमले और लूट में शामिल हो चुके कुछ तजुर्बेकारों से यहाँ के किस्से सुन रखे हों)।\n\nबिहार के जिस किले के दरवाजे तक जा पहुँचने का ज़िक्र मिनहाज़ ने किया है, उस खबर का स्त्रोत यही समसामुद्दीन है, जो उस समय ‘स्पॉट’ पर मौजूद था। बिहार के लोगों के लिए आज भी नींद उड़ा देने वाली इतिहास की सबसे अहम जानकारी का सबसे भरोसेमंद स्त्रोत। बिहार में वह किले का दरवाजा कहां का है, जहाँ खिलजियों की दाढ़ में खून लगा था।\n\nयह नालंदा की ‘लाइव स्टोरी’ है। सदियों पुराना यह विश्वविद्यालय इतने बड़े इलाके में फैला था कि बख्तियार के जाहिल जांबाज़ इसे ही बिहार का किला समझ रहे थे। मिनहाज़ सिराज की रिपोर्ट–\n\n“जब हमलावर किले के दरवाज़े पर पहुंचे तो जंग शुरू हो गई। इन दोनों भाइयों ने बड़ी बहादुरी दिखाई। मुहम्मद बख्तियार खिलजी किले के पीछे के फाटक पर पहुँच गया और किले पर कब्ज़ा कर लिया तो उन्हें बेहिसाब दौलत वहाँ मिली।\n\nउस जगह के निवासियों में बहुत बड़ी तादाद ब्राह्मणों की थी। वे लोग अपने सिर मुंडाए रहते थे। वे सबके सब मारे गए। वहां उनको बहुत बड़ी तादाद में किताबें मिलीं। जब यह किताबें मुसलमानों ने देखीं तो उन्होंने कुछ हिंदुओं को बुलवाकर उन किताबों को पढ़वाना चाहा, लेकिन सारे ही जानकार मारे जा चुके थे। किताबों से ही यह पता चला कि वह पूरा किला और शहर एक विद्यालय था। हिंदवी में बिहार विद्यालय को कहते हैं।”\n\nजिसे बख्तियार की फौज एक किला समझ रही थी, वह दरअसल नालंदा विश्वविद्यालय ही था। वह सिर घुटाए भिक्षुओं को ब्राह्मण लिख रहा है। बख्तियार खिलजी का यह पहला बड़ा कारनामा था, जो सुलतान कुतबुद्दीन एबक से इज्जत और मान्यता हासिल करने के बाद दोगुने जोश के साथ किया गया था।\n\nवह इस फतह के बाद बेहिसाब लूट का माल लेकर सुलतान के दरबार में हाजिर हुआ। सुलतान इस कदर खुश हुआ कि भरे दरबार में बख्तियार की शानदार इज्जत अफजाई हुई। यह नज़ारा देखकर दिल्ली के बाकी दरबारी बख्तियार से जल-भुन गए। एक जलसे में बख्तियार पर तंज कसे गए। उसे राज भवन में एक हाथी से लड़ने पर मजबूर कर दिया गया।\n\nबख्तियार ने हाथी की सूंड पर गदा मारकर उसे भगा दिया। सुलतान ने इस कामयाबी पर उसे ढेरों इनाम दिए और अपने अमीरों को हुक्म दिया कि वे भी उसे ईनाम दें। वे तोहफे बख्तियार ने वहीं दरबारियों में बांट दिए और बिहार की तरफ लौट गया। देखिए बिहार से कितना गहरा नाता हुआ बख्तियार का?\n\nनालंदा एक आवासीय बौद्ध विश्वविद्यालय था, जो करीब 600 सालों से ज्ञान के सबसे बड़े केंद्र के रूप में बिहार की आन, बान, शान का बेमिसाल नमूना था। करीब 10,000 विद्यार्थी और 3,000 आचार्य बौद्ध भिक्षु वहां रहते थे। मशहूर चीनी यात्री व्हेनसांग सातवीं सदी में यहाँ आकर खुद पढ़ा और फिर पढ़ाया भी।\n\nनालंदा विश्वविद्यालय के आज दिखाई देने वाले खंडहर उसके असली आकार की एक छोटी सी झलक ही पेश करते हैं, जहाँ क्लासरूम से लेकर होस्टल के रूम तक आज भी सब दिखाई देते हैं। इस किलेनुमा विश्वविद्यालय में तीन बहुमंजिला इमारतें सिर्फ लाइब्रेरी की थीं, जहां हजारों पांडुलिपियों का जखीरा मौजूद था। नालंदा की खुदाई में राख की परतें मिलीं हैं, जिनमें जले हुए अनाज भी हाथ आए हैं। राख की परत में और न जाने क्या-क्या खाक हो गया। महीनों तक ये इमारतें आग के शोलों में दहकती रही थीं।\n\nइस भीषण तबाही के बाद इस पूरे इलाके पर बख्तियार खिलजी खौफ का ही दूसरा नाम हो गया। उसके चर्चे बंगाल के पार आज के असम तक जा फैले। मिनहाज सिराज के ब्यौरों में नालंदा की तबाही एक शुरुआती दर्दनाक कहानी भर है। इसके बाद बेखौफ बख्तियार आज के बंगाल में नादिया (नबद्वीप) में राय लखमनिया के राज्य का रुख करता है। बिहार के लिए इतना ही काफी था। हज़ारों साल की विरासत मिट्\u200cटी में मिला दी गई थी। नई पहचानों के साथ अपने ही लोगों की एक नई जमात जड़ें जमाने लगी। पुरखे गड्डमड्\u200cड हो गए।\n\nअखंड बंगाल के समस्त देवी-सज्जन ध्यान दें कि मिनहाज ने उनके लिए क्या लिख रखा है-\n\n“लखमनिया 80 सालों से राज्य कर रहा था। वह गर्भ में ही था, जब उसके पिता की मृत्यु हो गई थी। राजमुकुट माता के पेट पर रख दिया गया था। हिंदू राजा उसके वंश को बहुत इज्ज़त देते आए हैं और वह हिंद का खलीफा समझा जाता है।\n\nएक खास घड़ी में लखमनिया की पैदाइश तय करने के लिए उसकी माँ के दोनों पैर बांधकर सिर नीचा करके लटका दिया गया था। ऐसा उसकी माँ ने ही ज्योतिषियों की सलाह पर किया था कि वह किस घड़ी पैदा होगा तो 80 साल राज्य करेगा। उसके पहले हुआ तो बहुत अशुभ होगा। माँ ने उस घड़ी तक प्रसव को रोककर रखा। लखमनिया ने अपने राज्य में किसी कमज़ोर पर कभी कोई अत्याचार नहीं किया। कोई उससे कुछ मांगता तो वह दानी कम से कम 1 लाख का दान करता था…।”\n\nबख्तियार खिलजी 18 सवारों के साथ नबद्वीप पहुँचता है और एक साजिश के तहत यह अफवाह फैलाई जाती है कि एक बड़ी फौज पीछे आ रही है। अपनी पहचान छुपाकर वह नगर में धोखे से दाखिल हुआ। लोगों ने उसे कारोबारी समझा, जो घोड़े बेचने आए हैं। राय लखमनिया के महल के सामने पहुँचकर सबने अपनी तलवारें खींच लीं। कोई वजह नहीं थी। बस एक और जंग शुरू हो गई।\n\nराय लखमनिया तब भोजन के लिए महल में बैठे ही थे। राजमहल के परिसर में हुए इस अचानक हमले से मचे हाहाकार ने उसे चौकन्ना कर दिया। जब तक वह खुद आकर देखता महल के भीतर कई लोग मार डाले गए। सोने-चांदी के बरतनों में परोसा गया लजीज भोजन फरगाना के सम्सुद्दीन ने अपनी आँखों से देखा था।\n\nराय लखमनिया भूखा ही अपनी जान बचाकर भाग निकला। उसके राज्य का खजाना, हाथी, घोड़े, महल, औरतें, बच्चे, लाव-लश्कर पर बख्तियार ने कब्जा कर लिया। मुसलमानों को इतनी दौलत मिली कि उसका ज़िक्र ही मिनहाज़ की नज़रों में नामुमकिन है। ये मिनहाज़ सिराज के दिल दहलाने वाले ब्यौरे हैं, जो आगे हमें बताता है-\n\n“मुहम्मद बख्तियार ने नबद्वीप पर कब्जा जमा लिया। फिर उसे बरबाद करके छोड़ दिया और उस जगह पर, जो अब लखनौती के नाम से मशहूर है, अपनी राजधानी बनाया। उसने फिर आसपास के सूबों पर कब्जे जमाए। हर जगह अपने नाम के सिक्के चलाए। उसकी और उसके अमीरों की कोशिशों से मदरसे और मस्जिदें बनने लगीं। बंगाल की लूट के माल में से बहुत कुछ उसने सुलतान कुतबुद्दीन को भी भेजा।”\n\nनालंदा और नबद्वीप की बरबादी के बाद भी उसके कत्ल, कब्जे और लूट की कहानी चलती रही। तलवार के जोर पर इस्लाम के फैलाव की यह ताकतवर शुरुआत थी। लालच और डर से जैसे भी हो, धर्मांतरण का संक्रमण यहाँ भी तेज़ी से फैला।\n\nहमें हैरत नहीं होनी चाहिए कि कुछ ऐसे भी स्थानीय मुसलमान आज मिल जाएं, जो बड़े फख्र से मुहम्मद बख्तियार से अपनी बल्दियतें जोड़ते हों। बहुत मुमकिन है कि अपने बदकिस्मत हिंदू पुरखों का पता उनकी याददाश्त से साफ ही हो गया हो या वे ऐसा जाहिर करें कि उनका मूल निवास प्रमाणपत्र तो फरगाना का है।\n\nबिहार की गुमशुदा याददाश्त में नालंदा और विक्रमशिला जैसी महान विरासत मिट्\u200cटी के टीलों में खोई रहीं लेकिन मुहम्मद बख्तियार खिलजी का नाम बड़ी हिफाजत से महफूज रह गया। कितनी अजीब बात है कि बिहार के जागरूक, प्रबुद्ध और कृतज्ञ नागरिकों ने आजादी के 72 साल बाद भी अपने एक पुराने शहर को उसके नाम पर बनाए रखा है- “बख्तियारपुर जंक्शन!“\n\nनालंदा की 800 साल पुरानी लाश के दर्शन के लिए आज भी हम नालंदा के हत्यारे के नाम से चमक रहे इसी बेसुध शहर से होकर गुज़रते हैं।'<br />Author: 'lustninja'  id: 'cyln1t'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cyln1t/मनहज_सरज_क_रल_स_बखतयरपर_जकशन_तक_क_सफर_भरत_म_इसलम/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Story of Gilgit-Baltistan that belonged to J&amp;K and how it was separated and kept under direct supervision and control of Pakistan to favor the CPEC, China since 1962, after the Sino-Pak agreement of 1963 is occupying nearly 19% of the territory of J&amp;K which includes vital territory of Northern Area'<br />Body: "**Understanding the Geography of Gilgit-Baltistan wrt Northern Area**\n\nGilgit-Baltistan (GB) has an unfortunate and tragic history as a region which is a part of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir but under Pakistan’s illegal occupation since 1947. Northern Areas is the name given by Pakistan after 1947 to the area comprising GilgitBaltistan. **This area has been neglected, isolated, disfranchised and its status kept deliberately ambiguous and undefined.** None of the constitutions of Pakistan of 1956, 1962, 1972 and 1973 recognised the Northern Areas as a part of Pakistan. Likewise, the 1974 interim constitution of Pakistan Occupied Kashimir (POK) also did not include Gilgit and Baltistan as its part. \n\nThe total geographical area of the State of Jammu and Kashmir is 222,236 sq. km. Of this, at present, 101,437 sq. km is under India’s administrative control. Parts of the territory of the Jammu and Kashmir are under illegal Pakistani/Chinese occupation. The POK, which consists of the so-called Azad Kashmir (herein after referred to as Azad Kashmir only to differentiate it from rest of PoK) and Gilgit-Baltistan, covers an area of 78,114 sq. km. Of this, the territory of Gilgit-Baltistan (Northern Areas), is five times the area of so-called Azad Kashmir. This apart, the area under Chinese control is 42,685 sq. Km, which includes 5,180 sq. km illegally ceded to China by Pakistan in 1963.\n\nIn 1970, Hunza and Nagar, a part of Azad Kashmir, were amalgamated with Gilgit-Baltistan. In 1982, Zia-ul-Haq proclaimed that the people of Northern Areas were not a part of the state of Jammu and Kashmir and extended his martial law to Northern Areas but not to the Azad Kashmir. With this act, he drew a clear distinction between Northern Areas and Azad Kashmir.\n\n&gt;*Twelve days later on April 15, 1982, the Minister of External Affairs, Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao, informed the Lok Sabha that Northern Areas are ‘Juridically and constitutionally part of the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir.* \n\nIndia lodged an official complaint, with Pakistan Foreign Office and the Government was awaiting a response of the Pakistan Government. There was no official reply to this but Pakistan did not appoint an observer from Northern Areas to the Majlis-e-Shoora. ( Also General Zia had announced that three observers from Northern Areas would be appointed to the Federal Council or the Majlis-e-Shoora.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Separation of Gilgit-Baltistan from Azad Kashmir**\n\nRight from the beginning, Pakistan separated Gilgit-Baltistan from Azad Kashmir so as to maintain greater control over it. The people of GB filed a writ petition challenging the position of Pakistan on the status of Northern Areas in the High Court of Azad Kashmir in the 1990s in what came to be known as the Muskeen case.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***The High Court of Azad Kashmir decided that the Northern Areas were a part of Azad Kashmir and its administrative control should be with the government of Azad Kashmir (POK) and not the government of Pakistan.*** \n\n**Pakistan did not implement that decision and had it vacated by its Supreme Court**, which maintained that the High Court had no jurisdiction to issue any such order in the matter. It described the matter as political rather than a legal issue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gilgit Baltistan Reform Order 2018**\n\nIn June 2018, the outgoing Abbasi Government of Pakistan decided to make some changes through the Gilgit Baltistan Reform Order 2018, which replaced the earlier self governance order of 2009. Under this new order, all powers earlier exercised by the Gilgit-Baltistan Council, including passing legislation regarding minerals, hydropower and tourism sectors, were shifted to the Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly. \n\nThis order vests huge powers in Pakistan Prime Minister who in fact is far stronger then the Assembly. Opposition parties in Gilgit-Baltistan protested against this order as they felt that the new order enhanced the role of the Federal Government rather than resulting in any substantive devolution. They dubbed the order as Prime Minister centric. \n\n***The government of India also protested.*** \n\n&gt;*The MEA statement mentioned that “the entire  5 state of Jammu and Kashmir which also includes the so-called ‘Gilgit-Baltistan’ areas is an integral part of India” and “any action to alter the status of any part of the territory under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan has no legal basis whatsoever, and is completely unacceptable.”* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The role of Chine in China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and Gilgit-Baltistan** \n\nThe CPEC passes through POK which is a part of the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir. The shortest route from Gwadar to Kashgar runs through Panjgur, Quetta, Zhob, Dera Ismail Khan, and then into Punjab through Mianwali, onto Islamabad, and then the KKH to Xinjiang/Sinkiang. There were reports that China was not comfortable about the route passing through Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on account of protests against CPEC and the security situation prevalent in those areas. It was decided by the Pakistan Government on account of these considerations and because of reservations expressed by the governments of Baluchistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh to change the alignment of he route of CPEC, so that it could pass mainly through Punjab. As a result, the **CPEC is being dubbed as the China Punjab Economic Corridor.**\n\nChina was equally concerned about regular protests in Gilgit-Baltistan about CPEC as 600 km of the proposed 2,000 km Kasghar-Gwadar corridor passes through the region. Consequently, there has been apprehension that the pace of progress of implementation of the project could get affected. \n\n[CPEC route from Gwadar to Xinjiang\\/Sinkiang](https://i.redd.it/wj3bea7b81k31.png)\n\nNote: ***Couldn't get the route from K2K to Xinjiang/Sinkiang.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now comes the Chinese Role in Gilgit-Baltistan** \n\nPakistan favoured greater federal control over Gilgit-Baltistan on Chinese insistence.Some other media reports revealed that there are more than 5,000 Chinese troops across the Middle-East and Asia to protect China’s economic corridor. The largest number (1800) in this list is deployed on the China-Pakistan corridor. Many of them could be stationed in the POK, and be a cause for concern in India.\n\n***Here is more on it*** \\- [https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/18/1827428\\_re-nyt-story-about-chinesetroops-in-pakistan-snorthern.html](https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/18/1827428_re-nyt-story-about-chinesetroops-in-pakistan-snorthern.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So why was Gilgit-Baltistan separated from Azad Kashmir and kept under direct supervision and control of Pakistan ?**\n\nAnswer is CPEC\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Agreement of 2 March 1963** \n\nPakistan transfers or cedes areas to China in 1963, south of the Mintaka Pass, belonged to Hunza. Border Agreement of 2 March 1963 changed the alignment of the boundary line between the Sinkiang province of China and the contiguous area under the actual control of Pakistan. \n\n&gt;India protested to both Pakistan and China about this agreement. Ceding territory to China was not even discussed in Gilgit-Baltistan as it did not have any elected assembly of its own. Articles I, II and VI of the 1963 Sino-Pakistan Agreement, accepted that the area covered by the Agreement was disputed. \n\nIf you look at the Article VI, China concedes that the area is not under the sovereign control of Pakistan, a fact that becomes important when seen in the context of the CPEC. Both history and sovereignty issues do not favour Chinese arguments here. They are, therefore, using commercial arguments for their political and strategic investments in Pakistan for transiting through POK\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe location of Giligit Baltistan is unique. In addition to India and Pakistan it has borders with Afghanistan and China. India’s stand about GB being a part of the Indian State Jammu &amp; Kashmir has been consistent. \n\nPakistan has shown greater concern for the territory of Jammu and Kashmir it occupied than for the people living there. It is quite evident the way Pakistani governments handled the issue. None of the governments at the helm have ever shown any genuine interest to address the issues pertaining to the economic and the political interests of the people of the area. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How Demography was changed**\n\nThe demography of the area has been changed. Outsiders were settled in this area to achieve this objective. In 1948, Shias and Ismailis constituted 85 per cent of the population of the area. Today it is around 50 per cent. Shias, Ismailis and Sunnis—lived peacefully in communal harmony till the 1970s in the Kashmiri tradition prevalent before 1947. Differences started to emerge from 1975 onwards. \n\nSkardu has a predominantly Shia population. The Sunnis have lived mostly in Diamir, and the Ismailis in Hunza. **The first sectarian clash occurred in 1975 when a Shia Muharrum procession was fired at from a Sunni mosque in Gilgit**. The next major clash was in 1998 over the sighting of the moon to mark the end of Ramadan. By this time, sectarian violence had become a common occurrence, and manifested itself even more after the killing of foreign mountaineers in 2014. \n\nNow the Shias and Sunnis have started living in separate areas and this has adversely affected cohesion\n\nThe Karakoram Highway (KKH) linking Pakistan with Gilgit-Baltistan has resulted in the influx of weapons and drugs and attacks by religious militia into the region, leading to a change in demography. The non-violent Ismaili community also started becoming targets of attack. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; ***The desire of the people of Giligit-Baltistan to be connected with India has always been prevented and suppressed by Pakistan.***\n\n Two land routes—Kargil and Leh on the Indian side of the LoC connect with Skardu and Khaplu (PoK side) but Pakistan has not permitted interaction on these routes. \n\nNorthern Areas were separated from rest of PoK to ensure greater Federal Control. There has been pandering to China’s concerns. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***China since 1962 and after the Sino-Pak agreement of 1963 is occupying nearly 19 per cent of the territory of J&amp;K which includes some vital territory of Northern Area.*** \n\nChina and Pakistan have been using the territory of the area to the determent of Indian interest. \n\nThe area and suffering of the people of GB has been completely neglected just like how the international community  closed their eyes to the genocide of Kashmiri Hindus. It is high time they took note of the sufferings faced by the people of Gilgit-Baltistan and the people of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir , including the Northern Areas which was once part of the state of Jammu&amp;Kashmir.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Sources:***\n\n***Based on a speech delivered by the author at the Annamalai University on 9th August 2018.

In fact, my surname is Dhar, which is originally Kashmiri. Dhar is not a native Bengali title. \n\nAnyway, so why does India have such double standard based on religion? Why does it allow muslims to have special rights and privileges? It seems like India is still stuck in the past of USA's segregated policy like the Jim Crow Laws, where blacks and whites were treated differently and segregated. Why does India not follow USA's example and add Amendments to The Constitution? In the beginning, we did not give black Americans freedom, citizenship, nor right to vote. Same for native Americans as well as women. But they added special amendments to provide these rights and always interpret the law to evolve with time and culture. Does India do that? \n\nWhy is it legal for Muslims to have multiple wives but not for other religion? Why was triple talak legal? It's mind boggling for me, as an American, why India still holds different segregated laws based on religion. It's such an outdated and regressive behavior. America did that based on race and gender, then abolished it. Why doesnt Indian follow the same policy? If you're a citizen of India, then all laws must apply equally to you, regardless of your religions or racial upbringing.

BJP is in power, gonna stay for another 5 years, yet the propaganda doesn't stop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;China is far ahead of us because it's an authoritarian state. So, we should become like them.\n\nPremise itself is questionable. China grew because of its manufacturing sector. There's no proof, that it wouldn't have seen similar or better development if it were a democracy. Anyway, here are few fundamental flaws with authoritarianism&gt; \n\nFirst of all, if our objective is development, a shift from democracy to authoritarianism is costly as fuck. China had to go through decades of churn, silencing opposition, homogenizing population, killing millions to progress in this path. If we choose authoritarianism now, it's like stopping in the middle of 100m race to change your boots. We also went through a lot of churn in democracy, established strong institutions and of course, it took a longer churn for us, because we chose the hard path. \n\nSecond, authoritarianism heavily depends on the leader because all the power is vested on him/her. We have Modi now, who you might believe is infallible. But what about next gen, next to next gen. Because once you go authoritarian, you can't go back without intense bloodshed through a rebellion or foreign subjugation. This is precisely the reason major kingdoms fell in India including Guptas, Vijayanagara and even fucking Marathas. The last generation of leaders before fall of empire were stupid as fuck and there was no way to topple the shitheads. In the end they have too much power, too little brains. All we have to do is to wait for a dickhead to come to power in China, and we will zoom ahead.\n\nFinally, one of the main objective of the regime is to stay in power and it will do \\*anything\\* to hold on to power. And it also has the power to do \\*anything\\* because there are no checks and balances. That anything can be taking your land, wife and life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Tukde Tukde Gang. Congress is filled with pro-Pakistan people. Congress wants to destroy India.\n\nFFS, we had 70 years under Congress, won two wars against Pak, eliminated dozens of terrorists, quelled insurgencies in Kashmir, Khalistan, Nagaland, Maoism in their fucking rule. We started from dirt poor GDP numbers, GDP per capita numbers, education level, mortality rate, absence of health care, industries post British rule and reached where we are pre-Vajpayee/ pre-Modi. The fact of the matter is every fucking party which contested elections in those 70 years lost. So, are all Indians anti-India or were all Indians dumb till 2014 to not realize Congress is pro-Pak and suddenly became smart to elect Modiji? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Gandhiji sax, Nehruji sax. REEEE\n\nGandhi has flaws, but he did take the movement to grassroots. Nehru has flaws, but he put India on okayish path unlike our neighbors where a Govt. was never able to complete their fucking term. Anyway, read about Bose's views, Patel's views, Madan Mohan Mallavya's views or any leader of that time (you admire)'s views on both Gandhi and Nehru. Even if they point out flaws or have differences, they would always have so many positive things to say about both of them. Bose gave Gandhi the title 'Father of the nation' FFS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Commies, leftists, anarchists. REEEEE\n\nBhagat singh is anarchist, atheist commie. Bose is commie. It's only reasonable to think, 'everyone should have good life, Govt. should provide them one'. And takes a complicated mental endeavor to say free market capitalism is better, so Govt. should indeed provide tax subsidies to industries, and the ripple effect will lead to development of rest of people. \n\nAnyway, unchecked capitalism leads to huge imbalances in society, detrimental to environment and leads to exploitation of populace. Think of typical land owner vs. 100s of agricultural workers. Without the free education by Govt. schools, or free medicare, the worker's children would never have upliftment in any possible scenario. \n\nIn the end, 'left' is what balances the 'right', and without 'left', right will destroy India as much as vice-versa. And the left in India is so minuscule, yet IT cell makes an enemy out of it, as you need enemies for votes. No one cared of what happened in JNU earlier (If there was harm, Govt. interfered. UPA was the one which cleared naxals from WB and Jharkhand and Andhra). Right now, left is just to create an illusion of enemy, so that it can be exploited for votes (atleast outside Bengal and Kerala). Prove me wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Savarkar. REEEEE\n\nThere were many many prisoners in Kala Paani who died disgusting deaths there and who didn't write amnesty letters. Savarkar is just one. Why is he glorified for his Kala Paani struggle?

"Being thus of  such vast extent, it seems  well-nigh to embrace the whole of the northern tropic zone  of the  earth, and in fact at the extreme point of  India the gnomon of the  sundial may frequently  be observed to cast no shadow, while the  constellation of the Bear is by night invisible, and in  the remotest  parts even Ai\'cturns disappears  from view. Consistently with this, it  is also  slated that shadows there fall to the southward.\n\nUse this as copypasta whenever a Pakistani claims that Pakistan—which is  the land around Indus—is the real India or that India got its name from a  province of Pakistan.

      <li>Title::: 'Just how did the British steal from India. A brief explanation of the systems and flows of the Raj that allowed the loot'<br />Body: 'Many big numbers and statements are thrown around, "the British looted $75tn", "the British stole from India" and so on and so forth, the question though is, how was this actually done? The below is a very brief primer on how the British exploited India. \n\nThe short answer is brutally simple and effective. \n\n*Suck out raw materials from India, make it a captive market for finished British goods*\n\nBut the question is then, how will a bankrupt India pay for the British imports? And that\'s where we come across the first set of complications and the start of the web of British trade with London in the centre. \n\n**The triangle**\n\nTo allow Indian markets the ability to consume British products, you first need to generate some form of income. \n\nEnter China and the Opium wars. \n\nA brief on the Opium wars though as it is largely unknown to most people. One way the EIC funded it\'s expansionist wars in India in the 1750\'s was by illegally exporting Opium from India into China. By the late 1770\'s it was Illegally exporting some 300,000 KG of Indian Opium into China. To put things into context Escobar used to smuggle about 1,00,000 kg of cocaine every year into the USA. The EIC smuggled in 3 times that much and we are just beginning b\n\nThe Chinese protested, ofc they did. They raided ships carrying cocaine, imposed laws banning it\'s usage, but the EIC protested to the British govt strongly it\'s rights to smuggle Opium and things continued. \n\nBy 1830 the British (and Americans now) were smuggling some 2.3mn tonnes of Opium every year. That is 23 times what Escobar managed. \n\nApologists to British war crimes can\'t even argue that this was all illegal as the full support of the British govt was behind this. Even a direct letter to Queen Victoria, pleading for the British to stop this trade fellow deaf years. \n\nAll the cocaine then used to be shipped to Canton (it was a free port under control by the Western govts) from where it would be trafficked inland. After all the pleas and protests by the Chinese govt fell on deaf years and with an Opium epidemic caused by cheaply available Opium started to ravage the whole of south China, the Emperor had enough and ordered his troops into Canton to seize and destroy all opium stocks. \n\nThis triggered the first Opium war. \n\nBy the 1850\'s Britain was exporting some 6mn tonnes (60 times of Escobar) Opium from India to China. \n\nThis again caused a backlash in China and the 2nd Opium War which... amongst other things resulted in the legalisation of Opium consumption. \n\nBy the 1890\'s Opium exports touched 9mn tonnes (90 times Escobar)\n\nAnd this was the source of money for India to buy British imports. \n\nIn India land "reforms" (they weren\'t reforms), taxation "reforms"(not reforms again) meant that from 1780-1840 there had been a crazy shift of cultivation patterns. It went from a balance of food and cash crops to a priority given to Cash crops (Opium, Cotton, Indigo etc). This was one of the leading causes for the genocidal famine mortality rates but more on that later. \n\nIn a nutshell, Indian large scale farmers acquired land from bankrupt farmers (Famines mostly) and started pushing cash crops &gt; more Famines &gt; more bankrupt farmers &gt; more land purchased for almost free &gt; more cash crops &gt; more Famines. \n\nThese exports then earned enough cash to purchase British Imports. \n\nIn 1780 India was an exporting nation. By 1820 it was exporting ZERO finished goods and importing everything from Britain. \n\nChina till 1800 was the largest export nation on earth (Angus Maddison) and by 1830 a net importing nation. \n\nIn summary It was a triangular trade. \n\nIndia exported Opium, Cotton Yarn to China &gt; this enabled it to earn enough forex &gt; purchase British goods. \n\nNow mind you the British took away Indian cotton yarn (the raw material) to Britain at fixed rock bottom prices and this was spun into coarse finished cotton that came back to India. \n\nEnd it part 1. \n\nPart 2 I will cover the gold standard scam, cause for famine mortality rates and a summary to tie it all in.'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'cxcqkf'<br />Score:104<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cxcqkf/just_how_did_the_british_steal_from_india_a_brief/</li>

Our relationship isn\'t the most stable, my GF has anger issues and I am not the most easily forgiving person either. We fight quite a bit. A few weeks ago, after a major fight my girlfriend told me "let\'s not commit right now, let\'s see each other but not commit" I was okay with that, I don\'t really love her or anything, and I keep thinking about other women all the time. Additionally, I\'m a virgin while she\'s had a relationship before and lost her virginity in that. I\'ve always wanted to have my first time with a girl I actually loved and cared about, and possibly was married to. \n\n\nWe\'ve made out in the past. Indulged in some fingering but that was it. Today, we decided to meet for a short while in our favorite spot where we always do. We sat and talked. Long story short, one thing led to another and we ended up having sex. Being my first time, it was all over in 5-7 minutes. After I was finished, I sat there in a daze. My GF asked for water and wanted to clean up. I sat there, as if I\'d been stupefied. It took her repeating herself thrice before I paid attention to her. \n\nEven as I type this, it is very difficult for me to come to terms with my feelings about the entire affair. Even after we bid each other goodbye and I walked to my apartment, I walked in a daze, where I was mechanically doing everything without really thinking about it. I looked around and I literally had trouble perceiving the world. Its like, I took in the sights and sounds but my brain wasn\'t processing them.\n\nI feel no joy. I feel no happiness that I had sex barely 2 hours ago. All I feel is a void, where some sense of gratification should be. I don\'t love this girl. We fight so much. And who knows what complications this might lead to.  I want some love, I want to be able to look into a woman\'s eyes and know she\'s the one for me as I have sex with her. I don\'t feel this way about my current gf. And I hate this feeling. This is why I had refused to have sex with her so far. I have never felt so distant from her as I do right after having had sex with her. This is a bad sign, right?\n\nI don\'t want to say she made me do it. True, it was she who took her pants off and pulled me towards her, and guided my penis inside her. True, but I was there . I could have stopped her. And she probably wouldn\'t have resisted. I did not. I coould have said no, but for some reason I didn\'t.\n\nShe is very happy about us finally having sex. I am not. It just feels wrong.\n\nI feel like I\'m making a big deal out of nothing, but IDK. I\'m not sure who to turn to with this. I\'m a man. I\'ll probably be told to shut up and be happy i\'m getting action. But I don\'t feel happy about this.

His conviction in India, created a huge diplomatic row between the Gov of France and Britain because France believed itself to be a land of free and Savarkar had managed to escape from the ship which was transporting him from London to Bombay and was actually on French soil when a French policeman handed him over to British police again. So it was a case of political asylum from France\'s point of view. \n\n\n\n\n4. Winston Churchill himself was monitoring all the proceedings against Savarkar, because he was soooo dangerous for British Empire.\n\n\n\n \n5. Indian National Congress\'s co founder sir Henry cotton came in support of Savarkar but the rest of the congress, Indians and whites included, condemned him for that and so much that there were calls for his knighthood to be taken away.\n\n\n\n\n6.

      <li>Title::: 'Purification of History undertaken by Marxists in West Bengal by removing anymention of atrocities committed by Muslim rulers'<br />Body: "I was reading Eminent Historians by Arun Shourie and there's a brilliant chapter where \n\n&gt; ‘All the West Bengal Government recognised secondary school Headmasters are being informed,’ it begins, ‘that in History textbooks recommended by this Board for Class IX the following amendments to the chapter on the medieval period have been decided after due discussions and review by experts.’\n\n&gt; The accompanying pages contain two columns: aushuddho – impurity, or error – and shuddho. One has just to glance through the changes to see the objective the progressives are trying to achieve through their ‘objective’, ‘rational’ approach to the writing of history. Here are some of the changes.\n\n&gt; Page 140: Aushuddho – ‘In Sindhudesh the Arabs did not describe Hindus as Kafir. They had banned cow-slaughter.’ Shuddho – ‘Delete, “They had banned cow-slaughter”.’\n\n&gt; Page 141: Aushuddho – ‘Fourthly, using force to destroy Hindu temples was also an expression of aggression. Fifthly, forcibly marrying Hindu women and converting them to Islam before marriage was another way to propagate the fundamentalism of the ulema.’ Shuddho: though the ashuddho column reproduces the sentences only from ‘Fourthly….,’ the Board directs that the entire matter from ‘Secondly…. to ulema’ be deleted.\n\n&gt; Page 89: Aushuddho – ‘He looted valuables worth 2 crore dirham from the Somnath temple and used the Shivling as a step leading up to the masjid in Ghazni.’ Shuddho – ‘Delete “and used the Shivling as a step leading up to the masjid in Ghazni.”’\n\n&gt; Page 112: Aushuddho – ‘Hindu-Muslim relations of the medieval ages constitute a very sensitive issue. The non-believers had to embrace Islam or death.’ Shuddho – All matter on pages 112–13 to be deleted.\n\n\n&gt; Page 113: Aushuddho – ‘According to Islamic law non-Muslims will have to choose between death and Islam. Only the Hanafis allow non-Muslims to pay jaziya in exchange for their lives.’ Shuddho – Rewrite this as follows: ‘By paying jaziya to Alauddin Khalji, Hindus could lead normal lives.’ Moreover, all the subsequent sentences ‘Qazi….’, ‘Taimur’s arrival in India….’ to be deleted.\n\n&gt; Page 113: Aushuddho – ‘Mahmud was a believer in the rule of Islam whose core was “Either Islam or death”.’ Shuddho – Delete.\n\n&gt; Page 154: Aushuddho – ‘As dictated by Islam, there were three options for non-Muslims: get yourself converted to Islam; pay jaziya; accept death. In an Islamic State non-Muslims had to accept one of these three options.’ Shuddho – Delete.\n\n&gt; Page 161: Aushuddho – ‘The early Sultans were eager to expand the sway of Islam by forcibly converting Hindus into Islam.’ Shuddho – Delete.\n\n&gt; The most extensive deletions are ordered in regard to the chapter on ‘Aurangzeb’s policy on religion’. Every allusion to what he actually did to the Hindus, to their temples, to the very leitmotif of his rule – to spread the sway of Islam – are directed to be excised from the book. He is to be presented as one who had an aversion – an ordinary sort of aversion, almost a secular one – to music and dancing, to the presence of prostitutes in the court, and that it is these things he banished. The only allusion to his having done anything in regard to Islam which is allowed to remain is that ‘By distancing himself from Akbar’s policy of religious tolerance and policy of equal treatment, Aurangzeb caused damage to Mughal rule.’\n\n&gt; Page 145: Aushuddho – ‘Apart from this, because Islam used extreme, inhuman means to establish itself in India, this became an obstacle for the coming together of Indian and Islamic cultures.’ Shuddho – Delete.\n\n&gt; Page 40: Aushuddho – ‘Muslims used to take recourse to torture and inhuman means to force their religious beliefs and practices on Indians.’ Shuddho – Delete.\n\n&gt; ***Page 41: Aushuddho – ‘The liberal, humane elements in Islam held out hope for oppressed Hindus.’ Shuddho – The entire paragraph beginning with ‘the caste system among Hindus…. was attacked’ is to be deleted. Instead write, ‘There was no place for casteism in Islam. Understandably, the influence of Islam created an awakening among Hindus against caste discrimination. Lower caste oppressed Hindus embraced Islam.’***\n\n&gt; Page 130: Aushuddho – ‘That is why he adopted the policy of converting Hindus to Islam – so as to increase the number of Muslims. Those Hindus who refused to discard their religion were indiscriminately massacred by him or his generals.’ Shuddho – Delete.\n\n&gt; In a word, no forcible conversions, no massacres, no destruction of temples. Just that Hinduism had created an exploitative, casteist society. Islam was egalitarian. Hence the oppressed Hindus embraced Islam!\nMuslim historians of those times are in raptures at the heap of kafirs who have been dispatched to hell. Muslim historians are forever lavishing praise on the ruler for the temples he has destroyed, for the hundreds of thousands he has got to see the light of Islam. Law books like The Hedaya prescribe exactly the options to which these little textbooks alluded. All whitewashed away.\n\n&gt; Objective whitewash for objective history. And today if anyone seeks to restore truth to these textbooks, the shout, ‘Communal rewriting of history’."<br />Author: 'EmptyFollowing8'  id: 'cx94x7'<br />Score:51<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cx94x7/purification_of_history_undertaken_by_marxists_in/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'The Anti-poor, Anti-student Bill that Legalizes Quackery and Reduces clinical skills of doctors (if that were possible).'<br />Body: '\\*\\*TLDR people : just glance through the headings and the bold font. Please DO read those, it is a very important matter.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBetween Teen Talak, Chandrayan, nationwide floods, Article 370 and Economic crash most of you must not have noticed the National Medical Commission Bill (NMC) that was sneaked into the parliament and passed in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha recently. This bill that shakes the healthcare system of the country to the core (and not in a good way) was vehemently opposed by doctors all over India, by black bands, marches, burning copies of the bill and when all else failed, even strikes. Many even got arrested during the protests. Yet, it never even made it to the National news. And the bill passed with barely any opposition. So what is it, why doctors are protesting it and is it really that bad?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me save you a lot of time - YES! But that is my opinion. Please feel free to form your own opinion. I am attaching a copy of the bill so you can read it yourself if you want,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \\[[http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/185\\\\\\_2019\\\\\\_LS\\\\\\_Eng.pdf](http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/185\\_2019\\_LS\\_Eng.pdf)\\]([http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/185\\_2019\\_LS\\_Eng.pdf](http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/185_2019_LS_Eng.pdf)) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are some of the points in the bill that I found very disturbing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# Legalization of quackery : \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst please understand that under the current system, students after clearing +2 medical undergo MBBS entrance exams through NEET. After clearing one of the most rigorous competitive exams in existence, they study under gruelling circumstances (in govt colleges and a handful of private colleges) for 4.5 years. The exams every year and after passing Final year MBBS, they have to do one more year of very hard training (internship). After that they have to pass yet another exam called the NEET PG entrance exam to even be able to practice as an MBBS doctor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso note that India has a massive shortage of doctors. According to \\*\\*WHO, the doctor patient\\*\\* ratio needs to be \\*\\*1:1000.\\*\\* Note that WHO specifies this for government Allopathic doctors. In India this ratio of government allopathic doctors is \\*\\*1:10,189\\*\\*. Which means that there is a massive \\*\\*shortage\\*\\* of doctors - amost \\*\\*6 lakh\\*\\* doctors in the country. This shortage is found in \\*\\*both urban and rural areas\\*\\* though the shortage in r\\*\\*ural areas is more severe.\\*\\* However, the urban areas are not doing that good either. This is especially when the entire rural population is also seeking healthcare in the urban areas due to \\*\\*lack of basic facilities and infrastructure\\*\\* in the rural areas. These deficiencies would not allow for much healthcare provision even if doctors were there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, note that according to WHO standards, India \\*\\*lacks 2 million nurses\\*\\* as well. WHO has issued warnings to India regarding its dire state of healthcare and the crisis faced by the people. So the "brilliant" (massive sarcasm) solution is this NMC bill was Community Healthcare Providers. We already have a similar system of ANM\'s that kind of fit the description, so why is this a problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem lies in the \\*\\*language of the bill\\*\\* which is \\*\\*very vague\\*\\*.  It states that "Any person connected to the allopathic heathcare system" can provide "primary and preventive healthcare" "for a limited period of time"  after a "6 month training program". They can work without supervision here. However, under secondary and tertiary hospitals, they will have to work under doctor\'s suprvision.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook at the statements in quotes. What does \\*\\*"any person connected to allopathic healthcare"\\*\\* mean? Can an ambulance driver get this accredition? Can a ward boy get it? The bill makes no specification. It does not specify the minimum qualification needed for the course. (I could be wrong but I did not find any description). It does not state any experience required or previous job status - nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnext it talks about a \\*\\*6-month training\\*\\* program. Again, training for what? What courses will be included, What these people will be trained in. How they will be trained. Nothing is specified.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext it talks about providing \\*\\*primary healthcare\\*\\*. From what I understand. Primary healthcare means the treatment one gets at the first point of contact with the healthcare system. Generally, In sane countries where stuff like people\'s health is important, this means a contact with GP - a general practitioner or physician that can provide basic treatment for basic things. But In a country like India where "Superpeciality Hospitals" are the first point of contact for people, the lines between primary and tertiary level healthcare are blurred. \\*\\*The bill does not define what Primary and Preventive medicine mean\\*\\*. It is not understood or implied because as I said, anything can be considered primary when given at first point of contact with healthcare. So what treatment can the Community healthcare providers provide? Can they write cardio medications? Can they write pediatric medications? Note that even MBBS students cannot write super specialty treatments or even a head CT to look for brain problems unless under supervision. Even PG students (3 more years after MBBS and internship which makes them a specialist) cannot fiddle with other departments\' treatment. And for good reason - the medication and treatment is way more complicated than making a Chandrayan rocket. SO can these people write that? Can they perform operations, which MBBS students cannot do unsupervised? Even PG and beyond need supervision. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoctors are strictly regulated when it comes to ultrasound to prevent sex determination and female feticides. (I am not trying to open a debate about whether that is good or bad. Doctors, please focus on the issue at hand) What is the guarantee that these people will not just determine the sex? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, these people are supposed to be practicing in rural areas. There is \\*\\*no mechanism to make sure\\*\\* that they will actually \\*\\*practice in rural areas\\*\\* and not just peddle pills in urban areas. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, while doctors are bound to write generics and single-dose combinations, there are \\*\\*zero regulations\\*\\* in place for these Community Healthcare providers. (CHP) How is this in line with the intention to decrease unregulated indiscriminate use of drugs?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, how much time is "limited period of time"? 3 months, 1 year, 10 years. 100 years? Nothing is specified. Even doctors have to renew their registration every 3 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlready people illegally practice allopathy and kill so many people and give them lifelong problems. The govt has claimed to "stop all quackery" with this bill. Well yeah, this is one way of doing it. Legalize quackery so there won\'t be any quacks left. Note that the reports of how well these CHP\'s do are mostly self-reported and up to now have been for things like uncomplicated delivery and diarrhea. If you talk to doctors they will tell you that in uncomplicated deliveries (which form a large chunk of the deliveries) you have to just catch the baby. The baby and the mother do all the hard work for you. In many cases of bleeding, a simple massage can help stop it. So that is not a very complicated thing to be entrusting to the community. However, comparing that to all primary healthcare is very wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, note that doctors are \\*\\*not opposed\\*\\* to the idea of community health practitioners \\*\\*in principle\\*\\*. Like I said ANM\'s already exist. However, how the system is set up and managed is the issue. Something more sensible would be welcome. For example. 6-month training program for a nurse with more than 7 years work experience in an MCI approved medical college/hospital specifically to help prevent Acute Encephalitis Syndrome and provide aftercare once the kid has been discharged from the medical college. The appointment should be for 3 years pending renewal and the power to practise should be void outside the specified areas. Add to that some basic management like ORS for diarrhoea, basic hygiene education, women\'s health education, checking BP, temperature or changing dressings etc (which nurses already do in most hospitals). However, management should be according to doctor\'s prescription and on any changes immediate referral and contact with the doctor. I don\'t think many doctors would be opposed to that form of a system. However, this vague wildfire like scenario is extremely scary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegarding \\*\\*no\\*\\* \\*\\*supervision\\*\\* \\\\- why would anyone want to work under supervision when they can work unregulated alone? This will take away nurses etc from the hospitals. As I already mentioned that there is a massive shortage of them, the conditions in hospitals will become even worse as more and more of the nurses (and other professionals or non-professionals) set out to practice legalized quackery. This system should be started after ensuring an increase in the existing personnel, not just redirecting them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want \\*\\*more rural practitioners\\*\\*, research has shown that the best way is to \\*\\*make the system more inclusive\\*\\* of people born and brought up in rural areas. The medical profession in India is barely in the reach of urban lower middle-class families. Rural population cal only dream of becoming doctors, here in such an exclusive system. But more on that later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, for the people who cite \\*\\*WHO recommendation for CHP\\*\\*? - Note that WHO stated this for \\*\\*very poor countries\\*\\* that cannot train doctors due to complete lack of funds or war etc. They also stated that this is \\*\\*highly dependent on the kind of training\\*\\* received by the workers and care should be taken to ensure proper training for the work. Many countries much much poorer than India have managed a much better healthcare system without the use of these things. In India ( the 7th largest economy set to be a "5 trillion dollar economy" (ahem, ahem), what sense does it make to adopt measures for very poor and war-torn countries when we can afford better systems. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only sense I can make of it is that it will allow the govt to artificially inflate the numbers on the paper and say that they doubled or trebled the number of "allopathic" healthcare providers without having lift a finger. The situation on the ground will not change and might even become worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# 2. The Bridge Course \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe notorious bridge course is back. This allows AYUSH practitioners to practice allopathy after a 6-month "bridge course". This is also ridiculous. Note that Ayurveda, Unani, Siddhi and Homeopathy are very different from allopathy. 6 months is not sufficient to learn the materials MBBS doctors find it hard to grasp in 5-8 years. It is hard and a lot of clinical time is required to gain the skills (yes even the meager skills of the doctors these days). That cannot happen in 6 months. This would be like asking a history PhD to build a nuclear reactor. History professor may have a PhD but it is not in physics. similarly, AYUSH is not the same as allopathy. Just as I would not want allopathy people practicing AYUSH. Now, I am not saying Ayurveda is not helpful or good. It is and should be allowed to flourish and thrive (don\'t get me started on homeopathy. I feel and this is my personal opinion, it is absolute garbage. But to each their own). However, I do believe that these practices should be kept separate and should not be allowed to mix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAYUSH practitioners practicing allopathy, performing unauthorized surgeries and even running ICU\'s is a big reason for the poor healthcare, especially critical healthcare in the country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile we should be investing in training Trauma surgeons, intensivists for better emergency management and taking of the massive work burden off of the specialists so they can focus on OPD\'s we are legalizing quackery. Training paramedics and issuing proper well-equipped ambulances would be a much better use of resources, help massively in cutting down the number of deaths and even stimulate the automobile industry. But no. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf we really wanted to eliminate quackery, we would have one national database for registration of doctors. The doctor\'s name, place of work and registration number would be available for people to see. Anyone could type that in and check whether the doctor is an actual licensd practitioner or not. Would not be that hard. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, as was said in the Parliamentary discussion " \\*\\*The content of the bill is directly opposed to the stated intent of the bill".\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# 3. The Very Misunderstood NEXT exam.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of people think that NEXT exam is a good thing and will improve the clinical skills of doctors because that is what the Anti-Health Minister Harshvardhan Sinha stated. However, this is a pure recipe to \\*\\*destroy all clinical skills\\*\\* in medicine for good\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnderstad that currently every single yearly exam for MBBS (1st prof, 2nd prof, 3rd prof and 4th prof) is conducted by the university. The exams consist of theory regarding mostly the most common diseases found, practicals and clinical case discussion. Note that the object of the exam is to reject people unworthy of practicing medicine (I am obviously not including the donation and capitation seats and the completely useless medical colleges)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, NEET PG entrance asks about questions that have very less clinical value and often about stuff that is rare and theoretical. The object is to rank students and select a handful out of thousands for future courses. Success is largely dependent on one\'s ability to take coaching and capacity to memorize MCQ\'s.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNEXT proposes to merge the two. These two exams are polar opposites of each other. One cannot satisfy both criteria. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, if one says that NEXT will have clinical exams. Then that poses a massive problem for PG entrance. First, it is \\*\\*nearly impossible to conduct clinical exams\\*\\* at such a massive scale at the same time. Next, \\*\\*clinical exams are subjective.\\*\\* This subjectivity poses massive problems for \\*\\*PG competition entrance\\*\\* which should be objective, especially when there can be as many as 200 candidates at the difference of a fraction of a mark in the exam. Note that practical examiners are prone to \\*\\*biases\\*\\* and generally being one of the minorities, women, people from lower socioeconomic status, religion or someone not liking your face can cause you to fail because of their \\*\\*discrimination\\*\\*. Universities tend to protect agaist this to some degree. However, without any university to intervene, \\*\\*scandals\\*\\* in exams will become even more rampant than NEET. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote that this exam will be necessary to gain your degree. If an \\*\\*MBBS student fails\\*\\* this exam, they will be \\*\\*equivalent to +2\\*\\*. The bill makes no mention of how many attempts candidates get for this exam. By the looks of it, students can take this only once. Chances of failing are very high the first time especially when the exam is designed to reject the majority of the people. This will \\*\\*destroy the careers of students for good\\*\\*. This is devastating when you consider the amount of time and money spent by students for MBBS. Many students have taken \\*\\*loans\\*\\*. This makes no sense when \\*\\*the difficulty of the exam has nothing to do with what actually it takes to become a good doctor.\\*\\* Meanwhile, nurses, ward boys and AYush are having a gala time. Note the level of difficulty for MBBS doctors who actually study the required subjects and the ease with which non-MBBS people will have in order to practice the same management.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, \\*\\*if\\*\\* one says that there will be \\*\\*no clinical exam\\*\\*, then this will \\*\\*decimate the clinical skills of doctors completely\\*\\*. Already MBBS students are found more in the coaching classes than with patients. Why would anyone go to clinics?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoreover, note that the \\*\\*final year MBBS has 6-7 subjects\\*\\*. While \\*\\*PG entrance has 19 subjects\\*\\*. If one says that only final year MBBS subjects will come in the exam, then how does one justify admission into non-final year subjects (MBBS teaches stuff like microbiology in 2nd year. However, PG is gained in microbiology only after clearing PG entrance.) Also, an overall knowledge of all subjects is required to become a good doctor, Preclinical knowledge (non final year subjects) is as important as clinical. This was precisely why just 3-4 years ago the govt has made it compulsory to pass (gain at least 50 percentile) in te PG entrance exam to even practice as an MBBS doctor. ( I am not here to  debate how NEET is not Clean, focus doctors, focus). To take admission in an engineering college one must have studied maths in +2. One doe not get admission based on class 9th marks of maths while they have studied History and arts in +2.  Then why is PG entrance allowing for this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, final year degree examination (similar to 10th exam or passing +2 which can be done in any subject) comprises of only final year subjects. So if one follows the PG entrance pattern, how does one justify making someone study ALL the subjects?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cherry on the cake is that all this has been done \\*\\*without standardizing the medical syllabus.\\*\\* So different universities have variations in what they teach. This is what allows some universities to be awesome, like AIIMS and PGI or even the whole state of Tamil Nadu\'s awesome colleges. But it also allows some colleges to be absolute garbage. However, since the universities have their own exams, the students have to qualify them based on what they learned. If one wants to conduct one exam, it is imperative that the syllabus and the books be standardized. Else it will not be fair. It would be like studying the table of 2 and being asked about the constitution of India. It makes no sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis will promote \\*\\*coaching culture.\\*\\* Coaching is the \\*\\*termite\\*\\* that has hollowed out the medical system in India. IMO, this poison should be exterminated for good. However, this bill gives it more power. Already if one has not taken coaching in a metropolitan or sub metropolitan city, cannot afford coaching or is rejected by coaching institutes or cannot access them, they have \\*\\*very low chances\\*\\* of getting into MBBS or PG entrance (unless you ave backchannels through dalals. But most of them work through coaching institutes anyway). Now, these students \\*\\*will not even be able to gain a degree\\*\\*. They will not be able to practice even as MBBS doctors. All the while, CHP can practice medicine after a 6-month course! If your intent is to increase the doctor-patient ratio, how does this make any sense?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# 4. Reservation for the rich\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\note that Medical colleges, both for MBBS and PG, have "regulated and unregulated seats". Regulated seats are where the fees is regulated by the government. They are affordable for even lower middle income groups. The unregulated seats charge amounts that only the very rich can afford, (no, even upper middle class cannot usually afford it) The Anti health minister claimed that the NMC bill will regulate 50% seats. Sounds great. But it isn\'t. When you look at the current system, the central government and the state governments together regulate 75-85% of the seats. This is a net \\*\\*drop from 85% to 50% in the affordable regulated seats.\\*\\* The increase in unregulated seats has been called reservation for the rich as \\*\\*universities decrease the minimum marks required for admission to accommodate students that pay more at the expense of more deserving candidates.\\*\\* Medical education is slowly becoming less and less accessible to the common man. Note that the \\*\\*less the access of medical education to the common man, the less is the access of healthcare to the common man.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is obviously to put more money in the pockets of the politicians and their cronies that own so many medical colleges across the country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# 5. National Medical Omission Bill\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote that until now, there is a \\*\\*set method\\*\\* of maintaining \\*\\*medical colleges\\*\\*. There are \\*\\*strict requirements\\*\\* to open a medical college, maintain one (keep one open), to increase the available seats for students, etc. It makes sense because medical colleges \\*\\*treat people and train future doctors\\*\\*. It is imperative they have proper requirements to do so. For eg, one cannot become a surgeon is there is not an operation theatre (or enough tables in the operating theatre for students to learn on). Until now, this regulation was done by the MCI or the medical council of India.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, the same one. However, recently MCU has been \\*\\*closing down many medical colleges\\*\\* across the country , even government colleges, as \\*\\*the government has not provided appropriate funds to maintain the infrastructure.\\*\\* I am not even going to start with private medical colleges (not talking about the few awesome ones) While the govt likes to brag about "creation" of new seats in medical colleges, they conveniently forget the seats lost due to lack of upkeep of existing medical colleges. Just \\*\\*last year\\*\\* about 2000 seats were created and about 3000 seats were lost. There was a \\*\\*net loss of about 1000 medical seats.\\*\\* But instead of spending money on the colleges, the govt decided to eliminate the body that shut down incompetent medical colleges. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the colleges \\*\\*do not need to be inspected. Inspection is optional and can be done after 4 years of the opening of medical college\\*\\* \\\\- at the time the first medical batch passes. What is to stop you or me from opening a \\*\\*Trump University\\*\\* like medical college, charge lakhs of rupees per student per year and then close the college after 3 years and then open another one? Absolutely nothing. This will destroy the careers of thousands of students per year. This will destroy their homes and lives (remember how much money these colleges will charge). Students will pay the fees, join coaching, and study and due to no fault of them, they will be left with no degree. Just like with generics, for medical colleges, there will be \\*\\*no pragmatic way to tell reliable and unreliable ones apart\\*\\* (except for a few ones). This is l\\*\\*egalized conmaship. (420si)\\*\\* Not to mention the money laundering hubs these paces will become.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote that the old MCI head was in trouble for taking money to allow some sub-par medical colleges to function. So the solution is to remove ALL regulation from ALL medical colleges. What a cognitive dissonance sir jee.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis truly is the National Medical Omission Bill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# 6. No more AIIMS, PGI?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell,techncally they will still exist. You must know that AIIMS, PGI, JIPMER like institutes enjoy a \\*\\*fairly autonomous status\\*\\* and the \\*\\*government\\*\\* is \\*\\*not able to interfere\\*\\* in their working by and large. Correct me if I am wrong, but NMC bill \\*\\*removes this autonomous status.\\*\\* This autonomous status plays a great part in making these colleges hubs of learning and research, incredible studies and \\*\\*institutes of excellence.\\*\\* This will be a massive blow to their functioning and will reflect in the quality of their care and research. I have no explanation as to why the govt would want to do this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother point is that these institutes have PG exams twice a year. However, under NEXT, that will be reduced to once a year. This will cause droppers to lose an entire year instead of months. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# 7. Replacing MCI with worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we have all heard about the corruption stories of MCI. No one is defending the MCI here. However, this bill does away with the MCI and replaces it with the national Medical commission. This will consist of all government appointees so they will be pretty much like Niti Ayog. What is amazing is that the \\*\\*medical community gets nearly no representation\\*\\* in the NMC. Ask yourselves about how much you know about the medical system and how it works (non-medicos obviously). That is exactly how much these people will know. And they are supposed to make decisions about medical education and healthcare. Imagine handing plutonium to a monkey. That would be safer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, there has been many proposals to fix the MCI problem. I liked the one where MCI would be elected and the members would be on partial terms like Rajya Sabha. Their functions would be the same as the old MCI. To control the corruption, one could have ahd oversight by a National Health Comittee with represenation of govt and medical communty; Kind of how it works in Germany. This may not be the best solution but this is one of the scores of solution sthat were better than the NMC.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe state of economy that we see today will be the state of healthcare very soon because it will be managed by similar people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# 8. Barely any State Representation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe NMC has a structure where states get rotational representattion. Which means a \\*\\*state\\*\\*, especially smaller stated that need more \\*\\*representation\\*\\* will get a chance to be on the committee \\*\\*after as much as 12 years\\*\\*! After slight dissent from the (non) opposition, this rotation was changed so that states could get representation a little sooner, However, even that is pretty vague. So obviouly state interests are not protected.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# 9. Too much power\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe NMC has too much power. Even \\*\\*MCI\\*\\* inspected the colleges and provided guidelines over the medical syllabus, it \\*\\*did not fix fees, decide new branches\\*\\* unilaterally \\*\\*or have complete control over exams\\*\\*. NMC has all that and more. \\*\\*The definition of the powers and purpose is so vague that it is meaningless.\\*\\* They could do anything and it would be binding. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoreover,  \\*\\*the decision of the center in all matters is final.\\*\\*  so the center could issue a fatwah on anything in complete opposition of the opinion of the entire medical community, all the states, all professions involved (like this bill) and everyone will have to follow it no matter how senseless or harmful. This is total dictatorship and seeing the past few decisions regarding healthcare, will be devastating!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are just some of the most important problems I saw at first glance.

      <li>Title::: 'Idol Thief Subhash Chandra Kapoor declared by the US as one of the most prolific commodities smugglers in the world. His NY warehouse had more than $100 million worth of stolen Indian art! The pair of Nataraja and Sivakami (900 yrs) fetched him $ 8.5 million, the idols belonged to the Chola Era'<br />Body: "**Background:**\n\nThe Udayarpalayam taluk of the Ariyalur District, in Tamil Nadu, India has nearly 463 ancient temples, of which 200 belong to the Chola period dated 9th to 10th century AD. Most of these temples haven't seen maintenance for many decades and have lax security. Local thieves used to target the idols for their metal content, usually melting them. Some idols are pure gold, silver and panchaloha — five precious metals. However, the entry of international smuggling cartels has changed the situation. With antique Chola art being worth millions in the international market, idol thieves were recruited to lift them from the temples. In 2008, one such gang allegedly recruited by New York-based art dealer Subhash Kapoor was responsible for stealing eight idols from the Brihadeeswarar temple at Sripuranthan, 18 idols from the Varadharaja Perumal temple, and in 2010, 6 panchaloha idols from Chozeeshwarar temple at Vikiramangalam.\n\nAnd when the US authorities subsequently raided Kapoor's warehouses in New York more skeletons came tumbling out of his closet. They recovered no less than $100 million worth of stolen Indian art! This was just Kapoor's inventory - he had been in business for close to four decades and the true scale of his loot is incalculable. The US declared Kapoor one of the most prolific commodities smugglers in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Idol Chase](https://i.redd.it/3yuoymhnjfj31.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[State of one our Temples in Tamil Nadu, 800-year-old Sundareswara Temple in Suthamalli](https://i.redd.it/x0bypa92kfj31.png)\n\n**Idols Returned from Museums across the World**\n\n* **Australia**\n\nThe Sripuranthan Natarajan Idol, is a 900-year-old statue of Natarajan — the dancing Shiva — that was stolen from the ancient Brihadeeswarar temple of Sripuranthan, smuggled to the United States, and then sold to the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra with a false provenance, for US$5.1 million. In March 2014, Ron Radford, the director of the National Gallery of  Australia, removed the idol from display. In September 2014, the  Australian government returned the Natarajan idol to India, along with  another stolen antique idol of Shiva as Ardhanarishvarar which was  displayed at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. The two were handed over by the then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 5 September 2014, at New Delhi.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This  900-year-old bronze statue of Dancing Shiva, shown on display at the  National Gallery of Australia, was stolen from a temple in Tamil Nadu , $5 million.](https://i.redd.it/xe89tmhjkfj31.png)\n\n[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Stolen-Nataraja-Ardhanariswara-idols-return-to-the-land-of-temples/articleshow/42282580.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Stolen-Nataraja-Ardhanariswara-idols-return-to-the-land-of-temples/articleshow/42282580.cms)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Germany**\n\nThe Linden Museum in Germany returned to the Indian government a 9th-century AD idol of Mahishasumardini, stolen from Pulwama district in Jammu and Kashmir in the 1990s, which had been acquired from Kapoor. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **USA**\n\nThe Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio returned four artifacts acquired from Kapoor, including the Vinayagar statue stolen from Sripuranthan. The other antiques are a stone idol of Varaha Rescuing the Earth (acquired 2001), Mughal origin 18th-century enamel with gold box (acquired 2008), and a watercolour Rasikapriya from the Samdehi Ragini (acquired 2010).\n\nIn November 2015, the United States returned a chola period bronze of Shivan and Parvathi, which was sold to the David Owsley Museum of Art at the Ball State University in 2005 by Subhash Kapoor. Here also, the sculpture was sold with a false provenance which placed it back to an American collection of Leo Figie, dated to 1969. The idol was recovered by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).\n\nIn June 2016, the United States returned **nearly 200 antiques to the Indian Government, in the presence of the visiting Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi at Washington DC.** Among the antiques returned were the Chola period (850 AD to 1250 AD) bronze of the Tamil Shaivite poet Manikkavacakar stolen from the Sivan Temple in Madras and the 1000 year old Sripuranthan Vinayagar which was displayed at the Toledo Museum of Art.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Singapore**\n\nIn March 2016, the Natarajan idol was re-united with its consort Uma  Parmeshwari, at the ASI Icon Centre, Kumbakonam, after nearly 8 years.  The Singapore Civilisation Museum had finally returned the Uma  Parmeshwari after long negotiations with the Indian Government.\n\nOverall four of the eight statues stolen from Sripuranthan were traced, with three to the United States and one to Singapore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Work on getting the Gods Stolen was not Easy**\n\nHowever, the **National Gallery of Australia, continued to deny that  the artwork was stolen, refused to return it, and continued to display  it in the gallery, without any note of its doubtful provenance.** This  stand was criticised by the Australian media, with Duncan Chappell,  criminology expert from University of Sydney, calling it in-appropriate  and an international embarrassment. **The Government of India formally  requested the artwork to be returned, under the UNESCO** **convention on stolen antiquities****.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How did he Succeed for so long without getting caught**\n\n**Subhash Chandra Kapoor** main man who made him from selling terracotta to idols where big money is Sanjeevi Asokan an art dealer based out of Chennai.\n\nThe plan involved identifying villages in and around TN, look for temples which remained closed or neglected for years. The Cholas love for bronze idols were immense even small temples in remote villages has great idols.\n\nSubash Kapoor used 3 main books where he sourced which temples to rob and which temples had what idols, the books were,\n\n* The Chola Temples, S.R Balasubrahmanyam\n* Early Chola Bronzes, Douglas Barrett\n* Bronzes of South India - P.R Srinivasan\n\n**Problem :**\n\n1. Neglect some temples have been closed for years, rituals happen once a few years\n2. No Photographic evidence of what idols are in what temples\n3. No of idols in each temples is not documented\n4. ASI was sleeping along\n5. Diplomats and moles who sold their soles to sell our gods\n6. Worst was the robbery was not detected even after years after it was robbed and the Statues had already been sold museums and were displayed in the Galleries\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Who is Vijay Kumar**\n\nAuthor Vijay Kumar was one of the prominent person who studied and exposed the idol trade business of Subash Kapoor. He has exposed the relationship between Subhash Kapoor and Sanjeevi Ashokan  which goes beyond thee bronzes, the loopholes and contacts in the  entire system helps them route the idols from Indian shores across the  word without being caught. But despite many corrupt officials the Indian  bureaucracy also has some good honest officers on its payroll.\xa0 Being art enthusiast used his study and source along with the enthusiastic  group (An officer from US Immigration and customs who encountered an  abandoned shipment earlier) did a magnificent job of identifying the  stolen Bronzes, across museums in the world, and establishing the proof  which eased the efforts of the Police. The author and his team studied  various pictures from Museums and collated the data with historical  information about the location of the idols and iconography in various  Temples to prove the thefts.\n\nHis two pertinent questions for us:\n\n* To the top Museums of the world, what’s the point of curating and  documenting systematically when the Murtis are basically stolen from  Ancient Temples of India that has survived invasions over 800 plus  years? Quite shameless.\n* Specifically to all my fellow Indians, what exactly are you proud of  as a Hindu/Indian? If not for our Temple structures, exquisite  sculptures, what then? A reader can get a clear picture on the global  network and their greed towards our precious and how apathy from our  side to even have a photograph makes it difficult to establish evidence.  Even though it is a Pan-India problem, I assume it is more in Tamil  Nadu.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Inspiration\n\nThe Idol Thief - Book by S.

      <li>Title::: 'New trick in town: Invoking Vajpai to counter Modi'<br />Body: 'Since modi rose to popularity around 2012-2013 a phenomena has been observed. The same media that use to call Atal Bihari Vajpai and L.K.Advani as softliner and hardliner face of the same communal ideology began to venerate them. This occurence has only increased since then. Not so much with Advani but with Vajpai it is clear and consistent. With Advani it was more of a phase.\n\n1. LOVE FOR ADVANI\n\nMedia along with progressives and all the other opponents of BJP in a way pushed for Advani to be the PM candidate of the BJP. The project failed. It was transperant to everyone that Modi has a greater chance to win and opponents of BJP want it to go against its support base and choose a weaker, less popular PM candidate who was rejected by the electorate in 2009. Since then their obsession with Advani has slowly waned. The same Advani who was the monster of Babri demolition for left-liberals became a respectable old politician who is being wronged by his own party. Who is being sidelined by this tough new brat. All that passed but we can still see glimpse of that sympathy for Advaniji every now and then. Advani is used as a prop to show how bad Modi is to be treating his party senior by taking charge of the party. \n\n2. “Would Vajpai have done this”\n\nWith Atal Bihari Vajpai its different. You would often hear media asking BJP spokespersons, “would Vajpaiji have done this”? Media is trying to establish Vajpai as standard of what can or cannot be done by the bjp. There is a huge difference between Vajpai and modi, apart from the obvious fact that they are both different people with different minds and working style a whole sketch can make it clear as to how and why they are so different and how they cannot be compared. We are talking apples and oranges here. Two different personalities, two completely different political landscapes. \n\nThe background:\n\nABV was a tall leader of a party which was perpetually occupying the benches of opposition. All his life he was a leader of the opposition party. Even after NDA came to power at centre the character of BJP and its leader was that of opposition leaders. They were taking their time to adjust as a ruling party. The political ground below them was shaky. They stood with support of many coalition partners. The coalition itself was an improved version of Janta party coalition in the sense that it was not that unstable but it was still made up of parties as different as BJP which supports abrogation of article 370 in Kashmir to National conference which demands Article 370 stays and more autonomy be given to Kashmir. It was a patchwork where BJP was recognized less as the senior partner and more as first among equals. \n\nThe party because of numbers and its own legacy and psyche of its leaders functioned as a party not quite at ease with being the ruling power. Perhaps this attitude of BJP can be explained by he position it was in. All the bureaucrats were appointed by Congress or governments friendly to the Congress. Media was run by known BJP haters who were the beneficiary of Congress rule. \n\n ABV spent most of his life being in opposition before being PM. Modi on the other hand was chief minister of a state for three consecutive term before becoming PM. In this sense ABV has been an outsider and his time limited as constitutional head while Modi has spent almost 25 years as constitutional head of either the state or the nation. \n\nAnother prominent distinction is their formative years. ABP grew up in the era of freedom struggle and later witnessed India led by Nehru. He was in many ways Nehruvian Himself. Modi on the other hand saw emergency in his earlier years and later in 90s the rise of jihadi terrorism. He was hounded for over a decade by the Congress party unlike Vajpai who enjoyed comparatively an easy relationship with Congress and Gandhi family.\n\n\nThe political landscape:\n\nThe last distinction is the most important. While ABV was PM of a coalation Modi is PM whose party enjoys full majority in parliament and is hugely popular himself. Modi has now entered an era where country’s three top post holders (PM, President and Vice-president) are all from BJP. This political landscape is completely different from the one Vajpai inhabited. Also geopolitical clout of India has increased over the years. \n\nDecisions like abrogation of Article 370 were part of BJP’s agenda during and before Vajpai’s Prime Ministership and Vajpai have advocated for the same. Would Vajpai have taken tough decisions of Modi era is like asking would Ashoka have defeated Akbar have he had access to gunpower, purely hypothetical. One can indulge in imaginary line of questioning like some game invented by Sheldon Cooper but any real, serious commentator would refrain from such leaps of fantasies because of the sheer difference of the people and situations involved which makes this comparison meaningless.'<br />Author: 'l6_6l'  id: 'cx0xde'<br />Score:58<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cx0xde/new_trick_in_town_invoking_vajpai_to_counter_modi/</li>

If it takes 1 hour to drive 5 kms in a car, obviously people would rather not own a car. Also with exclusion of ola etc., naturally people prefer not own an over expensive car. I think the solution is create a new cities with better roads and improving current roads. \n\nIMO GDP rate is slowing down because of oil price increases and India exports a lot of it and worldwide economy is   tanking. So the solution would be build a lot renewable resorts for energy. \n\nOn the other hand companies like zomato, swiggy and new types of companies are exploding improving sales of restaurants and obviously people seem to spend on these. \n\n\nConsidering the usual anti - India news media  reporting that Indian economy is doomed and we all are gonna die , looks like propaganda so far. In order to discourage foreign investment.  so I’m asking fellow bhrathas if Indian economy is doomed beyond repair which is reported by usual suspects and western establishment propaganda blatantly parroting?'<br />Author: 'KarnaBro'  id: 'cwx1hp'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cwx1hp/is_news_about_indian_economy_an_overblown/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Laughter is the Best Medicine - And Perhaps Also the Best Weapon?'<br />Body: "As we know, media have always been politically weaponized, ever since the earliest newspapers, and that's especially true in India. While the Indian Left  have always sought to attack and caricature the Indian right, the latter had responded with newspapers of their own to get their opposing view across. Political cartoons have always been a staple of newspapers, including in India, providing fodder against all parties.  \n\nIn recent decades, Bollywood/Urduwood had gotten into the act to weaponize entertainment. But even while Leftist ladder-climbers manage to impose their cultural groupthink on most of the industry, other entertainers have been able to occasionally pierce the fog with alternate views.\n\nIn broadcast news media, channels have emerged on both sides, but many on the Indian right have long seen the need to challenge the Left's dominance over english-language broadcast media (NDTV, etc) by hoping for our own FOX News. The arrival of newer networks like [Republic TV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwqusr8YDwM-3mEYTDeJHzw) have helped to address this gap.\n\nThe weaponization of Comedy &amp; Satire by the Left has gone beyond the objective satire of Mark Twain. In the West, late night talk shows have been a staple of comedy entertainment, but traditionally stayed neutral without taking political sides. However, starting with Jon Stewart, the trend in recent years has seen a flood of comedians shoving their way ever more aggressively into the sphere of politics, with very powerful effects. The political right have been notably feeble in responding to this.\n\nI was watching this video by Shekhar Gupta's news outfit The Print, and noticed a departure from their usual solemn Left-leaning reports, with a foray into satirical reporting to mock and skewer the Indian right:\xa0\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX2z3gjXZ7g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX2z3gjXZ7g) \n\nWhat's then wrong with the Indian right also doing the same back, and coming up with comedians to skewer the Indian Left mercilessly and unsparingly?\n\nRather than mocking Mullahs, who are a never-ending source of absurdity ripe for ridicule, the better target might be the Indian Left, who at least cannot claim to be a persecuted minority.\n\nTough talk shows like Arnab's and others have had a strong impact that's greatly benefited the Indian right, by allowing them to get their viewpoint across. We now know to think beyond mere individual news reports and instead look at narratives. What about the use of comedy and satire for the same? Could the cultivation of Indian comedy &amp; satire for skewering the Left in a broadcast format not similarly provide good return on investment? Perhaps it may start out with just humorous WhatsApp videos, but there may be room for evolution from there."<br />Author: 'sanman'  id: 'cw7ipp'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cw7ipp/laughter_is_the_best_medicine_and_perhaps_also/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Why Rahul Gandhi isn't taken seriously"<br />Body: 'I was thinking about Congress dynasty and why Rahul Gandhi somehow hasn\'t succeeded despite having everyone at his beck and call, and his mother to tutor him on realpolitik.\n\nWhat seems to be a pattern in these dynasties is, the successor needs to rebel against the orthodoxy in their party, throw out a few old guards, and make their mark. That\'s how they get taken seriously.\n\nIndira fought the Syndicate. Rajiv wasn\'t taken seriously until he started getting all expansionist. (You could also say he seemed to be "avenging his mother\'s murder", but it\'s horrible to think of). Sonia did that whole drama locking sitaram kesri in the bathroom. Also all these people had their dynastic predecessor dead by the time they staked their claim to power, so they didn\'t have to rebel against their parents, just their parent\'s friends. \n\nRahul tried a lot, with tearing the ordinance, appointing his loser coterie, saying Congress is dynastic etc, but he isn\'t going against the center of power, Sonia Gandhi. So he\'s still seen as a pappu, Mama\'s boy, Bambino, etc.\n\nSo as long as Sonia Gandhi is alive, Rahul has no chance. It can be 10-15 years before that changes. She\'s a relatively young 72. \n\nI would have suggested that they appoint some Bali ka bakra as Congress head while Rahul takes a break or something, and then Rahul comes back as that bakra has ruined the party and people are angry with him. But that\'s not going to work, because the party might actually do better without Rahul. And it\'s definitely not going to work because Sonia is still alive and kicking and even if she is out of active politics, it\'ll be seen as she\'s pulling the strings (and let\'s be honest, she is). \n\nHow do other dynastic parties deal with this kind of succession issues? How were Stalin, azhagiri, HD kumaraswamy, Akhilesh taken seriously? \n\nNot going to discuss Akhilesh because I don\'t know UP politics, but Deve Gowda\'s and MuKa\'s kids were given small responsibilities which they executed well. Deve Gowda became PM and his sons started managing local politics. He continued being MP, so it made sense for his one son to become CM. See how his grandson didn\'t win mandya and became a joke after it looked like his father was throwing him a bone (nikhil ellidiyappa video). \n\nIn TN politics, azhagiri got madurai where he basically made it his fiefdom through hook or crook. Stalin became mayor of Chennai. And even he became head of DMK only after sidelining his brother after their father\'s death. \n\nIt\'s too late for Rahul to do that now. I think they tried early on with UP elections and all, but he screwed that up miserably. Also his personality doesn\'t suit UP politics. A good strategy for him would have been to be seen as close to Sheila Dixit and have been seen as a candidate for Delhi CM. That would have been his natural environment and even if he had done the most corrupt shit and won, it would have seemed like he was carving out his fiefdom. This whole starting off as MP thing doesn\'t work because that arena is perceivably too crowded with talent. But that kind of strategy now would be like locking the barn after the horse has bolted. \n\nSo yeah, as long as Sonia Gandhi is still kicking, Rahul will keep on "coming of age".'<br />Author: 'sensitiveinfomax'  id: 'cvdibz'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cvdibz/why_rahul_gandhi_isnt_taken_seriously/</li>

But exactly the opposite happened.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The external debt and liabilities of Pakistan mounted to $106.3 billion as of June 2019, according to the central bank.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the last fiscal year, net $11.1 billion was added to the external debt and liabilities by the federal government, SBP and private sector.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Statistics released by the SBP showed that by the end of last fiscal year, the country’s total debt and liabilities soared to Rs40.2 trillion.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Within a span of just one year, **there was an increase of Rs10.3 trillion, or 34.6%,** in the overall debt and liabilities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government had promised to revive loss-making enterprises, but it was struggling to control these losses.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;By the end of last fiscal year, total losses of PSEs surged to Rs1.62 trillion, a net addition of Rs323 billion or 25% in the past one year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The only thing that the PTI government had done was the incorporation of Pakistan Sarmaya Company. It had also become dormant.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Pakistan’s total debt and liabilities were now equal to 104.3% of its GDP, which was a quite high ratio and considered unsustainable for the country.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Of the Rs40.2 trillion, the gross public debt, which was the direct responsibility of the government, stood at Rs28.6 trillion as of the end of June.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The gross public debt was now equal to 74.4% of GDP, far higher than the 60% statutory limit set in the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act of 2005.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There was an increase of Rs3.7 trillion in the gross public debt in one year, which was higher than the overall budget deficit recorded during the period. One of the key reasons behind the higher debt was the increase in interest rate and depreciation of the rupee in the last fiscal year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Rupee one depreciation added Rs106 billion to the public debt. Similarly, a 1% increase in interest rate increased the cost of debt servicing by roughly Rs180 billion. This ultimately increased borrowing requirements for the finance ministry.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Since December 2017, the central bank had let the currency weaken by 50% and had jacked up the interest rate by 7.50%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Excluding the liabilities, the country’s total debt swelled to Rs37.75 trillion, up Rs9.3 trillion or 18% in one year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The government’s domestic debt surged to Rs20.7 trillion with addition of Rs4.3 trillion in the last fiscal year. Its external debt increased to a record Rs11 trillion.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Total external debt and liabilities surged to Rs14.9 trillion on the back of currency depreciation and new borrowings. In dollar terms, Pakistan’s external debt and liabilities stood at $106.3 billion**. This was mainly because of Chinese, Saudi and United Arab Emirates loans that Pakistan secured for balance of payments support.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[**Pakistan’s current account deficit shrinks massive 73% in July**](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2038380/2-pakistans-current-account-deficit-shrinks-massive-73-july/)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The debt taken by Pakistan from the IMF increased **in rupee terms by Rs180 billion to Rs921** billion due to steep currency devaluation. This was despite the fact that Pakistan retired some IMF debt in the last fiscal year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Total liabilities, which were indirectly the responsibility of the finance ministry, increased to Rs2.1 trillion. There was an increase of 71% in the liabilities. Domestic liabilities dropped from Rs819 billion to Rs756 billion. But external liabilities increased from Rs622 billion to Rs1.7 trillion in one year, due to loans taken from friendly countries. There was 175% increase in external liabilities in one year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The interest payments on debt and liabilities also skyrocketed to Rs2.2 trillion in the last fiscal year. T**he domestic interest payments on debt stood at Rs1.75 trillion –an increase of Rs427 billion or 32%. The external debt interest payments were Rs377 billion –a surge of Rs131 billion or 53%.**  \n\n\nI don't know why these jokers use billion and trillion with ruppees and plus you must remember this is PKR, so if you do a mental calculation converting it to INR, multiply it by 2. LOL.  \n\n\nNote:\n\nRs40.2 trillion total debt and liabilities were equal to 104.3% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)  \n\n\n**So GDP is PKR 38.5 trillion** = **$245 billion (at PKR 157 to $)** as of 2019. For country with 220 million (alleged, real numbers are said to much higher). Pakistanis still dream that they are a $400 billion economy.  \n\n\nDebt payments are in the 10s of billions per year."<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'cv5tsw'<br />Score:64<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cv5tsw/for_the_first_time_in_19_years_pakistans_debt_and/</li>

This unarguably has hut the owner\'s pockets\n\n2) Lack of transparency from Zomato on their rating system and the fact that Zomato provide details of customers using which Restaurants can build a loyal customer base.\n\n3) Large chains like Domino\'s and McD are able to negotiate huge bargain on commissions(7-8%) while small restaurants have to agree to around 20-25% to even be visible on the platform. This doesn\'t include the hefty advertising fee. Hence, no uniform policy and systematic abuse of MSME eateries.\n\nNow, these may seem like business decisions on part of Zomato to become profitable. Still, they have agreed to tweak Gold program, rather unfairly to us as customers.

      <li>Title::: 'What the islamic invaders really did to India'<br />Body: 'Here is a gem from Rizwan Salim, published in 1997 in HT: \'What the invaders really did to India\':\nSavages at a very low level of civilisation and no culture worth the name, from Arabia and west Asia, began entering India from the early century onwards. (1/n)\n(2/n) Islamic invaders demolished countless Hindu temples, shattered uncountable sculpture and idols, plundered innumerable palaces and forts of Hindu kings, killed vast numbers of Hindu men and carried off Hindu women.\n(3/n) Many Indians do not seem to recognise that the alien Muslim marauders destroyed the historical evolution of the earth\'s most mentally advanced civilisation, the most richly imaginative culture, and the most vigorously creative society.\n(4/n) It is clear that India at the time when Muslim invaders turned towards it (8 to 11th century) was the earth\'s richest region for its wealth in precious and semi-precious stones, gold and silver, religion and culture, and its fine arts and letters.\n(5/n) Tenth century Hindustan was also too far advanced than its contemporaries in the East and the West for its achievements in the realms of speculative philosophy and scientific theorising, mathematics and knowledge of nature\'s workings.\n(6/n) Hindus of the early medieval period were unquestionably superior in more things than the Chinese, the Persians (including the Sassanians), the Romans and the Byzantines of the immediate preceding centuries.\n(7/n) The followers of Siva and Vishnu on this subcontinent had created for themselves a society more mentally evolved-joyous and prosperous too-than had been realised by the Jews, Christians, and Muslim monotheists of the time.\n(8/n) Ancient Hindu temple architecture is the most awe-inspiring, ornate and spellbinding architectural style found in the world. (Gothic art of cathedrals in France is the only other religious architecture that is comparable with the intricate architecture of Hindu temples).\n(9/n) No artist of any historical civilisation has ever revealed the same genius as ancient Hindustan\'s artists and artisans. Their minds filled with venom against the idol- worshippers of Hindustan, the Muslims destroyed a large number of ancient Hindu temples.\n(10/n) This is a historical fact, mentioned by Muslim chroniclers and others of the time.\nA number of temples were merely damaged and remained standing. But a large number-not hundreds but many thousands-of the ancient temples were broken into shreds of cracked stone.\n(11/n) In the ancient cities of Varanasi and Mathura, Ujjain and Maheshwar, Jwalamukhi and Dwarka, not one temple survives whole and intact from the ancient times.\nThey also slaughtered a lot of Hindus. Virtually every Hindu temple built in ancient times is a perfect work of art.\n(12/n) So morally degenerate were the Muslim Sultans that, rather than attract Hindu "infidels" to Islam through personal example and exhortation, they just built mosques at the sites of torn down temples-and foolishly pretended they had triumphed over minds and culture of Hindus\n(13/n) Kailas temple at Ellora indicated a will power, a creative imagination, and an intellect eager to take on the greatest of artistic challenges. The forefathers and descendants of those who built the magnificent temples of Bhojpur and Thanjavur, Konark and Kailas......\n(14/n) ....invented mathematics and brain surgery, created mind-body disciplines (yoga) of astonishing power, and built mighty empires would almost certainly have attained technological superiority over Europe.\n(15/n) Priceless piece. Must be read in full. Here is the scanned pdf copy of the piece. Sitaram Goel excerpted it in his book \'Hindu Temples - What Happened To Them\'. \nMust remember: The Abrahamics nurture a deep inferiority complex towards Hinduism, so they try to destroy it.\n\nSOURCE:\n[Rizwan Salim, Hindustan Times, 1997](https://imgur.com/a/T6yp4TS)'<br />Author: 'Adi945'  id: 'curg4w'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/curg4w/what_the_islamic_invaders_really_did_to_india/</li>

The idol of that place is called Cakrasvamin, i.e. the owner of the cakra, a weapon which we have already described. It is of bronze, and is nearly the size of a man. It is now lying in the hippodrome in Ghazna, together with the Lord of Somnath, which is a representation of the penis of the Mahadeva, called Linga."[11]”\n\nFirishta\xa0records[12]\xa0that\n\n“In the year A.H. 402 (A.D. 1011) Mehmood Gazini resolved on the conquest of Thanesur”\n\n, the most sacred Hindu place, in the kingdom of Hindoostan. It had reached the ears of the King that Thanesar was held in the same veneration by idolaters, as Mecca by the faithful; that they had there set up a number of idols, the principal of which they called Jugsoma, pretending that it had existed ever since the creation. Mahmood having reached Punjab, required, according to the subsisting treaty with the\xa0Hindu Shahi\xa0king Anandpal, that his army should not be molested on its march through his country. An embassy was accordingly sent to inform the Raja of his intentions, and desiring him to send safety guards into his towns and villages, which he would take care to be protected from the followers of his camp. Anandpal the Shahi king, agreeing to this proposal, prepared an entertainment for the reception of the King, at the same time issuing orders for all his subjects to supply the camp with every necessity of life.\n\nThe Raja\'s brother, with 2,000 horses was also sent to meet the army and to deliver the following message:\n\n"My brother is the subject and tributary of the King of Gazni, but he begs permission to acquaint his Majesty, that Thanesar is the principal place of worship of the inhabitants of the country: that if it is required by the religion of Mahmood to subvert the religion of others, he has already acquitted himself of that duty, in the destruction of the temple of Nagrakote. But if he should be pleased to alter his resolution regarding Thanesar, Anandpal Tuar promises that the amount of the revenues of that country shall be annually paid to Mahmood, that a sum shall also be paid to reimburse him for the expense of his expedition, besides which, on his own part, he will present him with fifty elephants, and jewels to a considerable amount."\n\nMahmood\xa0replied, "The religion of the faithful inculcates the following tenet: ‘That in proportion as the tenets of the Prophet are diffused, and his followers exert themselves in the subversion of idolatry, so shall be their reward in heaven;’ that, therefore, it behooved him, with the assistance of God, to root out the "worship of idols" from the face of all India. “How then should he spare Thanesar?"[13]\n\nThis answer was communicated to Raja Anandpal Tuar of Delhi, who, resolving to oppose\xa0Sultan Mahmood, sent messengers throughout Hindoostan to acquaint the other rajas that Mahmood, without provocation, was marching with a vast army to destroy Thanesar, now under his immediate protection. He observed, that if a barrier was not expeditiously raised against this roaring torrent, the country of Hindoostan would be soon overwhelmed, and that it behooved them to unite their forces at Thanesar, to avert the impending calamity.\n\nMahmood, having reached Thanesar before the Hindus, had time to take measures for its defence; the city was plundered, the idols broken, and the idol Jugsoma was sent toGhazni\xa0to be trodden underfoot. According to Hajy Mahommed Kandahary, a ruby was found in one of the temples weighing 450 miskals. It was allowed by everyone who saw it to be a wonder that had never been heard of. About the attack on Thanesar,\xa0Utbi\xa0wrote "The blood of the infidels flowed so copiously that the stream was discoloured, notwithstanding its purity, and people were unable to drink it."[14]\n\nMahmood, after the capture of Thanesar, was desirous of proceeding to\xa0Delhi. But his nobles told him that it would be impossible to keep possession of it, till he had renderedMultan\xa0a province of his own government and secured himself from all apprehension of Anundpal, the Hindushahi Raja of\xa0Lahore. The king resolved, therefore, for the present, to proceed no further, till he had accomplished these objects. Anundpal Shahi, however, conducted himself with so much policy and hospitality towards Mahmood, that he returned peaceably to Ghazni. On this occasion, the\xa0Mahmood\'s\xa0army brought to Ghazni 200,000 captives, and much wealth, so that the capital appeared like an Indian city, no soldier of the camp being without wealth, or without many slaves.'<br />Author: 'Vishwamitr'  id: 'cuq9ap'<br />Score:38<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cuq9ap/muhammad_ghaznavis_jihad_for_thanesar_and_his/</li>

Some rebels are even attempting to revive and promote sanamahi, the ancient religion of the Meiteis, which is undergoing a modest revival. Then, in 2000, the rebels ordered a ban on Hindi movies in cinemas and satellite TV channels to “protect Manipuri culture.” Until that happened, entertainment for young and not-so-young Manipuris was largely supplied by Bollywood. The new ban was enforced by threats to bomb recalcitrant cinemas and cable operators, so no one dared to show Hindi movies any longer.\nBut people in the direst of situations tend to be ingenious and there was a way out: the twenty-four-hour English-language Arirang network, which is based in South Korea, replaced Bollywood. Today, there is a craze for all things Korean in Manipur: dramas, soaps, music, fashion, even food. Even the service in the only “Korean” restaurant in Imphal differs from those in other eateries in that patrons have to sit on the floor. And according to the French press agency AFP: “Hairdressing saloons are covered with head shots of Korean celebrities and offer a wide range of spiky, ‘Korean-style’ cuts which are hugely popular with young Manipuris of both sexes.”'<br />Author: 'ILikeMultisToo'  id: 'cudk5s'<br />Score:21<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cudk5s/do_you_wonder_why_kpop_is_thriving_in_manipur/</li>
