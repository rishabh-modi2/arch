And how can there be any happiness without peace?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nUnless one is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is no possibility of peace. So it is confirmed in the Fifth Chapter (5.29) that when one understands that Kṛṣṇa is the only enjoyer of all the good results of sacrifice and penance, and that He is the proprietor of all universal manifestations, that He is the real friend of all living entities, then only can one have real peace. Therefore, if one is not in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there cannot be a final goal for the mind. Disturbance is due to want of an ultimate goal, and when one is certain that Kṛṣṇa is the enjoyer, proprietor and friend of everyone and everything, then one can, with a steady mind, bring about peace. Therefore, one who is engaged without a relationship with Kṛṣṇa is certainly always in distress and is without peace, however much one may make a show of peace and spiritual advancement in life. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a self-manifested peaceful condition which can be achieved only in relationship with Kṛṣṇa.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the reason for the mind being always disturbed ?

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 2.63'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : Who is an impersonalist ? What is the difference between an impersonalist and devotee or a Kṛṣṇa conscious person ? What example has been given to explain the same ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "Those who are without knowledge of Kṛṣṇa consciousness artificially try to avoid material objects, and as a result, although they desire liberation from material bondage, they do not attain to the perfect stage of renunciation. On the other hand, a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness knows how to use everything in the service of the Lord; therefore he does not become a victim of material consciousness. For example, for an impersonalist, the Lord, or the Absolute, being impersonal, cannot eat. Whereas an impersonalist tries to avoid good eatables, a devotee knows that Kṛṣṇa is the supreme enjoyer and that He eats all that is offered to Him in devotion. So, after offering good eatables to the Lord, the devotee takes the remnants, called prasādam. Thus everything becomes spiritualized and there is no danger of a downfall. The devotee takes prasādam in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, whereas the nondevotee rejects it as material. The impersonalist, therefore, cannot enjoy life due to his artificial renunciation; and for this reason, a slight agitation of the mind pulls him down again into the pool of material existence.

No alcoholic can die in thirst of alcohol but the pain of hunger takes away the life of one child in every 10 seconds. It\'s my appeal to all the educated and able Indians  to not to waste their resources and money on destroying their own body, instead go out, see the need of your help in the eyes of those hungry children and hungry India, I am sure your Indian heart will no longer be able to bear that pain and you will utilise your resources and money in uplifting Indian Economy in it\'s real sense. I request everyone of you reading this to share your views in this context. Let\'s together become a source of light, our country needs.

      <li>Title::: 'Why Pakistan behaves like Pakistan ? Because of religion or culture?'<br />Body: "Historically, Punjab was ruled by Sikh empire with Lahore as it capital . Empire had a military aristocracy , so military had domination in Punjab politics since 18th century. Since Punjab is in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent ,due to gaps and passes in northwestern Himalayas it was prone to attack . And without disappointing ,many raids have occurred in this region dating back to 500 bce (Greek , Persian attacks). Infact Alexander tried to attack from this region at the hydaspes river. So the entire punjabi society has evolved having threat perception which made them short tempered , jingoistic . It's like they are always on their toes , ready to attack. Although india also have a punjab but they are minority in bigger india but vice versa in Pakistan.\n\nSo Punjabi domination/racism/ imperialism in Pakistan lead to the partition of Pakistan in 1971. Their military spending is close to 20% of the GDP(in India its roughly ~2.14%). Pakistani military is controlling most of the resources in Pakistan , infact their head of space program is a military officer , not a scientist . Military is dominated by Punjabis in both the countries , only difference is ,Pakistan is a military state. Cultural legacy and society which is shaped by its geography is the reason for  Pakistan to be a military state and Islam has nothing to do with this. So my final conclusion is religion has nothing to do with the nature of the society because Bangladesh is also an Islamic state but it doesn't behave like Pakistan. Society is a better tool to judge the behaviour of that region. Well my whole post is not to demonize Punjabi society , i am just mentioning some of the traits that Punjabi society has developed  may be due to natural selection or geographical difficulties."<br />Author: 'Keshav_kumar94'  id: 'gnrxzv'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gnrxzv/why_pakistan_behaves_like_pakistan_because_of/</li>

Although the person in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness may apparently be on the sensual plane, because of his being Kṛṣṇa conscious, he has no attachment to sensual activities. The Kṛṣṇa conscious person is concerned only with the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, and nothing else. Therefore he is transcendental to all attachment. If Kṛṣṇa wants, the devotee can do anything which is ordinarily undesirable; and if Kṛṣṇa does not want, he shall not do that which he would have ordinarily done for his own satisfaction. Therefore to act or not to act is within his control because he acts only under the direction of Kṛṣṇa. This consciousness is the causeless mercy of the Lord, which the devotee can achieve in spite of his being attached to the sensual platform.\n\n**Question 1 : Why a Kṛṣṇa conscious person is transcendental to all attachment ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chapter-2:Contents of the Gita Summarized](https://preview.redd.it/3cr8ickav1051.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b571793ed8ae0710ac1d379f05f26ef995575aa7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'gnqm0d'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gnqm0d/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_264/</li>

Mahabharata describes the events leading upto the present age of Kali (which started about 5000 years ago). It occurs just before the fratricidal war between the members of Kuru dynasty.\n\n**Why was it spoken:**\n\nArjuna, having seen the army on the other side consisting of a variety of different grades of relatives, was overwhelmed. He thought of not fighting and dying to be better than fighting and killing his near and dear ones. Krsna explains him the reasons as to why he should fight and very patiently clears all his doubts. It has many doubts that we would otherwise have, but Arjuna asked them to Krsna for the benefit of entire mankind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have purposefully kept this post short.

"As we advance in life it becomes more and more difficult, but in fighting the difficulties the inmost strength of the heart is developed," he wrote as the country entered its fourth phase of lockdown amid the coronavirus outbreak.\xa0" \nWhat shit?

Those who have watched would know, and those who have not, its a story  set in a mythical world, written by George RR Martin for novels and later adapted for TV show. \n\n**Now, during this quarantine, a regional channel has been telecasting a show Mahabharata in their channel which my parents are watching daily.** \n\nOnly now, I see that this show is a lot lot like GOT, infact, just change the names and set, we have GOT...\n\nThe similarities I find between the two :\n\n1.

When memory is bewildered, intelligence is lost, and when intelligence is lost, one falls down again into the material pool.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nBy development of Kṛṣṇa consciousness one can know that everything has its use in the service of the Lord. Those who are without knowledge of Kṛṣṇa consciousness artificially try to avoid material objects, and as a result, although they desire liberation from material bondage, they do not attain to the perfect stage of renunciation. On the other hand, a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness knows how to use everything in the service of the Lord; therefore he does not become a victim of material consciousness. For example, for an impersonalist, the Lord, or the Absolute, being impersonal, cannot eat. Whereas an impersonalist tries to avoid good eatables, a devotee knows that Kṛṣṇa is the supreme enjoyer and that He eats all that is offered to Him in devotion. So, after offering good eatables to the Lord, the devotee takes the remnants, called prasādam. Thus everything becomes spiritualized and there is no danger of a downfall. The devotee takes prasādam in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, whereas the nondevotee rejects it as material. The impersonalist, therefore, cannot enjoy life due to his artificial renunciation; and for this reason, a slight agitation of the mind pulls him down again into the pool of material existence. It is said that such a soul, even though rising up to the point of liberation, falls down again due to his not having support in devotional service.\n\n**Question 1 : Who is an impersonalist ?

You know nothing ordinary. Our wedding is in December. \n\nShe is a great and genuine girl. I love her a lot. And she says she loves me too. I knew she had a boyfriend in the past and wanted to know the details. Well after spending 2.5 months gettting to know each other thoroughly, I finally manned up to ask her the details of her breakup. Now What she revealed has shaken up my mental condition. \n\n  \n\n\nShe said her relationship was of 2.5 years, right from college. They loved each other a lot. She still respects him and says he is a genuine person. He used to fly in from Delhi to Bangalore to spend time with her in holidays. They truly loved each other and wanted to marry.\n\n  \n\n\nBut there were a few obstacles - boy's elder sister's marriage wasn't fixed. So he didn't tell his family about his relationship. My fiancee meanwhile knew she will be betrothed this year anyhow. She had revealed about the relationship to her father who had objected (not rejected) on the basis of 'different caste'. The dad also said that since the boy's career has just started, he will take a few years to settle down and he can't wait that long to get my fiancee married off.\n\nSo last year in December, before my parents visited her (I wasnt around) place, she had a fight with her ex and warned him if he doesn't do something she will move on and won't look back. He still didn't tell his family.\n\nAfter talking to my parents, girl got positive vibes about my family and decided to go ahead with the breakup. Over the next couple of weeks she eased the boy into the breakup.\n\nWhen I finally visited in March, she had moved on (she says that). She says she fell in love with me by March end, when I wrote her a poem that included all the little details I had gathered from her about herself. Now she says I am her last love. She is looking forward to spending the rest of her life with me.\n\nNow the thing is: I feel like shit. I feel like my parents and myself interfered with their past love life. I also don't understand why they didn't fight back these so called obstacles if they truly loved each other. I mean if I was in that boy's place and genuinly loved a girl, I would have gone for registered marriage and done formal marriage after my sister's marriage is fixed. The girl could have waited for some time.\n\nI don't know why she had to breakup. She is sleeping right now so I can't ask her. But damnit. How is it so easy for people to move on so quickly! That too after years of a loving relationship? I feel like shit because this girl is really good, respects my parents and puts a lot of effort into the relationship. And now I feel like I just interfered in what could have been a great love story between her and her ex.\n\n  \n\n\nWhat should I do now? Should I break it off? I am nearing my 30s and also balding a bit. I feel like I would miss out on the marital Train if I let such a good girl go in the times of Corona. She is really awesome so I don't wanna feel the regret."<br />Author: 'ispaidermaen'  id: 'gn0jli'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gn0jli/relationship_advice_needed_help_a_brother_out/</li>

He later increased quota from 31% to 50%'<br />Body: '***Blast from the past:***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTamil Nadu Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran has a flair for the  flamboyant political gesture. But this time he has stirred a hornet\'s  nest by announcing that the state Government is considering a proposal  to extend the concessions given to backward and scheduled castes to all  poor people irrespective of their caste.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Anywhere in the country such a  move would have caused a rumpus. In Tamil Nadu, where the Dravida  Kazhagam (DK) movement with its strong anti-Brahmin leanings is very  powerful, the move is positively daring.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Both the opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and MGR\'s own All  India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) are offspring of the  rationalist DK movement. And Tamil Nadu has always led the country in  the matter of reservations - there is a 50 per cent reservation in  educational institutions and for state government jobs.\n\nThe state also  has a staggering 174 castes which are listed as backward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Instant Opposition:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;MGR\'s proposals were instantly denounced by both the DMK party chief M.  Karunanidhi and DK General Secretary K. Veeramani. Said Karunanidhi:\n\n"The Constitution recognises only social and educational backwardness."\n\n&gt;MGR and Veeramani: Crossing swords Veeramani,  who heads the backward castes movement in the state says he will fight  the battle in court if necessary. He is equally vehement about the  proposals and adds:\n\n"Singling out the poor of the forward communities  for favoured treatment is unconstitutional, because it offends the  principle of equality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The state Government can think up ameliorative  measures for the economically weaker sections in general irrespective of  the commmunity they belong to."  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The chief minister does not,  however, seem to be in a mood to be cowed down by such statements.\n\nHe  has stuck to his guns and insists that "all backwardness ultimately  **boils down to economic backwardness."**\n\nHe is said to be strongly of  the view that all poor people should be eligible for the same  concessions irrespective of their caste.\n\n&gt;Expounding on the possible  criteria which could be used to define poverty, the chief minister  recently suggested that everybody who is not eligible to pay income tax  could be classed as poor.\n\nThis suggestion met with an immediate  retort from Veeramani, who said\n\n, "only 3 per cent of the population pays  income tax so does MGR imply that 97 per cent of the populace is  economically backward and therefore eligible for concessions?"\n\nIt  is not certain whether it is by coincidence or not but the controversy  has blasted to the surface just after the first ever National Conference  of Backward Castes held in Madras on December 11 and 12. The largely  attended and impressive meet demanded that the B.P. Mandal Commission  Report of 1982 should be fully implemented.\n\nThe conference also  announced that it would be starting a five-week programme of rallies as a  prelude to a "mighty national movement" to see that the Mandal Report  is implemented. The major demand of the committee would not make much  difference in Tamil Nadu as the state is already reserving more than the  27 per cent recommended by the Mandal Committee.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Previous Attempt:**\n\nThis is not the first time that the actor-turned-politician has tried  to rake up the issue of reservations. In 1979 he had tried to specify an  annual income ceiling of Rs 9,000 for members of the backward classes  for them to be eligible for reservations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;MGR was, however, forced  to go back on the move in the wake of stiff opposition. In fact, he was  forced to step down\n\nIn a bid to placate the backward classes he  increased the reservation quota from 31 per cent to 50 per cent.\n\nThe  questions of classification of backward classes and reservations have  assumed added importance now in view of the Tamil Nadu Government\'s  appointment of a backward classes commission to review the existing  system of enumeration and listing in response to a Supreme Court  directive.\n\nSome students have gone to court to challenge the state  Government\'s 1980 order, listing 174 castes as backward. And since the  backward castes constitute a large portion of the electorate it will be  interesting to see if MGR backs down this time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Source:***\n\n[*https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/indiascope/story/19830115-tamil-nadu-cm-mgr-stirs-a-hornets-nest-with-his-concessions-for-all-proposal-770344-2013-07-26*](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/indiascope/story/19830115-tamil-nadu-cm-mgr-stirs-a-hornets-nest-with-his-concessions-for-all-proposal-770344-2013-07-26)'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'gmskm5'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gmskm5/til_in_1983_tamil_nadu_cm_mgr_stirred_up/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Today is Shri Nathuram Godse's 110th Birth Anniversary. Please read his final statement to court before he was hanged."<br />Body: "#Nathuram Godse: 'May it Please Your Honour', Why I killed Gandhi - 1948\n\n**5 May 1949, Punjab High Court, Peterhoff, Simia, India**\n\n*Nathuram Godse assassinated Gandhiji on 30 January 1948. The trial began on 27 May 1948 and concluded on 10 February 1949. He was sentenced to death.*\n\n*An appeal to the Punjab High Court, then in session at Simla, did not find favour and the sentence was upheld. This statement is the last made by Godse before the Court.*\n\n**WHY I KILLED GANDHI**\n\nBorn in a devotional Brahmin family, I instinctively came to revere Hindu religion, Hindu history and Hindu culture. I had, therefore, been intensely proud of Hinduism as a whole. As I grew up I developed a tendency to free thinking unfettered by any superstitious allegiance to any isms, political or religious. That is why I worked actively for the eradication of untouchability and the caste system based on birth alone. I openly joined RSS wing of anti-caste movements and maintained that all Hindus were of equal status as to rights, social and religious and should be considered high or low on merit alone and not through the accident of birth in a particular caste or profession.\n\nI used publicly to take part in organized anti-caste dinners in which thousands of Hindus, Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, Chamars and Bhangis participated. We broke the caste rules and dined in the company of each other. I have read the speeches and writings of Ravana, Chanakiya, Dadabhai Naoroji, Vivekanand, Gokhale, Tilak, along with the books of ancient and modern history of India and some prominent countries like England , France , America and Russia . Moreover I studied the tenets of Socialism and Marxism. But above all I studied very closely whatever Veer Savarkar and Gandhiji had written and spoken, as to my mind these two ideologies have contributed more to the moulding of the thought and action of the Indian people during the last thirty years or so, than any other single factor has done.\n\nAll this reading and thinking led me to believe it was my first duty to serve Hindudom and Hindus both as a patriot and as a world citizen. To secure the freedom and to safeguard the just interests of some thirty crores (300 million) of Hindus would automatically constitute the freedom and the well-being of all India , one fifth of human race. This conviction led me naturally to devote myself to the Hindu Sanghtanist ideology and programme, which alone, I came to believe, could win and preserve the national independence of Hindustan , my Motherland, and enable her to render true service to humanity as well.\n\nSince the year 1920, that is, after the demise of Lokamanya Tilak, Gandhiji’s influence in the Congress first increased and then became supreme. His activities for public awakening were phenomenal in their intensity and were reinforced by the slogan of truth and non-violence which he paraded ostentatiously before the country. No sensible or enlightened person could object to those slogans. In fact there is nothing new or original in them.. They are implicit in every constitutional public movement. But it is nothing but a mere dream if you imagine that the bulk of mankind is, or can ever become, capable of scrupulous adherence to these lofty principles in its normal life from day to day.\n\nIn fact, honour, duty and love of one’s own kith and kin and country might often compel us to disregard non-violence and to use force. I could never conceive that an armed resistance to an aggression is unjust. I would consider it a religious and moral duty to resist and, if possible, to overpower such an enemy by use of force. [In the Ramayana] Rama killed Ravana in a tumultuous fight and relieved Sita.. [In the Mahabharata], Krishna killed Kansa to end his wickedness; and Arjuna had to fight and slay quite a number of his friends and relations including the revered Bhishma because the latter was on the side of the aggressor. It is my firm belief that in dubbing Rama, Krishna and Arjuna as guilty of violence, the Mahatma betrayed a total ignorance of the springs of human action.\nIn more recent history, it was the heroic fight put up by Chhatrapati Shivaji that first checked and eventually destroyed the Muslim tyranny in India . It was absolutely essentially for Shivaji to overpower and kill an aggressive Afzal Khan, failing which he would have lost his own life. In condemning history’s towering warriors like Shivaji, Rana Pratap and Guru Gobind Singh as misguided patriots, Gandhiji has merely exposed his self-conceit. He was, paradoxical as it may appear, a violent pacifist who brought untold calamities on the country in the name of truth and non-violence, while Rana Pratap, Shivaji and the Guru will remain enshrined in the hearts of their countrymen for ever for the freedom they brought to them.\n\nThe accumulating provocation of thirty-two years, culminating in his last pro-Muslim fast, at last goaded me to the conclusion that the existence of Gandhi should be brought to an end immediately. Gandhi had done very good in South Africa to uphold the rights and well-being of the Indian community there. But when he finally returned to India he developed a subjective mentality under which he alone was to be the final judge of what was right or wrong. If the country wanted his leadership, it had to accept his infallibility; if it did not, he would stand aloof from the Congress and carry on his own way.\n\nAgainst such an attitude there can be no halfway house. Either Congress had to surrender its will to his and had to be content with playing second fiddle to all his eccentricity, whimsicality, metaphysics and primitive vision, or it had to carry on without him. He alone was the Judge of everyone and every thing; he was the master brain guiding the civil disobedience movement; no other could know the technique of that movement. He alone knew when to begin and when to withdraw it. The movement might succeed or fail, it might bring untold disaster and political reverses but that could make no difference to the Mahatma’s infallibility. ‘A Satyagrahi can never fail’ was his formula for declaring his own infallibility and nobody except himself knew what a Satyagrahi is. Thus, the Mahatma became the judge and jury in his own cause. These childish insanities and obstinacies, coupled with a most severe austerity of life, ceaseless work and lofty character made Gandhi formidable and irresistible.\n\nMany people thought that his politics were irrational but they had either to withdraw from the Congress or place their intelligence at his feet to do with as he liked. In a position of such absolute irresponsibility Gandhi was guilty of blunder after blunder, failure after failure, disaster after disaster. Gandhi’s pro-Muslim policy is blatantly in his perverse attitude on the question of the national language of India . It is quite obvious that Hindi has the most prior claim to be accepted as the premier language. In the beginning of his career in India , Gandhi gave a great impetus to Hindi but as he found that the Muslims did not like it, he became a champion of what is called Hindustani.. Everybody in India knows that there is no language called Hindustani; it has no grammar; it has no vocabulary. It is a mere dialect, it is spoken, but not written. It is a bastard tongue and cross-breed between Hindi and Urdu, and not even the Mahatma’s sophistry could make it popular. But in his desire to please the Muslims he insisted that Hindustani alone should be the national language of India . His blind followers, of course, supported him and the so-called hybrid language began to be used. The charm and purity of the Hindi language was to be prostituted to please the Muslims. All his experiments were at the expense of the Hindus.\n\nFrom August 1946 onwards the private armies of the Muslim League began a massacre of the Hindus. The then Viceroy, Lord Wavell, though distressed at what was happening, would not use his powers under the Government of India Act of 1935 to prevent the rape, murder and arson. The Hindu blood began to flow from Bengal to Karachi with some retaliation by the Hindus. The Interim Government formed in September was sabotaged by its Muslim League members right from its inception, but the more they became disloyal and treasonable to the government of which they were a part, the greater was Gandhi’s infatuation for them. Lord Wavell had to resign as he could not bring about a settlement and he was succeeded by Lord Mountbatten. King Log was followed by King Stork. The Congress which had boasted of its nationalism and socialism secretly accepted Pakistan literally at the point of the bayonet and abjectly surrendered to Jinnah. India was vivisected and one-third of the Indian territory became foreign land to us from August 15, 1947.\n\nLord Mountbatten came to be described in Congress circles as the greatest Viceroy and Governor-General this country ever had. The official date for handing over power was fixed for June 30, 1948, but Mountbatten with his ruthless surgery gave us a gift of vivisected India ten months in advance. This is what Gandhi had achieved after thirty years of undisputed dictatorship and this is what Congress party calls ‘freedom’ and ‘peaceful transfer of power’. The Hindu-Muslim unity bubble was finally burst and a theocratic state was established with the consent of Nehru and his crowd and they have called ‘freedom won by them with sacrifice’ – whose sacrifice? When top leaders of Congress, with the consent of Gandhi, divided and tore the country – which we consider a deity of worship – my mind was filled with direful anger.\n\nOne of the conditions imposed by Gandhi for his breaking of the fast unto death related to the mosques in Delhi occupied by the Hindu refugees. But when Hindus in Pakistan were subjected to violent attacks he did not so much as utter a single word to protest and censure the Pakistan Government or the Muslims concerned. Gandhi was shrewd enough to know that while undertaking a fast unto death, had he imposed for its break some condition on the Muslims in Pakistan , there would have been found hardly any Muslims who could have shown some grief if the fast had ended in his death. It was for this reason that he purposely avoided imposing any condition on the Muslims. He was fully aware of from the experience that Jinnah was not at all perturbed or influenced by his fast and the Muslim League hardly attached any value to the inner voice of Gandhi.\n\nGandhi is being referred to as the Father of the Nation. But if that is so, he had failed his paternal duty inasmuch as he has acted very treacherously to the nation by his consenting to the partitioning of it. I stoutly maintain that Gandhi has failed in his duty. He has proved to be the Father of Pakistan. His inner-voice, his spiritual power and his doctrine of non-violence of which so much is made of, all crumbled before Jinnah’s iron will and proved to be powerless. Briefly speaking, I thought to myself and foresaw I shall be totally ruined, and the only thing I could expect from the people would be nothing but hatred and that I shall have lost all my honour, even more valuable than my life, if I were to kill Gandhiji. But at the same time I felt that the Indian politics in the absence of Gandhiji would surely be proved practical, able to retaliate, and would be powerful with armed forces. No doubt, my own future would be totally ruined, but the nation would be saved from the inroads of Pakistan . People may even call me and dub me as devoid of any sense or foolish, but the nation would be free to follow the course founded on the reason which I consider to be necessary for sound nation-building.\n\nAfter having fully considered the question, I took the final decision in the matter, but I did not speak about it to anyone whatsoever. I took courage in both my hands and I did fire the shots at Gandhiji on 30th January 1948, on the prayer-grounds of Birla House. I do say that my shots were fired at the person whose policy and action had brought rack and ruin and destruction to millions of Hindus. There was no legal machinery by which such an offender could be brought to book and for this reason I fired those fatal shots. I bear no ill will towards anyone individually but I do say that I had no respect for the present government owing to their policy which was unfairly favourable towards the Muslims. But at the same time I could clearly see that the policy was entirely due to the presence of Gandhi.\n\nI have to say with great regret that Prime Minister Nehru quite forgets that his preachings and deeds are at times at variances with each other when he talks about India as a secular state in season and out of season, because it is significant to note that Nehru has played a leading role in the establishment of the theocratic state of Pakistan, and his job was made easier by Gandhi’s persistent policy of appeasement towards the Muslims. I now stand before the court to accept the full share of my responsibility for what I have done and the judge would, of course, pass against me such orders of sentence as may be considered proper. But I would like to add that I do not desire any mercy to be shown to me, nor do I wish that anyone else should beg for mercy on my behalf.

With the majority of cities showing an increase in cases with no sign of reduction, we have decided to ease lockdown. I think we should be more careful and stricter imposition should be introduced rather than easing the restriction. Yes, there will be damage but it is nothing compared to lives lost. If we look at Sweden who tried the approach where they put the responsibility on the people itself to be careful has proved to be really bad as their death rate per million is worse than the USA itself. I think rather the states or even districts which have more than 1000 cases or 100 cases respectively, should continue the approach of the complete lockdown until there are no new cases till 21 days rather than everything being open for a certain time will only lead to increase in cases as well as the death rate.

      <li>Title::: 'Ragi (nachani)'<br />Body: "Ragi(nachani)\n\n\nThe most delicious and healthiest food which is mainly found in many indians home and kitchen. It has lot health benefits. anciently In india, after the mother milk mostly the first given food is ragi. It has many different names in many different languages such as 'Ragi' in Kannada, Hindi and Telugu, 'Nachni' in Marathi, 'Madua' in Bengali and 'Kezhvaragu' in Tamil,\xa0 kodra in Himachal Pradesh, mandia in oria, etc. Ragi is vastly found in tropical region of Africa and Asia. Today very few people know about the ragi.\n\nIt also act as alternative cereal after barley, wheat, rice. Ragi is very high in calcium, rich in iron and fibre, and has a better energy content than other cereals. There are various food recipes of finger ragi including dosa, idli, roti, papad and laddu. In Maharashtra nachni is mainly given in the form of ambil or bhakri\n\n\nRagi Nutrition Content:\n\nIt contains vitamins such as thiamine(B1), riboflavin(B2), niacin(B3), E, Cand less amount of folic acid mineral such as magnesium, iron and phosphorus.

This lowers high blood sugar in those with diabetes mellitus, making ragi a valuable addition to a diet for diabetes. Also, owing to its low digestibility and rich fiber content, ragi is the top food of choice for adults, for accelerating weight loss and managing other lifestyle diseases like diabetes and obesity.\n\n\n\n4) Treats Anemia:\n\nAnemia is disease which is caused due to deficiency of iron. Anemia causes excessive fatigue and low RBC or HAEMOGLOBIN production.

Eating foods with increased fiber content positively influences bowel movement, regulating faecal bulk and promotes optimal passage of food and other materials within the intestines. So eating ragi daily leads to healthy metabolism\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome properties of ragi according to Ayurveda:\n\nRagi, in essence, has a madhura rasa (sweet taste) with intrinsically laghu and ruksha gunas (light and dry qualities). It possesses ushna virya (heating potency), balancing the kapha while excessively influencing pitta (fire and water) and vata (air and ether). Moreover, it encourages the positive and equalizing states of mind namely sattva and rajas, effectively eliminating tamas or a negative mindset.\n\n\n\nRagi amino acid with benefits:\n\n1.

What examples have been given to explain the same ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** \'There are many learned sages, philosophers and transcendentalists who try to conquer the senses, but in spite of their endeavors, even the greatest of them sometimes fall victim to material sense enjoyment due to the agitated mind. Even Viśvāmitra, a great sage and perfect yogī, was misled by Menakā into sex enjoyment, although the yogī was endeavoring for sense control with severe types of penance and yoga practice. And,of course, there are so many similar instances in the history of the world. Therefore, it is very difficult to control the mind and the senses without being fully Kṛṣṇa conscious. Without engaging the mind in Kṛṣṇa, one cannot cease such material engagements. A practical example is given by Śrī Yāmunācārya, a great saint and devotee, who says: "Since my mind has been engaged in the service of the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and I have been enjoying an ever new transcendental humor, whenever I think of sex life with a woman, my face at once turns from it, and I spit at the thought."\'  \n"Mahārāja Ambarīṣa also conquered a great yogī, Durvāsā Muni, simply because his mind was engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 2.60, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/veoeuyjjmjz41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4724a8b95fc81d0e3423626f288ef495a63a87e\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: 'Alexander rolled into a pool of blood'<br />Body: '"56. The shaft of the Indian warrior unmistakably pierced the heart of Alexander, and suddenly the emperor rolled down unconscious. A Greek soldier immediately covered him with his shield . There was a sudden hue and cry in the Greek ranks that Alexander had been wounded, that he had fallen unconscious. With exceptional daring the Greeks lifted him from the pool of blood and carried him safely to his camp. There with great difficulty that terrible shaft of the Indian warrior was extricated. The Greeks heaved a sigh of relief when after a long time of patient nursing, Alexander gradually regained consciousness. It took several days for the wound to heal up. During all this time Alexander was confined to bed.\n\n57. But everywhere, in Babylon and Greece, the news that was received reported that Alexander was killed in the war by an Indian arrow\\*\'. Consequently there were some uprisings in Gandhar and Persia . But later on when it was known that Alexander was only severely wounded and was now recovering, the situation came to normalcy.\n\n58. No wonder whatsoever, if the news of Alexander\'s having fainted by a bow-shot was greeted cheerfully throughout the Malava-Shudrak republic. Alexander was so much puffed up with pride when King Pourav (Poros) was wounded i n the battle, that he circulated a new coin with a picture showing his fall stamped on it . The coin is still to be seen as a mark of his vanity\\*\'". That insult inflicted on India was fully avenged by the Indian arrow which sent the Greek emperor rolling down on the battlefield in pools of blood. The Ionian Emperor, Alexander, who unjustifiably shed Indian blood, was made to atone for it personally by the shedding of his blood.\n\n59. The Malava-Shudrak republic too should have stamped on some golden coin the picture of Alexander fallen in a pool of blood with an arrow deeply thrust into his chest.. Possibly they did.\n\n60. According to his cruel m i l i t a r y code, he h a d been cruelly crushing down the states which had opposed h i m . B u t whenever there appeared any foe who was equally strong and who retaliated furiously, Alexander h a d the cunning to dissemble nobility and frankness of heart. When he recovered from his wound, he began to make overtures of peace to the commanders of the Malava-Shudrak army instead of dictating his usual arrogant terms\\*\'. For cease-fire talks a hundred representatives of the joint M a l a v a - S h u d r a k republic were elected, and for them Alexander held a grand reception ceremony in his camp. Detailed and very entertaining descriptions of this reception are available in the books of Greek historians\\*\\*. But for want of space we have to satisfy ourselves with a brief reference to it . The hundred representatives were, even according to the Greek standards, of uncommon height, heavily built , having handsome muscular bodies. They were clad in valuable embroidered clothes and had worn beautiful ornaments of goldand  pearls and precious stones. Everyone of them went to the Greek camp in his well-decorated and well-equipped golden chariot. They had with them elephants, too, with costly a n d beautiful outfits. The Greeks had always felt a special fascination for the elephants.\n\n61. Although ranking in his mind was the fact that these very representatives of the Malava-Shudrak joint republic had brought upon him, a little while ago, a mortal danger, Alexander showed his magnanimity i n that reception ceremony and paraded his own imperial splendour. F o r every one of those hundred representatives there was a special golden seat. The banquet which was given in their honour was attended with costly wines and excellent savoury dishes\\*\\*". The grand banquet was followed by various field games and tournaments, music and dancing. In the end, a treaty was signed by the Malava-Shudrak representatives and Alexander\'\\*.\n\n62. The divergent accounts given about this treaty by various Greek writers of the time have at least this much in common to tell . The Greeks and the Indians had jointly agreed to put a stop to their hostilities and that the M a l a v a - Shudrak republic was not to cause any harassment to the retreating army of Alexander while it was progressing on its way home along the Indus. Of these two valiant republics, the Malavas will be referred to later on when, I shall be describing the wars with the Sakas, the Yuechis and other Mlenchha powers. The fact that this Malavare public had been prosperous and strong for many centuries to come, therefore, need not be specially proved.\n\n63. Even the Greek writers could not help recording some more acts of valour during the Indian resistance to the Greek onslaught, although the details of the time and place of their happenings are not available. Two of them are cited-here to serve as specimens."\n\n\\- From Six glorious epochs of Indian History'<br />Author: 'Archer_Arjun'  id: 'glyguj'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/glyguj/alexander_rolled_into_a_pool_of_blood/</li>

And, unless one is Kṛṣṇa conscious, it is not at all possible to control the senses. As cited above, the great sage Durvāsā Muni picked a quarrel with Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, and Durvāsā Muni unnecessarily became angry out of pride and therefore could not check his senses. On the other hand, the King, although not as powerful a yogī as the sage, but a devotee of the Lord, silently tolerated all the sage\'s injustices and thereby emerged victorious. The King was able to control his senses because of the following qualifications, as mentioned in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam:  \nsa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor  \nvacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānavarṇane  \nkarau harer mandira-mārjanādiṣu  \nśrutiṁ cakārācyuta-sat-kathodaye  \nmukunda-liṅgālaya-darśane dṛśau  \ntad-bhṛtya-gātra-sparśe\'ṅga-saṅgamam  \nghrāṇaṁ ca tat-pāda-saroja-saurabhe  \nśrīmat-tulasyā rasanāṁ tad-arpite  \npādau hareḥ kṣetra-padānusarpaṇe  \nśiro hṛṣīkeśa-padābhivandane  \nkāmaṁ ca dāsye na tu kāma-kāmyayā  \nyathottamaśloka-janāśrayā ratiḥ  \n"King Ambarīṣa fixed his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, engaged his words in describing the abode of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the temple of the Lord, his ears in hearing the pastimes of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the form of the Lord, his body in touching the body of the devotee, his nostrils in smelling the flavor of the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, his tongue in tasting the tulasī leaves offered to Him, his legs in traveling to the holy place where His temple is situated, his head in offering obeisances unto the Lord, and his desires in fulfilling the desires of the Lord ... and all these qualifications made him fit to become a mat-paraḥ devotee of the Lord." (Bhāg. 9.4.18-20)  \nThe word mat-paraḥ is most significant in this connection. How one can become a mat-paraḥ is described in the life of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa, a great scholar and ācārya in the line of the mat-paraḥ, remarks: "mad-bhakti-prabhāvena sarvendriya-vijaya-pūrvikā svātma dṛṣṭiḥ sulabheti bhāvaḥ." "The senses can be completely controlled only by the strength of devotional service to Kṛṣṇa." Also the example of fire is sometimes given: "As the small flames within burn everything within the room, similarly Lord Viṣṇu, situated in the heart of the yogī, burns up all kinds of impurities." The Yoga-sūtra also prescribes meditation on Viṣṇu, and not meditation on the void. The so-called yogīs who meditate on something which is not the Viṣṇu form simply waste their time in a vain search after some phantasmagoria. We have to be Kṛṣṇa conscious-devoted to the Personality of Godhead. This is the aim of the real yoga.  \n**Question 1 : What qualifications of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa helped him conquer Durvāsā Muni ?**  \n**Question 2 : What is the real aim of Yoga ?**  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rlrgetb2ngz41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f103f08426a84a9f8ccfe83abdc56b51a64afbcd\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'glvgjg'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/glvgjg/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_261/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Hot water'<br />Body: '\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Hot water\n\n\nwe have started adopting the soaps, detergents, toothpastes, creams, gels, shampoo etc. That too we prefer standard companies and “premium” products.

Hot water avoids this blockage and clears the blockage to an extent. Thus helps in preventing and treating diseases.\n\n\n\n\nHot or cold water bath\n\n\nAccording to Ayurveda use\xa0hot water for the body and cold water bath for head. Ayurveda opines that having hot water head bath is bad for\xa0eyes and hair.\n\n\n\xa0 #\xa0classification according to Doshas\n\n\n1) If person is Pitta body type or disorder, then it is better to use\xa0cold water\xa0for bath rather than hot water.\n\n\n2) If person is Kapha or Vata body type or disorder, then it is better to use\xa0hot water\xa0rather than cold water\n\n\n\xa0 \xa0#\xa0classification based on age\n\n\n•For young children and for people of old age, hot water is good.\n\n•For youngsters cold water is good.\n\n•For students, who are studying, cold water bath early in the morning is beneficial, provided they do not have any health complaints.\n\n\n\n\nHot water health benefits\xa0–\n\n\n1) It helps to\xa0improve digestion and to relieve indigestion.\n\n\n2) Hot water drinking at night before bed time is an excellent remedy to clear white coated tongue.\n\n\n3) Hot water drinking is one of the major advice in the treatment of\xa0cold, cough, respiratory tract infections, Asthma, allergic disorders,\xa0etc. ( Reason: helps to reduce or melt hard mucus layer which helps to remove nasal congestion.

But one who has tasted the beauty of the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa, in the course of his advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, no longer has a taste for dead material things. Therefore, restrictions are there for the less intelligent neophytes in the spiritual advancement of life, but such restrictions are only good if one actually has a taste for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When one is actually Kṛṣṇa conscious, he automatically loses his taste for pale things."  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 2.59, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**  \n\n\n![img](x1yxoph1acz41)\n\n  \nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: 'Amidst all this gloom about the India story, I want to point out the massive improvements in the India story. A replug from 5 years ago'<br />Body: 'Almost every day there is one, and sometimes multiple posts about how terrible India / Indian people / Roads / Political scenario etc are. I have no disputes with any of those because they are very valid and are pretty much true, but then as an "80\'s kid", I can only say that there has been a marked improvement on what things were 5, 10, 15 or 20 years ago. What to say of 30-40 and above years ago.\n\nTake Politics - Are things bad? Yes they are. The opposition (be it the Congress and others in NDA, BJP and others in UPA and now back to Congress and the others in the NDA II) is simply stalling parliament. We have leaders like *insert your own most hated leader here* thriving. Our voters only vote mostly on casteist terms and essentially we are pretty much a failed democracy.\n\nBut are we? The collapse and doom of the Indian society and Indian democracy has been predicted for decades since 1947, but what is actually happening is a forward movement. A steady forward movement.\n\nEven 15 years ago, you had this thing called [Booth Capturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booth_capturing). It essentially meant that the goons of a party would show up at a booth, \'capture\' it, stuff ballot boxes with votes for their party and then drive away to the next booth. This was not even an open secret, but pretty much done in camera. This is pretty much how regimes like the communist regimes the one in West Bengal had an unbroken run for 30 odd years. It was not just restricted to W.Bengal, but it took place in every single state.\n\nIt was not democracy but a goonacracy. It was only in 1989 was this actually made a crime punishable by law, and captured booths had reelections.\n\nPoll violence - It still happens, but is minor, but back in the day it was pretty much full fledged, goons and thugs would actually stand outside booths instructing people on how to vote, money and booze exchanged hands openly and the seat usually went to the guy who could pay the most. If one didn\'t comply with how the local goon wanted people to vote and or for various other reasons, you had outright rioting and violence and bandhs.\n\nWhat about the dumb populace who vote purely for identity based politics and caste you might ask? Even here, you can trace a bell curve type graph. In the period 47-80 the Congress pretty much held sway, but underneath that iron control, regional parties and regional / caste based identities started taking root. If you look at the casteist leaders (the popular ones) and identity based leaders of today, they all cut their teeth in this arena in the mid 70\'s to early 80\'s and by the mid 90\'s, the Laloo\'s, Mulayams\'s, Thackrey\'s were all out in force (identity based politics started earlier in TN, but that is the exception to the rule). This peaked in the late 80\'s to the late 90\'s (at the central level) and to a certain extent is continuing in some states to this day.\n\nAre things getting worse or are they actually changing for the better? What if I told you we are moving from purely caste / identity considerations to a mix of caste / identity and economic (the much derided around these parts "debolopment") considerations. \n\n[Quoting from this Carnegie Endowment](http://carnegieendowment.org/2015/06/23/understanding-indian-voter/iawy) paper to expand on this point.\n\n&gt;&gt;Good economics can make for good politics in India. While parochial considerations have long been thought to play a central role in shaping voters’ choices, evidence from state and national elections suggests that macroeconomic realities are increasingly relevant.\n\n&gt;&gt;Politicians who seek to gain strength using identity-based appeals alone have generally not fared well. While voters may harbor deep-seated social biases, identity-based concerns and economic evaluations are both in play. The most successful politicians have mastered the art of skillfully combining both types of appeals.\n\nEven if you look at the rise of AAP, even if is as of now centered only around Delhi / NCR and Punjab, it has been achieved without using identity / casteist politics. Previous movements which had similarities to AAP such as the rise of Laloo or even Mulayam all had to engineer casteist alliances to get their goal of reaching power. They did promise clean governance, an end to corruption, more access to those in power, but had to marry it to good ol caste / identity politics to actually make headway. Once they reach their goal, they then realised it was easier to actually just continue on their caste / identity agenda and seek reelection than actually work and seek reelection on their own merits.\n\nAll this is falling by the wayside. If you look at incumbency and agricultural growth (or degradation) there is a strong case that can be made for development politics, even if it remains rooted to caste based identity driven politics.\n\nLook at states that have over the past...10 years that have won reelections or conversely lost it, and look at agricultural growth or lack of it, and including the NDA I\'s disastrous "India Shining" campaign you will see that a politician / party can ignore the rural sector only at his peril. ABVP, Chandra Babu Naidu, Sonia / MMS are all text book cases of people (and parties) seeking reelection at a time of rural distress and losing miserably. At a state level, MP, Gujarat, Bihar (of Nitish) all had an upsurge in agri growth which then saw them being reelected. I could go into details, but it is of enough length to warrant its own individual topic.\n\nWe are the same India that 35 years ago had a rubber stamp parliament with a rubber stamp president veer dangerously close to having our own dictatorship. Ask yourself, do you even see that happening today? \n\nTo use an analogy, imagine you are this obese, 150 kg person starting on the Couch to 5k program. You are now on Week 2, Day 1. Things are horrible, you are wheezing too much, you sweat copious rivers of...well sweat, and then you see marathon runners who started training 20 years ago just effortlessly run past you (the First World nations), you see your previously obese neighbour who started his diet and other regimen 5 years before you effortlessly run a 10 mile marathon (China) and then you look at your pitiful performance and deride yourself (as you rightly should), but you should also look back on Week 1 Day 1, when you couldn\'t even take 5 steps forward without a threat of collapse. You are now able to jog for 60 seconds at a stretch. That is huge progress.\n\nSimilarly, the India of today  is struggling, suffering and horribly behind in almost every measure of a civilised nation, but do keep in mind, 50 years ago we had zero industry, 12% literacy rate and almost neglible exports (of the finished goods variety), and always on the verge of a famine without even having self sufficiency in food. We ran a controlled almost socialistic economy where phones were instruments only for the really rich and even then it took (as recently as 1990) upto a year or more to get one line and an instrument.\n\nTake systems and bureaucracy - Even 5 years ago, paying an electricity bill meant spending half a day in queue, bribing the lineman to cut your bills and no concept of electronic meters. Today? It is seamless, electronic meters give you an accurate and pretty much untamperable reading, and even if you are poor and have no internet connection, you could approach the neighbouring internet kiosk guy who will pay it online for you for an extra fee of Rs 10-25.\n\nLook at Passport Seva Kendras for one more instance of how things have improved, or even police systems. They are still brutal men for the most part, but there is more accountability built into the system. Take the example of the OP who called the police in Hyderabad. I can guarantee you that 5-10 years ago, the cops would have asked OP to go fuck himself. Even if you look at social changes, 10 years ago, one would dare not sit in the corner seats because...spit. Spit was everywhere, theatres today are far far far more cleaner.\n\nEven infrastructure, there has been a slow, but perceptible shift in our road network, or the availability of cheap commerical flights (our railways are still stuck in the 1970\'s though). I remember doing my first car ride to Bangalore in 1991. It was a 2 lane, with no median "National Highway". It took us 11 hours.\n\nNow? It is a 6 lane modern e-way which minus the assholes who don\'t follow rules (like the odd truck barelling down the wrong side), it is built to international standards, and the journey can be safely done in 4.5 hours (can be done sooner, but you need to violate our speed limit of 100 to achieve this)\n\nWe have a long way to go, but don\'t forget where we started in 1947.\n\nWe were in 1947, 500 tiny princely states, and major states had huge divides (language, culture and religion) resulting in every "seer" in the US and UK predicting doom. We had no industry to speak off, we were all illiterate for the most part. We were told that we will all fight and balkanise (you should read some of those alarmist articles, they are pretty funny) or the great famine will cull millions and then we will balkanise.\n\nInstead we threw up legends (good or bad) like Nehru, Patel, Sastri, Kamraj, Ambedkar and others who shaped and moulded our system and gave it strength. We had legends like Sarabhai who took us forward in science and tech. We had geniuses like M.S.Swaminathan (and of course, the eternally unsung Borlaug) who gave us the ability to feed ourselves. All this is also innovation and development, not just developing Apple or Google.\n\nLike I said, we have a long way to go, we have 300 Mn people going hungry every day. Our IMR is worse than large parts of sub-Saharan Africa, another 300 mn people are not connected to an electric grid....but if you plot these numbers for 1947, 1957, 1967 and every decade since, you will see a forward movement, and this movement has picked up steam since 1991 (thanks to the other unsung hero PVN).\n\nKeep the faith is all I can say.\n\nRequesting you to keep responses on topic and clean of political partisanship please.\n\nEdit - If you take data from 1973, India had a 3% share in the world GDP (down from 4.2% in 1950, thank you Indiraji), the UK had a 4.2% share. In 2010, India\'s share is 5.4% (a 1.4% increase in such large scales is huge) while the UK\'s is down to 2.9%. It is another matter that China went from 4% share in 1973 to a near 15% share in 2010. Our average GDP growth rate since 1947 has been ~ 4.5% (this includes the 2 decades of Hindu rate of growth under first Nehru and later Indira Gandhi). \n\nIn 1950 we produced 50 Mn tonnes of foodgrains, 1Mn tonnes of steel, 2.7Mn tonnes of cement, 32 Mn tonnes of coal and generated 6.6 Bkw of electricity.\n\nIn 2010 it is 257Mn tonnes of foodgrains (a 500% increase in 50 years), 73 Mn tonnes of steel, 223 Mn tonnes of cement, 500 Mn tonnes of coal and 1051 Bwwh of energy. In other words, we have added 21 BKW of electricity every year.\n\nThis is a textbook example of forward movement. We can complain about how power goes out for an hour or so a day (if you are in a city), and between 2-12 hours (depending on the state), but if you take TN as an example and narrow it down to my village (anecdotal I know), in 1987, we had power only for 8 hours a day in my village. One tap water connection for 4 streets, and water would come for only 45 minutes at any random point in the day. 1 in 10 houses might have had a telephone with maybe 1 in the whole village with STD facility. Roads in and around the place were terrible, non existent inside, 1 lane potholed highway with highway robbers operating in some parts (robbing lorries mostly). Going from Bodi to Madurai (70 km\'s) was an ordeal and took 3-4 hours.\n\nBy 2014, we have maybe an hour of outage every two days. Every house has tap water (sure it is not exactly safe to drink out of the tap, but if you had to trudge 3 kms to the village well to fetch water and then boil it, this is heaven) and we have a solid broadband connectivity to boot. Every road inside the village has been laid with cement and we have 4 lane state highways connecting to a 6 lane NH, and going to Madurai is a matter of an hour tops.\n\nIs this not progress? We can and should complain about how shitty the schools are, or how unsafe the drinking water is etc etc, we have a lot to complain about. We should complain about how an entire street has no electricity connection and have to use bootlegged connections, or how there is no proper sewage system, but do keep in mind, just 30 odd years ago, we didn\'t even have bijli, sadak nor pani.\n\nLike I said, keep the faith.'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'glfzy1'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/glfzy1/amidst_all_this_gloom_about_the_india_story_i/</li>

Like the most current nations on Earth.  \n \n\n\\- **A joint nation:** a nation contain from at least 2 portion/shares nation. And those portion nation either share the same economy system or the same military defend, but must have share the same language/culture. A joint nation government will act as observer,advice provider, special report receiver from citizen like corruption, abnormal activities like virus/disease outbreak in each portion nation.  \n \n\n\\- **A portion/shares** **nation**: a nation who still have a government control almost everything like other independence nations but have some sort of “special” relationship with other portion nation in that join nation.  \n \n\n\\- **A economic nation:** a nation who the government only control the economic system while they rely on other nations for the military/safety defend at some cost.  \n \n\nSo you may have some big joint nation such as China, Korea, India, etc. and some portion nations like North Korea &amp; South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet &amp; other small portion nations in China, etc.  \n \n\nYou do not and cannot report tell the government how corrupt they are because they are acting from both player and referee job.

Evidences and testimonies in a number of terrorist attacks were discarded and fake proofs created to implicate Hindus such as Col Purohit and Sadhvi Pragya. All such Hindus implicated in name of Hindu terrorism were later acquitted of all charges by highest courts. Some of these incidents where evidences was tampered with are mentioned in the book.\xa0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7. In order to implicate Narendra Modi and Amit Shah in murder of assassin Ishrat Jahaan and her associates, UPA ministers like Sushil Kumar Shinde lied about not getting access to terrorist David Headley. Major portions of his testimony to Indian investigators was excised and fake allegations against Modi, Shah and even USA govt were raised.  \n\n\n8. MHA investigations had proven that Ishrat was a terrorist while UPA regime was trying it’s best to prove her innocent. In order to win the case, UPA raised numerous hurdles and planted fake evidences and testimonies like that of now jailed and disgraced policeman Sanjiv Bhatt. Officials in central and state departments and courts were instructed to not allow submission of evidence and documents which could have proven that Ishrat was on a mission to assassinate Modi and that the encounter that killed her was genuine. Author describes some of his own stories about how officials taking order from UPA ministers tried their best to push this agenda. A number of officers were hand picked by UPA ministers and installed by ignoring procedure in key positions to peddle the political and communal agenda of Congress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n9. This fact is not that well known, but intelligence reports suggested that Pakistan planned to capture a few ministers and officials as hostages during 26/11 attack. They had very specific intelligence inputs about presence of such targets in some locations. This along with how easily terrorists managed to find and attack targets in a huge city like Mumbai could not have been possible without moles\xa0in government. He has provided a name of an official who was actually inside the Taj Hotel as terrorists were killing people inside. Yet she managed to come out without a scratch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10. A team of key officials was visiting Pakistan and was scheduled to comeback on 26 Nov. A suspicious officer who had nothing to do with the talks (muslim name) was added to delegation at the last minute. Pakis suddenly deliberately extended the visit and took the team offgrid as the attack was under progress. This caused confusion and delays in Indian counter-terror operations on 26/11\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n11. Author was part of the team investigating the attacks and attempts were made to assault/kidnap him. This is one incident describing how Delhi police who worked directly under the HM responded. Later he and his parents were harassed in their homes by CBI and Delhi police. He names many Delhi police and CBI officers who harassed him multiple times to force him to drop his complaint. He directly states that UPA HM was pulling all the strings and blames them for death of his aged parents. His son was fired from his job after his employers got calls from CBI.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n12. He also dismissed claims of any surgical strike done during 2006-2010 period as mere fiction.  \n\n\n**BASIC SUMMARY**:\n\n1. UPA govt manufactured the bogey of Hindu terrorism by destroying evidence and creating fake documents to implicate Hindus in terrorist attacks done by muslims. This was presumably done to check rise of BJP under Narendra Modi.\n\n2. This and their general incompetence led to weakening of Indian institutions and rise in terrorist attacks.\n\n[http://jjamwal.in/yayavar/book-the-myth-of-hindu-terror/](http://jjamwal.in/yayavar/book-the-myth-of-hindu-terror/)'<br />Author: 'dark-ritual'  id: 'glbjff'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/glbjff/book_the_myth_of_hindu_terror/</li>

Even Viśvāmitra, a great sage and perfect yogī, was misled by Menakā into sex enjoyment, although the yogī was endeavoring for sense control with severe types of penance and yoga practice. And,of course, there are so many similar instances in the history of the world. Therefore, it is very difficult to control the mind and the senses without being fully Kṛṣṇa conscious. Without engaging the mind in Kṛṣṇa, one cannot cease such material engagements. A practical example is given by Śrī Yāmunācārya, a great saint and devotee, who says: "Since my mind has been engaged in the service of the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and I have been enjoying an ever new transcendental humor, whenever I think of sex life with a woman, my face at once turns from it, and I spit at the thought."\n\nKṛṣṇa consciousness is such a transcendentally nice thing that automatically material enjoyment becomes distasteful. It is as if a hungry man had satisfied his hunger by a sufficient quantity of nutritious eatables. Mahārāja Ambarīṣa also conquered a great yogī, Durvāsā Muni, simply because his mind was engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the difference between a Krishna conscious person and other transcendentalists ?

Tamils are not gonna shy away from remembering that and venerating the fact testament of history.\n\nBut according to the rhetoric of many on the Pan-Indian right, it’s normal to gloss over these facts in order to uphold being wedded to the dogma of how cultured and amazing Indian civilization was because we never invaded people outside of the subcontinent.....I mean, seriously?\n\nThis is also the reason why I don’t feel the need to drag the British for conquering the entirety of the subcontinent and ruling it for a 100+ years.

So they would always go for halal to expand  customer base, because Jhatka consumers are very less. Even if due to some social media campaigns now a few people opt for jhatka and now some retail chains like bb, etc introduce jhatka choice or in some resturants introduce in menu, but in few days when economics would take precedence then they would revert to older days. Isn't it? Why? Because 90pc (all including Hindus, muslims, Sikhs, rest) do not care if it's halal or jhatka, and would go for cheaper choice. They go for price (primarily).\nIt's similar to organic food situation. Moreover u can always sell normal food with organic label and nobody will know.\nIt's the same reason why in India we don't get humane killed animals through electric shock. Nobody cares and so no market.\n\nOk, somebody can say that say Sikhs should have choice.

Skardu Airbase is located in Gilgit-Baltistan area of \u200b\u200b[Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK)](https://www.newsdaily.buzz/2020/05/pakistans-plot-against-india.html).\n\nInterestingly, China is helping them in this feat.

Pakistani Air Force C-130 transport aircraft is continuously delivering equipment to Skardu Airbase, located close to the Union Territory of India, Ladakh.\n\nIndian security agencies are also keeping a close watch on the antics of Pakistan along the border.

Even though labour reforms, land reforms and the new law of contract farming weren\'t upvoted and discussed as much as a title of "Gilgit Baltistan, India", we\'re starting to seek development too. \n\nSince we can\'t advise left crowd to not be anti Hindu and be neutral and they can\'t advise us to not be anti Islam, let\'s discuss what right wing can improve on. \n\nWhere do you guys think the right balance is ? I personally think that if government isn\'t capable enough to communicate with everyone of what the bill includes, in every  Indian official language and make sure that there\'s no room for twisting of facts, they shouldn\'t introduce bills like CAA. I don\'t know if even a single Hindu from Pakistan is gonna use it but it has done enough damage for our PR in the right time when PR was actually needed to promote Make in India. While I think sending Bangladesh illegal immigrants back, is absolutely necessary, I don\'t know how it\'s gonna turn out to be, since our milk bread PM, talks like he\'s too tired to be on camera and leaves so much room for propaganda that even governments/major media of other nations hear about the propaganda version more than the PM\'s version. \n\nWe have so much of poverty. Just too much of it. No other large nation is in our position today. Are we going to be left behind economically and live the same lifestyle while the rest of the world keeps getting better?  I think we\'re getting too deviated from the main goal. It\'s absurd that such big protests should have happened for economic reforms/job market as there are so many people living next to drainages in certain poor areas and are dying of starvation even after 70 years of independence that it\'s a shame on the nation no matter which way you look at it. Instead, all that massive shit show was for helping few thousands of Hindus in Pakistan, if at all they care to accept the help which we have no idea if they would.\n\nWhat can we do , to make right wingers to romanticize economy and entrepreneurship as much as the religious angle that\'s occupying 90% of our brains. \n\nFighting bias is the utmost priority but while doing that are we just doing too much disservice to ourselves just by our mouths and then the left stepping in and creating more bias to counter right from overstepping and right strikes back, the the cycle doesn\'t seem to stop. While it\'s what happens in most democratic countries between left and right, in their context, I think we\'re at a point where we can\'t afford bad PR anymore. It\'s coming to a point where India is not only called poor but also called as religious intolerant for the first time in the history on such a wide scale. There has to be a way of fighting bias without riling up emotions and enablling people to create controversy (mostly avoidable as they are just sensationalist statements in the heat of the moment) and show as much interest in the country\'s growth. I may not have worded my argument in a way that doesn\'t trigger your defense mechanism and make you wanna shoe the whole argument away, but, I hope I was clear enough about where our priorities lie.'<br />Author: 'Kittykingg'  id: 'gkz1w9'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gkz1w9/so_this_is_why_i_think_we_are_falling_behind_and/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Mythbusters - Taken from Rahul Gandhi's website"<br />Body: '"A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting its shoes on"\n\nHere, for your entertainment, are some of the craziest tales spun by the opposition\'s propaganda factory. And the truth.\n\n**What about the viral video where Rahul Gandhi speaks about ‘aloo ki factory’?**\n\nContext is everything. That bit was a fragment of an interaction with distressed farmers in Uttar Pradesh. One farmer suggested a potato chip factory in the region, to which Mr Gandhi responded. The entire interaction is presented here (comment in question at 1.22) Farmers’ concerns and agricultural policy are clearly not as ‘viral’ as a sentence plucked out of context by an opposition more comfortable with jeering than thinking.\n\n[https://vimeo.com/300017070](https://vimeo.com/300017070)\n\n**Wait, another aloo question. Why did he talk of a machine that would turn potatoes into gold (aloo se sona niklega)?**\n\nThat is indeed a ludicrous thing to say. Only, Rahul Gandhi didn’t make that claim, he was making fun of the prime minister’s outrageous promises. Again, a fragment of the speech was deviously presented by the BJP’s team, to suggest the very opposite. Here is the full video, for those who care about the truth.\n\n[https://vimeo.com/300018438](https://vimeo.com/300018438)\n\n**Why did he claim that connecting MRI machines would improve healthcare in India?**\n\nIn a question about healthcare, one of the the ideas that Mr Gandhi referred to was the internet of things. Connecting devices like MRI machines, CT scanners and other equipment through the cloud and analysing their findings is an important part of diagnosis and care. This data-driven approach is the future of healthcare, and it is already a reality in many parts of the world. So Rahul Gandhi was referring to a global trend that his critics may not yet be aware of.\n\nFor those who want to know more, here is a handy article from the [Economist](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/02/01/a-revolution-in-health-care-is-coming)\n\n**What in the world did he mean by escape velocity of Jupiter?**\n\nRahul Gandhi was speaking about the extra push needed for Dalits to reach the same footing as others. As a socially disadvantaged community, it takes greater effort for them to shake off the downward pull of their environment. Just like it takes greater energy to escape Jupiter’s gravitational field than that of earth.\n\nEscape velocity is also a commonly used term in social research – take this example from [Harvard Research](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/lkatz/files/aer.103.3_fryer_katz_pp_2013_all_0.pdf)\n\nIt’s not that hard to understand, even for the BJP.\n\n**Why did he say ‘poverty is a state of mind’?**\n\nRahul Gandhi had said that apart from material deprivation, poverty is also a state of mind. This is borne out by social science research on the psychological effects and insecurities created by scarcity and precarity.\n\nMedia headlines mangled his words to suggest he said poverty is only a state of mind. As usual, the BJP cried hoarse. The Dalit Resource Centre of the Gobind Ballabh Pant Social Science Institute, where Rahul Gandhi made the statement, clarified the facts, and most newspapers carried corrections the next day, but the damage was done. Deliberately. Read: [Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/rahul-spoke-about-poverty-of-thought-clarifies-host/story-ERPthC1QhVxjxuZM0ZWgMM.html), [Indian Express](http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/institute-quotes-rahul-gandhi-as-saying-poverty-is-just-a-state-of-mind/1152249/)\n\n**Why did his “woke up this morning, last night” go viral?**\n\nBecause to err is human, and to mock is the BJP. It was a slip of the tongue. Happens to everyone, especially those whose words are constantly watched.\n\nThis list is likely to keep growing. Lies will continue being generated, because the only limits are in the BJP’s imagination. Some of these allegations, though, are more serious and unconscionable than others:\n\n**What is the truth about the Sukanya rape case?**\n\nThis charge, cooked up by political opponents and peddled on foreign websites, was struck down by the Supreme Court of India for being “without substance and without an iota of evidence” . Not only that, the court heavily fined the petitioners for causing reputational damage to Rahul Gandhi. Half of that penalty was due to Rahul Gandhi, and half to the woman who they claimed had been raped. Read: [NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rape-allegations-defamed-rahul-gandhi-says-supreme-court-cbi-may-explore-foreign-angle-502158), [Mint](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/JXeMExPzO8PeL9k7S7m1FI/Supreme-Court-dismisses-case-against-Rahul-Gandhi.html)\n\nThat this malicious lie continues to lurk in a right-wing echo-chamber shows that some people are impervious to the truth and contemptuous of due legal process. They will go to any length to discredit someone they don’t like.\n\n**Was Rahul Gandhi detained in Boston with drugs?**\n\nNo. Those sharing these fantasies, without offering even a shred of evidence, are obviously smoking something strong.\n\nTaken from [https://rahulgandhi.in/en/faqs.php](https://rahulgandhi.in/en/faqs.php)'<br />Author: 'Difficult_Boat'  id: 'gkvdmb'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gkvdmb/mythbusters_taken_from_rahul_gandhis_website/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Defining moment for Indian agriculture'<br />Body: '&gt;**There are decades where nothing happens, and there are weeks where decades happen.\xa0 - Lenin**\n\nI saw a couple of posts on this in the sub, but I think the agriculture reforms that the FM announced yesterday are not getting their due appreciation/discussion/critique here. So, here I give a summary of the reforms and some relevant good quality data links. \n\nAs mentioned in one of the links:\n\n&gt;**I would dare say that the regulatory reform needle for Indian agriculture moved more yesterday (15 May) than it did during the last seven decades**\n\nThere are three major reforms:\n\n* **Amendment to Essential Commodities Act** \\- Was done during agri production shortages of 1950s socialist era; would be amended to deregulate cereal, pulses, edible oils, onion, potato, etc. No restrictions on export, stocking.\n   * This means farmers and traders will be free to enter into export commitments without the fear that the government may turn the tap on or off based on domestic prices or production.\n   * In simple words, say there is sudden increase in onion prices due to heavy rains and the prices of onions rise from 30-&gt;100. Now ECA kicks in and farmers have to sell at 30, not 100(though the final consumer is still paying 100). Also, they can no longer export their produce. But there is a lag period b/w the farmers being forced to sell at 30 and the price dropping back to 30 and the price diff in this lag period is pocketed by the middlemen.\n   * It will also make India a reliable supplier in the agri-produce export markets. Nobody(let alone importers) like unreliability.\n* **APMC Reforms** \\- Central law to give farmers choice to sell, enable interstate trade, e-trade of produce.\n   * Currently, Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) laws force farmers to sell only to government-licensed agents at these demarcated *mandis*, thus denying them fair prices\n   * **Now think at a micro level**: a farmer may rush to the *mandi* based on a certain price expectation, but when lots of farmers arrive at the same *mandi* with their produce, the excess arrivals end up strengthening the buying power of the agents and prices crash. The farmer can, of course, take his produce back home, but this means incurring additional transport and storage costs\n   * Once e-trading is allowed and deliveries can be made outside one’s own state, farmers can sell at an acceptable price and deliver wherever it is advantageous to them\n* **Contract Framing -** It tackles all the problems of Indian agriculture:\n   * Think from the perspective of Reliance. Reliance wants to sell potato chips. Currently it has to source the potatoes from some middleman(most probably an APMC agent) who aggregate it from some small level farmers. Now Reliance knows that it needs to sell potato chips for the next 2 years. So, instead of sourcing it form middle men, Reliance will enter into contract with a large number of small farmers to get a large area of land, provide them with best seeds, technology etc. This will deal with the problems of **lack of scale**; **lack of tech.** as now the reliance has incentive to enhance production; **crop diversification** as earlier maybe most of the contract farmers would have grown rice/wheat(as the govt. guarantees to buy these at a fixed price, no matter the amount of production); provide an implicit **insurance to the farmers** as they now know the big company has promised(legally) to pay them at least Rs x/quintal. \n   *  **Cut out the middleman**: allow buyers and sellers to divide that middleman’s margin between themselves, thus benefiting both producers of food and consumers \n\nSources:\n\n1.

The process of restriction from sense enjoyment by rules and regulations is something like restricting a diseased person from certain types of eatables. The patient, however, neither likes such restrictions, nor loses his taste for eatables. Similarly, sense restriction by some spiritual process like aṣṭāṅga-yoga, in the matter of yama, niyama, āsana, prāṇāyāma, pratyāhāra, dharaṇā, dhyāna, etc., is recommended for less intelligent persons who have no better knowledge. But one who has tasted the beauty of the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa, in the course of his advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, no longer has a taste for dead material things. Therefore, restrictions are there for the less intelligent neophytes in the spiritual advancement of life, but such restrictions are only good if one actually has a taste for Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

      <li>Title::: 'Secularism in India - Is it possible?'<br />Body: 'Is secularism possible In India? I posit it is not. I would suggest there are five key challenges that make it impossible. \n\n1. Heterogenous Mythical India - The country is fragmented religiously, culturally, linguistically, racially - there is little or no harmony between the various states, regions, castes etc. Maharashtra believes they are better than others, Punjabis and Sikhs believe they are far more hard working than every one else in India, North Easterners barely fit in with the rest of the country and UP/Bihar are looked upon as the most undesirable Indians. How does pursuit of equality in fundamental beliefs go when there is little or no harmony on any other values or behaviors.\n2. Hostile Neighborhood - The country is surrounded by countries that are theologically strict and one that is going through a fundamentalist phase globally. A community surrounded by aggressive ones creates an undesirable reaction of push back to maintain their own identity and values. When this situation is further compounded by a history of enmity and war - in fact existential crisis that has extended over 70+ years - it creates further challenges of distrust.\n3. Ummah and Global Salafism - The main dissenting religion has been going through a phase of moving back to fundamentals globally and there are now Florentian preachers - Salafis and Wahabis - who are taking a literal view of the literature (pun intended). This disconnect between a global community that puts the religion before the national identity is bound to create further fissures. The ummah and the brotherhood bound by common religious, social values creates a separate communal circle that often doesn’t overlay well with the national values and cultures. In case of India, as articulated earlier, a heterogenous cultural and value landscape makes the overlay even more hazardous. Furthermore, when the religion becomes focused on one single way to live and be accepted - to the explicit exclusion of other who don’t follow their tenets - secularism can’t survive by definition. The “Kafirs” can only follow their religions - paganistic, idol worshipping and at odds with the people of the book - to the “wrong” end! This creates further tension in the society that no constitutional remedy can alleviate\n4. Islamic State - The countries where Islam followers are in majority are almost universally deemed constitutionally Islamic and monotheistic. This creates two further complications - \n\ta. Asking for equal rights in secular countries becomes a bit of hypocritical ask when people from their home country of different faith are ill treated in these Islamic countries mainly for their ability to follow their belief system\n\tb. Population that lives and works in these countries comes back to India after having enjoyed the unique freedom that unconstrained blend of theologically driven social and legal system brings. This would never be the case in the most other countries - secular or non-secular. This creates a new level of expectations that are hard to meet in India. The creation of ghettos and further alienation through coalesced communities then creates communal misunderstandings, divides and eventually discord.\n5. Secular Chip on the shoulder - Liberal left and intellectuals in every country aspire for the idealistic goals of equality and harmony as it is always more appealing to their values - in fact to every one regardless of their leanings. The challenge is always the way the political realities and entitlements add up. Some religions have succeeded in their ability to extract compromises and concessions to allow them to practice their religions - as their religion is more strict and enforces more strict requirements that require the society around them to overcompensate. Political parties also quickly factor in these challenges and start working on vote banks to create further arbitrage in exchange for political power. Over time these concessions pile up and create a distinct sense of alienation for the local majority. Whether this is about building a temple or funding a university that is monotheistic in it’s admission policies, reservations, affirmative actions etc - all of this discussions become a communal and sectarian tussle as increasingly this is a zero sum game. The minorities feel that more concession or appeasing they are, more their rights will be tread upon and vice versa. This confrontational zero sum game over time becomes existential crisis with no place for secularism.\n\nThe only model India has to proceed on peacefully would be one fo declaring a state religion of the majority and protect the minorities through a charter of rights. This would mean that we would do away with the sense of equality and the arbitrage the politicians extract from this. It would give more sensible basis of rights to all the communities in the country and might even prompt more generosity. It will mirror the regional reality in terms of other neighboring countries and how they treat their minorities. It will also be aligned with most OECD countries - where the lack of heterogeneity and imposition of the dominant religion values and cultures creates far more harmony than false attempts secularism does!'<br />Author: 'distantindian'  id: 'gk668q'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gk668q/secularism_in_india_is_it_possible/</li>

And according to the UN population prospect report of 2019, around 60% population of India will live in cities.\n\nEvery minute, 25-30 people are migrating to cities from rural areas for a better quality of life and livelihood.\n\nUrban areas have a very large population but there is low land availability to cater to that much population which is not enough.\n\nThen, it makes the situation worse for the urban people and they have no choice other than to live in slums.\n\n**How are problems arising in cities?**\n\nThere are many reasons in cities which push people to live in slums and which are following-\n\n1. Very high Land prices and monopoly of private builders;\n\n2. Poor implementation of government schemes and programs like Indira Awas yojana and PMAY;\n\n3. Shortages of land in cities;\n\n4. The high price of the apartment;\n\n5. Poor and mismanagement of land;\n\n6.  As land and colonization is the State subject and when center programs which are related to the pucca house or land leasing were declared, then due to some political reasons and some repugnancy between state and center programs the whole purpose of these programs will get defeated;\n\n7. Delay in finance which is provided by state or center government schemes;\n\n8. The continued rise in the number of slum dwellers.\n\n9.  the biggest challenge is the availability of land. The CRISIL report estimates at least 30,000 acres of urban land is needed to build 1 crore houses.\n\n**Government schemes and programmes to build house for all in cities: -**\n\n**Pradhan mantri awas yojana (urban)**\n\nThis was launched in June 2015 and purpose was ‘Housing for all’ by 2022.\n\nIt has four pillars-\n\na) in-situ slum redevelopment; \n\nb) affordable housing through a credit linked subsidy scheme;\n\nc)affordable housing in partnership between public\n\nand private agencies and\n\nd) subsidy for beneficiary led individual house construction or enhancement.\n\nAs per the Economic Survey 2019-20, Ministry of Urban affairs approved the 1.03 crores home requests, in which 60 lakhs are grounded for construction and 32 lakhs are completed.\n\n📷\n\nA [report ](https://www.crisil.com/content/dam/crisil/our-analysis/reports/Research/documents/2018/december/home-run-chartbook-on-pradhan-mantri-awas-yojana-urban.pdf)by ratings agency CRISIL in December 2018 reveals that house completion rates under PMAY (Urban) have been low across most states.\n\n📷\n\nWith house completion taking an average of two or three years, the government needs to finish sanctioning all homes by 2020 in order to finish all construction by 2022, the report states.\n\nThe report estimates the government will need Rs 1.5 lakh crore to meet the target of building 1.2 crore urban houses by 2022. Only 22% – around Rs 33,000 crore – has been disbursed so far.\n\nHow to solve the problem?\n\n1. Collaboration of government schemes like: MGNREGA, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Skill India mission and PMAY (U) gets collaborated then this holistic approach provides affordable housing, employment, semi-skilled and skilled labour force and same time clean and safe house and city.\n\n2. “[Global Housing Technology Challenge](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/government-launches-global-housing-technology-challenge-to-build-houses-in-shorter-time/articleshow/67528562.cms)” which aims to encourage better construction technologies that will enable building houses faster at a lower cost. By using new technology, we will reduce the cost of maintenance also.\n\n3. Timely available funds will help to complete the house timely and same time will help to achieve the target of housing for all.\n\n4. Rent regulation laws and strict implementation also change the situation because like in Mumbai, according to economic survey 2015-16, 5 lakhs houses are empty and same time 54% population of Mumbai lived in just 9% land.\n\n5. Self-house building is one of the best solutions in cities like Mumbai and Delhi.\n\n6.

The senses are compared to venomous serpents. They want to act very loosely and without restriction. The yogī, or the devotee, must be very strong to control the serpents-like a snake charmer. He never allows them to act independantly. There are many injunctions in the revealed scriptures; some of them are do-not's, and some of them are do's. Unless one is able to follow the do's and the do-not's, restricting oneself from sense enjoyment, it is not possible to be firmly fixed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The best example, set herein, is the tortoise. The tortoise can at any moment wind up his senses and exhibit them again at any time for particular purposes. Similarly, the senses of the Kṛṣṇa conscious persons are used only for some particular purpose in the service of the Lord and are withdrawn otherwise. Keeping the senses always in the service of the Lord is the example set by the analogy of the tortoise, who keeps the senses within.\n\n**Question 1 : What simile has been given to describe the senses ? How they can be controlled ?**\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3wryb71qjvy41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1658ccf16f6140ddd6c0e225b9f7cff2ab5d43c\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'gk410q'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gk410q/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_258/</li>

He is called a muni fixed in mind. Such a fully Kṛṣṇa conscious person is not at all disturbed by the onslaughts of the threefold miseries, for he accepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord, thinking himself only worthy of more trouble due to his past misdeeds; and he sees that his miseries, by the grace of the Lord, are minimized to the lowest."\n\n"Attachment means accepting things for one\'s own sense gratification, and detachment is the absence of such sensual attachment. But one fixed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness has neither attachment nor detachment because his life is dedicated in the service of the Lord. Consequently he is not at all angry even when his attempts are unsuccessful. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person is always steady in his determination."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 2.56, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/evm7t0u6zqy41.jpg?width=332&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34ad9377325d39ebeaa1f9dd7b6acef85b3b734d\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

Assamese sentiments were provoked. Rallies were conducted across the state and a promise not to give away even an inch of land was taken. A massive U-turn was taken when Modi ji came to power and a deal was signed without taking the state unit of the party into confidence.

Modi ji had a golden chance to end the issue once and for all. Positive sentiments were at an all time high after his address in the Parliament.

      <li>Title::: 'What we can learn from the unfolding demise of a(non-Muslim) culture: the Kalash of Pakistan'<br />Body: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElKjQkpZeQA&amp;feature=youtu.be\n\nThis is a fairly long documentary on the Kalash. There are a few good articles on it as well on the web. I wrote a comment in r/Pakistan about it but obviously I was banned. I'll paste bits of it below and you can check my history for the original comment.\n\n---\n\nOk, so I've been reading about the Kalash for a few months now and I'll list my observations below. I'd love to hear some counter points. \n\nThe Kalash are considered Mushrik or at best Kaffir (hence Kaffirstan). So the first question is do they even deserve to be 'protected' or 'exist' as a cultural entity. According to Islam they should either be killed or converted.\nThe Pakistani state(including the army) is not directly concerned with matters of conversion or killing anymore and their actions are mostly 'outward', this much is clear, and has been post 1971.\n\nSo this obviously means that it's civillian activity. This purported 'conversion', which is cause for greater alarm or business as usual depending on the perspective. So what are the important takeaways:\n\nThe Kalash women move about FREELY, choose their romantic partners FREELY, and have agency over their bodies, minds, and speech that is impossible in the Islamic societies of the sub-continent.\n\nThe educational system of the Islamic republic of Pakistan will obviously teach Islam is the 'truth' and the kaffir deserves X and the Mushrik ...\n\nSo the formal education that the Kalash recieve is that 'you are kafir(or mushrik), and to attain heaven you HAVE to convert.\n\nThe women are romanced or propositioned by Muslim men and they convert. The men convert because of the pressures from direct missionary activity but more so because of Kalash Muslim converts. There was a very big case where a 14 year of Kalash girl married a Muslim man, and the Kalash took to the streets to demand her return(and conversion) but the Muslims obviously retaliated with the simple argument that now that she is a Muslim, there is no question of reconversion. Let's even assume that the girl gave 'consent'. She has not been seen since. Again I'm going by Pakistani reportage.\n\nTwo important points:\n\nSo now every Kalash family has converted members to Islam. As the women are converted by marriage, they cannot 're-convert', they are confined in the usual Islamic ways- bodily, speech, mentally.\n\nThere is a proliferation of Mosques in their area which is the usual 'missionary' activity.\n\nSo far NOTHING I've written above has any 'forced conversions' in the sense that Indians or the Western media talks about wrt to Pakistan. The men, women, and girls are converting on their own.\n\nBut one thing is clear: When the two cultures come in contact: the Kalash and the Muslims of Pakistan(and Muslim Kalash even), the Kalash will necessarily 'perish'. Their culture is as good as gone. Now if you're a Muslim you're thinking, 'obviously that's good for them since now they can go to heaven(at least the men)'.\n\nBut if you are able to think in terms of the pressures that are exerted over the Kaffir and Mushrik by the misssonary activity outlined above, ignoring outright violence for a second, you might think : the present of the Kalash is the past of the Muslims of the sub-continent.\n\nPerhaps Muslims think 'good for us'. Perhaps the poignant reality of a 'kaffir' culture that will disappear in a decade might be an excellent starting point of inquiry."<br />Author: 'sniperinthebushes'  id: 'gjirwl'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gjirwl/what_we_can_learn_from_the_unfolding_demise_of/</li>

Assamese sentiments were provoked. Rallies were conducted across the state and a promise not to give away even an inch of land was taken. A massive U-turn was taken when Modi ji came to power and a deal was signed without taking the state unit of the party into confidence. Assam ending up losing 10,000 acres of land and having to intake 10,000 new citizens.\n\nKalapani as an emotive issue has been exploited left and right by both NC and the communist parties since the early 90s. Modi ji had a golden chance to end the issue once and for all. Positive sentiments were at an all time high after his address in the Parliament. No one in UK had issues or emotional attachment for the land.

Not by Delhi directly but by Nagas breathing down on them from the hills. I was unfortunate to be on the receiving end of the 2010 blockade. It was a golden chance for India to win back the heart of Meitei separatists. But no prompt action was taken to defuse the situation and the blockade continued. All essentials carrying trucks remained stuck outside the state. The food and gas prices continued to shoot up as the days passed and many dispensaries ran out of medicine.

      <li>Title::: 'Frustrated due to lack of manufacturing in India (a musician/ drummer’s perspective)'<br />Body: 'Hi all! It’s a little long but please do give this a read. \n\nCurrently I’m a student but I also play drums. I’ve been playing for about 10 years and I’m almost at a professional level now... it’s my art and my favourite form of recreation. \n\nI’m posting this since there is a recent talk about manufacturing in India and I want to share how the lack of manufacturing affects me. I don’t know about other instruments but for drums there is negligible manufacturing happening in India.\n\nThe drums that are manufactured in India are super cheap and cost up to 10K rupees. There isn’t any specific company that makes them. They are what one would say "local” and literally pieces of wood just put together into the shape of drums without any sound quality or anything and they sound horrible. I had one when I just started drumming 10 years back and would never go back to even touching a kit like that. \n\nThere are music shops in the country where you can purchase drums from famous American company’s like Tama, Ludwig, Pearl, DW and others. None of them are manufactured in India... all imported. Only their lower to mid range drums are available (though they are worlds better than the local ones) and that too at a higher cost than what it would cost in the US. (Or any other developed country where drums are manufactured). They can range from 60K to 1.5 Lakh rupees. My personal drum-kit cost me about 90K rupees. When I bought it 5-6 years back I used to think that a drum kit of this cost and this level would surely be the most professional kit in the world. But that wasn’t true.\n\nAs someone who is moving to a professional level these ranges aren’t enough. My dream drum kit (and almost all high end drum kits) can not be purchased from music shops in India.\nYou can’t purchase them online and get them shipped to India. The only way that I could think of was to go to US (which would cost money), buy the drum-kit (which costs around 3 Lakh Rupees) then get it moved to India by international movers (which would cost another 2-3 lakh rupees). \n\nIf these companies were manufacturing in India I wouldn’t have to pay all the extra expenses for my dream drum kit. But unfortunately they are not.\n\nIf there was an Indian company that manufactured high quality drums (instead of several independent sub-quality manufacturers that just shape wood into sub-sub-quality drums) maybe the cost of a similar high end drum kit would have been a third of my dream drum kit. \n\nA similar thing happens in case of Cymbals (those metal plates that we hit). They aren’t manufactured in India and cost a lot more than what they should.\n\nSome people are motivated to study, work hard and get rich to buy expensive cars. My motivation is to buy my dream drum-kit. I love drumming and stuff like this makes me feel frustrated. In my life I want to help the poor in our country but I find my own dreams fading away due to the realities of our country.\n\nThere are many drummers in India that can’t get proper equipment because it’s too expensive. \n\nIndia has a lot of scope in the field of drumming and percussion instruments. Apart from modern acoustic drums we also have so many indigenous percussion instruments. \n\nPlease send your suggestions or ideas on how this problem relates to your own personal problem, how the general problem of manufacturing in India affects the middle/upper-middle income families of India and how we can fix this problem in our country.'<br />Author: 'wthislyf123'  id: 'giw572'<br />Score:58<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/giw572/frustrated_due_to_lack_of_manufacturing_in_india/</li>

Those countries are transparent in their scope, and their governments have made an effort to satisfy their citizens that it's not going to be a permanent feature in their lives after the pandemic has been handled. \n\nNot denying that having our country based app is significant, but it’s a shame to see that it’s a government mandated battery draining app on our phones with no sense of privacy (although they reportedly claim that privacy exists and data collected is not being misused), persistent connection to cellular data and GPS, data collection is massive.\n\nIt could be minimal by design where the app is relying on Bluetooth (now that Bluetooth LE is standard on all smartphones for low battery usage) rather than the more focused use of GPS having our precision data every second the device is connected to the Internet. They could’ve generated a basic heat map. Instead, they’re making data of COVID-19 patients online on google maps, with precision data and geotagging! I'm not sure how it can be an essential asset considering that it's a geotag and data being available to the public.\n\nNow, the alarming situation is that this app is also being used as a pass-based system (for example, railway travels). Do you see what I'm talking about?\nAnd some people are getting arrested for not installing the app? Given that cellphone is a personal device, installing that app should be voluntary, and forcing people to install the app and making them blindly agree to app’s terms and conditions, specifically for the app being also used as a pass and at the same time having privacy issues is so unlawful, especially if there aren't any existing laws for privacy. If that doesn’t tickle your brain, I don’t know what does, maybe because you don’t understand what privacy means!\n\nAnd to all the people claiming, “I’ve done nothing wrong and have nothing to fear, only those who do wrong have a reason to fear.” \nThat’s right, you may not have anything to fear or hide, but that doesn’t mean you don’t draw the curtains in your house 😅 \n\nNow, to all the people on my timeline shouting praises of this app, blatantly denying breaches and vulnerabilities, take a look at the link!\nI’m not totally against this app, just a valid and undeniable opinion! It sure does look worrying if they don’t address these massive issues and unless they have a valid “Sunset Clause” / ”Shelf life” / avoid pivots as a pass system for this app, and they fix the major issues, welcome to mass surveillance, people."<br />Author: 'sagarpachorkar'  id: 'giscpk'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/giscpk/aarogya_setu_app_mandate_illegal/</li>

What you should\'ve said is that Extremism should end on both sides. Claiming that you\'re discriminated is a lie. You\'re living a better life in India than most of the Islamic countries. If Muslims feel the need to protect themselves then Hindus are justified to do the same too. It\'s the last country Hindus have got i.e. India. 24 Islamic Republics and the only country with majority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains is still ready to be secular just because they care for Muslims. Things like Halal certification denying jobs to non Muslims, PFI replacing Hindus with Pakistani muslims in Kashmir and then claiming Kashmir as always a muslim majority, complaining any sign of Hinduism as communal hate, media being afraid to speak against Jihad and whenever someone speaks against Jihad, FIRs are filed on them from all over India, etc is just a scratch of the deep roots Radical Islam has in India. When India wants to seperate good Indian muslims from Radical ones from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and save Minorities from persecution in the stated Islamic republics, with help of CAA, Indian muslims are burning streets to protect the radical muslims that are illegal immigrants from surrounding enemy Islamic republics irrespective of their country just because they are muslims and you guys don\'t care if they are against India. You\'re the ones making it worst by breaking the trust of India. When India and Pakistan (Prior to 1971) was partitioned India had 7% muslims and Pakistan(Pakistan+(Islamic Republic)Bangladesh) had 22% Hindus but still Pakistan immediately became an Islamic republic while India is still secular to this day. And now Islam has reached almost 20% population in India while Hindus in Pakistan+Bangladesh (post 1971) have been persecuted and reduced to merely 9% and still face persecution upto this day. Even the "peaceful" protests of Shaheen bagh aren\'t very peaceful seeing they murdered some people from the local area and threw them in gutters. Please go elsewhere to spread your propoganda of sympathy from exmuslims and Victimizing radical Islam hiding behind the lines of "women supporting Zakir Naik".\n\nIndia is just protecting itself against radical islam and the recent outcry against muslims now is a bi product of muslims supporting radical Islam in India. Violence against muslims is way less than violence by muslims in India. Spitting and stoning doctors, stoning policemen, cutting people with swords just because they asked you to wear a mask, etc.\n\nSorry if it sounded harsh but I\'m tired of just one false image being pushed by muslims on every place on the internet.

One can know his specific symptoms from the Bhagavad-gītā. Most important is how the man in Kṛṣṇa consciousness speaks, for speech is the most important quality of any man. It is said that a fool is undiscovered as long as he does not speak, and certainly a well-dressed fool cannot be identified unless he speaks, but as soon as he speaks, he reveals himself at once. The immediate symptom of a Kṛṣṇa conscious man is that he speaks only of Kṛṣṇa and of matters relating to Him."  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 2.54, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y90pf4w5lcy41.jpg?width=677&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2a7ba853907fd9acc34b689d21897170f994301\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: "VD Savarkar, one of RSS' most venerable thought leaders, advocated using 'rape' as a political tool. He believed Muslim women should be raped to avenge the Muslim rule in India."<br />Body: 'It  is honestly baffling how much we have allowed the normalization of the  RSS, and what little attention is paid to the fact that the two key  progenitors of this organisation, Golwalkar and Savarkar, openly admired  Hitler and Mussolini. What makes this a lot worse is that the praise  continued on into the late 1930s, when it was clear that Nazis were  rounding up and persecuting Jews and other minorities. Unlike Bose,  whose support was out of anti-colonialism, these people admired the  ideology of the fascists. Some quotes from Savarkar validate this:\n\n"There is no reason to suppose that Hitler must be a human monster  because he passes off as a Nazi, Nazism proved undeniably the savior of  Germany."\n\n"If we Hindus in India grow stronger, in time these Muslim friends of  the League type will have to play the part of German-Jews instead."\n\n“The very fact that Germany or Italy has so wonderfully recovered and  grown so powerful as never before at the touch of Nazi or Fascist  magical wand is enough to prove that those political ‘isms’ were the  most congenial tonics their health demanded.”\n\nA nation is formed by a majority living therein. What did the Jews do  in Germany? They being in minority were driven out from Germany.”\n\nThis is from Golwalkar\'s book which was published in 1939:\n\n"German race pride has now become the topic of the day. To keep up  the purity of the race and its culture, Germany shocked the world by her  purging the country of the Semitic Races - the Jews ... a good lesson  for us in Hindustan for us to learn and profit by."\n\nThis is the same organisation which rules India by proxy, through  various BJP leaders who were all RSS karyakartas at one point in their  political careers. It is the Constitution and our democracy which  prevents them from taking complete control, but they remain an  existential threat to the idea of India. It is surprising how little  most Indians know about this topic, and when you confront any garden  variety sanghi/fascist with this information, they are quick to  prevaricate and seek nuance, nuance not reserved while attacking and  defaming their political rivals.\n\nI have a lot more to vent on this issue, but I will cut this short.  This is not the lame liberal anti-Modi type argument, it goes way beyond  that, and few people realize its implications. Next time the BJP brings  up Nehru and Indira and your obnoxious friend brings up the Congress\'  checkered history, do make it a point to bring this up. If history is  what makes people decide who to vote for or not, then these facts  deserve to be brought up in the public discourse as well.\n\nLinks for further reading: [https://www.ibtimes.com/hindu-nationalists-historical-links-nazism-fascism-214222](https://www.ibtimes.com/hindu-nationalists-historical-links-nazism-fascism-214222)\n\n[https://frontline.thehindu.com/static/html/fl1915/19151160.htm](https://frontline.thehindu.com/static/html/fl1915/19151160.htm)\n\n[https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/gowalkar-savarkar-and-jews/220768](https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/gowalkar-savarkar-and-jews/220768)\n\n[https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/foreign-hand-in-the-sangh-rss-hindu-society-muslims-christians-5117648/](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/foreign-hand-in-the-sangh-rss-hindu-society-muslims-christians-5117648/)\n\n[https://indianexpress.com/article/research/vinayak-damodar-savarkar-135th-birth-anniversary-he-admired-hitler-and-other-lesser-known-facts-about-him-5194470/](https://indianexpress.com/article/research/vinayak-damodar-savarkar-135th-birth-anniversary-he-admired-hitler-and-other-lesser-known-facts-about-him-5194470/)\n\n[https://www.newsclick.in/why-jaitley-needs-study-link-between-rss-and-fascism](https://www.newsclick.in/why-jaitley-needs-study-link-between-rss-and-fascism)\n\n[https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/hitlers-hindus-indias-nazi-loving-nationalists-on-the-rise-1.5628532](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/hitlers-hindus-indias-nazi-loving-nationalists-on-the-rise-1.5628532)\n\ncredits:anon'<br />Author: 'oiltel'  id: 'gi9z3r'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gi9z3r/vd_savarkar_one_of_rss_most_venerable_thought/</li>

Consequently, it is rightly said herein that one has to give up all kinds of sense desire manufactured by mental concoction. Artificially, such sense desires cannot be stopped. But if one is engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then, automatically, sense desires subside without extraneous efforts. Therefore, one has to engage himself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness without hesitation, for this devotional service will instantly help one on to the platform of transcendental consciousness. The highly developed soul always remains satisfied in himself by realizing himself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord. Such a transcendentally situated person has no sense desires resulting from petty materialism; rather, he remains always happy in his natural position of eternally serving the Supreme Lord.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the qualities of a person situated on the platform of transcendental consciousness ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hl9e6e4uu9y41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f45db0db387c2e89a5e7f78d75b92bd91fd372f9\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'gi52gt'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gi52gt/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_255/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Despite TV actors running the state, significant infringe elements in Tamil poltics, and a freebie culture to attract votes -Tamil Nadu is one of the most industrious states in India. Should that be a role model for other states and the central govt? - By Balaji Viswanathan'<br />Body: '#### Which is the oldest technical institute outside Europe? College of Engineering, Guindy in Chennai.\n#### Which is the oldest modern civic body in the world outside Europe? Chennai Corporation.\n#### Which was the first railway line in India (and possibly Asia)? In Chennai. India’s first railway line\n#### Which is the second largest container port in India? Chennai port. 3 of India’s 10 largest ports are in Tamil Nadu.\n\n---\n\n# Inherent Advantages of The Madras State\n\nUniversity of Madras\nwas first of the 3 modern universities to be setup in India. Madras had among the first of the IITs and for a long time the only state to have both REC and IIT. Bank of Madras \nwas among the oldest banks of India, that was merged with Bank of Bombay and Bank of Calcutta to make Imperial Bank [now State Bank]. Madras was one place to have a combination of physical infrastructure [railways, ports, roads], educational infrastructure [CEG, IITM, NIT, Univ of Madras] and governance structure. In parallel, Coimbatore and Madurai became big centers of textile mills and great centers of commerce. \n\n**How many of these had the hands of Dravidian parties? Zero.**\n\n\n\nIndia’s first indigenous nuclear plant was built 1 hour south of Chennai and India’s major rocket launch station was built 1 hour launch of Chennai.\n\n---\n\n**If you take a big pot of boiling water off the stove, you will continue to see the pot hot for a long time. That doesn’t mean the stove is on. Tamil Nadu’s pot was heated a long time ago and it is surviving despite all the abuses that has been done to it.**\n\nAt the time of independence, the Tamil region had a formidable presence in India. 3 of the 7 people who were drafting the Constitution of India were Tamils. The first 3 people to win the Bharat Ratna were Tamils. The only Indian to be the Governor General was a Tamil.\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, Madras was an eminent city not just of India, but one of the largest cities in the world. Its Corporation is the second oldest corporation in the world. Chennai - the 2nd oldest Corporation in the world\n\n. Its Presidency had a stupendous control over rest of the south and with bully power got favourable water sharing with Mysore and Travancore among many things.\n\n---\n# Added Advantages Post Independence\n\n*Water is not the only thing we got it in our favour. In 1952, Madras and Bombay together got the government to enact the Freight equalisation policy that has made the Indian government give raw materials to any part of India at the same cost. Thus, a ton of coal would cost the same in Patna/Calcutta as it did in Madras although the former is closer to the mines. This allowed industries to flourish in Bombay and Madras at the cost of Indian east.**\n\n**When the Madras state was divided, the Tamils got the capital city of Madras that left the Telugu people gasping. Madras was the premiment center of education in South Asia that produced Nobel laureates and geniuses like Ramanujan. It was one of the most revolutionary states when it comes to education and social values. It had industry, administration, education and great ports.*\n\n---\n# Reality of Dravidian political policies\n\nSome more data. Here you can see 4 decades of change in a state’s fortune. In 1960, Tamil Nadu was at 102 [100 means the income was same as Indian average]. By 1990 it came below Indian average and only in mid 90s it once again went above Indian average on the back of the IT revolution.\n\nIn the 30 year period from 1960–90, the state percapita income grew at 2.8% lower than India’s at 3.5%. All other states with major cities accelerated in the same period.\n\nhttps://icrier.org/pdf/wp144.pdf\n\n---\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThat is the power of Dravidian parties. Not just Tamil Nadu’s pre-eminence, but Chennai’s water bodies were also lost in the Dravidian rule as the real estate mafia run by politicians ransacked the city for its profits.\n\nThe Tamil people have been quite an ambitious people and its Chola empire was one of the key global empires to be built out of India. And they usually got things done. While there are people who emigrate from every state, how many states had got their culture in the host country? Notice the Tamil scripts in the currencies below.\n\nWhen the Dravidian parties took over the state in late 1960s they took over all the advantages of the most dominant state of India. It was like the Dhoni of 2011 — can put the ball anywhere. Now, what is the state of Chennai or Tamil Nadu? Is it the #1? Leave alone whole India, even in the south, Chennai can no longer claim the top title.\n\nWhile the Dravidian parties have done a few things well, most of the advantages of the state — the infrastructure, industries, education were built long before they came.'<br />Author: 'indra_sword_rises'  id: 'ghuqe6'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ghuqe6/despite_tv_actors_running_the_state_significant/</li>

Then why do we make it all about women, that they\'re the only one facing discrimination? Ever heard about \'pussy pass\'?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, \'equality\' here is not \'equality of outcome\'  rather it is \'equality of opportunity\'.\r\n‘Equality of Outcome’ requires that individuals have some share of goods. ‘Equality of Opportunity’ requires that people ought to be able to compete on a “level playing field”.\r\nSo, having share based on some group\'s representation in population is not "feminism".\r\n\r\nSecondly, women and men are equal (in terms of value) not same (physically, physiologically, psychologically, emotionally). So first understand what \'equal\' means.\r\nWhat irks me is the number of people who reduce feminism to blindly agree to everything a woman says or continually reinforcing a woman’s belief in her ability to do ‘anything a man can do’. You can\'t do all the things a man can do , and you shouldn\'t try to either.\r\n\r\nThirdly, ‘Woman empowerment’ is another term thrown around like plastic wrappers in India.\r\nSex, drugs and profanity on the daily is not \'women empowerment\' as some movies and TV shows nowadays would like you to believe. Reducing the cut-off percentage for girls in DU colleges isn’t empowering anyone except those already empowered; true empowerment would come around only when every girl in the remotest village of this country goes to school without once thinking that she’s lucky to be able to do so. I don’t see why a woman should need a lower percentage to qualify anyway. Education should always be a level playing field. Equality is in equal opportunity.\r\n\r\nFourthly, majority of "feminists" are hypocrites. A woman could literally get away with anything by ending her sentence with ‘because Feminism’. No, you do not deserve an added portion of respect just because you happened to be born a girl. You deserve the same amount of respect as any other human being. Whatever respect you get after that depends on how you earn it. Don’t tell me I’m supposed to know how to talk to ‘ladies’ because I don’t. I know how to talk to human beings and I’m sorry if that’s not enough for you, but that’s my idea of equality. Women can wait in line for their turn and can offer a seat to a man.\r\nIf a women accuses a man of sexual assault he\'s automatically the culprit. As we\'ve recently seen in \'boislockeroom\' controversy and on countless other occasions. No one knows if they\'re culprit or not, but there are screenshots and a women accused them so it must be true.\r\nBill Maher, the comedian pointed out, in one of his stand-ups, that if someone said men were smarter than women, there would be a chorus of disagreeable challenge; however, if one said that women were smarter than men, everyone would cheer almost reflexively because that’s just how society is. We’re selectively moral. We pick and choose the values and morals and ethics we’d like to follow as per our own convenience. That\'s not how feminism or pseudo-feminism works.\r\n\r\nFifthly, Feminism’s goal is to create a society where men are taught that expressing their feelings does not make them less of a man and where women are taught that they are strong too. It wants a society where men are no longer taught that “crying is for girls” so that they can actually communicate their feelings and problems and have more successful relationships with women throughout their lives. It is men who mostly suffer with depression, anxiety, suicide, loneliness. They are seldom complemented, appreciated, and guided. They are supposed to figure out life on their own, be successful, not be emotional, provide for family and be strong. But no one tells them \'how?’ 1 in every rape victim is a man. Men are not supposed to talk about sexual assault because then they\'re \'pussies\' and are supposed to consider themselves \'lucky\'. \r\nFeminism wants a society where men aren’t expected to always be the moneymaker of a family and women are able to provide for themselves without expecting a man’s support. 90% of women marry a man who earns equal or more that them. If a man stays at home, takes care of children, and his wife earns, then he\'s a loser somehow, but a housewife is a "shero".\r\nFeminism wants a society where a woman is seen as an individual before she is seen as a sexual being or a baby maker and where a man and woman can be seen equally as parents and treated fairly in parental or custodial issues.\r\nSo the next time you throw that word around unthinkingly, ask yourself, are you even worthy of using that term?'<br />Author: 'xxvish24xx'  id: 'ghlw21'<br />Score:21<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ghlw21/dear_feminists/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Sprouts-The protein booster'<br />Body: "                       Sprouts\xa0\n\n\nWhen I was a child, everyone told me that eat sprouts daily which is good for your health and bodybuilding. At that there was no awareness in the people about eating sprouts. But tody when I see the market, it is full of all type of sprouts. Sprouts is one of the best protein supplement for vegetarian people's. There are various types of sprouts which includes sprout of matki (moth or mat bean), mung (green gram), kala chana (Bengal gram), chana (chickpea), etc. There are some other sprouts also which includes the sprout of bean, sunflower, radish, wheat, soyabean, onion, mustard, etc.\n\nDifferent types of sprout\n\n1)\xa0Bean and pea sprouts:\xa0Such as lentil, adzuki, garbanzo, soybean, mung bean, black bean, kidney bean, green pea and snow pea sprouts.\n\n2)\xa0Sprouted grains:\xa0Such as brown rice, buckwheat, amaranth, kamut, quinoa and oat sprouts.\n\n3)\xa0Vegetable or leafy sprouts:\xa0Such as radish, broccoli, beet, mustard green, clover, cress and fenugreek sprouts.\n\n4)\xa0Nut and seed sprouts:\xa0Such as almond, radish seed, alfalfa seed, pumpkin seed, sesame seed or sunflower seed sprouts.\n\n\nHow to do sprouting:\n1) soak your seed, nuts, whole grain, legumes overnight\n\n2) rinse with fresh water in the morning and then every 12 hours for 1-2 days\n\n3) store in a glass jar with cheese cloth over the top or in the cheese cloth or in the sprouting bag for sprouting\n\n4) expose the fresh sprouts to the sunlight before eating to increase chlorophyll content\n\n\n\nWhat is sprouting?\n\nSprouting is the natural process by which seeds or spores germinate and put out shoots, and already established plants produce new leaves or buds or other newly developing parts and experience further growth.\n\n\n\nWhy to eat sprouts instead of raw?\n\n•The nutritional changes that occur while sprouting mainly happen due to the breakdown of complex compounds into very simpler forms. The process helps in the development of some essential nutrients, constituents and also plays an important role in the breakdown of anti-nutrients(natural or synthetic compounds that interfere with the absorption of nutrients) that make the whole phenomenon of sprouting possible. They provide our body all the essential minerals and vitamins when they are used on a regular basis in our diet.\n\n•Sprouting grains causes increased activities of hydrolytic enzymes, improvements in the contents of total proteins, fat, certain essential amino acids, total sugars, B-group vitamins, and a decrease in dry matter, starch and anti-nutrients.\n\n•soaking(hydration) of seeds leads to increase the metabolic activity of seed. Due to this Complex biochemical or metabolic changes occur during sprouting. The reserve chemical constituents, such as protein, starch and lipids, are broken down by enzymes into simple compounds that are used to make new compounds.\n\n•increase in protein quality(means conversion of protein into albumin and globulin and increase increase in proteolytic activity). Proteolytic activity bmeans break down of protein during sprouting which helps ease in digestion.\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Due to this reason this is called as\xa0predigested food.\n\n\n\nProfits of eating sprouts\n\n1) they are alkaline, whole, pure and natural foods. Alkaline foods can affect the acidity in the stomach and pH of bodily fluids( blood, urine).\n\n2) as sprouts contain large amount of fiber and partially digested protein leads to free us from many digestive problems. Most importantly constipation problem.\n\n\n\n\nFurther read on following link\n\nhttps://kbjawadwar.blogspot.com/2020/03/sprouts.html"<br />Author: 'kbjawadwar1'  id: 'ghgbjo'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ghgbjo/sproutsthe_protein_booster/</li>

If one can reach the platform of understanding by service to the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa, he has no longer to execute different types of penances and sacrifices as recommended in revealed scriptures. And, similarly, if one has not understood that the purpose of the Vedas is to reach Kṛṣṇa and simply engages in the rituals, etc., then he is uselessly wasting time in such engagements. Persons in Kṛṣṇa consciousness transcend the limit of śabda-brahma, or the range of the Vedas and Upaniṣads."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 2.52, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iksrw2lghyx41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f9daea1b1a3eb4e4ad6958fe7f9c3023fa37292\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: 'Finished Reading Shivaji and His Time by Jadunath Sarkar. I felt one section of the last chapter is worth reproducing here in full'<br />Body: 'Firstly, the book is available for free download on [archive.org](https://archive.org). I would really recommend everyone to read the entire last chapter, on the nature of the kingdom of Shivaji, why it failed and what was the real genius of Shivaji. Excerpt from the book follows\n\n**Causes of Shivaji\'s failure to build an enduring State**\n\nWhy did Shivaji fail to create an enduring State? Why did the Maratha people stop short of the final accomplishment of their union and dissolve before they had consolidated into an absolutely compact political body? \n\nAn obvious cause was, no doubt, the shortness of his reign, barely ten years after the final rupture with the Mughals in 1670. But this does not furnish the true explanation of his failure. It is doubtful if with a very much longer time at his disposal he could have averted the ruin which befell the Maratha State under the Peshwas, for the same moral canker was at work among his people in the 17th as in the 18th century. The first danger of the new Hindu kingdom established by him in the Deccan lay in the fact that the national glory and prosperity resulting from the victories of Shivaji and Baji Rao I. created a reaction in favour of Hindu orthodoxy; it accentuated caste distinction and ceremonial purity of daily rites which ran counter to the homogeneity and simplicity of the poor and politically depressed early Maratha society. Thus, his political success sapped the main foundation of that success. \n\nIn the security, power and wealth engendered by their independence, the Marathas of the 18th century forgot the past record of Muslim persecution; the social grades turned against each other. The Brahmans living east of the Sahyadri range despised those living west, the men of the hills despised their brethren of the plains, because they could now do so with impunity. The head of the State, though a Brahman, was despised by his Brahman servants belonging to other branches of the caste - because the first Peshwa\'s great-grandfather\'s great-grandfather had once been lower in society than the Desh Brahmans\' great-grandfather\'s great-grandfather! While the Chitpavan Brahmans were waging social war with the Deshastha Brahmans, a bitter jealousy raged between the Brahman ministers and governors and the Kayastha secretaries. We have unmistakable traces of it as early as the reign of Shivaji. "Caste grows by fission". It is antagonistic to national union. In proportion as Shivaji\'s ideal of a Hindu swaraj was based on orthodoxy, it contained within itself the seed of its own death. As Rabindranath Tagore remarks : \n\n"A temporary enthusiasm sweeps over the country and we imagine that it has been united but the rents and holes in our body-social do their work secretly ; we cannot retain any noble idea long. \n\nShivaji aimed at preserving the rents ; he wished to save from Mughal attack a Hindu society to which ceremonial distinctions and isolation of castes are the very breath of life. He wanted to make his heterogenous society triumphant over all India. He wove ropes of sand ; he attempted the impossible. It is beyond the power of any man, it is opposed to the divine law of the universe, to establish the swaraj of such a caste-ridden, isolated, internally-torn sect over a vast continent like India" \n\nShivaji and his father-in-law Gaikwar were Marathas, ie. members of a despised caste. Before the rise of the national movement in the Deccan in the closing years of the 19th century, a Brahman of Maharashtra used to feel insulted if he was called a Maratha. "No," he would reply with warmth, "I am a Dakshina Brahman." Shivaji keenly felt his humiliation at the hands of the Brahmans to whose defence and prosperity he had devoted his life. Their insistence on treating him as a shudra drove him into the arms of Balaji Avji, the leader of the Kayasthas, and another victim of Brahmanic pride. The Brahmans felt a professional jealousy for the intelligence and literary powers of the Kayasthas, who were their only rivals in education and Government service, and consoled themselves by declaring the Kayasthas a low-caste not entitled to the Vedic rites and by proclaiming a social boycott of Balaji Avji who ventured to invest his son with the sacred thread. Balaji naturally sympathised with his master and tried to raise him in social estimation by engaging Gaga Bhatta who "made Shivaji a pure Kshatriya". The high-priest showed his gratitude to Balaji for his heavy retainer by writing a tract in which the Kayastha was glorified, but without convincing the contemporary Brahmans, \n\nThere was no attempt at well-thought-out organised communal improvement, spread of education or unification of the people, either under Shivaji or under the Peshwas. The cohesion of the peoples in the Maratha State was not organic but artificial, accidental and therefore, precarious. It was solely dependent on the ruler\'s extraordinary personality and disappeared when the country ceased to produce supermen among its rulers. \n\nA Government of personal discretion is, by its very nature, uncertain. This uncertainty reacted fatally on the administration. However well-planned the machinery and rules might be, the actual conduct of the administration was marred by the inefficiency, sudden changes and official corruption, because nobody felt secure of his post or of the due appreciation of his merit. This has been the bane of all autocratic States in the East and the West alike, except where the autocrat has been a "hero as king" or where a high level of education, civilisation and national spirit among the people has reduced the evil.'<br />Author: '1984_is_overrated_af'  id: 'ggzxnl'<br />Score:40<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ggzxnl/finished_reading_shivaji_and_his_time_by_jadunath/</li>

Today we all know about jowar but we don't prefer to eat jowar. We eat wheat roti instead of jowar bhakri. We don't prefer jowar bhakri because it requires alot of energy to make and eat roti( to chew). Jowar is full of\xa0antioxidants, fiber and nutrients.\n\n\n\xa0It is also called as Jwari in Marathi, Cholam in Tamil, Jolal in Kannada and Jonnalu in Telugu.

It acts like a\xa0binder, holding food together and adding a “stretchy” quality. Gluten can trigger adverse inflammatory, immunological and autoimmune reactions in some people who have gluten sensitivity. But for other people it is good source of energy.

      <li>Title::: 'As criticism of Aarogya Setu by western media and their Indian lackeys like Arundhati Roy gathers steam its worth looking at the data.'<br />Body: 'What, do the countries that have so far been effectively flattening the curve have in common? Part of the answer is that they tend to be in East Asia — China, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and to a lesser extent Japan — where a collectivist spirit may encourage civic-minded embrace of and a more willing compliance with governments’ infection control. In addition, these countries tend to be actively deploying technology to collect data on the virus’s progress and efforts to contain it, including tracking those who are infected and their contacts. \n\nIn contrast the "democracies" — the U.S., Spain, Italy, and France, are faring less well. But it does not stop them or their yapping dogs in Indian media from acting as authorities on stopping the epidemic.\n\nIn East Asian countries, this has been more mandatory than voluntary. In Singapore, a country known for its efficiency and no-nonsense government, citizens are encouraged by the government to install TraceTogether, which exchanges Bluetooth signals between mobile phones in close proximity. This is a modern counterpart to the traditional and time-consuming contact-tracing method, which relies on fallible human memory. A government poll reported in Nikkei Asian Review found that more than 70% of respondents supported this move. Hong Kong, which has also seen effective containment, recently implemented a mandatory 14-day quarantine upon entry for all overseas arrivals. To enforce this, the Hong Kong government required each new arrival to download the StayHomeSafe app and gave them a paired wristband that uses geofencing technology to help catch violators, and, as reported in Quartz, warned anyone violating the quarantine that they could face up to six months in prison and a $3,200 fine.\n\nSouth Korea, where The Washington Post reports that private developers took it upon themselves to develop apps that supplement official government contact tracing efforts, which many find insufficient. Corona 100m, which, according to MarketWatch, South Koreans downloaded over one million times in just a few weeks with “overwhelmingly positive reviews,” collects data from public government sources that alert users of any diagnosed Covid-19 patient within a 100-meter radius along with the patient’s diagnosis date, nationality, age, gender, and prior locations. Corona Map similarly plots locations of diagnosed patients to help those who want to avoid these areas and, as Business Insider reports, was the second-most-downloaded app in Korea. A vibrant democracy that has also won praise for its Covid-19 containment, Taiwan is believed to be the first to have used mobile phone tracking to enforce quarantines, which the government reportedly reinforces by calling those in quarantine twice a day to ensure they do not evade tracking by leaving their phones at home.\n[Source](https://hbr.org/2020/04/how-digital-contact-tracing-slowed-covid-19-in-east-asia)\n\nIn countries where the apps are opt-in rather than mandatory, we’re not seeing adoption rates nearly that high yet. [Source](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/18/21224178/covid-19-tech-tracking-phones-china-singapore-taiwan-korea-google-apple-contact-tracing-digital)\n\nThe apps won’t achieve their purpose unless they are widely used.

How one can get rid of them ?**  \n**Answer 1 :** "Owing to ignorance, one does not know that this material world is a miserable place where there are dangers at every step. Out of ignorance only, less intelligent persons try to adjust to the situation by fruitive activities, thinking that resultant actions will make them happy. They do not know that no kind of material body anywhere within the universe can give life without miseries. The miseries of life, namely birth, death, old age and diseases, are present everywhere within the material world. But one who understands his real constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the Lord, and thus knows the position of the Personality of Godhead, engages himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Consequently he becomes qualified to enter into the Vaikuṇṭha planets, where there is neither material, miserable life, nor the influence of time and death. To know one\'s constitutional position means to know also the sublime position of the Lord. One who wrongly thinks that the living entity\'s position and the Lord\'s position are on the same level is to be understood to be in darkness and therefore unable to engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord. He becomes a lord himself and thus paves the way for the repetition of birth and death. But one who, understanding that his position is to serve, transfers himself to the service of the Lord, at once becomes eligible for Vaikuṇṭhaloka."  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 2.51, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/218a9s3nyqx41.png?width=599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a12a0b0998565119fc9bbbe619f24cc2c255139a\n\n  \nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

It is the type of pod and it's large production is in india. young seed pods and leaves used as vegetables and for traditional herbal medicine. Drumstick tree\xa0 is a\xa0fast-growing, deciduous tree that can reach a height of 10–12 m (32–40 ft) . It's branches are very fragile(easily broken). Almost all parts of tree is\xa0edible(flower, root, leaves, pods,, etc).\n\nDrumstick have many names in many different languages such as shevaga in Marathi, shajan in Hindi, murungai in Tamil, muringnga in Malayalam and munagakaya in Telugu. Drumstick is also known as\xa0superfood\xa0because every part of this tree has its medicinal value. It is the vital component in traditional medicine.\xa0It shows anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, Analgesic and Muscle relaxant properties\n\n\n\nVitamin and mineral content:\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Drumstick pods are full of the nutrients such as\n•\xa0vitamin: Vitamin A, Thiamine (B1), Riboflavin (B2), Niacin (B3), Pantothenic acid (B5), Vitamin B6, Folate (B9), Vitamin C\n\n•\xa0mineral: calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus,potassium, sodium, zinc, etc with lot of dietery fiber, essential amino acids and antioxidants(scavenges the free radicals and prevents oxidative damage).\n\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Tip: it contains large amount of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium(large) and vit.C.\n\n\nBiological classification\n\nKingdom:PlantaeClade:TracheophytesClade:AngiospermsClade:EudicotsClade:RosidsOrder:BrassicalesFamily:MoringaceaeGenus:MoringaSpecies:\n\nM.\xa0oleifera\n\n\nLeaves:\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 The leaves are the\xa0most nutritious part of the plant, being a significant source of B vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin A , vitamin K, manganese, and protein.

      <li>Title::: 'As a huge Modi critic, I must say this : The Labor Reforms are a bold and necessary move in the current crisis...'<br />Body: "Just a heads-up : I have been a big critic of Modi's social policies, but as a staunch proponent of Capitalism, I must say that the recent labor reforms are, unironically, a bold and necessary move. Or as Modi-fans would say, a **masterstroke**.\n\n\nMany people are rightfully worried about the potential exploitation that our labor force would have to undergo because of the scrapping of essential labor protection laws, but just for once, let's put our emotions aside, apply realpolitik and see the whole thing from a bird's-eye view. I will try to simplify everything as much as I can.\n\n\n&gt;First, the background :~\n\n\n#1.  Companies are leaving China.\n\nAnd mind you, these companies were running sweatshops in China where workers were exploited to no end and the workers didn't even have any choice because of the Chinese government's authoritarianism. These companies now want a similar venue to host their factories.\n\n\n#2.  Unemployment was already at a historically high level before the pandemic, and currently the situation is getting worse with each passing day.\n\nHuge numbers of migrant workers are going home, and the Hindi-belt governments need to provide them employment as soon as the pandemic is controlled. This is because even if the pandemic is controlled, things will not be the same as before. Movement will be definitely restricted, until a vaccine is available and everyone is shielded against the virus.\n\n\n#3.  The global narrative is heavily against China right now,\n\nand India has always been proposed as an alternative to China for manufacturers. The current geopolitical scenario is in India's favor.\n\n\n&gt;Now, let's see the reforms from a Capitalist point of view :~\n\n\n\n#1.  DON'T see the reforms as a labor exploitation proposal.\n\nThese reforms are basically incentives to attract those China-philic manufacturers to setup factories in India, and nothing else. That's why a relatively shorter deadline has been given for the validity of the scrapping (around 3 years).\n\n\n#2.  The 3 years that the government is getting will be a *buffer-time_duration*, in which the government can/will revamp the whole system itself.\n\nMany people have been arguing that the government should have introduced mild reforms instead of outright scrapping of laws, but the on-ground reality is very grim. Corruption is everywhere, then there's the lethargic bureaucratic processes, labor-mafias/*dalals*, etc. which are entrenched into the whole Hindi-belt, and their reformation will take time. The current scenario is too ripe for us to forego, and hence, scrapping makes perfect sense to attract the manufacturers. Most likely, the **appropriate labor laws will be reinstalled after the deadline**\n\n\n\n#3.  Jobs are always better than no jobs.\n\nArm-chair activists and champaign socialists may argue from their AC rooms that minimum wage and other stuff are the most important things for the workers, but when there's no job, and hence, no money, all those laws will be redundant and fool's-gold. The workers will be left with no money, and believe it or not, not every state is blessed like Kerala to have huge remittances from the Gulf. The pandemic has handed India's already struggling economy two things : One, an even bigger economic crisis. Two, a golden opportunity to heal India from the curse of Soviet Era policies, and usher into true Globalization.\n\n\n\n#4.  If such measures are not taken, India is absolutely fucked for the coming years.\n\n\nIndia's economy was struggling, but now it is in the point of utter destruction. The forecasts have proposed a 0% GDP growth rate for the fiscal year, and this is horrible for a developing economy. Fortunately, the pandemic has given us an opportunity to give India a boost similar to the 1990s Liberalisation, but for that, we first need the manufacturers to setup their bases in India. Only then can they be regulated afterwards.\n\n\n#5.  Essential labor laws to safeguard worker's basic human rights have been left-alone.\n\n\nTill **this** point, out of UP-MP-Gujarat, only Gujarat has left the most basic labor laws untouched, like minimum wage and a couple other stuff. Most probably, after a bout of outrage from the Opposition, MP and UP would also grant those basic rights.\n\n\nHope this post gives you an insight into the whole thing.\n\n\nRelevant Sources :~\n\n1.

      <li>Title::: 'Raghuram Rajan: Monetization: Neither Game Changer nor Catastrophe in Abnormal Times'<br />Body: '**This was shared on Rajan on his  LinkedIn profile. Excellent write-up.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ***Monetization: Neither Game Changer nor Catastrophe in Abnormal Times*** \n\n There is a lot of concern in some quarters about central banks printing money to finance large budget deficits. And in other quarters there is concern that central banks are doing too little of it. Some worry that central banks are lending directly to the government. Others are assuaged when central banks buy government debt in the secondary market but not directly. \n\nWho is right? Since a number of students have asked me about this, and since the pronouncements of many public commentators and even officials seem confused, here is a primer. There is no alchemy here, unlike the views of some – so called monetization is neither a game changer in stressed times nor a catastrophe. It helps a little at the margin, but does not solve the government’s fiscal problems nor does it lead to runaway inflation. If used in the wrong way, it could however be problematic.\n\n Since I have a number of Indian followers on LinkedIn, let me explain using the Reserve Bank of India’s current situation. RBI’s approximate balance sheet is below. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rpwezrz6ohx41.png?width=668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85a8ade2ba4098524092d5d39680d4cbdf20ef5c\n\n The RBI’s assets consisted of about 49 lakh crores (1 lakh crore = 100000 crore = 1 LC) in total, of which the bulk were foreign exchange reserves (around 33 LC), investments in government bonds (around 10 LC), loans (to financial institutions) of about 3.4 LC, and gold amounting to 2.3 LC. These are financed by the notes in circulation (around 24 LC) and the reserve deposits commercial banks and the government have with the RBI (both notes and deposits are RBI liabilities). The rest is RBI equity, built up over the years largely through its ability to finance itself with notes that pay no interest, as well as its foreign exchange reserves that appreciate every time the rupee depreciates.\n\n Suppose the government wants to spend a lot of money quickly. Let us say it wants to spend 1 lakh crore, which we will denote as 1 LC. It is best to distinguish two cases: A) Normal times and B) Abnormal times. In normal times, the government will sell 1 LC of government bonds or bills in the market. Let us say commercial banks buy them. Now the commercial banks will transfer 1 LC from their deposit account at the RBI to the government. The government will then spend down that account. We will come to that in a moment, but the net effect is the banks own the government bonds directly, and have paid the government for it out of their reserve account. So the banks have 1 LC less than their desired amount of reserve deposits.\n\n Let us say we are instead in abnormal times (like the present) and the government bond market is unprepared for 1 LC being issued suddenly. The government wants the RBI to buy the bonds directly. Let us say the RBI agrees (this has been prohibited by a past RBI/government accord). Now the RBI owns 1 LC of bonds, while the government has 1 LC in its deposit account. This is sometimes called money printing or monetization, though more appropriately, it should be called reserve creation. It looks like  2 the RBI is financing the government by expanding its balance sheet. But wait till we follow the trail to its end. At the end of either transaction, the government has 1 LC more in its deposit account. Now what does the government do with the money in its account? In both cases it will spend it. Let it be deposited in government employee accounts as salary. \n\nThey, in turn, will withdraw the money and spend it, and that money will be deposited by the local merchant in his bank account. Because the public had enough bank notes to begin with, most of the money spent by the government will be deposited back in bank accounts, which will then show up as increased bank reserves at the central bank. Put differently, unless the public wants more notes, and there is no reason to think it will, any spending by the government will show up as an equivalent amount of reserves held by the banks at the central bank. So the 1 LC in government deposits will show up after spending as 1 LC more of bank deposits at the RBI. Hereafter, once again, there is a difference between the two cases. In normal times, the banks had spent 1 LC from their RBI deposits in buying government bonds. If the earlier level of deposit reserves was what they were happy holding, they are satisfied once again when the 1 LC comes back into their deposit account. In abnormal times where the RBI bought the government debt directly, the banks now have 1 LC of excess reserves when the government spends its money. Reserves earn no interest if they sit in the bank’s deposit account at the RBI. \n\nIf times were normal, banks would “use” up the reserves by lending more (say to businesses) and thus also expanding the deposits their customers hold with them. Since they need to hold RBI reserves against customer deposits, the expansion in their customer deposits would ensure their larger reserves at the RBI are no longer in excess. However, all this new lending would be expansionary and fuel inflation. This is why the RBI is reluctant to accommodate the government in normal times. However, in abnormal times, banks are reluctant to lend to business.\n\n So they try and lend their excess reserves sitting in their RBI deposit account to other banks. No other bank wants it, so eventually these excess reserves are redeposited at an RBI special window called the reverse repo window at a low rate (currently 3.75%). Effectively, the RBI borrows from the banks through this window. \n\nOn net, the RBI holds the government bonds, and the commercial banks finance it at the reverse repo rate. Implications \n\n1) Direct RBI financing is sometimes loosely termed money printing and thought to be free. This is misleading. As we have seen, the government finances itself from the RBI, and the RBI finances itself from the banks at the reverse repo rate of 3.75%.\n\n 2) Instead of the banks holding government bonds paying 6% or so, they hold claims against the RBI paying 3.75%. Of course, the claim they hold is shorter term and possibly more liquid. Most important, it is not subject to interest rate risk. \n\n3) In abnormal times, the government gains by placing the paper quickly with the RBI, and the banks have no choice but to hold the excess reserves at a below-market rate. The only way out for an individual bank would be to make more loans or buy more government bonds. This it may  3 be reluctant to do because of the additional risks involved. Collectively, however, banks have no choice but to accept the reserves the RBI creates. This is why the financing is forced. \n\n4) Such direct financing is not inflationary per se, so long as banks are reluctant to lend further to business or consumers. However, as normal times return, the central bank will have to pay a higher rate on excess reserves, or sell its government bond holdings and extinguish excess reserves, else it will risk excessive credit expansion and inflation. This process of extinguishing excess reserves is manageable (though see the caveat below). \n\n5) The government does not get a free lunch. Not only is the RBI paying 3.75% for the money it on lends to the government (which will reduce the annual dividend the RBI pays the government commensurately), the banks get 3.75% instead of the 6% they could get by buying the government bonds directly. Since the government owns 70 percent of the banking sector, its dividends from public sector banks also falls commensurately. Essentially, the small amount of government saving in its financing comes from the costs borne by the private banks. Their lower profitability will affect their capital and their lending over time. \n\n6) Even though the way government spending is financed (either directly by banks or directly by the RBI) should not alter its inflationary consequences, the larger government spending will directly ignite demand. In abnormal times when demand is depressed and the environment is disinflationary, this should not be a central worry. \n\n7) Similarly, the fact that the RBI will absorb government bonds seamlessly does not alter the fiscal math. If the fiscal deficit and the growth in government debt is deemed unsustainable, investors and rating agencies will take fright. This is where we need to put in place measures that ensure we will go back to fiscal health over the medium term – such as the debt target and the fiscal council suggested by the NK Singh Committee. Modern Monetary Theorists are wrong to think that central bank financing of the government can be ignored. The consolidated liabilities of the government and the central bank have to be seen as sustainable, else confidence in both money and government debt will collapse. \n\n8) Some observers will have an important question. If the main difference in outcomes between direct RBI financing of the government and private financing of the government is the presence of substantial excess reserves, are we not already there? Is the RBI not already absorbing lakhs of crores through reverse repos? The answer is yes, we are. Some obvious questions. Why is the central bank hesitant to finance the government directly? Why does it insist on the fig leaf of the bonds being issued to the market and then the central bank buying through Open Market Operations (as the RBI has been doing in the last few years)?  4 As I have argued above, direct central bank financing in normal times can be inflationary (as can be excess OMOs). Moreover, direct financing of the government obscures market signals for a while when the government spends beyond its means. It is important the government get market feedback. The RBI/government accord allows the RBI to say no to the government, even if it rarely does so. It is best to retain the fig leaf. Is there no limit to RBI financing? Not so long as the banks are willing to passively reinvest excess reserves. However, the more the government issues to the RBI, the more debt the government will have to service, and the less creditworthy the debt. \n\nIf the government’s debt falls in value, RBI’s balance sheet will get eroded. Once again, what is manageable in small quantities becomes problematic in excess. Why can’t the RBI pay the government a large dividend instead? If the RBI’s accountants agreed (they don’t), the RBI could increase the government’s deposit account at the RBI by 1 LC and say it was a dividend. While this would reduce the government’s notional fiscal deficit (it would now not issue bonds to the RBI) everything else would be the same. Ultimately, banks would have excess reserves, which would have to be taken in by the RBI at the reverse repo window. There are two related points: \n\n1) The government’s true deficit would not be lower since it would have commensurately lower equity at the RBI (by the exact amount of the dividend). Essentially, it would be selling the family jewels (instead of borrowing) to pay for its spending. The government’s net debt, which is what rating agencies should worry about, would be the same. \n\n2) The RBI would have fewer assets to sell to absorb the excess reserves when times normalized. This is not a problem if the amount to be sucked out is 1 LC, it does become a problem if it has to reabsorb 10 LC. Knowing this, market participants could become more worried about inflation. Should “monetization” be a constraint on government spending today? No, the government should be concerned about protecting the health of the economy and should spend what is needed. Obviously, it should try and cut back unneeded spending, and prioritize. It should also worry about getting the fiscal deficit and its debt back in shape over the medium term, and the more it spends now, the harder that will be. \n\nHowever, its inability to finance itself or fears of monetization should not be a constraint. Monetization will neither be a game-changer nor a catastrophe, if done in a measured way. In fact, India is already doing it! However, the caveat – it should be measured -- is key.'<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'gfo6fv'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gfo6fv/raghuram_rajan_monetization_neither_game_changer/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Indian Judiciary and the Collegium System - how the Indian judiciary , in an attempt to preserve its independence, went too far'<br />Body: 'While we all lament an unchecked legislature and executive , there is something far more dangerous that exists till now - the Unchecked Judiciary &amp; its Collegium System \n\nTo know the story about the collegium system in India one must know that’s it not backed by any constitutional provision but rather by Precedents set by The Supreme Court in a cases : **Supreme Court Advocates-On-Record Association v Union of India** AKA the Second Judges Case . \n\nTo understand you need to know these things : \n\n1) Under Article 124 , The President has to appoint the judges of  the Supreme Court in consultation with the Chief Justice of India . \n\n2) Under Article 217 &amp; Article 222 respectively, The President has the power to appoint and transfer the judges of an High Court in consultation with the  Chief Justice of the High Court. \n\n3) Article 224 , gives the President the power to appoint additional judges for a period of two years in case any High Court is overburdened with cases \n\nSo to begin with how the collegium system came about , we must look at the history preceding the cases . It was a time of political turmoil in the 1970s when the Congress was attempting to impose executive &amp; legislative supremacy and passed constitutional amendments to override Court judgements and prevent any check by the judiciary on the executive’s actions. The Govt also started favouring the appointment of judges who ruled in their favour .\n\nAnother tool that the Govt used was to appoint additional judges (even though there would be vacancies for permanent positions) in High Courts and leverage their positions through this tool. This went on even during the emergency when as many as 57 judges were transferred. \n\nThough the congress govt was thwarted after the emergency it came back in power. \n\nIn 1981 , Law Minister P.Shivshankar issued a circular to the governor of Punjab and the chief ministers of all states (excluding the north eastern states) requesting them to \n\n1)obtain the consent of additional judges in high courts to be appointed in permanent positions \n\nAnd \n\n2) The consent of judges ,who would be offered judgeship in their high court ,**to be appointed initially in a high court other than their state high court** \n\nThis created an uproar as it was another attempt to bring the judiciary under greater political control. As a result , eight writ petitions were filed and the matter was heard in the case of \n*S.P.Gupta v Union of India* AKA **The First Judges case.**\n\nThe Government argued that the petitioners had no locus standi in the case but the Supreme Court retorted by saying that “the cause of Justice can never be thwarted by procedural technicalities” . \n\nThe First Judges case , while acknowledging the concept of judicial independence , preserved that the President should have the last say in the matter of appointment of judges whereas the the Chief Justice would have no veto rights . \n\nWhile the First Judges Case did not endow any veto power to the judiciary it did question the Government on its opaque procedures for transfer and appointment of Judges and asked for more transparency on the principle of “Right to Know” and also set the ground for the concept of PIL (that locus standi isn’t necessary for matters of public interest). \n\nIn the Late 1980s , while public opinion was mobilised against the Judgement of the First Judges case , the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record filed a petition in the Supreme Court asking for Vacancies in the Supreme Court and various high court positions to be filled . \n\nWhile hearing the petition , the SC acknowledged that the Judgement in the First Judges case needed some reconsideration and directed the matter to a nine-judge bench. \n\nThe Majority decision in this case I.e. the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record v Union of India (AKA The Second Judges Case) ruled that the opinion of the Chief Justice , during the appointment of judges , would prevail in contrast to the First Judges case where the President’s opinion prevailed. \n\nHowever to decentralise the power of the Chief Justice , the Supreme Court said that the Chief Justice must also consult two other senior most judges of the Supreme Court and High court. \n\n**The two judges are now what is called as the collegium of the Supreme Court (or High court as the case may be)** \n\nAnd this birthed the collegium system in India . The judgment while advocating for a consultative, integrative and participative procedure , did the opposite and left an unchecked judiciary. \n\nAs a result , while there are mechanism to keep the other two arms of the government in check , there Remains limited recourse to check the judiciary. The judges , even though can be impeached by the parliament , is a cumbersome process as it requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of the parliament. \n\nThe judgment is till today being criticised as endowing too much power upon on the judiciary.  The criticism comes from judges who ruled on the Judges’ cases and even from judges who have been part of or close to the collegium bodies of courts . The collegium is bashed on the grounds of lacking transparency and favouring nepotism. \n\nMany academics have remarked how the judiciary by its very nature is counter-majoritarian and hence a judiciary that is so opaque poses devastating problems for the functioning of a democracy and the balance of power between the three pillars of a democracy. \n\nThough the Bill for the creation of National Judicial Appointment Committee was passed in 2015 by both houses , it was struck down by the Supreme Court as being unconstitutional\n\n**(Note : This is a summary of an extract from Zia Mody’s “Top ten judgements that changed India”)**'<br />Author: 'promiscuous_bhisma'  id: 'gf41ra'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gf41ra/the_indian_judiciary_and_the_collegium_system_how/</li>
