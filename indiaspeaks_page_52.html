      <li>Title::: 'Analysis: If RS elections for all 233 seats were held today, NDA would fall short of majority by 8 seats. Closer to majority with nominated members.'<br />Body: "There have been a lot of talks about NDAs lack of majority in the upper house which has consequences for passing bills. Many people deem it unfair that even 5 years after sweeping LS elections NDA still doesn't have a majority. Most of them falsely believe that NDA should have a comfortable majority. However, the truth is something else.\n\nIf all RS seats were made vacant and elections were held today then the coalition wise position will be as following:\n\nNDA- 109    \nUPA- 68    \nOthers- 56    \n\nThe required majority for elected seats would be 117 seats and NDA falls 8 seats shorter. It doesn't look all that good for the government but luckily for them up to 12 members can be nominated to RS. Currently 8 of the 12 are BJP members. That brings NDAs strength to 117 when needed majority would be 123. Government will get to appoint other four RS members too and that will see them agonizingly close to majority at 121 seats. They will still fall short of majority by 2 seats. You can find the state wise details in [this table](https://i.imgur.com/pUcETRm.png).\n\nA caveat: The numbers might be off by a seat or two because not all the RS seats can be allocated in a straightforward manner. Sometimes the last seat is contested between different groups and whoever can form alliance with independents has a better chance. It is likely that others might get fewer seats because they are not united and may chose to align with UPA and NDA for RS election. That can effect election for the last seat in a few states.\n\nPlease let me know if you find any problem with the numbers and they don't add up to you.\n\nThis should put to rest any arguments that the RS is lagging a lot behind public opinion. They are lagging but the gap is not that huge. However, if you looked at assembly segments in 2014 LS elections a completely different picture emerges and that, most likely, is the reason for belief that NDA should have a romping majority.\n\n[This table](https://i.imgur.com/JgQjbLw.png) has the results but based on 2014 LS election assembly segment wise lead. As you can see NDA has a clear majority. Seats will be as follows:\n\nNDA- 131    \nUPA- 33\nOthers- 69    \n\nSince BJP had a bigger victory in 2019 compared to 2014 these numbers are only likely to get better.\n\nThe bottomline is that RS is doing exactly what it was supposed to do. It is the voice of states and even though people overwhelmingly want Modi at center they do not have the same feelings for their states. Remember that all the states have gone to polls since 2014 LS elections so it can't be explained away. This is the will of the people.\n\nI may repost this tomorrow if doesn't get enough traction as it is wrong time of the night for such a post. Forgive me if I do.

      <li>Title::: 'So I watched NDTV interviewing Kanimozhi yesterday.'<br />Body: " \n\nKanimozhi (DMK) won Tuticorin constituency contesting against Tamilisai Soundarrajan (BJP). Here is the first one minute of the interview (I am only paraphrasing), [Full Interview Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wE_CfK5ImE&amp;t=155s)\n\nNDTV Anchor: Congratulations Kanimozhi on your victory! Why do you think NDA failed in TN but they won everywhere else?\n\nKanimozhi: TN has been affected a lot because of the BJP government. Neet Exam, for example, formers agitating, and hydrocarbon &amp; methane project brought to TN by BJP. farmer crop insurance did not come to TN. We have been affected very badly by GST &amp; by demonetization. Unemployment is rampant &amp; we believe in a secular government and that is what Dravidian movement meant.\n\nso let me break down Kanimozhi's answer which is full of misrepresentation and lies.\n\n1. No state in India protests against NEET except TN. NEET scheme came into existence and implemented during congress government (2013) all over India. BJP has nothing to with it. [NEET Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Eligibility_cum_Entrance_Test)\n\n*Note: DMK is in UPA alliance and the only party openly supported Rahul Gandhi for PM.*\n\n2. Formers agitating - Ayyakannu, the person who led these protests later told media that he was asked to protest  \nby DMK. He later asked everyone to vote BJP. [Ayyakannu Link](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/ayyakannu-drops-plan-to-contest-against-modi-in-varanasi-tiruchi/article26772369.ece)\n\n3. Hydrocarbon and Methane - both projects came to TN during congress government and Kanimozhi's brother  \nMK Stalin is the one who signed the deal while he was deputy chief minister of TN. [Stalin Signing MoU](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/MoU-signed-for-production-of-Coal-Bed-Methane/article15506221.ece)\n\n4. Farmers insurance did not come - Not sure what she means here. The agricultural insurance scheme is national  \nlevel, I couldn't find anyone complaining that it did not come to only TN. I don't have any source to  \nprove/disprove the claim.\n\n5. GST and Demonetization - No state in India seem to complain GST (even the ones BJP lost) because and I don't  \nknow why Kanimozhi is bringing that as a main point. I can definitely give some points for showing  \ndemonetization as a reason.\n\n6. Unemployment - I agree 45 years high\n\n7. We believe in Secular and that is what Dravidian movement is about - I am not sure if DMK is more secular than  \nBJP because DMK goons openly insult Hindu gods/deities with shameful vulgar words but go celebrate  \nChristmas and Ramzan at churches and mosques.

This logic doesn't apply to Islam and Christianity because of*  \n*vote bank.*\n\nI am done here! So many lies and misrepresentation in less than 1 min of the interview.

      <li>Title::: "Zombie State Owned Enterprises, Vampiric Corporations, and a Fossil Fuel That Refuses to Die: Why India's Reliance on Coal is Bad For India and the World"<br />Body: ' Coal in the United States is a dying industry. Coal mines in West Virginia and Wyoming have long been [closing](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/west-virginia/articles/2018-10-13/large-west-virginia-coal-mine-with-400-workers-closing) their doors, and total coal consumption in 2018 is close to half of what it [was ](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37692)a decade ago. It is likely the coal power plants will struggle to survive without [subsidies](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/06/06/donald-trump-hopes-to-save-americas-failing-coal-fired-power-plants). However, it would be a mistake to assume that coal is a dying industry. Many large countries, including India, Indonesia, and China are rapidly increasing their use of coal. In today\'s podcast episode, I will be exploring India\'s coal industry, focusing on the struggles of Coal India, the public sector enterprise that dominates coal mining, to dig up enough coal to meet India\'s demand, the inability of coal and other extractive industries to bring development to the regions where they are most active, and the implications of India\'s increasing use of coal on the global environment.\n\nCoal India Limited, a state controlled mining company that [controls ](https://www.coalindia.in/DesktopModules/DocumentList/documents/Annual_Report_&amp;_Accounts_2014-15_Deluxe_version_In_English_03102015.pdf)82% of the coal market, has dominated coal mining in India since its creation in 1971. Coal India has struggled to meet the demands of India\'s rapidly growing economy because it is expected to provide coal to power plants at costs well below global market levels. Coal India was forced to sell coal at prices 70% below market [averages](https://www.ft.com/content/9233696a-8323-11e1-9f9a-00144feab49a), reducing Coal India profits by half. Similarly, Coal India has long [subsidized ](https://www.brookings.edu/research/indian-railways-and-coal/)passengers on Indian Railways by paying above market rates to transport coal. Coal India is legally obligated to hire all of those its mines displace, and strong unions command wages that consume [half ](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/coal-india-high-wage-bills-cast-a-shadow-on-coal-majors-numbers/articleshow/13617713.cms?from=mdr)it revenues. Moreover, corruption and mismanagement at the highest level have resulted in windfall gains to connected companies of [$33 billion](https://saiindia.gov.in/english/home/our_products/audit_report/government_wise/union_audit/recent_reports/union_performance/2012_2013/Commercial/Report_No_7/Report_No_7.html) . A violent and powerful coal mafia has [emerged ](https://in.reuters.com/article/india-coal-jharkhand-dhanbad-coalindia/special-report-coal-mafia-stokes-indias-power-crisis-idINDEE94D00B20130514)that skims money off of each stage of coal production and distribution, with "Goon taxes" rising as [high ](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajes.12208)as 10%. The combination of these factors means that Coal India does not have nearly enough money to invest in mechanization and new technologies. Labor productivity of Indian miners is only 4% of that of those in the US, and only 1 in 10 mines are [mechanized](https://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/what-s-keeping-india-dark). The result are severe shortages in coal that act as a serious break on rapid [development](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/indian-govt-grapples-to-find-causes-of-coal-shortages-2018-11-26).\n\nA problem just as severe as Coal India\'s inability to produce enough coal for the Indian economy, is the fact that coal and other extractive industries have failed to bring prosperity and development to the regions in which they are concentrated. A vastly disproportionate share of India\'s coal reserves are located in the states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. These states are the home of around 8% of India\'s population, but [over ](http://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Energy%20Statistics%202019-finall.pdf)two thirds of India\'s coal reserves. India\'s iron ore, bauxite, and copper reserves are all disproportionately located in these [states](http://www.jsmdc.in/web/AvailabilityofMineralsinJharkhand.php). However, these three states are also among the poorest in India, with rates of GDP per capita, and human development metrics such as infant mortality substantially worse than the [national average](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/AnnualPublications.aspx?head=Handbook+of+Statistics+on+Indian+States&amp;fromdate=03%2F02%2F2019&amp;todate=03%2F04%2F2019). Moreover, despite wealth of natural resources, these states have seen substantially lower rates of growth than the national average. These disparities are especially striking that many mines are located in adivasi or indegenous lands. The adivasi populations of the region are consistently at the bottom of these impoverished societies, and see few of the benefits of mining. It has been estimated that mining led development has displaced [lakhs ](http://indr.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/B.-Terminski-Mining-Induced-Displacement-and-Resettlement.pdf)of people. In theory, Coal India is obligated to provide employment to these displaced people, but has only managed to provide jobs for a small [minority](https://books.google.com/books?id=BxDKhOnWwOsC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=tribe++employment+%22coal+india%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mKvZZWjGxn&amp;sig=ACfU3U2jNdOszeIC3kEvO_E3Ft7pU3xKtA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwii5fKs-YPiAhUDMawKHcwOC-Y4ChDoATAAegQICRAB#v=onepage&amp;q=tribe%20%20employment%20%22coal%20india%22&amp;f=false), while pollution has impacted the livelihoods of many who .

While Naxilte rebellion has lost power over the last 8 years, the underlying roots of the conflict have not been addressed.\n\nIndia\'s coal industry has consequences that extend well outside of India. India is forced to rely upon coal imports as Coal India has failed to met [demand](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/adani-expects-india-coal-imports-to-hit-record-1557467616076.html) in India. India imported $25 billion of coal in [2018](https://www.trademap.org/Country_SelProduct_TS.aspx?nvpm=1%7c%7c%7c%7c%7c2701%7c%7c%7c4%7c1%7c1%7c1%7c2%7c1%7c2%7c1%7c1), and is projected to become the largest imported of coal in the world in 2019.helping keep mines in West Virginia and Australia open. More important is the Indian coal industry on global climate change. While India is still taking [part ](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2017/jun/01/donald-trump-paris-climate-agreement-live-news)in the Paris Accords, it has made promises of only modest cuts because coal is so central to its development strategy. To be clear, India is investing massively in solar and wind power. Total installed capacity of wind power has more than [quadrupled ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_by_country)over the last decade in India, and 5.4% of India\'s electricity comes from solar power, a proportion more than [double ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_by_country)that of the United States. Nevertheless, coal is likely to be king for the foreseeable future. Millions of Indians are [buying ](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-mobility-in-indias-passenger-vehicle-market)their first cars every year, while India produces vast quantities of carbon [intensive ](https://www.devalt.org/newsletter/jan97/of_1.htm)products such as cement and steel. Most importantly, coal consumption is rising rapidly in India. The International Energy Agency projects coal use in India will [increase ](https://www.carbonbrief.org/iea-china-and-india-to-fuel-further-rise-in-global-coal-demand-in-2018)from 563 to 708 million metric tons, with total coal consumption increasing by more than 3% a year. Over the last decade India has grown only more dependent on coal, as the percent of electricity generated from coal increased [from ](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.COAL.ZS?locations=IN)66% to 75% between 2007 and 2015. India [emitted ](https://www.axios.com/china-india-us-pushed-carbon-emissions-to-record-levels-in-2018-1b1e171a-d46a-49b7-bc4a-7250942a1a7d.html)2.6 billion of the worlds total 15.3 billion . While per capita carbon emissions are well below the global average, carbon emissions are increasing at a rate over 6% a year. Reconciling India\'s need for development and environmental concerns will be vital for fighting global warming.\n\nIndia\'s coal industry is highly inefficient, a poor engine for raising standards of living, and dangerous to the planet. Nevertheless, the coal industry remains vital to the future of India\'s economy. Coal fueled the industrial revolution in 18th century England, the rise of America in the 19th century, and the spectacular growth of China in the 20th. Coal is likely to similarly, for better of for worse, likely to play the same role in the development of the Indian economy in the 21st century.\n\nSelected Sources:  \n[Coal in India Adjusting to Transition](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Tongia_and_Gross_2019_Coal_In_India_Adjusting_To_Transition.pdf) , Rahul Tongia, Samantha Gross  \n[The Coal Mine Mafia of India: A Mirror of Corporate Power](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajes.12208), Yugank Goyal  \nPoverty by Social, Religious &amp; Economic Groups in India and Its Largest States 1993-94 to 2011-12 , Arvind Panagiriya  \n[Targets of violence: evidence from India’s Naxalite conflict](https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01202689/document) , Oliver Vanden Eyden  \n[Carbon dioxide emissions from coal based power generation in India](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/44016368/Carbon_dioxide_emissions_from_coal_based20160322-12205-1ad56yc.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1557731198&amp;Signature=Q1AsvfQ0OaJnBpYDRsFAbauVQDY%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DCarbon_dioxide_emissions_from_coal_based.pdf) , Shiv Pratap Raghuvanshi \\*, Avinash Chandra, Ashok Kumar Raghav'<br />Author: 'gnikivar2'  id: 'bubptd'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bubptd/zombie_state_owned_enterprises_vampiric/</li>

One such candidate was Ponn Radhakrishnan. He is from Kanyakumari district, dedicated his entire life to the welfare of the party. Last year he had built a bridge for the people of Kanyakumari that was deemed impossible and made travel easier, they need not go through the city\'s traffic and get out of the city without much hassle.

      <li>Title::: 'IF INDIAN POLITICS WAS A VIDEO GAME: How can the BJP win the muslim vote? How to attack "MUSALMAAN KHATRE MEIN HAI"? COMPLETING LEVEL 2 - ideas welcome!'<br />Body: 'If Indian politics was a video game, LEVEL 1 required the BJP to defeat the maha-chuck-bandhan and small jativaad, pichwaade gareeb politicians. Small, regional fishes**. In other words, LEVEL 1 was the "easy" level.** The BJP has completed LEVEL 1 by slowly erasing casteism with a unified hindu identity. Congratulations. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, the BJP has ENTERED **LEVEL 2 - the "medium" level.** At **LEVEL 2**, the task is to win the votes of a majority of India\'s muslims. \n\nHere\'s where they currently stand:\n\nThe BJP doubled its vote share within the muslim community to 14%, reaching double digits (!!!) for the first time. \n\nInternationally, Modi has earned the praise of several islamic figureheads, sheikh zayed in UAE - even if he may be a western puppet - recognized him with the country\'s highest civilian award. \n\nWithin India, the leader of the Jamiat, mahmood madani, gave him his congratulations and like many muslim community leaders - seems open to dialogue: [https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/jamiat-leader-congratulates-modi-on-lok-sabha-win-says-high-hopes-from-government/story-XNwFc84L0IhIkIV1uKtdEJ.html](https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/jamiat-leader-congratulates-modi-on-lok-sabha-win-says-high-hopes-from-government/story-XNwFc84L0IhIkIV1uKtdEJ.html) The All India Muslim personal LAW board also voiced its approval. These are big names and big institutions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**This means that the BJP has comfortably walked through the EARLY phase of LEVEL 2.** \n\nBut Finishing LEVEL 2, is significantly more difficult. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are the enemies you have to defeat:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **The domestic MUSALMAAN KHATRE MEIN HAI!!! industry.** The meme MUSALMAAN KHATRE MEIN HAI!! is an entire industry, an entire eco-system in and of itself. It is well patronized and heavily funded. This industry EXISTS to keep India and the subcontinent\'s muslims in a perpetual state of fear, depression and poverty. \n* **How they will fight**: this industry will try to convince muslims that ANY government initiatives helping them are a failure. Every bit of "good" that is done to uplift the muslims - the poorest, most backward, most exploited community in india - will be undermined by a coordinated stream of anti-hindu and anti-government propaganda. Muslims showing public support for the BJP will be defamed, denounced and possibly even killed. **To reach the next - or MIDDLE - phase  of LEVEL 2, You have to repeatedly counter this propaganda, and protect the legitimacy, authority and social standing of pro-BJP muslims.** \n* For some people in india, screaming MUSALMAAN KHATRE MEIN HAI!! is not just politics, but a matter of SURVIVAL. They NEED muslims to be victims, because once the muslims stop seeing them as "saviours", they are finished. Domestically, many Indian political parties and their mediapersons LIVE off the muslim victimhood. **To complete the MIDDLE phase of LEVEL 2, you have to create at least THREE successful muslim figureheads that can speak in favor of the BJP\'s muslim outreach. You must also silence or marginalize voices of discord, dissent and unrest.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Once you have accomplished that, and successfully killed most of the DOMESTIC enemies, you move into the LAST phase of LEVEL 2.** In this phase, you have to defeat the big boys, the FOREIGNERS, on the INTERNATIONAL stage. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The international MUSALMAAN KHATRE MEIN HAI!!! industry. The same eco-system as the domestic one defined above, but SAVVIER, better funded and organized. We\'re talking about seasoned western politicians, academics, corporate campaigns. World class debaters. \n* **How they will fight**: Internationally, both the westerners and the arabs are fighting to influence muslims into opposing the new, anti-NATO world order led by China and Russia. This is the reason why Saudi arabia, an American puppet, was made head of the United Nations human rights council. Saudi is the western-approved leader of the islamic world - and they\'ll use their heavily funded platform to sway the worldwide muslim opinion in favor of western interests. **You have to make peace with Saudi Arabia**. **If this means opposing Iran on the international stage, then so be it. You must continue the fight against "terrorism" and the Pakistan army, while sympathizing with the "aam aadmi" of Pakistan.** \n* Western countries and their media will spend the next 5 years screaming MUSALMAAN KHATRE MEIN HAI because they don\'t want a strong, majoritarian government in India. They will use their money on the ground. **To reach the end of LEVEL 2, you have to put an end to all western sources of funding for mosques, NGOs and educational institutions and create an opposing, Indian-led eco-system that speaks directly to the Indian muslims and puts money in their pockets.** This means, RSS sponsored madarsas, more government jobs, and more direct benefits from Indian corporations (employment, loans, scholarships). **To finish LEVEL 2, you have to BUY their trust, while promoting your muslim figureheads.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will outline and discuss LEVEL 3 when the BJP gets there. \n\n**But completing LEVEL 2 is a 5 year project**. At least 5 years. The BJP is fighting to reverse DECADES of social engineering and a hostile neighboring army that defines it\'s existence on the undermining of Muslims in a hindu rashtra. \n\nThe BJP is also fighting against ITS OWN party - specifically, the extremist fringe. How will THEY react to initiatives seen as "appeasement" of muslims? The extemist fringe - heroes, and politically expedient - have to be KEPT HAPPY. They need to be used intelligently - at the right moments, in the right situations, - and should always serve the BJP\'s interests. Ghar wapasi efforts and a reinforcing of the greater dharmic identity will off-set any aggression against NECESSARY "appeasement".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: the domestic MUSALMAAN KHATRE MEIN HAI!! industry will probably try to give a extremist fringe a bigger platform. They know they can\'t win the war of ideas, but they can try to embarrass the BJP by using its own forces against them. The extremist fringe should be careful, and work closely with the BJP. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlways remember. \n\nThere can\'t be an akhand bharat without winning over muslims. If India\'s sense of civilizational nationhood can\'t accommodate its own muslim population, it will be impossible to re-integrate pakistan and bangladesh into the Indian republic. Those are YOUR people, whether you like them or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter finishing LEVEL 1, good luck in LEVEL 2. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is your advice for the BJP? how can they complete LEVEL 2?'<br />Author: 'twatavious'  id: 'bu6qo7'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bu6qo7/if_indian_politics_was_a_video_game_how_can_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Buddhist map below shows just why it is not an alternative to Hinduism in India'<br />Body: "Some liberals like Pankaj Mishra (perhaps a decendent of Mandana Mishra? Who lost in a debate to Adi Shankara?) wrote books and articles on Buddhist principles and how it solves a lot of problems brought by the Vedic religion. And then there are Dalit leaders like Mayawati who actively tell members of her caste to become a Buddhist. \n\nThere's no doubt that religions like Jainism and Buddhism are a lot less violent in nature compared to Sanathana Dharma, **but that's also their major weakness**. Just look at the map below.\n\nBefore the arrival of Islam to Central and South Asia, the region from Turkmenistan all the way to Pakistan used to be a Buddhist stronghold. It was the state religion of the Kushan Empire in the 1st century AD and Bamyan was like a Buddhist Mecca. Even the Pakistani region was overwhelmingly Buddhist instead of Hindu, that's why Adi Shankara didn't travel there in his journey throughout the Subcontinent. \n\nFlash forward a millenia and there's hardly ANY Buddhist site or practitioners in the entire region. They're not even 1% of the population in each 'Stan' country. And look at what happened to the Buddhas of Bamyan, they were bombed out of existence. **I am convinced if India isn't Hindu, that would also be the fate of this civilization.** And that is why it is important to uphold and protect the ancestral traditions of the Indian civilization. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/qk4mbr4vmy031.png"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'bu0sie'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bu0sie/the_buddhist_map_below_shows_just_why_it_is_not/</li>
      <li>Title::: "How Scindia's Former Aide Beat Him In His Own Backyard, Bonus: Entitlement Check"<br />Body: 'From: [Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/elections/jyotiraditya-scindias-wife-seeks-votes-for-maharaj-bjp-bets-on-local-face-modis-name-5715887/)\n\nRepresented by Jyotiraditya Scindia since 2002, Guna was one of the two seats in Madhya Pradesh that the Congress retained in the 2014 general elections, though with a much reduced margin.\n\nTaking on the former Union minister this time is the [BJP](https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/)’s K P Yadav, who lost in the recent state elections from Mungaoli, one of the eight Assembly segments that make up the Guna-Shivpuri parliamentary constituency. Before Jyotiraditya, the Guna seat, which goes to polls on May 12, was represented by his father Madhav Rao Scindia and grandmother Vijaya Raje Scindia.\n\n**Lok Sabha Elections 2019 |**\xa0[**Polling schedule, results date, constituency-wise results, how to check live counting**](https://indianexpress.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections-2019-results-date-constituency-wise-results-polling-schedule-how-to-check-live-counting/)\n\n***Yadav, 43, was Jyotiraditya’s aide till January 2018, but fell out with the Congress after he was denied a ticket in the Assembly bypoll for Mungaoli, and joined the BJP. In last year’s Assembly elections, the BJP fielded him from the same constituency but he lost by a narrow margin of around 2,000 votes.***\n\nAfter a long time, the BJP has fielded a local candidate from the seat, with most of Scindia’s previous challengers living outside the Guna. In 2014, Scindia defeated former Bajrang Dal chief Jaibhan Singh Pavaiyya, a resident of Gwalior, and in 2009 Narottam Mishra, a resident of Datia. Yadav is a resident of Rusalla village in Ashoknagar district in Guna.\n\n“The previous candidates were not local but they were MLAs elsewhere. They were eyeing minister’s post in the state government and so did not contest the general election seriously. A win would have taken them away to Delhi,’’ says BJP leader Gajendra Sikarwar, explaining why the party lost Guna despite a [Narendra Modi](https://indianexpress.com/about/narendra-modi) wave. But, he says, “Everybody is putting in their best now.’’\n\nWith Scindia being appointed the Congress’s general secretary in charge for western UP, the campaigning in Guna has been largely left to his wife Priyadarshini Raje. When the BJP announced Yadav’s candidature, she took a dig at him saying, ***“Those who were taking selfies with Maharaj till recently are now going to challenge him.” Raje has been campaigning in the constituency’s remote areas, occasionally even having lunch in fields.***\n\n“Maharaj toils to provide you amenities and spends most of his time working for you. Did anyone of you go to Mandsaur? He went to Mandsaur (where during the farmers’ stir five protesters died in firing and one in police custody in June 2017),’’ she tells villagers. In some pockets, she also complains about some voters not backing the ‘Maharaj’ in the last polls.\n\nHer style is similar to her 48-year-old husband’s, who in his interactions with traders, doctors and lawyers earlier was seen publicly complaining about their lack of support to the Congress with thumbs down gestures.\n\nIn his campaign speeches, Scindia rarely targets his BJP rival, taking on PM Narendra Modi and former chief minister [Shivraj Singh Chouhan](https://https//indianexpress.com/article/research/shivraj-singh-chouhan-profile-5487054/). Scindia has been campaigning in the constituency even before his name was officially announced, and the party believes he will sweep the polls this time as well.\n\nThe BJP, however, is trying to put up a fight. Chouhan, who campaigned near Kolaras on Monday, said, “The Maharaja has been given responsibility of western UP but he has not been able to leave Guna,” adding, “Not just him, his entire family is campaigning for him. Had he worked for five years he would have been spared the trouble of seeking votes in every lane and bylane,’’ he said.\n\nBJP candidate Yadav too asserted that Scindia is in “trouble”. “He is hatching conspiracies to defeat me. Why else would so many ministers camp in the constituency for several weeks,” he said.\n\nBut recent developments seem to be in the Congress’s favour. Recently, K L Agrawal, who was a minister in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government, openly backed Scindia. After being denied a ticket in last year’s Assembly elections, Agrawal contested as an Independent from Bamori seat and got more than 27,000 votes. Also, the BSP candidate from Guna, Lokendra Singh Rajput, joined the Congress declaring support for Scindia. BSP chief [Mayawati](https://indianexpress.com/about/mayawati) accused the Congress government of misusing official machinery to force Rajput to defect.\n\nBut the BJP believes that even though Yadav’s name was announced late, the party’s campaign in the Prime Minister’s name since February will ensure a win. “Candidate is not important, the lotus (party symbol) and Modi are,’’ is what local leaders are believed to have told cadres. However, going by the sparse crowd at Union Home Minister [Rajnath Singh](https://indianexpress.com/about/rajnath-singh)’s recent rally for Yadav, that did not help.\n\nSo far, no senior Congress leader other than Scindia himself has addressed a rally in the constituency. Raj Babbar is expected to visit the constituency.\n\nTitle edited by u/JainMutton.

Gandhi himself lost from the family bastion of\xa0Amethi in Uttar Pradesh, though he won from Wayanad in Kerala.\n\nStating that Priyanka lost her cool more than once during the four-hour long CWC deliberations, a party leader present there said the AICC General Secretary in charge of Eastern Uttar Pradesh said, “All those responsible for the party’s defeat are sitting in this room”.\n\nWhen some party leaders were trying to convince Rahul Gandhi to take back his resignation, which he had offered taking moral responsibility for the Congress debacle, Priyanka is learned to have intervened saying, “Where were you when my brother was fighting all by himself and alone?”\n\nPriyanka sat through the meeting, looking visibly anguished, and interjected twice at least, while saying on one occasion, “No one supported Congress President in taking forward the narrative of Rafale and ‘chowkidar chor hai’.”\n\nRahul Gandhi, who left the meeting abruptly and was adamant there on not continuing as the Congress president, also ticked off three senior party leaders — former union minister P\xa0Chidambaram, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath and Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot — saying they placed their sons before party interests.\n\nChidambaram’s son Karti and Nath’s son Nakul managed to win the Lok Sabha elections from their respective seats, but Gehlot’s son Vaibhav lost.\n\nCWC sources said that when former Guna MP Jyotiraditya Scindia urged Gandhi to strengthen the states’ leadership of the party, the party president quipped looking at Chidambaram, saying that “Mr Chidambaram threatened to resign if a ticket was denied to his son.”\n\nAbout Kamal Nath who was absent from the CWC meeting, Gandhi said, “Mr Nath said how could he be CM if his son was not fielded.”\n\nTaunting Gehlot the Congress Chief said the Rajasthan CM spent seven days campaigning for his son in Jodhpur neglecting the rest of the state.\n\nGandhi is learned to have voiced his disappointment at the state of affairs in the party when he said to the CWC why can’t anyone else be Congress Chief.\n\nSources said Priyanka also urged her brother not to resign saying it would be like “falling into BJP’s trap”.\n\nRahul Gandhi also expressed his displeasure at not being supported in the Rafale campaign and is said to have asked the party leaders present in the meeting how many of them backed him in building the corruption narrative against Prime Minister Modi.\n\nWhen some leaders raised their hands to say that they spoke about Rafale, Gandhi is said to have dismissed them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Title edited by* u/JainMutton \n\nOriginal Title: Where Were You When My Brother Was Fighting Modi Alone: When Priyanka Gandhi Fired at CWC Meet'<br />Author: 'JainMutton'  id: 'bu0gw5'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bu0gw5/priyanka_gandhi_loses_it_in_congress_cwc_meet/</li>

अभी भी जमी हुई है. ये घास केवल सुशासन से ही हटाई जा सकती हैं. \n\n2014 में नरेंद्र मोदी ने चुनाव लड़ने के लिए विकास और भ्रष्टाचार को मुद्दा बनाया था और गुजरात मॉडल को सामने रखा था. मतदाताओं ने इसपर भरोसा भी किया और भाजपा ने अपने बलबूते स्पष्ट बहुमत के साथ सरकार बनाई थी. मुझे बेहद खुशी हुई थी जब मोदी जी ने अपने एक चुनावी भाषण में तब ‘डेमोग्राफिक डिविडेंड’ की चर्चा की थी. इसका अर्थ यह है कि भारत के पास एक सुअवसर है जो उसकी जनसँख्या के युवा प्रतिशत से उभर आया है. भारत की जनसंख्या में सर्वाधिक प्रतिशत युवाओं का है तो उत्पादक आयु वर्ग की संख्या सर्वाधिक हुई और निर्भर आयु वर्ग कम हुआ. यह स्थिति हमेशा नहीं रहने वाली. यदि इस युवा जनसँख्या को प्रभावी मानव संसाधन में बदल दिया जाय तो भारत विश्व के अग्रणी देशों में तुरत ही आ सकता है. नरेंद्र मोदी के प्रधानमंत्री बनने के साथ ही यह आशा बलवती हुई कि अब नयी सरकार मानव संसाधन निर्मित करने के दो बड़े घटकों यथा-शिक्षा (कौशल) व स्वास्थ्य पर सर्वाधिक ध्यान देगी. 2014 से 2019 तक यदि आंकडें देखें तो मोदी सरकार ने शिक्षा मद में लगातार बजट अलोकेशन कम किया है. यह 6.15 % से घटकर 3.48 % प्रतिशत रह गयी. प्राथमिक शिक्षा और उच्च शिक्षा में कोई नया विजन नदारद रहा. नियुक्तियां ठिठकी ही रहीं. \n\n[ आइए सत्ता पक्ष की चुनावी सफलता को प्रशासन \\(सुशासन\\) की कसौटी से भी देखें ](https://i.redd.it/53mr9kpiep031.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**आयुष्मान भारत नाम से एक महत्वाकांक्षी योजना :** \n\nस्वास्थ्य सेवा में मनमोहन और मोदी दोनों ही सरकारों का काम उल्लेखनीय नहीं है. स्वास्थ्य मद में दोनों के खर्च लगातार सिकुड़े हैं. मोदी सरकार ने 2025 तक स्वास्थ्य मद में जीडीपी का महज 2.5% खर्च करने का लक्ष्य रखा है. मोदी सरकार ने अपने कार्यकाल के आखिरी महीनों में (सितम्बर 2018) आयुष्मान भारत नाम से एक महत्वाकांक्षी योजना जरुर शुरू की लेकिन पुरे भारत में महज 18000 प्राइवेट अस्पतालों को ही इसमें जोड़ा जा सका. ऐसी कोई भी योजना तब तक नहीं सफल हो सकती जबतक एक जमीनी सार्वजनिक स्वास्थ्य संरक्षा व्यवस्था न निर्मित की जाये. जन औषधि केंद्र व स्टेंट व घुटना प्रत्यारोपण सामग्रियों को सस्ता कर एक राहत देने की कोशिश अवश्य की गयी. यदि स्वास्थ्य व शिक्षा पर ध्यान न दिया जाये तो भारत अपने डेमोग्राफिक डिविडेंड का लाभ नहीं ले सकेगा और यही युवा जनसँख्या कुछ समय बाद इसी अर्थव्यवस्था पर उचित शिक्षा व स्वास्थ्य के अभाव में उलटे एक बोझ बनेगी, इसप्रकार एक ऐतिहासिक अवसर जाता रहेगा. इसे वैश्विक स्तर भी महसूस किया गया जब अक्टूबर, 2018 में विश्व बैंक द्वारा पहली बार जारी किये ह्यूमन कैपिटल इंडेक्स में भारत का स्थान पाकिस्तान, नेपाल, श्रीलंका, बांग्लादेश आदि के साथ 115वें स्थान पर रहा. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**भारत अपनी प्रकृति में सेकुलर है :**\n\nपुरे कार्यकाल में इतिहास का जिक्र बार-बार किया गया. भारत का जब विभाजन हुआ तो वह एक लोकतान्त्रिक देश नहीं था और न ही विभाजन के प्रश्न पर कोई रेफेरेंडम ही हुआ था. विभाजन के बाद जो संविधान आया उसमें देश की एक ऐसी पहचान को अपनाया गया जिसमें भाषा, जाति और धर्म के आधार पर कोई विभेद नहीं किया गया. 1951 में पाकिस्तान की जनगणना के मुताबिक वहाँ हिन्दू आबादी 1.3 % थी और हालिया जनगणना (2001) में यह बेहद मामूली बढ़त (0.3%) के साथ 1.6 % हो गयी. इधर भारत में 1951 की जनगणना के अनुसार मुस्लिम आबादी 9.8% थी, जो 2001 में बढ़कर 14.2 % हो गयी. भारत और पाकिस्तान के राजनीतिक प्रकृति का अंतर सुस्पष्ट है और जिसपर हमें गर्व भी है. भारत अपनी प्रकृति में सेकुलर है यह आंकड़े भी पुष्ट करते हैं. लेकिन इन आंकड़ों को तोड़मरोड़ कर एक धार्मिक असुरक्षा का माहौल बनाया गया और सांप्रदायिक तुष्टीकरण का लाभ सभी दलों ने लेने की कोशिश की. एक जिम्मेदार सरकार को इस स्थिति को रोकने का इंतजाम करना था. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **तेल के दामों को बाजार के नियंत्रण में छोड़ दिया**  **:**\n\n मोदी सरकार के पूर्व अर्थशास्त्री प्रधानमंत्री मनमोहन की लगातार दो कार्यकाल की सरकार थी. मनमोहन सरकार के मंत्रियों में एक दंभ दिखने लगा था और अक्सर उनकी आलोचना उस समय ऑक्सब्रिज कुनबा कहकर की जाती थी. मोदी सरकार के अर्थवयवस्था का जायजा यदि लिया जाय तो यह कहना होगा कि मोदी सरकार ने फिस्कल घाटे को कम किया, ऋण को नियंत्रित किया, इन्फ्लेशन पर लगाम लगाई. लेकिन इसमें दो तथ्य बेहद महत्वपूर्ण भी जोड़े जाने चाहिए जिससे पुरी बात स्पष्ट हो. इसी समय में अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय बाजार में तेल के दाम बेहद निचले स्तर पर थे और लगातार अच्छे मानसून से फसल उत्पादन भी बढ़िया हुआ. 30 डॉलर प्रति बैरल पर कीमत आने के बाद भी सरकार ने देश में तेल की कीमतें घटाईं नहीं, बल्कि तेल के दामों को बाजार के नियंत्रण में छोड़ दिया गया. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **जीडीपी ग्रोथ**  **:**\n\nग्रोथ रेट के आंकड़े मोदी सरकार में कार्यकाल के दुसरे वित्तीय वर्ष से ही 2011-12 को आधार वर्ष मानकर (पहले आधार वर्ष 2004-05 था) दिखाया जा रहा था. लेकिन तीन स्तर पर बदलाव किये गए और उन आधारों पर मनमोहन सिंह के कार्यकाल और मोदी कार्यकाल के आंकड़ों की तुलना प्रदर्शित की गयी, इसमें मोदी सरकार के लिए ग्रोथ रेट जहाँ 7.5 % दिखाया गया वहीं, मनमोहन के लिए यह 6.7 % ही रहा. इस नए तरीके से मनमोहन काल में अर्जित डबल डिजिट ग्रोथ को भी सिंगल डिजिट (10.3% से 8.5 %) का बना दिया गया. इन आंकड़ों को यूँ दिखाने के लिए तीन बदलाव किये गए- पहला आधार वर्ष बदला गया, डेटा के स्रोत आधारों को बदला गया और तीसरा जीडीपी गणना की पद्धति बदली गयी जिसमें अर्थव्यवस्था के प्राथमिक सेक्टर और द्वितीयक सेक्टर के आंकड़ो को अधिक वरीयता दी गयी और तृतीयक सेक्टर के आंकड़ों को कम महत्त्व दिया गया (जबकि तृतीयक सेक्टर यानि सेवा क्षेत्र का योग सर्वाधिक 54% है जबकि पहला और दूसरा सेक्टर क्रमशः 17% व 29% ही योग देते हैं). मनमोहन सिंह के एक बयान के मुताबिक UPA की ग्रोथ रेट तक पहुंचने के लिए सरकार को 10.6 % की रेट को बनाना होगा, जाहिर है जो संभव नहीं हो सका. 1% वार्षिक भी यदि जीडीपी ग्रोथ में कमी आती है तो यह तकरीबन 1.5 लाख करोड़ रूपये का नुकसान राष्ट्र को पहुँचाता है, इससे होने वाले मानवीय असर की कल्पना की जा सकती है. पिछले पांच सालों में अप्रत्यक्ष कर की संख्या बढ़ी है जबकि सब जानते हैं कि एक बेहतरीन अर्थव्यवस्था में प्रत्यक्ष कर अधिक होते हैं और अप्रत्यक्ष कर कम रखे जाते हैं. मनरेगा में लगातार फंड घटाए गए. ग्यारह करोड़ से अधिक सीनियर सिटिजन के लिए कोई खास इंतजाम नहीं किया गया. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **500 और 1000 के नोट्स** **:**\n\nएक बड़ी उपलब्धि जीएसटी का लागु करवाना जरुर रहा पर यहां भी यह नोट करने वाली बात है कि यह आइडिया UPA सरकार का रहा और विपक्ष की भाजपा ने सरकार का तब साथ नहीं दिया था. लेकिन इसबार सरकार के प्रयास अहम् तो रहे ही, विपक्ष ने भी सहकारी संघवाद को चरितार्थ किया. मोदी सरकार का एक बड़ा फैसला नोटबंदी रहा. एक आरटीआई से आरबीआई के एक मीटिंग के मिनट्स निकाले गए और पता चला कि तत्कालीन गवर्नर उर्जित पटेल सहित पूरा आरबीआई बोर्ड इस नोटबंदी के खिलाफ था. रघुराम राजन भी इसके खिलाफ थे, 500 और 1000 के नोट्स मिलकर कुल करेंसी का 86% बनाते थे, यह जाहिर था कि इसपर अचानक रोक एक बड़ा संकट ला सकता था. लेकिन नोटबंदी की गयी . बार-बार नियम बदले गए, लोग लम्बी कतारों में खड़े रहे, बार-बार सरकार बताती रही कि यह काला धन के खिलाफ है तो कभी यह फेक करेंसी के खिलाफ है तो कभी कहा कि इससे कश्मीर में आतंकियों की कमर टूट जायेगी (पुलवामा फिर भी हुआ), यह देश को कैशलेस इकॉनमी की ओर ले जायेगा, आदि-आदि. जिस देश के लोगों का अभी इसी सरकार ने जनधन से अकाउंट खुलवाया हो, वह कैसे तुरंत ही कैशलेस इकॉनमी की तरफ बढ़ जायेगा. इसका तर्क उससमय भोथरा हो गया जब सरकार ने दो बड़ी करेंसी का नोट हटाकर एक बहुत बड़ी करेंसी (2000 रूपये) निर्गत कर दी. नोटबंदी ने इनफॉर्मल इकॉनमी को चोट तो पहुंचाई ही, कितने नोट जमा हुए और कितने नए छापे गए, यह भी एक रहस्य ही रहा. जीएसटी और नोटबंदी का असर पड़ना ही था और यह पड़ा भी. फिर सरकार ने आरबीआई गवर्नर उर्जित पटेल पर इंटरेस्ट रेट कम करने का दबाव बनाया और उर्जित ने इस्तीफ़ा देना ज्यादा उचित समझा. नोटबंदी, जनधन योजना आदि से बैंकिंग सेक्टर के कर्मचारियों पर अतिरिक्त दबाव भी पड़ा लेकिन मोदी सरकार ने भी बैंक बोर्ड ब्यूरो द्वारा सुझाये सुधारों को लागु करने में कोई दिलचस्पी नहीं दिखाई. ध्यातव्य है कि जनधन, आधार और मोबाइल (JAM ट्रिनिटी ) की योजना पहले मनमोहन सिंह के कार्यकाल में सोची गयी और शुरू की गयी और उस समय विपक्ष में बैठी भाजपा ने आधार का पुरजोर विरोध किया था. सत्ता में आने पर यही आधार, इतना अधिक अनिवार्य बनाया गया कि कई बार सुप्रीम कोर्ट की शरण लेनी पड़ी. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **गरीब महिला के रसोई में सिलेंडर :** \n\nउज्ज्वला योजना और गिव अप योजना खासी सफल और चर्चित रही. यहाँ यह कहना जरुरी है कि राहुल गाँधी UPA-II के समय फिस्कल डीफिसिट को कम करने की गरज से ही साल में केवल 9 सिलेंडरों पर सब्सिडी रखना चाहते थे और बाकी तीन सिलेंडर रेफीलिंग कॉस्ट को बाजार आधारित रखना चाहते थे. उस वक्त में भाजपा के राजनाथ सिंह बेहद कड़े विरोध में संसद की कार्यवाही ही नहीं चलने दे रहे थे. मोदी सरकार ने स्वयं से सब्सिडी इन सिलेंडरों पर छोड़ने की बात कही और इसे राष्ट्रीय अभिमान से जोड़ दिया और यह भी कि इससे किसी गरीब महिला के रसोई में सिलेंडर पहुंचेगा. यहां यह समझना जरुरी है कि यह काम सरकार का ही है कि गरीब के घर में सब्सीडाइज्ड सिलेंडर पहुंचे पर इसे गिव अप अभियान से होशियारी से जोड़ दिया गया . एक पार्टी जो तीन सिलेंडर पर भी सब्सिडी छोड़ने के खिलाफ थी, उसकी सरकार ने गिव अप अभियान में बारहो सिलेंडर पर सब्सिडी हटा ली.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **18000 गांवो में बिजली :**\n\nइन्फ्रास्ट्रक्चर के क्षेत्र में यकीनन मोदी सरकार ने उल्लेखनीय काम किया है. राष्ट्रीय राजमार्ग, भारतमाला एवं सागरमाला प्रोजेक्ट, क्षेत्रीय हवाई मार्ग संपर्क, कोयला व उर्जा क्षेत्र के काम और विद्युतीकरण की उपलब्धियाँ तो हैं ही . लेकिन विद्युतीकरण में मोदी सरकार ने काफी बढ़ा-चढ़ा करके श्रेय लिया. भारत में छह लाख गाँव हैं तकरीबन, जिसमें से पिछले पाँच सालों में 18000 गांवो में बिजली पहुँचाई गयी है. इसी तरह स्वच्छ भारत अभियान, मोदी सरकार का संभवतः सबसे सफल अभियान रहा है . इसमें जागरूकता तो दिखी ही, शौचालयों का निर्माण भी हुआ.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **रोजगार का डेटा उपलब्ध नहीं :** \n\n बेरोजगारी के मोर्चे पर मोदी सरकार के पास कहने को यकीनन कुछ ठोस नहीं है . सरकारी आँकड़े निकाले नहीं गए और आरटीआई से भी कुछ निकालना संभव नहीं रहा. आंकड़ों के अभाव में भी फ़िलहाल यूपीएससी के भर्तियों से एक ट्रेंड समझा जा सकता है. 2015 में जहाँ 1164 भर्तियाँ प्रकाशित की गयीं थीं, वहीं 2016 में 1079, 2017 में 980, 2018 में दशक की न्यूनतम 780 भर्तियाँ ही निर्गत की गयीं, जबकि मिनिस्टर ऑफ़ स्टेट फॉर पर्सनेल जितेन्द्र सिंह ने लोकसभा को अपने एक लिखित जवाब में तकरीबन 1500 आईएएस ऑफिसर्स की कमी की बात स्वीकारी थी. UPA-II के पांच सालों में यही भर्तियाँ बढ़कर 1364 तक पहुँच गयीं थीं. मुद्रा योजना में छोटे और लघु व्यवसायों के लिए वित्त की व्यवस्था की गयी लेकिन इस मद में दिए जाने वाले औसत मात्रा के लोन काफी छोटे हैं जो पर्याप्त नहीं है फिर चूँकि रोजगार का डेटा उपलब्ध नहीं है तो कुछ कहना भी सम्भव नहीं है. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **मोदी की विदेश यात्राएं :** \n\n नरेंद मोदी ने अपने पांच वर्ष के कार्यकाल में कुल 94 देशों की यात्राएँ की थीं, जबकि मनमोहन ने दस वर्षों में कुल 95 देशों की यात्राएँ की थीं. खर्चों की बात यदि न भी करें तो भी एक विषय यहाँ प्रासंगिक है . मनमोहन के दुसरे कार्यकाल में ऍफ़डीआई में 20.02 % का उछाल आया था वहीं मोदी के कार्यकाल में 3.08 % की गिरावट देखी गयी. पारदर्शिता की बात भी यहीं कर लें अगर तो मनमोहन के साथ विदेश जाने वाले व्यवसायियों के नाम सार्वजनिक तौर पर जाने जा सकते थे, लेकिन आरटीआई द्वारा मोदी की विदेश यात्राओं में साथ जाने वाले व्यवसायियों के नाम जानने पर पाबंदी थी. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **पुलिस रिफार्म ठन्डे बस्ते में :** \n\nमोदी सरकार ने एक परसेप्शन बेहद ही बेहतरीन ढंग से गढ़ा और वह था सुरक्षा की दृष्टि से मजबूत सरकार. घर में घुसकर मारने वाली सरकार, फैसले लेने वाली सरकार. फिर भी पुलवामा में चालीस जवान मारे गए जबकि सुचना थी और जवानों को हवाई मार्ग से नहीं ले जाया गया . वह एक सुरक्षा चूक ही थी कि उस मार्ग पर कैसे भी स्कोर्पियो पहुंच सकी. इसका जवाब बालाकोट ओपरेशन से किया गया, जिसकी सफलता आजतक संदिग्ध बताई जाती है. उम्मीद थी कि जिसतरह उरी सर्जिकल स्ट्राइक के फोटो व विडिओ जारी किये गए, चुनाव के समय ही सही, बालाकोट के भी जारी किये जायेंगे, क्लाउड थ्योरी जरुर प्रचारित हुई. अभी पता चला कि अपना विमान ही क्षतिग्रस्त हुआ और जवान मारा गया. बालाकोट के बाद कैप्टन अभिनन्दन पकड़ लिए गए और अंततः सरकार के प्रयासों से उनकी वापसी हुई. अगर यह तुलना करें कि मोदी सरकार रक्षा क्षेत्र को बजट दृष्टिकोण से कितना महत्त्व देती है तो यह काफी हाशिये पर है. यह हाल तो खैर मनमोहन सिंह का भी रहा लेकिन कम से कम वह सरकार रक्षा मद को खर्च करने के मामले में मोदी सरकार से बेहतर दिखती है. उम्मीद थी लेकिन मोदी सरकार ने कोई रक्षा सुधार भी प्रारंभ नहीं किया. पुलिस रिफार्म भी ठन्डे बस्ते में रहा. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **कश्मीर फिर से अशांत :** \n\n कश्मीर मुद्दे पर भी एक पड़ताल जरूरी है. मनमोहन सिंह की सरकार ने एक अपेक्षाकृत शांत कश्मीर मोदी सरकार को सौपा था. उम्मीद थी कि स्पष्ट बहुमत की मोदी सरकार कश्मीर मुद्दे को एक निर्णायक मोड़ पर पहुंचाएगी लेकिन सरकार की नीति में एकतरफा सिक्योरिटी फोर्स अप्रोच ही दिखा और आज कश्मीर फिर से अशांत हो उठा है. युद्ध और सुरक्षा दबाव अकेले इसका समाधान नहीं कर सकती. भारत, पाकिस्तान को पहले ही कितनी बार युद्ध में हरा चुका है और मोदी सरकार भी कश्मीर में एकतरफा नीति का परिणाम सकारात्मक नहीं है यह देख चुकी है.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **भाजपा को राज्य सभा में भी बहुमत मिलने की उम्मीद :** \n\n मोदी सरकार में लोकतांत्रिक एवं सांविधानिक संस्थाएं भी दबाव में रहीं. सुप्रीम कोर्ट के जजों ने पहली बार प्रेस कांफ्रेंस की और अपना विरोध मुख्य न्यायाधीश के प्रति जताया. इस विरोध के पीछे जो केस था वह जज लोया केस था. जज लोया सोहराबुद्दीन फेक एनकाउंटर केस को देख रहे थे, जब वे मृत पाए गए थे. सबरीमाला मंदिर केस में सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने स्पष्ट ही निर्देश दिया था कि किसी भी उम्र की महिला मंदिर में प्रवेश कर सकती है लेकिन फिर भी भाजपा केरल में इस भावना के विरुद्ध लामबंद रही. विश्वविद्यालयों पर वैचारिक आक्रमण किए गए, उनकी स्वायत्तता को परे करते हुए एच आर डी मिनिस्ट्री की तरफ से गाईडलाइन आयी कि अब पीएचडी केवल ‘नेशनल रिलेवेंट टॉपिक’ पर ही करवायी जाय. संसद के कई बिल जैसे आधार बिल और इलेक्टोरल बॉन्ड बिल को मनी बिल व फाइनेंस बिल बताकर लोकसभा से ही पास कराया गया और उसे राज्य सभा तक पहुँचने ही नहीं दिया गया क्योंकि वहाँ भाजपा का बहुमत नहीं था. सुप्रीम कोर्ट का हस्तक्षेप हुआ तो ओर्डिनेंस रूट अपनाया गया. इस नए बहुमत के साथ अगले साल अप्रैल तक संभवतः भाजपा को राज्य सभा में भी बहुमत मिलने की उम्मीद है, आप कल्पना करिए फिर कितनी गुंजायश बचेगी बहस की. c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **काला धन, सफेद किया जा सकता है :** \n\n सबसे इंट्रेस्टिंग रहा इलेक्टोरल बॉन्ड का मामला. इसमें राजनीतिक दलों को कितना भी चंदा दिया जा सकता है और उसपर कंपनी को टैक्स में 80 GGB के तहत 100% छूट भी मिलेगी और दान दाताओं को अपना नाम भी सार्वजानिक नहीं करना होगा. आरटीआई यहाँ भी बेबस रही. पूरी दुनिया में ऐसा उदाहरण नहीं मिलता. इसपर टिप्पणी करते हुए सुप्रीम कोर्ट के मुख्य न्यायाधीश गोगोई ने कहा था कि इससे तो काला धन, सफेद किया जा सकता है. अब नोटबंदी के उद्देश्य का, क्या? एफसीआरए ऐक्ट को संशोधित किया गया, जिससे भाजपा, काँग्रेस और लेफ्ट पार्टियाँ किसी भी विदेशी स्रोत से धन ले सकती हैं और उनपर कभी कोई जाँच नहीं बिठाई जा सकती. इस संशोधन को 1976 से ही प्रभावी कर दिया गया क्योंकि दिल्ली हाईकोर्ट 1976 से ऐसे ही मामलों पर एक जाँच बिठाने वाली थी. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **भारत-अमरीका न्यूक्लियर संधि :** \n\n इन पांच सालों में जुबानी जो गलत बातें कही गयीं उन्हें जाने भी दें तो भी फेक न्यूज, फेक तथ्यों के आधार पर ट्वीट, लव जिहाद, घर वापसी, नेशनलीज्म को देशभक्ति का पर्याय बना देना, सड़कों और शहरों का नामकरण जिसमें कि अँग्रेजों के द्वारा दिये गये नाम स्वीकार किए गए लेकिन मुस्लिम नाम खासकर बदले गए, ट्रॉल की परंपरा, माॅब लींन्चिंग, आदि पर सख्त कदम नहीं लिए गए. संविधान के प्रीएंबल के कुछ शब्द जैसे सेकुलरिज्म बिल्कुल ही अप्रासंगिक करने की कोशिशें हुईं. जेट एयरवेज और बीएसएनएल के लोगों की नौकिरयां और उनकी उदास आँखें लंबे वक्त तक याद रहेंगी. जियो यूनिवर्सिटी का बिना अस्तित्व में आए ही इंस्टीट्यूट ऑफ एमीनेंस बन जाना रहस्य रहेगा. विदेश नीति की बात करें तो क्षेत्र में कोई नई पहल मुकाम तक नहीं पहुंची और सार्क ठिठका पड़ा रहा. वैश्विक राजनीति में कोई एक उपलब्धि नहीं है जिसे भारत-अमरीका न्यूक्लियर संधि के समकक्ष रखा जाए. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **दुःख प्रकट करे या विकास का उलाहना दे :** \n\nभाजपा अथवा किसी भी दल अथवा सांसद के सफलता की प्रशंसा का आधार क्या यह ही होना चाहिए कि उसने चुनाव को अन्य दलों के मुकाबले अधिक बेहतर ढंग से प्रबंधित किया? क्या चुनाव बेहतर प्रबंधन की परीक्षा है न कि बेहतर को चुनने की प्रक्रिया? यह कुछ वैसे बात हुई कि बेहतर नकल प्रबंधन करके यदि कोई विद्यार्थी मेरिट में आता हो तो वह उसके माता पिता को स्वीकार्य होने लगे, इससे कोई अंतर न पड़े कि विद्यार्थी ने कुछ सीखा अथवा नहीं. कितना विकास माननीय सांसद जी ने किया अथवा सरकार ने किया, यह प्रश्न गौड़ हो गया है, प्रश्न महत्वपूर्ण यह हो गया कि कौन नेता या कौन सा दल कितना बेहतर दाँव चलता है और चुनाव जीत जाता है! पिछली सरकार के चुनाव जीतने का अर्थ क्या यह है कि उसने जो प्रशासन के क्षेत्र में प्रदर्शन किया, उसकी समीक्षा नहीं होनी चाहिए या जीत का अर्थ उनके हर कदम का सही होना भी मान लिया जाय ? लगातार मोदी सरकार, चुनाव मोड में रही है, यह इस हद तक हुआ है कि पार्टी और सरकार का अंतर एक हद तक मिट गया है. अब चूँकि एक बार फिर मोदी सरकार प्रचंड बहुमत से आयी है तो ऊपर लिखे प्रशासन दृष्टिकोण की समीक्षा बेहद समीचीन है. यहाँ से भाजपा को चुनौती लेनी है और आगे बढ़ना है . पहली बार विकास का मुद्दा था तो दुसरी बार केवल अपने काम के आधार पर चुनाव लड़ने की बजाय भाजपा ने अधिकांशतः भावनात्मक मुद्दों पर चुनाव लड़ा है. यह बात नोट की जाय. जब मै प्रशासनिक उपलब्धियाँ खंगालता हूँ तो मै हद से हद यहां तक सोच पाता हूँ कि यदि काम को आधार बनाया जाये तो भाजपा की दिल्ली की राह दोबारा जरुर मुश्किल होती. लेकिन जाहिर है कि वोटर किसी भी सांसद और पार्टी का काम देखने की बजाय समीकरण और प्रबंधन में स्वयं को अधिक फिट पाता है. इसलिए ही तो सभी पार्टियों के कुछ अच्छे नेता जिनका अपने क्षेत्र में काम करने का रिकॉर्ड है, वे हार गए हैं और कई चेहरे जिनका राजनीति से अथवा किसी भी प्रकार के जमीनी संघर्ष से कोई सरोकार नहीं है, वे जीत गए हैं. कामकाज करना और जनता की आकांक्षाओं को पूरा करना इतना आसान नहीं है. पहचान के मुद्दे पर लोगों को बांट कर उन्हें स्वतंत्र वोटर से प्रतिबद्ध वोटबैंक बना देने से चुनाव आसान हो जाता है. जब किसी भी चुनाव में वोट देते समय एक वोटर यह नहीं देखता कि किसने कितना काम किया है या किसने कैसे काम करने का वादा किया है, बस किसी पहचान जैसे जाति, धर्म आदि या किसी जनहित के स्थान पर किसी भावनात्मक मुद्दे को आधार बनाकर अपना कीमती वोट दे देता है तो उसे यह भी अधिकार कहां रह जाता है कि वह अपने देश की दारुण हालत पर दुःख प्रकट करे या विकास का उलाहना दे. जनता ने तो अपना फैसला जरुर दिया है लेकिन इतना जरुर कहना होगा कि प्रबंधन ने प्रशासन पर बाजी मारी है. जीत की इस सुनामी में भी जायज मुद्दों की घास अभी बची हुई है जिनका यह सुनामी कुछ भी न कर सकी है.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nपूरी आशा से यह फिर भी लिखना चाहता हूँ कि नई मोदी सरकार यह अवसर नहीं गंवायेगी और भारत को उसका वाजिब स्थान दिलायेगी.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **श्रीश पाठक**  \n**(लेखक गलगोटिया यूनिवर्सिटी राजनीति विज्ञान विभाग के अध्यक्ष हैं)**'<br />Author: 'sunshinedeepak'  id: 'btiyk2'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/btiyk2/सनम_म_घस_परबधन_बनम_परशसन/</li>

And again, I would like to stress the point that I\'m talking about him, not BJP at large. Let alone the Pulwama or radar controversies, his views are as removed from reality as Trump\'s. Remember what he said when talking about global warming? "It\'s not the world that has changed, it is us and our habits" and then "Ganesh\'s was the first surgery." These are totally Pappu-worthy statements.\n\nAnd then Pragya Thakur. Yes, I know she has brought trouble every time she has spoken. But will it be too far-fetched to say that she\'s an extremist, again not good for the country? How likely is it that she actually wouldn\'t have killed Muslims had she been given the chance, even if you say the terrorism case was totally false? And other BJP workers have given terribly awful statements in public as well. Modi only distanced himself from Pragya because of the massive outrage but he never did the same for other, lesser well known party workers. He is just being a showman. \n\nAnd it seems to be a foregone conclusion on this sub that all Muslims are bad for the country. How many incidents will it take for you to swallow that goddamn pride and realize extremists are bad across the board and exist in all religions? I want a country with Hindu values as well as anyone but that doesn\'t have to mean we\'ll throw any Muslim under the bus for being of a different religion.\n\nNow for Kashmir. Why is this one region so full of reports of human rights violations? If even children are being forced to trouble the police for decades, ask yourself if it\'s really them or us that is the problem. Sure, a lot of the violence is incited by parties from our neighbours. But do you really think that the Indian government is being totally honest here? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext topic, influence of the West on India. It is undeniable that both the US and a significant part of Europe are acting in bad faith and using media as weapons. But to say a democracy is bad just because the West will be able to pull the strings if the leadership is weak is nuts! Giving absolute power to anyone is a bad idea. Has it ever worked out for any other country in history? Look at N Korea, China, Russia, African countries, Saudi Arabia. We very much need a strong opposition. Democracy still has undeniable positives over an all-powerful government which can control any other part of the country at its whim.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, for Pakistan. Yes, it\'s been an awful neighbour. But wasn\'t that the plan of Britain when it let us believe in the two nation theory? That we\'ll keep fighting among ourselves so that they can profit? How much have we both have to spend over the years not only in money but in human life just because we don\'t trust each other? And who\'s benefited the most from this conflict by selling both sides arms and picking sides? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am aware that this was an incoherent ramble for the most part but I had to get these things off my chest. With how things are going, we aren\'t headed towards a grand economy with international sway. We\'re headed towards a well of mediocrity which will be really tough to get out of. Maybe this was all useless and get buried.

It\'s important because these are the ideas that will eventually shape the opposition\'s future campaigns. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome important points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The westerners confirm that the congress party and its ecosystem is out of touch with the masses. \n2. They confirm the BJP\'s economic policies will benefit Indian corporations looking to keep India\'s data for themselves. \n3. They know that a large percentage of Indians actually favour autocracy: [https://qz.com/india/1103955/in-india-the-worlds-largest-democracy-55-of-people-feel-autocracy-is-good-for-governance/](https://qz.com/india/1103955/in-india-the-worlds-largest-democracy-55-of-people-feel-autocracy-is-good-for-governance/) because weak, coalition governments are easily compromised. If the BJP delivers, Indians won\'t resist an \'opposition-mukt\' Bharat. \n4. They know the BJP won\'t go away because it\'s extremely well funded.\n5. They confirm that the Congress is afraid of being seen as a Muslim party. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithin this, we see the basics for what the opposition and it\'s foreign funded media will do over the next 5 years. Get ready to read story after story on the following issues:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Indian corporations are evil. Ambanis, Adanis are bad. Their wealth in relation to the gareeb of the country will be highlighted. The idea of Indian entrepreneurship and "make in india" will be stigmatized as un-necessary and a "failure". Crony capitalists. \n2. After making villains of India\'s young entrepreneurs and businessmen, the foreign funded media will promote western corporations as "heroes", the ONLY ones capable of solving India\'s problems by monopolizing it\'s natural resources and data. Not the second coming of the East India Company. \n3. Any initiatives favoring big businesses - land acquisition laws for instance - will be portrayed as attacks on poor people and attacks on the environment. And let\'s not forget: crony capitalism. \n4. Any infrastructure development - will also be portrayed as attacks on poor people and attacks on the environment. "Why build that highway when its bad for the environment?"\n5. They will portray Modi and the BJP as a threat to democracy. \n6. MUSALMAAN KHATRE MEIN HAI. Over and over again. All stories of poor Muslims benefiting from government initiatives will be ignored or labelled as "RSS" propaganda. \n7. More polarization on the basis of caste, gender, and every other thing you can think of. Hindus will be portrayed as casteist, racist, anti-women, anti-&lt;xyz&gt;. \n8. EACH and EVERY non-Brahmin group WILL be turned into a VICTIM. Polarization on steroids. You\'ll see a million articles on why &lt;xyz&gt; is not represented in positions of authority in India\'s private and public sector. There will be another million articles written on why reservations are GOOD and why merit doesn\'t exist. They will try to break ANY hindu unity that was created over the past 5 years. \n9. Brahmins will be portrayed as the "white" people of India. Evil, un-trustworthy, un-deserving. Christians will be portrayed as having greater moral character. \n10. Foreign funded NGOs will be promoted as harbingers of "human rights", and their activities WILL be portrayed as necessary counters to the government\'s "incompetence". \n11. Lastly, Hindus will be portrayed as either 1. non existent, because there\'s no such thing as a hindu, or 2. savages adhering to horrifically out-dated and harmful customs. Every hindu festival will be shown as being harmful to society and the environment.  \n12. Any positive representations of \'hinduism\' on the global stage, such as yoga, will be disassociated from hinduism by "academics" and associated with buddhism instead. Hindus will be accused of having "appropriated" or stolen yoga from buddhists or other pagans. \n13. Modi, and the BJP will be portrayed as warmongerers that dont want peace with Pakistan. You\'ll see a million articles portraying Pakistan as the victim, and as more "secular" and committed to peace than India. Pakistan\'s image is all set for a make-over, they will no longer be called "terrorists". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last 5 years were quite easy for the BJP. Opposition media didn\'t have a good attack plan, and they expected Hindus to be divided along caste lines. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe saw a propaganda campaign based on the 13 topics, but the firing was sporadic and un-coordinated. It was also well countered. \n\nNow, the foreign funded media will be far better organized and the frequency of this type of content will increase. Algorithms on western platforms will be rigged . They will also enter the regional language space, spreading stories based on the 13 topics in other languages. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe BJP needs to greatly expand its media presence, and maintain its control on the discussion. A funding increase is long overdue.  If it wants to maintain its advantage, the BJP must not lose the masses.'<br />Author: 'twatavious'  id: 'btfdxw'<br />Score:51<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/btfdxw/what_happens_next_the_guardians_latest_editorial/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Towards an Indian Identity'<br />Body: 'Consider this video by Congress MP 2014-19 Deepender Hooda. He mocks Khattar and BJP by saying that maybe they are from Gujarat or maybe they are from somewhere else but their "culture" does not match our Haryanvi culture and they do not belong here. He isn\'t claiming that BJP or Khattar is incompetent but that a Khattar born in Haryana is an outsider. Since this is Congress, Liberals will remains silent on this bullshit. Now, compare this to what  "Yogi" Adityanath said in [Aap ki Adalat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jgQolRTeBQ), "those Mughals who attacked us cannot be glorified but Muslims of India today are part of India and are our responsibility".  \nThroughout India\'s history, there was a regional identity beyond the national one. A "Khattar" remains Punjabi despite born in Haryana. A "Patel" born in Bengal is still a Gujarati. A Tamil Brahmin remains "Tamil" even if he is born in Mumbai and never stepped outside of it. This lack of pan-Indian identity was a problem. Mughals, as well as Britishers, were able to take on Hindu kings one by one. The nation never stood as one. In 1989, Kashmiri Hindus were kicked out and non-Kashmiri Hindus shrugged. Same with the attacks on Sikhs in 1984. As long as "our" regional identity was not under attack, we ignored and moved on.  \nOur laws made things worse. The states were divided on a linguistic basis making the regional identity stronger. Till Vajpayee government, it was impossible to even traverse across India due to the lack of highways which further reduced interstate commerce. It was hard to sell agricultural produce of one state in another in India due to high interstate taxes. These laws encouraged a regional identity over an Indian one. After [1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area), it would have been easier for a French to ship and sell goods in Germany than for a Punjabi to ship and sell goods in Rajasthan.  \nStarting with Vajpayee and now with Modi, we have finally arrived at a situation where a pan-Indian dominates other identities. Bhojpuri songs [praise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbPaz2Yw68s) Modi as "son of Mother India", Kannadiga author Bhayarappa [praised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oPyoGlYrFM) Modi in Kannada, Tamil intellectual [appealed](https://www.opindia.com/2019/04/109-eminent-tamil-intellectuals-appeal-to-tamil-nadu-voters-to-reelect-narendra-modi/) to Tamilians to vote for Modi and even a Muslim woman in UP [named](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/muslim-woman-names-newborn-narendra-modi/articleshow/69502003.cms) his newly born son after Modi.

Once that discussion gets started, nobody else in BJP needed to say a word or even take a side. They could openly criticize her and reprimand her, but the gates of silence were opened and nothing can shut them now.\n\nThis may be viewed as "malicious" by some, but it\'s not. That deafening silence over certain issues - be it Gandhi\'s infallibility and his "mahatma tag", be it Godse\'s vilification and his "terrorist/murderer" tag, be it the myth of Hindu Terror, be it the dubious laurels of bravery laid on Karkare - all discussion of those issues was taboo.\n\nWhatever anyone might think about any of these things, right/wrong, good/bad, it\'s impossible to come to a rational or reasonable conclusion without examining the facts of the issue in the light and speaking about them openly. That\'s what free speech is for - so that all ideas can be thrashed out and evaluated openly between different sides.\n\nToday, Kashmiri Muslims can come on TV and refuse to condemn active terrorists, Kashmiri politicians can coddle terrorists killing civilians (or eulogize their elimination), call them sons of the soil, blame India/Army for them, and say all kinds of shit live on TV and to the press, and nobody cares by tomorrow.\n\nBut one lone lady in saffron says that one man who killed another man 60 years ago (and admitted his guilt in open court and gave his reasons for it) was not a terrorist, and was a patriot, and everyone loses their minds for a month.\n\nThis kind of silence was being used to stifle any critical examination of the facts, by those who found it inconvenient to have the truth spoken. And they\'re still desperately trying to slam that door shut, but it\'s not working.\n\nModi &amp; Co have opened up such difficult cans of worms in a way that everyone else has **no option but to engage** in that debate, and once they do, the facts themselves **crush** the false narratives that were built up around them. \n\nThe horrendous treatment of PV Narasimha Rao upon his death. The discarding of Sardar Patel. Indira Gandhi and the Emergency. The horrible language they used for ABV. Rajiv Gandhi as Brashtachari No.1. Vacationing on our Aircraft Carrier with family and buddies. "Big tree falls" and the 1984 riots. Shastri\'s suspicious death (via Agnihotri). The utter shame and indignity of MMS being a remote control puppet. Hindu Terror. Gandhi. Godse. Garibi Hatao. Muslims being bakras of INC. Fake secularism. Electricity on Eid but not on Diwali. Shamshaan ghaat vs kabristan. Hinduphobia. Joi Shri Ram. The repulsive practice of Triple Talaq. The skin-crawling concept of Nikah Halala. 370 and 35A. Nepotism and Corruption in Judiciary. The fact that almost all terrorism today HAS a religion, and that religion is Islam. The ECOSYSTEM itself.\n\nThe entire ecosystem went bonkers every time each can was opened, and they failed to silence the truth spectacularly. And in doing so, they revealed themselves. Refusing to review Tashkent Files was a big one.

But felt it would reach a lot more people if its made as a post\n\nI'm not a expert but have been following the regional political scenario of TN since 2015. So i thought I would make a consolidated list of key factors behind the loss of BJP in Tamil Nadu\n\n1. Dravidian Politics\n2. Political void created by the demise of J.Jayalalitha\n3. Political turmoil done by AIADMK(alliance party of BJP) right after the demise of J.Jayalalitha\n4. poor handling of media across Tamil platforms (Including social media,Film &amp; cinema,TV shows etc)\n5. Deciding Factor:- Money\n\n[J.Jayalalitha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayalalithaa) was a wonderful ally for NDA (M.Thambidurai of AIADMK was even posted as The Deputy speaker of Lok Sabha). But her untimely demise and the [political drama](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sasikala-s-mlas-locked-up-in-luxury-without-their-freedom/story-xKZpJ6qkE1SZqiYgltrduK.html) that soon ensued, orchestrated by Sasikala [damaged](https://zeenews.india.com/tamil-nadu/from-aiadmk-split-to-merger-and-crisis-a-timeline-of-events-since-ammas-death-2035383.html) AIADMK's public image. Other regional problems such as [Floods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_South_Indian_floods), [Sterlite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoothukudi_massacre), [Hydro-Carbon](https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha-2019/hydrocarbon-issue-haunts-voters-in-delta/article26681574.ece), [Cauvery](https://www.ndtv.com/tamil-nadu-news/cauvery-protests-live-updates-tamil-outfit-protests-outside-ipl-venue-in-chennai-1835541), [Jallikattu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_pro-jallikattu_protests), [Pollachi](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/pollachi-the-answered-and-unanswered-questions) issue were wonderfully  redirected towards BJP and its alliances (even though the main culprits in these issues were DMK and Karunanithi) hence further damaging BJP's Image.\n\nSocial media in Tamil platforms became a huge problem for BJP's Tamil wing, as many social issues were diverted towards NDA. even though higher amount of advertisement on social media platforms was done by NDA, its reach failed to grasp southerners due to the language barrier, and counteractive memes created by the opposing parties. people forgot about the problems and havoc's done by DMK and its allies during the pre-facebook era. But they were  constantly reminded of even the minor problems directed towards NDA because of social media platforms.\n\nHinduphobia started to leech into Tamil Cinema as more and more movies were made indirectly insulting hindus and many more films were made with the intention of projecting BJP and the whole of northerners as villains. (Kaththi,Sarkar,Mersal,Kaala,Thuppaki Munai etc to name a few.) Even though some movies showcased hinduphobia blatantly, most of them had a more hidden notions against Hindus as a whole.   \n\nBut the deciding factor boils down to the money given out to people. Govt employees where given ridiculous amount of freedom and the police where highly restricted during DMK's rule (2006-2011). Hence making the current govt  employees to favor the nefarious acts of DMK (money moving from one place to another in their own personal and government vehicles, a wonderful example could be of around [3.47 crores seized](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/salem/poll-officials-seize-rs-3-47cr-from-govt-bus/articleshow/68713320.cms) in a govt bus from Thiruvannamalai where the money could be pinned to the Union of Thiruvannamalai bus depot which affiliates itself to DMK). Which resulted in efficient moving of money from one place to another.\n\nEither a big reform should be brought towards the political architecture of BJP's southern wing, or a character revamp should be done on existing leaders of its southern wing. People should be constantly reminded of all the havoc created by DMK, arising problem's core roots should be properly addressed,sourced and pinned towards [DMK](https://myvoice.opindia.com/2019/01/entry-of-scientific-corruption-in-tamil-nadu-politics-and-how-to-save-the-state/), [kanimozhi, A.Raja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2G_spectrum_scam), [Karti Chithambaram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karti_Chidambaram#Court_cases), [Dhayanithi Maran](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Noose-tightens-around-Dayanidhi-Maran-in-BSNL-case/articleshow/36687038.cms) etc and should be publicly shamed for the existing cases against them and should promptly be sent to jail.\n\nElse TN would not have any future for themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S: links to multiple sources have been provided to give a context to the reader for the issues.

      <li>Title::: 'Information warfare!'<br />Body: "We are living in the age of information warfare, wars are not being fought in the battlefields using weapons but it is being fought in our minds. India is currently the biggest target of information warfare right now in the world because being a democracy it can be manipulated rather easily while China and Russia have virtually insulated their countries from any type of outside interference. Only agency which is spreading info or disinfo is their government. India being a democracy, depends on correct information for its proper functioning, whom will we elect will be decided by the perception of people. That is why it is very critical to have our own information networks which are spreading info with our lens and countering disinfo from other sources. \n\nHistorically in India, television, radio print and bollywood(cinema) have been the source of all information, but now with 4g and smartphone revolution, most of the information access has shifted to internet platforms. The most worrying part of this shift is that most of these platforms are owned and operated directly by US and Chinese companies which are proxies of their respective state. Facebook, Whatsapp, Twitter, Reddit, Quora, Tiktok etc. are examples of such platforms. \n\nThen there are publishers, earlier they used to tie up with Indian counterparts to operate in India, like Reuters, BBC, Star Network, SONY. Now most of them are operating directly in India. But the real threats are the new age networks like Hotstar, Netflix, Vice Media, Al Jazeera, Buzzfeed etc. Earlier they used to work in the pop culture and entertainment space, but now they have started to slowly show their colours and have entered infotainment and documentary space. This is the space which has real potential for propaganda and to fool naive ignorant Indians into believing which is untruthful and harmful to them. People are watching documentaries in hordes from these places and are being manipulated. Some of their content has propaganda elements and some of them are complete propaganda but all of them have a common theme, Hinduphobia. These networks come in India with a strategy and it shows in their model.  They hire far left and disgruntled citizens mostly from subaltern population to use them as pawns in their game of demonizing anything even remotely Hindu/Hidutva/Dharmic. \n\nAlthough it could be argued that being a democracy they should be allowed, but then they need to be neutralized with counter narrative and I don't see any counter narrative of significance. Yes there are some websites like OpIndia, Swarajya and some youtube channels working on this, but they are most of the times reactionary and are constantly on the defensive. Things have gone so bad that nytimes is making documentary in India in Sabarimala which is full of lies and propaganda. Who gave permission for them to go there? Why haven't we made our own perspectives known to others? Where are our own documentaries?\n\nGrowing up, in most of my leisure time I used to watch Discovery and National Geographic channel like channels, I always used to wonder why there aren't Indian channels like these creating videos, stories, documentaries etc with our lens. Over the time things changed, Indians started making videos for them but they were mostly employees, the lens used was again western, intellectual property was always owned by western media houses. \n\nTake the case of Netflix and Amazon Prime, all of the content that they have created are hinduphobic or has some elements of such nature. e.g. Sacred Games, Leila etc. \n\nEarlier they used to influence the minds of westerners about Indians, but now they are influencing us Indians directly. Allowing them to operate in India was a mistake, they are a trojan horse for American deep state. America has a complete warchest of weapons of information warfare. Nytimes, NPR, Washington Post, New Yorker, FT, Time,the Economist, WSJ, although may appear as free and fair at the surface but aren't, they work for American state, left wing or right wing, it doesn't matter. \n\nWe should learn from different models that have worked like Al Jazeera, RT, GlobalTimes, although they are state sponsored, they are very successful in giving back to western powers in their own language. Our government is incompetent and imbecile, they don't have the guts to do it, forget about criticizing US they cannot even counter propaganda against us. But it cannot be changed now, all we can do is create and build counter narratives, and we will have to do it ourselves.

It also ordered the interior minister to ensure the adopted families of the two girls were protected from any legal action issued by their Hindu parents.\n\nWhen this event first came to light, there were assurances from Pakistanis on Reddit that the two children would be returned to their parents.

      <li>Title::: "Individual Privacy and its importance w.r.t. India's sovereignty"<br />Body: '## Right to Privacy\n\nRight to privacy is fundamental to us. Without it, in some ways we lose our individuality. Some will claim stuff like "I have nothing to hide, so I have no need for privacy", but that\'s simply like saying "I have nothing to say, so I don\'t need the right to freedom of speech"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy\n\n## How does it affect us\n\n1. The internet today is used by a lot of people in ways that reveal personal information, sometimes things that they wouldn\'t reveal to any human face to face.\n\n2. The internet is monitored by various agencies, private and governmental.\n\nWhat this means is that various agencies know intimate details about a lot of users. And thanks to rapid increases in compute power, along with better algorithms, we can fully analyse a lot of details about very many people very quickly. We can easily analyse their political leanings, their likes and dislikes, where they are, what their daily routine is.\n\nThis analysis is useful to make content that is personalised to individuals. You can for e.g. personalise the ads they see, to only the things they are interested in. You can also use this data to manipulate people. This is what [Cambridge Analytica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica) was doing. They were manipulating elections by manipulating the voters.\nSource : https://arstechnica.com/series/cambridge-analytica-facebook/\n\n## Who would do this in India?\n\nPakistan and China would both love to destroy India form the Inside. US would love to keep governments that are pro-US and anti-China, even if they are otherwise terrible for India. There\'s a lot of people who would gladly manipulate elections and the people for their own gains.\n\n## So if I stop using Facebook I should be fine right?\n\nNo. Most of these sites use many dirty tactics to track you regardless of where you are on the web, and how you access their website. They use "fingerprinting". They start by putting out "pixel trackers" or other trackers in websites (by convincing the website owner). They use this to then see the users that click on a particular link. They recognise users by a lot of things, like the combination of browser+fonts+cookies. So you can\'t hide by using private browsing or some other cheap tricks. They will track you to the best of their ability. See this post for details : https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track\n\n## So what can we do?\n\n- First step is to use tools that protect your privacy. You can use the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation)\'s Privacy Badger : https://www.eff.org/privacybadger \n\n- Along with this, configure your browser and OS for maximum privacy. Most browsers come with a "do not track" option. Enable it. Windows is infamous for resetting privacy related settings, so you may want to check your settings after updates.\n\n- You can also use tools like "noscript", "ublock origin" and "umatrix" too, although noscript may be a little too hardcore for most users.\n\nAnother good step is to avoid some sites / services altogether, to avoid any bias.\n\n| Service | Popular provider | Alternative |\n| --------|------------------|------------|\n| Search Engine | Google | [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) and [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/)\n| Maps | Google Maps | Open Street Maps, with [Osmand](https://osmand.net/) for Android / iOS |\n| App Store | Play Store, Windows Store, Apple Store| [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) and Aurora store for Android, for Windows get apps from online, for iOS, thankfully Apple is a little  bit privacy minded|\n|Browser|Google Chrome|[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) with telemetry disabled, and privacy badger.|\n\n- Please also read the Terms of Service before you agree.

If the BJP had sought to give Muslims representation in proportion to their population, they should have had 40+ Muslim MPs. This statistic alone is a dramatic illustration of the majoritarian nature of their politics. Of course, it\'s also true that at least one of those 303 MPs was nominated for no reason other than that she is accused of orchestrating a major terror attack against Muslims. And she won over 60% of the vote in one of India\'s major cities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I\'m afraid of what will happen in the next 5 years; very afraid. My thoughts are particularly with our Muslim sisters and brothers, with the Kashmiri people, and with all other minority and marginalised groups in our society.

There are still many checks and balances we have, thanks to our visionary Constitution and other progressive legislation enacted over the decades since. They will try and attack all of these; and it is upto those of us who still believe in these ideals to do our best to defend them and argue for them.

Our hiraeth for a non-existent Islamic   utopia has compelled us to abdicate our organic connection to our land   and to abandon our links to our past. In this part I shall carry the   argument forward to various facets of our social existence.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nAnd  yet we, the Muslims of the Subcontinent, are unique in the  Islamic  world in that when we converted to Islam, we changed our names  from  Indian names to Persian, Turkish and Arabic names.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nThere  are, in reality, no Islamic names. When the Arabs converted to  Islam,  they retained their pre-Islamic names. There was a time in those  early  days when some persons with popular names as Amr, Hisham, Zainab  and  Abdullah were Muslims while others were non-Muslims. The Prophet   (PBUH), too, did not specify any particular names to be used for   Muslims. Similarly, pre-Islamic Turkish and Persian names became   “Islamic” when people converted in these lands. Islamic scholars, too,   agree on this issue but we the Indian Muslims have always changed our   names on conversion.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nMy 8th ancestor, who  converted from Hinduism to Islam after his  migration from the Kashmir  Valley to Amritsar in the early 19th century,  also became Saddique  Sheikh from whatever was his original name. He  didn’t have to. On a  personal note, I have always been partial to the  name Sukhdev since my  childhood. It’s a beautiful flowing name with  elegant, humanitarian  meanings. The equivalent word in Arabic and  Persian is  “Paikar-e-Rahat”. If our society had been a little tolerant, I  would  have added this as a suffix to my name.

A lot of the media focussed on her and called her a 'terrorist' and didn't go after other leaders as much. It also makes other BJP leaders moderate in comparison to her.\n\nAs a bait she made statements ( gomutra curing cancer, shaap on that police officer) that made her detractors double down on their agenda of stupid, uneducated and violent Hindus and Hindutva, calling them (us) chaddis and bhakts and sanhgis, and turned the undecided and neutral Hindu voters to BJP.\n\nAs a conversational opener she talked about stuff (like godse), which might've affected BJP badly if it would've been spoken by Modi or Shah. Pragya saying this maintained a plausible deniability for the top BJP leaders and didn't antagonise the normal voters, while the mention of godse did start a conversation on whether Hindu terrorism is real or made up and will be an important step to curb the hubris of Gandhi and the Nehru family and their decisions, which for so long has been seen as infallible by the general populace."<br />Author: 'O_Bawa'  id: 'bsjmse'<br />Score:47<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bsjmse/why_in_my_opinion_fielding_sadhvi_pragya_was_a/</li>

Despite her flaws, a lot of people seem to respect her for her role in 1971. \n\n**2) Aurangzeb** \\- I think there's a consensus among Hindus that he's one of the most despised historical figures. He banned music, destroyed so many temples, and propagated Islam like no other major ruler. The empire was the largest during his time, but it crumbled very quickly after his death. \n\n**3) Ashoka** \\- So many people are misinformed about Asoka. In truth, he was the ultimate control freak in Indian history. He became a Buddhist long before invading Kalinga and killed all his brothers to get to the throne. Then he told sculptors to write favorably about him in the Ashoka Edicts, about how he regrets his past actions and turned into a good Buddhist. He ruled over the largest territory of any Indian ruler/leader but like Aurangzeb, his empire fell very quickly after his death. \n\nI think that's the problem with strong leaders; the empire/country becomes weak after their death. I hope Modi understand this and works on bringing up young leaders. If BJP is powerless without Modi, then it is a major problem for India's future right-wing politics. \n\nAny thoughts?"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'bshmp0'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bshmp0/is_modi_one_of_the_most_authoritarian_leaders/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Master Of The National Game: Narendra Modi by Swapan Dasgupta'<br />Body: 'Pluggin in from [India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/20121231-narendra-modi-is-a-player-of-national-politics-feels-swapan-dasgupta-761187-1999-11-30) after Modis win of 2012 in Gujarat.\n\n# Narendra Modi does not have to go begging to BJP. Pressure from below will compel BJP to come to him.\n\nIt was December 2002 and the last days of an extremely tense election campaign. I was with Narendra Modi in a small aircraft, flying from Jamnagar to Ahmedabad where he would address an evening rally with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\n\nLeaning across the aisle, he asked: "What do you think?" "Looks very encouraging," I replied. He nodded and then lapsed into a reflective silence. Then, quite abruptly, he shot me another question: "And what if we lose?" I smiled warily and he too smiled back. "But at least I fought a good campaign. I gave my best."\n\nModi had every reason to consider the worst-case scenario. The forces ranged against him in 2002 were formidable. Apart from the liberal intelligentsia and media that held him personally responsible for the post-Godhra riots, it was an open secret that a powerful section around Prime Minister Vajpayee was less than enthusiastic about him. Any electoral mishap, including a failure to secure a resounding victory, would have spelt the end of his political career. For Modi, it was a do-or-die battle.\n\nIn hindsight, that short flight to Ahmedabad was also one of those rarest of rare moments: When a flicker of doubt crossed the mind of a man who has today earned a reputation for being the last word in political decisiveness. Never before not even in those dark days of the late 1990s when he was more or less barred from even visiting Gujarat had I ever seen a hesitant Modi. And never subsequently have I seen his fierce sense of mission falter. Modi is a man blessed with astonishing self-resolve.\n\nOn December 20, as the Electronic Voting Machines revealed the extent of Gujarat\'s determination to persist with its longest-serving Chief Minister, there was a realisation that what was being witnessed was more than just another state Assembly election: Modi was on the cusp of becoming a national phenomenon. Even his fiercest detractors and they still dominate the Indian Establishment have grudgingly admitted that in this 62-year-old Gujarati they are dealing with someone who has the potential of not merely reshaping the rules of electoral politics but even contesting the muddled ambivalence of India.\n\nModi has emerged a leader you can either love or loathe but can\'t ignore.\n\nIn the aftermath of his third consecutive victory in Gujarat, there is certain to be a clamour for giving Modi a national role and even declaring him the BJP\'s prime ministerial candidate for the next General Elections. Hitherto this insistence was confined to a group of enthusiasts active on the social media, a clutch of business leaders wowed by the energy and dynamism of Vibrant Gujarat, a few oddball intellectuals detached from the academic and media establishments and a handful of political activists exasperated by the inability of the BJP to capitalise on the failures of the Central Government. In the past six months or so, as the drift in the BJP has become more palpable, the \'Modi for PM\' constituency has grown exponentially and embraced not only BJP-inclined voters and the party\'s grassroots workers but even a largish section of elite opinion-makers. Modi\'s growing national appeal has even begun to be strongly reflected in opinion polls.\n\nThe trends don\'t reflect a contrarian fad. There are three significant points of value-addition that Modi is likely to bring to the BJP table. The first is the youth vote. Gujarat has clearly demonstrated that Modi\'s most enthusiastic support comes from the below-35s, which explains why Modi\'s election rallies often convey a rock concert mood. They are passionately attracted by his ability to both sell a development dream and translate some of this into reality. In a party often seen as being antediluvian, Modi stands out as the leader with strongly modernist impulses. His 3D campaign may have seemed a needless gimmick akin to the helicopter that never fails to draw an incremental, gawking crowd at political rallies but Modi calculated it would be viewed as an example of his technology-friendly approach in tune with Gujarat\'s aspirational ethos.\n\n**No-nonsense alternative to venal political class**\n\nThe Gujarat experience has also pointed to Modi\'s hold over women\'s imagination. A social psychologist may be able to better explain if this appeal is centred on raw machismo, his status as a single man (something that has also worked to the advantage of Naveen Patnaik in Orissa) or something more complex. Whatever the reason, this appeal is advantageous for a party which sees women and youth as weak links in its social architecture.\n\nThe third feature of Modi\'s political strength is his ability to inspire the BJP\'s bedrock social constituency-the middle classes. This following owes to Modi\'s three perceived strengths: His passion for rapid development, his decisiveness and his personal integrity. In the 1990s, a much smaller middle class rallied behind the BJP because it was seen to be \'different\' from the rest of the political pack. Today, a much larger and more fiercely aspirational middle class may well view Modi as the no-nonsense alternative to a bunch of narrow-minded, self-serving and venal political class.\n\nIn the past, Modi has successfully experimented with creating an all-embracing political community. After the 2002 riots which were attributed to a visceral majoritarian backlash against Muslims, Modi avoided the temptation of recreating the Hindu vote bank of the Ayodhya years. Instead, he invoked Gujarati *asmita* which incorporated the \'*garv se kaho hum Hindu hain*\' theme to something larger and non-contentious. In the process, he subsumed the caste mobilisation that had been a feature of Congress resurgence in the 1980s.\n\nIt is said that Gujarat isn\'t India and that Modi\'s bid to invoke an India Pride will falter in the face of the fractious caste and community mobilisation of the Hindi heartland. There is some merit in the argument. At the same time, Modi\'s critics have failed to take into account the possibility that no meaningful national campaign can be a carbon copy of an approach evolved in the context of just Gujarat.\n\n**Letting public support do the talking**\n\nModi has two cards that have been kept in reserve. The first is the element of class that Modi touched upon tangentially in the final stages of the Gujarat campaign, as a retort to Rahul Gandhi. "Your father, his grandfather and his mother were Prime Ministers," he said in a few rallies, "but my father wasn\'t even a *sarpanch*." This was a direct assault on both privilege and the Gandhi family\'s remarkable sense of entitlement.\n\nThe second reserve card is Modi\'s membership of a backward caste. He has never invoked his OBC status, not least because casteism goes against his commitment to an all-embracing Indian nationalism. But this is a theme that is rarely proclaimed on public platforms. It is a message transmitted through the powerful bush telegraph. In theory, Modi has the weapon to replenish his larger appeal with the OBC\xa0 card. The leaders of caste parties in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar know this and are awkward about confronting him frontally on the social justice theme.\n\nModi\'s strengths are known to the BJP but yet there are misgivings on two counts. First, Modi is seen to be too much of an individualist. Despite being a former RSS *pracharak* who was trained to receive instructions and follow them, Modi is an argumentative Indian. Many RSS veterans are wary of his constant questioning of certitudes.\n\nSecond, flowing from this is the belief that Modi lacks the flexibility to manage the disagreeable world of coalition politics. With Nitish Kumar determined to walk out of the NDA in the event of the BJP naming him as the candidate for the top political job, there is a fear in the party that the BJP would be left in \'majestic isolation\', as happened between 1990 and 1996.\n\nThese are real issues and there is only one way Modi can confront them: By letting public support do the talking. This was precisely how Vajpayee handled very similar problems between the collapse of his 13-day government in 1996 and the election of 1998.\n\nFrankly, the BJP has no option but to anoint Modi soon, giving him the time to build his national profile from his Gandhinagar operational base. The alternative will be a BJP entering the General Election campaign with a sullen, listless and unenthusiastic support base an approach calculated to produce indifferent results and the subsequent inability to play a meaningful post-election role.\n\nWithin the parivar, it is often said that Modi has unlearnt everything he imbibed as a *swayamsevak*. This is untrue. One attribute that he has never lost sight of is the strategic virtue of patience over impulsiveness. In his 12 years at the helm in Gandhinagar, he has rarely overplayed his hand. He has never been a man in a tearing hurry, even while aware of his ultimate destination.\n\nModi does not have to go begging to the BJP. Pressure from below will compel the BJP to come to him. After that, the battle for India will formally begin. Knowing Modi, he will be fighting to win. He always has.'<br />Author: 'JainMutton'  id: 'bsh39m'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bsh39m/master_of_the_national_game_narendra_modi_by/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'How competitive were the elections at state level?'<br />Body: 'We all know that BJP had a massive win at the national level. The elections were not competitive and Congress was nearly routed and once again failed to get enough seats to be official main opposition party. However at the state level the story is even more one sided.\n\nAt central level if NDA won about 65% of seats, 352/542. At state levels the wighted average percentage of seats of the most dominant party or alliance is 83.1% this time. It was 82.5% last time. That indicates that in every state one party or alliance won a vast majority of seats.\n\nThis time Bengal and Odisha were more competitive. So was Odisha. J&amp;K was same as last time and sounds competitive but it is as one sided as other states. BJP won three seats in Jammu &amp; Ladakh whereas NC won in Kashmir. Telangana was another state that was competitive. Other than that BJP swept every state except in South. In South BJP swept Karnataka, Congress and its allies TN and Kerala, and YSRCP in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nInitially I started doing this calculation because I thought contest was very one sided this elections but as it turns out it was no different in 2009.'<br />Author: 'Shriman_Ripley'  id: 'bsh14g'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bsh14g/how_competitive_were_the_elections_at_state_level/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Why most Muslims of sub-continent dislike Modi, The Hindu nationalist?'<br />Body: "1/ Thread: Why most Muslims of sub-continent dislike Modi, Hindu nationalist?\n\n\n2/ The psychological comfort level for Muslims - is living along with another co-religionist as their neighbour and not living with kuffr despite culture, food, linguistic, ethnic, race, DNA and like biological &amp; social homogeneity.\n\n\n3/ This stems from Islamic theology and practices differentiating humanity not in quality rather in belief to a particular God.\n\n\n4/ Hadith 18, 25 - is explicit in this “I have been ordered to fight against the people until…..”, thus a Muslim has to go against the grain of Islamic theology, to coexist in peace with another kuffr human.\n\n\n5/ As a result, and tragically enough most Muslims end up tolerating a corrupt, terrorist, murderer, rapist as long as they are of the same faith while exaggerating petty differences to avoid living with good kuffr. Partition of India is classic use case here.\n\n\n6/ The next best comfort level for Muslims is having a “secular” kuffr.\n\n\n7/ This is because “secular” kuffr tolerates political Islam, whitewashes crimes inspired by Islamic theology, sympathises with their incompatible traditions &amp; without asking Muslims to return favour of secularism.\n\n\n8/ This is where Modi led India is hated by most sub-continental Muslims - because Hindu nationalists refuse to accept one-way secularism. Hindu nationalists insist on either two-way and equal participation in secularism or no secularism at all.\n\n\n9/ Ask any self-proclaimed moderate/ secular Muslim to not practice conversion in marriage and you’d see how shallow their secularism turns out. Muslims are fine as long as Hindus do not wear their religion on shoulders, while themselves wearing religion from head to toe.\n\n\n10/ Among Muslims, Pakistani’s are the most hypocritical bunch.\n\n\n11/ Pakistan has institutionalised bigotry, constitutionally excludes non-Muslims from governance and tops that up with rape, intimidation and discrimination against minorities and continued antagonism with Hindu India.\n\n\n12/ But the gall at which they call India fascist for electing Modi is monumental chicanery. \n\nModi led India creates another problem for Pakistanis or anyone believing ghazwa-e-hind, that being Hindu nationalist are grounded not on western import of irreligious secularism…\n\n\n13/ …rather celebration of religion while mutually co-existing only provided the other side (non-Hindus) accepts equality in religion and laws.\n\n\n14/ Islamic theology has trouble here because it throws the “my and only god” theory into disarray and does not give easy pass to ghazwa-e-hind fantasy.\n\n\n15/ Islamic pursuit of worldwide supremacy (no less fanatical than Nazi Germany’s absurd aryan theory) had and continues to face it’s biggest and most persistent challenge in Hindu nation, both on ideological and battle grounds, and now more so with a united Hindu nation.\n\n\n16/ Hindu theology with its decentralized, diverse practices and evolving (rather sluggishly) practices with time - has overwhelmed Islamic thought and halted its growth 4 centuries ago. And continues to reclaim space, from geography to economy to intellectual pursuits.\n\n\n17/ This is why despite almost every Muslim country being constitutionally Islamic, most Muslims hate and won’t tolerate two countries practicing and so richly their own way of life and religion, namely - Jewish and Hindu nation.\n\n\n18/ Also explains why Modi - a practicing Hindu, wearing religion on his shoulder in one &amp; only Hindu country is derided.\n\n\n19/ Key point to ponder is, why micro minority Zoroastrian Parsis, Jews, Bahá'í Faith, Ahmedis, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Atheists, LGBT aren't scared of Hindu India but from pre-partition to 2019 Muslims remain insecure bunch - why?\n\nCredit: @GernailSaheb on Twitter."<br />Author: 'ZackPhrut'  id: 'bsgddt'<br />Score:47<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bsgddt/why_most_muslims_of_subcontinent_dislike_modi_the/</li>

The long oppressed bourgeois classes and the peasants were too angry to be assuaged by this and 3 years later the King and Queen both lost their heads \n\nThe current opposition and I include the Khan Market gang (thank you Modiji for this phrase) here didn’t have the prescience King Louis had, they remind me of Hitler in April 1945. Surrounded by Soviet troops, Hitler in his delusional world was convinced that he was winning\n\nHis enablers, toadies like Goebbels (Lutyens Media?) Himmler, Hans Krebs etc didn’t even bother bringing the Fuhrer down to reality. They instead enabled his delusions, promising him that his genius alone will help defeat Marshal Zhukov and his 1 million troops\n\nAnybody who said otherwise was called a traitor and summarily dismissed from service. Till the day he shot himself, Hitler believed victory was just around the corner. He died thinking he would have won IF not for a few pesky Whermacht generals who interfered with his genius\n\nOur Rahul Gandhi lived in a similar delusional world, aided and enabled actively by the ecosystem who to this day are unable to accept these results for what they are. His world view was clouded by such prurient and puerile garbage like “Rahul defeats Modi on Twitter” \n\nFrom Sept 2018 on, I counted 5 different such articles. Or how cheerleaders like The Wire, or the talking heads in NDTV all declared Modi dead, and how the economy was in coma and how the subaltern class would overwhelmingly chase out this uppity upstart and cast him into exile\n\nYou read endless opeds on how Mr Gandhi / Mamta / Maya etc represented the idea of India and how Mr Modi represented the ‘other’. The message was clear, Modi was the pretender on the throne, and the IoI was safe only when the default program, the Cong was in power in the centre\n\nOr the “Rahul is coming of age” nonsense. I counted 20, yes 20 such articles from 2010 on. So apparently Rahul Baba comes of age 2 times every year like clockwork and as in the case of the emperor who wears no clothes, they all pander to Rahul the legendary leader\n\nThey are convinced that his appellation Pappu is something the BJP IT cell made up, not realising that the average Indian, esp the average young Indian derides him as a no good talentless hack who got to where he is only because of who he is\n\nWith the numbers now clear, you realise that all these pages have aged like milk left on the terrace of a hot Chennai day, does….very poorly. Which begs the question, how did so many allegedly intelligent people misread something so epoch making?\n\nThe intelligence is what needs to be questioned because in India in general and amongst the literati and intelligentsia in particular, the ability to communicate in English is directly proportional to your intelligence\n\nThis is why air heads like Swara Bhaskar or even literary heavyweights like Arundati “Rafale carrier” Roy (no complaints on her writing here though) were given so much air time. They are disconnected from the real subaltern and indulge in what is politely called a ‘circle jerk’\n\nThey live in their own echo chambers, and as a Tambram, many in my own circle live in a similar echo chamber and it is spectacular on how delusional and disconnected they are. Anybody gainsaying them is branded a filthy Sanghi\n\nDerided for being ‘low IQ’ and if the exchange continued, it is shut down with the magic words “guamutra bhakth sanghi”. This same politically correct class would shy away from using words offensive to Jews (kike), Blacks or Muslims, but have no qualms in abusing the Hindu RW\n\nThus isolated and insulated, they crafted their own narrative on how Demonitisation caused 1000’s of deaths, and how Modi is hated by the poorest Dalits, that intolerance is rising so the fence sitters will also switch sides.\n\nArmed with this ‘knowledge’ you then got farcical analysis like the one Wire put out on UP where they took the assembly election results, added the SP + BSP voteshare, compared it with the BJP vote share and decided….Modi is done for, ggwp\n\nAnybody with even the slightest interest in Indian politics knows that vote transfer between antagonistic vote banks like Dalits, Jatavs, Yadavs and Muslims is not seamlessly done and there would be massive slips\n\nBut not these ‘intellectuals’, they were absolutely convinced of their methods and outcomes and this then was fed to the key opposition leaders which lead to even more farcial things like how Rahul Gandhi said “he destroyed Modi’s identity”, vigorous hand gesticulation included\n\nLike his handlers and advisors must have taught him and like GoT season 8, it made for a stirring thing to watch….but that was all, in reality it was shallow and lacked all substance, something May 23rd proved in spades\n\nWhat’s shocking to me personally is that, rather than submit to the defeat, after all it isn’t final – King Narasimhavarman came back from a crushing defeat to taking the Chalukyan capital. The Cholas came from being small vassals to the Pallavans to becoming a superpower\n\nSimon Bolivar lost so many times, was exiled 2 times, and yet every single time he picked up, learnt from his mistakes and fought on. Defeat is not shameful, defeat is an opportunity to pause, understand what went wrong and then fix the mistakes\n\nThe BJP itself is a shining example of that. They ran an insipid campaign in 2009, didn’t have clear campaign goals, and only vaguely aligned behind Advaniji, but it sat back, studied the mistakes it made and in 2013 itself Modi was made the PM face\n\nAnd with razor sharp focus ran a campaign that ran rings around the opposition. In 2019 though, the process began 5 years ago itself. The model was the 2004 loss, and how to avoid the mistakes Vajpayeeji made.\n\nHowever, neither the Cong nor its enabling ecosystem have the humility to accept this verdict, and the scale of it, instead of being a bucket of cold water poured on their head (no, not the ALS challenge please), it has reaffirmed their belief system\n\nIf you look at all the sour grapes messages and opeds (The Wire and Sid V leads the way again) or NDTV on May 23rd (I have been to funerals that were more cheerful) that have been pouring out, this clique is convinced that their princeling was defeated by foul means\n\nThat somehow a small minority of “savarna” Brahmins and landed elite gamed the system and deprived poor Ragul Baba, the heir of Negruji his divine right! Messrs Modiji and Shahji are laughing their way to the vote bank, because with this attitude of the opposition, they just won 2024 as well\n\nI will let that doyen of the Marxists do the talking, Gayathri Spivak once wrote (and I paraphrase from memory so don’t quote me on this), “The marginalised are the silent and silenced centre, the poorest of the poor, the illiterate peasants, the tribals and the urban sub proletariat”\n\nThe Congress, Marxists and “left Liberals” always deigned to speak on behalf of this subaltern class, the poorest of the poor, the sub proletariat, but on May 23rd, the Silent and Silenced Centre spoke, and resoundingly….in favour of Mr Modi\n\nThe mortal conflict now within the pluralis maiestatis is clear, are the subaltern that they claimed to represent (though how an anglophone, upper class Indian could ever represent the poorest of the poor is beyond me) suddenly a ‘gaumutra sipping sanghi bigot’?\n\nThe subaltern though doesn’t care, this is a vote, a vote for hope, a vote that rejects the status quo ante of Nehruvian secularism and most importantly a vote against the same dynasts and elite who claim to be their voice. \n\nThe message is clear, ‘don’t give us homilies and slogans’, give us roads, electricity, toilets, doles without the commission and let us build our own lives.

Back then most other parties had no presence on SM at all\n\nIn the last 5 years, all the other parties have build up social media reputation. But instead of using it to spread agenda of development, they choose to cry, rant, create negative propaganda about Modi and spread lies. \n\nAll the fake news such as Rafale, Chowkidar Chor Hai , and serial spammers like The Wire, Dhruv Tattee, Kunal Kamra have been exposed badly by the people. The electorate aren\'t as dumb as these clowns want them to believe. Truth cannot be suppressed in the age of social media. \n\nNarratives like "Muslims are in threat" also have had no takers. Muslims are as safe as they ever were. People have answered comprehensively. \n\nBut instead of introspecting, the idiots are still sticking to spreading lies, spreading more hate about Modi, publishing more hateful articles. If they never learn, the country will never have an opposition. \n\nBottom line : BJP social media clout is impressive. On the other hand, opponents have failed to understand social media. Simply spreading propaganda will not get you anywhere, when the propaganda gets debunked within 10 minutes on twitter/fb etc. \n\n**MainBhiChowkidar campaign will go down in social media history as legendary**, and will be analysed by political observers worldwide for its impact in bringing together supporters and debunking fakenews and lies spread by partisan media in cohorts with opponents.'<br />Author: 'Altruistic__77'  id: 'bs01g4'<br />Score:113<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bs01g4/big_verdict_for_all_the_pessimists_who_thought/</li>

It is still a repeated victim of Islamic terrorism and communist Naxal strife. \n\n\nEven post-Independence, decades of failed Nehruvian socialism and Soviet intellectual and political influencing only weakened our resolve by perpetuating identity politics for securing their votebank while delivering disastrous economic growth. \n\nWe never went through a proper cultural de-colonization post-independence to restore a healthy national identity while retaining the respect for diversity. And Hindutva is a long-delayed, but much-needed movement towards normalizing an identity purely based on national interests over religious,caste and sectarian differences in the populace."<br />Author: 'karmache'  id: 'bryzss'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bryzss/decoding_the_essence_of_hindutva_going_beyond_the/</li>

Such is also the case of innumerable devotees and temple priests who believe that one day the deities will abandon their abode in Puri and come to Chhatia, according to Malika, a prophecy by saint Achyutananda Das.\n\nAccording to his prophecy, Puri will be submerged by the sea due to global warming and subsequent rise in water level. Achyutananda Das had predicted the arrival of the trinity to Chhatia after the sea engulfs the holy town.\n\n“His prediction in his Malika about the 1866 great famine, 1999 super cyclone, heat wave for the last couple of years due to global warming and other major events in the country have come true,” said Malika researcher Bibhutibhusan Pal.\n\nThe 15th century saint in his famous book Udhhab Bhakti Pradayani had written that one day Lord Jagannath will leave His Puri and live in Chhatia town, said Pal.\n\nThe Ananta Gopal temple is regarded as the second abode of Lord Jagannath after Puri. The devotees claim that Lord Jagannath will return to Chhatia along with His brother and sister some day. Keeping His ‘return’ in mind, construction work is going on in the temple.\n\nSince the people believe that the Lord would return any day, construction work at the temple never stops. The decks are being constantly cleared for the Lord’s return.\n\n“Regular construction work is a tradition of the temple as the Lord will come here some day. The construction work in Chhatia temple will stop only when the trinity returns,” said Pradyumna Kumar Das, one of the priests of the temple.\n\nEveryday, priests worship in front of the empty pedestal of the temple in the sanctum sanctorum with the hope that Lord Jagannath will arrive here one day.'<br />Author: 'Alt_Center_0'  id: 'brnt8d'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/brnt8d/chhatia_waits_for_his_arrival/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Orwell beautifully explains the disdain for India by western socialists claiming to be anti-imperialists.'<br />Body: "\n\nTake the question of imperialism, for instance. Every left-wing 'intellectual' is, as a matter of course, an anti-imperialist. He claims to be outside the empire-racket as automatically and self-righteously as he claims to be outside the class-racket. Even the right-wing 'intellectual', who is not definitely in revolt against British imperialism, pretends to regard it with a sort of amused detachment. It is so easy to be witty about the British Empire. The White Man's Burden and 'Rule, Britannia' and Kipling's novels and Anglo-Indian bores – who could even mention such things without a snigger? And is there any cultured person who has not at least once in his life made a joke about that old Indian havildar who said that if the British left India there would not be a rupee or a virgin left between Peshawar and Delhi (or wherever it was)? That is the attitude of the typical left-winger towards imperialism, and a thoroughly flabby, boneless attitude it is. For in the last resort, the only important question is. Do you want the British Empire to hold together or do you want it to disintegrate? And at the bottom of his heart no Englishman, least of all the kind of person who is witty about Anglo-Indian colonels, does want it to disintegrate. For, apart from any other consideration, the high standard of life we enjoy in England depends upon our keeping a tight hold on the Empire, particularly the tropical portions of it such as India and Africa. Under the capitalist system, in order that England may live in comparative comfort, a hundred million Indians must live on the verge of starvation – an evil state of affairs, but you acquiesce in it every time you step into a taxi or eat a plate of strawberries and cream. The alternative is to throw the Empire overboard and reduce England to a cold and unimportant little island where we should all have to work very hard and live mainly on herrings and potatoes. That is the very last thing that any left-winger wants. Yet the left-winger continues to feel that he has no moral responsibility for imperialism. He is perfectly ready to accept the products of Empire and to save his soul by sneering at the people who hold the Empire together."<br />Author: 'nathuram-godse'  id: 'brl2ud'<br />Score:57<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/brl2ud/orwell_beautifully_explains_the_disdain_for_india/</li>

Little did we know the voter of 2019 is glued to the tv sets. This voter has now voted in the numbers of over 8 crores (new first time voter ) who has gotten  influenced by modi mania years ago. This trend continues. \n\n2013 end , congress introduces DBT or direct benefit transfer but fails to implement it in its tenure. Modi announces pm jdy the ultimate game changer on 15th August 2014. Jan dhan faces stiff opposition from banks countrywide. Modi forces it down their throat. He pushes for 58 crore bank account with over 99 thousand crore in deposit in 2019. DBT begins and 2011 survey is applied and money goes without leakages straight to common man. He then starts his populist schemes and notes down the beneficiaries which he would use in 2019. Bjp gained a vote share of 31% of total people voted and 17 crore votes. Bjp aims at increasing this number. The number of beneficiaries reach 21 crores in 2019 . All these people are voters who got direct benefit one way or other from bjp government. \n\nBjp focussed on the votes of women which was had a difference of 9% in 2009 to 1.5% in 2014 to 0.4% in 2019. Needless to say women voter came out in huge numbers. Earlier women voters were accompanied by their family but as the polling data has shown these have come out in groups with their friends or as a single individual decisively to vote. Triple talak, fast track courts for women are also contributing factor in pushing the bjp vote engine ahead. It also made a dent in muslim vote bank. \n\nBjp did not give advertisement in print television media etc as it did in 2014.it did something very precise. It gave print interview to most of the regional papers which cater to specific reader of the papers . For example he gave interview to sakal, pudhari which are \nknown in maharashtra but unknown in msm . These created an opinion of modi among people. \n\nHe craftily used his election rallies only at places which faced election in the relevant phase of election and kept changing the narrative as it progressed. From balakot strikes in jat land to rajiv gandhi in sikh land . He even managed the media on the final phase to give out specific photos of him to bait liberandus to outrage , meme and basically make fun of pm in bad taste which received backlash from people who felt it was an attack not on pm but on them.

In 2011, four children from the Sandipani Muni School, a school started by Oberoi’s foundation in Vrindavan, went on an educational exchange programme to The Discovery Academy in the UK.\n\nOther initiatives: \n\n&gt; Oberoi also started “Set Beautiful Free”, an initiative under ONE to provide shelter and education to children of sex workers from Mumbai’s Kamathipura area.\n\n&gt; He has also been associated with Banyan, an organisation that looks into the rehabilitation of homeless women with mental illness.\n\n\nSource: Even a libtard pandering blog singing about him: https://www.scoopwhoop.com/vivek-oberoi-charity-work/#.6gs9r2ct7\n\n\n\nHe also did lot of work after Tsunami in rehabilitating the people affected by it. \n\nSo all you idiot feminists blaming him now, if you have done less than him, you deserve to be shamed for being empty shell feminists whose only talent is raging on social media.

      <li>Title::: 'A very brief history of Indian politics divided into four eras based on some basic features.'<br />Body: '**Congress-Nehru-Gandhi Era (1952-1975)**\n\nThis was the era of one party rule in the early days of republic. To an extent it was defined by two personalities. Congress was still the party that led the independence movement and many stalwarts were still members of the party. There was little to no pan India opposition and it was unorganized to a large extent. The opposition was mainly composed of left parties and other small interest groups like farmers or erstwhile rulers of princely states. Often serious challenges were issued by former members of the party who left to start their own movement. This era can be further divided into two parts. \n\nNehru Era- Immediately after the formation of republic lead by first ever Prime Minister of India. The elections were smooth sailing for Congress as they won a vast majority, close to three-fourths, of the seats. However, the credit for those victories would go to pre independence congress and their nationwide infrastructure that was unmatchable for any other political front. This came to end with death of Nehru and a two year stint by Sastri as Prime Minister of India.\n\nIndira Era- This era was defined by cult of personality, much more than Nehru’s. Most of the stalwarts of the freedom movement were dead or retired. Those in active politics were unhappy with Indira and went their own way. However, she maintained an iron grip on power by various methods. She removed any semblance of inner party democracy in what was still the largest and only party in the country to have ever ruled. She supported a different candidate than what party decided in presidential election and then broke the party. \n\nThis era started seeing the birth of regional parties in TN, AP, Kerala etc. Bharatiya Jana Sangh, precursor to today’s BJP, remained a regional party for all practical purposes. Indira era as well as the era of one party rule ended in 1977 after a brief interlude of dictatorship.\n\n**Post emergency era (1977—89)** This was an era where Indian public was still unsure about how to go about being a democracy. Post emergency anger saw Janata Party, which was a collection disparate political ideologies united by opposition to emergency, storm to power. The government did not last as could be expected from such a motley crew. Indira Gandhi returned to power as the public completely forgave her in 1980. Voters further surprised everyone by delivering a massive victory to Rajiv Gandhi in a sympathy wave after assassination of Indira Gandhi. After a brief non congress rule India returned to single party rule with decisive victories for Congress.\n\nLocal parties were mushrooming everywhere. BJP was born after demise of Janata party. They were irrelevant but the foundation for another pan India party was laid.\n\n*The era of coalition politics (1989-2014)*- This era saw a maturing of Indian politics and rise of BJP leading due to a bipolar nature of National polity. This cane be further divided into two parts.\n\nThe fractured mandates (1989-1999)- It certainly was a concerning time for political scientists as the country saw 5 elections in 10 years with 3 in 3 years between 96 and 99. From 1991-96 Congress ran a government through a full term but it was a minority government and PVN was only able to hold onto power through horse trading. India had 7 prime ministers through these ten years. There was no stability and the government was always on tenterhooks. Any day could have brought in a new government and it happened very often. towards end of 90s there were regular talks of adapting a presidential form of government to provide stability.\n\nIn 89 elections both BJP and JD emerged as National parties, but without a genuine pan India presence. Janata Dal however was another experiment like Janata party and hence had very limited future as a National party. BJP on the other hand was united by a common ideology and leader in Vajpayee. In 1991 BJP became the first non congress party to win more than 20% of votes in a general election. First if discounting Janata Party in 1977 which was more of a coalition. Apart from north and west they also won few seats in Assam, AP and Karnataka. They emerged as single largest party for the first time in 1996. However, congress continued to be the party with most votes due to its pan India presence.\n\n**Stable two-coalition era (1999-2014)**- It was in these years when Indian democracy finally came of age. There were two major parties with near pan India presence or allies in states where they were weak. Most of the regional parties except left coalesced around these two parties to form their own coalition. The first such coalition was National democratic alliance with BJP at head. The other was UPA with congress at head. For the first time since 70s India saw regular elections after five years. However, Congress continued to be the single largest party in terms of vote share.\n\n**Modi Era (2014- Present)** It is too early to call it Modi era but I will use it for want of a better name. For the first time since 1984 India had a party with majority in LS. They still ran a coalition government but for all practical purposes it was BJPs. 2014 saw two first. For the first time ever BJP was the biggest party in terms of vote share. Also for the first time, including 1977, Congress went below 20% in the terms of vote share. If exit polls hold true on 23rd it might truly be considered Modi era. This might last longer and other leaders may emerge. But one thing is clear. The politics from 2014 is very different compared to what it was before. Even during NDA rule of 98-04 Congress was the major presence in the country. It isn’t so anymore. Even in the smaller North Eastern states they have been trounced by BJP. It is a return to cult of personality with election being fought for and against Modi. It is to be seen how it will pan out.'<br />Author: 'Shriman_Ripley'  id: 'br5fxm'<br />Score:64<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/br5fxm/a_very_brief_history_of_indian_politics_divided/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Arundhati Roy and Romila Thapar are 100% CORRECT. India is dying. HERE'S WHY."<br />Body: 'We are familiar with the comments made by our english-speaking intellectuals in the western media. If not, inform yourself by reading the links:\n\n [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bq2w50/indias\\_top\\_historian\\_romila\\_thapar\\_just\\_wrote\\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bq2w50/indias_top_historian_romila_thapar_just_wrote_an/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bq47zh/india\\_is\\_fighting\\_for\\_her\\_soul\\_arundhati\\_roy\\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bq47zh/india_is_fighting_for_her_soul_arundhati_roy_on/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, the gist of what they are saying is: \n\nBJP is re-defining India. In the process, they\'re killing India. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I agree with them. India is dying. Arundhati Roy\'s claim of "India fighting for her soul" is absolutely spot on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere\'s why they are right. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe India they refer to, was founded in 1947. \n\nThis independent India was conceived of by the British. Independence conceived by a consensus between colonizer and colonized. It was built on western institutions: namely, british parliamentary democracy, british common law, some vague british inspired ideas of egalitarian "secularism", and a constitution that\'s not far removed from the system of governance we see all across the "Anglosphere" (or former colonies of the British empire). \n\nThis India, is one in which an Anglicized, english-speaking, western-oriented elite replaced the devout brahmin at the top of the hierarchy. This India entrenched caste and religion into law. This India gave a legitimacy to the ideas of muslims and hindus being "separate", of Islam being native to the subcontinent\'s current heritage, of India being an amalgamation of different invaders. An India, that HAD to be broken to create a Pakistan. \n\nThis India, totally fragmented - and only held together by western thought - built specifically not to threaten Western interests. A democratic and western-oriented India, one that would be an ally, never a rival. An India built specifically to produce statements like these: [https://twitter.com/David\\_Cameron/status/664827729922138112](https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/status/664827729922138112) An India built as part of trans-atlantic union of democracies: [https://www.fairobserver.com/region/north\\_america/two-largest-democracies-world/](https://www.fairobserver.com/region/north_america/two-largest-democracies-world/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFollowing this, not surprisingly, a westerner will tell Indians to be grateful for colonialism, because "that\'s how we gave you democracy!". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHIS is the India - the one built by the west, and for the west - that is DYING. THIS is the India that elevated our wonderful, english speaking intellectuals to a position of prominence. And when our wonderful, english-speaking intellectuals tell the world it\'s dying - they\'re referring not ONLY to THAT particular India, but also to themselves. \n\nPolitical ideologies - much like human beings - don\'t live forever. They have a life-span, just like anything else in nature. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo they are right. India is dying. Arundhati Roy is dying. Romila Thapar is dying.

He is being challenged by Congress' Ajay Rai and Mahagathbandhan's Shalini Yadav. Yadav is contesting on a Samajwadi Party (SP) ticket and has the backing of BSP and the RLD.\n\n* **Gorakhpur**\n\nYogi Adityanath had polled 54.6 percent votes and won the seat with a margin of over 3 lakh votes.

However, there had been a shift of power from BJP to Congress in many of the Assembly segments in these constituencies after the Assembly election in 2018.\n\n* **Indore**\n\nIndore has traditionally been a BJP seat for the last three decades, with Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan as the MP from 1989. But this time the party has given the ticket to Shankar Lalwani as Mahajan herself announced that she wouldn’t contest.\n\n* **Mandsaur**\n\nThough the BJP lost the Assembly election in Madhya Pradesh, it won three of the four assembly seats in Mandsaur district and Congress got one. BJP has fielded its sitting MP Sudhir Gupta and Congress has given a ticket to former MP Meenakshi Natrajan, who had won in 2009 but lost in 2014.\n\n# Bihar \n\n* **Patna Sahib**\n\nActor-politician Shatrughan Sinha will be seen contesting against union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad from here. Sinha had won this seat for the BJP in both 2009 and 2014. Sinha left the BJP after years of uneasy relationship with the party high command. In this election he is contesting on a Congress ticket.

He was first time elected in 1980, and since then, Soren has won from Dumka eight times and lost thrice.\n\n* **Godda**\n\nIt's a contentious fight between the Congress and BJP.

It is this seat that kickstarted Banerjee’s political career after she defeated sitting MP and former Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee in 1984.\n\nIn the state, the Jadavpur seat is a high-profile one that Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee and TMC Chief Mamata Banerjee have held.

      <li>Title::: "Godse's last speech"<br />Body: 'Born in a devotional Brahmin family, I instinctively came to revere Hindu religion, Hindu history and Hindu culture. I had, therefore, been intensely proud of Hinduism as a whole. As I grew up I developed a tendency to free thinking unfettered by any superstitious allegiance to any isms, political or religious. That is why I worked actively for the eradication of untouchability and the caste system based on birth alone. I openly joined RSS wing of anti-caste movements and maintained that all Hindus were of equal status as to rights, social and religious and should be considered high or low on merit alone and not through the accident of birth in a particular caste or profession.\n\nI used publicly to take part in organized anti-caste dinners in which thousands of Hindus, Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, Chamars and Bhangis participated. We broke the caste rules and dined in the company of each other. I have read the speeches and writings of Ravana, Chanakiya, Dadabhai Naoroji, Vivekanand, Gokhale, Tilak, along with the books of ancient and modern history of India and some prominent countries like England , France , America and Russia . Moreover I studied the tenets of Socialism and Marxism. But above all I studied very closely whatever Veer Savarkar and Gandhiji had written and spoken, as to my mind these two ideologies have contributed more to the moulding of the thought and action of the Indian people during the last thirty years or so, than any other single factor has done.\n\nAll this reading and thinking led me to believe it was my first duty to serve Hindudom and Hindus both as a patriot and as a world citizen. To secure the freedom and to safeguard the just interests of some thirty crores (300 million) of Hindus would automatically constitute the freedom and the well-being of all India , one fifth of human race. This conviction led me naturally to devote myself to the Hindu Sanghtanist ideology and programme, which alone, I came to believe, could win and preserve the national independence of Hindustan , my Motherland, and enable her to render true service to humanity as well.\n\nSince the year 1920, that is, after the demise of Lokamanya Tilak, Gandhiji’s influence in the Congress first increased and then became supreme. His activities for public awakening were phenomenal in their intensity and were reinforced by the slogan of truth and non-violence which he paraded ostentatiously before the country. No sensible or enlightened person could object to those slogans. In fact there is nothing new or original in them.. They are implicit in every constitutional public movement. But it is nothing but a mere dream if you imagine that the bulk of mankind is, or can ever become, capable of scrupulous adherence to these lofty principles in its normal life from day to day.\n\nIn fact, honour, duty and love of one’s own kith and kin and country might often compel us to disregard non-violence and to use force. I could never conceive that an armed resistance to an aggression is unjust. I would consider it a religious and moral duty to resist and, if possible, to overpower such an enemy by use of force. [In the Ramayana] Rama killed Ravana in a tumultuous fight and relieved Sita.. [In the Mahabharata], Krishna killed Kansa to end his wickedness; and Arjuna had to fight and slay quite a number of his friends and relations including the revered Bhishma because the latter was on the side of the aggressor. It is my firm belief that in dubbing Rama, Krishna and Arjuna as guilty of violence, the Mahatma betrayed a total ignorance of the springs of human action.\nIn more recent history, it was the heroic fight put up by Chhatrapati Shivaji that first checked and eventually destroyed the Muslim tyranny in India . It was absolutely essentially for Shivaji to overpower and kill an aggressive Afzal Khan, failing which he would have lost his own life. In condemning history’s towering warriors like Shivaji, Rana Pratap and Guru Gobind Singh as misguided patriots, Gandhiji has merely exposed his self-conceit. He was, paradoxical as it may appear, a violent pacifist who brought untold calamities on the country in the name of truth and non-violence, while Rana Pratap, Shivaji and the Guru will remain enshrined in the hearts of their countrymen for ever for the freedom they brought to them.\n\nThe accumulating provocation of thirty-two years, culminating in his last pro-Muslim fast, at last goaded me to the conclusion that the existence of Gandhi should be brought to an end immediately. Gandhi had done very good in South Africa to uphold the rights and well-being of the Indian community there. But when he finally returned to India he developed a subjective mentality under which he alone was to be the final judge of what was right or wrong. If the country wanted his leadership, it had to accept his infallibility; if it did not, he would stand aloof from the Congress and carry on his own way.\n\nAgainst such an attitude there can be no halfway house. Either Congress had to surrender its will to his and had to be content with playing second fiddle to all his eccentricity, whimsicality, metaphysics and primitive vision, or it had to carry on without him. He alone was the Judge of everyone and every thing; he was the master brain guiding the civil disobedience movement; no other could know the technique of that movement. He alone knew when to begin and when to withdraw it. The movement might succeed or fail, it might bring untold disaster and political reverses but that could make no difference to the Mahatma’s infallibility. ‘A Satyagrahi can never fail’ was his formula for declaring his own infallibility and nobody except himself knew what a Satyagrahi is. Thus, the Mahatma became the judge and jury in his own cause. These childish insanities and obstinacies, coupled with a most severe austerity of life, ceaseless work and lofty character made Gandhi formidable and irresistible.\n\nMany people thought that his politics were irrational but they had either to withdraw from the Congress or place their intelligence at his feet to do with as he liked. In a position of such absolute irresponsibility Gandhi was guilty of blunder after blunder, failure after failure, disaster after disaster. Gandhi’s pro-Muslim policy is blatantly in his perverse attitude on the question of the national language of India . It is quite obvious that Hindi has the most prior claim to be accepted as the premier language. In the beginning of his career in India , Gandhi gave a great impetus to Hindi but as he found that the Muslims did not like it, he became a champion of what is called Hindustani.. Everybody in India knows that there is no language called Hindustani; it has no grammar; it has no vocabulary. It is a mere dialect, it is spoken, but not written. It is a bastard tongue and cross-breed between Hindi and Urdu, and not even the Mahatma’s sophistry could make it popular. But in his desire to please the Muslims he insisted that Hindustani alone should be the national language of India . His blind followers, of course, supported him and the so-called hybrid language began to be used. The charm and purity of the Hindi language was to be prostituted to please the Muslims. All his experiments were at the expense of the Hindus.\n\nFrom August 1946 onwards the private armies of the Muslim League began a massacre of the Hindus. The then Viceroy, Lord Wavell, though distressed at what was happening, would not use his powers under the Government of India Act of 1935 to prevent the rape, murder and arson. The Hindu blood began to flow from Bengal to Karachi with some retaliation by the Hindus. The Interim Government formed in September was sabotaged by its Muslim League members right from its inception, but the more they became disloyal and treasonable to the government of which they were a part, the greater was Gandhi’s infatuation for them. Lord Wavell had to resign as he could not bring about a settlement and he was succeeded by Lord Mountbatten. King Log was followed by King Stork. The Congress which had boasted of its nationalism and socialism secretly accepted Pakistan literally at the point of the bayonet and abjectly surrendered to Jinnah. India was vivisected and one-third of the Indian territory became foreign land to us from August 15, 1947.\n\nLord Mountbatten came to be described in Congress circles as the greatest Viceroy and Governor-General this country ever had. The official date for handing over power was fixed for June 30, 1948, but Mountbatten with his ruthless surgery gave us a gift of vivisected India ten months in advance. This is what Gandhi had achieved after thirty years of undisputed dictatorship and this is what Congress party calls ‘freedom’ and ‘peaceful transfer of power’. The Hindu-Muslim unity bubble was finally burst and a theocratic state was established with the consent of Nehru and his crowd and they have called ‘freedom won by them with sacrifice’ – whose sacrifice? When top leaders of Congress, with the consent of Gandhi, divided and tore the country – which we consider a deity of worship – my mind was filled with direful anger.\n\nOne of the conditions imposed by Gandhi for his breaking of the fast unto death related to the mosques in Delhi occupied by the Hindu refugees. But when Hindus in Pakistan were subjected to violent attacks he did not so much as utter a single word to protest and censure the Pakistan Government or the Muslims concerned. Gandhi was shrewd enough to know that while undertaking a fast unto death, had he imposed for its break some condition on the Muslims in Pakistan , there would have been found hardly any Muslims who could have shown some grief if the fast had ended in his death. It was for this reason that he purposely avoided imposing any condition on the Muslims. He was fully aware of from the experience that Jinnah was not at all perturbed or influenced by his fast and the Muslim League hardly attached any value to the inner voice of Gandhi.\n\nGandhi is being referred to as the Father of the Nation. But if that is so, he had failed his paternal duty inasmuch as he has acted very treacherously to the nation by his consenting to the partitioning of it. I stoutly maintain that Gandhi has failed in his duty. He has proved to be the Father of Pakistan. His inner-voice, his spiritual power and his doctrine of non-violence of which so much is made of, all crumbled before Jinnah’s iron will and proved to be powerless. Briefly speaking, I thought to myself and foresaw I shall be totally ruined, and the only thing I could expect from the people would be nothing but hatred and that I shall have lost all my honour, even more valuable than my life, if I were to kill Gandhiji. But at the same time I felt that the Indian politics in the absence of Gandhiji would surely be proved practical, able to retaliate, and would be powerful with armed forces. No doubt, my own future would be totally ruined, but the nation would be saved from the inroads of Pakistan . People may even call me and dub me as devoid of any sense or foolish, but the nation would be free to follow the course founded on the reason which I consider to be necessary for sound nation-building.\n\nAfter having fully considered the question, I took the final decision in the matter, but I did not speak about it to anyone whatsoever. I took courage in both my hands and I did fire the shots at Gandhiji on 30th January 1948, on the prayer-grounds of Birla House. I do say that my shots were fired at the person whose policy and action had brought rack and ruin and destruction to millions of Hindus. There was no legal machinery by which such an offender could be brought to book and for this reason I fired those fatal shots. I bear no ill will towards anyone individually but I do say that I had no respect for the present government owing to their policy which was unfairly favourable towards the Muslims. But at the same time I could clearly see that the policy was entirely due to the presence of Gandhi.\n\nI have to say with great regret that Prime Minister Nehru quite forgets that his preachings and deeds are at times at variances with each other when he talks about India as a secular state in season and out of season, because it is significant to note that Nehru has played a leading role in the establishment of the theocratic state of Pakistan, and his job was made easier by Gandhi’s persistent policy of appeasement towards the Muslims. I now stand before the court to accept the full share of my responsibility for what I have done and the judge would, of course, pass against me such orders of sentence as may be considered proper. But I would like to add that I do not desire any mercy to be shown to me, nor do I wish that anyone else should beg for mercy on my behalf. My confidence about the moral side of my action has not been shaken even by the criticism levelled against it on all sides. I have no doubt that honest writers of history will weigh my act and find the true value thereof some day in future.'<br />Author: 'nathuram-godse'  id: 'bq1fpr'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bq1fpr/godses_last_speech/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'A Message to all Redditors of Kolkata'<br />Body: "It's not the buildings, the roads, the bridges &amp; other concrete that make a city what it is, but the people inhabiting it. Hence, my dearest peers, knowing this city to be their home, lend me your ears.\n\nThese are dark times that we're going through. Violence. Oppression. Racism. You name it and it's what we experience, ad nauseam. Change is needed. We need it — we demand it; and this being the season of ballot boxes &amp; EVMs, we yearn to vote to that end. 'Tis here, I beg to differ and ask: is it really a considerable choice when we're given to choose our predators, between lions, tigers and wolves? Yes, one of them is way worse than the others &amp; needs to be gone for everyone's good; but is empowering the other murderers any better?\n\nFor as long as I remember, our lives have been spent as slaves &amp; serfs to these powers: the fools, bigots &amp; goons, called politicians we elect into leaders, the banks, capitalists &amp; industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other, caught in their barbaric game of tag, in which we're all 'it' in the end. I want to change all of that; don't you?\n\nThey say, everything big, starts small. Hence, in a world of 7.6 billion, would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million, prided so much for its openness, liberalism &amp; intellegentia? Kolkata is OUR CITY: OUR COMMONS, OUR HOME, enclosed by bigots &amp; greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life, especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday, hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen, called money, required of us all to exist. This is no longer a city, but a corporate heath, bearing concrete in place of vegetation.\n\nI yearn of you, hence, let's not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect, which fiction we wish to pray to and so on, but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable, homely, liveable, post partisanism, post market, post capitalist and really smart, not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi, that the oligarchs deem smart. Let us build, on this pyre of yesterdays' failures, a new city that truly would shower joy on all.\n\nConsidering today's problems, my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands, as our commons, manage it so, and make it thrive, not grow exponentially. Of course, when I say take back, I don't ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat, but establishment of mutual-aid-networks &amp; P2P Commoning practices, with each of our houses, condos, etc. being its reliable nodes. It is impossible to build such a space using current structures, such as the market (a network where people paywall goods &amp; services to exploit each other &amp; accumulate capital) or the state, with its systemic biases of race, religion, etc., the NGO circus standing on Corporate Social Responsibility Grants, acting as band-aids distributed by those that machine gun us, and other top-down, vertical (hierarchical) institutions. Therefore let's start here, as the Kolkata Commons Collective, a mutual-aid-network, where we organize ourselves horizontally, as equals, and work hard to produce, maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoy.\n\nIn case you think my beliefs to be Utopian and my ideas too lofty, the same was &amp; still is thought of the knowledge commons: Wikipedia, the numerous thriving Wikis, Free &amp; Open Source Software, especially Linux, which powers apart from the desktops of a few of us, the entire internet, all supercomputers, most phones (Android, Sailfish, Tizen), Open Source Hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RISC V, the Wikispeed car, FOSMC bike, 3D Printers, Open Designs, Creative Commons works, Theatre Commons grouups, Cities like Seoul, Barcelona, Brussels, etc., the hackerspaces &amp; real makerspaces (anarchist, non-profit, commons oriented ones, unlike the corporate, for-profit open washes of science museums &amp; technical schools) coming up around the world, etc., and many more. The big question is, whether we continue our banal, servile, practically cannibalistic ways, being skeptical of our capabilities, or pitch in to prove the market-worshiping, orthodox, skeptics wrong, to liberate ourselves and eveyone else?\n\n[Here's a nice introduction to the Commons](https://youtu.be/nsRFdBBOyzU?t=155).\n\nIn case you wonder what are these commons I so talk about, feel free to check this [6-minutes' short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_pRS9167vk) or [24-minutes' long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cKrcQ30518) explanations.\n\nIf you so happen to think everything is fine &amp; will be fine, [here's also a little something for you to consider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX3M8Ka9vUA).\n\nIf you wish to binge a bit more, check out [how &amp; why the City should be a Commons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3itmhDuem8) or [a summary of commoning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ake8u8tpR5U).\n\nAfter that of course, let us please network &amp; work! Here are some of my proposals — a list to which you're more than welcome to add, via comments maybe.\n\nProposals:—\n\n* Localizing our physical, economic circuits to reduce the ecological footprint &amp; make the city resilient to calamities, both natural &amp; artificial. The media may be glorifying Orissa on its disaster management, since Fani hit, but let's remember that huge sectors of the state are still dead, without electricity, water, etc. since being dependent on a centralized power grid system, they've no recourse but wait for the long electrical and other circuits to be connected again become functional again.\n* So noting the above, creating, improving &amp; sharing our own version of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/)'s [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/), and establishing a network of [Hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org/) to start manufacturing [Glocally](https://youtu.be/9ncEDQuO27s) (doing the light things globally and the heavy things locally), to aid us.\n* Running a web of [SOLEs (Self Organized Learning Environments)](https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/) to aid our education.\n* Creating a distributed internet based on meshnet technology, using the [ESP8266](http://esp8266.net/) and similar Open Source Wireless microchips, protocols like [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) like systems, etc., to free our dependence on centralized, paid, private connection providers  we use to access the WWW and communicate. So think distributed web with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) &amp; [dat](https://datproject.org/) protocols, along with garlic routed, P2P VoIP, accessible &amp; managed as a common, without any central authority or monetary barriers.\n* Manufacturing &amp; distribution of basic phones similar to the [WiPhone](http://a.wiphone.io/), to inhabitants who require it, and much, much later, a fully Open Source, [RISC V](https://riscv.org/) based smartphone running [Android ROM](https://source.android.com/)s or [GNU/Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) with touch friendly UIs.\n* Establishing a real, public transport system using car-sharing algorithms (Real Sharing and not Uber/Ola/Lyft/.../'s share washed micro-lending economy) to share the leftover seating &amp; storage spaces on our existing Cars, converting our petrol &amp; diesel drinkers to sustainable, local sources, such as electric, via renewables like solar, wind, hydro, etc., collecting, scavenging &amp; hacking the abandonned vehicles, lying on randomly on roads, especially around Police Stations to aid these ventures, producing, distributing &amp; evolving the [WikiSpeed](http://wikispeed.org/), [OSCAR](http://www.theoscarproject.org/), [OpenMotors](https://www.openmotors.co/)' [Tabby](https://www.openmotors.co/tabbyevo/), [FOSMC](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/fosmc), &amp; other platforms, and connecting them as a Transport Commons for everyone to enjoy.\n* Running networks of [submersiles](https://www.openrov.com/), [solar powered](https://solarimpulse.com/), [lightweight](http://ligeti-stratos.com/index.html) [aircraft](http://makerplane.org/) &amp; [low altitude satellite systems](https://libre.space/), to physically reach greater distances without having to go through state regulations and corporate pay walling.\n* Establishing distributed power-grids, using solar, wind and other available, sustainable technology, to escape our dependence on the Power Corps.\n* Movement to Open Source platforms, as opposed to proprietary, private ones to remove our dependence on Corps. For instance, moving from MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, etc. to GNU/Linux distros, FreeBSD forks, etc.\n* Nurturing Open Source Communities, to voluntarily labour to help develop the global Open Source pool and other Commons\n* Creating a [network](https://farm.bot/) of Vertical Farms, Aeroponic Gardens, Aquaponic Greenhouses, and so on to [produce](http://farmhack.org/tools) Food Commons for us all, networking into a post-market, moneyless ecosystem using the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/).\n* Creating a network of sustainable [water](http://www.freewat.eu/) cycles to provide potable, [fresh water commons](http://openwaterfoundation.org/).\n* Providing universal healthcare as a commons, producing [Open Source medicines](http://www.opensourcepharma.net/) &amp; [medical equipment](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/30/making-the-case-for-open-source-medical-devices/), in our mesh of [bio-hackerspaces](https://biohack.me/), [while also](http://openbci.com/) [extending our human bodies](https://openprosthetics.org/)' capabilities through transhumanist practices and sustaining a thriving grinding (biohacking) culture in the city.\n* Hacking our prodigal buildings to make them [more comfortable, effective &amp; efficient](https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/), connecting everything with DiY Open Source IoT systems.\n* Nurturing a thriving pro-science, DiY, hacker/maker culture in our city along with aiding education in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts &amp; Mathematics) and the humanities in their advanced forms ... the list goes on.\n* And finally, scaling to the suburbs and villages of West Bengal, and even other cities in other states, connecting Kolkata to the global commons movement, and making ourselves visible on the global map, to help liberate the world."<br />Author: 'arkoprovo1996'  id: 'bq0ysa'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bq0ysa/a_message_to_all_redditors_of_kolkata/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How Gandhi murdered democracy-Tripuri session of the Cong 1939'<br />Body: 'He held all the levers of power. All of it. He was frail physically but man definitely played the Game of Thrones and was a shrewd machinator. \n\nThink about it, he held the post of INC president only once, in 1922 iirc and yet wielded immense and near total power over it. \n\nTake the INC Tripuri session of 1939, S C Bose was extremely popular in his own right, Gandhi hated him, pushed Nehru to announce his candidature but Nehru said no (we don\'t know why he said no), the consensus candidate was Dr Sitharamaya. The good doctor lost and S C Bose won a clear majority. \n\nby the INC Constitution he was to be INC president right? Wrong. Gandhi saw this as a personal affront. At this point the INC Constitution didn\'t have any means of oustering an elected president so this evil old Chankyan simply packed the working committee with his chamchas. S C Bose was neutralised and a leader only in name. Let me give you two quotes of Gandhi on the same topic to show how duplicitous he really was. \n\nWhen Bose won the election, he basically said "this is my defeat and the defeat of the principles of my candidate, Bose won fairly and this is his victory and we support him"\n\nPrivately he told M N Roy that,  "there would be non cooperation inside the Cong, and as head of the Cong there is no room for Bose and those who supported his election and he must go"\n\nI paraphrase here from memory. \n\nS C Bose then fell ill before a session of the CWC, as leader of the party he wrote a polite letter requesting that the meeting be postponed (a fair request really), Gandhi saw an opening, he had his chamchas raise the cry that this was proof Bose was dictatorial, Bose ever the short tempered man fell into his trap, called the CWC a bunch of low IQ individuals and this was the break Gandhi wanted and had engineered. Even before this, K M Munshi spread lies to Gandhi about Bose, a meeting of Bose with German businessmen in Mumbai was reported as a meeting with the German consul as a step to ally with the Nazis. \n\nThe CWC wanted Bose to resign, he asked them to fuck off, this prompted the seniormost members of the CWC to resign, in fact all except Nehru aaand Sarat Bose resigned iirc. Fearing a crisis, Bose with a raging temperature took the train and was bought to the event hall in a fucking stretcher. \n\nBose in a strong speech read by his brother Sarat (he watched from a stretcher) basically said give the Brits a 6 month ultimatum and then launch total civil disobedience till the British left. \n\nThen when it came time for the CWC to be freshly nominated, Gandhi struck again, he used his crony, Gobind Panth to move a resolution that the CWC should only work on the command of Gandhiji and that the president (Bose) should nominate the members only as per Gandhi\'s desires. \n\nBy now the atmosphere was entirely vitiated and Gandhi had poisoned the rest of the leadership against Bose. Bose left and in his own memoirs he writes that he loathed politics and was disgusted by the Cong and vowed to never get into active politics again. \n\nMind you, all this and Gandhi the evil man wasn\'t even present. He was dicking around in the kingdom of Rajkot! He moved all this through telegrams and letters (or setting it up before)\n\nAnd now comes Gandhi the cunt in his full blown Chankyan mode. To rehash your memory, the CWC is needed to do anything, Gandhi got all but two to resign. He then stymied Bose\'s attempts to nominate his own CWC, and then had a crony pass a resolution that the President had to consult with Gandhi to form his CWC. Now?\n\nGandhi fucking lapsed into silence. He refused to fucking nominate anyone! So Bose was checked and mated. He was literally president of nothing. Bose at his wit\'s end, said fuck taking advise, you (Gandhi) go ahead and nominate the members. Radio fucking silence. \n\nYet this asshat publicly was saying that he gave Bose the full authority to nominate whoever and that Pant\'s resolution was incorrect and not democratic!\n\nThen Bose gave up his own ego (and his writings and memoirs and letters all indicate that till this point he genuinely respected and admired Gandhi), he met iirc Gandhi himself and for a week they spoke and both sides attempted to hammer out a compromise but Gandhi was having none of it. He was steadfast in his Gandhian spirit of non co-operation. \n\nBose finally gave up and resigned as President. \n\nGandhi got his way. \n\nInterestingly it was Nehru again who was for Bose. He pushed the AICC to pass a resolution not accepting his resignation, that Bose could simply renominate the previous CWC and Bose iirc get an extension to account for the delays. \n\nBose though now was set, he said that now, he wanted to nominate his own CWC as was his right or no deal at all and Nehru withdrew the plans for the resolution. \n\nDoubly interestingly though is that Bose...felt Nehru was riding two horses at the same time and felt a keen sense of betrayal that his elder brother as he considered Nehru didn\'t bat for him fully. Triply interesting thing is, Nehru much much later admitted that he supported Bose entirely but he couldn\'t commit and hence he felt he let Bose down. \n\nIn closing I remembered this quote from Tagore to Bose (googled it up so this is entirely accurate),\n\n"The dignity and forbearance you have shown in the midst of the most aggravating situation has won my admiration and confidence in your leadership. The same perfect decorum has to be maintained by Bengal for the sake of her own self respect and thereby help turn your defeat into a permanent victory"\n\nGandhi repeated his dastardly machinations in 1945 and the election of Nehru as the president and thereby denying Patel the post of the PM. \n\nGandhi was massively influential, he had humongous pan India support but he was not the mahatma you read about in textbooks. Asshole was as autocratic as a Stalin. His authority was final in the INC and only what he wanted happened. All this talk of democracy was a thin patina, scrap it away and you found dictatorial powers vested in one man and one man only. \n\nHe and his retarded views, his unholy power over even an elected govt was a dangerous cocktail.   Do note, I don\'t condone his assassination but this whole "frail old man" nonsense has to stop.'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'bpnezu'<br />Score:58<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bpnezu/how_gandhi_murdered_democracytripuri_session_of/</li>

You must keep in mind also that Chennai has always had a brilliant bus service utility as well as a decent Suburban network. Issue here being roads were getting clogged and the suburban network didn't touch the core of the city for the most part. \n\nThe argument of the centre was facile and senseless and as a result of it's partisan behavior (of starving states with limited NDA electoral support of funds and infra) and is exposed totally now. \n\nThe planning of phase 1 itself was flawed as it now runs through the CBD but doesn't touch on most densely populated suburbs and localities. \n\nPhase 2 that does this should see an exponential growth in ridership as it links the core city to the residential localities to the IT hubs (which is where most of the car and IT bus and Engineering college buses) travel daily. \n\nThat being said, state and centre should definitely take over the useless but massively potential MRTS -an elevated railway network that runs inside the city core but because of shit poor visibility, connectivity to other modes and maintenance, has very limited patronage- and both convert it and link it to the existing metro system. \n\nHopefully both are done by 2025-26 as the city is already chocking and will very soon reach Bangalore, Mumbai levels of traffic jams in peak hour."<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'bp92o8'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bp92o8/chennai_metro_ridership/</li>

You can\'t let Modi go for election without a corruption scandle in his name.

It started off as a huge thing which even caused fear in analysts mind that this could turn into a shitfest where each election in the future would be lead on paying voters direct money.\n\nHowever, NYAY idea failed mainly because the target audience are unaware of such a scheme because Congress started this campaign just one week before the election.

      <li>Title::: 'The truth about Muzaffarnagar riots'<br />Body: 'Muzaffarnagar riots, Muzaffarnagar riots, Muzaffarnagar riots.\n\nWe kept hearing these same words again and again in print media and news channels few years ago.\n\nWe knew Hindu-Muslim riots happened in Muzaffarnagar. We knew a lot of Muslims and Hindus were killed, even more so the Muslims.\n\nBut has any media explained why or how did that happen. None of the major ones came out with the background of the riots. Here is some background on it.\n\nFew years ago, when Congress government was at centre and Samajwadi Party was ruling the state, in mid August, a girl from the Hindu Jat community was harassed in an eve-teasing incident by one Muslim youth called Shahnawaz Qureshi in Kawal village.\n\nThe girls cousins, Sachin and Gaurav, terrified and angry by the incident, wanted revenge. They went to Shahnawaz Qureshi\'s place and then allegedly thrashed him and after further altercations, then stabbed him, due to which Shahnawaz later succumbed to injuries.\n\nSeeing the Shahnawaz like this, the girls cousins Sachin and Gaurav then ran away from that place. But they were followed by the Muslim mob.\n\nIn retaliation, the two brothers were lynched by a Muslim mob. The mob killed both of them.\n\nThe names of the mob which killed both Sachin and Gaurav were later found to be Muzassim, Muzammil, Furquan, Nadeem, Jehangir, Afzaal, Iqbal.\n\nWhat is interesting is that the police under the Akhilesh Yadav government, arrested eleven members of the girl\'s family for killing the Muslim youth. However, the state police did not act against the killers of the Hindu brothers, until they were forced to do it.\n\nWhat was also worrying that the girl, who was then harrassed and threatened, had finally given the statement that she was not harrassed by Shahnawaz Qureshi and she never knew who he was.\n\nThe UP police then came up with a story that the killing of Shahnawaz Qureshi was not because of harrassment of the girl but a minor bike accident between the two Hindu brothers and the Muslim man. This story was widely published and spread by media house NDTV without verifying whether it was true or not. For them, "the Hindu youths violently trashed and stabbed the innocent Muslim man just because of a minor bike accident" - imagine how likely is that irrespective of the communities. Another story was put that the two brothers went there with an intention to kill the eve-teaser in a pre-planned offensive, which is rather questionable, from truth perspective or from their own perspective - what were they thinking.\n\nHow did the riots start then.\n\nThe killing of the three youths, one Muslim and two Hindus in Kawal village started echoing across the district.\n\nTwo days after the incident, during the Friday\'s Muslim prayers, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Congress leaders went to the Muslim meeting demanding justice for the Muslim youth in  the Kawal incident. The BSP and Congress party members allegedly instigated the crowd to take revenge for the killing of Shahnawaz Qureshi.\n\nNext day, seeing this, in return, local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders allegedly gave an incendiary speech instigating the Hindu farmers.\n\nAfter the two meetings, respectively, the Hindu farmers were attacked and killed.\n\nThe situation was worsened further due to the acts of the state government. A month after the original killings, the local BJP MLA Sangcaet Singh Som, went to the Mahapanchayat of 40 villages, to protest against the Samajwadi Party\'s Uttar Pradesh government. In return, the state police began to lathi charge the the crowd and booked BJP MLA Sangeet Singh Som under the National Security Act for protesting against the SP government. Further more, one youth was killed in the police lathi charge.\n\nUnhappy with this, some of the crowd destroyed the police vehicles.\n\nBut the violence did not stop there.\n\nA big Muslim mob knew that the Mahapanchayat was going on and had completed by then.\n\nAround 2,000 Jats returning from the Mahapanchayat held at Kawwal were ambushed by a Muslim mob armed with assault rifles and other sophisticated weapons near Jauli Canal. Such sophisticated weapons are not to be found with common people or common villagers.\n\nThe mobs had destroyed 18 tractor trollies and 3 motorbikes. According to an eyewitness account, the Hindus were killed and then were dumped into the canal by the Muslim mob.\n\nIt was rumoured that hundreds of Hindus were killed or were missing, but authorities put on record only 6 of them.\n\nSurvivors of the Jauli Canal incident added that the policemen who were watching the assault purposely did not help the Hindu victims and let the killings happen, as they had said that \'they do not have orders to act\'.\n\nThis Jauli Canal incident then aroused Jats to go on a rampage against Muslims in the district.\n\nThe rest led to the Muzaffarnagar riots as we know it.\n\nDozens and dozens of people lost their lives in the riots. Many girls were sexually violated during it and absolutely no action was taken against the perpetrators. Thousands and thousands were effected by the riots.\n\nThe Supreme Court of India held that Akhilesh Yadav led Samajwadi Party, prima facie guilty of negligence in preventing the violence and ordered it to immediately arrest all those accused irrespective of their political affiliation. Court also blamed the then Congress government in centre for its failure to provide intelligence inputs to the Samajwadi Party-governed state government in time to help sound alerts.\n\nFurther more, after the incident, a sting operation was done by Headlines Today revealed that UP Cabinet Minister Azam Khan ordered police officers to release Muslims and not take action against them.\n\nThese Muzaffarnagar riots was something that should never had happened. Sure, curfews were there, army too was called, but there was misactions from all the sides. All parties, non-political and political were guilty to it. The Muslim man Shahnawaz Qureshi and the Hindu brothers Sachin Singh and Gaurav Singh. The Hindu and Muslim communities and their leaders. The Congress, SP government which some say purposely allowed the violence to happen for political gains. The SP, BSP and BJP politicians who exploited the riots for their respective benefits. All of them were responsible for it.\n\nThe SP and Congress governments got their punishment as next year they lost in the national elections by a huge margin. The politicians, leaders and other accused in the riots have cases running against them since.\n\nAlso, after 5 long years, some justice has been served in the Muzaffarnagar riots case couple of months ago. The people who killed Sachin and Gaurav, who were named Muzassim, Muzammil, Furquan, Nadeem, Jehangir, Afzaal, Iqbal, all have been found guilty by the court for murdering both of them and have been sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nThousands of others await justice for riots which could have easily been prevented but was never done.'<br />Author: 'Mumbaikarsevak'  id: 'bortc9'<br />Score:32<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bortc9/the_truth_about_muzaffarnagar_riots/</li>

In an underdeveloped city like Agra (yes, underdeveloped) there is no need for a metro line specially when the area of the city is so small.\n\nAccording to the reports, 50-100 year old trees are going to be cut down for the metro line. The metro line has not been successful in the capital city of the state, Lucknow. People may think that it would be successful because it is a tourist destination but the answer is a big, fat NO. Tourists coming to Agra mostly visit on weekends and with the construction of Yamuna Expressway, it has become easier for the tourists as an exit leads straight to the area near the Taj and the five star hotels.\n\nPeople in Agra struggle in daily commute so instead of a metro line, broader roads and flyovers would be way more beneficial for the good of the public.\n\nIf anyone knows and can suggest suitable measures that can be taken against this, please suggest.
