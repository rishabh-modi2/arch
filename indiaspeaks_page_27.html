      <li>Title::: 'The lessons that I learnt the hard way in my life aka Regret minimization framework!'<br />Body: 'This is a letter to myself whenever I indulge in regrets. I wrote this because if you see in internet, nb is telling this, most people just try to do some trolling when this topic comes or give the obvious of the replies and don\'t bother sharing their experience.\n\nLife is an open book dude. And nb will tell you this thing. Even my father doesn\'t tell me. But your near ones will always hint at you on the mistakes you could make in life. Plus the wise man(wise man are the people whose words always goes right), listen to them, they always tell what is the best thing to do in the situation. I regret not listening to them properly in the past.\n\n The key is to remain in the present as much as possible. If you had done some thing less in the past, Ok, no problem. It is gone, yes it will affect your future, but there is not an option. Because if you keep thinking about how things might have gone better, you would never know. \n\nMost of the regrets are just imaginations. I have 2-3 regrets. You need to accept that you were not just capable at the moment. I even tried to test thing thing. And the result was that "Even if I did the things that I regretted not doing, I would not have done anything better".\n\nYou are not a perfect human being, you had your shortcoming so accept that. \n\n\nHere are the key tips to minimize regret-:\n\n1) Stay in the present moment.\n\n2) Give 100% to the present moment.\n\n3) You can never go into future, so regret is kind of inevitable. Even the people who do perfect in their life regret sth extra, those who did sth extra, regret not doing things perfectly. But the point is if you strongly be in present moment and take decisions, chances are high that you won\'t regret these decisions too much.And even if you are making mistakes, you will figure it out as soon as possible. The similar thing happened to me. The key of not making mistakes, comes from a load of experiences of making mistakes. The key to not make mistakes is to learn-"When to stop?"\n\n\n\n4) Journal everday, see what things are taking a majority amount of time in your life. See the last week\'s journal, see today\'s journal. \n\n5) Keep track of things you are doing in your life properly\n\n6) Don\'t let fear rule any of your decisions. Any decision as the outcome of fear is also bound to create regrets.\n\n7) Try to work with all of your emotions, That Kam,krodh,lov,moha,maya thing si real. In my life, indulging to sexual activities like watching porn, watching hot models in instagram..and so on I regretted them. That Krodh thing is obvious. Lov=greed, this is the cause of my one of the biggest regrets. Moha=What does this mean? Attachement? maya= ? not sure. Keep track of these emotions in your journal.\n\nIf you just do these only, I can bet that you will avoid 99.99% of all regrets, regrets that makes me difficult to live everyday are those same regrets. I try my best, stay in the present moment, and try to do some yogas to focus myself to remain in the present moment. You could also try that.'<br />Author: 'adqnl'  id: 'jpkk1n'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jpkk1n/the_lessons_that_i_learnt_the_hard_way_in_my_life/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Marital Rape and Indian Law: the complexities'<br />Body: 'Let me first state the obvious that rape is a heinous crime and those who are found guilty of it should be punished severely and that marriage does not imply consent. \n\nBut there is a lie that has been spread for a long time that I believe should be countered:\n\n&gt; India is one of the few countries where a man can legally rape his wife\n\nThis cannot be more false. Yes, it is true that according to section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, that forced sex is a criminal offense only if the age of the wife is below 15. The punishment can range from imprisonment for 7 years to to life. \n\nBut there is also another section in the Indian Penal Code, which has been criticized for being too draconian. This law deals with female relatives. It reads:\n\n&gt; [498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty.—Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be pun\xadished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine. Explanation.—For the purpose of this section, “cruelty” means—\n\n&gt; (a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or\n\n&gt; (b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.]\n\nThe purpose of this law was to prevent atrocities against women on dowry and family-related matters. The punishment is much less than that of rape - extends to up to 3 years rather than life, but it\'s a punishment nonetheless. Section 3D of the Domestic Violence act makes it explicit:\n\n&gt; (d) otherwise injures or causes harm, whether physical or mental, to the aggrieved person. Explanation I.—For the purposes of this section,—\n&gt; (i) “physical abuse” means any act or conduct which is of such a nature as to cause bodily pain, harm, or danger to life, limb, or health or impair the health or development of the aggrieved person and includes assault, criminal intimidation and criminal force;\n&gt; (ii) “sexual abuse” includes any conduct of a sexual nature that abuses, humiliates, degrades or otherwise violates the dignity of woman;\n&gt; (iii) “verbal and emotional abuse” includes—\n&gt; (a) insults, ridicule, humiliation, name calling and insults or ridicule specially with regard to not having a child or a male child; and\n&gt; (b) repeated threats to cause physical pain to any person in whom the aggrieved person is interested.\n\nTo think marital rape is not included under sexual abuse is just ridiculous. It is quite obviously a crime. It\'s included under domestic violence. \n\nNow, you might be wondering why marital rape is not treated as normal rape. There is a violation of consent and it is still by definition "rape." Here\'s the short answer:\n\nIf rape were as a crime with harsh punishments under section 498A, the consequences of law\'s misuse would be drastic on men. Because of how broad the scope of the law has been, it is one of the most misused laws in the country. According to 2013 NCRB data, 93% of the crimes against women were registered under 498A, but of these, only in 15% of these cases resulted in a conviction. It\'s the section with one of the lowest conviction rates and has only been falling:https://factly.in/conviction-rate-for-cases-registered-under-sec-498a-ipc-is-among-the-lowest-for-all-ipc-crimes/\n\nIn 2006, the rate was 21.9%. Today it\'s barely 2/3rds of that percentage at 14.2%, but the number of cases filed has gone up roughly 50%. There are many instances where the case had been filed by vengeful daughter-in-laws, wives in the backdrop of a family feud. Now imagine, there being a possibility of life imprisonment under this draconian law. \n\nHere\'s are some videos about it including a documentary: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKRAkw5RUdw\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLtnL6mYXpI\n\nThe next legal course is to remove the exception under Section 375, but even that does not come without issues. One of the centre\'s arguments against it was that it would destabilize the institution of marriage. Agreed, but institution of marriage above a woman\'s dignity. Should she suffer the abuse to uphold it. I say no. Yes, wives can use the law as a way of harassing husbands with fake cases, but that\'s not a reason for why she should have no legal route to bring a rapist husband to justice.\n\nHere is the argument that carries weight: "How do you prove that there was indeed rape involved?" A husband and his wife will have sex. It\'s a natural part of the relation. How can you expect the state to get involved, investigate and come out with the conclusion that the wife was indeed raped. It could have happened that they had sex 2 days earlier and because of a heated argument now, she wants to get back at her husband and put the case on him. This puts a dangerous precedent of the state getting into the bedroom, which is characteristic of laws against homosexuality in the past, only more complicated. \n\nEven in genuine cases, an easy defense would be that the sex was consensual as we are a couple and sex is part of the personal relations between us. This would only reduce the conviction rate under 375, making it harder for the victims to get justice and would turn into a tool harass spouses.\n\nSeveral states in the US, too have laws putting such exceptions of spousal rape: https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2019/11/deval-patrick-spousal-rape-laws/'<br />Author: 'Shefali_Lamba'  id: 'jpielm'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jpielm/marital_rape_and_indian_law_the_complexities/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Maintain privacy and complete anonymity on Twitter(other public social media). No TOR involved.'<br />Body: "Note: Everything below is legal. There's no illegal stuff going on below. If you feel anything is illegal, let me know. Mods, please remove if it breaks the rules here. \n\nObjective: Stay anonymous on Twitter and any public social media platform\n\nWarning: Simple trolling with Twitter doesn't have to be so much hassle. However you know what you want. \n\nSome options: \n1. Twitter blacklists TOR nodes so TOR is out of the question. \n2. More over several VPN providers are blocked by Twitter. If you still can use a VPN without that issues, go ahead. Continue. You might not feel the need of the workaround below. \n\nThe workaround below is quite time consuming and takes some effort to setup. So unless you are seriously using Twitter please don't bother. Most influencers already use other ways. This is just one of them. \n\nSo basically you need to disconnect all trails to yourself. Paper trail. Bank trail. Almost any trail. \n\nI will go straight to the steps as everything is going to be self explanatory. \n\n1. Create a Bitcoin wallet using TAILS OS. This is a little bit of work and you will require a spare USB stick. Instructions available here. Electrum is a wallet and is already pre installed on TAILS OS. \n2. Use one of the Bitcoin exchanges to buy Bitcoin. Localbitcoin is a choice. Don't worry about verification, Localbitcoin has rarely sold user rights unless of course it has Interpol involved.\n3. Transfer coins from your Localbitcoin wallet to your anonymous Bitcoin wallet in the TAILS OS. \n4. Use a VPN for this step. Now go to : https://lowendbox.com/blog/bitcoin-vps-vps-providers-who-accept-bitcoin/\n5. Select a VPS from the list above. Don't worry that list is used by well known journos.  If you are not okay with Linux, search for a Windows VPS. \n6. Buy the VPS using Bitcoin. \n7. Connect to the VPS server using Remote Admin. \n8. Tweet to your glory. \n\nThey can track down the IP being used for the Twitter account. That track will lead to the VPS provider. The VPS provider will release details. However the only connection will be the Bitcoin transaction. No personal info needed for VPS registration, remember. Now, unless you are a major international level influencer, it won't matter. This whole task requires a lot of time and money on the part of the party who wants to know the IP. \n\nNote: You might want to consider a trial session for the VPS you are buying so that you know Twitter is not blocked for that. Most of the server IPs here are rarely blocked by Twitter. \n\nHow would you workaround the Telephone verification for Twitter?\nSimple. VOIP apps. Not Skype or the usual ones. Search for an app which has plans which can be bought using crypto(bitcoin in this case). Don't want to name them here. They are easily available. Try first. \n\nNote: There are other ways to do it. But it's better not said in public. The above method is very easy and legal."<br />Author: 'samosachutney'  id: 'jnt7ru'<br />Score:59<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jnt7ru/maintain_privacy_and_complete_anonymity_on/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Surajmal, Maharani Kishori, Marathas and the debacle at Panipat'<br />Body: "There has been a lot of controversy of the alleged non-cooperation of the Jats during the 3rd Battle of Panipat, but the truth is that Surajmal assisted the Marathas against Abdali's invasion and even sent them back after fighting them in Ballabgarh, Chaumunha, Gokul and Bharatpur despite differences.\n\nThe Marathas up till the Battle of Panipat had strained relations with the Rajputs because of their policy of collecting *chauth* from their territories. Because of this, Rajput kingdoms were both unable and unwilling to help the Marathas against Abdali. Sikhs were unwilling to help for similar reasons and because of Marathas considering them effectively a non-entity in Punjab politics. \n\nRelations with Surajmal and the Jats were better, but there was one key difference that rose: Marathas wanted to keep the Mughal emperor on the throne so that they could keep collecting *chauth* to fund the battle. When the Marathas met with Surajmal in Agra to discuss plans, Surajmal said he was ready to help Marathas in any way possible, but on the advice that:\n\n1) Marathas would not loot any territories in Delhi as this would cause Muslim chiefs to be united with the invaders (which Abdali had to an extent succeeded in doing)\n\n2) After the battle, the Mughal emperor was to be deposed and Jat rule was to prevail over Delhi.\n\n3) Only the men were to be sent to battle. Marathas ignored this advice and brought 2 lakh non-combatant Hindu pilgrims - many of whom were wives and kids of the soldiers.\n\n4) Marathas were better at guerilla warfare and raids as they were agile and movable, unlike the Rajputs, Sikhs, and Jats who had more experience attacking the enemy in the open field. Surajmal advised Marathas to conduct raids to weaken the invasion force.\n\n5) Attacks/raids by Marathas were to happen in the onset of the rainy season so that the enemy would be the weakest and quickly worn out.\n\nIn return, Suraj Mal's troops and food supplies would assist in the defense of Panipat.\n\nInitially, these tactics were very much appreciated by the Marathas except Sadashiv Rao, who thought these tactics were below his honour. He told Surajmal that he didn't need any help from the Jats. \n\nNow, at this point, it's important to note that there were 2 major rival nobles in Delhi - Nazibudualah, the Rohilla Afghan chief who supported Abdali, and Wazir of Delhi Ghazi Ud-din. Since Ghazi Ud-din was ousted in 1757 by Abdali after his fourth invasion, he fled to Bharatpur and was indebted to Maharaja Suraj Mal. Ghazi Ud-din invited the Marathas to invader and capture Delhi in 1757 from the Rohillas and Aghans and they succeeded in doing so. Marathas would place Ghazi Uddin as the Wazir, but would depose him and put a Maratha in his place. This was strongly opposed by Raja Surajmal who saw this as a way of high-handedness.\n\nNeedless to say, Abdali invaded again in 1761 and defeated the Marathas at Panipat. In this battle, due to the baggage of 2 lakh non-combatants and substandard tactics of the Maratha army, the Marathas' treasuries were looted, thousands of women and children raped and murdered, and several able generals lost. Many Maratha women and children were taken as slaves during the battle and sold in Afghanistan.\n\nThe starving, wounded, defeated troops and civilians had no allies and were dying of disease. Because of the sour relations Marathas had with the Rajputs and other kingdoms, very few felt any sympathy for them.\n\nThe exception was Maharaja Suraj Mal's wife, [Maharani Kishori.](https://www.jatland.com/w/images/6/64/Maharani_Kishori_Bharatpur.jpg) It is said that at Ballabgarh, Haryana , the Maharani saw the suffering group of Marathas and took them into her kingdom. She had initially requested Suraj Mal to advise Sadashiv Rao to leave the heavy ammunition and Maratha women and children at Bharatpur, so she was aware that this fate was not their fault. It is said that she and the Maharaja impressed by their devotion, fed, clothed 30-40 thousand men and their families and gave them shelter for 10 days. When it was time for them to return home, Maharaja gave each one 1 rupee, 1 piece of cloth and grain to every ordinary civilian before sending them to neighbouring Gwalior. In total, the Jats spent 10 lakh rupees.\n\nSources: \n\nHistory of the Jats by Ram Sarup Joon\n\nAdvanced Study of Modern India by Jaswant Lal Mehta\n\nhttps://bharatuntoldstory.tumblr.com/post/79356786023/maharaja-suraj-mal-the-plato-of-jats-jat"<br />Author: 'Shefali_Lamba'  id: 'jnqtv6'<br />Score:23<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jnqtv6/surajmal_maharani_kishori_marathas_and_the/</li>

The whole Bhagavad-gītā centers around the declaration of Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the version of all Vedic literature. Paratattva means the Supreme Reality, who is understood by the knowers of the Supreme as Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān. Bhagavān, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the last word in the Absolute. There is nothing more than that. The Lord says, mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcit asti dhanañjaya. Impersonal Brahman is also supported by Kṛṣṇa: brahmaṇo pratiṣṭhāham. Therefore in all ways Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Reality. One whose mind, intelligence, faith and refuge are always in Kṛṣṇa, or, in other words, one who is fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is undoubtedly washed clean of all misgivings and is in perfect knowledge in everything concerning transcendence. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person can thoroughly understand that there is duality (simultaneous identity and individuality) in Kṛṣṇa, and, equipped with such transcendental knowledge, one can make steady progress on the path of liberation.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : Why Lord Kṛṣṇa is called the Supreme Reality or Supreme Personality of Godhead ?**\n\n.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yk1nlp22o5x51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e36aac9ac9701b4244278014145d977eed456cf\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'jnqm87'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jnqm87/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is517/</li>

Ranjit Singh decreed to donate it to temple on his death, but it was taken by the British in war after Ranjit Singh's death."<br />Body: '&gt;Kakatiya rulers who ruled most of the Telugu speaking lands covered by current day Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states in India between 1083 CE to 1323 CE, with Orugallu (now Warangal), as its capital posessed this diamond.\n\n&gt;King Pulakesi II of Chalukya dynasty around 625 AD to commemorate his victory over Vengi region of Andhra Desam, constructed Goddess Bhadrakali temple and later Kakatiyas kept this as left eye of the idol, when they adopted her as their “Kula Devatha” giving her preference over other gods.\n\n&gt;When the Tughlaq dynasty replaced the Khiljī dynasty in 1320 AD, Ghiyāth al-Dīn Tughluq sent his commander Ulūgh Khān in 1323 to defeat the Kākatīya king Prātaparuḑra.\nUlūgh Khān’s raid was repulsed but he returned in a month with a larger and determined army. The unprepared army of Kakātīya was defeated this time and the diamond was seized by the champion army of the Delhi Sultanate.\n\n&gt;It was then owned by the Tughlaq Dynasty and Lodī Dynasty, and finally came into the possession of Bābur himself in 1526. He called the stone ‘the Diamond of Bābur‘ at the time, although it had been called by other names before he seized it from Ibrāhīm Lodī. Both Bābur and Humāyūn mention in their memoirs the origins of ‘the Diamond of Bābur‘. The last of the Tomaras, Man Singh Tomar, negotiated peace with Sikandar Lodī, Sultan of Delhi and became a vassal of the Delhi Sultanate.\nA 1757 miniature of Emir Ahmad Shāh Durrānī, in which the Koh-i-Noor diamond is seen hanging on the front of his crown, above his forehead.\n\n&gt;Humāyūn had much bad luck throughout his life. Sher Shāh Sūrī, who defeated Humāyūn, died in the flames of a burst cannon. Humāyūn’s son, Akbar, never kept the diamond with him and later only Shāh Jahān took it out of his treasury. Akbar’s grandson, Shāh Jahān was overthrown by his own son, Aurangzēb.\n\n&gt;Shah Jahan, famous for building the Taj Mahal in Agra, had the stone placed into his ornate Peacock Throne. His son, Aurangazēb, imprisoned his ailing father at nearby Agra Fort. While in the possession of Aurangazēb, it was cut by Hortenso Borgia, a Venetian lapidary, who was so clumsy that he reduced the weight of the stone to 186 carats, while the original diamond was 793 carats.\nLegend has it that he had the Koh-i-Noor positioned near a window so that Shāh Jahān could see the Tāj Mahal only by looking at its reflection in the stone. Aurangazēb later brought it to his capital Lahore and placed it in his own personal Bādshāhī Mosque. There it stayed until the invasion of Nādir Shāh of Iran in 1739 and the sacking of Agra and Delhi. Along with the Peacock Throne, he also carried off the Koh-i-Noor to Persia in 1739. It was allegedly Nādir Shāh who exclaimed Koh-i-Noor! when he finally managed to obtain the famous stone, and this is how the stone gained its present name. There is no reference to this name before 1739.\n\n&gt;The valuation of the Koh-i-Noor is given in the legend that one of Nādir Shāh’s consorts supposedly said, “If a strong man should take five stones, and throw one north, one south, one east, and one west, and the last straight up into the air, and the space between filled with gold and gems, that would equal the value of the Koh-i-Noor.”\n\n&gt;After the assassination of Nādir Shāh in 1747, the stone came into the hands of his general, Ahmad Shāh Durrānī of Afghanistan. In 1830, Shujāh Shāh Durrānī, the deposed ruler of Afghanistan, managed to flee with the diamond. He went to Lahore where Ranjīt Singh forced him to surrender it.\n\n&gt;Ranjīt Singh was crowned ruler of the Punjab region. In 1829 on his death bed, according to custom in India, Ranjith Singh wished to donate the diamond to a temple. He wanted to donate it to Lord Jagannath of the Puri temple in Odisha. However, after his death in 1839 the British administrators did not execute his will.\nOn 29 March 1849, the British raised their flag on the citadel of Lahore and the Punjab was formally proclaimed part of the British Empire in India. One of the terms of the Treaty of Lahore, the legal agreement formalising this occupation, was as follows:\n\n&gt;The gem called the Koh-i-Noor which was surrenderd by Shah Shuja-ul-Mulk to Maharajah Ranjit Singh and then surrendered by the Maharajah of Lahore to the Queen of England.\n\n&gt;The Governor-General in charge of the ratification for this treaty was Lord Dalhousie and he arranged that the diamond be presented by Maharaja Ranjīt Singh’s young successor, Dulīp Singh, to Queen Victoria in 1850. Dulīp Singh was the youngest son of Ranjīt Singh and his fifth wife Maharani Jind Kaur. Dulīp, aged 13, travelled to the United Kingdom to present the jewel. The presentation of the Koh-i-Noor and the Timur ruby to Queen Victoria was the latest in the long history of transfers of the stones as a spoil of war.Going by the journey covered by Koh-i-Noor diamond since 1306, it can be said that whichever king had it in its possession, met an early death. In fact, it is written that the stone is a harbinger of misfortune for male wearers–only God or a woman can wear it without harm. After goddess Bhadrakali, only the British Queen Elizabeth II could possess it without incurring serious harm; though it should be noted that the British empire faced decline a few years after the diamond went into its custody. To avoid any untoward happening, and knowing well the curse carried by the diamond, the queen avoids wearing the crown studded with Koh-i-Noor diamond.\n\n&gt;As for the Bhadrakali Temple we see today, after facing much plundering and damage in the last centuries, the temple was restored in the 1950s by an ardent devotee and some philanthropic affluent merchants.\n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel/destinations/bhadrakali-temple-in-warangal-and-its-connection-with-the-kohinoor-diamond/as68062366.cms\n\nhttps://www.booksfact.com/history/kohinoor-diamond-owner-bhadrakali-goddess-warangal.html'<br />Author: 'alubonda'  id: 'jnml9g'<br />Score:555<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jnml9g/til_the_kohinoor_diamond_when_first_mined_was/</li>

In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari "servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God". Al-Sharif al-Jurjani stated that slavery in Islamic law was a "penalty for unbelief."\n\nIslamic law and Sunni ulama recognise two categories of concubines:\n\nWar Captives:These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle. The entire population of a conquered territory can be enslaved, thus providing women who are otherwise rare on the battlefield. This paves the path for concubinage. The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives. If a person converted to Islam after being enslaved, their emancipation would be considered a pious act but not obligatory. Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.\n\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a pagan slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. Many traditions state that the female captives should be coerced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. Hasan al-Basri narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the qiblah, utter the shahada and perform wudhu. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle.\n\nSexual slavery of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas Muslim soldiers in the early Islamic conquests were given female captives as a reward for military participation. This not only increased military participation, but also served to rapidly spread Islam &amp; denude the existing population as the sexual slaves could be easily coerced to convert.\n\nIn traditional juristic understanding, it is the male\'s ownership of a woman\'s sexual organs which makes sex licit in Islam. This is why the woman is called aurat meaning vagina in Urdu. Meri aurat literally would translate to "my vagina." Islamic jurists describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife\'s private parts are purchased.\n\nFull link on Islamic Sexual Slavery\n\nThere are 4 aspects to Love Jihad/Jihadi Romeos\n\n-When you have religion instructing you to use sex/sexual violence as a means of conversion of kafir girls, there will be consequences..particularly in the not progressive areas.\n\n-There is a psychology of seeing the winning of the girl of other community as a means of conquest &amp; FU to the community- happens with blacks vis-a-vis whites, lowercaste vis-a-vis uppercaste, Muslims vis-a-vis Hindus. Girls are reduced to their caste/religion. This is why a Hindu boy having affair with a Muslim girl gets murdered, and why a Muslim boy marrying a Hindu girl is encouraged. (Here\'s a sample: https://twitter.com/core_collapsed/status/1319968535989243904)\n\n-Indian law itself says that if you marry a Muslim &amp; don\'t convert, you literally have no rights on property or anything. https://swarajyamag.com/ideas/stop-romanticising-interfaith-marriages-blindly-marrying-muslim-men-has-serious-legal-consequences-for-non-muslim-women. Plus the practicalities of orthodox regressive Muslim society means the female will have to give up her religion.\n\n-In the lower sections, mosques &amp; madarssas pay to marry Hindu girls. There are multiple videos from UP about this. Plus the dominant human trafficking mafia in India is Islamic (because of Pakistan &amp; Bangladesh). Now this second part is my conjecture, but I\'m hard pressed not to think that if mosques pay for marrying Hindu girls, why wouldn\'t they pay for trafficking Hindu girls. This was the same mindset in medieval India. It was the kafir women &amp; kafir men from India who were mostly sold as slaves in Middle East &amp; Central Asia, not Islamic ones.\n\nSummary\nLove Jihad/Jihadi Romeos/Communal Gendercrimes\n\nSpecifically targeting and converting Hindu girls to Islam either through subversion (Muslim guy changes to a Hindu name) or coercion (rape). Also involves blackmailing tactics such as making videos in compromised situation with the girl in order to finally submit to the Muslim guy\'s demand.\n\nPost marriage, these girls get converted to Islam, changes name, and break ties with her family. The intention is to make as much as babies as you can with these women. The girl either stay in her new religion and family or sometimes are thrown away after their role of baby making has been fulfilled.\n\nEndgame?\n\nIslam is an expansionist cult, with the motive of conquering world through its (Muslim) soldiers. For soldiers, you need more women to churn out more children. But there is a limit to a number of Muslim women.\n\nSolution?\n\nUse kafir women as a vassal to overcome your issue.\n\nRepercussions?\n\nLittle to no in the West and other non-Islamic countries because you are a minority and have a tacit support from leftists of said countries. You also have a victim card at your expense to paint any person questioning the belief of your cult as an \'Islamophobe\'.\n\nPower of the lobby advocating lovejihad\n\nApart from all the adverts and movies, where you obviously almost always have a Muslim guy-Hindu girl pairing, the lobby is as powerful as to push for removal of chief of National Commission of Women because she tweeted against love jihad. On the very same day when Nikita Tomar was murdered for refusing to convert, no less.\n\nhttps://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-ncw-chief-s-tweets-plea-in-bombay-hc-seeking-her-removal-from-post/story-MHlD708a3W7apC5NNiPTOI.html\n\nWith input from u/HumanPrint.

      <li>Title::: 'Surajmal, Maharani Kishori, Marathas and the debacle at Panipat'<br />Body: "There has been a lot of controversy of the alleged non-cooperation of the Jats during the 3rd Battle of Panipat, but the truth is that Surajmal assisted the Marathas against Abdali's invasion and even sent them back after fighting them in Ballabgarh, Chaumunha, Gokul and Bharatpur despite differences.\n\nThe Marathas up till the Battle of Panipat had strained relations with the Rajputs because of their policy of collecting *chauth* from their territories. Because of this, Rajput kingdoms were both unable and unwilling to help the Marathas against Abdali. Sikhs were unwilling to help for similar reasons and because of Marathas considering them effectively a non-entity in Punjab politics. \n\nRelations with Surajmal and the Jats were better, but there was one key difference that rose: Marathas wanted to keep the Mughal emperor on the throne so that they could keep collecting *chauth* to fund the battle. When the Marathas met with Surajmal in Agra to discuss plans, Surajmal said he was ready to help Marathas in any way possible, but on the advice that:\n\n1) Marathas would not loot any territories in Delhi as this would cause Muslim chiefs to be united with the invaders (which Abdali had to an extent succeeded in doing)\n\n2) After the battle, the Mughal emperor was to be deposed and Jat rule was to prevail over Delhi.\n\n3) Only the men were to be sent to battle. Marathas ignored this advice and brought 2 lakh non-combatant Hindu pilgrims - many of whom were wives and kids of the soldiers.\n\n4) Marathas were better at guerilla warfare and raids as they were agile and movable, unlike the Rajputs, Sikhs, and Jats who had more experience attacking the enemy in the open field. Surajmal advised Marathas to conduct raids to weaken the invasion force.\n\n5) Attacks/raids by Marathas were to happen in the onset of the rainy season so that the enemy would be the weakest and quickly worn out.\n\nIn return, Suraj Mal's troops and food supplies would assist in the defense of Panipat.\n\nInitially, these tactics were very much appreciated by the Marathas except Sadashiv Rao, who thought these tactics were below his honour. He told Surajmal that he didn't need any help from the Jats. \n\nNow, at this point, it's important to note that there were 2 major rival nobles in Delhi - Nazibudualah, the Rohilla Afghan chief who supported Abdali, and Wazir of Delhi Ghazi Ud-din. Since Ghazi Ud-din was ousted in 1757 by Abdali after his fourth invasion, he fled to Bharatpur and was indebted to Maharaja Suraj Mal. Ghazi Ud-din invited the Marathas to invader and capture Delhi in 1757 from the Rohillas and Aghans and they succeeded in doing so. Marathas would place Ghazi Uddin as the Wazir, but would depose him and put a Maratha in his place. This was strongly opposed by Raja Surajmal who saw this as a way of high-handedness.\n\nNeedless to say, Abdali invaded again in 1761 and defeated the Marathas at Panipat. In this battle, due to the baggage of 2 lakh non-combatants and substandard tactics of the Maratha army, the Marathas' treasuries were looted, thousands of women and children raped and murdered, and several able generals lost. Many Maratha women and children were taken as slaves during the battle and sold in Afghanistan.\n\nThe starving, wounded, defeated troops and civilians had no allies and were dying of disease. Because of the sour relations Marathas had with the Rajputs and other kingdoms, very few felt any sympathy for them.\n\nThe exception was Maharaja Suraj Mal's wife, [Maharani Kishori.](https://www.jatland.com/w/images/6/64/Maharani_Kishori_Bharatpur.jpg) It is said that at Ballabgarh, Haryana , the Maharani saw the the suffering group of Marathas and took them into her kingdom. She had initially requested Suraj Mal to advise Sadashiv Rao to leave the heavy ammunition and Maratha women and children at Bharatpur, so she was aware that this fate was not their fault. It is said that she and the Maharaja impressed by their devotion, fed, clothed 30-40 thousand men and their families and gave them shelter for 10 days. When it was time for them to return home, Maharaja gave each one 1 rupee, 1 piece of cloth and grain to every ordinary civilian before sending them to neighbouring Gwalior. In total, the Jats spent 10 lakh rupees.\n\nSources: \n\nHistory of the Jats by Ram Sarup Joon\n\nAdvanced Study of Modern India by Jaswant Lal Mehta\n\nhttps://bharatuntoldstory.tumblr.com/post/79356786023/maharaja-suraj-mal-the-plato-of-jats-jat"<br />Author: 'Shefali_Lamba'  id: 'jniagj'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jniagj/surajmal_maharani_kishori_marathas_and_the/</li>

The easiest way to call an election for or against an incumbent government is to see its impact on the life of an average voter. It is of course complicated in a multi-party democracy, but the US isn't one. Apart from Trump's press covfefe, stories of his decisions and their impact on an average American's life have largely been uncovered by the media. He has changed American lives, much at the cost of global aspirations, but that was the job he was given. Ignoring everything else, the kind of woke activism that is ongoing also paints a picture.

It is stated in the Bhagavad-gītā, "sarvaṁ jñāna-plavena," "jñānāgniḥ sarva-karmāṇi" and "na hi jñānena sadṛśam." Knowledge is always highly esteemed. And what is that knowledge? Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa, as is said in the Seventh Chapter, 19th verse: bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate. After passing through many, many births, when one perfect in knowledge surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa, or when one attains Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then everything is revealed to him, as the sun reveals everything in the daytime. The living entity is bewildered in so many ways. For instance, when he thinks himself God, unceremoniously, he actually falls into the last snare of nescience. If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by nescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience, or Satan, is greater than God. Real knowledge can be obtained from a person who is in perfect Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore, one has to seek out such a bona fide spiritual master and, under him, learn what Kṛṣṇa consciousness is. The spiritual master can drive away all nescience, as the sun drives away darkness. Even though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to discriminate between the soul and the Supersoul. However, he can know everything well if he cares to take shelter of the perfect, bona fide Kṛṣṇa conscious spiritual master. One can know God and one\'s relationship with God only when one actually meets a representative of God. A representative of God never claims that he is God, although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God because he has knowledge of God. One has to learn the distinction between God and the living entity. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa therefore stated in the Second Chapter (2.12) that every living being is individual and that the Lord also is individual. They were all individuals in the past, they are individuals at present, and they will continue to be individuals in the future, even after liberation. At night we see everything as one in the darkness, but in day when the sun is up, we see everything in its real identity. Identity with individuality in spiritual life is real knowledge.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the difference between God and the living entity ?**\n\n.\n\n**Question 2 : How one can know one’s relationship with God ?**\n\n.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zf1d25h3qyw51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad8eabcf9fcfe8dcbad271fbf437ca2cf383bcbc\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'jn4uwy'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jn4uwy/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is516/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Lockdowns across Europe, Sudan-Israel agreement, and the tyranny of Robert Mugabe'<br />Body: ' Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Biweekly Geopolitics Thread, where we discuss all the news from around the world. Discussion does not have to be related to India, and users are encouraged to share and discuss stories in the comments. Here are a few stories to get the discussion rolling: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Top stories\n\n1. [France-Turkey relations plunge](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/offensive-charlie-hebdo-cartoon-pushes-turkey-france-tensions-overdrive-n1245064)\n\nAs satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo continued its broadside against Turkish President Erdogan through yet another cartoon, relations between the two NATO allies are falling quickly. Erdogan has vowed to teach the publication, as well as the French President, a lesson for what he says is an attack on Muslims. Around the world, violent incidents have been reported against French assets, from massive protests in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Palestine, Iraq, etc. A security guard in the French consulate in Jeddah also faced a knife attack, in addition to attacks within France itself. The French foreign ministry has advised its citizens living in Muslim-majority countries to keep a low profile.\n\n2. [New round of COVID-19 lockdowns across Europe](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-is-living-a-coronavirus-flashback-plus-a-backlash/)\n\nFollowing a massive surge in COVID-19 cases and an overwhelmed hospital system, European countries, including France, the UK, Austria, and Germany have instituted new lockdown measures in an attempt to stem the tide. In many cases, the lockdowns are not quite as severe as in the spring, mostly involving curfews and reduced crowd sizes. Nonetheless, there is a growing backlash against the economic costs of these lockdowns, as well as a sense of fatigue. Protests against the measures were reported in all of these countries, although polls show that a majority of people still support them.\n\n3. [Chaotic US election this week](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/02/voting-2020-problems-updates-texas-judge-ballots-legal-fight/6069723002/)\n\nTuesday, Nov 3, will conclude voting for elections in the US, where the White House as well as both houses of the legislature are up for grabs. Both incumbent Donald Trump and his challenger Joe Biden held a number of rallies over the past two weeks. Trump has focused on his economic performance as well as conspiracy theories about Biden\'s son Hunter, while Biden has condemned Trump\'s handling of the pandemic and the Republic takeover of the US Supreme Court. With over 90 million votes already cast through postal ballot and early voting, over half the population has already voted, but results will come down to a few competitive states. Final results could take days if not weeks to tally.\n\n4. [Thai king makes rare comments amidst protests](https://time.com/5906323/thai-king-meets-supporters-protests/)\n\nEven as protests seeking reforms to the Thai monarchy as well as the military-imposed constitution continue to flair in the Southeast Asian country, Thailand\'s King  Maha Vajiralongkorn and Queen Suthida made a rare statement at the royal palace, mingling with crowds and saying that he loved protesters all the same. The country is sharply divided between those loyal to the monarchy, usually older people, and those that want its wings clipped and an end to royal interference in politics through the military (these are led by students). Protesters have openly criticized and mocked the monarchy\'s over the top lifestyle, despite the country\'s 15 year prison term for defaming the institution.\n\n5. [Sudan recognizes Israel](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/23/politics/trump-sudan-israel/index.html)\n\nUS President Donald Trump, in a joint conference call, announced that the Arab country of Sudan would join the growing list of those that recognize Israel. The two countries said they would cooperate in a number of areas, agriculture being the most critical of them. Israel\'s agricultural technologies that have a low water requirement are a major export to many countries, including India. Palestinian leaders condemned the agreement as a stab in the back. In return for the agreement, the US has agreed to remove Sudan from a list of state sponsors of terrorism and restore diplomatic immunity to its leaders. In 1967, the Arab League had decided to boycott Israel in its meeting in Khartoum, Sudan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The tyranny of Robert Mugabe\n\nIn the series of African freedom fighters turned dictators, perhaps none is better know in the 21st century than Robert Mugabe, the dictator of Zimbabwe who was deposed only in 2017. Born in 1924 in the British colony of Southern Rhodesia (established by Sir Cecil Rhodes, a white supremacist who established the namesake scholarship), Mugabe was a hero for his fight against the most draconic part of the European colonization of Africa: white minority rule. \n\nZimbabwe - then Rhodesia - was the bread basket of Africa, with a large amount of arable land and good climate. After the British occupied it, several white settlers moved there and took over agriculture, making the colony extremely productive and rich, but only for the settlers and their families. In 1965, after the UK refused to grant Rhodesia independence until the majority Africans were allowed to participate in a democratic system, the colony unilaterally declared independence under Prime Minister Ian Smith. He moved to establish a system similar to apartheid that was emerging in South Africa, creating an array of armed resistance groups that opposed him, chief among them being the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU). During this time, Mugabe was a student in South Africa, where he was exposed to Marxism as well as ideals of Mahatma Gandhi and India\'s freedom struggle. \n\nOn his return to Rhodesia, Mugabe joined revolutionary activities seeking to end white minority and British rule. His fiery speeches led him to be imprisoned for sedition in 1963, and remained so till 1975, even though sympathetic African jail guards continued to support his association with ZANU by secretly passing messages. In 1973 however, armed clashes broke out as ZANU\'s military wing - based in Mozambique and funded by the People\'s Republic of China - fought against increasing repression from Ian Smith\'s government. In 1975, when Mugabe was freed from prison, he fled to Mozambique and joined the ZANU fighters, delivering fiery speeches and preaching Marxism-Leninism. He called for the execution of Ian Smith and a takeover of white-owned farms, as well as the establishment of a one-party state. Fighting finally ended when the Lancaster House agreement was signed, and in 1980, Mugabe was elected Prime Minister under his reconstituted political party, the ZANU Popular Front (ZANU-PF). \n\nInitially, Mugabe was reconciliatory, receiving aid from the UK for build his new country. He toned down his Marxist rhetoric and instead encouraged voluntary redistribution of land based on market prices. His efforts towards reconciliation made him a hero in Africa, especially for South Africans living under the jackboot of apartheid. Education and immunization levels rose to some of the highest in all of Africa. Mugabe won another election, but by this time, increasing tribal strife and slow economic growth began changing his outlook. In 1987, the Constitution was amended to make Mugabe an executive president with control over the army, the ability to declare martial law, dissolve parliament, and run for an unlimited number of terms. While he was keen to abolish elections entirely, the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union stopped his plans, and he was forced to accept an IMF bailout with strict conditions.\n\nZimbabwe\'s economy nonetheless began its decline. ZANU-PF passed a law that allowed forced redistribution of land at government-determined prices, which led to a flight of the white minority that still contributed to most of the country\'s GDP. By 1995, ZANU-PF instituted rigging elections, winning over 95% of seats with a 32% turnout. Mugabe himself won the presidency in 1995 by over 99% of the vote. Mugabe took on an increasingly revolutionary tone, calling on African workers to boycott white-owned factories, and developed a strange fixation with homophobia, calling gay men as "worse than dogs and pigs".\n\nThe year 2000 proved a turning point - despite widespread vote-rigging, ZANU-PF lost its 2/3 parliamentary majority in the elections (still winning a simple majority however), and armed thugs began illegally seizing white-owned farms. When the judiciary tried to put a stop to these thugs, Mugabe had the judged removed and replaced with ZANU-PF loyalists. Unemployment soared as agricultural exports declined by over 90%, and the country began to print money. This led to hyperinflation. Zimbabwe was expelled by the Commonwealth and faced increasing economic sanctions from neighbouring countries that were bearing the brunt of refugees from there. The 2008 elections proved to be even more violent, with Mugabe forcing his opponent to drop out entirely. However, South Africa brokered a power-sharing agreement, with Mugabe as the President and his opponent Morgan Tsangirai as PM.\n\nIn 2013, after the economy had been stabilized, ZANU-PF won yet another landslide victory and Mugabe became President again in a widely rigged election. By this time, Mugabe and his second wife, Grace, had gotten used to an ostentatious display of wealth, often wearing foreign-branded clothes, going to Singapore for even routine medical check-ups, and attending all manner of conferences in exotic locations - all paid for by the state. Amidst widespread anger even within his own party, Mugabe announced that he would run for President again in 2018, at the age of 94. However, in 2017, the Zimbabwean army unseated Mugabe in a coup and installed his VP Emmerson Mnangagwa as president. Mugabe resigned later just before he was formally impeached by parliament. One of the main reasons that his own party had turned against him was the unpopularity of his wife and presumed successor.\n\nMugabe died in a Singapore hospital in 2019. The cause was never disclosed but it is rumoured that he died of cancer. His funeral was attended by many African leaders, although by then, he was remembered less as an independence hero and more as a tyrant that created Africa\'s worst economic crisis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What stories caught your attention?*'<br />Author: 'icecoolsushobhan'  id: 'jmthe7'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jmthe7/rindiaspeaks_biweekly_geopolitics_thread/</li>

Embodied beings, however, are bewildered because of the ignorance which covers their real knowledge.**\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**PURPORT**\n\n.\n\nThe Sanskrit word vibhuḥ means the Supreme Lord who is full of unlimited knowledge, riches, strength, fame, beauty and renunciation. He is always satisfied in Himself, undisturbed by sinful or pious activities. He does not create a particular situation for any living entity, but the living entity, bewildered by ignorance, desires to be put into certain conditions of life, and thereby his chain of action and reaction begins. A living entity is, by superior nature, full of knowledge. Nevertheless, he is prone to be influenced by ignorance due to his limited power. The Lord is omnipotent, but the living entity is not. The Lord is vibhu, or omniscient, but the living entity is aṇu, or atomic. Because he is a living soul, he has the capacity to desire by his free will. Such desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent Lord. And so, when the living entity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill those desires, but the Lord is never responsible for the actions and reactions of the particular situation which may be desired. Being in a bewildered condition, therefore, the embodied soul identifies himself with the circumstantial material body and becomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life. The Lord is the constant companion of the living entity as Paramātmā, or the Supersoul, and therefore He can understand the desires of the individual soul, as one can smell the flavor of a flower by being near it. Desire is a subtle form of conditioning of the living entity. The Lord fulfills his desire as he deserves: Man proposes and God disposes. The individual is not, therefore, omnipotent in fulfilling his desires. The Lord, however, can fulfill all desires, and the Lord, being neutral to everyone, does not interfere with the desires of the minute independant living entities. However, when one desires Kṛṣṇa, the Lord takes special care and encourages one to desire in such a way that one can attain to Him and be eternally happy. The Vedic hymn therefore declares:\n\n.\n\neṣa u hy eva sādhu karma kārayati taṁ yamebhyo lokebhya unninīṣate\n\neṣa u evāsādhu karma kārayati yamadho ninīṣate.\n\n.\n\najño jantur anīso \'yam ātmanaḥ sukha-duḥkhayoḥ\n\nīśvara-prerito gacchet svargaṁ vāśvabhram eva ca.\n\n.\n\n"The Lord engages the living entity in pious activities so he may be elevated. The Lord engages him in impious activities so he may go to hell. The living entity is completely dependant in his distress and happiness. By the will of the Supreme he can go to heaven or hell, as a cloud is driven by the air."\n\n.\n\nTherefore the embodied soul, by his immemorial desire to avoid Kṛṣṇa consciousness, causes his own bewilderment. Consequently, although he is constitutionally eternal, blissful and cognizant, due to the littleness of his existence he forgets his constitutional position of service to the Lord and is thus entrapped by nescience. And, under the spell of ignorance, the living entity claims that the Lord is responsible for his conditional existence. The Vedānta-sūtras also confirm this:\n\n.\n\nvaiṣamya-nairghṛṇye na sāpekṣatvāt tathā hi darśayati.\n\n.\n\n"The Lord neither hates nor likes anyone, though He appears to."\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the difference between a living entity and the Lord ?**\n\n.\n\n**Question 2 : Who is responsible for the conditional existence of a living entity and Why ?**\n\n.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chapter 5: Karma-yoga — Action in Kṛṣṇa Consciousness](https://preview.redd.it/y7zn71n5qqw51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fa5fe1c367441bbfda0d1a1e0a65ccc12020b94)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'jmfm68'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jmfm68/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is515/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'How Indira Gandhi destroyed the Spine of the Judiciary'<br />Body: 'The date was 25th June 1975. When for the first time in the history of Independent India, an emergency was declared citing “internal disturbances” (which has since been replaced with “armed rebellion” to prevent similar misuse of Article 352). “Internal Disturbance” was a shaky cause for the emergency, the real reason Indira Gandhi’s refusal to let go of the power. Why did she actually declare emergency? The real reason was Raj Narain.\n\nIn the Infamous case of State of UP v. Raj Narain [interesting fact, Raj Narain was sponsored by a short-lived political party called the Samyukta Socialist party, George Fernandes was the General Secretary of that party] (1975 AIR 865), the Allahabad HC found her guilty of election malpractice and subsequently, barred her from holding elected office for six years. Justice Jagmohan Lal Sinha was the helm of this decision. More serious charges like bribing voters were dropped and she was held responsible for using state machinery to favour her politically. The Times described it as “firing the Prime Minister for a traffic ticket”.\n\nThe celebrated lawyer, Nani Palkhivala, who then represented Indira Gandhi, prayed for a complete stay, submitting before the court, that it could prove detrimental to the constitutional office of the Prime Minister of India. The Judge, Justice Krishna Iyer, did not find merit in Palkhivala’s submission and instead granted only a limited stay, but otherwise upheld the Allahabad HC judgment. She was allowed to continue as Prime Minister during the pendency of her appeal. This enraged Gandhi. She was at the peak of her power, and this kind of “insubordination” was something she would not tolerate.\n\nTo her benefit, the very next day, JP Narayan and Morarji Desai of the Janta Dal organised a huge rally in Delhi and urged policemen to disobey any orders which they thing were unjustified. This was the perfect excuse for Indira Gandhi to assert her power. She used this as a justification to imply, that there was indeed “internal disturbance” being created by JP and others.\n\nSo, on 25th June 1975, the proclamation of emergency was signed by the then-president, Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed (fun fact, his family was left out of Assam-wide NRC). This was not preceded by any kind of cabinet meeting, which, even though not mandated by the black letter of law, was completely contrary to constitutional principles.\n\nBut what this a rash decision which was taken out of sheer anger? No. Any declaration of emergency requires a comprehensive socio-legal as well as administrative framework. The Shah commission stated that she had a very close-knit group of advisors who started the preparation of this emergency much, much earlier.\n\nThe time when Indira Gandhi destroyed SC’s spine\n\nThe judges of various high courts, especially the Bombay high court were very liberal viz a viz people who were detained pursuant to emergency. They even allowed the detainees to get their own food, cleaning supplies, medical aid as well as entertainment. This all was brought into question by one decision, ADM Jabalpur V Shivkant Shukla.\n\nShivkant Shukla was detained in Jabalpur, the HC decided in his favour and subsequently, the order was appealed in the Supreme Court. This case is known as the\xa0Habeus Corpus\xa0case. This was decided by a bench of five judges, namely Justices AN Ray (CJ), HR Khanna, YV Chandrachud, MH Beg and PN Bhagwati. Surprisingly, only Justice Khanna dissented in this judgment.\n\nIt was held in this\xa0case\n\n“In view of the Presidential Order dated 27th June 1975 no person has any locus to move any writ petition under Article 226 before a High Court for habeas corpus or any other writ or order or direction to challenge the legality of an order of detention on the ground that the order is not under or in compliance with the Act or is illegal or is vitiated by mala fides factual or legal or is based on extraneous considerations.”\n\nThis effectively exhausted all legal remedies for detainees. The detainees now had no convenient legal recourse.\n\nHow did Indira Gandhi manage this?\n\nTo understand this, we need to go back to perhaps, the most famous judgment in the history of Indian judiciary, Kesavananda Bharati V State of kerela 1973. It’s a very voluminous judgment, but in summary, the SC outline the proper meaning of the doctrine of “basic structure” and defined it properly in the Indian context. It partially cemented the case law established by Golaknath V State of Punjab. The court basically stated that the parliament has very wide powers to legislate, but this power is not unlimited, basic structure of the constitution (the definition of which has expanded a lot) cannot be amended. This meant that Indira Gandhi led parliament would now have al limited set of powers and the limit has now been defined.\n\nThe judgment was delivered 7:6, it was a wafer-thin majority.\n\nMajority:\xa0S.M.Sikri C. J. Hegde and Mukherjea, JJ.; Shelat and Grover, JJ.; Jaganmohan Reddy, J.; Khanna, J.\n\nDissent:\xa0Ray J.; Palekar J.; Mathew J.; Beg J.; Dwivedi J.; Chandrachud J.\n\nThe dissenting judges in the Kesavanand case namely, Ray, Chandrachud and Beg were the judges who were the part of the majority in the ADM Jabalpur case.\n\nJustice A.N.Ray, who was the senior most judge in the dissenting opinion of the Kesavananda Bharati case was elevated to the Chief Justice of India in 1973, IGNORING the custom of appointing the senior most Supreme court judge as the CJI.\n\nSo, timeline is as follows:\n\n24 April 1974: Kesavanand Bharati is decided, which took away a lot of legislative powers from the parliament. This was dissented by Ray J.; Palekar J.; Mathew J.; Beg J.; Dwivedi J.; Chandrachud J.\n\n26 April 1973: Just two days later, AN Ray was seemingly “rewarded” by Indira Gandhi as he was made the chief justice of India. He superseded 3 other SC judges namely, AN Grover, KS Hegde and JS Shelat. This was an unprecedented move.\n\n28 April 1976: AN Ray (CJ), HR Khanna, YV Chandrachud, MH Beg and PN Bhagwati once again “favored” Indira Gandhi by creating ADM Jabalpur precedent.\n\nWhile various high court judges and bars were busy in upholding constitutional values, the constitution was being murdered right at the gates of the Supreme Court of India.\n\nEven today, the selection procedure of judges is not a very impartial one. Judiciary is laced with examples of widespread nepotism and favouritism. Almost all the SC judges have had some sort of familial influence on the Indian legal system. NJAC provided solutions, but SC does not want to give up its “independence”.'<br />Author: 'Fat_duke'  id: 'jmb8t2'<br />Score:45<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jmb8t2/how_indira_gandhi_destroyed_the_spine_of_the/</li>

How he can live happily within the body ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "The embodied soul lives in the city of nine gates. The activities of the body, or the figurative city of body, are conducted automatically by the particular modes of nature. The soul, although subjecting himself to the conditions of the body, can be beyond those conditions, if he so desires. Owing only to forgetfulness of his superior nature, he identifies with the material body, and therefore suffers. By Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he can revive his real position and thus come out of his embodiment. Therefore, when one takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one at once becomes completely aloof from bodily activities. In such a controlled life, in which his deliberations are changed, he lives happily within the city of nine gates."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 5.13, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vpwsce0zumw51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bbf9605ecb3094b015da4c281638b6e3cafcb38\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

All this is enacted by the modes of material nature.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe living entity, as will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, is one in nature with the Supreme Lord, distinguished from matter, which is another nature-called inferior-of the Lord. Somehow, the superior nature, the living entity, has been in contact with material nature since time immemorial. The temporary body or material dwelling place which he obtains is the cause of varieties of activities and their resultant reactions. Living in such a conditional atmosphere, one suffers the results of the activities of the body by identifying himself (in ignorance) with the body. It is ignorance acquired from time immemorial that is the cause of bodily suffering and distress. As soon as the living entity becomes aloof from the activities of the body, he becomes free from the reactions as well. As long as he is in the city of body, he appears to be the master of it, but actually he is neither its proprietor nor controller of its actions and reactions. He is simply in the midst of the material ocean, struggling for existence. The waves of the ocean are tossing him, and he has no control over them. His best solution is to get out of the water by transcendental Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That alone will save him from all turmoil.\n\n**Question 1 : Why a living entity gets a temporary body ?

      <li>Title::: 'How Indira Gandhi destroyed the Spine of the Judiciary'<br />Body: 'The date was 25th June 1975. When for the first time in the history of Independent India, an emergency was declared citing “internal disturbances” (which has since been replaced with “armed rebellion” to prevent similar misuse of Article 352). “Internal Disturbance” was a shaky cause for the emergency, the real reason Indira Gandhi’s refusal to let go of the power. Why did she actually declare emergency? The real reason was Raj Narain.\n\nIn the Infamous case of State of UP v. Raj Narain [interesting fact, Raj Narain was sponsored by a short-lived political party called the Samyukta Socialist party, George Fernandes was the General Secretary of that party] (1975 AIR 865), the Allahabad HC found her guilty of election malpractice and subsequently, barred her from holding elected office for six years. Justice Jagmohan Lal Sinha was the helm of this decision. More serious charges like bribing voters were dropped and she was held responsible for using state machinery to favour her politically. The Times described it as “firing the Prime Minister for a traffic ticket”.\n\nThe celebrated lawyer, Nani Palkhivala, who then represented Indira Gandhi, prayed for a complete stay, submitting before the court, that it could prove detrimental to the constitutional office of the Prime Minister of India. The Judge, Justice Krishna Iyer, did not find merit in Palkhivala’s submission and instead granted only a limited stay, but otherwise upheld the Allahabad HC judgment. She was allowed to continue as Prime Minister during the pendency of her appeal. This enraged Gandhi. She was at the peak of her power, and this kind of “insubordination” was something she would not tolerate.\n\nTo her benefit, the very next day, JP Narayan and Morarji Desai of the Janta Dal organised a huge rally in Delhi and urged policemen to disobey any orders which they thing were unjustified. This was the perfect excuse for Indira Gandhi to assert her power. She used this as a justification to imply, that there was indeed “internal disturbance” being created by JP and others.\n\nSo, on 25th June 1975, the proclamation of emergency was signed by the then-president, Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed (fun fact, his family was left out of Assam-wide NRC). This was not preceded by any kind of cabinet meeting, which, even though not mandated by the black letter of law, was completely contrary to constitutional principles.\n\nBut what this a rash decision which was taken out of sheer anger? No. Any declaration of emergency requires a comprehensive socio-legal as well as administrative framework. The Shah commission stated that she had a very close-knit group of advisors who started the preparation of this emergency much, much earlier.\n\nThe time when Indira Gandhi destroyed SC’s spine\n\nThe judges of various high courts, especially the Bombay high court were very liberal viz a viz people who were detained pursuant to emergency. They even allowed the detainees to get their own food, cleaning supplies, medical aid as well as entertainment. This all was brought into question by one decision, ADM Jabalpur V Shivkant Shukla.\n\nShivkant Shukla was detained in Jabalpur, the HC decided in his favour and subsequently, the order was appealed in the Supreme Court. This case is known as the\xa0Habeus Corpus\xa0case. This was decided by a bench of five judges, namely Justices AN Ray (CJ), HR Khanna, YV Chandrachud, MH Beg and PN Bhagwati. Surprisingly, only Justice Khanna dissented in this judgment.\n\nIt was held in this\xa0case\n\n“In view of the Presidential Order dated 27th June 1975 no person has any locus to move any writ petition under Article 226 before a High Court for habeas corpus or any other writ or order or direction to challenge the legality of an order of detention on the ground that the order is not under or in compliance with the Act or is illegal or is vitiated by mala fides factual or legal or is based on extraneous considerations.”\n\nThis effectively exhausted all legal remedies for detainees. The detainees now had no convenient legal recourse.\n\nHow did Indira Gandhi manage this?\n\nTo understand this, we need to go back to perhaps, the most famous judgment in the history of Indian judiciary, Kesavananda Bharati V State of kerela 1973. It’s a very voluminous judgment, but in summary, the SC outline the proper meaning of the doctrine of “basic structure” and defined it properly in the Indian context. It partially cemented the case law established by Golaknath V State of Punjab. The court basically stated that the parliament has very wide powers to legislate, but this power is not unlimited, basic structure of the constitution (the definition of which has expanded a lot) cannot be amended. This meant that Indira Gandhi led parliament would now have al limited set of powers and the limit has now been defined.\n\nThe judgment was delivered 7:6, it was a wafer-thin majority.\n\nMajority:\xa0S.M.Sikri C. J. Hegde and Mukherjea, JJ.; Shelat and Grover, JJ.; Jaganmohan Reddy, J.; Khanna, J.\n\nDissent:\xa0Ray J.; Palekar J.; Mathew J.; Beg J.; Dwivedi J.; Chandrachud J.\n\nThe dissenting judges in the Kesavanand case namely, Ray, Chandrachud and Beg were the judges who were the part of the majority in the ADM Jabalpur case.\n\nJustice A.N.Ray, who was the senior most judge in the dissenting opinion of the Kesavananda Bharati case was elevated to the Chief Justice of India in 1973, IGNORING the custom of appointing the senior most Supreme court judge as the CJI.\n\nSo, timeline is as follows:\n\n24 April 1974: Kesavanand Bharati is decided, which took away a lot of legislative powers from the parliament. This was dissented by Ray J.; Palekar J.; Mathew J.; Beg J.; Dwivedi J.; Chandrachud J.\n\n26 April 1973: Just two days later, AN Ray was seemingly “rewarded” by Indira Gandhi as he was made the chief justice of India. He superseded 3 other SC judges namely, AN Grover, KS Hegde and JS Shelat. This was an unprecedented move.\n\n28 April 1976: AN Ray (CJ), HR Khanna, YV Chandrachud, MH Beg and PN Bhagwati once again “favored” Indira Gandhi by creating ADM Jabalpur precedent.\n\nWhile various high court judges and bars were busy in upholding constitutional values, the constitution was being murdered right at the gates of the Supreme Court of India.\n\nEven today, the selection procedure of judges is not a very impartial one. Judiciary is laced with examples of widespread nepotism and favouritism. Almost all the SC judges have had some sort of familial influence on the Indian legal system. NJAC provided solutions, but SC does not want to give up its “independence”.'<br />Author: 'Fat_duke'  id: 'jmb8t2'<br />Score:43<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jmb8t2/how_indira_gandhi_destroyed_the_spine_of_the/</li>

The activities of the body, or the figurative city of body, are conducted automatically by the particular modes of nature. The soul, although subjecting himself to the conditions of the body, can be beyond those conditions, if he so desires. Owing only to forgetfulness of his superior nature, he identifies with the material body, and therefore suffers. By Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he can revive his real position and thus come out of his embodiment. Therefore, when one takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one at once becomes completely aloof from bodily activities.

All this is enacted by the modes of material nature.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe living entity, as will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, is one in nature with the Supreme Lord, distinguished from matter, which is another nature-called inferior-of the Lord. Somehow, the superior nature, the living entity, has been in contact with material nature since time immemorial. The temporary body or material dwelling place which he obtains is the cause of varieties of activities and their resultant reactions. Living in such a conditional atmosphere, one suffers the results of the activities of the body by identifying himself (in ignorance) with the body. It is ignorance acquired from time immemorial that is the cause of bodily suffering and distress. As soon as the living entity becomes aloof from the activities of the body, he becomes free from the reactions as well. As long as he is in the city of body, he appears to be the master of it, but actually he is neither its proprietor nor controller of its actions and reactions. He is simply in the midst of the material ocean, struggling for existence. The waves of the ocean are tossing him, and he has no control over them. His best solution is to get out of the water by transcendental Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That alone will save him from all turmoil.\n\n**Question 1 : Why a living entity gets a temporary body ?

Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is no duality. All that exists is a product of Kṛṣṇa\'s energy, and Kṛṣṇa is all good. Therefore, activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness are on the absolute plane; they are transcendental and have no material effect. One is, therefore, filled with peace in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One who is, however, entangled in profit calculation for sense gratification cannot have that peace. This is the secret of Kṛṣṇa consciousness-realization that there is no existence besides Kṛṣṇa is the platform of peace and fearlessness."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 5.12, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1wuci1nn0gw51.png?width=376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=672829f610968345207980df09a8d62800376954\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

All of my knowledge comes from my own research. However, I believe that I have acquired a decent amount of knowledge to add my two cents to the argument.\n\nAs it stands right now, some, including the central government, argue that Gay marriage cannot be legalized under the Hindu Marriage Act because Hinduism does recognize such marriages. In this post, I will explain why I think that's a completely fair and understandable position.\n\nBut I would also like to disclose 2 things before presenting my argument  that might give a better perspective of the position I have taken:\n\n1. I am gay\n2. I am fully in support of gay marriage\n\n# Does Hindu culture recognize gay marriage? \n\nThere is a wide range of disagreements when it comes to this and I will let the religious scholars argue since its not a topic I'm familiar with. Even though it may seem like the core part of the argument I don't think it matters at all. Religion and culture are practiced infinitely different ways on both microscopic and macroscopic ways that even if there was an answer, it might not apply across the board.\n\n# Why does gay marriage have to be legalized under Hindu Marriage Act?\n\nIndia is a very diverse country with many religions and each religion is allowed to have its own laws regarding marriage. In that case, why should Hinduism be the only religion to accept gay marriage? The left has pandered to the LGBT+ community in our country in way that makes them look like the liberators of the this community but if we look at gay marriage, the rights of gay people seems to take a back seat to the twisted, corrupt and distorted view secularism.\n\n# Maybe it is a bad idea to legalize gay marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act\n\nWe are not protecting the rights of gay people by legalizing gay marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act. It seems to me that this would only protect the rights of gay people but only if they are Hindu. One of the most beautiful things about our great nation is that it protects the rights of all citizens and that universality of rights should be applied to the rights of gay people to be married. \n\n# So what is the solution?\n\nTime and again, we see how important it is to make Uniform Civil Code is to the country. It is one of the first things we should start pushing once the pandemic is behind us. \n\nApart from that, maybe we need to separate the social, religious and legal definitions of marriage. This would solve not just the problem at hand but various other issues plaguing the nation. This again would point back to Uniform Civil Code.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this is my opinion on Gay Marriage in India. I guess its more an opinion of the implementation of marriage rights of gay people.

The person who is attached to Kṛṣṇa and works for Him only is certainly a liberated person, and he is not anxious for fruitive rewards. In the Bhāgavatam, the cause of anxiety over the result of an activity is explained as being due to one's functioning in the conception of duality, that is, without knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is no duality. All that exists is a product of Kṛṣṇa's energy, and Kṛṣṇa is all good. Therefore, activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness are on the absolute plane; they are transcendental and have no material effect. One is, therefore, filled with peace in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One who is, however, entangled in profit calculation for sense gratification cannot have that peace. This is the secret of Kṛṣṇa consciousness-realization that there is no existence besides Kṛṣṇa is the platform of peace and fearlessness.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : Why one feels anxiety over the result of an activity ?

He himself belongs to Kṛṣṇa, and the body too belongs to Kṛṣṇa. When he applies everything produced of the body, mind, intelligence, words, life, wealth, etc.-whatever he may have within his possession-to Kṛṣṇa's service, he is at once dovetailed with Kṛṣṇa. He is one with Kṛṣṇa and is devoid of the false ego that leads one to believe that he is the body, etc. This is the perfect stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What description of Kṛṣṇa consciousness has been given in Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu ?

The material world is a sum total manifestation of the three modes of material nature, technically called the pradhāna. The Vedic hymns, sarvam etad brahma, tasmād etad brahma nāma-rūpam annaṁ ca jāyate, and, in the Bhagavad-gītā, mama yonir mahad brahma, indicate that everything in the material world is the manifestation of Brahman; and, although the effects are differently manifested, they are nondifferent from the cause. In the Īśopaniṣad it is said that everything is related to the Supreme Brahman or Kṛṣṇa, and thus everything belongs to Him only. One who knows perfectly well that everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa, that He is the proprietor of everything and that, therefore, everything is engaged in the service of the Lord, naturally has nothing to do with the results of his activities, whether virtuous or sinful. Even one\'s material body, being a gift of the Lord for carrying out a particular type of action, can be engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is beyond contamination by sinful reactions, exactly as the lotus leaf, though remaining in the water, is not wet. The Lord also says in the Gītā: mayi sarvāṇi karmāṇi sannyasya: "Resign all works unto Me \\[Kṛṣṇa\\]." The conclusion is that a person without Kṛṣṇa consciousness acts according to the concept of the material body and senses, but a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness acts according to the knowledge that the body is the property of Kṛṣṇa and should therefore be engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : How one get free from the results of all activities ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ihg9l9g1wqv51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c78b42c4734240c5926be63e3ed7a981dd6ee3e\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'jjfe0z'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jjfe0z/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is510/</li>

These people will tweet about specific cases in which victim is a minority, and only from one, i.e. Muslims. so when they don't have liberal/free viewpoint, how they can be called liberal.\n\nexample is recently occurred gruesome killing of nikita by a muslim man and incident in Bihar, no person from liberalk gang has tweeted or expressed their view or have demanded stringent punishment for culprits.\n\n2. any scheme, reform,initiative bring by government is heavily criticized by them constantly. i think they have not done any work and it is very easy to find faults in any work. i think a true liberal will actually support and participate in development work and then by working will tell the government about the drawbacks and loopholes and then will demand reforms in the same, only in this way a liberal can be modern, practical and progressive in true sense.\n\n3. due to their constant criticism on anything of everything , i think that, if they will continue to do so when the government will be formed by congress in future.\n\nif they will stop criticizing, then it will prove that this fraudsters were not liberals, they were pretending to be one, but were always following a particular ideology.\n\nbut if they will continue criticizing and bickering only even after congress forms the government in future, then i think these people don't want any type of progressive work in the country, they don't want any government i.e. they want Stateless society, then how they are different from naxals, or communists.\n\nwhat do you guys think, please share your views."<br />Author: 'Witty_Operation2486'  id: 'jj1l3h'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jj1l3h/pretentious_liberals_of_india/</li>

And, because everyone is satisfied by his work, he is pure in consciousness. Because he is pure in consciousness, his mind is completely controlled. And, because his mind is controlled, his senses are also controlled. Because his mind is always fixed on Kṛṣṇa, there is no chance of his being deviated from Kṛṣṇa. Nor is there a chance that he will engage his senses in matters other than the service of the Lord. He does not like to hear anything except topics relating to Kṛṣṇa; he does not like to eat anything which is not offered to Kṛṣṇa; and he does not wish to go anywhere if Kṛṣṇa is not involved.

This is because he is engaged in the loving transcendental service of Kṛṣṇa. Although he appears to be acting with his body and senses, he is always conscious of his actual position, which is spiritual engagement. In material consciousness, the senses are engaged in sense gratification, but in Kṛṣṇa consciousness the senses are engaged in the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa's senses. Therefore, the Kṛṣṇa conscious person is always free, even though he appears to be engaged in things of the senses. Activities such as seeing, hearing, speaking, evacuating, etc., are actions of the senses meant for work. A Kṛṣṇa consciousness person is never affected by the actions of the senses.

This is due to his Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Such a person cannot think of any living being as separate from Kṛṣṇa, just as the leaves and branches of a tree are not separate from the tree. He knows very well that by pouring water on the root of the tree, the water will be distributed to all the leaves and branches, or by supplying food to the stomach, the energy is automatically distributed throughout the body. Because one who works in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is servant to all, he is very dear to everyone. And, because everyone is satisfied by his work, he is pure in consciousness. Because he is pure in consciousness, his mind is completely controlled. And, because his mind is controlled, his senses are also controlled. Because his mind is always fixed on Kṛṣṇa, there is no chance of his being deviated from Kṛṣṇa. Nor is there a chance that he will engage his senses in matters other than the service of the Lord. He does not like to hear anything except topics relating to Kṛṣṇa; he does not like to eat anything which is not offered to Kṛṣṇa; and he does not wish to go anywhere if Kṛṣṇa is not involved. Therefore, his senses are controlled. A man of controlled senses cannot be offensive to anyone. One may ask, "Why then was Arjuna offensive (in battle) to others? Wasn\'t he in Kṛṣṇa consciousness?" Arjuna was only superficially offensive because (as has already been explained in the Second Chapter) all the assembled persons on the battlefield would continue to live individually, as the soul cannot be slain. So, spiritually, no one was killed on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra. Only their dresses were changed by the order of Kṛṣṇa, who was personally present. Therefore Arjuna, while fighting on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, was not really fighting at all; he was simply carrying out the orders of Kṛṣṇa in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

The sages, purified by works of devotion, achieve the Supreme without delay.**\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**PURPORT**\n\n.\n\nThere are two classes of sannyāsīs, or persons in the renounced order of life. The Māyāvādī sannyāsīs are engaged in the study of sāṅkhya philosophy, whereas the Vaisnava sannyāsīs are engaged in the study of Bhāgavatam philosophy, which affords the proper commentary on the Vedānta-sūtras. The Māyāvādī sannyāsīs also study the Vedānta-sūtras, but use their own commentary, called Śārīraka-bhāṣya, written by Śaṅkarācārya. The students of the Bhāgavata school are engaged in devotional service of the Lord, according to pāñcarātrikī regulations, and therefore the Vaiṣṇava sannyāsīs have multiple engagements in the transcendental service of the Lord. The Vaiṣṇava sannyāsīs have nothing to do with material activities, and yet they perform various activities in their devotional service to the Lord. But the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs, engaged in the studies of sāṅkhya and Vedānta and speculation, cannot relish transcendental service of the Lord. Because their studies become very tedious, they sometimes become tired of Brahman speculation, and thus they take shelter of the Bhāgavatam without proper understanding. Consequently their study of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam becomes troublesome. Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial means are all useless for the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs. The Vaiṣṇava sannyāsīs, who are engaged in devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their transcendental duties, and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into the kingdom of God. The Māyāvādī sannyāsīs sometimes fall down from the path of self-realization and again enter into material activities of a philanthropic and altruistic nature, which are nothing but material engagements. Therefore, the conclusion is that those who are engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness are better situated than the sannyāsīs engaged in simple Brahman speculation, although they too come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, after many births.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the difference between the philosophies studied by the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs and a Vaisnava sannyāsīs ? Who amongst them is better situated on the path of self-realisation ?**\n\n.\n\n**Question 2 : Why a Māyāvādī sannyāsīs has to sometimes take shelter of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pisgw7x9z5v51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c26215c614e47f257012da47ae5ba5fc95cca85a\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'jhmzjq'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jhmzjq/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is56/</li>
      <li>Title::: '[IndiaSpeaks Sunday Debate] India should move towards a system of single-point GST'<br />Body: 'Tax revenues are collected under various categories in India at 4 main points. At the level of the central government, the state government, urban local bodies and rural local bodies. Since the centre collects the largest amount of taxes while the largest expenditure occurs at the state level, for varied reasons like health, education, law and order., etc, the shortfall at the state level is met by the devolution of revenues from the centre to the states by a formula set by the latest (right now in the 15th iteration) Finance Commission. \n\nThe devolution can be to states to act as it pleases with the money or it can be tied to certain set goals, such as implementation of schemes such as Ayushmann Bharat, MGNREGA, etc. \n\nSingle-point GST would be a system where tax revenue is collected solely by the central government. This means taxing Goods at only the point of manufacturing and Services only at the point of delivery of the services. \n\nPoints for the motion - This could bring great uniformity across the nation in terms of the tax codes, eliminate the need for some GST refunds and keeping track of "GST credit". Prevent the skew of revenues towards states with higher consumption (in the current GST system, state revenue accrues at the point of consumption of a good). Encourage investors to invest anywhere in the country rather than already high-performing states. One single consolidated fund easier for budgeting\n\nPoints against the motion - Takes away completely state fiscal autonomy. Threatens federal structure, no incentive for states to improve economic growth, infrastructure. \n\n*[for] Those who are in support of the motion.*\n\nor\n\n*[Against] Those who are not in support of the motion.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* Pick a side - For or Against (Based off the topic/what you want to defend).

      <li>Title::: 'The words we use'<br />Body: 'When in comes to voicing opinions, we are living in strange time as most have you have noticed.\n\nBe it media houses, social media (Twitter, Reddit, FB, etc) or other portals of recorded thoughts one has to consistently sanitize their opinions to meet legal, social or business obligations. In short, be nice even if it means to veil your truth. \n\nPoints that favor this view of sanitizing delivery of thought: \n\n* Whence we stereotype, generalize or use blanket statements you are closing doors for improvement of conditions, promoting hate on the innocent by extrapolating actions of a few guilty  and pushing the watchmen into action against you so that they adhere to their obligations.\n* While Racism means discrimination or prejudice against a race, today it is colloquially and publicly used to describe any forms of generalizations. Hence, if in a biased sample, 98 out of 100 examples of any ethnicity, ideology or so on are proven (or allegedly) guilty of any rude behavior - any words that describe all 100 - is racism. \n* First, you condemn an innocent person(s) to suspicion and discrimination - even if it is by a few. Next, you disregard any conditions that our own society navigated them into and transfer all blame. No one is born or wakes up being a rude person. Not everyone has the power to consistently fight or run, as they too have things or people they love, respect or support and need to stand by them. \n* Words also sometimes close down avenues of good conduct for the innocent.\n* Then how do you discuss \'controversial, hot button, emotionally charged\' issues? Honestly, online you cannot do so directly.\n\nPoints that favor against such sanitization:\n\n* What about Freedom to express, get called out, and let things get democratically shown the door {For those who\'ve been on the internet long enough, it never works this way. If you have 100 crazies, and 10 sane on a platform, you can guess what happens}\n* Why is there bias against a majority? {If there is against a minority, it is oppression. Majorities are urged to be tolerant to criticism world over.}\n* What about hypocritical views? Some factions have a different set of allowances for themselves, while another set for who they consider others. Why is it wrong to call them out? { Ideally you can, but as it conflicts with the above obligations, you\'ll be sanitized}  \n* How can you address the elephants in the room? {Using the right words, "Does my statement include some possible innocent people?"}\n* How come we can hate against individual(s), but when it becomes criticism of a plural, faceless statistic, or even anecdotal/examples driven it becomes racism or prejudice? {Use of Generalization is enough to evidence racism}\n* We Indians are like the same race, so our comments cannot be racist! We do more for each other as compared to once in a while calling each other out{We are not, and even if we are, casual / uneducated racism is problem no one addresses. As above, as per the extended definition, it is wrong}\n* Why the selective unfairness? {Legal obligations, vote better and maybe in 4-5 decades things may get better}\n* This is all political! {If more than 2 people are involved anywhere, there will be political considerations. Here we speak of much more, so you\'re never actually free from it.}\n* This over-sensitivity to issues and criticism is detrimental in the long term. {Perhaps, but that\'s the world we live in right now} \n* Reasons for my opinions are more complicated thank you\'d like to simplify it!  {True, but so is the reaction to it. So, choices are based on who has leverage, what is the safest choice, and so on}\n\nWhile we can argue on this till the cows come home, it is a reality that the way we use our words will determine how far our ideas travel. \n\nAt the end of the day, most people (especially reddit, Twitter, internet, world pops) don\'t care if our people are in struggles forevermore. It is up to each one of us to be contentious of our immediate society.'<br />Author: 'metaltemujin'  id: 'jha78e'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jha78e/the_words_we_use/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 5.4'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : How the work in devotional service and sāṅkhya yoga are non-different from each other ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "The aim of the analytical study of the material world is to find the soul of existence. The soul of the material world is Viṣṇu, or the Supersoul. Devotional service to the Lord entails service to the Supersoul. One process is to find the root of the tree, and next to water the root. The real student of sāṅkhya philosophy finds the root of the material world, Viṣṇu, and then, in perfect knowledge, engages himself in the service of the Lord. Therefore, in essence, there is no difference between the two because the aim of both is Viṣṇu. Those who do not know the ultimate end say that the purposes of sāṅkhya and karma-yoga are not the same, but one who is learned knows the unifying aim in these different processes."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 5.4, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kghcby7ld1v51.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c09eb9c71a335abf3f7c36fc975829cedec03ea7\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

In my opinion, all reference to any religion should be removed from the constitution and law. Everyone is treated equally, ie there\'s no reservations for any caste or religious group. All control of temples, Gurudwaras, Mosques, churches should be privatised to some organisation or company without any funding from the local government, although a close watch should be maintained on specific sites of worship to curb extremism.\n\n\n\n\nEconomically, I feel like the government must slowly lift regulations and start privatising many sectors of the economy.

      <li>Title::: 'Has anyone tried their hand at creating offline dictionary from Wikitionary? I am specifically looking for Telugu language though.'<br />Body: "What I want to do? : I'd like to embed a dictionary in custom lightweight markdown based editor, especially for Telugu language. Features that I'd like to incorporate is  word completion (perhaps dropdown) and built-in synonym lookup feature.\n\nThere don't seem to be soft dictionaries available for Telugu language (even commercially). There are a few websites where a word can be looked up but that doesn't serve my purpose. So I looked at Wikitionary for Telugu language. I took an [XML dump from this page](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/tewiktionary/20200601/). This is bz'ipped and it expands to 200M+ one single file with non-standard formatting even for MediaWiki sites (it seems individual deployments of Mediawiki provide a great flexibility of templates). This [comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3364279/has-anyone-parsed-wiktionary/31697649) from SO is troubling\n\n&gt;Although there are conventions used by the editors they are not enforced by anything other than peer oversight. The diversity of templates used along with all the typos in the pages makes the parsing quite challenging.\n\n&gt;like the others have mentioned, wiktionary is a formatting-disaster, and was not built to be computer-readable\n\nThere is also another advisory from someone who already have [attempted this](http://www.igrec.ca/lexicography/installing-a-local-copy-of-wiktionary-mysql/)\n\n&gt;If you’re thinking you’ll just go ahead and extract the information you need from the XML file, I suggest you abandon that idea. Not only is the file difficult to manipulate, it’s HUGE. The French Wiktionary “pages” XML file, once decompressed, weighs in at 1.5 GB and is therefore much too large to simply open and work with.\n\nOffcial documentation of [MediaWiki](https://workingwithmediawiki.com/book) only mentions about importing MediaWiki data from one wiki system to another. Not much help here. However, there are [some python tools](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Client_code#Python) to deal with Wiki dump data\n\n1. [Pywikibot](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Manual:Pywikibot) - A collection of python scripts and a powerful library for bot writing\n2. [mwclient](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient) - Python library that makes most of the API functions accessible.\n3. [wiki-scripts](https://github.com/lahwaacz/wiki-scripts) - Framework for writing bots, maintenance scripts or performing data analysis. \n\nAnd then, few others I have found in my search that attempt to do what I want to, but in for other languages\n\n1. [wikokit](http://whinger.krc.karelia.ru/soft/wikokit/), [gitbub repo](https://github.com/componavt/wikokit) of this project, which works for Russian\n2. [WiktionaryParser](https://github.com/Suyash458/WiktionaryParser)\n\nFew pages that I found useful in this effort are \n\n1. [Local copy of Wikitionary in MySQL db\n](http://www.igrec.ca/lexicography/installing-a-local-copy-of-wiktionary-mysql/)\n2. Mediawiki book, on [importing and exporting](https://workingwithmediawiki.com/book/chapter19.html)\n3. [SO question](https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/505/wikipedia-dump-files-in-sql-format) on dumping Wikipedia files in SQL format\n4. [SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25200094/parse-wiktionary-xml-data-dump-into-mysql-database-using-php) on parsing Wikitionary content\n5. [Another SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3364279/has-anyone-parsed-wiktionary/31697649) on parsing Wikitionary data\n\nWhat do I want? \n\nI am handicapped by not knowing Telugu language. I am having difficulties in understanding if what I parse in correct or not. So it will be great if someone can give a quick shot at one of the tools and get some structured data of [Telugu Wikitionary](https://te.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%B0%AE%E0%B1%8A%E0%B0%A6%E0%B0%9F%E0%B0%BF_%E0%B0%AA%E0%B1%87%E0%B0%9C%E0%B1%80). \n\nIf not, can any of you give it a try for one of your languages with these tools and let me know how it goes?

Since the ultimate goal of life is self-realization, there is no difference between the conclusions reached by the two processes. By sāṅkhya philosophical research one comes to the conclusion that a living entity is not a part and parcel of the material world, but of the supreme spirit whole. Consequently, the spirit soul has nothing to do with the material world; his actions must be in some relation with the Supreme. When he acts in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he is actually in his constitutional position. In the first process of sāṅkhya, one has to become detached from matter, and in the devotional yoga process one has to attach himself to the work of Kṛṣṇa. Factually, both processes are the same, although superficially one process appears to involve detachment and the other process appears to involve attachment. However, detachment from matter and attachment to Kṛṣṇa are one and the same.

Those who are actually learned say that he who applies himself well to one of these paths achieves the results of both.**\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**PURPORT**\n\n.\n\nThe aim of the analytical study of the material world is to find the soul of existence. The soul of the material world is Viṣṇu, or the Supersoul. Devotional service to the Lord entails service to the Supersoul. One process is to find the root of the tree, and next to water the root. The real student of sāṅkhya philosophy finds the root of the material world, Viṣṇu, and then, in perfect knowledge, engages himself in the service of the Lord. Therefore, in essence, there is no difference between the two because the aim of both is Viṣṇu. Those who do not know the ultimate end say that the purposes of sāṅkhya and karma-yoga are not the same, but one who is learned knows the unifying aim in these different processes.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : How the work in devotional service and sāṅkhya yoga are non-different from each other ?**\n\n.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nc6o54xqyru51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b2e45dc66c5d47a7ab1dde1ffa3d847e98037b0\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'jggfm2'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jggfm2/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is54/</li>

The next day, Safdar was arrested as he was the one raising slogans.\n\nThis was warranted and constitutional.\n\nNow the PPP which has Govt in Karachi is in alliance with PML(N) and they couldn\'t afford the arrest of one of their alllied party\'s senior members.\n\nThey\'re saying that someone forced the IG of Sindh Police to sign the arrest warrant of Safdar.\nThey\'re implying that it was Rangers from a specific sector. This accusation is highly improbable as that sector of Karachi Rangers has been disbanded.\n\nPPP leader Bilawal called a press conference and asked the Army Chief to launch an inquiry by the Army.\n\nArmy Chief immediately called an inquiry and later called Bilawal.\n\nThere have been no clashes.

But if one performs work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? In other words, he thinks that sannyāsam, or renunciation in knowledge, should be altogether free from all kinds of activity because work and renunciation appear to him to be incompatible.

But, of the two, work in devotional service is better than renunciation of works.**\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**PURPORT**\n\n.\n\nFruitive activities (seeking sense gratification) are cause for material bondage. As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the standard of bodily comfort, one is sure to transmigrate to different types of bodies, thereby continuing material bondage perpetually. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam confirms this as follows:\n\n.\n\nnūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti\n\nna sādhu manye yata ātmano \'yam asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ\n\n.\n\nparābhavas tāvad abodha-jāto yāvanna jijñāsata ātma-tattvam\n\nyāvat kriyās tāvad idaṁ mano vai karmātmakaṁ yena śarīra-bandhaḥ\n\n.\n\nevaṁ manaḥ karma-vaśaṁ prayuṅkte avidyayātmany upadhīyamāne\n\nprītir na yāvan mayi vāsudeve na mucyate deha-yogena tāvat\n\n.\n\n"People are mad after sense gratification, and they do not know that this present body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one\'s fruitive activities in the past. Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one trouble in many ways. Therefore, to act for sense gratification is not good. One is considered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about the nature of work for fruitive results, for as long as one is engrossed in the consciousness of sense gratification, one has to transmigrate from one body to another. Although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and influenced by ignorance, one must develop a love for devotional service to Vāsudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage of material existence." (Bhāg. 5.5.4-6)\n\n.\n\nTherefore, jñāna (or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit soul) is not sufficient for liberation. One has to act in the status of spirit soul, otherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not, however, action on the fruitive platform. Activities performed in full knowledge strengthen one\'s advancement in real knowledge. Without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not actually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long as the heart is not purified, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But action in Kṛṣṇa consciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so that one need not descend to the material platform. Therefore, action in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk of falling. Renunciation without Kṛṣṇa consciousness is incomplete, as is confirmed by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in his Bhak ti-rasāmṛta-sindbu.\n\n.\n\nprāpañcikatayā buddhyā hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ\n\nmumukṣubhiḥ parityāgo vairāgyaṁ phalgu kathyate.\n\n.\n\n"Renunciation by persons eager to achieve liberation of things which are related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, though they are material, is called incomplete renunciation." Renunciation is compete when it is in the knowledge that everything in existence belongs to the Lord and that no one should claim proprietorship over anything. One should understand that, factually, nothing belongs to anyone. Then where is the question of renunciation? One who knows that everything is Kṛṣṇa\'s property is always situated in renunciation. Since everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa, everything should be employed in the service of Kṛṣṇa. This perfect form of action in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is far better than any amount of artificial renunciation by a sannyāsī of the Māyāvādī school.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : Why one has to transmigrate from one body to another ? How one can get out of it ?**\n\n.\n\n**Question 2 : How one can always be situated in renunciation ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chapter 5: Karma-yoga — Action in Kṛṣṇa Consciousness](https://preview.redd.it/n5bdn6dlcdu51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10445956c080155e60a3aadc35ec265d0233604a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'jf5hmy'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jf5hmy/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is52/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 4.42'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : What are the two main categories of spiritual activities ? How one can get benefited from understanding them ?**  \n**Answer 1 :** "When we come to spiritual activities, we find that these are also divided into two: namely, understanding of one\'s own self (or one\'s constitutional position), and the truth regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who follows the path of the Gītā as it is can very easily understand these two important divisions of spiritual knowledge. For him there is no difficulty in obtaining perfect knowledge of the self as part and parcel of the Lord. And such understanding is beneficial for such a person who easily understands the transcendental activities of the Lord. In the beginning of this chapter, the transcendental activities of the Lord were discussed by the Supreme Lord Himself."\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n**Question 2 : What is the best way to study the Bhagavad-gita?**  \n**Answer 2 :**  "Kṛṣṇa consciousness is awakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods, sacrifice to Brahman, sacrifice in celibacy, in household life, in controlling the senses, in practicing mystic yoga, in penance, in foregoing material possessions, in studying the Vedas, and in partaking of the social institution called varṇāśrama-dharma. All of these are known as sacrifice, and all of them are based on regulated action. But within all these activities, the important factor is self-realization. One who seeks that objective is the real student of Bhagavad-gītā, but one who doubts the authority of Kṛṣṇa falls back. One is therefore advised to study Bhagavad-gītā, or any other scripture, under a bona fide spiritual master, with service and surrender. A bona fide spiritual master is in the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does not deviate at all from the instructions of the Supreme Lord as they were imparted millions of years ago to the sun-god, from whom the instructions of Bhagavad-gītā have come down to the earthly kingdom."  \n.  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 4.42, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vo27fhvod8u51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3ab3e3a65db22a8de5caf6480dca4061f83ecd9\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

Armed with yoga, O Bhārata, stand and fight.**\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**PURPORT**\n\n.\n\nThe yoga system instructed in this chapter is called sanātana-yoga, or eternal activities performed by the living entity. This yoga has two divisions of sacrificial actions: one is called sacrifice of one's material possessions, and the other is called knowledge of self, which is pure spiritual activity. If sacrifice of one's material possessions is not dovetailed for spiritual realization, then such sacrifice becomes material. But one who performs such sacrifices with a spiritual objective, or in devotional service, makes a perfect sacrifice. When we come to spiritual activities, we find that these are also divided into two: namely, understanding of one's own self (or one's constitutional position), and the truth regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who follows the path of the Gītā as it is can very easily understand these two important divisions of spiritual knowledge. For him there is no difficulty in obtaining perfect knowledge of the self as part and parcel of the Lord. And such understanding is beneficial for such a person who easily understands the transcendental activities of the Lord. In the beginning of this chapter, the transcendental activities of the Lord were discussed by the Supreme Lord Himself. One who does not understand the instructions of the Gītā is faithless, and is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence awarded to him by the Lord. In spite of such instructions, one who does not understand the real nature of the Lord as the eternal, blissful, all-knowing Personality of Godhead, is certainly fool number one. Ignorance can be removed by gradual acceptance of the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is awakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods, sacrifice to Brahman, sacrifice in celibacy, in household life, in controlling the senses, in practicing mystic yoga, in penance, in foregoing material possessions, in studying the Vedas, and in partaking of the social institution called varṇāśrama-dharma. All of these are known as sacrifice, and all of them are based on regulated action. But within all these activities, the important factor is self-realization. One who seeks that objective is the real student of Bhagavad-gītā, but one who doubts the authority of Kṛṣṇa falls back. One is therefore advised to study Bhagavad-gītā, or any other scripture, under a bona fide spiritual master, with service and surrender. A bona fide spiritual master is in the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does not deviate at all from the instructions of the Supreme Lord as they were imparted millions of years ago to the sun-god, from whom the instructions of Bhagavad-gītā have come down to the earthly kingdom. One should, therefore, follow the path of Bhagavad-gītā as it is expressed in the Gītā itself and beware of self-interested people after personal aggrandizement who deviate others from the actual path. The Lord is definitely the supreme person, and His activities are transcendental. One who understands this is a liberated person from the very beginning of his study of the Gītā.\n\n.\n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourth Chapter of the Śrīmad-Bhagavad-gītā in the matter of Transcendental Knowledge.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the two main categories of spiritual activities ? How one can get benefited from understanding them ?**\n\n.\n\n**Question 2 : What is the best way to study the Bhagavad-gita?**\n\n.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ixbc43na5zt51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acfb08398dead2d42a2a01dd2fec3efb3aeb9cb2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'jduo0k'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jduo0k/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is442/</li>

It was the single-largest Allied force in the Turkish theatres, having deployed a total of approximately 7,60,000 Indian troops to them.*** \n\nIts men stood guard from Basra, Baghdad, Fallujah, Ramadi and Mosul to Cairo, Suez, Gaza, Jerusalem, Amman, Haifa, Damascus, Gallipoli and Istanbul. At the time, the British empire, in fact, approached its territorial zenith.\n\nThe Allied peace negotiations with the Turks were to last longer than the First World War itself. Their protraction was proof of their complexity. The Allies hotly competed for the spoils of Ottoman defeat: The British angled for new British-influenced Middle Eastern buffer states from Iraq to Palestine in order to cushion the Indian imperial sphere, while the French, Greeks and Italians looked to partition the Ottoman empire for new imperial possessions of their own. The Turks wanted Turkey for themselves and fought for it, above all against the Greeks.\n\nEventually, the Allies and the Turks signed the Treaty of Lausanne on July 24, 1923. In conjunction with other international agreements applying more widely to the Ottoman lands of 1914-18, the borders were drawn of the Turkish Republic and other post-war Middle Eastern states and European-administered mandates including Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan and Iraq. The map of the modern Middle East had taken shape.\n\nThe Indian army gradually evacuated the Middle East up to the late 1920s as the post-war settlements took effect. Having been a wrecking ball to knock down the Ottoman empire during the war, its place between the old and the new Middle East had ultimately been destructive — on behalf, of course, of the British empire. \n\nNational memories don't die easily.

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 4.40'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : Why it is very important to have firm faith in revealed scriptures ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "Persons who are almost like animals have no faith in, or knowledge of, the standard revealed scriptures; and some, even though they have knowledge of, or can cite passages from, the revealed scriptures, have actually no faith in these words. And even though others may have faith in scriptures like Bhagavad-gītā, they do not believe in or worship the Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Such persons cannot have any standing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They fall down. Out of all the abovementioned persons, those who have no faith and are always doubtful make no progress at all. Men without faith in God and His revealed word find no good in this world, nor in the next. For them there is no happiness whatsoever. One should therefore follow the principles of revealed scriptures with faith and thereby be raised to the platform of knowledge. Only this knowledge will help one become promoted to the transcendental platform of spiritual understanding. In other words, doubtful persons have no status whatsoever in spiritual emancipation."\n\nRef : Bhagavad-Gita 4.40, Purport, Srila Prabhupada\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g9e1grtwsut51.png?width=451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6b4df24cbd6281236fe9860d93d23fbecaed236\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: 'Kia Seltos and Hyundai Creta owners beware- there is a serious brake failure issue in both models and can cause dangerous accidents.'<br />Body: 'I am writing this because a recent discussion on TeamBhp about this topic was frightening. Kia Seltos and Hyundai Creta are two very popular cars and have brake failure issues that cannot be solved by service stations as per the owners.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.team-bhp.com/forum/indian-car-scene/228399-brake-failure-issues-kia-seltos.html\n\n"This guy was driving in cruise set at 60 kmph. On seeing an upcoming red traffic signal, he started to slow down and pressed the clutch pedal to downshift and the cruise got disengaged. Upon pressing the brake pedal , there was absolutely no braking available. He said the pedal felt like a hard wood with no movement or play. He tried slamming it again and again but to no avail - this must have happened for 7-8 seconds. He panicked and was fast approaching the signal. He stayed in 6 th gear itself and managed to pull the hand brake and stopped the car in the nick of time and inches before a two wheeler guy who was with his family with the pillion lady holding a baby in hand. He luckily managed to avert the mishap. The car apparently stalled with assistance from hand brake. He says the rear wheels got locked when it came to a stop. He started the car again, moved slowly and pulled over after the signal and the brake was then found to be operating normally afterwards."\n\nBasically, the pedal becomes hard suddenly and you can miss braking. Some are saying that it is related to a fault in the vacuum system so there is no brake assist to help you multiply the force, and the pedal becomes like a piece of wood. Others are saying it is related to malfunction of ABS which leads to the pedal becoming hard and unresponsive.\n\nBottom line is that if you, or your relative own these cars, be very careful if you travel in them and tell your relatives to be mindful of this problem, and not expect flawless braking.\n\nTLDR: Creta and Seltos are popular cars with brake failure issues. Please be very cautious about traveling in them or buying them.'<br />Author: 'Old-Dragonfly6760'  id: 'jd7zkx'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jd7zkx/kia_seltos_and_hyundai_creta_owners_beware_there/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Beyond the Tales of Tenali : A Glimpse into the Vijayanagara Empire (II)'<br />Body: '[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j7qshj/beyond_the_tales_of_tenali_a_glimpse_into_the/)\n\nLike most capitals, Vijayanagara was characterised by a distinctive physical layout and building style.\n\nAlthough the city now stands in ruins, we know plenty about how the city looked, and more importantly, how it *felt* in the 15th and 16th centuries thanks to the accounts of Nicolo de Conti, Abdur Razzaq, Afanasii Nikitin, Duarte Barbosa, Domingo Paes and Fernao Nuniz, apart from the hundreds of inscriptions of the kings of Vijayanagara and their *nayakas* recording donations to temples as well as describing important events.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Waterworks :-***\n\nThe most striking feature about the location of Vijayanagara is the natural basin formed by the Tungabhadra which flows in a north-easterly direction. The surrounding landscape is characterised by stunning granite hills that seem to form a girdle around the city. A number of streams flow down to the river from these rocky outcrops.\n\nIn almost all cases embankments were built along these streams to create reservoirs of varying sizes. As this is one of the most arid zones of the peninsula, elaborate arrangements had to be made to store rainwater and conduct it to the city.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*"The king made a tank at the mouth of two hills so that all the water which comes from either side collects there; and, besides this, water comes to it from more than three leagues (approximately 15 kilometers) by pipes which run along the lower parts of the range outside. This water is brought from a lake which itself overflows into a little river. The tank has three large pillars handsomely carved with figures; these connect above with certain pipes by which they get water when they have to irrigate their gardens and rice-fields. In order to make this tank the said king broke down a hill. In the tank I saw so many people at work that there must have been fifteen or twenty thousand men, looking like ants …"*\n\n\\- Domingo Paes\n\n(It is interesting to note that the city of Fatehpur Sikri, which was roughly a contemporary of the city of Vijayanagara and magnum opus of Mughal town planning at that time, had to abandoned due to lack of water for the royal household even though it arguably lay in a region not as arid as Vijayanagara)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***The City :-***\n\nThe city was protected by three fortified walls. The massive masonry construction was slightly tapered. No mortar or cementing agent was employed anywhere in the construction. The stone blocks were wedge shaped, which held them in place, and the inner portion of the walls was of earth packed with rubble. Square or rectangular bastions projected outwards. What was most significant about this fortification is that it enclosed agricultural tracts. A phenomenon rarely seen, if at all, in any part of the world.\n\nBesieging was a tactic employed by the Sultans to great effect in the medieval ages. The objective of sieges was to starve the defenders into submission. These sieges could last for several months and sometimes even years. Normally rulers tried to be prepared for such situations by building large granaries within fortified areas. The rulers of Vijayanagara adopted a more expensive and elaborate strategy of protecting the agricultural belt itself.\n\nThe urban core was dotted with numerous shrines and small temples, and also tombs and mosques. The tombs and mosques located here had distinctive functions, yet their architecture resembles that of the mandapas found in the temples of the city.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Religion and the Empire :-***\n\nTemple building in the region had a long history, going back to dynasties such as the Pallavas, Chalukyas, Hoysalas and Cholas. Rulers very often encouraged temple building as a means of associating themselves with the divine – often, the deity was explicitly or implicitly identified with the king. The kings claimed to rule on behalf of the god Virupaksha. All royal orders were signed *“Shri Virupaksha” (in Kannada script)* \n\nRulers also indicated their close links with the gods by using the title *“Hindu Suratrana”*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***The Bazaar :-***\n\n*"Going forward, you have a broad and beautiful street.  In this street live many merchants, and there you will find all sorts of rubies, and diamonds, and emeralds, and pearls, and seed-pearls, and cloths, and every other sort of thing there is on earth and that you may wish to buy. Then you have there every evening a fair where they sell many common horses and nags, and also many citrons, and limes, and oranges, and grapes, and every other kind of garden stuff, and wood; you have all in this street."*\n\n\\-Domingo Paes\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMuch of the information about the marketplace comes from the accounts of Nuniz. He describes it as “overflowing with abundance of fruits, grapes and oranges, limes, pomegranates, jackfruit and mangoes and all very cheap”. \n\nPaes described Vijayanagara as being “the best provided city in the world” with the markets “stocked with provisions such as rice, wheat, grains, corn and a certain amount of barley and beans, moong, pulses and horse-gram” all of which were cheaply and abundantly available.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***The Monuments :-***\n\nMost of the monuments are Hindu; the temples and the public infrastructure such as tanks and markets include reliefs and artwork depicting Hindu deities and themes from Hindu texts. The architecture is built from the abundant local stone; the dominant style is Dravidian, with roots in the developments in Hindu arts and architecture in the second half of the 1st millennium in the Deccan region. \n\nHowever, it would be unfair to the legacy of Vijayanagara to not mention the considerable Islamic influence seen in certain structures, most notably the Queen\'s Bath, which UNESCO says reflects a "highly evolved multi-religious and multi-ethnic society". The Vijayanagara society, although predominantly Hindu, was a pot pourri of different cultures. The accounts of Abdur Razzaq, various instances of Muslims rising through the ranks *(refer previous post), and* the discovery of Muslim and Jain structures in the city\'s urban core suggest that benefits of the Empire were not limited to Hindus alone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*(That\'s all for this post. The archeological heritage the Vijayanagara Empire left behind demands a full post to itself (or perhaps more than one), and that\'s precisely what I am going to write about in the next post in this series.

The land can be divided into 3 main regions, the hill tracts of Saurashtra, the barren, seasonal salt marshes of the Rann of Kutch and the remaining, relatively flat mainland with the hilly elevations of the Peninsular Plateau along the Eastern boundaries of the state.\n\nThe Sabarmati River, the Narmada and the Tapi River are the major rivers of the state.\n\n**Political Geography and Cities:**\n\nThe capital of Gujarat is Gandhinagar, located around 20 km north of the state's largest and most populous city, Ahmedabad. Other important cities include Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Jamnagar and Junagadh. \n\nThe state is divided into 33 districts which are further divided into 250 taluks. \n\n**Language:**\n\nGujarati is the official and most-spoken language of the state, with close to 86% of the people speaking Gujarati as their mother tongue. Other languages spoken by significant minorities are Hindi, Marathi, Marwari, Urdu, Kutchi and Sindhi, which is spoken by the migrants and refugees following the partition in 1947. The Bhili language spoken by the Bhil tribal people is an important language of the state.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Carved walls of the Rani ki Vav stepwell \\(source - Wikimedia\\)](https://preview.redd.it/syn9vq237ft51.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2643634983ec248b76f299917ff873104e0d5ea9)\n\n**What you can tell us!**\n\n**Major places to visit** \\- National parks, leisure getaways, adventure, pilgrimage\n\n**Important figures from history** \\- Which historical figure (history being defined as anything prior to 1990) has made a huge impact in Gujarat, India and the world?\n\n**Food** \\- What are some of the best dishes from each region to try out?\n\n**Festivals** \\- The unique celebrations and largest festivals of the state\n\n**Forests and Wildlife** \\- The flora and fauna of the state, the unique plant and animal species that can be found here\n\n**Tribes** \\- Who are the tribal populations living in this area and what lifestyle and historic occupation do they follow.

She was the real force behind AIIMS and also introduced the AIIMS Act in '56."<br />Body: "Rajkumari Amrit Kaur as Health Min. led the fight against Malaria, was even behind the BCG vaccination and donated her residence at Shimla, Manorville, to AIIMS as a space meant for the relaxation and recreation of the doctors and nurses of the institute. \n\n[https://indianexpress.com/article/research/rajkumari-amrit-kaur-the-princess-who-built-aiims-6570937/](https://indianexpress.com/article/research/rajkumari-amrit-kaur-the-princess-who-built-aiims-6570937/)\n\n “It is important to note that though a devout Christian, she was very much against missionary activities,” says Siddhant Das, great grand nephew of Amrit Kaur “She was a zealous patriot who believed that missionaries were alienating Indians from their cultural roots,” he explains \n\n When she was a member of the Constituent assembly she even supported an idea of the Uniform Civil Code. How many of you have ever heard Congress talking about Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, she is the person who deserves the real credit for AIIMS. But she rarely gets mentioned. \n\n This reluctance of Congress to credit anyone except the Nehru Gandhi family is what has caused their downfall. From what we've seen, they don't want to change. Supported by pliant journalists &amp; durbari historians who justify everything, the Congress party will never change!\n\nCredits : [Original Thread](https://twitter.com/ask0704/status/1316787458781184004?s=20)"<br />Author: 'ecoisrw'  id: 'jc44gv'<br />Score:46<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jc44gv/whenever_there_is_any_discussion_about_aiims_i/</li>
      <li>Title::: "It's not love jihad, it's rape jihad or woman-trafficking jihad. Call it for what it is."<br />Body: 'What is "love jihad?" Hindu girl loving a Muslim boy, she converting, then marrying him, then living as a Muslim couple for the rest of their lives? Call the girl dumb, call her a traitor to the community, cry over it while the Muslim boys and liberals laugh at Hindu men looking like bitter incels while your hands are tied in the word of the law (and it should be, else we will have many other problems even in normal marriages).\n\nLove is consensual. It\'s a natural human emotion and it implies acceptance. If 2 adults love one another, there\'s nothing you can do. There\'s nothing called "love jihad." It\'s a made-up term by buffoons who don\'t know or are ignorant what the terms "love" or "jihad" mean.\n\nNow there is a non-consensual love, which is simply rape. It\'s defined as:\n\n&gt; unlawful sexual activity and usually sexual intercourse carried out forcibly **or under threat of injury** against a person\'s will or with a person who is beneath a certain age or incapable of valid consent because of mental illness, mental deficiency, intoxication, unconsciousness,**or deception**\n\nWhen Lakshmi goes with Afroz, she doesn\'t expect to be treated like this. On the surface, it looks fine. The secular Hindu family is true to their values and respects their daughters wishes and it looks like the Afroz\'s family is also happy. \n\nBut little does she know that Afroz is not secular and expects her to convert. \n\nMaybe she doesn\'t know that polytheist women can never be a Muslim\'s wife, but at best a rakhel (concubine). Or knowing such, believes that my Afroz is different and not a religious fanatic.\n\nMaybe he first started to date her using the fake name Ashish. Lot of such cases happen like that. \n\nIs that not deception? Did she really consent to this treatment. After she is stuck in an abusive marriage, does she have a choice to leave it? Or is she threatened?\n\nWhy are we calling it consensual "love jihad" then? The intent is akin to rape and human trafficking.\n\nI say woman trafficking because there are cases in Hindi media (and I remember one from Panipat) in which a widow was tricked into vivah with a Muzlim man using a fake Hindu name then forced into a nikah with one of his friends. I will have to search my post history for the story.'<br />Author: 'Shefali_Lamba'  id: 'jc3rj3'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jc3rj3/its_not_love_jihad_its_rape_jihad_or/</li>

So please, If you have got no nice things to say then dont say anything.\n\nAlright, so here is the ordeal. I identify as a liberal. I support every protest thats there for the uplifment of any minor group be it the LGBT, women , kids , minority , the whole shebang. I proudly call myself open minded.\n\nEverything was going ok until I was talking to a muslim friend of mine about the ban of 3 talaq.\nI was speaking in favour of it because it is for the welfare of women right? Women rights is something I preach about on the daily.   Thats when my friend got really defensive and started calling me fake (?) Because I was apparently "pretending" to be a left wing while I was right wing all along. When I asked her why she thought so she said that as a liberal I was supposed to defend the minority group and protect them from having their beliefs and faiths stripped away. \n\nThis was really confusing to me. Do I continue doing what I believe is right ie; women having the right to their life and body or do I start doing what others want me to. Should I start appeasing everyone because thats what\'s expected of me?. \n\nThis friend of mine , although a liberal, is completely against same sex marriage and homosexuality in general because it goes against her religion. Hypocritical, I know. But I dont think we are allowed to talk about that cause then if be labelled an islamaphobe (ive had enough experience to know not to take the risk)\n\n I fight with my conservative relatives who makes sexist, racists remarks but I also dont turn a blind eye to any wrongdoings of a minority group or person just because they are that, a minority.\n\nSo here is my doubt. What am I? Left wing or right wing? I m not willing to completely let go of my faith but im not willing to let my faith take over me either. \n\nI also didnt think I would have my first existential crisis at the age of 19 xD'<br />Author: 'kathu_01'  id: 'jbi6ge'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jbi6ge/am_i_left_wing_or_right_wing/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Lets prevent rape'<br />Body: 'I  am no expert. I did some search engine fu. Summarizing a few points:  \n\n\n* Don\'t buy entertainment which objectify women, or, encourage violence towards them. Actually don\'t buy entertainment that encourage violence. (For e.g. PUBG and the likes ...)  \n\n* Don\'t label boys or men as "ladies" or any other gender, in any context. Its hurts everyone.  \n\n* Let boys cry.  \n\n* Celebrate all aspects of masculinity - even compassion and sensitivity.\xa0  \n\n* Politically men/women are the same. Biologically they are not. Please make a sincere effort to understand this.  \n\n* Praise women and girls for something other than the way they look.  \n\n* Understand how cultural beliefs contribute to interpersonal violence and support ways to encourage it to stop before it affects another generation.\n\nMany other points exist  \n\n\n# Some points pertinent to India\n\n* Poverty is bad, equally sad, but a real and rampant problem.  \n\n* Uniting a man and woman in matrimony doesn\'t solve the problem. Rape even happens in wedlock.  \n\n* Expect many more people (all genders) to sacrifice their lives as the nation "matures". The law can only punish. So don\'t go all protest mode on this. We need more progress, less revolution. That "maturity" will take time.  \n\n* Focus on relevant things in your life. Media will paint dystopia from time-to-time. It\'s better to tune into the news at one particular time of day for half hour, like evening 6pm, 9pm, or, morning 8am.  \n\n* Suppose you have two sons, find a way to explain "women" and still uphold respect towards them. Do discuss this India. Please.  \n\n* All genders are abused. Not only women.  \n\n\n# Final notes\n\n* Rape is one form of abuse. Several others exist - physical abuse, substance abuse, modern slavery, etc.\xa0  \n\n* The citizens of any country are plagued by these same evils. Do we hear rape in their media? If so, how often?  \n\n* The title of this post was purposefully catchy. I searched for "how to stop a culture of abuse".

In many Hollywood movies historically non-christian people are shown to feel offended when white people think they follow their own native religion and not Christianity and then those people say to white people that they are proud followers of Christ or something in the same lines. I'm not sure but I think there's some movies with even indians being shown like that(not talking about native american indians, it's almost always like that with them).

      <li>Title::: 'Loyalty to a Non-Islamic Government Does Islam teach that Muslims should be loyal to a non-Muslim government?'<br />Body: '\nMany Muslims are loyal to the non-Muslim countries in which they live, of course, but it is in spite of Islamic teaching. Unlike other faiths, Islam is not just a religion but also a political system. The state is intended to be inseparable from religious rule. Islamic law, or Sharia, is complete and not designed to coexist with or be subordinate to other legal systems.\nMuslims are not meant to be ruled by non-Muslims. The Quran is very clear that they are to resist unbelievers by any means, until Islam establishes political supremacy. This doesn\'t mean that everyone must be forced to become Muslim, but rather that everyone must submit to the supremacy of Islam.\nQuran\nQuran (5:3) - "This day have I perfected your religion for you." This verse is often interpreted to mean that any government outside of Sharia is unnecessary at best, and corruptive at worst.\nQuran (18:26) - "[Allah] maketh none to share in his government." This was probably intended as a slam against polytheists and the Christian belief in the Trinity, but it has been used as the basis for criticizing secular government.\n\nQuran (19:64) - "And we do not descend but by the command of your Lord; to Him belongs whatever is before us and whatever is behind us and whatever is between these, and your Lord is not forgetful."\n\nQuran (4:141) - "...And never will Allah grant to the unbelievers a way (to triumphs) over the believers."\n\nQuran (63:8) - "...might belongs to Allah and to His messenger and to the believers; but the hypocrites know not." The "hypocrites" are defined as Muslims in name only. They are accused of failing to submit to the theocracy of Allah.\n\nQuran (5:49) - "So judge between them by that which Allah hath revealed, and follow not their desires, but beware of them lest they seduce thee from some part of that which Allah hath revealed unto thee" Allah\'s Quran takes priority over the desires of the people. A democratic nation is, by nature, one that is not governed by Islamic law, meaning that a Muslim citizen would have divided loyalty. It\'s clear from this verse which side he must choose.\n\nQuran (3:28) - "Let not the believers Take for friends or helpers Unbelievers rather than believers: if any do that, in nothing will there be help from Allah: except by way of precaution, that ye may Guard yourselves from them. But Allah cautions you (To remember) Himself; for the final goal is to Allah." The word \'friend\' is Awliyaa which is inclusive of friends, protectors and helpers - the components of civil society. See also verse 5:51\n\nQuran (4:123) - "Not your desires, nor those of the People of the Book (can prevail): whoever works evil, will be requited accordingly. Nor will he find, besides Allah, any protector or helper."\n\nQuran (28:17) - "O my Lord! For that Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace on me, never shall I be a help to those who sin!" It is difficult to reconcile this verse with the civic duty of a public office holder in a pluralistic society.\n\nQuran (4:59) - "O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority from among you..." Oddly enough, this verse is sometimes used in an attempt to make the case that Muslims should respect a non-Muslim civil government. But a careful reading makes it clear that the rulers Muslims are to obey are from among their own body of believers. This verse commands strict obedience to the leader (even if he steals and flogs them, according to a hadith reported by Sahih Muslim).'<br />Author: 'thr0Wawayfitness'  id: 'jaol5v'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jaol5v/loyalty_to_a_nonislamic_government_does_islam/</li>

This material world is sometimes regarded as an ocean of nescience and sometimes as a blazing forest. In the ocean, however expert a swimmer one may be, the struggle for existence is very severe. If someone comes forward and lifts the struggling swimmer from the ocean, he is the greatest savior. Perfect knowledge, received from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the path of liberation. The boat of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is very simple, but at the same time the most sublime.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : How one can get liberated from this ocean of nescience known as the material world ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chapter 4: Transcendental Knowledge](https://preview.redd.it/q12re6eswss51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=184348e2a6b76a9217551cb5fbbf04a1d8a15144)\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'ja7m6b'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ja7m6b/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is436/</li>

This is relevant across the ideology whether its BJP/Congress/CPI/AAP/Left/Right/Liberal/Conservative etc etc.\n\nFind the person's background if you are following someone keenly and his political obligation.

      <li>Title::: '[Book Review] Essays on Indic History by Vijender Sharma'<br />Body: 'Rating - 4.5/5\n\nI rarely read very new or recent books, but a person I follow and respect a lot on twitter gave very good reviews of the books, so I felt it\'s worth a purchase. Kindle version is 300 rupees \n\n[https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B08CSRLN9Z/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_d\\_asin\\_title\\_o01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B08CSRLN9Z/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n\nThe aim of the book according to the author was to present some facts about Indian history in a fun way with as little politics and stories of kings and dynasties as possible as well as focusing more on Southern part of India than most written books. The book has a smooth flow and is excellently researched by the author. It is not an academic treatment of each and every finding and discovery. Instead, it seeks to just mention several episodes of our history and archaeological findings that may not be so well-know. It\'s a perfect book to read once, make a note of all the interesting things and then go back and read about each of them in detail. In that way, it\'s a rather extensive compendium of findings about pre-7th century India and the larger Indic sphere of influence which includes Central Asia, current-day Afghanistan and Pakistan and South-East Asia as well as parts of China. \n\nHere I will list a number of things I found really fascinating in the book so you can also read about these individually. I am mentioning some academic references mentioned in the book itself, but I have not gone through any of them myself. \n\n1. [Excavations at Mehrgarh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehrgarh) from pre-Harappan settlements found evidence of dentistry, a kind of proto root-canal treatment performed on individuals. The paper can be found here - [https://www.academia.edu/7147498/J\\_F\\_Jarrige](https://www.academia.edu/7147498/J_F_Jarrige)\n2. Harappans used wedge-shaped bricks to line the wells with the narrower end forming the wall surface. This allowed the walls to absorb more pressure, a great feat of engineering from thousands of years back. \n3. Ptolemy (100 CE - 170 CE) mentioned a port town of Maisolos on the Eastern coast of India, later identified with Machilipatnam in Andhra Pradesh. It was known for fine quality muslin exports to Rome. In fact, the National Institute of Oceanography has carried out excavations off the coast of Tamil Nadu. According to Sangam era texts, Puhar, the port capital of Early Cholas was "swallowed by the sea". NIO\'s work has shown that the erosion of the coast of TN is a constant process. Puhar and Mahabalipuram had settlements dating to 3rd century BC (now underwater). Even remnants of a 18th century Dutch fort have been found 100 m from the current day shoreline near Tharangamadi. So this swallowing of land by the sea is still going on, estimated at around 300 metre in the last 300 years. Sonar studies of Puhar have also found a paleo-channel of river Kaveri.   \n[https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=AV20120129489](https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=AV20120129489)  \n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27667285\\_Onshore\\_and\\_near\\_shore\\_explorations\\_along\\_the\\_southern\\_Tamilnadu\\_coast\\_With\\_a\\_view\\_to\\_locating\\_ancient\\_ports\\_and\\_submerged\\_sites](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27667285_Onshore_and_near_shore_explorations_along_the_southern_Tamilnadu_coast_With_a_view_to_locating_ancient_ports_and_submerged_sites)\n4. A small TIL - Chandragupta Maurya gave up his kingship and became a Jain monk, travelling to Shravanabelagola in Karnataka and then undertook a fast to death\n5. The Erythraean scrolls show that [Hippalaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periplus_of_the_Erythraean_Sea), a Greek navigator discovered the usage of monsoon wind patterns to navigate from India to South-east Asia. This was known in India. In fact, even today in Odisha, the festival of [Bali jaatra (voyage to Bali)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali_Jatra) is celebrated in the month of Karthika, when the winds are favourable for travel towards Indonesia \n6. The [Kushan empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kushan_Empire), which was an Indo-Greek Empire which greatly encouraged cultivation. In Northern India, this was done by clearing forest land. In Central Asia, the situation was different - open land was aplenty, but water was lacking. So they, with state funds, built large canals and were the first to bring agriculture to this parched region. Their excellent strategic location right on the silk road allowed them to control lots of trade and they are also responsible for the trade that took an Indian figurine to Rome, which was discovered in the ruined city of Pompeii, known as [Pompeii Lakshmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii_Lakshmi)\n7. The [Bakhshali Manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakhshali_manuscript) is a training manual on calculations for merchants of Gandharas and contains so many details about the mathematics of that time. It also is the oldest reference to the concept of zero, both as a symbol and as a number in its own right. It is a treasure trove of information, containing subjects such as linear equations, quadratic equations, values of square roots, etc. A short article and video on the topic -   \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV\\_gXGTuWxY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV_gXGTuWxY)  \n[https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/news/2017/sep-14](https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/news/2017/sep-14)\n8.  Huen Tsang in his travel memoirs mentions the presence of a "drum of discussion". Anyone who liked to challenge a theory or religious doctrine would strike the drum. Upon hearing it, it was obligatory on part of the community to send the best and most knowledgeable person to the debate. Amazing openness to debate and discussion instead of just dogmatic religiosity! The book even mentions that in some of the memoirs of Buddhist travellers, they encountered studies on comparison of religions, a pride and symbol of open-mindedness in modern liberal arts universities. \n\nHonestly, these are only a subset of about 20 places where I made little notes because I found them EXTREMELY interesting. And this 20 is itself a subset of everything mentioned in the book. It is a very rich compendium of Indian early history and a must-read if you like not heavy, pleasant to read history. There are so many more details, especially regarding Buddhist culture of Northern India and the spread to Central Asia and China. It\'s around 200 pages of just new and fresh and interesting details. \n\nThe only criticisms I would have are that \n\na) Despite promising to not be just about kings and dynasties, there are still lots of paragraphs dedicated to such political details. I guess it is unavoidable, but still\n\nb) Would have liked more about Southern India and North-east. But I guess a historian can only make conclusions about what data and discoveries exist, cannot extrapolate to regions where data is not available\n\nOverall, highly recommended'<br />Author: '1984_is_overrated_af'  id: 'j9ndg1'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j9ndg1/book_review_essays_on_indic_history_by_vijender/</li>

Why is India so dirty, because its gov's job to clean up our trash, not our personal responsibility to not throw trash... This leads to overinterference by gov in our everyday lives. Want to setup something need gov permit. New technology comes along, gov bans it till it can interfere (blockchain).
