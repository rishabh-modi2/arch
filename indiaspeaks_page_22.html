      <li>Title::: 'A brief comparison of India and China'<br />Body: 'I am writing this cause many people think India is headed no where and China has full on eclipsed India. While currently they are more developed than India, lets do a thorough analysis on this.\n\nAlso, you should read this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kr9fdf/megapost_about_india_companies_invested_in_india/) which discusses India\'s development indicator and economic indicator trends. The post is a MUST READ for every Indian.\n\n**History**:\n\nAround the time of independence, China came out of the civil war which was about 20 years and the communist rule under Mao Zedong. India came out of several hundred years of Islamic invasions AND 200 years of British Colonialism, of which resulted in [many famines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_major_famines_in_India_during_British_rule) and that the [British looted $45 trillion from India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/british-looted-45-trillion-from-india-in-todays-value-jaishankar/articleshow/71426353.cms).\n\nThe biggest difference between the two countries are the governments. India has a multiple party system (BJP, Congress) while China has a one-party system (CCP). India has freedom of speech, freedom of press and other democratic aspects and people can protest as well. China doesn\'t allow what India has, China can get away with doing anything in the country and also has state-sponsored media.\n\n**Economic comparison:**\n\nWhen people compare India and China, they compare by GDP per capita and such. [In 1990, India\'s GDP per capita was $367.56 then in 2018 it was $2009.98. China\'s GDP per capita was $317.88 in 1990 and then rose to $9770.85 in 2018.](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:IND:GBR:CAN&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=country:IND:CHN&amp;ifdim=world&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false) Then of course people assume "muh streetshitters dumb, China authoritarian better" (blatant westerner comments on reddit sadly)\n\nWhat no one takes into consideration was when India and China did economic reforms. China did this in 1978, India started their process in 1991, of course this took a while due to democracy being slower.  But lets keep the year at 1991. When the economic processes started, we will call this **Year 0**. So China has experienced **42** years of economic reforms and then India has experienced **29** years.\n\nI will be comparing the two countries from the point of *Year 0* (1978 and 1991) til year 27. Year 27 due to the availability of data and its before the COVID pandemic.\n\n***Year 27 for India is 2018 and Year 27 for China is 2005***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GDP Per Capita**:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||**China**|**India**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Year 0**|$156.40|$303.06|\n|**Year 27**|$1753.42|$2009.98|\n\nTable: [GDP Per capita](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:IND:GBR:CAN&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=country:IND:CHN&amp;ifdim=world&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false)\n\nSo as shown, in 27 years China has increased by $1597.02 while India has improved by $1706.92 as shown by the above table.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GDP PPP Per Capita**:\n\n||**China**|**India**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Year 2 (No data for China 1978)**|[$307](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_past_and_projected_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita#IMF_estimates_between_2020_and_2025)|[$1255](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_past_and_projected_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita#IMF_estimates_between_2020_and_2025)|\n|**Year 27**|[$5,004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_past_and_projected_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita#IMF_estimates_between_2020_and_2025)|[$6,653](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_past_and_projected_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita#IMF_estimates_between_2020_and_2025)|\n\nSo as shown in the table above, China increased by $4697 in 25 years while India increased by $5398 in 25 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GDP By Sector**\n\nGDP % in agriculture:\n\n||**China**|**India**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Year 0**|[27.68%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.AGR.TOTL.ZS?locations=IN-CN)|[27.33%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.AGR.TOTL.ZS?locations=IN-CN)|\n|**Year 27**|[11.64%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.AGR.TOTL.ZS?locations=IN-CN)|[15.40%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.AGR.TOTL.ZS?locations=IN-CN)|\n\nAs shown above, China has done better than India in reducing reliance on agriculture. China reduced by 16.04% while India reduced by 11.93%. This is due to China\'s more rapid urbanisation and industrialising, not saying India has not achieved high rates of this, but China has done better, them being authoritarian has helped the country highly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGDP % in industry:\n\n||**China**|**India**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Year 0**|[47.71%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.IND.TOTL.ZS?locations=IN-CN)|[26.44%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.IND.TOTL.ZS?locations=IN-CN)|\n|**Year 27**|[47.02%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.IND.TOTL.ZS?locations=IN-CN)|[26.12%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.IND.TOTL.ZS?locations=IN-CN)|\n\nSo as shown in the above table, China has done **much** better in industry. This is due to the more policies that contribute to rapid industrialisation and the increase in manufacturing and exports to the western countries. Something India lacked in currently (though it will change now that [many companies are investing into India](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kr9fdf/megapost_about_india_companies_invested_in_india/)). India had always been more of a services based economy, as shown in the below table.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGDP % in services:\n\n||**China**|**India**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Year 0**|[34.47%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.SRV.TOTL.ZS?locations=IN-CN)|[37.78%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.SRV.TOTL.ZS?locations=IN-CN)|\n|**Year 27**|[41.36%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.SRV.TOTL.ZS?locations=IN-CN)|[48.81%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.SRV.TOTL.ZS?locations=IN-CN)|\n\nSo as shown in the above table, India has done much better than China in services rather than industry. China had improved by 6.89% while India improved by 11.03%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Labour Employment by sector**:\n\nLabour % in agriculture:\n\n||**China**|**India**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Year 0**|[71%](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Distribution-of-labour-employment-in-China-1978-2015-Source-NBSa-2016_fig1_322371695)|[62.56%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.AGR.EMPL.ZS?locations=IN-CN)|\n|**Year 27**|[44.80%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.AGR.EMPL.ZS?locations=IN-CN)|[43.32%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.AGR.EMPL.ZS?locations=IN-CN)|\n\nHere, India\'s labour in agriculture reduced by 19.24% while China\'s reduced by 26%. Though China has done their agricultural reforms early on while India has to deal with the Punjab farmer protests.\n\nLabour % in Industry:\n\n||**China**|**India**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Year 0**|*Couldn\'t find data*|[15.72%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.IND.EMPL.ZS?locations=CN-IN)|\n|**Year 27**|[23.8%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.IND.EMPL.ZS?locations=CN-IN)|[24.949%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.IND.EMPL.ZS?locations=CN-IN)|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLabour % in Services:\n\n||**China**|**India**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Year 0**|*Couldn\'t find data*|[21.71%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.SRV.EMPL.ZS?locations=IN-CN)|\n|**Year 27**|[31.4%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.SRV.EMPL.ZS?locations=IN-CN)|[31.72%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.SRV.EMPL.ZS?locations=IN-CN)|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow from the three tables produced, it shows that India is on a similar labour force distribution in all three fields. While China might have shifted DRASTICALLY in agriculture, I could not find the relevant data for Industry and Services. What we can conclude is that India is on the right path.\n\nIndia went the route of office jobs and call centers and such, [though it is improving with companies wanting to invest in India to manufacture](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l2avpf/list_of_companies_investing_into_india_2020/), China has done the opposite. Focusing more on industry rather than services. Having more urbanisation in both countries, though China has experienced more rapid urbanisation as shown in the next table.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Urban Population**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||**China**|**India**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Year 0**|[171,153,535](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/CHN/china/urban-population#:~:text=China%20urban%20population%20for%202019,a%202.78%25%20increase%20from%202015)|[229,752,408](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IND/india/urban-population#:~:text=India%20urban%20population%20for%202019,a%202.35%25%20increase%20from%202015)|\n|**Year 27**|[554,367,818](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/CHN/china/urban-population#:~:text=China%20urban%20population%20for%202019,a%202.78%25%20increase%20from%202015)|[460,295,677](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IND/india/urban-population#:~:text=India%20urban%20population%20for%202019,a%202.35%25%20increase%20from%202015)|\n\nI made this table cause it is a known fact that urban areas generate and contribute more to GDP. So here China improved by around 383 million while India improved by 230 million. China has done much better in urbanising the country. I would say they are also better in slum demolition and building urban infrastructure. Mostly due to lack of protests as they undergo "removal"\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nChina also started like us, starting with assembling and slowly moving up the value chains. Look at them now. They do many things better than India currently but in time, it should improve.\n\nCountries like Japan and Korea have benefitted from being allies to the US. Japan had started after WWII when it surrendered and also took aid from the US after WWII and during the Cold War of which benefitted Japan. Korea was also benefitted by America, especially after the Korean war. They had pretty much started from the 60s and had many protectionist policies of where they only imported raw  materials. As said before, India started economic reforms in 1991. Both Japan and Korea took more than 20 years from start of economic reforms to have a GDP per capita of around $1700-$2000. Racists will say that "brown people bad, streetshitters, low IQ"\n\nAlso, did you know [China\'s first bullet train was in 2002?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_maglev_train) This was when China was at India\'s 2009 economic position so on a GDP per capita of around $1,100. Now India is building it though Uddhav Thackery is being a massive a\\*\\*hole in Maharashtra, sorry to share my political opinion of this but its true.\n\nThough of course, China can get things done faster. Especially things like slum demolishing and shutting up environmentalists when it comes to infrastructure. Even when it comes to setting up a business, China is much better than India. India\'s rank is much worse than China when it comes to starting up a business. Roughly it takes 2 weeks to do that in India and it takes half of that in China. Chinese bureaucracy is much better.\n\nI just kept this post brief so that I don\'t bore you. Both countries still have ways to go and over time things WILL get better.'<br />Author: 'plebman1125'  id: 'lqawud'<br />Score:53<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lqawud/a_brief_comparison_of_india_and_china/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Any opinion about my idea?'<br />Body: 'Hi,\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Abhishek and I am a 3rd year Engineering student. I am a game developer and I just want to do something “different” in my life. Now lets get on the topic.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt traces back to Sushant Singh case. Lock-down was going on and I got enough time to give a peek on T.V news (Usually I don’t watch T.V). And I was simply shocked by the manner in which news channel covered the topic. Whether the related party got deserving justice is something which can be debated later on, but the way with which news was covered was completely disastrous. More time was spent on shouting rather than on facts. It was more like:- “the louder you shout, more correct your fact will become”. Immediately I decided that I will surely do something regarding it. The cool thing:- I will use my game development skills for the same\r\n\r\n(Mid-point stopper:- If my opinion regarding news channel offended you then I am really sorry from the core of my heart. It was just my opinion. I mean whole experience could have been made much better)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd there was another reason. I noticed that all news sources:- whether news channel, website based news outlets, YouTube channels etc ONLY cover one side of the news. Also they cater to left/right or to a particular community and hence the viewer does not get the whole concept at the same time. And worse, some groups in our society do not even get opportunity to communicate to the masses (infinite reasons are there).In short, no one is neutral. I want to create a platform which will belong and cater to all:-different castes, left, right, different religions, different states, EVERYONE (We will come back here later on).I want a total neutral platform\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I spend approx 6 months in creating a graphics engine which automatically combines audio, videos, images, text etc into a beautiful video. Infact it is brilliant enough to convert text into speech (I don’t have to narrate anything, computer automatically does that). In this way it would be easy for me to create professional quality videos in less time (whole process is automatic hence saves a lot of time). Some Examples:-\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/kXC9aZ9hn2U\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/1rht37nV7P0\r\n\r\n\r\nPlan of the platform which I was talking about:-I will create a YouTube channel where I will upload videos of 4 types:-\r\n\r\n1.) Top Headlines News(around 30-40 headlines will be covered in a video).\r\n\r\n2.) Quotes. (20 quotes will be there in a video).\r\n\r\n3.) News videos which will target single topics (e.g. “Current status of farmers protest in India”)\r\n\r\n4.) “Cascade Unedited”, for which you are currently reading this LONG MESSAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn “Cascade Unedited”, other contributors (maybe you in the future) belonging from different communities and groups of the society will give content for the video. I will feed the contents into the engine and then upload on YouTube. It has multiple advantages:-\r\n\r\n1.) It will give opportunity to represent your ideas. Imagine your voice getting amplified to whole nation. And the best part:- the content will be viewed by all sections of the society which itself is the most important (and awesome) part of this point\r\n\r\n2.) It is a brilliant way to get a taste of journalism. Everyone can’t just start the journey of journalism. And obviously the credit of the video will be given to the contributor, and hence it can be used to enhance his/her resume. And even group-contribution can do wonders and I will surely plan on that too.\r\n\r\n3.) A brilliant way to group together. Example:- at the end of the video, a message can be added like “come to this community in Reddit/anywhere where like-minded can spend time together and exchange ideas” or “we are conducting a twitter storm. Surely give a participation”.\r\n\r\n4.) It will give voice to your community to whom you/your group will represent.\r\n\r\n5.) Everything will be professional. I will work very hard to make the whole concept work flawlessly\r\n\r\n6.) Overall the whole concept is neutral.\r\n\r\n7.) The contributors will absolutely not have to work hard to contribute something. Just text and few related images are required to make a cool video.\r\n\r\n8.) The contributor will decide whether the video will be monetised or not. It will solely be their decision\r\n\r\n9.) Overall my news channel will cover content from all different parts of society(left, right, different castes and classes etc). In this way channel will remain neutral and will cater to whole India. And strategically I will always remain one step ahead of other YouTube rivals. And I guess that no one has done this before.\r\n\r\n(Later on I will provide the engine to others so that the whole process becomes much easy)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are your opinions about my idea? Any advise, criticism, ideas regarding the whole concept? How well my graphics engine works? PLEASE surely provide the feedback. And sorry in advance for grammatical mistakes\r\n\r\nThanks for reading till here. It matters a lot to me.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don’t know much about Reddit and different communities. If there is a community where I should post this message then please tell that too. I will also post the message there'<br />Author: 'Cascade_Video_Game'  id: 'loxcny'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/loxcny/any_opinion_about_my_idea/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Is Coronil a WHO approved medicine?'<br />Body: '**No,** Coronil is not a "WHO approved medicine". It is manufactured in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices guidelines set by WHO to manufacture drugs. Basically like a ISO-9000 rating for pharmaceutical companies. The Certificate of Pharmaceutical Products is only a form that lists information about the exporting/importing parties, license number etc and has nothing to do with drug efficacy.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate\\_of\\_pharmaceutical\\_product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_pharmaceutical_product)\n\n**Is Coronil bogus?**\n\n**No,** the Patanjali Research Institute has published good, peer-reviewed scientific studies in decent journals on the effects of this medicine\n\nJournal of Inflammatory Research (Impact Factor 4.9): [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33414643/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33414643/)\n\n* Shows that inflammation and behavioral fever in zebrafish viral model is reduced\n\nMolecules (IF 3.2): [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33147850/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33147850/)\n\n* Shows that inflammation and cell death is reduced in zebrafish implanted with human lung epithelial cells\n\nPhytomedicine (IF 4.1): [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32795904/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32795904/)\n\n* Shows that lung inflammation and airway blockage is relieved in mouse asthma models\n\nThis is actually quite impressive, and I wasn\'t expecting such good research. Concentrations of drugs used were human relevant (they say). They say they are also doing clinical trials. I am not a toxicologist, so I cannot vouch for the trueness of their results, but I presume it went through proper peer review at the above journals.\n\n**Is Coronil safe to use?**\n\nAt [this link](https://twitter.com/PypAyurved/status/1362639239297396736/photo/1), Patanjali Ayurved says they have completed preclinical studies and toxicological studies of Coronil and Divya-Swasari-Vati, however, I haven\'t been able to find any publications. Herbal medicines, at low doses, are generally fine. Many Ayurvedic medicines have been found to have heavy metal contamination from all the groundwater and soil contamination, so taking lots of any Ayurvedic medicine can have adverse consequences. I don\'t know how much GMP reduces that, and whether Patanjali has good sourcing practices. \n\n**Can Coronil stop Covid-19?**\n\n**This is going to be next to impossible task for a herbal treatment.** Even AYUSH, which recognizes Homeopathy as a medicinal system, asked Patanjali to stop making claims about Coronil being a cure, and simply an immune booster. It might have an effect on relieving the symptoms or making infections milder (like taking Vitamin D). However, if people start popping pills to stop Covid-19 without taking precautions like social distancing, masks and vaccinations then its going to be a problem.\n\n**Takeaway**\n\nYou\'ll see posts on the "official sub" ridiculing Patanjali and Ramdev. They\'ll say racist stuff about bhakhths and cow piss. However, know that there is some good science being done in India. We have ways to go before competing with the west on drug R&amp;D, but credit where credit is due. Patanjali Research Institute is taking some efforts for basic R&amp;D, which is great. At the same time, hopefully, valid critique about the shortcomings of herbal medicines doesn\'t get drowned by jingoistic voices - otherwise the bar for the gold standard will be set very low.'<br />Author: 'dherpotya'  id: 'lor8nm'<br />Score:28<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lor8nm/is_coronil_a_who_approved_medicine/</li>

This article was written in 2019, a time when majority Chinese still know nothing about India, but start to be curious about this country. With the Modi’s visit to China, the atmosphere is looking good, and people starting discussing investments in India, which is also a reason Luke did this investigation. This article later became very, very popular in China(my estimation about its viewership should be at least 5M) and is in fact the first article many Chinese have read about India.\n2. This article contains another half, I will finish it later as it was published separated.\n3. The title “**Report of the investigation of India**”\xa0is a tribute to Chairman Mao’s essay “[Report of the investigation of peasant movements in Hunan](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_2.htm)”, which is the very first article of the book " SELECTED WORKS OF MAO TSE-TUNG "\n4.

My translator\xa0called him in Tamil on the roadside. Natarajan bent down and washed his hands, smiled and walked barefoot to me from\xa0the farmland.\n\nIt was the last one good weather before I left India. The sun was shining, and Natarajan looked\xa0pretty dark in the distance. He is a Dravidian, with junior high school education. His eyes were deep, beard and hair were white. He was wearing\xa0a white towel\xa0and was barebacked, and showing an optimistic spirit from inside.\xa0When he saw me, a\xa0Chinese visitor, he smiled, walked onto the lawn and shook my hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Natarajan](https://preview.redd.it/igphzps1xni61.png?width=200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57c0d18e1d69ba7198d0a29d15660258503d57e9)\n\nThis village is about 90 kilometers away from Chennai. I did not plan\xa0to meet Natarajan\xa0originally. One day ago, I visited a stone carving factory around Chennai to learn about their handicraft industry. It was too late when we returned, and we later\xa0encountered a truck stuck in the mud and couldn’t keep moving on some\xa0country road, resulting we\xa0stayed there for quite a while. There were\xa0weeds on both sides of the path, no lights can be seen around\xa0and the Milky Way was\xa0clearly visible. The air was\xa0fresh, and only car lights illuminated\xa0the road ahead.\n\nThe truck did not sink so deep, but it blocked the way, and a tattered minibus also stopped\xa0with us later. A lot of\xa0villagers walked down and started watching\xa0around. A large group of Indians gathered in front of the trunk and started discussing\xa0in Tamil, but after for a long time, there is still no way.\n\nA few Chinese oversea students(they\xa0learned that I came to Chennai and asked to accompany me\xa0for a day) and I were got off the car for some air too. Then there were some women coming in groups from a small road in the distance, passing by us, walking fast, then disappear in the dark night in rural India. These groups of women\xa0came after waves after waves, which aroused my curiosity. At that time, the translator was negotiating with the owner of the truck, so\xa0I asked the students why these women walk\xa0around outside at night, in such a remote place that no light can be seen. This is clearly not the way for shopping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Countryside women passing by us](https://preview.redd.it/nyaddktlxni61.png?width=349&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a51ebf6fa6d0fa72e97f513e6337d66afbd2110a)\n\nAn international student said that they were not going to shopping, they were going to the toilet. Some rural India did not have toilets, so they have to do it\xa0on some spots\xa0in the wild. These women\xa0were worried about getting harassed, so they go out in groups. According to Hinduism, toilets are dirty places, and toilets cannot be built at home. This is particularly serious in rural areas. Therefore, some rural Indian women can only use toilets twice a day, once in the early morning and once at night, and have to\xa0hold it during the day.\n\nI have done some research\xa0before and know some information\xa0about this, but when I saw it with my own eyes that there were still countless wtf\xa0in my heart. At this time, the translator came back. I asked him about the statistics of toileting in the wild in rural areas of India. He said that in 2018 according to the official government statistics, 44% of the rural population defecate in the wild, and 40% of Indian women have never used sanitary napkins. It is better in urban areas, and 77% of women have used sanitary napkins. Watching\xa0women passing by\xa0in groups , hearing these statistics and seeing the them disappearing in groups in the distance, I was shocked and speechless for a while.\n\nThe truck was never rescued, so we had to make a detour back to downtown Chennai. The road we chose passes through towns and villages, but no matter where we are, we can see countless cattle herds. Some five or six lying in the middle of the road sleeping, some a dozen walking slowly on the sidewalk, and some were gnawing on the green plants on the road. I didn\'t see so many cows during the daytime. At night, the temperature was cool and the whole family of cows came out to enjoy the cold. Highways in India are generally two-lane\xa0roads, and if the cow stands\xa0in the middle, there won’t be too\xa0much space left for vehicles. I saw a bus decorated in a rural heavy metal style, playing music while skillfully bypassing the cows in the middle of the road, and swiftly driving far away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cows on the road at night](https://preview.redd.it/i9qcsaboyni61.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea248beb0169850354c3ad9e822f846477783cdd)\n\nAs there are too many cows on the road, I couldn’t help asking the driver, what would happen\xa0if you hit a cow? It is inevitable that you will bump into it once. The driver said that these cows all have their owners. If you\xa0hit them, you\xa0will probably have to pay 10k-15k rupees.\n\nThat night, the women going to the toilet and the flood of cows in the countryside, aroused my deep curiosity about rural India. I asked the interpreter to cancel the opportunity to communicate with a university teacher in Chennai, diverted to a village 90 kilometers away, and met Nataraja walking from the field.\n\n**Part Two**\n\n**Farmer and Countryside**\n\nNatarajan has two children and two daughters, both of whom are married and have their own children now. He has 3acres of land in the village, all of which grow rice, and he can harvest a little more than two tons of rice in one season. India has a great\xa0climate for agriculture and can harvest three times\xa0a year, which means that his field can harvest more than 6 tons of rice a year.\n\nI thought I had heard it wrong. I asked the translator and said you did not translate it wrong, right? The translator said that it was correct. I said this data is too weird. Is it really correct? The translator asked again and said yes, he confirmed that it was correct, and it was indeed 3 acres and 2 tons. In 2014, when the SCMP\xa0reported about\xa0Yuan Longping(a Chinese agriculture expert, famous for cultivating rice), it says\xa0that China’s yield per mu(Chinese land unit)\xa0is more than 450 Kg\xa0a harvest. The difference in rice harvests between China and India is so great. I quickly checked it out\xa0on internet, and the data showed that the Indian rice harvest was indeed an average of 2 tons per hectare.\n\nMr. Min Zongdian had a paper "Discussion on Rice Yield per Mu in the Taihu Lake Area during the Song, Ming and Qing Dynasties", which stated that the yield per mu was 138 Kg in the Tang Dynasty, 225 Kg in the Song Dynasty, 333 Kg in the Ming Dynasty, and 278 Kg  in the Qing Dynasty. If we calculate on the basis of each harvest, the current output in a single harvest in India has not reached the average level of China during the Ming and Qing dynasties.\n\nThe main reason for the backwardness of agriculture in India is insufficient irrigation\xa0system and lacking of agricultural machinery. India has 160-170 million hectares of arable land, and China has only 120-130 million (2013 statistics). India can harvest three times\xa0a year, and China generally can do two. According to the World Bank\'s 2017 data, China produced the world\'s highest grain output, reaching 617.9 million tons. India ranked the third with 331.6 million tons, only half of China\'s.\n\nBut if you look at it from another angle, India\'s low food production also proves that they have huge\xa0potential to improve. I will talk about it\xa0later parts.\n\nAfter\xa0confirming\xa0the yield of rice, I consulted Natarajan about his income. Natarajan said that besides the whole family’s own food, the extra food will be sold on the market at a price of 16 rupees\xa0per Kg. (Later I went to supermarkets\xa0in Chennai and found that the price of cheapest rice was\xa038 rupee\xa0per\xa0Kg. This purchase price is reasonable.) Natarajan has a net profit of 100K rupees per year after selling\xa0crops. He also raised a cow and ten chickens. Natarajan is\xa0quite satisfied about his life.\n\nNatarajan then took me to visit his new home, which is a newly renovated two-story building, simple and practical. Here I met his son, who is in his thirties and looks an decent man. I asked his son about how he makes a living. He said that he works in a nearby shoe factory run by a Taiwanese and earns about 15k rupees a month. I nodded and said that these Taiwanese shoe factories may come from from Dongguan(a city in China). His son did not understand what I meant. It was\xa0difficult to explain the global migration of the industrial chain to him\xa0by translating, and he left after a while. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Natarajan\'s new house](https://preview.redd.it/8y06z9ti0oi61.png?width=208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65a899096e34d2d05b8c0734d5fba82321b70e85)\n\nBecause Natarajan was very cooperative with us, I told the translator if I could give some money to thank him. Another villager nearby heard that, and took me into his house to visit too. His house is very simple, much like many old 1990s rural China homes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Natarajan\'s son, a decent man](https://preview.redd.it/ocrmylgk0oi61.png?width=185&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5b052348294790a3a52172805940d295503e8ca)\n\nI wandered around for a little and asked him\xa0how many acres of land he had. He said that he had no land and made a living by making textiles. I noticed this and asked Natarajan that if everybody\xa0has some land, and he\xa0said that there are 4000 villagers in this village, and only half of them have land and the others have to find ways to survive. I felt that I found\xa0the core\xa0problem, and asked if there is a big landlord in this village (the translator discussed with me for a\xa0quite a while\xa0to figure out how to say it in Tamil). Natarajan said that some people in the village have 200-300 acres, while ordinary people usually only have 2-3 acres. I nodded and said yes, this is the truth about the rural problem.\n\nNatarajan went on to say that these people with a lot of fields eventually became politicians, and rural government officials would be their people. I said yes. This is in line with economic laws. Such things will definitely happen to private land ownership in the world,  land consolidation will definitely occur, and big landlords will bind economic and political power at the grassroots level.\n\nThe translator said you have anything else to ask? I said no more. I have written about South America before and talked about the final flow of people who lost their land in the rural areas of Mexico and Brazil. The whole world is the same. When half of the people in rural areas have no land, many of them\xa0have only one place to go.\n\nThat place is called a slum.\n\n**Part Three**\n\n**Slum**\n\nMumbai has the largest Dharavi slum in Asia. On the second day of my arrival in Mumbai, I asked the translator\xa0to find a native man as tour guide to visit Dharavi first. Here is the destined foothold of the rural refugees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Dharavi, Mumbai](https://preview.redd.it/2y39jlyf1oi61.png?width=266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10798b1c47232b86c17bcb27d2120d7675769be6)\n\nThe slum has formed its own internal loop, which is an independent system. It is not only a place to sleep, but also a variety of workshops, small factories, schools, clinics. I found bag workshops, leather workshops, clothing workshops, dye workshops, pottery workshops, etc. When the leather workers were spraying paint, I asked them what lacquer they were using. When the dye workshop was dyeing the fabric, I\xa0asked\xa0about their wages (12 hours a day, 300 rupees). On a banquet specially hosting weddings,\xa0I also found a few Dalits (untouchables) who specialize in dirty works. They were very shy and when we wanted to take them for a photo, they only\xa0came over after they went back and changed into clean clothes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[clothing workshop](https://preview.redd.it/h12j37mo1oi61.png?width=298&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa73da53d8157dc4dc508cfbe893b91ecdbdfc2e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A man in a leather workshop](https://preview.redd.it/e78pp5zq1oi61.png?width=271&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a446d96cedcb9d18e94eaa4b88df34480803b4f0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[dye workshop](https://preview.redd.it/hl7ld01t1oi61.png?width=293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f777293636e67a83781539e62a0de5d04c39e66)\n\nThese people in the slums live here, eat here, and work here. The children who born here will also receive education in the slum schools. This is an internal circulation system that does not interfere with the outside world much. India’s elite class is completely disconnected from the slum class, and there are two completely different ecological chains that do not interact with each other. So India’s richest man can build\xa0a 27-story, one-billion-dollar mansion in Mumbai, and next to him is a small slum. Both sides live their own lives without conflicts\xa0at all.\n\nLife in the slums can be really terrible. I saw a lot of homeless people on the slum streets. A whole family can only sleep\xa0on the sidewalks of the slums, and all their belongings were a stove for making a fire, and a few black and white quilts, no rooftop.\xa0When it rains, they can only go to the designated place as shelter. When taking pictures of them, I always leave as soon as I finish, for concerns of arousing their sensitivity on dignity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A homeless family on a street, the whole family lives besides this wall](https://preview.redd.it/y7solcjd2oi61.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=004dc2b6117f4629b0041a04580881848ec217a1)\n\nMost residents live in houses of 6-8 square meters, which is too small that it can’t even fit a proper\xa0bed inside. The house can\xa0be divided into bunks and a small bed will be hung on the wall in the middle of the house. If children need to take a bath, they can find a bucket to do it. Washing clothes are also solved at the door of each house. There is no toilet in the house, and an average of 1,000 people share a public toilet. I didn’t dare to go into it when I walked on the door of that public toilet. I’m not someone didn’t experienced public toilets of 1980s China.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A family in a slum, 6-8 square meters. The whole family lives here.](https://preview.redd.it/icp3nwvq2oi61.png?width=287&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99b410894ab17306783cd4b117ecb25b2cf0ac9f)\n\nNext to the street in the slum, there is a dark bar with a few simple tables and chairs, with a thin cloth blocking the door, and selling self-made wine inside, which tastes a bit close to Chinese rice wine. There is also a little gym\xa0with fitness coaches sit in and welcome guests. There are people selling fruits, snacks, and clothing on the sides\xa0of roads. The clothes there are so cheap, like a piece for 50-100 rupees. This\xa0ensure that Dharavi’s people don’t have to go to the streets naked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A little bar in slum](https://preview.redd.it/yyuyaoo03oi61.png?width=313&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38e9431b1c8e98bf14e3cd96e15174c4ebde7a9c)\n\nTheir vegetables are also very cheap. Chinese students told me that when they go\xa0to the cheapest vegetable market, all vegetables they need for a 10-people hot pot only cost 150 rupees. People from the slums work in small workshops here, earning a salary of about 10K rupees, drinking the small wine and eating the small dishes here. Although the quality of life is cheap, all the necessities of life are readily available.\n\nThere is also a free kindergarten in the slum. Although it looks very shabby, it can help taking care of children aged 2-4. I also visited two elementary schools here, and caught the principal of one of them and asked him about the free education system in India.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A classroom and the teacher](https://preview.redd.it/nool3c1e3oi61.png?width=266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c3573acff6f2c3047f0bc870632e72ab3db0bc0)\n\nThe principal said that the Indian government is indeed implementing a free education system for children under15 years old, but it simply cannot afford to pay as teachers must\xa0live on wages. A new teacher starts with a monthly salary of 15k, and senior teachers can get up to 50k rupees. Therefore, the tuition fee in their school is 14k\xa0a year. If the husband and wife both work and the family’s monthly income reaches about 20k, they can barely afford two or three\xa0children\'s education. School outside the slums costs 35k\xa0a year, which is simply too much.\n\nThe local who accompanied me said that he has two daughters going to school here. The educators in India are still very upright. There are children who can’t afford the tuition, and this respectable principal says he will help them continue their studies at his own expense. .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The respectable principal of this little school](https://preview.redd.it/wbv8tift3oi61.png?width=265&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0550cd3bfdbc8e11274530abcc37752fb6e48cc1)\n\nAlthough slums are dirty and run-down, they are too important for the local people at the bottom. It represents a set of the cheapest service system, providing cheap but complete food, housing, entertainment, and education systems so that the people at the bottom can survive.\n\nMany people from wealthy countries see the slums and\xa0their first reaction is to demolish these places and build fancy buildings. This kind of thinking is simple and rude and violates economic laws. Once the slums are demolished the people at the bottom will lose their last shelter, they will not be able to afford the high cost of living outside, which will cause huge social unrest, and the government will pay an heavy price. Killing slums will kill the rich. For no matter which class, slums is necessary.\n\n**The dilapidated slums in downtown Mumbai are the band-aids of the Indian economy, supporting the bottom line of the survival of the displaced people and preventing the situation from worsening.**\n\n**Part four**\n\n**Living Costs**\n\nIn addition to food, work, and education, the most important things in the daily lives of civilians are transportation, housing and medical care.\n\nThe transportation in India is very cheap, and an 8-hour train ride costs only 300 Rupees. At the Mumbai Railway Station, I deliberately climbed a few trains to look into the internal carriages, and the seats inside looks quite messy.\xa0There are no ticket inspectors at the railway station, free entry and exit. Wild dogs and crows\xa0walk\xa0everywhere on the train platform. The dogs here in India are very, very docile,\xa0I did not hear a\xa0single\xa0barking in my trip. Some dogs slept unscrupulously on the steps of the Mumbai Railway Station, and pedestrians just\xa0walk around them.\n\nWhen the local driver took me to visit the railway station, we stood on a crowded platform and watched the workers maintaining\xa0the rails. The driver said that anyone can get on the train at any time. In fact, the trains in the city don\'t check the tickets very much. It is more like some form of kindness\xa0for the poor.\n\nThere was a train coming when we were chatting, but I didn’t see the door and asked the driver what’s wrong. The driver said that there was not only no door, but no air-conditioning too. In addition, no air-conditioning was actually for needs\xa0of the passengers, because this could reduce the fare, which can\xa0be a small saving\xa0about 300 rupees a month.\n\nIf you drive by yourself, the price of oil in India is slightly more expensive than that in China. The price of diesel is 77 rupees\xa0per liter, 92 gasoline is 85 rupees\xa0per liter, and 95 gasoline is 88 rupees\xa0per liter.\n\nAlthough transportation is cheap, housing is expensive. The per capita income in Mumbai is about 16k rupees, but the average house price is 6,485 USD per square meter (2018 data). It takes more than 200 years for an average office worker to afford a house. Of course, the prices in Mumbai are different for different\xa0areas. The price in the remote suburbs is 20k rupees\xa0per square meter, and near the hotel where I live, it is more than 1M rupees.\n\nIn Trivandrum, I also met a group of fishermen. At that time, we were driving by the road\xa0and passing by them.\xa0The fishermen were sitting under a shed and gathering fishing nets. The translator said if I were interested in learning about their lives. After saying yes, we stopped the car and walked towards the group of fishermen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Fishermen on their nets](https://preview.redd.it/b7pw9h595oi61.png?width=284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e69c7839d581356af7110d020a501e222cee7e33)\n\nThe interpreter told them that a Chinese wanted to come and chat with them. The fishermen smiled and said that we\xa0had to pay. I took out 200 rupees from my wallet and the fishermen began to answer my questions.\n\nThese fishermen are all locals and have been fishing for living. They drive a speedboat to fish on the sea about 50-60 kilometers away, which is distance reaching their cost limit. The cost of each trip to fishing is about 10k rupees at most, or they would burn too much oil farther away. Because of overfishing and backward equipment and technology,\xa0they have not caught any\xa0for three days, and they can only make up the fishing net here\xa0now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[An woman\xa0selling fish](https://preview.redd.it/j39iwb8h5oi61.png?width=359&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8ab9c6b3afca0a6caf6c44dd2a9d0374dde85e7)\n\nFortunately, the Indian government stipulates that if they live in a place for 15 years and this land becomes theirs. They can then use the land certificate for mortgage from bank to build a house, so they still have a place to live in. Of these fishermen’s families, 70% have someone\xa0who has education and can find a decent job to subsidize the family, and 30% of the families have never studied and can only do some hard work to earn cash.\n\nBecause the fishermen are too poor, the government gave them a privilege. In designated supermarkets, ordinary people buy rice for 40 rupees\xa0per Kg, and they can live on for only 2 rupees\xa0per\xa0Kg.\n\nThere are a large number of poor people in India, so what should they\xa0do if get sick? I went to a public hospital in Mumbai to do some research. The translator specially selected a good public hospital to show me, for national pride maybe? It was a hospital built during the British colonial period. The appearance is quite classical, but from the entrance of this hospital I observed that all patients are obviously poor people with a disheveled face. They sit in the shade of the tree in twos and threes, or lie down on the deck chairs, and full of gloom. The translator took me down to the\xa0corridor and couldn\'t help but say: "How about\xa0this? Isn\'t this hospital quite good?" He was expecting some compliment. What can I say? I followed his expectations and nodded: "Not bad, not bad."\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Inside a public hospital](https://preview.redd.it/4nqsidc66oi61.png?width=263&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6110a0204a025fe3bbcae7664939f43f672c0fc8)\n\nThe doctor we had originally made an appointment was too busy to accept the interview. The translator cheekily knocked on the door of an administrator of the hospital and told him that there is\xa0a Chinese who came to understand the medical situation in India (praise the translator!). This person\'s name was CHAVAN, and after thinking about it, he agreed to my interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CHAVAN from the\xa0public hospital](https://preview.redd.it/0qy6ul2a6oi61.png?width=231&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da490d97edb14ccc217fc7863673e12e213bd9a7)\n\nAccording to CHAVAN, this hospital is pure public. It receives 5000-6000 patients every day, of which more than 1000 are in emergency department. Poor people from every state in India can come here for treatment, but because of distance, it mainly treat the poor from their own state. He especially highlighted the word "poor" because this is mainly for families with an annual income of less than 20k rupees. The government will make something like an ID certificate for each poor people, with the annual family income written on it. Poor people can come to the hospital for treatment based on this certificate. In order to prevent cheating, that certificate will be\xa0checked once a year. Mumbai has a complete public medical system with a total of 17 public hospitals with 22,000 beds, and more than 1,000 clinics can provide services for people at the bottom. \n\nCHAVAN said that for ordinary emergency departments, they will arrange a diagnosis in 2-3 hours, and ordinary patients will wait 2-3 days before they can arrange treatment. If the patient need\xa0a simple operation, the hospital charges are free, but if it is a complicated operation, the patient is still responsible for the cost of materials and medicine.\n\nAfter the interview, in order to ensure data\xa0is accurate, I randomly caught some college students who do internship in this hospital and asked them the same questions. These people say that ordinary patients have to wait for more than 15 days to see a doctor, sometimes even a few months, and it is impossible to get treatment\xa0in 2-3 days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Two interns\xa0in the public hospital](https://preview.redd.it/bxawhdz17oi61.png?width=259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf1dde9066fa41269e4cb0f6e5b954668ceddd58)\n\nIn fact, from the perspective of economic laws, no matter whether the country is rich or poor, the free medical system has almost always been inefficient and low-quality\xa0comparing the private ones. This free medical system in India is a low-efficiency benefit for the poor in India and cannot be universalized to the whole society.\n\n**Part five** \n\n**Some summary**\n\nAfter getting a little understanding of the basic living conditions of the Indian people, let\'s make a brief summary.\n\nIn order to make a detailed survey of income data, I asked people on the street about their salary income whenever\xa0I saw someone like a psychopath. The translator finally had enough and ask first without me requesting lol.\n\nThe land-lost farmers in countryside at the lowest level do not have a stable income and earn a little money by raising chickens, ducks or working as laborers.\n\nThe low-level female labor in the city, will do part-time housework, cleaning,\xa0washing clothes, sweeping and mopping the floor, etc., go for one or two hours for a family, and charges each family for 2k-3k rupees per month, and they run several houses a day. The monthly income can reach 6k-10krupees.\n\nMen at the bottom can\xa0go do car washing jobs. Washing\xa0once a day cost 600 rupees\xa0for a month. They will contract multiple cars a month to survive (as can be seen from these two cases,\xa0India\'s bottom labor is extremely cheap, and supply exceeds demand).\n\nThe monthly salary of a full-time cleaner\xa0is about 6k-8k rupees, and a waiter is generally less than 10k rupees, and a tuk-tuk driver has a monthly salary of about 6k-8k rupees\xa0(some cars of drivers are rented, and the rent should be additionally calculated).\n\nThe monthly salary of teachers in public schools starts at 10k, usually around 15k, and teachers in private schools start at 20k, usually around 30-40k rupees.\n\nThe monthly salary of a full-time UBER driver is about 15k-20k, and a railway worker earns 15k rupees\xa0a month.\n\nThe salary of most serious ordinary professionals in big cities in India is 15k rupees\xa0a month (the results from Mumbai and Chennai are about the same), programmers start at 18k, and senior programmers can get 60k rupees\xa0a month. When I was in Mumbai, I went to Google’s headquarters in India, and some passers-by said that programmers start working at Google for 30k rupees\xa0(this information may not be accurate). As of cities, the income of an ordinary office worker in India is about 1/3 to 1/5 of that of an ordinary office worker in China. \n\n**Judging from the countries I have traveled to, I found two very interesting patterns.**\n\nThe first is that consumption prices in the world are actually almost the same and fluctuate within a small range. \n\nThere are two types of living prices in India. One is the prices in supermarkets, which are similar to those in China, and the other is the prices in the farmer\'s market and slums, which are extremely cheap. You\xa0can buy 7 tomatoes\xa0with15 rupees. But majority Indians still can\'t hide from consumption upgrades such as buying a house, buying a car, and go seeing a doctor in a private hospital, and these prices are about the same as in China. The overall house price is slightly lower than that in China. Entry-level Suzuki cars sell for about 300K\xa0rupees in India, and imported cars are 30% more expensive than China.\n\nOrdinary Indians can buy a motorcycle, take a salary of 10k rupees, and live a complete and cheap life in a slum, but it is very difficult for them to complete the class transition.\n\nThe second is that wage income is relatively uniform throughout the world. The salary income for\xa0ordinary people in developing countries is 10k-30k\xa0rupees and that of those in developed countries is 80k-200k rupees. If the average wage in a developing country is less than\xa010k rupees, the people of this country must be living in dire straits (because the prices for global consumption\xa0system are\xa0similar).

      <li>Title::: 'Do some Indians have naturally high dopamine levels?'<br />Body: "Dopamine is the 'feel good' hormone that's strongly associated with pleasure and reward. The problem with having too much dopamine released into our body after doing a certain pleasure-seeking activity is, we get addicted. \n\nOn a less-serious level, we become less productive because we could not stop watching online videos, pornography, being active on social media or play video games. On a serious level, we destroy our health because of alcohol, drugs and cigarettes. \n\nWhile this is a problem the world over, I was wondering if some Indians have much more difficult time to control instant pleasure activities because of high dopamine release. Taking alcohol as an example, while there are alcoholics in other societies, the problem isn't as severe a notable percentage of Indian men, who are complete slaves to it. \n\nFeel free to comment on this.

In his own words, Pieter Friedrich proclaims:\n\n&gt;"I\'m a Christian, foremost [...] but ultimately, I believe in constitutional republican Christian theocracy"\n\nInterestingly, he consistently promotes Fr. Joshua Lickter, a Christian priest as an effort to "collaborate" across Sikhism and Christianity. According to his LinkedIn job description he says:\n\n&gt;"I have over ten years of ministry experience in various areas, though mostly it seems I have been called to reach people on the "fringe" who would not normally go to church. I would like to continue utilizing those gifts by planting churches and ministries interested in reaching folks who normally avoid church."\n\nPieter Friedrich also maintains an organization called "Singh of Judah". Interestingly in its official Facebook page cover displays the quote, " And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. - Luke 2:10," and the page prominently features similar Christian priests (even though it is portrayed as Sikh organization).\n\n\nSources:\n\n[The curious case of the resurgence of Khalistani groups and their ally Evangelical theocrat Pieter Friedrich](https://archive.is/pbikN)\n\n[Singh vs. Singh: The Sikhs behind one faction at Fremont\'s Gurdwara are linked to violence and drugs.

Soros and Fori, both born in Hungary, have been exchanging correspondence over the years.\n\n&gt;After retirement, B K Nehru — a cousin of Indira Gandhi, he was Ambassador to the United States in the late 1950s and nearly succeeded Dag Hammarskjold as United Nations Secretary General — settled in Kasauli with Fori. He died in 2001 but Fori, who is called Shobha Aunty by all who know her, stayed put in the Kasauli bungalow.\n\n&gt;The meeting between Soros and Fori was arranged at her son Anil Nehru\'s residence in Sector 9, Chandigarh. Soros reached Chandigarh at 2 pm, flying in from Delhi on a chartered Kingfisher plane. Anil was there at the airport to receive him and they headed straight to the Sector 9 house. \n\n&gt;When contacted, Anil Nehru said: "This is a personal visit and no family member, including my mother, has anything to say on this."

      <li>Title::: 'Left-Wing ‘Secularism’ Narrative'<br />Body: 'Try and understand the ‘RW’ perspective.   \n\nSecularism means that each individual should have the ability to practice their own religion freely, and thus there should be no state interference. Let’s be clear, Hindus have always been secular, our religion itself allows for so much freedom. We freely visit Masjids, Churches, Gurudwaras. We celebrate festivals like Christmas. We have no problems if a Muslim or Christian or anyone else practices their own religion.  \n\nOur issue is that the ‘liberals’ of the country put the entire onus of upholding secularism on us. The intolerant Abrahamic religions are given a free pass, and they freely attack our culture, our identity. They call us Kaffirs, cow worshippers, demonic cults. They freely mock our gods, but one word against their Prophet and they will burn a neighbourhood (Bangalore).They blast their Azaan freely, but one Jai Shree Ram near their houses and they will lynch or stone us (Rinku Sharma). They spend billions converting Hindus to increase their numbers, and then when they become majority, they commit Genocides to literally murder us and drive us out of our homes (Kashmir). Then we are labelled as communal and fascist, and they are simply ‘peaceful’ :) One Hindu commits a crime, all Hindus are generalised as oppressive and communal, a Muslim commits a crime, he is called an anomaly who doesn’t represent the majority. The hypocrisy is ridiculous.    \n\nJust look at any Islamic country in the world, are they secular? Can you freely practice Hinduism there and not live in fear everyday?  Muslims are and have always been hostile to other faiths. \nSo the truth is that Islam in fact is in fact incredibly intolerant, and the ‘RW’ Hindu movement is in PROTEST of their intolerance. They aren’t some helpless minority in India, there are over 200 million Muslims in the country. If THEY were secular, then there would be absolutely no issues. Why are there no issues between Hindus and Jains/Buddhists/Parsis? Because we are all tolerant faiths that respect everyone.    \n\nNo longer can Hindus tolerate their intolerance. We’re expect us to be pro-secularism and weak while these Abrahamic religions remain intolerant. That’s not how it works, for secularism to work EVERYONE has to support it and embrace tolerance. Why doesn’t anyone ever question Islam’s lack of support for secularism? Because if they do, they will get beheaded, and that is the crux of the REAL issue. The RW Hindu movement is the only thing actually fighting for the survival of secularism in India. To all the atheists out there, you think you would be safe in an Islamic theocracy loudly declaring that God doesn’t exist? Just look at Pakistan, who literally have the same blood/genes as us, the only difference being their dominant religion, and you have the answer.    \n\nStart talking about the real problem.'<br />Author: 'itiswhatitis2323'  id: 'ln8jvs'<br />Score:48<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ln8jvs/leftwing_secularism_narrative/</li>

There was absolutely NO way for us to get free from him in the past, God knows I've thought of it and questioned my choices every single minute. \nMy mom has done a LOT for me. \n\nHere's the real question I want to ask - how do I stay sane for the next 8 months? He's been recently sexually abusing me when he hits. He put his hand inside my shirt yesterday and felt up my bra from behind and when I tried to turn around and hit him, he did the same in the front. This was one day AFTER he gave me macular edema by punching me in the eye. \n\nHe's done this in the past where he touches me inappropriately and then denies it. He tore my clothes on the street one day when I was 23. But yesterday it was CONFIRMED. I suspect he suffers from Intermittent Explosive Disorder. \n\nHe belittles me and says I don't deserve to work. I'm a doctor, I'm prepping for post grad so I'll be out soon...and no, we don't have any friends or relatives who want to help. Absolutely no police involvement because that would screw up my future.\nHe's really strong, he's 102kg and I'm 75kg. \n\nI just want to be able to deal with this for the next 8 months without killing myself."<br />Author: 'throwitawaycin'  id: 'ln1otn'<br />Score:88<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ln1otn/abusive_father/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Many Problems, issues and concerns of conducting examination offline for 9th and 11th standard,Why it needs to be held online and The state of classes.'<br />Body: '(*This is not completed*, may suggest articles and opinions. Bibliography to be provided after the end of the article)\n\nOn 12th February #CBSE / the Ministry of Education of India announced the following information:\n\nFirst,CBSE will be conducting exams for classes 9 and 11.(offline)\n\nThe new session for CBSE schools will start from April 1.\n\nCBSE has also introduced bridge courses to fill the academic gap due to online classes.\n\nThe notice released by CBSE further stated, “This exam will also help in identifying learning gaps which could be addressed by the schools in new academic sessions at the beginning of the classes.” The notice issued by CBSE cleared up the confusion regarding the exams for classes 9 and 11 for students and schools.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nNow let\'s discuss about the various problems/issues of these given information/statements and the concerns that arises between students and parents related to these statements.\n__________________________________________________________\n1. The first problem of this whole announcement is its presentation itself.\n The  announcement of this importance was made without taking the opinions of the students who are supposed to be present there physically and that of the parents . (I will explain this point further down below)\n__________________________________________________________\n2. "CBSE revealed that they want to start the new session from April 1st ":\n This statement itself has no issuse except that the mode of classes (online/offline) was not stated clearly.\n__________________________________________________________\n3. "The of examination for class 9th and 11th standard to be conducted through offline mode" with no alternate options:\n\nCBSE made it clear that it wanted the examination to be held offline unlike #ICSE who decided to let the students and parents choose by providing both the options of online and offline examination.\nPublic voices:\n°"My school has announced that the finals will be held in offline mode only. Even the date sheet is also out. I request the board to at least give students a choice how they prefer to give exam, online or offline,” said Shreeya Mohakud to Dataquest.\n__________________________________________________________\n4. Students and parents are really mentally not prepared and are genuinely scared:\n\nParents don\'t want their children to get ill. Students are scared for many different reasons, some are scared for themselves,some don\'t fear about their own health but that they could harm his/her family or elderly but being a carrier of the virus, some fear the travel of distance from home to school with the safety on roads ,etc. \nThe actual scariest thing being that they can be right. Parents and students are fears what actually could happen with no guarantee being there. Noone can say for 100% that one may not be affected when traveling outdoor and this examination will require students to leave home and be in a crowded place for 6-7 days according to the number of exam they have.\n\nPublic voices:\n°"I am Ashitha, and I am studying in 9th standard in Koyilandy, Kerala. My school decided to conduct final exam from 22 February till 3 March. And it is risk for all of us to go to school and I plead the government to take strict decision to conduct exam online,” said the student to Dataquest\n\n°The sister of a class 11 student at a private school in south Delhi said, “There is still a lot of apprehension among parents about the safety of their children and the family members. We live with grandparents, both aged above 90, and really concerned about their safety. Why can’t schools conduct exams online like they did last year?”\n\n°"It is not safe for students to take offline exams as teachers have tested positive in many states including Karnataka, Bihar, Mizoram. CBSE should conduct online exams for Class 9, 11," a student shared\n__________________________________________________________\n5. No mention or announcement by the Education Department what will happen if a student do get covid?:\n\nMany students and parents have raised this issue of "what if I/my child do get covid?". The education department didn\'t inform anything related to this. (In my #opinion they are will remain silent as they already have for students,teachers and stuff who got covid due to the re-opening of school in some states and won\'t address the individual grievances). \n__________________________________________________________\n6.State legislative Assembly Elections of 2021 :\n\nElections in India in 2021 will includes bye-elections to the\xa0Lok Sabha, elections to the\xa0Rajya Sabha, elections to\xa0legislative assemblies\xa0of 4 states(West Bengal, Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu) and 2 union territories(Puducherry, Jammu and Kashmir). This may cause crowds in the roads by party rally or campaigns, uncertainty of political violence/strikes\xa0, noise of campaign. (Even if the world was not suffering from the pandemic ,I would personally say examination during political period in india should be avoided.)\n__________________________________________________________'<br />Author: 'EstablishmentGlad125'  id: 'lmz72x'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lmz72x/many_problems_issues_and_concerns_of_conducting/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[AskIndia] Why should Indians accept the current Indian constitution and its structure?'<br />Body: 'I am a conservative. And when I say this, I mean a real social conservative, not a classical liberal or a right wing liberal. I am basically like your average unkill. I am not a loyal supporter of BJP/Modi but I like him, his charisma and his decisions, courage and speech. I am not strictly a Hindutvadi conservative, I am kind of a syncretist conservative who mixes bits of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, even Communism/socialism (despite their incompatibilities) and combines them and believes in moral traditions and cultures. \n\nMy question is: why should we Indians accept our Indian constitution? The constitution have no genuine concept, just copy pastas from foreign, especially western countries. The concepts of Human Rights, Liberty, Equality, etc all comes from Enlightenment which our \'freedom fighters\' like Gandhi, Nehru, Ambedkar, etc just blindly copied because they were \'cool\'. The only thing that is Indian adopted by them is our flag which bears saffron and our Ashoka Chakra. Our Constitution is entirely influenced by Western countries and their philosophies because people like Ambedkar probably thought poorly about Indian philosophy and wanted to copy cool concepts like Liberty, Equality, etc. which, like it or not, derives from Christian concepts of \'God\' and \'his creation and Natural Rights\' (first properly conceived by John Locke). Why should we Indians, most of whom are conservatives, accept such a Constitution? People back then were mostly poor and uneducated and just accepted whatever INC did as "Wo jo kar rahe hai, accha hi kar rahe honge, hume kya pata". Now that most of us know, why should we accept such a foreign Constitution and its philosophies and not try to replace it with concepts from dharma and Hinduism or at least traditions? Why should we just blindly accept everything like \'Human Rights\' and Liberal ideologies when most of our population are conservative and doesn\'t even accept it but are forced to do so because they cannot stand up to authorities?'<br />Author: 'IdiotNoOne'  id: 'lmt72g'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lmt72g/askindia_why_should_indians_accept_the_current/</li>

Because this issue is a huge one and is affecting the common people directly.\n\nNow, what is the point of staying in power if you can't do what is in your control? Increasing the price of petrol and gas just before two months of the election is always going to backfire! And I don't believe that Modiji and Amit Shahji don't know that.\n\nI really hope that prices are lowered significantly before the election, otherwise so much planning and hard work for such a long time will go in vein."<br />Author: 'a_curious_introvert'  id: 'lmqsm0'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lmqsm0/the_west_bengal_election_and_the_crisis_of_the/</li>

Besides this, Ather has also set up a charging station network called Ather Grid. Valued at Rs 1,405 crore ($189 million), Ather Energy is one of the most valuable electric scooter startups in India. \n\n\\#1 Ola Electric: Unsurprisingly, Ola Electric is the number 1 electric vehicle startup in India. Branched off from cab aggregator Ola Cabs, Ola Electric was started with the aim to bring 1 million electric vehicles on Indian roads by the end of 2021. They are already working towards this goal. They own an Amsterdam-based EV manufacturer Etergo and are also planning to set up the world’s largest electric scooter manufacturing plant in India which will help them manufacture and sell electric scooters. In order to achieve this, so far, Ola Electric has raised $307 million (Rs 2,277 crore) from investors like Softbank, Kia, Hyundai, Tata, Tiger Global, and Matrix Partners India, and it’s now valued at over $1 billion (Rs 7,418 crore). \n\n[CREDITS](https://youtu.be/9BWCYJmo-t8)\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\n1.

      <li>Title::: 'Indian Arranged marriage situation - go for it or avoid it?'<br />Body: 'Okay so this is the situation.\n\nI   am a 37 M, well educated, 6’2” tall, coming from what is generally   termed in India as being a ‘good’ family – in the sense that my family   has been educated and generally well to do, going back generations.\n\nSo,   I met a girl who is 36 F. She and I are similarly educated, and have a   lot of values in common. Entrepreneurship – she’s an entrepreneur and I   like and am a fanboy of people who are doing their own thing. I have a   LOTT in common with her. We were talking for an hour and a half every   day. We are both thinkers and we are both strategizers. We both like   cooking. We both like entrepreneurship and business and we both like to   fanboy technology. She’s a nice person and I like her. But, partly   because she’s overweight and partly because in her personality I could   not find elements that I could fall in love with – I haven’t. I met her   online. Talked for a year. And broke up this past Monday. Now I  miss  her and find that I really miss the conversation we used to be  having.\n\nI  would like to add here  that I am lonely in general – and really need  to get back in touch with  my old friends first, so that I unlonely  myself and then probably start  dating.\n\nSexual  chemistry was zilch  with her from my side. There was only this  friendly chemistry and  naughtiness and not too much sexual attraction  from my side. She,  though, wanted to jump my bones and have her way  with me.  Being an  entrepreneur, she\'s kinda lonely a little too, in  the guy department.\n\nArranged   marriage with her? There’s a lot in common – lotts. We are friendly. We   get along. We have common values. No love yet though.\n\nEdit:   I\'m 37. Not getting any younger. She knows about the fact that I   ovethink things and am a little odd / eccentric. and the fact that I   take meds like aripiprazole and take counselling and psychotherapy.   She\'s okay with it. She loved me till I broke it off - she said that - "   I thought that we had something but I guess I misjudged it" to which I   said " that we certainly do and I am very fond of you"\n\nEdit2:   I have had a few sexual relationships but never fallen head over heels   in love with a woman. The one\'s I chased and had a crush on never   returned it back.\n\nEdit 3: She   comes from a well off family and has SEXXY goals and ambition man! Wants   to be an investor in due course of time! I am really attracted to that   -- that she makes up for my own lacks. Or she and I can partner well  in  this matter and have a good jugalbandi.\n\nEdit   4: One can find sexxy wimmens who are hott and all. But what one  cannot  find is sexxy goals  and "values". Also what one cannot find   easily is women who look up to the same heroes that you look up to!   That being in common is really nice!!\n\nTL:DR:\n\nShould  I get into an arranged marriage with someone who I have a lot in common  including life-goals and I look up to in general. I have sub-optimal  sexual chemistry with her.'<br />Author: 'houstonrice'  id: 'llozg0'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/llozg0/indian_arranged_marriage_situation_go_for_it_or/</li>
      <li>Title::: '[TIL] Father of the Indian Constitution, Dr Ambedkar, Wanted to Burn It'<br />Body: '&gt;**It is by placating the sentiments of smaller communities and smaller people who are afraid that the majority may do wrong, that the British Parliament works. Sir, my friends tell me that I have made the Constitution. But I am quite prepared to say that I shall be the first person to burn it out. I do not want it. It does not suit anybody. But whatever that may be, if our people want to carry on, they must not forget that there are majorities and there are minorities, and they simply cannot ignore the minorities by saying, “Oh, no. To recognise you is to harm democracy.” I should say that the greatest harm will come by injuring the minorities.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Dr BR Ambedkar in the Rajya Sabha on 2 September 1953 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*On 2 September 1953 while debating how a Governor in the country should be invested with more powers, Dr Ambedkar argued strongly in favour of amending the constitution.*\n\n&gt;\\[...\\] **my submission is this that no harm can be done to democracy and to democratic Constitution if our Constitution was amended** \\[...\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Dr BR Ambedkar in the Rajya Sabha on 2 September 1953 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Two years later, on 19 March 1955, Dr Anup Singh, a Rajya Sabha member from Punjab, brought up Ambedkar’s remark, when the Fourth Amendment Bill was being discussed. Dr Singh asked, “Last time when you spoke, you said that you would burn the Constitution.”*\n\n&gt;**Do you want a reply to that? I would give it to you right here. My friend says that the last time when I spoke, I said that I wanted to burn the Constitution. Well, in a hurry I did not explain the reason. Now that my friend has given me the opportunity, I think I shall give the reason. The reason is this: We built a temple for god to come in and reside, but before the god could be installed, if the devil had taken possession of it, what else could we do except destroy the temple? We did not intend that it should be occupied by the Asuras. We intended it to be occupied by the Devas.

However I feel that the police in India have too much power to assert their biases. Consider for example the love jihad fiasco. The love jihad realted laws, have not been framed properly and leave so much open to a case of he said, she said.\n\n In a recent case an 18 year old was arrested for meeting a girl for lunch. The police had the authority to say that, meeting a minor immediately entails that the person is in fact trying to elope, or misbehave with the minor. When the police have the authority to assert their opinions or biases on laws, then to us, the citizens they will seem like nothing but government funded goons. And here lies the problem, we cannot expect people to be free of bias. People have different upbringings, which naturally lead to the formation of many biases. Ideally we would address the formation of bias, but first and foremost we have to address the fact that people can act on biases and get away scot free. \n\nIn another case a muslim woman was beaten for allegedly having some form of illicit mateiral. She's currently in the hospital suffering from.serious injuries. The accused lodged a complaint against the victim and the police initially booked her. The CO, advised the men not to take actions into their own hands. Where is the justice here? The police book a women recovering from injurues in a hospital, on allegations from some men, but don't book the same men for nearly thrashing a woman to death? \n\nIf we do not have any form of reformation and we allow the police to act on their own agendas or biases, it will greatly damage the peace of the nation."<br />Author: 'Suki1387'  id: 'lkuron'<br />Score:86<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lkuron/police_reforms_are_an_absolute_necessity_in_india/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Hindus are not idol worshippers. A little bit of info about what bhakti really is.'<br />Body: 'I had a friend in college who was asked by his other friends why he did pooja in front of an idol. Why do you go to Tirupati? Isn\'t god omniscient? Poor guy didn\'t know the answers and the bullies knew this. They would ask him why he lights a Diya, and agarbatti? He used to be depressed by the constant heckling. And because he was a person who did rituals.\n\nI see this heckling everywhere today and people still call Hindus idol worshippers. \n\nIt\'s not idol worship because it\'s not an idol. It\'s a person. That\'s what bhakti means. You have personified the paramatma. And that\'s not a temple he/she lives in. It\'s their home, it\'s a place of residence.\n\nMost big temples will bathe their deity twice in a day. The people who do this are caretakers of the person living inside. They change their vastras(garments), and they feed the deity thrice a day. Whatever is leftover is shared by the visitors to this "temple". That\'s called prasadam.\n\nOn their birthdays, the caretakers pamper the deity, he\'s given his favourite food, he\'s bathed in milk and given new clothes to wear, just like we would celebrate any birthday.\n\nAt the end of the day, curtains are drawn and the deity is assumed to retire for the day. The deity is not disturbed until sunup. These rules are followed not because there\'s an idol there. \n\nThere\'s a person living inside. Ever been to Tirupati? When people finally get a glimpse of Govinda, they shout happily his name, they are greeting and saying hello. It\'s a person not an idol.\n\nThat\'s the beauty of bhakti. You can have any relationship with your Ishtadevta. They can be your mentor, your father, your mother, your husband, lover, a friend or even a son. You can assume that your "god" is your son. Let that sink in. In some circles this is blasphemy. But not in Hinduism. \n\nEven Shankaracharya, who revived advaita, finally composed Bhaja Govindam. Because he knew that there are idiots who will resort to name-calling.\n\nNot everyone can read and decipher the Vedas. Not everyone can sit and do multiple kriyas for hours. Not everyone has the discipline to commit to pranayama. \n\nThis is the reason bhakti is popular. Because it\'s for everybody. Don\'t ever be discouraged if called one. That\'s all. Hari bol.\n\nPS. - on a corollary note, this philosophy is the reason Sri Rama owns the Ayodhya land. It\'s his. This is the reason Sabrimala has no entry for women. There\'s a brahmachari living in there. Why would you send women in? It\'s common decency. Ignorance is the reason. If Hindus really knew what bhakti meant, no rule would be required.'<br />Author: 'AsliIndianErotica'  id: 'lkfm52'<br />Score:103<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lkfm52/hindus_are_not_idol_worshippers_a_little_bit_of/</li>

And did he advocate for the abolishment of the Caste System?'<br />Body: 'When I was a student in High School I was taught that the Buddha was disgusted with the world\'s suffering and he created the religion of Buddhism to alleviate the world\'s suffering. I also thought that he was against the caste system, since our history teachers claimed that the Buddha clashed with the Brahmans and because Dalits liked Doctor Ambedkar embraced Neo-Buddhism.\n\nBut according to a new book I have been reading *The Penguin History of Early India: From the Origins to 1300 AD by Romila Thapar* the Buddha did not create Buddhsim for the purpose of eliminating the Caste System in order to avoid and I quote "a radical re-ordering of society". In fact he prioritized converting members of the upper castes like wealthy merchants and the kshatriyas of the gana-sanghas. I looked it up online and while both my sources seem to be biased, one is pro-hindu and the other is pro-Muslim, they also state the same thing.\n\nSo how exactly did the Buddha treat the Untouchables as equals, or did he still have some prejudice towards them? And did he advocate for the abolishment of the Caste System or was he as casteist as any other Indian of his time?\n\nReferences:\n\n[The Buddha and Caste (indiadivine.org)](https://www.indiadivine.org/the-buddha-and-caste/)\n\n[Buddha On Caste System: A Subaltern Critique | The Justice Mirror](https://justicemirror.com/buddha-on-caste-system-and-human-suffering/)'<br />Author: 'jacky986'  id: 'lk472f'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lk472f/how_did_buddha_treat_untouchablesdalits_did_he/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Tense phone call between Biden &amp; Xi Jinping, massive protests in Myanmar, and the economic rise of Taiwan'<br />Body: ' Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Geopolitics Thread, the one place where we discuss all the latest events from around the world. Discussion does not have to be related to India. Please share and discuss stories, or ask any geopolitical questions that you have, in the comments. Here are a few stories to get the discussion started: \n\n# Top stories\n\n1. [Biden dials Xi in tense call](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/china-xi-calls-for-unity-in-first-remarks-of-biden-era-warns-against-arrogant-isolation.html)\n\nAfter calling treaty allies in Europe and Asia as well as major non-treaty ally India, US President Joe Biden had a tense, 2 hour long call with Chinese dictator Xi Jinping. According to statements released from both sides, the two disagreed on all the major issues discussed, from a clampdown on democracy in Hong Kong to threats to invade Taiwan to the genocide underway in Xinjiang. They also exchanged views on the coronavirus pandemic and climate change. The Chinese statement, which was far less rosy, warned that bad relations between the two powers would be a "disaster" for both countries. Meanwhile, a team of WHO investigators largely ruled out the theory that the coronavirus emerged in a lab in Wuhan, although their "investigation" was tightly controlled by Communist authorities.\n\n2. [UK hits COVID-19 vaccine target as Europe looks on](https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/business/article249249035.html)\n\nUK PM Boris Johnson announced that the country had hit a significant milestone by administering at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine to all 15 million people (22% of the population) the government identified as the most vulnerable, including healthcare workers and residents of old age homes (about a third of them also received the second dose). With this, the country is expected to announce easing of lockdown measures in the coming weeks even as vaccination will now extend to the general public except children. Results from the world\'s most successfully vaccinated country, Israel, showed that the vaccines worked to stem the pandemic. Meanwhile, the EU announced that it would start fast-tracking vaccine approvals with the goal of purchasing 700 million shots by September. The rollout in Europe has been fairly abysmal.\n\n3. [Donald Trump acquitted in second impeachment trial](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/13/politics/republican-votes-trump-guilty-convict-impeachment/index.html)\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump, who ordered a frenzied mob to storm the US Capitol to halt counting of electoral votes on Jan 6, was acquitted in a historic second impeachment trial, by a 57-43 vote of Senators (67 votes are required to convict). Seven members of his own party voted to convict him, while the leader of the Republican party in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, denounced Trump and blamed him for the attempted coup after voting to acquit him. The acquittal means that Mr. Trump is free to run again in the future for any public office in the US, although other criminal investigations are pending.\n\n4. [Massive protests in Myanmar against military regime](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/army-faces-crippling-mass-strike-hundreds-thousands-protest-myanmar-n1257914)\n\nThe military junta in Myanmar, after staging a coup and overthrowing the recently re-elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, is facing massive protests in all major cities, with both government workers and private citizens coming to the streets to demand a restoration of democracy. Trains and power plants were hit as workers went on strike, even as the military tried to send soldiers to run them while cutting off all Internet access and detaining hundreds. Students in the largest city of Yangon (Rangoon) took to the streets as well. The US has threatened to re-impose sanctions if democracy is not restored, while powerful neighbours India and China, as well as regional bloc ASEAN, have largely hesitated to put any pressure on the military.\n\n5. [Tokyo Olympics chief resigns following sexist remarks](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/12/sport/yoshiro-mori-tokyo-2020-resignation-intl-hnk/index.html)\n\nThe President of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics committee and former PM of Japan Yoshiro Mori resigned from the committee after being called out for saying that board meetings took too long because "women talk too much". The 83 year old apologized for his remarks. Japan typically does poorly on women\'s participation in professional life, with traditional values relegating them to raise children and take care of the home irrespective of whether they hold a professional job or not. The rescheduled Tokyo Olympics are scheduled to begin on July 23, although a recent survey in Japan found that 77% of people wanted it to be cancelled entirely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The fall and rise of Taiwan\n\n*This is the second in a four-part series where I discuss how the Asian tigers of the last century (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea) became developed economies.*\n\nGeographically, Taiwan is a fairly ordinary island - located off the coast of mainland China with a few smaller associated islands, about half of it is mountainous and the other half plains. With an area of about 36,000 km^(2), it is between Kerala and Meghalaya in size, and with a population of about 23.5 million, it is similar to Haryana. And yet, Taiwan is one of the most important countries in the modern history of East Asia. Settled for millennia by indigenous people, it came under the rule of the Qing  dynasty of China at the end of the 17th Century. Even then, it was considered an insignificant backwater. Then, in 1895, China was defeated by Japan in the First Sino-Japanese War. Japan, being an island nation itself, was interested in acquiring more island territories, and in the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Taiwan and its associated islands were ceded to Japan.\n\nUnlike its later, brutal colonial rule in Korea and Manchuria, Japan actually treated Taiwan well, bringing in rapid industrialization and modern education in an attempt to show that it could be a better colonial ruler than the West (to this day, Taiwanese opinion of Japan remains positive, unlike the hostile relationship with both Koreas and China). Nonetheless, the aboriginal people were suppressed. Even as China transitioned into a Republic in 1912 under President Sun Yat-Sen, Taiwan continued to be a Japanese colony. By the time of the Second Sino-Japanese War (better known as World War 2), Taiwan gained strategic importance, both for its location and its many war-time industries. In 1945, the Republic of China forces accepted the surrender of General Rikichi Ando, Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan, marking a return of Taiwan to Chinese rule although it was never legally recognized by any other country (Japan renounced its claims on Taiwan, but the Allies never formally determined that sovereignty be restored to China).\n\nIn the midst of the confusion, the Chinese Civil War resumed, with Mao Zedong\'s Communist forces now gaining an upper hand from Soviet support and leftover Japanese weapons, and the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) government of the Republic of China being drained by the war with Japan. In 1949, after the KMT was driven out of *four* capital cities, KMT and Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek evacuated their forces to Taiwan and established a war-time capital in Taipei. There it has remained since, even after the People\'s Republic of China (PRC) on the mainland has been recognized by almost all countries as the "true" China. Taiwan, formally the Republic of China (ROC), remained as the last staging ground of the KMT, protected by the US but forever in the shadow of the mainland. In 1949, Chiang Kai-shek declared martial law in Taiwan, which remained all the way till he left power in 1987. The KMT, defeated in the mainland, arrested and executed over 100,000 people in Taiwan that it claimed were Communists and labour unionists in a bid to cement its dictatorship.\n\nAs the war reached a stalemate (neither side formally ended it), the KMT was faced with a bleak economic situation in its last remaining territory. Although much of the ROC\'s gold reserves had been transferred to Taiwan, the long wars and hyperinflation had left the economy in shambles, with both the former (Taiwanese Yen) and current currency (Taiwanese Dollar) becoming essentially worthless. The KMT government moved to transform the economy through two means: land reforms that broke up large landholdings (similar to what the Allies did in Japan and what Nehru did in India), and development of industry through import-substitution (in addition to creating a new currency, the New Taiwan Dollar, which remains today). In the former, it was fairly successful, with agricultural output increasing greatly. In the latter though, initial success was followed by failure, as a policy of high tariffs  made local industry uncompetitive. Sensing trouble, the KMT government moved to lift tariffs and instead subsidize industries directly, with generous economic aid from the US, which still recognized it as the legitimate government of a unified China and wanted to prop up a "democratic China".\n\nThe US-subsidized industrialization was a massive success, with many companies setting up factories on the island, attracted by subsidies, low labour costs, and the near-total lack of environmental regulations. Notably, unlike in Singapore, most of these companies were led by local entrepreneurs, with FDI representing only a small share. These local companies grew by integrating themselves with supply chains for Japanese and American companies. In the 1960s, Taiwan and Japan were spoken of in the same breath as the two economic giants of Asia, much like India and China today. Then in the 1970s, the US and most countries recognized the PRC government, and the ROC government overnight turned into a rogue state, having been kicked out of all international institutions, forced to have only informal relations, and questioning how it could continue claiming all of China.\n\nAnd yet, economic ties go deeper than fickle international politics. By the 70s, the Taiwan Miracle was fully in place, and the strong ties it had in international supply chains ensured that it continued to be an economic hub despite its diminished political status, showing the strategic value of a strong economy. The KMT, still ruling as a dictatorship, deftly managed new labour movements, and encouraged the now-large local industries to "go global," establishing factories in SE Asia and even mainland China, which remained a poor and mismanaged country that was more interested in stopping women from having babies than growing its economy. Taiwan became one of the world\'s most economically developed countries while being a full-fledged military dictatorship. \n\nFinally, in the 80s, after Chiang Kai-shek gave up power and died, Taiwan took tentative steps towards multi-party democracy. The country started seeing itself as separate from China instead of being a holdout of the Civil War. An elected executive presidency, an elected legislature, and an independent judiciary were established. In 2000, Chen Shui-bian from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) became the first non-KMT politician to become President. The country\'s politics today remains democratic and divided between those that favour eventual reunification with mainland China (mainly led by the KMT) and those that favour an independent, "normal" future (led by the DPP). Nonetheless, the strong economic base provided by the decades of the Taiwan Miracle remains the tiny country\'s strongest foundation, even as a now economically mighty People\'s Republic of China threatens to overturn the established political order in all of Asia.\n\n**Note: Thank you to everyone that liked and awarded my unscheduled post on the Indian Slave Trade last week, which was inspired by a video from the Dominican President on COVID-19 vaccines from India.

      <li>Title::: 'Translation: Highest voted answer on Zhihu about farmer protest(from Zhihu, Chinese forum)'<br />Body: 'Hi Indians I am native Chinese, and have been interested in communicating with people from different countries. I translated an article on Zhihu (which is like quora) to share the\xa0highest voted\xa0answer about\xa0the recent farmer protest in India. \n\nThe recent farmer\xa0protests in India have not attracted much attention in China, so the highest voted answer\xa0I can find is only about 2000\\~. Based on my current understanding of the current situation in India, this answer\xa0should contain errors and the description is not detailed enough. But there are many comments below this article, these comments can reflect the true views of the Chinese people\xa0so I chose it anyway. \n\n**Corrections or refutations on this article are welcome and precious, and I will post them back to Chinese internet.** \n\nThis translation contains about 2400 words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Author: Shan Yue Lan knife on knife** \n\n**Upvotes:2466**\n\nRoughly speaking, what\'s happening is this:\n\nIn the past, India provided minimum price protection for 23 crops, including staple foods and some economic crops, and they were purchased by the state.\n\nThis year, three new bills were passed allowing private companies to directly trade with farmers on a large scale.\n\nSmall farmers face large companies and have weak bargaining power\xa0naturally. Once private companies make large-scale acquisitions, the inevitable result will be farmers\' losses.\n\nTherefore, after the passage of the bill, the Minister of Agriculture resigned immediately, and several states in the northwest, dominated by Sikhism, protested one after another on a large scale.\n\nSo far, it is generally still within the scope of Chinese people\'s understanding.\n\n**But in reality, the situation is much more complicated.**\n\nFirst of all, because there are a large number of economic crops\xa0in the crops purchased by the state, economic crops\xa0cannot withstand long-term storage. However, acquisition, transportation, and warehousing take time, and the efficiency of India government is beyond need.\xa0There are only four types of grain purchases in China, which are wheat, rice, soybeans, and corn, and they are all easy for storage, while India\'s purchase of more than 20 kinds, greed for everything, will inevitably seriously affect the purchase volume.\n\nIndia government\xa0has limited volume of purchases, so whose crops can be sold to India government\xa0at high prices? Naturally, they are big landlords and rich peasants who have access. The poor peasants did not enjoy this benefit and were originally forced to sell them at a lower market price, and some extreme cases, even losing money for selling.\n\nTherefore, the big landlords are most affected by the new law. The states in northwestern India are actually not bad on economy.\xa0The real poor ones are in the southeast. It is these poor states that are active in the Communist Party of India(Mao), which has been given high expectations by many Chinese.\xa0And Punjab, the main source of trouble this time, was relatively rich, but the poor states in the southeast did not cause trouble.\n\nWhat does this matter have to do with the Communist Party of India(Mao)? People in\xa0active area of the Communist Party of India(Mao) didn\'t\xa0participated in this protest in Beijing.\n\n**So Why is this happening?**\n\nThe peasants\' anger does exist, but going to the capital to make trouble, especially when hundreds of thousands of people leave their hometowns to make trouble in the capital, is definitely not something that farmers can play. The peasant groups are highly locally restricted naturally. Now matter how hard\xa0they rebel in their hometown, it\'s still unlikely some many at same time\xa0will go to the capital where they are unfamiliar to protest.\n\nThis matter is the Northwestern states that have long supported the National Congress Party. The upper echelons instructed and encouraged them to embarrass Modi of the Indian Party and make political gains. Then the middle-level landlords organized, and finally the lower-level peasants entered the capital. Behind the 300,000 parade, there is a large-scale supply convoy to cook for the farmers. The organizers are the landlords most affected by the new bill. The real low-level farmers, in addition to expressing their anger, are more practical, mixing three meals with the landlord\'s curry.\n\nIn fact, excluding a few places such as Europe, America and some east Asian countries, there are about 5 billion people in this world who are still in the state of ancient Chinese squires who manage the people at the grassroots level.\xa0Combined with modern \xa0Western-style democracy,\xa0this kind of “cancer management model”\xa0has become more difficult to solve in most countries, and deeply rooted\xa0in low class levels. These noble families hold the local votes, and the poor have no choice at all. It is better to choose a local bastard than a foreign bastard. Like the Abe family and their in-laws, they have won for more than 100 years in Yamaguchi Prefecture(In Japan). Of course, Japan\'s celebrities are very restrained\xa0themselves. In the vast majority of poor countries, the rich and gentry are often the local chiefs and the largest wealthy businessmen in the region, and they can control the local councils and bargain with them. In addition, in many countries, there is a lack of police and tax authorities directly under the authority to restrict local power. In many\xa0countries, governments at all levels are independent\xa0in reality, and there is basically no promotion channel for basic-level civil servants. They became\xa0lackeys for electing high-ranking people.\xa0These people are often in the local area. When it comes to bargaining with the above, it is very common for the squires to hire groups to play strong. \n\n**Protests cannot be said to be fake, but** **this kind of thing is more or less related to local interests, but the box lunch is absolutely necessary.**\n\nAlthough the protests did not retreat for 15 days, for New Delhi, which has a population of 25 million, this crowd is not a small number, but there is not much\xa0as well. And so far there are\xa0no other poorer states responded.\n\nDon\'t have too many class struggle expectations about this matter. When the landlords of Punjab felt they get what they want, they retreated immediately. Don\'t apply our common communism sense to foreign countries. There are 7.5 billion people on this fucking ball(earth), and our 1.4 billion are the weird ones.\n\nChairman Mao\'s autumn harvest uprising team went up the mountain for three months, and they occupied Ninggang, Wan\'an, Suichuan and other counties successively. This Red Division was still in panic and went through a whole group of mutinies. Like Lin Biao(a major PLA general), he was a deserter and later published an article questioning "How long can the red flag still fight". In the 50 years since the Communist Party of India (Mao)\xa0rebelled, there is still no county in their\xa0hand, and the National Congress was held in secret. If the Indian Communist Party had\xa0Lin Biao, I didn\'t know how many he would have slipped. In my opinion, the Communist Party of India(Mao)\xa0are somewhat idealistic and dogmatic. Don\'t give them much hope. The saying "China must not allow the Communist Party of India(Mao)\xa0to come to power for its own benefit" is plain science fiction, and there is no need for discussion.\n\n**Comments:**\n\n* (536upvotes) It is exactly the same as in ancient times in China. It looks like that public opinion is boiling, but in fact it is the landlord who is flicking and fighting against taxes and using public opinion to fight against the central government.\n* (257upvotes) Isn\'t this a daily life in India? The omprador National Congress party accused the populist Indian party as traitors, and the landlords &amp; rich peasant hired the poor to oppose the government\'s policies. Isn\'t it such a thing? . .\n\nReply to this comment:\n\n(27) BJP is also a comprador, and populism is only a superior method. \n\n(15) BJP has real goals comparing to the National Congress Party, but the political parties that come to power in elections all have a drawback, that is, they dare not make drastic reforms. In the situation of India, it won\'t make it without a full-scale change. \n\n(2) BJP is much better, and it is unrealistic to say it’s a Indian comprador. The Indian government\'s protection of domestic enterprises\' trade protection is the largest among major countries. \n\n(3) Modi is still very courageous, if he can\'t make it, then there will be hardly anyone who can reform in the future\n\n* (59upvotes) India needs the holy dynasty(implying China) to intervene, abandon castes, and equal the lands(implying land revolution in China in 1940\\~50s)\n* (41upvotes) This is the right answer. Any movements, including street movements, people with more than double digits cannot be unorganized. No belief or anger can withstand three meals a day.\n* (20upvotes)When I saw the photos protesting the peasants, I thought they are landlords and rich peasants. They don’t dress like people working in the fields.\n* (16upvotes) There is a lowest price. The poor can still have food to eat. If the lowest price is gone they can only go to the cities. Besides, don’t you think there is no such phenomenon in China? China\'s grain is also sold in large quantities to private individuals. The government only serves as a balancing effect. Sometimes the purchase volume(of gov) is full and the remaining grain can only be handled by the farmers themselves. At this time, buyer\'s market will appear. This is the reason why farming now in China is not profitable anymore. But the government\'s purchase price has played the most fundamental protective role.\n\nReply to this comment: \n\n(9)Not the same, the land in India is in the hands of big landlords, not in the hands of farmers at all. The profit is the same for the bottom farmers. The bottom farmers in India are now starving.\n\n(14) Indian farmers are very miserable.\n\nWhen India closed the country at the beginning of the epidemic, a large number of migrant workers had to travel long distances to walk home, and some died on the way. The Indian government was unable to stop the spread of the epidemic. The economy fell and the unemployment rate soared. Migrant workers almost died in vain.\n\nIndia itself has big landlords, and quite a few farmers own very little land or even tenants. It is difficult for the proletariat to unite, let alone India still has religion and caste ideas.\n\n*  (9upvotes) The problem is that after the fire starts, the arsonists can no longer control it. Are those landlords really sure that they will be able to control the poor peasants every time? \n\nReply to this comment: \n\n(38) This is not the first time. It is normal for squires to find groups to perform such things in third world countries.\n\n* (3upvotes)\xa0For China’s own interests, the communism party of India(Mao)\xa0should not be allowed to come to power\n\nReply to this comment:\n\n(14)\xa0I think it doesn’t matter if the real Communism party\xa0comes to power in India. It should be because the proletariat has to liberate the whole world in order to liberate itself.\n\n(3)\xa0The wave that liberated all mankind has been buried in Warsaw for a hundred years. Speaking about\xa0liberating all mankind only proves you did not wake up.\n\n(2)\xa0The Russians’ credibility is too bad. They were killing their whole family yesterday. Today they said that they want to liberate you. It’s normal if you don’t believe it. Liberation can only be self-liberation, otherwise the taste will change in the end\n\n(3)\xa0Doesn’t conform to Marxism \\[covering face\\] \\[covering face\\] The global diffusion and full use of capitalism finally led to the proletarian unity and the collapse of capitalism. At the beginning of the last century, Russia itself was not industrialized. The whole world except for the United States and Western Europe, were all agricultural countries, capitalism is far from reaching its end. I think only after the day\xa0that , 2 out of India, South America, and Africa have two independent industrialization, then capitalism will be completely\xa0be\xa0finished.\n\n(11) India farmers\xa0can\'t be helped, Chairman Mao had already made it clear. The reason why China’s red regime exists is due to China’s disunity and division\xa0at that time. Completely\xa0economic bankruptcy, and the colonization of foreign powers that can not resolve contradictions\xa0internally. In these respects, India has done much better than the Republic of China\xa0as of 1920s. India\xa0is unified, and there is no direct invasion by foreign countries.\n\n*  (1upvotes)Then why not set a minimum purchase price, a price that must also be observed for private acquisitions? \xa0Similar to the minimum wage standard, lower than this price is illegal. Of course, it has to be accompanied by import tariffs or import quotas, otherwise everything will be imported.\n\nIndia is a big food exporter. This year, China imported rice from India, which is cheaper than Southeast Asia and the United States. Indian food is already so cheap, or is it the result of government subsidies? Will it be cheaper in the future? I can\'t imagine that India still has to import chemical fertilizers, can it earn back the money for chemical fertilizers and pesticides?\n\nReply to this comment:\n\n(35) The minimum wage standard must have a formal labor contract. How to guarantee the minimum wage for work without a labor contract? You go to the market to buy vegetables and think that cucumbers are expensive for 4$. If you don\'t buy them, can the farmers who sell the vegetables sue you? The market is difficult to manage. Don\'t underestimate the administrative difficulty, especially at the grassroots level. Many rules are local rules. The easiest way is to buy through the country, this is the easiest to accept, even if it is a buyout, there are many problems. Back then, when China abolished the agricultural tax in 2003, the tax was about 250 billion yuan, and the collection cost was more than 200 billion, so it just should abolished.'<br />Author: 'Flying0885'  id: 'ljttww'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ljttww/translation_highest_voted_answer_on_zhihu_about/</li>

Also, the government officials can easily be bribed which affects the proper judgement in the case and is skewed against farmers because of the money traders can spent.

The problem has many aspects.  \n1. We think investing, money management is something only grown ups need to worry about. No, we need to teach money management &amp; investing just like any other subject if we want our children to succeed in life.\n\n2. Most of us don't think beyond savings accounts, FDs, PF etc as a medium of investment. With 5-6% annual inflation and so low interest rates you are barely growing your money.  \n3. Even if we do, we just invest a token amount. If you want to seriously grow your wealth you need to save and invest maximum possible amount. People having savings of millions of rupees lying in their bank account doing nothing. Money can make money only if you put it to work.  \n4. Not understanding the power of compounding. It kind of relates to first point, earlier you start more money you can grow. But most of us, have no clue about it and think of it as something we'll do 10-15 years before retirement. If you start at 20 and invest only Rs. 1000 each year, this sum will grow to Rs. 4.9L by the time you are 60 at 10% annual growth.  \n\n\nI myself made most of these mistakes but now I have realized how big of a deal is being financial literate. And I want everyone else especially our youngsters to be aware of it. I think we should utilize this platform of r/IndiaSpeaks to spread this awareness.

      <li>Title::: 'Phone call from "UNICEF India" asking for donations'<br />Body: 'tl;dr - Received a call from a person claiming to be from UNICEF India asking for monthly donations to help prevent newborn baby deaths. Wondering if legit or scam.\n\n\nA friend of mine, messaged in our chat group of 5 friends that he has shared our phone numbers with a representative from UNICEF India and we should expect a call from her asking for donation. He also mentioned that he has been paying them Rs. 500 per month for a few months now.\n\n\nI was immediately suspicious of this being a scam, but he claimed that he pays only via their official site [unicef.org](https://unicef.org). I was still a bit suspicious. A quick Google search, however, brought me to pages indicating that this might be a common scam - [Example Quora post](https://www.quora.com/Is-a-donation-call-from-a-UNICEF-fundraiser-a-scam-or-legit).\n\n\nAnyway, today I received a call from the said representative. Here\'s what the conversation went like:\n\n\nRepresentative: Hello u/GaneshEknathGaitonde, I am speaking from UNICEF India. Your friend [redacted] gave me your number.\n\nMe: Hi. Is this another of those scam calls?\n\nR: *laughs nervously* No no. I am speaking from UNICEF India. Didn\'t your friend mention that I would be calling?\n\nMe: Yes, he did. Go ahead!\n\nR: Do you know about neonatal deaths?\n\nMe: Yes, I do\n\nR: So you know how many children die neonatal deaths.\n\nMe: No, I am not aware of the numbers.\n\nR: *Explains about number of neonatal deaths per month in India. Asks me to donate monthly to help prevent them.*\n\nMe: I agree with a cause and am willing to donate for it. But I am not able to trust this phone number. How do I know this is not a scam?\n\nR: I have sent you my ID on WhatsApp. You can see that I work for UNICEF India.\n\nMe: Frankly speaking, it is no big deal to forge an ID to send on WhatsApp.\n\n\nAnyway, I proceeded to open WhatsApp, and she had indeed sent an ID on WhatsApp, from a different phone number. The ID had the following:\n1. UNICEF logo at the top.\n2. Her job title - "FUNDRAISER"\n3. Her photograph. It matched with the display picture set on her WhatsApp profile.\n4. Her name, matching with the name my friend had told me, and the one she introduced herself with in the beginning of the phone call.\n5. An ID number.\n6. Date of Birth - 11/25/1997\n7. Valid Until - 31/3/2021\n\nI am not revealing her name/ID number in order to prevent doxxing.\n\nRight off the bat, I noticed that the font of "Date of Birth" and "Valid Until" was of very different sizes.\n\nAnyway, back to the phone call.\n\nMe: Frankly speaking, it is no big deal to forge an ID to send on WhatsApp.\n\nR (Clearly sounding frustrated now): No, it is my real ID.\n\nMe: There is something about your ID which makes me feel it is a fake.\n\nR: What?\n\nMe: Do you know about date formats? As in, DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY, etc.\n\nR: Yes, I do.\n\nMe: So in your ID, your DOB is clearly in DD/MM/YYYY format while "Valid Until" has it in MM/DD/YYYY format. Why would the official UNICEF ID have such an inconsistent style in 2 back-to-back lines.\n\nR (Very frustrated now): I am telling you this is my real ID. I am not scamming you.\n\nMe: See, I can\'t trust this phone call. I can\'t donate on whatever link you give me. If I donate, I would do so only via official channels. Will it happen on the official website?\n\nR (Sounding angry now): Yes. That is what I have been trying to tell you. You will donate on the official site. Go to unicef.in and at the bottom there is a "Become a donor" button, you can donate there.\n\nMe: Why are you getting angry? Do I not have the right to confirm before I donate my money to you?\n\nR (calmer now): Yes, yes you do.\n\nAnyway, I opened the site on my laptop immediately, it redirected me to the official unicef.org/india website and indeed, at the bottom there was a button for it.\n\nR: You can check the site and if you want.\n\nWe ended the phone call here.\n\nNow I was really confused about whether this is a scam or is it legit.\nThe phone call, especially the ID, made it look very fake and scam-like, but the fact that she is asking me to donate on the actual UNICEF website, makes me feel it is legit.\n\nMoreover, the URLs of the donation page are weird:\n\nHere are a few:\n\nBecome a donor button at bottom - https://help.unicef.org/in/digitaltv-EN\nThis one talks about donating to help prevent neonatal deaths.\n\nDonate now button at top - https://help.unicef.org/in/NDTV\nThis one is preventing COVID-19 from becoming a long lasting crisis for children.\n\nWhile the cause and details on the pages seem legit, the URLs themselves, "digitaltv-EN" and "NDTV" seem unrelated and fishy.\n\nThere was this recent post on this very sub-reddit just 3 days ago claiming NDTV is accused of collecting funds in the name of UNICEF - https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lgpgsc/ndtv_accused_of_fraudulently_collecting_funds_in/.\nI am willing to donate for this noble cause, but the URLs make me suspicious.\n\nDoes anyone know about these phone calls, whether they are legit or indeed a scam?\nAlso, regardless of the weird URLs, here\'s a theory I have:\n\n* Given that the ID is very suspicious. Even the fact that she tried to verify her claim by sending a photo of her ID on WhatsApp (which anyone can make in literally 5 minutes) means that they are trying to find gullible people.\n* In my case, I was suspicious of them and called it out explicitly, hence they proceeded to give me the official donation channel. My money won\'t go to them, but actual UNICEF funds only. Later, they would ask me to give phone numbers of few other people (like the asked my friend) hoping that they are more gullible than me. I am still useful to them as a means of getting other contacts.\n* Among these new people, whoever trusts them easily would be given a different non-official donation method and essentially be scammed.'<br />Author: 'GaneshEknathGaitonde'  id: 'ljkro1'<br />Score:35<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ljkro1/phone_call_from_unicef_india_asking_for_donations/</li>

( Pardon me English, I am not from England).\n\nSo, when we are right , even if our friends or someone who is senior is telling lies about us, we don\'t care as much because we know inside that we are right. Contrary to it, when we are trying to manipulate someone and it\'s not working, that situation makes us more stressful and act insane.\n\nMany of us have beliefs and opinions which we think are right and stuff ( talking politically I guess or of political+social forces and incidents) and therefore automatically assume that \'justice will be served\' , \'truth will prevail\', \' sacchi ki jai\' , etc because we are taught this and believe this. We think , "well that\'s the rule, so it will happen. ( Nothing for me to do here. Nothing to contribute or act. for me.)" In an ideal world , doing nothing would have worked. But now the situation is different. For every truth, you will have 20 lies by 20 people and 20 medias. Truth gets hidden because it\'s not in sight to see. Because when I open the news, look at twitter, see celebrity talks , search Google first page, what I am seeing the most vocalised , advertised/ payed stuff. But the people who were telling the truth didn\'t feel the need to pay to spread the truth . Sushruta wouldn\'t pay to teach surgery to random folks ????? Would a teacher now pay to teach students, would a doctor pay to attend to patients, similarly we see truth as this enlightened message /vibe/something that doens\'t need patrons ......but\n\nBut times have changed . Now researchers need to pay to get their research published. Scientist has to pay for the willing people to read him. I don\'t know what the cost of spreading his findings to the whole world would be...\n\nTherefore. Now we cannot sit back and let the magical truth do its own thing. We have to be vocal , we have communicate and express our opinions and concerns and issues and solutions and new insights , so that we and everybody else comes closer to reality of the facts.\n\nI think whoever the mods are or whoever would want to voluntarily create such a d/scord.\n\nBecause look at the other side.

They are fighting from every direction , at the same time.\n\nTruth will be lost , the forests will stop echoing it, if we stop talking about it, if we don\'t preserve and uplhold it.

      <li>Title::: 'The concept of "Tolerant Majority" and India\'s case'<br />Body: 'Civilized and \'fair\' nations follow policy which broadly translates to, "The majority needs to be tolerant of the minority". This means:\n\n* Minority\'s are given certain privileges, while the majority are treated as a general case.\n* Media does not exclusively point out if a criminal is a minority. OTOH media can if it is a majority, because it is (for some reason) said majority have the duty to be more morally responsible. \n* If media/majority, even backed with solid facts, point out that minorities or a certain minority is more often the culprit - it becomes minority oppression, politically. You\'ll be \n* The sociological defense is - if the minority subject of poverty, using their minority tag is false equivalence. It is poverty that causes them to behave in a certain way. \n\nThis is observed in most countries, but a lot of them are relatively secular (like true secular) so this does not bleed into general psyche. \n\nUnfortunately, India struggles with this concept because it follows this norm, which is also a double edged sword. Even if statistically proven, it is oppression. \n\nIMO, India is a Muslim country with a Hindu Majority. Surrounded by Muslim countries in a world which wishes to protect minorities. \n\nWho is in power here? When legal and moral obligations are quickly sacrificed for cultural and religious - what course is taken? Political. We know what that means.\n\nThis is great on paper. Even when one parses individuals, most want to live a normal life. Most people, regardless of background, don\'t go home trying to plot something.\n\nIMO, our choices of action needs to be determined by doing what\'s best for those who want to live peacefully (Across all communities). Again, on paper, the secular policies work out great. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are aware this is not the case with India, so we follow a policy that does not work in our case. No one is motivated to craft a better policy.\n\nSo what is the solution?

      <li>Title::: 'Some advice on coping with racism on the Internet'<br />Body: 'So we all know there\'s lots of racism against Indians and even other Asians such as Chinese people. I wanna discuss how to cope with this and I will also discuss coping with it in public\n\nSo nowadays, there is a lot of insecurity in the world. You see people being "depressed" and its now like a full on thing to discuss mental health (psychiatrists must be happy lol). In my personal experience, I first wanna say I am FAR from insecure. I used to be but what I did was not give a fuck what people think of me, I improved myself rather than dwelling, work rather than moan. But anyway enough about me. So what I noticed is that people who tend to be insecure are those who feel they have not accomplished much in life considering their age. They like to compare themselves to others to see how better of a person they are and such. I have "friends" who have done this to me. I have actually done an analysis on my friends considering their accomplishments and correlation to having to put others down. Those who are still doing their bachelors for 6 years (normally should be completed in 4 years) and have not gotten a graduate job yet tend to do what I mentioned. Those who have relationships, have a stable job and such are the opposite. So conclusion, those who haven\'t really accomplished anything like putting others down, or hell even those who have dealt with pressure from parents are also this.\n\nWe all know how toxic Reddit can be. Lets face it. We go onto the main  subs (i wont list them due to the rules of this sub, but its pretty obvious) and then we see all the negative and toxic comments about India  from alt-right or alt-left westerners. What to do about this? Well stay away from that shit. You will feel a LOT better, I just unsubbed from them and pretty much now stick to gaming subreddits and some Indian  ones. Also for sites like 4chan, have you even seen pics of them meeting  up. If not then if you have a look at this [pic](https://i.redd.it/qfqcvf6t4tf21.jpg) and this [pic](https://i.imgur.com/amrNKJe.jpg?fb), THESE are the people being racist to Indians. Better yet, search "4chan meetup" or "4chan meetup pol" on Google images. I also remember a post on AITA (such a shit sub with idiots on there). There was a post about dating Indian guys and they full on called them misogynistic. If you view these accounts, they were made 10 hours after the post was made. Then there have been several times when people pose as Indian women when Reddit is not popular in the country. Especially the losers who do this, the trolls and such\n\nOh and also, I have come to notice redditors tend to act like they know everything. *They DO NOT.* I have been analysing many redditor comments and have come to notice a lot of them like to lie because its easy here. There was a quote from a video game "***Too many people have opinions on things they know nothing about, and the more ignorant they are, the more opinions they have***". We all know how the biggest news subreddit on this site is, just lib-left circle jerks. Acting so confident that they know everything and basically screaming out blatant shit.\n\nSo basically just stay away from the shit subs, there are always people who are gonna be racist for a variety of reasons, learn to develop a "dont give a fuck" attitude. Also, theres an estimated 430 million people who use reddit. There are estimated 4.66 billion internet users. That is only 9% of all internet users. That too, I am willing to bet many accounts are fakes and trolls on reddit\n\nI wrote this post to help people by the way, I hope it helps you!'<br />Author: 'plebman1125'  id: 'lioqwt'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lioqwt/some_advice_on_coping_with_racism_on_the_internet/</li>

I have seen a lot of news covering about China-India relations, but they are either nationalist provoking articles from both sides, or some fake news with no meaningful content. An in-depth, detailed, and rational analysis is so rare, especially from the Chinese side on English internet. So I found a paper from a Chinese scholar(Mao Keji) and completed the translation work, hoping to provide you with a different perspective. Pakistanis told me that this sub is the real Indian sub, so I came here to meet real majority of Indians.\n\nAs we all know, Chinese media and scholars are generally supervised by the government, so such papers that can be officially published will inevitably be analyzed on the Chinese side. And unfortunately there is basically no "dove" in China on India issues, I can only find analysis you may see as hostile. I hope you can understand this when reading it, and try not to be triggered.\xa0**Corrections or**\n\n**refutations on this article are welcome and precious, and I will post them back to Chinese internet.**\n\nIf you have any questions about China you can leave comments below, maybe I can make a summary post to answer your questions.\n\nThis article is about 5000 words and would take about 10 min to finish.\n\n&gt;**The Internal Roots of India\'s Behaviour Against China | Mao Keji**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**1. The traditional political agenda of BJP\xa0is becoming saturated, and there is an urgent need to discover a new agenda**.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Hindu nationalist sectarian agenda and the development-focused economic agenda are the two hallmarks of the BJP. The two complement each other and alternately exert force\xa0for\xa0Modi’s win\xa0in 2014 and\xa02019. Since his re-election, in the context of declining economic growth rates in India, Modi has made unprecedented efforts to advance the sectarian agenda to consolidate the basics of voters, and has continuously achieved sectarian policy breakthroughs in a very short period of time. However, the Indian economy has not seen any improvement at present, and it is also due to a cliff-like decline due to Covid-19. At the same time, the sectarian policy has reached saturation after many breakthroughs. The two "engines" stalled at the same time, forcing Modi to find a new agenda for internal affairs in order to obtain incremental political support.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(1) Modi\'s economic agenda is lacklustre\xa0now, and unable to provide adequate performance support\xa0like before anymore since a long time ago.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For a long time, Modi relied on his outstanding political achievements in Gujarat to play the "economic development card" as a "development representative". After Modi won the 2014 general election, he immediately launched ambitious plans such as "Made in India", "Digital India", and "New India 2022". However, in addition to the "Abolition Order" and "GST Tax Reform", which\xa0were too rushed and the implementation was sloppy, Modi\'s first term of office did not effectively reform the land acquisition and labor regulations that had been tainted for many years. Affected by both structural and cyclical factors, the Indian economy under Modi’s rule not only failed to achieve breakthrough-level\xa0growth, but the growth rate plummeted to about 4% in the second half of 2019, and its manufacturing GDP even dropped to nearly The lowest point in 50 years. Although Modi still launched the goal of "$5 trillion economy" after his re-election in 2019, the lack of growth momentum and the difficulty of eradicating structural problems\xa0makes\xa0Modi\'s economic agenda difficult\xa0to realize. Given that India had been\xa0slipping\xa0into an economic recession before the outbreak of Covid-19, and after the epidemic, more financial resources were needed to relieve the epidemic and the economic crisis, the Modi government will find it difficult to raise enough\xa0resource\xa0for the rest of the second term\xa0for such\xa0strong economic development plan. It is precisely because the economic agenda cannot provide sufficient support for political performance, the Modi government placed great emphasis on the sectarian agenda during the second term.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(2) Modi concentrated on breaking through major controversial issues, and his sectarian agenda became saturated.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The BJP (and RSS)\xa0led by Modi is the representative\xa0of Hindu nationalism. The goal is to reshape a diverse, secular, and tolerate\xa0India into a "Hindu India", while unifying civil law issues (Uniform Civil Code), the issue of Article 370 of the Constitution and the issue of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya are the three main focuses of the sectarian agenda. In order to pursue economic performance and obtain more centrist voters, the Modi government played down the sectarian issue during the first term. However, due to the difficulty of the economic agenda and the expansion of parliamentary seats in the second term of the Modi government, its promotion of the sectarian agenda has been unprecedented since 2019: first, the "Muslim Three Tone Divorce Law" was imprisoned and the issue of unification of civil law was promoted. By repealing Article 370 of the Constitution, it deprived the Muslim-dominant Indian-controlled Kashmir of its autonomous status; it also promoted the reconstruction of the Hindu Ayodhya temple on the site of a mosque; it also introduced a civil law amendment that openly discriminated against Muslims. Despite the breakthroughs, this\xa0also means that the sectarian agenda is close to\xa0saturation afterwards, and it has consumed\xa0more resources to maintain social stability. In view of this, the BJP\xa0has to seek to advance a new agenda in the face of the epidemic and economic crisis.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**2. Faced with the triple pressures of the epidemic, the economy, and the border, "China card" becomes the first choice**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the context of traditional sectarian agendas and economic agendas that it is difficult to provide sufficient political support, playing the "China card" of showing strength against China has become the best option for the Modi government-almost all the problems currently encountered in India have been blamed on\xa0China, more or less. On the one hand, it helps the Modi government shirk its responsibilities in front of the opposition parties and ease the imminent ruling crisis; on the other hand, it helps the Modi government continue to mobilize public support by shaping the image of a powerful foreign enemy. Facts have proved that in the current Indian political arena, anti-China is not only an indisputable political correctness, but also an urgent political need, and it does not depend on what China does.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(1) The epidemic is still spreading, and the Modi government portrays\xa0China as the ultimate reason\xa0of its failure on handling it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As of mid-September 2020, India’s confirmed cases of Covid-19\xa0have exceeded 5 million with nearly 100,000 new cases\xa0daily. The future\xa0for epidemic control is\xa0not optimistic\xa0so far.\xa0Although the Modi government hurriedly introduced the world’s largest lockdown measures in late March 2020, in view of India’s poor medical and health conditions, dense urban and rural population, and backward development, the epidemic hasn’t been effectively controlled and it has produced \xa0serious impact\xa0on industrial production and life. In the face of the crisis of Covid-19, although the Indian government did not directly call Covid-19\xa0as\xa0"Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" like Trump did, it still condoned and acquiesced "smearing" against China. A large number of Indian media, think tanks, pro-government opinion leaders, and even local government leaders still use the "Chinese virus" and "Wuhan virus" extensively, and many reports even describe the epidemic as a "Chinese biological and chemical weapon attack." At present, it has become the mainstream view of Indian society to blame China for the epidemic crisis. According to a poll from India, most respondents believe that China should be responsible for the global epidemic. It can be said that the more serious the epidemic situation in India, the more questions from\xa0the opposition parties, the more inclined the Modi government will be to be hostile on\xa0China.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(2) Economic downturn, and Modi government regards China as the economic bane  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In recent years, the Indian economy has been heavily driven by credit and debt, coupled with the lagging structural reforms, the Indian economy has been weak in the second half of Modi\'s first term. Before the outbreak of Covid-19, India\'s economic growth rate fell for six consecutive quarters, from 8.92% in the first quarter of 2018 to 4.55% in the third quarter of 2019. All sectors of Indian society are seeking explanations, eager to find the "culprit." In recent years, Chinese manufacturing companies, Internet companies, engineering contracting companies, and economic and trade companies have flocked to enter the Indian market along with Japan, South Korea and have achieved outstanding results. In the background\xa0of India\'s economic difficulties, the better the performance of Chinese companies in India, the stronger the anti-China atmosphere will be. Therefore, since the outbreak of Covid-19, Modi has successively introduced a series of unprecedented anti-China economic policies such as restricting Chinese direct investment, restricting Chinese-funded enterprises\' bidding, and obstructing the customs clearance of Chinese products, which have damaged China\'s interests in India. For the Modi government, these policies are on the one hand to "find a way" for the dying Indian economy, and to cater to the economic nationalism of all parties in India at the expense of Chinese interests, thereby gaining domestic support, and on the other hand,\xa0to echo the "decoupling" proposed by the United States in order to win international support.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(3) The border problem\xa0and the Modi government regards China as a security threat  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In 2020, the situation in the Sino-Indian border area plummeted to the most tense situation since 1962. First, the Indian army illegally crossed the border on June 15 and China’s counterattack caused the first bloodshed in decades between the two countries. Then in August and September, the two sides confronted on the south bank of Pangong Lake\xa0and India side broke the the tradition of not using firearms. The border confrontation and frictions\xa0helped\xa0the Modi government to obtain domestic public support and set agendas for political gains domestically. As\xa0the background of the widening power gap between India and Pakistan, India’s political arena does not want\xa0to be on par with Pakistan anymore and hopes to be on par with\xa0China\xa0now,\xa0which is a popular trend in India. It more consciously regards China as the number one security threat, which makes anti-China a political need. It is worth noting that although the anti-China attitude is clear, the Modi government still has shown restraint and prudence in spite of the hard-line voice of the opposition party after the Indian army was frustrated. This shows that the ruling Modi government still knows the power gap,\xa0and is unwilling to over-stimulate China on the border issue and cause the situation to get out of control.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**3. Conclusions and recommendations**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(1) India’s domestically\xa0showing tough on\xa0China is becoming its political correctness and political need, so\xa0it is time to adjust judgments\xa0on India’s behavioral patterns  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Even if the epidemic situation in India improves and the economy recovers\xa0in future, the suspicion, anti-China\xa0and anti-Chinese sentiments in Indian politics will\xa0still remain within a certain range. At present, the BJP\xa0has its advantages in ideology and organizational capabilities, comparing to opposite parties. Even under the triple pressure of the epidemic, economy, and borders, it will\xa0still dominant\xa0federal and local levels of India, and will be learder of\xa0India for a long time. The BJP has been continuing\xa0to advance the process of Hindu nationalism, and it has been unable to meet its domestic mobilization needs by showing its strength to Pakistan, which is obviously weak in national power. Under this line of thinking, showing strength towards China has now become a sign of the BJP\'s toughness towards the outside world. Considering\xa0this, China should thoroughly analyze the BJP’s ambitions as a major power, fully consider the changes in its domestic perception and mentality caused by the rise of India, and accurately determine the domestic political logic behind its strength toward China, be prepared a possible qualitative change in Sino-Indian relations.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(2) India’s hostile on\xa0China is not decided by\xa0China’s behaviors. It\'s better to\xa0\xa0analyze and judge India’s behavior from the perspective of India’s internal affairs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For a long time, we have used to regard the interaction between China and India as an "independent variable", and India\'s China policy as a "dependent variable" affected by the former. However, the Modi government\'s recent series of actions show that the main driving force of the current actions stems from its internal political needs. It has an independent logical process and is not directly linked to the interaction between China and India. Therefore, it is advisable to treat India\'s actions against China as an "independent variable" that does not depend on China\'s subjective will, and to judge its behavior logic more from the perspective of India\'s internal affairs rather than real\xa0interaction. Furthermore, it is recommended to strengthen research on India’s domestic politics.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(3) Accurately grasp the short-sighted and incoherent characteristics of the policies of the Modi government and the BJP, follow the trend, be patient to\xa0again initiative  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;From\xa0the advantages of ideology and organizational capabilities, the BJP\xa0has demonstrated far more campaigning capabilities than other Indian political parties, and the Modi government has also shown far greater action capabilities than previous governments. However, campaign ability and action ability are not equal to ruling ability. The Modi government\'s "abolition of money order", GST tax reform, repeal of Article 370 of the Constitution, and amendments to the Citizenship Law all manifested "a vigorous beginning, a sloppy process, and a hasty end", and left lots of\xa0economic risks and hidden dangers. The BJP\xa0is no exception on the issue of China. Pursuing short-term political purposes undermining the hard-won bilateral trust and economic and trade ties between China and India will inevitably slow down India’s industrialization and modernization process, especially when India is the desperate need of FDI to complete industrialization, before Auto and AI take over in a not-far future. At a time\xa0China-India economic and trade ties have been severely hit and cannot be worse anymore, China should make full use of the short-sighted and incoherent characteristics of the BJP\xa0to prevent it from appearing too eager and causing \xa0contempts and misjudgment\xa0from BJP.

      <li>Title::: 'What I think of the language politics in India.'<br />Body: 'Post-independence as Indians, we have always taken pride in the linguistic diversity of India as all diverse nations do. However, there is a peculiar dichotomy of language being divisive and being something to take pride in. Perhaps, the pride of “unity in diversity” is unfounded. Why are there so many separatist movements around India with so much political and financial patronage? India doesn’t seem to be the odd one here, why are most democratic, culturally diverse countries are struggling to unite on an abstract idea of a nation? \n\nThe temptation to unite India under the umbrella of same language is not new and it’s also not exclusive to the “Indian right”. The INC switched to Hindi from English. Gandhi and Nehru were supporters of Hindi and Congress wanted to propagate the learning of Hindi in non-Hindi Provinces of India. Unfortunately, the expectation of uniting India under one language is based on a deceptive conjecture. Which is that people can be united as people have a natural inclination towards unity. \n\nHindi has never been the national language of India Since the idea of a national language was introduced. Most rational people don\'t seem too eager to have a "National Language". \n\nThe people who are bullish on the idea that India should have a single national language shouldn’t be critiqued with insults and profiling. They should be met with rational arguments because they are making the same mistake that most of the people on earth make. Nations fail to see the intrinsic disadvantage of diversity. Most of the people of India use Hindi and English as their second language irrespective of their mother language (Which they also use) just because of utility factor. People adopt new languages with the progression of time based on their serviceability.\n\nWhenever any political organization floats the idea of a Single Language being the "National language", it always creates a bigger split, it has already been used to divide Andhra Pradesh, also South India on a bigger level. It should be noted that is has always been used to divide India but it has done very little to unite us and the **“State Reorganization Act of 1956”** is a great example. The idea of dividing India along the lines of language or some equivalent attributes is older than independence. Madhusudan Das was the father of Odia nationalism, he led the movement to bifurcate Bihar and establish the Orissa province.\n\nThe language barrier has been a consistently unsolvable problem for BJP in south India. It’s a highly probable proposition that there is a subtle angst and distrust in south Indian demographics about the power of central administration being concentrated in north and when these things are discussed, we create a bigger divide that ultimately results in “political and cultural dominance” blame game. Language politics always gets coupled with politics of tribalism, intentionally by the local parties that play the division game and evidently it has never resulted in unity as a consequence. Learning from history has never been a part of many democratic societies because everyone has a self-righteous train of thought that has no historical reference. While we can ponder over the question of “Is there any utility to linguistic chauvinism” at any level, we can also understand the love of identity and it can be explained very beautifully by immigrants, refugees and people dealing with unfamiliar places. An African proverb summarizes my argument very elegantly and I quote “The child who is not embraced by the village, will burn it down to feel its warmth”.'<br />Author: 'vivekind'  id: 'liaqji'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/liaqji/what_i_think_of_the_language_politics_in_india/</li>

This council will recommend the government the syllabus to be taught, from which class law education should begin, qualification of teachers, etc. \n\n**Status: Pending**\n\n*Cost of Implementation (as per the Bill) = **Rs. 100 crore recurring cost per year**.*\n\nFollowing are the **objectives &amp; the reasons** for introducing the bill by the MP:\n\n&gt;STATEMENT OF OBJECT &amp; REASONS\n\n&gt;It has been generally believed among different sections and groups of the society that legal education is only for the law students, lawyers etc. However, basic legal education can play a very important role in our daily life. It is very necessary for every person to have certain basic knowledge of law, otherwise it would become very difficult for him to tackle several problems, from consumer protection to fundamental rights. There are certain laws and regulations, the basic knowledge of which is very necessary for every person. Lack of legal awareness and knowledge is the main reason that certain rights of a person get violated so easily.\n\n&gt;The main reason why a common man does not take the violation of his rights seriously is that he lives under a belief that he would have to pay certain amount to the concerned lawyer. Moreover, he is scared of the legal process and the judicial system of the country. And, indeed he is not wrong. But there is another way which can be used to know how your rights can be protected from being violated.\n\n&gt;It has been said that Knowledge is Power. It is the responsibility of education system to make a common man aware of his legal rights and how these legal rights can be saved. Current education system in schools lays emphasis on imparting quality education. However, it is missing out on legal education and is, therefore, incomplete without it.\n\n&gt;The Bill, therefore, seeks to provide for making legal education compulsory in all educational institutions right from primary school level to senior secondary level in order to make it a part of school curriculum.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on it?'<br />Author: 'vinamrsachdeva'  id: 'li8g01'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/li8g01/lok_sabha_bill_no_181_of_2016_the_compulsory/</li>

It has also been engaging in activism for the implementation of the RTE Act that works against Hindu-run institutions. Furthermore, it is also linked to a plethora of organizations across the country that seeks to undermine India’s territorial integrity.\n\nMembers of the Right to Food Campaign (RFC), an organization HRLN is linked to, were also involved in the protest against then CJI Ranjan Gogoi that sought to undermine the legitimacy of the Indian Judiciary.\n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2021/02/rona-wilson-forensic-report-propaganda-george-soros-canada-govt/\n\nAfter the government imposed restrictions on Soros funding NGOs in India in 2016, Soros has been channelling money into India via UK based orgs.\n\n&gt;Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative is registered under FCRA in New Delhi with a registration number, DL/231650671. It appears to work on the so-called ‘Right to Information (RTI), Police Reforms, Prison Reforms, and International Advocacy and Programming (IAP). CHRI’s current Director is Shri. Sanjoy Hazarika, Honorary Research Professor at Centre for Policy Research, Delhi, Senior Journalist and who is also on the Executive Committee of the Indian Police Foundation. \n\n&gt;Out of the Rs. 50 and odd Crore that it has received in the period 2006-2018, nearly a quarter has come from Open Society Foundation (donations from its sister organization Open Society Institute is also included in this entry). OSF/OSI are in Zug, Switzerland, Budapest, Hungary and in New York, USA.\n\n&gt;Donations from George Soros’ OSF/OSI stopped after 2016 since the Government of India’s Ministry of Home Affairs (FCRA Wing in particular) had placed the OSF/OSI into something called Prior Permission category, i.e., FCRA-NGOs can no longer received ‘donations’ from OSF/OSI directly, but need to seek a permission from MHA for every ‘donation’. \n\n&gt;Not just CHRI, but no NGO received foreign ‘donations’ from OSF/OSI. So, it is clear that MHA did not let in any ‘donation’ from OSF/OSI, directly.\n\n&gt;Interestingly, a new ‘donor’ to CHRI emerged in the year 2018, i.e., CHRI-UK. It donates a whopping Rs. 2.1 Crore that year.\n\n&gt;CHRI-UK is registered as a Charity (Charity No. 803235 and Company No. 02488240) in the United Kingdom. \n\n&gt;An examination of CHRI-UK’s financial records at UK’s Companies House (unlike India’s MCA, UK’s Companies House gives out for free, all company related Documents to all, online) reveals that it had an income of about GBP 50,000 in the year 1998, with grants from the Foreign Office of UK Government and the European Commission.\n\n&gt;It is thus established that CHRI-UK has had not much of ‘Income’ until 2017. However, in its  Full Accounts submission for the year 2017-18, it reports the receipt of huge grants from Foundation to Promote Open Society (GBP 1,33,732) and Foundation Open Society Institute (GBP 18,971). It receives, pretty much, no other income that year.\n\nhttps://indiahap.wordpress.com/2020/10/08/foreign-donations-are-my-birthright-and-i-will-certainly-attain-it/\n\nBefore I end this post, a final disclaimer. Please don\'t construe this post to mean that Soros is the only US establishment billionaire working to recolonise India. There are many like him from Omidyar to Google to Dorsey (enumerating their achievements is outside scope of this post, but hopefully I manage to someday).

      <li>Title::: 'I am Chinese. Ask me anything about China/PRC.'<br />Body: 'Namaskaar Indian folks, I am Chinese, generally interested in India (mostly politics, geopolitics and economic).\n\nI have stayed sufficiently long both inside and outside of China. I know several Indian Bhai in person, and have seen a lot common misunderstandings from your people towards China/PRC. So after lurking in this community for a long time, I decide to have a friendly conversation with you.\n\nYou may ask me anything about China/PRC. Especially I look forward to those of government, politics, geopolitics\xa0and economic. I would response to any friendly questions. I can start with a few questions frequently asked by my (Indian) schoolmates:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think of your government for taking away your freedom and democracy?\n\n\\- It depends on how you define freedom and democracy. By the definition of our government, for our citizens who once suffered hunger and poverty, freedom and democracy to them is sufficient food, clean water, stable power supply, and luxuriously, affordable education. In delivery of those, our government has been doing an excellent job.\n\nAnd speaking of Youtube, Facebook, and Twitter, we don\'t have such freedom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo you like this authoritarian government?\n\n\\- I don\'t recognize all their policy but I understand most and I witness many many great changes they brought to this country. If I have to summarize, our economy size was 1/9 of Japan\'s in 1991, and 3 times larger now.\n\nI think the question “Why do Chinese people endorse such an authoritarian government" is in the end all about Maslow\'s hierarchy of needs: When you are hungry, all you can dream of is bread and water. As your life improves, you ask for a car, a cozy house, the right to talk freely on Facebook and Twitter. For the case of Chinese citizens, those who struggle or once struggled with bread and water are much much more grateful to this government than those who ask for Facebook and Twitter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave you been stealing technology from the US/Soviet Union to succeed?\n\n\\- Let\'s discuss how to steal in a practical manner:\n\nIf you mean getting the blueprint of F-22 or Russian thrust engines, you have to believe that bureaucracy in Washington and Moscow is intelligent enough to prevent this from happening systemically: Take the case of F-22, no Chinese is allowed to be employed by Lockheed Martin, not even Obama and Trump since Obama\'s father and Trump\'s mother were not American citizens.\n\nIf you mean reverse engineering existing products, then the current protocol is, most governments in the world forbid trade with foreign government on valuable national assets. F-22 was never on sell, neither is any advanced Russian/Chinese jets. Even for the weapons for sell, the sold versions are commonly downgraded to prevent potential leakage of top technology. Even you magically have access to all these top notch, reverse engineering is never an easy task: I\'m sure you are currently using CPUs from Intel or Qualcomm, are you capable of replicating one?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think about Uyghurs and are they being massacred?\n\n\\- Let me put it as neutral as possible: The government is carrying out aggressive modernization in Xinjiang (Uyghurs), abandoning a lot pre-modern uncultured local custom/convention. Should there be any genocide or even blood, news and videos would be spreading to every corners of Internet. (Think about Hong Kong.)\n\ninteresting reads:\n\n["People are shocked that more than 1000 gas cannisters were used in Hong Kong since June 9. No one said anything when France used more than 10,000 PER DAY at the height of the Yellow Vests\' protests."](https://np.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/cmp41p/people_are_shocked_that_more_than_1000_gas/)\n\n[Is there evidence for claims of China harvesting organs from Uighur prisoners?](https://np.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ft90xn/is_there_evidence_for_claims_of_china_harvesting/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre you a member of CCP?\n\n\\- I\'m not, but both my parents are. In their opinion, I am basically ... a liberal hippie.'<br />Author: 'putongren0'  id: 'li6kzx'<br />Score:90<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/li6kzx/i_am_chinese_ask_me_anything_about_chinaprc/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'A little analysis of the Left wing ecosystem from a liberal'<br />Body: "Basically I think that the left can be very crudely classified into three layers. At the very bottom are the folks who are emotionally driven (compassionate) but are slightly naive. These would be the folks in the US who think it's cruelty to deport illegal immigrants. Or the people who wants to subsidise everything for everyone while not paying any taxes themselves. \n\nThe next layer are the group that mostly capitalises on the hype. Think about the social media who play into the emotions of the first group for profit. These are guys like Rathee or media houses building on TRP etc. Even celebrities like Emma Watson who support giving asylum to illegals with criminal backgrounds while living in a protected rich neighborhood herself. The said celebrity therefore gains moral brownie points without losing anything or putting in any real effort. You can even see this with a lot of the feminists, they're quick to protest over something minor in a liberal country while being totally quiet over real issues elsewhere. It's easy moral points or views. \n\nThe topmost layer are the ones with the real agenda. They don't truly care about the masses but use this whole structure as a way to gain power. These are all the bigwigs like Stalin who came into power on the backs of the working class and intellectuals, most of them were thrown into the gulags or bumped off once he came into power. Also once this group gains power they squash any kind of dissent, cause they know very well how they themselves used it to topple the older powers. If you look carefully, a pattern will emerge where these guys coming opt various cause, be it LGBT or feminism. Basically you'd have a marginalised folks, these guys will enter into their struggle, fighting for their cause. In the process they quickly gain leadership of these causes. There after they subtly use these causes to gain more power over others. Critics gets silenced easily cause a lot of these moments seem to have a high moral ground. Think about it, be it immigrants or LGBTQ, it's very easy to paint any critique as intolerance. You see the same bs happening with Greta, these sly b****** coopted the green moment and ontop of that used a child as the mascot. Any critique can be painted as callous disregard of nature or taunting of a poor innocent child by vicious evil people. \n\nThe recent toolkit fiasco sheds more light onto the political nature of the puppet Greta. \n\nAnyhow, this got a lot bigger than I had originally imagined. So I shall stop. Also, I'm a slightly left leaning liberal but the other far left sub would probably classify me as a right winger. I know you like to use that colourful term for liberals but the folks in that sub are actually authoritarian far left."<br />Author: 'CommonCantaloupe2'  id: 'lhv3xd'<br />Score:61<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lhv3xd/a_little_analysis_of_the_left_wing_ecosystem_from/</li>

Hence the influence of Chinese companies / CCP on WHAT should be shown in Hollywood.  \n\n\n[https://www.newsweek.com/china-uses-hollywood-its-information-warfare-campaign-opinion-1566300](https://www.newsweek.com/china-uses-hollywood-its-information-warfare-campaign-opinion-1566300)  \n\n\nDoes this \'boycott culture\' date back thousands of years ?   \n\n\nlong read : [https://acdemocracy.org/the-fifth-generation-warfare/](https://acdemocracy.org/the-fifth-generation-warfare/)  \n\n\nsome muslim scholars claim that buying anything (NOT just meat) from a non-muslim (kaffir) when a muslim seller is available, is haraam.  \n\n\n"The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) bought from the Jews, but if a Muslim turns away from dealing with his fellow Muslim for no good reason – such as deceit or high prices or bad products – and he prefer to buys from kaafirs with no reason, that is haraam, because it implies that one is befriending the kuffaar, approving of them and liking them, and because it involves reducing the Muslims’ business and preventing them from selling their goods"  \n\n\n[https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20732/boycotting-the-products-of-kuffaar-who-are-hostile-towards-islam](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20732/boycotting-the-products-of-kuffaar-who-are-hostile-towards-islam)  \n\n\nmore wisdom  :   \n\n\nThere is no doubt that it is prescribed to engage in jihad against the enemies of Allaah, Jews and others, with our lives and our wealth. That includes every means that will weaken their economy and cause them harm. Money is the lifeblood of wars ancient and modern.\xa0\n\nThe Muslims in general should cooperate in righteousness and piety and help the Muslims in all places in ways that will lead them to prevail and strengthen them and enable them to manifest the symbols of religion, to practise the teachings of Islam and to implement the rulings of sharee’ah and carry out hudood punishments, and whatever will lead to their victory over the kuffaar, Jews, Christians and others. They should strive their hardest in jihad against the enemies of Allaah with all the means at their disposal. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Strive against the mushrikeen with your wealth, your lives and your tongues (speech).” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2504; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.\xa0\n\nThe Muslims have to help the mujaahideen as much as they can, and do everything that will strengthen Islam and the Muslims. They must also strive against the kuffaar in whatever ways they can, and do everything they can to weaken the kuffaar and the enemies of Islam. They should not employ them as workers such as typists, accountants, engineers or servants in any kind of service that gives them more power to collect the wealth of the Muslims and use it against them.\xa0  \n\n  \n[https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20732/boycotting-the-products-of-kuffaar-who-are-hostile-towards-islam](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20732/boycotting-the-products-of-kuffaar-who-are-hostile-towards-islam)  \n\n\n**So what can Hindus learn from this ?**   \n\n\nFIRST : Economic choice / boycott is a legal, non-violent way of achieving desired objectives. No constitution can force me to watch XYZ movie or sit in auto of ABC. Its my fundamental right to choose.  \n\n\nSECOND : Economic choice / boycott  has been practised for thousands of years. It is just a tool to achieve broader objectives. Just like a knife can cut vegetables or throats,  choosing WHERE to buy from almost always results in better result for the customers (multiplexs vs single cinema, Iphone vs android, etc)  \n\n\nTHIRD : Safety of your life / family / wealth / health / car is YOUR responsibility.   \n\n\nWe double check the lock of our car in shady neighbourhoods,   \n\n\nstay away from get-rich-quick schemes to preserve wealth  \n\n\neat organic food and exercise to maintain top health  \n\n\nWhat about life ?   \n\n\nI dont mean life insurance. Its good to plan for after your death / murder, but even better to delay it.  \n\n\nSafety of girls is a common topic these days. girls are encouraged to carry pepper spray / knife to protect themselves from r@pe / molestation.  \n\n\nDid your mother give you any advise how you, as a man, can physically protect yourself ? Will the mother of a teenage girl in India OUTSOURCE the safety of her daughter to Indian police ?   \n\n\nIT IS THE MORAL DUTY AND CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF YOU, A INDIAN MAN, TO DEFEND YOURSELF FROM ALL PHYSICAL THREATS.   \n\n\nCarrying a gun is illegal (without license) in India. An Indian mother probably wouldn\'t gift one to her daughter on 16th bday. But she can enroll her in judo class / gift her a pepper spray.  \n\n\nWhat can you, an MAN, do to protect yourself, LEGALLY ?   \n\n\nIn the end, I would share a 10min video of Virathu, a Buddhist monk who led the movement of 969, mostly led by 12 year old Buddhist monk kids, to physically protect themselves and their women, without violence.   \n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GE7BI4f0VE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GE7BI4f0VE)'<br />Author: 'desiluke1080'  id: 'lhtwdl'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lhtwdl/why_muslims_boycotted_french_perfumes_is_economic/</li>

      <li>Title::: "If Virus could be considered guilty for Joy Lobo's suicide in 3 idiots, then so must Gandhi be held guilty for Bhagat Singh's hanging. Corroborated using original sources. No conjecture or hearsay."<br />Body: "Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged on 23rd March, 1931. Eighteen days prior, on 5th March, Gandhi had signed a pact with the then viceroy Lord Irwin, called the Gandhi-Irwin Pact or the Delhi Pact. As part of the pact, both Gandhi (as the leader of the Congress party) and Irwin (as the representative of the British) agreed to each other's certain demands. Curiously, Gandhi had not demanded clemency for Bhagat Singh under the pact.\n\n# As we proceed, a brief timeline of the period would come handy:\n\n* Oct, 1928: Lala Lajpat Rai (Lalaji) is beaten brutally by the police while leading the anti-Simon protest in Lahore.\n* Nov, 1928: Lalaji succumbs to the injuries.\n* Dec, 1928: Bhagat Singh and others kill the Asst. SP John Saunders to avenge Lalaji's death. They escape successfully.\n* Apr, 1929: Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt throw two bombs into the Central Assembly chamber, meant not to harm anyone, but only to 'make the deaf hear.' Afterwards both could have escaped, but chose to get themselves arrested.\n* Mar-Apr, 1930: Gandhi undertakes the Dandi March and launches civil disobedience movement.\n* Oct, 1930: A tribunal orders death sentence for Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.\n* Nov, 1930-Jan, 1931: First Round Table Conference (RTC) happens to discuss political reforms for India. Congress boycotts it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 1st RTC did not lead to much positive outcome. While civil disobedience movement still continued. To make a headway, then, the British decided to engage the Congress party. Its culmination was the Gandhi-Irwin Pact.\n\nIt is a moot point whether the British would have accepted repealing Bhagat Singh's death sentence as a condition under the pact. But no serious effort was made by Gandhi is certain.\n\nYes, the pact had provisions for withdrawal of prosecutions and release of prisoners.  But these provisions applied only to those prisoned in the civil disobedience movement, and not guilty of violence. Clearly it didn't apply to Bhagat Singh.\n\n# Netaji Bose on Gandhi's attitude to Bhagat Singh's question:\n\n&gt; Pressure was brought to bear upon the Mahatma to try to save the lives of these young men and it must be admitted that he did try his very best. On this occasion, I ventured the suggestion that he should if necessary, break with the viceroy on the question, because the execution was against the spirit, if not the letter, of the Delhi Pact. . . *But the Mahatma who did not want to identify himself with the revolutionary prisoners, would not go so far and it naturally made a great difference when the Viceroy realised that the Mahatma would not break on that question.* (Italics added)\n\n\\- Bose, The Indian Struggle, 1920-42\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Gandhi-Irwin talks\n\nThe Delhi pact, signed on March, 5 (1931) was a result of several talks that Gandhi and Irwin had starting 17th Feb, 1931 onwards. Irwin used to make a note of these talks.\n\nOn Feb, 18, Irwin notes:\n\n&gt;In conclusion, and not connected with the above, he mentioned the case of Bhagat Singh. *He did not plead for commutation. . .* but ask\\[ed\\] for *postponement in present circumstances.*\n\nGandhi's version does not contradict Irwin's. His private secretary Mahadev Desai, who used to record everything of Gandhi's life, wrote in his diary:\n\n&gt;I talked about Bhagat Singh. I told him \\[Irwin\\]: 'This has no connection with our discussion, and it *may even be inappropriate on my part to mention it*. But if you want to make the present atmosphere more favourable, you should *suspend* Bhagat Singh's execution. The viceroy liked this very much. He said: '*I am grateful to you that you have put this thing before me in this manner.* Commutation of sentence is a difficult thing, but suspension is definitely worth considering.\n\nAt this point, Gandhi is only demanding suspension of the sentence, and not commutation (that is replacing death sentence with life imprisonment).\n\nDesai continues:\n\n&gt;I \\[Gandhi\\] myself would release him \\[Bhagat Singh\\] but *I cannot expect any government to do so. I would not take it ill even if you \\[viceroy\\] do not give any reply to this issue.*\n\n# Days leading to the hanging\n\nThe Congress party had decided to convene a session in Karachi on Mar, 24, 1931 to endorse the Gandhi-Irwin pact. And Bhagat Singh too was to be hanged that day.\n\nGandhi was wary that the execution might impinge on the Congress session. So on March 19, he voiced these concerns to the viceroy as well as to the Home Secretary, Herbert Emerson. Emerson recorded the conversation:\n\n&gt;I then asked him if he had seen in the papers that the Governor-General in Council had rejected the petition for mercy on behalf of Bhagat Singh. He \\[Gandhi\\] said that he had and that he was apprehensive regarding the consequences. . . I did explain to him that the question as to whether it should take place before or after the Karachi Congress had been seriously considered by the government... \\[and\\] *he agreed that of the two alternatives it is better not to wait*, but he suggested, *though not seriously*, that the third course of commutation of the sentence would have been better still. *He did not seem to me to be particularly concerned about the matter.*\n\nThe Congress historian Pattabhi Sitaramayya corroborates this:\n\n&gt;Any way Lord Irwin was unable to help in the matter, but undertook to secure a postponement of the execution till after the Karachi Congress... *but Gandhi himself definitely stated to the Viceroy that if the boys should be hanged, they had better be hanged before the Congress than after.* \n\nIt was only on the day of execution (Mar, 23) that Gandhi wrote a letter to Irwin asking him to consider commutation. Had Gandhi taken such a stand a month before when the talks started, he might have been able to save Bhagat Singh. \n\nAs the revolutionary and writer Manmathnath Gupta wrote, 'it is evident from Gandhi's own letter to Emerson that *he was not at all emotionally involved in the imminent hanging of the three youths* in the way in which the whole of India, including Nehru and Bose, were.'\n\nIn his memoir *Fullness of days* that Irwin published in 1957, he wrote that between proceeding with execution on the scheduled date, commutation, and postponement till after Congress session, 'the first course alone was possible in spite of all its attendant difficulties. *Mr. Gandhi thought for a moment, and then said, 'Would your excellency see any objection to my saying that I pleaded for the young man's life?'*\n\nHere Gandhi is seeking Irwin's complicity in misguiding Indian people.\n\n# In conclusion\n\nBhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged one day before the scheduled date, on 23rd March. Afterwards Gandhi said he 'pleaded with the Viceroy as best as I could. I brought all the persuasion at my command to bear on him.'\n\nIf Gandhi's pleadings and 'all the persuasion' at his command could not free three young lives, isn't it unjust then to credit him with freeing hundreds of millions of Indians from British rule?\n\nPast cannot be changed, but it can be seen anew. As Proust said, 'the real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.'\n\nAnd with these new eyes, I can say of Gandhi: Not My Mahatma."<br />Author: 'MagadhKing'  id: 'lhgylp'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lhgylp/if_virus_could_be_considered_guilty_for_joy_lobos/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh’s statement in Rajya Sabha on ‘Present Situation in Eastern Ladakh'<br />Body: ' \n\n**Hon’ble Chairman,**\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The House would recall that I had made a detailed statement on the developments in the India-China border areas in Eastern Ladakh during the last session in September last year. I had highlighted that the Chinese side had since April/May 2020 amassed large number of troops and armaments in the border areas adjacent to Eastern Ladakh.\xa0 It had also made several attempts to transgress the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in various parts. These actions of the Chinese side had been detected and appropriately responded to by our armed forces. The House and the Nation had also paid homage to the brave Indian soldiers who had made the supreme sacrifice and laid down their lives in the cause of defending the territorial integrity of India.I would today like to apprise the House of certain important developments since then.\n\nSince last September, both sides have maintained communication with each other through military and diplomatic channels.\xa0 Our objective was to effect disengagement and maintain status quo along the LAC so as to restore peace and tranquility.\n\nLet me briefly recapitulate the main aspects of the situation on the ground. As the House is aware, China illegally occupied approximately 38,000 sq. kms in the Union Territory of Ladakh, mainly during the 1962 conflict. In addition, under the so-called Sino-Pakistan ‘Boundary Agreement’ of 1963, Pakistan illegally ceded 5,180 sq. kms. of Indian territory in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir to China. China, thus is in illegal occupation of more than 43,000 sq. kms of Indian territory.It also claims approximately 90,000 sq. kms. of Indian territory in the Eastern Sector of the India-China boundary in Arunachal Pradesh. India has never accepted this illegal occupation of our territory or the unjustified claims.\n\nI would like to add here that India has consistently maintained that while bilateral relations can develop in parallel with discussions on resolving the boundary question, any serious disturbance in peace and tranquility along the LAC in the border areas is bound to have adverse implications for the direction of our bilateral ties. The Chinese side is well aware of our position. In fact, various high level Joint Statements have acknowledged this point that maintenance of peace and tranquility along the LAC in the border areas is a fundamental premise for development of relations.\n\nTheactions by the Chinese side since last year have seriously disturbed peace and tranquility. Consequentlythey have also had an impact on the overall relationship. In our various high level interactions with the Chinese side, including in my own meeting with Chinese Defence Minister last September, my colleague the External Affairs Minister Shri Jaishankarji’s meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister and NSA Shri Doval’s conversation with his Chinese counterpart, we have made it clear that the foremost need was to ensure disengagement in all the friction points along the LAC in the Western Sector so as to help restore peace and tranquility.\n\n**Hon’ble Chairman,**\n\nI had apprised the House last year that there were several friction areas in Eastern Ladakhalong the LAC. In addition, the Chinese side had mobilized a large number of troops and armaments along the LAC as well as in the depth areas. Our armed forces too had made adequate and effective counter deployments in these areas to ensure that India’s security interests were fully protected.\n\nI am proud to say that our Armed Forces have responded to the challenges posed by the unilateral Chinese action and have shown valour and courage on bothSouth and North bank of Pangong Tso.\xa0 Many strategically important points were identified and our troops positioned themselves at those Hill Tops and at locations which were very important from our point of view.\xa0 It is because of this great bravery of our Armed Forces in the face of harsh adverse climatic conditions that we maintained the edge.\xa0 Our Armed Forces proved yet again that territorial integrity of our country remains safe in their hands and their grit and determination to safeguard our borders is unwavering.\n\nOver the last year, we have maintained diplomatic and military engagement with the Chinese side. In these discussions, we have maintained the three key principles that determine our approach: (i) both sides should strictly respect and observe the LAC; (ii) neither side should attempt to alter the status quo unilaterally; and (iii) all agreements and understandings between the two sides must be fully abided by in their entirety.\xa0 To ensure disengagement in friction points along the LAC, it was our view that troops of both sides, who are now in close proximity, should vacate the forward deployments made in 2020 and return to the permanent and accepted bases.\n\n**Hon’ble Chairman,**\n\nOur approach and strategy for negotiations with the Chinese side has been guided at the highest level by the \xa0Hon’ble Prime Minister’s resolve that we will not give even an inch of Indian territory.\xa0 Our tenacity and approach during talks have yielded results.\n\nSince September 2020, based on the policy guidance, military and diplomatic officials of both sides have met several times to work out a mutually acceptable solution for disengagement. Till date, there have been 9 rounds of meetings of the Senior Commanders of both sides.\xa0 Diplomatic talks have continued in parallel under the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC).\n\n**Hon’ble Chairman,**\n\nI am happy to inform the House today that as a result of our well thought out approach and sustained talks with the Chinese side, we have now been able to reach an agreement on disengagement in the North and South Bank of the Pangong Lake. It has also beenagreed to convene the next meeting of the Senior Commanders within 48 hours after the complete disengagement in the Pangong Lake area so as to address and resolve all other remaining issues.\n\nThe agreement that we have been able to reach with the Chinese side for disengagement in the Pangong lake area envisages that both sides will cease their forward deployments in a phased, coordinated and verified manner.\xa0 The Chinese side will keep its troop presence in the North Bank area to east of Finger 8.Reciprocally, the Indian troops will be based at their permanent base at Dhan Singh Thapa Post near Finger 3. A similar action would be taken in the South Bank area by both sides. These are mutual and reciprocal steps and any structures that had been built by both sides since April 2020 in both North and South Bank area will be removed and the landforms will be restored. It has also been agreed to have a temporary moratorium on military activities by both sides in the North Bank, including patrolling to the traditional areas. Patrolling will be resumed only when both sides reach an agreement in diplomatic and military talks that would be held subsequently. The implementation of this agreement has started yesterday in the North and South Bank of the Pangong Lake. It will substantially restore the situation to that existing prior to commencement of the standoff last year.\n\n13.\xa0\xa0 I want to assure this House that in these talks we have not conceded anything. The House should also know that there are still some outstanding issues with regard to deployment and patrolling at some other points along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh.\xa0 These will be the focus of further discussions with the Chinese side. We have agreed that both sides should achieve complete disengagement at the earliest and abide fully by the bilateral agreements and protocols. By now, the Chinese side is also fully aware of our resolve. It is therefore our expectation that the Chinese side will work with us in full sincerity to resolve these remaining issues.\n\n**Hon’ble Chairman,**\n\nI would like this House to join me in paying gratitude to our armed forces who have shown grit and resolve under these extremely harsh climatic conditions of Ladakh which has resulted in the present agreement.Our Nation will always remember the sacrifices made by our brave soldiers which has been the foundation of this disengagement at Pangong Tso Lake.\n\n**Hon’bleChairman**,\n\nI am confident that this entire House, irrespective of political affiliations, is united together for upholding our sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity and national security. And further, this House is one in sending out the same message demonstrating the strength and unity of our Nation to the entire world.\n\nJai Hind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.rajnathsingh.in/speeches-in-english/raksha-mantri-shri-rajnath-singhs-statement-in-rajya-sabha-on-present-situation-in-eastern-ladakh/](https://www.rajnathsingh.in/speeches-in-english/raksha-mantri-shri-rajnath-singhs-statement-in-rajya-sabha-on-present-situation-in-eastern-ladakh/)'<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'lhe5n5'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lhe5n5/raksha_mantri_shri_rajnath_singhs_statement_in/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'TIL: Britain abolished slavery in its empire in 1833, except in India'<br />Body: 'I saw the recent video by the Dominican PM about Indian vaccines, and I admit I had to look up where the country was. Turns out it\'s an island in the Caribbean, a member of the Commonwealth. For those of you that don\'t know, there are many Indian-origin communities that live in that region, about 2.5 million as per one estimate. Indeed, in Suriname, Guyana (which are culturally part of the Caribbean despite being in mainland South America) and Trinidad &amp; Tobago, they are the largest ethnic group, with Sarnami (also called Caribbean Hindustani), a dialect of Bhojpuri, being one of the major languages spoken in Suriname. \n\n# Background\n\nHow did so many Indians reach halfway across the world? It was slavery by another name. By the late 18th century, slavery was frowned upon in Europe even as it fueled the economy of the Americas. European colonies produced sugarcane and cotton, two crops that required a lot of manual labour, which generated demand for slaves that were mainly brought by force from Africa in inhuman conditions. Eventually, anti-slavery movements in Europe grew, many fueled by Christian groups that saw it as an abomination (it may be noted that pro-slavery groups also used Christianity to justify their stance, seeing it as a means to bring "civilization" to "savages"). \n\n# Slavery abolished, almost\n\nEventually, the anti-slavery camp won. Britain had lost its 13 colonies to the American Revolution, but it still controlled Canada, Suriname, Guyana, and many islands in the Caribbean. In 1833, Parliament in London passed the Slavery Abolition Act, formally "An Act for the Abolition of Slavery throughout the British Colonies; for promoting the Industry of the manumitted Slaves; and for compensating the Persons hitherto entitled to the Services of such Slaves." As the long title suggests, it ended slavery and established compensation funds for both former slave owners and newly-freed slaves. By this time, most European countries had also abolished slavery.\n\nRead the full act here: [https://www.pdavis.nl/Legis\\_07.htm](https://www.pdavis.nl/Legis_07.htm)\n\nHowever, at the very end of the act was this little insertion:\n\n&gt;LXIV. And be it further enacted, That nothing in this Act contained doth or shall extend to any of the Territories in the Possession of the *East India* Company, or to the Island of *Ceylon*, or to the Island of *Saint Helena*. \n\nSo here was the situation: in the Caribbean, plantation owners were hungry for labour, the cheaper the better, and were pretty mad at being forced to give up their slaves from Africa. They did not want to pay their labout a fair compensation, but the law prohibited them from doing so, unless the labour came from India. Loophole, did you say?\n\n# The Indian Slave Trade\n\nOne man\'s loophole is another colonial company\'s business opportunity. In 1837, sensing the massive monopoly they had just been granted, the East India Company laid down regulations for the export of Indian slaves from their capital, Calcutta. Of course, "slavery" was a bad word, so the regulations laid down many rules about conditions of pay, term of labour, right to return, etc. They were called indentured labourers, because "slaves" was too American apparently. The scheme was soon extended to Madras as well, which the Company had also conquered during the Carnatic Wars (The Seven Years War in Europe). \n\nThe catch with all these regulations was that they were not created by Britain, but by the Company. Therefore, it could only be enforced by the Company. So there would be a complex set of rules to follow while in India, but once the labourers, of their "free will" of course, got onto a ship, they were at the mercy of the plantation owners. These owners had no desire to let this cheap source of labour go back home after the end of their contract, and a system of renouncing the right to return, withholding pay, seizing identity documents, and encouraging women to be exported (so that they would establish a family in the plantations and make it harder to go back) was soon setup. Of course, the colonial governments in those islands were pretty tardy with following their own rules as well, let alone reporting back to the Company. Not unlike the slave markets of the Middle East that Kerala Communists appear to be so proud of, I will add.\n\nThere were protests by anti-slavery people in Britain, and the scheme was turned on and off in fits and spurts. But it was such a roaring success in the Caribbean that by the 1860s (*after* the Company was abolished and the Crown took direct control of India), the French joined in, using their ports in Pondicherry and Reunion island to fuel whatever colonies they had left in the Caribbean. The Danes also joined eventually. It was a full-fledged slave market facilitated by the British occupiers, of course with a lot of promises and regulations on paper. India, once the richest land in the world, was forced to literally sell her own people, such was the complete defeat and humiliation of a once-great civilization. In the approximately 80 years of the system, over 2.5 million Indian men and women were thrown into slavery by another name, not just to the Caribbean but to other colonies in Africa as well (which is why Mauritius has such a large Indian-origin population too).\n\n# End of Indian Slavery\n\nNaturally, the system of indentured labour was unpopular among Indian nationalists, but they hardly had much of a say in the matter. However, by 1905, the British had granted limited self-government in India, although the Governor-General mostly vetoed everything. There was some noise against the system in the Imperial Legislative Council in Calcutta, duly acknowledged and faithfully ignored by the colonial regime in London. Until WW1, when they realized they needed even more Indian bodies to fight the war of the European kings and princes. This was a turning point, because the British finally had to make concessions to Indian nationalists lest they be defeated in Europe.\n\nAs part of these concessions, the Imperial Legislative Council abolished indentured labour. **British Parliament in London never abolished slavery in India**, it was the colonial legislature in Calcutta that did it. Even then, the Governor-General agreed to sign the law because the system was getting too expensive to run, not because they found some hitherto latent respect for Indian life. Still, the practice had been established, and even Indians in India started using it: the bonded labour system was born and, despite the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act of 1976, there are still pockets of it in existence today. In many of the brick kilns from Saharanpur, UP all the way to Odisha, don\'t be surprised if you see entire families working as labourers to pay off the debts of their forefathers.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nSo today, when you see British-developed and Indian-manufactured vaccines being shipped by the millions to countries in Africa and the Caribbean, remember the old bond between the Indian-origin people there and these two countries that determined their destiny. Remember the fallen, remember the enslaved, and remember the consequences of failing to stay ahead of the world. For, if our private sector had not established a strong pharma and biotech industry in India, can you imagine how many phone calls would we have had to make to buy a few doses from Britain? \n\nActually, you don\'t have to imagine, Midnight\'s other child (Pakistan) is begging for Chinese vaccines while being on the COVAX list of countries waiting for the WHO to donate vaccines to them, most if it made, ironically, in India. Our success is not guaranteed, but the cost of failure is great.'<br />Author: 'ididacannonball'  id: 'lh488v'<br />Score:158<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lh488v/til_britain_abolished_slavery_in_its_empire_in/</li>

On top of these issues, the authorities’ handling \rof the coronavirus pandemic has also led to a further erosion of civil liberties in 2020.\r\n\r\n**Any public surveys that have been conducted?**  \r\nMaybe.

An essay outlining a possible course of action.'<br />Body: 'Modi govt has done amazing on the tech front-\n\nNational AI policy, REM strategy, 8000 crore for Quantum Technology research, UPI and IndiaStack, 2 of our private companies have developed fully indigeneous 5G systems. We are developing cutting edge space (MOM, Gaganyaan) and defence tech too (5 gen jet, hypersonic delivery vehicles, AI swarms).\n\nBut now its time for a bigger action.\n\nPrime Minister Modi should launch a digital rupee – and back it with digital gold.\n\nIndia should launch a digital rupee – and back it with digital gold. More broadly, India should champion decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to safeguard national security, prevent deplatforming, attract international capital, strengthen monetary policy, deter financial fraud, accelerate technological development, and hasten India’s ascendance as a global power.\n\nWe make this case below. But if you haven\'t been following cryptocurrency closely, or India\'s proposed ban, don\'t worry. Our first step is to review the basics for folks new to the space before explaining why Prime Minister Modi should buy Bitcoin rather than ban Bitcoin, and how India can use crypto to regain its rightful place on the world stage.\n\n**1. Cypto is now a Trillion Dollar Industry**\n\nBitcoin was invented in 2009 by a pseudonymous engineer named Satoshi Nakamoto. His creation solved an unsolved problem in computer science and created a trillion dollar industry.\n\nYes, you read that right: trillion. In June 2010 the value of all cryptocurrency worldwide was $0. As of today, it\'s $1.1 trillion. Bitcoin alone is worth more than $600 billion. That\'s more valuable than any of the tech unicorns founded in the last decade, more valuable than Uber, Airbnb, Stripe, and Slack combined.\n\nA trillion here, a trillion there, soon you\'re talking real money!\n\nSo in retrospect, Bitcoin was the most economically important technological innovation of the 2010s, like the internet was to the 90s. And like all great innovations, it\'s led to the creation of remarkably valuable companies (like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken) and technologies (like Ethereum and Zcash). But people still don\'t get how large the space is. Let\'s give some more numbers.\n\nEthereum, the number two cryptocurrency, is worth &gt;$100B. It extends the concepts introduced in Bitcoin to permit so-called smart contracts, which allow engineers to write programs that can send and receive money.\n\nEthereum has given birth to an entire sector called decentralized finance ("defi") which is to traditional finance ("tradfi") what the internet was to paper-based media. Almost $30B in assets are now held in defi for the purpose of earning interest, taking out loans, or trading assets.\n\nThe Ethereum and Bitcoin networks were used to send &gt;$1T in volume in 2020, more than PayPal.\n\nSo-called "stablecoins" built on Ethereum have allowed the transfer of stable US dollar equivalents to anyone in the world; they too transact billions of dollars in volume every 24 hours.\n\nThe website [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/) has a higher Alexa ranking (#324 at last check) than the website [wsj.com](https://wsj.com/) (last ranked as #440). In other words, a crypto website that lists the price of cryptocurrencies is more popular than the Wall Street Journal\'s official website! And that flip first occurred in 2017.\n\nThe research paper describing Bitcoin has been cited at least 13,000 times by professors at places like Stanford, Harvard, and MIT, and cryptocurrencies have stimulated innovations in applied cryptography and distributed computing.\n\nMore than five billion dollars in venture capital has been invested in cryptocurrency and blockchain startups by the world\'s top tech investors, including Marc Andreessen\'s Andreessen Horowitz, Peter Thiel\'s Founders Fund, and Fred Wilson\'s Union Square Ventures.\n\nAnnual crypto transaction volumes are now in excess of $1T.\n\nThousands, millions, billions, trillions – the numbers start to stun after a while. So here\'s some qualitative commentary from prominent people and institutions to supplement the quantitative barrage.\n\nElon Musk: The world\'s richest man has said that Bitcoin is "inevitable" and changed his Twitter bio to simply "#Bitcoin".\n\nThe IMF: Cryptocurrency could "completely change the way we sell, buy, save, invest, and pay our bills" and "could be the next step in the evolution of money."\n\nThe World Bank: "Cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols are\n\npart of a tidal wave of new technologies that is changing the way production and commerce are organized."\n\nLarry Summers, Former US Treasury Secretary: "Bitcoin is here to stay" and the "financial industry will adopt the technology underpinning bitcoin."\n\nAt this point you should realize that this crypto thing is kind of a big deal. And that there\'s an enormous gap between the economic impact of crypto versus its portrayal in the popular press, and that it might seem a little hasty to cut India off from an emerging trillion dollar industry.\n\nBut it\'s actually even more important than that. Because crypto isn\'t just an economic sector, it\'s a civilizational advance on par with the internet, and – if embraced rather than banned – can actually solve many of the issues facing modern India. Starting with national security.\n\n**2. National Security: Crypto means India can’t be deplatformed**\n\nAs noted above, a recent bill introduced in the Indian parliament proposes a ban of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in favor of a digital rupee. One of the likely justifications is to protect India\'s national security. But as we\'ll see, Bitcoin and allied decentralized technologies are actually essential to India\'s national security.\n\nBitcoin prevents financial deplatforming\n\nFirst, some definitions. A digital rupee would be a centralized currency controlled by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), while Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralized international cryptocurrencies that no single actor has control over. The administrators of the digital rupee at RBI would be able to issue wallets, freeze accounts, and reverse transactions. But Bitcoin is more akin to digital gold, and cannot be frozen or seized by any state.\n\nIt is this property that makes Bitcoin so precious for safeguarding Indian national security. A network that cannot be shut down by any state is a network that India and its diaspora can rely upon in times of conflict. For the same reason that Germany recently repatriated 3,378 tons of gold from the United States, India should prioritize national support for digital gold as a financial rail of last resort in a situation like the 2008 financial crisis or the 2020 COVID crash.\n\nEthereum prevents social deplatforming\n\nSimilarly, for the same reason that Mexico, Germany, and France expressed concern over the deplatforming of a sitting US president and his followers by a collection of American tech companies, India should prioritize national support for decentralized platforms like Ethereum to create social networks and messaging apps that US corporations can’t shut down. Part of the solution will also be national replacements for Twitter, but non-Indians won\'t be on Indian Twitter, and India will still need to get messages out to the world on neutral international platforms. That\'s what crypto permits.\n\nNote that the risk of political deplatforming is not theoretical. Once you’ve banned the “most powerful man in the world”, it’s no big deal to ban anyone else. Every day brings another headline to this effect. Recall too that millions of Indians are currently dependent on American apps like Twitter, WhatsApp, Facebook, Gmail, PayPal, and Google Pay. Given sufficient negative press, American technology companies may ban the Indian Prime Minister or Indian citizens not just from entering the US, but from much of the internet itself. And not just from communicating over the internet, but from sending and receiving payments over US-controlled platforms like SWIFT, PayPal, or Google Pay.\n\nWhat could catalyze such an event? Well, America is excitable these days. A fake photo of a Brazilian rainforest fire was published in the New York Times and prompted a writer in the Atlantic to call for the invasion of Brazil. Cooler heads prevailed once the photo was revealed to be fake, but next time it\'s India that may be the target of official misinformation. And digital hostilities may commence with little warning.\n\nIn short, the threat of Chinese espionage against India is obvious and has already been acted upon with the TikTok ban, but the threat that arbitrary deplatforming by US corporations poses to India\'s national sovereignty is in some respects even greater. Crypto fixes this, as decentralization defeats deplatforming.\n\n**3. Foreign Investment: Crypto brings capital to India**\n\nA second concern often voiced as a rationale for the proposed crypto ban is that cryptocurrency will cause capital flight. But the opposite is true.\n\nAfter all, what do Elon Musk, Marc Andreessen, Jack Dorsey, Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman, Naval Ravikant, Chamath Palihapitiya, and countless CEOs, founders, angels, and venture capitalists have in common? They all support Bitcoin. So do Russian and Chinese ancestry entrepreneurs like Pavel Durov and Changpeng Zhao. The value of Bitcoin is something leaders in the global tech community agree on, like the internet or open source.\n\nEstimates vary, but if and when Bitcoin hits $200,000 per BTC, my colleague Olaf Carson-Wee at Polychain Capital estimated that roughly 25-50% of the world\'s billionaires will come from cryptocurrency.\n\nAs such, if India bans cryptocurrency, it doesn\'t just criminalize the holdings of countless innocent Indians. It repels a trillion dollars in crypto capital from coming to India in the first place. The proposed crypto ban would itself cause capital flight.\n\nAnd capitalist flight. Lest we forget, Indian entrepreneurs are highly mobile. Major crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken are already worth many billions of dollars; so are cryptocurrency mining companies and new digital currencies like Ethereum. All the Indian analogs to those services would happen overseas, as Indian founders are once again forced to move abroad.\n\nConversely, the right crypto policy would cause not capital flight, but capital landing. Visualize billions of dollars in cryptocurrency landing in India. And note that far-sighted technology capitals and financial centers like Switzerland and Singapore have taken positions that are highly favorable to cryptocurrency, because they want the world\'s top entrepreneurs and investors to alight in their country.\n\n**4. Remittances &amp; Remote: Crypto enables the remote economy**\n\nWhile thinking about crypto\'s impact on Indian capital flows, consider the following facts:\n\n* 1.More than 400M Indians have recently come online thanks to Reliance Jio.\n* 2. COVID means many more jobs can now be done over an internet connection.\n* 3. India is already a world leader in business process outsourcing, earning \\~$150B+ per year.\n* 4. India is also the world\'s top recipient of remittances, receiving about $80B annually.\n* 5. Cryptocurrencies work across borders, at the speed of the internet, and are globally popular with tens of millions of users worldwide. Here are some stats from 2019, before the current boom.\n\nIf you put those facts together, India is poised for an absolutely massive boom in remote work and remittances, with crypto serving as the conduit for large flows of money into the country to pay Indians for performing remote work.\n\nNow, as a believer in global free trade, I think this will benefit both sides of the arrangement. But even a mercantilist would find it difficult to argue that a crypto-catalyzed surge in remote work and remittances is not at least in India\'s national interest.\n\n**5. Strengthened Monetary Policy: A digital rupee backed by digital gold**\n\nAnother issue sometimes raised is that decentralized cryptocurrencies may hamper the Indian government\'s monetary policy. Yet the smart use of Bitcoin will actually strengthen India\'s monetary policy.\n\nBegin by noting that monetary policy doesn\'t happen in a vacuum. Why does the Reserve Bank of India hold 600+ tons of physical gold? Because in an economic crisis, the rupee may need to be gold-backed. Well, by analogy, a digital rupee may need to be digital gold-backed.\n\nCentral banks in their own words on why they hold gold reserves: here. Table from here.\n\nIn more detail, every national currency trades against every other currency in a global foreign exchange market. Excessive money printing can devalue a currency. And this is part of the reason why central banks around the world say they continue to hold gold: because it\'s a hedge against inflation, highly liquid, a safe haven in a crisis, and internationally accepted.\n\nThat\'s why India holds 600+ tons of gold, worth tens of billions of dollars. And if it issues a digital rupee, it\'s going to want to acquire digital gold. Because the digital transformation of the economy won\'t just stop halfway. Digitization of national currencies will be accompanied by digitization of precious metal reserve equivalents.\n\nThat means the single highest value thing the RBI and the government could do for India today is not to ban Bitcoin, but to buy Bitcoin. Even a $3B purchase of BTC might appreciate to be on par with India\'s gold reserves given another 10X appreciation in the Bitcoin price. If RBI makes the right decision on Bitcoin in 2021, it could save India many billions of dollars by 2025. This is true even if the RBI doesn\'t want to peg the digital rupee to digital gold right away, but to simply hold BTC as a strategic reserve.\n\nRemember also that India has had a multi-millennia long love affair with gold, and is the world\'s largest importer of gold. Gold was never a threat to India; gold has always been an asset for India. And Bitcoin is valuable for all the same reasons gold is valuable. It’s an internationally accepted store of value, it\'s highly scarce, and it\'s a so-called bearer instrument that can\'t be seized with a keypress. Like gold, it even has industrial utility; for example you can store files undeletably on a blockchain, or use it to prove the existence of a digital file for the purposes of establishing priority. But most importantly, like gold, Bitcoin will soon be the asset that sovereigns use to back or supplement their national digital currencies.\n\nIn short: digital gold is not a threat to India, digital gold is an asset for India, just like gold itself. And digital gold will be a crucial component of India\'s digital monetary policy.\n\n**6. Deterring Financial Fraud: Crypto means mathematically provable accounting**\n\nDeloitte thinks blockchain is a game-changer for accounting as it enables triple-entry bookkeeping.\n\nHere’s a little known fact: the big four accounting firms (PwC, EY, KPMG, and Deloitte) now use Bitcoin and Ethereum as a gold standard of truth when auditing firms that engage in cryptocurrency transactions. See for example PwC\'s Halo, which "interrogates the blockchain to independently and reliably gather corroborating information about blockchain transactions and balances."\n\nThat corroborating information is trustworthy because blockchains, by their nature, use cryptography to create an immutable global record of who paid what money when to whom. So even if a company has a bug in its internal database of Bitcoin transactions, it can reconcile that payment by reference to the entry recorded on the blockchain!\n\nDeloitte and others have called this triple-entry-bookkeeping, a "game-changer" for accounting, a way to "vastly automate accounting processes in compliance with regulatory requirements." It\'s perhaps the most important innovation in accounting since the invention of double-entry bookkeeping…which historians believe led to a little thing like the modern financial system!\n\nThe key concept is that on-chain accounting doesn\'t just make it easy to perform audits, it makes it easy to automate them. There are technologies like proof-of-reserve, for example, that allow firms to continuously certify that they have the needed cash on hand. This would prevent scenarios like the allegations in the Vijay Mallya episode, where false evidence of reserves was allegedly presented to gain access to loans. A blockchain-based loan platform (like MakerDao) would never get fooled by such a trick, because it requires cryptographically provable on-chain collateral.\n\nIf this sounds fancy, don\'t worry. The internet did too, once upon a time. The main takehome point is that blockchains reduce the burden on regulators by allowing them to write programs that certify that financial actors are continuously in compliance with regulations.\n\nBlockchains also allow regulators to replay transactions for so-called market surveillance, to delegate some enforcement to smart contracts, and to even permit on-chain issuance and custody of stock certificates to enable real-time settlement. And as India contemplates permitting technology companies to enter banking, blockchain-based accounting can empower regulators to monitor their activities and conduct risk management.\n\nBy combining IndiaStack and the digital rupee, India could leapfrog the world by mandating on-chain accounting, payment, and stock issuance for all firms by 2030. Putting all financial flows on-chain would reduce corruption, increase trust in the financial system, and attract more foreign direct investment because international investors could be confident in the accounting.\n\nIn short, you can think of this as a regulatory flip. Just like the United States government initially sought to ban encryption in the 1990s, and then turned around to mandate it, so too could smart Indian regulators recognize that blockchains can actually prevent financial crime and increase trust in the system through mathematical, cryptographic proofs of compliance.\n\n**7. Technological Development: Crypto is the financial internet**\n\nCrypto is creating a financial internet. This CBInsights map is just a subset of what\'s happening.\n\nAs Marc Andreessen (creator of the graphical web browser) noted in 2014, the invention of the Bitcoin blockchain is comparable to the advent of the internet itself. Because if the internet was about sending information, blockchains are about transferring value. Specifically, until blockchains, we didn\'t have a digitally native representation of scarcity. Yes, you could copy data from one user to another through the internet, but you couldn\'t prove that the original user no longer had access to that data.\n\nBlockchains solve this problem. The details are technical, but the end result is that you can now provably transfer assets between people over the internet, rather than simply copying data from computer to computer. And this works for virtually any asset. Just like the internet digitized books, movies, newspapers, and music, blockchains enable a financial internet that is digitizing currencies, commodities, stocks, bonds, real estate, and every imaginable variety of financial instrument.\n\nA crypto ban would prevent all of that innovation from happening in India. It would cut India off from this financial internet, just as it\'s hit a trillion dollars in value. It is like banning the internet in the year 2000 or smartphones in 2010.\n\nJust to underscore this point, decentralized finance is a rapidly growing alternative to Wall Street, and Indians would be locked out of the next stock market. Decentralized crowdfunding is a way to raise funding without access to American VCs, and Indian entrepreneurs would be prevented from using it. Bitcoin is displacing gold as a hedge against dollar inflation, and Indian investors would be prevented from adding it to their portfolios.\n\nAnd these are just the applications that are already at scale! Waiting in the wings are concepts like:\n\nUser-generated capital. Right now users on social networks don\'t get paid for the content they generate. But new crypto-based tools allow creators to make money, not just social media corporations.\n\nDecentralized data feeds. Today people pay for feeds of price data from companies like Bloomberg and Reuters. Chainlink and other crypto oracles have developed tools to put this kind of data – among others – on blockchains so it\'s freely visible to the world and accessible to any application.\n\nUser-controlled identity. Ethereum has been used to build an alternative to Facebook Login and Google Login called the Ethereum Name Service, which allows users to control their identity rather than Facebook and Google.\n\nDecentralized stock markets. Engineers have figured out how to put stock prices, stock certificates, and capitalization tables on blockchains, which allow any country to build their own Wall Street.\n\nUser-controlled notifications. Two companies control push notifications to billions of smartphones: Apple and Google. But developers are building decentralized notification systems that are outside of American corporate control.\n\nDecentralized social networks. Twitter and Facebook can deplatform anyone at any time, but blockchain developers are working on platforms controlled by users and communities instead of US companies.\n\nYou don\'t need to understand all these things to understand this: crypto is rapidly decentralizing power away from American corporations, and India has the talent to take advantage of this opportunity. But if Indians can’t even buy Bitcoin and Ethereum, let alone develop new smart contracts and crypto protocols, India will not be internationally competitive in the next generation of technology.\n\nOn the other hand, if India embraces and fully legalizes cryptocurrency, Indian entrepreneurs can build global protocols – not just companies – to fill the role that American technology companies are now abdicating to the world\'s surprise and dismay. The financial return from launching these protocols would come back to India to enrich the country, and the international usage of these protocols would strengthen India\'s reputation on the world stage.\n\n**8. Digital Independence: Crypto is the open source alternative to foreign corporations**\n\nThe Indian government already encourages the use of open source over proprietary code when available:\n\nThe Government of India shall endeavour to adopt Open Source Software in all e-Governance systems implemented by various Government organizations, as a preferred option in comparison to Closed Source Software.\n\nThe government should prefer crypto APIs over corporate APIs for the same reason, because blockchains aren\'t just open source, they\'re also open state and open execution. That means:\n\nOpen source. Every user can view a blockchain\'s source code.\n\nOpen state. Every user has root access to the entire blockchain database.\n\nOpen execution. Every user can replay every action executed by a blockchain.\n\nThis is very different from a centralized service like Twitter. Twitter is closed state, so you can\'t download every tweet. It\'s also closed execution, so you can\'t look at Twitter\'s server to see what it\'s doing in realtime. This means Twitter can ban you from viewing its tweets, or downrank your tweets silently so that you don\'t know if people are seeing them.\n\nBlockchains can fix this. Indeed, they\'ve already fixed it by providing open source alternatives to many financial services. You can use Bitcoin instead of SWIFT, stablecoins instead of PayPal, crypto crowdfunding instead of Kickstarter, and much more.\n\n[Defipulse.com](https://defipulse.com/) has a great list of all the ongoing open source finance action, but the point is simple: India should prefer crypto APIs as the open source alternative to corporate APIs whenever possible, just as it prefers the open source equivalent in other areas.\n\n**9. Foreign Policy: India Should Back Neutral Crypto Platforms**\n\nIndia is the #3 power in the world. It is not America, and it is not China. It should play a different game.\n\nRight now, the US and China are on a financial collision course. The US wants all countries to accept the dollar, while China may push its digital yuan through the Belt and Road. Europe wants to stay out of this developing Cold War, but there isn\'t an obvious alternative yet.\n\nThe Decentralized Movement\n\nIndia can reposition the non-aligned movement as a decentralized movement that advocates crypto protocols as a successor to the rules-based international order, beginning with its own financial system: a digital rupee backed by digital gold.\n\nAs noted in the Diplomat, India has already started to recognize that a renewed non-aligned movement will play a balancing role in the coming US-vs-China Cold War. And cryptocurrencies give an intellectual framework to economically align the otherwise disparate nations of this movement.\n\nUnlike America and China, which will try pressuring nations to accept the dollar or digital yuan respectively, India can recognize that each country will ultimately want to use its own national currency domestically and a neutral platform internationally. Bitcoin and crypto protocols provide that neutral platform, a demilitarized zone suitable for international trade and communication, similar to the role that gold played in the past and that the Law of the Sea plays today.\n\nPut another way, every nation not named America or China has the following preference ranking when it comes to the financial system.\n\nOur country should be in charge (domestic national digital currency)\n\nNo one should be in charge (international cryptocurrency)\n\nOthers should be in charge, like the US or China (dollar or digital yuan)\n\nThis is true for India as well. Unlike the dollar or yuan, the digital rupee is not a candidate to become the reserve currency of the world. Thus, while India can be in charge of the digital rupee domestically, internationally it would prefer that no one be in charge – least of all the increasingly unpredictable US or China. And that equates to a preference for the use of cryptocurrency in international finance. Indeed, every sovereign that isn\'t the US or China will likely eventually align behind crypto for international trade because it\'s an acceptable second choice, a platform where you can\'t be deplatformed.\n\nDigital Internationalism\n\nThis is a creative way of thinking about Indian foreign policy. India would still broadly line up with the West rather than China, but it would stand for the values of the West: free speech, free markets, and international law – all principles that the US has hastily abandoned and that China is in no hurry to pick up.\n\nWe should also remember that India is not a member of the UN Security Council. India is not a root user of the SWIFT system. India doesn\'t have Wall Street or Harvard or Silicon Valley or the New York Times. India really isn\'t that invested in the current system. But unlike the US, which has turned against the rules-based international order, and unlike China, which makes no bones about pursuing its national interest, India could adopt crypto to build new, provably fair digital institutions for billions around the world – a new Wall Street, a new SWIFT, a new Bretton Woods – just as it built IndiaStack for a billion Indians.\n\nThis would be digital internationalism, the pursuit of enlightened self-interest through international decentralized platforms. And it would play to India\'s strengths: software, finance, remittances, and above all the flexible and adaptable nature of the international Indian.\n\nChina could never make this leap, because China thinks about everything in terms of the narrow national self-interest of the Chinese people. That may be fine for them, but it is a turnoff to everyone who is not Chinese.\n\nAmerica likely can\'t make this leap either, at least not right now, because the East Coast establishment now loses in a world of truly free speech and free markets. Wall Street loses to random Reddit users without a thumb on the scale, and legacy media is outcompeted by social media in the absence of censorship. That\'s why the US establishment has soured on the values it once championed.\n\nBut India benefits from a game of free speech and free markets. The millions of Indians who emigrated to the US, UK, Canada, and Australia over the last 50 years did quite well in that game. With 400 million Indians newly online, in a newly remote world, India is poised to become even more formidable as a global exporter of software, finance, and media talent. Neutral crypto platforms will allow India to export these digital goods into every country, while simultaneously being provably fair to all parties. This is the spirit of Atmanirbhar Bharat. Unlike the US or China, India wouldn\'t just be playing to win, it\'d be playing to win/win.\n\n**10. India should buy Bitcoin, build a stockchain, attract crypto, and encourage decentralization**\n\nTo summarize, India is on the verge of banning a trillion dollar industry instead of using it to strengthen its national security, economy, currency, technology, and foreign policy.\n\nBut India\'s crypto ban has been reversed once before, and it\'s possible to envision a bold move here. Under Prime Minister Modi, the country shipped IndiaStack, ascended to #3 on the tech unicorn list, and leapfrogged the world in mobile data with Reliance Jio.\n\nThe next step is to demonstrate global leadership. As the world\'s third largest economy in PPP terms, India could lead a decentralized movement to develop provably fair crypto platforms, neutral international systems outside both American and Chinese control that all countries can embrace.\n\nTo get the ball rolling, Prime Minister Modi should:\n\n* Create a digital rupee backed by digital gold. Shelve the proposed crypto ban and instead buy Bitcoin to back a digital rupee, making it the first national digital currency backed by digital gold. Even if the RBI doesn\'t want to peg the digital rupee to digital gold right away, it\'ll be useful to have BTC reserves as a backstop in a few years time.\n* Add crypto to IndiaStack. Update IndiaStack to add on-chain accounting and a "stockchain", with the goal of putting the country\'s financial system – currency, payments, accounting, stocks, and more – entirely on-chain by 2030. With cryptographically provable financial statements, trust in Indian companies would rise and foreign investment would flow into the country.\n* Attract crypto capital. Using the legislation passed in jurisdictions like Singapore, Switzerland, Wyoming, and Dubai as inspiration, create a crypto-favorable regulatory regime to attract tens of billions in capital to India.\n* Encourage development of decentralized protocols. Encourage Indian entrepreneurs to build not just global companies, but global cryptoprotocols like Ethereum that can be trusted by any country expressly because they don\'t require trust.\n* Help other nations with crypto. Recommend that India build its digital rupee and stockchain with an eye to exporting the designs to the rest of the world, either as services that others can use directly to work with the Indian economy or as blueprints they can fork to build their own versions.\n\nIndia has the talent to pull this off. Such a move would make international headlines, attract global support from the world\'s technologists and financiers, differentiate India from the increasingly zero-sum economic policies pushed by America and China, and put the country at the forefront of a trillion dollar industry.\n\nThe first step is simple: India should buy Bitcoin, not ban it.\n\n\\- by Balaji S.

      <li>Title::: 'into China/PRC bubble'<br />Body: '**Warning**: this post is mostly opinions based, from someone who spend sufficiently long time both inside and outside of China. It is however, maybe the closest "modern Chinese mindset" you can get.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNamaskaar Indian folks, I am Chinese, generally interested in India (mostly politics, economic and military).\n\nI know several Indian Bhai in person, and have seen a lot common misunderstandings from your people towards China/PRC. So after lurking in this community for a long time, I decide to have a friendly conversation with you.\n\nThere was a comment I got from reddit saying that my world view is "from inside of the Chinese bubble". Fine, then I can show you what it is like inside this bubble.\n\nYou may ask me anything about China/PRC. Especially I look forward to those of government, politics and economic. \n\nI can start with a few questions frequently asked by my (Indian) schoolmates in Europe:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think of your government for taking away your freedom and democracy?\n\n\\- It depends on how you define freedom and democracy. By the definition of our government, for our citizens who once suffered hunger and poverty, freedom and democracy to them is sufficient food, clean water, stable power supply, and luxuriously, affordable education. In delivery of those, our government has been doing an excellent job.\n\nAnd yes, speaking of Youtube, Facebook, and Twitter, we don\'t enjoy such freedom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo you like this authoritarian government?\n\n\\- I don\'t recognize all their policy but I understand most and I witness many many great changes they brought to this country. If I have to summarize, our economy size was 1/9 of Japan\'s in 1991, and 3 times larger now.\n\nI think the question "do we need an authoritarian government?" is in the end all about Maslow\'s hierarchy of needs: When you are hungry, all you can dream of is bread and water. As your life improves, you ask for a car, a cozy house, the right to talk freely on Facebook and Twitter. For the case of Chinese citizens, those who struggle or once struggled with bread and water are much much more grateful to this authoritarian government than those who ask for Facebook and Twitter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave you been stealing technology from the US/Soviet Union to succeed?\n\n\\- Let\'s discuss how to steal in a practical manner:\n\nIf you mean getting the blueprint of F-22 or Russian thrust engines, you have to believe that bureaucracy in Washington and Moscow is intelligent enough to prevent this from happening systemically: Take the case of F-22, no Chinese is allowed to be employed by Lockheed Martin, not even Obama and Trump since Obama\'s father and Trump\'s mother were not American citizens.\n\nIf you mean reverse engineering existing products, then the current protocol is, most governments in the world forbid trade with foreign government on valuable national assets. F-22 was never on sell, neither is any advanced Russian/Chinese jets. Even for the weapons for sell, the sold versions are commonly downgraded to prevent potential leakage of top technology. Even you magically have access to all these top notch, reverse engineering is never an easy task: I\'m sure you are currently using CPUs from Intel or Qualcomm, are you capable of replicating one?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think about the Tiananmen Square massacre? \n\n\\- That was a horrible mistake. Killing citizens is simply wrong and for this there is nothing to debate about.\n\nWhile what I don\'t agree was the number of deaths estimated:\n\n* from CCP official, death toll was 241\n* from the west, death toll was 2700 – 3400\n\nI think the number is around 500-2000, yet this is just as dubious as many other estimates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre you a member of CCP?\n\n\\- I\'m not, but both my parents are. In their opinion, I am basically ... a liberal hippie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre you brainwashed (by CCP)?\n\n\\- No and Yes. For "No", I don\'t think any group of evil genius is capable of brainwashing 1.5 billion people. For "Yes", I think I\'m brainwashed as much as many Trump voters and Modi supporters. I believe that we are all brainwashed by the media, more or less.'<br />Author: 'putongren0'  id: 'lfyvr0'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lfyvr0/into_chinaprc_bubble/</li>

It was built upon colonisation &amp; oppression of natives and plundering their natural resources. They had order &amp; prosperity at home because they wrecked havoc/oppressed natives &amp; plundered abroad.\n\nWith regards to America’s rise it is even more appealing. America, literally is a country of tax evading foreigners who came and destroyed native population and brought in slaves from Africa at historical levels to build a nation for 200 years. Americans systematically went about annexing territories of what they called “conquering the frontier” and taking colonies off French and Spanish in the name of “freedom”. All this while maintaining the highest number of slaves in the world!\n\nWhen a civil war broke to secede and create a confederacy, Lincoln didn’t offer to negotiate but went to war. Because he recognised that nation state is supreme and secession is a dangerous game to be allowed to play.\n\nThe Westphalian nation state system was not created in vacuum but in an environment that was unique to Europe at that time, warring mono-ethnic &amp; mono lingual nations that had wealth but not peace and order.\n\nWith the Westphalian system forced on India, it is imperative that Indian state accumulates wealth and power to establish peace and order in the neighbourhood before justice and equity are talked about within the society.\n\nThe Western liberalism and progressivism are trying to impose the laws and norms of "monotheistic mono-ethnic mono-linguistic industrialised 120 persons/sq.km" societies to a "polytheistic multi-ethnic multi linguistic 400 persons/sq.km post colonial, non industrial" society.\n\n**India is not US with curry.** Stop assuming it or trying to make it to be so. Different countries have different journeys to take, insisting on the “one true path” to social empowerment is ignorance at best, or sinister conspiracy at worst.\n\nIn the global liberalism high table virtue signalers sit at the table while often time, honest working societies who have no time for such BS are on the menu along with basket cases like Somalia, Yemen, N Korea, China, Middle East etc.\n\n*When you raise voice more for an entitled Land Rover driving farmer in Punjab than for the persecuted Uyghurs in Xinjiang or Tibetans in TAR, or for womens\' rights in most Islamic countries, your foundation of moral high ground is already 100ft. below the ground.*'<br />Author: 'hFABGjEQJNz1eVS'  id: 'lftf4a'<br />Score:132<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lftf4a/when_you_raise_more_voice_for_an_entitled_land/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'So a question for all who follow Hindu nationalism'<br />Body: 'One question for you guys how do you think extreme right and a Hindu Rashtra will be viable for India. Like it or not India isn\'t a monocultural place. \n\nNow extreme liberalism is bad but like it or not the country was built on basic values on cultural liberalism and tolerance of all religions. Not nationalism in support of one religion. So here\'s a few points, if you can deny them please tell me:-\n\n1. If Hindu Rashtra is formed what makes you think Khalistan demand will not echo among Sikhs. They would definitely demand it. Since they would say:-\n" There is not a single country for Sikhs."\nAlso Sikhs hate RSS.\n\n\n2. The northeast heavily influenced by Jesus views has already seen separatist movements. Most northeasterners have given up the demand since there is no unity among them. And now are ok as Indians. But this majoritaronism would be a unifying factor of a separatist movement.\n\n3. Muslims who were proud as Indians today feel bad as today most of islamophobia is today done by Indians. Many Muslims who claimed proud to be Indians are now plan to leave India. \n\nYet they still get a lot from secular Hindus. This would definitely lead to civil war with Indian Muslims trying to preserve secular India.\n\n4. The Dravidian of South view themselves very different of North. Despite huge dissimilarities in religions, the south is culturally different from north and the Hindus and Muslims there would definitely together try to break Hindu Rashtra. \n\n5. The Indian army is more secular than all of the world. Where people wether Muslims or Hindus are made to drink from same cup just to enable unity. What makes you think a revolt from army won\'t stop a majority ruled nation.\n\nAlso please tell me what makes you think India existed united before. No Kingdom has conquered India uniformly and conquered it culturally. Like how it has been done with China and Japan.\n\nIndia is basically a union of states put together with very difficulty with liberal values. Even America had problems but they didn\'t have diversity as great as India.\n\nThis may sound bad but minorities. Especially Muslims and Sikhs view Yogi Adityanath as death. Same with northeast. \nIf he becomes PM and comes up with love jihad and anti cow slaughter bills also leading to rise in Hindutva mobs then I don\'t think your dream India will exist.

      <li>Title::: 'According to Vedic astrologers, China will attack this month or in March and April. War will last 25 days and South India will be struck too. Tibet and PoK might be liberated.'<br />Body: "This writeup is based on the video [Results of Indo-China war in 2021] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTiIlP9SEV8). It was released in September 2020, when China was anticipating an Indian strike. The astrologer predicted then that war will not take place in October but rather in the Feb-April 2021 period. This is also the time when weather conditions are favourable for military action at Ladakh. Coincidentally, it's also when the tide at the Taiwan strait is conducive to sea-based invasion. 2021 is an important milestone in the CCP's history, and capturing/invading Taiwan has been on the cards for a long time.\n\nI know that not everybody believes in astrology, but this perspective needs to be heard. Also, I am not Sambit (the uploader) and tbh I think his latest comments on the video sound rather unhinged. Anyway, his video is in English and he speaks logically. He spends the first 8 minutes explaining that astrology is not a scam before getting to his predictions.\n\nAccording to astrology and its calculations, based on the timing and location of India and China's respective independence days, the positions of the stars, planets, et cetera, China will attack not in Ladakh but in Arunachal first. Shortly after, missiles will rain down on targets in South India. These can come from long-range missiles and Chinese naval ships but also from hypersonic weapons. Hypersonic weapons in the PLA's arsenal [can reach Bangalore in 20 minutes] (https://nationalinterest.org/feature/five-chinese-weapons-war-india-should-fear-10774). Third, war will begin at Ladakh.\n\nAccording to the astrologer, war will last for 25 days. There will be huge casualties on both sides. Pakistan will also attack and lose Gilgit-Baltistan. There's also a chance of Tibet being liberated.\n\nI will add my own input: China and Pakistan may coordinate terrorist attacks that will happen in a matter of weeks. These may be made to look indigenous. The Delhi riots anniversary is coming up and Pakistan's 'ISIS' plot to kill Indians was busted in January of last year. This year, with or without Pakistani/Chinese assistance, there is a high likelihood of Islamist attacks. Some publications refer to the Delhi incidents as an 'anti-Hindu' riot but the fact remains that most of the victims and burnt houses of worship were Muslim. (I am not denying the crimes and conspiracy of Tahir Hussain and Umar Khalid). So, everyone, please be careful. Save the phone numbers of the police stations near your home and workplace to your contacts so that you can report any suspicious events/persons.

      <li>Title::: 'In 1980s there were up to 80 million white-rumped vultures in India, but today the population numbers only several thousand. It is estimated that the decline of vultures costs India ₹1.7 trillion (US$25 billion) per year.'<br />Body: " \n\n*Processing img 2c0ojfe9gag61...*\n\n&gt;The  Hindu religion, which represents 80% of the country's population,  is  particularly favorable to vultures. Cows are considered sacred by  majority of Hindus, so cow meat is generally not consumed. This results  in the cow's corpse being left to be fed on by vultures.\n\nOf  the estimated 500 million cattle in India, only 4% were destined for  consumption by humans as meat.  Vultures constituted the natural animal  disposal system, processing carcasses .\n\nDiclofenac  is a common anti-inflammatory drug administered to livestock and is  used to treat the symptoms of inflammation, fevers and/or pain  associated with disease or wounds. It was widely used in India beginning  in the 1990s. The drug is fatal to vultures, however, and a vulture is  exposed to a mortal dose of diclofenac if it eats from the carcass of an  animal that has been treated with diclofenac recently.\n\nIn  early 2014 the Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction (Save) programme  announced that it expects to start releasing captive-bred birds into the  wild by 2016.\n\nTwo captive  Himalayan Griffon vultures were released in June, 2016 from Jatayu  Conservation Breeding Centre, Pinjore as part of Asia's first vulture  re-introduction program.\n\nConsequences\n\nThe  sudden collapse of the natural animal disposal system in India has had  multiple consequences. The carcasses formerly eaten by vultures rot in  village fields leading to contaminated drinking water. The disappearance  of vultures has allowed other species such as rat and wild dog  populations to grow. These newly abundant scavengers are not as  efficient as vultures. A vulture’s metabolism is a true “dead-end” for  pathogens, but dogs and rats become carriers of the pathogens. India has  an estimated 18 million wild dogs, the largest population of carnivores  in the world, which has led to increase in leopards invading inhabited  areas preying on feral dogs leading to conflicts with humans.\n\n \n\n&gt;According  to Parsi beliefs, Earth, Fire, and Water are sacred elements, and both  cremation and burial are sacrilegious. For the deceased Parsi to reach  heaven, vultures serve as intermediaries between earth and sky. The dead  body is placed on a Tower of Silence where vultures, by consuming the  body, liberate the soul.\n\nDue  to the decline in vulture population, Parsis have been obliged to drop  these ancient customs for reasons of hygiene, since now bodies take six  months to disappear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Interesting read here:***\n\n[***https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian\\_vulture***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_vulture)\n\n[***https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian\\_vulture\\_crisis***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_vulture_crisis)"<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'lfgtez'<br />Score:35<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lfgtez/in_1980s_there_were_up_to_80_million_whiterumped/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Understanding the Khalistan movement and the role of Indira Gandhi led Congress in creating this monster.'<br />Body: 'I\'ve noticed off late that this has become a hot topic of discussion yet people at large remain unaware of the details concerning this. A lot of people in the aftermath of events of 26 Jan \'21 wished Indira was alive today, that\'s a grave misunderstanding of what actually happened in Punjab from 1980-84 that lead to the Op. Blue Star.\n\nAs you can tell from my post history, I\'m a Punjabi Hindu so I shall put that up as a disclaimer for all to adjust for my biases that I may let on subconsciously. I will, however, try to keep this objective and reference two of the best books on this topic - "Amritsar, Mrs Gandhi\'s Last Battle" by Mark Tully and Satish Jacob of the BBC and a recent one "The Khalistan Conspiracy" by the much decorated foremer R&amp;AW agent GBS Sidhu (yes, a Sikh). I will make this post in the form of questions and answers.\n\n**Who was to blame for the rise of extremism and atrocities in Punjab leading to Op. Blue Star?**\n\nThe biggest question, I\'ll get to this right off the bat. A lot of people suspect that Khalistan sentiment was brewing in Sikhs abroad and they started influencing domestic politics. Most of the people think Bhindranwale was the mastermind - but that is NOT the case. As is well documented and mentioned in both the books, Sanjay Gandhi along with Giani Zail Singh and other leaders (Kamal Nath, Fotedar etc) wanted to destabilize the Akali Govt in Punjab by creating a political faction that appealed to the extremist element. That would put the SAD (Henceforth used for Akali Dal) in a bind, do they appease the new faction and lose their Hindu coalition partner or remain moderate and lose the extremist faction? GBS Sidhu also suggests that they might have created this so as to have an issue Indira Gandhi solved for the Indian public at large in order to win 1985 elections but we\'ll let this be speculative (GBS quotes his source in the book at Pg. 5, 6). What is documented, however, is that Sanjat Gandhi with the help of Giani Zail Singh fucking interviewed candidates for this role. The wanted a "sant" to appeal to the more devout section of society. They selected Bhindranwale as he had the ideal traits. (Kamal Nath recalled this in Kuldip Nayar\'s autobiography) To paraphrase Kamal Nath, "The first one we interviewed did not look a courageous type. Bhindranwale strong in tone and tenor, seemed to fit the bill. We would give him money off and on.." (Pg. 34, 35 of GBS\')\n\nHis first task was to mount an opposition to the heretic sect of Nirankaris who were allowed to hold a convention in Amritsar. It lead to clashes and Congress in Punjab gave credit to Bhindranwale for defending Sikh beliefs against the threats to it. \n\nGBS Sidhu also attributes the "dar ka mahaul" to Congress, for creating a perception among Hindus and Sikhs that the divide is real and as are the pro-Khalistan feelings among Sikhs, but I digress. \n\nBhindranwale campaigned for 3 of Congress\' Lok Sabha candidates for 1980 general elections. Their campaign posters would go with the tagline of "Bhindranwale supports me". \n\nLala Jagat Narain was the owner of newspaper "Punjab Kesari" which was quite critical of the rise of Bhindranwale and Congress. My father tells me Punjab Kesari also used to publish a list of names of Hindus killed in Punjab every day. Safe to say, Bhindranwale camp had a beef with him and he was killed. On the day he was killed, JSB (Henceforth used for Bhindranwale) was in Chando Kalan in Hisar, Haryana. He was named in the FIR filed after the murder. Then the govt in the state was Congress under Darbara Singh (a great man) and he sent Punjab Police after him, but he managed to escape. Satish Jacob of the BBC claims that a senior police officer told him that Haryana CM went as far as to send an official car to Chandon Kalan to drive Bhindranwale back to his gurudwara. Haryana CM then was Bhajan Lal, always looking to appease Indira Gandhi after 1980 as he had opposed her earlier during emergency. GBS Sidhu writes that his batchmate who was DIG at BSF HQ told him that their force tried to stop JSB at their check posts but he received instructions from the home minister\'s office to let him pass. (Home minister at the time was Giani Zail Singh.)\n\nDal Khalsa was created to appease to the extremist viewpoint of a very, very small minority but an impression was created that this was Bhindranwale\'s party as they claimed him to be their leader though he never explicitly associated himself with them. The bill of their meetings in hotels in chandigarh was taken care of Giani Zail Singh (mentioned in both the books). Congress leaders were also known to pay for the group\'s activities. \n\nTo make him look like a genuine threat to India/hindus, despite a ban on possession of arms in punjab at the time, Bhindranwale was allowed to be accompanied by two busloads of his followers brandishing arms openly to Delhi, on the invitation of DSGMC pres Santokh Singh. The police had even cardoned off CP and it was sure everyone caught a glimpse of this scene so as to create a fear among the Hindus/Indians about Khalistan/JSB.\n\n______________________________\n\nNow I\'d like to ask people here, do you really wish Indira was alive and handling this situation? She created the problem in the first place!\n\n**Do Sikhs really want Khalistan? What about those living abroad?**\n\nThis I will heavily base on my personal experience and that of the previous generations in my family. But to make it more objective, I will also refer to relevant sources. Did Sikhs at large long for a spearate country? No. Did they want more of a control over a place they\'d like to call their homeland? Yes. At the time, most of the Sikh community would\'ve liked more of an autonomy for the Punjab state from the Central govt and that was often the demand of the Akali Dal at the time. But the thing they wanted most was recognition, as a separate religion, an identity of their own. Did the popular opinion change at any time? At no point in 70s and 80s did the Sikh community at large move for a separate state. Even Bhindranwale himself never openly asked for Khalistan, his response always was "We won\'t refuse it if it was given to us". You can easily google and check the list of demands by the Akali Dal at the time of their Dharam Yudh Morcha.\n\nWell, what about those abroad? In this aspect, GBS SIdhu\'s book has been a revelation. He was posted to the Indian mission in Ottawa during 1977 and 1979. Over that time he built a network of contacts within the community to see the mood. Ghadar movement during the independence struggle had begun in Punjab and he noted that Sikhs on the West coast mostly felt proud of their Indian heritage and contribution to Indian freedom struggle. Those in other parts of Canada mostly seemed to focus on betterment of their individual lives rather than the politics of Punjab/India. He only met two self professed khalistan sympathisers at the time, one was self styled consul general of Khalistan (the organisation led by Jagjit Singh Chohan) and another was an ideologue professor, but their views did not gain any significant traction. He noticed a change after the politics of 1980 as more and more people showed concern about what was happening in Punjab. The Hindu and Sikh community used to gather weekly at Gurudwaras but that was slowly stopping as some of the Gurudwaras were starting to say radical things. A lot of the staff in Canadian Gurudwaras was sent by SGPC in India and they brought their orthodox views along. The polarisation and rise of extremist views happened parallel to the events in India from 1980 to 1984. A lot of Sikhs even used the reason of "political persecution" to emigrate to Canada and then had to carry on with this sentiment. But did it all begin there? All the evidence suggests otherwise.\n\nOf course the situation is different there now, along with the US and Aus. GBS also mentions how some ideologues were actually hired by the US Govt in the cold war era as India was seen as the Soviety ally. \n\n**What lead to Operation Blue Star?**\n\nThings get more sinister here. After the creation of an extremist faction and then Akalis losing state elections, Akalis had to come up with something. They started the Morcha with a long list of Religious and Political demands. Major issues were of course Chandigarh and distribution of water of Punjab\'s rivers. Akalis started playing a dangerous game and as did those at the Center. There were 26 (!) rounds of negotiations held, several times an agreement was reached only for the center to back out the night before or even at the day of announcement of an agreement. GBS Sidhu\'s hypothesis is that negotiations were designed to fail as the Central Govt/Congress/Indira Gandhi wanted to be seen as doing something about Punjab while also not actually letting Akalis take any credit for solving the conundrum. If they agreed, all of it would be settled and there would be nothing for the Congress to take credit of. Heck, the Operation Blue Star was decided to be carried out on 26th May, \'84 yet the Central Govt held a round of negotiations on 29th May, despite knowing the outcome. Even a truce with JSB was reached courtesy of negotiations by Sardar Swaran Singh, yet the Congress govt at the center decided to make the situation worse at every possible juncture. The Akali Dal was playing a dangerous game, they were wary of JSB taking control of the narrative of their movement and even once decided to end the Morcha unconditionally in the public interest but the Center offered them the lollipop of yet another agreement that might see them get the credit.\n\nAs all of this was happening, two close associates of JSB were released from Jail in 1983 and suddenly the anti-Hindu sloganeering started. So far they\'d only targeted the perceived enemies of JSB regardless of religion but now the militants started targeting Hindus out in the public. There would be mass shootings in public areas (I lost a relative in that, yes, me /u/kashmokash), hindus filtered in busses and killed, so on. Yet the authorities wouldn\'t let the state govt act, Darbara Singh\'s govt was dissolved and president\'s rule was established so everything was in Giani Zail Singh\'s hands! Hah! \n\nAs things were heating up,  JSB was stationed in the guest house of the Golden Temple. Then Chief Minister Darbara Singh had offered Indira Gandhi half a dozen times to take out JSB. Darbara Singh was a secular of the old school and did not like the communal division and all the politics surrounding this. He argued that the guest house is separated from the Gurudwara complex by a road and is therefore not a part of it. It would not be sacrilegious for the police or army to take an action in it. Yet the Central govt said they did not want to be seen as offending religious sentiments of the Sikhs (hah!). \n\nGBS Sidhu even speculates (Pg. 114) (with his intelligence sources, of course)that Pawan Kumar Sharma of the Hindu Suraksha Samiti was also close to Capt. Amrinder Singh and other Congress buddies - he was used to spread the propaganda of hate among hindus, dividing the two communities who had always coexisted peacefully. \n\nThings were deliberately lead to deteriorate until less than a year before 1985 general elections so that Indira Gandhi can be seen to be taking strict action against the "anti-National" forces. Even then, 2 months before Op. Blue Star, a proposal for another operation was made. One where casualties would\'ve been a fraction of the total on the both sides yet it was discarded by Indira Gandhi. GBS Sidhu suggests that Operation Blue Star by design seems to have been conducted to exacerbate the actual situation and cause higher damage to both the army and the temple complex/akal takht. You can read more details in his book, of course. He also gave a lengthy interview about this which is easily available on YouTube.\n\nAnother thing to mention is that a few months prior to June, 1984, large amounts of ammunition was allowed to be carried into the temple complex. It was even once caught during regular police checks but nothing was done about it. Everybody and their mother knew how Major Gen Shahbeg Singh was fortifying the complex and training the militants yet it was casually allowed to happen. What for? It almost seems like power that be wanted maximum resistence in order to justify their own future actions.\n\n**Aftermath of 1984, and the very unfortunate anti-Sikh pogram in Delhi**\n\nThis is not something I\'d like to say much about it. What happened was very unfortunate, innocents who had absolutely nothing to do with this were killed while the powers that be had orchestrated the whole show. Even in this, there are some suspects. Despite Rajiv Gandhi handing home ministery to Narsimha Rao, he was told to hand over the police control to PMO (Fotedar), as if the police was supposed to hold back. Goons close to Gandhi family were seen to be carrying VOTER LISTS of Sikhs with names and address in order to identify Sikh Households. GBS Sidhu says he was even warned by his then boss that if anything were to happen to Indira Gandhi, something like this could happen. There were many lapses as well which lead to all of this. R.N.Kao, who was responsible for Indira Gandhi\'s safety had strictly ordered not posting two sikh constables together in her safety detail. Even GBS SIdhu had told his boss that he thinks the Sikh constabulary should be pulled off of her security detail as it\'s the easiest way to get her assassinated. Yet, at the time, both of the constables were allowed to be posted close to her, in her inner security detail. This goes too much into the tin-foil-hat area so I\'ll hold off on saying anything further, but all of the above are facts with credible sources. \n____\n\nFurther observations: I have noticed some trends among Sikhs abroad now. A friend passed to me a letter by Babbar Khalsa in Australia. They don\'t blame Congress or Indira Gandhi for the events of 1984, they blame the Indian Government. They never call it "bharat sarkar" but "Hindustani hukumat". It seems like there\'s been a concerted effort since to whitewash the role of Congress in all this, for it to stay the favourable party in the eyes of Sikhs still - and it indeed remains one. They do prefer it to BJP - the latter who has only ever spoken in favour of the Sikh community (not to be confused with protesting farmers, who are a small part of it).'<br />Author: 'kashmokash'  id: 'lcgakf'<br />Score:81<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lcgakf/understanding_the_khalistan_movement_and_the_role/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Twitter Is Now Waging Active War Against India. "We will not act against riot instigators, we will not act against false news inciting hate &amp; riots. We will not obey the laws of the land. What can you do?"'<br />Body: 'The bias for Left wing and promoting Left wing violence by Twitter is nothing new. Non-left accounts get suspended for asking police action on rioters, sometimes they get suspended simply for pointing out historical facts. Like TrueIndology. \n\nAnd while Twitter supposedly "stands against" fake news and even began new BirdWatch program for that purpose, in spite of multiple videos and videographed autopsy of the rioter who died as he crashed his tractor into barricades, Twitter continued to allow Congress workers like Shashi Tharoor, Caravan and Wire to announce their lies about the Australian being shot by Indian police with complete freedom &amp; protection at the virtual townsquares. \n\nNot just this, 2 days after after India witnessed much bloodier riots than the Capitol riots on Republic Day (for spurring which Parler was dissolved by the global Tech gods citing humanitarian supremacy), Twitter trended much more inciteful false statements "Modi Genociding Indian Farmers".\n\n&gt;On Monday evening, government sources told The Indian Express that they had not changed their order in the meeting with Twitter. “Yes, Twitter tried to push back against the order, but we have not changed anything. You can’t write that the PM is carrying out a genocide on farmers and get away with it. Twitter needs to implement this. \n\nWhen the government obviously asked them to suspend these accounts, after "witholding" them for a day, Twitter activated them again following instructions from their headquarter, obviously throwing the gauntlet for the Indian government. Their statement is loud &amp; clear: "We are the owners of the key to the global propaganda empire, we are not obligated to follow either the laws of the land, nor are we obligated to take down incendiary false news promoting violence &amp; riots. We are the masters of the propaganda machine, we own the newsreporters and the "activists". What can you do? If we continue to promote riots in India, What can you do?"\n\nGovernment sent a notice again pointing out that failure to act against those false rumours will make twitter officials liable to fines and prison time. And as expected, Twitter propaganda machinery jumps into action against fascism.\n\nCasey Newton Atlanta based journalist: "India is threatening put Twitter employees in jail for *seven years* just for letting journalists tweet about protests."\n\nhttps://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1357135191920152578\n\nNotice how they left out tweeting "false incidenary news  inciting riots a week after riots". But it doesn\'t matter, this is how propaganda works after all.\n\nJoins in Twitter spokesperson Brandon: India is fascist for trying to fine twitter for not acting against false propaganda.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/bborrman/status/1357150132404244483\n\nMeanwhile Jack promotes campaign against Indian government:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/lby8mp/after_refusing_to_suspend_riotmongering_accounts/\n\nSimultanously, Twitter begins retrending Modigenocidingfarmers agains, the same hashtag for which government sent notice to Twitter. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/BefittingFacts/status/1357240492635811841\n\nAnd Congress is once again spreading false news inciting the Sikhs:\n\n&gt;We\'ve come to know that a farmer Navneet ji who came from Canada &amp; was participating in protest peacefully, was shot at by Police &amp; lost his life, during tractor rally. Priyanka Gandhi ji will meet his family at his residence in Rampur today: UP Congress president Ajay Kr Lallu\n\n\nTwitter is begging, PLEADING, to the state of the India to take an action. It is gleefully threatening, "What can you do? Either way we win. If govt does nothing, we keep spreading false news &amp; incite riots. If govt stops them, we cry fascism &amp; censoring &amp; again incite riots."\n\nObviously the government needs to act, but acting won\'t ne easy. But the easiest thing the government can do right now if GET OFF TWITTER. Move all prominent BJP leaders starting from Modi &amp; Amit Shah away from Twitter and keep only spokespersons. Modiji for the love of God, get OFF Twitter.\n\nhttps://swarajyamag.com/ideas/bringing-twitter-to-heel-will-require-prime-minister-and-his-party-to-quit-the-platform'<br />Author: 'nanikichorni'  id: 'lcdwut'<br />Score:54<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lcdwut/twitter_is_now_waging_active_war_against_india_we/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Learning Sanskrit through stories (not studying)'<br />Body: "Hello everyone,\n\nWe'd like to share a project we're working on that may be of interest to anyone curious about Sanskrit.\n\nIn  addition to its religious literature, Sanskrit also contains a vast  collection of stories, poems, plays, and technical literature. But  Sanskrit can be a challenging language to learn. Although this is in  part because it works differently from many modern Indian languages, it  is also because second language education doesn’t always follow the best  practices that we know about from current research.\n\nGenerally  speaking, the recommendations from second language acquisition research  are quite simple: if you keep reading or listening to language that you  understand and enjoy, you will acquire that language with minimal  effort.\n\nThe problem is that for  ancient languages, there is not enough material that we can both  understand and enjoy. What we might enjoy (such as original texts) is  usually too hard to understand; and what we might understand (such as  textbook sentences) is usually not that enjoyable.\n\nTo solve this problem for Sanskrit, we have created [Amarahāsa](https://en.amarahasa.com/),  a free online library of Sanskrit books designed especially for  learners and built according to the current best practices in second  language acquisition research. All of our books have word-for-word  translations to improve comprehension, and our simpler books also have  illustrations and sentence-for-sentence translations so that the  language used is always clear.\n\nWe  have designed our project as a library because we believe that language  learners should decide for themselves what they want to read. So while  we have books about the Ramayana and the Bhagavad Gita, we also have  books about the Buddha, simple Panchatantra stories, and a few other  works as well. Although we have a long way to go, we hope our library’s  scope will someday match the diversity of Sanskrit literature itself.\n\nOur  library is still young and still a work in progress, and we ask for  your patience as it goes through its growing pains. Thank you for your  interest, and please let us know if you have any comments or requests.  We'll do our best to reply."<br />Author: 'amarahasa'  id: 'lc6hbz'<br />Score:47<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lc6hbz/learning_sanskrit_through_stories_not_studying/</li>

Can someone influential who has already started a petition in the past start this one as well?\n\nHere's the petition draft. (Also, suggestion/updates are warmly welcomed in the comments)Also, let's not create multiple petitions for the same but instead support a single petition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Petition Title\n\nWe support the Government of India and IndiaStandsTogether against anti-India elements\n\n# Who has the power to make this change?\n\nGovernment of India\n\n# The Problem we want to Solve\n\nOn February 4 2021, few influential figures on Twitter like [Rihanna](https://twitter.com/rihanna/status/1356625889602199552), [Greta Thunberg](https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1356694884615340037) and few others tweeted some similar tweets about the ongoing Farmer Protest in India. These tweets gained popularity really quickly and were a topic of discussion all over the world\n\nAdditionally, Greta Thunberg tweeted another tweet with a toolkit document which was a well-planned itinerary that had all information about planned TwitterStorm, On-Ground Protests, Social Media Campaign, Signing of Petitions and divesting Indian Business with exactly planned timestamps occurring in the month of January and February 2021.\n\nThis tweet was later deleted by Greta but the toolkit document shared by her has been archived and is [available here](https://archive.is/9oF4n). She later [tweeted another toolkit document](https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/view/ehTz+drfKPwi4fP5dn0mivwVCKhwNe7OD1YHDiBUj0Y/) after removing all anti-India planned illustration and information and removed the names of those involved in this plan.\n\nIn order to fight against this social media war started by anti-India elements overseas, Government of India shared facts and asked these influential figures and others to ascertain their facts and have a proper understanding of the issue before commenting on it. MEAIndia shared a tweet corresponding to the same with a Twitter [\\#IndiaTogether](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IndiaTogether) and [\\#IndiaAgainstPropaganda](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IndiaAgainstPropaganda). On the support of this, many Indian influential celebrities like [Sachin Tendulkar](https://twitter.com/sachin_rt/status/1356959311075934215),  [Akshay Kumar](https://twitter.com/akshaykumar/status/1356884526815842304?s=20), [Lata Mangeshkar](https://twitter.com/mangeshkarlata/status/1357006983480700928), [Virat Kohli](https://twitter.com/imVkohli/status/1357016154108166144) and many more also tweeted about this and asked Indians to stay united and repel these anti-India elements.\n\nThis petition is to let the Government of India know that we, **the citizens of India**, are all are now aware of their plan and will repel all the adversaries that are being plotted against Republic of India and Indians internationally.\n\nWe, **the citizens of the Republic of India**, would also like to thanks Indian News Media, Social Media and other Information Media outlets for thwarting this ill-devised plan and sharing this news with facts to every common citizen of India.\n\n# Photo\n\n[https://twitter.com/MEAIndia/status/1356853835361259520](https://twitter.com/MEAIndia/status/1356853835361259520)"<br />Author: 'pkludakgaya'  id: 'lby0hy'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lby0hy/help_can_someone_start_a_petition_on_changeorg_to/</li>

For the past 1 year, I have been reading on how Congress used to govern and how BJP is now governing the country. Clearly, BJP has been proactive in introducing reforms and have passed many laws, though some reforms like Demo has arguably backfired. BJP has been much better in handling the finances as well as compared to Congress. But a subdued GDP growth % is still a worrying factor for the past few years which I am sure will be taken care of with the way govt is handling the economy and infrastructure.\n\nOverall, I feel BJP and Modi is the best thing to happen for the country. But, I still hate right wingers for their ultra-nationalism and the way they cry about muslims and indulge in bigotry (there should be a better way to counter islamic extremism). I also hate how right-wingers blindly love capitalism. I feel the work-culture in India needs to be improved if we really are aiming to be a capitalist country else capitalism just becomes a tool for the cronies to exploit the nation's resources and labour.\n\nOn the other hand, Leftist liberals in the current scenario have become pathetic. The current farmer protests has only proved that the left wing is out of their minds and would blabber anything to go against Modi. They shouldn't be taken seriously anymore.\n\nI never voted BJP thinking that Congress has far better experienced and educated ministers and that BJP is destroying the social fabric of the country.

      <li>Title::: 'The not so useful nitpicking of the budget by the media'<br />Body: " This budget has been one of the best budgets in quite some time. The markets went up by close to 5% when the budget was announced and the markets have a way seeing through BS like no one else. However, certain sections of media kept nitpicking on the budget. Their predominant rant was about a reduction in allocation to certain schemes. These same media outlets however made no effort to highlight how various parts of the budget would give long term boost to the GDP and eventually lead to top down economic growth.\n\nThe biggest paradox of India is that most people who  don't believe on top down economic growth are themselves recipients of  the same. I bet most middle class people work in the service sector  where they joined at a salary of some 3.6 lpa some decade back or so.  Then as the IT/software/finance firm they worked in grew without much  government intervention, their salaries also kept getting a bump. From  3.6 to 5 to 8 to 12 and so on and so forth. With the usual bump in  salaries, their lifestyle also improved.\n\nHowever,  the same people are not willing to believe the same can happen in  manufacturing and eventually to the bottom 400-500 million. Even though  China is a living proof that this actually works and uplifts an entire  country from poverty. Quite fascinating tbh.\xa0\n\nSecondly,  the incompetence of Indian government in provision of goods and  services is quite something. It truly is absolutely remarkable. The  government is so inept and incompetent in delivery of services and goods  that whichever private company operates in fields supposed to be basic  services and amenities has flourished like never before. HDFC bank ranks  among some of the best stocks in India and has made so much money that  The Economist ranked it among the top 10 wealth generating banks. How is  it that in a country where banks were nationalized long back, a private  bank managed to make so much money? Apollo Hospitals has grown from a  meagre 12Rs at inception to 2.7k today. How is that a private hopsital  makes so much money in a sector that's considered a basic amenity?  Private schools like DPS and DAV have expanded like never before. Most  public schools have close to zero actual motivation among teachers.  There are reports of parents skipping meals to ensure that their kids  study in a private school. Despite such blatant incompetence and  ineptness on part of the government, repeated calls by certain news  organizations to fund more schemes and subsidies is mind boggling to say  the least.\n\nThird, I find  quite fascinating how media companies report on budget cuts to schemes  with such alarcity. It is as though, you guys have a full time editor  with a MacBook Pro and excel and who's only job is to compare if there's  been a budget cut to XYZ scheme or not. This exercise would have been a  fruitful endeavour if money allocated to schemes year after year  actually reached the poor. But as I said, the state's incompetence in  delivery of goods and services means that a lot of money allocated to  various schemes is simply lost to corruption. One way to reduce said  corruption is for media companies to do more on ground reporting and  expose the various leakages in government schemes and government  instituitons. But the media these days seems more content to sit on an  ivory tower and throw rockets of opinions at anyone and everyone who'll  listen. On ground reporting is close to dead. If the media reported more  vigilantly from the ground and held government officers and  institutions more accountable then we would see a lot better outcomes  even during a budget cut because pass through of budget allocations to  schemes would improve. But as I said, on ground reporting is dead. Much  easier to just highlight fall in expenditure to various schemes than to  actually pursue vigorous on ground reporting which takes quite some  effort."<br />Author: 'lic_n_reg_pls'  id: 'lbkj1t'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lbkj1t/the_not_so_useful_nitpicking_of_the_budget_by_the/</li>

Let’s have a parade of sorts wearing clothes that make the aunties and uncles uncomfortable including guys who want to wear a skirt (Harry Styles for example)  I’m not entirely serious about the parade. But women wearing shorts should be normalised.  I personally would love to wear shorts outside my own apartment.

      <li>Title::: 'India will never be a superpower until some drastic changes are made'<br />Body: 'Around 1/4 to 1/5th of the world\'s population is Indian, and with this you would expect India to have leveraged its population\'s numerical superiority on the road to becoming a superpower. Instead, we see India faltering at every possible turn. How can the situation be fixed?\n\n The secret to India\'s future influential expansion will be its ability to leverage the power of the Indian ethnic diaspora to secure influence abroad and contribute to India\'s economic development. As it is, Indians don\'t regard the diaspora as "real Indians" which is counterproductive and will lead to India\'s failure to rise to superpower status. India has the world\'s largest diaspora, and this is large enough to form a global network of influence, provided that ethnic Indians pool their resources and cooperate. Globally, ethnic Indians should combine their resources in a concerted manner to improve development within India and to contribute in a unified manner to their host countries, all the while cooperating to achieve progress. \n\nThis cooperation must first be directed at a push to eliminate corruption within India, and to change the legal system such that corruption becomes impossible. This can be done through mandatory third party audits. The second push should be to develop India\'s infrastructure in a manner that evenly distributes the population to reduce crowding while developing an efficient series of modern railway networks. \n\nLet\'s face it, India has almost zero ability to project power on a world stage. Indians are viewed as a source of cheap labor for the Gulf dictatorships, Western tech companies, and Western manufacturers. India\'s upper class engages in unchecked predatory corruption allowing it to exploit the rest of India\'s citizenry, and the environment of corruption also fuels a breakdown in the social fabric and a total lack of cohesion. \n\nOn the other hand, China has managed to orchestrate a massive infrastructure buildup and has leveraged its diaspora and population\'s numerical superiority to secure resources for itself and its development. The Chinese Belt and Road initiative is a phenomenal example of soft power projection.'<br />Author: 'thebusiness7'  id: 'lbjeu1'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lbjeu1/india_will_never_be_a_superpower_until_some/</li>

While most of my friends had jobs, I had no work or any income coming in.\n\nTo add to that my mental health took a toll. Initially, I felt frustrated as I asked my self that question of. Why me?\n\nAfter realising I needed to get myself of such thinking I started to research the internet and realised that a lot of us have this feeling of being left behind by life. We tend to compare ourselves to people around us. What I realised is the reason that doesn't make any sense is because without knowing where I finish lines lie how can we say we are behind people. What if the next break changes my life? Since all our journeys are different, so are our finish lines! May be we just have gotten diverted from the 'normal' path and hence feel we will get to our goals later. What if our path has a hidden bridge or shortcut?\n\nThis gave me a whole new perspective to  how I think of things now. I also made a short video on the same. Please do let me know, have similar feels crossed your mind and how do you tackle them.
