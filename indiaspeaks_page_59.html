They admitted that hiring a woman as a brewer was something they would not be comfortable with.\n\nOn one hand it is sad that she couldn’t have the career she had dreamed of but on the other, she founded a pharmaceutical business and is now a billionaire. She is a true example of a woman who would not give up just because a bunch of men were “uncomfortable” around her.

The human race is the most vengeful, vindictive race. We may forget (due to forgetfulness) but we rarely forgive. \n\nThe study says that humans believe that when someone does them some wrong, there may be something good that would come from it in the future. So they forgive. What good will come from a war or a terrorist attack in the future? Some things just cannot be forgiven and should not be forgiven. And I’m not even talking about big things like terror attacks here. Take for example honor killings. That is an act of revenge. It is killing somebody for the most foolish reason that they didn’t listen to you about who to marry. \n\nThe new papers are full of cases about people doing heinous crimes for revenge.

      <li>Title::: 'Where do our kids play?'<br />Body: '  \n\nDuring an interaction with children in Varanasi, Prime Minister Modi had a message for them saying, “you’ll blossom if you play”. Good message, but where do they play? Playing is certainly very important. It gives children exercise and keeps their minds and bodies fit. However, our current education system is such that it lays more emphasis on achieving good marks than on playing. With the tons of homework that children get, precious little time is left for them to play.\n\nWhile many housing societies have small parks for children, they do not get used much as children are busy with homework. The solution to this is compulsory play time in schools. But most schools don’t have their own play grounds to begin with. Almost 4 out of 10 schools in India have no playgrounds. My own school didn’t have one for years (I heard they have recently built one).\n\nNot only will more play parks and playgrounds lead to healthy children and eventually healthy citizens, but also the greenery will go quite a long way towards bringing down pollution and helping the environment.

During the revolt Marathwada saw major uprisings *against the Razakars of Nizam*. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main leaders of the revolt were **Swami Ramanand Tirth, Govindbhai Shroff, Vijayendra Kabra and Ramanbhai Parikh and P H Patwardhan**. The Indian government appeared anxious to avoid what it termed a "Balkanization" of the new country and was determined to integrate Hyderabad into the newly formed Indian Union.

The operation itself took five days, in which the **Razakars were defeated and Hyderabad was annexed.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Marathwada Liberation Day is a local holiday in Maharashtra**.

He went to Arabia, China, Japan, Philippines, Singapore, even Vietnam, but India was out of the list.\n\nIf you have not read the book, Trumps policy is to have trade with East and South-East Asia and use India merely as a guard dog against Pakistan and Afghanistan. In other words India is of no trade significance.\n\nOn another front China has completely surrounded India by befriending Pak, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives and many African nations. \n\nIndia stands completely alone today on trade and defence.

      <li>Title::: "A few days ago, we witnessed the World Hindu Congress, held in Chicago, USA. Why don't we also have a National Hindu Conference, held annually in India?"<br />Body: 'I really liked what I read about the WHC.\n\n&gt;This Congress, second in the series after its inaugural in November 2014, attracted over 2,500 delegates and participants from over 60 countries. It was superbly organised by a team of over 200 volunteers under the able leadership of an organising committee headed by IIT-Kharagpur BTech-turned-sannyasi-activist, Swami Vigyananand, ably aided by Sriprakash Kothari, Raju Reddy, Abhaya Asthana, and Sham Seth.\n\n&gt;A star-studded galaxy of speakers addressed the gathering, including vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu, who delivered an inspiring valedictory, and thespian Anupum Kher, who offered a moving inaugural keynote. The theme of WHC 2018 was Yudhishthira’s advice to Bhima in the Mahabharata (3.37.5), “Sumantrite Suvikrante” (Think collectively, accomplish valiantly).\n\n&gt;It is important to understand that the WHC is not a political caucus, but a global congregation of Hindus “to connect, share ideas, inspire one another, and impact the common good”. Held once in four years, WHC’s guiding vision is the quotation from the Bhagavad Gita: “Yato Dharmastato Jaya” (Where there is dharma, there is victory). Actually, this statement is also the motto of our Supreme Court and occurs in the Mahabharata as many as 11 times in different contexts and with slight variations.\n\n&gt;#Each WHC consists of seven parallel conferences, one each on economics, education, media, organisation, politics, women and youth. \nAfter attending several sessions and being both speaker and moderator in one, I can vouch that there was little negativity, aggression, or anger in the Congress. Instead, the mood was positive, optimistic and constructive. This was a happy and celebratory gathering, full of networking and friendship opportunities.\n\n&gt;In addition, there were serious deliberations on the challenges and opportunities that Hindus face globally, as well as what we could do for the betterment of humanity. Nowhere did I see or hear cries or calls for narrowly sectarian agendas or hatred towards other communities. Harmony and cooperation rather than opposition and hostility characterised most sessions.\n\nThis is honestly amazing. Seven conferences in parallel, on a variety of highly relevant topics.\n\nTo hell with TED talks, why aren\'t we having an annual National Hindu Conference?! ^(*[Congress is a gaali in India now]*) I would ***love*** to attend an event like this, where speakers come and speak on various issues, from a perspective rooted in Dharmic thought/ literature/ philosophy? \n\nHinduism, as a Dharma, has basically been nearly stalled in its growth and development for **centuries**. We\'ve had some inspiring thinkers in between, but a lot needs to be done to catch up with a rapidly evolving world.  Circumstances are changing faster than ever before. Technology, climate change, caste-dynamics, demographic shifts, inter-faith conflicts, educational standards, policy matters. All these things affect Hindus, and yet Hindus have no unified forum to discuss these things and shape the Hinduism of tomorrow! Hinduism has a great ability to evolve with the times, but without a place to have that talk, how would we go about doing it?\n\nModern day Hinduism is not shaped in the minds of the Hindus, among their Hindu peers, but instead is shaped in the minds of individual Hindus as they absorb popular opinions floating in from the West. Hindus 50 years ago completely and totally accepted Western values regarding sexual taboos, modesty, and education. And now that the west has become liberal about sex, we\'re absorbing that slowly too. Are we actually ever going to sit and discuss among our peers what *WE* think?\n\nAnd while we certainly need to evolve, we also urgently need to re-ignite some of our older practices - including the **traditional Dharmic style of debate** *(where, the loser of the debate \'converts\' to his opponents point of view, and abandons his initial position - meaning the people arguing are doing so from a position of intellectual honesty, and have* **actual skin in the game** *- not just blabbering for the sake of it, the way westerners do - all the fancy rhetoric when it comes to the theory, but when the time comes to apply their logic to their own kids, they suddenly become ultraconservative and prudish).* \n\nHindus themselves **desperately** need a refresher course on what Hinduism is all about. It\'s not just about babas and pujas. Nor is it about vimanas and ancient aliens. The "colonized Victorian mindset" reaction towards 377 from certain segments, showed that many Hindus still can\'t seem to remember, that Hinduism **celebrates** plurality of sexuality - it doesn\'t oppose it.\n\nThere is a desperate need for us to start updating our religion/dharma and talking about it more. Footage of two thinkers from opposing viewpoints, debating in whatever language they\'re comfortable in, should become viral, as one gets rekt by another\'s logic and wit. Sususwamy vs Sadhguru. Dalai Lama vs Ramdev. A common Hindu man vs some bigshot. Doesn\'t matter.\n\nSadhguru\'s debates with various people are already popular enough that there\'s genuine interest there. But when he\'s put up against someone of his own caliber, equally able to twist words, cite examples, quote scripture, and argue a point relentlessly, instead of sitting back and lecturing people, the interest will *explode*. \n\nLiterally for the first time in Indian history, the **common junta** *on a continental scale* will be able to follow new developments, and feel the ripples made by new thoughts as they are introduced into the Dharmic fold. Earlier, it would take years or decades for a new thought to crystallize and spread to various parts of the country. Today, it can happen instantly. We NEED this.\n\nThis would shape our own internal narratives in such a positive and healthy way, that even 10 Ram Mandirs wouldn\'t be able to compare. And we would no longer need to cite thinkers from 125 years ago, when discussing Hinduism. There would be little space for misrepresenting Hinduism as some stagnant, dead, thing, that hasn\'t changed in a thousand years. \n\nWe need to bring the vibrance and vitality back into Sanatan Dharma.'<br />Author: 'fsm_vs_cthulhu'  id: '9f928s'<br />Score:70<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9f928s/a_few_days_ago_we_witnessed_the_world_hindu/</li>

Excessive noise causes difficulty in breathing, hypertension, sleep disturbance, hearing impairment and heart diseases.\n\nThe anti noise committee in Mumbai have taken several steps to combat the problem of noise pollution. In our country, noise is mainly caused due to traffic sounds or social noises such as loud speakers, crackers and honking of horns. Traffic noises though controllable are not totally avoidable. Loud speaker and cracker noises can be totally avoided however that battle is far from won. Public requests are issued every year during festivals to avoid playing music on loud speakers and to not burst crackers that make loud noises at least, but to no avail.\n\nOn the honking front we seem to be making a little progress though. The traffic police have created no honking zones and they observe no honking days. They even conducted an experiment and found that honking did not affect the speed with which a vehicle travels on the roads what so ever. Thus, proving honking totally useless.\n\nAs conscious citizens we should all contribute towards creating less noise and save ourselves from the consequences. We should cut down honking, stop bursting crackers and listen to music softly (or even better on headphones) '<br />Author: 'BlubberMunch'  id: '9f6ofu'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9f6ofu/battle_against_noise_pollution/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Indo-Amerique: The Left vs Right - Part 3 Leaders'<br />Body: "One reason why I became so interested in Indian politics was because it resembled one of my favorite shows - Game of Thrones. Powerful leaders and their parties (houses) would duke it out over the Iron Throne of New Delhi. These leaders would garner an almost religious following and produce mass movements and ideologies with their speeches, stories, and policies.\n\n\nThe most powerful personality in Indian politics today is Narendra Modi, current PM and leader of the BJP led NDA (National Democratic Alliance) that controls the Indian government. Born a poor chaiwala (tea seller) in a lower caste family, Modi had the world against him. He defied all expectations and has become one of the most beloved, as well as hated, leaders in India’s history. His policies have focused on welfare for the poor, ease of business/economic reforms, massive efforts in infrastructure, and a soft push of Hindu assertion (critics will call it Hindu nationalism but that conversation is for another post, as is a whole analysis of Modi himself).\n\n\nPrior to Modi, the Indian Right's most prominent leader was Atal Bihari Vajpayee. A freedom fighter who saw the fall of the British and birth of an independent India, Vajpayee has become a beloved politician across all the spectrum due to his broad appeal through mixing liberalism and Hinduism and vital reforms that catapulted India's GDP and growth during his stint as PM. Major milestones would be nuclearizing India with atomic bomb tests, a victorious Kargil War, and strong economic reforms. Sadly, a bad monsoon season and political hubris cut his rule short with the next government reaping all the benefits of many of his policies.\n\n\nBoth of the above have been hounded by allegations of Hindu nationalism/extremism and turning a blind eye to violence against minorities. - especially during Modi's rule as CM of Gujarat in 2002. Modi's handling of demonetization and GST have also been criticized as clumsy and unneeded. However, I believe both these reforms have achieved positive effects\xa0such as increased tax collection, financial inclusion, increased digital money use, and overall a more formalized economy.\n\n\nWith their dominance over Indian politics, the Indian Left have had many more leaders especially coming through the Congress’s Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. The Nehru-Gandhi family have been a large source of India’s policies since independence.\n\n\nIf I'm going to honest, I believe the Nehru-Gandhi family has had some of the most catastrophic effects on India as a country and society. They pushed a horrible version of secularism (emphasis on minority appeasement over separation of church and state), Marxism (Induced self-hatred of India culturally and crippling socialist economic policies), and an arrogant sense of divine right to the PMship of India (Nehru, Indira, and Rajiv all engaged in entitlement to the PM position culminating in the Emergency and 1984 Anti-Sikh riots carried out by Rajiv and the Congress Party). Rajiv's wife, Sonia Gandhi, took over the party after his assassination and has become synonymous with scams and corruption. Today their heir, Rahul Gandhi, an absolutely unqualified man child coddled by a much more cunning and conniving Sonia Gandhi, is here to reclaim his family’s supposed personal property - India.\n\n\nHowever, credit should be given to where it is due. Nehru steered an impoverish India through the extremely tough initial independence years. He imprinted a powerful spirit of secularism to ensure the protection of minorities. He truly believed that the diversity of India was its strength. Indira Gandhi split Pakistan in half during the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War and gave freedom to Bangladesh (East Pakistan). She also crushed a rebellion in Punjab (very brutally unfortunately). Rajiv Gandhi's government kickstarted many of the precursors to the economic liberalization of India.\n\n\nToday, BJP’s sheer dominance has made many Indian Left parties consider allying with each other in a “Grand Alliance” in order to push Modi from power. A hodgepodge of unsavory leaders have begun to shake hands and present a terrifying alternative to the current government. Here’s a list of a few big players:\n\n\n* Mamata Banerjee - West Bengal’s CM whose party has brutalized and killed opposing political party members and captured vote booths thereby destroying democracy in Bengal. Mamata is probably the worst when it comes to minority appeasement of all of this group and frequently tramples on the rights of Bengali Hindus in order to secure her vote bank of Muslims and illegal Bangladeshis.\n* Mayawati - A narcissist who used government funds to build a statue of herself during power, Mayawati’s power rests on mobilizing and isolating Dalits (the lowest caste) and encouraging caste based voting.\n* Akhilesh Yadav - Another caste opportunist who rallies the historically strong Yadav caste to bully other castes in his state of Uttar Pradesh. During his rule, government and gangs were synonymous as well as the occasional appeasement here and there.\n* Lalu Prasad Yadav - One can say an older version of Akhilesh with even more family based nepotism and corruption. A destroyer of development.\nOther leaders from regional parties as well as communist parties may enter this Grand Alliance (called a Mahagathbandhan in India) to unseat Modi. The biggest danger not only comes from many of these unsavory personalities who want to rule but also, the natural and dangerous instability that will befall India if they take over.\n\n\nThus ends my initial analysis of the Left vs Right in an Indian context. I have probably only covered about 25% of it and again this is in my personal perspective with biases and all. I haven't even touched on great independence leaders like Gandhi, Patel, etc... as I wanted to focus on more policy based discussion. I may expand or revisit this in the future if you all want. However, now it's onward to go deeper into Indian and American politics and culture.\n\nIf you want to see the post with sources, check out my blog: [**Indo-Amerique**](http://indoamerique.com/the-left-vs-right-part-3-leaders/)\n\nFor the previous parts and other posts, click [**here**](http://indoamerique.com/).

The idea was crazy, and that is exactly what Vashishtha told Satyavrata, when he went to Vashishta's ashram for help. \n\nFor a mortal body to go into the heavens was against the laws of nature, any bending and breakage would have major consequences, said the uncompromising Vashishta.\n\nDisappointed and hurt, Satyavrata quickly moved to Vashishta's son, Shakti for help. Shakti might do it under some influence of bribing, assumed Satyavrata. But destiny had to laugh and Shakti enraged by this petty move, cursed him eternal pain and exile. \n\nIn this pain and exile, Satyavrata roamed throughout the world, in search of someone who could grant him his only wish - the heavens. And the destiny did listen, in came to his help Vishwamitra. Knowing of his arch-rivals' reluctance to help Satyavrata, Vishwamitra gave the king his word and decided to perform a Yagna to put the exiled king in the heavens. \n\nDays walked and nights ran, and the Satyavrata was lifted slowly to the doors of heaven. Indra and gods were scared, for they had never seen a mortal in heavens. Insecure and petrified, all the gods pushed Satyavrata again to where he belonged. \n\nSatyavrata fell down hard and cried for help. Vishwamitra came to the rescue again and the forces of the Rishi and the Gods collided mid-air. Satyavrata was hung in the air upside down, sitting in Padmasana. Looking like a cone, i.e. a shanku.\n\nIndra tried to convince Vishwamitra of the absurdity of Satyavrata's desire. Vishwamitra was convinced, for he could not justify breaking nature's laws for his tussle with Vashishta. \n\nBut what would happen to the word he gave to Satyavrata ? \n\nVishwamitra had to create a middle way. So the Rishi with all his might, created another heaven between heaven and earth. This heaven is where the Trishanku stays, and shall stay till the end of days, promised the Rishi. \n\nThe wish of king was fulfilled and laws of the nature stayed.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#Logos\n\n[If Satyavrata hangs upside down in mid-air](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-l92ctir6Py8/UrQc_CQACjI/AAAAAAAAAI4/E5Mb5EyCRbE/s1600/trishankus_heaven.jpg), like a Shanku(cone). Then why was he called Trishanku (three cones) ?\n\nThe question calls us to look into the Southern part of the sky. There we find a constellation named [Southern Crux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crux) (cross), accompanied by [two other faint crosses](http://www.starrynightphotos.com/southern_sky/images/crosses.jpg). The Europeans identified these as Crosses, but Indians called them inverted cones. \n\nTherefore, this group of three cones together was called Trishanku. \n\nBut, how does the story relate to the constellation of Trishanku ? \n\nThe answer perhaps lie in the relative position of Trishanku itself. \n\nThe constellation of Trishanku (i.e collection of Crosses) lies at exact cardinal South. \n\nBut altitude-wise it is very low, it does not even appear for most regions in the Northern Hemisphere. It gets started to be seen by 17 degree N these days. So for latitude &gt; 17 deg N, it is not even seen, today.\n\nBut it wasn't the case always, if we turn back the clocks a little bit, the Southern Cross begins to rise up, and the stories begin to make sense. \n\nFrom the ages ranging 200 BCE to 200CE, in the prime latitudes of 30 deg N, the [Southern Cross was seen in a spectacular position](https://imgur.com/dI3UIJX), like a cross standing on the ground itself. It stood upright during the time of April- May (more on this later). \n\nBut, in order to properly recognize the other two crosses, we might have to turn back the clocks further to 1000 BCE, wherein we can explain the story of Trishanku.\n\n[Here is a simulation to understand the motion and position of Trishanku in the sky](https://youtu.be/Qhbx32gh8sQ)\n\n##Trishanku Heaven\n\nThe heaven of Trishanku could now be seen in new light. The area in the sky above the ground, where the triad of Shankus lie is the Trishanku Swarga. This area is untouched by the movement of the Sun. It is a luminary, yet not being among the luminaries. Hence, Trishanku was raised to the skies, but never reached the heavens. \n\n## Crucifixion\nThe extrapolation is that the symbology Southern cross follows the [crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus](https://manna.amazingfacts.org/amazingfacts/website/truthaboutdeath/images/qa/thief-on-the-cross-large.jpg). Even the false crosses were included in the paintings as [The Three Crosses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Crosses), hence, the historicity of such events if I may say so, are in question. \n[The earliest of Christian paintings actually depict the three crosses together.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/RabulaGospelsCrucifixion.jpg/220px-RabulaGospelsCrucifixion.jpg). In fact, the festivity of Easter is deeply related to the constellation of Southern Cross, as furthest ascent of cross is in the time of April in Northern lattitudes.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n "<br />Author: 'decoder007'  id: '9enllg'<br />Score:43<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9enllg/monday_mythology_episode_3_the_king_and_the_cross/</li>

A litre of diesel costs Rs. 72.61 in New Delhi - the highest ever. In Kolkata, diesel is priced at Rs. 75.46/ litre, in Mumbai Rs. 77.09/ litre, and Rs. 76.75/ litre in Chennai.\n\nSome are cursing the Govt. and saying that same people protested against rising prices when they were in opposition and during UPA there was not too much price hike even when crude oil prices increased exponentially.\n\nCorrect folks!! but what were the conditions that make both protest two completely different scenario..here we do mistake in checking it.\n\nThere are some points which are to **be** considered before starting this blame game.\n\n**Blame no.1: Price hike was not as much by UPA even if the Global Oil prices were rising.**\n\n**Fact:** Manmohan Singh lead UPA Govt. wanted to have lesser impact of rising crude oil prices on common people so they did two things:\n\n(a) Raised almost 1.44 lakh crore rupees in terms Oil bonds to majorly bypass the impact of increasing crude oil prices and to lower the losses of oil companies (b) modest increase of 3-5 Rs in Petrol/Diesel prices.\n\nEven ex PM Manmohan Singh said that they are not doing right thing as someone has to repay the bonds.**This is what PM Dr. Manmohan Singh said in his address to the nation on Jun 4, 2008.**\n\n*"My Fellow Citizens,*\n\n*I know that the price increases we have had to announce today will not be popular, even though they are only modest. You must remember that the Government is bearing the burden of issuing oil bonds. Our oil companies are making a large sacrifice and are under severe stress.*\n\n*However, I would like the nation to remember that issuing bonds and loading deficits on oil companies is not a permanent solution to this problem.* ***We are only passing on our burden to our children who will have to repay this debt.****Cutting down on the returns of our oil companies will choke a sector vital for the growth of the economy. We need more corrective measures in future on many fronts.

During NDA one year central excise collection is almost 2-3 lakh crore so almost an year tax collection has been used for repayment of oil bonds. The strict spending and zero corruption of Modi government enabled this.\n\n**link:**\n\n[Govt repaid over Rs 2 lakh cr on account of oil bonds taken: Pradhan](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/govt-repaid-over-rs-2-lakh-cr-on-account-of-oil-bonds-taken-pradhan/article24263656.ece/amp/)\n\n**Blame no.2:** Govt. didn\'t passed benefit of reduced crude oil prices to consumers instead it increased Central Excise &amp; State VAT.\n\n**Fact:** Crude Oil prices fell considerably after 2014 but Govt. didn\'t passed this benefit to common people as it wanted to inculcate the habit of financial discipline in economy.\n\nGovt. used additional tax collection from Cebtral Excise wisely to fuel it\'s Capital intensive projects to Sagarmala (Port), Bharatmala (Roads) and to boost Waterways and Airport connectivity.\n\nAlong with this various social-securiy schemes were running be it PMJJY, PMSBY, Ujjwala Yojana (Free LPG connection to poor families) which already marked 5 Cr beneficiary, Ujala (LED distribution) which marked almost 30 Cr LED bulbs (upto 9th September 2018) distributed resulted in savings of 16000 Cr savings and reduced peak load demand, Jan-dhan account for financial inclusion of every household, PM Jan-Aushadi Kendra where one can purchase generic medicine instead of branded high value medicines and last but not the least \'AysushMaan Bharat\' which will be milstone in healthcare as it will provide Medi-claim facility up to 5 lakhs for 50 Cr people of poor households.\n\nSo ultimately the benefit of reduced crude oil prices passed to the person who is standing in the last line...the real execution of **\'Antyodaya Concept\'** by Pandit Deen dayal Upadhyaya.\n\n**Blame no.3:** Same people who were protesting earlier for increased oil prices are now in Govt and not saying anything.. hypocrisy??\n\n**Fact:** When I say that this Govt. is inculcating financial discipline in the ecomomy, there are reasons.\n\nWhile there is too much investment by the Govt in new Capital intensive and social security schemes along with running old schemes like MANREGA and food security scheme which act as a big subsidy based schemes, India Current Account Deficit (CAD) has decreased instead of increasing. Currently CAD is in the range of 2-3% of GDP during NDA compared to nearly 4-5% of GDP during UPA.\n\nIsn\'t it a good thing?

      <li>Title::: 'Around the World in 60 Crop Failures: The Fall Armyworm Reaches India'<br />Body: ' In August of 2018, the fall armyworm (spodoptera frugiperda) for the first time was discovered in India, infesting maize in the Indian state of Karnataka.\xa0 It is fall armyworm’s first strike in South Asia. The fall armyworm is is a species of moth endemic to the Americas, and has long been a scourge to farmers.\xa0 The fall armyworm The fall army worm is an unusually dangerous pest because of its ability to fly long distances, and armyworms are known to spread about 300 km (190 miles) per generation. The armyworms multiply rapidly, with a single female able to lay 2,000 eggs and breeds up to 12 times in one cycle. The armyworms travel in large hordes, packed as dense as 1,000 per square feet, descending on farms and destroying vast amounts of crops. The fall armyworm prefers maize and sorghum, though other strains prefer rice. However, unlike many other pests, armyworms are willing to destroy a wide variety of crops.\n\nThe fall armyworm has long been a challenge to farmers in the Americas, but a fundamentally manageable one. However, in 2016 the armyworm arrived in Africa, likely on a freight ship or on an airplane and it has wreaked havoc. The fall armyworm has no natural predators in Africa, and was able to spread like wildfire. The fall armyworm has spread to 38 countries in only two years, and damage to maize alone is estimated between $2.5 to 6.2 billion, total maize losses between 9 and 21 million tons, and losses are likely to continue to increase in coming years. In the most effected country, Malawi, it is likely armyworms will consume a quarter of total maize output. Armyworm has infested 42,000 hectares, with losses of 50-60%.\n\nMoreover, fall armyworm is increasingly resistant to easily available pesticides such as Carbaryl, and more powerful pesticides are unaffordable to most small farmers.\xa0\xa0WEMA (Water Efficient Maize for Africa) maize has shown some promise, although it is likely the armyworm and other pests will achieve resistance against these as well. Combating armyworm will rely upon innoavtive strategies such as intercropping armyworm resistance crops, the use of drones for constant monitoring of farms, and introducing American predators of fall armyworms to Africa. Increased international cooperation is likely to be necessary for best practices to all the places likely impacted by armyworms.\n\nLuckily, India is not as reliant on maize and sorghum as many African nations are. That said, India produces 26 million tons of maize a year, and over 4 million tons of sorghum. India has a well developed infrastructure for fighting such disease outbreaks, and unlike African farmers, the Indian government has been planning for this eventuality for years. At the same time, growing pesticide resistance shows increasing challenges to the input intensive methods that fueled the green revolution in India. Just as applying more irrigation and fertilizer can only increase yields up to a point, there are limits to what pesticides can do. Moreover, increased globalization, and higher temperatures only make the rise of new pests more likely. The fall armyworm is already impacting crops in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The fall armyworm is so entrenched in most African countries that it is likely to be a permanent presence. The Indian government will need to take strong and proactive steps to keep this from happening in India next.\xa0\n\n[http://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/Punjab\\_-\\_Path\\_Dependency\\_Armyworm.mp3](http://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/Punjab_-_Path_Dependency_Armyworm.mp3)\n\n[https://wealthofnationspodcast.com/around-the-world-in-60-crop-failures-the-fall-armyworm-reaches-india/](https://wealthofnationspodcast.com/around-the-world-in-60-crop-failures-the-fall-armyworm-reaches-india/)\n\n[www.wealthofnationspodcast.com](http://www.wealthofnationspodcast.com/)'<br />Author: 'gnikivar2'  id: '9e91jr'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9e91jr/around_the_world_in_60_crop_failures_the_fall/</li>

For over 20 years governments kept postponing implementing the GST. Manmohan had the majority to go with the GST when BJP was in the mat, but he like all PMs in the past he just went for the safety.

But when this doesn’t happen in real life then the violence begins. Another example would be when the hero commits a crime and gets away with, our people think they can too and we find an increase in the crime rate.\n\nI’m not saying that people should stop making movies.

      <li>Title::: 'Why do Jains celebrate Paryushana Parva?'<br />Body: 'Since this is already the second day of Paryushana according to Shwetambara tradition, this [beautiful answer](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Jains-celebrate-Paryushana-Parv/answer/Amit-Jain-183) gives deep historical insights as to the importance of this festival. I\'m quoting the full, as below.\n\n"\nThe exact reason of celebration of Paryushana is not known with various scholars claiming various reasons, with one being that gods (devas) celebrate this festival in heavens and thus we humans follow suite here on earth.\n\nBut what can be said with absolute surety is that its the festival where\xa0Jains celebrate the greatest of their virtues, fast, meditate, read their scriptures, atone for their sins, apologise for any excesses done by them to other sentient beings and thus comes out fresh &amp; new, and with renewed energy for the next year.\n\nBut what makes this festival really interesting is the difference in the way its celebrated by the two sects that make up Jainism. While 1st, the Shwetambara sect starts 7 days prior to Digambar (the 2nd sect), the latter picks up the celebration on 8th and takes it forward for another 9 days. What could be the probable reasons of the same? Lets explore this mystery and then try and formulate a hypothesis on what could be the probable reason behind this uniqueness of celebrations.\n\nThe speciality of common 50th day of celebration\n\n50th day of the start of rainy season is very auspicious to Jains. Its because as per Jain theology it was on the 50th day of the start of 2nd epoch of Kala-Chakra (the eternal wheel of time), when after 7 weeks (49 days) of raining (that turned our planet green and hospitable) that man first moved out of caves, apologised with each other of excesses done in past due to tough 1st epoch conditions and established civilised societies. Thus, the 50th day of rainy season is considered by Jains as the start of human civilisation and has since maintaining this tradition, by apologising with each other on this 50th day.\n\nSo, the 1st conclusion that we can draw from here is that Paryushana is essentially related to ‘apologising’.\n\nNow, lets explore at why would 1st sect of Jains celebrate it from 7 days earlier, and why would the 2nd carry it forward from the 8th till another 9 days?\n\nIf we look at Jain annals we find that before Mahavira there was fully established Church of 23rd Tirthankara - The Parshava. During the days of Mahavira the head of this Church was ‘Achraya Keshi’.\xa0Thus, there existed a small period of time where the Church of the 23rd Tirthankara and that of Mahavira, operated independently\xa0and though the two preached similar philosophy, were visibly extremely distinct. Its because the monks and nuns of the Church of 23rd Tirthankara wore extremely rich and expensive clothes, while the monks of Church of Mahavira roamed naked.\n\nJain annals then describe a meeting between Achraya Keshi and Gandhara Gautama - the primary disciple of Mahavira where the former cross questions the latter on their philosophy and ultimately acknowledges Mahavira as the destined 24th Tirthankara and merges their Church with that of Mahavira thus creating a unified Jain community.\n\nThis was indeed a great event. We can better understand the gravity and importance of the same by comparing the fate of prophets world over and the treatment they receive in balance religions. When Socrates preached His message, He was killed by the Greeks. When Christ came up with a message, Jews simply crucified Him. When Mohammed came up with a message, the Jews and Christians jointly denounced Him. But look what happened here. When the light of ‘Supreme Knowledge’ called ‘Keval Gyan’ lit up in Mahavira, the once incharge of religion before Him - The Church of 23rd Tirthankara scummed to His feet. An event unlike the normal human psyche which certainly would have sent heavens into gaga making them celebrate the same.\n\nBut there is a catch here.\xa0This means that the Church of 23rd Tirthankara were not the original followers of Mahavira and as there were numerous claimants of being the destined 24th Tirthankara those days, (with Buddha being one of them), naturally doubted Him\xa0- an act of extreme blasphemy indeed. An act that required atonement of the same degree. And what better time to atone for ones sins then the 50th - the most auspicious day of rainy season I marked above.\n\nThus, the Church of 23rd Tirthankara headed by Acharya Keshi would have thought of apologising for their doubting the 24th Tirthankara in a special way, and had probably started preparing for the same 7 days in advance by performing fasts and pratikarman (a prayer of apology) and would have collectively apologised on 8th day - the 50th day of the start of rainy season.\n\nThe Church of Mahavira would have welcomed Keshi and His set of monks and nuns, and thus started the 2nd phase of celebrations with celebrating one Jain virtue each day for next nine days, and then would have collectively apologised on 10th to the Church of Keshi for any ill feelings or ill-thoughts they might have harboured at their end towards any of their monks and nuns in the pre-merger days.\n\nThus, Paryushna Parva should represent coming together of the Churches of 23rd and 24th Tirthankara.\n\nThe fact that the word Paryushana itself literally means ‘coming together’ also points towards the fact that something special happened in those days\xa0which probably got forgotten over thousands of years of schism of the two communities a couple of hundred years after Mahavira.\n\nThe above is just my hypothesis, and I may be wrong and sincelry apologise for any mistakes. I further welcome scholars of the subject for feedback and any mistakes in my thesis.\xa0Lets all ‘come together’ once again, and solve the riddle of our greatest festivities which probably is also one of the greatest events to ever happen in the history of mankind.\n\nHappy Paryushana.\n\nLove\n"\n'<br />Author: 'longlivekingjoffrey'  id: '9dsuky'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9dsuky/why_do_jains_celebrate_paryushana_parva/</li>

India, as a country who does struggle with keeping violence against women under check, is making plenty of efforts towards women empowerment. Gender equality in India is negligible. In a place where female foeticide is rampant, female equality takes a secondary position.\n\nThat being said, the government does seem to be making substantial efforts for women empowerment. But this is not going to stop violence against women. It is common knowledge that men are stronger than women. No point denying that. The kind of force a man can use when intending to hurt, can in most cases over power the most empowered woman as well. No girl or woman is safe from violence until the men are educated. The boys need to be taught that their mothers and sisters may be weaker physically but they possess just as much brain power as men. They are just as much human and any form of violence is unacceptable. I feel until the male mentality doesn’t change, no amount of woman empowerment is going to help resolve the problem of violent against women.

      <li>Title::: "Dhruv Rathee's Lies"<br />Body: 'Hello Friends,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I was never going to make a post but I think that Dhruv Rathee and his misinformation has gone too far and he is fooling a large chunk of the population. It\'s something that I want to clear up and make sure that there is a conter to his misinformation. Here are some of the points that I have observed in his videos:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy now many of you may have watched his video "exposing" FMF as a "propagandist" channel but he makes some interesting points about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. He starts by doxing FMF, revealing his personal information and exposing him and his family to harassment online by his own andh-bakht. He further either justifies the action of his followers or neglects the fact that one of them threatened to reveal personal information if FMF\'s video was not deleted. At the end of his video, he gives three examples where his mass flagging campaign was justified but didn\'t answer why twitter handles like True Indology were being falsely reported in an effort to hide his crimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. He completely neglected to answer why he only showed Data of Highway Construction of two years when he had three years worth of Data. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. He questioned FMF\'s use of a study by questioning it\'s sample size, and methodology while devouting a full video on the faulty Thompson Reuters "Study" that even ranked the US as the 10th worst country for women there is even a Christina Hoff Sommer\'s Video detailing why the study is faulty. In his efforts to spread negativaty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc42V3WzAwA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc42V3WzAwA)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. He lied about BJP ruled states not offering donation money for Kerala for a whole day and then made another post where he said that AFTER his post those states pledged donation money. He also said that Karnatakata had pledged 200 crore which is a complete lie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. He had no comment on congress saying that they had no hand in the 1984 Sikh Massacre but still says that he is unbiased.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6. He said that he can\'t criticize Congress because they are not in power, but presents himself as "The Forth Pillar," He justifies not covering the Cambridge Analytica Scandal saying, but aren\'t his efforts to hide their crimes as a way to elect an obviously corrupt party?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7. He says that cerry-picking is a tactic of propaganda channels but repeatedly pushes the 1 crore jobs, which a new Manip Gupta video exposes as a lie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTB8SfeMEzc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTB8SfeMEzc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8. He deleted his comments on Islamic Refugees when a large chunk of his audience became Muslim. Luckily it was archived and we can see his real views.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20180529190940/https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story\\_fbid=937194469760614&amp;id=100004102083125](https://web.archive.org/web/20180529190940/https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=937194469760614&amp;id=100004102083125)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n9. He repeatedly censors anyone offering a counter-argument to him on twitter then crying "Muh Freedom of Speech"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10.Ater Those Urban Naxals were exposed as terrorist, he had absolutely nothing to say, while calling the government fascist when they were first arrested.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n11. He talks about over-generalization but calls anyone who counters him or his views as an andh-bakht, bigot, BJP IT cell. He deleted one his comments on FMF\'s video where he does this. It can be found in his community section.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQBWxx8C6zSiwikmoey1yVg/community](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQBWxx8C6zSiwikmoey1yVg/community)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n12. He neglects to mention his ties to Abhisekh Mishra. And the fact that he was supporting him. Dhruv\'s comments can be found pinned on Mishra\'s videos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTroAMmKLcQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTroAMmKLcQ)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n13. He justifies his reasoning from presenting the cost of the Fitness Challenge video as a "mistake," but calls Manip Gupta a propagandist when he litterally said what was written in a The Hindu article, despite it being one of his trusted source.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n14. Furthermore, he presented that story from a random website, despite he himself claiming that you can only trust some credible news outlets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n15. He still won\'t mention why he claimed the Wire as a "neutral portal," despite it being an obvious leftist one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n16. He repeatedly fears and anger by his misinformation, but claims that it is done by propagandist channels like FMF.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n17. His channel was active before BJP came into power but at that time he wasn\'t criticizing UPA but was still making videos criticizing BJP and praising AAP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/user/dhruvrathee/videos?view=0&amp;flow=grid&amp;sort=da](https://www.youtube.com/user/dhruvrathee/videos?view=0&amp;flow=grid&amp;sort=da)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n18. He says that channels that expose his misinformation are just trying to distract the public from "real issues," but I guess misinformation is a real issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n19. He deletes comments on his new video that call him out on the above mentioned. (Muh Free Speech)\n\n \n\nI ask you all to please send this post to FMF. Since he has gained some popularity and another video on these points will expose him for the rat that he is and please share it and subscribe to channels such as FMF and Sham Sherma because this battle on misinformation is important.

This is a prevalent mentality across the country. Is it patriarchy? I suppose they firmly believe that child rearing is the mothers’ responsibility. As if it’s only the woman’s child. \n\nThe child needs the presence and attention of both parents. Besides that, these days most urban families are nuclear. It’s unfair to put the entire burden of the house and the child on the mother alone. It was the decision of both parents to have the baby. Then why must only the mother have the responsibility of looking after it? The companies probably think about their own profit while setting such policies. But the government must do something. Make it mandatory for atleast 3 months of paternity leave.

Average Indians still reeling under the effects of socialism, understood nothing about it then. 1/n\n\nWhen I was a young refugee student, I used to often wonder about the human rights activists who were friends of leaders of terror groups in Kashmir.

Many among us cringe and sigh but the truth is out there—the anarchists of the 80s and 90s could get away with anything because they had two things—money and the English language. 6/n\n\nThe liberal tongue was tied because the anarchists masquerading as human rights champions were nobody but their own bratty children or cousins or losers of their clans and families. It’s a one large family, serving another family, the mai baap. That’s all there is to it. 7/n\n\nNow, the same people are crying hoarse because they know their time is over and the time for their questioning has arrived. 8/n'<br />Author: 'ribiy'  id: '9df02q'<br />Score:36<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9df02q/the_story_of_socalled_liberals_of_india/</li>

      <li>Title::: "How the Church nearly sabotaged Goa's biggest infrastructure project"<br />Body: 'If you\'ve ever flown to Goa you\'ll know that the airport in Dambolim is bit of a dump. It was built by the Portuguese in 1955 as a desperate attempt to won over the local populace as the claims for liberation were growing louder. During the Goan liberation the Indian Navy took over its operations where it operates from till this day. Subsequently a civilian enclave within the airport was formed and Goa was connected by air with the rest of the country.\n\nIn time as air traffic grew first whispers about a bigger airport for Goa came to be heard. The ICAO in 2005 stated that 7m passengers will be the ultimate capacity of the airport and urged the government to find a site for the new airport. \n\nMopa in north Goa was identified as the location for the new airport. As usual there were opponents to the project. But in this case it was slightly different - the protests against the airport were headed by a catholic priest from south Goa. \n\nYou would wonder why a priest from about 100 km from the proposed location was so staunchly opposing the project. The answer lies in demographics. South Goa is predominantly Christian. North Goa is majority Hindu. The church\'s concern was that when the new airport opens the centre of Goan tourism would shift to the north and "affect the businesses operated by Christians." \n\nThe project which had remained dormant for years was revived by Parrikar in his previous term. As one approval after the other arrived, the church took the litigious route to try to stop the project. As a final desperate move, it appealed to the High Court of Goa to cancel the approval given by the National Green Tribunal on the grounds that a number of trees will be felled. The High Court refused to cancel the clearance in its judgment last week thus paving the way for building of the airport. It is scheduled to open in 2021. \n\nTLDR: The Church will go to any length to uphold its bigotry.\n\n'<br />Author: 'cocowave'  id: '9d3jk5'<br />Score:62<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9d3jk5/how_the_church_nearly_sabotaged_goas_biggest/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Indo-Amerique: The Left vs Right Part 2 - Policy'<br />Body: 'What if I told you a world leader is driving intense efforts towards tackling climate change, introducing free/subsidized healthcare for 500 million on his country’s poorest citizens, and pushing a uniform civil code for all citizens rather than separate codes labeled by religion. What if they introduced a national sales tax, abolished instant divorce (can only be used by men), and was pushing the state towards a more unified national ethos fulfilling the old Latin phrase, E Pluribus Unum - "Out of many, comes one."\xa0Just this sample of policies is more left than anything Bernie Sanders has actually ever accomplished in his career. The thing is, this was all done by India’s current Prime Minister, Narendra Modi - someone who is viciously deemed a “far-right Hindu nationalist” by international media and by much of the English speaking media in India today. Here lies our second point - the Indian Right and Indian Left are not bound to the traditional Left/Right dynamics of America.\n\n\nEconomically, both the Indian Right and Indian Left (BJP and Congress respectively) lean towards a lot of democratic socialism. Indian Right leans more towards capitalist thinking on the spectrum however while the Indian Left can go all the way to full blown Mao Zedong exalting communism. Capitalism a la America currently has no place in India. Time will tell if that changes as even the current Modi government has placed a large emphasis on welfare schemes to benefit the lower strata of society. Examples would include campaigns targeting financial inclusion, housing projects, electrification, replacements to cleaner cooking oils/utensils, and much more. The most impactful of them all will be starting soon - Ayushman Bharat Yojana - healthcare for the poorest 500 million Indians. An initiative with the potential to change the face of India forever and deliver millions from poverty to prosperity.\n\n\nSocial matters pretty much boil down to the Indian Right catering to Hindu/Dharmic opinions while the Indian Left caters to Abrahamic opinions. Many times, this causes the whole of the Indian political system to be a battle of idiot extremists. Currently, the Indian Left is trying to block the Uniform Civil Code initiative (All Indians follow the same law) as they want to keep appeasing many radical Islamist elements who favor the current situation where Muslims have their own Personal Law. A horrible result of this is the tradition of Triple Talaq - where a Muslim man can instantly divorce his wife by uttering "Talaq" 3 times. In addition to this, there are several laws that again reek of the IL\'s appeasement including government interference only in Hindu temples, crippling Hindu schools while giving free reign to madrasas/convents, etc... The Indian Right indulges more conservative Hindu elements through policies such as bans on beef slaughter, sponsorship of pilgrimages (Congress has also done this for Hajj though), etc...\n\n\nOther policies are where it gets even more interesting. When it comes to the environment, you could argue that the Indian Right is more environmentally friendly than the Indian Left - primarily due to the Indian Right’s affinity for vegetarianism/less meat consumption (Animal agriculture/slaughter is the leading contributor of greenhouse gas outputs and thereby climate change). Saving the forests/environment is usually a toss up depending on who’s trying to develop what, but credit should be given to the Modi government whose\xa0Swacch Bharat drive (Clean India and waste disposal scheme, which drew large praise by Bill Gates) and zeal for renewable energy are powerful agents for working towards a better environment. Both parties have had their problems with free speech, but the Indira Gandhi\'s dispassion for it takes the cake, manifesting eventually in the horrid Emergency, where Indian democracy ceased.\n\n\nThe Indian Left has ruled for most of India’s independence due to a variety of factors:\n\n* The “Gandhi” name associated with Congress since independence.\n\n* Mahatma Gandhi being killed by a Hindu extremist - big blow to the Indian Right in early years.\n\n*The Indian population was intensely poor and illiterate for most of its independent history - the Gandhi name and free money (socialism) sounded very good then to the downtrodden masses.\n\n*The Nehru-Gandhi dynasty’s abuse of political power, money, and corruption\n\n*The Indian Left’s frequent use of tribalism, regionalism, and caste to divide and conquer; just like their British predecessors did in the past.\n\n\nBy now, I have to mention caste and how it influences Indian politics (I’ll get into why the caste system came about and ways to combat it in another post). With the Indian Left automatically securing minority votes, they now needed to break the majority Hindu population into subgroups to get votes. In comes the caste system - built and bred for breaking Hindus. The Indian Left would emphasize caste differences over Hindu unity and frequently engineer caste agitations pitting caste vs caste for government benefits and/or dominance. Unfortunately, there were and still are certain bigoted Indian Right people who still believe in the caste system; this would play directly in the hands of Congress as lower castes + whatever random caste that had been given Congress benefits would now support and shut out Indian Right parties from the government. Congress continued the reservation system for castes (essentially affirmative action for the lower castes) past its original 20 year length and even extended it out to well off castes in order to win votes. While I believe reservation is needed for the poor + lower castes; it is hugely abused in its current form with rich lower castes and many middle/upper castes benefitting from it due to extensions by Congress. Caste is the best tool for Congress to break not only Hindus, but India itself - something it has been doing for the past 70 years.\n\n\nIf you want to see sources and more posts/past topics, you can head over to my blog: [Indo-Amerique] (http://indoamerique.com/the-left-vs-right-part-2-policy/) \n\n\nAny comments/critiques would be much appreciated!

However, this sort of vengeful thinking isn\'t a good thing for a civilized democracy to have.\n\nAlso, when we think about the capital punishment that existed in the previous centuries, we feel that those practices were "barbaric" like these (https://www.google.co.in/search?q=capital+punishment+in+previous+century&amp;client=ms-android-xiaomi&amp;prmd=niv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4ocDI9aHdAhUKQI8KHaY_BhQQ_AUIEigC&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=560#imgrc=ROjG2Tm4FtGsWM)\n\nHow are we any different from the previous centuries in this regard?\n\nPersonally, I\'m confused.

      <li>Title::: 'Indians, do you think India should be capitalist, socialist or mixed economy?'<br />Body: 'I think that people nowadays get too hung up on buzzwords of socialism and capitalism instead of actually looking at technicalities. I think that both ideologies have their own advantages and flaws and it would be better for India to remain a mixed economy.\n\nThe US prison system has literally become a business since prisons are privately owned. The net neutrality controversy that happened because of USA is out of question in India because of TRAI, which is a government body and a socialist aspect of Indian economy. Another thing that India does better is [healthcare and medicines](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/01/29/health-care-surgery-india-america-disruption-column/97056938/). Though India still has a lot to improve, our government sets limits on the cost of medicines unlike USA in which the companies can put any price they want which common man can\'t afford. So despite available medicine, the patient cannot treat himself because of unreasonable prices.\n\nDisadvantages of socialism are well known. Everything is owned by the government. No one has incentive to work hard or put extra effort. Basically, think of socialism as a stereotypical government jobs in India or something like that show "Office Office". India had a pretty slow growth before economic reforms.\n\nI think that mixed economy has advantages of capitalism but makes sure that greed of capitalists don\'t take over the country. Also, socialism does provide more equality of opportunity and less nepotism for common man as compared to capitalism. Corruption does exist in the government sector but with stricter rules and procedures becoming online, I don\'t think the corruption is as bad as before and the situation will get much better in the future. I think that mixed economy is the way to go for India in the long run.'<br />Author: 'RandomRedditR'  id: '9cnrlv'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9cnrlv/indians_do_you_think_india_should_be_capitalist/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Postcard News is a source too'<br />Body: "Recently, I have been reading up on and posting articles from Postcard news. The most prominent of the refutations in this sub that I get are that its founder was caught for fake news.\n\nFirst of all, specifically to those who go ad hominem by trashing Postcard news as a source saying that the founder was arrested for peddling fake news - if you can tolerate sources connected with Barkha Dutt of the Radia tapes scandal, you can well tolerate Postcard as a source of news. In fact, after the arrest, it is likely that Postcard news is a lot more careful about its sources.\n\nNone of us should be taking *any* news source at face value. While that includes Postcard news, it *also includes the so-called mainstream sources*. Does anyone here seriously believe that the mainstream sources are not biased? Or miss catching editorialising terms in the news articles? Or miss terms that frame the issues in a certain manner that promote a certain specific narrative?\n\nWhen Postcard news says that Mani Shankar Aiyar was collecting money for China during the '62 war, whether its founder was arrested or not for fake news is irrelevant, especially since Mani Shankar Aiyar has been accused of this in the past, and by a conservative journalist and poet Dhiren Bhagat. Dhiren Bhagat died in a car accident in 1988 at the age of 31 (suspicious, no?)\n\nComing back to Postcard founder's arrest, at this point, I think that it is likely that it rubbed a lot of people the wrong way in Karnataka. Here is an IE article: https://indianexpress.com/article/india/crime/postcard-another-case-against-fake-news-website-owner-mahesh-vikram-hegde-bjp-leader-his-lawyer-5129358/\n\nThe article points out a headline on Prakash Raj: “How can a man who left his wife and ran after a dancer after the death of his son dare to question Modi and Yogi?” We should ask if this is actually true in its essence. Did Prakash Raj actually walk out on his wife of many years and go after another woman? If he did not, this is libel. But if he did, the choice of words can't make it libel, can it?\n\nSo, I expect to continue to post articles from multiple sources, *including* Postcard news. \n\n"<br />Author: 'xdesi'  id: '9cm6ta'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9cm6ta/postcard_news_is_a_source_too/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The General State of Science Series - Introduction to Microfluidics'<br />Body: '#**Introduction to Microfluidics**\n\nThis post is a continuation of my previous discussion regarding science. I will, this time, focus on a topic closer to my heart and a topic, I hope, you will see the potential of. Microfluidics is an emergent field at the interface of science, engineering and biology. That’s the short definition. The long definition from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfluidics): \n\n&gt; Microfluidics deals with the behaviour, precise control and manipulation of fluids that are geometrically constrained to a small, typically sub-millimeter, scale at which capillary penetration governs mass transport. It is a multidisciplinary field at the intersection of engineering, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, nanotechnology, and biotechnology, with practical applications in the design of systems in which low volumes of fluids are processed to achieve multiplexing, automation, and high-throughput screening.\n\nSo, what do these definitions mean? Basically, the goal of microfluidic systems is to use modern fabrication methods to design and create microchannels via various techniques such as CO2¬-Laser cutting[1](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0960-1317/26/10/107001/pdf) or 3D Printing[2]( https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167931717304070). \nSo, why do we wish to produce fluid channels at the same dimensions as most human cells and other micro-organisms? There are two reasons: \n\n1. We observe very beautiful and clean movement of fluid within these microchannels due a mechanical engineering factor known as the Reynolds Number. This dimensionless parameter is used to determine fluid behaviour within all channels – pipe-sized or micro-channel sized. Fluid behaviour inside a channel using this parameter is determined by pipe-shape, diameter, viscosity of the fluid (think: how easily does something flow) and volume flow rate (i.e. how much volume of fluid passes through in a second: Volume of fluid flow rate (Q) = Velocity of fluid (m/s) * Area the fluid passes through i.e. pipe cross-sectional area (m^2)) \n\n2. There are different modes of fluid flow dependent on the Reynolds Number. If the number exceeds 2500, typically, you will see turbulent flow. Below this number, you usually find Laminar Flow. So, what do these look like and what is the difference between them? Well have a [look]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl75BGg9qdA) The first part of the video shows laminar flow and you can see the motion of the dye is ordered and does not deter significantly from the original location of entry inside the channel as it moves from left to right. The second half shows turbulent flow in action. As you can see, the flow is much more ordered in the first half of the video than the second half based on how neatly defined the coloured fluid is. \n\nIn Microfluidics, flow is nearly always laminar like this. To achieve turbulent flow, one needs to have very high pressure in a microfluidic chip made of plastics materials. As a result, the flow is highly ordered and this can be used to great effect for separation of objects like cells, microparticles and potentially nanoparticles. I will discuss this and more in the next edition of Science on Indiaspeaks!\n'<br />Author: 'ameya2693'  id: '9cbrxq'<br />Score:32<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9cbrxq/the_general_state_of_science_series_introduction/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Monday Mythology : Ep-2 --&gt; Breaker of Cities'<br />Body: '&gt;हे पुरंदर तूने गैया \nभीषण युद्ध कर \nहमको दी है \nतूने ही उस दानव से लड़कर हमको\nयह वृष्टि दी है \nदी है तूने असंख्य शक्ति और ऊर्जा \nहर एक नरनारी को\nतेरे वज्र के ही प्रताप से \nहर्ष आता प्रजा सारी को \n\n-- Hymn to Purandar\n\n&gt; Purandara – Indra, the destroyer of forts\n\nIf one takes a look at the most cited and prominent Indological papers, one would see this phrase quite frequently. A phrase generally used to establish the fact that Indra, the chief god of Vedic pantheon is some sort of fort-capturing, [vandalizer](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=r4s-YsP6vcIC&amp;pg=PA307&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=purandara+breaker+of+cities&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9-5MFlyv2n&amp;sig=rzo9vNZzGX_jU531qmqv95wMxbU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjXo427243dAhXLdisKHflmD6QQ6AEwAnoECAgQAQ). Perhaps a distant, blurred memory of an ancient Aryan war-lord invading Indian lands and breaking forts in the process. \nMeanwhile, his counterpart Vrtra, is an affluent possesser of gold, cattle and rivers. Perhaps a native non-Aryan Indian king. The struggle for resources held by Vrtra leads to a decisive battle where Vrtra gets slayed at the hands of Indra.\nThroughout the Indological literature, Purandara’s translation as *breaker of cities* has been used with indubitable confirmity. [It is taken as a fact that doesn’t even need further explanation](http://www.murtylibrary.com/downloads/MCLI-Guide-for-Translators-August-2015.pdf).\n\nPurandara is an epithet of Indra. It can be broken into two roots, Puram and dara. Here, Puram supposedly means cities or fortresses, whereas dara is a verb which means breaking. \nHence, **Puram (cities) + dra (breaking) – breaker of cities**\nThe effect of this interpretation is large and widespread. With a chief god whose name literally means breaker of cities, Vedic people could be seen as invaders. This could be employed to reinforce the established historical scheme of post-Harappan Vedic India, and the Aryan Invasion/Migration theory at large.  \n\nBut could one question this interpretation of Purandara itself and come at a completely different perspective of looking at Indra and Vedic people. Following article is one such perspective. \n\n&gt;Indra – The dragon slayer\n\nOne popular name of Indra is Vrtraghna, which literally means the vanguisher of Vrtra. His battle with Vrtra is central to his identity and his ascension to the chiefdom of the gods.\nWhereas, Vrtra literally means the one who envelops (Vrita means circle). Vrtra is often described as a serpent dragon (ahi) with numerous heads.  \nOne could perhaps dig deeper about the idea behind such naming and ask questions such as : \nWhat are the treasures Vrtra holds in his envelopment ?\nWhy is he a dragon, why not a baboon ?\nIs the affluence of the serpent enveloper (Vrtra), a recollection of Harappan life, or is there something more fundamental to it ?\nLet us take a look at the most famous mythological stories around the ancient world. \n1. Zeus, the Greek storm-god kills the serpent Typhon with his thunderbolt.\n2. Indra, the Indian storm-god kills the serpent Vritra with his thunderbolt, known as Vajra.\n3. Marduk, the Sumerian storm-god slays the primordial chaos Tiamat, who took the form of a serpent dragon.\n4. Thor, the storm-god kills the serpent Jörmungandr with his thunderous hammer known as Mjolnir.\n\nWherever there is a human culture capable of telling stories, there would be a story where a god gets his treasure from a dragon-figure. \nA lot of early philologists used to see these stories as bardic explanations of precipitation and lightning. Storm-gods would use thunderbolt to kill the dragon-cloud who has kept the waters in its captivity. Bards would invoke these storm-gods either when the tribes needed water or to quell the untimely torrential rains. \nThe philological description is only partially right, because we have the following tales without any mention of thunderbolt or rain.\n\n1. The Greek Heracles kills the dragon, Hydra as part of his twelve labors.\n2. The Mycenaean Perseus kills the Gorgon Medusa, the reptilean monster dwelling in the underworld, in order to rescue Andromeda. \n3. The Egyptian god Ra engages in eternal battle with the serpent-demon Apophis.\n4. The Indian god Krishna, tames the serpent-demon Kaalia to reclaim Yamuna and its waters.\n \nThese comparisons are not new, and these similarities are not cherry pickings. The whole gamut of mythological literature is constituted with these tales. It was examined quite thoroughly by the 20th century psychologist, C. G Jung, who tried to apply these myths to understand human psyche. He noticed particular patterns in mythologies of cultures separated by thousands of miles and years. Fables sung in completely unrelated tongues shared astounding commonalities. \nHe called these common, repetitive patterns - archetypes. \nThe central archetype as described by Jung is one of the Hero, which was explored in amazing detail by Joseph Campbell. \nThe story of the Hero is one where the protagonist takes on a journey to establish order. To do so, the Hero enters  the fortress of the dragon.\nIn the fortress, the dragon hides some treasure that the Hero seeks. The journey culminates in the slaying of the dragon of chaos, and re-claiming of the treasure.\nThe content of the treasure might vary from culture to culture and usually depends on the culture’s environmental setting. \nIn India, the dragon would keep the cattle, gold and rivers, and that is exactly what Vrtra holds in his captivity. But where does Vrtra hold the rivers ?\nHe holds them in his puram (fortress). Is his puram a historical place ?. No.\nCan a physical place even hold a river ? No.\nIs Pura even a proper noun ? No.\nWhy ? \nBecause dragon fortresses are typical of the Hero myths. Sometimes the dragon fortress is the netherworld, sometimes it is a dreaded lake, sometimes it is a lifeless desert. Sometimes it is just a cloud. Sometimes it is a physical fortress like Mahishmati. \nBut what we know for sure is that the fortress is an abstraction. It represents the metaphorical dark place where the dragon of chaos resides with the riches. These riches could be a river, cartels of milk and honey, elixir of life, the holy grail or a physical person like Devasena. \nThe re-claiming of the treasure marks the re-establishment of order. \n\nOne could safely say that the Vedic Sages used the word Puram for that dragon fortress. Puram is the dungeon that Indra destroys to reclaim the riches of cattle, rivers and gold. It is as simple as that.\nIn fact, one meaning of Puramdara is thief, a robber. A hero does not need to destroy a fortress to rescue the treasure, he could just sneak and rescue like Baahubali did in the movie Bahubali: the beginning. \n\n&gt; Puram - The Mythical fortress\nVritra is mentioned 293 times and is the 5th most popular character of the Rig Veda, meanwhile Indra is the most popular character. It is safe to say that one of the central mythological themes of Vedic literature itself is that of Indra and Vrtra. \nIn the same Rig Veda, the epithet, Puramdara occurs only eleven times and each time it is translated by directly as the fort-destroyer by Griffith. He assumed Pura as a physical, built in stone, fortress.  \n\nFrom Puramdara - destroyer of forts by Griffith. The image of Puram as a historical fortress was carried forward by the Indologists. Eventually leading to the interpretation of Puramdara - breaker of historical cities by D D Kosambi. \nThe Vedic version of Puram has been mistakenly interpreted as a physical, built in stone, fortress or a township. It is a well known fact that Puram is a common noun, which has been used to denote body, a cage*, skin and even a brothel in the Sanskrit literature. \n\nUsage of Puram as a mythical, abstract place is not limited to Vedas. It is widespread in the classical Sanskrit and even Tamil literature. **Punnagaithu purameritha peruman** (Shiva, who laughed and burned the three purams). The three Puras in Tripurantaka myth are abstract fortresses with their stations in Earth, Sky and Heaven respecitively.  These three Puras are then personified with names and are reffered as demons in Pauranic Literature.\n\nIt is evident from this analysis how a simple-looking, easy-going translation could have far reaching consequences. Poor psychological understanding of Indra-Vrtra myth combined with undeniable haste for finding literary evidence for Aryan invasion fuelled a lot of historians to continue with this interpretation of Puramdara. \nAll this was done while knowing very well that Vedas are primarily spiritual texts. Hence, the correct perspective of looking at events and nomenclature in Vedas is one that is grounded in metaphysical and psychological, rather than historical.\nThe Puramdara interpretation was pivotal in reinforcing the idea that Asuras, Vrtra, Panis and Dasas belonged to a different race, and that the battle for water, cattle and gold was a racial war. \n\nAn idea that was echoed in Nehru’s Discovery of India and was disseminated to masses via Shyam Benegal’s [Bharat ek Khoj](\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slgzvgfzCeU). Now, one could perhaps watch this episode in completely new light. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  '<br />Author: 'decoder007'  id: '9aqtbu'<br />Score:40<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9aqtbu/monday_mythology_ep2_breaker_of_cities/</li>

Netflix memsaab git good. if i want propaganda i would watch a documentary or read NDTV. \n\nmy chota (just another stupid ignorant bigoted audience) review of propaganda show ghoul.\n\n when we want entertainment we play games, watch a movie, go out with friends or so. but now in 2018 it is different. u expect entertainment, but inturn u get a propaganda dick forcing it inside ur mouth.\n\nsimilar to how SJW\'s are forcing agenda into a fucking videogame (battlefield V) ghoul too is nothing but a stupid agenda. \n\npolitics in the show was obvious in the first 10 minutes itself. but they went too far and just deepthroated the agenda. even if we remove the politics in the show it still sucks.\n\nacting and production was :lit: . Netflix india bought me hope to some OC indian content. but after this show. I\'m pretty sure the future shows gonna suck too. i give an exception to sacred games because it\'s core storyline is political drama, so it\'s fine. but ghoul?? if it really were just another horror show it would have been so much better ..\n\nthe show with politics : sucks. basically it\'s the usual future india will be filled with the bad Hindu\'s torturing the peaceful muslims. the government discriminates by religion. just like how religion of peace islam destroyed thousands of  temples and the culture. us future indians will destroy anything "anti-nashnul".... hmm then our protagonist Radhika who plays a muslim girl in the tyrant indian hindu army  gets recruited for interrogation of a terrorists. spoliers ahead from now on.. but read anyways as the story is predictable. hmm. so now our protagonist daddy is arrested for possessing anti nashnul books. then her father is found out to be innocent and is killed in the prison.because he is a muslim :O  . \nsince the daddy knew he was going to die, he summons a demon to kill everyone 10/10 logic. because of 2 army officers idiocy the entire army had to suffer. thank you daddy. nice logic.fight corruption with violence. nice message u got there. and well as u can predict.the demon kill everyone and leaves the army chief so the radhika didi could behead him isis style. (literally) . then at the end the radhika didi even though is clearly guilty for killing an army. is apparently innocent because bad hindus are hunting peaceful muslims. at the end our dear peaceful protagonist summons the demon.. so that it could well... kill every innocent out there? &lt;end&gt;\n\nwithout politics : acting, production, anurag sirji all did well. the show is 7/10 without politics but still doesn\'t make any sense. it would just be another horror movie were the hero saves the day. so i believe they added masala to it.\n\n'<br />Author: '4chanbakchod'  id: '9aojuz'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9aojuz/lost_hope_in_netflix_india_ghoul_review/</li>

Government has setup detention/interrogation centers (very similar to the ones deployed by United States in Middle East) where no rule of law is followed and Muslims (and only Muslims) are interrogated till they die. A new wing of military called Ministry of National Protection is formed solely for this.\n\nThe interrogators are shown to talk like "sale sari kaum hi inki aisi hain", and "yahan (interrogation center) main aane wala koi bhi besoor nahi hain". There\'s liberal use of the word "anti-national". Interestingly, the interrogation center also records confessions of "opposition leader".\n\nThe only difference between SC and Ghoul is that there\'s no mention of Hinduism as a religion, and only "sarkar" appears.

Uighurs are required to install government-\xaddesigned tracking apps on their smartphones, which monitor their online contacts and the web pages they’ve visited. Police officers visit local homes regularly to collect further data on things like how many people live in the household, what their relationships with their neighbors are like, how many times people pray daily, whether they have traveled abroad, and what books they have.\n\n&gt;All these data streams are fed into Xinjiang’s public security system, along with other records capturing information on everything from banking history to family planning. “The computer program aggregates all the data from these different sources and flags those who might become ‘a threat’ to authorities,” says Wang. Though the precise algorithm is unknown, it’s believed that it may highlight behaviors such as visiting a particular mosque, owning a lot of books, buying a large quantity of gasoline, or receiving phone calls or email from contacts abroad. People it flags are visited by police, who may take them into custody and put them in prison or in reeducation camps without any formal charges.\n\n&gt; People on the list have found themselves blocked from borrowing money, booking flights, and staying at luxury hotels. China’s national transport companies have created additional blacklists, to punish riders for behavior like blocking train doors or picking fights during a journey; offenders are barred from future ticket purchases for six or 12 months.\n\n&gt;One of the biggest concerns is that because China lacks an independent judiciary, citizens have no recourse for disputing false or inaccurate allegations.\n\nDo you think something like this could work in India?

      <li>Title::: 'Teach Me Thursday - Biosensors - Aug 23, 2018 [X-post from r/IndiaNonPolitical]'<br />Body: 'Hello!\nToday\'s TMT is one of my favourite topics and and is something I\'m working on. Also, pardon spelling errors since I\'m on my mobile. Let\'s begin!\n\n**Biosensors** are basically devices which can detect any organic molecule. Most common examples are - pregnancy kits and glucometers which measure your sugar levels.\n\nhCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, is a hormone secreted by pregnant women. A pregnancy kit detects these molecules in the urine and indicates whether the woman is pregnant or not.\n\n**How do Biosensors work?**\n\nFirstly, Biosensors have a site for the molecule. It could be anything, urine, blood, ions, antibodies, proteins, tissues, enzymes, cells etc. These are called analytes. These analytes are placed/attached on the on the surface of the Biosensor.  This can be done by coating the surface with nitrocellulose, aminosilane etc. Sometimes sols like hydrogels are also used to entrap these molecules. \n\nNext comes the **"Bioreceptor"**. Bioreceptor interacts with the analyte molecule and produces certain signals or output that can be interpreted. Bioreceptors could be antigen/antibody based ( like ELISA test for AIDS), or enzyme/ligand based. \n\nNext comes the **"Biotransducer"**. Transducers are devices which convert energy from one form to another. The reason we require Biotransducers is that the signal generated by the bioreceptor in the previous step needs to be in a form we can interpret or read. On the basis of transducers, Biosensors are divided into types like Electrochemical (these can either measure current or voltage), optical (these are based on optical characteristics like fluorescence, absorbance etc), potientiometric(which measure the potential difference), piezoelectric (detect vibration of quartz crystals under electric field) etc. \n\nNow that we have out signal for detection, we need to amplify into measurable quantity, therefore, it goes to the **amplifier.**\n\nLastly the signal goes to the detector and the display (for eg, the monitors in glucometers). \n\nSo the process goes like this - \n\n**Biomolecule(analytes)--&gt; Surface attachment--&gt;Bioreceptors--&gt; Biotransducers--&gt; amplifier--&gt; detector--&gt; display.**\n\n[Here\'s an illustration](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=Biosensors&amp;client=ms-android-xiaomi&amp;prmd=binv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1hYK-0IPdAhUTcCsKHVpnCZ0Q_AUIEigC&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=560#imgrc=zZBoAyqz7wphKM:) \n\nThe cool thing with Biosensors is that it can detect very low amount of analytes too. Many diseases can be detected accurately in early stages when the symptoms may not be full blown. Besides the clinical uses, they can be used for checking pollutants level in water/air or testing for a specific toxin/contaminant. They have so many applications. \n\n\n Biosensors are an interesting mix of bio and technology and we see new developments everyday.\n\nFor further reading -\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosensor\n\nhttps://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/biosensors-their-fundamentals-designs-types-and-most-recent-impactful-applications-a-review-2155-6210-1000235.php?aid=85357'<br />Author: 'manhoosvyakti'  id: '99p3jo'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/99p3jo/teach_me_thursday_biosensors_aug_23_2018_xpost/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Telangana, AP &amp; Bifurcation: Some numbers, a perspective for looking at things and an idea of where things stand after the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh.'<br />Body: 'This was a comment made in response to what I felt was a rather careless and ignorant remark.\n\nnp.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/98ibsz/direct_taxes_paid_by_various_states_maharashtra/e4gsdcr/\n\nMost people to this day carry some misconceptions and uninformed/misinformed opinions regarding the bifurcation of Telangana. This is just a drop in a bucket. The other arguments have been made plenty of times and often get dirty so I will leave them be for now. This, in my opinion is as politically neutral as it can be or perhaps as much as I could keep it. Feel free to point out any incorrect inferences and inaccuracies that you see. \n\nI present a bit sanitised version of the comment here but if something feels odd about the tone or content keep in mind that this was a comment made in response to another. \n\n&gt;The very same source you quote to make your point, disproves and contradicts your point. Let me try and explain. Some simple math incoming. Don\'t blame for not warning you if you find it a bit difficult. \n\n&gt;In the very same source, let us look at the numbers for tax revenue collection for two consecutive years, one before bifurcation and one after bifurcation. For FY 13-14, a combined undivided AP shows a tax revenue collection of 32296.1 crore. The very next year i.e 14-15, after bifurcation, AP shows 29769.01 crore and TS shows 439.46. It more or less adds up and nothing weird here. So, pretty reliable number I would say. But what does this tell you? A region that makes up 3.5 crores of the total population of 8 - 8.5 crores of an undivided AP shows such abysmally low tax revenues? What does it tell you about the people of that region and their spending? What does it tell you about the financial progress or backwardness of the region? \n\n&gt;#Is that an argument in favour of or against bifurcation? \n\n&gt;Now, let us see what happens in the following years. in the year 15-16 Telangana shows tax revenues of 1955.31 crores. A significant jump from 439.46 of the previous year. That is a 345 percent increase. It has been growing significantly since and the trend doesn\'t seem to be slowing down. \n\n&gt;https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/260618/telangana-registers-highest-growth-rate-in-tax-collection.html. \n\n&gt;If we were to talk about Hyderabad, I would assume that since it is the common capital for a period of ten years that all of the revenues collected won\'t go to TS alone. Even if someone were to make the argument that they do, that is actually even more horrifying and would further highlight the discrepancy. Talking about the trend of Telangana\'s growth, what do you think will happen once Telangana has Hyderabad for itself after those 10 years? Look at the discrepancy again and see for yourself that the rest of AP has been doing rather fine for a long time.  \n\n&gt;Now, let me guess, the goalposts will change and now you are suddenly concerned about the people of Telangana and any such emotional jazz. Also, since I have mentioned the financial bakwardness and purchasing/spending of people and the need for bifurcation, it is only fair that I talk about what has happened afterwards. Here is an interesting fact, not only has the tax revenue collection grown like stated above, but the GSDP and the per-capita GSDP have skyrocketed after bifurcation and since the region of Telangana achieved self governance. Telangana is now the richest south indian state going by gdp per-capita. Remember the discrepancy I pointed out earlier. \n&gt;Now, look at this: \n\n&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_states_and_union_territories_by_GDP_per_capita#/media/File:Indian_states_and_union_territories_by_GRDP_(nominal)_per_capita.png\n\n&gt;Going back to the numbers of tax revenue collections, between the years of 15-16 and 16-17 AP went from roughly 34k crores to 36k crores. In absolute numbers that is a difference of 2k crores and in percentage terms it is an increase of 5.8 percent. That is more or less consistent with AP\'s growth and numbers even before it was bifurcated and remains the same afterwards. So, no damage done there by bifurcation. TS on the other hand, between the years 14-15, 15-16 and 15-16, 16-17 went from 439 to 1955 to 3452 crores. In percentage terms that is a 345 percent increase and then a 76 percent increase but more importantly in absolute numbers it is an increase of almost 1500 crores in both cases. So, no damage done for AP but after bifurcation you have Telangana catching showing nothing but tremendous growth. All of this would have been non existent and the discrepancy would have continued or perhaps gotten worse. Maybe you want the people of TS to suffer, who knows? \n\n&gt;#Are all of these developments a positive result of bifurcation or are a negative effect? \n\n&gt;In effect, since the region of Telangana left the state of Andhra Pradesh and became a state of its own, not only has it been tremendously beneficial for the region of Telangana, the state of Telangana, the people of Telangana but it has also been beneficial for the Republic of India in a way it otherwise would not have been had it remained a part of a unified AP.\n\n&gt;On a side note, I just realised that that is an official govt (correct me if I am wrong) website in which the name of the state is spelled as "Telengana". That is it. I want independence for Telangana. \n\nhttps://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/Documents/Direct%20Tax%20Data/Time-Series-Data-2016-17.pdf'<br />Author: 'artha_shastra'  id: '98sqos'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/98sqos/telangana_ap_bifurcation_some_numbers_a/</li>

When that horror happens we know hindu supported government will take strict action and punish all individuals involved then why make a riot ? So there is no equal right and protection lost to hindus there, so u cant compare it to black lives matter or dalits matter where they are not getting eaual rights and protection, please counter reply to this\n\nRW\nbut what u r saying is only hindu should have equal rights and protection not others which is wrong\nDo you see how you\'re trapping yourself with your logic?\nI\'m saying everyone should have equal rights.

I care for Hindus. My culture, my religion, and my co-religionists will NOT benefit from my caring for others, they will benefit from my caring and acting in favor of their interests, their well being, and their safety.\nLet other care for themselves. Government of India has not done justice for Hindus anywhere, from Kashmir to North East, and has always acted against the best interest of Hindus while it gives special privileges to non-Hindus.\nIndia right now is an Anti-Hindu Rashtra. And I will not stop trying to reverse that, and make it a Hindu Rashtra with equal rights for all religions.\nFrom RTE to HRCE, from Martic Scholarships to Muslim-only freebies, from Gau Hatya to Gau Rakshak Hatya, I will fight for Hindus and Hinduism.\n\n[–]crazymelazy \nU r totally wrong , hindus always had and having advantage in equal rights and protection than others mostly in india, maybe because of low caste or poor or bad reservation system many might have a suffered , but as a hindu religion compared to other religion in india we hindu mostly having better rights and protection , atleast u r pointing your logic and not abusing me i appreciate for that\n\nRW\nI have named the discriminatory laws and policies above. Your calling me wrong does not negate them.\n\n[–]crazymelazy \nYes there are bad laws and bad things focus on that only , as said most hindus has good rights not all, u can help them ,but dont ignore others suffering to, atleast dont hurt them or spread hate to them just because they are trapped around bad things, go lawfuly against bad individuals and bad things only not go against a whole group where innocent people are trapped, just like noting that 2002 train incident horror also note that something horror happened to innocents trapped after that,in both horror incidents lot of innocents suffered horror, while noting horror things happened to our innocent hindus also note how bad hindus made horror in aftermaths if u r not then u r indirectly support those horrific incidents including train horror incidents, bad happends to anyone is bad, even if hindu or muslim did bad blame both not one side, dont be a baised one side commenter, it will not help your cause at all, if u dont acknowledge our mistakes if u dont acknowledge innicents suffer if others also then as a hindu we cant improve if that what u want, as a hindu if u want hindu society to improve then acknowledge all bad things and good things not one sided baised thats what i am saying, if u dont then u r spreading hate which means u r harming hindu society not improving it\n\nRW\nI have limited energy and time, and I choose to use them for protecting Hindus and Hindu interests.\nFor example, many years ago I stopped donating to Greenpeace, and started donating to a Goshala. The main benefactors of the Goshala are Gujarati Jains, the working crew is almost entirely Bihari and UP Hindus, while administration is in the hands of a TamBram society. I find it beautiful and diverse.\nI have recently started donating to an outfit caring for Hindu Refugees from Pakistan. These people faced horrors of Partition till long after Partition. I care deeply for them and will probably start voluntary work in their camps soon.\nI don\'t give a shit about Rapingyas or others like them. Why should they go to Madrassas, learn to hate Hindus and other Kafirs, and commit crimes against them?\nYes there are bad laws and bad things\nAnd I will continue to fight against them. I will vote for the most pro-Hindu candidates. I will cheer them and ignore any stupid shit they do or say. Just like Muslims and Christians and Communists do.\nI don\'t support any violence, but my heart doesn\'t care for non Hindus. Hindus didn\'t make a mistake in Godhra, Muslims did. Big mistake. And not enough has been done to shut down the Jihadis in India.\n"one sided baised thats what i am saying, if u dont then u r spreading hate"\nLOL. No. Not caring for something doesn\'t mean I hate them. In future refrain from using such labels and terms against me or I\'ll have to ignore you entirely. I don\'t care for ice cream and paan, doesn\'t mean I hate them. I completely disagree with everything Islam and Quran say, doesn\'t mean I hate Muslims. I like human beings, and I wish they\'d leave their hateful ideologies like Islam, Racism, Nazism, etc.\n\ncrazymelazy  \nGood come back points, still mistake in right side view point is not looking at others and ignoring them , it means u r not understanding the enemy at the others , which means u cannot protect our fellow hindus as u ignore to see outside and learn them, u cannot protect hindus if u dont know whats outside of that. Outside hindu is not just only enemy there r some neutral and friendly others withing enemy surrounding which means if u learn them if u help them a little they can help u back and help to destroy bad enemy easily as they around them without sacrificing innocent fellow hindus just becuase we ignore to understand others around bad enemy, best way to protecting our fellow hindus is by making good friends around the bad enemy to attack bad enemy or change them without sacrificing ur fellow hinuds, by ignoring u r giving up chance to stop hindu enemy without sacrificing innocents hindus\n\nRW\n"u cannot protect hindus if u dont know whats outside of that"\nOh, don\'t worry, read my post history, I am more than aware of what\'s going on globally, from Philippines to Africa to Canada.\n"some neutral and friendly"\nUnless they help Hindus directly, I don\'t care. Let them have their private feelings, IDC.\n"others withing enemy surrounding"\nI could Hindus like you among the passive enemies. You let bad things happen to Hindus because you don\'t care.

It should be obvious with out masculinity symbols like Ranveer\xa0 Singh and Hrithik Roshan but step 1 is to actually be physically attractive.\xa0\n\nIf you aren’t go to the gym, lose or gain weight depending on your requirements and you should have an average body within 6 months. How ripped or not you want to get is up to you after that. Remember if you are gaining weight you need to be eating a minimum of 2500 calories a day. I see so many people eating 1000 calories going to they gym and wondering why they aren’t gaining weight\xa0\n\nHAIRCUT\xa0\n\nget a good haircut. Again look at Bollywood celebrities, see which one of them have a hair type that matches yours and take a photo to your barber. They should be able to sort you out.\n\nNO GOING OUT WITH OIL IN YOUR HAIR. Use a conditioner or nothing at all.\n\nSHOES\n\nA must, sorry but your sandals aren’t going to cut it. Get some nice looking suede shoes like these :\n\nCLOTHES\n\nI’m not going into this but purchase a wardrobe that you can mix and match. Then you don’t have to spend too much. For me that means 7 shirts and two jeans and a sports coat. After that depending on your income you can add on.\n\nYour colors have to flow. Dark colors together and light ones together. So white shit and beige pants or brown shirt and black jeans and so on.\n\nMAKE SURE THE CLOTHES FIT. A size smaller is better than a size bigger.\n\nTINDER\n\nAssuming you’ve got your look set, take GOOD photos. None of these ridiculous selfies. Get a photographer friend if you don’t know how to or read up on it.\n\nBest tones are during sunrise and sunset and at particular angles. You should be investing a week in this and at the end you should have maybe 5 good photos which is enough. 4 full face shots and one doing some sort of activity like rock climbing or something.\n\nNow that you’ve got a match you can’t say “Hey”. Her inbox is spammed with heys and making it an interrogation like what do you do blah blah will make her vagina dry fast.\n\nKeep it light, keep it fun and keep it easy.\xa0\n\nGoogle Craig Ferguson late night show to understand the vibe that works best.\n\nMake plans to meet up in real life ASAP.\n\nPRACTICE\n\nif you’re from a sheltered area, get talking to women to understand what they want and how they interact. You’ll get rejected infinite times but that’s part of the game.\n\nOne crucial difference between white/black guys and Indian guys is that the whites and blacks will get rejected 99 items, get lucky once and they brag about how they are God’s gift to women.\n\nIndian guys might even get lucky more than them but they will obsess over the rejections and claim everyone hates them.\n\nREJECTION IS PART OF THE GAME. if you aren’t getting blown away you aren’t approaching enough.\n\nHappy hunting !!'<br />Author: 'Thirdworldrising'  id: '981zg8'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/981zg8/how_to_be_attractive/</li>

As a thumb rule when you have ground to stand on you do not need to resort to hyperbole and embracing flawed ‘perception studied’ as factual accuracies displays the behavior of a group of people so intent on their truth they are willing to discard facts which is never a good look.\n\nSecond, there is a tendency amongst this group to mindlessly import cookie cutter arguments from the west without critical thought. Case in point : in the west, white men are privileged therefore in India Hindu men must be privileged. This was reflected in aditi mittals stand up in Melbourne where in she made fun of indian men’s dicks. The irony was that it was in front of a western audience people who are 10x more privileged than the average Indian male and in her ‘intersectionalism’ she didn’t understand that.\n\nLastly we are now seeing them completely hijacking the narrative. With the recent ridiculousness of a Swiss player refusing to play in India, these people are now claiming the Middle East is safer for women because they don’t get cat-called. Never mind that south Asian women are raped by the middle eastern men with no recourse for justice or that drinking as a women in the wrong places throws you in jail, in their minds the Middle East is now safer because of the lack of Eve teasing. The power of western propaganda is that it brainwashed people against the soil under their feet.\n\nUltimately if this movement does not embrace facts and logic and sees propaganda for what it is rather than saying “well at least the West is calling is out for our issues” their movement will implode if it isn’t doing so already.'<br />Author: 'Thirdworldrising'  id: '981z9r'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/981z9r/feminism_is_a_joke/</li>

When America was at war with Asia for much of the past few decades and is now entering a Cold War of sorts with China they employed an age old tactic of mental warfare : emasculate the men.\n\nThey have employed it to devastating effect with the Asians with the phrase “Chinese men have small penises” becoming common stereotype amongst the whites and they have a bizarre fascination with black dick (literally). None of this has grounding in science so you have to question why does a group of people with pork dicks have such an obsession with the dick sizes of other groups ?\n\nAs India enters the global consciousness it appears that they are now turning their attention to us. It is common knowledge that Indians are the most endogamous groups out there where we overwhelmingly prefer our own so Hollywood’s narrative of constantly pairing indian men with white owned and vice verse begs the question, why are they portraying something that is not reflective of reality.\n\nThere is no more damning indictment of this subtle propaganda than in the show sense8 where in an Indian women faints at the sight of white dick (literally) during a sacred ceremony and a scene of her making love with her indian husband is played of as comedic fodder with the Indian man having a ‘broken’ dick.\n\nThey have the money and the audience and their propaganda is going to start in full swing.

They were blaming the ‘regressive hindus’ on the hold up for section 377 when it were right wing Christians who were holding up the process.\n\nThey seem to have become engrossed in identity politics and a bizarre\xa0 one at that. You can ‘criticize’ your own or the dominant group but other groups can only ‘criticize’ themselves. The irony of a group fighting for equality (or so they say) and trying to regulate speech based on background is probably flying over their heads.\n\nWhat’s even more damning is that they have imported oppression olympics from the USA and now are trying to say ‘Hindu males are privileged’ and poor ‘African Americans are being shot dead, why are we so racist to them’ except the average African American out earns the average Indian &gt; 20:1.\xa0\n\nThey are also an extraordinary self loathing bunch, rather than offer constructive criticism they will pass racist comments about their own people “Indian men are rapey” and try and pass shitty humor like “the country is a shithole that can’t be saved” as edgy.\n\nIn the same breath they will worship Wes Anderson movies (movies that depict the white male as the benchmark and everyone else as props to orbit around his whims and fantasies) as “progressive”\n\nIs it really any wonder they are getting destroyed everywhere despite establishing a monopoly on discourse.

      <li>Title::: 'YSK : RIP is a very Christian expression and should not be used for Hindus or any dead from the Dharmic faiths.'<br />Body: 'RIP comes from *Requiescat in pace* which is used in Latin prayers to bless the soul eternal rest in Christ. \n\nBefore RIP it it was originally *Dormit in pace* which translates into "sleeps in peace" which means they are united with Christ in peace. \n\nEven the Jews use a variation of RIP. \n\nWhere does this rest in peace with Christ come from? From the Christian belief of *particular judge* which says that upon death, you are judged and either wait in peace (thus resting in peace with Christ) or in torment till the second judgement of the end of days. \n\nThis itself comes from the early concept of the *Limbus patrum* where those who sinned but repented lived in a sort of a good purgatory there they lived peace (RIP) till on judgement day, Jesus took them to heaven. \n\nIf you notice, not a single one of these concepts apply to Dharmic esp Hindu religion. \n\nIn Hindu philosophy we have the *punarjanmam* aka rebirth. As Krishna says in the Gita, the soul can never be destroyed and simply moves from form to form. Hindus (and Vajpayee, Unkill and myself are all Hindus) believe that the body is a shell and the soul is the essence of life and it moves from host to host till it attains *Mukti*and attains *Moksha*. This is not based on some last minute "repentance" but the fruits of your accumulated actions which we Hindus call Karma. \n\nThere is no resting in peace with Rama, there os no soft purgatory, there is no eternal judgement, nothing. \n\nHence if a Christian dies, I wish that they RIP in line with their beliefs. For a Muslim it\'s usually "may Allah have mercy on him" as while their estachalogy is similar to the Jews and Christians, it varies enough that RIP is not applicable for them. For Hindus, we wish them moksha.

Karnataka gets 1147.1 mm, Andhra Pradesh 890 mm, and Telangana 942.6 mm.\n\nHaryana gets a mere 554.7 mm, Delhi gets 747.1 mm, and Uttar Pradesh, 965.3 mm.

The normal rainfall in this period should have been 1606.5 mm. Instead the State has received 2086.8 mm. The rains and floods are the heaviest since 1924.**\n\n**Ernakulam district has received 21% excess rain, while Thiruvananthapuram district has got 37% excess rain. Kottayam and Malappuram districts have received 41% excess rain each.**\n\n**Idukki district, which has major dams such as the Idukki-Cheruthoni-Kulamavu dam complex and the Mullaperiyar dam**, has received a whopping **70% excess rain.** As expected, the district has seen many landslips and casualties.\n\nThe situation in the State is extremely serious.\n\nThe shutters of 35 out of 39 dams in Kerala have been opened to release water.

What I mistook for bigotry was more disappointment that stemmed from what Naipaul saw as defeatism and a moral degeneracy coupled with intellectual atrophy. \n\nI have been reading them again now (topical you see) and there is no anger. He was calling a spade a spade. He juxtaposes the greatness of our Hindu civilisation with the total degeneration of the what has been around for a 1,000 years (I disagree with the 1,000 year bit though, one of the greatest ever Hindu kingdoms was around 500 odd years ago). \n\nI have friends and relatives including my dad who hate him as a Hindu hater.

      <li>Title::: 'Weekly Geopolitics thread - Pakistan special - The internal tussle of power in Pakistan in past few years'<br />Body: 'On the eve of our 71\'st Independence day ,let us take a deeper look at the many things influencing the decisions and actions in our neighboring country \'Pakistan\'. This article will take a look at only how the the fight for power has been taking place in Pakistan and how a "soft coup" took place in past few years \n\nUnlike India , where foreign policy is the exclusive domain of the elected Indian government and the accompanying non-elected permanent bureaucracy , Foreign policy decisions and planning in Pakistan is often jointly planned and executed by both the elected civilian government and the Military and to a some extent,the ISI .  The Pakistani Military has a more dominant position though in the foreign policy and decisions involving south Asia , especially India and Afghanistan . The Government (courtesy of ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif )generally takes the lead when relationship with China are concerned .\n\n**Civilian government** - Generally the ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif enjoyed the most power when it came to foreign policy initiatives . Due to being one of the longest serving democratically elected prime minister in Pakistan before his disqualification and jailing , Nawaz enjoyed a certain amount of leeway and could often push back against the military administration of foreign policy issues . From making statements like "26/11 terrorists indeed came from Pakistan" to welcoming modi when he visited Pakistan on a surprise visit , Nawaz sharif could do things that any other lightweight or newbie Prime minster could only dream of without getting a push back from the military . In fact , there was much discontent within ISI too regarding Nawaz Sharif\'s foreign policy . The ex-ISI chief criticized the foreign policy of Nawaz sharif government and were quite unhappy that Nawaz welcomed Modi without any sign of protest at the abruptness of the meeting . However , equations have changed drastically in Pakistan with the fall of Nawaz sharif and his subsequent jailing . The second big leader from PPP party is also under corruption investigation and may fall like Nawaz too . This leaves only Imran Khan as the tallest national leader in Pakistan. However many international experts and even Pakistani people who have been watching the current elections with a keen eye are of opinion that Imran Khan definitely benefited greatly from the opportune timing of many of his political opponents in corruption and other cases so close to election . While no one is saying that the leaders who were convicted were innocent or clean , but their conviction so close to Pakistani elections definitely helped Imran Khan reap electoral dividends . So this raises the Question : Has Imran Khan struck a deal with the military establishment to concede power and foreign diplomacy to military in return for their backing and support ? We will have to just wait a few months to see what kind of directions Imran khan takes the Pakistani foreign policy in , or does he give up power to the army with regards to India .\n\n**Military establishment**- While the military establishment consist of army ,navy and air force ; the overall system and establishment is dominated by army leadership like other nations . The previous army chief : Raheel Sharif (not related in any way to Nawaz sharif or sharif family) generated a lot of goodwill within Pakistani public and in fact , there was significant support to give him a second term . However Raheel sharif denied any plans of staying on beyond his term . Post retirement , he was invited by Saudi Arabia to lead their multi nation military alliance which is currently waging war in Yemen . This sparked concerns in Pakistan that an ex army chief leading a Saudi military coalition in Yemen war could deteriorate relationship with Iran (who were arming some rebels in Yemen) . However Iran stated mum on the announcement and did not reveal their stand . With Raheel sharif off to Saudi Arabia , Qamar Javed Bajwa was selected as the new army chief . It was clear however , he had a high standard to fulfill as successor of one of Pakistan\'s most popular army chief . However  , the army soon got embroiled in multiple controversies .The biggest one being when an army general was caught on video paying cash to all the religious fanatics who had laid siege to multiple Pakistani cities in protest of a civilian government move .At the same time , previous generals have also been involved in multiple scams . From General kiyani ,who was accused of a offloading substandard medicines on army soldiers at inflated rates to land grab scam under a project called "DHA" , The PR and prestige of the army has undertaken massive hit in recent years . However one move that went under the radar for most people was the army\'s massive crackdown on news organisations and media which were anti-army and pro-Nawaz sharif . The army sealed the headquarters of the nations biggest channel who they felt were pro-Nawaz sharif stories close to the election . Dawn Newspaper was also viciously targeted . the \'Dawn\' newspaper in the recent years has been a fierce army critic and also ran a lot of anti - CPEC and anti - Imran Khan articles . In return , the army agents started harassing multiple journalists associated with Dawn ,  Newspaper vendors selling Dawn were harassed too .  Many who watch the country\'s politics closely are of opinion , that a "soft coup" has taken place where the army has silently usurped many government powers  . If this is true , this is a brilliant masterstroke . Because :\n\n1) Unlike a proper coup , a soft coup is more difficult to prove and resist . Also , there is no chance of it becoming a PR issue in international media \n2) By usurping government powers behind the scene , they get to wield the powers without being held responsible for it . If tomorrow shit hit the fans , then they can just point fingers at the civilian government and say its Democracy\'s failure and that army could have done better . \n3) They avoid a direct conflict with their opponents in the Pakistani society and just deal with their opponents one by one silently .From journalists being kidnapped regularly for making statements against them to initiation of corruption cases against political leaders who do not tow the party line , there is little scope for anti army opponents to resist . Its either shut up or get punished . \n\nSo now the question that arrives , is why now ? Why , almost a decade after musharraf , that the army is once again usurping power behind the scenes ? Once again , this just points to the possibility that the new prime minister Imran khan has stuck a deal with the devil . Some inside the army feel is that Pakistani is heading for a hard phase in coming years with the possible winding down of american war in Afghanistan under Trump , to having to pay for massive loans which become due in next few years to a critical currency crisis that has caused the pakistani rupee value in recent years \n \nIt\'s clear that India is once again dealing with an army which is feeling adventurous and could undertake drastic actions '<br />Author: 'HarshKarve'  id: '977eu2'<br />Score:27<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/977eu2/weekly_geopolitics_thread_pakistan_special_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'V S Naipaul on India'<br />Body: 'Note: I have pasted this from Knappily. I posted the same on r/India. I don\'t know if the mods will let it stay. \n\n\nWho said what?\n\nTributes poured for ‘author’ V.S. Naipaul, including from many of those who clashed with him.\n\n"Sir VS Naipaul will be remembered for his extensive works, which covered diverse subjects ranging from history, culture, colonialism, politics and more," India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Twitter. "His passing away is a major loss to the world of literature. Condolences to his family and well wishers in this sad hour."\n\nWilliam Dalrymple, an author and historian who contested Naipaul\'s defence of Hindu nationalism in India, called him "a giant among us". "Even if you disagreed with much that he wrote, particularly about India, you couldn\'t help be stimulated, influenced and catalysed by the brilliance of his laser sharp vision," he tweeted.\n\nOne of the many writers he argued with, Salman Rushdie also mourned his passing. "We disagreed all our lives, about politics, about literature, and I feel as sad as if I just lost a beloved older brother. RIP Vidia," he tweeted.\n\nTime is also opportune to recall some of Naipaul’s views on India:\n\nSpeaking about the Indian influence on his life and approach towards writing, Naipaul in his Nobel speech said he was greatly influenced by the short stories his father wrote on the Indian community in Trinidad and Tobago. "If it were not for the short stories my father wrote I would have known almost nothing about the general life of our Indian community. Those stories gave me more than knowledge. They gave me a kind of solidity. They gave me something to stand on in the world. I cannot imagine what my mental picture would have been without those stories," he said.\n\nIn the speech, Naipaul then goes on to describe how he learnt a lot about India from the writings and actions of leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi, along with British-Indian writers like John Masters and Rudyard Kipling. "There was the writing of Nehru and Gandhi; and strangely it was Gandhi, with his South African experience, who gave me more, but not enough. There was Kipling; there were British-Indian writers like John Masters; there were romances by women writers. The few Indian writers who had come up at that time were middle-class people, town-dwellers; they didn\'t know the India we had come from,"he said.\n\nHe regularly tended to his idea of India being the original abode of Hindus\n\nFrom ‘India: A Wounded Civilization’ published in 1976: “India has been a wounded civilization because of Islamic violence: Pakistanis know this; indeed they revel in it. It is only Indian Nehruvians like Romila Thapar who pretend that Islamic rule was benevolent. We should face facts: Islamic rule in India was at least as catastrophic as the later Christian rule. The Christians created massive poverty in what was a most prosperous country; the Muslims created a terrorised civilization out of what was the most creative culture that ever existed. India was wrecked and looted, not once but repeatedly by invaders with strong religious ideas, with a hatred of the religion of the people they were conquering. People read these accounts but they do not imaginatively understand the effects of conquest by an iconoclastic religion.”\n\nHe told The Hindu in 1998: “I think when you see so many Hindu temples of the tenth century or earlier time disfigured, defaced, you know that they were not just defaced for fun: that something terrible happened. I feel that the civilization of that closed world was mortally wounded by those invasions. And I would like people, as it were, to be more reverential towards the past, to try to understand it; to preserve it; instead of living in its ruins. The Old World is destroyed. That has to be understood. The ancient Hindu India was destroyed.”\n\nOn Ayodhya, according to his biographer Patrick French: “For the poor of India to identify something like this, pulling down the first Mughal emperor’s tomb, is a marvelous idea. I think in years to come it will be seen as a great moment.... It would be a historical statement of India striving to regain her soul. What puzzled me and outraged me was the attitude that it was wrong, that one must not undo the Muslim conquest. I think it is the attitude of a slave population.”'<br />Author: 'Chyavanpunk'  id: '975im6'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/975im6/v_s_naipaul_on_india/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Is India really that horrible?'<br />Body: '*Crossposted from r/india so the context may not apply entirely to this sub, but the question remains relevant* \n\nI was born in Delhi but only lived there the first 2 years of my life. I\'ve lived in the US for 17 years since. I\'m currently in my second year of college here. \n\nEven though I never truly "lived" in India, every time I go there I am fascinated by it. Honestly, despite being in America pretty much my whole life, I still consider myself an Indian by heart (I can\'t really explain why, but I just feel more spiritually connected to India than America) \n\nMy whole life my parents and family have told me about the incredible developments happening in India. The famous "7% GDP growth", "India overtakes _____ as __ largest economy", bla bla bla. \n\nPersonally, I feel way more at peace and comfortable and "free" when I visit India than I am in America. I\'ve always felt people here are always in their suit-and-ties, meaning they operate with many filters and it\'s tough to really grasp the genuine nature of a person. Furthermore, people here are quite ignorant of other cultures - I know several people who don\'t know what the Mexican flag looks like despite it being our neighbor, and several people ask me what Dubai is like even though it\'s not even in India. \n\nCulturally, I like Bollywood way more than Hollywood (my favs are Mera Naam Joker, Kabuliwala, and Guzaarish) and I\'ve remained attached to always developing my Hindi skills as well as my religious affiliation with being Hindu. \n\nBut man... after going through this subreddit, you guys really come off as extremely depressing. Seems like 90% of the posts on here are just shitting on India and everything about it. \n\nEven as an outsider and as young as I am, I know there are tremendous problems with the country - rape, lack of opportunities, income inequality, education, cleanliness, pollution, horrible ways of thinking... but surely one can still live a comfortable life in India and surely it has a solid future ahead of it? \n\nAs young and unexperienced I am, every time I go to Delhi I feel such pride in seeing the developments that have taken place from my previous visits. The metro system. The new technologies springing up on a daily basis. Incredibly posh areas where honestly I\'ve had more fun than some places even in Los Angeles, Chicago, etc. \n\nAmerica is far from a heaven. Rape, sexual assault, mental health, sexual and general education, drug use (and the drug war in general), racism, police violence, corruption, and bigotry is rampant here too. I have seen incredibly poor lifestyles of people here as well, such as an unemployed drug addicted single mom with three kids living in an incredibly terrible part of town. \n\nMy family is financially in the top 5% here in the States. I\'ve always lived extremely comfortably. Perhaps I\'m spoiled. I know that many of the luxuries I have here would be difficult to attain in India, but honestly I\'d rather have more of a taste of the personal freedom I have felt there than the material objects I have here. \n\nPerhaps I\'m just a follower of the "grass is always greener on the other side" mantra but man... this subreddit really kills my pride of being an Indian by heart. It\'s great seeing actual discussion on here sometimes, but sometimes I feel terrible for reading all the horrible things many of you have to say about the country and it makes me wonder if there is even any hope. \n\nMy ultimate life dream since I was a kid was to go back to India permanently one day and do whatever I can to help improve things, but judging by the harshness of this sub, perhaps that is just a childish pipe dream than a possible reality.

      <li>Title::: "Part 2 : Is Jawaharlal Nehru: The worst Prime Minister ever a discussion to mark the 72 years of Indian Independence and this man's vital mistakes."<br />Body: "In our first discussion we briefly discussed some of the mistakes of Nehru, which you can find here - [Is Jawaharlal Nehru: The worst Prime Minister ever?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/8mgwkf/is_jawaharlal_nehru_the_worst_prime_minister_ever/) . Each day I come across more and more stuff about this man and I felt it deserves another post and discussion to clear things up. Read on\n\nIn 2 days India will be 72 years old as an  independent nation. It is riddled \n\n1.  Corruption.\n2.  Caste  wars. \n3. Merit is not recognized. \n4. India is still under-developed, unlike  many of its cousins who got independence or became free nations during  the same period.\n\n**Socialism**:\n\n* Even today, about 66% of the  Indians have to be provided almost free food-grains (courtesy – National  Food Security Act of 2013), viz., coarse grains (millets) at Re. 1 per  kg; wheat at Rs. 2 per kg; and, rice at Rs. 3 per kg. \n* This is so because they are supposed to be incapable financially to buy  them at market rates. So, Indians are being made to do - *baap ke sir par aish*  – enjoying on the income of the father – here read “Government” in  place of “father”. Make Indians dependent on freebies instead of making  them learn how to earn themselves.\n* Farmers cannot survive without  farm loan waiver after every few years. The cycle of loan waiver goes  on. A large number of them are reported to commit suicide every year.\n\nDefence equipment more than 80% of it is imported, our education system is messed up, health sector is lacking so many things, infrastructure has been worse without proper sight and planning, agriculture sector is suffering in its own ways.\n\n**So, who should get the main blame?**\n\nShould it not be the first Prime Minister of India – **Jawaharlal Nehru**? He spoiled the **childhood**  of India to such an extent that now it is becoming extremely difficult  to get rid of the bad habits that India adopted during those early days.\n\nFirstly,  our first PM gave us the cancerous cells in the form of wrong-handling  of **Kashmir – Article 370, Article 35A and approaching UN on Kashmir  issue**. Due to these cancerous cells, the beautiful land of Kashmir  (which was equated with heavens on earth) has now developed a  terminal-stage cancer, which is continuously bleeding us profusely for  last 70 years, which needs an urgent surgery which may perhaps even be  fatal at least for some body parts. We are continuously at war due to  the disease that was given to us.\n\nOur first PM gave us the gift of  **socialism**, of **licence-permit raj**. Even if one wanted to manufacture  needles, a license was needed from the government – which would  generally be not granted. All our development got stalled.\n\nLicence-permit raj gave birth to corruption. Can we remove this cancer from our society?\n\nSocialism, for which we are paying till date, by being a developing country, forever. For the so-called ***Hindu*** **rate of growth,** which should instead have been called the ***Socialistic rate of growth*****.**\n\nChina policy, which has hurt our psyche more than the defeat and slavery of 1000 years.\n\nNot enacting a **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, but only a ***Hindu Code*** in the form of certain personal laws. Even though the Constitution desired UCC.\n\nMeaning of secularism was changed, it was secularism only if there was minority appeasement.\n\nPutting restraints on the private  sector, and promoting only public sector. We suffer till date, while  many of our Asian siblings have gone much ahead of us.\n\nStifling of the property right to  the extent of even denying reasonable compensation for acquisition of  land from landlords. The First Constitutional Amendment laid the  foundation stone for it.\n\nStringent labour laws, that have  stifled industrial development, leaving majority of population to depend  on agriculture which is not paying much, leading to farmer distress.  Even China, a socialist nation, has more liberal labour policies than  India.\n\nReorganisation of states on linguistic basis.\n\n***Oh muh Nehru setup the great IITs across in India ?***\n\nPeople don’t get tired of praising the public sector units and IITs that our first PM created. \n\n**Have you seen a tiny earthen lamp in a complete darkness?**  No doubt, it shines. But, it shines only because it is kept in complete  darkness. Bring the sunlight – direct light from the Sun – and then  look at the contribution of the earthen lamp! So, first you create **complete darkness**,  by not allowing anyone to setup industries or rather stopping them by  controlling licences, you control spread of education by  licence-permits. And, then, claim – WOW!!! PSUs! IITs!!\n\nOur first Government could have  made us or unmade us. By choosing the right policies or by adopting bad  policies. No doubt, subsequent governments could have changed the  things. However, first 17 years of our nation’s childhood days and  adolescent age were spent under the same PM. This was sufficient to  cross the minimum time required for habit-formation. Habits rather  became rock-solid as 17 years is a very long period during childhood  days to spoil any child. Old habits die hard. More so, if the habits are  bad ones.\n\n***Oh how can we blame Nehru, India was poor when we got Independence in 1947 ?***\n\n**Poverty  is one thing – but having good values is quite another. It is eminently  possible for a person to be poor but yet have good values.** **Unfortunately, India has neither.**\n\nWould you mind if India had continued to be a poor country despite its  best efforts. Or is it fine the kind of bad things and bad habits that we have developed ?  The kind of efforts that we have put in?\n\n***Oh muh Nehru established Democracy ?***\n\n1. It would be like denigrating the other makers of the  Constitution – including **Dr. B.R. Ambedkar**, if the credit for all this  is given to Nehru alone.\n2. Secondly, the  democracy in India was killed in its infancy itself when ignoring the  democratic principles Pandit Nehru was anointed as PM instead of [Sardar Patel](http://www.thenorthlines.com/gandhi-opted-nehru-not-sardar-patel-pm/), in spite of the fact that in 1946, **twelve** provincial Congress committees had nominated Patel for the presidency; and only **three** had nominated Nehru, and thereby Patel could not become PM .\n3. Thirdly,  is forcing a dynasty on a nation promoting democracy? The dynasty rule  is one of the biggest problems created by Nehru for India. (Motilal  Nehru), Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Sanjay Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi,  Sonia Gandhi, Maneka Gandhi, Varun Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, (…wait for more  names in list in coming days…). Is this democracy?\n4. Fourthly,  how many of you are aware that the freedom of speech and expression was  drastically curtailed (from the one that was originally guaranteed  under the Constitution) by the First Amendment to the Constitution  passed in 1951, courtesy Pandit Nehru, our first PM, which drastically  **changed Article 19 of the Constitution**?\n\nSo,  what is your verdict for the worst Prime Minister of India so far. Is there another contender who can match it up to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ?\n\n**Note**:\n\nI haven't included other facts already mentioned in the first post."<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: '970wkb'<br />Score:25<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/970wkb/part_2_is_jawaharlal_nehru_the_worst_prime/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'success culture stereotypes pride'<br />Body: 'Hi,  \n.   I read 8 page paper titled: [The Social Psychology of Success](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247448059_The_Social_Psychology_of_Success). It discusses why giving preference to our culture and taking pride in them is important for us.   \nMain points:  \n* Faults in performance does not always signify lack of skill or ability.  \n* Exposing people to negative stereotypes about groups to which they belong increases anxiety and stress when performing tasks related to that stereotype. e.g. When a woman is told about the stereotype of women being bad at math, she under performs from her usual performance.  \n* While positive stereotypes enhances performance. e.g. When an Asian woman is told about Asians being stereotypically better at math than members of other ethnicity, she performs even better than her usual.   \n* This effect is not only visible in logical reasoning but also in other fields as well. e.g. white person under performs when they are pitted with black opponent in physical games than his usual performance while in strategy games the same white person performs better than his usual self against any black opponent.  \n* Remember we are here comparing one\'s performance with his own average performance.   \n .  \nSo how to overcome negative stereotypes?:   \n1. Individual mobility: Individual level activities that decreases the impact of group on the self. The strategy is to avoid the stereotype. This means "We are inferior, but I am not". Only few could achieve this.     \n2. Social creativity: Redefining the dimension of comparison. The strategy is denial of stereotype. This is saying "We are different". e.g. while comparing with a physicist, psychologist describe himself as more artistic while comparing with dramatics, psychologist would describe himself as more scientific hence altering the dimension of comparison. Here leaders become important.   \n3. Social competition: Group members work together to challenge the legitimacy of stereotypes which defined their group as inferior and replace them with expressions of group pride. The success of such work depends upon the leaders\' capability to create a sense of shared social identity which is based on challenging the negative stereotypes. e.g. Gandhi Ji\'s appeal to reject all value systems such as English language, foreign cloths, British titles which made us a foreigner in our own motherland.   \n\n**Tldr:**   \nNegative and positive stereotypes affects our performance accordingly. We need to overcome negative ones by following way:   \n1. "We are inferior, but I am not": Getting best by himself    \n2. "We are different": Our way is highway   \n3. "We are not inferior": Your way is shit   '<br />Author: 'attack_on_buttock'  id: '96qowy'<br />Score:21<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/96qowy/success_culture_stereotypes_pride/</li>
