Postpaid internet and prepaid voice + internet were non-functional (Note :  both the connections were non-J&amp;K). Landline was functional and lined internet was available.\n\nThe owner of the place we stayed in told us that, although the business suffered losses for about 3 months post the shutdown, things were pretty much normal by early December. He was yet to recoup the losses though. He was also operating a cyber cafe nearby and was making much more money than before with the cyber cafe.\n\nBusiness owners (restaurant owners, souvenir vendors, cab drivers) we talked to suffered heavy losses in the initial months, but transactions were back to what they were before.\n\nMost people seemed to be happy with the abrogation of art. 370.\n\n**Kashmir Division :** \n\nNeither postpaid, nor prepaid voice + internet were functional (Note :  both the connections were non-J&amp;K). Many areas have landlines restored, but they face frequent cuts. Only "certain" areas have lined internet.\n\nA hotel we stayed in had just 3 tourist bookings (this is outside Srinagar) since the shutdown. A lot of migrant workers employed by the hotel industry, usually from UP and Bihar, have left the valley post the shutdown. Most of the hotels we stayed in (outside Kashmir) gave us rooms at about 40 - 50 % of their usual costs, so we ended up saving a lot of money. \n\nTwo handicraft shops near one of our hotels were shutdown for the past 2 months. They depended on online orders from Western countries. I assume this is the case with most export-oriented enterprises.\n\nAnother affected demographic we interacted with were students. They were facing difficulties in downloading study materials and registering for their entrance examinations. A student I interacted with, said he registered for his engineering entrance by calling  an acquaintance from outside the valley and giving his personal and banking details to him, at the risk of being swindled.\n\nWe heard that the health sector is also severely impacted because a lot of their data is locked up in online servers. This is second hand information though. Kashmir has a very severe drug problem, that I didn\'t know of previously.\n\nTo be honest, the administration seems pretty clueless going forward in Kashmir.'<br />Author: 'LichchaviPrincess'  id: 'ehfyl1'<br />Score:28<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ehfyl1/personal_observations_on_the_state_of_jk/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] 2020 Special: Tough time for Imran Khan, the 2020 Olympics, and Operation Diamond'<br />Body: 'Welcome to this year\'s final edition of the Geopolitics Thread! This is the place where we discuss all the happenings from around the world: the discussion does not have to be related to India. For this special edition, I decided to mix it up and cover some of the top stories from 2019 and how they will pan out in 2020. Feel free to start a discussion on other issues as well!\n\n# Top stories from India\'s neighbourhood:\n\n**1. Will Imran Khan survive another year?**\n\n2019 was a tumultuous year for Pakistan both domestically and internationally. Within the country, Prime Minister Imran Khan faced severe protests and criticism for his economic and political policies. On one side, he was arresting all his opponents, while on the other, he was seen as handing the country over to the IMF with a floundering economy. India\'s decision to fully annex Kashmir brought up the gravest crisis for Pakistan in years, and while the country did get a lot of traction in the International media, it got very little support from most governments. In the face of these challenges, and reported tensions between him and the military, will Khan remain PM in 2020?\n\n**2. Will there be a new Iranian revolution?**\n\n2019 was an exceptionally difficult year for Iran. On the one hand, the US started an unprecedented campaign of hard and far-reaching sanctions on the country, going so far as to minimize its valuable oil exports. On the other side, large protests took over the country seeking to overthrow the Islamic dictatorship there. Iran\'s economy shrank by nearly 10% as a result, and the regime made some small steps to close the Straits of Hormuz in retaliation. This could be catastrophic for the world as it create a massive oil crisis. In 2020, will this apocalyptic future come to pass? Or will the Islamic Republic finally meet its end?\n\n**3. Is Bangladesh the new India?**\n\n2019 was a golden year for Bangladesh: the country finally managed to reach some political stability (albeit under an authoritarian PM) and saw rapid economic growth. It became the fastest growing economy in the subcontinent, and its HDI rose to just a shade shy of India and Bhutan (Sri Lanka has the highest HDI in the region). The country\'s exports have been rising, with a corresponding and visible improvement if people\'s lives, especially in the capital city of Dhaka. In 2020, will the country be able to continue its golden run?\n\n# Top stories from the world:\n\n**1. Can an impeached President be re-elected?**\n\nIn 2019, US President Donald Trump became only the third president to have been impeached by the House of Representatives, in the country\'s nearly 300 year-old democracy. While the Senate is yet to consider the charges - and in all likelihood will reject them - it sets up a constitutional crisis as he seeks re-election next year. If Trump manages to win his election, he would become the first US president to be re-elected after being impeached by the House. While the optics of this would be terrible, Trump would be one of the politically weakest Presidents in history. Will Trump win the election and start a new era in American democracy?\n\n**2. Will Brexit finally happen?**\n\nBrexit has absorbed the political strength of three British PMs since that historic referendum, where a narrow majority chose to pull the country out of the EU. The PM who championed that - David Cameron - chickened out and left politics. His successor Theresa May failed multiple times to secure a deal on post-EU relations, while simultaneously struggling to maintain the majority of her coalition government. She stepped down, and the original Brexiteer Boris Johnson became PM. His unconventional approach led to a lot of protests, but now that he has secured a historic majority, will he finally become the last PM of a UK still in the EU?\n\n**3. Will the 2020 Olympics revitalize Japan?**\n\nThe Summer Olympics 2020 will take place in Japan in July-August next year, and may mark a major milestone for the country that is struggling on multiple fronts. Japan\'s population growth declined to a new historic low this year, with the number of new births falling to the lowest ever since records began in 1899. This is even starker considering that the country\'s overall population has tripled since then. At the same time, a rising China, North Korean missile tests, tensions with South Korea, and a US government that is seen to be less than enthusiastic about its military guarantee have all come together to create a crisis. But the Olympics could change that, potentially revitalizing the economy and helping the country turn a new page. Will 2020 prove to be the year that Japan has been looking for?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Geopolitical History: Operation Diamond**\n\nIn 2020, India will be receiving a shipment of Rafale fighter jets from France. Although the first jet came here this year, a larger shipment will tilt the strategic balance in the subcontinent, where the Pakistan Air Force flies more sophisticated, western-made (or Chinese-copied) planes. Indeed, the history of air forces around the world has been intrinsically a history of technology: new, sophisticated platforms have often tilted the balance of power in many theaters. \n\nIn 1966, Israel too faced a crisis with its extremely hostile Arab neighbours. The Soviet Union had produced the Mikoyan-Gurevich (MiG) 21 fighter jet, the most advanced fighter jet of its time in 1959, and Egypt, Syria, and Iraq received several squadrons quickly, putting Israel in grave danger. Both the US and Israel were desperate to understand the aircraft\'s technology and capability, but were hard-pressed to get any information. Israel\'s secret service, named the Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations (Hebrew: *HaMossad leModiʿin uleTafkidim Meyuḥadim*), or simply the Mossad ("the Institute"), under its chief Meir Amit, had been tasked with an unprecedented operation: to "kidnap" a MiG-21 and bring it to Israel. \n\nAlthough it sounds ludicrous to "kidnap" a fighter jet, that too from a hostile country, the Mossad took up the challenge and launched Operation Diamond. In 1964, a secret Jewish agent in the Shah\'s Iran (Israel\'s main ally in the region) contacted the Mossad and told them about Munir Redfa, an Iraqi pilot that was angry at Saddam Hussein\'s Iraq, which openly discriminated against Christians (like Redfa) and other non-Muslims. The Mossad jumped at the opportunity and sent a female secret agent to befriend Redfa. And befriend she did: he spilled his heart out, and told her of the discrimination he faced for his faith, the fact that he had to live far away from his family, and was forced to fire upon innocent civilians in Saddam\'s horrific attacks on his own people. After a series of meetings in Europe, he was offered $1 million dollars and Israeli citizenship for his family in return for him bringing the MiG-21 that he flew to Israel. \n\nRedfa agreed. His wife and children were brought to Israel via Paris, while the rest of his family was brought to Iran by Mossad agents in Iraq, from where they were safely taken to Israel. On August 16, 1966, Redfa deviated from his flight path and flew over Northern Jordan. Although Jordanian authorities noticed the intruder, they contacted Syrian authorities about it, who simply assumed it was once of their own MiG-21\'s on a training mission (possibly misled by false information fed by the Mossad). On very low fuel, Redfa finally entered Israeli air space and was escorted by the IDF\'s Mirage jets\\*. On his landing, herevealed his daring move to the world in a press conference. The Mossad had done the unthinkable!\n\nOver the next year, Israel analyzed their captured MiG-21 and trained with it. This paid off quickly: in April 1967, barely a few months after the capture, Israel show down six MiG-21\'s operated by Syria without a single loss. In 1968, Israel loaned the MiG-21 to the US, which helped them neutralize the air superiority of the Soviet Union. In return, Israel was allowed to purchase the F-4 Phantom, and since then, the IDF has virtually been the king of the skies of the Middle East.\n\n\\*Interestingly, the Indian Air Force has operated both MiG\'s and Mirage\'s!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat stories do you think will change the world in 2020?'<br />Author: 'icecoolsushobhan'  id: 'ehc9hg'<br />Score:40<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ehc9hg/biweekly_geopolitics_thread_2020_special_tough/</li>

What does one make of this doublespeak)?”\n\n“Under CAA, you are going to provide documents to those coming from outside, but under the NRC you are asking documents from everyone here. What for?” asks Mohammed Rizwan, a scrapdealer in his mid-30s, as others around him nod, at Manna Mazra.\n\n\\- While praising the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana for benefiting Hindus and Muslims alike, Asgar Abbas of Sirsi in Sambhal district says the goodwill is depleting. “Whom to believe? Which documents do they need? 1970 or 1989?” asks Abbas.\n\nSirsi is about 10 km from Sambhal, where two protestors were killed during recent clashes with police.\n\nA worried Mumtaz Jahan of Karula-Sir Syed Nagar in Moradabad says their area saw a peaceful protest recently. “How do we get documents of our ancestors? Where will I go searching when I have lived here on rent for decades now?” he says.\n\n\\- Masarat Alarm, a daily wager in his 30s at Sirsi, says he hasn’t got work in 15 days. “Those who have land can get documents. What about labourers like us?” he adds.\n\nRaees Ahmed, a labourer at a woodwork shop near Karula-Sir Syed Nagar, admits he doesn’t know the exact details about CAA, adding, “Charcha kahe ki, kharcha nikalna mushkil ho raha hai (We don’t have time for all this, we can barely make ends meet).”\n\n\\- Mehboob Ahmed of Amehda asks if BJP governments anywhere else — citing the Jat, Patel and Maratha protests (in Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra, respectively) — had similarly sought dues from protesters.\n\nFor now, the anger is restricted to the government and has not become communal. “Yeh masla Hindu aur Muslim ke beech ka nahin hai. Yeh masla prashashan ke khilaf hai (This is not an issue of Hindus and Muslims. It’s an issue with the government),” says Hanif, a mason in his mid-50s, at Saifkhan Sarai in Sambhal.\n\n“We want Hindu-Muslim peace and amity,” adds a labourer, Riasat, in Islamnagar locality of Milak in Rampur district.\n\n[https://indianexpress.com/article/india/trust-the-pm-or-hm-sabka-vishwas-tested-on-the-ground-in-west-up-6189438/](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/trust-the-pm-or-hm-sabka-vishwas-tested-on-the-ground-in-west-up-6189438/)'<br />Author: 'Lister971191'  id: 'eh0j22'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eh0j22/trust_the_pm_or_hm_sabka_vishwas_tested_on_the/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Congress Supreme Court Lawyer Kapil Sibal : "Even if the law(CAA) passes the test of legality, it may still be repressive, can target communities"'<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](rp9iwggglh741)\n\n**Summary of the Opinion Pace by Kapil Sibal :**\n\n\\-  Bhakts then contend that this was part of the [BJP](https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/)’s manifesto, and having won by a bigger margin in 2019, the legislation is no more than honouring its commitment to the people. Again, the argument is a non-starter. A commitment cannot be clothed with legality merely because a majoritarian government got it passed in Parliament. Even if the law passes the test of legality, it may still be repressive, can instil fear and target communities. \n\n\\-  They only seek to clear the way for members of certain persecuted communities, including Hindus, to be conferred the status of citizens, even if they have illegally entered India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The assumption is that they illegally entered India because they were persecuted in these Islamic countries whereas Muslims who entered India without papers were mere illegal migrants.  \n\n\\-  There are serious fallacies in this argument. First, one wonders how the government knows of the individual intentions of all non-Muslim illegal immigrants. Two, none of them have claimed at the time that they entered India illegally that they were being persecuted. Nor have they made any such claim thereafter to any authority in India. One wonders how the BJP, and that too in 2019, came to the conclusion that all non-Muslims namely Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Jains and Parsis were all persecuted when they illegally entered India. \n\n\\-  In the 2019 election manifesto, the BJP mentioned the problem of illegal immigration (not “refugees”) in the Northeast and committed to address that problem by initiating a [National Register of Citizens](https://indianexpress.com/about/nrc/) ([NRC](https://indianexpress.com/about/nrc/)) in Assam, to be expanded in phases to the rest of India. In it, the BJP also committed to enact a [Citizenship Amendment Bill](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/citizenship-amendment-bill-2019-parliament-winter-session-nrc-6122846/) for the protection of individuals of religious minority communities from neighbouring countries escaping persecution and to also clear the apprehensions of those living in Assam who had agitated against all (whether “Hindu or Muslim”) illegal migrants’ entry into the state which threatened to destabilise their socio-cultural identity. There was no mention of limiting this exercise to Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. \n\n \\- The answer perhaps lies in the fact that lakhs of Hindus were excluded from the NRC in Assam. An attempt was made, first in the Supreme Court, to reject the exercise and carry out a review. That did not work. For the BJP, to allow such exclusion of Hindus to continue, would have been politically suicidal. The only way out was to initiate the CAB to declare all illegal immigrants, other than Muslims, as having been persecuted in the three named Islamic countries through a legislative presumption.\n\n\\- If this is allowed, the next step is an NRC exercise in the rest of the country designed to deny all Muslims with no documents the status of citizens. Others who also have no papers will be presumed to have been persecuted, and will therefore be granted the status of citizens.\n\n\\- This demonic political agenda must not succeed. If it does, our body politic will have been amputated and our Republic scarred. Those rejected will lose their homeland, and we, our brothers and sisters. A partition of exclusion is in the offing. If it happens, the outcome is anybody’s guess.'<br />Author: 'Lister971191'  id: 'eh0g0l'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eh0g0l/congress_supreme_court_lawyer_kapil_sibal_even_if/</li>

But since they affected GDP estimates beginning in 2011-12, the revised numbers spanned the period of both governments.1 The non-partisan nature of the exercise is suggested by the fact that the new estimates bumped up significantly the growth numbers for 2013-14, the last year of the UPA-2 government."'<br />Author: 'McNulty__'  id: 'egsbjc'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/egsbjc/they_have_changed_the_way_gdp_is_calculated_rg/</li>

Such spending can immediately spur demand, which in turn would create inducement for potential investors.\n\n\\- The government can garner enough resources for financing the above-mentioned initiatives by realising the undisputed part of tax and non-tax arrears, which, at the end of 2017-18, were around Rs 9 lakh crore and Rs 2 lakh crores respectively.\n\n\\- It could also monetise the huge chunk of surplus land available with the Ministries of Defence and Railways, which was one of the recommendations of the Thirteenth Finance Commission.\n\n\\- Over the medium-term, efforts must be made to increase the tax-GDP ratio, which is the lowest among major economies, by levying wealth tax, among others.\n\n\\-Besides, the GST must be reviewed and redesigned through reduction in the number of tax rates and increasing the base, and by improving the GST Network that the indirect tax system needs in order to be effective.\n\n[https://thewire.in/economy/facing-the-reality-how-can-modi-reverse-the-current-economic-slowdown](https://thewire.in/economy/facing-the-reality-how-can-modi-reverse-the-current-economic-slowdown)'<br />Author: 'Lister971191'  id: 'egreb7'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/egreb7/facing_the_reality_how_can_modi_reverse_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Humane Side of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).'<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Humane Side of Citizenship Amendment Bill \\(CAB\\), now in force as Citizenship Amendment Act CAA\\).](https://preview.redd.it/gksetjpy5d741.png?width=674&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=706c06796a1fd128d6017436da87dafbfab319d9)\n\n The Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2019 (CAB) is being widely discussed as it has been passed in the Parliament. It decides the fate of refugees from neighbouring Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.\n\nHere are some stories of refugees who can be beneficiaries of the CAB and who consider India as their motherland to seek refuge in.\n\n### Fear of forced conversion\n\nThe two sisters Sahiba and Rabeli from Karachi came to India along with their husbands and children in 2013 to the National Capital Region.\n\nSpeaking about the life before coming to India, Sahiba [says](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/blink/know/the-long-wait-to-be-called-indian/article29981354.ece), “Life was tough for women and girls in Pakistan. Grown-up girls and young women would get picked up, sexually assaulted or be forced to convert to Islam, and we could do nothing about it. We lived in fear and therefore decided to move to India.”\n\nSince coming to India, they live in transit camps Bhatti Mines Sanjay Colony settlement, on the fringes of the Delhi-Haryana border.\n\nOthers like Kiran lament that refugees face identity crisis thought they consider India as their homeland – “people here refer to us as Pakistanis.”\n\n### Cannot openly utter Jai Shri Ram\n\nBalram from Sindh in Pakistan greets his friends, saying, ‘Jai Shri Ram’. \xa0He [tells](https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pakistani-hindus-hindu-refugees-from-sindh-refugees-in-india-forced-conversions-abduction-flesh-trade-social-discrimination-poverty-oppression-temples-babri-mosque-demolition-balakot-imran-khan-narendra-modi/story/1/30221.html), “In Sindh, we couldn’t openly say these three words. All festivals, from Diwali\xa0to Holi, were celebrated indoors. Every second day, police would pick us up, lock us up and start beating us up\xa0without any reason.”\n\n### Fear of abduction of Hindu girls\n\nForced conversion\xa0is nothing new in Paksitan. “The fear of Hindu girls being abducted in Pakistan is so much that we never stepped out alone in that country,” [says](https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pakistani-hindus-hindu-refugees-from-sindh-refugees-in-india-forced-conversions-abduction-flesh-trade-social-discrimination-poverty-oppression-temples-babri-mosque-demolition-balakot-imran-khan-narendra-modi/story/1/30221.html) Geeta Devi.\n\n### Islamic teaching in schools\n\nJamna [said](https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pakistani-hindus-hindu-refugees-from-sindh-refugees-in-india-forced-conversions-abduction-flesh-trade-social-discrimination-poverty-oppression-temples-babri-mosque-demolition-balakot-imran-khan-narendra-modi/story/1/30221.html), ‘How could we send our kids to school knowing that Islamic teaching is being given to them? There were no jobs for our kids —\xa0the first thing that\xa0anyone asked us was, what’s your religion? The moment they came to know we are Hindus, they would turn their backs on us. So, we survived on farm produce. We led\xa0lives worse\xa0than a dog in Pakistan.”\n\n### Kept captive while escaping East Pakistan\n\nSupporting the bill Ranojay [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Ranojay4/status/1204472709591101440?s=20), “People opposing CAB are in favour of forced conversions and islamo-fascism. While trying to escape East-Pakistan three of my mother’s cousin sisters were intercepted and kept captives and their father was hacked to death. Thank you u/narendramodi ji for initiating Justice.”\n\n### Opposing CAB is anti-dalit\n\nAnother twitter user Divya Kumar Soti twitted that Pakistan did not allow the Dalits. Quoting Dhulipal, Creating a new Medina he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/DivyaSoti/status/1204379857502625793?s=20) “During partition, Pakistan did not allow Dalits to leave for India. Pak PM Liaqat Ali told Indian High Commissioner “who would clean streets and latrines of Karachi if they are allowed to leave?”\xa0 Most Hindu refugees coming from Pak are Dalits. Those opposing CAB are anti-Dalit.”\n\n### Admission denied in government schools\n\n“We have to get water from the nearby Madrasa, our children do not get admission in government schools and we cannot afford private schools,” [says](https://hinduexistence.org/2015/02/28/is-govt-of-india-helping-pakistan-and-bangladesh-for-their-programme-of-hindu-cleansing-from-those-countries/) a fresh migrant who came to Rajasthan with his family. He did not wish to be identified for fear of persecution of his family back in Karachi.\n\n### Why discriminate against Bengali Hindu refugees\n\nSubhas Chakroborty is leader of\xa0Nikhil Banga Nagarik Sangha, an organisation working for\xa0Bangladeshi Hindu refugees. He [says](https://hinduexistence.org/2015/02/28/is-govt-of-india-helping-pakistan-and-bangladesh-for-their-programme-of-hindu-cleansing-from-those-countries/), “Hindus of Bangladesh have lost everything and are being victimized by both the\xa0BNP and Awami League\xa0in their respective ruling. Hindus are still leaving their motherland in Bangladesh every day and coming to India in a very hapless and helpless condition. This is a big problem in India. This should not be overlooked or discriminated. While\xa0[Sindhi](http://www.hindustantimes.com/indore/20-000-pak-sindhis-may-get-citizenship-long-term-visas/article1-1309650.aspx)\xa0or\xa0[Tibetans](http://www.tibetanpoliticalreview.org/articles/tibetansinindiathecaseforcitizenship)\xa0are getting easy help from GOI, then why so hardship for the Bengali speaking Hindu migrants from Bangladesh?”\n\n### Hardships due to absence of refugee specific citizenship law in India\n\nAbsence of law to govern citizenship for immigrants seeking refuge due to religious persecution caused hardships to the refugees.\n\nKhem Singh, a Hindu refugee from Pakistan living in Jodhpur district of Rajasthan [says](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jodhpur/not-a-happy-homecoming-for-pak-hindus/articleshow/66715819.cms) “Our children don’t have any options after Class V. We can’t get our caste certificates and aren’t eligible for financial assistance for construction of toilets.”\n\nHindu Singh Sodha is a Human Rights Activist who works to\xa0establish the rights of Pakistani Hindus to live in India. Once a migrant from Pakistan, he is now Indian citizen. He [says](https://hinduexistence.org/2015/02/28/is-govt-of-india-helping-pakistan-and-bangladesh-for-their-programme-of-hindu-cleansing-from-those-countries/), “Many people also return because the living conditions are so bad here, but the inflow of people still continues. Government agencies often cite security reasons for grant of citizenship, though most of us were citizens of undivided India; they can at least give us refugee status.”\n\nJaswant Kaur fled from Afghanistan after losing two of her sons in insurgency-related violence. She is one of the Hindus and Sikhs who [escaped persecution in Afghanistan](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/1SgfOPNmwOQqU5QIFxTvuI/Citizenship-bill-glimmer-of-hope-for-Hindu-Sikh-refugees-fr.html) to find safety in India, but are without citizenship. Rife with complicated procedures, red-tapism she has to run office to office to complete requirements. It is a big challenge for the woman in her early sixties with all-women household.\n\nThe CAB will speed up the process to converting the refugees to Indian citizens. The persecuted minorities facing injustice in own country can come to the motherland India, which has embraced such people over unknown number of generations.\n\n###'<br />Author: 'Lister971191'  id: 'egq0tu'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/egq0tu/the_humane_side_of_citizenship_amendment_act_caa/</li>

It's only recently that an alternate definition has been pushed, claiming nationalism =/= patriotism.

We\'re talking about the first one, This is the one being defiled.\n\nOxford Concise English dictionary, First Edition (1911). This is before the rise of Nazism.\n\n&gt; Nationalism:\n&gt; 1. Patriotic feeling, principles, or efforts\n&gt; 2. Policy of national independence.\n\nThis definition remained unchanged for the next 65 years.

Patriotic feeling, principles, or efforts\n&gt; 2. Policy of national independence.\n\nBut then notice how a variant of the first meaning emerged. Who propagated this variant into common usage and why? It must\'ve taken much energy and time.\n\nOxford Concise English dictionary, Ninth Edition (1995):\n\n&gt; Nationalism:\n&gt; 1.\n&gt;     a. Patriotic feeling, principles, etc.\n&gt;     b. An extreme form of this; chauvinism.\n&gt; 2. A policy of national independence.\n\nBut they weren\'t done yet. Chauvinism (which is aggressive patriotism, but still only patriotism) wasn\'t enough. Notice how the notion of superiority is now slipped in. \n\nOxford Concise English dictionary, Eleventh Edition (2004):\n\n&gt; Nationalism:\n&gt; 1.\n&gt;     a. Patriotic feeling, principles, or efforts\n&gt;     b. An extreme form of this marked by a feeling of superiority over other countries.\n&gt; 2. Advocacy of political independence for a particular country.\n\nA word which used to mean something positive now has a variant negative meaning. Now add in propoganda that nationalism =/= patriotism. In time people forget the positive variant. The usage of nationalism becomes something taboo and the people using are made to feel shame. \n\nBut note when this happens the second meaning ( "A policy of independence for a country" ) is also lost because there is no alternative word for it (and only a wordy description). Is there is a political motivation behind this? As we know leftists like to oppose nationalism politically, because it gets in the way of super-national governments and globalization (which tends to homogenize culture and languages).\n\nScreenshots here: https://imgur.com/a/PKMAojo'<br />Author: 'Jacked_to_the_source'  id: 'egp7er'<br />Score:38<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/egp7er/nationalism_used_to_mean_patriotism_even_when/</li>

Those who have served with him or have spoken to him know that he is a quintessential Army man; a stickler for rules and the best traditions of the Army.](https://preview.redd.it/2v2on7cpia741.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7533a5de4bb30b57565634915a9fb077b090cdd)\n\nThe awe and respect for him in the armed forces as a whole grew tremendously in 2017, when he was the General Officer Commanding (GOC) in Delhi. He refused to entertain the Special Protection Group’s request of not standing behind Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech the ramparts of the Red Fort. Traditionally, the GoC always stands behind the PM on this occasion, and Naravane refused to stand down. There were murmurs in the corridors of power at the time that he had sought a written order.\n\nWhen asked, a top officer who is still serving, said it was a request from the Prime Minister’s Office and, after proper discussion in the Ministry of Defence and communication from the Army chief, Lt Gen. Naravane did not stand behind PM Modi. It was said that there were no written protocols; just a practice followed over the years.\n\nAfter escorting Modi to the dais, Lt Gen. Naravane returned to his seat in the audience and, at the end of the speech, got up to escort him.\n\nHis refusal to stand down earned him many admirers within the force and outside.'<br />Author: 'Lister971191'  id: 'egl8r4'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/egl8r4/how_army_chiefdesignate_lt_gen_naravane_earned/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Does Citizenship Amendment Act violate Article 14 of the Indian Constitution'<br />Body: ' Article 14 provides that state shall not deny to any person equality before the law and equal protection of laws within the territory of India.\n\nThe article does not provide for absolute mathematical equality but allows equal treatment to equals and reasonable classification for the purpose of lawmaking.\n\nSupreme Court in Clarence Pais v. Union of India held that ‘Historical reasons may justify differential treatment of separate geographical regions provided it bears a reason and just relation to the matter in respect of which differential treatment is accorded.’\n\nSo legislation will not be violative of Article 14 merely because it makes a differentiation between various geographical regions. Such legislation is valid and constitutionally sound if there are historical reasons for such differentiation and there is a just relation between the reason and the matter in respect of which differentiation is made.\n\nThe CAA creates a class of persons belonging to certain religions that are in minority in 3 countries. So there is differentiation on a geographical basis and there is a historic justification of such differentiation and also there is a clear Nexus between this justification and the matter for which differentiation is accorded. Let’s go step by step,\n\nThe class is of people who are Hindus, Jains, Parsis, Buddhists, Christians and who have come to India from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh. This class is of people\n\n1) belonging to minorities\n\n2) coming to India on or before 31 Dec 2014\n\n3) persecuted in their country on the basis of religion\n\n4) Coming from the countries that have a specific official state religion and that share borders with India.\n\nSo the class is well defined. The matter in respect of which the classification is made is giving citizenship of India.\n\nThe historic justification is the factum of partition on religious grounds and this subcontinent having ben one nation once. The Nexus is clear, the injustice suffered by people having their roots in India due to partition and the promise made to keep our doors open. This, CAA is very much in consonance with the Idea of India, the idea of humanity and the idea of Justice to our people. \n\nsource: [https://www.opindia.com/2019/12/fact-check-citizenship-amendment-act-caa-article-14-violation/](https://www.opindia.com/2019/12/fact-check-citizenship-amendment-act-caa-article-14-violation/)'<br />Author: 'Iyerboi'  id: 'eg1bxd'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eg1bxd/does_citizenship_amendment_act_violate_article_14/</li>

Good but was this the time to do it, right after A370, right after Ayodhya, right after Triple Talaq and whilst people are aggrieved with the economy? No. \n\nI\'m not sure who pushed for it to be done now, Shah maybe, but it was utterly stupid and the fact that the police response was overly brutal is indicative of that. \n\nNRC nationwide is stupid, resource draining, an absolute mess in a disgustingly inefficient bureaucracy is sheer stupidity, especially with so many folk illiterate. \n\nIn 10 year\'s time it is the right thing to do with there is a better infrastructure and bureaucracy in place, a better and more efficient system in place but it is ludicrous to do now. \n\nSay what you want, but I don\'t care, the PEACEFUL protests with regards to NRC (and not CAB) are entirely correct. And CAB itself is bizarre, why say "Hindus, Sikhs, Christians etc."? Just say "persecuted religious minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan" it would have had the EXACT same effect but no Muzzas and Liberals chimping out. I don\'t understand why they didn\'t do that other than (a) malice, they wanted to cause riots or (b) they were stupid. \n\n2) Shah is out of his depth. He doesn\'t know what he\'s doing, I don\'t know who he thinks he is with talk of "throwing out/crushing termites" but it is completely unnecessary language. Only a fucking idiot would follow NRC right after CAB right after Ayodhya/Triple Talaq/A370 AND an economy in recovery. How out of touch do you have to be? \n\nAlso, it\'s been nearly 5 months Kashmir has had no internet, it is bizarre. Don\'t get me wrong, I don\'t particularly like them, but 5 months is too much. They\'ve seen the protests/riots in the rest of India and watch how they engage in it themselves, they are going to protest/riot too as soon as the Internet is back on. It is going to cause issues. \n\n3) IMO, BJP were too over-confident but they are now bleeding and we are going to see a cascade effect. \n\nLost Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and am certain they\'ll lose Delhi and Bihar next year too. The vultures are circling and the shark sniffs the blood in the water, they\'re out for the BJP + Modi &amp; Shah. \n\nBJP will be punished, especially for the economy, mark my words. I want go as far as sullying Modi, I still respect him, but I think Shah is engaging in serious powerplay here and sullying him, big time. My biggest fear is that we\'ll find out this term that Modi is also out of his depth. I still have faith in him but let\'s see over the next 6-12 months. \n\nAlso, I\'ve never seen the international media cover India like they have and with such frequency. I don\'t think people realise but India is a pretty important country now and geopolitically relevant, it would be sensible if it didn\'t shit on minorities (via NRC) or clamp down on liberties (internet shutdowns and police brutality). \n\n4) The economy, I\'ll reserve judgement till the budget but I don\'t think the Government know how to fix it. I\'m hearing of no major reforms whatsoever and am just hearing of a income tax cut (which is good on the demand side but for the short-term to medium term only). The RCEP retreat and lack of a US-India FTA package despite being announced months ago, primarily due to shitty negotiators IMO, is an indicator of Modi\'s protectionist measures. \n\nLet\'s face it, he\'s a socialist and a protectionist at heart unfortunately. Good thing is is that the BJP will be punished by the electorate, as has been seen in the State elections. However, the Government is listening, I must give them credit for that. \n\nIf I were the Government over the next 24 months, I\'d COMPLETELY forget about NRC and UCC (save that till 2022/2023 when economy is significantly better). After UCC, there\'s nothing else to cover and even then, one can\'t be attacked for literally a fucking secular civic code. Hope CAA dissent dies down over the next few months, lay fucking low and don\'t push anymore fucking buttons like fucking idiots (if they touch NRC or UCC in the next 6 months, I hope they get fucked).\n\nFocus on the economy. \n\nSimplify taxes, stop fucking around with the system and regulations (especially after folk have invested), engage in labour reforms, let the fiscal deficit slide, cut income tax to help boost consumption, pump money into stalled infrastructure projects as well as MGNREGA and privatise aggressively to raise funds.

He told that cook is not coming and had gone to village due to injury.\n\nI waited again and contacted his wife since he was not reachable. She kept telling he would come in some time.

How should I get back my money in that case? Should I do police complaint? I was also thinking I could ask my ex-flatmate to tell him to give money saying he has paid some due to me and cook can pay him since cook had to give me money. But not sure how does that sound.

      <li>Title::: '[Main Thread] : Union Cabinet has given approval to the National Population Register (NPR)'<br />Body: 'Amid the furore over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the Union Cabinet on Tuesday approved funds to the tune of over Rs 8,500 crore for updating the National Population Register (NPR), officials have said.\nThe NPR exercise is to commence from April next year. The NPR is a list of "usual residents" of the country. Updating of this data was done during 2015 by conducting door-to-door survey. The digitisation of the updated information has been completed.\nNow it has been decided to update the National Population Register along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021 from April to September 2020 in all the states/union territories, except Assam.\n\n* What is NPR?\n\n&gt;The National Population Register (NPR) is a register of usual residents of the country being prepared at the local (village/sub-town), sub-district, district, state and national level under provisions of the Citizenship Act 1955 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. It is mandatory for every usual resident of India to register in the NPR. Under the NPR, a usual resident is defined as a person who has resided in a local area for the past six months or more or a person who intends to reside in that area for the next six months or more.\n\n* What is its purpose?\n\n&gt;NPR\'s purpose is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country. The database would contain demographic as well as biometric particulars. Aadhaar, mobile number, PAN, driving license, voter ID details and Indian passport numbers are among the details that will be collected from all usual residents of India. Sharing of Aadhaar is voluntary in view of the Supreme Court ruling in this regard.\n\n* What are the demographic details required?\n\n&gt;Name of person Relationship to head of household, Father’s name, Mother’s name, Spouse’s name (if married), Sex, Date of Birth, Marital status, Place of birth, Nationality (as declared), Present address of usual residence, Duration of stay at present address, Permanent residential address, Occupation/Activity, Educational qualification.\n\n* What is the current status?\n\n&gt;Data for NPR was collected in 2010 during collection of data for Census of India 2011. It was updated in 2015 through a door-to-door survey. The digitisation of the updated information has been completed. NPR data will now be updated along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021 from April-September 2020 in all states except Assam. A gazette notification to this effect has already been published by the central government.\n\n* Which states have blocked NPR?\n\n&gt;The West Bengal government this month stayed all activities related to the preparation and updation of NPR. The decision came amid violent protests in parts of the state over CAA and chief minister Mamata Banerjee reiterating that the law and the proposed pan-India NRC will not be implemented in the state. Mamata Banerjee said, "All activities regarding the preparation and updation of the National Population Register are stayed in West Bengal. No activity regarding NRP may be taken up without clearance from the government of West Bengal." Kerala and Rajasthan have followed suit, saying they will not work on compiling the NPR as mandated by the Centre to record \'basic information\' on citizens. "After considering the concerns raised in the wake of the 2019 amendment in the Citizenship Act, the state government has decided not to cooperate with the process to update the NPR to facilitate the preparation of the NRC," the office of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a statement last week.\n\n* Why is Assam excluded?\n\n&gt;As of now, the NPR exercise is not being undertaken in Assam. Assam recently had the NRC exercise undertaken to identify and detain illegal immigrants. The purpose of a pan-India NRC it to detect illegal immigrants and detain them, irrespective of faith, however there are concerns it could arbitrarily exclude genuine Indian citizens.\n\n\n* How can NPR data be accessed\n\n&gt;NPR data will not be put in the public domain but will remain a secure database accessible to the relevant user through password protected protocols. The government says it will use the data to enhance the targeting of beneficiary-oriented schemes and will have implications on improving internal security.\n\nSources: \n\n[Livemint: NPR vs NRC: All you need to know about the National Population Register](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/npr-vs-nrc-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-national-population-register-11577186091362.html)'<br />Author: 'yogi_adityanath123'  id: 'ef10j0'<br />Score:52<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ef10j0/main_thread_union_cabinet_has_given_approval_to/</li>

But, this is fucking amazing to watch people in this group will be the most amazing people you\'ll ever meet. I think there are a lot of variables into play but the root thing is mindset. We need to realise there is nothing wrong with the government and nothing wrong with the opposition. The parties and the government are a reflection of the masses.

      <li>Title::: 'Why is the Citizenship Amendment Bill opposed?'<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yo70xnt0n8641.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=997ba4fd7c45c10d7a2e34e533f267b11a467a98\n\nI am going to be frank and forthright in expressing my opinion here.\n\nGood-hearted  Muslims may get angry with me and protest saying, "We are never like  this". But having observed the Indian political scenario for the past 45  years and learning the history of the globe, I have one clear  understanding and it is this:\n\nFor  most of the Muslims across the world, their top-most loyalty is towards  their religion. Next comes their Islamic clan. Next, probably, to their  mother tongue and lastly to their nation, if they are a minority in  that nation.\n\nMost  of the Muslims, by nature and constitution, are extremely emotional and  sentimental. It is their inborn nature to react with a volatile  temperament to any (even mildly) controversial issue; instead of going  really deeper into the issue and reasoning out with facts, they would  instantly react emotionally with half-baked information and  understanding and flare up.\n\nIt  is extremely easy to incite them saying "there is something dangerous  to you, your religion and sect". You can find a similarity to this  temperament in Tamil Nadu, where common Tamil folks too mostly fit into  this mold -- they can be easily incited by saying "There is something  dangerous to Tamil language and Tamil clan".\n\nFor  an average Muslim, the fate of a non-Islamic common man driven out of  Pakistan or Bangladesh deprived of their fundamental rights is a  virtually non-issue. But a fellow Muslim from Bangladesh or a Muslim  Rohingya infiltrator getting denied of his livelihood in India is an  issue of great concern.\n\nThere  is no doubt there are indeed Muslims who don\'t fit into this mold. Many  Muslims as individuals are extremely humane, friendly, empathic and  move with Hindus without overt religious biases. I too had very good  Islamic friends during my college days who were real gems as far as  friendship is concerned.\n\nBut  as a mob or a group or a clan, even the-fundamentally-nice and friendly  Muslim turns out to be different. Even if he is a very logical person  who can reason out well, he invariably opts to keep silent and side with  the mob, giving his mute, overt or covert support to the Islamic-cause.\n\nIf  there is something presumably detrimental to a Hindu cause, you will  find at least 1 in 100 Hindus rejecting the idea, propagating secularism  with full throat and siding with the opposite side vocally and  vociferously. But amid Muslims, even if there were to be a sane voice it  would at the best be 1 in 25000! That is the glaring difference!\n\nNow coming to the question.\n\nThere  is no doubt that it is Congress and other pseudo-secular parties, who  have faced their worst political drubbing in the recent past along with  islamic religious / political outfits with fundamentalist ideas are the  ones orchestering and inciting the present violent protest against CAA.\n\nWhile  it is extremely obvious that there is nothing whatsoever detrimental to  the legitimate Muslim citizens of India in CAA, these anti-national  parties and outfits spread a propaganda as if the Muslim Citizens of  India too will face the threat of getting driven out of India through  CAA and the forthcoming NRC. This is how they have succeeded in inciting  mob violence across India.\n\n**But I also see another hidden cause behind this mob violence and protests.**\n\nIt  is the pent up anger of the volatile Muslim radicals who have been  licking the wounds of Ayodhya Verdict of the Supreme court!\n\nAt  the eve of Ayodhya verdict and also after, the Central and state  Governments took extremely strong precautionary measures to prevent any  eruption of mob violence. Unfortunately, this time, the Governments were  not so well prepared for such an eventuality upon CAB and CAA.\n\nEven  though it was the highest court of this land that gave a historic  landmark judgement on Ayodhya issue which favoured the Hindu standpoint,  many Muslims, true to their inborn nature, could not digest the outcome  of the case. True to their mindset, they took it as if it was an  affront on their religion. But unfortunately for them, they could not  flare up and create a huge social disturbance on account of the  precautionary security steps taken firmly by the Government.\n\nCongress  and other Islamic religious outfits were just waiting with frustration  for an emotional outlet for their pent up anger. They were loathing for a  trigger to release the fires of anger and incite the gullible and  emotional mob for a grand reaction against the BJP Government.\n\nThanks to CAA, they made use of it as the right and most appropriate opportunity to set the nation on fire.'<br />Author: 'MINOSHI__'  id: 'ee98wh'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ee98wh/why_is_the_citizenship_amendment_bill_opposed/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'What is Hindutva? The real idealogy of Hindutva coined by Veer Savarkar and how it is misrepresented today for political gains.'<br />Body: 'Hindutva is a combination of two words, "Hindu" and "Tatva" which literally means the quality of being Hindu or Hinduness. Saying Hinduism and Hindutva is different is like saying humans and humanity is different. The concept of Hindutva is largely misrepresented by the liberal left-wing and is portrayed as a radical and intolerant political ideology. The motive behind this was simple. To turn more and more Hindus away from Hinduism, which in turn serves their own political agenda of empowering Muslims and weaking the morale of Hindus over time, allowing India to be taken over by Islam. A civilization comes to an end when people stop celebrating it. The sense of pride is what keeps us rooted to our culture and is a daily reminder of its deep connection with us. To strip the pride of the Hindus, through spreading anti-hindutva propaganda is what is at work here. These are all efforts to counter Hindu nationalism and hence, Veer Vinayak Damodar Savarkar is demonized by the left-wing. It is high time to know the right from wrong and not allow ourselves to be misled by the falsity of today\'s media. As Veer Savarkar said — "Hindutva is not a word but a history. Not only the spiritual or religious history of our people as at times it is mistaken to be by being confounded with the other cognate term Hinduism, but a history in full. Hinduism is only a derivative, a fraction, a part of Hindutva. Hindutva embraces all the departments of thought and activity of the whole being of our Hindu race."\n\nTo promote the correct idealogy of Hindutva, as opposed to the misinformation spread to cause hatred by others, and to promote the sentiments of Hindu nationalism, we have created a subreddit dedicated to this very purpose.\n\nJoin and be a part of HindutvaRises.\n\nJai Hind.

Examples are Judaism, Sikhism, Shintoism and Hinduism\n\nGlobalized religion - Has missionaries and isn't practiced by just one group of people. Examples are Christianity, Islam and Buddhism. \n\nHinduism has some globalized tendencies, if you take into account the Hare Krsna movement or the way some spiritual forms of yoga get propagated the world over. But then again, as the statistic shows, 94% of Hindus are Indians. \n\n**I suspect that over the recent years, it has become harder for non-Indians who are interested in Hinduism, to feel connected with the Hindu faith;** the primary reason for that is the localizing forces that are happening in India. That is the problem with localization or nationalization, you disconnect yourself from the world, and in the process, make your beliefs less welcoming towards foreigners. On the flip side, further localization of Hinduism gives India a very unique and recognizable identity in the world. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'ee7ugz'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ee7ugz/hinduism_is_becoming_ever_more_localized_is_that/</li>

There is a common thread in these 2 protests, which may add an interesting perspective to the protests in India.\n\nHong Kong protests were triggered by a proposed extradition bill which would have allowed HK citizens to be extradited to mainland China to be tried in their courts, instead of HK courts. The bill was in response to a minor criminal case, wherein an HK citizen could not be tried in mainland for crimes committed there. Despite starting from this limited issue, the protests soon became about the larger question of HK's autonomy and Chinese government's repeated attacks on the autonomy. Similarly, protests in Lebanon were triggered because of a proposed tax on whatsapp calls, and yet they soon morphed into protests about the mishandling of the Lebanese economy by the government.\n\nThe distinctive pattern is clear - there were tensions and resentments among the people, but they were under the surface. A related move by the government triggered protests, which provided an outlet for all the built up tensions and resentments. Soon, the protest became about something much bigger than what triggered it - protecting sovereign, democratic institutions in the case of HK, and questioning government on the state and plight of the economy in Lebanon.\n\nIf you look closely at the protests in India, you start to notice a similar pattern. The trigger is of course the CAA and proposed NRC, which threaten the constitutional principle of secularism. But resentment about this government's attacks on constitutional values and institutions has been building up for years - SC judges came out in protests first time in the history of India, autonomous institutions like election commission and RBI have been weakened and hijacked, Universities have been attacked, their autonomy snatched, financing cut, ideological appointments made.\n\nEconomic mismanagement is another issue which has created widespread resentment over years - Demonetization was a historical blunder which devastated the economy, GST was poorly implemented, small and medium enterprises were worst affected, unemployment is at a 50 years peak, GDP growth is lowest since liberalization, ILFS and PMC have collapsed, many other large institutions and companies are on the verge of bankruptcy. Two RBI governors, chief economic advisor and Chair of Niti Aayog have resigned to protest the mishandling of the economy.\n\nAnother issue is the disintegrating social fabric of the country and increasing violence in all walks of life - lynchings, sexual violence, police brutality, caste atrocities, etc. Even in the case of these protests, the situation escalated only after the excessive use of force in Jamia despite no evidence that students were involved in acts of vandalism and arson. The violence continues to grow as more than 20 people are dead in last week, and Yogi swears revenge and carries out extra judicial killings and arrests.\n\nTherefore, we should expect the protests to advance towards the logical next step, which is broadbasing to larger issues (CAA being one of them):\n\n1.

      <li>Title::: 'Nationalism Rules'<br />Body: 'What’s the most powerful political force in the world? Some of you might say it’s the bond market. Others might nominate the resurgence of religion or the advance of democracy or human rights. Or maybe it’s digital technology, as symbolized by the Internet and all that comes with it. Or perhaps you think it’s nuclear weapons ...\n\n- BY STEPHEN M. WALT | JULY 15, 2011, 11:00 PM\n\nWhat’s the most powerful political force in the world? Some of you might say it’s the bond market. Others might nominate the resurgence of religion or the advance of democracy or human rights. Or maybe it’s digital technology, as symbolized by the Internet and all that comes with it. Or perhaps you think it’s nuclear weapons and the manifold effects they have had on how states think about security and the use of force.\n\nThose are all worthy nominees (no doubt readers here will have their own favorites), but my personal choice for the Strongest Force in the World would be nationalism. The belief that humanity is comprised of many different cultures — i.e., groups that share a common language, symbols, and a narrative about their past (invariably self-serving and full of myths) — and that those groups ought to have their own state has been an overwhelmingly powerful force in the world over the past two centuries. \n\nIt was nationalism that cemented most of the European powers in the modern era, turning them from dynastic states into nation-states, and it was the spread of nationalist ideology that helped destroy the British, French, Ottoman, Dutch, Portuguese, Austro-Hungarian, and Russian/Soviet empires. Nationalism is the main reason the United Nations had fifty-one members immediately after its founding in 1945 and has nearly 200 members today. It is why the Zionists wanted a state for the Jewish people and why Palestinians want a state of their own today. It is what enabled the Vietnamese to defeat both the French and the American armies during the Cold War. It is also why Kurds and Chechens still aspire to statehood; why Scots have pressed for greater autonomy within the United Kingdom, and it is why we now have a Republic of South Sudan.\n\nUnderstanding the power of nationalism also tells you a lot about what is happening today in the European Union. During the Cold War, European integration flourished because it took place inside the hot-house bubble provided by American protection. Today, however, the United States is losing interest in European security, the Europeans themselves face few external threats, and the EU project itself has expanded too far and badly overreached by creating an ill-advised monetary union. What we are seeing today, therefore, is a gradual renationalization of European foreign policy, fueled in part by incompatible economic preferences and in part by recurring fears that local (i.e., national) identities are being threatened. When Danes worry about Islam, Catalans demand autonomy, Flemish and Walloons contend in Belgium, Germans refuse to bail out Greeks, and nobody wants to let Turkey into the EU, you are watching nationalism at work.\n\nThe power of nationalism is easy for realists to appreciate and understand, as my sometime collaborator John Mearsheimer makes clear in an important new paper. Nations — because they operate in a competitive and sometimes dangerous world — seek to preserve their identities and cultural values. In many cases, the best way for them to do that is to have their own state, because ethnic or national groups that lack their own state are usually more vulnerable to conquest, absorption, and assimilation.\n\nSimilarly, modern states also have a powerful incentive to promote national unity — in other words, to foster nationalism — because having a loyal and united population that is willing to sacrifice (and in extreme cases, to fight and die) for the state increases its power and thus its ability to deal with external threats. In the competitive world of international politics, in short, nations have incentives to obtain their own state and states have incentives to foster a common national identity in their populations. Taken together, these twin dynamics create a long-term trend in the direction of more and more independent nation-states.\n\nObviously, nations and states don’t always reach the goal of a unified "nation-state." Some nations never succeed in gaining independence, and some states never succeed in creating a unified national identity for themselves. And not every cultural or ethnic group thinks of itself as a nation or aspires to independence (though one can never be sure when some group might begin to acquire "national consciousness" and head in that direction). Nonetheless, the past hundred years has seen a steady rise in the number of states and the emergence of strong national movements in many of them, and I see no reason to expect this trend to be reversed.  \n\nOnce established, a nation-state is a self-reinforcing phenomenon. Nation-states are hard to conquer and subdue, because the local population will usually resist outside invasion and continue to struggle against a foreign occupier. Successful national movements tend to spawn imitators, leading to further demands for statehood. Despite its occasional shortcomings (and the obvious examples of "failed states" like Somalia, Yemen, or Afghanistan), the national state is likely to remain the most important political entity in world politics for the foreseeable future.\n\nBecause American national identity tends to emphasize the civic dimension (based on supposedly universal principles such as individual liberty) and tends to downplay the historic and cultural elements (though they clearly exist) U.S. leaders routinely underestimate the power of local affinities and the strength of cultural, tribal, or territorial loyalties. During the Cold War, we persistently exaggerated the strength of transnational ideologies like Communism, and underestimated the degree to which national identities and interests would eventually generate intense conflicts within the Marxist world. Osama bin Laden made the same mistake when he thought that terrorist attacks and video-taped fulminations would ignite a mass movement to re-establish a transnational Islamic caliphate. And anyone who thinks that a rising China is going to tamely submit to U.S. or Western notions of the proper world order fails to appreciate the degree to which nationalism is also a central part of the Chinese worldview, and far more important than any lingering "communist" ideals.\n\nUnless we fully appreciate the power of nationalism, in short, we are going to get a lot of things wrong about the contemporary political life. It is the most powerful political force in the world, and we ignore it at our peril.'<br />Author: '2020_redditor'  id: 'edndtr'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/edndtr/nationalism_rules/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Where are we headed?'<br />Body: 'Caste based reservations has been prelevant in India since as long and far back as I can remember. The Ministry of Minority Affairs gives scholarships and job training to people of religious minorities. Are these not in direct contradiction to the Constitution of India; i.e discrimination on the basis of caste and religion respectively? Why do these\xa0protesters\xa0rioters not speak up against that? Moreover just the other day, Delhi government announced free rides to women in all public transport. Is this not discrimination on the basis of sex? Do they not directly affect the citizens of India? Why were the bollywood celebs and media praising Kejriwal then?\n\nBecause these are not discriminations per se. These acts / provisions were put into effect to uplift a certain section of the society, to reform certain imbalances and to incite a sense of entitlement among the minorities. In no way do these provisions discriminate against anyone. Why, then, has the Citizenship Amendment Act (aka CAA) triggered widespread\xa0protestsriots across India? CAA is nothing but a (kind of) minority welfare scheme, which does not affect the minorities of our country. It shouldn’t have come as a surprise that Muslims (that form the majority of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan) have been excluded from this ‘scheme’ since they do not categorize as minority in these three countries.\n\nThe whole idea behind the formation of Pakistan and Bangladesh was based on religion. The Muslims, both Shias and Ahmedis, demanded a separate Islamic nation. Therefore, by moral delegation, we are not obligated for their rehabilitation, (though they can still apply for citizenhip as per Citizenship Act, but they have been excluded from fast track procedure). Refugees of every other religion that form minorities in these countries, on the other hand, never demanded for partition. The CAA is not against Muslims, let alone Indian Muslims. It’s only and only for the welfare of the minorities of these three countries. The whole point of CAA is to provide a faster route to the religious minorities of these countries (or what some people call illegal immigrants) to apply for Indian citizenship. That’s all there is to it. Just five years of relief and the whole country lost it’s shit. What has triggered these wisespread\xa0protests\xa0riots throughout the country?\n\nWell, for starters, Muslims are scared, and to some extent, understandably so. First the triple talaq bill, followed by revocation of Articel 370 in Kashmir, followed by Ayodhya verdict, and now this. Muslims are living under constant panic in “Modi-Raj”. Video clips of violence have been spreading on social media like the fire that these ‘students’ have lit the school buses and public properties on. Media channels (duh!) and Bollywood celebs (read: as$#oles) have only been adding fuel to it. If you throw stones at the police, kill people under the guise of protest, break laws, and then act victim and think that liberandus will support you then, well, you’re not wrong.\n\nComing to NRC, I don’t know much about the situation in the North-East so I won’t speak for them BUT! For the rest of us, let the NRC come first. Then if you and I feel that something wrong is being done in the name of religion, we can voice our concerns and protest or whatever. Then we have every right to accuse or abuse the government. But invoking violence on baseless propagandas and speculations (kudos to the people of Chandigarh and fellow Hyderabadis for showing civility) is a matter of serious concern.\n\nTo be honest, it’s kinda scary to think that these people are the future of India. These people (millenials, specifically) who don’t give two hoots about the pollution and population crisis, litter like India is their garbage bin, honk their ass off on the way to work / college, indulge in violence at the slightest provocation, bathe in black money and give away\xa0faaltu-ka-bin-maanga-gyaan. But when it comes to the government providing a certain sense of entitlement and belonging to a minority community (which does not even affect them in ANY FUCKING WAY, mind you), they lose their shit. Tell me honestly, is this not a matter of concern.\n\nOn a completely unrelated note, I believe (I’m wrong, obviously) the primary reason for these protests in India is not CAA or NRC, but feeling left out. From Lebanon to Spain to Chile to Bolivia and of course Hong Kong, the whole world is breaking into protests against the establishment. Why then should we be left behind?\xa0Protest karo bhencho-'<br />Author: 'milant_'  id: 'edk1fg'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/edk1fg/where_are_we_headed/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[Serious; Discussion] How is India NOT heading towards a Fascist state?'<br />Body: 'Starting Point: I want to have a serious discussion. I don\'t think India is fascist or leaning towards fascism. \n\nSo one of the main arguments we hear is "India is leaning towards fascism" or "India is a fascist country."  And from many articles, it\'s essentially taking a historian/researcher\'s list of characteristics of a fascist state and applying it to India. \n\nNow, fascism is a complex ideology, and with all due respect to those who right these articles and those who yell "India is fascist" ... it\'s hard to argue that. \n\nI got into an argument with a person who claimed India was fascist and I didn\'t do so well. I didn\'t use arguments like "a fascist country would have suppressed your rights" because I wanted to focus on the characteristics of a fascist state, which is the baseline of many claims. That type of argument doesn\'t sound appropriate. It feels lacking because \n\nTo set things up, here are 14 characteristics from a political scientist:\n\n**Powerful and Continuing Nationalism **\n&gt;Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays. \n\n**Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights **\n&gt;Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of "need." The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc. \n\n**Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause **\n&gt;The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc. \n\n**Supremacy of the Military **\n&gt;Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized. \n\n**Rampant Sexism **\n&gt;The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy. \n\n**Controlled Mass Media **\n&gt;Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common. \n\n**Obsession with National Security **\n&gt;Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses. \n\n**Religion and Government are Intertwined **\n&gt;Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government\'s policies or actions. \n\n**Corporate Power is Protected **\n&gt;The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite. \n\n**Labor Power is Suppressed **\n&gt;Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed . \n\n**Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts **\n&gt;Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts. \n\n**Obsession with Crime and Punishment** \n&gt;Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations. \n\n**Rampant Cronyism and Corruption **\n&gt;Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders. \n\n**Fraudulent Elections **\n&gt;Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.\n\nTake this Quartz article (yes, Quartz sucks, but it provides an opinion on how the LW feel about fascism + India). It\'s not the greatest, IMHO, but it uses another philosopher, Umberto Eco\'s, analysis on characteristics of fascism. \n\nI want to improve my arguments, but I\'m ignorant in fascism and poli-sci is not my thing.'<br />Author: 'DeathofSerenity'  id: 'ed4wgh'<br />Score:21<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ed4wgh/serious_discussion_how_is_india_not_heading/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'A descendant of East Bengali Hindus and why I support CAA'<br />Body: 'I ama descendant of East bengali Hindus from my father\'s side. They lived near Chittagong. Growing up, I heard many stories about our land there, the fields, and the life there because life in Pre-Independence Bengal was kind of unique. These stories are part of our family tradition nowadays and every time Durga Puja comes around, my father tells me the stories of  our family before the Partition. \n\nDuring the Partition, a full side of my father\'s family was killed and a few others were missing. My great Grandmother had 5 siblings, 3 sisters and 2 brothers. During the Partition, only my Great Grandmother, her husband and her two children (my grandfather and his sister) managed to come to India. \n\nI was just looking through Social Media and it seems many people have forgotten what Partition was like for us Hindus and why the CAA is the only lifeline for those poor Hindus still stuck in those hellish countries. I won\'t blame any religion here, there may have been good people too, and indeed a couple of them were, but that country was formed in the sin of division and my ancestors paid the price. \n\nMy great grandmother knew that her brothers were killed in the Partition, what she didnt know was that both her sisters were also killed. One of them, she thought had escaped as she lived near the Burmese Border with East Bengal at the time. \n\nMy father and grandfather would tell us about the house we had in the village, it even had a well and everyone was allowed to come to drink from there. Apparently, my greatgrandmother\'s husband was staunchly against caste or religion and was very Gandhian. He would keep water out in the front of the door to the house every night and day so that all passersby could drink from there. \n\nWhen the partition happened, My greatgrandmother and her husband managed to escape. They felt they had to after they heard that my great grandmother\'s brothers had all been killed in some town at the border. My great grandmother waited for her sister to come to their village but then the rioting and looting had gone out of hand by that stage. As such, she had no choice but to leave for India. \n\nOn the way there, her other sister died. She wasn\'t killed but she had some kind of illness and was very frail. I remember that they laid her to rest somewhere by a lake, I am not even sure they cremated her. \n\nMy greatgrandmother lived most of her life in India thinking that her sister escaped. She was very close to the other East Bengali Displaced Peoples, and they had a small community where they resettled. Many people at that time thought that maybe their relatives would be able to join them once things cooled down, maybe others thought that they had lived and were more or less okay. At the border between Burma and East Bengal however, there was some violence. Maybe there were riots there too. \n\nIn time, in 1978, someone in the East Bengali Displaced Peoples community said that they knew someone from the village my great grandmother\'s sister lived. He said that they didn\'t have good news. \n\nMy greatgrandmother, bless her, was a strong woman. She had lived her life in the false hope that maybe one day, her sister and her children would walk in through the gates of the colony they lived in. \n\nThe man who came from that village came over to my great grandmother\'s house. He refused to take any tea or refreshments and told her the truth. Her sister, her sister\'s husband, their children, were all killed and their bodies thrown into the well in their courtyard. The house had been burnt to a crisp. This man and his family had escaped after they saw what had happened there and escaped to Burma and then to Tripura and from there to Meghalaya. \n\nNow, when I see the violence against the CAA, part of me is always afraid that the same people who slaughtered my family. Who killed innocent men, women and children, will do the same. Except this time, Indian Hindus supporting this kind of violence under "secularism" will help them. My greatgrandmother passed in 1985, my grandfather passed in 2005. I don\'t live in India and haven\'t lived in India for over 10 years now. My parents still live there, and my heart breaks for them. I haven\'t spoken to my father about this, but I know that he too is afraid. What if they come for him like they came for his grandmother\'s siblings? He may not say but I am sure a part of him is glad I left India when I could. \n\nIt is very cold where I live. It is snowing here. Outside, there is quiet. There is the occasional sound of people excited for Christmas. I am just afraid and I hope that I don\'t become displaced too.'<br />Author: 'BlackMackSnackCrack'  id: 'ed0sxu'<br />Score:75<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ed0sxu/a_descendant_of_east_bengali_hindus_and_why_i/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Unpopular opinion: our approach to law is scriptural, an ultimate civilizational defeat'<br />Body: 'Debating whether something is constitutional or not is akin to debating whether something is permissible according to the Torah, Bible, or the Quran. The one saving grace is that constitutions are more mutable than the Abrahamic scriptures, or are they? The Bible is known to have undergone several "redactions" and the Quran has been traditionally supplemented by several Hadiths. \n\nEither way, just as the religious scriptures are interpreted by ecclesiastical scholars or mullahs, constitutions are interpreted only by specific authorities. While this is bad, I think it\'s better than direct interpretation which is bound to result in significantly more conflict, conflict that is characteristically moralistic.  \n\nKnow that the root of modern constitutions lies in Anglo-specific history - (a) in the Magna Carta/Bill of Rights which were meant as treaties between aristocrats and the English King, and (b) the significantly Christian influence on contemporary Anglo culture (which continues to dominate today). \n\nThe tension between the king and aristos, since the Norman conquest in the 11th century, gradually tilted in favor of the latter, making Anglo politics more whiggish, ultimately birthing democracy as we know it. The time for democracy was also ripe because of Christian ethic - one that seeks to promote underdogs, often inventing them where none exist (this is obvious when we see how Christian missionaries work in India). Note that the aristos promoted whiggism primarily to usurp power from the king. (Whiggism is what has transformed into modern-day "leftism".)\n\nThis same tension was carried over into the US. When the Cavaliers lost the English civil war, a significant number of them moved to the colony of Virginia, leading the King to nickname it "the Old Dominion" for its loyalty to the crown. The US north, on the other hand, was continuously populated by more whiggish colonists with puritans/pilgrims at an extreme. This divide was reflected later in the American civil war. The outcomes of both the civil wars made the Anglo civilization significantly whiggish.  \n\nThe Christian influence on Anglo culture, as I\'d already mentioned, made the society ripe for democracy, providing a basis for whiggism. The Enlightenment also paved the way for it. The Enlightenment itself was a continuation of the Reformation. The Reformation (or the rise of Protestantism) was a rejection of Catholic authority, favoring instead literalist interpretation of the Bible - "sola scriptura". The Reformation was also tacitly promoted by European Kings so as to undermine the Catholic church\'s authority. The Enlightenment was a rejection of ecclesiastical authority altogether. The only way the Enlightenment would\'ve succeeded, however, is if it had retained moral consistency with Christian ethic, i.e. if it could remain palatable to the masses. And it did. It remained "underdog promoting", among other things. It remained highly moralistic, while rejecting Christian theology. \n\nAll of this comes together in Indian politics and the legal system. The Indian republic is organized as a democratic (Christian) society, with a Constitution that\'s treated as scripture. I understand the need for a shared understanding among a nation\'s people. Schelling points are absolutely necessary. Schelling points are upon which all great civilizations are built. But the Constitution is beyond Schelling points, perhaps even contrary to it, because it requires "interpretation" and isn\'t otherwise immediately intuitive or accessible. We are now like the Abrahamics, relying on a book and its interpretation. We have suffered an ultimate civilizational defeat.'<br />Author: 'hindu-bale'  id: 'ecw0mb'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ecw0mb/unpopular_opinion_our_approach_to_law_is/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Spectrum on the right'<br />Body: "Disclaimer - I'd identify myself as a centrist with a left inclination. I swing both directions on economic and social issues, but am strongly liberal and progressive on civil liberties. If someone labels me leftist, i would say - not entirely true, but sometimes I'm pretty leftist. With being labeled socialist, I would disagree more assertively, citing my strong inclinations towards a healthy mixed economy and market driven solutions to socio-economic problems. But if I was to be labeled Communist or Naxalite, I would vehemently disagree. I'm sure there are some overlaps between these ideologies and mine, but that way I'll have some overlaps with almost all ideologies in the world. So there's a spectrum on the left side of politics, which is well understood widely. Like me, most leftists don't identify with being communist or naxalite.\n\nNow, right of centre politics, which is having a bit of a peak moment globally at the moment, is bound to have similar diversity and differentiation. But this differentiation is not as well understood, perhaps because Indian right has not been as dominant historically as it has been lately, so people haven't caught up yet. In case of the Modi-Shah government, a lot of people voted for them in the 2014 general elections because of the anti-corruption and development narrative they campaigned with, and because of the national security issue which peaked following Pulwama attack and Balakot airstrikes. These people may be supporters of market-driven economic reforms, may want a break from the status quo of structural corruption in the Indian state, may aspire towards a more assertive foreign policy and may desire a more proactive law and order regime. These are issues which many pragmatic liberals and leftists would also support. I, myself support many of this government's foreign, security and environmental policies. Can't say the same for this government's economic policies and civil liberties record. Anyone who doesn't see the plight of the Indian economy is delusional.\n\nComing back to the topic, most of the BJP voters may not support the RSS agenda or consider Modi an avatar of Vishnu. But nonetheless, in the everyday online discourse, anyone supporting Modi or government's policy is labeled as Modi-cultist (b word) or belonging to RSS (s word). These terms have been misused so much that they have become meaningless. (But at least  they are not as obscene as the terms that the right) This distinction between moderates and extremists on the right needs to be acknowledged and understood. The extremists on the Indian right subscribe to the Savarkarite ideology of radical majoritarian nationalism, which they try to link with Hinduism, by calling it Hindutva. The extremist Savarkarites are the ones who indulge in conspiracy theories of global islamic takeover, and that 'sab mile hue hain' - students, congress, aap, muslims, bollywood, global media (even Pak and Dawood). They act as if questioning our own government in a democracy is a crime. These Savarkarites are violently anti-Gandhian, so they are ready to justify any means, as long as the ends are as per their ideology. They are ok with democratic institutions being destroyed so that their leader wins,  hundreds dying because of demonetisation, regular Kashmiris suffering because of some extremist elements, innocent students being shot at because of vandalism done by others, and so on.\n\nThis extremist faction of the right is the real danger to our nation, and to whom most liberal leftists are strongly opposed. These Savarkarites interpret the BJP manadate to mean that majority of the country supports their extremists views of establishment of Hindu Rashtra, demonization of Muslims and one-party state in India. They forget that 65 % of Indians didn't vote for BJP, and even among the 35% that did,  many don't support their extremist agenda. These spontaneous, peaceful protests by lakhs of students in every single part of the country has proven that these Savarkarites are delusional. India is strongly pluralistic and will vehemently oppose the bigoted agenda that they subscribe to. And these lakhs of protestors are more opposed to violence than these extremist Savarkarites, and are heart-broken when some miscreants turn towards violence. Violent and extremist elements on both sides should be punished by the due process of law. Jai Hind!\n\nP.S: Those who see the world only through one lens will wonder if I'm a muslim. I'm was born a Hindu, but no longer identify with any religion. I'm a proud Indian though."<br />Author: 'hsnaras'  id: 'ecqw8x'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ecqw8x/spectrum_on_the_right/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'HOW MEDIA IS SUPPORTING JIHADIST ?'<br />Body: "This whole protest was so perfectly scripted for someone, that there was a very minor chance for any failure. However, **a car** broke **the wall** of these people.\n\nThis particular photo is getting circulated on social media a lot. There are two girls in this photo.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zfc5ict8oi541.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67127c12ba211225f864560579d065cc63ca2372\n\nEverything  was fine, until today morning, the following photo was surfaced on the  web, which was with the controversial journalist Barkha Dutt, who needs  no introduction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6sqiotldoi541.jpg?width=602&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95df74552dfba8bc75a360a042aeb5a567779bbb\n\nIn  this photo, the girl with the specs is becoming popular on social media  with various portraits showing her ‘bravery’ in shielding that  protestors from the policemen.\n\nThe name of the girl with the specs here is **Aysha Renna**, and the other girl’s name is **Ladeeda Farzana.**\n\nThe  girl, Aysha Renna, according to her FB profile, was the supporter of  terrorist Yakub Memon, who involved in the 1993 terror attack in Mumbai  which killed 257 innocent people. After his hanging, and she felt she  was helpless in the fascist country India. And she could only regret  like a doll, which by the way I have no idea what is that. (\\*The post is  now been deleted by her.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ifcn4lngoi541.jpg?width=602&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc20d3a51d6c0f3b5d05fe4e4249b04f8d2c0cb3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/or68awxioi541.jpg?width=602&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeb4023cb39f301a96aa624b6bb94310b0504a4e\n\nLet’s get back to Barkha Dutt. According to Barkha, they both are ‘Sheroes’ of the continuing protest.\n\nHowever, there is only one ‘Hero’ (‘Shero!’) here, and the other one is the ‘Wingman’.\n\n**What is Wingman (Wing-person)?** *The Wing-person is the one who might take some risks for the sake of the ‘Hero’.*\n\nPeople will think that the **Ayesha Rana** (girl with the specs) is the hero, but no, she is just a ‘Wing-person’ here. The real **‘Hero’** in this whole movement is **Ladeeda Farzana (Ladeeda Sakhaloon).**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ud85iwjmoi541.jpg?width=602&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd448425b68e06ff42da407fa7cfac47760ec477\n\nAysha  is just there to get the attention. Whole ‘movement’ is for Ladeeda  Farzana that Barkha names first smartly. Barkha precisely chose the name  ‘Ladeeda Farzana’ rather ‘Ladeeda Sakhaloon’ which she has used every  social media platform so that you can’t search articles on her real  name.\n\nLadeeda  Sakhaloon has been preaching Islam for a while, which is her right.  However, she was a student in Kerela till December 2018. It would be  interesting to see when she moved to Delhi and how that timing was  determined. Currently, she is a first-year bachelor student in Arabic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vut7VZifoq8&amp;feature=emb\\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vut7VZifoq8&amp;feature=emb_logo)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn  2017, Ladeeda was already talking politics of Muslim women in college.  She was obviously aspirational, but you can notice her lack of  confidence and shaking tone 2 years ago even at home crowd.\n\n2 years of grooming can do wonders!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\\_continue=86&amp;v=\\_GriAPxXPbQ&amp;feature=emb\\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=86&amp;v=_GriAPxXPbQ&amp;feature=emb_logo)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile,  Outlook magazine, in which Aysha husband’s working, published a story  two days back. They skillfully forced people to notice Ladeeda, even  before any violent protest arrived in Jamia Malia. So after two years,  this is how groomed Ladeeda is protesting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcgxwgxtoi541.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb315014af40e0f4af858bf7e437de1d6b22138f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn  this article, the outlook writer is trying to compare this protest is  as equivalent to ‘Arab Springs’ protest happened in 2011.\n\n**What is/was Arab Springs?** It  fell between 2010–12 in North African states against the Islamic  governments. There were estimated 100,000+ deaths in this whole protest,  which also resulted in the ongoing Syrian civil war, the Iraqi civil  war, the Egyptian Crisis and coup, the Libyan civil war, and the Yemen  civil war.\n\nAgain,  if you compare the following photograph, you will notice a resemblance  between this and the photograph of those girls protesting above.\n\nThe  following photograph was from the protest that happened during Arab  springs in Sudan, in which the lady is trying to prompt people to  protest against the current regime.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tc6upvjwoi541.jpg?width=602&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf52935d536295f7abc139ecc766fba27df31491\n\nThe  photographer and the writer both tried to steal a similar kind of  thought and posture. However, even copying requires basic commonsense,  which was lacking in the writer. In the flurry of writing about Ladeeda,  they posted the idea (about the Sudanese lady) in the article itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cbklveb1pi541.png?width=498&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e944c5819e16786727671d6e17b7dce057f1e4b\n\nNow,  Barkha went to the university to interview these girls. The script is  now almost complete. Girls are popular after news channels reporting and  viral social media campaigns. In the interview with Barkha is asking to  Ladeeda about her thoughts when she was protesting standing on **the car.** Ladeeda corrected her that it was **the wall**, not the car. Then why Barkha was asking about the car???\n\nThe  reason could either could be a change in script or improvisation by  Ladeeda. Yes. They were stealing the plot from the Sudanese protestor  incident. Barkha got lost in the detail while Ladeeda had improvised on  the scene and stood on a wall instead. *Now, who will get scolding for this, Barkha or Ladeeda?*\n\nPeople  might think that these all could be coincidental. However, it was not  the first time the girls were protesting. They did the same 2 months  back as well against their own VC.\n\nTheir story was the same, but this time instead of police, Jamia goons were attacking them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oeeuqmy3pi541.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c35fb9f857585ab433ca863e62fdc7a39fc2855\n\nStill, people will say this all could be also a coincidence.\n\nBut  in Barkha’s interview video, with those two girls, there is one more  person present. Any guesses? It was the same person, who was shielded by  these girls ‘Sheroically’, in that popular photo, which went viral on  social media.\n\nWho was this third person? Was he a bachelor student from Jamia or a master student or a researcher? **NO, he is a journalist, Shaheen Abdullah,** from Maktoob media, a news portal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdg9f3d6pi541.jpg?width=602&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f685dd37f84d45c067226a7cd83369d658d0eeae\n\nShaheen  Abdullah, the man (the student according to social media) that police  were chasing and beating, and who went hiding exactly at the same  location where Ladeeda was, is a journalist from Maktoob media.\n\nMaktoob  media is an ‘independent’ media house with a very bad designed  WordPress website and is based in Kerala and Delhi. Who else is based in  Kerala and Delhi? Good guess- **Ladeeda Sakhaloon! The Hero of this script!**\n\nInterestingly, Aysha Renna's husband is also a contributor to Maktoob media.\n\nNow  the question emerges, why was a journalist for a Kerela media being  pursued by the cops? I bet, people will never get the footage of what  happened before police chased Shaheen and how he ran exactly in the  narrow alley where Ladeeda and Aysha were. Why was a journalist luring  the cops?\n\nShaheen  of Maktoob Media isn't a student of Jamia engaging in the protests! No,  his job was just to bring angry police after him to stage Ladeeda and  Ayesha as the brave Sheroes. Ladeeda moved to Jamia only lately, so she  didn't have confidantes there.\n\nLook  at this picture. It’s not a phone shot by a bystander. This is a crisp  DSLR picture with a 'wide-angle' lens. Likely 15 or wider. (this was a  still photo parsed in the video on Barkha's twitter feed interview.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hcndeif9pi541.jpg?width=602&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3c9480e02d1dc43cb9c5c1bead5b97113707891\n\nThis  whole protest was a staged, set-up for Ladeeda and Aysha. A perfect  script, but over-confidence of Barkha and outlook writers exposed them  completely.\n\nThe peaceful protestors wants Jihad in the country, but no, it’s not going to be happen anytime in the future.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/47kkjszcpi541.jpg?width=602&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=871e577c99a57fdaec1e6b5979aa2d256f45ba92"<br />Author: 'MINOSHI__'  id: 'eco4oi'<br />Score:21<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eco4oi/how_media_is_supporting_jihadist/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Please tell me where I'm wrong about CAA/NRC."<br />Body: 'Preamble: CAA is toothless without the NRC. To see the bigger picture, you have to look at BOTH of these together.\n\nFACT1: The Home Minister of our Country has announced that NRC, which was implemented in Assam, is now going to be rolled out across the country. Everyone living in India will soon need to prove their citizenship.\n\nFACT2: A PAN card or an AADHAR card is not proof that you are an Indian citizen.\n\nFACT3: Detention centers are being built all across the nation.\n\nThese are facts and they are undisputed. Digest that for a minute.\n\nNow let\'s look at what happened in Assam when the NRC was rolled out. These are the words of Harsh Mander, who was an IAS officer during the implementation of NRC in Assam and resigned when the CAB became an Act. "I have witnessed the incredible levels of suffering created by the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. Impoverished rural people, often landless and unlettered, staked all their meagre belongings and many years to gather documents to prove that they were citizens. These certificates of birth, schooling, land-ownership and voters’ lists dating back several decades are such that most of us would find impossible to muster. Even a small discrepancy in spelling was sufficient for these documents to be rejected. The consequences of such rejection were catastrophic. You could be sent to detention centers for years, with no hope of release. Finding names missing from the NRC lists, or when loved ones were exiled to detention centres, several committed suicide in despair."\n\n19 lakh (1.9 million) people were not able to prove their citizenship. Right now, we\'re still talking about human beings across caste, creed, and color. In fact, out of these 1.9 million people, only less than one-third were found to be Muslims.\n\nIt is this that the CAA will change. In the nationwide NRC declared by Union home minister Amit Shah, now undocumented people of any religious identity EXCEPT Muslims will be treated as refugees and given citizenship. Only undocumented Muslims will be treated as illegal immigrants, carted away to detention centers and in all likelihood divested of all citizenship rights — of voting, land ownership and social security. This is only Assam; extrapolate this across the country! Millions of Muslims, from the poorest sections of our country, who are unable to produce the necessary documents, are going to get stuffed into detention centers all over India.\n\nThe process that has been devised is like a funnel. At the top-of-the-funnel (TOFU) there\'s all of us. In the middle-of-the-funnel (MOFU) there\'s everyone unable to prove (and unable to afford to buy the necessary papers to prove) their citizenship. Right at the bottom-of-the-funnel (BOFU) there\'s only the Muslims who can\'t prove (and can\'t afford to buy the necessary papers to prove) their citizenship.\n\nGoing from TOFU to MOFU is itself going to be a herculean, massively expensive and massively corrupt process. Do you remember demonetization? The people that did the jugaar got away scot-free, and the politicians, middlemen, and some corrupt bankers got rich. How will this be different? Does India have the money to carry out this exercise? Has anyone budgeted it? Has anyone estimated the expense? Has anyone planned anything except meaningless, jingoistic, rhetorical statements?\n\nAnd then, after thousands of crores have been spent, and all 1.3 billion of us have been whetted by the powers that be, there will be a final report card, leaving millions of people at the bottom of the funnel, who will be carted away to detention centers. \n\nIs there anything I don\'t know about or I\'m wrong about?\nAbove information is given by my friend who I think is has unbiased views about everything. According to him, this will be the ground reality of how this law will be imposed.'<br />Author: 'BluRRyFace_____'  id: 'ecac2u'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ecac2u/please_tell_me_where_im_wrong_about_caanrc/</li>

It isn't easy with constant misinformation, and attacks on reddit by the Left wing, Pakistani Nationalists, Sikh Separatists, White Supremacists, and any other group that want India to not succeed. I am hoping to give at least a personal connection, so those who are even in the fringe/against it may have empathy for your fellow human being.\n\nMy father's family sought refuge in India during the 80's shortly after the Soviet Invasion. We had large a nice family business, and all of that was gone. The instability, the religious extremists all made life hell for my father and his family. We were lambs to be slaughtered, absolutely no one cared about our plight. But when things got bad, it wasn't even a question where we would go. India has always been a second home to us Hindus, and we knew that it was the best country for Hindus in the subcontinent. \n \nMy father and all members of my family, arrived penniless to India. But it was Sevaks from the RSS who came to aid my family, the provided food and clothing to my family. When neighbors who grew up with my father didn't bother helping him, complete strangers were in India giving a helping hand.  \n\nThe family eventually had a better life, engaging in business, my father married my mother ( whose parent's came from Pakistan during Partition), and my father had his asylum work approved for West Germany, and they moved there and eventually settled in America where I currently live.  Other members of my family including my grandfather, uncles and aunts live in India and were on the verge of tears when this passed. They always give donations to temples, langars, sevaks, etc. Always to pay back for the generosity for this country that adopted them. \n\nI know most of you guys don't care but this is the reason why as Indian American, I always love India, I contribute and share positive news about it here in America, defend it with all my strength, because it is the reason I am here in a good place.

      <li>Title::: 'Appeal to the Masses'<br />Body: ' \n\nI  have been closely monitoring all these protests from the past few days and believe me I have seen a lot of data from each and every perspective. I just wanted to appeal all my fellow Indians that  "peaceful protest" can do the most damage to any government, I  understand that people are angry right now, I was looking at everything related to Seelampur riots. If you will tell me Police started the riots  I will believe you If you will say that People started the riots I will believe that as well because I have seen plenty of evidence from both sides, I am not here to debate on that. The conclusion is that we have a  few angry people in every community, It\'s our duty to calm them down and go the peaceful protest way.\n\n**Whatever positive impact we had with peaceful protests outside Delhi Police HQ  &amp; India Gate will be neglected by everyone because of whatever is happening in Seelampur right now.**\n\nAs  I said already, we have disturbing elements in every society and only we can stop them, Let me put it in very simple words "Dear Muslims If you have any relatives nearby or any known person who is part of these violent protest or even thinking about ragging a war against the government then talk to them, get into verbal fights if you have to,  they are simply giving the authorities a license to use lethal force  &amp; that will even make things worse, The peaceful protests won\'t be taking place after that, there will be blood on streets and they will hunt you guys down like mad dogs the very same way they did in 2002, My words might hurt you but trust me these Authorities have just begun,  Don\'t make it severe, We as a Hindu, Sikh, Christian can try to reason with rioting Muslims but we might be beaten to death. You need to take  care of these people, You need to make sure that peaceful protest is the  ONLY WAY POSSIBLE, Govt is just a few steps away from shutting down  communication and start their game"\n\nI  am saying for the 3rd time that we have people of our communities trying to brainwash us, We need to stay united and peaceful. If you will start riots on-road then Hindus will fear to stand with you because there will be people in the crowd who will there specially to fight  Hindus. Appeal as many people to maintain peace, If the police are trying to rage a war then back off, It won\'t do any damage, Keep your fucking ego aside, **BACK OFF IF YOU HAVE TOO** and we together will find a way to handle things.\n\nIn many places in Muslim areas, there are announcements on Masjid\'s  Loudspeakers to maintain peace, I love you guys for doing that, Stay strong, Maintain peace. The people distributing sattvic food at India  gate yesterday were also Muslims, The people who are creating chaos in  Seelampur are also Muslims, Please try to control them I am saying again and again. People won\'t give a fu\\*k about you being hurt because of  NRC, people will only remember Muslims breaking glasses of a school bus full of children. MAKE A CHOICE, RIGHT NOW.\n\n*The majority of us are with you but only a handful of us are with you on roads, You need to convince the rest of the people that whatever we are doing is right, Hence STAY CALM &amp; BACK OFF IF NEEDED, DON\'T FALL FOR  THE TRAPS.*\n\n**Inquilab Zindabad**\n\nI will again quote John Lennon here:\n\n# “When it gets down to having to use violence, then you are playing the system’s game. The establishment will irritate you –  pull your beard,  flick your face – to make you fight. Because once they’ve got you violent, then they know how to handle you. The only  thing they don’t  know how to handle is non-violence and humor.”\n\nP.S. For the low IQ people: YES I AM AGAINST THESE BILLS.\n\n***"BACK OFF IF YOU HAVE TO, YOUR ACTIONS SHOULD BE AS SWEET AS URDU, NO VIOLENCE" x100***\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\nIf you are part of any protest then be on the lookout for any people you find suspicious, If you have seen any person suspicious, stay near them,  look out for other alibis, take pictures, take videos, notice everything, If they are successful in creating a chaos then try to  follow them where they go next, JUST DON\'T CONFRONT THEM DIRECTLY  because then they might get physical, If they beat you then NO ONE GIVES  A FUCK, If you beat the sh\\*t out of them then headlines will be  "Muslims created chaos and beaten innocent Hindu Students in riots" and  other identical BS &amp; trust me these disturbing elements are waiting for this to start. They have media, they have police,  SO STAY CALM.  Let\'s play their game in a better way.'<br />Author: 'Neglectedsince1994'  id: 'ebvni8'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ebvni8/appeal_to_the_masses/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'My opinion on CAA: its objective, constitutional validity and the moral test'<br />Body: '*As the current megathread is focused on the violence, I would like people doubting this act to take a step back and read this post*\n\nGot some time after some busy work days, and I\'ve just read the amendment bill ([PDF](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/370_2019_LS_Eng.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjeweW7g7zmAhVEcCsKHePlCr0QFjAAegQIAxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw19Zv8OiModNjxszDEQweff)) and here I am with my opinion.\n\nI think that there are three factors for determining whether a bill should be passed or not:\n\n1. Whether it satisfies its object (read the statement of object of the bill)\n2. Whether it is constitutionally valid or not\n3. Whether it is moral or not\n\nI hope that there\'s no confusion about point 1. It absolutely satisfies its object of giving citizenship to persecuted religious minorities in neighbouring constitutionally religious states. \n\n--\n\nIn the first 8-9 minutes of [this video](https://youtu.be/6B1tPdedAs0) [Harish Salve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harish_Salve), ex solicitor general, explains why this act is constitutionally valid. \n\nIf one is too busy to give 8 minutes of his life, here is a summary: \n\nTest of [Article 14](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/367586/), equality before the law:\n\nEquality is not absolute; if it was: we would not have separate military laws, reservation for SC,ST etc. What\'s to debate is what qualifies as an exception. As the ex solicitor general says an article can pass this test if it satisfies it\'s objective, which it does. Whether the object itself is moral or not has been dealt in the final part of this post.\n\nTest of [Article 15](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/609295/), Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth: \n\nThis article prohibits discrimination of "citizens" of India. And the people being dealt here aren\'t citizens yet. So it passes the test. \n\nTest of [Article 21](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1199182/), Protection of life and personal liberty: \n\nIf this act (with amendment) fails the test of Article 21 then the previous act (before amendment) fails the test with less points. As it closed doors for all - this article opens doors for some. \n\nTest of [Article 25](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/631708/), Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion: \n\nThis article doesn\'t prevent Muslim "Citizens of India" from practicing Islam.\n\nTest of [Basic Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_structure_doctrine) of the Indian Constitution, the argument that it isn\'t secularism:\n\nThe definition of Indian secularism hasn\'t been articulated in any article of the constitution. So, we can\'t comment on what\'s secular and what isn\'t. \n\nThe closest articles to secularism are [article 25](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_India) and article 15, which have been discussed earlier. \n\n--\n\nThe Moral Test: \n\nThis is exceptionally subjective: I may find it moral, you might not. We may agree to disagree here. I think most of the people who are protesting against are protesting solely on this basis (if not its constitutional validity). In a democracy the definition of morality is decided by what people feel is moral. \n\nI can go and write more about morality, subjectivity and opinion, but it\'s out of the scope of this post and I will confine to technicalities in our democratic framework. \n\nTechnically, the article is moral as we are a representative democracy. As this has been passed by our representatives: it is moral. \n\nIf we want to test it morally under the framework of democracy which is more direct - we need a referendum. Then only you\'ll know how many citizens support it and that we can\'t judge the whole nation by these protests. \n\nWe can\'t have a referendum on everything, so we can later decide on how to manage a democracy which is more direct to avoid such protests, but it is certainly out of the scope of this post.'<br />Author: 'v-l-s'  id: 'ebscvs'<br />Score:40<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ebscvs/my_opinion_on_caa_its_objective_constitutional/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Is it justified to not include Muslims in CAB? The answer is Yes, it is the right thing to do.'<br />Body: 'At is very core Islam is based on propaganda, by declaring itself the final religion of the world it makes room that spreading Islam is lawful thing to do, and one who does not follow Islam is a "Kafir". *No other religion in my knowledge has such kind of word in it.*\n\nPropaganda is not that bad at all, Christian have it too, But to them its in form of providing structural, financial support if you are ready to convert to Christian which is humanitarian even tough its a kind of forced conversion.\n\nThe propaganda run by Muslims is quite the opposite, Muslims don\'t do charity. Instead they call you "Kafir" which itself is a very derogatory word for them. *Call a Muslim "Kafir" after he had a few pegs with you and he will stop drinking at least with you.*  They cannot afford charity so they harass  you in every form possible. *If you think I am talking BS, You don\'t have to go to Pakistan/Afghanistan/Bangaladesh to see this. Just go rent a house in a locality of Muslim majority, and preferably a Muslim dominant town. Try to live your normal lifestyle with your entire family.*\n\nAlso, when harassing is not just enough it becomes a threat for you. Men are beaten up, Women are abused and raped. Even the law and enforcement wont help they harass you on top of it, just because you are minority in Muslim country. It is the sad truth about the minority people of these countries. While in India, the majority have felt threat from Minority, its not some hypothetical concept made to believe by some political party its is pure observation. It is more evident in small towns in India. If you are liberal secular Hindu, chances are either you are rich or you are living in a Big city to directly observer this.\n\nCAB is something which the people of those countries need.  **It is nothing wrong to give shelter to those based on religion who have been discriminated and harassed based on religion.** Its like reservation, as there its nothing wrong to provide a little caste based privilege to the ones discriminated based on caste.\n\nNow, Is it justified to not provide shelter to Muslims specifically?\n\nWell, Not including Muslims is to avoid certain situation,\n\n* Exclusion of Rohingya\'s from CAB. Rohingyas are notoriously infamous for various reasons.  Following lines are from Wikipedia.\n\n&gt;The UN human rights envoy to Myanmar reported "the long history of  discrimination and persecution against the Rohingya community... could  amount to [crimes against humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity)",[\\[54\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_people#cite_note-un_expert_alarmed_2017_04_07_un-54) and there have been warnings of an unfolding [genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide).\n\n* The migration of Muslim population from Banagladesh is not because of harassment but because of seeking better lifestyle. But, if you even provide Muslims shelter Others might eventually run back into the same thing which they initially ran off from.\n* There are 50 Muslim countries in the world, Not even 1 is Hindu nation. We have to support the ones whom no one would. \n\n**If Muslims care so much of each other around the world, Where are those 50 nation, when we talk about other Muslim Refugees? Many of them are very rich and can easily afford millions more.**\n\nWhy they don\'t care is simple, Its again propaganda. If you remove 5 lakhs of population from a secular state and put it in Muslim state it does not matter much, But if you add 5 lakh population, and assuming each family will have 8 kids(*Normal of lower class Muslim family, Part of propaganda*), They turn into a multi million by the next generation itself.\n\nNo other religion is so fundamentalist by nature. I agree not all Muslims are bad not the high class educated ones who believe in live and let live, but for lower class ones religion is everything to them. \n\n**Its is the reason, and it is justified to not include Muslims in CAB. And hence it is justified.Pelting stones and ruing public property is not. CAB is one of the most Humanitarian steps taken by India in a long time. It should be supported.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    Disclaimer: Even I think that all humans are equal, and I do not support any division based on race, caste and religion.

As soon as Barkha was in the picture, I was convinced I should look a little more, and I did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](2otxayrt60541 "Same girl different places ?")\n\n \n\nThere is a \'Hero\' (or a Shero!) and then there is a \'wingman\' (wing person?). The Wingperson is the one who might take some risks for the sake of the Hero.  The girl with \'Readily identifiable garb\' is the Wingman. She took the front and risk, but she\'s secondary.\n\n The girl with peculiar glasses and hijab is just the \'identifier\'. She is the \'pattern\' for you to recognise for association with the \'Movement\'. She is soon sidelined. The Focus comes on the Focus.  Who\'s next to Barkha? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](go6hdj8270541)\n\n This girl is NOT the focus. She is there to catch eye. She will be useful to them, but the focus is on Ladeeda Farzana that Barkha names First.  Also, she calls her Ladeeda Farzana, not Ladeeda Sakhaloon- because that\'s easier to search I guess. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](cq1r65d770541)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Ladeeda Sakhaloon has been preaching Islam and all for a while. Also I see till December 2018 she was a student in Kerala. It would be interesting to see when she moved to Delhi and how that timing was determined. \n\nHere is the link to the YT -  Ladeeda Sakhaloon Religion,Caste,Question of Faith:Locating Contemporary Anxieties Around Conversion\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vut7VZifoq8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vut7VZifoq8)\n\n \n\nThe Outlookindia was already making profile notice of Ladeeda 2 days ago.\n\n[https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-wanted-our-voice-to-reach-miles-meet-jamia-millia-islamias-three-students-from-viral-photo/344126](https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-wanted-our-voice-to-reach-miles-meet-jamia-millia-islamias-three-students-from-viral-photo/344126)\n\nOutlook already celebrated the JamiaProtests with \'Arab Spring\' (No thank you, we don\'t want that in India!) and drew a profile of Ladeeda Sakhaloon and Ayesha Renna. Ladeeda is apparently First yr Bachelor of Arabic in Jamia.\n\nIn 2017, Ladeeda was already talking politics of muslim women in college. She was obviously aspirational, but you can hear her lack of confidence and shaking tone 2 years ago even at home crowd. 2 years of grooming can do wonders! \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_GriAPxXPbQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GriAPxXPbQ)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n This idea was also not genuine but stolen.  Unfortunately, Outlookindia also gives up where they stole the idea from in the excitement of writing about Ladeeda. Sudan\'s "Singing protestor" Alaa Salah. They even put someone with a tambourine there FFS! [https://theguardian.com/global-develop](https://t.co/slh2EvJV2Y?amp=1) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](r0e1kmcu70541)\n\n Then comes the guy who got beaten up that Ayesha and Ladeeda saved so Sheroically!   The man that police was chasing and beating, and who went hiding exactly where Ladeeda was, is Shaheen Abdullah. \'A journalist\' for Maktoob Media \n\n Interestingly Maktoob Media is an \'independent\' media house that works their website on Wordpress amateurish platform and is based in Kerala and Delhi.  Who else is based in Kerala and Delhi? Good guess- Ladeeda Sakhaloon! \n\n[https://en.maktoobmedia.com/about-us/](https://en.maktoobmedia.com/about-us/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Why was a journalist for a kerala media being chased by the cops? I bet you, you will never get the footage of what happened before police chased Shaheen and he went exactly in the narrow alley where Ladeeda and Ayesha were.  Why was a journalist luring the cops?? \n\n Shaheen of Maktoob Media isn\'t a student of Jamia participating in the protests! No sir, his job was just to bring angry police after him to stage Ladeeda and Ayesha as the brave Sheroes.  Ladeeda moved to Jamia only lately, so she didn\'t have confidantes there. \n\n Look at this picture. Its not a phone shot by a bystander. This is a crisp DSLR picture with a \'wide angle\' lens. Likely 15 or wider. (this was a still photo parsed in the video on Barkha\'s twitter feed interview.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](yhylhvkc80541)\n\n Interestingly, in this interview Bharka Dutt keeps telling Ladeeda that barkha thought she was standing on top of a car for this famous picture of hers.  Ladeeda corrects her that it was not a car, they were on top of a wall. You know why?\n\n https://twitter.com/WrongDoc/status/1206555621509586946?s=20 \n\n \n\nThat is because, Alaa Salah of Sudan- the girl from whose image they were stealing the plot for Ladeeda, was standing on a car.  Bharka Dutt got lost in the detail while Ladeeda had improvised on the scene and stood on a wall instead.   Who will get a scolding for this? \n\n \n\nMore interesting stuff: turn towards [firstpost](https://mobile.twitter.com/firstpost) . The article about Ladeeda defending a man in protests published at- look at timestamp- 9 am 16th Dec 2019.  an Op-Ed by Ladeeda herself was published in Firstpost at - look at timestamp- 8 am 16th Dec 2019.   She had done homework!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](m8j80t7t80541)\n\n I see that by now all the other social media screenshots of Ladeeda\'s extremist Jihadi views and Aysha Renna\'s media connection (media husband) are coming out too. Seems they like to work together and were trying to raise profile for a while. \n\n[https://www.newsclick.in/jamia-students-strike-continues-despite-violence-apology-demanded-administration](https://www.newsclick.in/jamia-students-strike-continues-despite-violence-apology-demanded-administration)'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'ebfrs3'<br />Score:193<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ebfrs3/the_curious_and_interesting_case_of_the_girl_in/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Interesting information about luminaries' opinions with respect to the Two Nation Theory"<br />Body: 'I was looking up the Two Nation Theory on the web and decided to give its wiki page a read-down. I must admit that it has improved in quality over the years; not only that, it has a added a lot of new info and the sources seem to be fantastic. \n\nTo all the users of the sub who\'re interested in gaining knowledge about this controversial topic, here is the capsule for perusal:\n\n2NT was first talked about by Islamic scholar Sir Syed Ahmad Khan (1817–1898) in 1883. He drew heavily and developed on the idea about the identity of the Indian muslim post Mughal era. He theorized that Hindus and Muslims are two separate nations in one land, but his was not an approach towards partition of the land which is evident from this *..Just as a man has some principal organs, similarly these two nations are like the principal limbs of India.*\n\nHis stance, or this theory which was in a crude form, was endorsed by contemporary Islamists of note and many British officials.\n\nFormation of separate electorates reinforced the thought in the minds of the people and MA Jinnah, after the formation of All India Muslim League, took the political route to establish and accomplish what is current day Pakistan.\n\nIt is clear that it definitely was not proposed by a Hindu, and those Muslims that came up with that idea were not even remotely thinking about creation of a separate nation state created on religious lines. \n\nLet\'s not discuss the aspects of 2NT as it\'d be purposeless. You people know what it is.\n\nHere comes the important part - prominent Hindu leaders, among them Veer Savarkar, recognized the idea and seemed to endorse 2NT. But, there\'s a lot, a bloody lot, of difference. I think it\'s a moral obligation on us that we clear the air regarding Hindus, i.e, Savarkar, giving assent to the formation of Pakistan.\n\nWhat better person or more neutral a source can they be than B R Ambedkar who actually voiced Savarkar\'s position on such a hotly debated topic. Here goes:\n\n/// Mr. Savarkar... insists that, although there are two nations in India, **India shall not be divided into two parts**, one for Muslims and the other for the Hindus; that the **two nations shall dwell in one country and shall live under the mantle of one single constitution**;... In the struggle for political power between the two nations the rule of the game which Mr. Savarkar prescribes is to be one man one vote, be the man Hindu or Muslim. In his scheme a Muslim is to have no advantage which a Hindu does not have. **Minority is to be no justification for privilege and majority is to be no ground for penalty**. The State will guarantee the Muslims any defined measure of political power in the form of Muslim religion and Muslim culture. But the State will not guarantee secured seats in the Legislature or in the Administration and, if such guarantee is insisted upon by the Muslims, such guaranteed quota is not to exceed their proportion to the general population. ///\n\n\nThe assertion that Savarkar agreed to the partition of India and, in fact, drank pina colada while the country was vivisected is utterly wrong. Savarkar is a true hero; he struggled for the Hindus as well as for the Muslims.\n\nAmbedkar added:\n\n/// "Strange as it may appear, Mr. Savarkar and Mr. Jinnah, instead of being opposed to each other on the one nation versus two nations issue, are in complete agreement about it. Both agree, not only agree but insist, that there are two nations in India—one the Muslim nation and the other the Hindu nation. **They differ only as regards the terms and conditions on which the two nations should live**. Mr. Jinnah says India should be cut up into two, Pakistan and Hindustan, the Muslim nation to occupy Pakistan and the Hindu nation to occupy Hindustan. **Mr. Savarkar on the other hand insists that, although there are two nations in India, India shall not be divided into two parts, one for Muslims and the other for the Hindus; that the two nations shall dwell in one country and shall live under the mantle of one single constitution; that the constitution shall be such that the Hindu nation will be enabled to occupy a predominant position that is due to it and the Muslim nation made to live in the position of subordinate co-operation with the Hindu nation.**"\n\nNo surprise the great Muhammad Ali Jinnah didn\'t agree to such a proposal.\n\nKhan Abdul Gaffar Khan was not convinced by the two-nation theory and wanted a single united India as home for both Hindus and Muslims.\n\n\nEven the toothless tiger Mohandas Gandhi held this view about 2NT:\n\n**I find no parallel in history for a body of converts and their descendants claiming to be a nation apart from the parent stock.**\n\n\nThis is the whole situation of the 2NT. Congress\' claims that Savarkar proposed and agreed to partition of Bharat is a truckload of bullshit. This is only to character-assassinate a true freedom fighter.\n\nOf note here are the views of Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman (first president of Pakistan Muslim League) post-partition:\n\n/// The two-nation theory, which we had used in the fight for Pakistan, had created not only bad blood against the Muslims of the minority provinces, but also an ideological wedge, between them and the Hindus of India. He (Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy) doubted the utility of the two-nation theory, which to my mind also had never paid any dividends to us, but after the partition, it proved positively injurious to the Muslims of India, and on a long-view basis for Muslims everywhere. ///\n\n\nRest of the article is not worth a mention. \n\nI hope you\'ll feel enriched after reading this post.

      <li>Title::: 'Why Leftist fear True Indology?'<br />Body: 'From a Twitter thread: https://twitter.com/aparnapera/status/1206261078994219009\n\n1) Prof. Romila Thapar rubbishes authors like Sanjeev Sanyal who present an alternative view to Indian History as ‘Untrained’. When a history professor  from Kakatiya University, Y. Sudarshan Rao was appointed as the head of ICHR, \n\n2) Prof. Thapar and her cronies like Prof. Irfan Habib–had serious objections as Prof. Sudarshan Rao didn’t have too many research-papers published in International Journals, besides the fact that Prof. Rao vehemently supports ‘indigenous Aryan theory; as opposed to AMT or AIT\n\n3) So, for the uninitiated, it may appear Prof. Thapar may perhaps be right as she has published dozens and dozens of papers in reputed international journals. So why exactly Prof. Sudarshan Rao-likes fail to publish as many papers?\n\n4) Peer-reviewed Journals and Leftists.\nAt the outset, one needs to understand all reputed Journals are peer-reviewed;\n\n5) meaning any research-paper submitted to any reputed journal will be referred to a select set of individual professors who are registered as subject-matter-experts on chosen subject. \n\n6) For ex: any paper written on Indian history would be referred to a set of Indologists. However, a good 90% plus of such Indologists tend to be Marxists and communists, sometimes disguised as moderate democrats in US or as Labour supporters in UK.\n\n7) The typical examples? Dr. Audrey Truschke , Dr. Wendy Doniger etc..\n\nSo, effectively any research-paper with an alternative-view will never see the light of the day.\n\n8) Why so many Historians-Indologists are Leftists?\n \nOne needs to go back 70 years + to understand the reasons: As NATO used to advertise during the cold-war, Communist Russia was the only country which came-out of second world-war with a larger area than they originally had.\n\n9) However, NATO could effectively resist expansion of communism to just a few countries in East-Europe beyond erstwhile USSR.\n \nAs a strategy, communists focused on two specific areas in NATO countries where they can quickly mold and influence Public-opinion.\n\n10) The first was “Academics” and the second was “Media”. In Academics, Leftists have no interest in Science, and Technology or Medicine.\n\n11) They loved Humanities though; specifically, History. Over a period of time, the left dominance grew so much that the doors in Humanities were closed for anyone who is not a leftist.\n\n12) Any rare specimen with opposing-views who manages to get a toehold is either discredited, tortured or thrown-out. (an example closer home was Prof. Meenakshi Jain)\n\n13) In 2016 a survey carried out by Econ Journal Watch looked at the voter registration of faculty members at 40 leading US universities in the fields of economics, history, law, psychology and journalism/communications.\n\n14) It found that Democrats outnumber Republicans by an average of 11.5 to one. In psychology, the ratio is 17.4 to one; in history, 33.5 to one.  (Source: https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/09/the-neo-marxist-takeover-of-our-universities/)\n\n15) Those of you who are interested in may also refer the sources below:\n1. Academic Freedom and Communist Professors   (Paul F. Boller, Jr., The Christian Scholar, Vol. 42, No. 1 (MARCH 1959), pp. 16-29) https://www.jstor.org/stable/41177112?seq=1\n\n16) 2.

By Croatian journalist Damir Pilić – (https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2015/11/lost-marxists-what-happened-academics-made-jobless-communism-s-collapse)\n\n17) **So, Why fear handles like TRUE-INDOLOGY ?\n\nBecause @TIinExile quotes “Original Sources” extensively and no-one including the eminent historians can deny them without looking like complete fools.**\n\n18) So far there was no authentic way to completely debunk the likes of Prof.  Romila Thapar and Irfan Habib. Earlier authors like Sitaram Goel had very limited readership.\n\n19) Modern day authors like Sanjeev Sanyal and Dr. AR. Ranganathan have substantial readership and following, but do not necessarily quote “original sources”.\n\n20) So; WHAT do the leftists do? \n\nSince they cannot refute on the merits of the content, they attack the individual, they call him names, and denounce him without giving reasons… and somehow hope they can shout-him down.\n\n21) Thank You True-Indology 🙏🏻   A few more like you, and the leftist eminent historians will be HISTORY!!'<br />Author: 'bafffee'  id: 'eb9na4'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eb9na4/why_leftist_fear_true_indology/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'An Agnostic questions His Holiness Dalai Lama'<br />Body: 'Copy pasting an essay from the book **On Religion: Selected Writings** by *Khushwant Singh*\n\n---\n\nI arrived in Dharamsala where the Dalai Lama is in residence since his exile from Tibet. The upper part of the mountain range known as McLeodganj has become a little Tibet in India: Tibetan schools, libraries, a medical institute, a separate township for 1,500 children, temples, and over fifty restaurants serving Tibetan food. You hear more Tibetan spoken than the local Pahadi dialect of Kangra.\nBefore I tell you of my question-and-answer session, let me tell you of the Dalai Lama’s background. He was one of sixteen children of a peasant family of eastern Tibet of which only seven survived their infancy. At the age of two he was picked up by the national committee charged with the duty of finding the incarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama who had died in 1933. Two years later he was brought to Lhasa, proclaimed His Holiness Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama. However odd this system of locating successors may sound to sceptical ears, it has an enormous advantage over other political or social systems: from childhood a boy is trained to take over the responsibilities of a spiritual and secular leader of his people. He does not have to be the eldest son of a king to become the Prince of Wales nor the son of a president or a prime minister to be the heir presumptive. By the time he takes over his responsibilities, he is fully acquainted with his job. Tibetan Buddhism does not separate politics from religion. The 14th Dalai Lama is Tibet’s secular and spiritual monarch.\nI waited my turn to be received. A group of monks came out with a boy of five with his head shaved. He had been discovered as a reincarnation of another lama and initiated by His Holiness. A German couple waiting before us in the queue were ushered in. Fifteen minutes later we were asked to go in. The Dalai Lama stood outside his reception room—a tall, powerfully built man wreathed in smiles of welcome. We presented the traditional silk scarfs, shook hands and were escorted to our seats.\n‘Your Holiness, I am not going to ask you about politics. My questions will be on matters of religion. I am an agnostic and they may sound impertinent. I ask to be forgiven before I begin.’\nHe laughed uproariously and took my hand. ‘In that case I can relax. I have to be very careful about politics: you may ask what you like.’\nI had my list of questions ready: How did life originate? Is there a God? If so, why is there so much injustice and wickedness in the world? Are there rewards and punishments for good or evil deeds done in life? What is death—the destruction of body and mind or only the body? Is there a life hereafter or a rebirth after death?\nMy first question to the Dalai Lama was his view of the origin of life on our planet. Did he accept the Judeo-Christian-Muslim belief of it being created by a Supreme God? Or did he accept Darwin’s Theory of Evolution: not from divine but natural causes—from amoeba to fish to land creatures, birds, mammals, monkeys down to man? There is also the intermediate theory put forward by Hinduism and its off-shoots (Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism) of order emerging from chaos by the intervention of divinity in the form of a Creator, Preserver and Destroyer.\n‘As a Buddhist as well as personally I do not accept the theory of a divine Creator of life,’ replied the Dalai Lama. ‘The real creator is one’s own mind. The universe and all its galaxies were created or happened at a certain period of time.’ He was not precise about the time or the causes which brought it about but once life evolved in its different manifestations, their forms were determined by karmas—deeds. He then added: ‘Buddhist scriptures maintain that certain sections of humanity are different from others. In Tibetan mythology there is a story that the Tibetan race came into being through the mating of a monkey and an ethereal being.’ You can see an element of Darwinism in this legend which describes the evolution of a race from an earthy and a celestial being.\nThe Dalai Lama also accepted the possibility of virgin birth. ‘In my generation and even earlier there were instances of women who had not been near a man conceiving. Conception was preceded by strange dreams. The offspring of such virgin births were extremely powerful and mentally advanced beings.’\nThe Dalai Lama repeated that he did not accept the notion of a creator God. Life came into being through a mysterious and subtle energy. Some people were more evolved than others; the greater majority evolved as Darwin spelt out in his Theory of Evolution.\nI did not fully comprehend his line of argument, as at times for loss of the right word he broke into Tibetan and had to be translated into English. I went on to my next question: ‘Even if you do not credit God with creation, do you believe in God as an omnipotent and compassionate reality?’\n‘God in the Christian sense and as some other religions see it as someone Supreme and Almighty, we Buddhist do not accept,’ said the Dalai Lama categorically.\n‘What then do you accept as God?’ I asked him. He paused a long time. I prodded him further: ‘Do you regard Him as compassionate?’\nMy question had to be translated into Tibetan before he replied. ‘You know the three pillars of our faith, the Buddha, the Dhamma (Dharma) and the Sangha (Community).’\nI nodded.\n‘For us the Buddha is a higher being, one who has reached the highest stage (of evolvement). His mind has been completely purified of all dross. The Buddha was not there from the very beginning; he became one after he had purified his mind, rid it of negative thoughts and ignorance till they totally disappeared.’\nHe elucidated his views further. ‘He was very much like ourselves to start with. Like students in a class are equals when they start. As they learn, differences develop. Some acquire knowledge and become teachers. There is a lot of difference between a teacher and a student. We regard the Sakyamuni as a teacher not a Creator.’\nMy next question was based on the wrong assumption that the Dalai Lama would accept the existence of a creator, an all-powerful and just God. He did not. Nevertheless, I put it to him: ‘Can you explain why there is so much injustice and cruelty in the world? Why do bad things happen to good people?’\nThe great stumbling block in the way of people who believe that God is both all-powerful as well as just is the prevalence of injustice and cruelty in the world. Why, for instance, have a God-fearing people like the Tibetans had to flee their country and 95,000 of them forced to live in exile in India? I put the dilemma to the Dalai Lama.\n‘We Buddhist believe in Karma,’ he replied. ‘Life is a continuous circle without a beginning or an end. Deeds done in one life, one’s Karmas, determine one’s fate in the next. Even in one’s lifetime bad deeds produce bad effects.’\nI was not convinced. ‘Does your Holiness believe that the entire Tibetan people are being punished for deeds done in the previous lives?’\n‘Yes,’ he responded without pause. ‘There is individual Karma and common Karma. The present travails of the Tibetan people are due to both kinds of Karmas. Some for acts done by individuals at some time or place, now come together in common suffering.’\nI did not buy the explanation. ‘Your Holiness, I am a sceptic and an agnostic. I find no rational basis for accepting the theory of Karma and rebirths nor the system of rewards and punishments in heaven or hell. There is no scientific basis for accepting one or the other.’\nThe Dalai Lama laughed heartily. ‘Scientific proof is what you want?’ he asked. ‘But certain things are beyond scientific proof. I have many thoughts going on in my mind, it is difficult to give scientific explanations for them. Every particle of the body and mind is changing all the time, but none of these changes can be measured by computers.’\nI protested. ‘Since you cannot adduce rational, scientific explanations for certain phenomenon, wouldn’t it be more truthful to say “I don’t know”? As for me, I go further and say not only I do not know the answers, nobody else knows them either.’\nThe Dalai Lama stuck to his ground. ‘There are two kinds phenomena. One are provable by science; the second are beyond the realm of scientific proof. But that does not mean they do not exist. Only scientists do not as yet know about them.’\n‘Then why not say that till such time as the scientists have found out we withhold our judgement.’\n‘I agree. Buddhism is quite clear on the subject: investigate till you find out the right answers. Do not accept anything and take it for granted. The Buddha himself said, “Do not accept anything said by me out of respect for me. If it does not appeal to you, reject it.”’\n‘Would you extend the scope of inquiry to basic Buddhist beliefs like Karma and life hereafter?’ I asked him.\n‘Yes,’ replied the Dalai Lama. ‘If scientists can prove that there is no next life, we Buddhists will accept it.’\n‘Why then persist in propagating unprovable theories till we can prove them?’ I persisted.\nThe Dalai Lama pondered over the question for a while before replying. ‘If you don’t accept the past or the future, you are only left with this life. You can trace it back to your parents, grandparents back to millions of years back to the amoeba and further back to empty space. Then you either accept the Almighty creator and land yourself in more contradictions and more questions. How did it happen? The Buddhist concept of a beginningless beginning, continuity of consciousness and Karma, coming and going from to time till the space article came into existence avoids these contradictions.’\nWe went on to other questions, like why wickedness so often triumphs over goodness, why innocent people suffer while evil people prosper. Instead of the half hour allotted to me, the interview went on to one hour and a half. The tape ran out. As did his secretary’s patience. There were other visitors waiting to see the Dalai Lama.\nWe took our leave. I was exhilarated by being with him. He extended that aura of goodwill, cheerfulness and crystal-clear honesty that envelops you long after you have left his presence. The Nobel Prize committee has done well in awarding him the peace prize because he is a man of peace. He has suffered many wrongs but never uttered an angry word in protest. He has brought solace to millions of people who are troubled by the way the world is going today.\n\n(end)'<br />Author: 'ILikeMultisToo'  id: 'eb1ylc'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eb1ylc/an_agnostic_questions_his_holiness_dalai_lama/</li>

At Kurla, which was a training camp to select ‘future Congress leaders’, Gadgil launched a scathing frontal attack on Congress policymakers. He observed, ‘Every time the Shahi Imam makes a statement, the party reacts as if God himself has spoken. Do minorities mean only Muslims? What about Buddhists, Sikhs and others? When thirty-six Sikhs were killed in Kashmir, not a single Congressman condoled over their deaths. In Jammu and Kashmir, there is not a single Buddhist working in the state secretariat. The only Buddhist who was selected through the state public service commission had to convert to Islam to secure a government job... The Congress is silent on this.’\n\n‘While appeasing Muslims, we should not forget Hindus, who are a majority in this state,’ Gadgil said, pointing at an article published in The Economist, which stated that ‘Islam and democracy do not go together’. Quoting from the article, Gadgil said a province in China which had a substantial Muslim population wanted to break away and form a separate nation. When Gadgil was asked why he was saying all this, he said: ‘I have said this earlier. Muslims constitute only 18 per cent of the vote share. Even if all of them vote for the Congress, the party will not return to power. We cannot go on ignoring the sentiments of the other 82 per cent.’\n\n[Source](https://www.orfonline.org/research/wooing-the-minority-overlooking-indias-hindu-majority-was-only-one-reason-why-congress-missed-the-bus-to-power-51561/)'<br />Author: 'rdm234'  id: 'eao6f5'<br />Score:31<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eao6f5/when_a_congressman_warned_his_party_members_about/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Countering the misinformation regarding CAB protests in NE India (especially Assam).'<br />Body: 'I have observed a lot of misinformation in this sub recently regarding the right of the Assamese and the other NE state citizens who are protesting against CAB. The people not intimate with the region have upvoted said posts believing them to be representative of the truth. As a person of Bengali of Sylheti origin who has lived a major portion of his life in Assam and other NE states, I want to show that this protest against CAB is nothing but a thinly veiled attack against Bengalis in the region. These protests are not about protecting the rights of indigenous people of the region, but about denying other indigenous people the same rights which they profess to uphold.\n\nThe Sylhet (and Greater Bengal) region of undivided India has always been intertwined with the NE regions. The connection with Assam was deeper still, with the priests of Kamakhya temple being Bengalis (mentioned in *R.M. Lahiri, The Annexation of Assam*) and Bengali upper castes sharing kinship with the Assamese ones. The Bengali and Assamese scripts are almost interchangeable to this day.\n\nSylhet is a fertile province, with rolling hills, plenty of water, large rivers, lush tea gardens and large natural gas deposits. Sylhetis, while Bengalis, still preserve their ethno-linguistic identity as a Sylheti as being different from the rest of the Bengali speaking people. In 1874, the Sylhet region was bundled with Assam by the British to further their administrative power in the region.   Nearly three-quarters of all Bengalis in Assam after this relocation  were Sylhetis. This, in turn, gave rise to a demand among Assam’s  Assamese leaders to reverse the situation and lob Sylhet back to Bengal  in order to given Assam a more homogeneous linguistic character.\n\nAfter the Sylhet referendum, Sylhet was awarded to then East Pakistan.\n\n&gt;**But the Assamese people in general greeted this loss and the Assam press  projected it as a gain.** This attitude, somewhat unusual in the context  of the national aspiration of the period, has its origins in what can be  called the long-cherished quest of the Assamese – carving out a  homogenous province for themselves. The Assamese perceived the partition  of 1947 as a god-sent opportunity to attain that goal. In fact, the  Assamese Congress leaders were sowing the seeds for subsequent  manoeuvres in this direction well before the partition plan was  announced. Lord Wavell, the Viceroy, wrote in his journal as early as  April 1946, that **Gopinath Bordoloi, the Congress Premier of Assam, gave  the Cabinet Mission to understand that ‘Assam would be quite prepared to  hand over Sylhet to Eastern Bengal.’**   \n&gt;  \n&gt; Bordoloi wrote to Sardar Patel on 18 February 1948:  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;‘Maulana Sahib (e.g. Azad) seemed to come to the conclusion that the  only alternative to this state of things is to separate the Bengali  district of Sylhet and a portion of Cachar from Assam and join these  with Bengal – a consummation to which the Assamese people are looking  forward for the last 70 years.’2  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Assam Pradesh Congress Committee in 1945, in its election manifesto, stated:  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;‘Unless the province of Assam is organised on the basis of Assamese  language and Assamese culture, the survival of the Assamese nationality  and culture will become impossible. The inclusion of Bengali speaking  Sylhet and Cachar and immigration or importation of lacs of Bengali  settlers on wastelands has been threatening to destroy the  distinctiveness of Assam and has, in practice, caused many disorders in  its administration.’  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Of course, the partition of India was yet a far cry in 1946 and the  Congress high command allowed the Assam Congress to air the proposal for  the transfer of Sylhet to Bengal only as a part of a futuristic plan  for a reorganisation of the provinces within undivided India. But in  June 1947, the situation was totally different. The transfer of Sylhet  to Bengal now meant its transfer to East Pakistan and the Congress high  command could in no way sponsor such a proposal.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But to the Assam Congress it did not matter whether Sylhet went to  Pakistan or remained in India. The Bengali speaking district was  regarded as an ulcer hindering the emergence of a unilingual Assam.  Hence, when the decision for the referendum was announced, Gopinath  Bordoloi, conveyed to all concerned, that the Cabinet was not interested  in retaining Sylhet.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;‘It was indeed the lifetime opportunity for the Assamese leadership "to  get rid of Sylhet" and carve out a linguistically more homogenous  province. When the results of the referendum were declared, there was a  feeling of relief in the Brahmaputra valley. The Sylhet leaders were  discouraged when they tried to salvage a portion of the district through  an effective representation to the Boundary Commission.’3  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The partition of the country, for the Assamese leaders, was perceived  not as a tragic development but as a ‘god-sent opportunity to carve out a  linguistically homogenous province.’** Since then more than fifty years  have elapsed, but Partition has continued to retain these perceived  significances in Assam. In 1947, Partition facilitated the ouster of  Sylhet, but in isolation this proved to be insufficient for delivering  the desired homogeneity. The need arose to evolve a new strategy and  here again ‘partition’ came handy. In fact, the foreigner issue,  projected as the core question associated with the survival of the  Assamese nationality, has drawn its entire rationale from Partition. In  other words, had there been no partition, there would not have been any  ‘foreigner issue’ in Assam.   \n&gt;  \n&gt; On 20 July 1947, just 20 days before Independence, Birinchikumar Barua,  reputed litterateur and historian of Assam, put forward a candid version  of the popular perception of an immigrant:  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;‘Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. Culturally, racially, and  linguistically, every non-Assamese is a foreigner in Assam. **In this  connection we must bear in mind that Assam from the very ancient times  never formed a part of India.’**   \n&gt;  \n&gt; To add to this, many Muslim Bengalis in post-Partition Assam cited their  mother tongue as Assamese to census officials. As a result, the 1951  Census said that Assamese speakers had grown by  150% compared to 1931. **Since Muslim Bengalis were economically and  educationally backward at the time, an alliance with them suited the  Assamese elite who were competing with the elite Hindu Bengalis.** \n\nComing to the present day, CAB is an act which seeks to remedy a historical wrong, which was committed for the pursuance of a mono-linguistic state, a mirage which is unattainable in Assam. Bengalis are the only major group in the NE who have not taken up arms against the Indian state, for any reason.\n\nI myself come from a family of refugees who migrated to India in the late 1940\'s. Where I currently reside is 80 km far from my ancestral home, which lies in Bangladesh. An imaginary line through a map does not nullify my history or ancestry. I am as much a *Khilonjiya or a Bhumiputra* as you, who like most Assamese, migrated to present day Assam in the 12th century from Burma. I implore you to give up this undue hate and let us build a prosperous North East, which isn\'t a burden on India (as it currently is) but a jewel in its feather.\n\nThe referendum debacle in Sylhet is another long post, which I may tackle later. Same stands for the situation in Tripura and Meghalaya.\n\nSome Sources:\n\n1.

(Aside: I am sure that the tribals have to be exempted in some way; they should not need any documentation at all). But majority will be able to get it if they were born in India. The same thing happened in Assam as well. A fair NRC process will be a pain in the ass for everyone, but in the end it will net all illegal muslim immigrants. \n\nThat's one reason why Indian Muslims should be circumspect of the propaganda surrounding CAB and NRC. If they demand inclusion of Muslims in CAB, they will end up proving the allegation on them they do not act in national interest. Something everybody agrees on is that illegal immigration is bad for our country; both economically and security wise. Indian Muslims are better off compared to Pakistan and Bangladesh (except now [BD is beating India](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmOfSlxEPBc) hands down). I am sure the moderate Muslims know that.

Along with elephant, peacock, monkey, cobra, it is one of the most recognized animals in Indian wildlife and culture. \n\nBut if you look at Hinduism, there aren't many positive depictions of the tiger. Goddess Durga is portrayed to sit on a tiger, symbolizing that she managed to tame it. Even in the famous colonial novel, Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling, Shere Khan is the villain, the enemy of man. We don't have such negative depictions about the lion. Generally, they're known to be strong and brave. The lord Himself comes in the Avatar of half-lion, half-man to save his baktha. \n\n**I think it has a lot to do with the nature of tigers.** Unlike lions, tigers are solitary and stealth predators. They even kill their own siblings. Our ancestors were probably so terrified that they hated such an animal; because many of their family members probably lost lives due to a split second tiger bite on the neck. Lions on the other hand are the most social of all big cats, which is why they live in packs. Humans are social too, so we could relate to them better, and hence admired and revered them."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'ea2p29'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ea2p29/have_you_ever_wondered_why_we_dont_have_a_tiger/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Hindutva actually means "Secularism"'<br />Body: 'During freedom struggle many things were churning out. One was the Hindu-Muslim divide. In those days Jinnah and alike were keen on putting Islamic beliefs on their top priority. If you read out History he had always put forward Muslims interest first rather than freeing this country. Their outcome were always through the lens of Islamic beliefs. That was the real fundamentalism. Due to rise of Caliphate which brought Muslims under one roof, Savarkar must have thought about bringing up Hindu ethos to counter that fundamentalism in those days. So I think that is why there was a need to unite the secular beliefs which accepts other faiths as equals and have the answer to counter the fundamentalists of this country. Whatever media and so called marxist historians have described Hindutva is outright lies and distortions. The Courts have also clearly mentioned what "Hindutva" means. This land had always accepted other faiths equally. There was mutual understanding that is why we are able to see so much diversity around us. But we never tried to define it as it was ingrained in our beliefs and culture. Just like there was no religion "Hindu" but we accepted it now, "Hindutva" is about the ideology which believes in plurality and diverse nature of human consciousness. "Secularism" word has come to us in English form but we always had "Hindutva" which was secularism in real sense. \n\nSecularism = Hindutva'<br />Author: 'ksot9635'  id: 'ea2cs4'<br />Score:27<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ea2cs4/hindutva_actually_means_secularism/</li>

Clearly it's working well and together, they've achieved national and subcontinental domination. \n\nThese are just my speculations, but I think Mr. Modi is a narcissist while Mr. Shah is a psychopath. Hear me out, there's nothing wrong in being that way, in fact I'd be worried if they're anything else. Nice people ruling India will cause India to be manipulated, dominated and controlled by outside forces. In case you didn't know, most CEOs and world leaders are in the Narcissistic-Psychopathic spectrum. \n\nI think Mr. Modi is specifically a grandiose narcissist, which means he's very extroverted, low in neuroticism, overty expresses feelings of greatness, superiority and entitlement and demands constant attention and admiration. Mr. Shah on the other hand is probably what psychologists would call as the puppet master. These are people who don't end up in jail like less intelligent psychopaths who resort to fraud or intimidation. They can easily manipulate without anyone knowing and would score very high in the psychopathy checklist (btw, Chanakya is also probably a psychopath). \n\nIf I am right, then it'd be interesting to see how their relationship develops in the future. Typically, a psychopath is only loyal to one person, themselves; they're incapable of forming close bonds.

      <li>Title::: 'How does Monsoon influence Indian culture?'<br />Body: "Monsoon is clearly a unique phenomenon for the Subcontinent. Among all types, the Indian monsoon is particularly special because without it, India would be a barren wasteland like the Sahara or Arabian desert. To a certain degree, we could call the Indian civilization as a monsoon civilization and Hinduism as a monsoon religion, because its influence is that enormous.\n\nI'll list down a few ideas to support my point, feel free to add in if you have a few points yourself.\n\n1) Religion - I think it's Sanjeev Sanyal who mentioned that Hindus derived the idea of reincarnation through observing the monsoon cycles. It makes sense because plants and animal life flourish right after the monsoon months, then slowly as the season gets to summer, many would rot or die. Perhaps that's also how early Indians got the idea of Dhyana and Moksha; if you could struggle and live through the scorching heat of the summer months, then you get to enjoy the monsoon and winter months; struggle now for salvation later. \n\n2) Geopolitics - India's political map is heavily influenced by geography and monsoon particularly influences India's North and Northwestern border. I think it's no coincidence that the spread of Islamic Caliphate over a Millenia ago stopped at Pakistan while most Indian empires didn't manage to spread so far beyond Pakistan for a long time. This is because people who live in monsoon climate are culturally different to those outside of it; you can invade a stranger's land but there's no use if they don't understand &amp; don't do what you say. In this aspect, Pakistan is actually a buffer zone between India and desert chaos. \n\n3) National politics - It's also no coincidence that most of the regions in the Indian Subcontinent became unified into one country instead of Balkanizing. Some may dispute that by saying that India was never unified before independence, but it actually was even during colonial times. The Mughals and British did control most of the Subcontinent; it wouldn't be possible if the people were so different to each other. \n\nI think I wrote too much already. Would be interested to know what you think about the subject and how you think monsoon influences you day-to-day life."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'ea1lj8'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ea1lj8/how_does_monsoon_influence_indian_culture/</li>

It was a mass students movement which were led by student leaders. This ended up in signing of the Assam Accord which was signed by the GOI and the Assam Agitation leaders in the presence of then PM Rajiv Gandhi ji in 1985.\n\nClause 5.8 of section 5 states - 5.8  Foreigners who came to Assam on or after March 25, 1971 shall continue to be detected, deleted and expelled in accordance with law. Immediate and practical steps shall be taken to expel such foreigners.\n\nHowever, CAB will give citizenship to every foreigner ( Hindu refugee as the govt says ) who came to Assam from 1971 - 2014. \n\nThis is a direct violation of clause 5.8 of Assam Accord. The Assamese people feel betrayed. Their identity as a community is at stake.\n\nHence protests are going on in Assam. However, in mainstream media, the real magnitude of protests isn’t  being shown. Students have forsaken their end semester exams to protest. Army has taken to area domination patrols. Internet has been cut off to silence Assam. People are running of food in their homes. Universities have been locked down, students trapped in it. Shops haven’t opened in a week. Normal life has come to a standstill.\n\nAssam really needs prayers.  Lots of it.

It also seeks to relax the requirement of residence in India for citizenship by naturalisation from 11 years to 5 years for these migrants. Immediate beneficiaries of the Bill, according to IB records, will be **just over 30,000 people**\n\nNow considering that a large majority of the illegal immigrants from Bangladesh have been Muslims, it brings to question the whole point of these protests. Particularly when CAB explicitly states it won\'t be legalizing the citizenship of Muslim immigrants, those who have settled here or those who are seeking asylum currently. \n\nThese politically motivated protests seems to be fighting a problem that isn\'t even there. \n\nMore importantly, once these immigrants belonging to persecuted minorities are made legal, they become citizens of India. Which means after that point, NE or anyone else will have **NO** say in where they\'re settled. \n\nThe CAB is **not** against Muslims, it\'s *for* persecuted minorities in Islamic countries .

But are rituals still relevant or is it just like a blind man carrying a lamp?*  \n\n\n**Story:** A blind man stayed with his friend for a few days, and then started for his hometown in the night. His friend gave him a lit lantern, but the man protested, "Why do I need a lantern? Everything is the same for me. For someone who is blind, what is the use of carrying a lamp?"\n\n"My dear friend, this is not for you; this is for the person who comes in front of you. If you have this lamp in your hand, the person who comes in front of you will not bump into you."\n\n"In that case, I will take it," the blind man said.\n\nHe took the lamp and started walking in the dark. In spite of that, someone collided into him head-on down the road. The blind man lost his balance and fell down. He got angry and asked, "Why did you bump into me? I had a lamp with me - can\'t you watch where you’re going?"\n\n"What lamp? I don’t see anything," said the man who bumped into him and looked around.\n\nThen he found the lamp and said, "Oh yes! There is a lamp here, but the flame had gone out long ago, my dear friend."\n\n**Sadhguru:** The man held the lamp in his hands for the light it gave. Holding it high and walking even after the flame died out is just a meaningless ritual. Many things that we started in our life with a purpose have lost their original quality and are continuing as mere rituals.\n\nThere is a certain tradition in Karnataka. If non-vegetarian food is served to a guest at someone’s home, they will keep a pestle next to the leaf on which food is served. I asked many people the reason for this, but they did not know. After asking several elderly people who were well-versed in the culture, I found out the answer.\n\nEarlier, the tradition was to keep a small stick next to the leaf as a toothpick, in case the person got something stuck between his teeth. As time went by, they replaced the tiny toothpick with a stick and then some fool started putting a pestle instead of a stick. Later, this became the standard practice without anyone asking for an explanation. Can anyone use a pestle as a toothpick?\n\nThis is how we create certain processes to benefit our lives. But when we forget why these processes were fundamentally created and start following things simply because our grandfathers and fathers did it, it becomes a mere ritual. Because we do not understand why something was done in our tradition generation after generation, we are confused about whether it is needed for our life or not.\n\nLike a blind man carrying a lamp, certain tools that were created to guide us in our lives have become superstitions. It is high time we understand their true purpose and make them into lamps to guide us in our lives. Otherwise, we should at least create new tools to guide us.'<br />Author: 'exotictantra'  id: 'e9ubrb'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e9ubrb/because_we_do_not_understand_why_something_was/</li>

CAB affects immigrants/refugees, not Indian Citizens - whether Hindu, Muslim, Sikh etc.\n\n2. CAB is for refugees who came into India from Pakistan/Bangladesh/Afghanistan, not any other nation.\n\n3. CAB is only for those refugees who came into India before Dec 31 2014, not after.\n\n4. CAB is only for those refugees who came to India based on religious persecution reasons in those 3 countries, not economic/political/personal reasons.\n\n\n***What does CAB do ?***\n\n1. CAB reduces the waiting time for citizenship from the usual 11 years to 5 years for Hindu/Buddhist/Sikh/Parsi/Christian refugees\n\n2. CAB keeps waiting time at the usual 11 years for Muslim refugees\n\n3. CAB does not deny citizenship to any refugee - whether they are Muslim/Hindu, whether they came for religious/economic reasons.\n\n***Why does CAB differentiate based on religion?***\n\n1. CAB is designed to help minorities - based on *definition*. Pakistan/Bangladesh/Afghanistan are 'Islamist Republics' based on their constitution. Hence other religions are considered secondary/minority to Islam.\n\n2. CAB is meant to help minorities - based on *population*. Those 3 countries have religious minority population between 3-10%. During 1971 Pakistan-Bangladesh liberation, Hindu population was ~25% in Bangladesh. Currently it is ~10%\n\n3. CAB is designed to help minorities - based on *persecution*. Minorities in those 3 countries have historically faced trauma - conversion, exodus, rape &amp; murder.\n\n***Why does CAB differentiate based on country?***\n\n1. 4 other neighbors - Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar - have a 'secular' constitution. While they may have a dominant religion (like Buddhism), and while the minority religions may be ill-treated occasionally, such persecution does not have State sanction and could be just the result of a particular government's policies.\n\n2. CAB does not deal with religious minorities of other nations - the goal of first iteration is to start by helping refugees from neighboring countries.\n\n\n***Does CAB violate constitution, especially Article 14 &amp; 15 ?***\n1. Article 14 - The State shall not deny to any person equality* before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India\n\n  *equality - subject to [reasonable classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_14_of_the_Constitution_of_India)\n\n  e.g. Prime Minister and common man have different powers. This is not a violation of equality because PM requires extra powers to fulfill the office's duties and to enjoy its benefits.  \ne.g. SC/ST and other castes have different reservations. This is not a violation of equality because SC/ST require extra reservations to correct historical wrongs and to uplift.\n\n  [Basically, 'Equal' does not mean 'Same'](https://i.imgur.com/9Mh5jPF.png).\n\n  Similarly, Minorities (Hindu/Buddhist/Sikh/Parsi/Christian) and Muslims have different citizenship requirements. This is not a violation of equality because religiously persecuted minorities require faster citizenship to raise their standard of living which was denied in those 3 countries.\n\n  Thus Article 14 is **NOT** violated.\n\n\n2. Article 15 - The State shall not discriminate against any citizen* on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them\n\n  *citizen - CAB does not affect citizens (see very first point above). Discrimination (positive) is applied to refugees (non-citizens), which is within right of law/government.\n\n  Thus Article 15 is **NOT** violated.\n\n\n***Why does CAB exclude Muslim minorities like Shia/Ahmediyas/Rohingyas ?***\n\nFactions within a particular religion fall under theological debate and are outside scope of CAB.  \nCAB does not differentiate among Hindus (Shaiva/Vaishnava, Brahmin/Dalit), nor among Christians (Catholic/Protestant), nor among Muslims (Shia/Sunni)\n\n***Why are NE people, especially Assamese protesting CAB?***\n\nAssamese are afraid of losing their indigenous culture to large number of refugees. Whether the refugees or Hindus or Muslims does not matter.\n\n***Is CAB against Muslims?***\n\nAgainst Indian Muslims ? NO. No current Indian citizen will be asked to prove citizenship.\n\nAgainst Refugee Muslims ? NO. No refugee Muslim is denied citizenship, nor their waiting time is increased.\n\nFor Refugee Minorities ? YES. Waiting time of citizenship is reduced."<br />Author: 'waeva'  id: 'e9qhvb'<br />Score:286<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e9qhvb/cab_in_simple_words/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Is India increasingly following Israel in many of its policies?'<br />Body: "If you'd ask me, why not? Because out of all the developed (high-income) countries out there, Israel has by far the closest resemblance to India, in the following areas:\n\n1. Religion - Judaism and Hinduism are similar such that most adherents are of the same ethnicity, because they don't convert. Plus, they're known to represent one country. Israel is obviously famous for being a Jewish state, does that give any ideas for the BJP? Only time will tell.\n2. Immigration - Because Israel is non-secular, it could use immigration to balance its demographic challenges. High Arab and Muslim birth rates are being offset by continuous immigration of Jews to Israel from all around the world, and they get citizenship pretty quickly. Looks like that's also the direction India is going to take. \n3. Disputed territories - Actually, for Kashmir, I think India learned more from Xinjiang, China and Cechnya, Russia instead of West Bank, Israel. But still, India could learn a lot on how manage an incredibly hostile populace. Perhaps Israeli settlements program would be emulated for Kashmiri Pandit resettlement? \n4. Demography - India actually has about the same population density as Israel. That means in a lot of sectors, such as housing, transport, water, sanitation, etc, India could learn a lot from Israel. Also, do you know that a large percentage of Israelis are also vegetarians?\n5. Industry - Israel is a tech giant despite being a small country and a major defense supplier. Both are industries that India wants to develop by a great degree. \n\nIt just baffles me as to how closely Israel resembles India. Israel is like what India wants to develop to be in the future, just in a much much bigger size."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'e9nu6d'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e9nu6d/is_india_increasingly_following_israel_in_many_of/</li>
