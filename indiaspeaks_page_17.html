      <li>Title::: 'Rant'<br />Body: 'The Indian is an obsequious sycophant who will stoop down to any level to garner a slight pay gain. In a field of war, the Indian will betray you for nothing more than a few rupees. The Indian will bow down to western propaganda citing that his religion is progressive. The Indian will not improve his own surroundings, claiming that the neighboring city or state is in a substandard condition compared to his.\n\nThe conservative Indian does not conserve anything. He blames all his tribulations on the Muslims while he bends over backwards to accommodate for the lies of the Jews. The liberal Indian is the knife that twists into the shoulder of the motherland, he will go out of his way to vilify you on the basis of your religion. The liberal Indian thinks only about showcasing his false altruism, he partakes in fraudulent charity events and introduces children to homosexual degeneracy. When countered with the argument that homosexuality is hedonistic, he will state that Hinduism supported homosexuality before the onset of the British.\n\nThe Indian will never blame himself for his own wrongdoings, in terms of economic redundancy, he inculpates the British Raj. He will curse the British for destroying his nation, but he does not have the temerity to blame the debauchers who sold them out in the first place.'<br />Author: 'Agnostic_monk7'  id: 'og1gn9'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/og1gn9/rant/</li>

These were facilitated by low taxes and incentives for select industries. Huge public sector companies provided world-class infrastructure — ports, water, electricity, education — but the production of goods was left to the private sector. Foreign investment was emphasised to access the best technology, management, and marketing knowledge. Lee opted for a low-key foreign policy posture, something Deng also followed.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lee said welfare was the job of government and production was the job of business. He proved that the combination could produce record-beating growth and prosperity. He crushed corruption relentlessly, a rarity in developing countries. **He paid civil servants only modestly less than they could earn in the private sector.** He slashed red tape to zero or the minimum consistent with global quality standards.

      <li>Title::: 'Are South Indians arrogant?'<br />Body: "Whenever I watch a video on Indian culture, for example Carnatic music, I do the big mistake of going to the comment section after enjoying the video. This is because so many Indians feel the need to claim a certain aspect of culture for their state or their sub-ethnicity or their language. \n\nAnd unfortunately, South Indians are some of the biggest boasters out there; don't call me names for saying this because I'm of South Indian ancestry myself. There is one sub-ethnicity in the South who claim they are the oldest in everything, I'm sure you know which one I'm talking about. But even the other groups have many individuals who were never thought to be humble. \n\nI think the reason why this is happening is because Southern states are richer and a lot of people from the North are going there for low-skilled work. Besides, the Center is so far up North and naturally, local politicians use this situation to their advantage. This disgust towards low-skilled immigrants and their culture, plus the rebellious attitude towards the federal govt has an effect on how these groups in the South view themselves relative to other groups in the country. \n\nWhat do you think about this?"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'of1m28'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/of1m28/are_south_indians_arrogant/</li>

      <li>Title::: "[Opinion]Why Indian Universities will never be among the World's best"<br />Body: "I regularly see Indian's feeling proud about national Institutions like IITs, IIMs, AIIMS(I'll refer to them as AII from now) etc. and its easy to understand why. I'd like to provide a different view on why I feel the current system of glorifying these types of Institutions needs to stop and we need to try a different method. This is strictly apolitical, and has to do with education and administration.\n\nThe specialized institutions in the form of AIIs was introduced after Independence by the GOI as the stepping stones for Future India's successes. I agree with the sentiment but feel it was only a temporary solution, and doesn't work in the long run.\n\nAIIs by concept are very restrictive in nature and provide very little incentive to explore outside the University's field of expertise. If you're in IIT its about engineering and technology, if you're in AIIMs, it's all about medicine and so on.\n\nContrast this with the best institutions around the world, they aren't restricted to a specific field of study and all subjects ranging from Engineering, Sciences, Medicine to Law, Humanities, Economics and Social Sciences are offered by them. The fact that the same university offers them, provides a fluidity across different streams and a more diverse student community with an expertise on a range of topics.\n\nIf you're an engineering student and suddenly gain an interest in physics, or vice versa, there is no scope of changing what you study, you are stuck with what you have currently due to the rigidity of the system justified by the conceptual inception of 'specialized institutions'.\n\nI'm an IISc student and a Physics major, and I do feel like I've made the mistake of a lifetime by joining IISc, and upon exploring the possibilities of taking up Engineering for Masters, I found that it doesn't allow me for the courses I'm interested in due to my Physics background.\n\nI'm not too sure about this so someone can correct me, but if I had chosen to move from physics to engineering after 3 semesters in an American university, I may have been allowed to, although I'll be required to take some pre-requisite courses which isn't a problem. This isn't possible in AIIs.\n\nA greater fluidity across subjects also enables students to be exposed to multiple viewpoints. A management student may learn more about technology, a science student may learn more about finance etc. Apart from the obvious benefits to disillusioned students who want to try their abilities in other fields, this sort of fluidity allows for a multi-dimensional development of the Institution.\n\n**THAT** is the essential reason why I believe AIIs will never be among the best, nor will they produce well-rounded graduates, only one-dimensional robots. Many graduates learn a LOT **after** their graduation, which isn't the case with students in American and European universities, where you experience life fully, and the graduation is a really momentous occasion compared to the drab formal ceremonies here.\n\nTo sum up, the Indian system is very rigid and its not an accident, but rather a conceptual flaw, and no amount of funding will make them among the best in the world except in their **specific** field, which is also very difficult, and also a lot of wasted talent.\n\nPS:- This is an opinion, and I would love to hear your thoughts on this. This thought has been bothering me for a while and also partially answers the question of 'Why do so many Indians never work in jobs that aren't their university subjects?'\n\nOh, and Subramanian Swamy studied in Harvard, did his PhD under a Nobel winning economist and also attended Harvard Law School which is why he's so good at winning cases today. He also mentions the Weidner Library at Harvard which houses books on a WIDE range of topics and that is where he learnt about Indian History and become the Cultural Conservative he is today(I can't imagine an IIT housing books on History, or Law, etc.)"<br />Author: 'halfblood_ghost'  id: 'oeq0ia'<br />Score:211<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/oeq0ia/opinionwhy_indian_universities_will_never_be/</li>

More importantly, Modi became the first sitting Indian Prime Minister to visit Tel Aviv in July 2017.\n\nBreaking with another informal pattern established through previous ministerial visits, Modi also deliberately decided not to make a stop by Ramallah when visiting Israel in 2017\n\nNetanyahu then lated paid a  visit to New Delhi in January 2018 . India now were not shy and moved away from the more discreet approach towards Israel adopted by INC-led governments or the previous BJP-led government had done during 1998 to 2003.\n\n# Remember the previous Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had for instance never met with any Israeli ministers during his ten years in office (2004–2014).\n\nIndia abstained in July 2015 and in March 2016 from supporting a Palestine-sponsored resolution at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva to launch a probe by the International Criminal Court against Israel for war crimes during the 2014 Gaza crisis. We moved away from a traditional posture of supporting Pro-Palestine resolutions in UN bodies,\n\n**Defence Purchases**\n\nIndia and Israel defence ties also expanded under Modi’s tenure, as India bought 250 SPICE 2000 bombs from Israel’s Rafael systems in 2016, which were then used to strike a supposed terrorist camp in Balakot inside of Pakistan in March 2019 , as well as surveillance drones and Spike anti-tank guided missiles in June 2020 in the midst of the boundary dispute with China in Eastern Ladakh\n\nAnother hallmark of a shift under Modi has been that, in parallel to the overtures made to Israel, the Indian government also pushed for a reengagement of Iran. The 2015 nuclear deal—the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—signed by Iran and the P5 + 1 was perceived by the Modi government as a window of opportunity to further economic engagement with Iran after years of international embargo\n\n**Iran - Chabahar deal which had been 13 years in the making.**\n\nDuring his May 2016 visit to Tehran, Modi concluded a tripartite contract (along with Afghanistan) for the expansion of the strategically located Chabahar Port\n\nFor an energy-starved and rapidly growing India, the Chabahar Port was perceived as a vital link to the resource- and mineral-rich Central Asian states and Afghanistan. Yet, here again, Modi’s foreign policy towards Iran can be viewed as an example of successful political entrepreneurship, capitalizing on efforts initiated by previous Indian governments as the Chabahar deal which had been 13 years in the making.\n\n# Outreach to the Gulf Countries\n\n The Gulf states have historically a source of more than 60% of India’s  oil and gas requirements and, therefore, critical to its energy security . \n\nWhile India only  represented only 3% of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)’s total trade  in 1992, it represented 11% in 2012. By 2020, Saudi Arabia and the UAE  had become India’s fourth- and third-largest trade partners \n\n Energy and ties have traditionally dominated India’s relations with the  Gulf countries but have also been boosted by the existence of a sizeable  Indian diaspora. The Gulf states have been home to approximately 8.9  million Indians who contribute about $40 billion in remittances every  year and account for about 3 per cent of India’s GDP \n\nIn 2015, India’s then  Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar recognised India’s “historical presence  in the Gulf” but also stressed on the need to extend this to further avenues  of cooperation and to make India a “credible partner” of regional actors \n\n Modi’s did multiple visits to the Gulf countries to build on and consolidate existing economic ties. The goal was to strengthen the government-to-government ties. He had one prime  objective to encourage Gulf sovereign wealth funds to invest in India's ambitious infrastructure and manufacturing plans at home. \n\n Modi therefore chose the UAE as his first destination in August 2015,  but also visited Saudi Arabia, Iran and Qatar in 2016, as well as the  UAE again in 2018 and 2019. \n\nHe traveled again to Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Bahrain in a wide outreach to the  Gulf states. Overall, Modi has visited nine Middle Eastern states and  territories since 2014, more than his four predecessors combined.\n\nWhat was the result of all this ?\n\n&gt; *Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and other GCC members had increasingly seen India  as an important emerging market for their energy exports, foreign  investments, and joint venture opportunities.* \n\nIn  2019 UAE visit, Modi received the Order of Zayed, the UAE’s highest  civil decoration, in recognition of his role in improving ties between  the two countries .\n\nEvery visit of Modi’s was reciprocated by visits of Gulf dignitaries to New Delhi between 2014 and 2020. \n\nModi also pushed for discussions concerning national security problems like terrorism .  These interactions and agreements have included high-level strategic  security dialogues (UAE), inter-state defence cooperation agreements  (Qatar, Oman, UAE, Saudi Arabia), intelligence and counter-terrorism  cooperation (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Qatar) and convergence in  enhancing maritime security in the Indian Ocean region through bilateral  activities and in multilateral fora such as the Indian Ocean Rim  Association (IORA) and the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS \n\nDiscussions during the repeated Modi visits to Abu Dhabi and Riyadh  focused specifically on finalizing agreements ensuring the extradition  of Pakistani and Indian terrorists as well as limiting money laundering  activities from these same groups in the UAE and Saudi Arabia.\n\n The UAE again deported in 2019 a Jaish-e-Mohammed commander, Nisar Ahmed  Tantray, who was involved in a 2017 terror attack in Kashmir \n\n# New Geopolitical development in Gulf , Pakistan refuses to contribute troops to Saudi-led coalition against Houthis in Yemen\n\n In 2015 Pakistan sent mixed signals about its unconditional military support for Saudi Arabia , refusing to contribute troops to the Saudi-led coalition against the  Houthis in Yemen or to quell dissent in Bahrain in 2015.\n\n Modi and his government therefore perceived a potential weakening in  Pakistan’s ties with the Gulf states as an opportunity to reinforce  India’s own security cooperation with partners in the region. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe see how India saw its potential to play a different role in the Middle East compared to Nehru's tenure or even the 70s or 90s.  Modi govt perceived the importance of the Gulf region and pushed to increase public exchanges and to institutionalize pre-existing ad hoc partnerships.  \n\nModi government recognized the mismatch between growing interests in  the Middle East and the limited resources deployed to defend these  interests. The Modi government has also been more confident of India’s  “growing capacities and national branding” which have made it a more  “credible partner” to actors in the Middle East \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***The future posts will summarise Modi’s role to continuing this cooperation with the Gulf States.***\n\n***Hope you enjoyed this read and stay tuned for the next part.

      <li>Title::: 'My wishlist for India for the next decade'<br />Body: "I hope some of it happens over the next decade so India can become the best country to live in - please feel free to add to this wishlist or disagree with any of these points:\n\n1. **Police reforms**\n   1. More stringent recruitment process that involves psychographic tests to check empathy, honesty, integrity and action orientation\n   2. Minimum health requirement and bi-annual medical tests that are used as inputs to promotions and term\n   3. Mandatory body cams, dashboard cams and CCTV camera in all police stations\n   4. Live streaming of all court hearings\n   5. Substantial increase in Policemen salaries, significant performance based bonuses, free access to counsellors and emphasis on work-life balance (increasing police force drastically)\n   6. Higher end cars, bikes, protective gear and gadgets for the Policemen\n   7. Cop profiles, achievements and body cam video updates on a govt. website  \n   8. Removal of policemen/army from MP/MLA/Politicians personal security - The MLAs will then care about making the entire regions safe instead of  enjoying the safety of their own bubble while the common people live in fear\n2. **Strict enforcement of minimum wage  -** India can never develop until our labourers, maids, car cleaners, security guards etc. are ensured a respectable minimum wage \n3.  **Free food and shelter for all -** The govt. should ensure on war-footing that there's no family that goes to sleep without a nutrition-balanced meal, and involve private people in this mission through a transparent donation program. Singapore has ensured no-homeless people, we can too, if there's a will. \n4. **Renovation, security, comfort and marketing of all major tourist spots of India** \\- India has the potential to become the #1 tourist destination in the world if we can ensure a safe and comfortable end-to-end travel experience for both domestic and international tourists\n5. **Legalize growing of and exporting Marijuana** \\- India naturally grows so much of this and there are so many countries that have legalized marijuana - India can become the #1 exporter of marijuna and earn billions of $$\n6. **Death penalty for consuming or trafficking chemical drugs -** Heroine etc. type of drugs are eating away the youth of India..and it's a serious problem..if we don't act soon enough, it's going to become a catastrophe with more youth getting access to drugs. I've heard of reports that some young girls even exchange their nudes to get drugs from the dealers (google it)\n7. **Multi-language sign-boards, non-regional festival in every city -** For instance, the various road signs in Delhi, UP etc. could support one other Indian language (all signs with a different additional language). Not for convenience, but for driving a sense of welcomeness. When I visit a different city and see my language represented somewhere, it makes me feel quite welcome. Similarly, we should promote south Indian festivals in the north and north Indian in south, west Indian in East etc etc.. so we can all come together. Also, there should be an Indian flag visible every 5-6 km in every city. We can't win unless we fight together as Indians.\n\nmy actual wishlist is much longer, but I'll leave it here."<br />Author: 'CoolGuess'  id: 'odqclj'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/odqclj/my_wishlist_for_india_for_the_next_decade/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'What do you think of getting involved in Afghanistan?'<br />Body: 'The biggest reason is that Pakistan would gain majorly if Taliban overtakes the country and have another hub for their terrorism. Also Taliban deserves to be eradicated and is objectively awful especially to women and religious minorities and has something like 5% support among the Afghan people so there would be public support for getting involved. Another factor is how an allied and stable Afghanistan can be pretty useful if we ever decide to reclaim POK. I don’t think we should go in guns-blazing America style, but maybe resupplying their artillery, conducting some intelligence operations and sharing it with them, sending civilian resources, etc. Won’t turn the tides of war but they’ll probably appreciate anything they can get and will remember it if they win. If you think they’ll never support us back because they’re Muslims, well think of Azerbaijan and Albania/Kosovo. Both Muslim countries, both have ample reason to be pro-Palestinian fanatics, but Israel helped provide drones to Azerbaijan against Armenia and recognized Kosovo as an independent country. Both are now some of its biggest supporters, in terms of policy and public opinion.'<br />Author: 'HiDadWelcomeToReddit'  id: 'odq1xn'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/odq1xn/what_do_you_think_of_getting_involved_in/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Big News Dudes! we now have data on different aspects of religious people in India. This data is almost definitely complety true because it's published by pew reasearch center a very revered neutral org. let's address all things religious once and for and establish a true baseline."<br />Body: "Before we begin hello. I am a Apolitical person and I would keep this as netural as I can.\n\nI will only post the parts Which currently play into ongoing politics.\n\nI want this data to be circulated and I have not tampered or omitted things. I will also provide the  source.\n\n1.Indians value religious tolerance, though they also live religiously segregated lives.\n\n\xa0Across the country, most people (84%) say that to be “truly Indian,” it is very important to respect all religions. Indians also are united in the view that respecting\xa0other\xa0religions is a very important part of what it means to be a member of\xa0their own\xa0religious community (80%). People in all six major religious groups overwhelmingly say they are very free to practice their faiths, and most say that people of other faiths also are very free to practice their own religion.\n\n2. For many Hindus, national identity, religion and language are closely connected.\n\n\xa0Nearly two-thirds of Hindus (64%) say it is very important to be Hindu to be truly Indian. Among Hindus who say it is very important to\xa0be Hindu\xa0to be truly Indian, 80% also say it is very important to\xa0speak Hindi\xa0to be truly Indian. \n\nHindus who strongly link Hindu and Indian identities express a keen desire for religious segregation. For instance, 76% of Hindus who say being Hindu is very important to being truly Indian feel it is very important to stop Hindu women from marrying into another religion. By comparison, 52% of Hindus who place less importance on Hinduism’s role in Indian identity hold this view about religious intermarriage.\n\nMoreover, Hindus in the Northern (69%) and Central (83%) parts of the country are much more likely than those in the South (42%) to strongly link Hindu identity with national identity. Together, the Northern and Central regions cover the country’s “Hindi belt,” where Hindi, one of dozens of languages spoken in India, is most prevalent. The vast majority of Hindus in these regions strongly link Indian identity with being able to speak Hindi.\n\n3. Among Hindus, views of national identity go hand-in-hand with politics.\n\nSupport for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is greater among Hindus who closely associate their religious identity and the Hindi language with being truly Indian. In the 2019 national elections, 60% of Hindu voters who think it is very important to be Hindu\xa0and\xa0to speak Hindi to be truly Indian cast their vote for the BJP, compared with 33% among Hindu voters who feel less strongly about both these aspects of national identity. These views also map onto regional support for the BJP, which tends to be much higher in the Northern and Central parts of the country than in the South.\n\n4. Dietary laws are central to Indians’ religious identity.\n\n\xa0Hindus traditionally view cows as sacred, and laws on cow slaughter have recently been a\xa0flashpoint in India. Nearly three-quarters of Hindus (72%) in India say a person cannot be Hindu if they eat beef. That is larger than the shares of Hindus who say a person cannot be Hindu if they do not believe in God (49%) or never go to a temple (48%).\n\nSimilarly, three-quarters of Indian Muslims (77%) say that a person cannot be Muslim if they eat pork, which is greater than the share who say a person cannot be Muslim if they do not believe in God (60%) or never attend mosque (61%).\n\n5.Muslims favor having access to their own religious courts.\xa0\n\nSince 1937, India’s Muslims have had the option of resolving family and inheritance-related cases in officially recognized Islamic courts, known as dar-ul-qaza. These courts are overseen by religious magistrates known as qazi and\xa0operate under Shariah\xa0principles, although their decisions are\xa0not legally binding.\n\nWhether or not Muslims\xa0should\xa0be allowed to go to their own religious courts remains a\xa0hotly debated topic. The survey finds that three-quarters of Muslims (74%) support having access to the existing system of Islamic courts, but followers of other religions are far less likely to support Muslim access to this separate court system.\n\n\n6.India’s caste system, an ancient social hierarchy with origins in\xa0Hindu writings, continues to fracture society.\n\n\xa0Regardless of whether they are Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist or Jain, Indians nearly universally identify with a caste. Members of lower caste groups historically have\xa0faced discrimination and unequal economic opportunities, but the survey finds that most people – including most members of lower castes – say there is\xa0not\xa0a lot of caste discrimination in India. The\xa0Indian Constitution\xa0prohibits caste-based discrimination, including untouchability, and in recent decades the government has enacted economic advancement policies like\xa0reserved seats in universities and government jobs\xa0for members of some lower-caste communities.\n\nStill, a large majority of Indians overall (70%) say that most or all of their close friends share their caste. Much as they object to interreligious marriages, a large share of Indians (64%) say it is\xa0very\xa0important to stop women in their community from marrying into other castes, and about the same share (62%) say it is very important to stop men in their community from marrying into other castes. These figures vary only modestly across different castes.\n\n\n\n7. Religious conversion is rare in India; to the extent that it is occurring, Hindus gain as many people as they lose.\n\n\xa0Conversion of people belonging to lower castes away from Hinduism to other religions, especially Christianity, has been\xa0contentious in India, and\xa0some states have laws against proselytism. This survey, though, finds that religious switching has a minimal impact on the size of religious groups. Across India, 98% of survey respondents give the same answer when asked to identify their current religion and, separately, their childhood religion\n\nSource: https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/29/key-findings-about-religion-in-india/\n\nFAQ\n1. How can you say pew research center truly is what you say?\n\nGoogle search it. You will find many sites and people finding the same.\n\n2.

      <li>Title::: 'Karma catches up to a milkbag for cutting the line at a vaccination centre.'<br />Body: "Went to a ngo run vaccination centre today they were giving free vaccine and today was the last day of their drive and also a sunday which means, there were more people there than I've seen in two years of lockdown combined. Me and my brother waited in line of approx 150 peeps for 1.5 hours and when my turn finally came one of the  organisers kindly asked me if he can send in a couple of senior citizens before me. Me being the nice human being i am, obviously had no problem with it. Well turns out there more than a couple of people in senior citizens and my wait got a lot longer than i anticipated. Also i didn't get much sleep last knight ynkow euros and stuff also pubg is back soo i was getting a bit impatient as the time passed. There were also people the organisers  were letting in without entering the huge line,these people those who waited thier turn yesterday and the doses ran out but they had thier own line and were being let in slowly keeping people in the main line satisfied. Well yknow the senior citizen that went in inside just now they were having some trouble so one of the two turnkeepers got distracted.(this is a great chance for people to invade the line and get in the registration room). One of the turnkeepers kept asking people behind me inc. my brother who was just behind me to back off and maintain distancing while he had his mask pulled down to his chin and never did he pulled it up to his nose. A lady came and asked him to do her cowin registration he obliged but didn't actually knew the site so he asked me to do it for her. Me being the nice human i am ,this time just typed in the site for him and returned the phone (at this point of waiting which is almost 2hrs the nice guy in me has suppressed down to negligible levels). But you see that was a mistake on my part now both of the guys who were keeping check of the turns were busy and in comes some random dude twice my size built like a huge bag of milk out of nowhere with a friend in front of him half my size built like a ice-cream stick and both pass the door to the registration room in front if my eyes and my temperature soared. Ice cream stick was acting all confident and was going in behind his friend milk, I couldn't stop the milk but the stick got it, I held his shoulder back he tried to ignore me and gave instructions to his friend milk to go in. I held the stick back and told him off in the meanest tone I can. It caught the attention of everyone on the management staff and they came up to me I was boiling with rage but I respectfully told them that I've seen women of my mothers age wait in line for hours and healthy mofos built like a bag of milk are cutting lines. He let the milk bag continue and stick got sent to back of the line to wait another hour. While we were in this situation another senior citizen started raging that he has been waiting for 10 minutes and why tf they aren't letting him in. That old man was talking to these people as if they owe him something like come on talk about being ungrateful. Anyways they let him in before me and the lines keeper saw the rage in my eyes so he turned down the woman who just filled her cowin form when she wanted to go in before me. I went in followed by my brother , got one counter done and got in line for final counter and there he was, just in front of me in punching range, the bag of milk. I was giving him the deadliest stare i could he even looked back and knew i was pissed. We both got the registration done and went to the vaccination room there were two trainees/nurses (i couldn't tell if they were doctors or not) one if them was a pretty northeast lady and other nurse was sweating buckets so i casually walked to the NE nurse side but the milk he and my brother took sweaty side. There was that old raging man in front of me he was getting his injection as i waited and watched milk sit down and pull up his sleeves (i was still raging on him). To my horror she messed up his injection. He probably flexed his muscle a lot or she probably held the wet cotton by her injecting hand or it was probably a faulty injection or it was probably the sweat ,but as she retracted the injection a little bit to check for blood she put a little more effort than required and whole thing came out and i saw the dose spill erratically on the table. You might think i would be happy that karma got milk but at that moment i didn't care about him i cared that my brother was behind her. We can't blame anyone tho human errors are unavoidable. Me and my brother got our doses safely and went out . And then it hit me and it has made my day *karma caught up to that bitch yessssssssssss*. The nurse didn't reinject him and he got out when she explained to him that with high pressure he got his dose, nothing to worry. She is probably right but there was no doubt a lot if spillage. And as i went outside me and my brother watched as that mf posed in front of that i got vaccinated poster with stick clicking his picture and i let out a great sigh, making the ugliest smirks we could, we left the centre. At the end of this experience i can confirm *KARMA IS A BITTTCH IT CATCHES UP TO YOU HAHAHAHA GET REKT MILKBAG*.

All of the schools where human remains have been found were set up when Canada was a British dominion within the empire. Just today almost 200 unmarked graves of children where found at another school.\n\nAs Canadians [grapple with their history](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/02/the-toxic-legacy-of-the-british-empire-in-canadas-residential-schools), I think of the situation in India, where English-medium Indians are clamoring for exactly the opposite: preserving British era institutions and buildings. It seems strange  - a colonized people fighting to preserving the institutions and mentality forced upon them.\n\nThe way our elites still think "convent" schools are the best and British food, mannerisms and lifestyles are the height of civilization.\n\nHowever it makes sense when you realize that the British created this class of privileged Indians as a go between, to rule the masses of Indians, i.e. those who speak regional languages. When Independence happened, India made a devils bargain with the British to be ruled by highly anglicized leaders that the British approved, such as Nehru and Jinnah. And so the English left behind the machinery of Empire, the bureaucracy, education systems, police and military, essentially unmodified. This is what still rules India.\n\nWhat is heart-breaking is that most Indians still do not understand the devastating violence that was perpetuated on the country during colonization, not just physical violence but the economic and social violence. Our institutions were being dismantled at precisely the same time as the west was starting its scientific and industrial growth.\n\nAgree, disagree?'<br />Author: 'dhatura'  id: 'ocybkt'<br />Score:136<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ocybkt/indian_liberals_and_elites_and_the_rest_of_the/</li>

More than 50% are fully vaccinated. The whole city will be fully vaccinated by July-end.\n\n[https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bhubaneswar/2021/jun/28/covid-bhubaneswar-on-road-to-full-vaccinationby-july-end-2322474.html](https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bhubaneswar/2021/jun/28/covid-bhubaneswar-on-road-to-full-vaccinationby-july-end-2322474.html)\n\nThe reason for the stark contrast between Bhubaneswar and the rest of Odisha is the state government's decision to limit Covaxin exclusively to Bhubaneswar till yesterday. That meant Bhubaneswar rarely faced shortages unlike the rest of the state. For example, the day before yesterday vaccination was stopped in 16 districts due to shortage of Covishield while the state government had 3 lakh+ Covaxin doses in hand.\n\nFor context:\n\nOdisha:\n\nPopulation: 4.2cr\n\nTotal Doses: 1.2 cr\n\nBhubaneswar:\n\nPopulation: 8.3 lakh (\\~2% of population)\n\nVaccines: 13.1 lakh (\\~11% of vaccine doses)\n\nTotal doses administered in the Khurdha district (Bhuabnewar comes under this district) which has a population of 22 lakh is 17.7 lakh, 75% of which are in Bhubaneswar itself.\n\nOther districts with big cities where Covishied was given exclusively for 18-44 (starting from May 1) for close to a month before expanding it to other places:\n\nSambalpur: Population: 10 lakh vaccines: 4.5 lakh\n\nSundargarh (Rourkela) : Population: 20.9 lakh Vaccines: 6.1 lakh\n\nGanjam(Berhampur) : Population: 35.2 lakh Vaccines: 11.4 lakh\n\nCuttack : Population: 26.2 lakh Vaccines: 8.74 lakh\n\nPuri : Population: 16.9 lakh vaccines: 5.47 lakh\n\nMeanwhile, vaccine coverage in more populous districts like Mayurbhanj Baleswar etc is low.\n\nMayurbhanj Population: 25.1 lakh Vaccines: 4.9 lakh\n\nBaleswar Population: 23.2 lakh vaccine: 6.3 lakh\n\nVaccination is also low in western districts bordering Chattishgarh where 2nd wave was especially bad. While it's understandable that urban areas with more population density should get priority, the difference between Bhubaneswar and the rest of the Odisha is hard to justify."<br />Author: 'bobTheProcrastinator'  id: 'ocx10j'<br />Score:38<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ocx10j/bhubaneswar_on_road_to_full_vaccination_by/</li>

However, the country also crossed a grim milestone as the death toll from Covid-19 in India surpassed the 400,000 mark on Sunday. Reports, however, have indicated that the death toll from the country\'s second wave appears to be significantly higher than the official figures recorded. The government has also abstained from suggesting that India has turned a corner in its fight against viral contagion and said that the second wave is not yet over.\n\n## Don\'t lower guard: Health ministry\n\nHealth ministry officials have spotlighted the need to vaccinate against Covid-19 and following the safety protocols like wearing the mask and maintaining social distance, suggesting that lowering of guard could spell trouble. "The second wave of Covid-19 is not over yet," joint secretary of health ministry Lav Agarwal said.\n\n## Covaxin demonstrates 93.4% efficacy\n\nBharat Biotech\'s Covaxin has demonstrated 77.8% efficacy against symptomatic Covid-19 and 93.4% against severe disease, a final analysis of the efficacy of the vaccine from phase 3 clinical trials published in a pre-print study revealed.\n\n## Centre rushes teams to 6 states\n\nAfter identifying the top hotspots of Covid-19 in the country, the Centre on Friday sent multi-disciplinary teams to Kerala, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Manipur in view of a high number of Covid-19 cases being reported daily by these states.\n\n\n## India asks EU members to accept Covishield, Covaxin\n\nIndia on Wednesday asked the European Union (EU) member states to accept Covid-19 vaccines authorised by the World Health Organization or national authorities, such as Covishield and Covaxin, for Indian nationals travelling to Europe. Non-acceptance, India said, will be followed with a policy of reciprocity and exempt EU nationals possessing the “green pass” from mandatory quarantine only if the bloc does this, officials said.\n\n## 44.9 lakh Covid-19 vaccines in the next 3 days: Govt\n\nA total of 44.9 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses will be shared with states and the Union territories over the weekend, health ministry officials said on Friday.\n\n\n## PM Modi lauds contribution of doctors\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday lauded the contribution of doctors in saving lives from coronavirus disease and said his government has given maximum thrust on augmenting the healthcare infrastructure in the country.\n\nIn his address at an Indian Medical Association event on National Doctor\'s Day, PM Modi said India saved lives of lakhs of its people and has fared better than more developed and prosperous countries in terms of the Covid infection and mortality per lakh population. A big credit for that goes to doctors, healthcare and frontline workers, he said.\n\n## Moderna’s Covid vaccine approved for use in India\n\nIndia on Tuesday approved the import of US pharmaceutical major Moderna’s mRNA technology-based Covid-19 vaccine, paving the way for the entry of the first international jab in the country.\n\n## States will get 120mn vaccine doses for July\n\nThe Centre will distribute 120 million doses of coronavirus vaccines – 100 million shots of Covishield and 20 million of Covaxin – to all states and Union territories for July, according to advance information shared with them.\n\n\nWhat covid news caught your attention ?\n\n\n**Source:**\n- https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-this-week-covaxin-s-efficacy-moderna-in-india-to-120-mn-vaccine-doses-101625279351963.html'<br />Author: 'slowdownonlyslims'  id: 'octt0d'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/octt0d/covid19_this_week_covaxins_efficacy_moderna_in/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Is India a disorganized country?'<br />Body: 'I think no other country in the world is portrayed to be messy and chaotic as much as India. And this is a problem, because being disorganized can also be seen as being incompetent and not being able to get your act together by foreign investors, consumers of Indian goods and services, even many locals. \n\nFirstly, is the stereotype true? I think the answer is, **not really**. India is portrayed to be much worse than it actually is. People who\'ve lived in other societies for a long period of time understand what I mean when I say "**Indians are bad at looking good**". Some countries, like China, are so good at showing a rosy picture to the world, while carefully hiding their ugly side. India is the opposite of that, even when subsequent govts try to show a rosy picture, they fail miserably. The recent Covid situation is a testament to that. \n\nThe truth is, substance is paramount but style is important too to influence people\'s first impression. When your buildings look impressive, your people look beautiful after all the surgeries, your GDP figures, Covid and vaccination figures all look impressive, a lot of people buy into that. Yes it is a lie, but a lot of sales and marketing tactics are lies or huge exaggerations at best. \n\nComing back to the original question, while India is not as dysfunctional as portrayed, I think there is still a lot of improvement needed to be done. Poverty rate is still high and a lot of people don\'t have access to necessities that are taken for granted in many other countries. \n\nWhat is your opinion on this?'<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'oc7kgk'<br />Score:67<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/oc7kgk/is_india_a_disorganized_country/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'There is no political will amongst the Indian political elite to achieve any goals'<br />Body: 'Incoming rant.\n\n70 years on and we still haven\'t figured out industrialization. All the so-called IAS officers and ministries of this government cannot figure out something the West, Korea, Japan, China figured out anywhere from 200 to 50 years ago. "Skill India" and "Make in India" are both failures and now the focus has shifted to "Atmanirbhar" which is going the protectionist way against like the 1970s and 1980s. It is bound for failure. I just came back from a digital store and every SINGLE item was "Made in China", even the ones that were Indian brands. We can\'t even make our own electric kettles, and cookers, tf are we going to make smartphones and processors? India doesn\'t have a SINGLE semiconductor fabrication unit and the one that was planned in 2017 got canceled. Woohoo. What a shitshow. \n\nThe Indian state has no ambition, it is purely reactionary. It\'s always China or Pakistan on the offensive and India on the defensive.\n\nIf you ask me, personally I really do believe it is time we homogenize the country and remove federalism. Just look at the high speed rail project that was initiated in 2014, it fizzled out because Maharashtra government blocked land acquisition, what\'s the need of a federal system? It only poses more blockades and challenges. If Indians from the South won\'t accept Hindi, impose English all over the country instead and turn India into a unitary state with states being reduced to provinces.\n\nSecondly, there needs to be political will in two other major fields, education and malnourishment. One thing I totally despise our traditional culture is for its absolutely chastising dietary choices. It\'s all grains and carbs, little to no meat causing stunted children with cognitive and physical difficulties. 47% of Indians are B12 deficient because they don\'t eat enough meat or don\'t eat enough period. It is these things that forever go unnoticed and because the political elite in India regardless of political standing are a bunch of delusional boomers they do not have the incentive to work towards these goals. \n\nThe last thing about infrastructure, well that is one thing that seems to be done properly these days. Highways, railways, freight corridors and buildings and metros in cities are being built.\n\nIf you want to see Indians to be proud, then why not focus on winning International Olympiad medals (Even Iran has us beat in the IMO), Olympics medals, and so on? These things have a concrete basis, regurgitating mythologies from 3,000 years ago is interesting but has no use in the modern world besides from usual philosophical ponderings. \n\nWhere are we failing?'<br />Author: 'Aarav64'  id: 'obyflu'<br />Score:58<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/obyflu/there_is_no_political_will_amongst_the_indian/</li>

At many Chinese high schools, families have to pay tuition and other expenses, and these outlays are among the highest in the world. Consequently, 76 percent of China’s working-age population has not completed high school. \n\nMany Chinese college students describe their universities as “diploma factories,” where student-teacher ratios are double the average in U.S. universities, cheating is rampant, students spend a quarter of their time studying “Mao Zedong thought,” and students and professors are denied access to basic sources of information, such as Google Scholar and certain academic journal repositories.   \n\n\n As China’s population ages, it will deplete its savings. Chinese people save a lot to compensate for the state’s meager social-security provision. For three decades, the savings of ordinary people financed the spectacular borrowing of China’s state-owned enterprises. How much was [borrowed](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3084979/china-debt-how-big-it-who-owns-it-and-what-next)? Nobody knows, because everybody lies. What happens as the savings are withdrawn to finance hundreds of millions of retirements? Again—who knows? \n\nRemember -  You can copy and steal all you want, but *technological copycats* face huge disadvantages against *technological innovators*. They will always lag behind the more creative rival, not only in the factory, but on the battlefield. \n\nPLA exercises remain heavily scripted (the red team almost always wins) … Most exercises involve a single service or branch, so troops lack the ability to conduct joint operations, and assessments are often nothing more than “subjective judgments based on visual observation rather than on detailed quantitative data” and are scored “based simply on whether a training program has been implemented rather than on whether the goals of the program have been achieved.” \n\nChina misallocates capital on a massive scale. More than a fifth of China’s housing stock [is empty](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-08/a-fifth-of-china-s-homes-are-empty-that-s-50-million-apartments)—the detritus of a frenzied construction boom that built too many apartments in the wrong places. China overcapitalizes at home because Chinese investors are prohibited from doing what they most want to do: get their money out of China. Strict and complex foreign-exchange controls [block](https://legacy.export.gov/article?id=China-Foreign-Exchange-Controls) the flow of capital. More than one-third of the richest Chinese would emigrate if they could, according to [research](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/05/more-than-a-third-of-chinese-millionaires-want-to-leave-china.html) by one of the country’s leading wealth-management firms. The next best alternative: sending their children out. Pre-pandemic, almost 1 million young Chinese [attended](https://wenr.wes.org/2019/12/education-in-china-3) Western universities. Pre-pandemic, only about 10,000 Americans were studying in China; single thousands were from other Western countries—and almost all of them were in the country to [study language](https://www.ft.com/content/6665e98c-ece6-11e8-8180-9cf212677a57), not any academic specialty. \n\nAs China’s population ages, it will deplete its savings.

Those troops were the backbone of the British war effort in Iran and Iraq, as well as playing a major part in North Africa and the re-conquest of the east. Under the agreement those men who were not directly defending India were paid for by the British government, with credits to be paid for after the war ended. All in all India was the greatest single contributor to the British war effort after Britain herself, giving up £2 billion in goods and services. Indian manufacturers made munitions and supplies for the troops, while her farmers gave up grain to feed the rest of the Empire. \n\nHistorians like Niall Ferguson have resisted the comparison between Britain’s occupation of India and Nazi rule in the east, but it was current at the time. Leo Amery referred to Churchill’s ‘Hitler-like’ policy for India. ‘The Russian space is our India’, said Hitler. ‘Like the English, we shall rule this Empire with a handful of men.’\n\nAccording to Ivone Kirkpatrick, who met Adolf Hitler at Berchtesgaden in 1937, one of Hitler\'s favorite films was The Lives of a Bengal Lancer, which he had watched three times. He liked the film because "it depicted a handful of Britons holding a continent in thrall. That was how a superior race must behave and the film was a compulsory viewing for the S.S. (Nazi paramilitary organization)" Also, his valet recalled that Hitler enjoyed the film. It was one of the eleven US movies that, from 1933 to 1937, were considered "artistically valuable" by the Nazi authorities.\n\nsources:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lives_of_a_Bengal_Lancer_(film)\n\nAn Unpatriotic History of the Second World War, Book by James Heartfield'<br />Author: 'bradyismyname'  id: 'oank38'<br />Score:41<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/oank38/hitlers_favourite_film_was_lives_of_bengal/</li>

In addition, the alum in Alhydroxiquim-II stimulates the immune system to search for an invading pathogen.\n\nMolecules that activate TLR receptors stimulate the immune system powerfully, but the side effects of Alhydroxiquim-II are mild.\n\nThis is because, after COVAXIN is injected, the adjuvant travels directly to nearby lymph nodes, which contain white blood cells that play an essential role in identifying pathogens and fighting infection\n\n\nConsequently, only a small amount of Alhydroxiquim-II is needed in each dose of vaccine, and the adjuvant does not circulate throughout the body, thereby averting more widespread inflammation and undesirable side effects.\n\nThe collaboration between Dr. David and the company that makes COVAXIN, Bharat Biotech International Ltd. of Hyderabad, was initiated during a 2019 meeting in India coordinated by the NIAID Office of Global Research under the auspices of NIAID’s Indo-U.S. Vaccine Action Program\n\nA delegation of five NIAID-funded adjuvant investigators including Dr. David; two members of the NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation; and the NIAID India representative visited four leading biotechnology companies to learn about their work and discuss collb\n\nAmong the scientific collaborations sparked by these activities, Bharat Biotech signed a licensing agreement with Dr. David to use Alhydroxiquim-II in their candidate vaccines.\n\nThis license was expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic to include COVAXIN, which has received Emergency Use Authorization in India and more than a dozen other countries.\n\nThe company conducted extensive safety studies of Alhydroxiquim-II and undertook the complex process of scaling up production of the adjuvant under Good Manufacturing Practice standards. \n\n\nTL;DR : Results from\xa0two(link is external)\xa0studies(link is external)\xa0of blood serum from people who had received COVAXIN suggest that the vaccine generates antibodies that effectively neutralize the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.617 (Delta) variants of SARS-CoV-2, first identified in the United Kingdom and India, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/adjuvant-developed-nih-funding-enhances-efficacy-indias-covid-19-vaccine#.YNtPerSI0f8.twitter'<br />Author: 'HarshTruth_Revisited'  id: 'oad2fy'<br />Score:23<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/oad2fy/results_from_twolink_is_external_studieslink_is/</li>

Lucky are those Kshatriyas who get a chance to fight for such a cause naturally, which opens the door of paradise for them. But if you refrain from participating in such a war for the cause of truth you will be failing to do your duty and earn a good name for yourself. Thus you will be committing a sin. Apart from that, the entire mankind will not remember you in good words and it is worse than death for such a person who had commanded respect. Brave people will think that the fear of death has stopped you from going to the war and because they considered it a very honourable thing you will be looked down upon by them. Your enemies will laugh at your strength and say many insulting things which should not be said about you. What could be a more regrettable thing than this. You will go to heaven if you die and if you succeed then all pleasures of the earth are there for you".\n\nO Pundit Ji! O Maharaj Ji! Do you know why we call you Maharaj? Maha means big, that is the one who is superior to the Rajah (a ruler). Why are you considered to be superior to the ruler (the Rajah)? Because you were the source of knowledge and civilization, God\'s greatest blessings. In olden times the ancient sages entrusted the job of ruling the country and upholding the cause of justice and truth with their swordsmanship to the Rajputs because they knew that without the power of sword it was impossible to govern the people. Brahmins: duty as fountainhead of knowledge and civilization was to advise and guide them; because the power of God\'s commandments and its knowledge was and would always be stronger than the power of sword. Nothing could happen without your will. At rituals of pleasure your word was equal to law. The armies could not move towards battlefield without your orders, so much so that brave and grand kings could not have been crowned without your approval. \n\nAnd O Rajputs, descendents of the great kings and chiefs of India whose deeds of bravery and courage are recorded on the pages of history for ever, which will remain a great source of pride for us Indians. Not only Indians, but also the entire humanity will learn from your courage and bravery. Do you realize the great legacy of traditions of your past? So, O Pundits and Thakkurs (village chiefs) do you have any knowledge of what is happening around you? I will remind you of these things briefly. Four years ago a self-proclaimed European nation called the Germans declared war against your very kind government, ignoring all moral and divine laws. You are all well aware of all those royal favours which your caring government has extended to you. At a time when we were fighting among ourselves it brought peace and security, and when it was impossible to trade peacefully and businesses were being destroyed and their survival was dependent one the mercy of dishonest and corrupt officials, your government opened the doors of peace and affluence on us. In short as in an old proverb, the tiger and the goat drank side by side. Four years of ferocious wars have rocked the world. All civilized states of the world are with your government, because your government is fighting for a just cause.. \n\nNow Listen! What do you know about who Germans are? You will understand better if I explain to you the truth by calling them similar to the historic devilish people (Rakshash) of Sangledip. You all know very well the reality about the barbarians of Sri Lanka, who under Ravan the great devil (Rakshash) invaded India and who, having created a river of blood and fire streaming from the South, marched direct into Auadh. Similarly, the Germans attacked peaceful countries. They carry fire and sword, murder children and women wherever they go, loot houses, desecrate Houses of God and burn them to the ground. In the beginning they attacked Belgium violating an agreement which their own government had signed and stamped taking responsibility of security of that country; because this agreement bore the signature of your government as well, it raised an objection to it. This was the reason why the war was declared against your government too, and the agreement was dismissed as a piece of rubbish. An agreement is an agreement and from times immemorial it has always been honoured. There is a Persian proverb that the words of men have a soul. Breaking an agreement is always considered as a disgraceful act. Tulsi Das in Ramayan (Hindu Epic) narrates: "This is a tradition from eternity that life may go but not the given words." A House of Worship belonging to any religion is considered sacred by everyone. Women, new born babies and very young children have always been considered by entire mankind as worthy of respect and mercy. What do you make of those people who intentionally destroyed Houses of Worship, raped women and stabbed suckling babes? Certainly you will say that these cannot be the acts of human beings that such acts could only be committed by devils, and in fact it is so. These devils (the Germans) are spreading misery everywhere in the world relying on their devilish swords, ignoring all the divine laws and voice of human conscience. They want to conquer the whole world as Ravan wanted to conquer the whole of India. And indeed the truth is that he managed to abduct Maha Rani Sita, the symbol of purity for a few days. The moon was temporarily surrounded by thick black clouds. Goodness for a short while was imprisoned but at last truth, justice and goodness prevailed and always will. The darkness was shattered, the devils were killed and goodness shone as before. Similarly the German devils who initially did not let anybody stand in their way have now been stopped. They are in the grip of the iron hands of our government and the time is getting nearer when they will meet complete destruction as Ravan did. \n\nWe Indians are proud that our government sent the Indian Army to France where they stopped these devil forces with their bravery and avenged the innocent victims of their barbarity. Whenever the history of this war is written, the deeds of the sons of India will become a memorable chapter. These barbarians have tested the taste of our steel for the first time but they will never forget it. Although they have been stopped and they are in a very bad condition, they have not accepted their defeat so far, and they will not accept it unless they are destroyed entirely. Our government has told them that it is a matter of days when their heads are totally crushed, and only then the world will be free of the miseries of war. They have also been told that if they abandon their devilish habits and start living like normal human beings they will be spared and allowed to live and continue; but as in the proverb, the rope is burnt but the knot on it remains; which means that while their advance in France is stopped and they are receiving defeat upon defeat, they think that our armies are scattered and our country is not in a position to defend itself, and they want to attack our countries like the robbers and thieves of Sri Lanka. \n\nOur government has warned us of this danger and has advised us that we should be prepared to stop them. Now the danger of the Ravans attacking us is not from the South but from the North. It is true that we 300 Million Indians under the orders of our government will make it impossible for them to destroy our houses. But we could be better prepared on advance warning. We should strengthen our defences against any possible surprise attack from these barbarians. Normally a group of rogues can gather a large number of associates for the purpose of robbing and looting, it is therefore our duty to get armed and protect our borders so that no robber or looter can enter our country. Without arming ourselves we cannot defend our land. Nobody dares facing an attacker unarmed. If there is somebody foolish enough to do that he will soon return with a smashed head. If armed, only five robbers can make 500 unarmed villagers run for their lives. Don\'t you have this experience? Whenever a village is raided by robbers a few of them start shooting with their guns to threaten the people. Our villagers, however, eager to help their neighbours do not dare to come out of their houses. If they were as armed as the robbers or better than them they would face the robbers and kill them. The truth is that no robber would dare go near such a place (where people are armed) because they know they will be confronted with weapons. You may apply the same principle for your country. Once the Germans know that we are equally trained and armed they will not dare to attack our country. It is because you also know very well that a trained skilled clubber can defeat many untrained or unskilled clubbers. In addition, they won\'t do so once they are convinced that our system is working well. \n\nOur forces conquered East Africa which was ruled by Germans. You ask them what they saw there. Germans treated the native coloured people like animals. If a coolie failed to do his job satisfactorily, his hands would be cut off even though it could be due to his illness. Imprisonment and caning for petty errors in daily routine work was very frequent. If any native ever displeases any official, and especially an army official, he will face capital punishment for it. Women were kept as mistresses without marriage and shunted out on the will of the master. There was no moral code whatsoever. On top of that women were publicly beaten. The sole objective of the Germans was to collect money for the German government without any consideration of public interest or benefit of the country. Fortunately due to the courage of your soldiers and good fortunes of your government, the East African country got rid of the German barbarians. They will not be ruling that country any more. The natives are very happy and satisfied, and have restarted their peaceful professions of farming and commerce. Now I ask you whether you have armed yourselves or whether you are prepared to arm yourselves according to the wishes of our Government to defend the country. \n\nLast year the government made a requisition of 20,000 people from Auadh. Only one third of this number was made available. In the days of Nababs and the Company Bahadhur Auadh was one of the best sources of excellent soldiers consisting of Rajputs and Brahmins. The Viceroy praised highly the province of Agra while comparing the numbers of recruits and said that our province had not done well. The Viceroy is right to say that we should be ashamed of it. This year 35000 recruits are needed from Auadh. Are the Rajputs and Brahmins joining the forces as is expected of them? No. Do you know that on request of the Landlords the government has very kindly ordered to form separate regiments from Auadh which will consists of Brahmins, Rajputs and Muslims? Two companies of Rajputs, one of Brahmins and one company of Muslims are currently being formed. The Rajput Depot is situated in Lucknow, and that of Brahmins in Sitapur, opposite the sacred temple of Nimisar and Misrakh. The central offices of these regiments would remain in Auadh so that the soldiers can be near their families and homes. Why this indifference? Have you lost your pride? Are you blinded to your own interests? Do you think that the Germans will treat you and your loved ones nicely and respectfully? Or you want to meet the fate of the East Africans? If they do not find you fully prepared they will mow you down. They will destroy your homes like they destroyed the homes of the Belgians. Do you think they would respect your womenfolk? Would their intoxicated armies not ruin your sacred temples? Have you shut your eyes on all these matters? Do you not care about the honour of your wives, sisters and daughters more than about your own lives? Would you not get armed and ready for the honour of your women and Teerath (the holy place of Hindu pilgrimage) in Ajodhia, if not for anything else? What happened to your glorious past? Is your bravery dead? Of course it is if you ignore your responsibility. It is your duty and a sacred one that you defend your country. This is the command of your religion and if you do not you will be considered worse than women. O Rajputs! Your women have done great deeds. Have you forgotten the times when Rajputs went to wars and their ladies bade them farewell with the advice not to show their backs to their enemies? If a husband died his wife would happily die with him on the pyre. In the case of husbands deserting, their wives would not let them come near. Do you remember that highly respected Devi Rani (Princess) of Chittorh would not allow her husband enter the palace because he had absconded from the battlefield? Certainly you are not that low so as to forget the great traditions. Do you realize who are joining the armies? They are the Passies and Gujjars (low castes). \n\nThe world does not have mercy for anyone. The rule of Nature is that the fittest will survive. If these low castes got armed and became powerful, and indeed the people who work hard become powerful, imagine how you would feel like in your own village, if you have to salute a Passi Subedar Major, even though you are a Maharaj or a Thakkur (higher castes)? How would you like that? Ninety nine per cent cases of fighting in the courts are those where most of the parties consist of Brahmins and Thakkurs. They may be ring leaders or ordinary participants but generally remain involved in fighting and litigation on petty matters. They are wasting their ancestral land very fast. There is a fighting spirit in them which needs to be channeled properly. Army life will revive your old traditions of gallantry and greatness. You will also get material benefits from it. Litigation and baseless feuds will decrease and money will come from the Government. If 35000 people get recruited, which I hope will be the case, their added income would be more than Rs.700,000 per month which would amount to Rs.10 Million (i.e. one crore). Your will not only secure your inherited property but will also be able to buy back the property you have already lost. With your added income you will no longer be in the grip of Mahajins (Hindu Money Lenders). Now please say good bye to your lethargy and proceed to get your name registered in the Auadh regiment. O Maha Raj and O Thakkur! Now is the time to regain the greatness of your ancestors. Repeat your history now by keeping in view the image of the sacred land of Ajodhia and memories of Grand Master Lord Sri Rama Chandra. Get armed and stop the atrocities of the Germans. It is possible that the God Almighty has reserved this honour for the sons of Auadh that German atrocities would be stopped by them like Rama Chandra stopped the atrocities of the Sri Lankan Chief Ravan. \n\nGet Recruited! Get Recruited! Get Recruited! Today! Hurry up and get recruited so that throughout India we could hold our heads high, so that Lord Sri Rama Chandra could be proud of the people of Auadh. \n\nSigned (Sheikh) Shahid Hussain, Special Officer of War Work.

      <li>Title::: '[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] New Israeli PM takes office, heat wave in the US, and the life of Alexander Dubček'<br />Body: 'Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Geopolitics Thread, the place where we discuss events from all over the world. News and discussion do not have to be related to India. Please share interesting stories in the comments. Here are a few to get the discussion started:\n\n# Top Stories\n\n1. [Israel gets new PM after 12 years](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-knesset-vote-new-government-end-netanyahus-record-reign-2021-06-13/)\n\nEnding over two years of instability, Israel\'s Parliament (the Knesset) voted to support a new coalition government led by right wing businessman Naftali Bennett, whose party won 6 seats in the last elections. The coalition has a slender margin of 60-59 in the 120 member house (one seat is vacant), including hard right parties as well as a large Arab party (20% of Israel\'s citizens are Arab Muslims who have the most democratic rights of any Muslims in the Middle East). The coalition ends the 12 year run of Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been clinging on to power through four inconclusive elections in the last 2 years. As per the deal, Bennett will be replaced by coalition partner Yair Lapid in 2023 in a rotating PM arrangement. Netanyahu has vowed to topple the government within a year and return as PM, if he isn\'t found guilty of corruption first.\n\n2. [Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin hold summit](https://www.dw.com/en/russian-envoy-returns-to-us-after-putin-biden-summit/a-57973552)\n\nThe US President and Russian President held their first meeting since Biden was elected to the position, in a high-level summit in Geneva following a NATO summit. The meeting was tense after Biden called Putin a \'killer\' in a TV interview, but seems to have made some progress on calming relations between the two. After Donald Trump\'s victory in 2016, the Democrats made an anti-Russian foreign policy a signature issue, including by sanctioning countries that purchase significant military hardware from it. But with Biden\'s victory, the countries have agreed to exchange ambassadors after a pause of three months. In separate press conferences, both leaders described the talks as successful. \n\n3. [Delta variant spreading worldwide](https://indianexpress.com/article/world/israel-brings-back-mask-rules-as-variant-spreads-7375714/)\n\nThe contagious Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, which was first detected in India and possibly caused the devastating second wave, is now spreading in over 100 countries. The UK saw a spike is cases despite over 60% of the population being vaccinated, although serious infections were only among the unvaccinated. The country has postponed the so-called "Freedom Day," when restrictions were to be lifted. Similarly, Israel, which vaccinated most of its population, has brought back a mask mandate due to new cases. Sydney went into a one week lockdown after a few cases were detected. And South Africa, which has administered very few shots, is seeing a third wave due to the variant. \n\n4. [Western US bakes in record heat wave, drought](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explained-whats-behind-the-heat-wave-in-the-american-west/articleshow/83625365.cms)\n\nAlmost all of the western US is in the grip of a severe drought and heat wave, with temperatures in the desert city of Phoenix soaring to 48C. While the region is generally more arid than the east, this year\'s conditions are both more extreme and have also appeared earlier than usual, with summer in the region extending well into September. Many regions have declared emergencies due to the heat as well as falling water levels in reservoirs, calling on residents to conserve water and electricity. Water-intensive agriculture is also being blamed, with many California farmers moving away from growing almonds, one of the most water-intensive crops in the world. Almond consumption has increased significantly in the US with the popularity of "almond milk" among environmentally-conscious young people.\n\n5. [Knife attack in Germany kills 3](https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/2138599/somali-kills-three-in-germany-knife-attack)\n\nAn immigrant man from Somalia went on a rampage with a knife, killing 3 and seriously injuring 5, in the Bavarian city of Wuerzburg in Germany. The 24 year-old has been living in the city since 2015 and has previously been treated for a psychiatric condition. It is not clear what his motives were. Videos from the attack showed civilians trying to stop the man by throwing folding chairs at him before the police stopped him by shooting him in his leg. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The rise and fall of Alexander Dubček\n\n *This post is the second of a three-post series on the three \'independent\' Communist Eastern European countries: Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia* \n\nTwo countries exist in Eastern Europe today that seem to be getting along just fine: Slovakia and Czechia. Looking at the map, their significant role in the 20th century history of Europe is easy to miss. Before Hitler launched his invasion of Poland to spark WW2, he set his sights on the combined country of Czechoslovakia, first the German-speaking areas of the Sudetenland, and then the Czech areas of Bohemia and Moravia (Slovakia remained a puppet state). Eventually, the country ceased to exist altogether and was subsumed into the Third Reich, only to be restored after the end of WW2 and then subsumed into the Eastern bloc.\n\nWhile Czechoslovakia itself went through ups and downs, the early life of Alexander Dubček (pronounced doob-check) was equally exciting. Born in the Slovak region of Czechoslovakia, his family were ardent socialists, moving to Bishkek in the Soviet Union in 1924 to work in a cooperative factory. They returned in 1938 and Dubček, but then a teenager, joined the underground resistance against the Nazi occupation, where he was injured in fierce fighting even as his brother was killed. After the end of WW2, he joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSC), which seized power in the country but kept a fig leaf of sham elections and an elected rubber-stamp parliament going. Dubček himself received further political and Communist training in Moscow and rose through KSC ranks. \n\nUnder the first KSC dictatorship, the country followed a strict planned economy and a Stalinist control over people through a secret police and extrajudicial killings. Economic reforms did lead to growth, and while it was greater than that in other Eastern bloc countries, the country rapidly fell behind the West that benefitted from the Marshall Plan. Political and social freedom were non-existent. However, things began to change in 1963 with a power struggle in the KSC. A new faction of young Communists, including Dubček, were asserting control and a desire to move away from Stalinism. This faction tasted victory in January, 1968, when Dubček rose as the First Secretary of the KSC, effectively the country\'s president. Notably, he had the blessings of Soviet leader Brezhnev, who called him "Our Sasha" since he has received political training is Moscow.\n\nThe Soviet love didn\'t last. Dubček wanted a clean break with the Soviet system of political and social control, starting what is called the "Prague Spring," a period of rapid social and economic liberalization. Many organizations and industries that were not affiliated to the Communist Party were permitted, censorship on movies and newspapers was lifted, and Dubček\'s own popularity soared. This also caused some unease in the country, as demands for democracy started to grow. But the real unease was in the Warsaw Pact countries including the Soviet Union, which was worried that Czechoslovakia was going to leave the Pact and join the Western Bloc by giving up Communism. There was so much pressure on Dubček that he agreed to talks with Brezhnev in July, to reassure him that despite the internal reforms, the country would remain a faithful member of the Eastern Bloc and a Soviet ally.\n\nThe negotiations failed. Alarmed by increasing criticism of Communism in the Czechoslovak press, the Warsaw Pact invaded the country in August, sending in half a million troops to take control of the state and arresting Dubček and his allies in the leadership (they were taken hostage to Moscow on the same day). A popular resistance led by civilians lasted for eight months but was ultimately crushed by occupying troops. When he returned in 1969, Dubček was forced to resign as First Secretary and eventually expelled from the KSC. However, he remained a popular figure for political and social freedom. In 1989, when Communist control crumbled across the Eastern Bloc, he once again rose to prominence and was present when the entire KSC leadership resigned and dissolved the party. \n\nHe had expressed hope that a more benign Communist dictatorship could continue, but people were so fed up with the system of misery that a new democratic system was put in place. Dubček joined it, being elected the Chairman of the new Federal Assembly that oversaw the dismantling of Communist institutions and eventually the dissolution of the country itself into the two republics of Slovakia and Czechia. He died of a car crash in 1992 and is buried in Bratislava. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What stories caught your attention?

      <li>Title::: "The Story Of Chandragupta Maurya's birth"<br />Body: 'Like all other great men of the ancient world Chandragupta and Chanakya have their life-stories clouded with legends, ancedotes and imaginary accounts. Those who are interested in them for the sake of intellectual entertainment may profitably read Radhakumud Mukherjee\'s „Chandragupta Maurya And His Times‟. We shall give here only so much of their lives as appear to us to have historical sanction.\n\nSome small bands of the Shakyas, amongst whom was born the great Lord Gautam Buddha, had at one time to shift to far off regions because of some disastrous calamity that had befallen them. They called themselves Kshatriyas. However, in those adverse days those displaced Shakyas began to follow other professions for their livelihood. There happened to be a plentiful breed of peacocks in the forest where these tribes later on lived. To keep these peacocks and sell them became one of their professions. So they had „Moriya‟ as their nickname, and the Moriyas formed a class by themselves. One family of these Moriyas came back to settle in the vicinity of Pataliputra. One woman of that Moriya tribe named Mura (Mayura) somehow got access to the harem of the royal palace and soon became the concubine of the Emperor, Mahapadmanand-or „Dhananand‟ as he was generally called. Her son from this Nanda Emperor was the same Emperor Chandragupa.\n\nHowever, when Chandragupta became an emperor, the story of his birth might have appeared derogatory to his greatness and therefore in some books of the time the story was slightly altered to mean that Muradevi was the wedded queen of the Nanda emperor, not his concubine, which in consequence meant that Chandragupta was a legitimate royal prince and not an illegitimate one.\n\nBut a third anecdote seems to outdo both the above, stories saying that Mura and Emperor Nanda were in no way connected. Mura had a son from her husband of the same clan and that son was Chandragupta himself. Later on with the help and guidance of Arya Chanakya and with his own valour he raised his poor father and mother to eminence and after wresting the imperial power from the Nandas he founded the Maurya Dynasty\n\nIt seems a common weakness among all human societies and communities, in a greater or lesser degree, to attempt to judge the greatness or meanness of an individual, not so much from his manifest virtues or vices as from the race, the community or the family he is born in. That is why as the time passes such inflated anecdotes about their family tradition are propagated and popularized through plays, poems and novels or through folk-lores. There are other anecdotes too besides the ones referred to above, which seek to ascribe greatness or meanness to Chandragupta. But for the reasons given above they need not be mentioned here.\n\nWas Chandragupta a concubines\' son? Was he not a Kshatriya? What matters though! Chandragupta could have said with justifiable pride, “More than any of you, nominal caste-born Kshatriyas, who bowed your heads to the Mlechhas, the Greek emperor and his commanders, I, a „peerless‟ Chandragupta, have a greater claim to being a Kshatriya in as much as with my sword I have completely vanquished those very Mlechhas in every battlefield.” With the same haughty affront of Kama, he could have flung in the face of those railing enemies the following words\n\n"Whether a charioteer or a charioteer\'s son. or whoever (else) I may be, (that is of no consequence !) Birth in a (noble) family depends on fate; but manliness depends on me!"\n\nThe son of Mura is a Maurya! That is precisely why Chandragupta is called a Maurya. Proud of his maternal extraction Chandrgupta designated his royal family as Maurya and immortalized the name of his mother, Muradevi in Indian history. The Maurya emperors accepted the same Moriya caste too, (one which traded in peacocks) that belonged to his mother. The guardian deity of the Maurya family is also a „Peacock‟. This fact is corroborated by rock inscriptions. The Ashoka pillar found at Nandangad bears at the foot a picture of a peacock. The stories from the life of Ashoka inscribed on the celebrated „stupas‟ at Sanchi have similar figures of peacock carved beside them\n\n-Excerpted from \'Six Glorious Epochs of Indian History, a nationalist account of Indian history written by Swatantryaveer Savarkar.'<br />Author: 'bradyismyname'  id: 'o8ocl3'<br />Score:58<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/o8ocl3/the_story_of_chandragupta_mauryas_birth/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'June 25, 1975- One of the most darkest phase in modern Indian History - The Emergency'<br />Body: ' \n\n**How was Emergency imposed**\n\nJune 1975 depicts the darkest month in the history of independent India. The Allahabad High Court held then Prime Minister **Indira Gandhi**    to be guilty of corrupt electoral practices and disqualified her from    contesting elections for 6 years. After she was not granted a total   stay  by the Supreme Court, Gandhi imposed national Emergency upon the    country.\n\n**Raj  Narain files election petition in April 1971 before the Allahabad High Court.**\n\nRaj   Narain, influenced by the rumour  about chemical treatment of ballot   papers amongst other grounds of  corrupt electoral practices, filed an   election petition in April 1971  through advocate **Ramesh Chandra Shrivastava** before the Allahabad High Court. He engaged Senior advocate **Shanti Bhushan** \\[then a member of INC (O)\\] to represent him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**June  12, 1975 Indira Gandhi was found to  have indulged in corrupt  practices**\n\nThe   judgment was pronounced on  June  12, 1975. Indira Gandhi was found to   have indulged in corrupt  practices on account of rostrums constructed  by  government officers and  that her election agent Yashpal Kapoor  worked  at her instance in the  election while being a gazetted officer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Indira Gandhi appeals in SC for stay**\n\nGandhi    appealed before the Supreme Court. As summer vacations were running,    the appeal came to be presented before the vacation judge – Justice **VR Krishna Iyer**.    At that time, the vacation judge, unlike today, sat only on Tuesdays    and Fridays. On June 20, the Advocate-on-Record for Gandhi, **JB Dadachandji**, mentioned the matter for an early date. The date of hearing was fixed on the coming Monday i.e. June 23.\n\nAfter    hearing the arguments on stay application, Justice Krishna Iyer    reserved judgment and pronounced the same on the next day, June 24, at    3:45pm. After hearing Shanti Bhushan and **Nani Palkhivala** (for Gandhi), a [conditional stay was granted](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1240174/), but it was clarified that there was no legal embargo on Indira Gandhi continuing as the Prime Minister.\n\nThe next day after Indira Gandhi got stay from a vacation Judge. President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed had declared national Emergency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Leaders arrested**\n\nJune   24, 1975, at midnight, political leaders of the opposition  including   Jai Prakash Narayan, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, LK Advani, Morarji  Desai,   and Charan Singh were picked up and lodged in jails and at 10 AM\n\n**A small story that took place in  Ramlila Maida**\n\nIt  was past 9 pm and the night  had got colder although the rain had   stopped. I said to a colleague from the  Hindustan Times that I thought   people might start to leave unless somebody said  something more   inspirational. “Don’t worry,” he replied with a smile, “nobody  will   leave until Atalji speaks. Everyone here has come just to hear him.” He    pointed to a small man with steel-grey hair, the last speaker that   evening.\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because he is the best  orator in India.  Have you never heard him speak?”\n\n“No. I’ve only been in  journalism since he went to jail.”\n\n“Well, you’re in for a treat.  And to hear him for the first time today will really be something.”\n\nIt was well past 9.30 pm when  Atalji’s turn finally came and as he rose to speak the huge crowd stood up and  started to clap.\n\nHe  paused. The crowd went  wild.  Then, raising both  arms to silence the  crowd and closing his eyes in the manner of a practiced  actor, he said,\n\n&gt;***Baad muddat ke mile hain deewane***\n\nHe paused. The crowd went  wild.\n\nWhen the applause died he  closed his eyes again and allowed himself another long pause before saying,\n\n&gt;***Kehne sunne ko bahut hain afsane.***\n\nThe  cheering was more prolonged, and when it stopped he paused again   with  his eyes closed before delivering the last line of a verse that he   told me  later he had composed on the spur of the moment.\n\n&gt;***Khuli hawa mein zara saans to  le lein,  kab tak rahegi aazadi kaun jaane?***\n\nThe crowd was now hysterical.  The clapping and shouting went on for many minutes\n\nLet us admire and pay respect to all those who fought during the Emergency to restore democracy back in India.\n\n&gt;***Baad muddat ke mile hain deewane ,Kehne sunne ko bahut hain afsane.,Khuli hawa mein zara saans to  le lein,  kab tak rahegi aazadi kaun jaane?***\n\n**Translation**\n\n&gt;***It has been an age since  we whom they call mad have had the courage to meet.There are tales to tell and tales to  hear.But first let us breathe deeply of  the free air for we know not how long our freedom will last***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ***Complete story of Emergency***\n\n[*45  years since the Emergency: How the electoral practices case against  Indira Gandhi progressed in the courts.

But the Pushpak Vimana was returned to Kuber after the War with Ravana.\n\n6. Creating Fake atheist accounts to push the negetavies they have found and fabricated of Hinduism. Most of it wrong and one Google search later the truth is revealed mostly.\n\n7.

Actually most of them are low-caste Hindus who embraced Islam at the point of the sword."'<br />Body: 'Following is an excerpt from book \'*Heart of India*\' by Alexander Campbell. He was Time magazine\'s correspondent in New Delhi in the 1950s. The book is an account of Indian bureaucracy and economic policies. Published 1958, it was banned by the Indian government in 1959 on grounds of being “repulsive”. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n... On the plane I met a Punjabi, and began to understand why the Punjabis dominated West Pakistan and why the Bengalis of East Pakistan disliked them so much.\nHe was a powerfully built man, with arrogant nostrils and heavy-lidded eyes. He lit a cigarette, and examined me curiously.\n\n"You are traveling in our country? You have been to many places?" \n\nI said I had come from Karachi, and before that had been in Dacca.\n\n"Ah, those Bengalis of East Pakistan!" he said, with contempt. "They are not people one should bother oneself with. They all themselves Moslems, but it is only skin-deep. Actually most of them are low-caste Hindus who embraced Islam at the point of the sword. Now they would like to go back to India and Hinduism, if they could. They can talk about nothing but \'Calcutta, Calcutta, Calcutta.\' They are born twisters and intriguers, every one of them. If it were not for its jute, we would be well rid of East Pakistan, I tell you.\n\nHe laughed. "Losing the jute would be a small price to pay to free ourselves of the Bengalis, with their limp handshakes and false smiles. Punjabis and Bengalis have nothing in common. We eat wheat, they eat rice; we speak Urdu, they speak Bengali.\nEast Pakistan had been a mistake, he thought. "The Moslems should have demanded the whole of the Punjab, including the five rivers. To get it, we could have made common cause with all the hill people, who have always been true Moslems. India would have been dependent on us for its water, and would not have dared to seize Kashmir. Instead of this, we have East Pakistan, which we have to subsidize and which is full of Hindu and Nehru is left in control of the canals system and can blackmail us by threatening to dry up our fields." \n\nHe hated the Sikhs and the Hindus. "The Sikhs are butchers. When they ruled in Lahore, they persecuted the Moslems far more than they did the Hindus, though they claim that their religion is closer to ours. At the time of the Partition it was the Sikhs who turned the Moslems out of the Punjab, which is rightfully ours. There was a great killing of Moslems, and the Sikhs did the killing. The Hindus, who have no stomach for fighting, waited until the Sikhs had done their dirty work for them, then preyed on helpless Moslem women. Thousands of our women were abducted into India by Hindus. It is a wrong that has still to be righted, and in God\'s good time it will be," he said fiercely.\n\nWe parted when the plane came down at Lahore...\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInterview with an Islamic scholar from Pakistan:\n\n… I began to ask him some political questions, but he put them aside with a motion of one fine hand.\n\n"Politics and politicians! My concern is with higher matters. The people do not read the Koran and think only of their bel-lies. First they must regain their souls. Pakistan was created to be an instrument of the divine will. It must be tempered and be-come a sword. Among unbelievers our deadliest enemy is the Hindu, who tirelessly seeks our destruction. Our fathers knew this well: they know how to treat Hindus. Sooner or later there must be a jehad—a holy war against the Hindus who slaughtered our men and debauched our women. If the people of the plains fail us, we shall turn to the people of the hills, as we did nine years ago in the war for Kashmir. It is from the hills that our salvation has always come, for there the fire of Islam still bums." \n\nI looked into his glowing eyes and realized he was utterly sincere...

Its also interesting how ancient Egypt and Indus Valley civilizations are also now abandoned areas in the desert. **Could it be that its easy to find ancient artifacts in these places because they're abandoned and untouched for millenias?** You just need to dig the ground, because  usually the sand covers the tools and structures. \n\nWe know for example that the Sumerians of Mesopotamia did a lot of trade with far away places that aren't just ancient Egypt and Indus. This proves that these far away places had sophisticated shipping systems, which suggests that they may also have civilizations just as old and advanced as theirs during that time. **Could it be that the reason why historians can't find ancient artifacts in other non-abandoned places is because the people who lived there constantly recycled and replaced old tools and structures?** \n\nIf that's true, then maybe there were civilizations just as old as the Harappans in the Gangetic, Narmada, Godavari and Kaveri plains.

But let\'s dive into what it actually means.\n\n&gt;An **attenuated vaccine** (or a live attenuated vaccine) is a [vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine) created by reducing the [virulence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence) of a [pathogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen), but still keeping it viable (or "live").[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine#cite_note-1) Attenuation takes an infectious agent and alters it so that it becomes harmless or less virulent.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine#cite_note-2) These vaccines contrast to those produced by "killing" the virus ([inactivated vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inactivated_vaccine)).\n\nFrom Wikipedia. Now, let\'s not get ahead of ourselves and just say that this device "deactivates" the virus and makes it less harmful for the human body. Okay, fine. Now while I personally don\'t have any belief in this, I don\'t have any resources to back up my disbelief, so let\'s leave that be and move on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow let\'s move onto more murky waters:\n\n* This thing has a power rating of 40W, and a described ideal coverage area of 10,000 Cu.Ft.\n\nAssuming my calculations are correct(which they might not be, so don\'t quote me on that), 10k cubic feet is just under 3 lakh liters. That\'s about... yeah, no way to visualize that neatly comes to mind, so assume a room of 10 x 10 x 3 meters. That is a big room. Let\'s be nice and say it\'s only half that. That is still one big ass room. Asking around in discord, I was met with an example of an elevated water tank used to store the water of an entire area, which is around 10 lakh liters. 3 lakh is 1/3 of an elevated water tank. So let\'s go 1/6th.\n\nSo the device claims that a 40W device powers and covers an volume of 1/6th that of a water tank. Sure..... Okay, I\'m being an ass, that is what a light bulb normally does as well. But let\'s keep that on hold, and dive deeper.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* How does Shycocan work?\n\n&gt;The Coronavirus is a Positive-Sense virus, whose S-Protein attaches to  the human cell through the ACE2 receptors due to the opposite charge.  All human cells have a negative potential (about -40mV to -70mV). The  virus infuses its RNA into the cells and starts to multiply, infecting  the body. Shycocan continuously emits photons that form an electron  cloud in an indoor space. The negative charged electrons neutralize the  positive charge of the S-Protein of Coronavirus, thereby disabling it  from infecting a person.\n\nPositive Sense viruses, from the Wikipedia page, talk about senses in the sense(hah, nice) of the role the RNA strand plays in specifying the sequence of Amino Acids, and nothing about electric charges. But let\'s entertain that idea for a bit.\n\nThe S-Glycoprotein on the spike of the Covid-19 virus is positively charged and the ACE2 receptors are negatively charged, agreed. Let\'s move on the claims of it creating an electron cloud that helps neutralize the corona virus.\n\nSo... the device specification does not list what frequency of light it uses(or I wasn\'t able to find it), so let\'s run down the possibilities. We have Microwave, IR, Visible, or X-ray, UV and Gamma. So.... if we assume it\'s anything on UV, X-ray, or Gamma side of the spectrum.... UV causes skin cancer, X-rays can cause issues, and Gamma is straight up radiation which can kill you. I\'m not gonna link images of how Gamma Radiation poisoning looks like, nor would I recommend searching it on google, but if you wish, feel free to. The device says that it has no harmful effects on the human body, so it is most definitely not this. I\'m going to assume it\'s not visible light, cause if it was, then we could just use our normal bulbs. Let\'s go to Radio, IR and Microwave. That has less energy than visible light. So if visible light didn\'t excite those electrons..... Yeah... anything below that isn\'t going to either.\n\nThe concept I assume is Photo Electric Emission of Light. That.... only works on metals. So you also need to have metals on which our mystery photons have to be absorbed on.\n\nClaimed Electron cloud... has to propagate through either empty space or through atoms. So if they get absorbed into surroundings atoms, from the very same atoms they were emitted from, it defeats the purpose. If you excite them hard enough that they stay away from their atoms for a while? We\'re in luck, that is an actual thing. It\'s called Plasma. Guess what\'s cold in Plasma? 10000 Kelvin. Yeah. Safe to assume we\'re not living. Why die from Covid, when you can die by being burned alive by a... checks notes... yeah, 40W device. Man, I want one. All jokes aside, this is dumb. How a 40W device generates enough power to create plasma is beyond me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Shycocan does not effect any other microbes and only attacks covid virus.\n\n&gt;Shycocan does not affect any bacteria, fungi or other microbes; other  than the Coronavirus family of viruses. It is very critical to maintain a  balance of microbes in the environment, as a very sanitized environment  can increase toxicity and compromise the immune system of humans.\n\nElectrons do not really distinguish between virus and bacteria. They attack any surface, assuming that we ignore all science said beforehand, and that the electrons are actually behaving like how Shycocan says they do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Certifications available for Shycocan\n\nFrom the Shycocan FAQ page:\n\n&gt;Shycocan is a certified European Union CE Class-I product and is being  marketed under the “Enforcement Discretion Guidance” based on the US  FDA’s guidance during the\xa0 COVID-19 Pandemic/ Public Health Emergency.  It has passed all safety tests related to these certifications for  household appliances, emission, disturbances, laboratory use, Ozone  production amongst others. Shycocan attenuates up to 99.9% of the  Coronavirus from transmission in closed spaces as per tests conducted by  a leading virology lab in the world.\n\nCE Class-1 Products:\n\n&gt;Class  I Medical Devices are considered as low risk  devices compared to other type of Medical devices. As  per European MDD,  non-sterile and non-measurable Class I devices are exempted from Notified Body audit and Certification.\n\nSo non Certified products. Got it.\n\nNow while I make no claims on the product\'s viability or lack thereof, I leave that to your conclusion. I\'m free to changing my find should anyone give any proof of this actually working as advertised with the same science used as it claims. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSources\n\n1.

Beautiful houries, fair maidens with limpid black eyes wait to serve you and they look after you... Good life is there, not here on this earth": Pakistani terrorist Ajmal Kasab'<br />Body: 'Following is an excerpt from Former Police Commissioner of Mumbai Rakesh Maria\'s famed book "**Let Me Say it Now**"\n\nLate one night he (terrorist Kasab) was giving me (Officer Rakesh Maria) some details. The conviction with which he spoke, prompted me to ask him again: *‘What do you get when you do all this? How could you do it? Why did you do it?’* \n\nAnd he began earnestly, *‘Janab, you don’t understand. Our ustads have told us that when you die in jihad, your bodies glow. They start exuding a fragrance. Allah then receives you in heaven. Beautiful houries (*women who will accompany faithful Muslim believers in Paradise*), fair maidens with limpid black eyes wait to serve you and they look after you. You get every possible luxury. Good life is there, not here on this earth.’*\n\n*‘Don’t you feel any remorse at killing innocent people? Killing and orphaning children? People who had done nothing wrong? Nothing to you?’* \n\n*‘No, Janab,’ he said, shaking his head. ‘On the contrary, I am sad that I did not die. I should have died in jihad. It is the greatest misfortune of my life that I was not martyred.’* \n\nThis was approximately three weeks after the attacks. Dinesh Kadam and I were interrogating him. We had not yet told him that all the other fidayeens had been killed in the attacks. He knew that his buddy Ismail had been badly injured, but not that he had died. I looked at him and could bear his insolence no more.\n\n*‘Come with me. Get up,’ I said and stood up. The others were taken aback.*\n\n*‘Where?’* Their faces quizzed me. It was about 3.30 in the morning. I took Dinesh Kadam aside and told him what I wanted to do. He arranged for the vehicles. In a few minutes, the convoy was heading towards the J.J. Hospital morgue, with Kasab secured in one of the vehicles. The ‘Jannat’ (Paradise) where his nine mates lay in the freezer. \n\n*‘Ye dekh! Yeh hain tere jihadi dost jo Jannat mein hain.’* (Look at them. These are your jihadi friends who are now in Paradise) I said, as he stared open-mouthed. \n\nThe stench was unbearable and was churning our insides. The faces were ghastly. A bullet had pierced a terrorist’s eye. Some were very badly burnt, and the acrid smell of charred putrefying flesh pervaded the air.\n\n*‘What do your ustads say? Fragrance, huh? Glow? Where is the fragrance? Where is the glow? Is this the fragrance? Is this the glow?’* I kept asking him. He had no answer.\n\n*‘If your ustads say that death in jihad gives you Jannat and your bodies glow and spread fragrance, and you get houries to serve you, why can’t they go die in jihad themselves? Why do they send you? Because they want to enjoy the hell here? Are they not interested in dying in jihad and going to Jannat?’* I asked him and his face contorted, as if all the blood had drained out of it. He sat down on the floor, holding his sides as if he wanted to vomit.\n\nAs we emerged from the morgue, I could see that he was totally dazed and shocked. A man cheated. Disillusioned. Taken for a rollicking ride. Even then, not once did he say, then or ever, that he was repentant. Not once did he say, *‘ Mujhse galati ho gayi*’ – I have made a mistake. Not once did he say, *‘Mujhe maaf kar do’* – pardon me. He knew that what he had done was unpardonable, whatever its justification.\n\nNow I felt a little light. Meri bhadaas baahar nikal chuki thee , as we would say in Hindi. My suppressed anger was released. \n\nThe convoy came to the Metro junction, the stretch around which this monster had unleashed Death just a few days ago, killing my dear colleagues and innocent fellow citizens. I don’t know what came over me again. I stopped the convoy and got out of my car. I made them take Kasab out. It must have been around 04.30 in the morning. The winter night was chilly and the temples and mosques had still not woken up the gods.\n\n*‘Bend down and touch the ground with your forehead,’* I ordered Kasab. Spooked, he meekly followed my instructions.\n\n*‘Now say, “Bharat Mata ki jai”*,’ (Victory to Mother India) I commanded. *‘Bharat Mata ki jai!’* said Kasab. **Not satisfied with just once, I made him repeat it twice.**'<br />Author: 'bradyismyname'  id: 'o68izd'<br />Score:147<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/o68izd/when_you_die_in_jihad_your_bodies_glow_they_start/</li>

      <li>Title::: "While revisionist historians these days argue that Aurangzeb was not a bigot, even his contemporaries would disagree. Read Shivaji 's letter to Aurangzeb on the Jaziya"<br />Body: 'Source - Shivaji and his times by Jadunath Sarkar, pp 366-368.\n\nOriginally composed by his minister Nila Prabhu in Persian and sent around Sept / Oct 1679.\n\nThe full text is reproduced below. Read it and come to your own conclusions.\n\n\\\\To the Emperor Alamgir:\n\nThis firm and constant well-wisher Shivaji, after rendering thanks for the grace of God and the favours of the Emperor, which are clearer than the Sun, begs to inform your Majesty that, although this well-wisher was led by his adverse Fate to come away from your august presence without taking leave, yet he is ever ready to perform, to the fullest extent possible and proper, everything that duty as a servant and gratitude demand of him… It has recently come to my ears that on the ground of the war with me having exhausted your wealth and emptied your treasury, your Majesty has ordered that money under the name of jaziya should be collected from the Hindus and the imperial needs supplied with it. May it please your Majesty!\n\nThat architect of the fabric of empire, [Jalal-ud-din] Akbar Padishah, reigned with full power for 52 (lunar) years. He adopted the admirable policy of universal harmony (sulh-i-kul) in relation to all the various sects, such as Christians, Jews, Muslims, Dadu’s followers, sky-worshippers (falakia), malakia, heathens (ansaria), atheists (daharia), Brahmans and Jain priests. The aim of his liberal heart was to cherish and protect all the people. So, he became famous under the title of Jagat Guru, ‘the World’s spiritual guide.’\n\nNext, the Emperor Nur-ud-din Jahangir for 22 years spread his gracious shade on the head of the world and its dwellers, gave his heart to his friends and his hand to his work, and gained his desires. The Emperor Shāh Jahān for 32 years cast his blessed shadow on the head of the world and gathered the fruit of eternal life, which is only a synonym for goodness and fair fame, as the result of his happy time on earth.\n\nHe who lives with a good name gains everlasting wealth,\n\nBecause after his death, the recital of his good deeds keeps his name alive.  (Verse form)\n\nThrough the auspicious effect of this sublime disposition, wherever he (Akbar) bent the glance of his august wish, victory and success advanced to welcome him on the way. In his reign many kingdoms and forts were conquered [by him]. The state and power of these Emperors can be easily understood from the fact that Alamgir Padishāh has failed and become distracted in the attempt to merely follow their political system. They, too, had the power of levying the jaziya ; but they did not give place to bigotry in their hearts, as they considered all men, high and low, created by God to be [living] examples of the nature of diverse creeds and temperaments. Their kindness and benevolence endure on the pages of time as their memorial, and so prayer and praise for these three pure souls will dwell forever in the hearts and tongues of mankind, among both great and small. Prosperity is the fruit of one’s intentions. Therefore, their wealth and good fortune continued to increase, as God’s creatures reposed in the cradle of peace and safety (under their rule), and their undertakings succeeded.\n\nBut in your Majesty’s reign, many of the forts and provinces have gone out of your possession, and the rest will soon do so too, because there will be no slackness on my part in ruining and devastating them. Your peasants are downtrodden; the yield of every village has declined, in the place of one lakh [of Rupees] only one thousand, and in the place of a thousand only ten are collected, and that too with difficulty. When poverty and beggary have made their homes in the palaces of the Emperor and the Princes, the condition of the grandees and officers can be easily imagined. It is a reign in which the army is in a ferment, the merchants complain, the Muslims cry, the Hindus are grilled, most men lack bread at night and in the day inflame their own cheeks by slapping them in anguish.\n\nHow can the royal spirit permit you to add the hardship of the jaziya to this grievous state of things? The infamy will quickly spread from west to east and become recorded in books of history that the Emperor of Hindustan, covering the beggars’ bowls, takes jaziya from Brahmans and Jain monks, yogis, sannyāsis, bairāgis, paupers, mendicants, ruined wretches, and the famine-stricken,–that his valour is shown by attacks on the wallets of beggars,-that he dashes down to the ground the name and honour of the Timurids!\n\nMay it please your Majesty! If you believe in the true Divine Book and Word of God (i.e., the Quran), you will find there that God is styled Rabb-ul-ālamin, the Lord of all men, and not Rabb-ul-musalmin, the Lord of the Muhammadans only. Verily, Islām and Hinduism are terms of contrast. They are (diverse pigments) used by the true Divine Painter for blending the colours and filling in the outlines of His picture of the entire human species. If it be a mosque, the call to prayer is chanted in remembrance of Him. If it be a temple, the bell is rung in yearning for Him only. To show bigotry for any man’s own creed and practices is equivalent to altering the words of the Holy Book. To draw new lines on a picture is equivalent to finding fault with the painter.\n\nIn strict justice the jaziya is not at all lawful. From the political point of view, it can be allowable only if a beautiful woman wearing gold ornaments can pass from one province to another without fear or molestation. [But] in these days even the cities are being plundered, what shall I say of the open country? Apart from its injustice, this imposition of the jaziya is an innovation in India and inexpedient.\n\nIf you imagine piety to consist in oppressing the people and terrorising the Hindus, you ought first to levy the jaziya from Ränā Rāj Singh, who is the head of the Hindus. Then it will not be so very difficult to collect it from me, as I am at your service. But to oppress ants and flies is far from displaying valour and spirit.\n\nI wonder at the strange fidelity of your officers that they neglect to tell you of the true state of things but cover a blazing fire with straw! May the Sun of your royalty continue to shine above the horizon of greatness!\n\n\\\\\n\nEnd text.'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'o67bcl'<br />Score:152<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/o67bcl/while_revisionist_historians_these_days_argue/</li>

GoI introduced a new data bill which Twitter refuses to comply with and as a result has list intermediary status, which means they will be held liable for posts on their platform. Obviously there is much debate on the new data bill, but this is nit about that. This is my take on the whole politics of this, hence the title "BJP vs Twitter".\n\nNow BJP is the first party in India to join Twitter and truly understand the significance of social media. Congress\' twitter account would be crated 3 yrs after BJP and Rahul Gandhi arrived 6 yrs after Narendra Modi, so BJP definitely enjoyed a first mover advantage. They embraced social media, was the first party to set up an IT Cell and it definitely helped them win 2014 elections. That\'s the reason BJP came to love twitter.\n\nBut a lot has changed since, and IMO there are two reasons for it:\n\nTwitter\'s left bias is a major factor. The CEO Jack Dorsey admitted to Twitter as a whole having a left leaning bias in an interview with CNN. And as BJP is the "right-wing" in India (although I disagree) is treated unfairly. The ex CEO of India, Mahima Kaul was also quite anti-BJP. Twitter flagged Sambir Patra\'s tweet as manipulated media but promoted the false narrative of the recent incident in Ghaziabad, where some left journalists claimed that a muslim man was beaten and his beard shaven by hindu goons, but UP Police claimed that the matter was personal, there was also no audio in the original video. BJP has also witnessed how Twitter came back at Trump and may have fear that they could deplatform Modi, which I seriously doubt because Modi uses Twitter much more responsibly than Trump.\n\nAnother reason could be that other parties are also using Twitter effectively and are running efficient campaigns to counter BJP\'s narrative. So the marginal utility of social media has reduced for the BJP.\n\n\n\nThis is my take on the Political side of the whole fiasco.

I am currently living in the state of Telangana, and recently the state government has taken the decision to unlock everything, including the educational institutions, at a time when an inescapable, inevitable third wave is impending. When asked about this action, our honorable CM KCR had to say, “Did Corona call them and tell?", implying if Corona had called us to let us know that it\'s gonna be back with a third wave. Further, he even had the audacity to demean millions of the people who died amidst this pandemic by stating that he was prescribed antibiotics by the doc when he was tested positive for Covid and even after not taking those on time, he managed to survive, therefore, implying so can others.\nMr. CM, first of all, your statement reeks of privelege. You had access to world class doctors and treatment, thanks to your power and riches, at a time where millions were dying because of their inability to acces treatment due to financial constraints.

      <li>Title::: 'How water purifier companies fool you and why you might be drinking RO water wrongly!!'<br />Body: "Some of you might be aware that [National Green Tribunal (NGT) recently asked GoI to put a ban on RO water purifiers](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ngt-asks-govt-to-ban-ro-purifiers-that-demineralises-water/article32075468.ece) in regions with TDS &lt;500 (TDS is a measure of minerals present in water). There were two main reasons for this:\n\n1. **Demineralized water:** ROs reduces the TDS of water by 90-95%. If RO is used in areas with low TDS, RO actually demineralizes the water to TDS level as low as 20. *Such demineralised water is not fit for drinking purposes as it lacks several essential minerals that our body needs.*  \n\n   1. Drinking demineralized water over long duration can cause several health issues like - *Cardiovascular diseases, pregnancy disorders, certain kind of cancers and weak bones.* WHO published a report on this which you can read in detail [here](https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientschap12.pdf).\n2. **High water wastage:** ROs reject over 75% of water which is not justified, more so when the input water is already good.\n\nAll this is fine, but what should we do? We need RO to be sure that water is really pure, especially in India, where several water quality norms are overlooked.\n\nI have been researching on this topic for last 2 months now. The fact is there are better technologies available but big water purifier brands have a market to protect and ignorant consumers are regularly being fooled.\n\n**Here are some things you should know:**\n\n1. Most households do not really need an RO filtration if their TDS is &lt;300...in-fact upto 1000 as well. Consumers are regularly made to feel like they're missing out on an important technology and having an RO will further improve the water.\n2. WHO rates water with TDS between 150 to 300 as excellent for drinking. If your source water is already having &lt;1000 TDS, you should go for technologies like Nanofilteration (NF), which works very similar to RO technology but reduces TDS only by 20% to 80%. Also, their rejection rate is low, and wastes much less water as compared to RO. This technology is developed and promoted by Bhabha Atomic research centre (BARC) but it seems no big brand is interested in using it as it is an open technology and might take away their marketshare.\n3. Most RO filters come with a TDS regulator/taste regulator, which is also one of the most controversial innovations of domestic purification industry. TDS regulator is nothing but a bypass valve which mixes impure water back to pure water to increase the overall TDS. This just defeats the whole purpose of RO filtration. Not only does RO brands use it to cover up the incompetencies of RO filter but they also market it as a 'Feature' to charge more from the customer!\n4. Similarly, UV technology is actually not needed if you're storing water for more than 12 hrs. UV rays deactivates bacteria for some time and does not kill it. It is again one of those gimmick that water purifier companies have created to market their products. Also, your carbon filter and RO filters both prevent bacterias from passing through...so UV is not always needed.\n5. If you're using cheap ROs like Aqua-fresh etc. - you should be aware even more. It is simply not possible to provide a water filter with UV+UF+TDS+ RO+ Alkaline in just Rs.5000. Most of such ROs use very low quality filters which are just there as a showpiece. Also, these purifiers use low quality plastic which is not food safe. Demineralized water is highly reactive and has potential to even dissolve plastic slowly. Consuming such water is carcinogenic and can cause cancer.\n6. Most RO's use UF filters after RO purification stage. This is like you are using a fine sieve first and then using a course sieve. UF filters are almost always a gimmick with ROs and usually of very low quality (coz it's not going to filter anything anyway)\n\n**So which RO purifier is right for you:**\n\n1. Buy from trusted brands only. Do not go with local/cheap alternatives. It's important for you and your family's health.\n2. Basis TDS  \n\n   1. If your TDS &lt; 200, you may choose to not use NF or RO at all and just rely on carbon and sediment filter for purification. You may choose to use 20% rejection NF just to be sure of occasional impurities that might come in your water.\n   2. If TDS &lt; 1000, go for Nanofilteration instead of RO. There are several young companies who provide this technology. You can DM me if you're not able to find one.\n   3. If TDS is between 1000 to 2000, go for Low TDS RO filters with rejection rates upto 90% max.\n   4. If TDS &gt; 2000, you should go for high TDS RO filters with rejection rate of 95%.\n3. Pre-filters, Sediment and Carbon filter are much more important than UV, UF filters etc. Always ensure your filter has good quality of these filters. Don't fall for the marketing gimmicks of big brands.\n\nI hope this article was helpful. If yes, do let me know what quality of water you were drinking so far and if you would be making any changes to switch to a more healthier option.\n\nIn case you need more details or suggestions for the right water filter for your house, pl feel free to DM me.

      <li>Title::: "[Part - II] - India's Middle East Policy : Narasimha Rao - The Game Changer , India's structural shift in Gulf"<br />Body: "In the last post I had summarised how India fared in the 60s and how its economic ties were in the middle east countries. India struggled in 60s to gain any support from the Islamic world except the somewhat liberal Country Egypt which was under the rule of the liberal Gamal Abdel Nasser. This relation had strained relations with other gulf countries. We see now how India slowly moved away from this to establish good economic ties with major gulf countries and in the process also discovered new regional players.\n\nIf you have missed my earlier series , please read it here -\n\n[India's Middle East Policy : Relation with Egypt , Saudi Arabia and the 1965 War](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/o1nxby/indias_middle_east_policy_relation_with_egypt/)\n\n# Structural Shocks of early 1990\n\nIndia reoriented its Middle East policy after some structural shocks that shook the world in the 1990s. \n\n**Gulf War and the Oslo Peace process** \n\nThe divisions in the Arab world left India with new diplomatic space to engage with regional actors it had previously neglected due to concerns of diplomatic repercussions. At the same time India was facing a domestic economic crisis and was forced to rethink its foreign economic strategy. \n\nDisintegration of Sovient Union in 1991 also left India politically isolated. In the midst of all this the death of Rajiv Gandhi led the Indian National Congress (INC) government to choose a compromise figure, Narasimha Rao, to become India’s Prime Minister in 1991. \n\n# Narasimha Rao - The Game Changer\n\nNarasimha Rao was 70 by the time of his appointment but he had considerable ministerial and foreign policy experience in his basket. He was characterized by both cognitive complexity and cognitive openness which made him uniquely able and willing to push for foreign policy adjustments when he came to power\n\nThe most important thing was he had no political constituency or ambitions of his own something very rare in those days.\n\nHe won a by-election in Nandyal to join the parliament from Nandyal with a victory margin of a record 5 lakh (500, 000) votes, his win was recorded in the Guinness Book Of World Records. \n\n# Appointed Subramanian Swamy and Atal Bihari Vajpayee - only instance that an opposition party member was given a Cabinet rank post by the ruling party\n\nAn interesting trademark of Roa was he looked beyong his party. He broke a convention by appointing a non-political economist and future prime minister, Manmohan Singh as his Finance Minister.  He also appointed Subramanian Swamy, an opposition party member as the Chairman of the Commission on Labour Standards and International Trade. This has been the only instance that an opposition party member was given a Cabinet rank post by the ruling party. He also sent opposition leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to represent India in a UN meeting at Geneva\n\n**Israel - New Found Love**\n\nOne major indicator of this policy shift was the establishment of full diplomatic relations, in January 1992, with Israel, a country that Indian political leaders had long neglected for fear of estranging Arab partners or India’s own domestic Muslim population.\n\nThe Iraqi intrusion into Kuwait diverted attention from Israel as the Saddam Hussein regime became the new source of concern in the region . India no longer needed to systematically condemn Israel to obtain Arab sympathies.\n\nThe Madrid Conference of October 1991 created a window of opportunity for India under Rao to develop a strategic partnership with Israel while maintaining relations with other Middle Eastern countries.\n\nMiddle east now was a multipolar world with Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Israel. The establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel was also considered by Rao to be a necessary step to improve ties with the U.S., a close Israeli ally, in the post-Cold War era\n\nThe normalization of ties with Israel not only helped India develop stronger defence and economic relations with Tel Aviv, but also enabled New Delhi to move past old ideological alignments and engage a wider number of Middle Eastern actors, notably to further its energy and economic interests.\n\n So Narasimha Rao was a great policy entrepreneur who  adroitly exploited the international, regional and domestic changes to  push for a change in India’s approach to the Middle East, and notably a  normalization of ties with Israel.

      <li>Title::: "RSF-org behind primary index for deciding press freedom in each country is primarily funded by US,EU &amp; Soros,Omidyar-(also funding AltNews/Wire).Accused of propaganda for US-led regime change in LatAm &amp; whitewashing censorings by US-approved regimes.And they're against FIR on Zubair for fake news"<br />Body: '&gt;*For years, the press freedom index by the Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has been widely quoted, even though its methodology is biased and RSF was long led by a white supremacist with a penchant for US-led regime change. Now RSF is targeting Asia.*\n\n&gt;According to the recently-issued new World Press Freedom Index (WPFI), the greatest media freedoms prevail in Western Europe and North America and the worst in emerging and developing economies.\n\n&gt;Most media NGOs are led by veteran journalists, whereas the organization behind the Index was founded by Robert Ménard whose media experience was limited to a pirate radio station and an unpopular magazine that performed so poorly it had to be closed down.\n\n&gt;It was then - in 1985 - that and three of his colleagues co-founded the Reporters sans Frontières (Reporters Without Borders, RSF).\n\n#Regime change in Latin America\n\n\n&gt;**Reports published in the Council on Hemispheric Affairs and the US Newspaper Guild journal in 2005 criticized RSF for receiving funding from the US government and Cuba opposition groups, and for being part of a "neocons crusade" against the Castro regime. RSF denied the allegations of a political agenda, but confirmed that it had received a grant from the National Endowment for Democracy which is funded through the State Department and from the Centre for a Free Cuba.[63] In 2006, online magazine CounterPunch said that RSF had falsely linked former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to the murder of journalists and had failed to criticize his successor\'s crackdown on press freedom.[64] RSF was criticized for supporting media outlets that were in favour of the coup attempt in Venezuela in 2002.**[65] In response, RSF stated that it had condemned media support for the coup.[66]\n\nOtto Reich\n\n&gt;**Lucie Morillon, RSF\'s then-Washington representative, confirmed in an interview on 29 April 2005 that the organization had a contract with US State Department\'s Special Envoy to the Western Hemisphere, Otto Reich, who signed it in his capacity as a trustee for the Center for a Free Cuba, to inform Europeans about the repression of journalists in Cuba.[67] CounterPunch criticised RSF for its connection with Reich who, it said, was a major figure in the Iran–Contra affair, "helped coordinate repeated attempts to oust Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez" and "oversaw the February 2004 coup against Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide".**[67]\n\nHaiti\n\n&gt;In 2004, Reporters Without Borders released an annual report on Haiti, saying that a "climate of terror" existed in which attacks and threats persisted against journalists who were critical of Jean-Bertrand Aristide.[74]\n\n&gt;**An August 2006 article in CounterPunch said RSF had ignored similar attacks on journalists, including Pacifica Radio reporter Kevin Pina, under the Latortue government in 2005 and 2006.[75] Pina himself said: "It was clear early on that RWB and Robert Menard were not acting as objective guardians of freedom of the press in Haiti but rather as central actors in what can only be described as a disinformation campaign against Aristide\'s government ... They provide false information and skewed reports to build internal opposition to governments seen as uncontrollable and unpalatable to Washington while softening the ground for their eventual removal by providing justification under the pretext of attacks on the freedom of the press.[75]**\n\nVenezuela\n\n&gt;Le Monde diplomatique criticized RSF\'s attitude towards Hugo Chávez\'s government in Venezuela, in particular during the 2002 coup attempt.[73] **RSF is said to have supported pro-coup media outlets in Venezuela, and to have used an opposition advisor, María Sol Pérez-Schael, as its Caracas correspondent.**[76] In reply, Robert Ménard said that RSF had condemned the Venezuela media\'s support of the coup attempt.[77]\n\n&gt;In 2009, RSF published an open letter to Hugo Chavez in which it stated that Globovision was being "hounded" by the Venezuelan government for its reporting on the 2009 earthquake. The Venezuelan government said that Globovision\'s reporting on the earthquake was inciting disruption to public order. In an article published by Axis of Logic website, Salim Lamrani, criticised Globovision and said RSF had "tried to turn a serious outrage of journalistic ethics and a serious failure of the responsibilities of the media into a violation of the freedom of the press".[78]\n\nAlleged bias in favour of Europe and the U.S.\n\n&gt;In 2007 John Rosenthal argued that RWB showed a bias in favour of European countries.[79] In the 2009 article about RWB and Venezuela cited above, Salim Lamrani stated that "RSF is not an organization that defends freedom of the press, but is an obscure entity with a political agenda precisely commissioned to discredit through all possible means the progressive governments in the world that find themselves on the United States\' blacklist."[78]\n\n\n&gt;**The Observatoire de l\'Action Humanitaire (Centre for Humanitarian Action) criticized RWB\'s lukewarm criticism of US forces for their shelling, in 2003, of Palestine Hotel, in Baghdad, Iraq, which killed two Reuters journalists.** The family of one of the deceased journalists, Spanish citizen José Couso, refused to allow the Spain chapter of RWB to attach its name to a legal action led by the family against the US Army, voicing disgust at the fact that RWB interviewed US forces responsible for the shelling, but not the surviving journalists, and that RWB showed acquiescence to the US Army by thanking them for their "precious help".[76]\n\n&gt; **In 2007, the thankful RSF justified the Iraq invasion, with Ménard arguing for the legality of torture. Similar joint interests mark RSF activities in the Middle East (Libya, Iran, Iraq).**\n\n\n**RSF founder’s white supremacist ventures**\n\n&gt;As the RSF’s first secretary general and its director-general, Ménard ruled the organization almost three decades (1985-2012), like the autocrats it presumably opposes. In the process, he managed to alienate all other co-founders.\n\n&gt;Inspired by political extremism since a child, Ménard grew of age in a family with links to the far-right terrorist OAS; a French paramilitary group that contributed to Algeria’s massacres in the 1950s and terrorism in France, including assassination attempts against President De Gaulle and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre.\n\n&gt;Toward the end of his RSF reign, Ménard embraced far-right publicly. Since 2014, he has served as Mayor of Béziers in Southern France. A known Islamophobic, he has warned Muslim refugees they are not welcome in France. Like ex-President Trump\'s far-right mobs, he touts the white genocide conspiracy that “Jews and globalists” seek to replace whites with Muslims from the Middle East.\n\n&gt;More recently, the RSF has been led by Christophe Deloire, who is more cautious in rhetoric but shares Ménard’s geopolitics and touts the RSF’s new Information and Democracy Forum. Like his predecessor, Deloire has alienated the RSF organization, thanks to restructuring, departures and layoffs.\n\n#RSF FUNDING\n\nWho funds RSF? As per RSF\'s own website over 90% of its funding comes from Institutional grants (like EU/Ministries), private foundations &amp; corporate fundings.\n\nhttps://rsf.org/sites/default/files/financial_report_ven.pdf\n\n**As quoted earlier, it has also itself confirmed to receive funds from US state Department &amp; National Endowment for Democracy- again funded by US govt.**\n\nhttps://archive.is/nbqE8\n\n**RSF\'s website states that the US govt funds it particularly for its reporting on Asia.**\n\n&gt; **The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) supports RSF’s reporting of media freedom violations throughout the world and especially in Asia.**\n\n**Among private foundations here\'s Omidyar acknowledging they fund RSF- same Omidyar which funds AltNews/Caravan/Wire/Scroll/Quint &amp; International Fact Checking Network.

It funds only 20% of its activities internally. Over 40% is based on “institutional grants” (French foreign ministry, French defense ministry), whereas 35% stems from “private foundations and NGOs” (e.g., NEDA, Ford Foundation) and “corporate and individual donations” (e.g., American Express, French bank Société Générale).*\n\n&gt;*Through their funding, billionaires, including George Soros via his Open Society and Pierre Omidyar, have indirectly shaped RSF activities. In return for French and US funds, the RSF has been largely silent about media abuses in France and the West.*\n\nEnding this TIL with 2 little tidbits. \n\n1. A week back, the US journalist who broke the story of Bill Clinton secretly meeting one of the judges presiding in Hilary Mail Investigation was found dead. Little noise in US media about it.\n\nhttps://news.yahoo.com/reporter-broke-story-clinton-lynch-040500274.html\n\n2. Today RSF demanded rescinding of FIR against Muhammad Zubair (cofounder of AltNews-funded by Omidyar), Rana Ayyub &amp; Saba Naqvi for spreading fake news and fanning communal tensions by claiming a Muslim was beaten for not saying Jai Shri Ram in UP, when those accused of beating him are- Arif, Aadil, Mushahid, Parvez Gujjar, Kallu &amp; Polli.\n\nhttps://rsf.org/en/news/three-indian-journalists-could-be-jailed-nine-years-tweets-about-video\n\nhttps://www.thestreet.com/economonitor/news/how-the-world-press-freedom-index-was-politicized-long-before-the-new-cold-wars'<br />Author: 'littichoka'  id: 'o3jtd3'<br />Score:68<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/o3jtd3/rsforg_behind_primary_index_for_deciding_press/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'What has changed in Indian politics over the last 10 years?'<br />Body: 'In early 2010s, I used to watch NDTV shows like Big Fight and We The People, and the sentiment was very different to what exists now. It was open season to attack customs and traditions that are considered Hindu or Indian, but if its a minority custom, then they always say "... just to be fair, this also happens in the majority community". \n\nNowadays, its not so easy to brazenly attack Hindu or Indian culture. Staunch liberals like Arundhati Roy or Ram Guha seem to thread their words carefully when speaking about the majority community. They have to, otherwise they\'ll become irrelevant in India. Its also interesting how minority leaders have toned down their rhetoric. Figures like Asaduddin Owaisi speak in a centrist tone. Even Pak\'s leaders are less hostile towards India. \n\nThis makes me wonder, as to how much influence Hindu unity has over the politics of the Subcontinent. In just two elections, Hindus are viewed differently by non-Hindus and liberals. Now there\'s an understanding that Indian people have their own unique culture and they\'re proud of it. They can\'t be pushed around like before because then they\'ll become more emboldened to safeguard their culture. \n\nFeel free to share your opinion on this'<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'o3j7gs'<br />Score:36<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/o3j7gs/what_has_changed_in_indian_politics_over_the_last/</li>

      <li>Title::: "India's Second Wave COVID crisis: like many countries India also made missteps, but it also got many things right."<br />Body: "**SOME PUBLIC HEALTH SUCCESSES FOR INDIA SUPPORTED BY DATA**\n\n**Scaling Up Health Care Capacity**\n\nLow- and middle-income countries are often denied the same credit for innovation, leadership, and implementation of public health policies as developed nations. Before the pandemic, preparedness indices favored more developed countries, with the UK and the United States listed in the top 5 in the Global Health Security Index (https://www.ghsindex.org). However, even with a modest rank of 57 in the index, India has substantially exceeded expectations, particularly in the way it scaled up testing and treatment facilities during the period of national lockdown in 2020, and managed to reduce overall COVID-19 case-fatality rates from what was expected in 2020.46 Partnerships with private laboratories and hospital networks have enabled India to scale up testing from just 3,000 initially to more than 1.8 million tests per day.47 The country expanded the ICU bed capacity by 3 times (63,758 in September versus 21,806 in April), the number of isolation beds to 1.55 million in September compared to 173,000 in April, and the number of designated COVID-care centers (15,403 in September versus 1,919 in April).48 It is important to stay prepared and continue to build this infrastructure because sweeping surges can happen, as we are noticing with the current oxygen crisis in India’s second wave during April 2021.\n\n**Community Engagement Strategies**\n\nThe public acceptance of masks and nonpharmaceutical interventions in the early months of the pandemic was impressive, given that close social gatherings are an integral part of the cultural fabric of India. The success of community health worker involvement and syndromic surveillance, including in the most affected slum areas of Mumbai,49 shows that India's public health approach can provide a unique example for other countries.\n\n**India’s Vaccine Drive**\n\nIndia started one of the largest COVID-19 vaccine drives in the world on January 16, 2021,54 within a few weeks of finalizing operational guidelines including prioritization of beneficiaries.55 India has approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (locally known as Covishield) and the made-in-India vaccine, Covaxin, for emergency use. As of March 30, 61 million doses have been administered, resulting in 0.65% of the population fully vaccinated while 3.8% had received at least one dose.1 In March, India administered an average of &gt;2.1 million doses per day. Being one of the largest vaccine manufacturers, India has also donated millions of vaccine doses to neighboring countries as a goodwill gesture and has committed to supplying vaccines to many other countries in the world.56 India is expanding the market with emergency use authorizations to other internationally approved vaccines, and vaccines are to be made available to the adult population starting May 1, 2021.\n\n**A COVID-Adaptive Future for India**\n\nEmerging new variants of SARS-CoV-2 are predicted to alter the pandemic trajectory around the world in the coming months. For instance, variant B.1.1.7 can bring about another peak in the COVID-19 case counts in the United States despite community vaccination (assuming 1 million vaccine doses are administered per day beginning January 1, 2021, and that 95% immunity is achieved 14 days after 2 doses).  Many other European countries may experience a similar wave of infections from this variant given the expected vaccination rates there.18 Recently, a variant with double mutations in the spike protein has been discovered in India, and it is not yet clear if this variant is more or less contagious than the dominant one. However, this is an attractive explanation for the current spike.57 A new peak in the COVID-19 trajectory in India is imminent, given the rapidly rising case counts during March 2021. Strategic genomic sequencing to identify known and emerging variants, accelerating vaccinations with more choices for vaccines (including one shot vaccines), and studying vaccine effectiveness against new variants is going to remain crucial in the coming days.\n\n__________\n\n\n[Source](https://www.ghspjournal.org/content/early/2021/06/07/GHSP-D-21-00233)"<br />Author: 'dhatura'  id: 'o3fylj'<br />Score:21<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/o3fylj/indias_second_wave_covid_crisis_like_many/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How many remember that the Taliban in 2001 proposed that Hindus and Sikhs in Afghanistan have to wear a yellow badge? The proposal reminds one of the yellow Star of David that Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany.'<br />Body: 'Living in a deeply religious, overwhelmingly Muslim nation, Afghan Hindus and Sikhs have suffered their share of hardships: taunts, attacks, desecration of cremation sites, marginalization and poverty. Many possess a bottomless collection of [grim tales](https://twitter.com/vilaindo/status/1405733411101229056).\n\nIn the Taliban’s birthplace, the southern city of Kandahar, their children cannot go to school and locals stone or spit on the men in the streets, who mostly try to hide in the narrow alleys of the mud-brick older quarter of the city.\n\n“We don’t want to stay in Afghanistan,” says 40-year-old Balwant Singh. “The locals tell us ‘you are not from Afghanistan, go back to India’. Sometimes, they throw stones at us, the children. We feel we have to hide.\n\n**Yellow Badges**\n\nAfghanistan’s Islamic rulers, widely condemned for their recent destruction of ancient Buddhist artifacts, have now turned their zeal against the country’s tiny Hindu population. According to the Ministry of Vice and Virtue--an Orwellian name if ever there was one--Hindus must begin wearing a yellow badge on their chests “as a mark of distinction.” And the notion of [Zunnar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zunnar) has similarities to this edict.\n\nFew of their stories, however, are from the five years of fundamentalist Islamic theocracy imposed by the Taliban, **who made Hindus and Sikhs wear yellow badges**, or even the brutal wars of the 1980s and ’90s.\n\nIt is the 11 years since the U.S. invaded Afghanistan that has left the community decimated by emigration and remaining members desperately trying to find a way out.\n\nWith echoes of the mass migration of Iraqi Christians, who faced violence and threats during the Iraq War, Afghan Sikhs and Hindus with the means rushed to find asylum elsewhere as the still-wobbly government in Kabul has struggled to protect one of the few religious minorities left in the country.\n\nThe law to make Hindus wear badges was proposed by Taliban\'s leader Mu Mohammed Omar. The law would also make it mandatory for Hindu women to veil themselves just like Muslim women of Afghanistan. \n\nThe edict provoked a mixed reaction from Hindus at Kabul\'s dilapidated temple yesterday. One man vowed to leave while Inder Singh Majboor, a Sikh and Hindu community leader, thought that there was "no cause for concern".\n\n"This is not something new. We reached an agreement with the authorities two years ago that the Hindus should wear a grey skull hat and a ring," he insisted.\n\n"We absolutely deplore such orders which patently discriminate against minorities," Raminder Singh Jassal, an Indian foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters in New Delhi. "It is further evidence of the backward and unacceptable ideological underpinning of the Taliban."\n\nIn the central Indian city of Bhopal, dozens of protesters from the Hindu fundamentalist group Bajrang Dal marched Tuesday, shouting angry slogans and carrying an effigy of a Taliban soldier with a beard and a green scarf. "Taliban, die!" some chanted.\n\nThe RSS, also condemned the Taliban.\n\nEventually the Taliban dropped the proposal under advice from Pakistan that it [was causing a serious worldwide backlash](https://www.upi.com/Archives/2001/06/27/Taliban-drop-badge-policy-for-Hindus/6568993614400/).\n\n**Places of worship**\n\n“The situation is better for Afghans, but not for us,” said Tarlock Singh Jawaherzada, a Sikh who runs an herbal medicine shop in Kabul and, like most interviewed for this story, wants to leave Afghanistan. “We face discrimination, and we face threats, so life is worse for us.”\n\nKabul’s [Dharamsal guruduwara](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-25/sikhs-killed-in-afghanistan-temple-attack/12090722) now has netting covering the second story windows after they were repeatedly smashed with bricks and rocks. Passers-by often yell “infidel” and other insults.\n\nAfter prayer at the gurudwara as worshipers leave,  knife-wielding robbers often lurk near the temple waiting for adherents to leave nighttime services, according to congregation members — preferring to sleep instead within the temple compound.\n\n**Problems cremating their dead**\n\nIt has been a struggle to find a place in Kabul to burn their dead, the traditional funeral rites for both Sikhs and Hindus.\n\nFor more than a century, they had cremated bodies in the same area on the outskirts of town, but several years ago residents began complaining about the smell. That led to a protracted struggle to find a new place. Each time the city of Kabul would agree to a new spot, municipal officials would accompany Sikh and Hindu representatives to the area and, inevitably, residents would come out to protest, sometimes with threats of violence, Khalsa said. Then the municipal workers would flee.\n\nOne confrontation about two years ago turned violent and a Sikh was killed. Then, last year, visiting yet another prospective cremation spot, residents again confronted Khalsa’s group.\n\nOnly around 500 Hindus remain in Afghanistan, compared with the 2,000-strong Sikh minority. Most Hindus left in the mid- 90s, before the Taliban arrived. Most of those remaining live in Kabul.

Most are uneducated and work as manual laborers for various upper castes and/or land-owners. Some, however, have managed to become educated and work middle-class jobs in cities. Madigas benefit from reservation, but Malas in recent years have managed to dominate reservation in Andhra Pradesh/Telangana, thus angering the Madigas.\n&gt; Madigas are nice fellows to talk to, *despite* their humble origins. They have been discriminated for thousands of years by upper castes, so **they have unfortunately internalized a sense of oppression**, similar to how Blacks in America internalized a sense of low self worth in the Jim Crow days. Madigas may not be educated (in general), but **they are very hard workers and are good people**.\n&gt; I am a Reddy and I always try to treat our Madiga laborers well whenever I see them. I give them extra 200 rupees if they worked hard one day, and encourage them to send their kids to school. They really have suffered and it's not fair that their ancestors were treated so poorly for so long. Hopefully the next generation of Madigas becomes educated and uplifts themselves.\n&gt; \n&gt; Eg:\n&gt; \n&gt; I hired someone to clean my dung, and they were a Madiga.  \n&gt; We are Reddies have some manual laborers on our lands, who happen to be Madiga.  \n\n\n And lastly the kicker:\n&gt; \n&gt; **Some local Madiga was trying to enter my village without even taking a bath, so I told him to please take a bath before he enters my village.**"<br />Author: 'Dr_Woolgatherer'  id: 'o30qko'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/o30qko/urban_dictionary_definition_of_madiga_dalit_by_a/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Limbo or Loops'<br />Body: "It has been a few days that I have been fundraising for the medical treatment of a rare covid complication of my mom. My family had been blessed to have found a hundred-odd well-wisher on our side too. \n\nMy mom had always been a selfless spiritual person who loved to give away whatever little she had. Her full-time job was to take care of our family and to provide for every single wish of ours. Even when she was partly sick, she would go beyond her physical capacities to cook meals and feed the hungry or needy. It seemed her actions, have to some extent, been reciprocated with your blessings.\n\nBut, despite our efforts to provide the right medical care, and her rock-solid perseverance, she was untimely taken away from us. My mom succumbed to post Covid complications and finally left us from the ventilator room. She had suffered multiple arrests and had been fighting for life for over a month.\n\nThis crisis has taught me so many things; it's growing like a gaping hole- a place to consume all the darkness. The costs of medical treatments have been totally beyond our reach. Before we could get halfway through the ordeal, our money started depleting at a faster rate than the recovery. Before she could get discharged from her treatment, we had spent more than 60% of all our savings. Once, she was discharged, we were only hoping all this is worth bigger. \n\nBut, it soon turned out to be a nightmare- a cat and mouse game of getting the oxygen, finding the right dosage, procuring equipment, and all the things that could possibly help her battle the monster at home. And yet, the situation got worse and we had to take her to another hospital.\n\nFrom Remdesivirs to steroids, blood, and plasma the list had so many to shop and arrange for, we did not even have time to process her pains and suffering in between. We borrowed from contacts and then called for help on the internet and started getting support at a very slow pace. The lack of a social media influence and the reeking embarrassment of asking for financial help had been devastating to the core for each one of us. It is a different type of helplessness. After years of back cracking hard labor and providing for the family, nobody thought that we would be met with such horrible circumstances. \n\nOur loss had been unbearable; we are yet to revive the courage to fight another crisis in the family. We have recently lost our aunt and grandmother in the family too. The eerie numbness has set in deep for us to really shake off and restart. \n\nTruly, we are far away from reaching the goal. While we try in our own means to bounce back, we are also spreading the word for this cause. Our social shares can only reach so much. We are hoping to reach a large number of contributors to help us through this. \n\nConsider supporting us, please check the link for all the medical details, verify, and then contribute. If you cannot afford to pay, please use your social media influence and amplify our call, if you have time and power. One share on your groups or subreddits will help us a lot. You and your followers may be of help. If you have any queries, please put them in the chatbox.\n\n[https://www.ketto.org/fundraiser/my-mother-is-suffering-from-corona-virus-we-need-your-help-to-provide-for-her-treatment-420003](https://www.ketto.org/fundraiser/my-mother-is-suffering-from-corona-virus-we-need-your-help-to-provide-for-her-treatment-420003)\n\nThanks for reading, I wish you and your family, all the best of health.

      <li>Title::: "India's Middle East Policy : Relation with Egypt , Saudi Arabia and the 1965 War"<br />Body: "I'm reading this paper [Modi looks West? Assessing change and continuity in India’s Middle East policy since 2014](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1057/s41311-021-00314-3?sharing_token=BQgwJdfVy7rad1N5p1Gg8FxOt48VBPO10Uv7D6sAgHtGmUHwDWIgBU6DQOahNGFEHl0IOb2_NIHSlUbGhpUBjzAbZwRUoXzvuF2NAs-VyalsNVMHiboa5C3RXq8IeaY71kDMxWxEUM360eNATzr6owa4VOjrzvDBfr_uv4JdTGs%3D) and decided to summarise bits of the history for easing reading and discussion with the community and especially those users who love geopol!\n\nIf you look at the for instance the last five years, India has managed to closely cooperate with the Gulf states on issues of transnational terrorism. This brought India closer to many gulf countries on economical levels and thereby forcing a shift of their earlier Islamic Brotherhood relations with esp Pakistan to a more rational approach in terms of economical value\n\n# Bilateral Agreements of Modi Govt\n\nLot of visits  to the Gulf countries and the bilateral agreements with Israel, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, Modi signalled his willingness to break with India’s traditional cautious and quiet diplomacy in the region, which had long been considered as necessary to preserve India’s diverse economic, energy, and societal interests in the Middle East.\n\nFrom its independence in 1947 to the Suez Canal crisis of 1956, India initially pursued a policy of open engagement of all actors in the region, including Egypt, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. \n\n# U.S.-sponsored Baghdad pact\n\nIn the 1950s, Nehru and India were perceived as an important extra-regional actor involved in the settlement of regional issues like the Suez crisis and the Lebanon crisis of 1958 (Nayudu 2018). However, India’s approach changed after the Suez crisis when it opted for a less interventionist strategy towards the region (Blarel 2015, 124–132). Because of its limited power projection capabilities, India decided to defer to allies, such as Gamal Abdel Nasser’s Egypt, to have an influence on regional events.\n\n This alignment strategy was also a reaction to the emergence of the U.S.-sponsored Baghdad pact, an alliance system that directly favoured India’s rival, Pakistan, and alienated India from other Middle Eastern states such as Iran and Jordan.  Egypt was also instrumental in limiting efforts from Pakistan to isolate India either through Pan-Islamic solidarity or through the Baghdad Pact. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**India changed its pro Egypt approach due to dependence on oil and energy with the other Gulf states**\n\nIndia’s Cairo-centred policy also came under fire when it became clear that diplomatic support for Egypt directly alienated it from Saudi Arabia and Jordan which, in the meantime, furthered its relations with Pakistan.\n\n#  India’s pro-Egypt bias also led the Indira Gandhi government to unconditionally support Nasser’s military adventurism against Israel in 1967\n\nWe supported Egypt despite it’s lukewarm support in the 1965 war with Pakistan which escalated to a military confrontation with Israel.\n\n India’s uncritical pro-Nasser policy led to the alienation of other Arab leaders like King Hussein of Jordan and King Saud of Saudi Arabia who did not agree with Nasser’s initiatives. Egypt’s military defeat accelerated the decline of Cairo’s prominent status in the Pan-Arab world. \n\nDuring the 1971 war between India and Pakistan, most Arab states again sided with Islamabad, notably judging that the Bengali struggle in East Pakistan was an internal Pakistani matter. Consequently, to attempt to dilute Arab support of Pakistan, but also to meet its growing energy needs, India increasingly developed political links with Iraq and the Gulf States.\n\n# 1965 Indo-Pak War\n\nDuring the IndiaPakistan conflict of April 1965, Pakistan was for instance able to mobilize through this alliance network an overwhelming majority of Arab states on its side. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Barring Egypt, no Arab state in the Middle East seemed prepared to support India’s position.\n\n During the conflict, Jordan and Saudi Arabia even gave direct monetary assistance to Pakistan . While not directly supportive of India, Nasser’s Egypt stayed neutral and helped tone down a pro-Pakistan resolution voted at the Arab Summit of September 1965 in Casablanca\n\nIndia’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, believed that India should be direct party to the resolution of regional disputes to preserve its influence and interests. As a consequence, India was directly involved in the international negotiations leading to the settlement of crises in Palestine, Lebanon, and Suez in the late 1940s and 1950s (Mudiam 1994). \n\n# Today Saudi Arabia is India's fourth largest trade partner\n\n After China, the USA and UAE and a major source of energy as **India** imports around 18% of its crude oil requirement and 30 % of its LPG requirement from the Kingdom. In FY 2019-20, bilateral **trade** was valued at US $33.09 billion. \n\nAnd if you compare their trade with Pakistan its at a mere US$ 3.5 billion \n\nIndia is Jordan's 4th largest  trade partner after Iraq, Saudi Arabia and China. Trade between India  and Jordan is governed by a 1976 bilateral agreement. Bilateral trade  between the two countries totaled US$2.228 billion in 2014–15. And if you compare that with Pakistan it was  at $53.837 million as of 2006. Still a very very low number.\n\nSo you could see from what the economic ties were in the 60s to now, how India has leaped ahead in making sure that economically the gulf countries have a far more dependence on us and we are a large customer to them as well.\n\n# 1970 - India's relation United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iran\n\nTo have a steady supply of oil needs for its  development India warmed up to Iran and UAE. \n\nThe migration of Indian workers moved  to the Gulf states which needed manpower following the oil boom, and  sent back hard currency remittances to India \n\nThe oil embargo of 1973 further  cemented relations with the Gulf states as New Delhi negotiated  bilateral agreements with Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and  Kuwait, to have guaranteed stable prices over a fixed time period and to  ensure a steady flow of oil.\n\nInitially, successive India  governments relied on Egypt to indirectly influence regional politics to  preserve India’s trade and economic interests. However, this policy of  alignment with one regional player showed its limits in the late 1960s  when the distribution of power and influence in the region moved towards  to the oil-rich states. Accordingly, India no longer exclusively  deferred to Cairo’s judgment on Middle Eastern affairs but realigned  itself by developing ties with other regional players like Iraq until  the late 1980s. \n\nToday UAE is India's second largest  export destination after US with an amount of over US$  30 billion for the year 2018-19. For UAE, India was the second largest  trading partner during 2018 with US$ 36 billion (non-oil trade).  While Pakistan maintains a good relation with UAE and has a trade of US$8.19 billion in the year 2019. \n\nTo summarize, we could see how India economical grew to pull in the pro Islamic muslim brotherhood countries towards itself via trade.\n\nIndia today is large trading partner and influencer in the middle east region\n\n***In the next post , I will discuss how India fared in 1990s, hope you enjoyed this read***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Source:***\n\n[***https://www.jstor.org/stable/20671369***](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20671369)\n\n[***Modi looks West?

Why does it put some people on edge so much? \n\nSame with relatives. Ok, they are nowhere in your life, randomly pop up now and then and ask most personal, intrusive questions. Fine, either tell them it\'s none of their business or just smile and tolerate them for few hours as favour to your parents. They\'ll go away anyway. Why do people complain SO much about this?

Always worried that their mother will "bring up the marriage topic". If someone is nagging you, you tell them to stop, and that\'s it. If they continue, ignore. \n\nI see vicious cycle also. You are so fearing a conversation on THE TOPIC (be it education or career or marriage) that you escalate random conversations also into a big fight and confrontation.

I've yet to come across a State Chief minister who doesn't waste public money on social welfare programs targeting female.   \n  \nEven myths like **economic prosperity is based on women empowerment and education**    have been debunked, with states like Kerala and Bengal clear examples. But, they're still being propagated by them, to justify public money spending\n\nRecently Prashant Kishore said [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oh-uraXcRcQ),  \n`Polarization doesn't work on more than 50% population`   \n  \nI suggest, it possible due to difference in thinking pattern of sexes. As economic, communal, historical, linguistic, cultural and regional backgrounds are nearly same of a community in an electoral constituency.  \n  \n`Destruction of Patriarchy starts with their your group first`\n\nWell, from my experience from active participation in college elections. I've noticed  that too, it's difficult to gain female votes based on issues like castes, and region. They're more concerned for female as-a-group, rather than their ancestral group. They even despise it.  \n  \nIt could be due their general feeling of being unequally treated in families. So, they  don't care whether their ancestral group comes in power or not.\n  \n   \n### General unawareness about Family Laws\nWe must admit from recent misled protests against laws like Citizenship Amendment, Agriculture and Labor, Good &amp; Services Tax. It's clear, we as society easily manipulated and subverted in interpretation of laws.\n\nEven, [Hindu Marriage Act, 1955](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_Marriage_Act_(1955)) was passed by Nehru and Ambedkar deviously.

But the other hand no one talks about unfair laws present in our legal system disenfranchising men particularity.\n\n[Here](https://www.scoopwhoop.com/inothernews/gender-biased-laws-in-india/), some of unfair laws no one is talking about, by  [ScoopWhoop](https://www.scoopwhoop.com/). \n\nThere's hope as well [Indian Men's Right Movement](https://menrightsindia.net/), it doing a good job against legal terrorism by family courts in India. \n\n\n## What is Mainstream Outlets doing?\nAs you can, see most of the articles, are from non-mainstream outlets.

      <li>Title::: 'Just wanna say a short message regarding the media, social media and Reddit'<br />Body: 'Hey all, this is just a short discussion I wanna do. It\'s regarding racism on the Internet and coping with it.\n\nOk so, we all know about how Reddit is, the racism, the idiots calling fascist and whatnot. Well I wanna say that **their opinions DO NOT matter**. It is also well known that social media\'s effects have been a bad influence on the human race, bringing us closer and further apart.\n\nLook, from my analysis, Reddit consists of some of the worst people. The alt-right, alt-left, incels, teenagers who dont know anything, and arrogant people. Many blatantly love to circle-jerk and say such stuff but in reality, can\'t do much. If you go on r/averageredditor, it gives a good idea. Like I remember there was a comment calling someone a dad an asshole for not buying his daughter a dildo. It had several thousand upvotes. This isn\'t everyone of course but I would say majority on Reddit is what I said. Oh and then there\'s those who do whatever for karma because they get dopamine hits from upvotes. Same can be applied to 4chan where they are just being dumb. Hell check this [link](https://www.google.com/search?q=4chan+pol+meetup&amp;client=firefox-b-d&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi10dC-nJjxAhUF6XMBHerGAtMQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=711), THESE are the people being racist.\n\nIn regard to Reddit, if you take the popular opinions on this site, you would think that people in general have the popular opinions in real life. Like with hating america, EU good, **everyone** wants progressive, **everyone** hates right-wing leaders, hating on capitalism and wanting socialism. Now imagine you spend whole day on Reddit, seeing the negative comments from people doing the same as you. You have that notion in your head that everyone is racist. You step outside, go to a public place, expecting to get abused and such. Nothing happens (mostly depending where you are), people going on with their daily lives. This is a prime example that not everyone uses Reddit. Only about 300 million people use it. This is small when you consider how many people have access to the Internet.\n\n"Too many people have opinions on things they know nothing about. And the more ignorant they are, the more opinions they have." This can easily be applied to social media. We get all the "mudi fascist" and whatnot, people not knowing about infra projects as well. The media doesn\'t help with this, ill discuss more about them later.\n\nNow, I said redditor\'s opinions don\'t matter. I would say the opinion\'s of other governments and entrepreneurs should be valued. So everyone knows how Pakistani government pays people to spread propaganda, especially on Reddit. There\'s the sub r/NoahGetTheBoat which is literally filled with bad news of India or how r/worldnews has Pakistani moderators who have deleted rape news for other countries minus India. Keep this in mind for the next paragraph.\n\nNow with how the propaganda, negative comments from Redditors are on this site or social media. India yet has good relations with countries like the US, Russia, Japan and Israel to name a few. Hell, now France is full on wanting good relations with India, offering [defence technology transfer](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/committed-to-deftech-transfer-under-make-in-india-lenain/articleshow/78303896.cms?from=mdr). Then now Australia highly wants to export mining goods to India. Hell, there have been comments saying India is doing bad stuff to muslims and how Mudi hindu fascist. Well yet in Saudi Arabia, the country that is full on an Islamic Absolute Monarchy and where Islam originated, had given modi [the highest civilian honour award](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/modi-conferred-highest-saudi-civilian-honour/story-bwZOeS1MJFw7QigfOEeFnI.html) and how FDI is high from that country. Even the UAE is investing massively into India and with good relations.\n\nNow overall, media doesn\'t help. You might have seen one of my comments about the media but I will say it again. So the media is a business, they get money from advertisement revenue, thats why they block ad-blockers. Negative news is highly more known to get more recognition. Its like people would rather read about an actor abusing his wife rather than donating a billion dollars to charity.\n\nJust overall, take it easy. DO NOT bother with arguing with people on these platforms. Learn something then establish your opinion. People nowadays will love to change it.'<br />Author: 'Plebman2511'  id: 'o06riw'<br />Score:70<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/o06riw/just_wanna_say_a_short_message_regarding_the/</li>

Padmanabhaswamy temple kept $3 trillion worth of treasures safe from Islamists, British and Communists by executing the greatest Indic heist in history of mankind.'<br />Body: '##A communist attempt by Pinaryi Vijayan government to loot Padmanabhaswamy temple to fill their party coffers -\n\nIn 2009, a rat by the name of T P Sunderrajan filed a PIL in the district court of Tiruvananthapuram, challenging the authority of the Travancore royal family heir over the Padmanabhaswamy temple and its property. \n\n\nSunderrajan was a man propped by the CPI-M to ascertain as to how much wealth the temple owned. Back then, very few people knew the extent of opulence of the temple. But some rumour must have escaped because it got the hinduphobic CPI-M very interested in temple finances of Padmanabhaswamy.\n\n\nIn January 2011, the Kerala High Court passed an order that the temple and its management be given to the state government run by communists. \n\n\nCome May 2011, Marthanda Varma, the royal heir, challenged the verdict in the supreme court which stayed the order. But the court also ordered the inventory of all the temple assets, especially the one in the underground vaults. \n\n\n##Thus came out the extent of wealth the temple held in its vaults -\n\nThousands upon thousands of gold coins, jewels and precious stones the size of people\'s thumbs. A life size moorti of Vishnu cast out of pure gold and embedded with diamonds and rubies and emeralds.\n\n\nThere are french colonial era gold coins with Napoleon Bonaparte\'s face on them. There also hundreds of pots of gold coins from the Roman and Greek empires dating back from before the birth of Christ.\n\n\nThe conservative estimate of this treasure is around $2-3 trillion, without even taking into account the unopened vaults and approximately 3 TONNES of gold dust lying around the vaults.\n\n\nHow did Sunderrajan know such a treasure is buried under the temple?\n\n\n***He\'s a former Assistant Director of Intelligence Bureau and a close confidant of Indira Gandhi and a lifelong Congress loyalist.***\n\n\nIt was in 2020 that finally the Supreme Court passed the order that the temple management belonged to the Travancore royal family and not the state government putting an end to Vijayan\'s dream of looting Bhagwan Vishnu\'s assets.\n\n\n##How Hindu kings sent their wealth to Bhagwan Padmanabhaswamy for safekeeping -\n\nThere are many speculations as to why the temple is so rich. One of the expert opinions is that all the Hindu wealth from across Bharat was relocated to Tiruvanathapuram for safekeeping. This included northern kingdoms too, since the southern kingdoms as south as Kerala did not interact with the Greeks.\n\n\nIt is the accumulated wealth of the Chelas, Pandyas, the Ay Kingdom and finally the Travancore Kingdom. But we can assume that wealth from erstwhile Northern kingdoms also found way here in the form of dana by visiting Hindu kings on a pilgrimage to pay obecience to Padmanabhaswamy.\n\n\n##The clandestine way the royal families kept the treasure a secret by way of renovations -\n\nHow does one construct a complete maze of vaults underground without people ever knowing?\n\n\nThe answer lies in deliberate sabotage and renovations. \n\n\nThe earliest record of renovations is recorded in 1050 AD when a Venad king ordered renovation by removing the moorti of Padmanabhaswamy.\n\n\nAnother extensive renovation was performed in 1461 AD and the moorti was reinstalled.\n\n\nThese "renovations" are nothing but careful and planned construction of the underground vaults and their expansion. \n\n\nIn 1689, the temple was almost destroyed in a fire. Only the moorti of Vishnu survived.\n\n\nIn 1729, Thirunal Marthanda Varma, finally began rebuilding in earnest. The construction ended in 1733.\n\n\nI am speculating that it is here that all the vaults are constructed and deemed completed. Because right after this Thirunal Marthanda Varma announced himself as the servant of Vishnu or Padmanabha dasa, dedicating all his wealth to Vishnu.\n\n\nIn hindsight Marthanda is a visionary because the Dutch invasions and Islamic trouble started in 1735, a mere two years after the temple was completed.\n\n\nBut the fundamental question is that how did the temple keep the knowledge of such a treasure secret from the British and Islamist conquerors, especially the Mysore Sultanate?\n\n\n\n##The genius strategy to fool the British in 1848 -\n\nTraditionally Travancore kings participated in the ceremony of mahadanams (great charity). \n\n\nIn this ceremony the king\'s would give gold and wealth to the brahmins on their kingdom. Each brahmin would get at least 80 grams of gold as charity. They did this every year, and gave away gold to thousands of brahmins. \n\n\n***But in the account books they shared with the British, they showed depleting finances.***\n\n\nThis "grave financial condition" concerned the Governor general of India and he warned the king Uttaran Tirunal in 1848 that if he continued doing this charity, his kingdom would be acceded to Madras presidency.\n\n\nThe king happily stopped the mahadanam ceremony to the happiness of the British who were finally satisfied that the kingdom would not bankrupt itself.\n\n\n***Thus by smart accounting and charity, the king easily made idiots of the British and kept them in the dark about the treasure.***\n\n\n\n\n##Trouncing Tipu Sultan in battlefield and keeping the East India Company away with diplomacy in 1789 -\n\nThe first real threat by way of force after Travancore was formed came in the form of Tipu Sultan.\n\n\nKarthika Thirunal Rama Varma was the son of Marthanda Varma, the king who established the Travancore royal family and declared the family as Padmanabhaswamy dasas(servants of Vishnu).\n\n\nHe made sure to keep the British calm by diplomacy, recognising that he could not have a war on two fronts with such a treasure under his safekeep.\n\n\nWhen Tipu Sultan attacked with his son, Karthika Varma defeated him, and routed his Islamic ego.\n\n\nThe defeat was a significant one because there were thousands of Hindu refugees who had migrated to Tiruvanathapuram to escape the Islamic atrocities by Tipu Sultan.\n\n\nTipu had demanded that the refugees be returned to him, but Varma refused and went to war for the Hindu refugees and won this ending any possibility of Islamic attack and upholding Hindu dharma.\n\n\nThus by keeping people in the dark, the Travancore royal family and their descendants have kept the treasure away from malicious agents and agencies.\n\n\nBut this will not end here. The Communists and the Imperialist Congress forces want the temple treasure to be taken out and kept in a museum. Many voices also want to use the treasure to erase the debt by allowing government control over it. We know how much of it will be left when the Commies will go through it, looting god knows how much.\n\n\nThe royal family is right - the treasure belongs to Bhawan Padmanabhaswamy and Him only. They are just the caretakers. And what marvelous caretakers to protect Bhagwan\'s treasure for over 3 millennia! No such feat of secrecy has been accomplished ever in the history of mankind. To know what would have happened to the treasure just look at the Mayan, Aztec and Egyptian treasures.\n\n\nBut the wolves are circling even now. This temple is a classic case why we need to make provisions to free temples from ever coming under government control.\n\n\nWe need to make sure that it remains Bhagwan\'s forever.\n\n\n***Aum Padmanabhaya Namah!***\n\n\n\nPS. -\n\nA little about the Travancore royal family tradition of Muramakkathayam or the matrilineal succession -\n\n\nIn the Travancore royal family, the women has more power than the men. The king was not the son of the previous king. To be the king he had to be born to the sister of the king. Thus the nephew would inherit the title of king. \n\nIf the king would beget only sons, a girl child would be adopted and then a son, who is not of king\'s blood would become the successor.\n\nShow this to the people who attack Hinduism for being patriarchal. The richest religious institution in the WHOLE WORLD was and still is managed by the authority of women. And this is not the sole example either. There are many such. I will compile them in another post.

For more details, You can listen to Pabitra Mohan Roy\'s Son.  P. B. Roy was INA\'s Secret Service Head and in 60\'s he came to know about this Monk. At first, he didn\'t believe Him but later he used to go regularly and took notes of many discussions. And in the meantime, P. B. Roy also took his son with Him to Bhagwanji.  He shared many other interesting conversations which he witnessed on  Youtube, which you can check. So, here are some quotes of Bhagwanji :\n\n1. I  have undergone a complete Metamorphosis. The biggest asset of my life is sacrifice. I am not a great man, so I do not need a biography.\n\n2. To understand a man you have to understand the bedrock on which he stands and his works. My most and only beloved mother was a direct initiated disciple of Ramakrishna Paramhamsa Deva. My Governor, first tutor guardian gave me a missionary sacrificing zeal and all fighting, all overcoming stamina...I have never played false with myself.\n\n3. If anybody ascribes that he is an authority on me, I would call him a darned fool. Know yourself first then try to know others.\n\n4. If Bengal hopes that she will get back "him" – that is a mistake. "He" is dead, Bengal has killed "him".\n\n5. I  am just a Will-o\'-the-wisp, It is born, does it work, runs around,  stays still for a while, vanishes from one place and then, shows up at another place. It manifests itself but cannot be caught. I am just not here. I have no existence.\n\n6. Very strange are you and your government that they constitute ‘loaded dice commissions’ over and again just to know, whether he is dead or not! You all are the reason behind this. Populus Vult Decipi – You All People  Wish To Be Fooled.\n\n7. My real identity is that I am a dust particle of Bengal. My false identity is Frankenstein, which I neither did want nor deserved. You have raised this Frankenstein and now feelers are being sent to him. It is too late.\n\n8. Indian politics. Ugh. It stinks. Statesmen are a rarity everywhere. But in India, there is no Statesman.\n\n9. It is God\'s truth and takes it from the horse\'s mouth, Communism shall die at the place of its birth. Even Gods have not the power to nullify these solemn words. But you must pay the price.\n\n10. In the inviolable and most divine name of mother Jagadamba Durga, Bhabani,  Chandi – The Bengal – India shall rise again in her full glory. Corrupt people on my motherland\'s soil will be completely eliminated gradually. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Artistic image of Bhagwanji as described by people who had luck to see Him directly as He always speak from behind a Parda](http://preview.redd.it/n5qr8jbxy1571.png?width=564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94ee6927f2ceb5006780e70765943d965b186458)'<br />Author: 'KS_Gaming193'  id: 'nyyyq7'<br />Score:21<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nyyyq7/some_of_the_quotes_from_the_letters_of_gumnami/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The IAS monopoly is crumbling...'<br />Body: "Of late, the central govt is more interested in recruiting people from backgrounds other than IAS for diversification.  The power and command which the IAS wielded is declining., although we may not notice it as it's silent, it's actually happening. The IAS's dominance is slowly fading and it must CONTINUE to fade.

From yesterday\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The 'Steel Frame': Why the top political establishment doesn’t seem to be too unhappy about the declining clout of IAS lobby](https://outline.com/yXfPb4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Last month, the Government of India appointed 20 joint secretaries (JS) in various ministries, in which the majority — **12 to be precise — belonged to services other than the elite Indian Administrative Service (**[**IAS**](https://m.economictimes.com/topic/IAS)**).**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The new entrants included three officers from the income-tax department, three from the railways, two from the central secretariat service and one each from postal, audit and accounts, civil accounts and ordnance factories services, all considered rank and file in the hierarchy of Indian civil services.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; This is not a new trend. But the pattern has become so consistent\n\n#  since 2017-18 that IAS officers holding critical JS rank have now become a minority in almost all central government offices.\n\n# \n\n&gt; According to data available with the department of personnel and training (DoPT), IAS officers in the rank of a GoI joint [secretary](https://m.economictimes.com/topic/Secretary) **are only one -third, a dramatic fall from five years ago when almost all posts of JS and above were unofficially reserved for the prestigious cadre.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; A JS in GoI is a senior officer with a mandatory experience of 16 years, a post deemed important because of the power and independence it wields. Plus, it is a stepping stone to the upper echelons of civil services: additional secretary and secretary.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; “IAS is no longer a premier service,” says a serving additional chief secretary-ranked IAS officer, requesting anonymity. “Other services have lobbied far too well.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Seventh Central Pay Commission has damaged us a lot, both in terms of pay and seniority,” he adds, referring to its refusal to accept the IAS’ demand for faster promotion. The outcome is clear. The “IAS lobby” is on the wane, losing its swagger and power, and the political establishment at the Centre does not seem to be unhappy about it.** Small wonder that when Alapan Bandyopadhyay, a 1987 batch IAS officer and the then chief secretary of West Bengal, was in the dock recently for failing to attend PM Narendra Modi’s review meeting regarding Cyclone Yaas, **none of his comrades in the service, not even his batchmates, made any backroom bid to rescue him, say officials in the know.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# “I have always held the view that public administration is a specialised skill and that anyone picked up from outside the system cannot make any signifcant impact”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n\\- KM CHANDRASEKHAR, *FORMER CABINET SECRETARY*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMuch more is mentioned in the article on how the IAS is collapsing !! It still has some power left but that's fading away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, a note on Bandyopadhyay from the article..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Bandyopadhyay has been served a notice under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and if the case is doggedly pursued and the officer’s explanation not found satisfactory**, he could end up in jail for a year, a harsh punishment for any officer of such seniority.**"<br />Author: 'itisverynice'  id: 'nyut8e'<br />Score:89<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nyut8e/the_ias_monopoly_is_crumbling/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Here's how Plastic Surgery spread worldwide from India vis Britain."<br />Body: ' In 1794 AD, The Third Mysore war took place between Tipu Sultan and the Britishers. The Mysore soldiers captured a truck that was carrying food for the British army. A simple Marathi named Kosaji was the one who drove this truck. Tipu Sultan ordered to cut off his nose. Kosaji with his nose cut was released after the end of the war.\n\nA British doctor came forward to treat him. But Kosaji did not allow that doctor to treat him and said to take him to a traditional physician named Kumar. The Britishers scolded him for choosing the local remedy instead of modern medicine. \n\nHe said, "Kumar will fix my cut nose again.” Everyone started laughing. But they agreed to his request and took him to Kumar. The local physician, Kumar, was doing a brick kiln business. He peeled some skin from Kosaji\'s forehead and stitched it with the nose. The nose grew back. The skin from the forehead also grew back. \n\nThe British doctor, who saw this "miracle", drew a painting of the miraculous incident and sent it to Britain. On seeing the message, Joseph Constantine Carpue, an English doctor, came from London and met  Kumar. He stayed for several years and returned back after learning this surgery therapy. When he went to London, he performed the world\'s first "plastic surgery" in 1816. It was then known as a Carpue operation.\n\nHow did Dr Kumar know plastic surgery?\n\nAn ancient Indian physician, named Sushrutha, wrote about plastic surgery around 2500 years ago. The book, Sushruta Samhita, still contains the details of the surgery. Though it is called plastic surgery, no plastic was involved in this surgery.\n\nThose who practised this surgery for generations were doing simple brick kiln business. \n\nPicture of  Kosaji from British museum ---&gt;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k28f3ps2fz471.jpg?width=304&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=273205d648184633a5e546584808408eda361da0'<br />Author: 'KS_Gaming193'  id: 'nyqve8'<br />Score:96<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nyqve8/heres_how_plastic_surgery_spread_worldwide_from/</li>

Elements on social media misused the news for political propaganda. Due to the [f](https://twitter.com/search?q=saswati%20jana&amp;src=typed_query)alse politicization given to the crime, it was marked as "fake news", and never spread. **People are denying that the horrible crime even took place**, due to the lack of coverage. Why else would the brutal rape and murder of an innocent, young girl in her own home not make the national and even international news? This is a crime NOT common at all.\n\nShe and her cousin\'s family wants the perpetrators to be tried in court and be held accountable for this heinous crime. Unfortunately, the crime has been completely swept under the rug by the media and hardly reported on. Without national and international pressure, justice in the country moves very slowly. They have been told that in order to get justice we have to be vocal, gather public support, and get this news to the mainstream media. Her story should not be forgotten. \n\neShe, a women\'s magazine, recently interviewed with her cousin:\xa0[https://eshe.in/2021/06/06/jamna-midnapore-west-bengal-student-rape-murder-case/](https://eshe.in/2021/06/06/jamna-midnapore-west-bengal-student-rape-murder-case/)\xa0 I encourage you all to read it. It goes into detail about how the crime was planned, calculated, and likely executed out before. It also emphasizes that there was *no political angle.* \n\nI hope the members here, as citizens of India, can help bring awareness to the issue. There is a large fear of justice not being served as well as the culprits committing this crime again. \n\nWe are using #JusticeForSaswati on social media to increase awareness and media coverage. Her cousin\'s family in the US created a website for her since her family in India lacks a lot of resources. This way we can give her a voice as the perpetrators deprived her of that:\xa0[http://justiceforsaswati.org/](http://justiceforsaswati.org/). There is a link to the petition there.

It also seems to be a bigger problem amongst women than men. \n\nThis may not come as a surprise to most people because of the preferential treatment that lighter-skinned people get, not just in India but most of the developing world. The problem is, most of India is either dusky or very dark, unlike the actors and models that are advertised. So now we have in our hands well over half the population lacking in self-confidence because of how they look. This is a big problem, because when they see some others as superior, they then try to please these others by doing what's told instead of what they think is right. Lack of self-confidence in this case causes lack of independent thought. \n\nSo how can this be fixed? I believe there's no other way, but to constantly advertize darker-skinned individuals as being desirable, in movies, serials, TV ads, billboards, etc. Shaming companies like Fair &amp; Lovely or banning certain practices doesn't work because it makes dark-skinned people look angry, jealous and undesirable."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'nxrtsb'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nxrtsb/darkerskinned_indians_lack_confidence_in_social/</li>

      <li>Title::: "My critique of The Carvaka Podcast's Warhorse Evolution, Economics and Tactics, focusing on the discussion around tactics and military history"<br />Body: 'I\'ll make it clear at the very beginning, my interest in this video is not the discussion around economics or geography and archaeology, which I might largely agree on with Abhijit Iyer Mitra\'s analysis, except perhaps a few points regarding economics. My analysis and breakdown here is of the section of the podcast which discusses tactics, and why and how this discussion presents an incorrect view of warfare in the ancient period. [Here\'s a link to this video](https://youtu.be/xSsSjwjwcAM) \n\n\nNow I request that you skip to 1:17:45 since this is roughly where the discussion on tactics begins. My attempt will be to quote lines from Mr. Abhijit Iyer Mitra, and what will follow is a quote by quote breakdown of the claims he makes and critique of his theories and analysis. \n\n\n**FROM 1:17:48  TO  1:24:00**\n\n\n&gt; I\'ve shown you the two formations that were the most important of the time. The left is the Roman "Tortuga" and on the right is the Macedonian phalanx\n\n\nHere Mr.Mitra refers to an image of a modern reenactment of the Roman testuedo or turtle formation as the Roman "Tortuga" . Now, in all fairness he does correct himself later on in the video, although in the interest of chronology I\'ve pointed out this mistake here. And on the right of this image is a screenshot from the Kings and Generals series on Alexander\'s Army featuring the Macedonian phalanx. \n\n\nNext is the claim that these were the two most important formations of the time. Keep in mind that the Macedonian phalanx was employed by Phillip II and Alexander and later on by his Diadochi between 359 BCE to roughly 219 BCE after which the employment of such formations was restricted to the Greek states during the Hellenistic period, meanwhile the dominant form of infantry organisation which when came into contact with the phalanx, defeated it was the Roman Legion. After the end of the Hellenistic Period , the Roman Empire dominated much of the Mediterranean and Western Europe. So one wonders, why Mr. Mitra lumps the two in the same time period or why he doesn\'t say that the Roman legion was the most important infantry formation of the "time period". \n\n\nAlso, what Mr.Mitra ignores is the fact that these formations and tactics were restricted largely to the cultures or states that created them. In the East, there were no formations in this time period which resembled the Macedonian phalanx specifically or the Roman legion, meanwhile further west, the Gauls and the Spaniards, the Carthaginians and the Libyans or the Numidians, didn\'t use such formations or tactics either. Mr. Mitra is also vague when he refers to "this time period" since one struggles to imagine he could mean all of ancient history as it would ignore the tactics employed by those states and their armies which existed in the Indian subcontinent, in Western Europe, in the Steppe or in the Far East. Therefore, not only is this statement vague, it supposes that such tactics or those derived from such tactics or those similar to such tactics were employed by virtually all armies on the planet. Which I need not say, is wrong.\n\n\n&gt; In the turtle what happens is... It was pure stampede dynamics, you hold the line and two lines keep pushing against each other. The front most soldiers keep getting crushed, just EXACTLY what happens in a stampede...... It was pushing shield to shield. They were being crushed by their compatriots from the back...... If the soldier did not kill you he would be crushed by his compatriots from the back. \n\n\nHere, Mr. Mitra seems to imply that in ancient warfare, generals and soldiers were of the understanding that the most efficient way to kill and defeat and enemy is to run at them full gallop, push against them with your shields while they did the same and to push the man in front of you while the man in the ranks tried to, in the midst of this chaotic scene, jab and poke the man in the front ranks of the enemy with his sword.\n\n\nI cannot stress enough, how far of a departure this is from the contemporary and modern understanding of warfare. The most fundamental element of war, and the most steadfast element of war is man, and man is a being of instinct, of nature, of fear and his most basic instinct is that of self preservation. Therfore, infantry formations, where all other ranks expect the one in the rearmost would be expected to be crushed by their own ranks behind them and by the enemy in front of them would not exist. This is fantasy and nothing more. Human beings weren\'t automatons, they couldn\'t be stuffed against each other and not collapse out of exhaustion, heat or trauma, let alone fight effectively. To any contemporary general, say Caesar or Alexander, such a tactic would not only sound impossible they\'d either laugh at or scorn at the suggestion of such an inhumane employment and treatment of their men.\n\n\nRomans and Greeks alike, understood the principle of morale, of discipline and organisation. The truth is that in battle, no more than the first and second ranks engaged. When two opposing armies, or two opposing infantry formations approached one another the advance would be in accordance with a pace at which the soldiers could maintain cohesion and support of their neighbouring comrades, collective action and support in depth from the men standing behind the front rank soldiers in deep files, gave the men in the front ranks confidence. Once the enemy came closer the front ranks slowed their advance and the men standing behind the front rank in deep files would follow suit, eventually the first ranks came into contact, which the second rank stopped enough paces behind the first so as to allow for the first to be able to fence and fight. The job of the second rank was to support the first rank, to check his flanks, to avoid enemy break through or sudden pushes and to replace the soldiers standing before him should the man in the first rank be slain or injured by taking his place and allowing him to be dragged to move to the rear.\n\n\nWhat Mr. Mitra does not seem to understand is this very human nature of war. Of morale, of fear, of organisation and the necessity of discipline. Warfare was never an all out push or melee, but rather a test of nerves, skill and a period of ebbs and flows of combat. The lines of infantry were never straight, but rather curved or had bends depending on where the enemy had gained or lost ground in account of prowess in arms or exhaustion of units that gave ground. Front ranks on each side would engage and at times disengage in period of lulls in violence. The front most rank would be at the centre of the battle, the recipient of all its tensions, vigours, fears and desperation, while the ranks in their rear would await in anxiety, nervousness and restlessnes. By acting as units, by standing in deep files and columns, men were able to, by virtue of organisation and discipline, shake off to a certain extent, that fear and that concern for self preservation. This is why such formations existed. To tame men\'s hearts and to give them a decided advantage over unorganised forces, where men fought as individuals.\n\n\nAs an example, the Gauls did indeed follow this tactic of all out charge, of relentless assault but they didn\'t stand in deep files but rather assaulted the enemy in hopes of shaking them, of causing fear amidst their ranks and overcoming them with physical prowess. The Romans defeated the Guals, not merely because they had better organised troops but by virtue of the advantages such organisation lensed to the Roman soldier. Once the impetus of the Gual\'s charge was gone, the Romna soldier, standing in tenacious resistance would then proceed to fight, each rank engaging in combat, as the one\'s in the front would after a certain time retreat to the back and the one\'s further back would come to the front, therefore, by putting the depth of the files into the centre of the tension, the Roman general ensured that men wouldn\'t stand in the back paralysed and anxious for violence, hence losing morale, but rather would, at appropriate intervals be positioned into the fight, thereby allowing their compatriots to rest and exhausting the enemy, whose disorganised forces would soon lose morale and start retreating.\n\n\nNext Mr. Mitra dwells on the weakness of the testuedo. Of the fact that it\'s rear and sides were exposed (pointing to the picture of a modern reenactment of a Roman unit using shields for some purpose). Ofcourse, Mr. Mitra perhaps doesn\'t realise that an actual testuedo was meant to cover the infantry unit from all sides with shields, hence the name. But, without realising the error of his hypothesis, he goes in with his theory on how cavalry works....\n\n\n&gt; Cavalry would come around from the back and shoot arrows from the back. Cavalry with spears would never charge into these soldiers because a horse was worth 20 Romans soldiers, they would jab into gaps at the legs.\n\n\nNow the first and the second claim that cavalry would shoot arrows from the back or the sides and that cavalry would never charge into Roman lines from the front, both can be easily dismissed by pointing to the The Battle of Carrhae fought in 53 BCE. A short summary of the battle should suffice, although I would recommend reading on the battle from any book on Roman military history. Keep in mind this isn\'t what the post is aimed at therefore terminology and explanations will be simplified. \n\n\n\nThe Roman general Crassus deployed his men into a hollow square, each side formed by twelve cohorts, after being informed of an approaching Parthian army. The Parthian commander Surena, had ordered his cataphracts to remove the cloths on them and reveal their shining armour to intimidate the Romans. Next he ordered his horse archers to wheel around the Roman front and surround the square (keep in mind this is a square which means each side has a front and is facing the enemy). Crassus sent his skirmishers to drive the horse archers off, but they were driven back by the latter\'s arrows. Plutarch wrote in his accounts that the Romans were met with a shower of arrows that passed through every kind of cover, hard and soft alike. Other historians state that most wounds inflicted were nonfatal hits to exposed limbs.\n\n\nThe Romans repeatedly advanced towards the Parthians to attempt to engage in close-quarters fighting, but the horse archers were always able to retreat safely and loosed Parthian shots as they withdrew. The legionaries then formed the testudo formation by locking their shields together to present a nearly-impenetrable front to missiles. However, that formation severely restricted their ability in melee combat. The Parthian cataphracts exploited that weakness and repeatedly charged the Roman line, which caused panic and inflicted heavy casualties. When the Romans tried to loosen their formation to repel the cataphracts, the latter rapidly retreated, and the horse archers resumed shooting at the legionaries, who were now more exposed.\n\n\nIn the end, the hopeless Romans were defeated decisively.\n\n\nFinally, Mr. Mitra around 1:22:00 corrects his mistake of calling the Testuedo a Tortuga\n\n\n**FROM 1:36:00 TO 1:48:00**\n\n\nHere Mr. Mitra makes several points and discusses them for a couple minutes each. Now it\'s hard for me to quote him precisely here which is why I\'ll request everyone to refer to the timestamps in the videos for exact quotes if they feel the same to be necessary.\n\n1) At the start Mr. Mitra tackles the issue of why Indians were never able to defeat cavalry and cites an example of the Marathas and the fact that their usage of the cavalry was inefficient, since horses would go bad in a couple or more generations and the Marathas placed emphasis on a caste and status which was accentuated by what people rode on which in this case was horses.\n\n\nNow, here I must critique Mr. Mitra\'s approach to analysing military history. He seems to be focused on the economic and combat aspect. Meaning he analyses, in ways that I personally don\'t agree with, the cost of war and then looks at speicifc tactics and battles and concludes, that since horses required a certain terrain to be bred, since they went bad after a few generations and since the Marathas were defeated at Panipat and ultimately declined and were conquered by the British, that since their campaigns in Bengal and Orissa were so destructive due to the fact that their costs to maintain their mounts was high, that the whole thing was redundant, that the entire practice was ill-conceived and that Indians should have focused on infantry tactics since the ancient era. He also points to caste and a focus on status as factors for the Maratha failures.\n\n\nFirst and foremost, Mr. Mitra seems to ignore the inherent disadvantages that a purely infantry force would have and perhaps, he fails to understand the role that cavalry played outside of battles and direct combat. Let us examine an example to understand the problems with this confined analysis of the importance of cavalry to understand why Indian powers stressed the need to acquire good horses be it from abroad or from regions like Marwar. \n\n\nTwo armies, at the beginning of a campaign, operate on the basis of the intelligence they might have on enemy territory and movements, based off of intelligence such as spies or reconnaissance units. In case of the aggressor, the general might take initiative and move into enemy territory either to force the enemy army which is defending it\'s state to intercept him before he either reaches the capital or an objective of strategic and tactical import, or move in to take a strategically useful and tactically defensive position, therefore taking the strategic initiative and the tactical defensive and using defensive offense in order to force the defender to fight a battle in his own territory on a field of the attacker\'s choosing. Ofcourse, these examples are a representation of the circumstances that led to a number of battles in the Indian subcontinent, such as the Battle of Panipat or the Battle of Khanwa or the Battle of Tarain, and indeed in real life there\'s a multitude of variations in which these scenarios played out and even entirely different scenarios did take shape too, but in order to limit the parameters of this discussion let\'s try and focus on the above scenarios to gain an understanding of how a surprise attack might come into play. \n\n\nNow, let us try and understand how these armies might have moved. In one of the examples mentioned above, the Battle of Panipat, Babur who was the commander of the Mughal forces made use of his light horse archers that served as excellent vanguard and reconnaissance units to scout ahead and report on the enemy locations and movements. He realised that the flat plains before the small town/village of Panipat, was an excellent location to take a defensive position and utilise his wagon fort and tulughma tactics. In the coming battle of Panipat, he scored a victory by seizing the strategic initiative and taking a tactical defensive. However, such scout formations could not be sent too far ahead of an army\'s main column where the commander and his infantry and artillery train were positioned. Finally was an army\'s rearguard, which was a means of securing the rear and avoiding being trapped in ambushes or surprise attacks in the first place.\n\n\nTherefore, armies didn\'t have pinpoint locations of their enemies before coming fairly close to each other. The reconnaissance abilities of an army played an incredible role in eliminating the fog of war to a certain extent and giving the main column of the army time to prepare for an encounter, and even the reconnaissance itself was limited by the fact that it had to maintain a minimum level of proximity with its main column, in order for intelligence to be conveyed in a fairly efficient and orderly fashion. Hence, a general\'s movements were informed by intelligence gained, his ability to take initiative and his understanding strategy and tactics. \n\n\nCavalry played a crucial role in campaigns, in communications, in intelligence gathering and in executing maneuver warfare and shock or Steppe tactics. It\'s vast and varied utility and flexibility as an arm of the military made good cavalry an invaluable asset. From the very moment a campaign began, to making victories decisive, cavalry was necessary. \n\n\nNext, we should also look at the successes which many Rajput states and indeed the Peshwa Bajirao himself gained owning to superior cavalry tactics. Be it the Battle of Palkhed, be it the Battle of Delhi or Bhopal or Maonda and Mandholi or the campaigns of Rana Sanga and Rana Kumbha. These are all excellent examples of cavalry being used in India effectively. These successes and their outcomes far outweighed the cost of horses and equipment.\n\n\nTo put it into simple terms, medieval and ancient monarchs were constrained and inclined in term aof their recruitment policies. They had the choice to either recruit from existing military labour manpower pools, constituted by those castes and ethnic groups that held a dominant position in society both as a result of previous centuries of military service and as a result of their social and ritual status or recruit from the landless or tenant labour force which would require training and expenditure. Overall, a force which could be raised quickly, required limited or no training and was effective in warfare was preferable over one which would have to be put through the rigours of extensive training and would require great expenditure.\n\n\n\nHere\'s an example of how truly effective cavalry could be even when recruited from specific manpower pools adhering to caste. \n\n\n**BATTLE OF GANGWANA, 1741**\n\n\nThe Battle of Gangwana was a military engagement fought between the armies of the Kingdom of Marwar under Raja Bakht Singh Rathore, and a combined army of the Jaipur Kingdom and the Mughal Empire in 1741 under the overall command of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II Kachhwaha along with 3 Mughal Generals.\n\nJai Singh arrived at Kunchgaon, 11 miles to the east of the Pushkar Lake. He arrayed his guns, artillery pieces, in a long line facing the supposed direction of the arriving Marwar army. His army numbered anywhere between 40,000 to 100,000. The huge discrepancy between quoted numbers of total men present in the Jaipur army was because of the large number of camp followers such as tent keepers, water holders etc. that accompanied Mughal Armies of the period.\n\nBakht Singh, had a mere 1000 Rathore horsemen. Since, no reinforcements would arrive for him. With a force of mere 1000, he surprised the Mughal-Jaipur army, by charging straight towards their camp. This surprise, combined with the high morale of his troops, excellent organisation and discipline would prove fatal to his enemies. \n\nBakht Singh manged to punch through the artillery, hacking and slashing the gunners as he went, him and his horsemen reached the centre of the camp and threw the horde of enemies into absolute chaos, hacking and slashing their way, as if cutting down wild game after a good hunt.\n\nThe cavalry penetration was so deep that the Rathors burst through the rear of the Jaipur army and began to raid the baggage train. Tents and supplies were burned, and Bakht Singh seized Sitaramji, Jai Singh\'s personal family idol. The Rathors galloped from one end to the other causing havoc in the large masses of confused men and horses, the Jaipur army fled in panic, and within 4 hours the Rathors held the field. **Sir Jadunath Sarkar quotes that - "the battle front was like tigers upon a flock of sheep".**\n\nBy now, Bakht Singh had only 70 Rathore men on horses. At this point, Mughal rocket contingents, began firing at the this small contingent of Rathore cavalry. Bakht Singh could not see any enemies on the field and the direction of the artillery was covered by smoke and dust, he signalled a retreat, forcing the withdraw of the remaining Rathors.\n\nJai Singh\'s army lost several thousands of its soldiers in the battle. According to Chahar Gulzar-i-Shujai of Harcharan Das, who was an eye-witness to the battle, 12,000 of Jai Singh\'s men were killed in the conflict, and another 12,000 were wounded.\n\nThough modern estimates place the losses at 12,000 total.\n\n\n\nFinally around 1:48:00 Mr. Mitra makes a comment about how it took 200 to 300 years for India to adopt gunpowder in a proper way and for anyone who wished to understand how this point is also wrong, they need only look at my previous posts on military technology in the 16th century.\n\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\n\nThe analysis by Mr. Mitra presents an unrealistic view of ancient warfare, it is filled with those misconceptions and generalisations which military history and science as a subject is trying to and has in many cases succeeded in, debunking. Overall the above analysis is hopefully going to present to those who read it with a clearer picture and broader understanding of why horses were necessary in ancient and medieval Warfare, why purely infantry based armies were a fool\'s errand and why medieval kings stressed the need to use cavalry.

      <li>Title::: 'India optimizes for consensus'<br />Body: 'There\'s the old adage, if you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together.\n\nIf India is like a joint family, then Pakistan and Bangladesh are members who left the joint family to live alone. Obviously the ones who decide to go alone expect to have material benefits and a life of their liking sooner than the joint family. At least in theory. Though some things are gained, a lot of intangible benefits are lost.\n\nWhat is the cost of keeping India united as a continent-sized population despite diversity? In the late 1920s the British were taking bets in Parliament that if ever India were given her freedom she would shatter into a thousand tiny provinces within a decade. They were not being foolish or callous, instead what India has achieved is a miracle.\n\nAnd, how is this achieved? By optimizing for consensus.\n\nLet us examine the cost of consensus. It is not difficult to presume that any two friends will decide on a simple question like "where to go for dinner" faster than a party of twenty, assuming everyone\'s needs have to be accommodated.\n\nA small country with a single common language, or 2-3 languages should be rather easy to run in comparison to India, because, theoretically decisions are easier to make. Yet, East Pakistan split from West Pakistan on linguistic and ethnic grounds. Sri Lanka very nearly cleaved into two on the same basis. Reaching consensus requires the strong to sacrifice for the weak, and this isn\'t always easy or pleasant.\n\nNow then, what does it take for India to keep hundreds or thousands of linguistic and ethnic divisions together?\n\nIndia is constantly optimizing for unity. At every turn where a decision to favor one over the other would have been more efficient, India has favored consensus, equity, debate, and compromise. At least so far.\n\nThis is what makes India a potential superpower. No matter how fast the neighboring economies grow they can never get the clout India has for they are minnows, and India is the whale. Britain is discovering this with Brexit to its chagrin. The marriage with the EU was slow and painful but their single life is not as free as they had imagined.\n\nBesides, when you have a culture of consensus automatically things like a democracy, free press, social justice, respect for diversity follow.\n\nSince Reagan and Thatcher perhaps, the world has latched onto GDP and the economy as the sole parameters with which to decide the success of nations. This is awfully short sighted and profoundly ignorant of human needs.\n\nI honestly don\'t know whether India will manage another 70-80 years of unity - the new thinking appears to be solely driven by economics.'<br />Author: 'greasesoda'  id: 'nwqufk'<br />Score:25<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nwqufk/india_optimizes_for_consensus/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Historical Racism'<br />Body: "I don't deny that there was probably a racial element to the caste system, the genetics don't lie. It is important though to put Indias racial history in perspective to other places which experienced mass migration of farmers. I don't support the caste system by the way. Let's put things into perspective most regions of the world which experienced mass migration of farmers the indigenous hunter gatherer population was mass driven to extinction often through violence. Historically the more advanced race always dominates the weaker race. \n\nIn a way i believe the caste sytem developed in because the population of natives was very high or the caucasian had developed complex beliefs like compassion and tolerance. The caste system was not a good thing, but in most other regions they simply slaughtered or enslaved the natives. Europe, South East asia, Africa experienced mass immigration of farmers, in those regions the indigenous hunter gather ancestry stands at 30% while in India it stands at 60%. Hell given ivc itself was mixed, the australoid ancestry and population probably outnumbers the caucasian counterpart. In africa, the bantu farmers killed off a lot of the local hunter gather population, the remanants are the pygmys who are regularly enslaved and looked as inferior. \n\nIn south east asia, the native population is almost nonexistent, and the small tribes that exist are seen as slaves, savages and historically were placed in the royal zoos of south east asian kings. In no other region of the world does a place like south india exist where large population of descendants of indigenous hunter gatherers exist, no where. In africa the bantu sidelined all othe races who now largely are restricted to horn africa (cushites), nilotes (south sudan). \n\nUltimately this racial tension continues to exist, and prevents india from becoming a free society, without a ridiculous complex system dividing up people into different tribes. India is ultimately evidence that multiculturalism doesn't work. The hope is for free society based on merit, unfortunately I don't think that can work unless everybody is the same races. Mass mixing? The future is probably balkanization."<br />Author: 'falconsam87'  id: 'nwf9bk'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nwf9bk/historical_racism/</li>

      <li>Title::: "In light of recent defections, a reminder how Congress and Sonia Gandhi treated PV Narsimha Rao, it's best leader and Prime Minister, like absolute trash."<br />Body: 'I was a very young boy when my maushi(maternal aunt) would talk very proudly of the prime minister. She was proud of PV Narsimha Rao, because he spoke Marathi and by that logic, my maushi said that we had a Marathi PM in Delhi. She said he spoke 8 languages! And he also brought in liberalisation. I would not know what she meant by that so she said that Rao was the reason MTV, cartoon network and channel V were on TV. At that, even I loved him. Which kid could not love the man responsible for bringing Cartoon network to TV? And at that young age I was also very impressed by the fact that the PM spoke 8 languages. Later I would come to know that it was actually 15.\n\n\nAs I grew older, reading Rao\'s achievements, he seemed even more impressive. He ended the licence Raj, opened up the markets when we had no foreign reserves. \n\n\nWhen Rao entered the office, the GDP growth of India was 1%, and by the time he left it it was a whopping 7.5%.\n\n\nCongress brags a lot about this time and credits Manmohan Singh for it, conveniently forgetting Rao\'s sheer political will to wade through the Congressi muck and saving the country from disaster. \n\n\nBut discrediting him is still the kindest thing Congress and Sonia Gandhi have done to him. To see the full picture we start from the fall of Soviet Union.\n\n\n\n##The fall of Soviet Union, KGB, and the control of Communist forces in India and the opportunity to finally break free -\n\nIn 1991, the cold war ended as the Soviet Union finally broke free from communist rule. And with that the powers of KGB, its feared intelligence organisation withered away. It was a shadow of its previous glory days under Andropov. \n\n\nThis bode good tiding for India because now finally it had wrested free from its control. Although India claimed it was non allied and it was to an extent, it is also known that the KGB had infiltrated the upper echelons of Congress party with Indira Gandhi being their top asset.\n\n\nWith their fall and Russia being busy with dissenting nations all around them, India had the best opportunity to liberalise and move away from the quicksand of communism. \n\n\nRao did exactly that and moreover he had the presence of mind to keep tabs on Sonia Gandhi for any mischief.\n\n\n\n##Rao being distrustful of Sonia Gandhi -\n\nEven though Rao was lower in the pecking order in the Congress party, when Sonia and other senior leaders refused the PM post, he took it and didn\'t really act subservient to the Gandhi clan. \n\n\nHe even recruited the Intelligence Bureau to keep tabs on suspect Congress party members too see if they were acting against the country. \n\n\nSonia Gandhi obviously came to know of this because many senior party leaders still reported to her, even though she never took part in governance at all. For 2 years she mourned her husband\'s death and for 3 more years she seethed in silence to deal with Rao.\n\n\n\n##Jan Sangh wins the election in 1996, and Sonia Gandhi starts to make her moves against Rao -\n\nAs soon as Congress lost their elections, the blame for the loss was put squarely on Rao\'s shoulders. \n\n\nIt is to be noted that Rao took the blame silently never publicly speaking out against the blame.\n\n\nTo further twist the knife in his back, Sonia removed him from the post of party president and gave it to the perrenial bootlicker sitaram kesari. Rao took this in silence too.\n\n\nThere are even reports that Rao did not get any monetary benefits from his own party after he was kicked out. Sonia had completely isolated him.\n\n\nIn this isolation his health deteriorated and he was forced to sell his house to cover the costs of lawyers and doctors until death took him.\n\n\n\n##Sonia did not spare him any disgrace even after his death -\n\nIt is a tradition for esteemed leaders that after their death, their bodies are taken to AICC headquarters in Delhi so that senior leaders can pay their respects.\n\n\nHis body was denied entry at Congress Bhavan. It\'s gates were locked shut. His body waited outside for hours as people called Sonia pleasing her to let his body in. She denied permission.\n\n\nIt is also tradition that of a PM passes away, he is given a state funeral in Delhi. When some leaders appealed to Shivraj Patil, he famously said , **"No one will come!"**\n\n\nWhy? Because Sonia had said so.\n\n\nHis funeral was held in his home state of Andhra where his people provided for a funeral. \n\n\n**Sonia Gandhi did not attend.**\n\n\n**Lal Krishna Advani, of BJP attended the cremation.**\n\n\nIt is tradition that when the cremation of such a big dignatary is going on, people wait around until the fire goes out. Nobody waited and the fire went out too soon. His body lay there half burnt. His family members had to light fire to the funeral pyre again.\n\n\nSonia had threatened the Andhra Congress leaders from attending the funeral. She even directed the state police to stop any Congress party leader from attending.\n\n\nIn hindsight, Vajpayee\'s death was mourned for 7 days. The national flag was at half mast for seven whole days and his cremation was seen to until his body turned to ashes.\n\n\n##BJP and the Sangh takes charge of honouring Rao -\n\nIt was finally BJP that took the onus upon themselves to honour Rao\'s legacy. They erected a memorial in New Delhi, fastracked by the intentions of Modi. \n\n\nModi even spoke about Rao\'s daring policies in time of dire crisis and applauded his actions in a full parliament. The same way he has paid respects to Manmohan\'s legacy.\n\n\nThis exposes the stark contrast between how the two parties function at polar opposites. BJP gives credit where credit is due whereas Sonia and Rahul lay fire on anyone who doesn\'t toe their line. \n\n\nThis is exemplified by the recent exodus of senior leaders the most visible being Jyotiraditya Scindia and Sachin Pilot. \n\n\nI am reminded of the famous quote of Manmohan Singh while writing about this dastardly business -\n\n***"History will be kinder to me..."***\n\n\nI truly believe that it will be. Who knows what difficulties he went through while being under Sonia\'s toes. Singh learned firsthand how Sonia treats dissenters by being close to both Rao and her.\n\n\nOne day Sonia will also pass through and when she does, the skeletons will tumble out, and when they do, I honestly think history will be kinder to him. \n\n\nAfter all how oppressive it must be to serve under a queen whilst being a prime minister of a democracy.\n\n\nThat\'s it \n\nNamaste.\n\n\nSources in chronological order -\n\nIndira Gandhi a KGB puppet -\n\nhttps://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/nation/story/20051003-mitrokhin-archive-kgb-operations-in-india-during-cold-war-786931-2005-10-03\n\n\nRao\'s distrust of Sonia -\n\nhttps://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/narasimha-rao-kept-tabs-on-sonia-via-the-ib/295234/\n\n\n\nHow Rao\'s body wasn\'t even let into AICC\'s compound for paying respects -\n\nhttps://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-his-body-wasn-t-let-into-aicc-compound-how-sonia-gandhi-insulted-former-pm-narsimha-rao-2630452\n\n\nHow Sonia resented the fact that Rao stopped licking her boots -\n\nhttps://m.economictimes.com/opinion/interviews/vinay-sitapati-on-congress-betrayal-of-pv-narasimha-rao-and-bjps-attempts-at-reviving-his-legacy/articleshow/52918738.cms\n\n\nNo state funeral.

      <li>Title::: 'Why do liberals like to separate Hindus and the lower castes?'<br />Body: "When I hear historians, writers like Audrey Trushke, Arundhati Roy talk, they always refer to Hindus as the upper castes, sometimes even only as Brahmins. The reason, which may be the answer to my question, is because its easier to pursue their agenda when Indians are more divided. \n\nThe problem is, it didn't work. For a while when Congress used to rule, I really thought that a large group of people from the lower castes will aggressively go against Hindu culture and India will become even more chaotic than it was at the time. \n\nBut it didn't happen. Their influence seems to be only in urban centers. They must've been shocked when the lower castes of the Hindi belt gave overwhelming support to BJP. I think the reason is because, lower castes identify more with their own Hindu practices instead of the rift with upper castes. This idea that they're not Hindus probably feels alien and manufactured to them.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'nvfsfh'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nvfsfh/why_do_liberals_like_to_separate_hindus_and_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[OC] Have any of you ever considered going from being an employee to being an employer, and starting your own company/business?'<br />Body: '##I had shared my journey a month back in some obscure buried comment somewhere, but I figured I\'d put it up here again, hoping to inspire some of you to consider it as a real option:\n\nI run an MSME company I set up myself around 6 years back, after quitting the corporate rat race. I was in my late-20s back then. I was tired of slogging my ass off, working bizarre shifts, pulling all-nighters for "critical" projects, and being a wage slave, all of it for people who didn\'t care about me. I had gained enough experience in almost every aspect of the industry to realize I could run my own operation. \n\n#**Setting up your own company is dirt cheap and extremely simple.** \n\n\n&gt;**NOTE: Please do NOT get into this with the idea that you\'re gonna be rolling around in a Benz within 5 years. This isn\'t a "get rich quick" scheme.** If you\'re looking for that, I do know a Nigerian Prince. \n\n&gt;**This is still a work-your-ass-off scheme. Minimize expenses, maximize savings. It\'s just that instead of a company, you\'re working hard for yourself and your own clients/products now. This is about exploring other options that *might* be better suited to you.** \n\nI started off by just renting a desk at one of those workshala-type spaces for 5k/month - *just search for "shared office space" on magicbricks*. That was enough to register my company, and open my company account (entire process takes around a week and costs less than 1-2k). Already had my own laptop (a standard hardworking Acer Aspire I got at a discount from croma sometime in 2014), and the workspace provided internet (ACT) at no extra charge (cost included in the rent of my desk). The office was airconditioned, and had backup power from a big set of inverters. \n\nTotal cost in first month - 7-8k\n\n&gt;If you\'re a young chap sitting at home and are unemployed, wasting your time, you can start your own company. You don\'t even need that 7k. That desk rental, bank account, and company registration can wait. Start by making ads and marketing yourself! Decide on your product, your company name, get a domain, make your website, start getting work and doing projects for clients as a freelancer.\nOnce you are confident you have clients you can officialise it\n\nBasically, what some folks can spend on a night of drinking was enough to start my own company. After that, I just needed to do enough work to pay that monthly bill of 5k + whatever home/commute expenses I had. Getting projects worth 15k to 50k+ is a bit of a challenge when you have to do it *every single month*, but it\'s certainly doable. Started collaborating with freelancers to get more work done and to get more clients.\n\nIn a few months, I hired a few beginners full-time for cheap, and got them each a desk at the same place (extra 10k expense). I trained them from scratch, and now we could handle double the workload *(because the two of them were still beginners and together they could barely do as much work as myself alone)*. First year had some level of loss (started digging into my savings to pay for it). After that, they finally got trained, and the company started doing enough work and making enough money to pay those two plus their workspace costs comfortably, while I was running my business.\n\nA year later I moved into a proper full office, hired some more people, and now we handle some big clients, have our own (software) products in the market, and provide solutions to corporates. It took 3-4 years of toiling but it finally took off. Soon we\'ll launch a product where the monthly revenue from just maintaining it and keeping it functional, for the customers licensing it from us, should generate more than we normally get from our big clients - just in licensing fees.\n\nBasically, if you save up some 15-20k, and you\'re a serious, competent software/web dev, or you have some innovative or niche product ideas that are practical and serious, you DO have the potential to start your own company and go from being an employee or wage-slave, to being an employer and entrepreneur.\n\n##TLDR: Most people **heavily** overestimate how much it costs to start your own business. I\'m no MBA or whatever. I can just about do my taxes and hate finance. I\'m a sci-tech geek with good skills and excellent quality (thanks to a background in design).'<br />Author: 'fsm_vs_cthulhu'  id: 'nv17mb'<br />Score:36<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nv17mb/oc_have_any_of_you_ever_considered_going_from/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Are Indians very judgmental?'<br />Body: "Judgmentalism can be defined as forming an opinion too quickly. For example, you judge someone by their religion, but when you get to know them, your find out that they are different from your initial impression. We do this all the time not just to people, but objects, activities, feelings, etc. For example, some men judge yoga to be feminine and boring, but when they do it, its actually fun, plus the added health benefits. \n\nObviously some people are more judgmental than others. But are some cultures/civilizations more judgmental than others? I believe so. I think that Indians can be extremely judgmental towards someone based on the job that they do. Another group that's guilty of this is the Chinese. \n\nWhile elitism does exist in the West, it is very common for example, for a successful businesswoman to marry a fireman or a university professor to constantly get together with his childhood friend, who is a taxi driver. Its like these people just care less about what you do for a living, they like you for your personality. People like these also exist in India, but their influence in Indian culture is far lesser than the judgmental Indians. \n\nImagine living in a world full of these people, instead of the judgmentals. The society becomes more egalitarian, where you don't have this mildly disgust feeling when you look at someone who does a simple or menial job, or for that matter no job."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'nuf3c1'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nuf3c1/are_indians_very_judgmental/</li>

Yet I never seemed to ponder what was so great about it. I'd want to ask why you, as an Indian, feel proud of your heritage?\n\nPersonally, I do believe that India's ancient history affected and influenced the rest of the world, but what else? We slid into a steady fall after the Gupta dynasty's demise. In the ‘Sone ki Chidiya’ we talk about, it’s the rich who prospered. As foreign conquerors ravaged and exploited the subcontinent, societal and scientific progress slowed. Hindustan was never a flimsy concept for Indian rulers. Hindu dynasties failed to stand united. The wealthy Southern dynasties were always at odds with one another. Casteism continued to be prevalent, even under the valiant Marathas. What makes us so proud of our Medieval heritage? Is there anything else to be really proud of if it wasn't the wars?\n\nI enjoy the architecture of Ancient India, particularly the temples and caves. I admire India's rich culture and landscape. I am proud of India's freedom, how the union of states was founded, and how the Indian constitution was drafted. It's interesting to observe how our India has changed throughout time. We are divided by diversity, but we remain unified as Indians.\n\nI am not a historian, for all the chauvinists. Just an ordinary Indian who pondered an idea I had about Bharat and her history.

      <li>Title::: 'Are regional parties a danger to national unity?'<br />Body: "Politics is division by definition, if there was no disagreement there would be no politics. And, division is violence, also by definition. The more politics there is, the more violent a nation becomes.\n\nIn most democratic countries the national parties also contest the regional elections, but this hasn't been the case in India for decades now in several key states.\n\nAt the moment the state of national politics is such that a party that wins a mere 30-35% of the nation's vote can form power in the center, and the bulk of this vote share can be gained from UP and neighboring states. This excludes many of the border states from the power center and pushes them towards regionalism and separatism.\n\nHaving just two national parties in the US has meant that there isn't an Alaskan party fighting for Alaskan rights, or a California party trying to secede from the nation. Whereas in India regional parties have been making the claim of regional nationalism for decades. Except for the center mass of India, nearly every border state has bred a strong separatist ideology.\n\nThese parties offer a very attractive target for India's enemies. There's almost certainly direct and indirect support being lent to separatist causes. Given the [well documented](https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/chinas-chairman-is-our-chairman-why-china-will-forever-haunt-cpim) history of Chinese support to the CPI(M) and their [anti-India work](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/cpim-editorial-blames-india-for-ongoing-border-dispute-with-china), new parties [shouldn't follow this model](https://swarajyamag.com/news-brief/malaysia-probes-tamil-nadu-politician-seeman-for-ltte-links-after-arrest-of-12-on-terror-funding-charge) of living on foreign support.\n\nOn a recent issue of the Amazon Prime show Family Man 2 there are several pro-LTTE parties that have once again come out quite openly against the Indian state. Their [history of separatism is well known](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/de-register-ntk-congress-urges-ec/article29675644.ece), and their hatred for the idea of a united India is evident, because [a strong India weakens their case for a separate land](https://thefederal.com/states/south/tamil-nadu/seeman-stirs-up-controversy-glorifying-rajiv-gandhi-killers/).\n\nIf LTTE had succeeded in creating a separate Eelam, it would have almost certainly  triggered a similar movement in TN. As it is, parties like the NTK, which got nearly 7% of the vote openly claim to be the political arm of the LTTE and claim to [fight for the liberation of Tamils worldwide](https://mobile.twitter.com/ethirajans/status/1322793271211380738).\n\nIndia's greatest danger then seems to come from its own very permissive political arena."<br />Author: 'greasesoda'  id: 'nu3k08'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nu3k08/are_regional_parties_a_danger_to_national_unity/</li>

So its shipped from Bengaluru and then to Goa and now its in shimogaa. But the destination is in Bagalkot! Can anyone explain why amazon ships its stuff like this? Don't know is this isbthe right forum for this, but this has always annoyed me! It takes some eight to ten hours for me travel between Bengaluru and Bagalkot through buses. I always thought these businesses take the shortest route possible to deliver stuff but its ridiculous! This thing originated in the state capital then out of state and again back to the state to a different city, but no where near the destination! Shimogga is again a very far place! Why is this how amazon operates?"<br />Author: 'stupidid12_'  id: 'nu23ty'<br />Score:25<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nu23ty/the_logistics_of_amazon_india/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Would we have been better off if we were 100 percent Islamic or Christian or Buddhist?'<br />Body: 'Controversial but your thoughts on it. A lot of Christian states are ahead of us or on par with us. A lot of Islamic states are ahead of us maybe because of oil but still they are ahead. Buddhist yes except for probs Cambodia. \nHow much has our religion negatively influenced GDP? \n\nI can provide some reasons behind it. \n1) Monopoly over learning : Probably destroyed our capacity to learn anything beyond rote memorization. Even Brahmins were affected by this . According to the 1880 Census like 90 percent of the Brahmins couldn’t read or write. \n2) Concept of Kala Paani: This is so overlooked . The concept of losing your caste if you travel over the sea. So Ridiculous.
