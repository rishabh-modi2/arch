It will cause perpetual habitation in hell." Such statements by Arjuna were due to ignorance only. He wanted to become nonviolent in the discharge of his specific duty. For a kṣatriya to be in the battlefield and to become nonviolent is the philosophy of fools. In the Parāśara-smṛti or religious codes made by Parāśara, the great sage and father of Vyāsadeva, it is stated:\n\nkṣatriyo hi prajā rakṣan śastra-pāṇiḥ pradaṇḍayan                                                                                      \nnirjitya parasainyādi kṣitiṁ dharmeṇa pālayet.\n\n"The kṣatriya\'s duty is to protect the citizens from all kinds of difficulties, and for that reason he has to apply violence in suitable cases for law and order. Therefore he has to conquer the soldiers of inimical kings, and thus, with religious principles, he should rule over the world."\n\nConsidering all aspects, Arjuna had no reason to refrain from fighting. If he should conquer his enemies, he would enjoy the kingdom; and if he should die in the battle, he would be elevated to the heavenly planets whose doors were wide open to him. Fighting would be for his benefit in either case.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the duties of a kshatriya ?

      <li>Title::: 'Ancient India II: Hinduism and Classical Hindu philosophy'<br />Body: 'If you look at "What is Hinduism?" sort of videos and articles on the web, you\'ll often see the same recurring themes: reincarnation, Brahman as a "universal consciousness", caste. The latter is viewed as a special evil, and interpreted through the lens of Marxism; the first two are viewed as something good, and interpreted through the lens of hipsterism.\n\nThere are various political reasons for this narrative, such as the desire to depict Ancient India as a weak, hippie civilization, which if you\'ve read my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g1g7f6/ancient_india_i_inventions_and_discoveries/), it was the polar opposite of. There is also the fact that historians are not really bright enough to understand what\'s important, etc. \n\nIn particular, I tend to believe that these arbitrary simplifications particularly gloss over an important aspect of Hinduism: the **philosophy**.\n\nI would summarize a religion as being an ideology (or a shared framework for constructing such ideologies) comprised of three aspects:\n\n* A philosophy/morality\n* A theology/history\n* A metaphysics/physics\n\nYou may have noted that very few discussions on the "History of philosophy" discuss Hinduism (and if they do discuss Indian philosophy, it\'s usually Buddhism) – such discussions are usually centered around a clash between Western philosophy and Eastern philosophy.\n\nI find this absurd. Greek philosophy is not the same as Enlightenment philosophy (arguably Hindu philosophy is closer to Enlightenment philosophy). Asian philosophies differ greatly from each other. And Hindu philosophy, particularly the Gita, provide some of the most important insights in philosophy before the modern era.\n\n**A timeline of Indic philosophies**\n\n*Upanishads*\n\nThe oldest known philosophical literature in the world is that of the **Upanishads** (c. 800-323 BC). Upanishadic philosophy was centered in the West-Central Gangetic region (Kuru, Panchala, Shurasena/Mathura, Kosala/Ayodhya), and according to its own classification was a part of Vedic literature.\n\nThe Upanishads are, in a sense, the philosophical foundation for Classical India. It is here that *Sathya* and *Dharma* was first exalted, where slogans like *Sathyameva Jayate* ("Truth alone triumphs"), *Aham Brahmasmi* ("The self is God") were first developed. Upanishadic philosophy contained the first notions of **individualism** in the world (and arguably the only one until the Enlightenment), and e.g. in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, exalted the self as the objective of all morality. \n\nOutside of philosophy, the Upanishadic era saw a great increase in urbanization in India, with several [advancements in mathematics, finance and medicine](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g1g7f6/ancient_india_i_inventions_and_discoveries/) which were considered a part of Hindu literature.\n\nAround the same time, c. 600 BC, the Eastern Gangetic plain also developed the Shramana philosophical tradition. In ascending order of how much they loved monks: Charvaka, Ajivika, Jainism, Buddhism. Although these were "atheistic" philosophies in the sense that they did not worship a god, Jainism and Buddhism contained plenty of other metaphysical notions like reincarnation. Ajivikas rejected free will. Charvaka and Jains also contributed to mathematical literature, and Charvaka philosophy seemed to contain an early qualitative description of statistical inference. \n\n*Bhagavad Gita*\n\nThe culmination of the Upanishads was the **Bhagavad Gita**, which comprised the philosophical/moral (as well as metaphysical) part of the **Hindu synthesis** of the Mauryan period.\n\nThe Gita was fundamental to the history of meta-ethics. For the first time, man recognized that ethics (*Dharma*) was fundamentally about action (*Karma*), and ethics was formulated in this language (contrast this with Greek philosophy, which thought that ethics was about "virtue"). Various ideas that were at one point considered disparate – work, politics, ritual, culture – were unified under the umbrella of ethics, as they were all fundamentally about human action. The Gita represented a **unification of the discipline of ethics** – its significance to philosophy cannot be overstated.\n\nIt also provides a literary basis for both the **interpretations of the caste system**: the "varna is about your work" and "varna is about your morality" paradigms – according to the Gita, the main source of your morality in an urban society *is* your work.\n\nThe Gita was, however, markedly less adamant than the Upanishads in its view of what is moral. Unlike many of the Upanishads which condemned both ritual and ascetism as mindless, the Gita considered them viable paths for an individual to take up. Perhaps this is because the Gita was fundamentally more of a meta-ethical text than an ethical one – telling people to be rational in their ethical principles, rather than telling them what their ethical principles should be. Or perhaps because it genuinely did not believe ritual and ascetism to be immoral.\n\nIt\'s also interesting to note the parallels between the Gita and the **Arthashastra**: both can be seen as a "unification of human action". The Gita unified the normative (ethical) aspects of human action into *ethics*, while the Arthashastra unified the positive (scientific) aspects into *economics*.\n\nThrough its integration into the Mahabharata, the Gita became accessible to the masses, and formed the basis of Hindu society. \n\n*Southern advancements*\n\nThe famous philosophers of the South Indian Golden Age did not alter the intellectual core of Hindu philosophy but rather expanded its intellectual base. \n\nAt this point, I\'m really interpreting rather than reading, but I believe that: \n\n* The distinction between *Nirguna Brahman* and *Saguna Brahman* is interpreted as a **distinction between ethics and virtue**. Shankaracharya holds ethics to be fundamental, and not fundamentally related to specific virtues, which rather crop up as characteristics of individuals. This theme certainly appears in Vaishnavite theology, in which e.g. Rama and Krishna have very different personalities but are nonetheless both considered *Purushottama*.\n* Shankaracharya\'s distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism – Hinduism believed that the self exists, while Buddhism only believes in a collective – is a divide between **individualist** Hinduism and **collectivist** Buddhism. This would make Madhvacharya\'s philosophy perhaps "more" individualistic than Shankaracharya\'s. \n\n**Miscellaneous comments**\n\n* The emphasis on **Sathya** (truth) is something uniquely Hindu in the ancient world. This was noted by several foreign travelers of the time: E.g. according to Vivekananda, a Greek historian noted that "no Hindu man was known to tell an untruth and no Hindu woman was known to be unchaste" (if anyone knows a primary source, tell me). See also [\\[1\\]](https://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/2017/jan/30/hindus-seen-through-foreign-eyes-1564982.html)[\\[2\\]](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rRtdDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT33)\n* There is something interesting to be said about the notions of *Sanskriti* (civilization) and *Prakriti* (nature). The former is clearly held as superior to the latter (e.g. Prakrits are considered to be unrefined languages, inferior to Sanskrit), nonetheless it does not have zero value, e.g. the policy of ahimsa. The general principle seems to be that you should sacrifice *Prakriti* if it brings a benefit to *Sanskriti* (i.e. if it benefits man), but you shouldn\'t kill animals just for kicks.\n\nI generally view Classical Hinduism as a right-wing, anthropocentric ideology at least for its time. I\'m not a fan of attempts to portray it in a light that makes it appealing to the left – claiming that it was environmentalist, or feminist. If you lose your ideology, then all you\'re preserving is the name "Hinduism", not the actual ideas it represents.\n\nPlanned series:\n\n* [Ancient India I: inventions and discoveries](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g1g7f6/ancient_india_i_inventions_and_discoveries/)\n* Ancient India II: Hinduism and classical Hindu philosophy\n* Ancient India III: a timeline\n* Ancient India IV: an economic history\n* Ancient India V: speculations on history and mythology'<br />Author: 'srimahalingam'  id: 'g4d5bs'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g4d5bs/ancient_india_ii_hinduism_and_classical_hindu/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Covid 19 - My thoughts'<br />Body: "I don't want to be pessimistic, but I have been watching the developments very closely since Jan. I am connected with many frequent international flyers and have lived in many of the countries currently badly affected. Here are a few predictions based on my observations and understanding. Please feel free to refute it, I would love to engage and learn from your perspectives as well, as long as the logics presented don't have religious connotations and as long as you don't try getting personal:\n\n1. **No vaccine for a few years, maybe decades:** COVID 19 belongs to the same family of the common cold [coronaviruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus). The common cold affects billions of people every year and has been known for centuries. Yet, [we haven't been able to find a vaccine for it. ](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/qa/why-is-there-not-a-vaccine-for-the-common-cold)At max, we are only able to suppress its symptoms. There's no reason for us to believe we'll find a vaccine for a more lethal and relatively unknown virus from the same family. \n2. **No immunity:** Most human beings suffer common cold multiple times in their lives. This means the immunity developed after the common cold coronavirus isn't effective in preventing it in the future. There's no reason to believe our body will develop immunity against a relatively more deceptive version of coronavirus. In fact, some people who had been cured of Covid 19, [were tested positive after complete recovery.](https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/179-recovered-south-korean-coronavirus-patients-tested-positive-again/)\n3. **Billion plus people will get infected in the next 3 years:**\n   1. Coronavirus started with one person and has already infected millions of people. Today (April 19 2020), we have over **1.5 M active known cases**, and probably more undetected. These people are enough to infect a few hundred million, who will then affect more people\n   2. **People and countries are losing patience:** France, Italy, Spain et all are already considering easing lockdown, despite 100K plus active cases (detected and undetected) in each of the countries. In the USA, there are protest against lockdown/stay at home orders. Until the number of infected cases goes down single digits in every country, multiple waves of coronavirus infections are inevitable.  \n   3. **Lockdown longer than 2-3 months isn't feasible:** The economies will tumble to a level that'll make life difficult for everyone, rich or poor. Food, sanitation, hospitals etc. are all going to be troubled, causing mass panic and a perfect atmosphere for the coronavirus to flourish. \n   4. **Mutations - the worst case:** This is mere speculation, but [potential mutations](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/video/science-technology/covid-19-isolated-virus-mutation-found-in-india-raises-alarm-70499) in Covid 19 can make it even more lethal. \n4. **India's century:**\n   1. India has been dealing with multiple [lethal diseases](https://www.icicilombard.com/insurance-information/health-insurance-info/article/what's-killing-india-knowing-top-10-killer-death-diseases-in-india/) for many decades, yet growing and flourishing. It's unlikely that Covid 19 will top the list of causes of deaths in India. \n   2. China had already lost its advantage as the manufacturing hub with rising labor costs, Covid 19 is a nail in the coffin. India is the next best possible replacement with younger manpower that's available in abundance and a large, tech workforce. \n   3. It will no longer be an oil dominated global economy with travel taking a back seat. In fact, India might just be able to tap into its large Thorium reserves and develop tech to harness it, and export it to the world. \n   4. Agriculture is going to become even more important with the world turning to more vegetarian options. Agriculture is already India's strength. Also, the agriculture sector is likely to get more hard-working manpower with laborers returning to villages (and are unlikely to return after this traumatic experience and inhuman treatment by the city dwellers). \n5. **So what's the solution?**\n   1. **Accept the new normal:** It'll take time, but the world is going to be a lot different here on. Much less travel, fewer mass gatherings, regular lockdowns whenever there's a spike etc. We will need to accept the new normal and design our life, economy and the country accordingly. \n   2. **Develop your immunity:** This is probably the single most important thing Indians need to do. More exercise, more vitamin C and more sunlight. It sounds trivial, but this is going to save millions of lives. \n   3. **Closed borders:** Until the world recovers completely, we shouldn't allow many travelers from abroad. We should fix COVID in India at any cost and close our borders, and encourage domestic travel"<br />Author: 'CoolGuess'  id: 'g49pe7'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g49pe7/covid_19_my_thoughts/</li>

It is an amazingly ridiculous thought but is propagated widely by twitter.\n\nFirst of all Covid 19 is not a killer virus. For unknown reasons it has infected far fewer people in the poor countries of Asia . Second the mortality rate is a mere 3 percent and the people who get killed are old people. That leaves the young to propagate a whole new population. Thirdly, the virus does does not differentiate between religions as does the present Fascist government at the center. But a government that thinks that lighting candles at an auspicious hour will get rid of the virus can be expected to think that viruses can be trained like dogs to identify Hindus and kill them.\n\nLet me give you a time table of what happened:\nDec 31 2019: China informs the WHO about unusual cases of pneumonia.\n\nJanuary 7 2020: China reports its first death\n\nJanuary 31 2020: India\'s First case of Corona virus reported from Kerala....No action taken.

But the good thing about American politics is that, there are intellectuals who are out there debating and discussing with each other, which furthers the discourse around a topic and helps the commoners to have proper basis for their biases. But the worrying part here for India is that : Indian Right-Wing lacks proper intellectuals who can stand eye-to-eye with the Left-Wing intellectuals (or the RW intellectuals are astronomically less popular than the LW ones).\n\n\n\nThis is gradually creating a chasm in the political discourse in India as the LW narrative has gained and is gaining even more importance than ever because of, again, **social media**. The amount of times I have seen RW commoners peddling baseless accusations and fake news is astronomically higher than LW ones, which is weakening the RW narrative, even if they are correct (like the CAA fiasco). And here, I am mainly focusing on the young commoners, as the old chaps are permanently embossed by the RW propaganda and beyond the point of no return.\n\n\nOne more important reason for the weakening of RW narratives is the absolutely abysmal state of Indian TV media (except for NDTV). Even if a channel has a bias, the news and opinions are being presented more as **infotainment** than *journalism*, something which NDTV rarely does and hence, it is heavily preferred by the youth.\n\n\nI don\'t know if you all know but people like Dhruv Rathee, Akash Banerjee, Kunal Kamra, Kanhaiya Kumar, Varun Grover, etc. have far, far more outreach and connect with the youth as compared to Anand Ranganathan, Abhijit Iyer, Shambhav Sharma, that AnOpenLetter guy, Nitin Rivaldo, etc. This imbalance will be disastrous if RW cannot come up with intellectuals of their own *as well as* make them popular.\n\n\nAmerican politics is a shitshow, and Indian politics is becoming a shitshow. The only saving grace for American politics is the presence of actual informed, intellectual (I know this is getting repetitive but bear for me) people on both sides which helps furthers "discourse". For every Ben Shapiro there is a John Oliver/Stephen Colbert. For mediating between the two we have (fairly) Centrist people like Joe Rogan. India heavily lacks this balance, and this is going to get even more disastrous if the Indian RW keeps on relying on garbage government-mouthpieces like OpIndia and idiotic spokespersons like Sambit Patra or religious leaders like Sadhguru, as the youth just can\'t have that "connect" with such people. And the youth will eventually decide **everything**.\n\n\n\nAlthough I must say that the RW hasn\'t been lethargic here. There are some promising and emerging ones like Swarajyamag, journalist Swati Goel Sharma, An Open Letter, etc. which are doing a damn fine job, but they really need to up their game. And the RW peeps too need to promote people like them and not garbage like OpIndia/AKTK. Or else forget about having an informed youth on your side in the future and be ready for an emerging Communist movement. The funny thing is, India is already a fairly socialist country, so this is going to be a smooth *adventure*.\n\n\n\nP.S. : I would like to repeat, I absolutely loathe BJP/Modi. But what I do like, is a balanced intellectual space for discussions. Hence, this post.'<br />Author: 'sv_rexy'  id: 'g41unu'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g41unu/the_indian_rightwing_is_losing_the_intellectual/</li>

Kṣat means hurt. One who gives protection from harm is called kṣatriya (trayate-to give protection). The kṣatriyas are trained for killing in the forest. A kṣatriya would go into the forest and challenge a tiger face to face and fight with the tiger with his sword. When the tiger was killed, it would be offered the royal order of cremation. This system is being followed even up to the present day by the kṣatriya kings of Jaipur state. The kṣatriyas are specially trained for challenging and killing because religious violence is sometimes a necessary factor. Therefore, kṣatriyas are never meant for accepting directly the order of sannyāsa or renunciation. Nonviolence in politics may be a diplomacy, but it is never a factor or principle. In the religious law books it is stated:\n\nāhaveṣu mitho \'nyonyaṁ jighāṁsanto mahīkṣitaḥ                                                                         \nyuddhamānāḥ paraṁ śaktyā svargaṁ yānty aparāṅmukhāḥ                                                                   \nyajñeṣu paśavo brahman hanyante satataṁ dvijaiḥ                                                                              \nsaṁskṛtāḥ kila mantraiś ca te \'pi svargam avāpnuvan.\n\n"In the battlefield, a king or kṣatriya, while fighting another king envious of him, is eligible for achieving heavenly planets after death, as the brāhmaṇas also attain the heavenly planets by sacrificing animals in the sacrificial fire." Therefore, killing on the battle on the religious principle and the killing of animals in the sacrificial fire are not at all considered to be acts of violence, because everyone is benefitted by the religious principles involved. The animal sacrificed gets a human life immediately without undergoing the gradual evolutionary process from one form to another, and the kṣatriyas killed in the battlefield also attain the heavenly planets as do the brāhmaṇas who attain them by offering sacrifice.\n\nThere are two kinds of svadharmas, specific duties. As long as one is not liberated, one has to perform the duties of that particular body in accordance with religious principles in order to achieve liberation. When one is liberated, one\'s svadharma-specific duty-becomes spiritual and is not in the material bodily concept. In the bodily conception of life there are specific duties for the brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas respectively, and such duties are unavoidable. Svadharma is ordained by the Lord, and this will be clarified in the Fourth Chapter. On the bodily plane svadharma is called varṇāśrama-dharma, or man\'s steppingstone for spiritual understanding. Human civilization begins from the stage of varṇāśrama-dharma, or specific duties in terms of the specific modes of nature of the body obtained. Discharging one\'s specific duty in any field of action in accordance with varṇāśrama-dharma serves to elevate one to a higher status of life.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the two kinds of svadharmas ? Why one should follow one\'s svadharma ? How svadharma changes after liberation ?**\n\n**Question 2 : What is the meaning of the word kṣatriya ? What are the duties of a kṣatriya ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p1xo9ki3pot41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6aa9300fc8cf5802af6c2502ce9b19023d10805\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'g3zsmy'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g3zsmy/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_231/</li>

Until you can figure out which is a rabid dog and which isn't, you are better off staying away from ALL dogs. This isn't very different. Let us not make it look like racist.

It accepts a fantastic finale. A joyfully ever after. Or on the other hand would it be advisable for me to state, 'acche din' ? This is the straight worldview, which Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism don't buy in to. \n\nIn the lndic worldview, there are no full stops, just commas. There is no armaggedon. There is no 'day of atonement'. There are just ceaseless fights among devas and asuras, with rotating triumphs and annihilations. The devas are the entitled occupants of divine locales and the asuras are the inhabitants of the underground districts who feel deceived, precluded and cheated from securing heaven. \n\nThe Mughal painters, and later the European orientalists, saw the devas as 'divine beings' and asuras as 'evil spirits', and Amar Chitra Katha conveyed this misreading forward. But in the Puranas, they are two sets of youngsters with a common father, Rishi Kashyapa, however different mothers, Aditi and Diti. The devas are special as they got the contributions of the yagna; the asuras are unprivileged as they don't get similar contributions thus fight the devas for it, or try to upset the yagna itself. \n\nFrom this mythic understanding comes the Hindu proverb 'vasudhaiva kutumbakam', which signifies 'the world is my family'. In spite of mainstream suspicions, this is no cheerful family. Here brothers, similar to the devas and asuras of the Puranas, fight over heaven and yagna. Here brothers, Kauravas and Pandavas of the Mahabharata, fight over property, much the same as Vali and Sugriva of the Ramayana. This is the base clash. Democratic elections every 5 years stay a fight for vote share. Brothers are as yet fighting like dogs over meat, neither ready to share or team up. Every one needing the lion's offer. \n\nThe heros of Hindu stories are not true/good. They are basically people who can defeat their envisioned dread, but for a second, and can be liberal and offer the world with their brothers. The villains are the individuals who can't do as such. The villian isn't evil (a word with no interpretation in any Sanskrit or Tamil based language). The villian is simply scared; in fear, he sticks to riches and power and honored position, similar to a canine sticking to its bone, a kid sticking to its toy. That is the reason Ram isn't furious when he is shooting arrows at Ravana; nor is Krishna irate with Duryodhana or Bhisma or Drona, who are devoured by their instabilities. He resembles the celestial parent managing an frightened thus irrational youngster. Understanding this bhaav is critical to understanding Hindu sacred texts. \n\nThis bhaav is missing from Rahul's discourse. Reasonable, the RSS and the BJP will say this is on the grounds that he is the child of an Italian Christian mother. Be that as it may, the RSS and the BJP, Modi included, don't show this bhaav in their discourses. The red hot talk of an evangelist prepared to cast out the Devil is more their style. As a matter of fact, it is everybody's style in a modern vote based system. It is the thing that wins spirits, and votes. \n\nYou don't see Rahul breaking down, similar to Arjuna at Kurukshetra, at the sight that he is assaulting his own brothers and cousins and family individuals. You positively don't see Modi sobbing at the idea of offending Manmohan Singh, or releasing troll armed forces against the individuals who state anything against him. Both of them subscribe  to the modern reading  of the Mahabharata. The binary of Pandava/truth and Kaurava/power is progressively Christian and western, than Hindu or Indian. This epistemological structure is at the core of Hinduism, and Indianness, not the corrective saffron. \n\nHere, we need a ruler who resembles Vishnu, who gets the quarreling devas and asuras to surrender the tug of war  and churn the ocean of milk and carry Lakshmi to everybody's life. A Vishnu who in the long run lets Kauravas get a seat in heaven, close by the Pandavas, helping them welcome the genuine significance of family."<br />Author: 'KaleidoscopicRobber'  id: 'g3u213'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g3u213/rahul_and_modi/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Wikipedia India is corrupt,bais and misogynistic.'<br />Body: 'edit: bias*\n\nYears ago, my friend and I collaborated to write an investigative article on Wikipedia. The plan was to expose the entrenched gang of Wikipedia editors who earn money by creating and editing Wikipedia pages. A Bollywood producer helped me with the contact of an agency.\nThe plan was to pose as the PR agency of a relatively unknown actress and create a wiki page as per our instructions on email. We will have email instructions predating the edits and then invoices of payments. So we will be able to prove that Wikipedia India is corrupt\n\nOur plan got changed along the way because we realized that Wikipedia relies heavily on publicly available news links and without them it is impossible to edit a page. So, it was decided to remove unwanted edits from the newly created page and keep only the favorable edits\n\nAs decided, we paid 10K to an agency to create a page of a male actor. Both me and my friend shared the amount. The total cost of creating and keeping the page for six months was 50K. The agency demanded an annual contract of 30K for keeping the page up and purge unwanted edits\n\nWe learnt that Wikipedia is a deceptive place. Nobody can go and edit a page as they like. You can edit a page but "they" reverse your edits if they don\'t like them. A gang of about 50 Indian editors are on top of a chain of editors and they have complete control over Wikipedia\n\nThe top 50 editors are mostly from IT companies with much free time on their hands and they are on Wiki the whole day. They are on top of a chain of command. A team consists of about 10 editors. A newbie proposes an edit and a chain of command approves it and further edits it.\n\nThe top editors are all anonymous and have enormous power because Google algorithm always rewards Wikipedia as the top page on Search. Google changes its algorithm frequently but they used to heavily favor Wiki because it is an open source, publicly edited charity platform\n\nWikipedia gets its reflected glory from Google which translates into business for these editors Here\'s a payment structure for these Wiki editors in the command chain: 1. Top Editor: 30% (one) 2. Senior editor: 25% 3. Mid editor: 15% 4. Young editor: 10% 5. Agency: 20%\n\nFor 2 months we kept on adding favorable edits to a page based on frivolous press releases. Anybody working with Bollywood actors know about such PR hangouts which contain favourable but innocuous information, like the news of an unknown award or bring a youth icon etc\n\n\n\nSome flop films were turned into average or semi-hits at the box office. All the information edited were complimentary &amp; showed the page in good light. Every time the top editors approved the edits and they were never reversed. Even if somebody reversed it, they were brought back\n\nWe got a lot of info. \n\n1. The top editors make about 5 lakhs(500,000) every month as "consultants". \n\n2. The agencies make about 3 lakh(300,000)  per month. \n\n3. Students are enrolled as interns and may later on become mid-level editors. Wikipedia is a big business opportunity, hence tightly controlled\n\nThe Wikipedia editors ensure that all money is properly accounted for and it is electronically transferred. Tax is paid on the income as consultants. But nowhere do they mention Wikipedia anywhere. It\'s all projected as IT related consultation of an Ad agency or a PR agency.\n\n\nThere is a major difference between media &amp; Wikipedia. Here most editors mask their identity. So, it\'s difficult to figure who\'s attacking you. You might be a professor with a PhD on the subject but a first year student will reverse your edits if he\'s higher in the hierarchy\n\nHow does a Wiki editor climb up the ladder? Ans: It takes years to climb up the hierarchy. Wikipedia gives you badges, stars etc in recognition of your work. You won\'t get promotions unless you have the tacit support of the "gang" There is a very well-known process here\n\nTo climb up the hierarchy on Wikipedia, your edits needs to "stick". If your edits get reversed or deleted frequently then Wikipedia understands that you are not a talent. This is the game that is played on the platform. If they want you out, they will reverse your edits.\n\nPicture this: You do a lot of research to edit a page on Wikipedia. Backed with data, you edit the article on Wikipedia only to find that it has been reversed the next day. Imagine this happening to you frequently. Day after day. You get frustrated and angry. Right?\n\nThis is the why new editors have left Wikipedia out of frustration. What is the point of research and editing articles if they get deleted? Wikipedia has a system where you can "Talk" to your "seniors" about why your edits have disappeared. This is where the bullying happens.\n\nThere are these "Talk" pages where you can ask why your edits have been deleted. These pages are public and the language is monitored. It is here that the senior editors will bully you by clever usage of words. They\'ll tell you that your edits were "pretty pointless" or "vague"\n\nYou have the liberty of re-editing or seeking help from someone else but the bullies who are trying to block your edits, will patrol your Talk pages to figure out who you are talking to and what are you saying. If they find you intimidating, they will try to block you permanently\n\nAs Wikipedia attaches a lot of importance to citations, they attack your citations from publicly available sources. These editors ensure by one method or the other that their narrative on a particular page does not change. This is mainly the case with political pages.\n\nIt\'s interesting to note that there are many Bengali and Malayali senior editors on Wikipedia who have been editing Wikipedia pages for years. They\'re staunch Leftists and their job is ensure that Wikipedia doesn\'t say nice things about non-left personalities and media\n\nHow do they vilify pages? Well that\'s another interesting thing. For personalities, they will highlight their flaws. For example, create a separate section for an unverified allegation levelled against him just by citing a newspaper report. But for others, they would ignore it\n\nFor people who are known to have anti-left views, the attacks get more vicious. They scour the internet for publicly available articles that show you in bad light. Once they get such an article, a new editor will edit and the senior editors will ensure that it sticks to the page\n\nIt\'s interesting how they organise the malicious edits. They will form a team. Usually such teams are formed on secret chat rooms outside of Wikipedia. They will ensure that the edits come from different locations. So it\'s impossible to figure out that it\'s a coordinated attack\n\nIf seniors from Virginia, Kolkata, Vietnam, Karachi &amp; Mumbai are saying the same thing about an article, then the edit sticks. No matter how much you try, you will not be able to modify it. Everytime new senior editors will come and block you from editing or will reverse the edit\n\n\nThread is becoming too long but I will finish what I started. I could never write the article &amp; had to leave it half way. Reasons: * The actor didn\'t give us written consent * My friend quit because the agency was asking for more money * The editor didn\'t sound too excited either\n \nI witnessed a positive change in the actor\'s online profile as Enthusiastic Wiki editors added more information and expanded the Wiki page. His Twitter profile got verified as Twitter apparently considers Wikipedia as a credible signal to decide if an user should be verified\n\nI noticed a dramatic shift in the online presence of the actor. He became more active on social media &amp; hired a PR firm to plant stories about him in the media. By this time, he has understood that if mainstream media publishes anything, Wiki editors will include it on Wiki page.\n\nI understood the enormous clout of Wikipedia in establishing an online image as it is the 1st page on Google search. This Wikipedia page makes or breaks your online image. So, I continued my research on the side about how editors rise up the ladder to the top of the command chain\nEditors start off with pages that align with their core interests (pages on cricket, medicine, IT). Then they go on to create pages of an ongoing news: Like #CoronaOutbreak. These pages are factual and aren\'t controversial. But they establish you as an editor whose edits stick.\n\nWikipedia seniors notice your contributions and start participating on your TALK pages, guiding you and basically trying to figure out who you are and what you are. 90% of these editors are anonymous. Wikipedia knows your IP address and maintains the log of every activity.\n\nAfter a few months, you start gaining more "rights" on Wikipedia. In an year or so, you become an important member of the community. You have also made friends with seniors and they consider you a friendly. This is time. Now you turn your sights on the controversial pages.\n\n the time to start vandalising the pages of personalities that you don\'t like. It can be a film star or a director or a political activist. Usually the A-listers are protected. Like you cannot vandalise Narendra Modi\'s page or Shah Rukh Khan\'s page. The seniors won\'t allow\n\nHere are the usual victims of the Wiki editor mafia: 1. Moderately famous personalities including politicians and people with strong political views 2. New Media houses (Like @OpIndia_com) 3. Bollywood actors 4. Communal events (#DelhiRiots) 5. Terms (eg Hindutva or #JaiShriRam)\n\nAs I said, Wikipedia editors come from various backgrounds but most of the seniors have a strong bias against anti-left narrative. BJP leaders, personalities who publicly support Narendra Modi and those who speak in favour of majority Hindus often have derogatory edits approved.\n\n\nPlease remember: My study pertained to Indian Wikipedia pages only. But the same pattern is seen across Wikipedia. Wikipedia Editing is actually a game of citations from publicly available sources. The hidden cheat sheet is approving the citations that align with your narrative.\n\nWikipedia is aware of this and has installed checks &amp; balances to prevent biased behaviour among its editors. Example: There are Arbitration Forums where you can confront senior editors and any matter may be escalated to the top editors: The Moderators Let me talk about them now.\n\nThe Moderators are people who have the final say in Talk pages about what edits would stick and what wouldn\'t. Then there are Administrators who are like an Editor-in-Chief of a Media house. They have ultimate powers. Currently there are 1,144 administrators of English Wikipedia\n\nThere is documented proof about how a Wikipedia Moderator was a corrupt person. Wikipedia had to ban the user because it was proven that he was running a mafia syndicate to favour a business house. Wikipedia apologised after the user was outed. \n\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/2015/04/03/manipulating-wikipedia-promote-bogus-business-school-316133.html\n\nThe obvious question is: what are Wikipedia bosses doing about this? The answer is: Nothing! They can\'t digest the fact that their creation is slowly becoming a monster and has started altering history and promoting biased narratives. Like a mother who thinks her son is the best!\n\nNot many know that Wikipedia has carefully added a disclaimer admitting that their platform is biased! Wikipedia also goes on to justify how and where the bias creeps in. But they are silent about what mechanisms they are installing to stop that bias.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Systemic_bias\n\nNot only does ideological bias and bullying exist on Wikipedia. There has been many cases of sexual harassment and targeted gender harassment on Wikipedia. Female editors have been harassed by the gangs of male editors. Here is a documented case from 2015. \n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/10/how-wikipedia-is-hostile-to-women/411619/\n\n\nThe problem with Wikipedia is: They do nothing about the ills that exist on their platform. Though Wikipedia\'s founder Jimmy Wales continuously defends Wikipedia and says how great the platform is. Co-Founder Larry Sanger has gone on record about Wikipedia\'s biased narrative\n\nA proponent of neutrality and a PhD in Philosophy, Sanger worked with Jimmy to found Wikipedia in 2001. He has left Wiki because he didn\'t approve of the way Wikipedia was evolving. Again Jimmy Wales did nothing to correct course. Jimmy doesn\'t listen\nhttps://evolutionnews.org/2017/12/wikipedia-co-founder-calls-wikipedia-entry-on-intelligent-design-appallingly-biased/\n\n\nA prominent criticism of Wiki is its gender gap and unfair targeting of women public figures, eg, women of colour. Here\'s a case study of how a scientist\'s page kept on disappearing from Wikipedia and the battle to restore it. There are many such cases. \n\nhttps://www.chemistryworld.com/news/female-scientists-pages-keep-disappearing-from-wikipedia-whats-going-on/3010664.article\n\nWikipedia has done nothing to check their platform of biases that come in many forms: political narrative, gender, historical perspective, religion etc Most complaints have emerged from Jimmy Wales\' own country. But he has always praised his creation. \n\n[credit](https://twitter.com/Soumyadipta)'<br />Author: '10100011a10100011a'  id: 'g3s0io'<br />Score:105<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g3s0io/wikipedia_india_is_corruptbais_and_misogynistic/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'CORONA - Indian Govt - Lockdown Population Ration and some thoughts'<br />Body: '  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDear Friends, \n\nI have been lucky to be in home and able to stock groceries and vegetables and also have WFH facility and get paid, but not everyone has the same situation. Most dailywagers and migrants have been heavily affected by this and even the Govt seems unaware of what to do, I don’t blame the Govt as they are not supposed to be prepared for this, still they seem to be doing their best. \n\nI have some thoughts on following points and need your inputs: \n\nI have a bad habit of linking Population with everything and I have strong thoughts that Govt cant do anything to cater to the huge population of India especially in the poorer strata of society. The following are the biggest hinderances for the Govt to work or provide relief material to all citizens: \n\n· Fucking huge population which is growing day by day. \n\n· Inadequate manpower in Govt services and lack of requirement in those Depts. \n\n· Corruption in whatever schemes Govt implements. \n\n· Tax Evasion done by maximum people, only salaried people do contribute to taxes, only when all citizens contribute the Govt will have funds. \n\nI have been watching all sorts of news on TV, see various twitter trends wherein the reporter interviews migrant labourers who are walking because they were unaware of lockdown and they didn’t have any transport and they were hungry no food to feed them, and every couple had 5-7 fucking kids, and other NGO and private trusts were doing such charity by feeding them. A middle class family itself thinks one kid is enough as the cost of bringing a kid is very high and these people are blindly going on procreating and Govt does nothing. Literally all our tax money goes in feeding them and then roads get potholes and other facilities are affected.\n\nNGO / Private Institutions doing Charity: I have always been against such feeding of people even during normal times, there are lots of institutions who keep on feeding people even before lockdown and this gives them confidence that we will get free food so lets keep on having kids. There should always be some thinking to be done before doing any charity, but these NGOS are collecting huge amounts and using part to feed poor and taking photos / videos making it viral on internet and get more funds. These results in : \n\n· NGO getting name / fame and further funds \n\n· Its Govt responsibility to feed the Citizens, when such NGO s start doing Govt duty Govt officers divert the ration to corrupt people and further make situation worse. \n\n· The NGO should not be roaming on roads and feeding anyone whom they understand to be poor, even if im going on road to buy groceries they may feel I am hungry and give me a food packet, such “freebies” should stop.\n\n· All these NGO im saying is against Humans I will support organisations like blue cross or other organisations giving food to cows or stray dogs or any animal, because animals don’t demand and always will be grateful. \n\nWe don’t know how Corona will end and we are bunch of emotional people who bang thalis and light lots of diyas, but practically speaking all these things wont help us to fight Corona. We need a major revolution in India and the reforms which is stated above need to be implemented.

      <li>Title::: 'Pazhassi Raja - The Lion of Kerala #3'<br />Body: "**Resistance to British rule**\n\nPazhassi Raja resisted British imperialism from 1793 onwards till his death in 1805. He fought two wars to resist British intervention in the domestic affairs of his kingdom. From 1793–1797 he fought over the rule of Kottayam and from 1800–1805 over the issue of who will be the ruler of Wayanad. **British called their wars with Pazhassi Raja Ji as Cotiote War.** The British offered rewards for information about the whereabouts of Pazhassi Raja (3000 pagodas), Vira Varma Raja (1000 pagodas), and Ravi Varma Raja (1000 pagodas).\n\n**First Revolt against British rule**\n\nPazhassi Raja was not on good terms with his uncle Vira Varma. **In 1793, foxy Vira Varma who had surrendered Kottayam to British back in 1792, convinced British Commissioners to let him collect tax in Kottayam.** He calculated that a good collection might please the British and that that would let him seize all of Kottayam. Needless to say, Pazhassi Raja was angry at this British move. He felt betrayed. After all, he was the only Raja in Northern Malabar to have helped the British consistently in the war with Mysore.\n\nVira Varma was a real crook – on the one hand, he undertook to collect tax in Kottayam directly and on the other hand, he instigated Pazhassi Raja to oppose the **British. Moreover, the British tax on the kingdom was harsh and beyond the peasants' capacity to pay. They resisted its forcible collection by the agents of the British, and Pazhassi Raja took up their cause**. Raja Ji was deadly opposed to extortion of the peasantry.\n\nIn 1793, Pazhassi Raja Ji made sure that no tax was collected in Kottayam by the British – as a mark of his protest. He also threatened that if British officials did not give up their enumeration of pepper vines, he would have the vines destroyed. Local British authorities, however, debated with Raja Ji and soon both discovered Vira Varma’s dirty games. So the British put forward a solution acceptable to the Raja Ji by which 20 percent of gross revenue would go to Raja Ji and another 20 percent would go for the temples' expense. No tax would be imposed on temple property in the immediate future.\n\nIn 1793, Tipu’s Vakils (Heir of Tipu Sultan) protested to the British that Pazhassi Raja, who was a British tributary, had overrun most of Wayanad, still under Mysore. Soon the Raja Ji was supreme in the Wayanad Plateau.\n\nBut the Governor-General unwisely revoked the agreement in 1794 and gave Kottayam to **Vira Varma** (who at the time was the King of Kurumbranad) on a five-year lease. The Raja Ji was truly angry at this decision and decided to retaliate by ruling his country as per customary law. The year before the lease was concluded the Raja Ji had provided asylum to a Nayar noble, Narangoli Nambiar belonging to the Iruvazinad royal clan, who had been declared an outlaw by British for the murder of three men who had killed his kinsman. **The Raja Ji’s kind treatment of Nambiar irritated the British. The British also became angry that the Raja Ji impaled two robbers as per customary law. British planned to arrest Raja Ji for 'murder' but gave up the idea as the Raja Ji had a bodyguard of 500 well-armed Wayanad Nayars.**\n\n**In 1795, even after a year, Vira Varma got Kottayam on a lease, he was not able to collect tax in Kottayam-thanks to his nephew Raja Ji’s determination.** So British troops arrived in Kottayam to help Vira Varma’s tax collectors, but Pazhassi Raja Ji’s men resisted them with success.\n\nIn 1796, orders were issued from Bombay to collect tax arrears for 2 years in Kottayam. For British no more pretexts were needed to arrest Raja Ji. 300 men under Lieutenant James Gordon marched from Talassery and seized Raja Ji’s fortified the Raja Ji's house. But Raja Ji fled four days earlier to the nearby village of Manattana \\[near Kottiyur\\]. Gordon plundered the palace where the traditional treasure of Raja Ji was kept. Raja Ji was angry at this loot and sent a letter to Supervisor at Talassery.\n\nRaja Ji was also angry that one of his former general named Pazhayamviden Chandu had become an agent of Vira Varma and what angered him even more than that was that this turn-coat dared to boss him with Vira Varma’s and British blessings. Raja Ji shifted his HQ to Purali Range and then into Wayanad. Raja Ji then blocked all British communications between Wayanad and Low Malabar through Kuttiyadi Pass. The British retaliated by cutting all communications between Raja Ji and Low Malabar. But as they did not have enough troops to chase him they waited for reinforcements.\n\nThe British commandant was Colonel Dow, whom Raja Ji knew well during Siege of Thalassery. So Raja Ji thought that this old friend might help him mediate with the British government. Raja Ji offered to give up the struggle provided he was pardoned and his treasure and house restored. The Colonel and Raja Ji being old soldiers hated needless bloodshed and so he forwarded Raja Ji’s request to Commissioners, who thought they were bitterly opposed to Raja’s independent style, agreed to the Colonel’s suggestion as there was a risk that Raja might ally with Tipu.\n\nSo Northern Superintendent ordered the restoration of the Raja Ji's house but did not restored the treasure, and the Raja Ji's pardon was confirmed by the Bombay and Supreme Governments. But the orders of government were communicated to the Raja Ji via Vira Varma – Vira Varma did not report this to his nephew that the British had agreed to his requests. **Vira Varma had a vested interest in the war between the Company and his nephew Pazhassi Raja.**\n\nVira Varma also removed Kaitheri Ambu, a favourite noble and general of Raja Ji, from home administration of Kottayam. Ambu along with followers went to, where he planned and executed a mass resistance with people’s support, which made sure that Vira Varma could make no tax collection in Kottayam. But Ambu acted clearly on the guidance of Raja, who felt expulsion of Ambu was another of his uncle’s conspiracies to undermine him.\n\nNot knowing that their truce terms were kept blocked from him by his uncle, Raja Ji thought that British planned to seize him and retreated into depths of Wayanad. British troop build up in Wayanad also accelerated his doubts. However, Raja was still eager to avoid a war and came to meet Northern Superintendent with a bodyguard of 1500 armed Nayars. Vira Varma was also ordered to be present. Pazhassi Raja Ji’s main demand was that Kottayam must be under his rule-a demand his uncle was not ready to accede.\n\nBritish Commissioners' attitude also was arrogant-they were already prejudiced towards Raja Ji and so were blind towards Raja Ji’s logical argument that Vira Varma had no business in Kottayam. As talks broke down, **British Commissioners' issued a threat proclamation in Kottayam that if those Kottayam men in service of Raja Ji does not desert him and come home, they would be declared enemies and their properties would be confiscated. But this proclamation had little effect in Kottayam where resistance to British-Kurumbranad rule became stronger.**\n\nBritish, to their horror, found out that a large number of Vira Varma’s troops had deserted to join ranks of resisters and Vira Varma himself was not much interested to help British-after all his aim was to create a flare-up between his nephew and British for sake of pure self-interest.\n\nRaja Ji then visited Mysorean commandant at Karkankotta in 1796 and in 1797 held an audience with old enemy Tipu. **Tipu who at the time was working with the French saw this as a good opportunity to weak the British forces** posted 6000 men at Karkankotta to aid Raja Ji in case of war and also to supply ammunition to rebels. He also began to collect troops and armament. War was imminent. 1200 troops and artillery under Major General was sent by Bombay Government to deal with Pazhassi. British also began to set up outposts in Kottayam and sent more troops to Wayanad.\n\nIn early 1797, Nayar militia rose all over Kottayam and British outposts were trapped in a true state of siege. Partisan bands became active all over Kottayam and harassed reinforcements and supply convoys. Same was the case in Wayanad where British troops that moved out of the safety of block-houses risked being way-laid by Kurichia bowmen. **British suffered a good loss in terms of men, ammunition and stores in these ambuscades.**\n\n**Victory at Periya Pass**\n\nThis event was the most important in the whole war. **In 1797, Colonel Dow &amp; force marches into Wayanad.** He planned to block Periya Pass and then crush a large rebel force in Kannoth once their retreat is blocked.\n\nReinforcements under Lieutenant Mealy were to reach Dow at Periya, but on way, they were severely harassed by a force of Nayars and Kurichias and suffered a casualty of 105 men. So instead of Periya, they retreated to their original base.\n\nDow’s troops suffered a chronic shortage of supplies and so Dow applied for reinforcements and re-supplies to be sent under Major Anderson of Bowles' regiment. But as Mappila guides of Anderson deserted at last moment. That caused a delay in the journey of Anderson-a delay that had a fatal consequence for the British.\n\n**Dow then received news that Tipu had sent sepoys to aid Raja Ji as Tipu considered British entry into Wayanad a violation of Seringapatam Pact. Dow decided that he will go to Talassery to consult authorities there and to plan a greater operation to deal with troops of Raja Ji and Tipu simultaneously in Wayanad.** He left with a small band of men but was ambushed on way by Raja Ji’s men aided by Mysorean sepoys but Dow escaped unhurt.\n\n**Day after he left, a British force of 1100 under Major Cameroon in Periya decided to descend into Kottayam via Periya Pass as their supplies have exhausted.**\n\nBut what they did not know was that Raja Ji who learnt of the true state of British army laid a trap for them-he ordered troops lay concealed in camouflaged stockades built on both sides of the pass. Once the whole British force entered the narrow pass, hidden troops were to pounce on their enemy who must be caught unawares.\n\nThe plan worked well and what followed was a great slaughter of British. Had it not been for the arrival of Major Anderson’s force the following day, hardly any would have survived due to lack of medical care. Most of the enemy were killed and all their guns, ammunition, baggage and cattle were plundered along with Union colours. Senior British officers like Major Cameroon, Lieutenant Nugent, Lieutenant Madge and Lieutenant Rudderman were killed in action.\n\nAround this time, Commissioners took a decision on the advice of Swaminatha Pattar, a Tamil Brahmin who was minister of Zamorin that sowed the eventual downfall of Pazhassi Raja Ji. They decided to raise an irregular force of local traitors to harass Pazhassi Raja. This force was a forerunner of the infamous Kolkar, who became infamous for their sycophancy to British and cruelty to resisters and people.\n\nA brief introduction to Swaminatha Pattar-He is an arch rogue who helped to consolidate British rule in Calicut. Though he was Zamorin's representative to British, he betrayed his master and worked secretly to deliver the kingdom of Calicut to British. Ravi Varma who led resistance to Hyder Ali and Tippu Sultan became so furious at this betrayal that he along with his nephews tried to assassinate him in 1793. But the attempt failed and British arrested Ravi Varma who had fled to Wayanad to join hands with Pazhassi Raja. Ravi Varma and his nephews were imprisoned and died in mysterious circumstances – believed to be poisoned by authorities. What impact would the death of Ravi Varma of Calicut made of Pazhassi Raja is anyone's guess, but it is likely that his fear and suspicion of British only shot up after these events in Calicut in 1793.\n\nBut for time being, Raja Ji was in a strong position. On account of British disasters, Bombay Government sent a Committee of Government composed of men of highest ranks-Commander-In-Chief Lieutenant-General Stuart and Governor Jonathan Duncan. They decided to make peace as they were anxious that guerrilla warfare in a mountainous and forested terrain could last long and that Raja Ji might join forces with Tipu or French. They also decided that Vira Varma should be ousted form administration of Kottayam. Rajas of Chirakkal and Parappanad acted as mediators in negotiation between Raja and British and a peace pact was signed between Pazhassi and British in 1797.\n\nThe Treaty of 1797 agreed on the following points:\n\n1. Pazhassi Raja Ji was to be 'pardoned'.\n2. He will be returned his treasure.\n3. He will be provided with an annual allowance of 8000 rupees.\n4. He will be given back his confiscated house at Pazhassi.\n5. Ravi Varma, elder brother of Pazhassi Raja Ji will be head of Kottayam.\n6. A pardon and restoration of the property were also extended to Narangoli Nambiar of Iruvazinad.\n\nThus Raja Ji’s efforts of four years ended in a political victory. Peace dawned after four years of antagonism and war.\n\nTipu Sultan in his letter to French government notes with glee that the British had lost 1,000 European soldiers and 3,000 native sepoys in four years of war between British troops and Kottayam army\n\n*Please feel free to Correct if any mistake is found.

Specifically MBA.'<br />Body: "Tldr; Appeared for CAT(98.3) this year, getting rejected from colleges due to poor performance in interviews (poor social skills and acads). Questions in the bottom of the post.\n\n\n\nSo let me give a bit of a background first. I'm a 26 year old, general engineering male (GEM) candidate who has had poor past academics. Scored 88 in 10th, 66 in 12th, 60 in under graduation. In addition to that I had two year gaps in my engineering. Now before you come to any conclusion that I'm stupid or something, let me also mention that I was going through depression and did not study at all after 11th. It was only after 3rd year of engineering (2017) that I came out of it and managed to get things a little bit on track. Even getting overall 60% in UG was a huge ask but I managed that. Because 60% and 65% are some benchmarks used by colleges and recruiters.\n\nI was ineligible for placements during my engineering and was not allowed to sit for any company because I had &lt;60 at the time of recruitments. I managed to get to 60 only in the last exam at which time companies weren't coming for recruitment. So I wanted to go for higher education and took a year gap to study for GATE. Unfortunately I didn't do good enough and managed only 40/100. Was very down after this and didn't know what to do. At this time I had also given cat and scored 88%ile. I gave interviews for KJ Somaiya and Welingkar but wasn't selected. After talking to a lot of people I decided to go prepare for CAT one more year and give it my all.\n\nFast forward to CAT 2019. I scored 98.3%ile in CAT and 94%ile in XAT. Also shortlisted for IIFT. Messed up SNAP and missed the cutoff of NMIMS Mumbai by one mark. Anyway, I had applied to a whole lot of colleges, most of the top 40-45 colleges. I have already given most of the interviews, apart from a few which are most probably gonna scrap the interviews due to Corona. \n\nMy concerns start from here. I did not manage to do good enough in interviews and group discussions. My main problem being poor social skills and stage fear. Even after a lot of practice I could only manage an average performance. Now the results are rolling out and I've realized how awful my performance in these was.\n\nI wasn't selected for the PGDM program for IMT Ghaziabad, but was offered their Dual Country Program (which costs over 26lacs). Also got rejected by IMI New Delhi and IIM Rohtak. I have given interviews for new and baby IIMs, Nitie, MDI, IIFT and await their results.\n\nMy questions to you-\n1) Should I go for IMT DCP( one year in Dubai, one year in Ghaziabad)? Points to be considered- average placement 13lpa, total fees over 26lacs, total batch size 500-600\n2a)  If I go for it, how should I prepare myself before the course begins so I get an advantage in placements?\n2b)  If I don't go for it, what could be my alternatives, considering getting a job is extremely tough in this environment?\n3) Apart from all this, what should I do to become a better professional? What resources can I make use of?"<br />Author: 'para97k'  id: 'g356wm'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g356wm/need_help_regarding_my_career_specifically_mba/</li>

What example has been given to explain the same ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material elements remain unmanifested before creation. From this subtle state of unmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth becomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take place. Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth. When it is dismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in the ultimate stage. The law of conservation of energy remains, but in course of time things are manifested and unmanifested—that is the difference. Then what cause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are not lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain unmanifested, and only in the middle are they manifested, and this does not make any real material difference."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 2.28, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/za882c0ahet41.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf957fe5de53095cac3f34bec7d49d041c0c16ab\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

Our ancient political thinkers didn’t randomly make politics subservient to civilization and culture—it was the result of deep, sustained philosophical reflection on the nature of things and the nature of fundamental human impulses itself.\n\nBut most importantly, our ancients set real and workable limits to the boundaries of politics by prescribing a restraint known as Dharma. However, it can be argued that democracy as it has evolved over the centuries up to the present time has ensured that politics has indeed become all-pervasive to the extent that it continues to be one of the most dominant features in our lives without our own conscious knowledge.\n\nThis is extremely unhealthy to put it mildly. And it’s also exactly what philosopher-statesmen like the legendary D V Gundappa had clairvoyantly realized, proclaimed, and warned against on numerous occasions: that the Western style of democracy must be adopted in India with great caution because this land and its people took inspiration, ideal and lifestyle from the heartbeat of a far profounder sort. But DVG’s words were largely unheeded by the powers that be. Yet again, such voices of wisdom, moderation, reason and balance were lost like plaintive cries in the forest.\n\nHow the Congress Party has Surrendered to the Breaking India Forces Also Read Commemorating Rishi DVG: The Forest-Flower Whose Fragrance Teaches us the Dharma and Yoga of Life One glance at the state of Western democracies today and the honest person will correctly conclude that they are broken beyond repair. Hate Trump if you must—and for the right reasons—but don’t ignore the political system that has reached such a point that he actually won the top spot. Or the even worse alternative, a political system that would have made Hillary Clinton the president. The condition of Europe is far worse to say the least.\n\nJosef Stalin Josef Stalin Or look at it another way. In a democracy which is essentially a game of numbers, it is only a matter of time before the system morphs into a sickening and dangerous race to the bottom. Argument, disagreement, debate, and that new weasel word, “dissent”—all of these will last until the said race begins. What “debate” can you have with someone like Pinarayi Vijayan? And how can you “dissent” with someone like Mamta Banerjee?\n\nAnd folks like Pinarayi, Mamta, Mayawati, Karunanidhi, Jayalalithaa…are merely creations, the embodiments of the original evil strain that mutated horribly out of control.\n\nCommunism.\n\nWhich in itself is the vilest combination and incarnation of the worst elements of both the Abrahamic cults. The specific details apart, Communism is as life-negating as Islam and Christianity. It needs to be repeated: the three have wiped out entire civilizations and cultures on an industrial scale across the globe. Repeatedly.\n\nIt doesn’t matter what it is called: socialism, Marxism, communism, collectivism, Left, Far-Left, Extreme Left…these are merely external labels that really don’t mean anything concrete, positive or life-affirming. At best, a discussion of these terminologies is meaningless hair-splitting.\n\nAnd the Vedantic genius lies precisely in piercing this external veil of surface intellectualism and placing one’s finger on the pulse of what animates and propels these “isms.” Unless we rediscover and recover this original Indian felicity, we’ll continue to be akin to a dog chasing its own tail. Never forget: Sanatana Dharma is the last man standing.\n\nIt is for this reason that I mentioned earlier that an unhealthy obsession with political and ideological developments on the part of the proverbial common man will alter and distort matters of civilization and make his daily life purposeless, joyless and vacuous.\n\nWe cannot have an enduring political system in India by sacrificing the civilisation of Bharatavarsha. If you try doing that, you’ll end up destroying both—this has been the lived experience of the last seventy years. There’s just no other way of saying this so I’ll say it candidly: even in the realm of well-meaning and sincere Hindu activism, what is being actually sought is for retrieving some valuable scraps buried underneath the expansive wreckage of Sanatana civilization and culture. Or in the memorable words of that fine contemplative writer and scholar, Aravindan Neelakandan, for the last seventy years, “the Indian state has been waging war against the Hindu nation.” It’s worth quoting Aravindan at some length simply it makes my job easy, of setting the context:\n\nStalin was perhaps the most notorious mass-murderer in human history. Yet Jawaharlal Nehru, who projected himself as the paragon of democracy, went into raptures in his eulogy of this mass murderer… Nehruvian infatuation with totalitarian Marxism creates a situation where Indian education becomes colonized by Marxism… The Indian state was taken over by the Nehruvians and they have kept the Indian nation barely alive to serve their purpose. The consequences are all too visible.\n\nTo put it bluntly, the last six years have witnessed the Nehruvian Indian National Congress party shed its clothes one by one and stand naked as the political face of Breaking India forces.\n\nThis essay narrates the story of how it happened.\n\nPresent Continuous Consider the person who supposedly heads the Congress party today. Don’t lie. The very thought of mentioning the name of that person made you laugh involuntarily. Now consider—nay, imagine even the notion of this person occupying the chair of the Prime Minister of India. Now consider a very real probability: whether this person is actually fully in control of the Congress. Or whether he has become a mere puppet in the hands of his various handlers.\n\nOn the Brink of Extinction Two random news reports are a good place to begin.\n\nThe first is the big revelation that erupted sometime last year: the exposure of senior Congress leader and lapsed mentor of Rahul Gandhi, Digvijaya Singh’s alleged links with the breaking India group, Elgar Parishad. Digvijaya Singh also happens to be the former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh. Let that sink in.\n\nThe second occurred during the same period when Rahul Gandhi met the ultra-fanatical veteran Maoist and advocate of armed war against the Indian state, Gummadi Vittal Rao or Gaddar. This is what transpired:\n\nGaddar… expressed his wish to fight assembly election against “fascist and feudal forces… If all the political parties which are opposing KCR in the real sense come together then, I definitely will contest against KCR as an independent candidate…” Maintaining that Rahul has given a clarion call for saving the Constitution and save India, he further said that “I have also given slogan ‘save the Constitution.’ And this is barely scratching the surface. When even a new entrant like the TRS has to spurn the Congress thereby pushing Rahul Gandhi into the arms of someone like Gaddar, it shows just how close to extinction the Congress party has come. Even a Kanhaiya Kumar wants to contest the 2019 elections on a CPI ticket. Equally, there’s not a single intellectual or thinker of any serious talent or depth in the party. The best it can boast of is Shashi Tharoor, who seems to be permanently stuck in a time warp, treating politics akin to the debating halls and podiums of the St. Stephens elocution society. Think about it: today, there’s not a single person of any consequence in the Congress who knows Indian history, our native culture, epics, traditions, heroes, and even the names of our Deities.\n\nHow the Congress Party has Surrendered to the Breaking India Forces The gist of a long story is just this: after losing nearly thirty elections under Rahul Gandhi’s “leadership,” the Congress is no longer fighting for political relevance, it’s fighting for survival while its ideological battles are being fought by Communists. It doesn’t matter what you call them: urban Naxals, Naxals, Maoists, liberals, left-liberals, and not to forget, the global nexus of the breaking India forces.\n\nThis combined cabal has taken over the Congress party. And their coveted and ultimate prize is not the Congress party but Bharatavarsha.\n\nPast Tense the government has put on a performance worthy of the best gangster tradition in politics…it has launched a new unprincipled era in Indian politics. The word “leader” has assumed menacing proportion…It denotes personal rule with all dangers inherent therein. That was Nayantara Sahgal writing in the Sunday Standard in 1969 about her cousin Indira Gandhi who had just split the Indian National Congress. On her part, Indira Gandhi retaliated in a breathtaking display of pettiness by barring Nayantara Sahgal and her mother, Vijayalakshmi Pandit, entry into Anand Bhavan, her Maika.\n\nForty-five years later, the same Nayantara Sahgal would issue a similar statement against incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the eve of the Congress-sponsored charade called Award Wapsi.\n\n..[as a result of the split, the Congress] party…degenerated into an unaudited company for winning elections. [It became] a simple mechanism for collecting funds, distributing “tickets” or nominations for seats, conducting campaigns.\n\nThat was Sunil Khilnani, author of the mischievous tome titled, Idea of India, and a prominent worshipper of Amartya Sen. Needless, the numerous assaults of the legislature that occurred during the disastrous two-term UPA rule have been committed under the cloak and flag of the selfsame “idea of India,” (or IOI as fine bloggers like Reality Check India have aptly castigated it). The daggers have been the deadly socialist nuclear bombs like RTE, Food Security Bill, MNREGA, and similar communist experiments of social engineering that became law.\n\nBut the roots of the Congress party’s aforementioned takeover by the breaking India forces lie—as always—in the person of Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nThe Daughter’s Letter But while Nehru merely drenched himself in the poison of communism, Indira Gandhi actually swam in its treacherous waters, befriending the toxic sharks. For a good reason. Indeed, during her formative years, the extent of her fascination and fondness for the Far Left, left even her father stunned.\n\nIndira was only warming to her main theme. She reminded Nehru of how right-wing Finnish forces led by Baron Mannerheim had…slaughtered 15,000 communists. ‘This is the democracy…world imperialism is aiding.’ …. [Harold] Laski and Nehru’s other admirers in London had misjudged Indira. She was more than a pale reflection of her father. In this letter, she takes a position considerably to the left of Nehru…\n\nBut just how sophisticated…Indira’s left-wing, communist-leaning sympathies were is unclear. She was greatly influenced by Feroze [Gandhi} and his radical friends in London, many of whom were communists. The intelligentsia’s disaffection with…Stalin had certainly begun in 1939, but it was not shared by all those on the left. Indira, like many in the India League circle, still looked to the Soviet Union, even in the wake of Stalin’s show trials and the Nazi-Soviet pact…Stalin’s Soviet Union seemed the only alternative. A good many fellow-travellers and sympathisers remained loyal to the USSR, and ‘the prestige – and the gullibility – of Western intellectuals were considerable assets to Stalin.’ [Indira—The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi: Katherine Frank, pp.154-55. Emphasis added.]\n\nIndira Gandhi wrote that letter in 1940.\n\nA Government of Usurpers Two events might be considered as significant turning points in the post-1947 history of the Congress party.\n\nThe first was the vile Avadi session of 1955, which definitively altered the face, and permanently changed the course of the Congress party towards softcore Communism alias socialism. This was preceded by the Congress party’s manifesto of the 1952 elections, which read:\n\nIt is not possible to pursue a policy of laissez-faire in industry…. It is incompatible with any planning. It has long been Congress policy that basic industries should be owned or controlled by the state. This policy holds and must be progressively given effect to. State trading should be undertaken wherever the balance of advantage lies in favour of such a course. A large field for private enterprise is, however, left over…But the private sector must accept the objective of the National Plan and fit into it. [Emphasis added]\n\nIndeed, Nehru was able to get away with this brazen manifesto precisely because Sardar Patel had been dead by then. It is this heedless and disastrous socialist tilt that made the venerable JRD Tata remark that “Jawahar was foolish.”\n\nA former communist, Philip Spratt correctly diagnosed the long-term dangers that the Avadi Congress resolution posed for India.\n\nNehru’s Communism is revealed in the extraordinary favour he shows to the Communist Party….He allows the Russian Government, and apparently the Chinese too, to subsidise them. It has been admitted in Parliament that the Home Department knows about some of these foreign funds. No other ruler in the world tolerates this kind of thing. Why does Nehru? … Ten years ago (1953) the Congress Party was by no means socialistic. When the resolution on the socialistic patter was passed at Avadi, an important Congressman compared it to Akbar’s Din Ilahi. Socialism, he said is Nehru’s personal fad, which will quickly be forgotten when he passes from the scene. It seemed a shrewd judgment at the time, but it overlooked the attraction of socialism for a ruling party of hungry careerists. The experience of socialism in the nine years since then has won many Congressmen over. [Genesis and Growth of Nehruism: Foreword: Sitaram Goel. Emphasis added.]\n\nSpratt concludes with great foresight:\n\nThe purpose [in the aftermath of Nehru’s death] is to arrange the succession to Nehru in such a way that the pro-Communists retain control. The dispute over this question is of the greatest importance for India’s future…It is really whether India shall continue to be ruled by a Government of usurpers, who will go on pushing the country against its will towards Communism. [Ibid. Emphasis added.]\n\nThe Daughter also Rises Unfortunately, the latter occurred under the direct patronage of Nehru’s daughter, Indira Gandhi.\n\nThe second milestone was the well-known and notorious 1969 spilt of the Congress party. Indira Gandhi continued to retain her iron-like grip both on the Government and the party but packed most if not all institutions with Communists.\n\nIt was Indira Gandhi who inaugurated the now-commonplace, disgusting culture of public servility: of people her father’s age prostrating before her, falling headlong at her feet. The example of the “freedom fighter,” Radha Raman comes to mind. He was appointed the Delhi Congress chief for this public service of prostrating.\n\nIn a more fundamental sense, as Dr. S L Bhyrappa remarks, Indira Gandhi, in one stroke, extinguished the innate moral sense of the Indian people. It is implausible that an oily “slogan” like “Indira is India” could ever be conceived without erasing this unenforceable, moral line.\n\nThe Dushta-Traya of the London School of Economics While the story of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s toxic deal with the Communists is well-known—gifting them the evil JNU is perhaps the most visible facet of this deal—it had a far more extensive backdrop.\n\nIn the form of the Dushta-Traya or the Communist Troika in her closest circle.\n\nThe members included P N Haksar, D P Dhar, and I K Gujral, all committed Communists. In hindsight, it appears that they vied with one another in the vile project of communizing India. Among others, it was they who advised her to split the party and at every stage pushed her closer and closer to the USSR acting not merely as its agents but as its enablers.\n\nIf you add Mohan Kumaramangalam’s name, the Troika becomes a Dushta Chatushtaya (Evil Quartet).\n\nHow the Congress Party has Surrendered to the Breaking India Forces The more we read history, it becomes clearer that there must be a special place in hell reserved for the London School of Economics under the hegemony of Harold Laski, a guru of sorts to Jawaharlal Nehru and that other reprobate V. K. Krishna Menon, and every vile communist of the era. Speaking of Harold Laski, the inimitable George Orwell says that his writing is not only\n\nespecially bad…but because they illustrate various of the mental vices from which we now suffer. Politics and the English Language Among other disciples that Krishna Menon indoctrinated into radical communism, here are the most prominent ones: Feroze Gandhi, P N Haksar, Mohan Kumaramangalam, Nikhil Chakravarthy, and Mulk Raj Anand. We all know what they eventually became. Here’s a whiff of the kind of things that transpired under their watch:\n\n…in…1971, the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth amendments to the constitution were passed. These empowered the government to alter the fundamental rights…and to protect such changes from judicial review.\n\nIndira’s programme of constitutional change was officially defended by Mohan Kumaramangalam – an old Marxist friend of Feroze Gandhi and P N Haksar…Kumaramangalam had left the [CPI] to join Congress…and she appointed him Minister of Steel and Heavy Engineering. He soon became one of her key strategists and the vocal spokesman for a leftist group within Congress called the Congress Forum for Socialist Action. A primary aim of the Forum was to alter the Indian constitution ‘so that the relationship between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy was reversed, and the larger social good placed above the good of the individual…[because] there was no reason why individual rights should be considered more fundamental than society’s rights. Kumaramangalam also called for a ‘committed judiciary’ just as Haksar defended the idea of ‘a committed bureaucracy.’ ’ [Indira—The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi: Katherine Frank, pp. 328-9. Emphasis added.]\n\nThe implications are as clear as they’re direct. One, Kumaramangalam minces no words in expressing his intent to turn India into a Communist totalitarian state. Two, and ironically, the “committed judiciary” and “committed bureaucracy” that Indira Gandhi couldn’t fully realize in her own lifetime when she wielded hegemonic power, has been achieved by her daughter-in-law who has been out of power for over four years.\n\nA Mephistophelian Deal In a sense, between 1969-75, both Indira Gandhi and the Communists ruthlessly, cynically used each other. Both had realized one thing with great clarity: their mutual terms of engagement. The Communists knew that they could bend Indira Gandhi to their will. But only so far. She knew she could harass and suppress them whenever she willed. But only so far.\n\nOn their part, the Communists flooded the educational and cultural institutions and virtually auctioned themselves at every KGB/Russian outpost operating in New Delhi. It is this shameless spectacle that would later be revealed in the Mitrokhin Archives of how “it seemed that the entire country was up for sale,” and that Moscow had about “40 MPs in the Indian Parliament on its payroll.” This was also the period when the Communist Party of USSR was rampantly and easily buying out editors and journalists—who sold themselves for dirt-cheap rates—and planting stories in their favour. According to one account, the USSR was able to plant over 5500 pro-Communist propaganda in Indian newspapers in a single year!\n\nAnd on her part, Indira Gandhi was busy sacking powerful Congress Chief Ministers, marginalizing disobedient regional satraps, hounding anti-Congress outfits and destroying democratic institutions.\n\nBut two events marked a decisive turn in their Mephistophelian arrangement.\n\nThe first was her merciless crackdown against Naxals: West Bengal is the most representative of this. Especially, the violent action against the Communists unleashed by her childhood friend and West Bengal Chief Minister Siddharth Shankar Ray. In a well-planned, swift and brutal operation, Ray rounded up the Naxals and their prominent supporters in the CPM, and in an astonishingly short period, crushed the rebellion ruthlessly. According to some estimates more than a thousand CPM members were killed. Even today, tales of police brutality during that action are legion. The rebellion was crushed but it simultaneously ensured that the Congress lost the state forever.\n\nAnd then Indira Gandhi began to realize, perhaps a little too late, how foolish and suicidal her deal with the Communists was. They were feeding off her to build their own political base.\n\nWhich paved the way for the second event: imposition of the Emergency. On the surface of it, while the ostensible reason was that Allahabad High Court verdict that set aside Mrs. Gandhi’s election, there are enough grounds to believe that this was also a reaction of panic on her part. The Communists had manipulated her with aplomb. As always, the Rishi Sita Ram Goel comes to our aid.\n\nMrs. Indira Gandhi…had no ideology except unbridled power for herself and her family. So she was prone to use and be used by those who could support her single-minded pursuit. By the time she split the Congress Party in 1969, the communist mafia had perfected the Kumaramangalam plan of supporting her as the rope supports the hanged man. And she walked into the trap, prompted by the apparatus she had inherited from her father.\n\nShe surrounded herself with Moscow’s men and women, recruited directly from the Communist Party of India and its fronts. The “progressive” flock from all over the country rushed to her “rescue” in her confrontation with patriots of long standing in her own party. They helped her to the hilt in retaining power…\n\nIn the next few years, the “progressive” flock multiplied fast and several fold…Moscow’s hatchet men, notably P.N. Haksar, [her] Principal Private Secretary, had a field day…\n\nThe Emergency that followed in June 1975 was by no means an ad hoc idea accepted for meeting an abrupt situation. The idea of imposing an authoritarian regime on the country had been maturing for a long time in the minds of the communist mafia that Pandit Nehru had promoted…The seeds sown by Pandit Nehru were bearing fruits. All those who stood up against Mrs. Indira Gandhi’s guiles and greed were denounced as agents of the CIA. The “progressive” flock was once again in the forefront of the “fight against forces of fascism.” And by the time Mrs. Indira Gandhi realized what was happening, much mischief had been done. [Genesis and Growth of Nehruism: Volume I: Sitaram Goel pp. xi-xii. Emphasis added]\n\nThe Emergency blew the lid off many aspects in more ways than one. For one, the CPI under instructions from Moscow, “warmly endorsed the Emergency.” [Indira—The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi: Katherine Frank, p. 382]. Indira Gandhi had assumed supreme powers but she was also isolated like never before—politically and personally. Sensing her vulnerability, CPI heads like S.A. Dange, Rajeshwar Rao, Bhupesh Gupta, and N.K. Krishnan tried numerous maneuvers to ensnare her furhter but she proved smarter. However, the CPI achieved a big success in Kerala where vast sections of the Congress readily jumped into bed with it.\n\nBut the greatest hurdle to the CPI was her own son, Sanjay Gandhi whose Emergency crimes are well-known to bear repetition. But he also did something else. He gave a recorded interview to Uma Vasudev of a rather bizarrely-titled magazine, Surge.\n\nOf the CPI – which had given the government crucial support during the early months of the Emergency – Sanjay said, ‘I don’t think you’d find a richer or more corrupt people anywhere.’ [Indira—The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi: Katherine Frank, p. 393.]\n\nThat interview, wrote Indira Gandhi in a handwritten note,\n\n“struck me like a sledgehammer. At a most crucial and delicate time, we have not only greviously hurt…[the CPI] who have helped us and are now supporting us within the country, [but also] created problems with the entire Socialist Bloc….How do we inform the USSR?” ’ [Indira—The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi: Katherine Frank, p. 394]\n\nPerhaps this is the plainest confession from this “Durga Ma” and “Iron Lady” of the extent to which she was in the thrall of the Communists. She vowed to remedy it. She had generously nurtured them and they had outsmarted and backstabbed her on more than one occasion.\n\nAlmost immediately after her Second Coming in 1980, she went after them with open hostility. She dismissed the Kerala CPI government in 1981 and began targetting Tripura and Bengal with such aggression that it sent shivers down their rank and file. In fact, the 1980-4 years spelled the most trouble for the Communists.\n\nThe Frankenstein Endures Indira Gandhi died in 1984 but Frankensteinesque parasite that she created has not only outlived her but has skllfully mutated ever since, eating into the very innards of the Indian state and chopping off its civilizational roots decade after agonizing decade.\n\nIndira Gandhi could be ruthless and she had the numbers, guts, and her practiced brazenness to do so. The same skill was displayed by the late Christian Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Y S Rajashekhara Reddy. Both met gory ends.\n\nHow the Congress Party has Surrendered to the Breaking India Forces But what temporarily halted the march of this deadly Frankenstein was the extraordinary Hindu resurgence that began in the late 1980s and dominated most of the next decade. It was a true game changer but—and one says this with regret—as always, the Hindu leadership (for what it’s worth) was content with Idli and Poha instead of the full meal. It is also a profound tragedy that not one work has emerged from the so-called Hindu side that captures the enormous civilizational achievement it attained in this truly historic decade. And so, to turn to Sita Ram Goel again:\n\nThe regimes that followed the Emergency did nothing to free the establishment from the stranglehold of the communist mafia…[which] have continued to…man many other prestigious institutions…\n\nAnd what is much worse, nobody seems to care as to how and by whom this communist mafia is being financed and used after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and whether it has been hired by the oil-rich Islamic imperialism…\n\nHad the Indian establishment purged itself of the poison that is Nehruism, this lapse of memory vis-à-vis the communist mafia would not have been possible. [Ibid]\n\nThat was written in 1993. One and a half generations have passed. And more than four years since Narendra Modi took office. But it is the said mafia that remains in power where it really matters: in the psyche, which in turn gets reflected in movies, music, books, and behaviour.\n\nThe Hindu resurgence of the 1990s delivered a tight slap and a great lesson to the said communist mafia: the sheer impossibility of an electoral victory no matter how hard they tried. And they learned the lesson and how! One big learning was the fact that vast and influential sections of the so-called Hindu side—be it the ideologues or active politicians—were hungry for acceptance and praise from the perfumed circuit of Lutyens. And even worse, they were susceptible to flattery. This among other reasons is why the BJP was unceremoniously ejected from power in 2004.\n\nReturn of the Hungry Careerists And when the hungry careerists returned this time, they did so with a sort of determination, long-term planning, and focus that was truly unprecedented. And scary.\n\nOne of the first things they did was to repeal the highly-effective anti-terrorism law, POTA. What followed almost immediately was a spate of Pakistan-sponsored terror attacks against India with seeming impunity and frequency. Followed by the mother of all: 26/11.\n\nThe response? Sacking a highly-dispensable Home Minister named Shivraj Patil. Which other country allows this sort of thing to occur?\n\nThe NAC, an extra-constitutional collegium of extremist NGOs more powerful than the PM himself virtually began running the country. In fact, a well-researched volume is waiting to be written unearthing the full record of the members of the NAC. In hindsight, and especially after some damning revelations that have emerged since 2014, a valid question needs to be asked: between 2004-14, did Sonia Gandhi control the NAC or was it the other way round?\n\nTo answer Sita Ram Goel’s question, the communist mafia in its new incarnation was now funded by every breaking India force in every continent and country that could afford to fund it. From the Middle East to Scandinavia to the UK to the US; from wealthy oligarchs to Churches of every denomination.\n\nThe two-term Congress-led UPA Government was able to inflict this colossal damage on the country with relative ease for another simple reason. The framework had already been primed decades earlier by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s generous patronage. And when they recaptured power in 2004, it was simply a matter of settling in and rigging the institutions wholesale. Almost irreversibly.\n\nThe rigging continues to deliver splendid dividends, something that Prime Minister Modi with an absolute majority Government has been learning the hard way. This is what I meant when I said that Sonia and Rahul Gandhi have achieved in defeat what an Indira Gandhi in power couldn’t achieve: a committed bureaucracy and an even more committed judiciary.\n\nBut there’s another important reason why the breaking India forces that now control Rahul Gandhi continue to stay invested in him—and in whatever is left of the Congress party. The sheer amount of time that this party has been in power, the loyalty that the institutions still retain towards it, and the unparalleled global network that it enjoys is simply unbeatable by any other political formation in India, least of all the BJP.\n\nPostscript And unless the BJP—or at any rate, folks who care about India as a civilization—recognizes this lethal, breaking-India force that the Congress has become, there won’t be a “next time” after 2024. While Narendra Modi supporters, the BJP, and Hindus in general may still rejoice at the 2014 and 2019 victories, it is a mere blot, a temporary setback in the eyes of said breaking India forces.\n\nThink about it. They have now directly recruited the chief of the Congress party by actually employing their resources to work towards his victory; and if not a victory, at least dashing Narendra Modi’s chances of reelection.\n\nTheir goals are civilizational and therefore multi-generational. It is up to Hindus to decide what their goals should be.\n\n|| Om Tat Sat ||\n\n\nCredit - u/CholiMein'<br />Author: '10100011a10100011a'  id: 'g2z3qj'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g2z3qj/how_the_congress_party_has_surrendered_to_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Brilliant post I read on facebook'<br />Body: "It is alleged that Narendra Modi / BJP want to make India a Hindu State. If that is so,  I question, what is wrong about India being a Hindu Rashtra? My rationale follows below.\n\nBharatvarsh, a civilization as old as 5000 years, needs no introduction of it being the original homeland sheltering 95% of all the Hindus in the world and birth place of Sanatan Hinduism. India should not be shy of recognising her identity as a Hindu Nation. Hinduism is the 3rd largest religion in the world after Christianity and Islam. But it is not demographically as widely spread on the world’s map as the first two. 97% percent of all Hindus live in the world's three Hindu-majority countries (India, Mauritius and Nepal). It is the most geographically concentrated of all the major religious. 95% of the Hindu population live in India whereas only 1.6% of Muslims live in Arabia, the birthplace of Islam. \n\nThe left-liberal have no problems with the 53 Muslim dominated countries (Islam is the official religion in 27) in the world; 100+ Christian dominated countries. In 15 nations, Christianity is the official religion. These Christian nations include England, Greece, and Iceland, Norway, Hungary, Denmark. and 6 Buddhist countries. Israel is a Jewish state. But, when it comes to India, their rationale fails to make me understand as to why Hinduism can’t be state religion of India?\n\nThere is no evidence that threatens the secular ethos of the country, if India is declared a Hindu State. All faiths have flourished in India, including Parsis, Jains, Sikhs, Muslims, Zoroastrians because Hindus are not intolerant towards other religion. One can go to a religious place associated to any religion and find Hindus there. There is no concept of conversion in Hinduism. There are Christian and Muslim nations in the world who raise voice on the Human Rights abuses and religious persecution of Muslims and Christians the world over. The world remembers Myanmar, Palestine, Yemen etc. but not the Hindus &amp; Sikhs of Pakistan or Afghanistan or that of other Islamic nations! Does anyone remember what happened with the Hindus in Bangladesh during the 1971 genocide by Pakistan Army or the Pundits in Kashmir or the 1998 Wandhama massacre of J&amp;K, systemic elimination of Hindus in Pakistan, the elimination of historic temples and Hinduism in the Arab world, e.g. in Muscat? \n\nThe policies of the Indian state have been anti-secular. There has been blatant religious reverse-discrimination against Hindus, its majority community. There are many examples. Have you heard about the Hajj Subsidy? Since 2000, over 1.5 million Muslims used the subsidy. It was only that the Supreme Court passed an order that directed the government to phase out this subsidy within 10 years. Which secular country will subsidise religious tourism for one faith group? The average airfare subsidy was (US$1,000) per Muslim pilgrim in 2008. \n\nWhile the Indian Government was supporting their citizens religious tourism, Saudi Arabia, a country where Hindu icons are condemned as idol worship, was spreading Wahabi extremism worldwide. Hindus are not permitted to build temples and Indian tax payer money was being used to facilitate the Saudi economy by pilgrimage subsidies.  \n\nIn a truly secular country, all citizens irrespective of religion would be covered by a single set of laws. In India, however, people of different religion beliefs are covered by different personal laws. Government control temples but mosques and churches are autonomous. There were subsidies for Hajj but not for Amarnath Yatra or Kumbh Mela. A truly secular country would not subsidise any pilgrimage! PERIOD! \n\nHindus have always welcomed and protected minorities. Let's have a look at its history of tolerance. The Hindu Community of India welcomed Parsis when they were persecuted the world over. They have flourished here for over a thousand years. The Jewish tribes found refuge in Bharat nearly 2000 years ago and same goes for Syrian Christians 1800 years ago. The Jains, Buddhists being religions derivatives of the Hinduism have co-existed for 2500 years  and Sikhs for 400 years. \n\nIt’s time to look back at the facts to feel proud to be a Hindu, shy not anymore! \n\nEven today, India is secular, not due to a Constitutional amendment of 1976 and lawyers and law makers, but because the majority of the people of India are Hindus. It is the very nature of this religion that ensures secularism, not a piece of paper that came into account after thousands of years of tolerant practice. India should openly declare itself as a “Hindu” (Hindu/Sikh/Jain) nation. India should interfere to protect the interests of all of the aforementioned people because no other country is doing it. \n\nDeclaring Hindu nation will open new door of safeguarding the majority against forced conversion and minority appeasement. India will remain a progressive country only till it remain a secular country. And it will remain a secular country only if Hindu domination persist in its demographics. Secularism and Hinduism are two sides of one coin. You toss it, in either ways you win! \n\nIf India becomes a Hindu Rashtra, that would be the best thing to happen. There would become a Uniform Civil Code with no allowances for anyone (including Hindus). Rule of Law has always been one of the main reasons for Growth in any country- Germany, Japan, USA are all based on rule of law. Conversions (to and against) will be banned, proselytising which is the root cause of religious friction will stop; No Tablighis any more. Once conversions are stopped, each person can follow whatever religion he chooses or choose to be atheist (there is a sect called- Nir Ishwara Vad in Hinduism itself). Show me another religion that recognises non-practitioners of the faith with such regards! \n\nSecularism and religious tolerance is the ethos of the inhabitants of this region much before the Muslim invaders ransacked this land. Muslim invasions into the Indian subcontinent started around 1000 AD and they lasted for several centuries till 1739. Destruction of about 100 million Hindus is perhaps the biggest holocaust in the whole world history. Hindus did not take any revenge of from the off springs of these invaders. It is not Hinduism but the implementation of Pseudo-Secularism which is causing interfaith friction between the Hindu majority and the Muslims. In a Hindu Rashtra, the religious freedom of the  Non-Hindus will not be clipped . \n\nHindus must take pride in the history of the land they belong to. They must resort to facts to sort out frictions. They shying away from reality will result into disaster of a land that has its sheer ethos and rich culture of tolerance deeply etched in its soil. India has been foolish enough to give away precious slices to fulfill the demands of Muslim Nations. India has been tolerant enough to practice appeasement in the name of secularism. It time now Hindus must UNITE proclaiming the peace they inherit in them. A Hindu Rashtra, that values secularism through its very nature of practice, devoid of any preamble, will be a citing example for the world. \n\nThe time is NOW."<br />Author: 'manavhs'  id: 'g2exic'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g2exic/brilliant_post_i_read_on_facebook/</li>

Or are they quantum computers from whom encryption is nothing?\n3. The report considers search terms such as school girl porn, and teen porn to be searches for child pornography.

So what need is there for lamentation?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nAccepting that there are two classes of philosophers, one believing in the existence of soul and the other not believing in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation in either case. Nonbelievers in the existence of the soul are called atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet even if, for argument's sake, we accept the atheistic theory, there is still no cause for lamentation. Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material elements remain unmanifested before creation. From this subtle state of unmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth becomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take place. Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth. When it is dismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in the ultimate stage. The law of conservation of energy remains, but in course of time things are manifested and unmanifested—that is the difference. Then what cause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are not lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain unmanifested, and only in the middle are they manifested, and this does not make any real material difference.\n\nAnd if we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the Bhagavad-gītā (antavanta ime dehāḥ) that these material bodies are perishable in due course of time (nityasyoktāḥ śarīriṇaḥ) but that soul is eternal, then we must remember always that the body is like a dress; therefore why lament the changing of a dress? The material body has no factual existence in relation to the eternal soul. It is something like a dream. In a dream we may think of flying in the sky, or sitting on a chariot as a king, but when we wake up we can see that we are neither in the sky nor seated on the chariot. The Vedic wisdom encourages self-realization on the basis of the nonexistence of the material body. Therefore, in either case, whether one believes in the existence of the soul, or one does not believe in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation for loss of the body.\n\n**Question 1: How the nature of material elements changes over a course of time ? What example has been given to explain the same ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e4y8veiw63t41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e747c255670c3115af3e78007f8643fbe22e6ff7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'g25uet'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g25uet/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_228/</li>

There was a huge backlash in International media about the election and vote rigging, many claiming forced votes were cast . But take US elections, where essentialy Multi-Millionaire-Billionaire Elites are ruling democratically for 200 years masquarading as two parties (Democratic and Republican), creating an illusion of a fair practice, without people even realising whats going on. And they are celebrated all over the world as a Model Democracy. \n\nThats Hegemony. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow take this very post. Im conveying this message to all of you in a Language which was imposed upon us by more than 200 years ago, by an intellectual plan, to make a Person look like Indian, but Britisher by Heart. When EIC renewed thier charter in 1813, 1 Lakh Rs was allocated to be spent on Education of the Natives by EIC (It was EIC back then, British givt took control after 1857). Macaulay produced something called  "Minute Upon Indian Education" , in which he said\n\n&gt;"I have never found one among them who could deny that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia"\n\nHe argued against the Education in native languages, in India !\n\nAnd thus, English was introduced in India as a form of Education.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thought that blew my Mind was that each year we celebrate our Independence Day , as our conquest from British, but we still are using the same English, which was thier Hegemonistic tool to tame the native, without even realising it in our daily life.\n\nConsequences ?\n\nThe self loathing Gora loving Indians you see on the net. We are influenced soo much by their culture, that we even loathe been an Indian. Loathing is soo much that some are expecting that this Corona shuld blow up in India, so that they could go on to say see how bad our govt is. BBC NYT WaPo right, GOI wrong.\n\nYou would never see a Chinese doing that, a Japanese , a German, A Frech doing that.\n\nWe are still under Hegemonisitic control of the British, pretending we are above them\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBritish 1\n\nBharat 0'<br />Author: 'CeleritasLucis'  id: 'g23wsr'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g23wsr/english_and_the_hegemony_the_cultural_conquest_of/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Interesting Story'<br />Body: "So Story starts in 2011 when India Against corruption was in peak. \n\nFor the first time English media was dominating. Leading the charge &amp; setting the Agenda was Arnab Goswami @TimesNow .Ahmed Patel P Chidambaram at that time meet Aroon Purie (India Today) Raghav Rajdeep (CNN IBN) \nAnd Prannoy Roy NDTV. Attempts where made to Separate all channels from @TimesNow specially Arnab Goswami. But it was too late. People's where on the streets &amp; ecosystem was checkmated . \n\nDuring this Time Living media under whom @IndiaToday comes that time (Headlines Today) which was financially understress asked Ahmed Patel &amp; P chidambaram to bail them out. \n\n\nCome 2012 Miya Patel &amp; P Chidambaram persuaded Kumar Mangalam birla To bail out @aroonpurie Living Media. \nIn May 2012 Kumar Birla picked 27.5 % in Living Media Ltd . The first Story after Birla stake in Headlines Today was Alleged Snoop Case of Gujarat &amp; Ishrat Jahan Encounter case. Just 6 months before Gujarat assembly elections. \n\n\nBut all this allegations backfired on Ecosystem Modi Won Gujarat 2012 handsomely . This didn't stop Anti Modi campaign of Headlines Today Till June 2013 it tried it's best so that BJP don't announce him as PM candidate. \n\n\nOnce MODI was announced @aroonpurie &amp; Kumar Birla changed their position seeing the changing direction of wind . During this period kumar Birla increased his stake from 27.5 to 35 % (hear comes the scam which I will reval during this thread ) 7.5 %increase . \n\n\nCome May 2014 Things turned upside down for the corporate world specially those corporates who were closed to Gandhi family. \nIn Aug 2014 when Modi Government went After NDTV. Fearing that he will be next kumar birla tried to sell his stake in LIVING MEDIA. But Aroon Purie meet Arun Jaitley Along with Kumar birla asking for assurance that Government will not go after their media house. \n\n\nJaitley Assured them .Aroon Purie Freindship with Jaitley came to his rescue. Birla holded his decision of selling his stake. And that's how India Today survived. \n\nHere comes the twist After December 2018 assembly results @aroonpurie &amp; kumar birla again started Anti BJP campaign whether it was showing of Rahul Gandhi on Magazine cover or Rafael Story day after day its turned more &amp; more Anti BJP . \n\n\nAll was hunky dory for the ecosystem &amp; @aroonpurie uptill 26th FEBRUARY 2019 that day was the biggest blow for the ecosystem. That day SEALED 2019 for @narendramodi . Cunning Purie &amp; Birla again made the U Turn turned in its editorial position shifted to PRO BJP . \n\n\nModi returned in 2019 but this time their was no Jaitley to help for the likes of Purie . AMIT SHAH was calling the shots government adds to India today &amp; some channels got big cut in NAMO GOVERNMENT 2.0 \nFacing the crunch Purie again reached out to Congress . Birla too was angry by government because of Vodafone Idea issue. Enters Kamalnath &amp; Ahmed Miya Patel Tango . \n\n\nKamalnath promised add revenues &amp; political clout to both @aroonpurie &amp; Kumar birla Add packages of as many as 180 cr was promised to purie. \n\n\nSuddenly after kamalnath deal @IndiaToday once started doing anti government story's on economy &amp; Job .They Got more &amp; more emboldened after Congress formed Government in Maharashtra &amp; Jarkhand. \n\n\nSee how viscous &amp; anti government their stand &amp; coverage was during CAA protest &amp; Delhi elections .weather its JNU episode or fake tapes on ABVP . With each passing day @IndiaToday was trying to become Times Now of 2011 to 2014 .\n\nTurning CAA protest into @narendramodi IAC moment \nDuring this period kumar birla also added fire on economic front by going public &amp; saying that we will have to shut our shop if government doesn't intervene.\n\nAll this was a calculated move to up the ante against the Government both on economic &amp; socio front. \nAmit Shah luckly came with short in his arm in 3rd week of January2020. When he digged out 7.5 % stake matter (remember 27.5 %to 35%) k Birla stake in the living media during 2012 to 2014. only Modi was aware of this because Jaitley told him .shah asked @aroonpurie to meet him . \n\n\nAroon Purie along with @supriyapd went to meet shah without any pleasantries shah put some documents in front of them &amp; told our government is hear minimum for 50+ months . I will make sure that your shop gets closed make no mistake about it . \n\n\nListening to that Aroon Purie just got worried and asked what mistake he committed for shah anger. Shah said asked this question to yourself. After Delhi elections None of my party spokesperson will be on your Debates like NDTV. Saying this much shah got up &amp; went for other meet \nAroon Purie after hearing all this from shah dailed to PMO for an urgent meet with PM @narendramodi which got declined. \n\nPurie then asked Kumar birla to pacify shah &amp; told the whole story .Birla also didn't got chance to speak with shah .so he called @rsprasad . \nmentions told him that he will get back to him after talking with Shah . First shot was fired @AmitShah asked Purie to toe the line .\n\nPurie agreed &amp; then came the second demand of SHAH to throw Rahul kanwal Out of India Today. Purie said it will be counter productive. \nShah replied back it doesn't matter &amp; put down the phone. Aroon Purie conveyed this to Rahul kanwal &amp; asked him that if he can calm Shah Anger .Rahul kanwal tried to call Shah which Shah didn't replied. \n\n\nNext day early morning 7:00 AM (Delhi winter) Rahul kanwal was on shah home without appointment some how shah gave him time .Rahul first sentence was I am sorry I was just toeing kaali purie orders . \n\nI have nothing against BJP. \nTo which shah replied that it doesn't matter I will make sure that you will be the next barkha dutt in the market. At this moment Rahul asked just one last chance to Shah after that he will not let him down. Shah asked him to stay away from Delhi campaign coverage &amp; he obliged \nMatter shaant for time being . \n\nAroon Purie &amp; Kumar Birla decide to shut Delhi Aaj tak post Delhi elections &amp; Trump visit . \nCome March with the arrest of Yes Bank chairman Rana Kapoor &amp; chances of kamalnath lossing power in MP another media baron got worried. Enters the name of @Raghav_Bahl &amp; @TheQuint \nRaghav knew his game is up post 2019 he was always under the stress with Rana Arrest &amp; Kamalnath on the verge of losing MP he decided to sell quint. \n\nHe contacted his freind a Politician from Maharashtra who runs the biggest Bidi business in country. \nBidi king was aware of Kumar Birla plan of winding up Delhi Aaj tak so he asked if he interested in buying Digital news media network. \n\nKumar birla showed interest. \nIn the third week of March meeting was set up between @Raghav_Bahl @aroonpurie &amp; Bidi king at a five star hotel in bandra Mumbai. \n\n\nAroon Purie showed interest in buying quint. So both raghav &amp; aroon decided to meet again this time in NCR . Aroon Purie without any knowledge that both bidi king &amp; Raghav are under agency watch came back to delhi. \n\n\nNext day both Aroon Purie &amp; kumar birla received the call that 7.5 % stake matter will go under inquiry. And they both will pay heavy price for it. \n\n\nIn the meantime coronavirus &amp; lockdown came so matter put on hold . The sudden Pro BJP turn or you may say PRO HINDU turn of @IndiaToday is nothing but sucking up exercise. \n\n\nFor the long time both @narendramodi &amp; @AmitShah did gave long rope to @aroonpurie Hope now they will take action.

I am in family biz from last 2 years. 4 months back my dad hired a female P.A. He is sleeping with her. I got to know this because he had hotel bookings in his name. Just around the house.  Recently I saw my dad and the P.A's chat also. He had deleted his side of messages but the P.A msgs were still there even after 2 days he hadn't deleted them. Later on i myself had to delete them fearing that either my sister or my mom could read those msgs.I always knew that he engages in paid sex on business trips and was somehow adjusting with it. But to see that lady daily in office really disturbs me.  Now I am hoping to somehow scare that lady and let her know that her and my dad's activity are out In the office staff. So that she may choose another company or atleast deny my dad in any such encounters. But I am not sure how to do that. I want to bring his fidelity to his highlight while not letting the family and family business know anything about this."<br />Author: 'anonymousindian21'  id: 'g1w48y'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g1w48y/suggestions_for_family_problem/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Improving communal harmony in India-your perspective?'<br />Body: 'Another day and another attack on docs and police out to test people. This time in Moradabad.   \nI do not think that this should be given a communal angle, although in the recent past, most attacks have been from a particular community. \n\nYet, it isn\'t in the interest of the nation if this community is ridiculed, mocked or demonized like they do on ZeeNews, Republic etc. Neither is it good if they are shown as angels like they do on NDTV. \n\nI wonder what can be done to improve communal harmony in India. I\'ve lived in many places, and nowhere in the world does this sort of segregation exist between different communities. In most places in India, you cannot rent a home outside the ghetto areas without changing your name if you are a Muslim. This breeds distrust on both sides. Similar is the case for school admissions. Many schools don\'t admit Muslims, and this denies children the right of a good education.\n\nI wonder how this community can be better integrated into the Indian society. Most of them are not bad people. In fact some of the best musicians, artists and industrialists are from that community. There are a few thousand brainwashed idiots who listen to their mosque more than the news, and they cause all these issues. \n\nA few suggestions from my side- not anyway qualified to give them, but still an attempt\n\n1. Convert all madrasas to CBSE/ICSE or state board. Missionary schools are some of the best performing in the country, and they do give mild religious training (church hymns on Christmas etc) but it is in no way harmful. They accept people of all communities. Madrasas-less said the better. \n2. Create awareness about reducing discrimination in residential and commercial areas. One of my acquaintances is a very successful scientist. He had to register an apartment under another legally changed name because builders won\'t give him the flat as he is a Muslim. This was in Mumbai. This has to stop. Discrimination breeds distrust and creates disharmony.\n3. Jail the religious leaders fanning violence. Don\'t let them out. \n4. Genuinely try to get involved in understanding and participating in different community festivals. I remember that as a kid, we had Id celebrations in a Christian school which I could enjoy as a Hindu kid. We did not care about such communal differences. Many who say "kill them" have never worked with or had a friend of a different community. \n5. Avoid using derogatory words denouncing an entire community for the actions of a few hundred idiots. If you find something suspicious, report to law authorities. \n\nThere are some here who say that Muslims are the cause of population growth in India. To them, I\'d suggest reading this article.  [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/what-the-data-tells-us-are-muslims-responsible-for-indias-population-explosion-not-quite/](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/what-the-data-tells-us-are-muslims-responsible-for-indias-population-explosion-not-quite/) \n\nUnless this community is better integrated into our society, we will not see peace in the near future.'<br />Author: 'bloomingcynic2'  id: 'g1tt16'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g1tt16/improving_communal_harmony_in_indiayour/</li>

Why Kṛṣṇa addressed Arjuna as mahā-bāhu ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "There is always a class of philosophers, almost akin to the Buddhists, who do not believe in the separate existence of the soul beyond the body. When Lord Kṛṣṇa spoke the Bhagavad-gītā, it appears that such philosophers existed, and they were known as the Lokāyatikas and Vaibhāṣikas. These philosophers maintained that life symptoms, or soul, takes place at a certain mature condition of material combination. The modern material scientist and materialist philosophers also think similarly. According to them, the body is a combination of physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms develop by interaction of the physical and chemical elements. The science of anthropology is based on this philosophy."\n\n"According to the Vaibhāṣika philosophy, the so-called soul or ātmā vanishes along with the deterioration of the body. So, in any case, whether Arjuna accepted the Vedic conclusion that there is an atomic soul, or whether he did not believe in the existence of the soul, he had no reason to lament. According to this theory, since there are so many living entities generating out of matter every moment, and so many of them are being vanquished every moment, there is no need to grieve for such an incidence. However, since he was not risking rebirth of the soul, Arjuna had no reason to be afraid of being affected with sinful reactions due to his killing his grandfather and teacher. But at the same time, Kṛṣṇa sarcastically addressed Arjuna as mahā-bāhu, mighty-armed, because He, at least, did not accept the theory of the Vaibhāṣikas, which leaves aside the Vedic wisdom. As a kṣatriya, Arjuna belonged to the Vedic culture, and it behooved him to continue to follow its principles."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 2.26, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g7pr82e1wzs41.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1aa51c055f918fc421010179d4e76deacaff114c\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

So beta logon, here's how this old unkil thinks Corona will affect the world and India:\n\n1. More importance given to manufacturing sector: Indian economy is predominantly based on type-1 sector (agriculture) and lately since early 2000s, we are leaning more towards type-3 sector (service-based economy) completely bypassing the necessary growth of the type-2 sector. As global leaders are forced to rethink the relevance and dangers of globalisation during the wake of recent events (Italy was heavily dependent on China for the raw material used in its industries), we have no other option other than becoming self-sufficient in manufacturing instead of importing the initial product from other countries. So this can help in generation of more jobs for core-engineering graduates.\n\n.\n\n2. Increased automation- Business thinks only about itself and the recent events have made the business owners realise the precarious situation their dependence on manpower can land their industries in. So, businesses will invest more in automation, artificial intelligence to minimize their dependence on human capital so that they won't suffer as great loss as they are facing this time and this will increase unemployment.\n\n.\n\n3. Less privatization- Indian people love to complain about government and government establishments. Granted, our government organisations have many flaws but the response to COVID Crisis has reinstated the necessity of a robust infrastructure of government machinery. While the private organisations and hospitals are closed, it's the government organisations and the workers there who are providing people's needs be it hospitals, police, electricity boards, banks and Insurance offices.\n\n.\n\n4. Drop in mental health issues: According to statistics, India is reported to have much lesser no. of suicides now as compared to normal situation. This is also evident in history when there were lesser no. of mental illness cases during wars. During a disaster-like situation, humans are programmed in a fight-or-flee mode and there is much lesser time to brood. But we have to be extremely careful in the after-period as it'll be the time when unemployment will be high and economy will be low.\n\n.\n\nWhat will be the not-so-visible impacts of CoVid pandemic on India and world in your opinion?\n\nP.S.: I've given up the hope that China will never face the consequences of its wrongdoings.

      <li>Title::: 'Indian history in academia—problems, short term and long term solutions to counter the self hating tendencies abounding in a large section of our population.'<br />Body: 'The following is a list of prominent Indian Historians in academia; most of whom are dead but whose works have and will continue to serve as a foundation for others foraying into this field—\n\nR.S. Sharma, Satish Chandra, Bipan Chandra― *NCERT History Books\' (the prescribed textbooks for CBSE schools) primary authors with independent academic works of their own, all using the Marxist Approach of viewing History with the lenses of socioeconomic interaction between "oppressor and the oppressed".*\n\n\nRomila Thapar, Irfan Habib― *NCERT Supporting Historians of the above three along with independent works of their own, writing from a Marxist approach which completely denounces schools which view Indian History from a "communal viewpoint", that is as a conflict between Hindus and Muslims.*\n\n\nA.L. Basham― *British Historian under whose tutelage 3 of the above 5 studied. Has independent works on the entire history of India, from an obvious Marxist approach which is critical of viewing Indian History with the lenses of "post-independence ideas of nationalism". The "mastermind" behind popularising Marxist historiography as the dominant thought in Indian academia.*\n\n\nRC Majumdar— *The lone historian writing from a somewhat nationalistic point of view, who holds that it\'s impossible not to see Indian history with a "communal" lens, seeing as how religion was often a driving factor between both the invasions and the subsequent treatment of the invaded. His 11 volume magnum-opus, which took 26 years to complete, captures the entire history of India from prehistoric times till it\'s independence.* \n\n\nIt\'s little surprise then, that our kids grow up with a colonial hangover being apologetic about being a hindu, and sympathetic to the very people who invaded and destroyed large swathes of the indigenous culture.\n\nSo what should RW Indians who want history to be shown from the "right side" do??\n\nThe obvious answer would be to encourage more and more right leaning people to get into arts and humanities (which is dominated by left leaning ones the world over), and change the entire system from within over time. While that\'s certainly the long term aim, we can make do with what\'s on our hand for the time being too (seeing as how research and subsequent formation of course structure in history takes decades). \n\nMost of the above marxist historians, despite having heavily "anti-nationalistic/Hindu" overtones, do have their moments where they mildly or even strongly espouse patriotic/pro "dhārmic" ideas.\n\nWhile Romila Thapar views Aurangzeb as a "gentleman", her debunking of the myth of Buddhist persecution at the hands of Hindus, as often alleged by radical Ambedkarites, is noteworthy and is well backed by archaeological and literary sources.\n\nSimilarly, Bipan Chandra has often downplayed the atrocities committed by the Muslim rulers of the 17the/18th century and even offered justifications in the case of rulers like Tipu Sultan (he claims that much of the violence towards Hindus was not because of their religion; rather it was because they had supported the British as opposed to the kingdom of Mysore). However, he is pretty patriotic when it comes to the Indian struggle for independence against the British, never once lapsing into the *British colonialism was good for India* mode. \nThis is in stark contrast to RC Majumdar who, while being staunchly nationalistic when writing about ancient and medieval India , falls in the camp of "colonialism wasn\'t as bad as it\'s made out to be" in his writings on India\'s struggle for independence.\n\nWhile a complete historical ~~revisionism~~ correction is the only permanent solution to rid our coming generations of the insecurity and self hatred, we (as in our generation) can make do with what has been done so far too, if only we learn to glean the "cash" from the "trash".'<br />Author: 'TerryMcGinnis1999'  id: 'g1o1ki'<br />Score:41<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g1o1ki/indian_history_in_academiaproblems_short_term_and/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Do you often get a feeling that many young people in India are far less emotionally connected to the country than in the past? Not a millennial bashing thread- genuine query.'<br />Body: 'I often talk to people my age, and younger, and get a feeling that they are disconnected from India emotionally. Not a generalization, just based on those I interact with. Exceptions are always there, and the more the better.\n\nYou can work or study abroad, enjoy life etc. But\nit is not okay to shit on your origin, especially when you did not contribute anything to its betterment.\n\nSome examples that I recently e countered, which made me write this\n\n* One person my age (90s born) said that India is a cesspool and he was sad he was born here. He could have achieved much more if he was born somewhere else.\n* Another person, slightly younger, said that India is religious, superstitious and inward-looking and won\'t shine in front of modern societies like the west.\n* Some openly criticized the nation as being run by illiterate fascists and they do this even when outside the country.\n* A high-schooler was recently arguing that IITs, NITs, medical colleges and good Science/Arts colleges like St Stephens etc are shit and only deliver outdated education. The only good colleges according to him are in the US, UK, Singapore etc...\n* Many of you who have lived/worked abroad would have noticed that an Indian often refuses to acknowledge another, even with a polite nod or smile. It is as if by acknowledging someone from your own country you\'re lowering your status.\n* A total disregard for Indian artists, writers, creators etc,. Unless blessed by a first-world award or acknowledgment.\n\nWhy do I think these are unjust criticisms? Each point is debunked as follows.\n\n* Nationality does have an effect on the opportunities you get but think about our parents\' generation. Many of them achieved a lot despite being from a poorer and weaker India.\n* Have you ever seen the number of people who attend church or mosques? It is almost a Sunday ritual for everyone. Being religious is not a sign of backwardness- it is an individual choice.\n* Don\'t think anyone in the government is a fascist. They should look at countries they admire- USA has been killing foreign leaders all the time (recent one being the Iranian general on charges of terrorism, while supplying the Pakistanis with F16s). They even hunt down whistleblowers who expose their human rights violations in Iraq wars. They practically created the chaos in Afghanistan along with the soviets. Yet, that\'s not condemnable and akin to a rouge government?\n* Most of the companies the kids and adults below 35 work in are led by people from the good institutes of India, even globally. There are exceptions, like those who work in completely foreign-owned companies, but many of us get our bread by toiling at places built by these graduates. Even now, many of the top research organizations in India have their leadership from these places. If you look at the generation before liberalization, many of them succeeded abroad and contributed substantially to India. So many think tanks, institutes, companies are funded by them.\n* I have seen the lack of acknowledgement very often. In fact, some Pakistanis and Bangladeshis are more open and cordial to talk to, or seek help from, than Indians. This is not with friends or relatives. It is with people you might meet at work (but not your team), outside when socializing etc. It is seen as cool if you go out with foreigners, and you\'re said to be "not blending in" if you\'re with others from your country.\n* I am far from knowledgeable about the arts, but I feel sad seeing kids as young as 10 who have not heard any vernacular song, read any books by classic authors (like Premchand etc) from India. Some of them enjoy Justin Bieber and Dua Lipa but shun any effort to get a taste of Indian artists, irrespective of the genre. I mean, it is great that you love international artists, but Indian artists are not shun-worthy either. I don\'t like the cultural colonization of Indian kids and teens.\n\nLast point- maybe slightly unrelated. I have a feeling that many young Indians, especially ones from privileged backgrounds, are rude, sometimes cocky, with other Indians, without any basis. It is very difficult to have a mature and informative conversation with a cool head. One manifestation of this is how some young people say "okay boomer" when confronted with an opinion from an older person. I mean, you can disagree, but being cocky exposes your insecurities. One guy my age recently shocked me by saying that the coronavirus is a "boomer eliminator". WTF really.\n\nPoliteness is free.\n\nMaybe it is that the frustration of living in a crowded country is getting to them, but as I said earlier, problems exist everywhere.\n\nTLDR: I think many young Indians (perhaps me included) need a lesson in being true to the roots, respectful of others especially the older generation and more level headed, polite in our dealings.'<br />Author: 'bloomingcynic2'  id: 'g1jdjl'<br />Score:190<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g1jdjl/do_you_often_get_a_feeling_that_many_young_people/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Ancient India I: inventions and discoveries'<br />Body: 'I was reading about the [Four Great Inventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Great_Inventions) of Ancient China (compass, gunpowder, paper, printing), and was wondering what an analog for Ancient India would look like.\n\nAs I thought about it, Ancient India is better summarized by a "**Five Great Disciplines**" of advancements, rather than individual items, as these seem to have been specific specializations of Ancient India. Also, India had an incredibly prized intellectual/academic tradition and a culture that highly valued knowledge (this is what it means when people say Brahmins were at the "top" of the varna system), so just counting inventions doesn\'t really do it justice.\n\nThe Five Disciplines are:\n\n* Money\n* Mathematics\n* Metallurgy\n* Military\n* Medicine\n\nI\'m going to ignore the Bronze Age (Indus Valley) in this article, because (1) these "themes" developed mainly in the Upanishadic (800 BC onward) period (the themes of the Indus Valley were rather: measurement, water and sanitation, agriculture, construction, trade) (2) the Indus Valley receives a relatively fair treatment in history IMO, because its history has been pieced together by archaeologists, rather than by historians who add their politicized "interpretations".\n\n**Money**\n\n(I wanted to label this "Economics and Finance", but didn\'t want to break the pattern of M\'s – [obligatory xkcd](https://xkcd.com/276/))\n\nAncient India is the only civilization in the world before Renaissance Europe to systematically study economics. In the Arthashastra, all of social science was considered a subfield of economics (rather than vice versa), and wealth creation was considered the ultimate goal of economic policy (although this was further justified by the "service of the aged"). I would consider the Ancient Indian views of economics to be generally right-wing and anthropocentric.\n\nAlthough the Vedas might have initially condemned usury (interest), such a taboo did not exist by the Upanishadic era, and interest was celebrated as a form of profit by the Arthashastra period. As a result of the freedom enjoyed by the financial sector, Ancient India engineered a number of important financial institutions and practices (perhaps more so than the rest of the world combined):\n\n* Loan deeds are first recorded in the Upanishadic period.\n* The first minted currency in the world may have been from either India (Kosala kingdom) or Lebanon.\n* The first (private) corporations were found in the Maurya empire (public-sector corporations were later seen in Rome).\n* Cheques were first used in the Maurya empire.\n* The double-entry bookkeeping system of accounting was developed by at least the 1st century by Indian merchants, who are known to have transmitted it to the Romans.\n\n**Mathematics**\n\nMathematics is perhaps the most well-known strength of Ancient Indian civilization, in which it eclipsed everybody else by a large margin. Unlike the Greek tradition, Indian mathematics did not restrict itself with idiosyncrasies, and unlike the Chinese tradition, Indian mathematics was comfortable exploring theoretical and creative aspects of mathematics, rather than focusing on a small set of practical problems.\n\nFibonacci\'s translation of Indian mathematics into Latin sparked the Renaissance in Europe, which paved the way for the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution and the modern age (a common misconception is that Fibonacci\'s work was a compilation of "Indian and Arab mathematics", and that he learned it from the Arabs – however, by his own account, his translation was ["entirely based on Indian mathematics", and he learned it from a colony of Indian merchants in the Middle East](https://threadreaders.com/thread/1198524622263607298)).\n\nThe nice thing about the history of science is that we usually know the name of the people who discovered things – scientists are a proud lot. In India, we can write down a series of mathematicians who each defined their entire era:\n\nBaudhayana (Upanishadic), Pingala (Maurya), Aryabhata (Gupta/Vatakata), Brahmagupta (post-Gupta), Mahavira (Rashtrakuta), Bhaskara II (Kalyani Chalukya), Madhava (Vijayanagara).\n\nBaudhayana (c. 700 BC), who authored a *Shulba sutra*, was arguably the first true "mathematician" in history, and certainly the first mathematician since the collapse of the Bronze Age.\n\nPerhaps the most prominent mathematical disciplines in Ancient India were:\n\n* **Number theory:** Pell\'s equations, Bezout\'s identity, Chinese remainder theorem, etc.\n* **Combinatorics:** Binomial coefficients, Pascal\'s triangle, etc.\n* **Numerical base:** Binary numbers, integer logarithm, Fibonacci numbers\n* **Geometry:** Pythagoras\'s theorem, various theorems in Euclidean geometry, modern trigonometric functions.\n* **Analysis:** Differentiation, infinite series, classification of infinities. (A common myth is that calculus in India began with the Kerala school. In fact, differentiation was discovered by Manjula during the Golden Age age of Karnataka.)\n* **Numerical algorithms:** Various root-finding algorithms, quadratic interpolation. The "algorisms" (the arithmetic algorithms you use in primary school) of al-Khwarizmi were also seemingly attributed to Indian mathematics, as the treatises in which he discusses them are titled  *kitāb al-ḥisāb al-hindī* and *kitab al-jam\' wa\'l-tafriq al-ḥisāb al-hindī*. Besides, a precursor to long division, called galley division, is known to have originated in India.\n* **Linguistics:** Panini\'s formal systems\n* **Notation and conventions:** Although the modern decimal system with a zero is the most well-known here, Indian mathematics also introduced the modern fraction notation and the decimal separator.\n\nMany famous Indian mathematicians were also astronomers. Ujjain remained an important centre of astronomy even after the fall of the Guptas, where important Kannada astronomers such as Bhaskara would work. Important Indian astronomical discoveries include: the ellipticity of planet orbits (Aryabhata), incredily accurate eclipse charts (by Aryabhata), the discovery of comets as astronomical and periodic phenomena (by Varahamira), calculations of the periods of comets (by Bhattotpala), the Tychonic system (by Nilakantha Somayaji).\n\n**Metallurgy**\n\nSouthern India was one of the first centers of the Iron Age (alongside Northern India and a possible unidentified tribe in the Middle East), and was the main metallurgical metropolis of the ancient world.\n\nSteel was first produced in Southern India, and its Wootz steel, produced through the crucible technique, was considered the highest quality steel in the world up until the industrial revolution. It was also the first known human use of nanoparticles (later examples include a color-changing glass Roman cup).\n\nMetallurgy was the source of the rich Indian tradition of alchemy/chemistry of which I know little. Notably, the Iron pillar of Delhi (originally constructed at Mathura by the Gupta empire) was the best example of rust-resistant metallurgy until the invention of stainless steel in the 20th century.\n\nOther than the famed ferrous metallurgy, India was also the site of the first zinc mines (and the first diamond mines, but those aren\'t metal, and those are prehistoric), in modern-day Rajasthan, from the Mauryan period. The earliest known examples of galvanization are also from Indian armours.\n\n**Military**\n\nA popular misconception is that India was easily invaded throughout its history.\n\nIn reality, all the great empires of Asia stopped at the banks of the Indus, despite really *wanting* to invade India. Although the region corresponding to modern-day Pakistan was occupied several times, inner India was  (with the three notable exceptions) at best briefly plundered by foreign dynasties.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vo30l001qts41.png?width=1348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=553c0f4713d954556d5e6aa610e594fe8e4d896c\n\nContrast this with other important accessible regions of the Ancient world: Greece, the Middle East, etc.\n\nPart of the reason for Ancient India\'s military strength was the war elephant – which you will often see as the only reason cited by historians (it is to be noted that the management of war elephants also required significant skill: almost all non-Indian polities that tried to deploy war elephants failed spectacularly, with the notable exception of Hannibal). Certainly elephants were critical to Indian military formations (and grew in importance with time), and acted as some sort of fortress-cum-tank.\n\nBut it\'s also important to note that Ancient India was simply superior in terms of military technology for most of its history. Noteworthy items in this sphere include:\n\n* The catapult, an invention of Ajatashatru (although may not have been the *superior siege weapon*)\n* The scythed chariot, also an invention of Ajatashatru (this was exported to the Persians, who famously used it against the Greeks).\n* The flamethrower was first invented in Tamilakam (some like to attribute it to the Greeks, but the Greeks themselves attribute it to the Tamils in the *Periplus of the Erythraean sea*). At least a thousand years after their invention, they were used in the Cholas in Indonesia.\n* Minor utilities such as the stirrup\n* Saltpeter (a precursor to gunpowder), which was used for its smoke (i.e. as chemical warfare) as per the *Arthashastra*.\n* Various mechanical contraptions and devices, including automatic doors in fortress warfare, as per the *Arthashastra*.\n* Military strategy (both related to practical combat and the more abstract study of domestic and external security, e.g. espionage) was an entire field of study in India (contrast with Rome, which although well-known for its military strategy, was mostly stagnant and unquestioning in this matter).\n\nThe rich ferrous metallurgy of India was itself a massive asset here. A whole chunk of Ancient India\'s military technology can be characterized by the question "Can I put iron on it?" The Mysorean rockets are an example, and find a mention in the U.S. national anthem ("...*the rockets\' red glare*...").\n\n**Medicine**\n\nThe systematization of medicine and surgery (medicine being viewed as a physical, rather than magical phenomenon) can be attributed to the Sushruta Samhita (600-200 BC) and related traditions of Upanishadic-era India. Many surgeries documented in the treatise are well-known (cataract surgery, caesarian surgery, plastic surgery, prosthetic limbs, etc.)\n\nBut the text also contains academic advancements in biology: a description of the muskoskeletal structure and the functions of ligaments and joints, the cardiovascular system as a closed circuit, the existence of nerves, etc. A significant improvement over the Bronze Age Egyptians who thought the heart was the source of absolutely everything, including urine.\n\n**Honorary mentions**\n\nUnlike the above, in which India was significantly ahead of other civilizations, these are areas where India made some significant advancements but I would put it on par with many others, or where it was ahead, but the area isn\'t really advanced enough (or just doesn\'t start with an M).\n\n* **Transportation infrastructure:** I\'ve heard that India built the first iron suspension bridge, although I haven\'t seen a good primary source for this (perhaps one of the Chinese travelers\' accounts of India may have something on this, as they had to cross some hills)\n* **Mechanical devices:** India had a tradition of simple machines similar to that in Greece. The *Arthashastra* mentions several chalayantras (dynamic devices), and later commentaries describe a theoretical basis for such engineering in terms of "pressure, rotation and weight". Water-wheels (araghatta), which were important for power generation in the ancient world, *may* have originated in India, maybe not.\n* **Exploration:** India had numerous historical contacts with Australia: first during the Indus Valley period, and later by several Tamil dynasties, making it the first-known civilization to make contact with the New World. Tamil navigation and shipbuilding was the technological frontier c. 1000 AD and had a massive influence on the famous Chinese shipbuilding of the period.\n* **Ink and writing:** India ink was manufactured in India, although it\'s not clear if its use as an ink started in India or China. Pens as we know them (pointed needles filled with ink) originated in South India.\n* **Textiles:** Plant-based fabrics (cotton) originated in India, as did several technologies relating to its production, such as the charkha and carding.\n* **Food:** Sugar processing technologies originated in India, and India was an important source of spices or something I\'ve heard (although shockingly enough, chillies are not actually Indian, but rather originated in the Southern US/Mexico and were introduced to the Vijayanagara empire by the Portugese).\n\nSome badly-missing things: cartography, visual arts. It is known from literature that India had a cartographical tradition, yet not a single surviving ancient Indian map is known (excluding cave drawings from the stone age). We also know that India\'s artistic tradition included painting, and have some remains (such as the Ajanta caves), but they are heavily damaged, and their condition worsening.\n\nAs I write this, I\'m thinking of turning this into a series. There is a lot to be said about Ancient India, and nobody really does it justice.\n\nOn one hand, you have the Marxist "mainstream" historians, who despise Ancient India, which they see as synonymous with the caste system, and deliberately downplay and ignore Ancient Indian achievements. On the other hand, you have wingnuts who think Ancient Indians had the internet. And because our gods have multiple hands, we also have a third hand, with insecure people who try to formulate Indian history in a way that tries to appeal to left-wing social movements.\n\nMeanwhile, India\'s actual achievements are ignored (compare how often you see Ancient Indian inventions or philosophy to Greek/Chinese/Arab ones in history books).\n\nPlanned series:\n\n* [Ancient India I: inventions and discoveries](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g1g7f6/ancient_india_i_inventions_and_discoveries/)\n* Ancient India II: a timeline\n* Ancient India III: classical Hindu philosophy\n* Ancient India IV: GDP estimates\n* Ancient India V: speculations on history and mythology'<br />Author: 'srimahalingam'  id: 'g1g7f6'<br />Score:40<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g1g7f6/ancient_india_i_inventions_and_discoveries/</li>

After watching the movie "Parasite", I have been left wondering what do Indian servants think of their employer and their family?

Or do they just watch as the comedy unfolds? The income disparity and difference in opportunities must be quite eye opening. I wonder what they think of the employers kids who wont go outside because it is "too hot", or madam who is "Depressed" all day because she does nothing around the house, or the rebellious son/daughter who wont study despite being given every opportunity to do so.'<br />Author: 'butterchicken90'  id: 'g1d8ah'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g1d8ah/what_do_suppose_the_servants_think_of_their/</li>

Face the facts, unless you create economic incentive for your languages they will die, you can prolong the death but it will happen. Literally no kid in upper class family reads hindi newspapers (think about wealth distribution who can spend money how it affects country), I doubt they could even read them at speed. The only solution to this is let states go their own way for languages especially in education and businesses. UP, Bihar, MP, Delhi, Rajasthan can form a coalition and force all businesses in these states to be in Hindi, and the colleges in these states to teach higher ed in Hindi.

I am 12 student and I may not know anything more than basic 10 grade economics and I may be wrong but with the jobs of the informal sector now virtually suspended the government should be make new regulations that would help to make the informal sector jobs more formal and centralised. It would not only help the union government but would benefit low level workers to secure employment and earn money more consistently and so the amount of workers dependent on going out everyday to feed their family may change. And as many people have moved back to rural areas with many having expertise in some skill and the government going to bailout many big companies going under, with some of that resources they should also give to those people in rural areas. They would obviously have to be more cautious in distribution of resources in that case and give it more efficient places than others as small level businessman are more successful in UP and less in kerala and Rajasthan  (you can check that on internet it\'s a true stat) as distribution of wealth and subsidies have not worked most of the times and on the expense of big companies going down may be quite dangerous. And of course our government would do a lot more better if it would let go of some the PSI (except those of course which have ownership of natural resources over a region like Coal India and Bharat Petroleum) and selling the railways in such a manner that no single new owner of the railways assets would have dominance over a zone and should be more competition based as it\'s in Germany and Sweden. This won\'t happen in a month of course not even in a year but they really get down to liberate India from its socialist economic policies and move to a more capitalist de centralised free market economy as Modi have been doing for some time now. They should even change NCERT SST books while at it. \nAnd the most important and feasible goal that they achieve during this is it make deals with foreign nations to provide for things as we can supply and be more reasonable in making deals as we have leverage over almost every nation from Japan to Canada. Foreign companies are moving out of China as they have closed their economy and japan is even paying companies to bring manufacturing plants out of China, things are really fortunate for India if India manages to stay out of stage 3 of the epidemic. I may be wrong or they might actually be in the works of it but this is just an opinion.\n\nEdit-\nPS. - those cucks on a "certain infamous Indian sub" are not Indians, I was banned once before for calling Sonia Gandhi a whore and I again tried to post it there to reach more audience with another account but those socialist NPCs banned me again.'<br />Author: 'ThunderDog-'  id: 'g19ksf'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g19ksf/do_you_think_its_the_right_time_plan_changes_in/</li>

But people still co-operated, hoping they'd be able to go home on the 15th. But now another 3 week lockdown has been announced. What is the point of all this? Why are they banning an essential service like transportation facilities. Hell even liquor shops are now allowed to operate, what nonsense is this. Before you say it's for the revenue, even air travel would bring a significant amount of revenue.\n\nIf it's the spread of coronavirus they're worried about, shouldn't they have allowed people to go home before they announced the first lockdown, when the cases were in triple digits? Even now why aren't they allowing domestic air travel? They can easily limit the capacity of the plane and have everyone tested before being allowed to board. At some point they HAVE to allow air travel, and by then the spread of the virus will be much greater, compared to if they allowed travel now. \n\nNot to mention there are people stuck abroad with no idea what the government is planning. Announcing such a big decision at the last possible second is a very pathetic move. \n\nOn a separate but relevant note, I'm very disappointed in Hardeep Singh Puri and his department. He had announced that flights can start taking bookings for the 15th. Why did he make such an announcement? Almost every flight started taking bookings (except Air India of course, they clearly had insider knowledge beforehand about the lockdown extension). People are not even getting their full refunds back. Money is such an important thing right, seeing how many people are losing their jobs.\n\n\n\nI'd like to hear what this sub thinks about this decision.

Please give suggestions, strategies and ideas.'<br />Body: "Edit: Some  problems and solutions mentioned in comments and my additions to them mentioned in the end\n\nIn last few weeks, we have seen an particular religion consciously and deliberately try to spread the virus in India. They have attacked Healthcare workers and police. The governments in power, especially Central, has NOT PUT IT'S FOOT DOWN. They have even refused to talk about it. \n\nBJP and RSS are not taken any measure against this. Efforts to spread Covid 19 in India seem **deliberate and malicious.** But, there is no response. **Aranab and random TV Channel anchors are more angry than the Hindutva party.**\n\nSince, the chances of a real Hindutva party rising are low in the near future and not voting for BJP means letting Congress win. **Please give some suggestions, strategies and ways to put pressure on BJP to fulfill their Hindutva agenda. US politics is a great example. They have hundreds of pressure groups, grassroot movements which force the parties to change their ways. Political parties want to win elections more than anything else.**\n\nMany groups are there working in public for Hindus but we need an political arm and right now we have only BJP. So, we should think of ways to strengthen it.\n\nEdit: some problems and solutions mentioned in comments and my additions to them :\n\n**Problem**\n1. BJP leaders crave attention and acceptance from Secular Lutyens lobby instead of their own Hindu votebank and Hindu lobby.\n2. They assume Muslims are just waiting for the right message and leader and will become BJP voters and support Indian nationalism. \n3. Vote for hardliners like Yogi but the problem is how to get them tickets. **Party, not voters, gives tickets to nominees. And how to make them do the work?** Sadhvi Pragya is hard right but where is the work in Parliament? Inane speeches do more harm than good. \n4. Any Hindu organization is still very powerless 8n face of the government and secular courts. The BJP-RSS govt will not help them and the **secular media, Police and courts will always harass them**\n5. Law against hurting religious sentiment and religious discrimination will be ALWAYS used Hindus if they put Hindu interests firsts. \n6. In order to separate Islam from Muslim, challenges to Islam in intellectual and media circles is needed. Very difficult without govt protection and support against random murder and riots against the people doing the hard work. Legal cases are least of the problems. \n\n**Solution**\n1. Shame and pressurise the MLAs and MPs about their craveness towards the Left lobby and how they abuse and ignore Hindu publications and media. **Point this out especially during elections when they beg for votes in name of Hindutva.** Like in recent Tejasvi Surya.\n2. Maintain record of Muslim voting patterns and ask for answers from BJP about this. Where is the RSS Muslim Manch during TJ-COVID crisis? Force them to answer and defend their stupidity.\n3. Make some kind **Hindu lobby or talent group to give real legal and political input for these hardcore Hindu MPs can implement**or some laws and problems they can bring up in Parliament. Example US lobbists and pressure group regularly write laws and speeches that politicians just repeat in Congress.\n4. Raise voices about injustice towards Hindus on public forums and **force bjp and RSS to acknowledge them**.\n5. Create parallel Hindu groups in field of law, education, history, publishing, business so they can do the work RSS ignores. \n6. Create some grassroot movements where Hindutva support is more like Gujrat, Uttarakhand, HP etc. This will help the local politicians and they won't be able to ignore a united and aware Hindu votebank. **It will also create completion in local politicians to favor Hindus, if they get votes they can ignore the hight command of their party.**\n7. **Demand specific changes in specific laws, create petions, marches and get your local MLAs, MPs, random BJP guy to either PUBLICLY support it or say no to IT.**\n8. Make efforts to Muslims and Islam. Reduce the arabization of Muslims and if possible convert them out of the cult. It will need some kind atheistic movement that led to deChristianized Europe after World War 2. It will need sustained efforts in media, intellectuals, mass media like films, books, and education. Point out the illogical and hateful nature of Islam at mass scale."<br />Author: 'anujjv51'  id: 'g15it0'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g15it0/how_to_put_pressure_on_bjp_and_rss_so_they_will/</li>

This car turned 5 today, and what a great companion it has been. We have other cars in the family, but this one remains my favorite, and even my dad loves it. It is super-nimble and comfortable, in fact, more comfortable than my Hyundai Xcent (I bought it in 2018 because it runs on CNG and is very cheap to run). The Nano seats in the front were designed for people who are 6 footers, and everyone gets surprised to be able to stretch their legs.\n\n[Looks like new after 5 years](https://preview.redd.it/pz2xq5ei8rs41.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59f88851488243462284ed6ffbb427a0181a376e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Nano is amongst the most famous Indian engineering products globally. Yes, a lot of folks in India shun the car because it "makes them feel cheap" and they\'d rather buy a 3 lakh rupee bike or an expensive car on EMI to look cool. But when I did my MBA abroad, the Nano was the only Indian case study that was taught. People abroad love to investigate the innovations in the Nano, and at the same time look at it as a marketing failure because it did not highlight the "aspirational value" associated with owning a car in India.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0is797yl8rs41.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddaa24a8e8a998431990249ef7402447d1923d7a\n\n5 years of ownership experience has been great. Tata service in the area I live in is superb- . They take the car from our house for service and deliver it back at no extra cost.\n\nThe Nano is a marvel, not only because of its price but because of the space it offers and the extremely innovative packaging. You won\'t feel tired even after full-day drives, which is not the case in most small cars. The AC is superb, the fuel efficiency is around 14 in the city and over 20 on highways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0i0b7amc9rs41.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67639de8d153b0374bce7e81e3be6f184d3c8e84\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome people say that the "nano is unsafe and I\'d rather travel in an Uber than be seen driving one".  I have never been in an accident in one, but I don\'t exceed 60-70kph on any road, and try being as careful a driver as the road allows. Airbags would have been great, but even without them, I feel safer in a Nano than an Alto.\n\nI wish Tata takes the lessons of the Nano forward and brings out more innovative products. Sadly, in India, innovation does not sell. People are more concerned about looking rich.\n\nIf you\'re looking for an inexpensive used car, the Nano is a great option.

Most of the small temples are run by the donations received from the devotees visiting the temple. There are Priests who’s monthly salary is around Rs 1000 to Rs 2000, while some from the smaller temples even have salaries less than Rs 1000. Their households depend on the daily donations given by the devotees visiting the temples. The lockdown for combating the Covid – 19 pandemic has almost stopped the flow of devotees to temples pushing the temple priests into poverty. The economic slowdown created by the epidemic also drains the coffers of many temple committees that support the daily rituals of the temples. In worst of the worst times like these, it is our dharma to extend a helping hand to defend the lives of our civilisation’s torchbearers.\n\n&gt; **Saiva Shashtra Prachara Sabha wants to help out more than 100 temple priests who survive on a salary less than Rs 2000 per month.**\n\n**Goal of the Campaign** \n\n&gt; The goal of the campaign is to send a stipend of Rs 3000 for a poor temple priest.

When Lord Kṛṣṇa spoke the Bhagavad-gītā, it appears that such philosophers existed, and they were known as the Lokāyatikas and Vaibhāṣikas. These philosophers maintained that life symptoms, or soul, takes place at a certain mature condition of material combination. The modern material scientist and materialist philosophers also think similarly. According to them, the body is a combination of physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms develop by interaction of the physical and chemical elements. The science of anthropology is based on this philosophy. Currently, many pseudo-religions—now becoming fashionable in America—are also adhering to this philosophy, as well as to the nihilistic nondevotional Buddhist sects.\n\nEven if Arjuna did not believe in the existence of the soul—as in the Vaibhāṣika philosophy—there would still have been no cause for lamentation. No one laments the loss of a certain bulk of chemicals and stops discharging his prescribed duty. On the other hand, in modern science and scientific warfare, so many tons of chemicals are wasted for achieving victory over the enemy. According to the Vaibhāṣika philosophy, the so-called soul or ātmā vanishes along with the deterioration of the body. So, in any case, whether Arjuna accepted the Vedic conclusion that there is an atomic soul, or whether he did not believe in the existence of the soul, he had no reason to lament. According to this theory, since there are so many living entities generating out of matter every moment, and so many of them are being vanquished every moment, there is no need to grieve for such an incidence. However, since he was not risking rebirth of the soul, Arjuna had no reason to be afraid of being affected with sinful reactions due to his killing his grandfather and teacher. But at the same time, Kṛṣṇa sarcastically addressed Arjuna as mahā-bāhu, mighty-armed, because He, at least, did not accept the theory of the Vaibhāṣikas, which leaves aside the Vedic wisdom. As a kṣatriya, Arjuna belonged to the Vedic culture, and it behooved him to continue to follow its principles.\n\n**Question 1 : Who are Lokāyatikas and Vaibhāṣikas ? What is their philosophy ? Why Kṛṣṇa addressed Arjuna as mahā-bāhu ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wc4fe66g0ps41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6450d7062e8a2717829e99e9bade8a187e376d0c\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'g0wxj1'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g0wxj1/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_226/</li>

While China and India have a similar population, China has a far longer expressway system which tends to be designed more efficiently (fewer accidents) with better quality (more durable, more stops along the way with more facilites) and more lanes in general. Pakistan, on the other hand, has 1/6th the population of India but has a longer motorway system but still, it is far behind China.\n\nThis isn't a very fair comparison as there are more things to consider, Pakistan has a worse railway system than India and fewer airports even after adjusting for population. Some motorways in Pakistan are of better quality than India but some are in worse condition like the half-completed M-8 motorway and the M-9 and M-10 motorways aren't of a similar quality. China, on the other hand, has a far better railway system, more airports, etc. than both India and Pakistan. Although, India and Pakistan are both working on their respective railway systems, they are still behind (Pakistan is taking China's help in doing so). The need for longer expressways in China is crucial as it's more than 3 times the size of India (controlled area of 9,634,205 sq km vs 3,166,391 sq km) while some high-speed railway routes aren't as beneficial (but China still funds high-speed railway lines which lead to losses due to integration of far-off provinces) because of longer distances in some areas like in USA where airplanes are more preferred."<br />Author: 'keu7ovfa11sttss'  id: 'g0knfo'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g0knfo/comparison_of_expresswaymotorway_system_of/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Learn Something New - Google Ads - Part 5'<br />Body: '**Google Ads Editor and Search Ads — Learn Google Ads Basics**\n\nHi everyone. I hope everyone is safe. It is important that we stay indoors and stay safe during this lockdown if we want to beat COVID-19. Please don\'t believe in rumors and be help each other out. Continuing my series of posts about learning Google Ads, today we look at how to easily create campaigns in Google Ads using the Google Ads Editor tool and take a look at creating search ads. Here is the [Medium Link](https://medium.com/@sngrmtawade/google-ads-editor-and-search-ads-learn-google-ads-basics-a35197134f23)\n\nWe left off our last post by creating an account structure consisting of Campaigns, Ad Groups and Keywords. We can create a campaign either through the Google Ads site itself or by using the Google Ads Editor tool. Let’s first start with the Google Ads Editor.\n\n**Google Ads Editor**\n\nIt is a software created by Google which is free of charge and lets you quickly make massive changes to your Google Ads account offline. To download it, you can visit this page and you can read a bit more about it there.\n\n**Connecting to Google Ads**\n\n* Once you are done downloading, open it up and you will be greeted with this screen[Reference](https://imgur.com/K4f1EJ2)\n\n* Click on “Add” to begin connecting the Google Ads account you just created. There are two ways to sign in. Just choose the “Use In App Browser to Sign In” option as it is simpler[Reference](https://imgur.com/uN8kiny)\n\n* Complete the sign in process by entering your e-mail ID and password that you used for creating the Google Ads account. Once you have done that you will be prompted to download your account[Reference](https://imgur.com/QhIWna9). Select “All Campaigns” and hit “Ok”. The Google Ads account should open up [like so](https://imgur.com/jD3KAf2)\n\n**Uploading Your Campaigns**\n\n* Go back to the sheet where you added all the campaigns, ad groups and keywords and copy the entire table[Reference](https://imgur.com/3eq27lP)\n\n* Go back to Google Ads Editor and click on “Keywords and targeting” as [shown here](https://imgur.com/VNExTMc)\n\n* Make sure “Keywords” is selected and then click on “Make multiple changes”[Reference](https://imgur.com/BlVFYSg)\n\n* On the window that opens up make sure that “My data includes columns for campaigns and/or ad groups.” is selected under destination[Reference](https://imgur.com/CXf96ap)\n\n* Click on the first cell of the table [next to it](https://imgur.com/DBD81Km) and paste your data[Reference](https://imgur.com/UOEBStX)\n\n* Each column you just pasted should automatically get the header if you named them correctly in the excel. But if not, then simply click on the drop down and select the correct column name[Reference](https://imgur.com/QCkyJ76). Make sure to have the “Campaigns”, “Ad Group” “Keyword” and “Criterion Type” columns\n\n* Click on “Process”[Reference](https://imgur.com/TXq8UcE)\n\n* It should process the data without any issues and show you a summary screen of what all has been created. Click on “Finish and review changes”[Reference](https://imgur.com/YbUiQ1L)\n\n* You will see that your campaigns, ad groups and keywords have been created automatically for you[Reference](https://imgur.com/KuKTRYW)\n\n* Click on “Keep” at the top, so that you can start taking the next steps[Reference](https://imgur.com/ByT0ap4)\n\n* Select “Campaigns” on the left hand side and then press “Ctrl+A” to select all the campaigns in here. We start selecting the correct settings for the a search campaign[Reference](https://imgur.com/FRzaLST)\n\n* On the right hand side, the first thing you need to do is add a daily budget. This is the amount you are willing to spend on your campaigns on a daily basis. It is up to you to decide this amount. Just make sure it is enough to cover your keywords’ cost per click (CPC) [Reference](https://imgur.com/OtUnj5N)\n\n* Next, you will notice a warning sign next to “Bid Strategy”. Leave it as it is for now. It should say “Manual CPC”. This leaves some control in your hands on deciding keyword bids [Reference](https://imgur.com/rYZmKga)\n\n* Next, since you are creating a search campaign, disable “Include Display Network”. We don’t want to target two different networks in the same campaign as they behave differently [Reference](https://imgur.com/HOUDjzQ)\n\n* Next, scroll down a little and select the settings as shown in the image below. This will help you make sure that people outside your service area don’t see the ad [Reference](https://imgur.com/h27DCFp)\n\n* Click on “Ad Group” from the left column and select them all (ctrl+a) [Reference](https://imgur.com/gfDYARV)\n\n* Go to “Default max CPC” on the right and add a CPC you are willing to pay here. I usually put in the highest “Top of the page CPC” figure the research suggests. But here the highest is a bit too much so I have selected the second highest. Just make sure each ad group has been assigned a value, this should. This should automatically add the same CPC to all the keywords inside [Reference](https://imgur.com/F7jGigX)\n\n* Next, scroll down to the left hand side and select “Location” [Reference](https://imgur.com/AXDitU7)\n\n* Select all the locations you see here [Reference](https://imgur.com/ir52oN1)\n\n* On the right hand side, enter the location you want to target and hit enter. This should change all the selected locations as well [Reference](https://imgur.com/f8WUZZg)\n\n* Now, click on the pencil icon next to the location and in the window that opens up, click “Find Location” [Reference](https://imgur.com/XBkrXqL)\n\n* Select your desired location from the list Google throws out and click “Ok” at the bottom. In most cases your location should show up here. If it doesn’t, you might have to expand your area a bit [Reference](https://imgur.com/uuNRMdI)\n\n* If you want to add more locations, make sure all the campaigns you want to add them to are selected and hit “Add Location” [Reference](https://imgur.com/4ttbga6)\n\n* Select all the campaigns you want to add it to [Reference](https://imgur.com/FsETLxq)\n\n* Enter the location and go through the same process we discussed above to confirm the location selection [Reference](https://imgur.com/HiwrADZ)\n\n* The locations are properly targeted when the ID and Reach estimates show up next to it\n\nNow let’s take a quick look at creating Google Search Ads.\n\n**Google Search Ad**\n\nAll the things we have done so far were only the back-end settings and the searcher will never see them. What he does see is the search ad that shows up after typing in a search query. So you have to make sure that this best represents your business.\n\nThe search ad that shows up on the Google page can consist of headlines, descriptions, web page URL and various extensions to the ads. There are a couple of types of text ads you can create in Google Ads.\n\n**Text Ad**\n\nThe regular text ad is the most commonly used. It consists of:\n[Reference](https://imgur.com/fjd63Lc)\n\n* Headlines: We can add up to 3 headlines to a text ad. All of them don’t always show up and it depends on Google when to show them. The headlines can be up to 30 characters in length\n\n* Descriptions: We can add 2 description lines here. Again, Google might not show both together all the time. They can be up to 90 characters in length\n\n* Path: Are optional fields you can add which show up with the URL and help the searcher get a better sense of where they are going. They don’t have to match the actual website URL. You can add up to 2 custom paths and each can be up to 15 characters in length\n\n**Responsive Search Ad**\n\nTo the searcher it will show up as a regular search ad with at most three headlines and two descriptions. But you can add:\n\n* Up to 15 headlines which can have up to 30 characters each\n\n* Up to 4 descriptions which can have up to 90 characters each\n\n* Up to 2 path fields which can be up to 15 characters in length\n\nGoogle will then mix and match these headlines and descriptions to create a text ad which can contain up to 3 headlines and up to 2 descriptions. But you have to be a bit careful when using responsive search ads as the headlines and descriptions can appear in any location and the final results might not always make sense. Google does give us the option to pin headlines and description to certain positions (headline 1, 2 or 3 and description 1 or 2). Generally, I use both these ad types in my ad groups. Google advises us to use at least 2 regular text ads and 1 responsive text ad. Read more about both these types of ads [here](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704389?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=3119117) and [here](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7684791?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=3119117).\n\n**Ad Extensions**\n\nYou may have noticed in the screen grab above that the ad contains a bit more than just headlines and descriptions. It contains what Google calls extensions. Extensions add more information about your business giving the searchers more reason to click on your ads. Here is an [article](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/06/03/adwords-ad-extensions-cheat-sheet) that goes into details about each. It would be great if you could add all the extensions to your ads, but for most purposes, just “Sitelink Extensions”, “Callout Extensions”, “Structured Snippets” and “Call Extensions” would do.\n\n**Sitelink Extensions**\nThese are extensions to the ad which take the searcher to different parts of your website\n\n**Callout Extensions**\nWith these, you can tell the searcher what is unique about your product or service\n\n**Structured Snippets**\nHighlight specific aspects of your products or service, like the destinations you book travel for, the amenities of your hotel, etc\n\n**Call Extensions**\nThese let you add phone numbers to your ad. Searchers can then click on it to give you a call\n\n**Creating Regular Text Ad**\n\n* Head back to Google Ads Editor and click on the small triangle next to the campaign [reference](https://imgur.com/bGmxsSk)\n\n* Select one of the ad groups [Reference](https://imgur.com/0ugJOqF)\n\n* On the left side column below, click on the “Ads” and select “Expanded text ads”. Don’t select “Text Ads” as those are old format ads and you can no longer create them [Reference](https://imgur.com/gq76KB6)\n\n* Click on “Add Expanded Text Ad” [Reference](https://imgur.com/6cfdOhE)\n\n* Select the blank ad that just came up and copy it by clicking “ctrl+c” [Reference](https://imgur.com/dNLjKYQ)\n\n* Paste it in an Excel sheet and delete the ad from Google Ads Editor by selecting it and pressing “Delete” key [Reference](https://imgur.com/v2ZUKH2)\n\n* Get rid of everything after “Final URL” and then get rid of “Ad Type” and “Label” [Reference](https://imgur.com/ixsEeSN) [Reference](https://imgur.com/aXzGUZi)\n\n* Copy all your ad groups and paste them under the “Ad Group” column. Also make sure to paste their relevant campaigns under the “Campaign” column [Reference](https://imgur.com/mdW4h3h)\n\n* Remember the self and competitor analysis that you did earlier? Simply use that to write an ad copy by filling in the headlines and descriptions here. Make sure you keep in mind the character limitations [Reference](https://imgur.com/3QmVXRk) [Reference](https://imgur.com/a6OPP9t)\n\n* Create at least two ad copies for each ad group. Copy the final table in excel by click “ctrl+c”\n\n* Head back to Google Ads editor, make sure “Expanded Text Ads” is selected on the left and click on “Make multiple changes” [Reference](https://imgur.com/fi1vhQJ)\n\n* Select “My data columns for campaigns and/or ad groups” and paste the ads you just created in the table [Reference](https://imgur.com/3ibbfjD)\n\n* Make sure all the column headers are in place. In case they aren’t select the relevant one from the drop down and hit “process” [Reference](https://imgur.com/rDChDmg)\n\n* Click “Finish and review changes” and keep all the changes [Reference](https://imgur.com/m22KsVk)\n\n* Go through each and every ad group and ensure that all the ads have been imported and then hit “Keep” [Reference](https://imgur.com/g583Ydg)\n\n**Creating Responsive Search Ads**\n\n* Select one of the ad groups like we did when creating a regular text ad and select “Responsive search ads” on the left [Reference](https://imgur.com/lwUdnwG)\n\n* Click “Add responsive search ad” and copy the blank ad, just like before in an empty excel sheet [Reference](https://imgur.com/2gLXdBF)\n\n* In the excel, get rid of “Ad Type” and “Labels” [Reference](https://imgur.com/tfTT6v7)\n\n* Also, get rid of everything after “Final URL” [Reference](https://imgur.com/pCDpBgG)\n\n* Copy and paste the campaigns, ad groups, headline 1, paths and final URLs from the regular text ad sheet [Reference](https://imgur.com/9jA44q7)\n\n* These ads give you the option to pin headlines to either position 1, 2 or 3 and descriptions to position 1 or 2. Pin the headline 1 to the first position by typing in “1” in the column next to it[Reference](https://imgur.com/5ZwqwLb)\n\n* Fill in as many headlines and as many descriptions as you can. Remember the character length limitations. Pin which ever headline or description you think is appropriate [Reference](https://imgur.com/6YIiJSS)\n\n* Copy this table, make sure you have “Responsive text ad” selected in the editor and select “Make multiple changes” [Reference](https://imgur.com/QSV6UT3)\n\n* Ensure that “My data includes columns for campaigns and/or ad groups” is selected and paste the ads in the table [Reference](https://imgur.com/me9KVW8)\n\n* Make sure all the headers are there and hit “Process”. Hit “Finish and review changes” [Reference](https://imgur.com/govVEWn)\n\n**Creating Ad Extensions**\n\n* Click on “Shared Library” on the left hand side [Reference](https://imgur.com/SBv4jYa)\n\n* Select “Shared sitelinks” and click “Add shared sitelink” [Reference](https://imgur.com/fRqXP34)\n\n* Add in “Link Text” (which is the headline for the sitelink), description 1, description 2 and the final URL. You may see a warning next to “Destination URL” but those are no longer accepted and it should go away after you add the final URL [Reference](https://imgur.com/Jm1faC5)\n\n* Create at least 3 more extensions leading to different parts of your website [Reference](https://imgur.com/oUYXQ6J)\n\n* Similarly, select “Callout extensions” on the left and click on “Add shared callout extension” [Reference](https://imgur.com/6IHnt1L)\n\n* Enter the text in the given space [Reference](https://imgur.com/6sVkvlN)\n\n* Add at least 4 more [Reference](https://imgur.com/5Qi2hbj)\n\n* Select “Structured Snippets” on the left and click on “Add structured snippet extension” [Reference](https://imgur.com/2BYlIGR)\n\n* Select your language settings and choose the header. Here since the example is promoting digital marketing services, we select “service catalog”. Finally add values in the given section [Reference](https://imgur.com/ktMyQlz)\n\n* Select “Call Extension”, click on “Add Shared Call Extension” and add your phone details as shown in the below example [Reference](https://imgur.com/EV11N2I)\n\n* To add these extensions to your campaigns select “Ad Extension” under "Manage" on the left and then select “Sitelinks” [Reference](https://imgur.com/SZj5FTv)\n\n* Click on “Add sitelink” at the top and select “Account Level” [Reference](https://imgur.com/CnnfZ6u)\n\n* Select all the sitelinks you just created and hit “Ok”. This will add them to all active campaigns [Reference](https://imgur.com/paMs26l)\n\n* Repeat this process for callout, structured snippet and call extensions [Reference](https://imgur.com/sqhkrM3)\n\n**Posting To Google Ads**\n\n* You should now be ready to post your completed search campaign to Google Ads\n\n* Click on “Post” in the right hand corner [Reference](https://imgur.com/jxDDByU)\n\n* Select “All Campaigns” and hit “Post” [Reference](https://imgur.com/fgwfDq5)\n\n* The posting process should start and when done, that’s it!

      <li>Title::: "Statements from ISRC (Indian Scientist's Response To COVID-19) On Tablighi Jamaat event [dated 08 April 2020]"<br />Body: 'https://indscicov.in/about-isrc/for-public/public-statements/\n\nOver the past few days, several prominent media personalities and politicians have suggested that the primary blame for the continued growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in India lies with a Tablighi Jamaat event that was held in Delhi on March 13. The available data does not support such a speculation.\n\nWe strongly condemn any attempt to communalize the pandemic. We draw attention to the World Health Organization’s statement that it is “very important that we do not profile the cases on the basis of racial, religious and ethnic lines.” This is also reflected in the statement by the Ministry of Health which says “Do not label any community or area for spread of COVID-19.”\n\nWe believe, while the Tablighi Jamaat erred by not cancelling the event, the administrative lapse of the Central and Delhi governments must be acknowledged, as this was a pre-approved event and certain arms of the government were aware that foreigners from infected countries would be participating.\n\nSuper spreader events have also taken place in other countries and even in India. For instance a single (now deceased) patient in Punjab led to the quarantining of 40,000 people from 20 villages in Punjab. Those who contract the virus in such an event, or spread it unintentionally, are themselves victims of the epidemic. They must not be demonized.\n\nThe actual number of infected across the country is believed to be far larger than the number of cases that have been confirmed so far. The effects of the Delhi event on the growth rate of the all India numbers may thus be significantly less than the numbers put out by MoHFW.\n\nThe Government has not released data on how many tests were conducted among the attendees of this event and their contacts. Thus, we do not know how the fraction of tests that were found to be positive in this case compares to testing on the general population. We call on the government to release this data.\n\nWe reiterate our call for the government to collect more data\n— by testing more — and to transparently share this data with the public'<br />Author: 'heloouwu'  id: 'g0hu4c'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g0hu4c/statements_from_isrc_indian_scientists_response/</li>

One of the biggest casualties of this uncertainty has been the graduating class of 2020.  \nIndian students in the US have it especially rough. They need to secure a job offer in the next 2-3 months to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT), **failing which they'll have to head back to India**.\n\nMy friend, Kunal is struggling to find a job offer in time for OPT. He is graduating from Texas A&amp;M University and is talking to 40+ companies. But all companies told him that they have paused hiring.\n\nIn fact, [3000+ US companies have reportedly frozen hiring](https://candor.co/hiring-freezes/). Indians in the US have to secure a job offer in a very limited time and challenging circumstances - failing which their visa will no longer be valid.\xa0\n\nTo tackle this, we feel extending the OPT deadline to 180 days will allow students more time to get recruited in these extenuating circumstances.\n\nWe have launched a [petition](https://www.change.org/optextension) to make our voice heard!!

I read Shriramcharitmanas a couple of years ago and heard from Grandma many, many years before that, and the image of Shree Ram in my mind was that of a bright warrior that was kind fierce at the same time.\n\nRam was probably the gentlest man who ever walked on earth. When he\'s hurt, he cries. When he\'s happy, he gets overwhelmed with it and expresses. He embraces the enemies and shows them kindness. He forgives his (step)- mother with unkind intentions. He chooses to sacrifice his life\'s 14 years just to keep his father\'s promise. He walks thousands of kilometers to win his wife kidnapped by Ravan.\n\nStill, so much hatred? I know some might argue about the Sita Vanvas, but AFAIK, there are ample evidence that suggest the last chapter was probably not written by Valmiki himself and still remains a controversial addition to the original works. So, to put your faith in just one controversial chapter just to hate on the man is too much. It\'s like the haters are trying to hard to prove he\'s "insecure, misogynistic" man and somehow deserves this hate.'<br />Author: 'FleurFlakes'  id: 'g0dyoa'<br />Score:32<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g0dyoa/how_come_of_all_the_hindu_deities_only_ram_gets/</li>

Knowing this, you should not grieve for the body.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nAs described previously, the magnitude of the soul is so small for our material calculation that he cannot be seen even by the most powerful microscope; therefore, he is invisible. As far as the soul's existence is concerned, no one can establish his existence experimentally beyond the proof of śruti or Vedic wisdom. We have to accept this truth, because there is no other source of understanding the existence of the soul, although it is a fact by perception. There are many things we have to accept solely on grounds of superior authority. No one can deny the existence of his father, based upon the authority of his mother. There is no other source of understanding the identity of the father except by the authority of the mother. Similarly, there is no other source of understanding the soul except by studying the Vedas. In other words, the soul is inconceivable by human experimental knowledge. The soul is consciousness and conscious—that also is the statement of the Vedas, and we have to accept that. Unlike the bodily changes, there is no change in the soul. As eternally unchangeable, the soul remains atomic in comparison to the infinite Supreme Soul. The Supreme Soul is infinite, and the atomic soul is infinitesimal. Therefore, the infinitesimal soul, being unchangeable, can never become equal to the infinite soul, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This concept is repeated in the Vedas in different ways just to confirm the stability of the conception of the soul. Repetition of something is necessary in order that we understand the matter thoroughly without error.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the difference between the soul and the Supersoul ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vh527hjkyhs41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a611e05b623b7f366e83fe882a6283486b7b9f0e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'g0a30g'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g0a30g/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_225/</li>

In the Varāha Purāṇa, the living entities are described as separated parts and parcels of the Supreme. They are eternally so, according to the Bhagavad-gītā also.

Please read more before you come to an opinion.'<br />Body: "Economy : with Demonetization, it took 80+% cash circulation out of the system and the growth rate fell to 5 and continued to decline. The whole thing ended up looking like breaking apart the whole house to catch a rat (black money). \n\nReligious angle : Neither could they help persecuted minorities in neighbouring countries nor could they even convey the message of what those laws mean, to an average Indian and to the world just leaving people to play with the narrative and change it at will. Modi most of the times take actions but doesn't interact with the nation immediately and leave people to handle the aftermath themselves. \n\nWith this coronavirus epidemic changing the fate of millions of people directly and indirectly, we're not ready to handle the aftermath. I even doubt if the government can utilise this situation and break supply chains, set up local manufacturing. \n\nDay by day, we have BJP MLAs and MPs taking the nation and Hinduism into gutter with their unbelievable public statements. One politician jokes about marrying Kashmiri girls in a sensitive period like article 370 removal (the law was much needed and is a good move by BJP). One guy throws a gomutra party. One minister says that Britain's prince got recovered because of Ayurveda and them rejecting it.. one can go on and on like this. Hell I even chose relatively decent ones to write here for my own sanity. \n\nThe man at the center should have gone live and clearly explain (shown few things if necessary) the point that justifies the newly proposed laws (CAA and others) to the whole nation (make it available for the whole nation in all languages), sound friendly while doing it and leave no one with a doubt of what they could mean and give them a reason to create an alternative narrative. If he could have such command and charisma, he would have dealt with the unnecessary violence like any other country would instead of just letting people play gta on roads. He should have also asked his politicians long back to not rile up emotions and encourage people to be progressive and financial oriented.\n\n\nBest way of solving social (caste system) and religious evils is to create truck load of opportunities for everyone and make sure they stay busy doing right things. Of course it may take a cycle of whole generation for these issues to disappear but government shouldn't just give up and play into these or not strengthen them at least. While we're at it, he should have banned missionaries that take advantage of poor people and convert them and come up with a way to restrict birth rates for every community.\n\nLast but not the least, this sub should just drop it's fantasy of loading muslims into a truck and dropping them off at the border. It's neither realistic nor moral. This kind of circle jerk which is getting more popular even made few guys say stupid things while living in gulf and got kicked out (escaped lucky). This circle jerk would only radicalize Indian muslims and keep the country in an internal war forever. A man in the center and his men who can do the necessary work (not what you're thinking but just creating overall equality which would remove the insecurities of both Hindus and Muslims and take us back to a truly secular country minus the bias that Congress groomed) in the background and can keep the nation look stable, safe and welcoming, is the way for us to solve 90% of our problems without even trying. While BJP is successful in garnering huge support by choosing a certain path, it's incompetence at the ground work is costing us everything. \n\nWhile I'm not going to pass any counter arguments to yours in comments, I'm eager to see what you guys think about it and please do share your perspective 🙏."<br />Author: 'Vigilante678'  id: 'fzx7hf'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fzx7hf/unpopular_opinion_bjp_government_turned_the_whole/</li>

The amount of social and peer pressure we have to handle is immense. We aren't allowed to fail in life, it's found upon that the men have to take care of the whole house and his parents and his sisters. We have no option of an easy way, whereas girls you can just marry a decent guy. Now the feminist community would rip my asshole apart and put some brain there but if a man is born bump or just fails it's not acceptable to the society we have to have a multi-hundred rupees stable job and a secure bank account. It's relatively very easy for a girl right now. If you are dumb or can't get a good job. All you have to do it work on your body look good. And you are married to a decent desperate man. (In most cases) that's where you need to be a little smart and chose a decent guy and your life is set! And I am not saying you have to be a housewife you could still work or do some shit you want, but you still don't have the life-threatening pressure of being an ideal man to the society. Even if you marry a touch guy if you are smart enough you can bend him. It's a reality of life that no one really talks about it's always just the man's fault.

      <li>Title::: 'Comprehensive update on COVID testing in India. Hopefully, this answers all your testing questions.'<br />Body: "I had some free time over the last couple of days, so researched this to answer some questions people were asking.\n\n### Testing strategy\n\n* **Stage 2 zones:** Those with symptoms if they are: Hospitalized patients, international travellers, low risk contacts of confirmed cases, medical workers. Those without symptoms if they are: High risk contacts of confirmed cases.\n\n* **Stage 3 zones (Also for large migrant gatherings):** In addition to above, RT-PCR testing of everyone with flu symptoms within 7 days of symptoms, or antibody tests if more than 7 days have passed (and if positive, an RT-PCR test to confirm).\n\n[Source](https://icmr.nic.in/sites/default/files/upload_documents/Strategey_for_COVID19_Test_v4_09042020.pdf)\n\n\n### Why use antibody tests\n\nAntibody tests detect if you've ever had exposure to the virus (but can't tell if you're currently ill, for which an RT-PCR test is needed). Recovered patients can be given a certificate for free movement and re-enter the economy as they cannot act as carriers. Antibody tests are 40-60% cheaper and more scalable as they don't require labs or training and produce results in 15-30 mins ([source](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/how-rapid-antibody-tests-are-different-from-existing-pcr-tests-for-covid-19-explained-1663441-2020-04-05)).\n\n\n### Testing capacity \n\n**Planned capacity:**\n\n* ICMR plans to increase it to 100,000 RT-PCR per day ([source](https://www.cnbctv18.com/healthcare/india-gets-ready-to-test-1-lakh-samples-per-day-for-coronavirus-5639191.htm)). \n* We are already using test pooling now ([source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/healthcare/pool-testing-planned-to-speed-up-results-cut-workload-of-labs/articleshow/75090258.cms)). This uses a binary search algorithm to screen multiple people with one test. It is particularly effective in countries like India where the % of tests which are positive is very low. In Germany, it is expected to increase testing capacity immediately by a factor of 5 to 10 [source](https://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-03/guf-pto033020.php) (so probably 10 in India).\n\nCombining the two, the effective testing capacity of India should be a 5-10 times 100,000 in the days to come.\n\nAntibody tests should be over and above this.\n\n**Current capacity:** \n\n|*Tester*|*Capacity per shift*|*Max shifts*|*Daily total*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|151 \\* Govt. labs|90|2|27180|\n|68 \\* Pvt. labs|90|1|6120|\n|2 \\* Cobass-6800 (automated)|NA|NA|2800||\n|400 \\* MolBio machines|NA|NA|5000|\n\nTotal ~ 40K (rounded down for possible errors in estimate)\n\nSources: The list of labs is on ICMR website, [source](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/icmr-to-get-10-lakh-testing-kits/article31273367.ece) for Cobass-6800, [source](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/icmr-approves-tb-machines-for-covid-19-testing/article31258604.ece) for MolBio's portable machines (guesstimated and halved the final number since only half the machines are with the government).

Antibody tests numbers not included in daily ICMR testing numbers.

He is everlasting, all-pervading, unchangeable, immovable and eternally the same.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nAll these qualifications of the atomic soul definitely prove that the individual soul is eternally the atomic particle of the spirit whole, and he remains the same atom eternally, without change. The theory of monism is very difficult to apply in this case, because the individual soul is never expected to become one homogeneously. After liberation from material contamination, the atomic soul may prefer to remain as a spiritual spark in the effulgent rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the intelligent souls enter into the spiritual planets to associate with the Personality of Godhead.\n\nThe word sarva-gataḥ (all-pervading) is significant because there is no doubt that living entities are all over God's creation. They live on the land, in the water, in the air, within the earth and even within fire. The belief that they are sterilized in fire is not acceptable, because it is clearly stated here that the soul cannot be burned by fire. Therefore, there is no doubt that there are living entities also in the sun planet with suitable bodies to live there. If the sun globe is uninhabited, then the word sarva-gataḥ—living everywhere—becomes meaningless.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the meaning of the word sarva-gataḥ ?

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 2.22'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : What examples have been given from the Vedic literature to describe the Soul and the Supersoul ? How can a jīva get out of all  kinds of anxieties ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "The Vedas, like the Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad, as well as the Śvetāśvatara Upanisad, compare the soul and the Supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. One of the birds (the individual atomic soul) is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other bird (Kṛṣṇa) is simply watching His friend. Of these two birds—although they are the same in quality—one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while the other is simply witnessing the activities of His friend. Kṛṣṇa is the witnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eating bird. Although they are friends, one is still the master and the other is the servant. Forgetfulness of this relationship by the atomic soul is the cause of one\'s changing his position from one tree to another or from one body to another. The jīva soul is struggling very hard on the tree of the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept the other bird as the supreme spiritual master—as Arjuna agreed to do by voluntary surrender unto Kṛṣṇa for instruction—the subordinate bird immediately becomes free from all lamentations. Both the Kaṭha Upaniṣad and Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad confirm this:  \nsamāne vṛkṣe puruṣo nimagno  \n\'nīśayā śocati muhyamānaḥ  \njuṣṭaṁ yadā paśyaty anyam īśam asya  \nmahimānam iti vīta-śokaḥ  \n"Although the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully engrossed with anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree. But if in some way or other he turns his face to his friend who is the Lord and knows His glories—at once the suffering bird becomes free from all anxieties." Arjuna has now turned his face towards his eternal friend, Kṛṣṇa, and is understanding the Bhagavad-gītā from Him. And thus, hearing from Kṛṣṇa, he can understand the supreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation."  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 2.22, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/af1t4nw3b7s41.jpg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b88f2f378d4c53d4d0b0ceaf5fafc10f2476ae6a\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: 'Pazhassi Raja - The Lion of Kerala #2'<br />Body: "**Rebellion against Tipu Sultan**\n\nPreviously we discussed how Pazhassi Raja Ji made Kottayam a free land. In 1784 Hyder Ali’s son Tipu Sultan had taken the reigns of the kingdom, and after the second Anglo-Mysore war between the British and the Mysore Kingdom of Tipu Sultan both the parties made a treaty in which the British recognized Tipu’s authority in Malabar (now Kerala / in Kerala). Now the only ally against Tipu was lost and knowing a sole rebellion against both Tipu and British will lead to bloodshed of Innocents Pazhassi Raja Ji agreed to pay tribute to Tipu and become a vassal of Mysore Kingdom.\n\nBut as once Hyder Ali did, Tipu demanded an exorbitant rate of tribute. Although Ravi Varma, the elder brother of Pazhassi Raja Ji agreed to pay 65,000 rupees per year, **Mysore demanded 81,000 rupees**. The hiked rate of tribute meant more taxes on farmers and greater hardship for the peasantry \\[largely Tiyar/Izhava\\] who had already suffered greatly from years of foreign occupation. Pazhassi Raja Ji knew that such amount will not be possible for Kottayam to pay and So he took up this issue and decided to launch a mass resistance struggle once more.\n\nWhat angered Pazhassi Raja Ji even more, was that his brother Ravi Varma who paid a visit to Tipu Sultan in 1786 for peace talks was forced to sign a treaty which ceded Wayanad to Tipu Sultan against the wishes of the locals. Pazhassi Raja Ji decided not to let Tipu enjoy Wayanad in peace and kept up guerrilla warfare that constantly harassed Mysore troops in Wayanad and neighbourhood. The struggle against Tipu Sultan lasted till 1793, a total of seven-year. **In the end, Pazhassi Raja Ji was able to expel the last of Mysore’s troops from Wayanad.**\n\n**Pazhassi Raja Ji’s hatred of Tipu had grown even more because of the latter’s policy of forcible conversion**. Raja Ji strengthened his ties with British on one hand and with fellow rebel chiefs and princes in Malabar on the other hand. Tipu in hopes of ending the rebellion all across Malabar sent an army under a French general named Lally with **a genocidal mission—the extermination of the Nairs**. Tipu was determined to end the menace of Nair rebels in Malabar who had foiled all attempts of him and his late father Hyder Ali to subjugate and exploit Malabar.\n\nBy the end of in 1790, Tipu abandoned the war in Malabar as his troops were getting a tough fight in Malabar and on the other hand, the war in Deccan became even more important issue for Tipu. He only kept his troop in Wayanad. The rest of Malabar’s forted were again coming back in the hand of its local. Pazhassi Raja joined the British with a force of 1500 Nairs to capture the Mysorean stronghold in Katirur (near Talassery). After Katirur, Pazhassi Raja and his troops moved south-east and captured the Kuttiyadi fort from Tipu’s men. Thus once more the whole of Kottayam was in the control of Pazhassi Raja. In 1790, the British recognised Pazhassi Raja as the head of Kottayam instead of the original Vira Varma (Uncle of Raja Ji) who was in refuge at Travancore. Raja agreed to pay 25,000 rupees as a tribute to the British.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The third Anglo – Mysore War and its effect on the Kottayam**\n\nA third war between Mysore and the British took place in which the British defeated the Tipu convincingly. And a new treaty called the Treaty of Seringapatam (1792) was signed between them in which Malabar was ceded to the British. The British then began to work for establishing their supremacy in Malabar. A war between two invaders had changed the map of Kerala.\n\nThe British and Pazhassi Raja had opposite views. Pazhassi Raja Ji had helped the British not because he was ready to accept British sovereignty but because he wanted his country Kottayam to be a free land from foreign invaders.\n\nPazhassi Raja was disturbed when he heard about the terms that British put forward to Rajas of Malabar in 1792 because British had signed a cowl with him in 1790 which promised to respect the independence of Kottayam and the new terms presented by British laid waste to all what was previously agreed upon. The summary of the British terms in 1792 is:\n\n1. The Raja to be able to rule as before but British to control him “in case of oppressing inhabitants”.\n2. A resident to be appointed to enquire about “complaints of oppression”.\n3. Two persons on the part of the British and two persons on the part of the Raja to make the valuation of land revenue of Kottayam.\n4. The Tax paid by each local is to be ascertained.\n5. The Raja’s tribute being settled in October 1792 according to the appearance of the crop.\n6. The British share of the pepper to be delivered at a price fixed by the British in December 1792.\n7. The remainder of goods mainly the pepper were to be bought only by merchants that were appointed by the British.\n\nThese terms converted monarchs to mere agents of the British. Rajas were now stripped of their right to rule as they willed; they also lost control over their economies.\n\nDuring the talks with the British, the Kottayam was represented by Vira Varma. The same uncle of Pazhassi Raja that had become a refuge in Travancore. He was not considered the King of Kottayam; neither the locals and nor the British had earlier considered him the king of Kottayam. He was used as a pawn by the British for negotiation. And as such Vira Varma concluded a treaty with British by which he accepted all terms and conditions put forward by British.\n\n***Next, we will learn about Raja Ji's rebellion against the British.***\n\n*I have kept this and will keep the next two summaries short. Please feel free to correct if any mistake is found. A request by me is to not glorify the Islamic invaders when you have heroes of your own.*"<br />Author: 'Fluid-Lock'  id: 'fyzr6h'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fyzr6h/pazhassi_raja_the_lion_of_kerala_2/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Tipu and Trump. Mallaya and Malaria. Gin &amp; Tonic and Wuhan. How are they connected.'<br />Body: 'Not OC\n\nSource: https://twitter.com/Drsunandambal/status/1248514970444124160?s=19\n\nIn 1799, when Tipu was defeated by the British, the whole of Mysore Kingdom with Srirangapatnam as Tipu\'s capital, came under British control. For the next few days, the British soldiers had a great time celebrating their victory, but within weeks, many started feeling sick due to Malaria, because Srirangapatnam was a highly marshy area with severe mosquito trouble. \n\nThe local Indian population had over the centuries, developed self immunity, and also all the spicy food habits helped to an extent. Whereas the British soldiers and officers who were suddenly exposed to harsh Indian conditions, started bearing the brunt. \n\nTo quickly overcome the mosquito menace, the British Army immediately shifted their station from Srirangapatnam to Bangalore (by establishing the Bangalore Cantonment region), which was a welcome change, especially due to cool weather, which the Brits were gavely missing ever since they had left their shores. But the malaria problem still persisted because Bangalore was also no exception to mosquitoes. \n\nAround the same time, European scientists had discovered a chemical composition called "Quinine" which could be used to treat malaria, and was slowly gaining prominence, but it was yet to be extensively tested at large scale. This malaria crisis among British Army came at an opportune time, and thus Quinine was imported in bulk by the Army and distributed to all their soldiers, who were instructed to take regular dosages (even to healthy soldiers) so that they could build immunity. This was followed up in all other British stations throughout India, because every region in India had malaria problem to some extent. \n\nBut there was a small problem. Although sick soldiers quickly recovered, many more soldiers who were exposed to harsh conditions of tropical India continued to become sick, because it was later found that they were not taking dosages of Quinine. Why? Because it was very bitter!! So, by avoiding the bitter Quinine, British soldiers stationed in India were lagging behind on their immunity, thereby making themselves vulnerable to Malaria in the tropical regions of India. \n\nThat\'s when all the yop British officers and scientists started experimenting ways to persuade their soldiers to strictly take these dosages, and during their experiments,  they found that the bitter Quinine mixed with Juniper based liquor, actually turned somewhat into a sweet flavor. That\'s because the molecular structure of the final solution was such that it would almost completely curtail the bitterness of Quinine. \n\nThat juniper based liquor was Gin. And the Gin mixed with Quinine was called "Gin &amp; Tonic", which immediately became an instant hit among British soldiers. \n\nThe same British soldiers who were ready to even risk their lives but couldn\'t stand the bitterness of Quinine,  started swearing by it daily when they mixed it with Gin. In fact, the Army even started issuing few bottles of Gin along with "tonic water" (Quinine) as part of their monthly ration, so that soldiers could themselves prepare Gin &amp; Tonic and consume them everyday to build immunity. \n\nTo cater to the growing demand of gin &amp; other forms of liquor among British soldiers, the British East India company built several local breweries in and around Bengaluru, which could then be transported to all other parts of India. And that\'s how, due to innumerable breweries and liquor distillation factories, Bengaluru had already become the pub capital of India way back during British times itself. \n\nEventually, most of these breweries were purchased from British organizations after Indian independence, by none other than Vittal Mallya (Vijay Mallya\'s father), who then led the consortium under the group named United Breweries headquartered in Bengaluru. \n\nComing back to the topic, that\'s how Gin &amp; Tonic became a popular cocktail and is still a popular drink even today. The Quinine, which was called Tonic (without gin), was widely prescribed by Doctors as well, for patients who needed cure for fever or any infection. Whenever someone in a typical Indian village fell sick, the most common advice given by his neighbors was "Visit the doctor and get some tonic". Over time, the tonic word was so overused that  became a reference to any medicine in general. So, that\'s how the word "Tonic", became a colloquial word for "Western medicine" in India. \n\nOver the years, Quinine was developed further into many of its variants and derivatives and widely prescribed by Indian doctors. One such descendent of Quinine, called Hydroxychloroquine, eventually became the standardized cure for malaria because it has relatively lesser side effects compared to its predecessors, and is now suddenly the most sought after drug in the world today. \n\nAnd that\'s how, a simple peek into the history of Hydroxychloroquine takes us all the way back to Tipu\'s defeat, mosquito menace, liquor rationing, colorful cocktails, tonics and medicinal cures.'<br />Author: 'ribiy'  id: 'fyjpqr'<br />Score:44<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fyjpqr/tipu_and_trump_mallaya_and_malaria_gin_tonic_and/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 2.21'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : How a death sentence for a murderer is actually beneficial for him ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "Although the justice of the peace awards capital punishment to a person condemned for murder, the justice of the peace cannot be blamed because he orders violence to another person according to the codes of justice. In Manu-saṁhitā, the lawbook for mankind, it is supported that a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will not have to suffer for the great sin he has committed. Therefore, the king\'s punishment of hanging a murderer is actually beneficial."  \n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  \n**Question 2 : Why Arjuna would not have incurred any sin of killing on the battlefield ?**  \n**Answer 2 :** "In Manu-saṁhitā, the lawbook for mankind, it is supported that a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will not have to suffer for the great sin he has committed. Therefore, the king\'s punishment of hanging a murderer is actually beneficial. Similarly, when Kṛṣṇa orders fighting, it must be concluded that violence is for supreme justice, and, as such, Arjuna should follow the instruction, knowing well that such violence, committed in the act of fighting for Kṛṣṇa, is not violence at all because, at any rate, the man, or rather the soul, cannot be killed; so for the administration of justice, so-called violence is permitted. A surgical operation is not meant to kill the patient, but to cure him. Therefore the fighting to be executed by Arjuna at the instruction of Kṛṣṇa is with full knowledge, so there is no possibility of sinful reaction."  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 2.21, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ky74zl9ho0s41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c6c91fd90838cafd36c3d50613320524380aa6a\n\n  \nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

Finished up the 4 part mini series in one night and then spent a few good hours in watching YouTube documentaries of Ultra-Orthodox Judaism (Haredis)\n\nSome important points,\n\n1. They are concentrated in New York where they settled from Eastern Europe after the WW2. Their average birth rate is 8 children per family. They are educated to make up for the people lost during the Holocaust. \n\n2. They follow the Torah (book of Judaism) to the tee. They till now think that the Torah was written by God. Women were traditionally not allowed to read the Torah. \n\n3. Extreme gender segregation - they go to their own schools, avoid public schools and the children are gender segregated till their marraige which happens when they are 18-21 years old. \n\n4. They avoid usage of internet, smart phones, television and all other aspects of pop-culture despite a major section of their present day population living in New-fricking-York. \n\n5. They are a minority within a minority. There is disdain for anyone who is not an Haredi Jew. Meaning that they actually don't support Israel and they are anti-zionist. Long story short, the Torah says that when the Messiah comes, Israel will be handed to the Jews. The Messiah didn't come so Israel shouldn't exist. \n\n6. And as with any extremist religion, you cannot just leave the community, get educated and have your own life. Your Rabbi (your community's leader) controls every aspect of your family. If you leave or marry outside, you are practically dead. Your family will 'sit Shiva' meaning that they will consider you dead and mourn your death for a week. \n\n7. Rules - there are strict written rules for every single thing - diet, purity, modesty, dressing, hair styles and whatnot. \n\n8. Gender Roles - Women are treated as modern baby machines. Haredi leaders have time and again said that the gender roles that women must follow according to the original texts are 'timeless' and cannot be affected  by contemporary social changes. \n\nWell, yeah, my expertise in this topic is only 12 hours old so I am not expert and there could be many factual mistakes in what I wrote. Please correct me. \n\nBut I thought that in India, we know very little about Judaism let alone Orthodox Judaism so it will be a nice topic to discuss about. \n\nAnd of course watch Orthodox in Netflix, it is eye opening."<br />Author: 'anon_in_india'  id: 'fyeb37'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fyeb37/til_extremist_orthodox_judaism_has_its_own_set_of/</li>

Even some of the modern scientists who do not believe in the existence of the soul, but at the same time cannot explain the source of energy from the heart, have to accept continuous changes of body which appear from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and again from youth to old age. From old age, the change is transferred to another body. This has already been explained in the previous verse.\n\nTransference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible by the grace of the Supersoul. The Supersoul fulfills the desire of the atomic soul as one friend fulfills the desire of another. The Vedas, like the Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad, as well as the Śvetāśvatara Upanisad, compare the soul and the Supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. One of the birds (the individual atomic soul) is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other bird (Kṛṣṇa) is simply watching His friend. Of these two birds—although they are the same in quality—one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while the other is simply witnessing the activities of His friend. Kṛṣṇa is the witnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eating bird. Although they are friends, one is still the master and the other is the servant. Forgetfulness of this relationship by the atomic soul is the cause of one\'s changing his position from one tree to another or from one body to another. The jīva soul is struggling very hard on the tree of the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept the other bird as the supreme spiritual master—as Arjuna agreed to do by voluntary surrender unto Kṛṣṇa for instruction—the subordinate bird immediately becomes free from all lamentations. Both the Kaṭha Upaniṣad and Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad confirm this:\n\nsamāne vṛkṣe puruṣo nimagno\n\n\'nīśayā śocati muhyamānaḥ\n\njuṣṭaṁ yadā paśyaty anyam īśam asya\n\nmahimānam iti vīta-śokaḥ\n\n"Although the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully engrossed with anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree. But if in some way or other he turns his face to his friend who is the Lord and knows His glories—at once the suffering bird becomes free from all anxieties." Arjuna has now turned his face towards his eternal friend, Kṛṣṇa, and is understanding the Bhagavad-gītā from Him. And thus, hearing from Kṛṣṇa, he can understand the supreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation.\n\nArjuna is advised herewith by the Lord not to lament for the bodily change of his old grandfather and his teacher. He should rather be happy to kill their bodies in the righteous fight so that they may be cleansed at once of all reactions from various bodily activities. One who lays down his life on the sacrificial altar, or in the proper battlefield, is at once cleansed of bodily reactions and promoted to a higher status of life. So there was no cause for Arjuna\'s lamentation.\n\n**Question 1 : What examples have been given from the Vedic literature to describe the Soul and the Supersoul ? How can a jīva get out of all  kinds of anxieties ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v8kpbsz4hwr41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11a3c1eb6179f35032acb24d9c27aa40515e0d85\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'fy64w4'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fy64w4/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_222/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Trying to share Dharmic ideas with my American friends, and could use feedback'<br />Body: "I am a practicing Hindu in America and I am trying to find ways of sharing ideas from our dharma with my non-Indian friends. This is one of many more that I hope to write. Could always use feedback from you all (not posting any self-promotional links here).\n\nHere's something I wrote about Shri Ramchandraji's life: \n....\n\nIt was the night before his coronation as the king of the land, a moment of jubilation for everyone.\n\nThe king, the ministers, and even the citizens of the land were impressed with Prince Rāma. He had been the perfect prince.\n\nPatient and noble, generous and kind, fair and just. He traveled far and helped the kingdom prosper. He defended the weak when enemies tried to attack the further borders of the kingdom. He maintained diplomatic ties with neighboring rulers and strengthened peace and prosperity across the land.\n\nHe was also the oldest of the king’s sons. When the king decided to step down from his responsibilities, it came as a surprise to no one that the perfect Prince Rāma to become the heir-apparent.\n\nEveryone except the handmaiden to the Queen.\n\nThe handmaiden to the Queen was a superstitious lady, nosy and bothersome. She had the habit of finding faults in even the best of situations, and in the best of people. Scheming was in her nature, even when it had nothing to do with her.\n\nThe Queen was excited about the coronation of her step-son the following morning. Despite being a step-son, they had bonded like mother and son. She saw him as her own son.\n\n“But what of your son, my lady?” said the handmaiden as she helped the Queen prepare to attend the dinner that evening in the royal court.\n\n“What do you mean?” said the Queen.\n\n“If Prince Rāma becomes the King, your own son will live in his shadow. He will be subservient. And who knows? Perhaps the good prince may cease to be so good with the newfound power,” said the haggard handmaiden.\n\n“Do not be so insolent when you speak of your Prince and your future King,” said the Queen firmly.\n\n“Sorry my lady! I am just an old woman who knows nothing and just rambles. Of course. Don’t mind me,” and with that, she went about her business and left the Queen.\n\nBut the seed of doubt was planted.\n\nBetter men than him have gone mad with power. What if he hurts my own son? What can I do to prevent this?\n\nThe queen could barely eat dinner. After the dinner with the court, she went to the King and started talking.\n\n“Oh King! You are my husband, and today I want to ask you of a favour the night before you step down. Do not deny me this wish.”\n\n“Anything! Ask! I have never denied anything you have asked and today is a happy day for tomorrow my Rāma will take my place!”\n\nThe Queen was silent was a while, and the King looked at her expectantly.\n\n“Say it! I will not deny you. I swear by my honor as a king and your husband.”\n\n“Then hear me oh great King! If your vow to me right now is true, I wish that my own son be crowned the king and that Prince Rāma be exiled into the forest.”\n\nSilence.\n\nIt was an age with the word of the King was bound by honor. If a great man made a vow, upon his life he had to fulfill it no matter what.\n\n“Ask anything else but this! What has come over you? This is the first I have heard talks of such madness!”\n\nBut the Queen was firm. She did not relent no matter how much the King tried to console her. No matter how much the King tried to show her reason.\n\nHe is the right person for this.\n\nHe will treat you well. He sees your son as his very brother.\n\nRāma has never hurt anyone unjustly.\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nThe Queen remained firm and the King was left without words. He fell to the floor and became like a ghost, unable to tell his son what he was honor-bound to fulfill.\n\nMorning came and the kingdom did not know what was to come.\n\nBut the old handmaiden of the Queen had heard everything. And soon, the message went out.\n\nIn corners of the palace, and then the kingdom, the citizens were aghast! They thought it was a rumor.\n\nUntil Prince Rāma woke and received the message.\n\nOn the morning of his coronation, he received a message that changed his destiny. So close to the culmination of his power, he remained stable. Neither upset nor elated, he had taken his impending coronation with the same equanimity with which he took this message of his exile.\n\nHe went to meet his father the King and his step-mother the Queen to confirm the news. His silent father could barely speak, but the news were confirmed.\n\nHe immediately went to his quarters, removed all the finery he wore, and prepared to leave the Kingdom. His very home.\n\nBefore he left, he went to seek the blessings from his father and his step-mother as well. He remained unaffected by the dualities of honor and shame. When the fruit of his life was snatched before his very eyes, he dealt with the tides of fate with calm, with joy and happiness.\n\nThus started the saga of one of the greatest kings of the ancient world, and an ancestor to the peoples of India. ...\n\nI have been thinking a lot about Prince Rāma this past week.\n\nWhen he faced such an extreme event (and many many many others) over his lifespan, he showed that it is possible to live a life of equanimity.\n\nI’d like to make the case that it is this peace of mind that should be the very goal of our lives!\n\nPerhaps your life has been turned around overnight. But like Rāma, we too can learn to have peace of mind.\n\nI’ve been reading this book The Elephant in the Brain that makes a convincing case that close to 90% of the things we do in our life are to signal to others, improve our social status, and receive attention for it.\n\nThe schools we attend: we go for the most prestigious schools so that we can signal to others about our intelligence.\n\nOur professions are often a way to showcase either how smart and capable we are based on the companies we build or the job titles we hold.\n\nEven the charity we work we do is often fused with the thought of the recognition and social status we receive from it.\n\nOur homes, cars, and many other parts of our life are often done to signal to others that we are smart, good-looking, successful, and capable people.\n\nRāma had all these things going for him already. But it was ultimately his ability to have peace of mind that makes hundreds of millions of people remember him, even centuries after he is no more.\n\nIt was his peace of mind, his ability to stay calm under the extreme dualities of life that makes us remember him.\n\nIt was his character that mattered more. It helped him then, and it makes us remember him now.\n\nAnd this is the case with life.\n\nWe chase all external signals of success, status, and affiliation. Countless more people have done that already.\n\nStatus, success, affiliation goes up and down. Sometimes you win, and sometimes you lose. But is only peace of mind that can keep you still. Peace of mind can give you more than any status, success or failure can give you.\n\nUnless you make a deliberate attempt at making peace of mind the ultimate goal of life, it will not happen. Until we make signals of status the main goals of life, we cannot find fulfillment and meaning.\n\nStudying the life of great people like Prince Rāma can be more instructive on how to live life and achieve something meaningful in life.\n\nI hope that you too will make attaining peace of mind your ultimate goal in life."<br />Author: 'dpvtank'  id: 'fy0rl9'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fy0rl9/trying_to_share_dharmic_ideas_with_my_american/</li>

Scary things .....\n\nIt started with an obsession about being accused of something falsely based on my post history and search history . Though I\'m not doing anything suspicious.... But I still had the fear due to me being from a poor family ... \n\nThat escalated to "maybe I am actually a criminal" ... This seemed like an irrational thought but I started believing it out of fear and having additional thoughts like maybe I\'m an insane criminal etc . And that this world is a hallucination and that in reality I\'m a criminal... I\'m still scared that this is a part of my updated fear  escalated to well ... That I\'m going to hell and that my life would become miserable to the point of death ....\n\nNow the fear is because of a dream I had a while ago about how my life would become really scary and that I\'d be drifted apart by everyone and would be hated and that I would hurt them too . Or maybe that I was never loved and that I wouldn\'t be able to return to my loved ones\n\nAnd that I\'d lose everything basically .... Which really scared me a lot . And in those dreams was a mysterious figure who looked like Ryuk from the Anime Death note , mocking me . I was scared for some time but the fear subsided . Now I\'m getting scared even more ... Because some details in that dream became true ... Like me contemplating suicide or drugs.... But I was scared that that wouldn\'t be an end to it . It seems similar to right now...... Which is really scary \n\nEspecially the "not returning to loved ones part" \n\nMost of my friends are online and I\'m in a long distance relationship ..... And because of those anxieties , I haven\'t contacted them ..... And I\'ve been scared shitless ...... \n\nMany of the other things I\'m noticing are "signs" like typos , writings , ads and specefic coincidental wordings and events occuring that I take as "warnings" ......  And some bad things happening with me lately .... Even my mom is acting weird ... This all seems determinential ..... It\'s so scary .... Thinking of an eternal being waiting to torture you for eternity ......\n\nI even saw 2 anime that matched the dream like Babylon and Hell girl ....... \n\nBecause of which I\'m unable to let my guard down ....\n\nAnd it\'s really scaring me ......\n\nEven if most relegions might not have hell ... I\'m scared of there being a different hell .... From relegions ... That is eternal .... It\'s really scary and ruining my health\n\nI\'m scared of this possibility and don\'t know what to do ....'<br />Author: 'literallyIllliterlly'  id: 'fxvqnr'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fxvqnr/scared/</li>

You have the pay attention to the fact that compared to the thousands of books of ideas from the ancient Indian subcontinent, there are just a handful from our western civilizational neighbours and they still are authoritative texts which religions originating from there follow to the word.\n\nSmritis are thought books of rulers which would eventually become law of that time in that particular kingdom. It has nothing to do with religion. It affected and was usually the law in a particular kingdom.\n\nIn Abrahamic religions, problems came in because one of their smritis which was written by the victor was taken to be the word of God. In India, this synthesis did not happen, therefore the widely different views persist. \n\nImagine if manusmriti was a holy book, what you get is something similar to Islam.\n\nI commented this in one of the post.

      <li>Title::: 'Indian Police Reforms - 3rd repost. Nothing has happened in the 4 years since the original was posted'<br />Body: 'There are two aspects to Police reform - one is the modernisation (which this 25k crore will help with to a certain extent) and legislative and legal reforms which is untouched by any govt since 1861.\n\nPolicing comes under the state functions in our constitution and the majority of our state use the archaic British Raj era Police Act of 1861, with a few minor modifications here and there.\n\nThe fuck up is, the British saw the police as a tool to oppress the people, when in any advanced state (except the US), the police are meant to serve the people and this contradiction in thought vs reality is at the root cause of a lot of our problems, from vigilante mobs to riots to political thugs running rampant. The biggest issue in a nutshell is not even the Police act 1861, but the deathsgrip politicians hold over the police and other investigative bodies like the CB CID and CBI. For instance, look at the way Laloo took orders from that thug Shahbudin and then on behalf of Shabhudin, Laloo instructed the Police SP to take action. Simply put, a convicted murderer was ordering the Police SP to take action at his behest.\n\nIt is this criminal - politician - police nexus that needs to be broken.\n\nThe first report on police reforms was the National Police Commission of 1979 instituted by the Janata Govt.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1998, literally nothing happened, when we formed yet another bloody commission. The Ribiero Commission of 1999 - do read the report, very well done, well analysed and the recommendations are pretty much common sense in hindsight, but can radically reform our Police apparatus.\n\nWe then did jackall for one more year when, you guessed it, yet another committee, the Padmanabiah published its reports. This does not deviate either from NPC or Ribeiro committee, but it goes into minutiae, such as age of constables to be recruited, recruitment process for SI\'s (based on an entrance exam) etc etc.\n\nWe then did nothing for 3 years when a massive report on overall criminal reforms (including police reforms) was published, the Malimath report.\n\nThe report sneakily admits to the endless stream of reports by opening with this quote,\n\n“Everything has been said already, but as no one listens, we must always begin again.”\n\nThis was not a report on just police reforms, but overall on how to overhaul our criminal justice reform (even typing this makes me angry, as even if we implement 50% of this report, our criminal justice system would drastically improve).\n\nWe then took the amazing step of publishing...yet another fucking report - well, not a report, but a "model bill", The Police Act Drafting Committee, a laborious work, but again, beautiful piece of legislation that covers everything from recruitment to tenure to welfare for police officers. 110 pages long, if you like legalesse and administrative drudgery (some of us do), read it. Extensive and well thought out bill.\n\nWe then did nothing which irked a senior police (DGP of UP iirc), Prakash Singh who had in 1996 filed a PIL on police reforms.\n\nIn a nice twist of irony, the SC finally passed its verdict in 2006. Read the full case history here,\n\nThe tl;dr of this judgement are the 7 directives which you can read here in a summary manner.\n\nIn 2007 Veerapa Moily published a report on how administrative services could be overhauled, this also touched on reform of the IPS.\n\nAs the Modi govt also needed to put its stamp and publish yet another fucking draft, it also tweaked the 2006 model bill and...published yet another fucking model bill in 2015.pdf)\n\nThis is where we are now.\n\nAll these bills, reports etc broadly say the same thing,\n\n• Fixed tenure for all senior officers from iirc SP upwards - this means the MLA or MLA\'s third cousin\'s brother cannot threaten to transfer an SP for daring to stop him at a check post.\n• A Committee that oversees promotions and transfers, with the state police chief heading it and having both IAS officials and retired judges (for impartiality) - Right now, police posts are up for sale. If you want a lucrative post, you bid for it and buy the fucking post. This is SI upwards, not just senior roles.\n• Improving their pay and living conditions.\n• Separate the enforcement and investigative wings.\n• Competitive selection procedures for all ranks above SI, including an entrance exam\n\nThese reforms all aim at improving the quality of police officers, improving their pay (which will attract a better quality) and most importantly, insulating the police from the politicians AND bringing greater accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Ribiero committee even wants every state to set up a State Security Committee that will oversee all police operations and iirc report into the MHA directly.\n\nAt last 15 states somewhat implemented some random reforms vaguely, only 4 states have in principle agreed to empower a PEB (Police Establishment Board) / SSC as per the Ribeiro Committee to authorise transfers and promotions, but nothing has moved on the ground. IIRC, 4 states have agreed to fix tenures of 1 year (lol) for DGP\'s, and the rest have flat out not even signed onto this. Only Kerala and Karnataka have again, iirc agreed to seperate law and order and investigative functions, I don\'t know if this has actually been implemented.\n\nEven this "compliance" was because they have to tell the SC that they have done something.\n\nTill we fix the police and later the judiciary, we will forever remain a benighted third world country. Problem is, the fucking politicians,be they the Modi or Barmaid or AIADMK or BJD or TMC, are all united only on this one issue. THEY WILL NOT free the police and till they do, the police will remain a useless, ineffective force. This is one of the biggest failures of the BJP. Which is why, though I support them, everytime I hear Modi speak about national security and improving law and order, I can only think of how big of a hypocrite he is. Mind you, these reforms won\'t even cost a naya paisa and there is literally no reason but selfish ones that are preventing them from being passed.'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'fxn5km'<br />Score:37<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fxn5km/indian_police_reforms_3rd_repost_nothing_has/</li>

Similarly, violence also has its utility, and how to apply violence rests with the person in knowledge. Although the justice of the peace awards capital punishment to a person condemned for murder, the justice of the peace cannot be blamed because he orders violence to another person according to the codes of justice. In Manu-saṁhitā, the lawbook for mankind, it is supported that a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will not have to suffer for the great sin he has committed. Therefore, the king's punishment of hanging a murderer is actually beneficial. Similarly, when Kṛṣṇa orders fighting, it must be concluded that violence is for supreme justice, and, as such, Arjuna should follow the instruction, knowing well that such violence, committed in the act of fighting for Kṛṣṇa, is not violence at all because, at any rate, the man, or rather the soul, cannot be killed; so for the administration of justice, so-called violence is permitted. A surgical operation is not meant to kill the patient, but to cure him. Therefore the fighting to be executed by Arjuna at the instruction of Kṛṣṇa is with full knowledge, so there is no possibility of sinful reaction.\n\n**Question 1 : How a death sentence for a murderer is actually beneficial for him ?**\n\n**Question 2 : Why Arjuna willn't incur any sin of killing people on the battlefield ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4lfozhqj6pr41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=115acc6c8e6755991ee0b8e8a8b08d68cf9fcd22\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'fxji7y'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fxji7y/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_221/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Learn Something New - Google Ads Part 4'<br />Body: 'How is everyone doing today? Hope all are indoors and safe. Let us work towards getting through this crisis together by supporting each other in whatever way possible. Here is the next part of the series where you learn the basics of Google Ads. Creating a Search Campaign. Here is the [Medium link](https://medium.com/@sngrmtawade/creating-a-search-campaign-learn-google-ads-basics-411d0b9d9a8c) for those who prefer it\n\nEveryone wants to be at the top of the Google search results page. The quickest way to do this is to create a Google Ads search campaign. We go into great details about how you can create one. We will cover a lot of theory before we get into the practical stuff.\n\n**What is a Search Campaign?**\n\nA search campaign lets you show ads on Google Search Network. The Search Network includes Google search sites and Google search partners.\n\n* Google Search Sites: This includes Google Search and search results on Google Play, Google Shopping, Google Images, Google Maps and Maps App\n\n* Google Search Partners: These are sites that partner with Google to show search ads. YouTube, various directory sites are examples\n\nA search campaign works best when the objective is to generate more leads or sales.\n\n**Why Search Campaigns?**\n\n* Simple answer, be in front of your customers right when they are searching for you\n\n* Even a small business can easily compete with corporate behemoths if you do Google Ads right and have something compelling to sell\n\n* They can be highly targeted, easy to execute and incredibly flexible\n\n* They can be easily measured and can be extremely cost effective\n\n* Works best when you have a limited budget\n\n**Understanding How Search Ads Work**\n\nYou already know that Google displays your ads to searchers looking for the products or services you are selling. So when someone searches for a term, he sees relevant ads on top and at the bottom of the search results page. But how does Google determine which ad should be placed at the top? This is where Google’s auction system comes in.\n\nWhen you think of auction, you would immediately say that the higher you bid on the keywords, the higher your ad shows up. But that would mean that the big companies with huge budgets would easily dominate the top of the page placements. That wouldn’t be fair to smaller businesses, would it? So, Google brings in another variable into the auction known as Quality Score.\n\n**What is a Quality Score?**\n\nQuality score tells Google, how relevant your ads are to the searchers query. This means, the more relevant your ads to the search term, better the chance of showing up higher. Quality score depends on three things that Google calculates at the time of the auction:\n\n* How high is the chance of someone clicking on your ad to reach your website\n\n* How relevant is the ad to the searchers query\n\n* How relevant is the web page that the searcher is taken to the query\n\nFor example, when someone searches for “buy red nike shoes”, an ad which says it sells “red nike shoes” and takes the searcher to a web page with an option to buy red nike shoes would have a higher quality score than an ad that says the website sells “blue nike shoes”.\n\n**How is Ad Rank Calculated?**\n\nThe Ad Rank determines at what position your ad will appear on the Google search page. It is based on two factors, the amount you are bidding (also known as CPC or cost per click) on a keyword along with your quality score.\n\nYou don’t always end up paying the bid amount you set though. Most of the times it is much lower. Here is an [article](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/21/how-much-does-adwords-cost) that dives deeper into Google Ads bidding.\n\nThe simple thing to remember is that you should aim to bid on keywords as relevant as possible for your business and construct ads that will help you at the time of the auction. Constructing a solid account structure, thus becomes important.\n\n**Google Ads Account Structure**\n\nAccount structure relates to the organization of your Google Ads account. Google offers us three layers of organization:\n\n* Account — Which stores all your business, billing and contact related information\n\n* Campaigns — Have a distinct objectives and budgets assigned to them\n\n* Ad Groups — are groups of closely themed keywords and ads\n\nGroups of ads and keywords form an “Ad Groups”, a number of Ad Groups form “Campaigns” and a group of Campaigns forms an “Account”.[Reference](https://imgur.com/64axB8r)\n\n**Accounts**\n\nFocus on just one website at an account level. Now, you can target multiple websites within the same account, but having separate accounts helps organising things a lot. Most of you, I believe will have just the one website, so this will not be much of an issue. But, for the pros out there or people looking to promote multiple websites, consider creating an [My Client Center](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_in/home/tools/manager-accounts/).\n\n**Campaigns**\n\nThe best way to determine how many campaigns you need is to look at the website you are advertising. If your website is selling multiple products or services, have separate campaigns for each. Now this wouldn’t make sense for e-commerce websites with 100s and 1000s of products to sell. When this is the case, always go for a [Google Shopping campaign](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-shopping). Having separate campaigns will help you better allocate your budget better and determine what’s important.\n\n**Ad Groups**\n\nThe most critical step here is creating ad groups. We have already seen that having a good quality score is not only important to achieve a higher rank on Google’s search results page, but it could also help you to spend a little less than your competitors. So how do you determine which keywords belong in the same ad group? Group them up by themes. For example, if you are selling t-shirts, you would group up keywords related to “black t-shirts” in one ad group and all the keywords related to “plain white t-shirts” in another ad group. This will not only help you write relevant ads that send searchers to relevant web pages, but also help you achieve a good quality score at the time of the auction.\n\n**Keyword Match Types**\n\nBefore we head into taking a practical look at creating an account structure, let’s take a quick look at how to tell keyword match types. Match types help Google determine how aggressively to match the search query with a keyword. With some match types, only the exact phrase can be matched, while others might match with synonyms of the words. Here are the various keyword match types you can add to your ad group:\n\n* Broad Match: These include close variants of the words, related terms and other relevant variations. When you set the term *womens hats* as broad, the ads can be triggered for *ladies hats*, *womens clothing*, *womens scarves*\n\n* Broad Match Modified: As the name suggests, it is a modification of the Broad match type. The terms included in the phrase can appear in any order and can be replaced by close variants of the terms. Here, *womens hats* can set off ads for *hats womens*, *womens scarves and hats*, *cheap womens hats*\n\n* Phrase Match: Matches the phrase, but close variants might still replace some terms. Even if the phrase is part of a larger term, the ads might get triggered. Words like “in”, “for” or “the” might be added between the terms in the phrase. Here, *womens hats* will set off ads for terms like *blue womens hats*, *hats for women*, *how to buy a womens hat*\n\n* Exact Match: The ad matches the exact term you bid on or its close variants. Here, *womens hats* will set off ads for terms like *womens hats*, *ladies hats*, *hats for women*\n\nSo, from Broad Match to Exact Match, the targeting gets more and more narrow. Which is the right match type for you? Apart from Broad Match keywords, use them all up in your search campaigns. Broad Match type keywords are just too, well, broad and you want to be as relevant as possible to the searchers intent. Now there are some advanced strategies where you can use broad, but those are only recommended for experts.\n\n**Creating the Search Campaign Structure**\n\nNow that you have a better understanding of what a campaign structure is, let’s take a practical look at creating an account structure. For the purpose of this example, let us assume that we want to generate more leads for a companys’ PPC and SEO services. Here are the keywords that we found to be relevant through the keyword research[Reference](https://imgur.com/5jdIGNt):\n\n* The first thing to do here is to create another table in Excel or Google Sheets with these exact headers. Make sure there are no spelling mistakes. This will help us later, when we launch the campaigns [Reference](https://imgur.com/iHTff2T)\n\n* Paste all the keywords under the “Keyword” column[Reference](https://imgur.com/qCpqAIr)\n\n* Next, group up similarly themed keywords together and assign them an easily identifiable ad group name under the “Ad Group” column. Make sure keywords with similar themes are placed in the same ad group[Reference](https://imgur.com/YgOPPjk)\n\n* Now, since the main objective is to generate more leads for PPC services and SEO services, we want to create separate campaigns for each. To help do that, simply write down the campaign names under the campaign column. Make sure you are adding all the PPC related keywords within the PPC Campaign and SEO related keywords under the SEO campaign. This is what your sheet should look like[Reference](https://imgur.com/QwC0VU2)\n\n* Finally we add the “Criterion Type”. That is nothing but the Match Type of each keyword. Just as we discussed earlier, we will only add Broad Match Modified, Phrase and Exact Match keywords to our campaigns. Simply add “Phrase” under the “Criterion Type” column to tell Google that this keyword should be phrase matched[Reference](https://imgur.com/Z5qRJTZ)\n\n* Copy and paste this table below and just replace “Phrase” with “Exact”[Reference](https://imgur.com/HXWNJdn)\n\n* To make a keyword Broad Match Modified, you have to add a “+” symbol in front of every word in the keyword and assign it the “Broad” criterion type. [Here is what my sheet looks like](https://imgur.com/NvkxIGk)\n\n* Now simply get rid of the blank rows and sort them out. Sorting is not required, it just helps you have a better look at the keywords before you upload them to Google Ads. If you have applied a filter to your table, sorting will be easy. Simply click on the filter icon for the column you want to sort [Reference](https://imgur.com/koqFm8M). Select “A to Z” or “Z to A”, whichever one you prefer[Reference](https://imgur.com/nyZnUZI). Do this for all columns from right to the left. [Here is what your sheet should finally look like](https://imgur.com/b91lXnZ)\n\nAnd that’s it.
