We didn't care when political party goons killed people on Facebook Live cause they were muslims we didn't care when media ignored these issues cause they were not our religion our caste or our state. \n\nBut in doing so we have essentially told the political parties that we won't do sh*t. We gave them the license to do this. BJP, TMC, Shiv Sena.. on the ground level are all the same. their members are literally families with many running from different parties so whichever wins, one member of the family is always in power. They don't care about religion they care about suppression and power. and in giving it to the OTHERS we fed and bread a monster and now that monster is biting us back.\n\nYogi in UP, Mamta in WB, even SS in MAH.. they were always goons it's just we didn't care when they hit the other neighbourhood and now they're hitting ours and the police won't do shit cause we made our political electives god's without questioning and we ordered the police  to comply or face the consequences.\n\nBengal is not on TMC goons or Mamta. It's on us. We told them that you can do it. We showed them that the elected party is the dictator and no-one can question them. \n\nWe did that and now we have to make a change. I don't know how but I guess someone in the comments might.

      <li>Title::: 'We all want to blame political parties'<br />Body: 'I keep getting messages, "Do you still support Modi after your family is dying"? \n\n(Those who know me long enough know I\'ve had only 1 political position, anti-congress. I do not support anyone else. It is a matter of time, each person\'s politics and positions).\n\nFirst of all, before you accrue blame to those whom you despise - look around you. Stop being insensitive with your attitude of "You did not support whom I recommend, so your entire family deserves to die of covid/post-poll violence", "Vote for Mandir-Masjid, and deserve what you get".\n\nSecondly, on topic - It was grand apathy by every single member of the society - the people, the un-elected administration and the parties. \n\n* Central war rooms set up have no idea how to manage these things. If you decide to centralize, it also must be manned by capable individuals - only 2 professions have closest experience work in such a fast pace and act on changing circumstances (1) An instinctive army general who takes immediate decisions (2) Doctors who are see changing conditions of the human body and can decide what might be happening. There would be others, but not close enough.\n* War rooms are manned by call center employees who know how to answer a phone and look at a list. I don\'t care what background they have. \n* Yes, centre gets a large chunk of the blame for not having this foresight. Every successful country have these extraordinary powers to their strategic doctors (Including in Australia, and New Zealand). They faced criticism but preventive short bursts of action was quite effective. You\'d say, they are low density nations - yes, and they also received lower no. of vaccines. They did not need to worry so much, but still they went above and beyond.\n* Yes, state governments are to be blamed - each state has several aspects that they could have controlled. Even if they had to haggle with the center, they still had several things within their power including action and behavior of the un-elected administration. The fact that some states such as (idk?) Kerala? performed better. But this performance is won\'t help as borders are open, and drive to control is not enough.\n* Un-elected administration IMO accrues the 2nd highest blame - They had the powers to do the things on the ground. They had the resources to pre-emptively act. They slacked off because the sycophants in power were quick to celebrate. Did the still not have a job to do? We will have a 3rd wave and we will still be discussing whom to blame, while this administration will easily get off the radar. \n* The general public - We are apathetic and heartless. We want to blame each other\'s political party, "Modi is responsible", "Kejriawal is responsible", "that shive sena guy...", etc. As we would be most affected, while all these people would be secure in their ivory towers (be it state, center, parties, executive administration), why did we not take precautions? Even today, we have the attitude of "Let this disease take away those fucking X, Y, Z groups in large numbers...even if it kills some of us, its ok" - YSK, it does not work that way at all. You, sir, are the greatest disappointment - even if you survive this and all your enemies die - you or your political opinion (Whoever you are), would never make a better society. The foundation in itself that you possess is nefarious. \n* Scammers - unfortunate, but they are bound to exist in any situation and their hate of humanity and greed of making money in any misfortune is always to be expected. \n* The only saving grace was the decentralized nature of our friendships and acquaintances - who were able to be the eyes and ears on the ground directly and indirectly - tell us to the effect "**I can see a bed vacant in this hospital"**. It could be a cleaner, a nurse, a car / delivery driver, volunteer, doctor, etc.  \n\nWhen I see people still posting, PMing me such dastardly opinions - I can only feel sorry for us as a society. \n\nOne civil / health emergency has completely broken open the faultlines - and we are mostly more concerned about demise of our political enemies rather than surviving together. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR - Yes, politics will exist at anytime, if you trouble the common person with your nefarious opinion - you / your opinions are the greatest disappointment.**'<br />Author: 'metaltemujin'  id: 'n82n0b'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n82n0b/we_all_want_to_blame_political_parties/</li>

With the current scenario of COVID-19, it has been incredibly difficult to get Vaccines and it is very hard to keep up with consistently checking on https://cowin.gov.in to check for available vaccines. \n\nTherefore, I and some friends of mine have collaborated over this weekend to build a simple Vaccine tracker which notified you as soon as a vaccine is available for you. We call it Vaccinosaurus (yeah, dumb name - I know 😂)\n\nNow, I’m not saying that there aren’t other Vaccine tracker and notifiers present there but all of them are providing a chunk of code which you can run on your local machine for probably an infinite time duration until you get a notification. The problem with this approach is not everyone is that much tech savvy or has the compute power to run an app for such long durations or worse, not everyone even has a computer in India. And these projects can’t be hosted on free providers like Heroku or Netlify because the COVID-19 vaccine data can only be accessed from India. That’s why we rigged up a powerful server in Mumbai and made it all accessible via a website so that you don’t have to do the heavy work. \n\nJust fill in your PIN code and/or your district name and once a vaccine is available, you get an email. We are working on adding more features and more ways to notify like SMS and Push Notifications but that may take a day or two (and all of this costs us money too, but we just wanna help and do what we can do from our side being a developer 😅)\n\nAlso, if any of you fellow developers would like to contribute (I seriously hope you do \U0001f972), the code is open source and is accessible at https://github.com/luciferreeves/vaccinosaurus. \n\nAnd the tool itself is live at: https://vaccine.cyborn.in AND https://vaccinosaurus.herokuapp.com\n\nPS: Service available only in India\n\nSorry for self promotion (it’s for a good cause) 🥺'<br />Author: 'luciferreeves'  id: 'n7yggt'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n7yggt/covid19_vaccine_tracker_and_notifier/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Did Kejriwal let Delhi down?'<br />Body: "Frankly speaking, Delhi shouldn't be having this oxygen and bed related crisis that it is having right now. As a major metropolitan city and literally the capital of India, it should have been an asset to the whole country as opposed to now when it is seeking resources that are desperately needed  elsewhere in the countryside.\n\nA 200-300 crore worth of investment in healthcare prior to second wave would have proved handy. With a budget of 65000 crore, allocating 200-300 crore shouldn't have been difficult. To see Delhi govt blaming center for a meagre fund is frustrating given its revenue surplus status. Delhi also has some of the best hospitals in this country in both public and private space. Then why is Delhi having this problem. I think Kejriwal, his style of politics and his priorities should be blamed for the present crisis. He not only let Delhiites down but he let India down in front of world community. He made Delhi helpless; like some remote hinterland rather than being a modern capital that it claims to be. In particular:\n\n- He and his team are too restless to expand the party elsewhere in the country rather than focusing on Delhi. Given that their core team is still too small, the burden of expansion in terms of resources and time directly falls on Kejriwal. We see that in the middle of the pandemic Kejriwal was saying how he will help Punjabi voters with oxygen when in fact Delhi's own needs were not assessed and met. \n\n- Kejriwal lacks developmental and infrastructure vision, and he loves 'jugaad' like policies that are meant for remote places. His obsession with Mohalla clinics at the cost of everything else in healthcare industry illustrates this point well. This could have been the moment for Kejriwal to rise and shine and to showcase Delhi's advanced healthcare model to the whole country. Instead we see a helpless Delhi that is haggling for resources like cryogenic tanks that are needed in small tiers cities like Nagpur and Lucknow. At a fundamental level, Kejriwal never made health care investments that could pass a major stress test like a global pandemic - although i should add that epidemics such as Dengue are no stranger to the city and they should have served as an early reminder to an attentive government. \n\n- Kejriwal uses humongous advertisement budget to buy loyalty and silence of media personals. This is in addition to journalists who have been directly working for AAP since its origin. It seems media is also invested in AAP's political growth in other parts of the country. This huge leverage over media is used to continuously defend brand Kejriwal, attack leaders of other states who in return have to marshal their own media resources to defend themselves. Of course all of this is helpful to media that benefits from mutual conflict and investment but the wasteful expense is a disservice to the people as a whole."<br />Author: 'yonhi'  id: 'n7v7a4'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n7v7a4/did_kejriwal_let_delhi_down/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Adar Poonwala had guts when everyone else hid'<br />Body: ' TLDR: Adar Poonawalla and Krishna Ella deserve a Bharat Ratna, not stupid jibes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe comments on Adar is a “chor”, “bhaag gaya” and other similar in galli languages is downright despicable. For one, no one who is doing good for the country deserves that language, and certainly, absolutely not for someone who has done a lot for the country.\n\nWe as a country love to ‘follow’ the leads of the 5-cent trolls and denigrate our own leaders, who would other wise be called idols. If this was US, Adar would be idolized for next generations like Lee Iacocca, Lou Gerstner or Jack Welch. But what do we do? We chase them out, hound them, malign them, talk despicably and give same treatment like the Nirav Modi or Vijay Mallya. And then, you wonder why are youth jobless, why do we not have industries or investments, why are things expensive, why does the life still suck?!\n\nBefore I tell you what Adar did, let me tell you this. Get off your couch and use your thinking muscles. Learn some critical thinking (which I am sure your schools and colleges did not teach you), and learn to slice through multiple layers of disinformation propaganda, and mischief. And, have courage to stand up for your own, people who are doing good for you. Don’t go living your life chasing likes, upvotes and other’s approvals.\n\nNow, let me take you back to April-May-June 2020, the ‘first wave.’ The countries were under siege. Italy and New York were seeing lots of death. (This is not a rudali, so that is all I will say about deaths). No one knew how to tackle these “novel” viruses. There were hypotheses flying about to how it spreads, how long it lives on the surfaces, which drugs can be used to treat patients. Remember, HCQ? Well, nobody had a f\\*\\*\\*ing clue.\n\nThankfully, there was one group of researchers who were much ahead of its time as they were working on developing vaccines for similar viruses. They way of treatment was, what media called, the “Oxford vaccine.” But this was a theory, and idea which worked in lab and on paper. There were few(?) clinical trials. It could the vaccine, or it could be not. Here is a glimpse on what the [failure rates](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/Success-rates.jpeg) can be in drug discovery. And, mind you failure rates in vaccines are higher, as vaccines are meant for general population and hence has a higher bar.\n\nWhen no body knows anything, has no clue what the direction this is going. If the winters are going to increase the severity, from economic discussions to mask chiding … damn it! This Adar has balls to come out and say he will produce 60 million doses of something, that may be a vaccine, and that may be approved, and that may be ordered. Da f\\*\\*k, what does he think this is a Las Vegas roulette?! But the gumption of this man, and wonderful ethos of the entire Parsi community, he promised he would start production as soon the trials yield some safety and efficacy data. \n\nHow will he manufacture this new vaccine, when SII has to produce other vaccines as well? Where is the new facility to manufacture such large doses going to come from?\n\nThis is Adar: "Following that, we have undertaken the decision to initiate manufacturing at our own risk. The decision has been solely taken to have a jump-start on manufacturing, to have enough doses available, if the clinical trials prove successful," [Source](https://www.news18.com/news/business/serum-institute-to-start-making-oxfords-covid-19-vaccine-in-3-weeks-launch-by-oct-if-trials-succeed-2593239.html). This was in April 2020!\n\nNow which business would take risk of own money? To manufacture and launch a product that may never see the light of the day, and completely stressing his existing product line? And (knowing fully well) that these vaccines will be “given free by the government” and hence has no profitability involved!\n\nIs this SII ya koi Dharmashala!!!?\n\nDa F\\*\\*K man! Thank you Adar. No idea how many people Adar and Krishna have saved, but that’s definitely a big number.\n\nThis early manufacture saved quite a lot of people, giving India an head start into vaccination programs especially for healthcare workers, including enabling India to export and grant aid to other countries.\n\nIf you are still around reading this, Adar may have a hand in it (ya, it’s a mild exaggeration). Honor him, Krishna, and health workers with what ever you got, but they don’t deserve your petty jibes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPs: The reason for shortages are manifold. It starts from the campaign of delegitimizing these vaccines, disinformation causing hesitancy, and delayed orders from the government. People also ignore how difficult it is to set up the logistics for supply, distribute, store, and train people to administer new vaccines.'<br />Author: 'nandeeshwara'  id: 'n7tvfh'<br />Score:104<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n7tvfh/adar_poonwala_had_guts_when_everyone_else_hid/</li>

Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) laid the foundation stone on May 2, 2016, is expected to irrigate 70 per cent of the state, covering 80 of the 119 assembly constituencies. \n\n When completed, the KLIS, for which the foundation stone was laid on May  2, 2016, is expected to irrigate 70 per cent of the state, covering 80  of the 119 assembly constituencies. \n\n KLIS is divided into seven links and 28 packages to build 20 reservoirs  in 13 districts which can hold 141 TMC of water. These reservoirs are  inter-connected through tunnels running to about 330 km, including the  longest 21 km tunnel connecting Yellampalli and Medaram reservoirs. The  canals will be 1,832 km-long, taking water as far as 500 km from the  source. And it will be pumped up to 618 metres from mean sea level—the  highest point of KLIS—into the Kondapochamma reservoir in Gajwel. \n\n \n\nAs the monsoon hits Telangana in full  force, water from the Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Scheme (KLIS) is  gushing from Medigadda in Jayashankar-Bhupalpally district to the Mid  Manair Dam in Rajanna-Sircilla district.\n\nThe sight of water flowing through what were earlier parched areas  has brought joy not just to farmers but also engineers working under  KLIS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[KLIS water is flowing from Medigadda in Jayashankar-Bhupalpally district to the Mid Manair Dam in Rajanna-Sircilla district By Express News Service](https://preview.redd.it/yrm3ag7p5xx61.png?width=806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fe4ef31224343b1f589dc28bd11cf5c3b374359)\n\n# Corruption Allegations\n\nAlleging that massive corruption has been taking place under the  guise of the KLIS, former health minister and BJP leader Dr. Nagam  Janardhan Reddy says the Telangana Retired Engineers Association has  been misleading people on the ongoing corruption. The association, on  the other hand, claims that the accusations of misuse of funds worth Rs 1  lakh crore are false when the expenditure on the KLIS so far has only  been Rs 65,000 crore.\n\n&gt;“I have been arguing since the  inception of the project about large-scale corruption,” says Reddy.  According to him, as per the information received through queries under  the Right to Information Act, the difference between the actual price  and the agreement rate in purchase of pumps and motors for four of the  packages alone under the project was Rs 5,662.22 crore. Information  furnished by the Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited showed that the supply  price of equipment for the four packages was Rs 1,686.59 crore. But the  agreement value was Rs 7,348.81 crore. He wondered who pocketed the  huge difference and asked whether the Engineers in Chief (ENCs) were  answerable to the public for it. “While the ENCs say there has been no  corruption in KLIS, Rs 5,662.22 crore did change hands in four  packages,” says Reddy, asking as to “what would be its extent in the 28  packages of the project.”\n\n An aggressive state BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar alleged that not a  single acre has received water under the KLIS in the past two years, but  a mirage has been created and lies are being spread as if the KLIS has  been completed and water is being provided to farmers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Questions\n\nWhat are your thoughts about it ?\n\nHave you heard or read something about the success of the project, is this feasible in the long ?\n\nCan this be implemented if successful in other states too ?\n\nOr harvesting water or any other method is more useful than this ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Source:***\n\n[*https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/will-the-kaleshwaram-irrigation-scheme-be-kcr-s-waterloo-1761496-2021-01-21*](https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/will-the-kaleshwaram-irrigation-scheme-be-kcr-s-waterloo-1761496-2021-01-21)\n\n[*https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/2020/aug/14/as-klis-water-gushes-in-ryots--engineers-rejoice-2183230.html*](https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/2020/aug/14/as-klis-water-gushes-in-ryots--engineers-rejoice-2183230.html)'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'n7s9bd'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n7s9bd/what_are_your_thoughts_on_kaleshwaram_irrigation/</li>

It so happens that people speaking sign languages often form close ties and bonds and over a period of time, given the lack of expressiveness of the language compared with natural language that we speak, the close knit group develop their own dialect of language that isn\'t exactly understandable by the other. \n\nAlso Indian sign language dialect is not mutually understandable with American sign language.

      <li>Title::: 'My opinion on the preparedness of the second wave'<br />Body: 'TLDR; According to me,\n\n1. Nobody predicted this time we required Oxygen cylinders instead of ventilators like last wave, so even if experts suggested PM about second wave, and PM ramped up ventilator production, we would have still been under-prepared. Although ventilators were kept being produced in BEL (My friend was involved in the project)\n2. Many countries supplied Oxygen cylinders **because** of \'Vaccine Maithri\' initiative.\n3. It was each state\'s responsibility to arrange for basic infra. Modi alone cannot keep a count of number of beds in BBMP or BMC.\n4. That said, I do oppose Farmer Protest, Kumbh Mela, Rallies, Idul Fitr at Hyderabad, etc. for being the super spreaders.\n\nYou can call me a bhakth, fanboy, BJP IT Cell or whatever after reading this. But it is my opinion that we should see this from all lenses, instead of just thinking in the same way the mass media makes us think, and then decide who should be held responsible.\n\nDo correct if I\'m wrong, I shall take this down. I\'m no expert in politics, or biology, or journalism.\n\nWe read about many articles about prediction of second wave.\n\nWhile few were not expecting this much rise, like [here](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/covid-19-could-not-predict-exact-nature-of-second-wave-say-scientists-working-on-mathematical-models/story/438085.html) and [here](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/none-of-the-scientists-forecast-second-wave-of-such-vehemence-7293093/). Some did say about experts predicting a huge second wave like [here](https://theprint.in/health/told-modi-govt-in-march-second-covid-wave-afoot-expect-peak-in-mid-may-expert-panel-chief/648935/). But I have not come across any article that said the same experts who predicted second wave, also predicted there would be a huge need of Oxygen cylinders/concentrators this time. (do enlighten me if you find any)\n\n1. During the first wave, no expert was aware of the situation, hence unpreparedness for first wave would be understandable for a nation like India. But yet, we were able to produce PPE, N95 masks,   and Test kits at astonishing rates. Even ventilators.\n2. Manufacturing the ventilators was not stopped after the first peak started flattening, I know this because I have a friend working in BEL who was involved in the ventilator projects funded by PM CARES, (my friend is not into politics, but did mention where funds came from after I asked). So according to me, preparation for second wave was going on. But what was not going on was preparation for Oxygen cylinders. Because who knew about the havoc new variant would create? One of the above links quotes a statement: **"The nature of the virus has been changing very rapidly, and in such a scenario, any prediction must be continually readjusted, sometimes  almost daily,".**\n3. I also feel one of the reasons we got help from so many countries is because of \'Vaccine Maithri\' and because we have been helping many countries with vaccines, capable ones felt the need to help India. Although it is debatable that with those vaccines, our own people could have been vaccinated, which would prevent the need of help from other countries. Which leads to my next point.\n4. Politics around vaccines: Right from \'eminent\' politicians, to the likes of Shashi Tharoors, Adar Poonawalla [himself](https://inshorts.com/en/news/it-hurts-covaxin-maker-bharat-biotech-on-adars-safe-like-water-remark-1609771860062), and the whole left who started bashing Bharat Biotech for covaxin. Thus creating a major setback to the trust people had in vaccines. My father himself was initially reluctant to get vaccinated. Such was the effect it had even after publishing the efficacy of the vaccines.\n5. About Beds and basic Infrastructure: I feel this should be taken care of by individual states, be it Kerala or UP. The centre cannot say allocate these many beds in BMC, or that many in BBMP, etc. It was supposed to be taken care of by CMs, that\'s what they\'re for.  If few consider Kerala as the only state capable of handling the the pandemic, then Kerala could have predicted the need for Oxygen Cylinders and informed the centre.\n6. But I do feel there was no need for Kumbh Mela or Rallies (by any party), and blame the centre for that. While Bengal was not showing a huge surge in cases that time, the effect of the rallies is showing now. \n\nIf you find anything wrong in this post, do help correct me.\n\nAll said and done, I do hope India comes back to normal once again sooner rather than later.\n\n* Please donate plasma if you have recovered from infection.\n* Please spread verified information on oxygen and other medicine availability, you never know who needs it.\n* Try to make use of the time at home to the fullest, spend time with your family, we are privileged to still have food to eat and a house to stay in.\n\nJai Hind'<br />Author: 'ullaspv94'  id: 'n73874'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n73874/my_opinion_on_the_preparedness_of_the_second_wave/</li>

      <li>Title::: "The tragedy of Yugo Sako, the anime Ramayana, and India's failure to capitalise on Indic stories as soft power."<br />Body: '**Examples of national policy to use art and culture as soft power across the world**\n\nSometime in the first decade of the 21st century, South Korea dedicated [1% of its GDP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_wave) to fuel it\'s arts and culture scene across the board - a fund of a staggering ***$1 billion***. This meant it would fund universities, agencies and film studios in cash and low interest loans to further Korean culture. The main objective was to increase Korean influence across the world and hence project it as soft power.\n\n\nThe policy has been giving bumper harvests in form of critical acclaim and money. In the last year itself, South Korea brought in [$85 BILLION](https://financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/how-korea-became-the-worlds-coolest-brand?r)as a result of this policy.\n\n\nThis can be seen everywhere. Parasite won the best picture at the Oscars in 2020. A Korean actor was nominated for best actor this year. Kpop is growing as a craze. Kdrama is catching up.\n\n\nThey even have a [quota system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_quotas) in Korean Cinema, where theaters are required to show a fixed number of Korean films and only after that imported movies. \n\n\nThis policy was thought to duplicate American and Japanese policies.\n\n\nJapanese anime  is all pervading today, and if you see any movie by a famous director, for example Hayao Miyazaki, Japanese culture is highlighted in every movie. Ditto with American soft power. Comics of Captain America, the novel the hunt for red October, movie Argo are all examples of how USA pushes its cultural narrative.\n\n\n**Erosion of Indic culture from popular sphere**\n\n\nBack at home, there has been little effort to further Indic art and culture, and whatever little effort had been made was thwarted by malicious agencies or fizzed out due to inaction by the Indic wing of the political spectrum.\n\n\n\nThe best example of this is the anime Ramayana, The Legend Of Prince Rama. The film\'s creator, Yugo Sako was a self professed Hindu, being an avid follower of Indic stories. The anime itself is beautiful, replete with melodious and [memorable songs ](https://youtu.be/w0arEtmlphQ)and dazzling fight sequences showcasing Sri Rama\'s and Ravana\'s military prowess. Additional points can be given for the film\'s dialogue that has been crafted in pure Hindi, with no adulteration with Urdu. The anime had few flaws, the immediate being the color of Sri Rama himself. He was protrayed as fair skinned, when he was quite dark in color. But that can be easily overlooked since it captures Sri Rama\'s essence accurately.\n\n\n\nThe movie was doomed since it\'s conception. It was supposed to be co-produced by Japanese studio and Indian government. But the then Congress government did not want any part in it, because of the Rama Janmabhoomi movement led by LK Advani. The troubles didn\'t end there.\n\n\n\nAfter making the anime, the release was halted by Vishwa Hindu Parishad, who thought that a cartoon depiction was an insult to Sri Rama. This doomed the film to never release in India.\n\n\n\nAdd to this, the Hollywood release also fell through. The film cost 131 crores to make, the highest budget cinema by Indian film industry ever. It had a stellar cast consisting of Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad fame, and James Earl Jones of Star Wars repute.\n\n\n\n[Yugo Sako](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugo_Sako), who was as good as a Hindu, wanted to make many more movies on Indic history. He died in 2012, writing a movie about Sri Krishna. There has been no awards by Indian government towards Sako nor any appreciation by the film fraternity here.\n\n\n\nAnother good example would be the Chanakya TV series on doordarshan. Given a run of just 47 episodes by Doordarshan, it still made a huge impact with its historical accuracy, chaste Hindi and cerebral monologues by the creator, director and actor Chandra Prakash Dwivedi. \n\n\n\nDwivedi spent 9 years researching the history only for Doordarshan to axe the show because they termed it as propaganda. TV shows like Tipu Sultan were however permitted to continue.\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that it is alleged that the series was [rejected](https://m.timesofindia.com/tv/news/hindi/what-chanakya-was-rejected-by-doordarshan/articleshow/74933853.cms) by Bhaskar Ghose, the father of Sagarika Ghose.\n\n\n\nChandra Prakash Dwivedi himself has [highlighted this problem ](https://youtu.be/pLNFeTFf_5g) in a lecture during a RSS conclave where he highlighted that the Indic literature was enjoyed and consumed by more foreigners than Indians, Shakuntala being a prime example. He insisted that Hindus have to stem this cultural rot, even as they fight with external threats.\n\n\n**A policy was needed yesterday.**\n\nDwivedi is right. The youth of this generation have all heard the hackneyed expression -" influenced by Western culture".\nBut what real option do the youth have when there is no Indic literature to consume across ages. Kids outgrow Panchatantra tales as soon as they go beyond 10 years of age. Ramayana and Mahabharata are viewed as spiritual texts. The awe-inducing feats of Sri Rama are overlooked for his spiritual qualities. The youth get bored with it and soon fall prey to Western culture.\n\n\n\nAnd so begins the phase where wearing dhotis is uncool, touching feet of elders is "cringe", lying prostrate in front of a deity is impossible. Visiting a temple is out of question. \n\n\n\nThis erosion has to be stemmed by the government. Modi has identified this problem and has spoken about producing [video games with Indic stories](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-08-26-indias-prime-minister-appeals-for-games-based-on-indian-culture-and-folk-tales), but no more intent is shown in terms of policy.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile Bollywood continues its unabashed attempts to malign Hinduism, demonize it\'s rituals, and hence brainwash a whole generation.\n\n\n\nA national policy is needed to transform Indic texts into a popular form and then project it as soft power. Yoga itself is not enough. Especially how it has been desercrated as a gymnastic exercise by the west instead of being a spiritual exercise to find "God".\n\n\n\nYugo Sako\'s second movie was supposed to be called Lord Krishna - The Celestial Cowherd. It\'s depressing to know that it never saw the light of the day. We do not even have an HD version of Ramayana anime, forget a remastered version. \n\n\n\nLet\'s hope that the government wakes up before Indic history actually becomes a myth and we are consumed by an identity crisis caused by cultural bankruptcy.\n\nThat\'s it. \n\nNamaste.'<br />Author: 'AsliIndianErotica'  id: 'n6vwqw'<br />Score:218<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n6vwqw/the_tragedy_of_yugo_sako_the_anime_ramayana_and/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Bangalore is in a terrible state - we have greatly failed as a society'<br />Body: 'Some of you may know, my father succumbed to Covid on the 30th May, my mother was covid positive and my sister is awaiting test results. (That\'s all my family).\n\nMy sister was doing her best to help both parents and now she is starting to peak in her symptoms, there is only 1 other person who could help with all the paperwork etc. \n\nOxygen cylinders weren\'t given home and got controlled only to hospitals. \n\nWe needed to address my mom\'s falling Oxygen levels and took my mom to the nearest hospital with 3 basic things:\n\n1. O2\n2. steroids\n3. Any other urgent care. \n\nHer o2 flow requirement changed from 3 lts to 6-8 ltrs. The hospital spared a remdesvir that they had to her. Addionally, we were strongly recommended to move to a hospital with ICU if the flow rate requirement went above 6 lts.\n\nBefore you tell me the science behind all of this, yes I understand - steroids are key and it is available, anti-viral is not very important, O2 only is help support until steroids are able to do their job, etc. Do understand - this post highlights how things are scattered beaurocratically. \n\nThis drug got govt controlled overnight, so if you\'re not in the right hospital, no access. I know it is not essential, but it helps patients recover faster when the lung CT shows fluids and spots, as compared to other cases. My mother is one such case.\n\nThe hospitals which have remdesvir, do not have beds, and cannot sell it outside.\n\nIf we want to move to a hospital with ICU + Drug, we needed to be allocated through BBMP. The hospitals don\'t have the power.\n\nNow, none of the BBMP/govt portals work. people don\'t pick up phones. Even with 10 people calling, they send us in circles. "You have called war room, we cant allocate beds and cant give drug to the hospital you are at, call 14410. No one picks up at this number. Call 104, they give general information - call war room, 14410 or 108. No response in 108" and so on. Ever since the scam, the beds website is down. \n\nEven if you ask Volunteers and other people - they say the plain truth - only 10,000 beds, we are not sure who or how they are filled. requirement is 30,000-50,000. We will search, but be prepared we won\'t get anything for 2 days atleast. \n\nSome of the other volunteer groups say, "Don\'t call here"\n\n19 of the 20 directly involved numbers don\'t work. \n\nIf we ask for Remdesvir to the Hospital where she was, they say, **"That hospital is not in our list, we cant send to them"**. We risked and got the drug from elsewhere and it is not reaching soon enough.  \n\nBeds are controlled, drugs are controlled and those in control don\'t respond and have exclusion criteria that highlights great inefficacy. \n\nMind you we have all the necessary information - the BU, SRF, symptoms, etc. We have money if required.\n\nWe had to move my mother at mid-night to the general section of another hospital that has ICU as back up (No ICU bed as such) as the best possible trade off possible and hope she survives this on her own. I really don\'t know if she\'ll survive the next day.\n\nThat one other person who was helping is starting to have symptoms.\n\n**Just disappointment because the society has failed.** \n\n\\---------------------\n\nAsk anyone, they blame political parties, corrupt officials, Modi. Absolutely anyone who is not directly involved does not understand and the extreme lack of empathy is appalling. "Modi has derelicted his duty", "how can modi be responsible for what or how things are regulated in cities", "this is a sazish by x, y, z"\n\nCurrently, I don\'t know who is ruling bangalore - but it is definitely not any party, not doctors, not center.

The fact that we all thought we had a chance is enough proof that we're getting there. Those 77 seats we won is proof enough! And although I hate it, but I'll take it! \n\nBut don't let this anger and frustration cloud your better judgement. Don't let it hinder your support for our great party and our leaders. It is the only party and the only leader who cares about OUR cause. \n\nI understand our COVID-19 handling left a lot to be desired, and I totally get the anger you all feel for his silence on the Bengal violence. But seriously, what would you have him do? Send his own goons from UP into Bengal and create a civil war? Send the army in and wipe out their party workers? \n\nYou do realise that any rash decision of this sort will possibly lead to either H-M riots, a direct civil war, or at minimum widespread global condemnation from all across calling Modi an autocratic dictator - and I know (surprise, surprise) they already do. But this will give them proof, won't it? Not to mention the media backlash that'll cause. No, we must not let them provoke us.  \n\nAnd let me ask you this. If you and I can feel our blood boil at this, do you think the BJP cabinet doesn't feel the same way? Do you really believe they don't care about their own people when they're the only ones who took a stand for our brothers and sisters in Pakistan and Bangladesh?\n\nYou lot really disappoint me with this. You people who doubt BJP/Modi's sincerity about our cause. You mock liberals for not remembering history, did you forget yours? Our lack of unity is what has always cost us, let us not be doomed to repeat that. \n\nAnd when you ask 'What has Mudi done?', you show that you've already forgotten Kashmir, CAA, and NRC. Tell me, even in your weirdest pipe dreams from 2013, did you think that the Kashmir's legal status would ever change? Did you think there'll be a leader ballsy enough to try to implement aggressive reforms such as CAA and NRC? \n\nThis is a huge blow, make no mistake. But this isn't the time to jump ship. This is the time to mourn and celebrate the bravery of all those grassroot workers who tried to win in the enemy's den. And this is the time to back all those who will continue to do so in the future. There will be justice, there will be retribution, and we have to stand our ground. \n\nJai Hind."<br />Author: 'St_ElmosFire'  id: 'n5iraw'<br />Score:38<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n5iraw/my_humble_request_to_fellow_bjp_supporters/</li>

Having said that, I also believe that this govt isn't doing all that great and here are some suggestions from my end 1/n\nA) This Govt's communication sucks. I mean really. They all chimpus jumping around from studio to studio delivering homilies. Stop all that. Take a leaf out of the US' way of doing things. Have a press officer and hold daily press briefings. Even more important in a pandemic. 2/n\nB) Do a mea culpa about the COVID handling. Accept that the govt bungled. There is enough blame to go around to state govts and the citizens, but as a mature govt., accept that you dropped the ball. That will actually make people trust you more. 3/n\nSack a minister or two to show your seriousness. Get a task force together that can act as a nodal point. Right now everything seems very disorganized (note.. not unorganized).\n\nAlso, Modiji, you are not a Sadguru. Please don't come on TV and give homilies. 4/n\nPeople want to know what steps are being taken to ensure a) Vaccinations for all b) Adequate supply of Beds and O2 cylinders c) Adequate supply of medicines. Please talk about this, rather than in generalities. 5/n\nC) Ensure the writ of the state - Ever since Shaheen Bagh, Delhi Riots, Farmers Protests, and now the #Bengal #BengalViolence , people have seen a weak central government. Violence must ONLY be the prerogative of the state for a peaceful society to exist. 6/n\nYou are not going to earn any brownie points from liberals and their stooges in India and the Western media for your restraint. So don't try.\n\nToo many of your Ministerial colleagues seem to have this inferiority complex of gaining the Liberal pat on the back. 7/n\nPlease ask them to desist from doing that. There is no percentage in that.\n\nThe common man trusts you. So far. He might still vote for you since the alternatives are not even worth thinking about. 8/n\nD) Drop all your non performing ministers. There are many. There are some great ones like Gadkariji or Piyush Goyalji. The others are dragging your govt. down.\n\nE) Kindly de-centralize things. Give your good ministers more agency. You can't do everything. 9/n\nA great leader delegates well. Centralizing everything won't work.\n\nF) Above all, The Buck Stops With You. So people WILL ask questions of you as the leader, as they should.\n\n10/n\nI am just an ordinary Indian who believes you are the best hope to keep this country secure.

The people who are using these libels,  apparently to "purify the social evils", are actually the one who are  supposed to know these basic historical truths.\n\nBasic history -\n\n"In any case, by the time written history began, distinct economic and [social classes](https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-class)   were in existence, with members of each class occupying a certain  place  in the organization of work. At the apex of the social pyramid  stood  the ruler (often worshiped as a divinity in Mesopotamia and  Egypt) and  the nobles (probably grown out of a warrior group that had  subjugated  its neighbors). Closely aligned with them were the [priests](https://www.britannica.com/topic/priesthood);   possessing knowledge of writing and mathematics, the priests served as   government officials, organizing and directing the economy and   overseeing clerks and scribes. The traders and merchants, who   distributed and exchanged goods produced by others, were below the   noble-priest class in the social pyramid. A sizable group of artisans   and craftsmen, producing specialized goods, belonged to the lower   economic classes. Even lower in the social [hierarchy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hierarchy) were the peasants, and at the bottom of the social scale were the [slaves](https://www.britannica.com/topic/slavery-sociology), most likely originating as war captives or ruined debtors. The social structure in Classical [Greece](https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Greece) and [Rome](https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Rome) followed these lines."\n\n[https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-work-organization-648000/Social-classes](https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-work-organization-648000/Social-classes)\n\nUp  til Marx himself. The same order of four classes existed in all  civilizations. The Clergy, the Nobility / Warriors / Aristocracy, the  Merchant / Guild master, the Artisan / Workers / Peasants.\n\n[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm)\n\nNow,  imagine, knowing the truth, but distorting it, by perfidiously changing  the term to "Hindu Caste System", so it appears that "Hindus devised  it", it is "Hinduism specific". Propagating the vile fifth columnist  propaganda and mechanism that British created.\n\n" The British Raj furthered this development, making rigid caste organisation a central mechanism of administration. "\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste\\_system\\_in\\_India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system_in_India)\n\nWR   Cornish, who supervised census operations in the Madras Presidency in   1871, wrote that "… regarding the origin of caste we can place no   reliance upon the statements made in the Hindu sacred writings. Whether   there was ever a period in which the Hindus were composed of four   classes is exceedingly doubtful".\n\nSimilarly,   CF Magrath, leader and author of a monograph on the 1871 Bihar census,   wrote, "that the now meaningless division into the four castes alleged   to have been made by Manu should be put aside".\n\nAnthropologist   Susan Bayly writes that "until well into the colonial period, much of   the subcontinent was still populated by people for whom the formal   distinctions of caste were of only limited importance, even in parts of   the so-called Hindu heartland… The institutions and beliefs which are   now often described as the elements of traditional caste were only just   taking shape as recently as the early 18th Century".\n\n[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48619734](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48619734)\n\nThis  also aligns with the general pattern observed by imperialism all across  the world. And only imperialists are not to be blamed. Lot of  treacherous and traitorous Indian / Hindus are to be blamed as well for  this to have happened.\n\nComing to  "Caste System", that is what is enforced by Law, and Hinduism, Hindu  scriptures do not have a caste system. The Varna is used as a synonymous  of "Caste". But the common word for "Caste" is Varga, not Varna.\n\nIn Hinduism -\n\nThe Epic offers two models on Varna. The first model describes Varna as colour-coded system, through a sage named [Bhrigu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhrigu), "Brahmins Varna was white, Kshtriyas was red, Vaishyas was yellow, and the Shudras\' black".[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_(Hinduism)#cite_note-Hiltebeitel_2011_529%E2%80%93531-20) This description is questioned by another prominent sage [Bharadwaja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharadwaja)   who says that colours are seen among all the Varnas, that desire,   anger, fear, greed, grief, anxiety, hunger and toil prevails over all   human beings, that bile and blood flow from all human bodies, so what   distinguishes the Varnas, he asks? The *Mahabharata* then declares, according to [Alf Hiltebeitel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alf_Hiltebeitel),   a professor of religion, "There is no distinction of Varnas. This  whole  universe is Brahman. It was created formerly by Brahma, came to  be  classified by acts."[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_(Hinduism)#cite_note-Hiltebeitel_2011_529%E2%80%93531-20)\n\nThe *Mahabharata*  thereafter recites a behavioural model for  Varna, that those who were  inclined to anger, pleasures and boldness  attained the Kshatriya Varna;  those who were inclined to cattle rearing  and living off the plough  attained the Vaishyas; those who were fond of  violence, covetousness  and impurity attained the Shudras.\n\nIn Buddhism -\n\nPeter Masefield,[\\[36\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_(Hinduism)#cite_note-masefield-36) a Buddhism scholar and ancient Pali texts translator, states that during the [Nikāya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nik%C4%81ya) texts period of Buddhism (3rd century BC to 5th century AD), *Varna* as a class system is attested, but the described *Varna* was not a caste system. The Pali texts enumerate the four Varnas  *Brahmin*, "Kshatriya",*Vessa* (Vaishya) and *Sudda* (Shudra).[\\[36\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_(Hinduism)#cite_note-masefield-36) Masefield notes that people in any *Varna*   could in principle perform any profession. The early Buddhist texts,   for instance, identify some Brahmins to be farmers and in other   professions. The text state that anyone, of any birth, could perform the   priestly function.\n\nIn Jainism -\n\nJinasena  does not trace the origin of Varna system to Rigveda or to  Purusha  Sukta, instead traces varna to the Bharata legend. According to  this  legend, Bharata performed an "[ahimsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa)\\-test"   (test of non-violence), and those members of his community who refused   to harm or hurt any living being were called as the priestly varna in   ancient India, and Bharata called them *dvija*, twice born.[\\[41\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_(Hinduism)#cite_note-41) Jinasena states that those who are committed to ahimsa are *deva-Brāhmaṇas*, divine Brahmins\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna\\_(Hinduism)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_(Hinduism))\n\nIn  Geeta, Varna is described as composite of Gunas (Satva - Purity,  Intellect, Rajasya - Passion, Desire, Tamas - Greed). Varna is a Guna  (quality, attributes, characteristics) based topological / categorical  model.\n\nGeeta says that one should  chose work according to Varna, and prescribes different works for  different Varnas. If Varnas means Varga / Caste, the entire sentence  would make no sense, as it would mean "Chose work according to work" or  "Chose your caste according to your caste" or "Chose your hereditary  occupation according to your hereditary occupation". The only way the  verse makes sense if if Varna means Guna (character, quality,  temperament).\n\nSources from Greek  Antiquity, Megasthenes Indica, notes existence of seven "Castes" in  India. With Brahmins not being "Clergy", but forest dwelling ascetic  intellectuals. "Castes" is recognized not as "Social order" or  "Hierarchy", but groups based on "Life styles".\n\n[https://archive.org/details/AncientIndiaAsDescribedByMegasthenesAndArrianByMccrindleJ.W/page/n3/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/AncientIndiaAsDescribedByMegasthenesAndArrianByMccrindleJ.W/page/n3/mode/2up)\n\nAnd then, Marx himself taking respectful notes, on "Jats" and "Brahmins" -\n\nwhose  submission even is counterbalanced by a certain calm nobility,  who,  notwithstanding their natural languor, have astonished the British   officers by their bravery, whose country has been the source of our   languages, our religions, and who represent the type of the ancient  German in the *Jat* and the type of the ancient Greek in the Brahmin.\n\n[https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/ni/vol08/no06/marx.htm](https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/ni/vol08/no06/marx.htm)\n\n\\- - -\n\nOn the question of "Categorization" of people.\n\n\\- - -\n\nThis is similar to four temperaments in Antiquity Greece.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four\\_temperaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_temperaments)\n\nModern  corporations use their own topological models, called the Big 5. It is  based on statistical study of population. Another one used is Myers  Briggs.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socionics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socionics)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs\\_Type\\_Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator)\n\nI  personally think categorization, if evidence based, is neutral.  Judgemental attitudes, defending hierarchical and exploitative  structures, using categorization, is immoral.\n\nThis categorization (or Typology), again, is a "standard practice" (Done by NASA, US Army, and many Corporate). Concealing this standard practice in antiquity, middle ages, and modern age and then attacking Indian society and Hinduism for it is the perfidy. One can criticize  the "standardization model", absolutely. But calling it "Hindu division of Humans" is wickedness.\n\n\\- - -\n\nThe political reasons for it -\n\n\\- - -  \nNow, regardless of it\'s "morality", when feudalism which was "standard of  the time" is re-marketed as "Hindu Caste System", and Hinduism is  smeared for it and fifth column groups like Islamist and Christian  missionaries proliferate these lies, it can only be described as a  nefarious and malevolent onslaught. It is similar to omitting all  mentions of slavery in ancient Egypt, and entire history itself, and  calling it "Christian slavery system", while invading a Christian  dominant country who is recovering from 200 years of colonialism.  \nThis  is also specially malevolent because this has palpable political  ramifications. Islamist are naturally Anti India. They align with  imperialist powers to fracture societies. They also invade imperialist  societies to fracture them. Christians on the other hand use these lies  to gain converts. There is nothing wrong with conversions, but lying to  gain converts is immoral.\n\nTo  Hindus, this entire post should not be read as a defense of caste  prejudices. Lots of Hindus are caste minded, look down upon their fellow  humans to feel superior, and this is absolute bigotry. If you are one  of them, you are an irrational bigot who have not read or studied his /  her own scriptures, and are actually responsible for advancement of such  nefarious fifth column activities in India.\n\n"Politics is war without weapons" - Mao.\n\n"War is deceit" - Muhammad.\n\n\\- - -\n\nTo summarize it -\n\nCalling  feudalism "Hindu caste system" is a malevolent smear campaign against  Hindus and Hinduism. You replace it with it\'s actual term, "feudalism",  the entire propaganda simply collapses. Calling this perfidy out using  basic history dismantles and humiliates these propagandists. Do not let  the opposition deflect the issue to "Well, only among Hindus such  prejudices exist", so it is fine if we are lying and changing historical  truth of entire human history and attributing it to Hindus. You can  call out caste minded Hindus, name and shame them, while also exposing  the Imperialists and Islamist for distorting human history to create  fractures in India and attack Hinduism.\n\nIn  addition to that, besides the "Feudal" history of all humanity, if you  trace the historical exegesis (from all Hindu, Buddhist and Jain  sources) and development of the term "Varna", it does not even fit  feudal structure strictly.\n\nStart exposing these perfidious "Leftists". Using Marx works wonders.'<br />Author: 'Jobhi'  id: 'n5ezzx'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n5ezzx/marketing_feudalism_as_hindu_caste_system_by_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Succinct definition of communism and the 3 ways in which soviets infiltrated India'<br />Body: '"Thus communism, in the final analysis, is Soviet patriotism and can attract only those who believe in the Soviet Union as a radically superior country. Communist ideology has no use for Marxism-Leninism or Dialectical and Historical Materialism or Scientific Socialism except in so far as these dogmas provide them a technical jargon and a philosophical scaffolding of the Soviet case. Those portions of the dogmas which go against the Soviet Union in their logical sweep are brushed aside as unessential and the Masters are constantly edited and re-edited to make them up-to-date from the point of view of the Soviet Union. This is the most important criterion in locating the sources of communist power in India or, for that matter, in any non- communist country."\n\n# INFILTRATION\n\nFirst of all, our universities are deeply infiltrated by communist professors and student whole-timers. I know many university teachers who openly teach communism in their classes. Anyone who tries to oppose them or to carry on some amount of anti-communist work is hounded out and blackened in no time. Thus the nation gets a large number of communised young men and women to run her administration, economy and education, in times to come. \n\nSecondly, the press has, to a very large extent, passed into the hands of the Communist Party. One has only to look a little more closely into the headlines, news items, feature articles and editorials of leading dailies and weeklies in the country to see the obvious communist slant. In the course of my research I have come across numerous instances of reports and news-items in which everything said against the Soviet Union, world- communism or the communist organisation in this country is deliberately left out and everything favourable to the communist cause flaunted very prominently. Thus an iron-curtain is being sprung up round this country, all unknown to people who run the government or the political parties.\n\nThirdly, the ruling Congress Party has been considerably penetrated. Though the Congress Party still swears by Gandhism, its slogans have already become communist slogans for all practical purposes. Many communists and fellow-travellers, such as the Marxist Forward Bloc, are entering the Congress under the pretext of supporting Nehrus foreign policy and Avadi resolution on socialistic pattern. The anti-communists inside the Congress are being increasingly silenced by the spectre of American imperialism. The communist task has been further facilitated by the destruction of inner-party democracy inside the Congress, mainly by Nehru. If the present trend continues, it is absolutely sure that the communists will, in near future, make a bid to capture the Congress organisation and, through it, the country.\n\n\\-Sita Ram Goel in **Nehru\'s fatal friendship**'<br />Author: 'hFABGjEQJNz1eVS'  id: 'n597t2'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n597t2/succinct_definition_of_communism_and_the_3_ways/</li>

Social Media has helped them see the NSFL reality of states with too many \'peacefuls\'.\n\nI hope Bengal burns down. The massacre of Hindus there might give a lesson to other states -"This is what happens when your peaceful population gets over 30".\n\nPeacefuls are just 6.6 percent of my state, and it should remain that way. Let them get over 8-9 % and they\'ll start crying oppression.

      <li>Title::: 'Spirituality in the Afghan mountains as I have understood it'<br />Body: 'I made this post for r/Afghan, but I think the users here would enjoy reading it as well. \n\nI will try to collect a short history and exposition of religion as it has been understood by Afghans for many millennia. The opinions expressed here are what I have collected through my journey and are not infallible in their accuracy. They have served me and I offer them to you. I hope that each of you is aware that you are on an individual journey on which others can only offer you maps. You must traverse the journey yourself. Each of these paragraphs can be expanded into a book, I have tried to condense each part such that it becomes an introduction to the entire thread which binds the spirituality of our people. If you want me to expand on a specific part, I will be happy to do it. If you have anecdotes or examples that you want to add, please feel free. I will at some point publish a variation of this essay as part of another series of essays which aims to bind more general concepts together. I welcome commentary, questions and corrections that will help me to improve it.\n\n**The Puzzle**\n\n[This is a poem of Rumi](https://ganjoor.net/moulavi/masnavi/daftar4/sh79/). The poem is about the [sufi mystic Bayazid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayazid_Bastami). Bayazid came from a Zoroastrian family. The jest of the poem is that Bayazid declares in a state of ecstasy that "I am God". After he sobers up, his followers tell him that what he said was not correct (Islamically). He tells them to prepare knives and to stab him, if *he* ever says such a thing. In another session he goes into ecstasy once more and this time he says the same and more. His followers stab him, except that he is not harmed. Every blow given to him is received by the follower who hit him. Rumi then explains that it was not Bayazid who spoke the line, rather that when the line was spoken it was the divinity itself which spoke. A translation can be found in Volume 4, page 132 on [this page](https://faakhirislamic.wordpress.com/2016/05/23/masnavi-rumi-persian-with-english-translation/).\n\n[This is a poem of Ghani Khan, turned into song by one of my favourite bands.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m3Qo_NWZeo). The theme of "fana" (vanishing of the ego) is apparent here also. The other theme that is apparent is the concept of Heaven and Hell which Ghani Khan ascribes to the clergy. \n\n[This is a poem of Bedil](http://www.nosokhan.com/library/Topic/05GQ). In it he speaks about a type of awakening. He claims that the path goes through "non-being".\n\n[This is a poem of Ansari](https://ganjoor.net/abdullah/monajat/sh1/). In this poem Khwaja Abdullah Ansari asks the Lord to give him a clean heart and an aware body. He asks to be rid of himself, and having vanished to be allowed a path to *His* (the Lord’s) self.\n\nThis type of poetry is extremely common in our lands. It is the poetry by which religious scholars were identified. Being a mullah was a common profession, like a policeman. Being a jurist or a scholar was a prestigious position. A mullah would know the Quran. A scholar would know this poetry as well.  \n\nHow can these poems possibly fit within the framework of Islamic theology? Many Muslim readers often rack their brains trying to understand these poets. We have fields liked "Bedil-Shenasi" (Knowing Bedil) or "Rumi-Shenasi\'\' that aim to understand Bedil and Rumi. These are often circles of Sufi who have been initiated into the art of love (of the divine). These poets have inspired and captivated our people\'s imagination. Therefore religious conservatives also venture into reading these texts. They create elaborate explanations to fit poems like the above into Islamic theology. These efforts are always in vain and anyone with a basic understanding of logical fallacies will find that the explanations are lacking. What then is the theology (if any) of these poets? It is the theology that has existed in our mountains for many millenia before Islam and one that will exist for many millenia more. I will try to expound on the consistent and continuous theme which has existed throughout our history. \n\n**Our Mountains**\n\nLet me begin by describing what I mean by our mountains. Afghanistan today is made up of one of the branches at the end of the Himalayan range. This region has been a focal point of migrations, trade, and empires for many millennia. We can not speak of the history of anything in Afghanistan without sometimes also referencing Parthia (the region around Mashhad today), Soghd (the region around Samarkand and Bukhara), and Gandhara (the Peshawar valley). If you look up these regions on a map, you will see that they are highly populated boundary regions to modern Afghanistan. So that when I speak of our mountains and the people in them, it would most definitely have to include these people as well. In a broader sense the entire [Āryānic (Iranic) plateau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Plateau), extending to eastern Turkey in the west, Soghd to the north, the Indus to the west and the Indian ocean to the south can also be seen to have a cohesive culture. This region was known as Āryāna. I will try to keep my focus of the history on modern Afghanistan, but the broader region shares much of the same history even if some details would be different and some lacking. \n\n**Bronze-Age Religion**\n\nWe know very little about the world in the 4000BC - 500 BC period. It is known as the bronze age. In this age religious symbolism was created and passed down orally. It was only in later ages that religious texts were created and abstract concepts became common with the emergence of a priestly class. Many deities were formed and passed around along trade routes. We have found many similarities between cultures in a very wide area. [Here are some examples of some similarities](https://i.redd.it/5rfju3fqprw61.jpg). [Introductory details can be found here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24048763?read-now=1&amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). In effect the entire Indo-European world shared a similar outlook of the world. One in which natural forces like fire took on the form of deities. They were intelligent enough to connect fire with the sun as well. They also had more abstract deities e.g. deities for fertility or war. There were rituals and mantras associated with each deity, much as one would find rituals around [espand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q32JTgKK1wI) or [warding off a curse with an egg ritual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5F0mxf4sVY). \n\n**Āryā Varta**\n\nThis is another region that is important to learn about. The western portion of the Indo-Gangetic plain was known as [ĀryāVarta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\\%C4\\%80ry\\%C4\\%81varta) in the past. Why does it share the same name Āryā? The people of our mountains called themselves the Āryā for many millennia. From this word we get Āryānā airlines. In the past there was a push to change the name of Afghanistan to Āryānā as well, I think this is still a good idea, not that it would solve a lot of problems (but it is a good idea). As far as we know the written history of the Āryā begins with the [Avestan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avestan) texts, these extend so far back we can\'t really date them, but we know they are older than 500BC. The oral history goes back further than the written history. There have been many waves of invasions into the Indo-Gangetic plain from our mountains. Why? Because the Indo-Gangetic plain has always had a high population living in a land that is lush. They always become rich and comfortable. The people of our mountains live in a harsher environment and thus live a more heroic lifestyle. This leads to an advantage in warfare. One of the earliest invasions that we have records about brought the Āryā from our mountains into the Indo-Gangetic plain. When the Āryā became the ruling class, the land became known as ĀryāVarta (the expanse of the Āryā). In the Indo-Gangetic plain the word Āryā began to represent the higher caste of society and it was from this meaning that European racists later borrowed the term Aryan. [There is a good retelling of the story here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzwDBiG2eZI).\n\n**The Vedas**\n\n[The Vedas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas) (a group of four books) are some of the oldest written texts which have been preserved. They are written in Sanskrit, a language still in use in formal settings, though as a spoken tongue it is now dead. Sanskrit, Avestan and Old Persian are very similar.\n\nHere are some examples: \n\n(Avestan) təm amavantəm yazatəm (Sanskrit) tam amavantam yajatam\n\n(Avestan) surəm damohu scvistəm (Sanskrit) suram dhamasu savistham\n\n(Avestan) miθrəm yazai zaoθrabyo (Sanskrit) mitram yajai hotrabhyah\n\nThe reason they are similar is that they were languages solidified around religious discourse. The religious discourse was itself very similar between these groups. At the time that the languages are known to have solidified (somewhere in the 1500BC-500BC period) the religious outlook itself was also similar. At this point the invasion of the Āryā had happened already. The oldest Veda is known as the [Rig Veda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda). It is interesting for us, because it seems to make references to our mountains. For example when the river Sarasvati (Harahvati) is mentioned, it resembles the Helmand river. The Sarayu (Harayu) resembles the Hari-Rud. The change from S to H is quite common between the languages of our mountains and the languages of the Indo-Gangetic plain. The later Vedas are more firmly established in the Indo-Gangetic plain. In essence the Rig Veda contains within it if not a memory then at least a shadow of the Āryā invasion into the Indo-Gangetic plain. Each of the Vedas contains four sections: Mantras, Rituals, Commentaries for Brahmans, and finally the Upanishads. The succession is clear, as one moves towards the ends of each Veda the content becomes more abstract. \n\n**Advaita Vedanta**\n\nIn my opinion the main thread through the Upanishads is simple and captured in [the Mahāvākyas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mah%C4%81v%C4%81kyas). My favourite of these is "Tat Tvam Asi \'\' which mean "You are that". This was heard by sages who were meditating in the foothills of the world\'s greatest mountains. Try for a moment to forget everything you have learned about the world. Imagine that you sit, meditating, listening to the universe. [You can try it for 15 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2vw6CyCTjU) right now if you like. Meditation is simple, it is listening to your inner self and the world around you consciously without reacting to it. After some time passes where you have made meditation a regular practice, two simple truths will become clear to you. One, there is within you something which experiences and is constant (in modern times we call this the soul). Two, you are experiencing a world around you (in modern times we call this the universe). Then comes the great insight of these sages. That which experiences the world, is the same as that which is experienced, in fact both are simply *experience* itself. At this point words lose their ability to create accurate meaning, because we have entered the world of esoteric secrets. I can not say more without you having meditated. What is important to carry from here is that these sages had an insight which was essentially "Tat Tvam Asi\'\'. We can try to recover some of its meaning by translating it as the following phrase: "You are that (which you seek)". This philosophy is known as [Advaita Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta). \n\n**Polytheism of Āryā**\n\nAdvaita Vedanta is an abstract philosophy. In contrast the mantras and rituals of the Vedas are to specific deities. The Avestan texts have similar mantras and rituals. There is almost a perfect match between Avestan and Vedic deities. These deities should not be thought of in terms of what we consider "God" today as that concept had not yet been introduced. No one in the past would conflate the meaning of "Tat Tvam Asi\'\' with a ritual to appease [Rudra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudra). "Tat Tvam Asi\'\' was in the domain of the sages, whereas rituals to appease Rudra were accessible to everyone in society. It would be a similar difference as between comprehending Rumi and performing Islamic prayers. Comprehending Rumi is in the domain of sages whereas performing prayers is accessible to everyone in society. Thus the polytheism was separate from this more subtle and deep understanding of the universe. Did the people of our mountains have something such as "Tat Tvam Asi\'\'? Certainly, if it had been born in the subcontinent it would have made its way back to us as the deities of our mountains had made their way into the subcontinent. Where did it go? It disappeared into Zoroaster\'s revolution! In fact Zoroaster\'s revolution needed something like "Tat Tvam Asi\'\' as a status quo to rebel against!\n\n**Zoroaster**\n\nZoroaster created an absolute revolution in thought sometime between 1500BC and 500BC. He is known as the prophet of Zoroastrianism which is often confused with the Avestan religion. The Avestan spirituality predates Zoroaster and was almost exactly the same as the Vedic spirituality. Zoroaster introduced a new concept, one that is so common in our daily lives that it is hard to imagine thought itself without this concept. Zoroaster introduced the concept of Good and Evil. "Tat Tvam Asi" has no moral stance. The many deities prior to Zoroaster have no absolute moral characteristic. They are characters in stories which were told around fires. They have stories and back stories and side stories. People were free to like one and dislike another. A tribe would select one as their deity for worship. This did not mean they stopped believing in the other deities nor that they believed their chosen deity represented an absolute Good. Zoroaster changed all of that. He declared that [Ahura Mazda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahura_Mazda) is the source of Good, and the [Angra Mainyu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angra_Mainyu) is the source of evil. Zoroaster split the pantheon into good deities (Ahuras) and evil deities (Daevas). This concept of an abstract "Good" and abstract "Evil" is a very tempting one. It makes stories exciting and engaging. Every story we tell today, religious or otherwise, generally contains some moral "Good" and "Evil". It is almost impossible to escape it. The philosopher Nietzsche is most well known for elaborating on this concept, it is he who definitively charges Zoroaster with the introduction of this concept. There are good historical reasons to consider the Zoroastrian revolution as the point in which religion fundamentally changed its form, however the same concept can be found in other traditions as well. For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to the introduction of this concept as Zoroaster\'s revolution in the upcoming sections. The people whose deities Zoroaster had declared evil did not sit still. They declared that the Asuras (Ahuras) were (usually) evil and the Devas (Daevas) were (usually) good. This concept did not take hold as firmly in the Indo-Gangetic plain as it had in our mountains. \n\n**Ramayana &amp; Mahabharata**\n\nThe revolution of Zoroaster was not adopted wholesale in the Indo-Gangetic plains becuase the sages replied to it. The Ramayana and the Mahabharata were solidified as an answer. These are both long epics with complex stories and characters. The stories themselves predate Zoroaster\'s revolution, however they were adopted as a reply to this new concept of Good and Evil which was spreading like wildfire. The Ramayana is older and has a simpler arc. The Mahabharata is newer and has a more complex story. A sober reading of either epic leaves one with more moral questions than answers. At the beginning of each epic the Good and the Evil are demarcated. In the Ramayana, Ram represents Good and Ravana represents evil. In the Mahabharata the Pandavas are Good and the Kauravas are evil. However by the end of the story, someone who has paid attention finds that the answer is not so simple. Ram commits many evil acts and the narrator justifies it using questionable logic. In the Mahabharata the Pandavas are aided by Krishna, the great joker. Krishna has no qualms about the nature of Good and Evil in his actions. I do not want to spoil either of those two magnificent epics. I will leave it to you to read about the “evil” acts committed by the Good side and the “good” acts committed by the Evil side. I will point out that this concept is a little rebellious but it is well within the norms of Hinduism. Ravana (the great villain of Ramayana) and Duryudhan (the great villain of Mahabharata) have temples dedicated to them. More recently the movie [Raavan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raavan) and the show [Dharmakshetra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmakshetra) explored these concepts in depth. The takeaway here is that the Zoraoster\'s revolution was halted in the Indo-Gangetic plain with a story in which at first Good and Evil are demarcated and later shown to be questionable. This undermines the idea that such a simplistic narrative device can express all that is required for divinity. A prime example is Krishna convincing Arjuna to commit an seemingly Evil act. the conversation in which Arjuna is convinced is itself the [Bhagavad Gita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita). It was added to the story of the Mahabharata sometime after the Zoroastarian revolution. \n\n**The Semites &amp; Zoroaster**\n\nThe Semites (proto-Arabs, Jews, Canaanites, etc) were completely enamoured with this new notion of Good and Evil. The Jews were one group of Semites which used the notion exceptionally well in their storytelling. The stories of [the old testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament) can be dated to the bronze age. They were however written and solidified in the aftermath of Zoroaster\'s revolution and the effect is visible to anyone who reads the old testament. The meat of the work is a rendition of the myths, traditions, and history of the Jews. However it is filled with justifications, such that the actions of the Jews are (in the end) Good. The actions of their enemies are Evil. The layer of morality added onto the stories is visible when the stories are compared to their Assyrian or Canaanite analogues. There are many indications in the earlier parts of the old testament that Yahweh is only the God of the Jews and that he does not have Good or Evil characteristics. He is simply their tribe\'s God, this is evident in the story of Abraham in the old testament. Later in the old testament (for example in the Ezekiel chapter) the arguments and justifications are completely based on morality. An interesting story in the old testament is the story of David and \n[Bathsheba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathsheba). In Islamic historiography, these are the Prophet David and Bathsheba, the mother of the prophet Sulaiman. [I encourage you to read the story in the bible itself](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel%2011&amp;version=NIV). It is incredible how terrible David\'s actions are which lead to the birth of Sulaiman. As the Semitic religion developed, they became more enamoured with the concept of Good and Evil. In the Jewish tradition David did some terrible things, but was later forgiven. In the Christian tradition, his asking for forgiveness elevated him. In the Muslim tradition, this story of his Evil act is never told and considered a corruption of the holy texts! As Semitic religions developed they became centered around the morality of Good and Evil with their analogs in heaven and hell. \n\n**Buddhism**\n\nThe people of the Indo-Gangetic plains also had another response to Zoroaster\'s revolution. Let\'s first look at how Zoroaster\'s revolution affected Hinduism. Remember that the sages of the Indo-Gangetic plain had made three discoveries which we can summarize as:\n\n1. You are a soul\n\n2. You are experiencing the world\n\n3. That which experiences and that which is experienced are one and the same. \n\nAs religion becomes common, it becomes stupid. This is evident in Afghan mullahs today. They are preoccupied with questions like "Should I enter the bathroom with my right foot or left?" The Indian religion had become stupid in this way as well. The Brahmans summarized these three discoveries as "you have an eternal soul". Then came the obvious question: \n\n"What happens when I die?" the commoners wondered.\n\n"If you do good deeds, you are reincarnated as something better. If you do bad deeds, you are reincarnated as something bad" the brahmans replied.\n\n"What are good deeds and bad deeds?" the commoners asked.\n\n"If you listen to me, that is Good. If you don\'t, that is Bad" the Brahmans replied. \n\nThis should remind us of what our Mullahs tell our children today "If you listen to what I say, then you will go to heaven. If you don\'t listen, then you go to hell."\n\n From the midst of such stupidity arose the Buddha. He found another way to express those same three discoveries. \n\n 1. That which is now called "I" is not eternal.\n\n 2. That which is experienced does not have an objective existence.\n\n 3. Experiencing the world unfiltered by an "I" is enlightenment. \n\nThis reply of the Buddha to Zoroaster\'s revolution is simple and unencumbered by the complexities of classical Hinduism. It spread like wildfire, especially in Zoroaster\'s homeland i.e. our mountains! The reply was so well accepted that our ancestors erected the largest Buddhas in existence. The [Buddhas of Bamiyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhas_of_Bamiyan) held that record for 15 centuries despite China and Japan adopting Buddhism. Try to imagine the impact of Buddhism on the people of our mountains. We are not a populous region of the world, that such a feat was accomplished speaks to the importance of the idea for the population. The Zoroastrians coexisted with the Buddhists and Hindus. It is more accurate to view these three as sects of the same religious ideology rather than different religions. This state of affairs continued until the next great shift, the invasion of the Sassanian empire by the Arabs.\n\n**Christianity**\n\nAlthough it is not well known, Christianity spread into our mountains as well in the form of [the church of the east](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_East)! If you have time I encourage you to read the four gospels (The first part of the New Testament). You will find in them the story of Jesus, who like the Buddha rejects the clergy\'s notion of Good and Evil. He turns all of Jewish morality on its head. [The parable of the Prodigal son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Prodigal_Son), [the calling of Mathew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLCSVjHKQjk) and other stories serve to show that this reduction of spirituality to Good and Evil is too simplistic to express true divinity. However in the later parts of the New Testament, Paul creates a religion of Good and Evil from Christianity itself! This is to show the power of Zoroaster\'s revolution. It is able to bend even ideas which rebel against it into ones that conform to it.\n\n\n**The arrival of Islam**\n\nArabs defeated the Sassanians and also the Hindu kings of Sindh in the first few decades of Islam\'s emergennce. Bactria, Heray and Sistan fell to the Arabs as well. However Ghor, Zabul and Gandhara would continue to be Buddhist / Hindu for two more centuries. You can read about the Turk Shahis, Hindu Shahis, and the Ghorids who were the last to fall to the Islamic invasions. Islam is the culmination of the Semitic religions adopting Zoroaster\'s revolution. Reading the Quran, one sees nothing of "Tat Tvam Asi". There is a complete separation between the existence of God and his subjects. The elucidation of Good and Evil are the central thesis of the Quran. The enumeration of the rewards and punishments for Good and Evil are ubiquitous. This would not have been well received by a people who had already rejected Zoroaster\'s revolution through the adoption of Buddhism. Islam however had become a part of life. Every major ruler since the invasions has been a Muslim. There have always been Mullahs that persecute those who proclaim the earlier faiths or even reference to it. A most famous example is that of [al-Hallaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hallaj) who was hanged for the utterance "I am God". \n\n**The solution to our puzzle**\n\nSo, what did our people do in these conditions? They wrote poetry. The poem of Bedil which I started with references the daring path to enlightenment that al-Hallaj embarked upon. al-Hallaj and before him Bayazid said “I am God”. This is nothing other than “I am Brahman”, it is one of the Mahāvākyas. Our poets expressed their faith in this poetry and fit it within an Islamic framework. Thus was born the Sufi traditions. It is not a coincidence that the rise of modern Persian poetry coincided with two events. First the throwing out of the Arab Ummayads by [the Saffarids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffarid_dynasty) of Sistan and later [the Samandis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samanid_Empire) of Soghd. Second, the rise of the Sufi traditions. The moment some political freedom was gained, our ancestors wrote in a language that was native to their land about a spirituality that was native to their land. They treated Islam as our ancient ancestors would have treated the introduction of a new diety i.e. new rituals and new mantras for commoners. The scholarly class dealt in poetry and spirituality, while the mullah was relegated to the baser work of rituals. This state of things where the scholars write poetry for the kings, and the mullahs are completely subservient to that tradition has generally been the norm with some exceptions e.g Aurengzeb. It is only in the modern era (the last century) that the mullahs have claimed to be the spiritual leaders in our mountains. This happened through the introduction of "fundamentalist" Islam from outside our mountains. Fundamentalist Islam aims to take over the space of sages and give it to mullahs. The result is modern Afghanistan.\n\nI will conclude this with a [poem of Rumi](https://ganjoor.net/moulavi/shams/robaeesh/sh157/), which has a famous distorted translation. It is often translated as: "Out beyond ideas of wrong-doing and right-doing there is a field. I’ll meet you there."\n\nI will present you a more correct translation and you can see everything I have written thus far reflected in it: \n\n**External to Islam and Kufr there is a field - We have a business in the midst of that space**\n\n**When a scholar reaches there, he drops his mind - In there is no Kufr, no Islam, nor a space**'<br />Author: 'AfgCric'  id: 'n4ty56'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n4ty56/spirituality_in_the_afghan_mountains_as_i_have/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'A Rant on Rahul Gandhi and "Death of Democracy"'<br />Body: 'PS - I had posted this before counting of votes on May 2nd. But it was removed by automod and took a while to be approved. Mods told me to post it again, so here it is\n\nThis is triggered by a guardian article by Arundhati Roy where she criticises every step of the Modi govt since 2014 (I have no problem with that) and then slips in casually that the Election Commission is compromised and where polling happens in one phase usually in Bengal, it was made into 8 phases only this time.\n\nFirstly, this is a blatant lie. WB has perhaps the highest political violence in the country and even in 2016 polling was held in 6 phases. Same with 2011. And I don\'t understand how this argument works that just because there are more phases it can benefit one party over the other. But more than this, I want to rant on Rahul Gandhi and him constantly saying Democracy is dead in India, elections aren\'t free and fair.\n\nIn 2014 he won Amethi. Smriti Irani lost. But Smriti Irani still kept visiting Amethi and kept up her ground-work. So in 2019, this guy instead of standing his ground and campaigning harder was busy screaming chowkidar chor hai, a slogan which had 0 mass appeal. He promised to repeal AFSPA in his manifesto, screamed here and there about NYAY. And then ran away to Wayanad. If you goof around like this and neglect your own constituency, of course you\'ll get wiped out. But no, Indian democracy is dead.\n\nThen he goes to Kerala to campaign for 2021 elections. And he says oh you south Indians are so enlightened and you talk about real issues, north Indians are different. Firstly, those same "illiterate, unenlightened" north Indians are the ones voting for you from decades over there. Actually as their education increased they began to reject you. So if you lose, then the voters are idiots, because any enlightened person would know that you are the right choice. Ok, let us assume that this is true. Can you explain why, after sweeping Kerala in 2019 general elections, your party is now projected to lose there according to every exit poll? Power alternates between Communists and Congress in Kerala from past so many elections, but as soon as you entered the fray, that pattern is broken. What happened that in just 2 years, those highly educated, enlightened people had enough of you? Is that the fault of Indian democracy? How will you blame the voters for this one? After all these enlightened people will not fall prey to "BJP Propaganda" and aren\'t like casteist, communal North Indians right?\n\nAlliance with you is fatal for every party in India. Tejaswi Yadav found that out the hard way - he gave your party 70 seats in Bihar and you returned a measly 19 wins. You hate BJP and are desperate to keep them out of power, here you were with a resurgent regional ally that had momentum on its side and you single-handedly ruined their chances. Is that the fault of the EC? What is it about your party particularly that even when a state has an even contest and BJP is looking on shaky ground, voters still make sure to reject you?\n\nIn TN your head sat for a meeting with DMK to discuss seat-sharing. You demanded 50 seats. At the end of the meeting he was so humiliated that he left in tears and DMK said to him "We don\'t need you, you need us". Parties are learning their lessons from looking at other states. Even in a state where it was clear from the start that the entire narrative and ground-mood is anti BJP and anti-incumbency, the party didn\'t want to give you anything. Whose fault is that? Is DMK also a BJP-agent?\n\nYour own party leaders are in open rebellion. They question why you ally with blatantly communal parties like ISF in Bengal and AIUDF in Assam. You are the sworn enemy of communists in Kerala but ally with them in Bengal. And yet the truth is that every time a credible alternative to the BJP is there, the Indian voter has given them a chance! Gujarat 2017, you roped in Hardik Patel, Mevani and some other rebels, stitched an alliance and almost beat BJP in their fortress. Did you consolidate? No, you again went missing in action and now AAP is replacing you as the BJP alternative in urban bodies.\n\nIn Karnataka you spewed venom against JD(S) and then allied with them. The voters let you know what they thought about that in 2019. In AP, Telangana, Odisha, strong parties with a proper narrative and energised workers keep the BJP out. You supposedly are starved of funds, how do these small parties do so well against the BJP then?\n\nYou jump from blunder to blunder. The gains you make you do not consolidate. You take voters for granted then abuse them when they don\'t vote for you. No party wants to ally with you. You weaken every party you ally with. You have no clear ideology, no clear stand. And all this while the Indian voter always gives a chance to non-BJP parties if they are credible and work hard. I\'m tired of you insulting Indian voters and Indian democracy. And I\'m tired of you using International forums to do this.

They are also very short sighted. Regional Parties tend to play the regionalism card to get votes\n\nI think the BJP understood earlier that it should win 270 seats by itself to ensure that the reforms are able to pass through. Even in the much maligned UPA 2 whenever they tried to pass some reforms they were usually held back to TMC or SP or BSP and any reform the Congress government tried to introduce were rolled back due to alliance partners threatening to bring down the government\n\nI feel India should move towards more the US system of Democracy where there are 2 major parties instead of regional parties. The Opposition should stop relying on regional parties and more on itself to come back to power. The Congress should rely on itself to get 270 seats in the Lok Sabha to return to power.'<br />Author: 'adiman93'  id: 'n4iom9'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n4iom9/regional_parties_do_not_have_the_countrys_best/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Power of Compounding - 3 examples'<br />Body: "“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it  earns  it… he who doesn’t… pays it.” - Albert Einstein\n\nthis is a great calculator with chart - [https://www.hdfclife.com/financial-tools-calculators/compound-interest-calculator](https://www.hdfclife.com/financial-tools-calculators/compound-interest-calculator)\n\n# Example One - Ajay, 23 years old, just started a job of 40k rs per month, no previous savings or investments.\n\nLets say Ajay starts a modest SIP of Rs 4000 per month. He lives in bangalore which is a high cost city.\n\nfor   the next 5 years, he pays the same Rs 4000 / month even if his salary   increases. He expects to withdraw this amount at the age of 70.\n\nHe will stop paying any amount after the 5th year and let the compounding do its magic.\n\nSo, Rs 4000 / month SIP, 13% annual returns, 70-23  = 47 years of investment time, 5 years of SIP payments.\n\nAfter  **47** years, his investment of **₹ 2.40 lakhs** will grow to **₹ 7.74 cr (at 13% pa).**\n\nIf he has a house paid off by then, hopefully 7.74Cr in 47 years would be worth something.\n\n# Example Two - Rahul (not Gandhi lol), 40 years old, Software Developer, earns 25 LPA, married and two kids.\n\nRahul   is currently paying the home loan of his fancy apartment and a new  car.  His wife doesnt work anymore and after paying for the school fees  of 2  kids, he is left with Rs 30k / month.\n\nHe   currently has a Fixed Deposit of Rs 10 lakhs fetching him a measly 6%   per annum. He never invested in stock market because of his father's   beliefs.\n\nSo now he wants to start   an SIP of Rs 10k per month and put a lumpsum deposit of Rs 10 lakhs.   this 10k / month SIP will be payed for 20 years.\n\nHe will encash at age 60 (20 years investment duration).\n\nSo at 13% pa, at the age of 60, he will get **2.47Cr**. had he NOT put the initial deposit of Rs 10 lakhs, he would be looking at just **1.15Cr**.\n\n# Example   3 - Mukesh, 21, is a auto driver in Mumbai. He earns Rs 40k / month.   His family is in Bihar and is recently blessed with a baby boy.\n\nHe   sends all his savings to Bihar and his family spends almost all of it.   They have a bank account but don't have any FDs. Gold and Village land   is the only savings they have.\n\nMukesh   learns a lot by reading Hindi Business newspapers and ferrying   customers near dalal street. He dares to ask questions to his riders   about mutual funds and other savings options. Some of his riders give   genuine advice, some just laugh at him.\n\nMukesh   also knows that without english education and good quality schooling,   his son will meet the same fate as him. So he decides to setup a modest   SIP of just Rs 1000 / month in his son's name.\n\nHe   decides that he will pay these SIPs till his son is 18 years of age  and  then let his son pay those EMIs for the rest of his life.\n\nWith   no initial deposit, Rs 1000 / month SIP, 13% pa, 18 years payments,  his  corpus grew to 8.63 lakhs after 18 years. Not a lot of amount.\n\nHis son stopped the SIP payments at age 18 and soon forgot about his father's investments.\n\nAfter   many years, at the age of 60, Mukesh's son rediscovered his father's   SIP investment which was stopped when he turned 18. This corpus has now   grown to **19.71Cr (at 13% pa)**. He couldn't believe his eyes.\n\nHad he continued the SIP payments from age 18 to 60 of just Rs 1000 / month, he would be looking at **Rs 21.83Cr**. Not a lot of increase."<br />Author: 'popat_mohamad'  id: 'n4he4i'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n4he4i/power_of_compounding_3_examples/</li>

      <li>Title::: "People who won't defend themselves cannot be defended by anyone. For thousands of years we have been killed murdered and looted yet we sleep in deep slumber. Yet we just complain, cry and point fingers at those who help us. Until Hindus wake up no one can save them."<br />Body: 'Over the last few days, I have been observing the changes in this sub and among my friends and families with some concern.\n\nIt started first with the nationwide crisis dramatic and unexpected COVID second wave, and the emergence of a more deadly new strain. Understandably people panicked. In the Mainstream, some well known critics of the government started their blame game almost immediately before the facts were in. Our neighboring sub and the journals like Wire etc amplified all this.  Not unexpected. But then something strange started happening as the panic and misinformation spread. People who were otherwise pro Modi and BJP, started blaming them too, slowly at first but with increasing stridency. Until they were repeating the exact same talking points as the liberal/ left media.\n\nThe other more recent event that happened was the aftermath of the Bengal elections. Almost immediately some started blaming Modi, etc for “losing” Bengal. If only Modi had done this or that BJP would have won according to them. Again, I can understand the disappointment of these folks.  At least they were not celebrating like the liberals, and some actually listened to the argument that BJP going from 2 seats to 77 is not a “defeat.” But then the killing and rape of BJP workers/ Hindus happened and once again the immense anger that people on the Hindu side felt was directed at Modi, Amit Shah. Why are they not doing anything. Vote for another party next time. Etc. You’ve all seen these arguments being made. Again, while much of this is coming from the so-called nationalist right, you can be sure that those opposed to Modi are fanning the flames with concern trolling and casting Modi as the villain. Not Mamata, not the TMC, not the many jihadis who are playing an outsize role in all this.\n\nIt is distressing to see people turn on the one person that has done more for India and Hindus since independence. Hindus show that they can forget a 100 good deeds at the first sign of adversity and will bite the very hand that fed them. Modi again, according to these people, should do this or should have done that. Why is not calling out the army, or declaring presidents rule etc. These options are not possible and I can get into that if you want.\n\nIn these last few years, I have seen Hindus (not those in the RSS or Bajarag Dal), do nothing but complain about things not going far or fast enough for their liking but not lift a finger themselves. I see people of other comminutes come together and protest, riot even if a single member of their tribe is hurt, raped or killed.\n\nWhen Modi and Hindus are attacked in our press and around the world, I don’t see conservatives writers pen editorials in the major newspapers or everyday Hindus even share the terrible things being done to their co-religionists. Or demand that the press even cover these killings of Hindus and their saints. The rape and abduction of their women. But they are stridently attacking others for not doing enough.\n\nChange does not come about from the top. People have to be committed and willing to fight and die for it. There is this tendency to wait for the government, or police or someone else do something rather than ourselves.\n\nThis is not meant to be a rebuke of the many Hindus who feel something is seriously wrong but just an observation that if we want to change things, it will take time, effort, commitment and perseverance. Just today I read tweets by people like Abhijit Aiyer and others blaming Modi. We need to stop attacking each other and focus on understanding what is happening, educating others, learning strategy and tactics.\n\nSome of you may remember the planning and strategy behind Shaheen Bagh that came from some people JNU. That is what it takes to start a movement to pressure governments to act. Similarly, the Naxals and their supporters have a detailed strategy with a long time frame and covers both indoctrination of the population and also tactics. This requires study, effort and commitment.  \n\nEven the people from the other sub have tactically out flanked the conservatives. They have captured sub after sub, including large non-Indian subs. This did not happen by chance. This was planned and executed in a coordinated manner.\n\nI cannot recall any such expose of conservative planning and as far as I have seen there is no such effort.\n\nWrote this rather quickly so sorry for any errors.

Personally I fond this attitude both shocking and disgusting.\n\nFirstly, before I move on to the main point in question - we are dealing with a country where people will brashly claim that the government lockdowns are global conspiracy for, in some way or other, a form of manipulation and control, then suddenly criticise the same government of not doing enough if they happen to actually catch the virus and learn first hand *gasp* that it actually does exist. A country where going out after work for coffee or ice cream is more important than self-isolating because *don’t worry kuch nahi hoga*. A country where people, knowingly infected with coronavirus,  will gladly ignore the fact, just so as not to be socially marginalised by friends and family, instead attending functions surrounded by dozens, hundreds or even thousands of other people. I am sorry to say but there is only so much the government can do when faced with such perpetual stupidity, selfishness and ignorance.\n\nIf we rewind last year, despite being home to nearly 20% of the world population, India had one of the lowest relative rates of corona in the whole world. Their was tremendous effort and success in curbing infection rates, one to be proud of. With the unrolling of nationwide vaccinations, everyone including the government apparently, and naturally let their guards down. No ordinary human being could have foreseen the astonishing mutability that coronavirus would display, ultimately morphing into a viral nightmare completely impervious to induced immunisations, completely nullifying the efficacy of bharats vaccination programmes and even evading detection using conventional means of testing that were created and distributed from over seas.\n\nI do find it extremely suspicious that all other neighbouring countries have not heard so much as a whimper about the new strains. The west is pretty much back to normal. Eating, drinking and being merry as if nothing ever even happened, where’s india is stuck in viral purgatory. And this comes at a time when bold moves by the Indian government unnerved the CCP more than ever before. No other prime minister in history has so strategically managed to retract chinese stronghold over indian state affairs. And now out of nowhere is ground zero of a viral attack which is virtually alien to the rest of the world and right next door to the country which most are pinning the blame on, be a natural disaster or the obtuse nature of corona in itself - a man made weapon of mass destruction...\n\nAnd now with nationwide political upheaval, it does make you wonder...'<br />Author: 'VSK-1'  id: 'n3kzmu'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n3kzmu/corona_second_wave_an_act_of_sabotage_to/</li>

The ratio would be worse now. Last year, when we should have been preparing for the pandemic, the government was forced to spend a huge amount of money to deal with China, with emergency deployment of forces and military purchases. The situation has been supposedly "deescalated" now, but we never know for certain. We do now have a settled border with China, as China refused to acknowledge the McMahon line. And we can never have a settlement because any kind of compromise would be played up by the political parties for electoral gain.\n\nAllegedly, about the loss of Aksai Chin, even Nehru is reported to have said in Parliament “not a single blade of grass grows there."

But his appeal is getting really bad in states especially outside Hindi heartland.He's the only reformer that India seen other than Atalji. But quick reforms can't be conveyed into public easily as he think. Let's take an example of the farm bill. It's a reform that can increase the income of farmers in future. Modi didn't use his popularity to pacify the farmers before or after passing the bill. This creates alot of confusion and there is no one else in his party or in state govt. to explain the merits of the bill. Events like this are slowly turning public against him especially the poor. States outside the hindi belt are not fond of modi as he thinks. He should immediately solve this somehow.\n\n**Rearrangement of leaders representing BJP as frontface.**\n\nBJP is not using leaders that have great appeal to public. Gadkari si the only person in the BJP arsenal who posess great appeal other than Modi. I sometimes think that Modi is purposefully avoid Gadkari to Influence people. Relying Amit shah and Yogiji as frontface is worst mistake taken by BJP. For example you can't bring Yogiji to Tamil Nadu or Kerala and teach them to learn from UP model of development. It simply don't work.Amit shah is clinging to the mandir-masjid deplomacy to create more hatred towards BJP. Gadkari is trying to maintain a holistic approach to appease every politician in the country [https://youtu.be/d3ATwaGqyz8?t=268](https://youtu.be/d3ATwaGqyz8?t=268) .here you can see that in the video. BJP should use him and change the narrative that it's because of him and party all these development happened so fast.\n\n**Raising new leaders in states.**\n\nYou can't always rely on modi to run from states to states to campaign for elections. Just look at Manmohan singh even though he is a silent baba. As a PM he didn't have to campaign alot during his era because of powerful local leaders in the state itself.Young leaders like Jyotiraditya Scindia should be turn into leaders on their state itself.\n\n**Take advantage of poverty in India for election.**\n\nWhat ever Infrastructure and Industry development happen,India will be a poor state for a longtime. 75% of the population can't earn above 400 Rs daily. Congress preyed on this with giving subsidies and fake hope to farm the votes. BJP don't need to pamper the poor like the congress did. But give them foodkits before 6 or more months of election. [Here's a food kit](https://img.onmanorama.com/content/dam/mm/en/news/kerala/images/2020/3/29/covid-food-kit.jpg.transform/onm-articleimage/image.jpg) given by Kerala govt twice per month for half an year. It worked and gave them 100 seats this time. Mamata did the same in bengal,even promising upto June this year.\n\n**Don't waste resources on states that guarantee no return in near future**\n\nIt's a pipe dream that Resources can be spent on every states and improve them. India don't have that kind of money. Even if she do the states won't vote like BJP desires. Funds should be used in states where BJP has a presence already.BJP lost Jharkhand and Rajasthan earlier. Use the money to improve Infra there and change the perseption of people. Communists in the kerala will try to milk every drop from center they can. Same can be said for Punjab,Telangana and TN as of now.\n\n**BJP needs allies outside NDA**\n\nRegional parties(especially from non-hindi states) will always see BJP as an outsider and a threat.Some of the reforms are necessary for the country but carefully executing them can create more allies. Jagan of Andhra is slowly aligning to BJP but all of a sudden privtisation of vizag steel plant made a ruckus in Andhra. I was observing the situation and Jagan initially tried to go silent on this and had to come out against because of public protest. BJP can avoid this by holding or even stopping the plan. For fucks sake it's a damn steel plant. Even air India can't be privatize easily. Being a reformer is good. But sometimes you have to make compromise.\n\n[Next year election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_elections_in_India) is far more important for BJP than today's. It must do some changes ASAP.\n\nMy personal view about BJP : I'm from Kerala. BJP has no presence here because of weak leadership in the state. India has suffered alot because of shitty socialist policy of congress in the past. BJP or NDA is the only party that can implement reforms in the country. For that to continue a presence in the state govt is important as in centre. Modi is a great leader but he should step down a little bit for others in the party to make an entrance.\n\nHope everything will turn out better soon!"<br />Author: 'settayi'  id: 'n34mpl'<br />Score:92<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n34mpl/its_time_for_bjp_to_change_its_strategy_towards/</li>

In search of better health care, better quality of living, and a more rational ruling class.\n\nFor the rest of us are going to stay back either due to lack of opportunities, or due to unbreakable ties, I beg you to commit yourself to one or more of the following:\n\n1. Start a business and create jobs. India needs a lot more TATAs and Birlas to progress. Even if you remain a single person company forever, you’d have freed up the one “slot” of employment you’d have otherwise taken, and would eventually contribute to smaller businesses that your business would build a dependency on. If this is something you’ve considered but not executed on due to a lack of motivation, please listen to Naval’s take on deterministic wealth creation: https://youtu.be/1-TZqOsVCNM\n\n2. Become a leader. It’s easy for all of us to do running commentary sitting in the comforts of our homes. While commentary and criticism are necessary for a democracy to function, they alone will not move things forward. We need actors. I hope some of us will be motivated enough to be the force we want to see. Talk to the local parties and find out who you can coexist with, and see how you can improve things for your hometown. Optimal management on grass root levels is sufficient for this country to progress. Our country is so diverse that a supreme leader can never do what’s best for everyone. Let’s ignore that ideology and put our heads down and work on fixing what we can at our home towns.\n\n3. Think rationally and teach others to do the same. Things are rarely black and white, and it’s important to acknowledge the nuances of the greys to work and converse with people we disagree with. Thanks to the internet, we were more privileged than our parents to grow up in a society that was better connected. Let’s put that exposure to good use and become less dramatic, more rational, more useful citizens.\n\n———\n\nThat’s all there is in my head. We’ve spoken enough about the problems. Now let’s discuss the solutions and make memes out of them. \n\nIt would be an insult to all of our intellects if we did not progress as a group at the end of this pandemic.

The level of expectations and aggression is really unprecedented. It’s overwhelming. Everyone feels they should get the vaccine. They can’t understand why anyone else should get it before them,” Poonawalla reportedly said to The Times.\n\nPoonawalla explained the calls he receives normally start with exchanging pleasantries before it drifts in a “very different direction”. “They are saying if you don’t give us the vaccine, it’s not going to be good…It’s not the foul language, it’s the tone. It’s the implication of what they might do if I don’t comply. It’s taking control,” he said.\n\nHe further added, “I’m staying here (Britain) extended times because I don’t want to go back to that situation. Everything falls on my shoulders but I can’t do it alone…I don’t want to be in a situation where you are trying to do your job, and just because you can’t supply the needs of X, Y and Z you really don’t want to guess what they are going to do.”\n\nAdar Poonawalla given Y category security cover\nDue to the threats the SII CEO is receiving, the union home ministry on Wednesday had announced that he will be provided with Y category security cover. The ‘Y’ category security comprises 11 personnel, including one or two commandoes and police personnel.\n\nThe centre’s decision had come after Director, Government and Regulatory Affairs, at the Serum Institute, Prakash Kumar Singh wrote to Union Home Minister Amit Shah on April 16 requesting security for Poonawalla. In the letter, Singh had stated that Poonawalla has been getting threats from various groups regarding the COVID-19 vaccine supplies.'<br />Author: 'littichoka'  id: 'n2o1jp'<br />Score:216<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n2o1jp/poonwalla_says_hell_stay_in_uk_for_extended_time/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Why does Modi do the things he does?'<br />Body: 'COVID has left Modi between a rock and a hard place.\n\nHe\'s an astute once in a generation politician who understands all the moves in the game. The first time around he correctly divined that he\'d get tarred and feathered by the world press if he didn\'t go into lockdown, so India had containment policies that none of the liberal left could criticize. He was on point when it came to mask wearing and exhorting caution. However India is not a rich country, and lockdowns are a first world solution.\n\nThe aftermath of COVID ROUND 1 was a wrecked Indian economy, and an angry voter base that is largely poor and living on daily wages. Saying he had fought off COVID didn\'t translate into votes. The economy is critical to Modi, his politics are 100% about outmaneuvering the many divisions in India with economic progress. Even if the world press and even his opponents think it is about Hindutva or political power consolidation, in his mind such tactics only exist to give him the power to boost the economy even further. He firmly believes "Economic growth solves all known problems", and for that you need total political power.\n\nConsequently, COVID Round 2 as far as I can tell, is an experiment to see if the outcome is any better if the focus isn\'t pulled away from the economy. Religion and politics, i.e. Political rallies and the Kumbh Mela are some of the largest drivers of the economy in the rural landscape where big spending events are rare. The world press doesn\'t vote in India, and it can at best influence the urban english speaking voters who rarely vote for him anyway.\n\nModi\'s politics and policies are shaped keeping his typical voter in mind - say a street food vendor of fried snacks. A pakoda seller only profits when there\'s a crowd, only when the markets are busy and the buses run full.\n\n90% of India\'s economy simply doesn\'t function if everyone sits at home.

Indians have been blaming their governments all the time and yet none of their problems get solved. I think at some point, people should have taken a step back and do some soul-searching as to why Indian governments, whether in Federal or State level hardly solve any of their problems, in this case with adequate medical infrastructure to deal with Covid. \n\nTo see why it persistently fails in India, we need to look at how it works in some countries and what's the difference between them and India. Looking at China, where it originated but is successfully controlled now, their government has 1) A lot more financial resource to build infrastructure, perhaps about 5 times more judging by the size of China's GDP compared to India.\n\n2) CCP in China has so much control over the society. People who disobey are punished brutally. This helps in situations where a lot of social discipline is needed to contain a virus. Outside of China, we also see countries like Japan, S. Korea where people are so adherent to SOPs laid government. In India, there is so much mistrust over whatever the government says, and it becomes a vicious cycle where the mistrust causes governments not to be able to successfully implement any social policy. For example, how many people are wearing a mask properly in the streets? And how many who don't get fined? Also, how many are paying their due income tax, so that the tax money can be channeled to healthcare? \n\nI'm not saying that politicians have no blame for some of the things they have done. But ruminating on that doesn't solve any of your problems. The next guy in power will also face the same problems. A huge part of the problem is because of the huge distrust that was built over the decades. The solution has to be bottom-up instead of top-down.

Oct 2020 is also suspiciously near Sept 2020 when last peak of covid was reached. It is as if some bureaucrat was woken up to speed up the tender process AFTER the massive wave hit in Sept 2020 and no attention was paid to this in March-Sept timeframe. EVEN after tenders were floated, no follow up was done to ensure installation is done in those hospitals till [scroll.in](https://scroll.in) published a scathing piece on it. Its only then we came to know that out of 180 hospitals/concentrators tendered only 30 or so were "installed". We don\'t know how many were functional.

      <li>Title::: 'Reasons why BJP will always have my vote.'<br />Body: "I will skip the preamble and get right to it.\n\n1. I live on the outskirts of a tier 3 city. 15 years ago there were no roads leading to my locality, forget streetlights. During the monsoons the kuccha roads would be flooded and in the darkness of nighttime there was no easy way of navigating through them. After 2014, they built roads, tar, not cement, nothing fancy. Then came the street lights. In my locality where there were three houses and a building before the roads were built, every vacant plot was sold and within 5 years, the locality was full of residents.\n\n\n2. My father never cared for politics when I was little, so when we didn't have roads, he used to go to the ward corporator and request for roads. The requesting turned into pleading after a while. It was a NCP corporator and he did not budge. He was famous for being corrupted but who wasn't? My father persisted for a year or two then gave up.\n\nLater he let it slip in frustration to our neighbors that he would rather vote for someone who actually does some work. Someone snitched to our ward corporator and when the corporation elections came, my father was told to his face, by the sneering corporator that his name was not in the voter list. \n\nMy father was not allowed to vote for the next state or Lok Sabha elections. This was before voter empowerment through gov apps.\n\nFor this reason alone I will never ever vote NCP.\n\n\n3. The one building that was near us used to release the septic tank effluent on the road. A hotel that came up a little ways away from my house did the same. There was no plan to carry sewage away to even a river or a stream, let alone a treatment plant. \n\nKids used to think that these streams were puddles of water and stomp and play in them. It consisted of solid waste too, just to make it clear. \n\n2 years ago under swachh Bharat sarvekshan, they built drain systems and penalised the building society and the hotel. Mind you, the drains are open, we can smell and see it all, but it's a huge improvement.\n\n\n4. The railway station was a dark place quite literally. If someone was supposed to alight after midnight we used to go in groups to pick them up. Roofs did not cover the entire platforms. If it rained and your bogie stopped in the open part of the station you would be drenched.\n\nThey put floodlights outside the station and the whole station inside is well lit now. Roof span the entire plaforms. Guard duty and patrolling is regular. \n\n5. After 20 years of residing our old water connection was clogged it seems. Water only tricked in. Not a surprise since our old connection was made with galvanized iron pipes, which have a Lifetime of 10 years. Probably rusted. We went to apply for a replacement connection, they said sure just fill up a form and we will replace the connection asap.\n\nThe asap never came. We followed up for 2 months, they didn't do it. The bureaucracy is still shit. So we went to the new corporator. He's from BJP. He said that usually people pay 10-20k rupees to get a new connection. We said it's too much, and we already have a connection we just need to replace it. He said he will look into it. It took the corporator another month of arm twisting to convince the water department to finally do the job. The bribe came down to 3000 rupees. This was the incident that made me realize how powerless the elected members were in front of bloody clerks.\n\n6. There are 2 primary healthcare centers run by govt in my town. Most medicine is subsidized and consultation is free. These were established 3 years ago. My friend was bit by a dog and he got 3 shots of rabies vaccine for free.\n\nI got my parents vaccinated for free in these centers for free.\n\n\nPeople think everyone votes for BJP on religious grounds. It couldn't be away from the truth. If the condition of my tier three city was so bad in terms of infra, imagine people in villages who are getting electricity and water for the first time. I have literally seen my city transform into something better.\n\nThere are still issues. And the issues outnumber the solutions. But for the first time I am seeing work being done in my city. And from what I can gather on the news, work is being done elsewhere too.\n\nThat's it.

When China was at its shittiest, the U.S saw it as an opportunity to take advantage of its cheap labor to benefit its companies and mass produce cheap stuff there. What they didn't expect back then was it would make the Chinese middle class too strong and establish China as one of the most important markets in the world. They didn't foresee that the Chinese middle-class becoming even 1/5th as rich as the US middle class would mean China would become A HUGE threat to US hegemony. Today, China rivals the U.S and is THE only threat the US has to its hegemony and THE only potential superpower. if not a superpower already. \n\nNow let's take a look at India, it's the only other country that has over a billion people, and much like China, if the middle class becomes 1/5th or 1/3rd as rich as the US, India would become a direct threat to US hegemony and quash its ambitions to be the only superpower in the world. India has never fully aligned itself with a superpower, sure it has supported some, but its always walked its own path trying to become its OWN country that doesn't take orders from a major power. While in the short term, it benefits both the US and India to counter China's massive power, but in the long term, US does not want India to become the next China. It doesn't want another country that won't take its bullying or another country where its companies would flock to. It doesn't want another middle-class to counter it or competition from another country's companies. \n\nQUAD, in my opinion, is the U.S's strategy to attempt to control India, maybe even hinder its progress. There is no reason for the US to WANT India to be successful. At the end of the day, some of their strongest allies include Saudi Arabia, it's clear they don't care whether a country is a free liberal democracy or a brutal dictatorship, as long as they toe the U.S line and don't become a threat to it. India, due to her size, has no choice but to eventually become a threat to U.S hegemony, it's an eventuality. The only way it doesn't, is if there's some way the U.S can stop the exponential rise of India and perhaps trap it into the middle-income trap like South American countries and South Africa. \n\nDiscuss?"<br />Author: 'PM_ME_YOUR_BISON'  id: 'n0cppg'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n0cppg/quad_isnt_a_us_move_to_contain_china_its_a_us/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Misrepresentation by foreign media'<br />Body: 'Do you know what Global media has managed to propagate to half of the world using inputs from Rana Ayyub, Barkha Dutt etc? \n\nIt’s that Half of India is dead only because other half of India visited a Hindu festival named Kumbh mela which their fascist dictator PM and election stealer Modi forced them to visit and now entire India is having funeral pyres even on streets, gardens, stadiums and If you see from space, India looks like a giant cremation ground where millions are being burnt. \n\nI am not exaggerating but in last few days almost every foreigner I know has been worrying that India is burning away. Their concern is very genuine and from the heart but the input which they have got has magnified the problem by 10000x. \n\nThis is what likes of Barkha etc. can achieve in global conscience using Goebbels strategy of targeted rampant disinformation, half lies, stark grim “stunning” images of funeral pyres and mentioning Kumbh even if discussion is about Elon Musk and his wealth. \n\nThere is no alternative press in India or abroad who will keep agenda aside and report the truth. \n\n1 out of 7000 Indians has died due to Cov!d Pandemic while 1/500 Britisher or American has died. That’s 14 times more casualties. But India is burning while US and UK are not Coffining. Simply because funeral images shot by some Jih@dis make up for stunning image to push through agenda of burning India. \n\nIndia’s case fatality rate to infected is 1.2%. \nUK, US, Brazil are at 3%. So if you get a positive result, a person in UK or anywhere in the western world is 2.5 times more likely to succumb. Isn’t it ironic that 1 death out of 100 Infected is blamed on Kumbh mela and Bengal election rally of only 2 men while 99 surviving is due to dirt and filth in India giving them some Immunity. \n\nAnother lie which is propagated by power of implication is that India is hiding its death numbers. Barkha is doing this job the best by sitting on cremation grounds with only firewood being shown and then putting up open ended implications that 30 deaths in this place, 26 in Nashik, imagine how many more? \nTruth is if anyone goes to cremation ground you know that every death is perfectly recorded and you simply can’t cremate someone without paper work. Indian Hindus might be the only community in world which have kept records of their dead in ghats for last few centuries. \n\nAsk Sachin Vaze, Indrani Mukherjee about how difficult it is to hide a dead body in India. You simply cannot make a body disappear unless you are Walter White from Breaking Bad who has unlimited access to extremely corrosive acids or you are a Bahubali of UP in times of Mulayam and Akhilesh with their tanks full of acid or crocodiles or own personal kingdoms like that of Kaleen Bhaiyya where they could do anything. \n\nCovid has surely caused an uptick in deaths and hence systems and infrastructures which are created gets overloaded. The cremation grounds are overwhelmed and the handling staff has to speed up as bodies decompose and also there are restrictions on rituals which can be performed or number of people who can attend. Hence many bodies are cremated together. It’s a logistical challenge and a practical solution considering there are no strict rules in Hinduism which doesn’t allow taking some liberty when situation demands. \nMore than relatives of dead, it’s Barkhas who are making a ruckus. As if they ever cared for any Indian dead or alive. \nI can still say with full assurance that nowhere in India freezer trucks with bodies are being parked like Cuomo did in US, no one is undercounting the dead like again Cuomo did to win an election and nowhere we are stocking toilet paper, having riots for hospital beds. \nYes we have many corrupt people including some doctors and especially some notorious politicians who are hoarding hoarding life saving medicines or creating panic. \nPriyanka Vadra was exposed by her own bootlicker. The problem is western Media actually supports that same cohort of politicians who are creating panic, spreading despair or harming interests of patients. One Nut samrat Khujliwal has done enough drama in last few days to fetch him a lifetime Oscar.\n\nIf world wants to see how bad the situation is, look at Indian stock marke. If it’s not closed or scrapping bottom and actually is at a pretty high number, it means there are millions of common Indians who are optimistic living those oft said phrases \nThis too shall pass\nIt’s always darkest before the dawn. \n\nEven better, if you want to see how Indians are handling the crisis. See number of people sharing meaningless videos on Facebook as they aren’t disillusioned with life, sharing daily Good morning messages on WhatsApp to even people they haven’t met ever in life. \nOn a funny note, don’t be surprised if we have a baby boom in latter half of 2021 in India because many have decided that “what better time than a forced winding down to extend their family” \nThese women in the image by Steve McCurry represent India who are closing ranks in a dust storm in a land ravaged by 13 years of no rainfall in their full traditional and beautiful attire ready to dance when the storm abates because they know tough times don’t last forever and you still have option to fight the bad days with a smile, a hope and a song. \n\nThey represent India who are resilient, optimistic and know we are in tough situation but in no way broken or burning as a nation.'<br />Author: 'braceem'  id: 'n078lq'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n078lq/misrepresentation_by_foreign_media/</li>

Earlier, the main protesting states were Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, but the latter 2 dipped after what happened on Republic Day as well as after the 11 rounds of discussion and started supporting the government. Even there is a bulk of farmers in Punjab who support the bills. The main people at protest are Arthiyas and high status Jatt farmers, plus whoever is swindled by foreign \\*Khalistan\\* payrolls. Besides them, all the farm boards in the other states support the bills due to exactly the promise of free market choice so that the farmers can choose who they want to sell it to instead of being restricted to their local mandi. BKU and other protesting boards do not encompass the majority of the farmers either. I keep hearing about a delay/repeal in Punjab only, and I think that could be a neutral solution because they are the ones now making all the hallabol over this. We can see how well the other states develop vs. Punjab to see the result of the bills.

India did have the capacity but they didn't do it. The centre dragged it's legs and hence they couldn't detect the new variant untill it was too late. Sufficient funding was not provided on time and they did not plan it well.\n\nIn addition the ruling party allowed religious festivals and election rallies to take place. Even after everything the BJP continued to campaign in West Bengal in limited numbers i.e 500 people. Holi, Kumbh Mela, Elections. Admittedly the people did not follow COVID appropriate behaviour but when has the public ever followed rules in our country?\n\nAlso recently you see that 500+ PSA oxygen plants are going to be setup by the government, in addiction to the ones already in the pipeline (150+). Oxygen shortage is due to logistics. There are not enough tankers, cylinders etc. to transport oxygen. These PSA plants are not expensive and can be setup in 4-6 weeks. They can support one hospital. The point is that setting up these plants before hand would have reduced the round trip time for the oxygen tankers.\n\nThe vaccination issue now. Exports in my opinion could not be stopped as that's how SII got its license. But now the centre has asked the states to procure the vaccines on it's own even when the centre has set aside 35000 crores in the budget to do the same. Why couldn't the centre buy it and give it to the states at a lower price. Can the smaller, less rich states support their needs on their own now?\n\nAlmost all states in our country are not counting the deaths properly but UP is doing an extremely bad job of it.\n\nSo in conclusion who do you guys think is responsible for the mess in our country at the moment?"<br />Author: 'Avante7Grande'  id: 'mzstpl'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mzstpl/who_do_you_guys_blame_for_the_current_crisis/</li>

It\'s a lever India could use as a bargaining chip to get US to lift curbs on supplies to Indian vaccine makers from the country.\n\nMumbai headquartered pharma and nutraceutical specialty ingredient maker VAV Lifesciences and its subsidiary VAV Lipids, through a deal with a US-based multinational contract development and manufacturing organisation (CDMO), is going to supply highly purified \'synthetic phospholipids\' required for vaccine manufacturing. The CDMO is using lipids made by VAV to produce gene-based lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for exclusive use in the COVID-19 vaccines of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.\n\n"LNP technology is considered a medical breakthrough in vaccine-based delivery systems. It has enabled the development of mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines at a blistering pace. We are proud to be the first and only Indian company to produce high-quality phospholipids that have been approved for use in these novel vaccine delivery systems," said Arun Kedia, Managing Director, VAV Lifesciences.\n\nThere are only 3-4 manufacturers of this in the world, and VAV Lifesciences is the only manufacturer in India. These LNPs effectively deliver the mRNA to the target cellular sites and help bind these to the relevant cells. Since mRNA is extremely sensitive to degradation and rapid breakdowns, LNPs ensure the protection of the mRNA until its uptake in cells. This results in a better cellular response and efficacy against virus replication, significantly enhancing the overall immunogenic response of vaccines, said sources.\n\nVAV has already initiated commercial supply of phospholipids for large-scale vaccine manufacturing through its subsidiary VAV Lipids. About 80% of the order quantity already has been either delivered or is in the supply process and new orders are already under discussion. VAV will manufacture all its synthetic phospholipids at its EU current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) certified facility at Ratnagiri in Maharashtra. The volume of lipids utilised in vaccine delivery is very small and are measured in micrograms. Each order volume is about 250 kg and is roughly valued at Rs 50 lakh (approximately USD 67,000), said sources.'<br />Author: 'abhimangal'  id: 'mz04ew'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mz04ew/us_restricts_vaccine_raw_materials_to_india_but/</li>

The country is currently vaccinating about 3 million people a day, which is around 100 million people a month.\n* However, given the government has given approval for the usage of foreign vaccines such as Sputnik, Pfizer, Moderna etc. and Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India are expanding their production capacity, it will be reasonable to estimate that India might be able to vaccinate 30 - 35 % of its population and bring the current Corona virus wave under some control in two to three months time.\n* It has to be mentioned over here that this assumption that that Corona virus pandemic may be contained after vaccination first dose to 30 - 35 % of population is a very crude inference drawn from the results seen in the vaccination program of US, UK, Israel, and this is not a scientific study. \n\nFor anyone interested I have discussed this in slightly more detail in the following Youtube posts:\n\n* In English :  [Outlook on containment of Coronavirus wave in India](https://youtu.be/TJnUbTyg65s)\n* In Hindi :  [कोरोना वायरस की मौजूदा लहर के नियंत्रण पर कुछ विचार](https://youtu.be/IwWsJmO5ddo)'<br />Author: 'yuganshs'  id: 'myu2wc'<br />Score:35<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/myu2wc/if_we_consider_us_uk_and_israel_as_example_india/</li>

Do not leave any option out. \n\nI am only sharing what worked for me and can work for you and can potential save a lot of damage if not fully cure you. \n\nThis is what you have to do -\n\nAll you need to do is make Haldi / Turmeric paste (roughly five parts Haldi and three part water) and apply on your throat and entire chest cavity and back (as anything applied on skin permeates it). This will result in constant administration of turmeric (which is one of the few anti virus agents known to man) and it seems to help kill the virus as suggested by fever going away after 1 hour of applying the paste. So in 1 hour you should see fever going away and temperature returning back to normal. \n\nWhile you rest, you can have hot water (not just warm, but hot, like tea / coffee) sip by sip as it induces heat into your throat which also kills the virus. You can sprinkle little Haldi in the the water too. You will see immediate improvement (within 5-10 minutes) as you\'ll start sipping hot water - this immediate improvement will also give you confidence in this "treatment". Though the symptoms will return as soon as you stop sipping it. So repeat this hot water intake after five minutes break once you empty a glass. Continue this for one hour and you will recover even faster. \n\nLeave the Haldi on you0r body even after 1 hour when the fever goes away. And wash it off after 4-5 hours and apply again. \n\nApply it every days for two three hours for one week until all symptoms go away. \n\nIf it works for you or helps others to a substantial degree, please comment and share this cure so others can also build conviction and try it out for themselves.'<br />Author: 'Jobhi'  id: 'mysjwe'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mysjwe/this_helped_me_to_fight_the_virus_and_has_helped/</li>

Forgetting the fact that this surge is caused by Maharashtra/Delhi/Kerala state government’s incompetence and corruption.\n\nThe same vultures who don’t credit modi for handling first wave of coronavirus better are so adamant that same modi is responsible for this second wave. This is part of 5 lakh social media “warriors” recruited by anti Indian forces like congress and kejruddin.\n\nIndia is now handling this crisis better with oxygen mobilization. In coming days we will understand what’s the trigger for this second wave and understanding reasons behind it. \n\nIgnore the Indian &amp; western liberal death porn coverage. As an individual make sure you and your family &amp; friends wear masks and don’t go outside unless necessary. \n\nWe have positive trend emerging with frequent mobilization of medical supplies and oxygen. \n\nMera Bharath Mahan.

      <li>Title::: '[Narendra Modi] Oxygen plants in every district to ensure adequate oxygen availability. An important decision that will boost oxygen availability to hospitals and help people across the nation.'<br />Body: '551 PSA Oxygen Generation Plants to be set up in public health facilities across the country through PM CARES\n\nOxygen Generation Plants to be set in Government hospitals in district head-quarters across the country\n\nThese plants are to be made functional as soon as possible: PM\n\nThese oxygen plants will ensure uninterrupted supply of oxygen in hospitals at district head-quarters\nPosted On: 25 APR 2021 12:16PM by PIB Delhi\nIn line with Prime Minister’s direction of boosting availability of oxygen to hospitals, the PM CARES Fund has given in-principle approval for allocation of funds for installation of 551 dedicated Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) Medical Oxygen Generation Plants inside public health facilities in the country. PM has directed that these plants should be made functional as soon as possible. He said that these plants will serve as a major boost to oxygen availability at the district level.\n\nThese dedicated plants will be established in identified Government hospitals in district headquarters in various States/UTs. The procurement will be done through Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.\n\nThe PM CARES Fund had earlier this year allocated Rs.201.58 crores for installation of additional 162 dedicated Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) Medical Oxygen Generation Plants inside public health facilities in the country\n\nThe basic aim behind establishing PSA Oxygen Generation Plants at Government hospitals in the district headquarters is to further strengthen the public health system and ensure that each of these hospitals has a captive oxygen generation facility. Such an in-house captive oxygen generation facility would address the day to day medical oxygen needs of these hospitals and the district. In addition, the liquid medical oxygen (LMO) would serve as a “top up” to the captive oxygen generation. Such a system will go a long way in ensuring that Government hospitals in the districts do not face sudden disruption of oxygen supplies and have access to adequate uninterrupted oxygen supply to manage the COVID-19 patients and other patients needing such support.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1386239404646100992'<br />Author: 'littichoka'  id: 'mymtym'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mymtym/narendra_modi_oxygen_plants_in_every_district_to/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Understanding the second wave better failure of administration'<br />Body: "TLDR: The reasoning behind the blame game and a large number of cases is not Covid but the failure of institutions. This post tries to understand why did we fail massively. It also argues the failure is not limited to Covid but our whole society or the sense of government as a whole. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**This is a work in progress, i have a lot more to write. People told me to post it as a post**\n\nEvery single one from the center, state, babus, oppositions, and the general public is responsible. I think the problem is not Covid but the systems we have built for solving problems like this. Covid is an accelerant or catalyst of the sort which shows how our institutions have failed. Both the LW and RW in India have been focused on the blame game cause that is how the system is designed. It penalizes good work or sometimes even encourages duplicitous work.\n\nI think this highlights the most important flaw in our systems. We can go examine the flaws:\n\nFailure of Babus:\n\n* The way the UPSC is structured or broadly the IAS structured was designed to propagate the raj and keep its British overlords rich. Just like the imperial overloads, the IAS babus can't be fired even if they are directly responsible for the stupid mess they have created. In fact, the job security is so well that many people spend 5-6 years of their life on the exams. This combined with promotions of seniority means that you don't promote on merit. This translates to babus unwilling to take risk as the payoff risk matrix gets broken. In a properly functioning system, the good risk is rewarded and bad actions are punished. This system guarantees security so the reward to take risk becomes zero. Babus, therefore, doesn't wanna be the one holding shit when the music (progress) stops. This means they **don't wanna take responsibility or actions**.\n* The Babus are also selected by tests that are specialized for g**eneralists rather than specialists.** The exams check for knowledge of Natyasasthra to Sufi poetry. You can argue these topics are important but the practical implications are minuscule at best. This means that the staff at the top levels are not specifically trained for the job they are gonna be doing.\n* How do you solve problems according to these babus? **Add more bureaucracy.** Do more paperwork? I was seeing reports of people need to fill an endless amount of forms to do the simplest of features. This freedom is stupid in peacetime but it is worse during the time now. It took Piyush Goyal and the PMO to waive custom checks and import duties for medicines a while, we just got it now. The worst is it only benefits them it gives them more opportunities for rent-seeking.\n\nNature of the Indian State:\n\n* One of the biggest challenges we have compared to other countries is part of the constitution and parts of the government. We have got major problems in the way the GOI has been established. The systematic infiltration of babuism has given us a **weak but all-pervasive state rather than a strong and limited one**. The govt also enjoys and encourages encroachment of all rights of private business and independent thinkers. All the parties have slowly added to this very few have fixed this. Although this problem is not just the GOI but the predecessors. This means that the state is not focused on a small group of actions but a large amount of nothing. This eventually leads to weird sorts of authoritarianism.\n* The clearest way we can see this stupidity is state lists and central lists; the way the states and unions have handled the delegations of duties. **Health is a state subject** that would mean states would be responsible for the actions central authorities are oversight or extra help bodies. This crisis shows how delegated through the states leads to huge differences in outcomes and mismanagement of resources. States like MH, DL which are fairly rich states can't even estimate the demand they are gonna get. The resources which states have to combat crisis like these are stupid. Problems like these are not simple problems that you can give to states or the center. It takes a lot of coordination between states, centers, districts, and tehsils.\n* **Cities municipal corporations.** The second wave has shown how fucking idiotic the mayors of cities and state governments are. Right now covid has fucked up DL, BOM and CCU. I didn't have a clue what the mayors of these cities are doing. In other countries, for large cities, the mayor is better known than the state's head. Xi became famous for the work he did in Shanghai. Can we tell the same for us Indians? The delegations of duties don't make sense. The growth of cities is made these problems worse.\n* **Urban Poor Programs.** We all have heard of MNERGA and all the grammen yojanas but one thing we have missed from creating opportunities for the urban poor. If you go to cities like Kolkata and Mumbai the utter failure of government in the slums is astounding. Slums and the corresponding model is the definition of **dis-franchisement**.  Slums although get the benefits of the city but due to densities don't get the quality of governance. The number of schemes based on interactions is pretty small. A lack of representation in Mayor elections, shoddy politics, and basically redlining among communities brings a hotbed of problems. We need broad-scale urban poor programs.\n\n*I have more ideas but these are sorta related to Covid and helping to exacerbate the crisis*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCentral Government:\n\n* **Lack of communication**: One field I think the Modi govt has failed the most is communication. The government has been complacent. The complacency clearly shows in the communication. During the polio campaign, all celebrities have shown support. The government isn't leveraging its communication channels effectively. For an idea to communicate, we need to have different channels for different people. A white paper for the people who are the most interested. A 1hours reading, 30 minutes, 15 minutes, 5 minutes, 1 minute, 1 para, and 1 line methods of communication. The government has communication with these channels has been weak. Decisions are not being made through first principles thinking but just building upon past actions.\n* **Lack of consideration second-order and third-order effects.** The government's policy when it comes to solving challenges has been the hammer approach. The government basically forgets to think about second-order and third-order effects. We can see this in the actions for handling the covid wave. By opening up the economy but not the vaccinations completely we have seen the shit show of the second wave. Policy actions don't happen in a vacuum, you have to think holistically.\n* **Failure of quantization of Risk and Reward ratios**\n* **Congressional budget offices equivalent**. One of the large problems related to the central government is the lack of a congressional budget office  (CBO ) equivalent.\n* Preparing and seeing examples in other countries\\*\\*\n* PMO delegations and Cabinet oversaturation\\*\\*\n* Handling of foreign media and press \\*\\*\n* Decisions in information asymmetric cases \\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nState Government:\n\n* Hand holding for tasks \\*\\*\n* Tallent allocations \\*\\*\n* Policy frameworks \\*\\*\n* Financial Allocations \\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPolitical Parties:\n\n* Theatrical Governance \\*\\*\n* Gundagiri (TMC)\\*\\*\n* Elections \\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJudiciary:\n\n* Judicial Activism \\*\\*\n* PIL \\*\\*\n* Pervasiveness \\*\\*\n* Milords \\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMedia:\n\n* TRP whoring\\*\\*\n* Misinformation\\*\\*\n* Exciting each others' bases\\*\\*\n* Foreign involvement \\*\\*\n* Lack of expert knowledge\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople:\n\n* Vaccine hesitancy\\*\\*\n* Misinformation\\*\\*\n* Panic \\*\\*\n* Letting down of guard \\*\\*\n* Elitism among some\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDiscourse/ Education:\n\n* Lack of foundational skills in math, statistics, and science. exponential distributions \\*\\*\n* 19th-century syllabus \\*\\*\n* Overemphasis on certain subjects \\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLW/RW Dichotomy:\n\n* Destruction of the true left in India\\*\n* Ecosystem\\*\n* Remnants of the previous systems\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\* I have a project due tonight for school, will add more points to this when I am free.

May be I should have taken pics - but they look like regular idly.\n\nAnyway, I found out how they are made. Quite simple actually soak urad dal, horse gram (cleaned well), broken rice in proportions 2:2:1 . And soak idly rawa (equivalent to rice portion ) separately.

Make Coconut chutney with lots of groundnuts in it and some Tamarind too. I promise you'll love it. In my mind's eye, because the taste is quite nutty I don't think sambar will go well with it.\n\nTomorrow we'll be out on road but the day after I am going to try it."<br />Author: 'ennis-jahsiah'  id: 'my7b4h'<br />Score:27<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/my7b4h/today_morning_i_had_the_best_idly_of_my_life_and/</li>

Everywhere I see people asking for better conditions for doctors but nurses are much more exposed to the covid positive patients than the doctors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Nurses\n\nNurses are the professionals who are there in the wards throughout the day. A doctor comes for round, does it and is off. It\'s the nurses who are there day in and out risking themselves and their families. They have elderly at their home also. \n\nIt was when proper nursing was provided, that the deaths reduced to a tenth during the [Crimean war.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale#Crimean_War) So, please nurses are important. And they are being neglected. They are neglected when you go to a hospital and demand to talk to a doctor when nurses are perfectly capable of doing the same thing. A nurse is much better at bloodwork than a doctor. \n\nThey deserve pay where they can support at least themselves if not their family. The pay is pathetic. Their regular pay is what some of you would spend on a dinner for one night. This is a very sad situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Physiotherapists\n\nApart from nurses, Physiotherapists are also working in dire conditions. It\'s the students, interns and residents that have to take the brunt of covid duty when senior professionals don\'t help. COvid is a new disease and we need guidance on how should we do things, after all, people doing duty are juniors. \n\nThese people are threatened that their completion certificates won\'t be given, their licensing will be blocked if they don\'t do covid duty. No one is refusing to do covid duty, but there has to be some recognition beyond occasional "Corona Warriors" posts on Social Media. \n\nDo you know [Nehal Rathwa](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/physio-intern-aged-22-dies-of-covid-students-fume/articleshow/82221236.cms) died in Vadodara?

But she was told that she has to pay for the hotel quarantine. [Interview with SSG intern CR](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CODeqjTgTmz/?igshid=1ozeigfxrzxhb). This is pathetic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou posting "Corona Warrior" on your Facebook isn\'t helpful. You asking questions about why these professionals are thrown into such conditions is. If you are going to post something, ask what are the pay and benefits, what are the measures by which professionals can be kept safe. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand that I have missed out on a lot of professionals.

For over a fortnight now, Shaikh has hardly got more than two hours of sleep, his time awake spent coordinating medical equipment for [Covid-19](https://indianexpress.com/about/coronavirus/) patients. Sometimes he rushes out at midnight to fix an oxygen cylinder for a patient. Shaikh says he goes home just once every day — for sehri, since it’s Ramzan month.\n\n“For the last two days, I have been getting more space to sleep here. My entire stock is rented or sold. I am hardly getting oxygen supply, and the phone doesn’t stop ringing. There is always someone crying for oxygen on the other side,” he says.\n\nThe second wave of Covid-19 has exposed glaring gaps in the country’s health infrastructure and the government’s preparedness in dealing with a crisis that came with enough warning signs. Nowhere is that vacuum more evident than in hospitals across Delhi, Mumbai and other urban centres [**where people have been struggling for something as basic as medical oxygen.**](https://indianexpress.com/photos/india-news/covid-second-wave-delhi-oxygen-shortage-7287455/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatients under home isolation have been unable to get cylinders, and the cost of refilling a cylinder or renting an oxygen concentrator has, in the absence of any regulation, sky-rocketed.\n\nOn April 9, in Mumbai’s suburb Kandivali, when Vinod Naik complained of breathlessness, his family tried to find him a hospital bed, but failed. A doctor advised them to get an oxygen cylinder at home. The hunt led to a supplier, who was ready to rent out an oxygen concentrator for Rs 10,000, double the market price. The Naiks did not think twice. The elderly patient was saved.\n\nBut 10 km away, in a Dahisar slum, Ramnath Tupseinder’s story ended differently. The same night, the 60-year-old’s oxygen saturation dipped to 89. His son rushed to two government-run Covid centres, but found no bed. “He had no money to afford a concentrator or a cylinder,” says Sandhya Fernandes, a social worker who says she rang all hospitals to find Tupseinder a bed. So they used the limited oxygen left in a cardiac ambulance to sustain him. Two hours later, Tupseinder died, gasping for breath.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Gujarat’s Palanpur, five patients died in a private hospital after oxygen dried up on April 21. Up north in Uttar Pradesh, five patients died in a private Aligarh hospital before fresh oxygen could be supplied.\n\nSince the second wave began in early February, India has recorded close to 35,000 Covid deaths**, but the country hasn’t kept a record of Covid deaths due to oxygen shortage.**\n\nOfficially, India’s daily oxygen production capacity is 7,127 MT and its medical oxygen requirement has increased by 76 per cent in 10 days — from 3,842 MT on April 12 to 6,785 MT on April 22. On paper, that leaves the country with a few hundred metric tonnes still to spare, but state after state has been complaining of acute shortage.\n\nUntil 2019, before the [pandemic](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/pandemic-explained-who-novel-coronavirus-covid19-what-is-a-pandemic-6309727/) hit the country, India required just 750-800 MT liquid medical oxygen (LMO), the rest was for industrial use. Since April 18 this year, industrial supply has been completely disrupted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The supply chain**\n\nAmong India’s big oxygen manufacturers are Inox Air Products, Linde India, Goyal M G Gases, National Oxygen Ltd and Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation.\n\nAn Inox official claims the company meets around 60 per cent of the country’s LMO demand, manufacturing 2,000 MT per day and supplying to 800 hospitals. The company has 550 transport tankers and 600 drivers, who, the official says, have been on the road 24×7.\n\nLMO is manufactured in large plants using cryogenic distillation techniques to compress atmospheric air, feed it into distillation columns and get liquid oxygen. It has 99.5 per cent purity. This process, an industry expert said, can take two-and-a-half days for lakhs of litres.\n\nThe liquid oxygen is filled into jumbo tankers for storage, from where special cryogenic tankers, that maintain temperatures of -180 degrees Celsius, travel hundreds of kilometres to smaller distributors in the hinterland.\n\nAmong India’s big oxygen manufacturers are Inox Air Products, Linde India, Goyal M G Gases, National Oxygen Ltd and Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation. (Express Photo by Vishal Srivastava)\n\nThe distributors convert liquid oxygen into gaseous form, compress it, feed it into cylinders and transport them to their final destination: hospitals. Some stock is sold to local vendors, who supply to home patients. Officials say that with longer distances to cover, end-to-end transport takes anywhere between five and 10 hours.\n\nGovernment data show India has 1,172 oxygen cryogenic tankers for road transport. The tankers served the purpose well until before the pandemic, but now they are scarce and take painfully long to cover hundreds of kilometres.\n\nIndia is converting tankers for nitrogen and argon into oxygen-carrying vehicles. It’s also importing tankers, manufacturing new ones, and using the Air Force to airlift empty ones to speed up one-way travel.\n\nTo speed up oxygen delivery, trains have also been pressed into service to ferry tankers. On April 23, the first rake from [Visakhapatnam](https://indianexpress.com/elections/visakhapatnam-lok-sabha-election-results/) travelled with 105 MT LMO to Nagpur, offloaded three tankers, and sped to Nashik to supply four tankers on Saturday.\n\nWith several states reaching full utilisation of their oxygen production capacity, they have been relying on the Centre to divert oxygen from states that have surplus. This week, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Gujarat complained of less allocation than their daily requirement. Karnataka, Rajasthan, Maharashtra are scraping the bottom of their oxygen barrels.\n\nAs Saket Tiku, president of the All India Industrial Gases Manufacturers’ Association (AIIGMA), puts it, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# “Production is just one problem. Transporting oxygen over long distances, especially to rural and remote parts, is the bigger problem.”\n\n# Then, there is another, seemingly intractable problem — the black market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hoarding and price rise**\n\nLocal vendor Shaikh says several families, especially those with the elderly and others at risk to Covid, have been panic hoarding oxygen concentrators and cylinders, leading to shortage and price rise.\n\n# A small 100-litre cylinder now costs Rs 8,000 and above, up from Rs 4,500-5,000, and its refilling cost has risen from Rs 150-250 to Rs 500-800 in Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and other cities. In Tier-II and Tier-III cities, refilling costs range from Rs 400 to Rs 600.\n\n# A 5-litre oxygen concentrator, which until two months ago cost Rs 45,000-50,000, now costs Rs 80,000-90,000, its monthly rent up from Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000-20,000.\n\n# “Once a customer takes a concentrator on a monthly rent, he wants to keep it for the entire month even if they don’t need it any more. I call up customers every day to convince them to return the cylinder for another patient. Some agree, some don’t. Batao, main kya karoon… yahan log mar rahe hain (Tell me, what do I do? People are dying here),” Shaikh says.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Exploring other avenues**\n\nIndia is tapping into all resources. With supply to industries cut since April 18, oxygen produced in iron and steel plants being diverted for medical use, and industrial oxygen manufacturers being encouraged to produce medical oxygen. With these measures, the government claims to have increased LMO capacity by 3,300 MT.\n\nThe Health Ministry has also sanctioned the installation of 162 Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants to directly use atmospheric air and separate it under pressure to filter out nitrogen. The oxygen that remains — 92-95 per cent pure — is compressed and fed into oxygen pipelines. The government plans to install 59 of these by April end in hospitals across 17 states and Union Territories, but together, they will only provide 154.19 MT oxygen.\n\n# 📷 India has 24.28 lakh active Covid-19 cases, of whom only 20 per cent have some symptoms and only 5-10 per cent end up needing oxygen.\n\n# In Maharashtra, the government has even tapped four thermal power plants. Since these plants can supply oxygen but do not have a bottling unit to fill oxygen in cylinders, there are plans to set up 500-bed hospitals near these plants and lay a direct oxygen line to all beds. “We have reached a point of desperation and all solutions are being worked out,” says Dr Sudhakar Shinde, IRS officer who is part of Maharashtra’s committee to manage oxygen and Remdesivir shortage.\n\n# All eyes are now on the 50,000 MT of oxygen that India is expected to receive through the import route. “We are evaluating and soon will do an allotment. In normal circumstances, it takes three weeks to despatch the oxygen,” Health Secretary Bhushan said.\n\n# Doctors rise up to challenge\n\nAmid the surging numbers, the National Clinical Covid-19 Registry has identified a key data point: 54.5 per cent, or more than one out of two people admitted in hospitals, need oxygen support during treatment this time. This is a 13.4 percentage point increase from last year’s peak during September and November, according to data from 40 centres across the country. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# India has 24.28 lakh active Covid-19 cases, of whom only 20 per cent have some symptoms and only 5-10 per cent end up needing oxygen. Yet, as numbers surge, the 5-10 percentage have translated into a huge number of patients needing oxygen beds.\n\n# Mumbai-based intensivist Dr Gunjan Chanchalani, who has been treating Covid-19 patients at their home, says not every senior citizen needs oxygen or hospitalisation. “Only if the fever persists for five days or more and oxygen keeps falling below 94 do we consider hospital admission,” she says. Most are easily treated at home, she says, adding that she recommends the prone position (lying on the stomach) as first aid for those with oxygen saturation levels between 92-96.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**On the role of oxygen therapy**\n\nDr Chanchalani explains, “Atmospheric air has 21 per cent oxygen. Inflamed lungs are able to filter very little quantity of oxygen. If we give 4-5 litres per minute oxygen therapy to someone with 85-90 saturation, the oxygen saturation improves by 26-28 per cent. If we increase oxygen supply to 15 litres, saturation rises to 90 per cent. Direct supply of pure oxygen puts less pressure on the alveoli, but overdose can scar lung tissues.”\n\n# Nursing homes and hospitals, falling short of oxygen, are also triaging. “We now admit people with oxygen saturation below 85-90 instead of 94, and try to advise prone position at home for those with 90-95 saturation. There aren’t enough oxygen beds,” a government doctor says.'<br />Author: 'itisverynice'  id: 'my2oqc'<br />Score:30<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/my2oqc/the_oxygen_chain_why_india_is_falling_short_of/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'TIL: How does peer review work?'<br />Body: 'I read a lot of comments on this sub recently about Bharat Biotech\'s Covaxin going through peer review, the impatience for those results, and the need for them before approval for use. I have my opinions on those comments but I won\'t go into that. In this neutral post, I wanted to explain what is peer review (and what it is *not*), how it works, and how it is evolving. Hopefully for those not familiar with scientific publishing (which, I assume is the vast majority) this will be useful. My post is based on my experience of publishing dozens of peer-reviewed scientific publications and reviewing probably close to 100 or more.\n\n# What is scientific communication?\n\nWhen we think about science, we imagine scientists working in some dark lab in white coats, totally cut off from the "real" world. This is mostly untrue, although there is some truth especially in the early career years. Science is ultimately about people - professors, students, project staff, funding agencies... and journals. Like any activity that involves many people, communication plays a key role. Science is not only about conducting experiments, it is about publishing the results and conclusions so that the wider scientific community can read it, judge it, and use it. Let me repeat that: as an end-user, you will not just read the science, but apply your own mind to judge it, and then make use of it for your own work (such as replicating some method or even to just spread awareness). More on this point later.\n\nHow does one communicate results? Well, you could always just print it and put it on the noticeboard in your college or post it on social media, but then it will barely be read by anyone. No, you don\'t just want to communicate, but communicate *widely*. That\'s where journals come in: you can think of them as magazines published at some fixed frequency (monthly, annually, weekly, etc.). These journals publish scientific research in the form of papers from around the world, and then are read by others around the world (there are different funding mechanisms for these, I won\'t go into that here). There are thousands of scientific journals in just about every field imaginable: *Nature* and *Science* are of course very famous, but there is *The Lancet* in medicine, IEEE journals in electronics engineering, *International Journal of Thermofluids* for mechanical engineers, *Journal of Structural Engineering* for civil engineers, *Journal of Anthropological Research* for anthropologists, etc. And like everything in life, there are good journals, bad journals, and fake journals (but again, that\'s for a different post). I am only going to talk about good and reputed journals here.\n\nSo then you, as a scientist, have research, and there are journals that will publish your research. Done? Not quite. You see, good journals want to publish *good* research, not *any* research. What is "good" research? It depends on who you ask: some would say that it is research that has immediate industrial applications, others would say that it is research that is suitably novel and path-breaking, and yet others would take the simpler path of saying that good research is that which just seems reasonable in terms of methods, results, and conclusions. Every journal has its own metric for good research, there is no universal definition. However, the real challenge is to judge whether a submitted paper is good or not. Top journals receive tens of thousands of papers every year, how can they judge which is worth publishing? That\'s where peer review comes in.\n\n# The peer review process\n\nWho is a "peer"? The dictionary definition is "one that is of equal standing with another," but in science, it basically means other scientists working in a similar (but not necessarily *same*) field. A peer review is therefore a process by which a paper is reviewed by a reviewer who is a peer, *before publication*. Peer review is at the heart of scientific publication, because it is assumed that only a peer can judge whether a paper is scientifically sound and "good" (however the journal defines good). \n\nHere\'s how the process works, in general (note that this is for the post-Internet age, it used to be a little different and more prolonged when things were done by post):\n\n1. A researcher (author of the paper) submits a paper to a journal, outlining their work, methodology followed, results and conclusions. First, the editor of the journal (usually a fellow scientist in the field) gives it a quick read to see if it is sensible, related to the journal, and would be of interest to the target audience for that journal. If it fails that test, it is rejected by the editor, usually called a *desk rejection*, before peer review. Rejected papers can always be submitted to other journals, and it is not uncommon to do so: **every researcher doing anything even remotely challenging will face many rejections in their career, it\'s fine**.\n2. If it passes the editor\'s preliminary check, they will invite several (typically 2-3 but it can be more, I\'ve had as many as 7) peers to review the paper. Sometimes the editor will know those peers from a database or personal connections, other times they will ask the author for suggested reviewers. Either way, it is hoped that a certain number of reviewers will accept to review the paper (they can freely decline to do so for any reason), will read it *thoroughly*, and provide feedback to the editor. Note that, typically, the author never knows who the reviewers are so that they can\'t influence them. However, sometimes the reviewers know who the author is (single-blind review) and sometimes they don\'t (double-blind review): it depends on the journal\'s policies.\n3. Once all reviewer reports are received, the editor will look at them and make a decision: reject if the reviewers felt the work was not sound, accept if it was sound, or ask for the authors to address some reviewer comments and resubmit their paper. If the last option is exercised, the authors are usually given a few weeks to address the comments (which could include conducting more experiments) and resubmit, after which another round of peer review with the same or different reviewer takes place. It\'s not unusual for a paper to undergo 2-3 rounds of peer review in this manner.\n4. Finally, at some point, one of two things can happen: the editor decides that the authors are unable to address the comments and rejects the paper, or decides that the paper is in good shape and accepts. It is then published and officially becomes a peer-reviewer study. Rejected papers may be submitted to a different journal, where the entire process will be repeated: this is not at all unusual and even very good papers have had to "hop" around journals. Peer review as a whole is subjective and subject to human error.\n\nThere are some important points to note here: peer review is usually a voluntary process in addition to the reviewer\'s actual day job as a scientist. This means it has to be done in their free time, which could be late at night on a Sunday after all other work is done. Reviewers are typically given deadlines but there is no punishment for missing them as it is totally voluntary. It is not unusual for editors to have to send several reminders to elicit a review. All this adds to the time taken for peer review, in addition to the time authors would take to revise the paper based on comments received. And this happens for every round of review, typically 2-3 rounds. For some high impact papers, editors can make a big effort and make phone calls to speed it up, but it is *very* rare. The usual time taken for the whole process (submission -&gt; initial review -&gt; 2-3 rounds of peer review -&gt; publication) is 3-12 months depending on the field. \n\n# What peer review is and isn\'t\n\nAssuming that the journal is good and the peer reviewers are professional, the basic purpose of peer review is to weed out: a) obviously bad work and b) suspicious work. As long as the research methodology is scientifically sound, the results are reasonable, and the conclusions are appropriately drawn from those results, a paper will pass peer review. However, this does *not* guarantee the following:\n\n1. That the work will be used widely and make a huge impact in the field. It may be possible to make a reasonable guess that it would, and indeed it is obvious in some cases, but most of the time, the true value of a paper will only be known decades later after a lot of people have read and used it. This is usually why the Nobel science prizes are given for work done decades ago (although 2020 was a very appropriate exception). \n2. That the work is reproducible i.e., if you follow the methodology in your own lab, you can get the same results. Ideally, this should be something that reviewers check, but it is practically impossible to do that in most fields as reviewers themselves have limited time and resources, and many experiments use such expensive equipment that only the author submitting the work can actually do it. Nonetheless, if the wider scientific community finds the paper to be useful, eventually someone will try to reproduce it but that will be long after peer review.\n\nI think the best description of peer review is that it is a gatekeeper aka chowkidar: it will keep the obviously bad stuff out, and maybe even the suspicious stuff. But it cannot guarantee that whatever gets through will be widely used, path-breaking, or even reproducible: that is for the wider community to decide over many years.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nComing back to Covaxin, COVID-19, and the issue of peer review. In light of the urgency of the pandemic, many journals have required that COVID-19 related papers be published as is *before peer review*, in the form of what is called a pre-print. This is to acknowledge not just that peer review is a slow process *not designed for emergency situations*, but also that most peer reviewers themselves would be busy in their work for the same emergency and hence the process could be slower than usual (recall that it is totally voluntary). \n\nThe idea of a pre-print is that *while the peer review process is ongoing*, the wider community can look at the results for themselves. Note that peer review is a process that the journal will handle with a small set of peer reviewers, but that doesn\'t mean that other peers (who are *not* involved in peer review for that particular journal/paper) are not looking at the pre-print. Pre-prints actually go through quite a lot of scrutiny themselves and receive a lot of comments from peers, they can be even more thorough than the formal peer review and obviously bad or suspiciously bad work will quickly be called out rather mercilessly. This is also a recent innovation that came in the post-Internet age, whereas peer review is much older.\n\nFor example, Bharat Biotech submitted its Phase II results for Covaxin in a pre-print server ([download here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.21.20248643v1)) while it was being reviewed by *The Lancet*. The pre-print was published on December 22, 2020 while the formal peer reviewed paper was published on March 8, 2021: there is quite a delay but it is totally expected as I had explained above. Yet, as you can see in the pre-print article metrics from the previous link, it was viewed and downloaded thousands of times while undergoing peer review, even as the peer review itself would\'ve been done by less than 5 reviewers. A similar process is being followed for Phase III results.\n\nSo, in summary, it is important to put peer review in context. A peer-reviewed journal paper (in a good journal of course) is the gold standard of scientific publishing and is absolutely essential to weed out bad or suspicious work. But it does not guarantee that the work will change the field, the world, or even be reproducible in the future. It takes many years and many more people for that to happen. Meanwhile, pre-prints are a relatively newer innovation that, though not as rigorous and formal as peer review, often lead to much wider and earlier scrutiny of work. Submitting pre-prints also implies a certain level of confidence: "I know my work is good enough to pass peer review, so I will give it out to everyone else too."\n\nHappy to answer non-personal questions in the comments!'<br />Author: 'ididacannonball'  id: 'mxulq3'<br />Score:37<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mxulq3/til_how_does_peer_review_work/</li>

While I read a lot in the international press and English Indian press about COVID, the prevailing attitude in large parts of India is one of total denial and carefree behavior. This is the key behavioral change from last year. When the nation went into lockdown in 2020 the people were by and large of a single mind, to protect themselves, but after a year of incident free living most people are shaped by their subjective experience.\n\nThose who had mild to no symptoms have begun to deny COVID and chafe at the restrictions. \n\nMost people lack the nuance of mind to deal with an uncertain world full of edge cases and exceptions. When the doom prophesized by science doesn\'t come knocking they decide the scientists are wrong and they know better.

      <li>Title::: 'How can India exit the COVID once and for all: brain storming'<br />Body: 'As bleak as things seem, there have been three things that give us great hope on how we might exit the COVID crisis, \n\n1. For countries reaching **even 50% vaccination** rate such as the UK and Israel, COVID infections and **deaths have simply plummeted**. \n2. Even in India, **chances of dying after vaccination are an incredibly low 0.0002%** \\- [https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2021/apr/18/chances-of-dying-from-covid-is-higher-than-succumbing-after-taking-vaccine-expert-2291412.html](https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2021/apr/18/chances-of-dying-from-covid-is-higher-than-succumbing-after-taking-vaccine-expert-2291412.html)\n3. Russia\'s Sputnik vaccine is displaying outstanding results of **98% effectiveness**, breaking the West\'s stranglehold on high impact vaccines - [https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/russia-sputnik-v-efficacy/](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/russia-sputnik-v-efficacy/) \n\nSo the answer in exiting this disaster clearly lies in a massive inoculation campaign. Now despite India\'s massive size, there is indeed a proven way to do this campaign at scale and speed. The answer lies in the template of how we conduct our general elections,\n\n1. Considering that we are at \\~8% vaccination and countries such as UK, Israel are reporting significant fall in infections within hitting 50% threshold - we need to **reach 50% more of our masses** \n2. Turnout in general elections is typically around 70% - hence a campaign **driven across party lines** is likely to easily get a similar number of people to come out and be a part of the drive \n3. The good news is that we can do this at pace - typically elections take just around 1 month to conduct. Considering that typical 2nd dose has to be given 3-4 weeks after the first does, we are practically talking about running "**two general elections**", back to back. \n4. Given that with the high infection rates that have been observed a lot of population may have some level of natural immunity. So effectively if we can execute a drive this way, we are talking about achieving herd immunity ie around 70-80% of the population **within a few months - we can wipe out COVID within this year**\n5. Such a drive, since it would be non-political can also involve public influencers - social, sports, religious, political - from a very wide cross section and can act as a catalyst for much needed **national unity**  \n\nNow the key questions are is this even possible operationally? The surprising answer to this question is yes, here is how,\n\n1. To inoculate 70% of adult population ie similar to number hit in last general elections, we require 600 Mn inoculations ie **1.2 Bn doses**\n2. Current production capacity of doses is projected to hit around 100 Mn per month by September. This is clearly not sufficient - we **need to hit capacity strength of 200 Mn within the next 3 months**. Can this happen - in my opinion yes. Now two things need to happen to enable this - \n   1.  Going by Mr Adar Poonawala\'s recent statements, I can hazard a guess that for ramping vaccine production by 50 Mn doses, we need an investment of around $500 Mn. Do we have the money for this? YES. Our forex reserves are close to $200 Bn. Even if **taking $2-3 Bn from forex reserves** this means we hit our exchange rate by a few rupees, we need to do this now. \n   2. We hear again and again that there are some raw material constraints being put by the US. How do we solve this? In my opinion, **Mr Modi needs to fly to Moscow right away** and meet Mr Putin with folded hands. Russia can, for a suitable price, offer us anything and everything we need to manufacture this vaccine in India. More importantly, this would be a chance for Russia to,\n      1. Reclaim the position they held as the former Soviet Union and be remembered as the country that led the world out of COVID. Because once India is done inoculating its people, the **capacity can be used to very quickly to save rest of the world**.\n      2. We are now at the beginning of a vaccine revolution. COVID vaccine hunt has made vaccine sciences leap by several decades. Just yesterday it was announced that a **vaccine that can wipe out malaria has been discovered**. The capacity we install now will be used throughout 2020s to wipe out a variety of diseases. This will help Russia diversify away to diversify their economy which is much needed at this point in time.\n      3. We should **forget about expecting any progress with US**. For a variety of reasons which Im not getting into, they are not allowing us to hit the vaccine capacity we require. We don\'t have any leverage on them - our dependency on them for many, many dimensions is just too high and we have no leverage - anything we do will only hurt us double.  \n      4. Operationally other things required - **manpower, equipment such as refrigeration, systems - we already have** by virtue of our election campaign structure as well as past vaccination drives on polio etc \n\nThis in my opinion is the moment of truth for Mr Modi and more than for him, it is the moment of reckoning for India. Our ability to turn this weakness to our strength will define our near to mid term future.'<br />Author: 'scenicLyf'  id: 'mxewa3'<br />Score:76<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mxewa3/how_can_india_exit_the_covid_once_and_for_all/</li>

I have. The conditions of people who are not rich is shabby. Do you even know the condition of WB because of immigrants from Bangladesh? WB is full of Muslim Bangladeshis and if this goes on the state would be another Bangladesh. The locals will have no say in their own state. There is no development in WB and locals who raise their voices are killed and looted. Since majority of people there are illiterates or have less education you cannot expect them to listen to Modi or Mamta via a digital platform. The messages of the parties could only be delivered through rallies and because the population of Bengal is huge, they never followed social distancing. I am sure you know how the current govt has stopped other parties including Center to interfere in WB's matters. Last year when Center wanted to check the situation of Covid there, they used every tactic possible so that no one could get the idea of the real situation there which was horrible. Families did not get to know that their family member had expired and their bodies went missing. There were a lot of noise on Twitter and social media. I always wondered how WB did not top the chart last year but when my bro went there we came to know the data was always fudged and the ground reality was very disturbing.\n\nI stay in Assam and in the state capital, Guwahati. If you follow news you must be aware we had elections simultaneously here too and massive rallies were held here too. The Covid situation here in Assam is far better compared to other states in India. Have Assam stopped people from going outside the state or have stopped people from coming here from another states? No. But we did not see a huge surge in cases like the rest of India. It is because BJP leaders here, especially Himanta Biswa Sarma has done a fantastic job in handling the pandemic last year and this year as well. I can see the state develop which was not the case when Congress ruled Assam for 15 years. We have the problem of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh here too which was a huge problem earlier but this is better now. China is another problem for people in North east.  I can see people's faith on the current govt and I am sure this govt is coming back for next 5 years.\n\nComing back to WB, doing election rallies there was the need of the hour which most people don't understand. If the current govt comes back there it would be a huge setback for WB and our country as well.. I am sure BJP and other parties knew the cases would rise but what choice did they really have?

Vaccines are 70-80-90% effective and the companies providing these vaccines would say we never said it is 100% effective, it was never 100% effective. There is no data of how many people are getting infected even after taking the vaccines. The data is also difficult to get because most people are treating themselves at home and they are either not tested or they themselves are not going for testing.   \n\nWhy are we are taking the vaccine? Because this is the only option for us to be safe as we are scared. Why are the companies giving these vaccines then? it is a business for them - darr ka vyapaar, as they say in PK = Jo darr gaya woh mandir gaya.. In our case jo darr gaya wo hospital gaya vaccine lene.."<br />Author: 'only_mann'  id: 'mx5b9y'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mx5b9y/how_effective_are_vaccines_in_india_have_you_or/</li>

And this was when there was no pandemic. I use to curse everyday on why we do not have a proper healthcare system. It is time that people of India demand a national health service similar to the one in the UK. The UK NHS has been a godsend in times such as this. It was under pressure(was expected); there were some doubts on whether it will cope. But it did fantastically well and saved lives. It is not magic that the UK came out of this crisis relatively well compared to most of the other countries. It is the NHS that did it. India needs a service like the NHS. We unfortunately have copied all the crap systems from the US: The healthcare, media and the education. We should instead be looking at some of the European countries as they have better human value system.\nI hope people do not forget the current chaos. In India people seem to have selective amnesia! We forget immediately and go back to the old ways. I hope people do not forget this.

      <li>Title::: 'Why we are seeing so many oxygen shortage stories?'<br />Body: "India is among the leading oxygen producers. In normal times, India is actually a medical oxygen-surplus country. Such a general situation explains why interstate transport of medical oxygen did not require regulations. Most oxygen manufactured in India is consumed by the industry.\n\nIn pre-Covid-19 times, India had a demand of 700 tonne per day (TPD) of liquid medical oxygen. During the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the demand for medical oxygen rose four times to 2,800 TPD.\n\nDuring the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, the demand shot up over 5,000 TPD of medical oxygen — seven times the pre-pandemic requirements. Such a spike in demand for medical oxygen is due to the volume of Covid-19 cases in the country.\n\nEven at this rate, India is producing more medical oxygen than the requirement in hospitals. India’s daily oxygen-producing capacity is 7,287 tonnes per day.\n\nWhat is bogging India down currently is the shortage of cylinders and tankers that can transport oxygen from production plant to hospitals. Some firms such as the Tata Group even announced that it would be importing cryogenic containers for the transport of medical oxygen.\n\nhttps://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/explained-can-states-block-oxygen-supply-why-surplus-producer-india-faces-crisis-1793815-2021-04-22\n\nEven among admitted patients, the percentage requiring oxygen are seemingly higher this time &amp; doctors can't explain why.\n\nOxygen Demand Higher in 2nd Wave Top medical experts in the government have said oxygen demand is higher in the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the first. According to data from hospitalised patients during the first and second wave, requirement of oxygen is higher in the second wave at 54.5 per cent as compared to the first wave at 41.1 per cent. On why oxygen requirement is higher this time, ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said, “It could be explained by the fact that there has been a sudden surge in COVID-19 cases, creating panic among people to get admitted to hospitals and therefore, the oxygen requirement suddenly shot up, which is one reason. But this is limited data from hospital settings and more will have to be looked at.”\n\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-in/news/other/explained-how-and-why-covid-19-has-led-to-clamour-for-oxygen-across-the-country/ar-BB1fTbhL\n\nWhat is being done so far?\n\nUnion Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, 'We are producing 7,500 metric tonnes of oxygen per day of which 6,600 metric tonnes is being allocated to the states for medical purposes. 'Presently, we have issued instructions that, leaving a few industries, the supply to industries will be restricted so that more and more oxygen can be made available for medical use,' he said. Why is government not waking up to reality?: Delhi HC on oxygen crisis Bhushan further said that a 24x7 control room has been set up where state governments can raise the problems bring faced by them like if their truck is stuck somewhere or the if movement is being hindered. 'When you deal with such a huge challenge, such a big pandemic and multiple stakeholders , then at times there is panic and confusion, and the onus and responsibility is on the Union and state governments to work together and respond promptly so these challenges are addressed,' Bhushan said. The officials said they are also evaluating applications from suppliers abroad for import of oxygen. In view of the increasing demand for medical oxygen, the Centre floated a tender for import of 50,000 MT of medical oxygen and a pre-bidding meeting was held on Tuesday, according to official sources. The Health Ministry has been directed to finalise the tender for the same and also explore possible sources for import identified by the missions of MEA. Besides, the Health Ministry on Sunday said that 162 Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants sanctioned by Government of India for installation in public health facilities in all states will augment oxygen capacity by 154.19 MT. Out of 162 PSA oxygen plants, 33 have been installed and 59 will be installed by the end of April, while by the end of May, 80 plants will be installed. In addition to the 162 plants already sanctioned, states have requested for more than 100 such additional plants which are also being sanctioned, the ministry had said in a tweet. 'The entire cost of 162 PSA oxygen plants amounting to Rs 201.58 crore has been borne by the central government.This also includes 7 year maintenance cost to start from 4th year onwards after three years of warranty,' the ministry had said in a series of tweets. Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants manufacture oxygen and help hospitals become self-sufficient in their requirement for medical oxygen while also reducing the burden on the national grid for supply of medical oxygen. The Centre on Sunday banned the supply of oxygen for industrial purposes except in nine specified industries in view of shortage of the essential public health commodity in several states amid a spike in COVID-19 infections.\n\nRead more at: https://www.oneindia.com/india/7500-mt-oxygen-being-produced-in-india-daily-6-600-mt-allocated-to-states-for-medical-use-govt-3248160.html"<br />Author: 'littichoka'  id: 'mwkwsz'<br />Score:34<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mwkwsz/why_we_are_seeing_so_many_oxygen_shortage_stories/</li>
