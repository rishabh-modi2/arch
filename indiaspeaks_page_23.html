      <li>Title::: 'My simple high level take on the India Budget today'<br />Body: "Today,  the Indian government presented the highly anticipated Union Budget and  here's my simple layman explanation of the budget. My post does not  intend to provide the key highlights or data points, which are anyways  easily available on most news websites. This is a take on the overall  direction of the budget for people not aware of complex terminology.\n\nWhile  there were usual budget allocations to different departments and  heavier spending on sectors like Infrastructure, Healthcare etc., the  key thing to look in today's budget was how will government fund all  this spending. There is something called 'fiscal deficit' which is the  difference between what government spends and earns in a year. In last  year's budget, this 'fiscal deficit' was around 3.5% and now it stands  at 9.5%. Because of the Covid crisis, government had to spend a lot  (unplanned spending or what we call emergency spending in personal  finance) on vaccines, healthcare, migrant workers and lot of other  activities. At the same time, government's earnings dropped because of  less taxes as businesses were shut and not making money. **So imagine a situation where your income drops and spending needs to increase.**\n\nThere were broadly 2 ways in which government could have filled in this gap:\n\n1. **Raise taxes to boost their earnings.**  This would have meant raising Income Taxes or other indirect taxes.  While this theoretically increases government's income, it reduces  people's ability to purchase things because of higher taxes. Hence, it  was assumed to be a conservative move.\n2. **Borrow from markets and sell existing assets.**  Now this is complicated so in very simple (and slightly inaccurate but  broadly correct) terms, it means asking RBI to print more money.  Government chose this path. Along with market borrowing, they plan to  monetize assets like privatizing public sector units, selling off their  land etc. Obviously, this boosts growth without hurting individuals.\n\nIndian  government has chosen the 2nd option and rightly so in my humble  opinion. That's why you can see the euphoric reaction in stock markets.  Obviously, the challenge lies in execution- whether the government can  efficiently sell their assets at good prices or whether their spending  will boost GDP growth an so on.\n\nI  am not any market expert but wanted to put out a simple take that helps  people understand India's budget as they would understand their own  financial situation.\n\nI appreciate  any comments, agreements or disagreements but without any political  tones. Whether you like the government or not should not be related to  how you assess the budget.\n\nLook forward to hearing other people's views on the budget."<br />Author: 'ThinkBetter6'  id: 'l9ypqw'<br />Score:65<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l9ypqw/my_simple_high_level_take_on_the_india_budget/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] EU fights poor vaccine rollout, abortion ban in Poland, and the maker of modern Singapore'<br />Body: 'Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Geopolitics Thread, the one place where we discuss all the latest events from around the world. Discussion does not have to be related to India. Please share and discuss stories, or ask any geopolitical questions that you have, in the comments. Here are a few stories to get the discussion started:\n\n# Breaking News\n\n[Military coup in Myanmar (again), Suu Kyi detained](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/world/myanmar-aung-san-suu-kyi-detained-intl/index.html)\n\nMyanmar\'s military announced that it had dismissed the country\'s civilian government on charges of "election fraud," detaining several political figures including the country\'s de facto civilian leader and Nobel Laureate Aung Sun Suu Kyi. In elections last year, her NLD party won 83% of seats, a stunning rebuke of the military-backed party. The military has ruled the country for over 50 years out of about 70 years of independence from Britain. Australia condemned the coup, while the US is also signaling a condemnation within a few hours. ASEAN, China, and India have not made any statements yet. \n\n# Top stories\n\n1. [EU in embarrassing stand-off with AstraZeneca](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/01/30/962454276/eu-reverses-move-to-restrict-export-of-covid-19-vaccines-to-northern-ireland)\n\nThe EU finds itself in a difficult situation with AstraZeneca (AZ) for its COVID-19 vaccine, as the bloc has had a poor rollout of the vaccine amidst widespread protests against continued lockdowns. AZ informed the EU that further vaccine shipments would be delayed as the company was upgrading its plant in Belgium to increase capacity. In response, the EU raided the plant to \'verify\' the claims, and then moved to ban exports of the vaccine to the UK and other countries. However, the ban ran counter to the Brexit agreement that ensured an open border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, and after strong protests from the UK and EU-member state Ireland, it was reversed. AZ has an independent production line in the UK, where the rollout has been smooth, and the ban would\'ve only had a cosmetic effect.\n\n2. [Widespread anti-Putin protests in Russia](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/europe/russia-navalny-protests-intl/index.html)\n\nAlexey Navalny, Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s most outspoken critic, set off a storm of protests across Russia after he was arrested upon his return from Germany, where he was recovering from an assassination attempt in Siberia. The protests saw over 5,000 people arrested, over 1,600 in Moscow alone, as Navalny alleged that Putin owned a secret mansion worth $1.3 billion, the money siphoned off from public contracts. This is a rare allegation to make in a country where criticizing Putin can lead to poisoning and death. Among those arrested was Navalny\'s wife, who has since been released.\n\n3. [Thousands emigrate from Hong Kong to Britain](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/thousands-flee-hong-kong-uk-fearing-china-crackdown-75586656)\n\nIn retaliation against Beijing\'s crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong, Britain allowed residents of the territory to apply for a British National (Overseas) or BN(O) visa, a step towards residency and citizenship of the UK. Already, thousands have applied and up to 300,000 may eventually flee - some of them to escape prosecution for participating in pro-democracy protests, and others to escape Beijing\'s crackdown on free speech and common law. Many fear that China would eventually introduce exit controls to stop the flee.\n\n4. [Poland imposes near-total ban on abortions](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/europe/poland-abortion-law-protests-intl/index.html)\n\nPoland, a conservative, Catholic Christian society, passed a court ruling effectively banning all abortions except in cases where the mother\'s life is at risk, or the child was a result of rape or incest. The move sparked off a wave of protests by women\'s right organizations. The court ruling came as a shot in the arm for the ruling PiS party, which made banning abortion one of its central promises. The protests also saw many LGBTQ+ flags, as those rights have also been eroded by the government in the last few years. All protests were in violation of COVID-19 orders.\n\n5. [Tech giants and Australia lock horns over new bill](https://www.reuters.com/article/australia-media-facebook/explainer-google-facebook-battle-australia-over-proposed-revenue-sharing-law-idUSL1N2K309P)\n\nThe Australian Parliament is discussing a new law that would force content aggregators, including Facebook and Google, to pay local media companies whose content is posted on their services. In addition, the law requires the tech giants to tell the content providers when they change their search algorithms, and how user data collected from their content is being used. The law includes civil penalties if tech companies defy the rules. The law faces stiff resistance from the tech giants, with Google threatening to withdraw its search engine from the country. However, it is supported by local media companies, including Rupert Murdoch\'s News Corporation. Lawmakers insist that the aim of the law is to increase competition in the online news market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The Tiger-makers\n\n*Starting this week, I\'ll be rolling out a new series about the leaders that created the economic miracle of the last century, the Asian Tigers: Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Feedback is welcome.*\n\nWorld War 2 led to the creation of over a hundred new states from the ashes of European empires: from Zimbabwe to Indonesia, a generation of people woke up to freedom - and to the crushing realization of being born into poverty. In British Malaya, individual states decided to come together to form a new federation - a multi-ethnic state that included a Malay majority (mostly Muslims), and Indian (mostly Hindus) and Chinese (mostly Buddhists) minorities in all provinces, except one: Singapore.\n\nIn the tiny collection of islands at the very tip of the Malay peninsula, ethnic Chinese held a majority and demanded equal treatment in a new federation, counter to Article 153 of the Malaysian Constitution that enabled so-called \'bhumiputra laws,\' which created an apartheid state that gave special privileges to the majority Malays. Riots broke out in 1964, and Singapore\'s leading parliamentarian Lee Kuan Yew (LKY) was castigated by pro-Malay parties in Parliament. In 1965, fearing further opposition to the bhumiputra laws, Malaysia expelled Singapore from the federation, leaving the poor island, devoid of any natural resources (not even any source of freshwater), staring into a bleak future.\n\nFor a few weeks, LKY was stunned but eventually, he swung into action as the PM of the new country. Recognizing the need to establish trade and defense links, Singapore helped create the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as a trade bloc, and received security backing from Malaysia\'s main rival, Indonesia, then ruled by dictator Sukarno. It is said that LKY vowed to turn Singapore from a poor backwater to an economic giant that would rival Calcutta, the most prosperous city in Asia at the time and former capital of British India. Singapore established compulsory national military service, and sought military cooperation with Nationalist China (Taiwan) and Israel to modernize its forces and hold off a Communist takeover supported by Communist China (PRC).\n\nOn the economic front, LKY understood that Singapore has no future without foreign investment. The country built infrastructure to attract major American and British companies to manufacture everything from steel to computers, including a high-quality harbour to enable import and export of goods. However, he was quickly stymied by labour unrest and corruption. In response, LKY instituted harsh punishments, even leading his National Development Minister to commit suicide in the face of a case for corruption. Singapore instituted near-medieval punishments such as public caning and rather liberal executions for crimes, virtually creating a police state where protests could land you in a lot of trouble. It introduced a \'two-child\' rule to control population growth (though not as harsh as China\'s One Child Policy), but eventually turned around when it was a roaring success and the country\'s population declined within a generation. Within the bureaucracy, Singapore established a strict system of meritocracy, where poor performance led to dismissal and bureaucrats had no inherent job protection.\n\nHis party tightly controlled the media, making it difficult for any opposition to win elections - LKY was PM from 1959 to 1990 in a de facto one-party state (the current PM is his son) that nonetheless held free and regular elections. Even after he stepped down, he stayed in the cabinet in various positions that were created just for him - Singapore has a messy system of group constituencies and ethnic representation (including MPs from candidates that lost their elections!), but they are all irrelevant as it is essentially one party that creates whatever it wants in the government structure. By the time LKY died in 2015, he had fulfilled his dream many times over - Singapore became one of Asia\'s most developed countries, far outstripping the Indian city that he had hoped to emulate, riding the wave of free trade while spending nearly 5% of GDP on defense to keep its maritime borders safe. While it ranks poorly on human rights, its people are one of the most prosperous in the world, and it is a haven for free markets and entrepreneurship.\n\nBut LKY\'s contribution did not remain within the borders of Singapore. Aside from his stewardship of ASEAN, he also influenced other countries looking to calibrate a mix of high economic freedom with low political freedom. One leader that he inspired and influenced greatly was Deng Xioaping, the then General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, whose reforms in the 80s have today created the world\'s second-largest economy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What stories caught your attention?*'<br />Author: 'ididacannonball'  id: 'l9oq8f'<br />Score:29<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l9oq8f/rindiaspeaks_biweekly_geopolitics_thread_eu/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Series: Sanskrit Non-translatables, Part 2 - MetaPhysics, - HINDUISM ≠ MONOTHEISM OR POLYTHEISM'<br />Body: '*Part 1:* [*Link*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l490or/book_summaryinsights_sanskrit_nontranslatables_by/)*. Adapted from the book - Sanskrit Non-translatables by Rajiv Malhotra and Satyanarayan Dasa Babaji.*\n\n **Estimated reading time:** 5 minutes, 3 seconds. Contains 1012 words.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Overview : METAPHYSICS\n\n* **Saguna/Nirguna  ≠** Qualified/Qualityless\n* **Atma  ≠** Soul\n* **Maya  ≠** Illusion\n* **Jiva  ≠** Soul\n* **Kaivalya  ≠** Salvation \n* **Hinduism  ≠** Monotheism or Polytheism *(current topic of the post)*\n* **Om  ≠** Amen\n\n# Intro: Metaphysics \n\nAlmost all Indian metaphysical systems deal with the nature of the individual self, the external insentient world, Universal Self or Brahman and the ultimate goal of man, namely, to escape from the limitations of this phenomenal life. \n\nThe Indian rishi-s had direct intuitive vision of metaphysical concepts such as atma, jiva, maya, etc., which are the fundamental truths of reality and verifiable by one willing to make an effort.\n\nIn the Vedantic thought, these entities are not independent but inseparably related and dependent on the one ontologically independent principle – the Brahman. \n\nIndian metaphysics also deals with the nature of causation. Vedanta propounds the theory of causal relation called satkaryavada (Vedantic theory of causality) which holds that the effect does not come into existence out of nothing. Any effect is always potentially present in its cause and is only a manifestation of that potential, just as a whole tree is potentially present in a seed and manifests from it. \n\n**An important corollary** that follows from the principle of satkaryavada is that the cosmos, including all the sentient jiva-s and insentient matter in it, is eternal and has not been created ex-nihilo at some point in time. The whole cosmos is only subject to cyclic manifestation and concealment, and not creation and destruction. Indian seers strongly believed that being cannot arise from void or non-being and vice versa. Abrahamic traditions, however, believe exactly the opposite and maintain that God created the universe and its contents.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Hinduism is not Monotheism/Polytheism \n\nWestern scholars tend to map the Vedic tradition onto the Judeo-Christian theological framework with categories such as monotheism, polytheism or pantheism, without any foundational basis.\n\nUnfortunately, today, some Hindus too have adopted this classification. \n\nHinduism, unlike Abrahamic religions, does not have just one authoritative book or one form of God. In the past, Hinduism had an apposite, and flourishing, system for understanding the shastra-s in the form of guru-shishya parampara. Today, with the decline of this parampara and the gurukula system, Hindus have become ignorant of their shastra-s and rely on speculations or half-baked knowledge available on the internet. \n\nMost Hindus are unable to understand the original shastra-s due to incompetence in Sanskrit and rely on English translations authored by Western scholars who are not practicing Hindus. \n\n**If the Hindu view of Ultimate Reality needs to be described in one term, it can be said that Hindus are tattvavadi-s.** **According to Hindu shastra-s, the absolute reality (tattva) is characterized as non-dual consciousness ( advaya-jnana) by the rishi-s who achieved Its realization.** Advaya-jnana is significantly not translated as ‘monistic consciousness’ but as non-dual consciousness because the term ‘monistic’ may imply that absolute reality is only one. However, the word ‘non-dual’ signifies that the absolute reality is indeed one, but this oneness does not negate variety or multiplicity within it. \n\n&gt;The word jnana means that absolute reality (tattva) is purely of the nature of consciousness. There is no word in Christian or any theology, be it monotheism, polytheism, pantheism or any other theism, which completely describes the meaning of the term advaya-jnana. \n\nMonotheism is an incorrect translation because it implies only one God and no multiple manifestations and forms of that one God. There are no multiple deities or devata-s and there is no profound philosophy or framework which defines the relationship between devata-s and the absolute reality Brahman in monotheism. \n\nThe doctrine of monotheism implicitly believes that God is separate from His creation and that he has created this universe out of nothing. Similarly, polytheism believes in the existence of many independent and distinct gods, completely unrelated to each other. \n\n&gt;**Describing Hinduism using these terms would involve the blunder of taking a sophisticated, well defined, and harmonious system and replacing it with a simplistic, limited, and logically inconsistent framework.** It will inevitably lead to expunging many profound and fundamental concepts from Hinduism which do not fit into the meaning of these terms. \n\nChristians eradicated polytheists in ancient Rome, Greece and other parts of the world in order to impose Christianity. These polytheists lacked any understanding of the inherent unity of every manifest thing, including their multiple gods. They had neither shastra-s nor the Veda-s. *Hinduism, on the other hand*, has a vast commentarial tradition to explain the profound ideas present in the Veda-s. **If Hindus start calling themselves polytheists, then it would be equivalent to a tacit denial of the validity of our shastra-s.** \n\nThe Ultimate Reality Brahman is described as sat-chit-ananda. Brahman is immanent but is not exhausted in the manifestation of sentient and insentient worlds, unlike in pantheism. Brahman is infinite and Its immanence does not affect Its transcendence. Brahman remains complete even after the manifestation of this universe from within Itself. *(This is reflected in the invocatory verse of the Īśopaniṣad: Pūrṇam adah, pūrṇam idam, pūrṇāt pūrṇam udachyate Pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate.)*\n\n**Monotheism and polytheism are merely speculative concepts of a material human mind, whereas Brahman is not.** Brahman can only be realized in a transcendental state when a person becomes aligned with that reality. Monotheism, polytheism, pantheism or animism may describe some part of Hindu philosophy but none of them represents Brahman completely. \n\nThe concepts of Brahman, Ishvara, Bhagavan and others need to be understood on their own terms to appreciate Hindu metaphysics and one cannot replace them with merely one term from Christian or any other theology. In Abrahamic religions, there is no practical method by which monotheism can be verified or polytheism, pantheism, etc., can be falsified. Hindu scholars should rise above their inferiority complex and not deliberately try and fit Hinduism within these Western theological frameworks for the sake of Western attention or acceptance. They should become bold enough to assert that Hinduism can only be described through the indigenous vocabulary derived from shastra-s.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Summary:** *Hinduism believes in the inherent unity of every Polytheist manifested entity. Brahman is m/ not exhausted in the Pantheism manifestation of both the sentient and insentient world. Monotheism has only one God but no multiple manifestations or forms of the one God – this is against dharmic ideas. Polytheism refers to existence of distinct, unrelated gods – this is different from the integral and unified, yet distinct entities in Hinduism. Pantheism espouses all things as being God but God is exhausted in immanence and there is no transcendent God which is opposite to the concepts in Hinduism.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: All views are of the authors.'<br />Author: 'xsupermoo'  id: 'l8yhx2'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l8yhx2/series_sanskrit_nontranslatables_part_2/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Who in India has the political will and motivation to mobilize lacs of farmers and wage a war against Delhi? - My Theory'<br />Body: 'Even though there are similar patterns between the CAA protests and the presently ongoing farmer protests, there is one major difference between the two. The farmers are not only a lot more determined and focused but as time passes, this is seeming less like a farmer agitation and more like a political battle coming from the west to conquer the seat of Delhi.\n\nThere is no doubt that there are a huge number of genuine farmers who are genuninely concerned about their future and sitting at Singhu border with a good intention. Nevertheless, there is also zero doubts that there is some political entity which is masterminding this from above and giving this protest its political will and direction. It was just sitting back and enjoying the show but has now spurted into action as soon as the movement started losing momentum following the 26th January incident. Had this been a genuine grassroots movement, so such action would have come to somehow salvage the protest and push it forward!\n\nWho is this political entity which is giving these protests a direction and pulling all strings possible to make it continue and ongoing? The first accusation goes to the opposition since they are the primary benefactors of this, isn\'t it? If the BJP govt. in Delhi falls, it will be replaced by a Congress or AAP or SP, isn\'t it? But I don\'t think so. For one, they have either lost all political capital in India or have too small a footprint to have managed such a large scale conspiracy against India. Also, I think they have managed to coexist with the BJP so far instead of creating friction with them. At least Kejriwal hasn\'t spoken anything against Modi (except in small talks or election speeches!) for many years now.\n\nIf not the opposition, who else then? The left liberals could have done it? The answer is no. If a dog barks against Modi in India, the left would make him their hero! They are followers of a wave, not creators. They are certainly relishing the idea of lacs of protesters agitating and solganeering against Modi govt. but even they lack the ability to manage this large a conspiracy. Farhan Akhtar tried his best to incite CAA protesters on twitter but that\'s the best people like him could do.\n\nThe ISI or CIA then? Again, a very bad conspiracy theory on several grounds. Firstly, their own countries are burning with things like economic depression and Capitol protests, its far fetched to think that they could have managed something this large in India. They may have their agents or cells here to keep an eye on what India is doing but managing this large a conspiracy in India while escaping the eyes of RAW/NIA is impossible.\n\nIf not the liberals/ISI/CIA, who then? It seems we have run out of all options. But then I look at our neighboring country Pakistan and who controls the show there. I also look at the kind of protests by all kinds of interest groups and political parties and then come to the conclusion that if the Pak Army controls that country (and IK is just a puppet PM), it certainly cannot be just one faction. Considering these ongoing upheavals, there must be more than one.\n\nEven though its a highly politically incorrect conclusion, its the only conclusion that makes sense after seeing what all is happening since last few days: India\'s Deep State (or agencies that work behind the scenes) is probably responsible for this - the factionism or turf wars between them. Another factor that helps you coming to this conclusion is when you look at a certain retired army man, Capt. Amrinder Singh who is the CM of Punjab. He has both resources and the motivation (grudges against PM Modi) to conquer Delhi. I wouldn\'t put it beyond him to call a few of his general friends in the Army (and/or other agencies) to hatch this plot. Its a very grave accusation which undermines our republic (perhaps even more than the republic day incident) but that\'s the only theory that makes sense.\n\nAnd then, something happened today in Indian media which kind of put a rubber stamp on this theory! Another ex army man, Major Gaurav Arya who is a prominent face on media and sympathetic to the Modi govt. has declared today that he was advised from "above" to stop giving public interviews. His scheduled YouTube show got cancelled today for the same reason. This is a clear indication that strings are being pulled on the backyards of the Indian deep state and battles are being fought! As an Indian citizen, all we can do is pray that order is maintained and the situation doesn\'t escalate beyond what it already has.\n\nBut at this stage, this is only a theory (albeit one that makes the most sense). If you have any other theories that explains this situation, I\'m all ears for that.'<br />Author: 'learned_cheetah'  id: 'l8j3pc'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l8j3pc/who_in_india_has_the_political_will_and/</li>

This has been corrected in hockey and can be easily corrected in football also. Today atleast in hockey india can out hustle teams like Australia and England.\nTo corrrect this in football For now Why don’t india develop 4 to 5 football academies in areas enthusiastic about football. There could be a a academy in Goa , Kerala, Bengal , TN and maybe 2 in the north east for now. Keep these academies on the outskirts of cities and staff them with decent facilities like swimming pools , training pitches , living quarters etc . Keep a full time coach , dietician, and trainer there. \nThese states are enthusiastic about football and will be more than happy to share the cost.Keep a provision for training around 70 kids in a academy ranging from age groups of 7 to 18. Let’s get their basic right so that they can run fast and are total athletes.\nSimultaneously in each academy give them basic football skills like dribbling, free kicks , ball handling etc. If we do this right then we will have a pool of 12 to 15 year olds who are fast , athletic and skilful . We can then form 2 or 3 under 18  teams with these guys and send them out of india to play teams from football countries who are in the 30 to 50 rank and when they are at home they can play each other honing and refining their skills . All This has to be arranged by coach and management of Indian football team. With the boys getting good game time and testing their skills against reasonable opposition we will eventually have a pool of 45 to 50 footballers to choose from and the academies in between churns out more. \nWhen player quality improves and we start winning more then it does 3 things \n1 . The game will pick up in rest of india\n2. Indian players will get more chance to play for better clubs abroad ( india will have to break into top 50  of fifa rankings atleast)\n3. Better clubs will open in india ( it’s not that there is a shortage of money in India ) . \nThis will put us in a positive feedback loop and things will only improve.\nI feel if we start following this blueprint India will emerge as a decent footballing nation in the next 12  years and can become world beaters in the next 20 years. \nThere is no reason why a nation with 140 crore people can’t field a decent football team.'<br />Author: 'fierce_archer'  id: 'l8cymd'<br />Score:32<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l8cymd/how_to_make_india_into_a_footballing_super_power/</li>

It’s the kind of nonsense you associate with Pakisthan or Saudi Arabia. Religion is one’s private matter – it has no place in public sphere.\n\nHate speech – directed at a community – is one thing, insult to a god or prophet is quite another. In one case you are targeting living humans, in the other you are insulting characters who may or may not exist and if they do exist, are not in the least bit affected by what you think or say of them. \n\nI would say it’s high time we put that behind us. If you want to draw a comic or tell a joke, you should be able to do it without worrying whether you would be insulting someone who is a fictional character to you.\n\nAll religions have aspects that are offensive to other religions. That is the problem with religion itself. So who gets to decide what is blasphemy and what is not.

I am ok with patriotism but its the arguments they made, to support that statement, that got me really pissed off.\n\nFor example, there was the usual India vs China debate. And to them, India is almost on par with China in all aspects. I have been to china and these guys wont ever be able to fathom what china is like. Then they confidently compare the manufacturing industry here with china's where again they will never have any idea how efficient manufacturing is there. Firstly it is super easy to find a manufacturer for any product even in tier 2 cities and then even smallest manufacturing shop has equipments that only big players have over here.\n\nAfter that, there is the cleanliness debate where these guys think India is actually cleaner than many other 3rd world countries but yet again they couldnt be so wrong. I have been to countries like Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and I found them super clean. These countries may be poorer than India but just because of the organization and cleanliness they have, they actually look richer. Also diversity, people keep saying how diverse we are with many languages, cultures, etc in one country. While i agree with that, there are still many countries in Africa that are full of different tribes with different languages, cultures, etc so we not unique in that department. I have also seen alot of Indians, Europeans, East Asians living in those countries so they dont lack diversity thats for sure.\n\nHow are we ever going to develop if people dont have the hunger to improve the situation here. When any bad thing pointed out about our country is taken as a serios offence and is counteracted by abusing some other 3rd world country that is also suffering with that problem.

Then have fish one day. Red meat once a week like lamb. And maybe lobia once and dal once. Or something like karela and chana dal.\n\nOr would it be better to just eat chicken almost every day.

One of the floating ad was using phonepe\'s logo and was something like "I won this much amount, click to claim and transfer to bank". Obviously it was some phising/scam ad link. It redirected to a scam page with URL : https://pn0hepe.com/index1.html . It was like a scratch card and below there was an option to claim reward. Clicking on it, it was trying to open phonePe app. Checked YouTube and found [this](https://youtu.be/ttgTz0ezXxg) low effort video in hindi if anyone interested to exactly understand what I am saying. I have not given default permissions to phonePe, so it didn\'t opened directly but one thing I noticed that to make the ad look more real, the advertisement also had a account number in it. Account number was all X\'s with only last 3 digits visible. Now the issue is I had a sbi debit card with the same last 3 digits as shown on the ad. Though that card is no longer in use from around past 1.5-2 years and got changed when sbi rolled out new chip cards. It\'s basically a dead card now. \n\nMy concern is how I am seeing such personalized ad after so much time and how my debit card\'s last 3 digits ended up in such a scam advertisement. Getting a phishing email or phone call with your debit card\'s details is still understandable but getting an advertisement that too for your dead card is bit weird and worrisome. Is it due to my IP address? Mac address ? Or something else ? Or maybe a coincidence. I am not a tech guy, so don\'t have much knowledge about it.

The peaceful farmers protesting on the borders have started threatening the elderly. In a shocking video uploaded by investigative journalist Nitin Shukla, an elderly man was seen sitting on the road urging protesters to kill him after they stopped him and threatened to go back. Listening to the elderly in the video appears to be a case of hooliganism by the "peaceful farmers". The incident took place at UP Gate.\n\nThe elderly man said in the video that he was trying to cross the protest site as he had an appointment with a doctor at Panth Hospital. He said that some protesters came in front of his car and threatened to beat him. The man came out of the car and confronted them, after which he backed off. While the elderly man was telling his ordeal, a cameraman (as per the tweet, he was from Republic TV) was also warned by the people present there not to record the video.\n\nThe "peaceful farmers" shouted at the man from a distance and said something about the laws, to which he said that he does not care about the laws. All he cares about the trouble the alleged farmers were causing. Towards the end, the elderly man said, “What is our fault? Can’t we cross the road? Is this road belongs to someone’s father?”\n\nSource : [Nitin Shukla\'s Twitter Post](https://twitter.com/nshuklain/status/1354396647518654468)'<br />Author: 'Alpha-Tigers'  id: 'l6nzye'<br />Score:40<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l6nzye/why_did_the_peaceful_farmers_tried_to_stop_an/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Kunchan Nambiar - The Indian Comic/ Poet Who Did Not Fear Gods or Kings.'<br />Body: "[Kunchan Nambiar](https://religion.wikia.org/wiki/Kalakkaththu_Kunchan_Nambiar), (1705 - 1770) one of Kerala's ancient Poetic Trio, is the originator of one of the most daring forms of satire and comedy in Indian culture - the Thullal. The origin of the artform is shrouded in legend, but what is certain is that in the hands of this genius, the myth-centric artform became the perfect weapon for social criticism.\n\nBest known for its quick, perky rhythm and razor sharp wit, Thullal lyrics re interpreted stories from Hindu mythology to make them relevant to the poet's contemporaries - including, and especially, the commoners. Nambiar placed gods and demigods in the backdrop of local culture, using them as stand-ins for the corrupt upper classes of the time. \n\nIndra, the king of gods, was the most common target, made to represent the royals of the time - most Thullal lyrics featuring Indra have him indulging in the sort of decadent activities the upper class of the time were famous for or fleeing for succor from one asura or another to Vishnu/Shiva who in turn call him out for his cowardice and grandstanding. But even the Trimurtis are not spared from being standins for the corrupt elite - in Banavijayam, featuring the battle between Krishna and Shiva, the latter, along with his armies and his sons becomes a target. \n\nIn the depiction of the fleeing army (a recurring motif in Nambiar's lyrics and one that he handles with aplomb) special attention is paid to pot-bellied Ganesh, as a reflection on the easy living, obese upper classes who prides themselves on being great warriors but happens to be so unused to physical labor that they wouldn't be able to survive even moments of real danger.\n\n Likewise, his best known work Kalyana Saugandhikam re interprets the Mahabharatha storylines, with Hanuman calling Bhima (who represents the upper class) out on his current boastfulness and show-off nature contrasted with his inaction when Draupadi was disrobed. The mainstream interpretation of the mighty Pandava hero is taken apart by Hanuman's questions, long before it was considered fashionable to deconstruct mythology.\n\nNambiar pulled no punches when it came to calling out what he considered the greatest failures of his society - the illogic of the caste system, the widespread corruption, the decadence of the upper class, the division between classes which allow outsiders to seize power, the use of religion for exploiting the poor and the vulnerable and much more. His lyrics have gained the status of proverbs in Malayalam -\n\nEg: 'Mullapoompodiyettu kidakkum kallinumundam oru saurabhyam' - Even a stone gains fragrance if it lies close to Jasmine flowers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe best part - Kunchan Nambiar was a court poet and a favorite of the local king, with Thullal works being performed regularly at the Royal Court and at temples. The poet's irreverence was considered of little impact compared to the hilariousness of his verses."<br />Author: 'sanctum502'  id: 'l6n95x'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l6n95x/kunchan_nambiar_the_indian_comic_poet_who_did_not/</li>

The original constitution had 22 parts (like citizenship, fundamental rights). And for each part, the painter Nandlal Bose and his team drew up an illustration.\n\n**Part II on citizenship** has the [illustration of a Vedic Gurukul](https://i1.wp.com/myvoice.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/gurukul.png?resize=696%2C347&amp;ssl=1) and **part III, dealing with fundamental rights**, has the [illumined with the portrait of Rama, Lakshman and Sita](https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/01/e2.jpg) returning home after the battle in Lanka.\n\nHello commies, how do you do?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #2. Constitution grants freedom of speech/expression only to Indian citizens.\n\nSome fundamental rights are available to both citizens and foreigners. For example, religious freedom (art. 25-28) is available to non-citizens too.\n\nBut some rights are exclusive to citizens only.\n\nSo, **article 19** which enumerates different freedoms (speech/expression, assembly, trade and commerce, residence etc.) **is for Indians only.**\n\nThat's why foreign exchange students who take part in Indian protests can claim the protection of librus but not of constitution.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #3. Conversion using any type of inducement (money, rice etc.) is unconstitutional\n\nArticle 25 grants each person the 'freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion.'\n\n**Some Christian groups had interpreted the right** to propagate religion as the right to convert people of other faiths into Christianity, *by any means.*\n\nIn *Stanislaus case* (1977), Supreme court has rejected this interpretation totally. It held that the right to propagate includes the right to spread or disseminate the tenets of one's religion (say, by preaching) but it would *not* include the right to convert another.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #4. Reservation is subject to maintaining efficiency in administration.\n\nArticle 15(5) of the constitution enables the state to make 'any special provision, by law, for the advancement of ... SCs/STs in ... educational institutions.'\n\nReservation in govt jobs is provided for in art. 16(4).\n\nBut such claims for reservation shall be conditional to *maintenance of efficiency of administration* (art. 335)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #5. Uniform Civil Code\n\nArticle 44: ' The State shall endeavor to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.'\n\nBelief in constitution should not be here and there, but *in toto.*  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #6. Prohibit cow slaughter\n\nArticle 48 asks the state to endeavor to, among other things, prohibit 'the slaughter, of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle.'\n\nThe state is endeavoring. Haha.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #7.

What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what  appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the  supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. \n\n## (Mal)\n\n---\n\n**Show Information**\n\n* **Attack on Titan**\n\n[AniList](https://anilist.co/anime/16498/Shingeki-no-Kyojin) | [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin) | [AnimeNewsNetwork](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=14950)\n\n---\n\n**Streams**\n\n* **Attack on Titan**\n\n[Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/attack-on-titan) | [Anime Lab](https://www.animelab.com/shows/attack-on-titan) | [Adult Swim](https://www.adultswim.com/videos/attack-on-titan) | [Funimation](https://www.funimation.com/shows/attack-on-titan) | [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/series/attack-on-titan-9c91ffa3-dc20-48bf-8bc5-692e37c76d88) | [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/70299043) | [Tubi](https://tubitv.com/series/2318/attack-on-titan-subtitled)\n\n---\n\n# Manga recommendation of the week\n\n# Soul Eater\n\n&gt;Maka is a weapon meister, determined to turn her partner, a living scythe named Soul Eater, into a powerful death scythe — the ultimate weapon of Death himself!

      <li>Title::: 'Prabhupāda: Well, in politics, unless there is violence, you cannot take. Simply by sweet words, not possible. That was the difference between our political leaders, Mahatma Gandhi and Subhash Chandra Bose. ..'<br />Body: 'Prabhupāda: Well, in politics, unless there is violence, you cannot take. Simply by sweet words, not possible. That was the difference between our political leaders, Mahatma Gandhi and Subhash Chandra Bose. So Subhash Chandra Bose was of opinion that—and that is a fact—that "You are agitating non-violence. These people will never care for your non-violence. Unless there is violence, so these Britishers will never go away." So Gandhi would say, "No, I am not going to accept this violence theory. I shall continue." So for thirty years... He started from 1917 and up to \'47, the Britishers did not go. But when Subhash Chandra Bose, he saw... He took the political power. He became the president. But Gandhi was angry. So because he was old leader, out of respect, he resigned the presidentship. Then he though that "So long this man will live, there will be no independence." So he went out of India and joined with Hitler, and Tojo, Japanese.\n\nNitāi: Who went out of India?\n\nPrabhupāda: This Subhash Chandra Bose. And he organized the INA, Indian National Army. So when this Indian National Army was organized and the Britishers... They were great politicians. They saw, "Now the army is going to national movement. We cannot be." Then they left. Because it was not possible. They were maintaining British Empire with Indian money, Indian men. You see? They did not conquer by their British soldiers all round the Far East, Burma and the Mesopotamia, and the Egypt. That was Indian army, the Sikh soldiers and the Gurkha soldiers, and Indian money. On the pretext that "For Indian protection, we are maintaining this army." Actually, they were expanding their empire. Africa, Burma. And when they saw that "India is lost," voluntarily they liquidated all others. Went back... Back to home, back to Godhead. (devotees laugh) So in politics this is nonsense, non-violence. It is nonsense, cowardism. In politics in sweet words you cannot get. There must be fight, arms. That is army. "If you don\'t agree, then fist." That is politics. There must be violence. Otherwise you cannot control. When there is educated good men, then you can argue. But when people are ruffians, there is no question of good... Argumentum vaculum, I told you the other day...  \n\nhttps://vaniquotes.org/wiki/Subhash_Bose_and_the_INA_'<br />Author: 'soulular_energ2'  id: 'l4e1b7'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l4e1b7/prabhupāda_well_in_politics_unless_there_is/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Book Summary/Insights - Sanskrit Non-translatables by Rajiv Malhotra and Satyanarayan Dasa Babaji'<br />Body: "**This will be a 'Series' of posts going over 54 terms as discussed in the book. I aim to summarise the term/concept these posts, for easy reading and generating discussions around them. Hope you enjoy it!**\n\n* This book makes the convincing case that english is deficient in its ability to express the profound meanings of the shastras for which Sanskrit words are necessary. As English has assimilated non-translatable terms from virtually all major world languages, and takes pride in doing so, there is no reason why it should hesitate to do so for Sanskirt, a Classical language very much alive today.\n* The 19th century honeymoon period with Sanskrit-Hindu intellectual heritage is over, and since then western thought has had the political agenda of subverting hinduism and hindu culture by the Macaulayised assault on its text and thoughts.\n* This is a book every english educated indian must read to further decolonise their mind and stand up to the hegemony of Western thought. **This book is not meant for teaching Sanskrit**. It undertakes to explain the inadequate translation of many Sanskrit terms into English, which is commonplace. It spotlights several Sanskrit terms that are loosely and unthinkingly replaced with English translations and shows how the deep and profound implications of these words get lost.\n* It provides lucid explanations of the central concepts of Sanatan Dharma and brings to attention the errors and distortions that have been introduced by the use of English words.\n* All in all, it's quite an eye-opener.\n\n[Overview](https://preview.redd.it/xh57x9utpcd61.png?width=394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea17b48b152bd3d046aa0dca8aef9c6ecaf54b50)\n\n&gt;An example: The second sutra of Patanjali’s Yoga-Sutra reads, ‘yogah chitta-vritti-nirodhah’, and the anuvada **in Sanskrit** could be ‘chittasya vrittinam nirodhanam yogah’. **In Hindi** ‘chitta ki vrittiyon ka nirodha yoga hai’. **In English**, ‘Union (yoga) is the suppression of the modifications of the unconscious mind’.\n\nTo a reader who knows both Sanskrit and English, this anuvada (translation) will be nowhere close in spirit or meaning to the original Sanskrit sutra. A Hindi speaker reading the above Hindi translation will understand the intent of Patanjali far better than an English speaker reading the English translation.\n\nMost formal channels such as academia, journals and other top-down structures that legitimize knowledge, are presently too entrenched and prefer maintaining the current status quo on the narratives of Western supremacy and Western worldviews.\n\nI hope this short post, encourages you to read more on this topic, and share amongst your community this knowledge and awareness.\n\n# Sanskrit is the unifying substrate of dharmic civilization and has profoundly shaped it. Etymologically, Sanskrit means ‘elaborated’, ‘having the samskara of vyakaranam’, ‘refined’, ‘cultured’ and ‘civilized’, implying wholeness of expression. Employed by the refined and educated as their preferred means of communication, Sanskrit has influenced a distinct cultural system and way of experiencing the world since several millennia.\n\nEdit: I shall, every week take up one or more of the words/terms explained in the book and summarize it."<br />Author: 'xsupermoo'  id: 'l490or'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l490or/book_summaryinsights_sanskrit_nontranslatables_by/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'TIL the Catholic Church of India campaigned massively to the censor board and the cabinet in 2009 to get several scenes of Angels and Demons axed, and after the scenes were axed, they blamed the board for not consulting church upfront as they were now coming across as "intolerant" community.'<br />Body: 'On May 15 2009, Columbia pictures had scheduled the worldwide release of the movie version of Dan Brown’s ‘Angels and Demons‘. On March 25 2009, an email was sent to a group of Christian activists from an organization ‘The Catholic – Christian Secular Forum (The CSF)’. It explained why a ban should be sought on the movie:\n\nThe movie with its special effects is expected to have a disastrous the impact on the minds of millions of gullible viewers will be disastrous. It is bound to vitiate the social fabric of the country &amp; create communal disharmony. It will result in a negative image of the Christian community &amp; the Church, aggravating the discord that exists in Orissa, Karnataka &amp; BJP-ruled states and does not harbour well for the future.\n\nAnd then the email explained in detail what scenes in the movie were theologically unacceptable to Christians:\n\nA Pope who fathers a child by artificially inseminating a nun, claiming both are virgins. The Pope is indebted to Science for this miracle and allows a priest to pursue science &amp; even adopt a daughter.\nActions of various Popes with respect to ‘pornographic’ Vatican religious sculptures mocked, like sculptures of St. Teresa or Vatican’s male nude statues.\nLies about historical events, issues and persons, like the Church’s anti-Science stance, Illuminati, Crusades, Galileo, Bernini, CERN, etc.\nTwo Popes get elected, one happens to be the murdered Pope’s son, who is Pope for as little as 17 minutes, as per ancient Roman law.\nNegative portrayal of Popes, as Murderers, Swindlers or Cheats and Vatican as a den of criminals &amp; schemers for world dominion.\nFree Masons and the Vatican alleged to be involved in a financial fraud, leading to even the murder of the Pope.\nCross, Christmas, Sun Worship, Canonization, Holy Communion… borrowed &amp; repackaged by Christianity.\nCatholic Church, the Papal institution &amp; election of Popes ridiculed, trivialized &amp; decried.\nDesecrates religion, incites religious communities against the other &amp; hurts sentiments.\nNefarious motives imputed to the Catholic Church, which is made villain of the story.\nIn a week’s time this was followed by another mail by the CSF (dated 30-Mar-2009) After revealing that ‘our protests have already starting bearing fruit‘ and that ‘the Censor Board says will look at it seriously‘ the mail urged the believers: ‘If we all work together on it and before time – the next month; I am confident the Lord will bless us with success‘. What the believers should do was detailed thus:\n\nAdvise/issue an advisory on the facts of the film and ask followers/friends to boycott and protest against Angels &amp; Demons.\nSend memorandums asking national/state governments, local administrations, police, etc. to ban the film.\nDo also urge your bishop &amp; local church to send at least an email to the ones in the PS marked with *\nIn India, you may write to the President, Sonia Gandhi, PM, HM, MM, CM, Censor Board, etc.\nThe * marked people were:\n\nPresident, Smt Pratibha Patil\nSmt. Sonia Gandhi\nPrime Minister, Manmohan Singh\nHome Minister, P Chidambaram\nMinorities Minister, AR Antulay\nNCP Chief, Sharad Pawar\nOpp Leader, LK Advani\nMinorities Commission Chief, Mohd Shafi Quereshi\nSmt Sushma Singh, I&amp;B Sec\nVB Pyarelal, I&amp;B Jt. Sec\nCensor Board Chief, Smt Sharmila Tagore\nI&amp;B Minister of State, Anand Sharma\nI&amp;B Minister of State, MH Ambareesh\n For each person the official email id and contact numbers were given in the email. A brief was given as to which scenes the Christians should protest as objectionable in the movie and why (the scenes listed previously). The mail stated that the movie was ‘no regular science fiction film’ and was ‘anti-Religion, anti-Christian, anti-Catholic, anti-History, anti-Truth’ with ‘devilish machinations’.\n\n The next e-mail was dated 21-Apr-2009. Here the CSF announced the statement of the ‘Most Rev. Stanislaus Fernandes SJ, Secretary General of the Catholic Bishop Conference of India (CBCI)’, the apex body of the Catholic Church in India. The Jesuit Bishop stationed at Gujarat had demanded the Government of India that the movie be banned:\n\n We ask for banning of the controversial film in India where Christianity is still in the process of being understood by large section of society. To present the Holy Bible and its sacred messages in a distorted manner is an insult to Christianity and its followers, not only in India but also all over the world.\n\n Again the believers were asked to write letters but this time specifically to Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh, P.Chidambaram, VB Pyarelal (I&amp;B Jt. Sec) and Sharmilla Tagore (Indian Censor Board chief). The CSF also gave a detailed instruction to its fellow travelers as to how to legally egg for banning the movie:\n\n You are urged to consider taking cognizance of offences under some / all of the following Sections, besides which, it also violates the Censor Board Rules for Film Certification &amp; thus becomes liable – Sections 295, 295(a) read with section 34, 120(b), 153, 298, 153A, 153B, 505, 505(2), etc.\n\n On 4th April the next email from the CSF asked Christians if they had ‘done your bit on Angels &amp; Demons’ and asked them to ’email/fax the authorities’ and ‘request your Bishop/group too’. The call was repeated again in the email dated 6th April.\n\n Then in the email dated on 19th April 2009, the CSF came up with a ‘Stop Press’ statement. It stated that CBCI had asked for a ban on the movie and informed the receivers that all concerned authorities ‘need to be flooded with emails of the hurt Christian sentiments’; once again select emails of the authorities and politicians were given. The CSF also listed the ground activities it was organizing calling for a ban on the ‘Angels and Demons’. ‘The protests against Angels &amp; Demons has snowballed with the Catholic Bishop’s Conference of India throwing in its weight, by writing to the Censor Board Chief calling for a ban on the film’ the email receivers were informed along with a hyperlink to a report from ‘Hindustan Times’ dated 18-Apr-2009. ‘The CSF used the 21st Annual Lenten Pilgrimage on Good Friday to draw attention to the film’ the email said. Again on 21st April 2009 another email was sent by the CSF urging the Christians that they ‘need to do a bit more, before the Lord gives us success on Angels &amp; Demons’.\n\n Then on 30-Apr-2009 the CSF announced its first major victory:\n\n The Christian community’s protest against Angels &amp; Demons is reaching its final stage. The Censor Board Screening Committe has seen the film and have issued NO Certificate, in view of the contents of the movie. They have now referred the film to a Revising Committee and as urged upon, by The CSF, the chairperson, Smt. Sharmila Tagore will also be present.\n\nIn keeping with the High Court ruling, in an earlier writ-petition filed by The CSF, and also Official Guidelines, we have represented to the Censor Board, that in matter pertaining to Catholicism, the opinion of the Catholic Bishops Conference of India (CBCI) should be binding. The Censor Board has therefore asked for 4 representatives of the Catholic Bishops to see the film. The CBCI has also already written to the Censor Board calling for a ban on Angels &amp; Demons. The ball is now in the Catholic Bishops’ court. If after seeing the film, it recommends a ban – Banned it will it be.\n\n Then it requested every Christian to write to the CBCI requesting a ban as those emails in possession of the CBCI would strengthen its case for a ban. The reasons given by the CSF are interesting. It says the film needs to be banned in India because Vatican has condemned it: ‘The Vatican has condemned it, thousands of Christians on Good Friday prayed &amp; protested publicly against Angels &amp; Demons, the media has widely covered the hurt feelings of the community.’ The CSF concludes with the most important observation:\n\nA ban on Angels &amp; Demons will ensure No More of such films against the Church/Christians/Christianity are released in India. This is our one chance to stop it.\n\nIn other words, Vatican will decide what Indians should and should not see about Christianity. And Indian Censor Board was giving in happily. And there was not even a murmur from the intellectuals at this well organized subversion of freedom of expression.\n\n Then in its email dated 03-May-2009, the CSF made a revelation that the Church representatives had managed to make deletions to the film, a disclaimer that it was only an act of ficton &amp; also an ‘A’ (Adults only) certificate, which they felt would ‘make the film, less anti-Catholic and acceptable’. However the CSF was not clearly satisfied. It declared:\n\n We would certainly have expected more, but one accepts their wise discretion, since there could have been reasons, which led them to such a decision. The CSF however, needs to learn lessons from the Angels &amp; Demons episode, especially since, we understand another film – Corpus Christi, featuring a homosexual Jesus is being produced. Surely, the Church cannot clear Corpus Christi, agreeing to cuts of gay sex with the apostles, with a disclaimer &amp; obviously an ‘A’ certificate? Or can we expect it to do so?\n\n What did happen exactly?\n\n In a separate group posting dated 04-May-2009, Dr. John Dayal, a fanatical Christian propagandist revealed what had actually happened:\n\n Mrs Sharmila Tagore, the Chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification, called for a review screening of the controversial film Angels and Demons, a sort of a sequel to Da Vinci Code, at the Films Division Auditorium, Mahadev Road, New Delhi. Apart from the review committee of the Board which included two men members – the Congress leader Tom Vaddakkan and the public relations guru Dilip Cherian, Ms Tagore also invited representatives of the Catholic Bishops conference and me. CBCI officials who attended the special screening included the Official Spokesmen, Fr Babu Joseph, svd, the executive secretary of the CBCI media commission Fr George Plathottam, sdb , Delhi Media Commission director Fr John Paul Herman svd, the Principal of St Columba School, New Delhi and two others. …\n\nThe Censor board made it clear they were in no mood to ban the film which will soon \n\nhttps://swarajyamag.com/commentary/religious-censorship-in-india-a-case-study'<br />Author: 'alubonda'  id: 'l43tjj'<br />Score:380<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l43tjj/til_the_catholic_church_of_india_campaigned/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Racism and Colorism and Casteism in Bollywood'<br />Body: 'Has anyone else noticed that like EVERY single female actress in Bollywood is either North Indian OR from a Bhramin caste? Like I cannot think of a single female Bollywood actress that is not North Indian or Bhramin. Although Aishwayra Rai and Deepika Paudukone are south Indian, they are still bhramins, like most south Indian actresses. And everyone knows that Bhramins tend to look different from other Indians. \n\nBut casteism is not my main issue. My issue is that Bollywood always only shows only one kind of female beauty. Tall, slim and as white as paper. A lot of Bollywood actresses also have European or Persian decent. Like Alia Bhatt, Katrina Kaif and Tabu. Also nowadays they are even starting to import European actresses like Amy Jackson. Not to mention all the white women they always use as background dancers when it makes absolutely no sense. But on the other the male actors can look dark and they are allowed to look like typical Indians. Like Ajay Devgan and Dhanush. Why cant Bollywood have a dark skinned woman for once? If dark skinned men are allowed then why aren\'t dark skinned women? I would love to for once see a non Bhramin, non fair skinned woman take the stage. But Bollywood continues to be racist to this day. For example the Beyonce sharma jayegi song. \n\nI mean India is mostly full of brown skinned people. So why is it that the ones on the silver screen are always white skinned? Theres nothing wrong with being dark. Dark is beautiful. Dark skin ages so well. Using skin color as a determining factor for beauty is so outdated and primitive. Your facial features matter more than skin color. Take Deepika for example, even if you paint her black, white, yellow or blue she will still be beautiful because she has beautiful facial features and good bone structure. But Bolywood and their backwards mentality will still prefer ugly(in my opinion) actresses like Kareena Kapoor just because they have white skin and light eyes. Or actresses that can hardly act like Katrina, just because she looks gori. \n\nAnd before you come at me saying "nOt AlL iNdIaNs ArE dArK", I know! Indians come in a variety of colors and sizes. But everyone knows that MOST Indians are brown skinned and I just feel that Bollywood should be promoting the image of a normal and average Indian. Not a half breed, white-washed version of an Indian. Because young girls look up to these actresses. And if they see their own country\'s people praising women who dont look like them, and look like Europeans instead, imagine the self hate and insecurity those little girls will go through in life.\n\nColorism casteism and racism need to stop!'<br />Author: 'nushi79'  id: 'l3shlj'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l3shlj/racism_and_colorism_and_casteism_in_bollywood/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Varanasi: The Shia-Sunni stalemate in Doshipura that started in 1878'<br />Body: '##The Doshipura court case, which has been pitting Shia Muslims against  Sunnis over two acres of land (87,000 sq ft) for more than a century,  is one of the oldest in India. It began in 1878.\n\nDoshipura\'s Shia-Sunni dispute began in the nineteenth century (India Today, January 15) over a plot of land donated by the Maharaja of Benares for common religious use. The first case involving a dispute between the two sects was recorded in 1878 and similar disputes continued through the years.\n\nIn 1981 the Supreme Court upheld the Shias claim on the land, and two years later ordered that the Sunni graves be shifted elsewhere. But the Sunnis refused to do so. With Sunnis greatly outnumbering Shias in Varanasi, the entire plot remained under Sunni control.\n\n   \n**March 21 , 1984 Supreme COurt orders if the issue is not amicably solved by April 27, the graves will have to be shifted.**    \n\n&gt;The Supreme Court has ordered that if the long-standing dispute between  Shias and Sunnis over two Sunni graves in an overwhelmingly Shia area is  not amicably solved by April 27, the graves will have to be shifted.  The court on March 21 permitted Suleman Sait, MP and president of the  All-India Muslim League, to try and bring about a settlement by then. \n\nMen of the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) are conspicuous by their  presence and the local police have been strengthened with armed  reinforcements. Five companies of the PAC have been pressed into service  here and a battalion of the Border Security Force (BSF) remains on the  alert 6 km away. Some officials confided that there are at least 70 PAC  and BSF companies waiting in reserve. \n\n*"We stand by our decision to commit mass suicide or resist the move by all means. No Sunni Muslim will allow this to happen," stormed Sunni leader Irfanul Haq Ansari of Doshipura. Many Sunnis consider the court order an anti-Islamic action. "Nobody knows who will do what. Some will commit suicide and some will attack others,"* added another Sunni, Dr F. Kalam.\n\n---\n\n##District magistrate issued notices inviting the legal heirs of those buried in the disputed graves to come forward and help in the shifting.\n\nOne Subhan Ali \'Surtiwalla\' then appeared and claimed the graves belonged to his family but refused to cooperate in removing them. He filed a writ in the Supreme Court praying that he too must be heard.\n\nHe told India Today that he had documentary evidence to prove that the plot was used as the graveyard of his ancestors till 1931, when the court barred further burying. Records show that one Lal Mohammed was buried on the plot in April 25, 1918, and Sakina was laid to rest there on November 15, 1915. Says Subhan Ali: "In no case will I allow anybody to touch these graves, not while I am alive."\n\n\n---\n\n## Issue raised in Rajya Sabha\n\nthe issue was raised last fortnight in the Rajya Sabha by both Congress(I) and opposition members who urged the Centre to prevent the shifting of the graves and thereby also prevent bloodshed. In the state assembly Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ammar Rizvi said the Government was trying to resolve the dispute amicably and to arrange talks between the two sects. According to him several rounds of talks had already taken place.\n\n---\n\nQadar feared that if the Supreme Court order regarding Doshipura was implemented the mosque and many others could be removed. Doshipura will set a tradition as hundreds of Aurangzeb mosques and graveyards in the country are under dispute, he said.\n\n---\n\nInquiries and committes are still being setup, benches passing orders asking why previous judicial orders are not followed and we must only wonder why,\n\n*Sources:*\n- https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/Doshipura-graveyard-case-Committee-conducts-inquiry-to-ascertain-usage-of-property/articleshow/18620216.cms\n- https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/solution-in-sight-to-116-yr-old-land-row/story-893BRj4baf5DmcQLoaJS8I.html\n- https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/religion/story/19840415-doshipura-area-of-varanasi-under-siege-as-shias-and-sunnis-spar-over-two-sunni-graves-802966-1984-04-15'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'l3aup7'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l3aup7/varanasi_the_shiasunni_stalemate_in_doshipura/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'What does "emergency market authorization" mean for vaccines?'<br />Body: ' Vaccines is the talk now, with a lot of debate in the press.\n\nFirst  we have the Bharat Biotech vaccine which has been approved for  "emergency market authorization", but it hasn\'t completed phase 3  trials. Mor recently it has begun asking those getting a jab to sign a  consent form, which says they\'re aware the vaccine hasn\'t completed  phase 3 trials and the company has also released a statement saying  they\'ll compensate anyone having adverse reactions.\n\nThen  there have been cases of people dying from Oxford\'s vaccine (few and  far). So what exactly does "emergency market authorization" mean?\n\nThe following is taken from a comment on FT:\n\n* All  the companies wanted an "emergency market authorization", a super quick  procedure that requires the bare minimum of data. So they  initially  submitted the bare minimum of data. European Medical Agency (EMA) ruled  that this is not  the appropriate procedure for something that will be  administered to 460 million people.\n* EMA  insisted that a "conditional marketing authorization" is the  appropriate procedure for something that will be administered to 460  million people. It requires a lot more data and imposes an obligation on  the companies to continuously monitor the effects and report  immediately to EMA.\n* No  company wanted to do this, they tried to pile pressure upon EMA for  their preferred "emergency market authorization". Pfizer, then Moderna  were the first to buckle and submit the full data required by EMA.  AstraZeneca was playing silly buggers **until the 2nd week of January 2021** when it finally condescended to submit an application for a "conditional market authorization", with all the required data.\n* So  EMA is now analyzing data that Medicines and Healthcare products  Regulatory Agency (MHRA, UK agency) never even looked at. The latter was  the first in the world to authorize Oxford\'s vaccine.\n* An  interesting aspect of the emergency versus conditional authorization   is that the latter is much better logistically for scaling up production  and distribution of a vaccine: you just certify the production process  once. With an emergency authorization, you\'re supposed to test each new   batch but the UK waived this through in the race for more jabs. \n\nP.S: You can track vaccine rollout globally here:[https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/)'<br />Author: 'tryingmybest8'  id: 'l36afd'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l36afd/what_does_emergency_market_authorization_mean_for/</li>

I am also confused with some things and would ask some questions as well and will hopefully get a factual response.\nI’ll talk with an unbiased view and hopefully will be able to give everyone a better understanding of what’s happening:\n\n1. First things first, Every person has right to protest, at least in a democracy, why is the govt using violence and trying to oppress the protestors when there’s no retaliation from the protestors? This protest has been among the most peaceful protest ever. (Is India trying to become a superpower by copying China)\n\n2. Let’s assume that farmers are being misguided for some political or terrorism propaganda, then why is the govt themselves not able to help them understand by making a good argument? \n\n3. News channels used to get high TRPs by getting facts or evidences first in an unbiased manner in the past. Why is every channel saying the same script about the protestors being anti-national and the govt being good? Does it not show that media is sold?\n\n4. The farmers from states ministered by BJP are not able to join the protest and mainstream media channels are not covering that (Can be seen in regional news channels). Even still, Punjab and Haryana are the ones that are most affected so they are trying to take a stand.\n\n5. Most of the videos that show hate speech which might incite violence are not from the current protest. Let’s say someone is trying to incite violence, why don’t the govt get evidence and arrest them instead of beating the farmers?\n\nPS: I am not talking about being for/against the farm laws. \nPPS: I am a Punjabi and I am not a terrorist.'<br />Author: 'RoMzz37'  id: 'l340i6'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l340i6/perspective_regarding_farm_laws/</li>

Since the social media and web series creators grow because of the huge number of eyes their content gets, the penalty HAS TO BE tied to the same views. \n\nIf contempt against a religion/group/defence force is established in court, each view should be considered an instance of violation. So the penalty should be: (number of views till the content is removed) X (the damages owed to a single person)\n\n1. There is precedent similar to this that these content creator platforms use against people. In piracy each the monetary value of content shared or downloaded is multipled by the number of users in the peer group to arrive at the damages claimed by them against individuals. It is a estimate and is challenged but there is legal precedence.\n2. The more they delay removing the content the worse it will be for them.\n3. The more sensational they try to make their content to get more eyes, the worse it will get for them\n4. Can be easily implemented by an ordinance.\n5. Law suits can be filed in various jurisdictions separately in India and even if SC clubs them all the multiplicand (of total views) will increase.\n6. Hitting in the wallet will ruin all these Nawabs and Bhais and New Age Internet Moguls.\n7. Similar lawsuits can be filed in other countries by expats, because banning in India is not sufficient. \n8.

This is only a half-truth. For Islam divides as inexorably as it binds. Islam is a close corporation and the distinction that it makes between Muslims and non-Muslims is a very real, very positive and very alienating distinction. The brotherhood of Islam is not the universal brotherhood of man. It is brotherhood of Muslims for Muslims only. There is a fraternity, but its benefit is confined to those within that corporation. For those who are outside the corporation, there is nothing but contempt and enmity. The second defect of Islam is that it is a system of social self-government and is incompatible with local self-government, because the allegiance of a Muslim does not rest on his domicile in the country which is his but on the faith to which he belongs. To the Muslim ibi bene ibi patria [Where it is well with me, there is my country] is unthinkable. Wherever there is the rule of Islam, there is his own country. In other words, Islam can never allow a true Muslim to adopt India as his motherland and regard a Hindu as his kith and kin.”'<br />Author: 'random_dude_176234'  id: 'l2ar49'<br />Score:47<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l2ar49/dr_ambedkar_on_islam/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Jihad Diaries- Crimes of Ghazni'<br />Body: '**Battle of Peshawar 1001 CE**\n\nAn account of the battle between the invading Turkic Ghaznavids and the Shahi kingdom was given by Al-Utbi in Tarikh Yamini. According to Al-Utbi, Mahmud pitched his tent outside the city upon reaching Peshawar. Jayapala avoided action for some time waiting for reinforcements, and Mahmud then took the decision to attack with swords, arrows, and spears. Jayapala moved his cavalry and elephants to engage his opponent, but his army was decisively defeated.\n\nAccording to the sources, Jayapala, along with members of his family were captured, and valuable personal adornments were taken off the prisoners, including a necklace of great value from Jayapala. The figures of Hindu dead ranged from 5,000 to 15,000 and five hundred thousands were said to have been taken captive. Judging from the personal adornments taken off captured Hindus, Jayapala\'s army was not prepared for battle and thousands of children were taken captive as well. The count of slaves taken by Mahmud from Peshawar is said to by 1,00,000.\n\nAftermath Jayapala was bound and paraded, and a large ransom was paid for the release of members of his family. Jayapala felt the defeat to be a great humiliation, and later he built himself a funeral pyre, lit it, and threw himself into the fire. This was probably the first account of Jauhar.\n\nAccording to Farrukhi, among the prisioners were two wives and two daughters of the Shahi ruler. Mahmud returned to Ghazni from Nandana with so many slaves that the capital looked like a city of India. Hindu slaves became so cheap that even local porters (hammal), sweepers (kannas), camel drivers (jammat) and slave sellers (nakkhas) became masters of the slaves.\n\n**Multan 1005-1010 CE** \n\nMahmud of Ghazni led an expedition against Multan\'s Qarmatian ruler Abdul Fateh Daud. The city was surrendered, and Fateh Daud was permitted to retain control over the city with the condition that he adhere to Sunnism.\n\n In 1007, Mahmud led an expedition to Multan against his former minister and Hindu convert, Niwasa Khan, who had renounced Islam and attempted to establish control of the region in collusion with Abdul Fateh Daud of Multan. \n\nIn 1010, Mahmud led a punitive expedition against Daud to depose and imprison him and suppressed Ismailism in favour of the Sunni creed. He destroyed the Ismaili congregational mosque that had been built above the ruins of the Multan Sun Temple, and restored the city\'s old Sunni congregational mosque.\n\n**Kangra 1009 CE**\n\nAfter his victory, Mahmud returned to Ghazni with such a vast collection of riches and jewels which “far exceeded the treasures of the mightiest king of the world.” The riches of the Nagarkot temple attracted the attention of Mahmud of Ghazni, who defeated the Hindu princes at Peshawar, seized the fort of Kangra and plundered the shrine of an immense booty in gold, silver and jewels. From this time, Kangra does not reappear in general history till 1360, when the emperor Firoz Tughlak again led a force against it. The Raja gave in his submission, and was permitted to retain his dominions; but the Muhammadans once more plundered the temple. \n\n**Thanesar 1011-1014 CE**\n\nThanesar was sacked and many of its temples were destroyed by Mahmud of Ghazni. Firishta records that-\n\n&gt;The city of Taneshar is highly venerated by Hindus. The idol of that place is called Cakrasvamin, i.e. the owner of the cakra, a weapon which we have already described. It is of bronze, and is nearly the size of a man. It is now lying in the hippodrome in Ghazna, together with the Lord of Somnath, which is a representation of the Mahadeva, called Linga. In the year A.H. 402 (A.D. 1011) Mehmood Gazini resolved on the conquest of Thanesur, the most sacred Hindu place, in the kingdom of Hindoostan. It had reached the ears of the King that Thanesar was held in the same veneration by idolaters, as Mecca by the faithful; that they had there set up a number of idols, the principal of which they called Jugsoma, pretending that it had existed ever since the creation. Mahmood having reached Punjab, required, according to the subsisting treaty with the Hindu Shahi king Anandpal, that his army should not be molested on its march through his country. An embassy was accordingly sent to inform the Raja of his intentions, and desiring him to send safety guards into his towns and villages, which he would take care to be protected from the followers of his camp. Anandpal the Shahi king, agreeing to this proposal, prepared an entertainment for the reception of the King, at the same time issuing orders for all his subjects to supply the camp with every necessity of life.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Raja\'s brother, with 2,000 horses was also sent to meet the army and to deliver the following message:   \n&gt;  \n&gt;"My brother is the subject and tributary of the King of Gazni, but he begs permission to acquaint his Majesty, that Thanesar is the principal place of worship of the inhabitants of the country: that if it is required by the religion of Mahmood to subvert the religion of others, he has already acquitted himself of that duty, in the destruction of the temple of Nagrakote. But if he should be pleased to alter his resolution regarding Thanesar, Anandpal Tuar promises that the amount of the revenues of that country shall be annually paid to Mahmood, that a sum shall also be paid to reimburse him for the expense of his expedition, besides which, on his own part, he will present him with fifty elephants, and jewels to a considerable amount."  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mahmood replied, "The religion of the faithful inculcates the following tenet: "That in proportion as the tenets of the Prophet are diffused, and his followers exert themselves in the subversion of idolatry, so shall be their reward in heaven;\' that, therefore, it behooved him, with the assistance of God, to root out the "worship of idols" from the face of all India. "How then should he spare Thanesar?"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This answer was communicated to Raja Anandpal Tuar of Delhi, who, resolving to oppose Sultan Mahmood, sent messengers throughout Hindoostan to acquaint the other rajas that Mahmood, without provocation, was marching with a vast army to destroy Thanesar, now under his immediate protection. He observed, that if a barrier was not expeditiously raised against this roaring torrent, the country of Hindoostan would be soon overwhelmed, and that it behooved them to unite their forces at Thanesar, to avert the impending calamity.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mahmood, having reached Thanesar before the Hindus, had time to take measures for its defence; the city was plundered, the idols broken, and the idol Jugsoma was sent to Ghazni to be trodden underfoot. According to Hajy Mahommed Kandahary, a ruby was found in one of the temples weighing 450 miskals. It was allowed by everyone who saw it to be a wonder that had never been heard of. About the attack on Thanesar, Utbi wrote "The blood of the infidels flowed so copiously that the stream was discoloured, notwithstanding its purity, and people were unable to drink it."  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mahmood, after the capture of Thanesar, was desirous of proceeding to Delhi. But his nobles told him that it would be impossible to keep possession of it, till he had rendered Multan a province of his own government and secured himself from all apprehension of Anundpal, the Hindushahi Raja of Lahore. The king resolved, therefore, for the present, to proceed no further, till he had accomplished these objects. Anundpal Shahi, however, conducted himself with so much policy and hospitality towards Mahmood, that he returned peaceably to Ghazni. On this occasion, the Mahmood\'s army brought to Ghazni 200,000 captives, and much wealth, so that the capital appeared like an Indian city, no soldier of the camp being without wealth, or without many slaves.\n\n**Mathura 1018 CE**\n\nThe city was sacked and many of its temples destroyed by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1018 CE. The capture of Mathura by Maḥmūd Ibn Sebüktegīn is described by the historian al-Utbi (Abu Nasr Muhammad ibn Muhammad al Jabbaru-l \'Utbi) in his work Tarikh Yamini as follows:-\n\n&gt;The wall of the city was constructed of hard stone, and two gates opened upon the river flowing under the city, which were erected upon strong and lofty foundations, to protect them against the floods of the river and rains. On both sides of the city there were a thousand houses, to which idol temples were attached, all strengthened from top to bottom by rivets of iron, and all made of masonry work ; and opposite to them were other buildings, supported on broad wooden pillars, to give them strength.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the middle of the city there was a temple larger and firmer than the rest, which can neither be described nor painted. The Sultan thus wrote respecting it :— “ If any should wish to construct a building equal to this, he would not be able to do it without expending an hundred thousand thousand red dinars, and it would occupy two hundred years, even though the most experienced and able workmen were employed.” Among the idols there were five made of red gold, each five yards high, fixed in the air without support. In the eyes of one of these idols there were two rubies, of such value, that if any one were to sell such as are like them, he would obtain fifty thousand dinars. On another, there was a sapphire purer than water, and more sparkling than crystal; the weight was four hundred and fifty miskals. The two feet of another idol weighed four thousand four hundred miskals, and the entire quantity of gold yielded by the bodies of these idols, was ninety-eight thousand three hundred miskals. The idols of silver amounted to two hundred, but they could not be weighed without breaking them to pieces and putting them into scales. The Sultan gave orders that all the temples should be burnt with naphtha and fire, and levelled with the ground.\n\n**Kannauj 1021 CE**\n\nHe marched to Kannauj next where he robbed and burnt down 10,000 temples in and around Kannauj.  He captured 53,000 prisoners and brought them to Ghazni where they were sold, fetching a price of 2 to 10 dirhams per slave.\n\n**Somnath 1025 CE**\n\nThe most famous and terrible invasion launched by Mahmud was his sixteenth, against the Somnath Temple in Gujrat, western India. This was an immense distance from Ghanzni, but one supposes by now he was so feared that he had easy passage. The Somnath temple was very famous for its treasures. There were one thousand priests to serve the temple. Hundreds of dancers and singers played before its gate. There was famous Linga, a rude pillar stone, adorned with gems embroidered with precious like stars, which decorated the shrine. The brave Hindu Rajputs came forward to defend the temple. Shouting \'Allah hu Akbar\', the enemy tried to entered into the temple. The Hindus fought very bravely and the invaders could not damage the temple. The battle lasted for three days. After three days, the invaders succeeded and entered into the Somnath temple.  He brutally killed more than 50,000 thousands people who formed a human chain to save the temple. Mahmud and his men smashed the main Linga into pieces, some of the fragments of which were turned into the steps of the city’s Jama Masjid mosque where the faithful could defile it by walking on it.  Other fragments were sent to Mecca, Medina, and Baghdad for the same purpose. He looted the treasures of the temple. It is said that he got wealth worth 20-million Dinars, eighty times the already huge sum he had gained on his first invasion.\n\n**Attack on the Jats 1027 CE**\n\nChristoph Baumer notes that-\n\n&gt;In 1026 CE, Jats "inflicted heavy losses" on the army of Mahmud while it was on its way from Somnath to Multan. Later in 1027 CE, he avenged the attack by Jats, who had also been impervious to "forced Islamisation" for the last three centuries, by ravaging the fleet of Jats in the Indus river. Even though Jats had a bigger fleet than Mahmud, he is said to have around 20 archers on each of his 1400 boats, who were stocked with "special projectiles" carrying naphtha, and Jats\' fleet was blazed by them.'<br />Author: 'Cosmo108'  id: 'l1x3bm'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l1x3bm/jihad_diaries_crimes_of_ghazni/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'New Tax Regime or Old Tax Regime – Which one you should pick?'<br />Body: 'The current tax system is complicated to say the least. While the tax rates are high, there are a lot of ways to reduce your tax liability. \n\nFor the FY 2020-2021, finance minister Nirmala Sitraman announced a new tax regime with more tax slabs and lower tax rates.  Also, finance minister gave taxpayers a choice between the new regime and existing one, leaving it to them to decide which they would like to opt for.  \n\nSince we are nearing the end of the FY, it is time to make a decision. If you are wondering how to go about figuring out which regime you should opt for, this post answers that question for you.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Current Tax System – high rates but lot of options to reduce taxes :**\n\nOver the years the government, through addition of clauses to the Income Tax Act, has given Indian taxpayers over 70 exemptions and deduction options through which they can bring down their taxable income and hence pay less. \n\nWhile exemptions are part of your salary, like the House Rent Allowance (HRA) and Leave Travel Allowance (LTA), deductions allow you to lower your tax amount by investing, saving or spending on specific items. The biggest section for deduction is Section 80c through which you can bring down your taxable income by Rs.1.5 lakh.  Apart from this, there are several other sections that let you take tax deductions on things ranging from interest on your loans (home and education) to premiums you pay for health insurance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost common exemptions and deductions availed by Indian taxpayers:\n\n**Exemptions:**\n\n* House Rent Allowance\n* Leave Travel Allowance\n* Mobile and Internet Reimbursement\n* Food Coupons or Vouchers\n* Company Leased Car\n* Standard Deduction\n* Uniform Allowance\n* Leave En-cashment\n\n**Deductions:**\n\n* Employee Provident Fund\n* Public Provident Fund\n* Voluntary Provident Fund\n* ELSS (Equity Linked Saving Scheme)\n* Life Insurance Premium\n* Principal and Interest component of Home Loan\n* Children Tuition Fees\n* Health Insurance Premiums\n* Investment in NPS\n* Tuition fee for Children\n* Saving Account Interest (upto 10K)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe combination of exemptions and deductions can bring down your taxable income by lakhs. However, it also means every year you have to find ways to optimize your salary and savings/investments so as to keep you taxable income to the minimum. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Enter new tax regime – More slabs, lower tax rate but no way to reduce taxes:**\n\nThe new tax regime is different from the existing system in two aspects. \n\nOne, in the new regime, the tax slabs have increased, accompanied by lowering of rates in the sub-Rs 15 lakh range. Two, all the exemptions and deductions that were being used by taxpayers in the existing regime won’t be available in the new regime.\n\nHere is a comparison between the old and new tax slabs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Tax Slab(₹)\t|Old Tax Rates|New Tax Rates|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|0 – 2,50,000\t|0%|0%|\n|2,50,000 – 5,00,000|5%|5%|\n|5,00,000 – 7,50,000|20%|10%|\n|7,50,000 – 10,00,000|20%|15%|\n|10,00,000 – 12,50,000|30%|20%|\n|12,50,000 – 15,00,000|30%|25%|\n|15,00,000 &amp; above|30%|30%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n As you can see under the new system, income between Rs 5 lakh and 7.5 lakh would be taxed at 10 percent, while income between Rs 7.5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh would be taxed at 15 percent. This was 20 percent flat on the entire range for the existing regime. The earlier Rs 10 lakh+ slab where you paid 30 percent, has been broken into three parts with rates of 20 percent for Rs 10-12.5 lakh, 25 percent for Rs 12.5 lakh-15 lakh and then 30 percent for Rs 15 lakh and above.\xa0 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So, which regime should one pick?**\n\n Unfortunately, there is no single answer to this. While figuring out what option to go for might look complicated, if you approach it in a systematic way, it is not that difficult to figure out.\xa0 \n\nHere is what you need to do –\n\n* **Calculate all the exemptions that you are availing:** If you are living on rent, you would be claiming HRA which is the biggest salary exemption one enjoys. Apart from that, other tax-free components include LTA, Food Bill, Phone Bills, etc. All these will become taxable if you choose to shift to the new tax regime.\n* **Look at the deductions that you claim:** As a salaried employee, two deductions that you automatically get are standard deduction of Rs 50,000 and your contribution towards your Employee Provident Fund (EPF). In the new regime, you won’t be able to claim these deductions even though you will continue to contribute to EPF. Over and above, you cannot claim deductions against your home loan (if you have one) or insurance policies, which till now has helped to reduce your taxable income.\n\nNow, combine these exemptions and deductions and minus them from your salary to see what is your taxable income and what it would be if you let go of these deductions. This should be the deciding factor for which regime you should go for.\n\nYou can use the simple calculator provided by Income Tax Official Website to calculate this yourself.\n\n[https://www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/Tax\\_Calculator/](https://www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/Tax_Calculator/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Final Note:**\n\nIf you are employed, your employer would have already asked for which regime you want to follow to deduct TDS accordingly. But you can change it during your final ITR filing in june/july if needed. But it would be better if you plan on it now and in case if it is old regime, you can invest on additional tax saving instruments as well.\n\n**Caution: The regime you pick shouldn’t decide whether you should invest and get insurance. Achieving your life goals and securing your family’s future should be the reasons not the tax benefits you get from them.**'<br />Author: 'reddituserhere6'  id: 'l1wocx'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l1wocx/new_tax_regime_or_old_tax_regime_which_one_you/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Repost: Rapes, we need to change the way we think about it.'<br />Body: ' I feel like rapes in India are strongly exaggerated. First of all, I want to make clear what a rape is. A rape, according to me, is an offence when a person tries to have sex with someone else without consent. That\'s it. Yup. Using this definition we conclude that nirbhaya rape was not just a rape, infact it was a rape, then it turned to parasexual desires (the iron rod thing), and finally became a murder, that\'s why nibhaya rape is not only a rape, but a murder too. And that\'s why it\'s very offensive. But normal rapes are just rapes. Just people who have difficulty containing their sexual desires to themselves. And I know that\'s a crime, but like poor thieves, it\'s just a condition. So it can be solved by counselling. We can save people from doing this. Please don\'t be offended and read more. \n\nNow I do feel that it is a crime, but I don\'t think that it is related to women rights in any way. Imagine a situation where you\'re in a party. There\'s a girl who is attracted to you. Now she puts some pills in your drink. Yeah, the average tv show drama, but just suppose this happens. Now she takes you to a room and does stuff without your consent. Now, technically, you\'ve been sexually abused. But the Indian government doesn\'t see this as rape in any way, while the British do. Plus, the girl who raped you can easily put the blame on you, so either you\'re a rapist, or you\'re a no one. \n\nSo this means that rapes are not related to boys having sex with girls, it can be the opposite, it can be a gay rape, or any sexual orientation. The usual BDSM stuff. It\'s not like dowry death, it\'s not a gender crime. A gender crime occurs due to a social benifit one gender has over the other. Having a penis is not a social benifit, it\'s physical structure, you can not cut a penis down. It\'s a crime occuring due to a deficiency. You can\'t stop people being thieves, until everyone has food to eat. I\'m not comparing women to food, but I\'m comparing rapists to normal crimes. And I don\'t think marching and doing satyagraha movements under the India gate is the way to solve this, also I don\'t think feminists have any duty over this. It can only be solved by educating EVERYONE, MEN AND WOMEN, AND OTHER SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS of sexual education. \n\nThe media sure does over rate this. How much of a newspaper page is used for reporting a single rape vs how much of it is used to report a mother leaving her newborn in an isolated place where it dies? What amazes me is that rapes get as much worth as an terrorist attack. Just question yourself, think about "a school bus fell down a hill this morning" vs "a group of men was attacked this morning" vs " another \'abla naari\' was raped today. How much longer should women endure this pain?"\n\nAlso, I hate the way men are shown in Bollywood films. There are only 2 kinds of men in movies. One kind is the one who are in their 20s and do all the bad stuff, the other type - the hero - is also a gangster, but saves "abla naari" from rapes and stuff. While the girl is an educated lady who\'s striving to win hearts. How can these movies be so offensive? Why does nobody talks about it? You call that women empowerment? Why does all romances revolve around some bad guys trying to rape the heroine? Are men like that? No! I can see all men have ever done in movies is raping women. This is amazing. A movie is controversial if it shows religious offense, drug abuse, child harrassment, but not every third tv show episode showing somehow someone being abused. \n\nFinally, I want to make a strange point. Imaging a movie: a girl is sexually abused by a man, in the whole movie the girl tries to file a case on that man, but is unable because the man is rich. Her mother dies. So in the climax scene, she kills the man on a crowdy street, she stabs the man 7 times, the crowd sees that the man is an assaulter, so they clap for the bravery of the woman, victory music plays in the background. She is arrested but is proud. \n\nNow imagine another one, it goes like this: \n\nA man is accused of raping a woman he doesn\'t know. His career is destroyed, his parents leave his on the road. He is depressed. So in the end, he sees the woman who accused him of rape, he forces her on the crowded street, he rapes the woman (rapes, not murders), the crowd sees him as wrongly accused, they clap. Victory music plays. He\'s arrested but proud. \n\nWhich one looked strange? \n\nI JUST WAS SAYING MY OPINION ON THIS SUBJECT. IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, PLEASE COMMENT. I MIGHT BE WRONG ABOUT EVERYTHING. BUT I FEEL THAT I\'VE DONE MY ROLE AS AN INDIVIDUAL FOR MY COUNTRY BY STATING MY FACTS. IF YOU THINK I MADE A POINT. PLEASE SPREAD THIS MESSAGE. THANK YOU.\n\nOther comments: \n\nReplying to everyone: \n(the previous title for this post was "rapes are overrated")\n\nI don\'t think there was a better way to say it all. I was not making points but was giving opinions about everything I\'ve heard when people talk about rapes. \nI kind of feel offended by slogans that say "real men don\'t rape, they masturbate", yeah like that\'s all we do. I just wanted to make sure if people thought the same. \nAnd the overrated word, I can see that it seems offensive. Yes. But I think there are 2 ways somebody can argue about society. They are: morally and logically. If I had put my argument in a more moral way, I think I wouldn\'t have been able to put the better parts of my argument. \n\nLet me give you an example. For the satyagraha part in my text, I wanted to make this point:\n\n"If loads of money from a bank would have been stolen, bankers won\'t have been marching and appealing for justice by sitting under the India gate." \n\nBut I thought by making this point people would say that I\'m comparing a women with a bank locker. Like those politicians who said that to avoid getting raped one must wear more clothes. That\'d have been wrong. I\'m not asking women to be traditionally dressed. I\'m against tradition, that\'s the reason all of this is happening. \n\nAnd that\'s why I went more insensitive. I don\'t think there\'s some special "woman" dignity. I feel like it\'s just another way of differenciating between the two genders. To be treated equally, both of them should be thought as equal. There\'s a kind of "untouchability" between men and women. I think we all would agree that\'s one of the main reasons why women are not allowed to do jobs, or join the army. \n\nYes and also I see many of you see that I\'ve made a lot of points about media and movies. It\'s because I hate them the most. Most of my article covers media. But I also am trying to point out how people think about rapes. Like women are the only target. \n\n"don\'t go into the dark streets, God knows what kind of men are roaming there."  \n\nIf I, as a men, would cross the street, there\'s an equal chance for me to encounter some looter or murderer. Even if I leave alone what I said about there being female rapists. \n\nOther people have said that they don\'t understand some points, please tell me what they didn\'t understand, maybe I can clarify. Otherwise I initially thought I\'ve made crystal clear points that most would agree upon.\n\nReplying to @depressedlonely69 \n\nRape is a very hateful crime, so should be obvious that it will result in a violent outcome like murder. But that doesn\'t mean the murder is justified. And certainly cheering for it is not.\n\nI get what you\'re saying but that\'s not the point. I wanted to argue that rapes are somehow considered more offensive than murder. Like this women does gets arrested. But this kind of plot would have been okay for an Indian movie. Whereas the other one with the man raping  the woman won\'t have been. All crimes can be shown as being done for good. Murdering, thieving, drug abuse. Not rapes though, or some exceptions like child abuse, etc. I was just pointing idiocracy of movies.'<br />Author: 'blabbering_baboon'  id: 'l1uubv'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l1uubv/repost_rapes_we_need_to_change_the_way_we_think/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'I feel like rapes are overrated.'<br />Body: 'I feel like rapes in India are overrated. First of all, I want to make clear what a rape is. A rape, according to me, is an offence when a person tries to have sex with someone else without consent. That\'s it. Yup. Using this definition we conclude that nirbhaya rape was not just a rape, infact it was a rape, then it turned to parasexual desires (the iron rod thing), and finally became a murder, that\'s why nibhaya rape is not only a rape, but a murder too. And that\'s why it\'s very offensive. But normal rapes are just rapes. Just people who have difficulty containing their sexual desires to themselves. And I know that\'s a crime, but like poor thieves, it\'s just a condition. So it can be solved by counselling. We can save people from doing this. Please don\'t be offended and read more. \n\nNow I do feel that it is a crime, but I don\'t think that it is related to women rights in any way. Imagine a situation where you\'re in a party. There\'s a girl who is attracted to you. Now she puts some pills in your drink. Yeah, the average tv show drama, but just suppose this happens. Now she takes you to a room and does stuff without your consent. Now, technically, you\'ve been sexually abused. But the Indian government doesn\'t see this as rape in any way, while the British do. Plus, the girl who raped you can easily put the blame on you, so either you\'re a rapist, or you\'re a no one. \n\nSo this means that rapes are not related to boys having sex with girls, it can be the opposite, it can be a gay rape, or any sexual orientation. The usual BDSM stuff. It\'s not like dowry death, it\'s not a gender crime. A gender crime occurs due to a social benifit one gender has over the other. Having a penis is not a social benifit, it\'s physical structure, you can not cut a penis down. It\'s a crime occuring due to a deficiency. You can\'t stop people being thieves, until everyone has food to eat. I\'m not comparing women to food, but I\'m comparing rapists to normal crimes. And I don\'t think marching and doing satyagraha movements under the India gate is the way to solve this, also I don\'t think feminists have any duty over this. It can only be solved by educating EVERYONE, MEN AND WOMEN, AND OTHER SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS of sexual education. \n\nThe media sure does over rate this. How much of a newspaper page is used for reporting a single rape vs how much of it is used to report a mother leaving her newborn in an isolated place where it dies? What amazes me is that rapes get as much worth as an terrorist attack. Just question yourself, think about "a school bus fell down a hill this morning" vs "a group of men was attacked this morning" vs " another \'abla naari\' was raped today. How much longer should women endure this pain?"\n\nAlso, I hate the way men are shown in Bollywood films. There are only 2 kinds of men in movies. One kind is the one who are in their 20s and do all the bad stuff, the other type - the hero - is also a gangster, but saves "abla naari" from rapes and stuff. While the girl is an educated lady who\'s striving to win hearts. How can these movies be so offensive? Why does nobody talks about it? You call that women empowerment? Why does all romances revolve around some bad guys trying to rape the heroine? Are men like that? No! I can see all men have ever done in movies is raping women. This is amazing. A movie is controversial if it shows religious offense, drug abuse, child harrassment, but not every third tv show episode showing somehow someone being abused. \n\nFinally, I want to make a strange point. Imaging a movie: a girl is sexually abused by a man, in the whole movie the girl tries to file a case on that man, but is unable because the man is rich. Her mother dies. So in the climax scene, she kills the man on a crowdy street, she stabs the man 7 times, the crowd sees that the man is an assaulter, so they clap for the bravery of the woman, victory music plays in the background. She is arrested but is proud. \n\nNow imagine another one, it goes like this: \n\nA man is accused of raping a woman he doesn\'t know. His career is destroyed, his parents leave his on the road. He is depressed. So in the end, he sees the woman who accused him of rape, he forces her on the crowded street, he rapes the woman (rapes, not murders), the crowd sees him as wrongly accused, they clap. Victory music plays. He\'s arrested but proud. \n\nWhich one looked strange? \n\nI JUST WAS SAYING MY OPINION ON THIS SUBJECT. IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, PLEASE COMMENT. I MIGHT BE WRONG ABOUT EVERYTHING. BUT I FEEL THAT I\'VE DONE MY ROLE AS AN INDIVIDUAL FOR MY COUNTRY BY STATING MY FACTS. IF YOU THINK I MADE A POINT. PLEASE SPREAD THIS MESSAGE.

      <li>Title::: 'Quran Vs Bhagwad Gita | Fight for Supremacy vs fight for defense'<br />Body: "\nWAR is a fight. Fight for what? Defence or Supremacy? Both Quran and Bhagwad Gita had war themes. But, the definition of enemy has been different in both the pretext. Who is an enemy? One who attacks you, or one who differs in opinion with you? Two war scenes, that gave rise to two different ideologies for two popular holy books of two major religions of the World. Observations are interesting!\n\nSCENE 1\n\nA War scene! 5,000 years back! THE WAR OF KURUKSHETRA! The war between the Good and the Evil. The conflict that arose from a dynastic succession struggle between two groups of cousins, the Kauravas and Pandavas, for the throne of Hastinapura. Hence, the war! An 18 days event that established the faith in fight for defence to protect the truth &amp; the right! First day of the war, army from both sides took positions, The war leaders tightened their muscles &amp; jaws in full command of the fight, Bows awaited to throw the arrows piercing throw the air to rip the rival, the resonance of conch shells blew filling the air with the war cry! Sri Krishna, the mediator of the royal families, graced the position of charioteer for the warrior prince Arjuna, the premium archer of the era of Mahabharata! Panchajanya - the conch shell of Sri Krishna blew, to mark the beginning of one of the titanic fight ever! The evil enemy Kauravas in front, Prince Arjuna was to throw the first arrow towards the enemy. The lifelong archery lessons and skills of war from one of the finest warrior of history, was to unleash. Krishna, the quintessential politician &amp; strategist of all time, glanced at Arjuna with determination to make winning inevitable. But to the utter surprise of the charioteer, Arjuna rested his weapons aside, postured in a kneel down position with palms joined in remorse, with tears flowing through the cheeks of the well formed graceful face, taking refusal to fight against his cousins, denying the bloodshed of his very own. THE MOST IMPORTANT moment of the war, that considered much bigger than the war itself, was the birth moment of The holy book of Hindus, The Bhagwad Gita. An excerpt of the conversation that may put an insight to the ideology of the Hinduism. An appeal to fight for Defense &amp; Duty, By Krishna to Arjuna, the ideology of Hinduism.\n\nArjun: “How can we be happy by slaying our own friends, relatives or even the noble elders. Because even after killing them, we will only enjoy the blood stained pleasures in the form of wealth and sense-enjoyments.”\n\nKrishna: “O Arjun, if you refuse to fight this righteous war, an opportunity to defend the right from the wrong, and shy away from your innate duty, you will lose your reputation as a warrior and thus you will definitely incur sin.”\n\nThe main morale of the Bhagwan Gita in just two of many verses of the conversation, practiced by Hindus is benign in its nature. The proof being, India has NEVER invaded other nations. The Indian Army has been there for protecting the nation, but never to attack. A bright example of how the Holy book influences the culture and ideology of the land, FIGHT FOR DEFENSE!\n\nSCENE 2\n\nA WAR scene in Arabia. 1400 years back! The founder of Islam had fled Mecca to seek refuge in Medina. The Muslims have been causing nuisance to the Quraysh of Mecca by raiding the merchant caravans. THE BATTLE OF THE TRENCH, as they named it, was a battle between the Prophet Muhammad and the Quraysh of Mecca. In the year 627 A.D. Muslims dug a trench around the exposed Northern and Western parts of the city to stop the Meccan army advance. The Jewish tribe Qurayzas were on the eastern outskirts of Medina. The Jews decided to stay neutral in this conflict which proved fatal for them. Had they helped the Meccans, Muslims would have been defeated. Meccans abandoned the siege. Afterwards, the prophet decided that neutrality was actually breach of a five years old contract with the Jews.  Result: All the men were bound with rope. Trenches dug and all the captives beheaded in batches. Imagine, small groups of 800 helpless Jews, who had done no harm to anyone, were brought out and forced to kneel, staring down at the bodies of others before their own heads were lopped off and their bodies pushed down into the ditch. Boys who had some pubic hair growth were beheaded as well and the women who denied to surrender!. There was a fresh supply of widows for servitude. The imagery of the event is sure to run the blood cold.\n\nIn the violent verses, the imagery is very graphic. The Quran contains at least 109 verses that speak of war with non-believers, usually on the basis of their status as non-Muslims. Some are quite graphic, with commands to chop off heads and fingers and kill infidels wherever they may be hiding. Muslims who do not join the fight are called hypocrites' and warned that Allah will send them to Hell if they do not join the slaughter.\n\nThe fate of the Qurayza is only the first of many such massacres that the Religion of Peace has provided the world.  Whether it be the 4,000 Jews at Granada in 1066, the 100,000 Hindus on a single day in 1399, or the millions of Christian Armenians in the early 1900's, untold tens of millions of innocents have perished in mass executions at the hands of Islam. The followers of the messenger of peace  live by the example personally set by their prophet. Hence the ideology of Quran, FIGHT FOR SUPREMACY &amp; POWER, continues to be the core teaching to millions across the world.\n\nA reform is a must, if it may ever! The bloodshed, anti-life principles, extremism &amp; fundamentalism has given rise to ISLAMIST ideologies. To save the world &amp; mankind from the grip of death in future, the Islamic ones must stand up NOW to against the Islamist ones. Let there be love, let there be peace. Time has passed, many lay themselves to death in the hands of hatred.

      <li>Title::: 'Analsis of Farm Laws, APMC and MSP from different Perspectives'<br />Body: " I will skip long names of new laws and full forms of APMC and MSP since I assume everyone has got familiar with them now. Let's get directly to the points.\n\n**From the perspective of a farmer**\n\nIf you are a farmer who has been growing wheat and paddy and selling it to APMCs, then new laws will cause you some inconvenience in the long run. Still, they will bring more opportunities in the long run if you can shift your farming from wheat and paddy to commercial corps, which is the primary intent behind these laws. \n\nMSP is the reason farmers stick to wheat and paddy. These corps are their comfort zone. They are growing them for generations now, and they have full insurance of their sell through MSP. These farm laws will surely kill APMCs and MSP, but in the long run, the govt already said that they are not going to shut APMCs. But let's not kid ourselves; the laws are intended to replace the APMC system. If these farmers can go outside their comfort zone and get into commercial corps or FMCG collaborations in the next decade, they can earn much more than they are making now. The logic is, wheat and paddy are very basic corps. Every nation ensures that they are self-dependent in these corps, so international prices for these corps are already lower than Indian markets. Unless farmers move to commercial corps, their income can not be increased.\n\n**From the perspective of a Consumer**\n\nWhen a farmer is growing corps with MSP in mind, the best strategy for them would be to produce as much quantity as possible because at the end of the day govt will have to buy it no matter what the quality is. It leads to poor quality crops as loads of chemical fertilizers and pesticides are used for higher yields. Often the products are not fit for human consumption. In fact Agri products from APMCs can not be exported.\n\n[High pesticide content a drag on rice exports : The Tribune India](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/haryanatribune/high-pesticide-content-a-drag-on-rice-exports-791510)\n\n## [Excessive use of pesticides hurting basmati exports (dailypioneer.com)](https://www.dailypioneer.com/2018/state-editions/excessive-use-of-pesticides-hurting-basmati-exports.html)\n\nThese pesticides are one of the biggest reason Punjab is called Cancer capital of India. Water and land is contaminated due to excessive of pesticides for MSP model farming.\n\nThe wheat that most middle-class people eat(for example, Aashirvaad atta) does not come from APMCs. \n\n**From the perspective of an Exporter/Businessman/MNC/entrepreneur** \n\nExporters have to satisfy the EU and US's quality norms, which means they have to ask farmers to grow specific varieties in a particular way, which is only possible by contact farming. Many pesticides are banned in the EU and the US, used by Indian farmers to get higher yields. Since farmers are getting fixed prices in the MSP model, there is no incentive to produce higher quality rice and wheat. With APMC as middle man it's impossible to raise exports of Agri products.\n\n[Rice exporters seek ban on pesticides unregistered in the US, EU - The Economic Times (indiatimes.com)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/rice-exporters-seek-ban-on-pesticides-unregistered-in-the-us-eu/articleshow/72904581.cms?from=mdr)\n\n[Basmati Rice &amp; Pesticides: Where does the fault lie? - India Business &amp; Trade, an initiative of Trade Promotion Council of India (tpci.in)](https://www.tpci.in/indiabusinesstrade/blogs/basmati-rice-pesticides-where-does-the-fault-lie/)\n\nSimilarly, if you are an MNC or FMCG company, you would only invest in Agri Research if your IP is protected by contract with farmers. McDonald's requires a unique variety of long potatoes for their fries, They will only produce it in India if their patent of that variety is protected by contract. \n\nIf you are an agro entrepreneur, you can manage your inventory and forecast if you already have a contract. \n\n**From the perspective of Govt/Macro Economics**\n\nGovt is expecting huge relief as they have to give loads of subsidies to farmers. \n\nDr Ashok Gulati calculates that every farm household in Punjab and Haryana gets about Rs 1.2 lakh in subsidies per year. \n\nSimilarly, govt has to buy all of this low-quality excess grain. \n\nFood Corporation of India (FCI) is saddled with huge stocks of grains — it touched 97 MMT in June this year against a buffer stock norm of 41.2 MMT. The economic cost of that excess grain, beyond the buffer stock norm, was more than Rs 1,80,000 crore, a dead capital locked in without much purpose. That’s the situation of the current grain management system based on MSP and open ended procurement.\n\nSource \n\n[Punjab needs a package to help it diversify output, overcome MSP trap | The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/punjab-farmers-protests-farm-laws-7094357/)\n\nPlease note that the grain procured through MSP can not be exported due to thier low quality and pesticides. So this grain usually rots or sold at a very low price.\n\nAs the contract farming will gain track, exports will rise. MNC will establish their plant as Agri products are raw materials for FMCGs. These companies will invest in research and better equipment for their farmers.\n\n**From the perspective of the Environment:**\n\nI have already discussed that how MSP led farming is pushing farmers to chemical and pesticides. But that is not it. Due to rice farming in Punjab and Haryana, groundwater is depleting. Farmers are a strong lobby in Punjab, so they get free electricity without any restrictions on groundwater uses. They have also forced govt to give them subsidies on Chemical and Pesticides, banned in the EU and US. So farmers in Punjab use their free electricity and subsidized pesticides to fuck the shit out of groundwater and soil.\n\n[MSP, subsidies are at root of Punjab's farm crises but its farmers are fighting to keep them (theprint.in)](https://theprint.in/india/punjab-farmers-want-status-quo-on-msp-subsidies-at-the-root-of-agrarian-crisis/580135/)\n\nThey have also lobbied to stop fines on stubble burning. \n\n[Farmers' Protest : Centre Agrees To Remove Stubble Burning Fine, Withdraw Draft Electricity Amendment Bill; Next Meeting On January 4 (moneycontrol.com)](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/farmers-protest-centre-agrees-to-remove-stubble-burning-fine-withdraw-draft-electricity-bill-next-meeting-on-january-4-6286581.html)\n\nMy perspective with some economic analysis: \n\nI have a simple point. A mixed economy where supply is controlled by govt and exports and industries are owned by private players will never work. It has not worked so far, and we all have seen it. The reason is very simple; there will be inelasticity in the demand-supply curve. If you sell through APMC, you will never know what is the true value that you can produce with your land. Similarly, exporters and suppliers will never get what they want to satisfy the demand. The best bet is either go full commie and nationalize everything or let the free market decide. \n\nSecond, farming is a business of scale. If you have a bigger farm, you can diversify your corps, rent big machines include husbandry fishery in your farm, reducing your overall cost and risk. If you are a small farmer, you are doomed to fail as you can never diversify, and your cost per unit of production will be higher. It's go big or go home situation. Our governments try to keep small farmers in business by waiving loans, giving subsidies, and MSP. These all measures keep them in a vicious cycle which can never end. If govt can use this money in the manufacturing sector and shift these small farmers to factories, it will save their next generation."<br />Author: 'Devi_Prasad_Mishra'  id: 'l1d6um'<br />Score:64<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l1d6um/analsis_of_farm_laws_apmc_and_msp_from_different/</li>

And after the first Anglo-Burmese war (1824-26), [they annexed Assam](https://www.rediff.com/news/2003/jun/20spec.htm) which then mainly meant the Brahmaputra valley. The difficult hills which surrounded the valley from the north and the south, and which were inhabited by inhospitable if not hostile tribes, were left outside the pale of British administration. For the time being.\n\nBut that changed in the second half of the 19th century. The tea planters began to see the hilly slopes as wide new gardens while the timber companies saw in thick forests a vast reserve of resources waiting to be exploited.\n\nAn uncontrolled commercial penetration into the foot-hills started. It led to trouble with the tribes. To contain such confrontations, the British drew an 'inner line', beyond which the hills lay, and crossing which required a pass or license.\n\nMeanwhile, [Britain and Russia were engaged in the 'Great Game'](https://www.rediff.com/news/2003/jun/20spec.htm) to increase their influence in central Asia. Russia's longing for a colonial empire and access to warm water ports led to its expansion in the south and east. This made the British wary. They wanted to continue the possession of their 'crown jewel,' India, at any cost.\n\nAnd so as soon as the British recognized Tibet as a frontier vis-à-vis Russia, as a board for the 'Great Game,' the then viceroy Lord Curzon (1904) sent a British mission led by Younghusband to Lhasa to stake Britain's claim there. The resulting Lhasa convention bound the Tibetans to refuse entry to any agent or representative of any foreign power other than Britain.\n\nBut in 1907, Britain and Russia entered into a joint undertaking to keep out of Tibet. And to enter into no negotiation with the Tibetans except through the Chinese mediation. Thus Tibet, like Afghanistan, was set up as a buffer state with mutual agreement.\n\nIt's relevant to note here that historically the relationship between China and Tibet has been anything but cordial. They both have vied for dominance over the other throughout history, and at different times, both have been successful.\n\nIn the first decade of 20th century, in the backdrop of above events, China was enjoying 'suzerainty' over Tibet. This meant that Tibet enjoyed autonomy under the overarching supervision of China.\n\nHowever, the Chinese now wanted to consolidate their loosely controlled protectorates into full provinces of the empire. By 1910 they had penetrated deep into Tibet, occupied some of its places and started making plans to construct a road through the tribal belt to Assam.\n\nThe British took note of this development with misgivings. Their commercial interests in Assam could be threatened by the Chinese. This prompted the British to ensure a buffer between the Chinese and British investments in Assam.\n\nThus it was that in 1911, citing Chinese expansion as a cause, the then viceroy Lord Hardinge ordered the establishment of a 'sound strategic boundary'. As a result, the British demarcated an 'outer line' with Tawang tract in the Indian side. This was to be the boundary between British India and China-cum-Tibet.\n\nIn the meantime, the ruling Qing dynasty of China unraveled in 1911.  Taking advantage of the situation, [Tibetans promptly expelled all Chinese troops from Lhasa.](https://www.thoughtco.com/tibet-and-china-history-195217) And the then Dalai Lama issued a proclamation stating that 'We are a small, religious, and independent nation.'\n\nThen in 1914 the British convened a tripartite meeting in Shimla among them, the Tibetans and the Chinese to negotiate and demarcate Chinese control over Tibet and Tibet's boundary with India.\n\nThe British delegation was led by Henry McMahon, the foreign secretary of British India.

The Chinese were to have control on inner Tibet but the outer Tibet under Dalai Lama was to be free of their influence.\n\nChina didn't agree to the arrangements and didn't sign the treaty.

      <li>Title::: 'Jihad- Plunder of Mathura'<br />Body: "**First Wave- Mahmud of Ghazni 1018CE**\n\nTarikh Yamini by  al-Utbi says-\n\n&gt;The wall of the city was constructed of hard stone, and two gates opened upon the river flowing under the city, which were erected upon strong and lofty foundations, to protect them against the floods of the river and rains. On both sides of the city there were a thousand houses, to which idol temples were attached, all strengthened from top to bottom by rivets of iron, and all made of masonry work\xa0; and opposite to them were other buildings, supported on broad wooden pillars, to give them strength.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the middle of the city there was a temple larger and firmer than the rest, which can neither be described nor painted. The Sultan thus wrote respecting it\xa0:— “ If any should wish to construct a building equal to this, he would not be able to do it without expending an hundred thousand thousand red dinars, and it would occupy two hundred years, even though the most experienced and able workmen were employed.” Among the idols there were five made of red gold, each five yards high, fixed in the air without support. In the eyes of one of these idols there were two rubies, of such value, that if any one were to sell such as are like them, he would obtain fifty thousand dinars. On another, there was a sapphire purer than water, and more sparkling than crystal; the weight was four hundred and fifty miskals. The two feet of another idol weighed four thousand four hundred miskals, and the entire quantity of gold yielded by the bodies of these idols, was ninety-eight thousand three hundred miskals. The idols of silver amounted to two hundred, but they could not be weighed without breaking them to pieces and putting them into scales. The Sultan gave orders that all the temples should be burnt with naphtha and fire, and levelled with the ground.\n\n Will Durant in his celebrated book – The Story of Civilization (Chapter 6 volume 1) says –\n\n&gt; Each winter Mahmud descended into India, filled his treasure chest with spoils, and amused his men with full freedom to pillage and kill; each spring he returned to his capital richer than before. At Mathura (on the Jumna) he took from the temple its statues of gold encrusted with precious stones, and emptied its coffers of a vast quantity of gold, silver and jewelry; he expressed his admiration for the architecture of the great shrine, judged that its duplication would cost one hundred million dinars and the labor of two hundred years, and then ordered it to be soaked with naphtha and burnt to the ground.  \n\nThe temple was later rebuilt by the Gahadavalas.\n\n**Second Wave- Mamluk Dynasty**\n\nQutubuddin Aibak demolished the temple and looted all its wealth. Tughlaqs are also believed to have plundered the temple.\n\n**Third Wave- Lodhis**\n\nSikandar Lodhi earned the epithet of 'Butt Shikan', the 'Destroyer of Idols'. Ferishta recorded that Sikandar Lodi was a staunch Muslim, with a passion for vandalizing heathen temples:\n\n&gt;He was firmly attached to the Mahomedan religion, and made a point of destroying all Hindu temples. In the city of Mathura he caused masjids and bazaars to be built opposite the bathing-stairs leading to the river, and ordered that no Hindus should be allowed to bathe there. He forbade the barbers to shave the beards and heads of the inhabitants, in order to prevent the Hindus following their usual practices at such pilgrimages.\n\n In Tarikh-i Daudi, of 'Abdu-lla said of Sikandar Lodi:\n\n&gt;He was so zealous a Musulman that he utterly destroyed divers places of worship of the infidels, and left not a vestige remaining of them. He entirely ruined the shrines of Mathura, the mine of heathenism, and turned their principal Hindu places of worship into caravanserais and colleges. Their stone images were given to the butchers to serve them as meat-weights, and all the Hindus in Mathura were strictly prohibited from shaving their heads and beards, and performing their ablutions. He thus put an end to all the idolatrous rites of the infidels there; and no Hindu, if he wished to have his head or beard shaved, could get a barber to do it. Every city thus conformed as he desired to the customs of Islam.\n\n**Fourth Wave- Mughals**\n\nThe Portuguese, Father Antonio Monserrate (1536 CE-1600 CE), who was on a Jesuit mission at the Mughal Court during the times of Akbar, visited Mathura in 1580-82, and noted that all temples built at sites associated with the deeds of Krishna were in ruins:-\n\n&gt;It (Mathura) used to be a great and well populated city, with splendid buildings and a great circuit of walls. The ruins plainly indicate how imposing its buildings were. For out of these forgotten ruins are dug up columns and very ancient statues, of skillful and cunning workmanship. Only one Hindu temple is left out of many; for the Musalmans have completely destroyed all except the pyramids. Huge crowds of pilgrims come from all over India to this temple, which is situated on the high bank of the Jomanis (Yamuna)...\n\nThe temple was rebuilt yet again, this time by the Bundela king Bir Singh Deo costing a total of 33 lakh rupees when gold was around rupees 10 per tola.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Next to the Pagods of *Jngrenate* and *Banarous,* the most considerable is that of *Matura,* about eighteen leagues from *Agra,* upon the way to *Dehly.* It is one of the most sumptuous Edifices in all *India,* and the place to which the greatest number of Pilgrims was wont to resort: But now there are very few or none; the Idolaters having insensibly lost the reverence which they had for that Pagod, since the River of *Gemena,* that formerly ran by that Pagod, has chang'd its course, above half a league from it. For it requires so much time to return to the Pagod, after they have wash'd in the River, that they were many times defil'd again before they could reach it. Though this Pagod stand in a bottom, yet you may discover it five or six leagues (6 kos or 20 km) before you come at it, the building being very lofty and magnificent. The Stones are of a red colour, which they fetch from a Quarry near *Agra.* \n\n As had been the trend, in 1669, Aurangzeb issued a general order for the demolition of Hindu schools and temples, in 1670, specifically ordered the destruction of the Keshavadeva temple. Saqi Mustaid Khan recorded:\n\n&gt;On Thursday, 27th January/15 Ramzan (27 January 1670)... the Emperor as the promoter of justice and overthrower of mischief, as a knower of truth and destroyer of oppression as the zephyr of the garden of victory and the reviver of the faith of the Prophet, issued orders for the demolition of the temple situated in Mathura, famous as the Dehra of Kesho Rai. In a short time by the great exertions of his officers, the destruction of this strong foundation of infidelity was accomplished and on its site a lofty mosque was built by the expenditure of a large sum... Praised be the august God of the faith of Islam, that in the auspicious reign of this destroyer of infidelity and turbulence, such a wonderful and seemingly impossible work was successfully accomplished.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On seeing this instance of the strength of the emperor's faith and the grandeur of his devotion to God, the proud Rajas were stifled, and in amazement they stood like images facing the wall. The idols, large and small, set with costly jewels, which had been set up in the temple, were brought to Agra, and buried under the step of the mosque of the Begum Shahib in order to be continously trodden upon. The name of Mathura was changed to Islamabad.\n\nIn 1965, the new temple complex adjacent the mosque was built with the financial help from industrialists containing the Keshavdeva temple, the Garbha Griha temple at the birthplace and the Bhagavata Bhavan."<br />Author: 'Cosmo108'  id: 'l18246'<br />Score:68<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l18246/jihad_plunder_of_mathura/</li>

Yes, India did win. India did win in Australia, India did win it with half their team in bandages, but it's a lot bigger than that. \n\nThe true beauty of sports lies in its mysteries. As humans, we want David to beat Goliath.  It took India almost their entire cricket history, till they finally beat Australia at their home, in 2018. But then the men in Baggy Green were without Smith and Warner. This time the Aussies brought all their arsenal. They pummelled, punched, bowled out India for a shocking 36 in Adelaide. How do you recover mentally, physically, psychologically from that? Oh and your captain is unavailable for the remainder of the series. \n\nAnd that is why this series is probably so much more special for India than any before.\n\nThere is a man who in the Melbourne game was racially abused by a small section of the crowd - Mohammed Siraj. Four years back when he was selected for the IPL, he had only one dream - to never let his father drive an auto again. Last month, while he was still waiting to play is first test in Australia, his father died. Siraj could not go back for the funeral. For the last few months, Siraj has been holding his father's illness, the abuse, the heckling,  the insecurities regarding a youngster's selection all together.  Yesterday he burst and picked five wickets in the second innings setting up the game for India. When he kissed the ground and the tears flowed, we should have known we were up for something special.\n\nThere is a man who has been criticized, heckled, trolled, made fun of in social media, by experts, almost everyone for almost one and a half years now. He scored a brilliant 97 in Melbourne and almost got India to victory. But 'almost' is not remembered in history. Today, he scored an unbeaten 89 and took India to arguably one of their greatest wins. Rishabh Pant.\n\nThere is a man who has been hit on the body a thousand times throughout the series, and when he goes into the shower tonight, there will be bruises, cuts and lumps on his arms, chest, thighs and more. He might not be celebrated half as much as Kohli, Sharma, or even Gill or Pant, but when he does hang up his boots eventually, his contribution to Indian cricket would be right at the top. Cheteshwar Pujara.\n\nThere is a boy who is just 21 years old and probably doesn't realize that it's not okay to hit 91 in the fourth innings in Gabba against the likes of Cummins, Hazelwood and Starc. Sacrilege, Shubhman Gill, sacrilege. Why does youth know no fear. Why is youth so expressive, so uninhibited. \n\nThere is a man who has captained India in the absence of Kohli, showed none of the verbal aggression that the latter does, but is every bit as passionate. He appears calm, but fought his way through a hundred demons, detractors, set up the win in Sydney and marshalled whatever players were left, superbly. Rahane. \n\nThere are two men playing their first test matches and scoring half centuries in the lower half of the Indian batting order and then picking up wickets, as if they were playing school matches, not test cricket. Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur. Who wrote your script, boys.\n\nIt is not just that India won. India did not have 11 of their main players and yet the team fought, soldiered, counter punched,  resisted, took blows, and never gave up. India did not win the series because of beautiful strokes. India won it because of an incredible amount of bloody mindedness in their heads and pluck in their hearts. \n\nWhat Washington, Shardul, Gill, Natarajan have done is give hope to thousands of boys in India today that some day even they can play for India.  Some years back, an eleven year old boy came to Mumbai, lived in a small tent on the roadside, sold tea to survive and played cricket in the gullies. Yesterday he smoked Sreesanth for two sixes right after the bowler bowled a bouncer and gave him a death stare. His name? Yashasvi Jaiswal. He is now 19 years old, was India Under 19s best batsman in the world cup and signed a 2 crore deal with Rajsthan Royals in the IPL. What Siraj, Yashasvi have done is  is give hope to thousands of poor kids that it is possible to dream.\n\nWhat India did today is far more than just a game. It's what sports is all about - fighting, being fair, dreaming, surviving, and inspiring. In true Bollywood style, it took the entire two months, the last session of the last day of the last test match, to deliver a verdict. And even then for most parts of the day, we were never really sure whether India would lose, win or draw the game. All this in a stadium where Australia hasn't lost for 32 years. \n\n For the whole day, I was frantic, nervous, tense, till Pant hit that winning four. Watching him carry the Indian flag around the ground, watching Rahane ruffle his hair and laugh, is what sports is all about no?"<br />Author: 'sevmumra'  id: 'l0tygf'<br />Score:131<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l0tygf/gabba_breached_why_it_is_more_than_just_a_victory/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'The Story of Kashmiri Hindus and the Ethnic Cleansing , 31st Anniversary of Kashmiri Hindu exodus'<br />Body: '#20% of them left the valley due to 1950 land reforms of Sheikh Abdullah and by 1981 the Pandit population amounted to 5 % of the total. In 2016 only 3,445 pandits remained. The world slept when the massacre of the Pandits happened. \n\nThe Kashmiri Pandits (also known as Kashmiri Brahmins) are Kashmiri Hindus and a part of the larger Saraswat Brahmin community. They belong to the Pancha (five) Gauda Brahmana groups from the Kashmir Valley. **They lived in the Kashmir Valley before Muslim influence entered the region** after which large numbers converted to Islam. They are one of the only few remaining Kashmiri Hindu community native to Kashmir.\n\n---\n\n##1950 land reforms - LAND TO TILLER\n\nWhen the land to  tiller law of 1950 came into force, even the daughters of poor peasants  were treated as part of the estate on which the landlords enjoyed  absolute rights. The sweeping land reforms under the Big Landed  Estates Abolition Act passed on July 13, 1950, changed the complexion of  Kashmiri society.\n\n**The Kashmiri Pandits who were close to  tyrannical regime had not got any land outside the Kashmir valley.**\n\nIn  1950 when the constituent assembly of the Jammu Kashmir was  constituted, it had to decide four points including whether compensation  should be given to those landlords who have lost their land through the  land abolition act.\n\n**On November 5, 1951 the then Revenue Minister Mirza  Muhammad Afzal Beg refused to give compensation to landlords.**\n\n##Exodus from Kashmir (1985–1995)\n\nThe Kashmiri Pandits had been a favoured section of the population of  the valley during Dogra rule (1846–1947). 20 per cent of them left the  valley as a consequence of the 1950 land reforms and by 1981 the Pandit population amounted to 5 per cent of the total.\n\nIn the 1990s during the  eruption of militancy, following persecution and threats by radical  Islamists and militants they were forced to flee in greater numbers.\n\n---\n\n**Events of 19 January 1990**\n\n&gt;On that day, mosques issued declarations that the Kashmiri  Pandits were Kafirs and that the males had to leave Kashmir, convert to  Islam or be killed. Those who chose to the first of these were told to  leave their women behind. The Kashmiri Muslims were instructed to  identify Pandit homes so they could be systematically targeted for  conversion or killing\n\nThe exact numbers vary between 600,000 to 800,000 Kashmiri Pandits fleeing Kashmir, some led a life of refugees in the camps of Jammu.\n\n---\n\n##Sheikh Abdullah referred Kashmiri Pandits as “mukhbir\n\nIslamization of Kashmir began during 1980\'s when **Abdullah Government  changed the names of about 2500 villages from their native names to new  Islamic names.** The Sheikh also started delivering communal speeches in  mosques similar to his speeches in 1930\'s. Additionally, he referred Kashmiri Pandits as “mukhbir” or informers of the Indian government.\n\nSheikh\'s son Farooq Abdullah visited POJK and shared stage with JKLF leaders, though Abdullah asserted that he went on behalf of Indira Gandhi  and his father, so that sentiments there could "be known first hand",  few people believed him. There were also allegations that he had allowed  Khalistan terrorist groups to train in Jammu province.\n\nIn February 1986, Gul Shah on his return to Kashmir valley retaliated and incited the Kashmiri Muslims by saying the famous dialogue , this led to the deaths of several Kashmiri Pandits and other Hindus.\n\n***Islam khatrey mein hey***\n\nThis is also the time when the movement ***Nizam-e-Mustafa*** started, Pandits were the first to be targeted and killed since they represented India, the movement gained big support and an Islamic State was on its verge of being established, during this time loot and rape was normal.\n\nOn June 23, 1989, pamphlets were  distributed in Srinagar. It was an  ultimatum to Muslim women, by an  organization that called itself  **Hazb-i-Islami**, to comply with ‘Islamic’ standards within two days or  face ‘action’. ***Pandit women were asked to put a tilak on their foreheads  for identification.***\n\nOn Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi, on October 14, 1989 a massive crowd gathered near the Budshah chowk in the heart of Srinagar, and from there, it marched towards Eidgah to the graveyard that had been renamed the ‘martyr’s graveyard’. The onlookers cheered and showered shireen on the marchers as if to welcome a marriage procession. The crowd was shouting slogans that had shocked most of the Kashmiri Hindus and a few Muslim Nationalists,\n\n\n    Yahan kya chalega, Nizam-e-Mustafa\n    La sharqiya la garbiya, Islamia Islamia\n    Zalzala aaya hai kufr ke maidaan mein,\n    Lo mujahid aa gaye maidaan mein\n\n**English Translation:**\n\n    What will work here? The rule of Mustafa\n    No eastern, no western, only Islamic, only Islamic\n    An earthquake has occurred in the realm of the infidels,\n    The mujahids have come out to fight\n\n\n##Help for Pandits\n\nSome Hindus across India tried to help the Pandits. Bal Thackeray from Maharashtra got seats reserved in engineering colleges for the children of these Pandits. He was one of the first persons to help them after which Punjab also followed suit.\n\n**You will hardly see any mention of the then GOI doing any major works for the Kashmiri Pandits.**\n\n---\n\n##Oregon Legislative Assembly Resolution\n\nIn 2009 Oregon Legislative Assembly  passed a resolution to recognise 14 September 2007, as Martyrs Day to  acknowledge ethnic cleansing and campaigns of terror inflicted on  non-Muslim minorities of Jammu and Kashmir by terrorists seeking to establish an Islamic state.\n\n##Numbers in 2010 808 Pandit families, comprising 3,445 people\n\nIn 2010, the Government of Jammu and Kashmir  noted that 808 Pandit families, comprising 3,445 people, were still  living in the Valley and that financial and other incentives put in  place to encourage others to return there had been unsuccessful. Hindus living in the Kashmir Valley in 1990 only 2,000–3,000 remain there in 2016.\n\nWhat did the world do when this happened forget the world what did the GOI literally nil to nothing, the only one who stood and recongized that there was ethnic cleansing were the people of Oregon by passing a resolution in their Legislative Assembly .\n\nAnd today the world is crying saying there is no internet in Kashmir , people can\'t call their loved ones, people are not able to express their views. Did anyone call for a UNSC meet for the Kashmiri Pandits ? Did the Government of India do anything when the Islamist asked them to put a tilak ont heir heads so they could be identified easily ?\n\nMale Kashmiri Panits were asked to flee leaving behind their women and kids, the whole world including the Indian Govt slept when the ethnic cleansing of the Pandits took place.\n\nThis is exactly what the Nazis did to the Jews , but took close 2-3 decades for someone to do something and get justice to the Kashmiri Pandits.\n\nI hope the current govt of India also does something in spreading this information of how the Kashmiri Pandits were looted , raped and killed and thrown out of their own homes. To show the world what they suffered was nothing less than what the Jews were suffered!\n\n---\n\n##Militancy in 1990s\n\nThey began to leave in much greater numbers in the 1990s during the eruption of militancy, following persecution and threats by radical Islamists and militants. The events of 19 January 1990 were particularly vicious.\n\nOn that day, mosques issued declarations that the Kashmiri Pandits were Kafirs and that the males had to leave Kashmir, convert to Islam or be killed. Those who chose to the first of these were told to leave their women behind.\n\nThe Kashmiri Muslims were instructed to identify Pandit homes so they could be systematically targeted for conversion or killing.\n\n\nAccording to a number of authors, approximately 100,000 of the total Kashmiri Pandit population of 140,000 left the valley during the 1990s. Other authors have suggested a higher figure for the exodus, ranging from the entire population of over 150,000, to 190,000 of a total Pandit population of 200,000, to a number as high as 800,000. The nature of the planned exodus has remain controversial, with the involvement of then Governor Jagmohan in organizing a clandestine exodus been a subject of controversy. Many of the refugee Kashmiri Pandits have been living in abject conditions in refugee camps of Jammu. The government has reported on the terrorist threats to Pandits still living in the Kashmir region.\n\n---\n\n***Source:***\n\n- [***https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiri\\_Pandit***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiri_Pandit)\n\n- [***https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiri\\_Pandit#cite\\_note-exodus-28***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiri_Pandit#cite_note-exodus-28)\n\n- [***https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exodus\\_of\\_Kashmiri\\_Hindus***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exodus_of_Kashmiri_Hindus)\n\n- [***https://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/more/news/from-sheikhs-land-to-tiller-to-azads-raj-tilak/***](https://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/more/news/from-sheikhs-land-to-tiller-to-azads-raj-tilak/)\n\n- [***https://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1953\\_5/37/the\\_kashmir\\_land\\_reforms.pdf***](https://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1953_5/37/the_kashmir_land_reforms.pdf)\n\n- [***https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9ftx2b/14\\_sept\\_1989\\_the\\_day\\_tika\\_lal\\_taploo\\_was\\_shot/***](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9ftx2b/14_sept_1989_the_day_tika_lal_taploo_was_shot/)'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'l0rn7g'<br />Score:161<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/l0rn7g/the_story_of_kashmiri_hindus_and_the_ethnic/</li>

Little do these parents know that even their children's privacy is violated by their parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am an intermediate-level pentester and I have found very serious security issues in the websites of Allen Career Institute and Sri Chaitanya institute.

And all the students' pictures are OPENLY ACCESSIBLE without any authentication credentials and hosted on their domain [officeweb.allen.ac.in](https://officeweb.allen.ac.in). I cannot give the full URL here because someone could misuse the students' images. And guess what, there are pictures of children as young as 11 years since Allen starts batches from Class 6. Wonder what a potential abuser could do with the pictures of these young souls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot only that, but at the time of admission, Allen takes the full details of a student, including Parents' Name, Blood Group and Residential Address. I was also able to easily retrieve all this information of any student given just his/her registration number.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe security measures on their website are so damn pathetic that an amatuer person like me could easily retrieve such sensitive private details of students without any considerable effort.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd about Sri Chaitanya, they even ask the aadhaar number of the student at the time of admission, and their test website [epraghna.com](https://epraghna.com) is so-poorly designed that I managed to reset any student's password with just a custom POST request. Then I was able to view all of his/her details.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese institutes need to be charged and strict legal action should be taken against them in these matters. There is little awareness about privacy laws in this country. These institutes earn so much yet they care nothing about students' privacy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to contact both the institutes by email but none responded.

      <li>Title::: 'The Nyāyasūtra 1: Pramāṇa, or the Sources of Right Knowledge'<br />Body: 'The *Nyāyasūtra* is a book in five parts. The first part states the syllabus of Nyāya - the sixteen essential things a students must learn in order to be considered an epistemologist. It also gives a very simplified and basic explanation of these sixteen things, and other terms and jargon of Nyāya. But it does not go into detail on any of these sixteen topics.\n\nFrom the second part onwards, we see a more detailed study. The second chapter examines the key components of epistemology more deeply. **Epistemology is the study on methods of research, and how we can acquire reliable knowledge, and how we can tell the facts from the lies and errors.** If you are unclear about epistemology, you cannot be sure of any concept clearly. Therefore, the first thing you should learn, according to Maharshi Gautama, is of course, epistemology. Accordingly, the second chapter examines doubt, sources of knowledge, and the application of epistemology to the study of The Vedas, Physics, Language and Medicine.\n\nThe third part of the book is entirely about self-enquiry, and the study of oneself. Now that the methods of study - epistemology - have been well established, it is time to start applying them. This part deals with the nature of Mind, Senses, Knowledge, Desire, Intellect and Memory, and certain pre-requisites for studying them.\n\nThe fourth part deals with metaphysics - with God, Ontology (the study of existence, what exists, and how it came into being), Reincarnation, Release (from the cycle of birth and death), Atoms, Meditation, etc. It ends with a small note on forms of debate and their use.\n\nThe fifth part deals in detail with logical fallacy, abuse of logic (using many educated-sounding words to cover up a fallacious argument), and what makes arguments futile. It discusses their types, and the rules regarding them. It sets up rules of moderation, so that a debate may be had as an argument with an umpire present. It is also a manual for moderating a debate in the most meaningful way possible.\n\nI will begin with the first part of the book. It lays down a basic summary of the propositions of Nyāya - the sixteen components - without much explanation. It states postulates without proof. We will get to a detailed examination of them - and the reasoning behind them - in the second part, eventually.\n\n## Book One: Core Definitions and Postulates\n\nBefore all else, we deal with *Pramāṇa*, or the Means of Acquiring Right Knowledge. The word Pramāṇa is sometimes used in modern Indian languages to mean *evidence*, or *proof*. These are applicable meanings, but do note that the word originally meant *all* the sources, or means, by which the Truth may be acquired. As such, logical conclusions from evidence are also counted as Pramāṇa in the Nyāya system.\n\n## Pramāṇa: The Sources of Right Knowledge\n\nThere are *four* sources of right knowledge. They are:\n\n1. Sensory Perception, or *Pratyaksha* (प्रत्यक्ष)\n2. Logical Inference, or *Anumāna*, (अनुमान)\n3. Comparative Classification, or *Upamāna* (उपमान)\n4. Reliable Testimony, or *Shabda* (शब्द)\n\nThey are defined very clearly in Nyāya. For instance, merely seeing something does not mean that it is worth believing. There are rules for each of these four categories, which determine if a particular instance of perception or classification is valid.\n\nLet me begin with the first of them.\n\n## Pratyaksha Pramāṇa: Sensory Perception\n\nSomething known from the **interaction of your sense organs with the surrounding world** is considered as *Pratyaksha Pramāṇa* (प्रत्यक्ष प्रमाण) if it satisfies the following four conditions:\n\n1. It is **nameless**\n2. It is **definite**\n3. It is **non-erratic**\n\nThese are rather important conditions. Let me state them clearly here.\n\nFirst, it has to be ***nameless***. If you say: "I see a table." - then this is not sensory perception alone. Sure, a combination of edges and colours may have been in front of your eyes, but *the fact that it is a table is not something your eyes can tell you*. That information is something your brain determines, by combining what you see - the combination of lines, edges and colours of different shades - and your pre-existing knowledge of what a table is supposed to look like.\n\nIf a man from the Sentinel Islands - where there live a tribe of people who are naked hunter gatherers - were to be handed an iPhone, they would not know what to call it. However, when they touch and see it (or perhaps smell and taste it) they are perceiving the same thing that you and I touch and see. Perception itself is nameless, we give names to things we perceive. This principle is very important.\n\nFor instance, consider this - I take a glass of water, and then I lift it to my lips to drink. At the last moment, the glass slips and falls from my hand. As it crashes on the ground, water comes flinging out in all directions. Now STOP!\n\nTake a snapshot of the water right in that moment, and what do you have? In that very moment, as the water spills out, it is in a specific shape. When you see it with your eyes, you are definitely perceiving a shape there. But what shape is it? Is the water in a sphere? No! Is it in a cube? No again! It is a highly irregularly shaped body of water, but nevertheless, it is a shape. It has no name, but that is not enough to deny the fact that you saw *some shape* to that body of water.\n\nThe mere inability to name perception does not deny it. This is because perception *has no name* to begin with. This sounds like an odd principle, but it is a really deep one. One of the big challenges of Artificial Intelligence is Image Recognition. Just because the image is composed of shapes does not mean that those shapes are identified by default. Shapes are ultimately defined and named by us, humans. Likewise is it with all things - frogs, rain, bottles, cars, dogs, bricks - everything we named, we named upon comparison with something. The name is not in the perception itself, an the eyes had nothing to do with the naming.\n\nLikewise is it with sound. Just because we heard something does not mean we know what we heard. Just because we smelt something, likewise, does not mean we know what we smelt. We may not know the name of it, but we *do* know that we have perceived *something* with our senses. In that perception itself lies in the mere nameless sense, and there are too many combinations of data our senses can send us to be able to name them all. Name is not a criterion for the validity of sense, rather, the sensory information is what we have *before we allocate the name*.\n\nNow, here is a tricky problem - suppose we see the colour red on some surface. We may say, "I see red." Is this sensory perception? Or does the act of naming it "red" mean we have also added our own idea of colours and their names into it, and given it a name from prior knowledge?\n\nThe Nyāya answer here is simple - how do you know it is red? There are several shades of what we call "red". Ultimately, what we see is a colour, and by comparing it with known colours, we name it "red". What we see is not "red", but *a specific colour* \\- a colour we choose to name *red*.\n\nSometimes we say, "it is not quite like this. This is not the taste I had back then. It tasted nothing like anything I have ever tasted before, or since." when talking about a flavour. In this case, even though we have no name for the taste in question, it is *definitely* a taste, and counts as a Sensory Perception.\n\nI will have to come back to this discussion when we deal with *Upamāna*, or Comparative Classification, the third kind of Source of Right Knowledge.\n\nOn top of being nameless, it has to be ***definite***. Information from sensory perception is not a means to right knowledge if it is not definite. If you see something flicker past your eyes, and you are not sure if you indeed saw something, and turning your head around you see no movement, you can say that you:\n\n1. *Definitely* percieved an indeterminate flicker from the corner of your eyes,\n2. but you *did not* definitely see anything certain or definite there.\n\nLikewise, sometimes we think we felt something, or we heard something, or we saw something, but it is indefinite. Such observations are called *Pratyaksha Ābhās* (प्रत्यक्ष आभास), and they do not count as *pramāṇa*, or as means to right knowledge.\n\nCome to terms with this word - *Ābhās* (आभास). In Sanskrit, it is an adjective that means "indefinite", or "unsure". It is also a noun, and refers to an indefinite sense of something. It is a term that will recurr in the study of Nyāya. The name of logical fallacy is literally *hetu ābhās* (हेतु आभास / हेत्वाभास), meaning "uncertain reasoning" or "indefinite reasoning".\n\nSome forms of perception are indefinite even though they may persist in time, and even though we are pretty sure we perceived something. For instance, in faint moonlight, colours and details of surfaces are difficult to make out. Small objects are not easy to identify in darkness. Sounds emanating from the lips of someone nearby are difficult to make out if there is ample noise in the background. Taste is hard to make out in food that is freezing cold. It is hard to read the writing on an old, damaged, withered or possibly burnt paper. All senses become rusty when you are intoxicated, and therefore all sensory data becomes less reliable and more indefinite.\n\nThese are cases of persistent perception which is, nevertheless, indeterminate. In either case - persistent or not - indeterminate perception is not considered reliable sources of Right Knowledge. But that that ābhās existed - and was perceived - is itself definite, and to the degree that it offers grounds for further reasoning, it is fertile soil for logical buildup.\n\nThe third criterion is that Sensory Perception must be ***non-erratic***. This is by far the hardest criterion to abide by.\n\nThere are certain known sources of error in sensory perception. For instance, mirages in a desert, optical illusions, and other illusions constitute known errors. This criterion means that known errors of perception must be avoided. Erroneous perception caused by known errors of perception - such as colour-blindness, the distortion of perceived brightness at the edges between regions of two colours, the way oranges taste sweet if you taste them after lemons, but sour if you taste them after eating sugar, a variety of substances cause hallucination, and so on - *do not count as reliable sources of Right Knowledge.*\n\nBut how do you tell if your senses are being affected by optical illusions, other sensory error, and in the worst cases, colour-blindness or synesthesia? This is a really good question. It is always hard to tell if you are colour-blind. Also, no one is *born* with the knowledge of sensory illusions. How does one tell when they are being affected by these things?\n\nThe only answer is that we have to responsibly educate ourselves and our fellow human beings about illusions, hallucinations, mirages, and also help out and cooperate to notice things like colour blindness or synesthesia. This is difficult, and we need knowledge to combat this problem, making it one of the biggest challenges in the acquisition of right knowledge from snesory perception.\n\nBefore ending this section, I will leave a small etymological note. The word *pratyaksha* \\- प्रत्यक्ष - comes from a combination (samāsa) of *two* words: the prefix *prati* (प्रति) mean "against" or "opposite to" and the core word *aksha*, meaning "eye". This is the same *aksha* as in *Akshapāda*, the honorary title of Maharshi Gautama. They literally mean "opposite to the eye", or something that is right across from the eyes, on the other end of the room in your direct line-of-sight. It basically means "that which I see".\n\n## Anumāna Pramāṇa: Logical Inference\n\nNow that we are done with direct sensory perception, let us get to the next part, perhaps one of the most important sources of knowledge - Logical Reasoning. If done correctly, it produces brilliant insights, giving us knowledge over that which cannot be seen or that which occured in the past or the future. If done wrong, well, it is the root of many a misapprehension.\n\n*Anumāna* (अनुमान) - or inference - is of three main kinds in Nyāya:\n\n1. Predictive Inference, or *Pūrvava Anumāna* (पूर्वव अनूमान)\n2. Deductive Inference, or *Acchheshava Anumāna* (अच्छेषव अनुमान)\n3. Inference from Common Observation, or *Sāmānyataḥ Dṛshṭānta Anumāna* (सामान्यतः दृष्टान्त अनुमान)\n\n***Predictive Inference*** is when, seeing the cause of something, you infer the occurance of the effect in the time which follows. For Instance, seeing dark grey clouds, feeling slightly moisture-laden cool winds, and seeing strong breezes, you can infer that it is about to rain.\n\n***Deductive Inference*** is when, seeing the effect of something, you can infer the cause of it from logic. For instance, imagine you wake up early in the morning, and it is quite cool, even though it is not winter. The sky is cloudy and it is somewhat breezy. You realize that the sky is slowly clearing. There is a great amount of water on the roads and on the roofs of all the houses. You can here the drains running. From all this, it is logical to infer that it had been raining in the night before.\n\n\\***Observation from Common Observation** is when you infer the existence of something you do not perceive from something you know to be commonly occuring with it. For instance, if you see a great amount of smoke and get a terribly pungent smell to boot coming out of a room, you would logically infer that there is a fire in it. This is because fire and smoke and pungent smell occur together. Pungent smoke rarely occurs without something burning.\n\nNotice how the three kinds of inference have to do with the Future, the Past, and the Present. This concept of dividing knowledge into three times - *traikāla* (त्रैकाल) - is pretty critical to the process of reasoning. While the methods for deducing what happened in the past from the clues in the present, the methods for predicting what is going to happen from the current situation, and the methods of identifying the big picture about the present from sparse clues - they are different, but they are all related.\n\nThere are obvious criteria for correct logical inference. But interestingly, the Sutra does not dwell on them here. Instead, the Sutra dwells on them in a much later section of the first book - in the later chapter. Logical Inference and Reasoning is a method of supreme importance to epistemology and to logic in general, and it is developed in the second section of the first part, and again in the later parts of the Sutra. As such, I will move on to the next source of Right Knowledge now.\n\n## Upamāna Pramāṇa: Comparative Classification\n\nAs I wrote earlier, *pratyaksha* \\- direct sensory perception - is nameless. Yet, we associate words, labels and names with things we perceive. We name oranges oranges, and bananas bananas, and we name the colours, shapes, smells, tastes, and sounds, and so on.\n\nThe ability of humans to name and identify things is remarkable, and it has to do with comparison and classification. The Nyāyasūtra explains that the reason we have concepts of cups, and tables, and chairs, is because we see objects, and then we *compare* them with other known objects inside our head, and only *then* do we name them cups, tables, chairs etc.\n\nMany other philosphers of the time - including many in the Nyāya school - have treated this as idle nitpicking. After all, is not this comparison then just a part of sensory perception, or is this not a type of inference? After all, seeing the shape of a chair, do we not infer from common observation - the observation, specifically, that objects of this shape are called "chair" - that the shape we see in front of us is, in fact, a chair?\n\nMaharshi Gautama has discussed this and other questions about *Upamāna* in the second part of this book. However, I am going to give a brief preview of his reasoning regarding this specific question here.\n\nMaharshi Gautama claims that the distinction between classification and inference is this - in inference, we *do not perceive the thing being infered with our senses*. For instance, upon deducing rains in the past night, we are not seeing the rains in front of our eyes. Upon predicting that it is about to rain, we are not seeing the rain in front of our eyes either. However, when we see water falling in front of our eyes, and upon comparison with the known phenomenon of rain - whose description resides in our memory - we say that it is raining, we are able to *see* the falling water by means of our eyes. We can see the sensory experience which is given the name of rain.\n\nBut there is a deeper significance of this difference in the context of modern neuroscience. For example, comparative classification of what we see is generally performed inside the Visual Cortex of the human brain. This makes it different from other forms of reasoning, which are the result of the intellect, and are carried out in the Frontal Lobe, separately from the Visual Cortex. Similarly, when we make out words in speech, we are comparing patterns of sound with known patterns of sound that constitute the words. But this comparison is not done with the faculty of reasoning. It is done using the "language center" of the brain. We are fundamentally using human faculties which are different from the one of reasoning.\n\nFor instance, upon going to a vegetable seller to purchase vegetables, you may find various vegetables arrayed in front of you. There will be several carrots, cauliflowers, cabbages, beets, onions, tomatoes, ginger roots, potatoes and so on. In merely one sweeping glance, you can make out which is which, and list in your mind the names of these items on sale. Is this done by thorough reasoning, or by a different - and perhaps instinctive - faculty of the human mind?\n\nOne of the great problems of Artificial Intelligence is Image Segmentation, and another is Image Classification. The aim of the first is to identify the various separate *objects* in a digital image. For instance, in a digital photograph of a person riding a bicycle with a tree right behind him from the perspective of the camera, there are three distinct objects, namely - the bicycle, the person and the tree. Here, the input digital image is a sequence of pixels, each of which has three numbers associated with it - one each for red, green and blue intensities. The output is a sequence of pixes, each of which has a label associated with it - 0 for a pixel containing the ground or the sky etc. which is none of the three objects, and 1, 2, or 3 for the three objects in the image. Of course, in One-Hot Keying the labels (1,0,0), (0,1,0) and (0,0,1) may be used instead.\n\nIn the second, the individual objects are to be *recognized*. This is done by providing a sequence of pixels to the computer with the algorithm running in it, and the computer identifies which of the various classes of object - person, bike, tree or house, or so on, these objects belong to.\n\nBoth of these are accomplished by means of Neural Networks. These are algorithms which model Multilayered Perceptrons - successive layers of the same logical operation, known as "perceptron", which is basically a weighed sum of the inputs, followed by a thresholding comparator - an operation which returns +1 in case the input is positive, and -1 if it is negative. (In practice, of course, we use a Sigmoid or a ReLU comparator, but that is beside the point here.) Interestingly, this structure is modelled not after a sequence of branching reasoning, but after *the Visual Cortex of a cat!*\n\nThe only way to make a machine which can identify objects is by reproducing the structure of an existing Visual Cortex, an existing and natural means to achieve this end of separating and identifying objects in sight. Of course, various modifications have been made to the original model - such as the introduction of Convolutional Neural Networks, which use a moving kernel to evaluate the results of each layer of the neural network rather than a dense network, a modification helps in reducing the computational load in Image Recognition; or the UNET, which is used in Image Segmentation. But there is the fact - this separation and identification of objects from sensory perception is largely a feature of *Neural Structure*, rather than some form of logical reasoning. It has evolved on its own, and it is a product of biology rather than a component of logic and reasoning, for the most part.\n\nIn spite of this, most philosophers down the aeons have fought over questions related to *Upamāna* \\- such as the Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle - due to the mystery it provides. One of the practices of Western schools of philosophy is to ask a new student this question: "What is a chair?" This is because the answer is much harder than one could think. Simple definitions of what makes a chair a chair - or what makes a table a table - are often not enough. For instance, if one were to say that a table is a rectangular surface mounted on four tall identical pillars affixed at each of the four vertices, then it (i) excludes all circular tables, (ii) excludes all tables which have one single leg affixed to the center, and so on.\n\nPlato stated that there are "true essences" of every object in the world. There is such a thing as a "perfect table", a pure idea of a table which is manifested in every single table in the world. In his school, the "true essences" were called *Eidos*, and they form a very key component of Western Philosophy.\n\nOn the other hand, there is the view of his rival, the other prominent philosopher of the ancient Greek world - Aristotle. Aristotle said that there is no "perfect table", of which every table is an instance. He claimed that each table is a unique object, and that every individual object is ultimately the result of matter taking on some form. He said that the category to which something belongs, such as chair or table, is just one of its attributes, or a set of its attributes, which make it so.\n\nIn the Nyāya school, though, the categories are understood to be not attributes of the thing in itself, but something existing in the mind of the person. The word *Upamāna* emerges from a combination of two components - उपमान = अप + मान ; The former, *Upa*, is a prefix which means "sub-", and the latter component - *Māna* \\- means *appraisal*, an derives from Sanskrit *mana* (मन) meaning Mind. It is basically a sort of "sub-appraisal".\n\nAn appraisal is when you evaluate something, and a sub-appraisal is a small part of the complete evaluation. Say you see a vegetable with your eyes. You first identify it as a carrot, then use your inference - your knowledge of how much carrots cost per kilo, based on your past experiences of buying them - to say that this much is the price the shopkeeper is likelier to agree upon. The first part, where you identify it as a carrot, is the classification. Only then, when the sub-appraisal is done, do you begin really thinking about the item.\n\n**Indistinct Comparison**\n\nOne last thing to note before I move on to the next topic is *upamāna ābhāsa* (उपमान आभास). If you are perceptive, you will notice the second word here as one I described above when dealing with Sensory Perception. It means "indefinite", or "unclear". Sometimes, when dealing with comparative classification, you are not really sure what category something falls into. For instance, you may not be exactly able to identify a species of flower, or of insect, on sight. But a more common case is in the case of sound, especially human speech. It is often difficult to make out an individual word when we are speaking, because we are not entirely sure which word we heard. A common example is when speaking on telephone, and over a noisy connection. In these situations, the available perceived information is insufficient to let us know which class of object or word the perception belongs to.\n\nThis is different from the case of Indistinct Perception, where we are not sure of what we even perceived to begin with. In Indistinct Comparison, we are pretty sure about what we perceived, but we are not sure, based on our existing knowledge of the categories of things that exist, what kind of thing it is. For instance, upon seeing a bird, we may have no idea which species it belongs to. We might be able to tell that it looks like a multi-coloured parrot or a some such, but we cannot quite tell which it is. Those who are not into cars may be able to see a car, but not know which model of car it is. The perception here is not indistinct - the car is right in front of the person, and it is being clearly and persistently perceived. But the model of the car is not possible to tell from just the information available to the person about different models of cars and their features and recognizable characteristics.\n\nSuch cases indicate that it is possible for the faculty of Comparative Classification to lead to the same sort of faulty indefiniteness as Sensory Perception. This is the case for *upamāna ābhāsa*. In such a situation, the classification cannot be treated as a means to Right Knowledge. For instance, even if the person in the last example is able to identify the item in front of them as a *car*, that is the limit of their right knowledge about it. The model of the car is an *ābhāsa* to them, and any statement they make about it is **not to be counted as a** ***pramāṇa*****.**\n\nThe second book of the Nyāyasūtra deals more extensively on this topic, so I will depart from it now and move on to the fourth and final class Source of Right Knowledge - Reliable Testimony.\n\n## Shabda Pramāṇa: Reliable Testimony\n\nReliable Testimony, or *Shabda Pramāṇa* (शब्द प्रमाण) is defined as instructive assertion of a reliable person. The keywords here are *instructive*, *assertion* and *reliable*.\n\nFirst of all, Testimony has to be an **assertion**. It cannot be a guess or a claim or a hypothesis. It has to be in the form of an assertion itself. An assertion is when someone declares something. When I say, "there is water in this bottle" - pointing at an opaque bottle in front of me - then it is an assertion. If I say, "based on the way this bottle makes sound when I jerk it, I think it has water", that is an informed guess, not an assertion. But if I were to say "when I jerk this bottle, it produces the sound of splashing water inside", *that* would again be an assertion.\n\nSecond, it is generally instructive - it has to be something you do not already know. It is not testimony if someone were to say that the sun, as seen from the Earth, rises in the East. That is not an instruction because an instruction has to teach something new. It is only testimony if I learnt something new from it.\n\nThe last concept is of reliability, and this is broken into two parts, as the Nyāyasūtra\'s later treatment of the Vedas shows - that they know what they are talking about - in other words, be knowledgeable about the topic - and that they have good intentions towards you. If the later is not true, they may yet have reasons to lie.\n\nOnly when a testimony is from someone who is reliable does it count. This becomes a special point of this particular source of right knowledge. For instance, how is someone to understand whether a particular assertion comes from a reliable person? The reliability of a person - or lack thereof - is also a matter of knowledge. To have right knowledge about the reliability of someone, we have to again apply the four means of right knowledge to the problem of testing someone\'s reliability. This introduces the problem of **recursion** into the epistemological process. This is clearly undesirable, since it is entirely possible that the strongest claim to the reliability of a person holding a testimony is that *others* testify that they are reliable. In this situation, the logician has to go down the rabbit hole, seeking out the reliability of a person by careful reasoning and the acquisition of means of knowledge from a variety of sources.\n\nIn the presence of such massive problem, one might ask, "why bother with testimony? why not figure out for yourself, or verify for yourself?"\n\nWell, in some cases, verifying the testimony may not be possible. For instance, if you are going to ask someone "is this water or Sprite?", pointing at a bottle full of some transparent stuff on a table at a birthday party, refering to the flavoured soda which so annoyingly resembles water, is often mistaken for water in such situations, and offers a tangy taste when consumed and does nothing to alleviate thirst. Now, this person says "It\'s water.". You basically do not know for yourself without tasting the substance whether it is water or soda (unless, of course, you have a full scientific apparatus consisting of litmus paper and test tubes to test the liquid). In this harmless situation, you are forced to either take the testimony of the person, or leave it altogether.\n\nLikewise, if there is a theft in your house, and the neighbour says she saw a man in a leather jacket leaving around nine in the night the previous night, there is no way to test this testimony. There are very serious situations where you may not be able to test a testimony.\n\nBut the deeper reason for considering testimony is that there is something bigger than that. The truth is, you cannot live without testimonial evidence. From one source or another, there is testimonial evidence. Most of what we know is from someone\'s assertion. Let me give a simple example from the sciences. We know that the mass of the electron has been experimentally discovered to be 9.1e-31 kilograms. Now, *have you performed the experiment in question?* Have *you* used the apparatus used to specifically measure the charge of an electron, and compute the mass from the curvature *you yourself* then measured in the trajectory of an electron subjected to a magnetic field? No, right? You take the reliable testimony of peer-reviewed research.\n\nLikewise, when a doctor prescribes medicine, it is an assertion that this medicine will work well for the health problem you have. You have no other source of information on it. When you check the specs of a laptop or cellphone or a car or a bike prior to purchase, you are going on testimony. All of what we learnt in science, save for the bits we learnt from experiments directly, or by mathematical computation from existing information (which counts are inference) are testimony.\n\nI am repeatedly bringing up the sciences here for a reason. Consider [this](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0020124) study published in 2005, according to which most published scientific research in the field of biomedical sciences are not reliable discoveries, but rather, to quote the paper,\n\n&gt;Claimed Research Findings May Often Be Simply Accurate Measures of the Prevailing Bias\n\nThis is something important to learn from. 47 out of 53 (88.68%) of discoveries in cancer research were discovered to be unreliable, their [results not reproducible when the experiments were repeated.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-science-cancer-idUSBRE82R12P20120328). What does this tell us about the testimony of peer-reviewed medical research?\n\nUltimately, a peer-reviewed scientific research is testimony. This is essential to understand. Testimonial evidences are *everywhere,* and some of the most well known and commonly acknowledged "facts" are ultimately known through testimony. Do you know what the continents are and where they are located? Yes, of course. But *have you seen them first hand?* No! All you have is testimony of a number of sailors, handed down to us through the generations via innumerable intermediaries.\n\nAccording to the Nyāyasūtra, *testimony is of two categories* (1:1:8) - **verifiable**, or *Dṛshṭāt* (दृष्टात्), and **unverifiable**, or *Dṛshṭārthāt* (दृष्टार्थात्). A testimony is verifiable if it is possible, given the right means, for a person to verify them using the other three sources of acquiring Right Knowledge. For instance, the claim that there are mountains on Mars is verifiable. On the other hand, the claim that one may go to heaven or hell is unverifiable. This distinction is important, and it is useful to remember as we proceed with our study of Nyāya. In general, one ought to be very careful with the unverifiable claims.\n\nIf someone says that they have an experience of seeing spirits, it is unverifiable, unless they can show you the spirits. If someone says that mass is mostly conserved in chemical reactions, it is possible to verify it, and others may verify it, strengthening the claim. There is a clear difference here. Nevertheless, a verifiable claim that is unverified is little better than a testimony that cannot be verified to begin with.\n\nThis is more than enough for one post, I dare say. It is already 33435 characters long in markdown! Moreover, the first topic - Means of Acquiring Right Knowledge - has been covered to the preliminary degree that the Nyāyasūtra covers it. It is time to stop for today. I will continue this in the next post, which will deal with the second of the sixteen components of Nyāya - the Objects of Right Knowledge.\n\nTill then, please take care!'<br />Author: 'Rajarshi1993'  id: 'kzww6x'<br />Score:49<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kzww6x/the_nyāyasūtra_1_pramāṇa_or_the_sources_of_right/</li>

He may be only second to Nehru when it comes to the distortion (silent or blatant) of the achievements and contribution to founding the great nation of ours. Despite all that has been said and done to butcher his name, I for one, still fondly recall him as the 'Father of MY Nation'. Let me try and reduce his relevance in today's time as clearly as possible -\n\nThe present notion of Gandhi's Ideal of Non-Violence is a noble idea but impractical and unrealistic. \tThis tends to sanctify Gandhi while rejecting his principles (quite ingenious of the haters). \n\nIt would take even a simple soul to read through the history pages (whatever source you may exploit) and follow the simple chain of events that shaped the great man in his quest to become an unparalleled leader of a silent movement of non-violence which came to known as Satyagraha. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn points, his Idea of Non - Violence signifies -\n\n\t• Realistic Hope / Practical Idealism\n\n\t• Based on Global Welcoming of the Law of Love\n\n\t• Instrument of Public Dissent for the Powerless\n\n\t• Aim - Conflict Resolution and Universal Harmony \n\n\t• Developed to be a Moral Exercise/ Ethical Commitment \n\n\t• For Gandhi, Ethical = Political\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnto the next subject fo Democracy though the round glasses of the father of the nation, simply -\n\n\t• Democracy &amp; Non-Violence two sides of the same coin\n\n\t• Humanism &gt; Individualism - Just Society / Service to all humans\n\n\t• Democracy results from Moral Growth of Humankind/ Ethical Becoming\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was clearly ahead of his time, envisioning globalization and diversity being the pillars of any modern society - start difference from the era of the cold war, jingoism and protectionism (which imprints on today's horizon as well). His idea of society was based on the principles of -\n\n\t• Inter-Cultural Dialogue (Global Welcoming/ Law of Love)\n\n\t• Not a Dogmatic Nationalist (Favoured Diplomatic Congress over the Extremists)\n\n\t• Aim - Finding Common Ground. Ergo Pluralistic and Empathetic.\n\n\t• Politics - More Ethical than Religious. Religion - Ethical &gt; Theological.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, the Idea of Indianness. His thoughts and words, if read deeply, vividly clarify the archetype of a perfect Indian - what the forefathers dreamt of, which the Constitution defines. Gandhi -\n\n\t• Refused to define India as ethnic purity/ Linguistic unity / Religious Monotony\n\n\t• Anti-Monistic and Pluralistic Dimension \n\n\t• Can't Love one's country without loving other's culture\n\n\t• Living Together without national/religious Self-Centeredness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL/DR - Charting Gandhi's relevance in today's India and the World. How the ideas of a man who is banished from the popular belief and dialogue today, can come to the rescue of a divided society.

They have always lived a Western-style life, with Western food and an admiration for Western culture.\n\nThe daughter now tends rather to frown on this.

      <li>Title::: 'The post colonial self hate and guilt is really harmful'<br />Body: 'I am an Indian and I was in a family that has been fortunate. You could say old wealth of sorts. I have to mention this in this context because the history of my family is not the same as the majority of Indians who were born here. I was born a Parsi. We are Zoroastrians who escaped prosecution from Iran and land and adopted the cultures of where we settled. We are a small minority in India however because of our past of escaping prosecution and being in the center of some major trade routes around the world, a ton of us became some of the first traders and investors in indian projects and companies. Then the British and the other colonists came.\n\nGenetically speaking India is my step motherland because I\'m by blood Persian. But I\'m proudly going to say I\'m Indian because this is the only country I know. But I guess my people have always been global and so we adopted languages like English to communicate with those generations that were born and raised to their step motherlands. And so when the white man came we fit in like a glove because of our ability to speak English fluently and ability to communicate with others. We were given some top post in the big massive institutions like the East India company at that time including the head of the India operations with Lord Manek and all. A ton of us got lordships and some of us including my ancestors became the first doctors, lawyers, engineers, newspaper editors etc in India. But this was all because of luck by chance and to some extent it\'s because we were fortunate to be educated about the world, a luxury which even today a lot of Indians aren\'t able to get.\n\nWhat history of racism and torment my ancestors must have faced is totally different from what India faced. Zoroastrians have always been less than 1% of the total Indian population and we\'re mostly situated in big towns in like gated communities. I have read and I know all the horro stories what majority of Indians had gone through. They were slaves and they literally went through hell to feed an industrial engine that didn\'t care if they lived or died. It\'s not surprising that some of the first people to ask for Indian independence was someone from my community because like I said, we knew the world because we had the fortune of education. \n\nNow this history lesson is important because it has been less than 70 years since indian independence. Someone who was born during the struggle could still be alive today. I\'m not saying India was a wonderland before the Brits but the inception of India as a united country and not a confederation of states came after Independence. The  states are really old but the country as it is is relatively new exercise in democracy.\n\nAs someone who is currently suffering from depression and anxiety I know how bad guilt can hit and everything fear can make a person do. The fairness cream industry is a direct example of how this mindset has affected us to this day. It\'s racism meandering into social acceptance because of the mindsets in general populist. Ideas stay long after people die and they can be bad. Indirectly we can see the impact of the colonists over education, work and even in our ideas of modern India and politics.\n\nWhile independence our leaders have looked to be "influenced" by other styles of government especially during the cold war where India was a sort of half socialist and government controlled hellscape for private businesses. What happened to Indian ways of thought ? Why is it that we either look to the west or to the North for solutions to our problems and not in Asia itself? It just seems as if there are massive scars in Indias policy and instead of taking solutions that can work in india, they are parroting an outdated solution to a bad extent. Any critical view of such policy seems like an attack to some testiment. We even have Indian philosophy, why is it when someone wants to portray themselves as smart they quite some random Greek philosopher or some random russian poet.\n\nYou have heard about racism in India. That\'s not because there is a massive hate against people who look different. It\'s because there is a fear against them. One could argue that fear begets hate and hate begets fear but I digress. A lot of the decisions after independence haven\'t really been innovative, they have been fearful and reactionary. And since India isn\'t prepared, they end up paying a higher price for it all.\n\nMost of the scammer you have heard are from India. There are resons why it\'s so. First we are the largest speaking Indian population and second most of the youth are either engineers or stem oriented. The reason is because there is some weird conception here where only the STEM fields make you money when economically speaking it\'s actually loosing money because of demand and supply. If you throw a rock to a crowd 9/10 you will find an engineering bachelor. This is because the jobs that my great grandfather and their fathers used to do is somehow hard-coded into their minds that this is the only path to take . When in actuality because of the brainwashing and guilt shaming all these really arrogant institutes do they become less employable because what personality and drive they had, becomes a hinderene to pass a test. If robots can take jobs, it\'s going to affect India the most and we are not even talking about this. Mostly what would happen is that the government would ban robots and algorithms and big companies will simply not invest in India as much. Then in the long run India will suffer more because of the benefits of having automation in the work place.\n\nWe have the highest demographic dividend in our nation but it\'s going to go to waste if we aren\'t going to get people out of this depressing schism of self hate. I don\'t want the colonists to keep saying they are sorry because it\'s something in the past. We cankeep on blaming the white man for current issues but we have to also move on.

As we must not jeopardize freedom of speech and expression.\n\nBut where should we Hindus draw that line; when this freedom turns into abuse?\n\nIn day to day life, this happens naturally. We draw lines with people, based on who can and cannot take a joke/offence. And we expect the other to respect this line.\n\nWe are all aware if a Hindu directed TV series is made kidding about prophet Mohommad, will at best be marked as Islamophobic and worst, the associated people might be lynched/killed.\n\nShould these people even have right to defame anyone else\'s religion? It just hypocrisy at that point as they play as the victim. If you can\'t take a joke, then don\'t make one either. And that\'s what angers me.\n\nThey keep crossing this line over and over again, making fun of you and your beliefs, but instantly takes offence and turns violent/victim when you joke the same. (Just imagine having a friend like that).\n\nFreedom of Speech should go both ways.\n\nSecondly:\n\nThere\'s plenty child porn made, why don\'t we also have the same attitude towards it. "Don\'t like it, don\'t watch it?" and just ignore it. Well because It\'s wrong, because it hurts people, both physically and mentally. Hence it should be and is illegal.\n\nIf the creators of tandav can\'t with all their creative might go beyond hurting religious sentiments to garner popularity or spread propaganda, whatever their motives may be; then it deserves all the criticisms and hatred. It is at the end fo day, insulting your beliefs.\n\nAdditionally, how would you feel if you deeply believe in something/someone and you know someone is foul mouthing about it behind your back. Will you not stop it from happening ? That shuts the "don\'t watch it" argument. \n\nWith all these factors, I believe at the very least, it should be partially censored. Banned?

      <li>Title::: '[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Tragic week for Indonesia, Washington DC turns into fortress, and the Russo-Japanese War of 1905'<br />Body: 'Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Geopolitics Thread, where we discuss events from around the world. Topics of conversation do not have to be related to India - please share interesting stories that you found in the comments. Here are a few stories to get the conversation started:\n\n# Top Stories\n\n1. [Donald Trump impeached, again](https://news.yahoo.com/live-updates-trump-impeachment-2-133207732.html)\n\nPresident Donald Trump of the US made the wrong kind of history by being the first US President to be impeached twice. However, unlike the first time almost a year ago, when he was impeached for pressuring Ukraine to investigate rival Joe Biden and where the vote was tightly along party lines, this time he was impeached for inciting a violent attempted coup on the US legislature, and 10 members of his own party voted to impeach him - the most defections ever. Biden will be sworn in on Jan 20, but the impeachment of Trump will continue in the Senate in the hope of barring him from government office for life.\n\n2. [Earthquake and plane crash mark hard week for Indonesia](https://nypost.com/2021/01/16/aftershocks-shake-indonesia-as-earthquake-death-toll-rises/)\n\nIndonesia faced two near-simultaneous tragedies which, along with the continuing saga of COVID-19, are testing national resolve. First, a Sriwijaya Airlines flight crashed into the Java Sea, killing all passengers and crew members aboard. Investigators are yet to find the plane\'s black box to reconstruct what caused the flight to virtually make a vertical dive into the sea. Second, an earthquake around Mamuju, registering 6.2 on the Richter scale as well as several aftershocks, has led to 46 deaths so far and flattened many buildings, including a hospital. In the midst of all these, the country began administering COVID-19 vaccines developed by a Chinese company, and has adopted the unique strategy of inoculating social media influencers to lower the social taboo against vaccination in the conservative Islamic society.\n\n3. [29 frail, elderly people die in Norway after vaccination](https://www.businessinsider.com/norway-raises-concern-of-covid-19-vaccine-on-frail-elderly-2021-1)\n\nNorway reported 29 deaths among very old people (over 75 years of age) after receiving the first shot of Pfizer-BioNTech\'s COVID-19 vaccine. Of these, at least 13 are being directly linked to serious side effects that were developed due to the vaccine. However, over 50,000 people have received vaccinations so far, so the probability of deaths as a result of side effects remains miniscule. Nonetheless, this has raised concerns about the safety of mass vaccination of very old citizens. Vaccines are usually administered to infants, and that\'s where most of the experience is.\n\n4. [Washington, DC turns into fortress for Biden-Harris inauguration](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/woman-arrested-inauguration-checkpoint-d-c-said-she-was-cabinet-n1254545)\n\nWith 25,000 paramilitary troops manning checkpoints and tightly regulating movement, the US capital city now has more active American troops in it than in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, and Somalia combined. All this to prevent far-right extremists - many of them former or current members of the US military and civilian law enforcement - from killing anyone during the historic inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on Jan 20, after the deadly siege of the US Capitol building two weeks ago that killed 5 people. AirBnB says that it has cancelled all reservations in the area around that day, airlines have banned civilians from checking in firearms if they are flying to the area, and social media is removing any posts that imply violent activity on the day. Already, some people have been arrested at checkpoints for falsifying their identity to try to enter the security perimeter. Trump has said that he will not attend the ceremony.\n\n5. [Qatar spat with GCC ends](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-saudi/saudi-to-reopen-qatar-embassy-in-coming-days-saudi-minister-idUSKBN29L0DK)\n\nIn what will likely be the last of the Trump administration\'s impressive accomplishments in the Middle East, the spat between Qatar and its GCC neighbours as well as Egypt came to an end after being brokered by US Presidential advisor Jared Kushner and his team. Qatar, the world\'s wealthiest country, came under increasing scrutiny for its warm ties to Iran and Turkey, as well as its funding of Al Jazeera, which pokes at every regime in the region except the Qatari one itself. GCC countries led by Saudi Arabia initiated a boycott of the country three years ago that left it dependent on Iran for basic food and supplies. However, with the end of the spat, the country seems to have come out even stronger and the Gulf countries try to prevent the Biden administration from re-instituting the nuclear agreement with Iran.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The Russo-Japanese War of 1905\n\nWar is an extension of politics - but it works much faster and more dramatically than talk, although the results are far from certain. Of the many wars of the 20th Century that led up to the catastrophe that was WW2, one that stands out prominently for its larger effects is the war between Tsarist Russia and Imperial Japan, which changed power and minds in Asia forever. At the twilight of the 19th Century, European expansion and conquest of Asia was at its peak - India was part of the British Empire, Southeast Asia was controlled by virtually every European power, West Asia was firmly held by the Ottoman Empire, Russia had conquered Central Asia, Siberia and Kamachatka, the United States had annexed the Philippines, and all of them were cutting up China into spheres of influence where the Qing Emperor would be reduced to a figurehead with nominal sovereignty. \n\nIn this milieu, Japan stood out as a somewhat unique power. Having been forced to trade with the rest of the world by Admiral Perry\'s fleet from the United States, the elite of the country embarked to radically transform it: society, culture, and industry were all Westernized during what is called the Meiji Restoration. This tumultuous period saw a militarization of Japanese boys and men at large, the relegation of traditional Zen and Buddhist philosophy to rural backwaters, women being pushed to produce as many babies as possible to increase the population, and rapid destruction of traditional, small-scale industry in favour of large-scale industry that could compete with the West. By 1890, Japan hardly looked like an agricultural, Asian society and spoke even less like one. There was a clamour in the country for colonies, exclusive markets that could reinforce Japanese industry, and the subjugation of "inferior races" in China and Korea that had failed to modernize. In other words, Japan thought of itself a Western power, even if the West saw it as an inferior Asian one.\n\nIn 1894, Japan defeated the Qing Empire in the first Sino-Japanese War to claim Korea and Taiwan as part of its sphere of influence. It was the first time that an Asian power had joined in the conquest of Asia, and it led to alarm in Russia, which coveted northeast China (Manchuria) in order to obtain a warm-water port (the easternmost Russian port, Vladivostok, was frozen in winter). Seeing Russia as a bulwark against further Japanese aggression, the Qing Emperor welcome Russia into Manchuria, where they established Port Arthur and a city dubbed "Moscow of the Far East", Harbin (home today to one of China\'s leading universities, the Harbin Institute of Technology). However, this was seen as a second defeat by Chinese subjects, and the Boxer Rebellion began in 1900, which ultimately led to the establishment of the Republic of China. The Rebellion also saw direct military involvement of Japan and Russia, and the Russians decided to keep their troops there as they intended to take Korea in the course of time. \n\nAs tensions between Russia and Japan increased, so did European propaganda against the "Yellow Peril" - fueled particularly by the German Emperor Kaiser Wilhelm II, the cousin of Tsar Nicholas II. The "Peril" implied that Europe would be overrun by a powerful Japan and Russia was the only force that could stop it. Consequently, when Japan offered to recognize Russian dominance over Manchuria in exchange for them recognizing Japanese dominance over Korea, Russia refused. Finally, in 1904, Japan abruptly declared war on Russia and attacked the fleet at Port Arthur, blockading the area and leading to urgent requests to the Russian capital of St Peterburg to send reinforcements. However, by the time the message was received, Russia\'s entire Far East fleet had been destroyed by Japan. In this, Japan was aided by a secret alliance with British India that saw active intelligence sharing and cooperation between Japanese and British-Indian troops from Malaya. Although Britain never fought in the war, they were part of it through their lynchpin in Asia, British India. \n\nIn the Autumn of 1904, the Tsar decided to send the Russian Baltic Fleet to fight Japan - a massive journey partly around the Cape of Good Hope and partly through the Suez Canal, and then through the Straits of Malacca (all controlled by the British, thus giving plenty of intelligence to the Japanese). The Baltic Fleet arrived only in February of 1905, tired and short of supplies. There, they faced rapid defeats at the hands of a prepared Japanese Navy, culminating in the Battle of Tsushima, where 5,000 Russian sailors and all but three of their ships were destroyed during a hasty retreat to Vladivostok. The military campaign had ended in a decisive victory for Japan, which stunned the world. An Asian power had routed a European one for the first time.\n\nAfter the hostilities, the Treaty of Portsmouth was negotiated under the mediation of US President Teddy Roosevelt (for which he received the Nobel Peace Prize). Under the treaty, Korea and Taiwan were recognized as under Japanese control (eventually to be annexed), Russia signed over rights to Port Arthur to Japan and also ceded half of Sakhalin Island. In Japan, the Treaty was met with anger as the victorious Japanese people expected to annex all of Manchuria, Sakhalin, Siberia, and Kamchatka, and anti-American sentiment grew. In Russia, it led to the 1905 Revolution that severely limited the Tsar\'s powers and, together with World War I, eventually saw the Bolshevik Revolution and the establishment of the USSR. Across Europe, it sent alarm bells ringing about the rise of a new power in Asia, possibly threating to free even occupied European nations such as Ireland and Poland. And across Asia, it saw a new hope, a validation that Asians were not an inferior race and could rise up in freedom from their European masters - a sentiment expressed by figures as diverse as the King of Persia (Iran), Sun-Yat Sen of the Republic of China, the Panchen Lama in Tibet, and a young upstart politician in British India, Jawaharlal Nehru. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What stories caught your attention?

      <li>Title::: 'Racism and hounded out of Mathematics PhD program in the US'<br />Body: 'A shorter synopsis here: [https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/155185/how-to-proceed-after-being-threatened-and-treated-poorly-by-university-faculty-a](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/155185/how-to-proceed-after-being-threatened-and-treated-poorly-by-university-faculty-a)\n\nI\'ve been hounded out of the program at a time when I was among the most productive PhD students in the recent past in our department. It\'s shocking what little recourse a foreign student has in these circumstances; even though I was trying to get back to India a couple of years with the toxicity of the situation, it would have been poor to leave a program midway and I kept on.\n\nThe university first took the strategy of hiring lawyers to threaten me with very deceptive insinuations and outright falsehoods, as I kept telling them I\'ll make things public. Then they wanted a kind of written statement where I would write how I "threatened, bullied, harassed people", all to do with the fact that I had kept telling them I\'d make things public. The other matter is that my work was going very well, despite this constant harassment, so the ethics of their strategy comes under the scanner even more.\n\nMy(now deleted) long post on StackExchange from March of last year. Detailing a lot of garbage from our Math department; it\'s hard to get across the context in which these comments were made, and a couple of these could be deemed somewhat inoffensive here, but mostly the environment was such that even the couple of seemingly mild incidents mentioned here seemed extremely serious, compared to another PhD environment I had been in till 2016. Frankly, looking back, I wrote this in a very measured tone. The biggest trigger initially for me to want to make these things public was the constant frothing at the mouth ultra demeaning way in which a specific PhD student behaved with me from the very beginning(as mentioned later), and later began the same with other international students(who also felt worked up with far less interaction with him than me). However, a lot of further incidents kept happening even after thisna initial impulse to make things public.\n\nThe incidents from 2019 and earlier this year would all have been dealt with a lot better if the present head of the department didn\'t become seriously sick, and he remained the head of the department from earlier on. Another recently graduated student wrote to me on Messenger that "The department is going to become even more racist if he is not here now".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis behavior is mostly from Spring 2018 and then Fall 2019. These raised extremely serious safety concerns at that time, and an office to address this behavior did not even exist inside this university until 2019. When I did finally report this to the new office, they said they take it seriously, but then completely dismissed everything mentioned here. Prior to that the only place to report this was their HR department, and I faced a further round of harassment from them, upon reporting the Spring 2018 events. I\'m an Indian PhD student.\n\nLet\'s call the concerned person X. The chair is called Chair.\n\nIn Spring 2018 I was teaching a Calculus class and X was then the so called supervisor in these teaching matters; at one point I was grading undergrad exams in his office. On his office door is a newsclip of the professor who was viewed as a terrorist for doing math on the plane. The newsclip ended in self-reflection, concluding that the only thing \'we\' fear more than immigrants is Math.\n\nWhile grading, at one point X casually remarked that he was looking for his boarding pass. I casually remarked we should all be careful doing Math on a plane; when he very proudly told me \'no, I\'m white\'. I replied; \'well wasn\'t the guy in that incident also white\'? then he smugly said as a putdown, \'yes, but he was Italian, I\'m not Italian, I\'ll be fine’. There was another visiting postdoc well within earshot in the room with his back turned to us, as this was happening.\n\nA few days later, I had been late for a few hours in finishing grading; something that literally always people are, including X (I also wasn\'t very pleased when on the prior evening, my advisor from back then needlessly insulted me in front of several other faculty members for coming to a dinner with a colloquium speaker, when I had no intention to really go there but for the fact that I thought he would expect me to be there). While no one else had an issue, one of X\'s minions, a fellow PhD student, came to my office and told me it\'s disgusting I was late and that he was shaking in anger as a result. I told him politely to leave and shut the door of my office. Upon hearing this, X came to my office seeming extremely bellicose, physically intimidated me and forced himself into my office, as if I was a criminal. I told him also to please get out of my office , after which he got out and went to chair\'s office and started complaining about me. No one was inconvenienced then because I was late for a few hours with grading, and every single time I have graded with people, one or more people have been late with grading.\n\nAfter a midterm exam, X was asking opinions about how to grade a contentious question; one of his minions passionately said something to which X replied in a conciliatory tone "I know you\'re from U Chicago and you think you know best, but I disagree"; I was right there and also tried getting a word in, and X looked at me with absolute detestation, suggesting you don\'t have a right to say anything here.\n\nEarlier that day, I was hearing him talking down to a Chinese graduate student, telling him there\'s an American PhD student also in the room he would be invigilating in for the exam, and that student would take care of everything, and the Chinese student doesn\'t need to know any of the procedures for setting up the exam in the exam room.\n\nDuring the proctoring, we had to add up some numbers for some reason and I was doing it in my head; X\'s minion was standing there and suddenly he lost it; started saying \'it\'s disgusting you guys can add stuff up so fast\'; talking about some racist tropes he has in his head about Indians. This was said in a really loud and unpleasant tone. X was right there and heard everything but said nothing.\n\nAfterwards as we were grading in the lounge, as a lot of people were joking around I facetiously remarked that I might comment in an Indian student\'s exam in an Indian language; which of course I was not going to do. X got triggered and became serious and cooked up a story of some Chinese students and postdocs talking in Chinese in the corridors that apparently made so many people suspicious that there were serious complaints. This was said in a room full of graduate students, many of them Chinese, who interact in Chinese between themselves and with other Chinese faculty or postdocs and no one that I knew of found anything wrong in it. At another time, he told me in our lounge when others were present, that our university might be a nice place, but there is a Jewish clique, and then there is a Chinese clique and the whole environment is very divided. At another time, in our graduate lounge with a lot of people present, when I was casually remarking, after many such casual remarks by American students there, that the traffic here in Boston reminds me of India sometimes, X snapped and very threateningly told me: don’t B-S me, I’ve seen so and so movie, I know what traffic in India is like. Although the “very threatening” bit was so commonplace that it kind of feels strange to point that out.\n\nAs is the norm, X would ask for questions from graduate student instructors, in order to make the final list of exam questions. Not a single one of my questions were used in the two midterms, although a couple were used in the final exam if I recall. I found it unacceptable that none of these questions had been used in the midterms; I know of at least one other Indian phd student whose questions had not been used either, and he was OK with it; but I was not, with the amount of time spent in making the questions.\n\nSurprisingly X once suddenly forced himself into my office last Fall, upon hearing some complaint from a recently graduated student about such issues, probably something about my general countenance struck a chord with him and compelled him to rush in to check if there was more pent up trouble further down the road, and I politely tried ending the conversation, because it was not productive. He concluded in solidarity, saying how he too was very wary when he first came here as a PhD student, since he was scared he would have to learn Hebrew, because of a large Jewish population here.\n\nI\'ve lost count of how many times one PhD student that X hangs out with has said outrageous things in front of me, often directed at me; repeatedly saying how \'there are some typical Indians around here\', that \'Indians are taking over\' (even though there have only been 3 or 4 Indian students at a time in our program, and for the last 4 years there have been no Indian PhD students here) and how \'it\'s so funny there is great color consciousness in India since you guys are all brown\'. Often these things were said in front of many other people, and if I counted individual instances, probably such comments were uttered a few dozen times in my presence. At one other time, in front of me and another Indian student who had mentioned that the Supreme Court judges in India are not known expressly as liberal and conservative partisans as is the case in the US, this student began to openly say in a disparaging tone that the judges in India would be no good anyway, in comparison to the US.\n\nIn the very beginning, in front of several other graduate students, he would be talking about a specific slur against Jews, that I didn’t know about earlier, in the tone that he was just curious about it but not using it himself, but kept using it repeatedly in front of several people. There was no Jewish person present when he kept on saying this.\n\nAt first I didn\'t think much of it, and even thought some of his comments about Indians was intended to be amusing which I shouldn\'t have; but upon talking with him a little more it was clear he was saying all these things not as a joke but meant everything. The worst situation was last Fall when during a mandatory meeting a couple of PhD students including me brought up some issues regarding transportation and mental health issues among undergrads, and after it ended, this PhD student in front of everyone else began to loudly say \'how funny it is how he always complains, it was so funny\' and then came to my office and still kept insulting me to my face, ignoring the fact that there was another American PhD student who was raising far more issues than me .\n\nThere\'s also another PhD student X hangs out with all the time, who would froth at the mouth in my presence in the beginning, and in the presence of a few other international students; and probably it was the worst and most prolonged dehumanizing behavior I\'ve faced from anyone younger than me, with him talking with me (and also a few other international PhD students a bit later) in a vile and threatening manner like we are lepers; however this person was careful not to utter slurs. I’ve spoken to a couple of other international students and they have also felt unnerved by him for prolonged periods, but I should emphasize this began the earliest with me and he was in the same year as me. Regarding him, I was speaking with another international PhD student, who told me that if someone behaved like that in his home country with him, he would punch him in the face. And this international student had to interact with him far far less than I had to. If it was in my own country, I would probably not punch him, but call the Police dozens of times.\n\nThis student became a favorite of one of our teaching coordinators, this teaching coordinator is someone we had no option to avoid and who would harass some of us on the simplest of pretexts. Another Indian PhD student remarked in front of me and someone else, that “the treatment of international students by this teaching coordinator is extremely poor”. I happened to mention this to another Indian PhD student here who was seriously harassed by this teaching coordinator and who had been documenting that harassment. Then the former Indian PhD student came to know about it, and sensing he might get into unnecessary trouble with this being added to the pantheon of comments and complaints, began to aggressively say “I never said such a thing”. Another international PhD student who graduated and got a postdoc job elsewhere called me after the completion of his first semester there; he had taught and graded along with PhD students in his new place and said it was refreshing and cathartic not to get harassed about simple matters in grading like he had been here. I have personally been talked to in a needlessly condescending way about minor (non)issues in grading, and in the beginning asked to regrade things for the flimsiest of (garbage) reasons. It is tiring to even talk about the nuisance created by this person in simple matters of grading; generally when I have graded with other faculty members here or at my previous university, things have been far more normal. Earlier another PhD student had been warning me about her, and how she creates a toxic environment for the flimsiest reasons .Both her and X, after working with us for more than a year and apparently claiming to know us well, called me by another Indian PhD student’s name, which particularly in the US is considered very bad form.\n\nThere is yet another former PhD student here who I have seen behave in a very aggressive and condescending manner with other international students and I’ve talked with other international students about it. I myself always said hi and hello like is the custom in the US, and very rarely heard any hi or hello in return, and on one instance, as I was passing him by in the corridor, this PhD student looked at me in an extremely aggressive and ugly way, which would unnerve and make anyone feel unsafe, and if something like this happened on the streets you would move away as quickly as possible from there.\n\nComing to the incidents of Fall 2019, let\'s call the person Y, a PhD student whose desk was right next to mine in the office. Starting in September 2019, he would repeatedly put his boot on a chair pointing straight at me, just a couple of feet away from where I would be sitting and working, and when I asked him to stop this, he would do so and then resume a few days later, and then say I purposefully moved in the view of his feet so I could claim that his feet were pointing towards me. (I had earlier tried to make eye contact suggesting that this is really very poor, with me having to see the underside of his boots from a couple of feet away, but he didn’t respond to my very polite non-verbal cues.) Then a few days later, he would say in a very overbearing tone that we should now look at the configuration of the chairs so he could explain to me how his feet were not pointing towards me; this is after the chairs had all been moved around within the intervening days. Hearing all of this, I had told him \'I have work to do and don\'t want to engage your third rate ilk\'; which is not a nice thing to say, but under the circumstances seemed quite necessary. Afterwards Y saw me in the corridor and came eyeball to eyeball, with an extremely threatening body language, standing inches from me, saying in a theatrical way, "don\'t you ever disrespect me ever again", because apparently that was his sole privilege.\n\nAfter this he began keeping his bag on a chair very close to my desk and far from his desk, in some kind of passive aggressive show of force. I took a picture of this and showed our Director of graduate studies, let\'s call him Z, and he knew of the previous incident, and he asked me not to get worked up over it, and that he \'noted\' it. I said it\'s better to change offices for me; and this is done informally by grad students all the time. However, Z personally intervened and said that\'s not necessary, and we should get along. This might have been due to a personal dislike of Z towards me. I was always polite with him but didn\'t think the world of him to take his Combinatorics 1 class, but took a Combinatorics 2 class taught by a prodigious postdoc in the department.( It turns out I got two papers on my own from that Combinatorics 2 class, one of which now got a favorable review from a top Combinatorics journal.)\n\nZ was miffed, and told another faculty member (as narrated by this other faculty member to me) how I can at all do research in Combinatorics (doing Combinatorics research was never my plan anyway) if I didn\'t take his Combinatorics 1 class and in turn this faculty member relayed this to me. At that time, I met with Z and he told me that one of the aforementioned PhD students who said things like “you f—ing Indians” to me and behaved in offensive ways dozens of other times, was just “special”, and I should just learn to live with it. Then Z, being from a Western European country, told me in solidarity, after having seen the list of alleged incidents, that “Americans don’t dress well”, and there are other similar kinds of general problems we always deal with.\n\nI’m not sure exactly and would hope they both did the right thing by asking this other graduate student to leave when they were talking about me, but Z and this faculty member were both saying condescending things about me, as this other faculty member himself told me coming out of the office they were speaking in. I was then asked to go to this office a minute later to speak with Z, and saw this other PhD student sitting in that office and it seemed like he was grading exams for a while. I would hope the PhD student was asked to leave for the time when these two faculty members were disparaging me.\n\nOn November 14 2019, as I was just entering the office in a bit of a hurry, and Y was coming out coincidentally at the very same moment, I did my best to move sideways, and there was a huge amount of room for him to move out, he deliberately rammed his shoulder into me, and kept ramming it into my body for a good few seconds. This now got into the territory of physical assault; and I immediately screamed about this, and a seminar was going on, and people got startled and closed the door.\n\nThere were no direct eyewitnesses to this. Later Z(grad advising head) told me that Y talked with him and that Y was minding his own business and that I started screaming at him unreasonably. Then Z said that if I complained about this to the Campus police, then I would probably get expelled. To the credit of the chair of the department, he intervened and said no one can get expelled like this.\n\nZ, the graduate advising head, also looked at documentation which listed comments by X about Italians, Jews, Chinese, Indians, and documentation of all the bellicose attitude from him, and then declared that none of this is offensive(he wrote this in an email that is with me). Then he told me I should have just let it go when another PhD student started saying stuff beginning with “you fucking Indians” or something very similar, and when this was said in front of the teaching faculty member X, instead of getting further appalled, I should have reasoned with X.\n\nIt is sometimes next to impossible to function properly in this kind of environment; and especially when things can get into the territory of physical assault so quickly and a faculty member with an axe to grind in this manner could step in. Compared to the previous graduate program I had been in, this was just a casually toxic environment; things like a graduate student who ordered a book through Amazon from India because it was cheaper and then in front of everyone began mocking what apparently was (to him) the poor presentation of the book as it arrived, or when in a nearby university during an AMS meeting an Indian mathematician with a bit heavy accent was giving a talk, a graduate student from our department began to openly laugh at the accent, looking at me like why I didn’t also laugh at that accent; when all the few dozen other people in the room were being serious with the talk (and some attendees seemed to have been old friends and acquaintances of this Indian mathematician).\n\nThere’s another faculty member here who says loudly to another PhD student, both taking it in a joking manner apparently, “don’t steal my f%$#ing car, you Albanians steal cars”, and the PhD student finds it funny and goes around telling people how funny this is. I was in the office of this faculty member when he said this; interrupting what I was trying to discuss with him. At another time, this faculty member said to his Complex Analysis class, “we have to kill the poles in the denominator”, then paused, and then quipping “let’s not talk about WW2 now”. Here, poles is a mathematical term, and Poles also is apparently a reference to Polish people.\n\nThe question is, how do I tie these incidents together with the incidents from the other post, and mention how it can sometimes be very difficult to function in such an environment, and that they should immediately stop threats of expulsion? To the immense credit of the department, I now have a new office which is peaceful. However, right in the next office is a guy who has unnerved many of the legal aliens in the department with his weird and threatening body language and behavior.\n\nEdit: I see that some people are saying how putting your feet up is not a big deal in the US. I\'ve seen this among officemates before, some good friends of mine, and it was perfectly fine. In all those cases, they were not pointing their feet squarely at me with such an obviously poor body language, and they were polite enough that if I would tell them I found it disrespectful, they would be mindful of that. In this instance, I told this person to stop, yet he started doing the same thing after a few days, having the audacity to say I purposefully moved in view of his feet to claim this; as if I have nothing else to do. Hence my response was a necessity.\n\nUpdate: Y has currently graduated and has been taken in as an instructor within our department and is apparently going to be teaching graduate courses. The other graduate student who used racial slurs against me was called special by Z and Z told me he deserves our understanding. At the same time, I’ve been constantly harassed and hounded by the university administration and threatened by their lawyers. This of course is explained by the fact that after the Office of Diversity and HR told me everything is fine, I asked them in return how they would like it if I made these things public knowledge.\n\nPart3:\n\nI\'m an Indian Mathematics PhD student somewhere in the US, and have been working with a faculty member affiliated to a university near mine, from the beginning of 2019. At the end of November 2019, I completed the proof of a problem given to me, under the so called guidance of this faculty member, although he had very little to do with it for a long time, except one contribution in the end, which was commendable. Once he came up with this alternate way to prove what I had already proved, he immediately began to call my work rubbish, and said, you will only write my argument in your thesis. Towards the end, I implored him to write the part that he thinks he is correct in, since it was going to be a joint paper, but he said that no, I must rewrite things and incorporate his idea and do the rewriting even when it was going to be a joint paper.\n\nAn update to this is that the paper was quite late in being written by me; months after it should have already been written. I asked my advisor then to become a co-author but then surprisingly he refused; this is two months after I had stopped speaking with him. Recently the paper was peer reviewed by a very reputed journal and the referee said the arguments are all deemed correct.\n\nHe began to continuously berate and belittle everything I have done, and grew extremely hysterical when I suggested a similar but different result was also within reach, which he didn\'t think possible. We were once sitting in a casual eatery, and I was calmly trying to explain some arguments, and he seemed extremely agitated, talking over me, calling the arguments wrong, but then trying to explain the same thing to me, as if it was his argument.\n\nI would have written up the project and sent for publication, but the extremely hostile attitude of this person stopped me from doing that. After mid-December, he again contacted me in the middle of January, and he expected me to regurgitate all the proofs to him again and again till the middle of March and do nothing else in that time with him. He would condescendingly tell me what according to him is right and what is wrong, in this time interval.\n\nIt\'s unbelievable that he would prevent me from writing down the next result which he believed was not possible, but which would take an hour to decide on, with a receptive person. I found this an unacceptable waste of my time, and also if I had to look for jobs and graduate in 2021, this was an unacceptable delay in sending the paper to a journal, although realistically the plan was to graduate in 2022.\n\nI\'m appalled by this kind of hostile attitude on a project where the techniques are so elementary, essentially nothing more than the pigeonhole principle is used, although things become a bit complicated. I would often tell him I have certain things figured out, and don\'t have to write it out since it is simple enough; and he would say OK; then next week he would completely berate me saying you know nothing about this. Perhaps not accustomed to working with someone who he feels superior to, that too from India, who did things much quicker than he anticipated.\n\nI had been speaking with a noted emeritus faculty member here, who is a renowned Combinatorialist, and telling him what was going on, and he sounded genuinely sorry for me in this situation but told me he was powerless to do anything about it. He was the only person who sounded genuinely sympathetic in this situation, when I wrote to him saying, to paraphrase, “having been in another US university, I didn’t expect this kind of ethnocentrism to be propped up like this”. I also sent a futile email to Z about what was happening, who only replied writing that my then advisor would have solved the problem even if it was not for me. In a later correspondence, Z said that there was enough reasons to expel me on academic grounds.\n\nUpon reporting this behavior in December 2019 to the department, I immediately began to get threats of expulsion. This is at the time when I had two publishable projects near completion. For my own good, I had to think to try to work with someone else, and I tried to talk with a faculty member about a particular problem in his area of expertise that I did substantial reading on and that I found interesting and wanted to work on. He completely ignored me. Despite this, during those times, at least 4 to 5 times I heard over a span of three months that my funding should get withdrawn and that the department would not be able to keep me.\n\nThe faculty member who I was once again interested in working with, had himself started advising an Indian student who was in his 4th year, in Spring 2018, although this student didn\'t have any completed projects till then. Our department is such that at least five people have changed advisors in their 4th year (at any single point we have &lt;30 PhD students) in the recent past, but none of them were threatened like me; and I doubt any of them could probably also objectively defend a thesis in their 4th year, before switching advisors, if they had to. Now I\'m working with another mathematician in a nearby university, and in the process I have had to change to another area of research this late, which is not a great thing.\n\nOther incidents:\n\n(i)The shoulder bumper alleging that a faculty member told him he wouldn’t get admitted if not for his white sounding name, him being Asian American.(Also this faculty member allegedly jokes around Chinese undergrads how like him they can\'t pronounce certain letters of the alphabet) Then an Indian student alleging that the shoulder bumper told him he shouldn’t be allowed to teach because of what he deemed his terrible accent, and the Indian student actually claiming in writing in an email that he had to really control himself in the past from getting physical with the shoulder bumper due to his behavior.'<br />Author: 'aritrop'  id: 'kywpe4'<br />Score:61<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kywpe4/racism_and_hounded_out_of_mathematics_phd_program/</li>

They heap all the work of the department on me and when I try to say there should be division of work, they intimidate me and complain against me to the authorities. They've already painted a worse image of me in front of higher authorities. Higher authorities are not listening to me. I can't leave that job as it's a government job (albeit it's financially risky and stressful) and moreover I'm not sure if the same situations won't repeat themselves. My whole life since school I've been made fun of and targeted as I'm not very smooth in social interactions and I suffer from mental illness and people call me mad, sometimes behind my back, and sometimes in front of me. I don't know how to deal with all this. There is no where I can seek help from. Authorities think I'm a bad employee just because I don't sit late (My house is 15km away from office and I reach office twenty to twenty five minutes earlier to compensate for it. I finish my lunch without leaving my seat in 10-15 minutes and resume working.)

      <li>Title::: "Indian vaccines and one of the world's largest vaccination drive against covid19 kicks off today!"<br />Body: "The Government of India on January 3rd 2020, approved 2 vaccines namely Covishield developed by Serum Institute of India and Covaxin developed by Bharat Biotech. How do these vaccines work? is it safe? How can you register? This post will try to address these questions.\n\n# How do these vaccines work?\n\n***SII's Covishield (Astrazenca)*** :  The 'virus-vectored' vaccine uses a weakened version of a chimpanzee common cold virus that encodes instructions for making proteins from the novel coronavirus to generate an immune response and prevent infection. About 3,000 people were given the half dose and then a full dose four weeks later, with data showing 90% were protected. In the larger group, who were given two full doses also four weeks apart, efficacy was 62%.  Serum Institute has developed the same vaccine with technology transfer from university of Oxford and AstraZenca. [src](https://www.livemint.com/science/health/covishield-how-effective-is-it-against-novel-covid-19-what-we-know-so-far-11610704468646.html)\n\nTypical side effects:  With the Covishield vaccine, mild adverse impacts could be headache, fatigue, myalgia (pain in muscle), injection site tenderness, malaise (weakness), pyrexia, chills, arthralgia, and nausea.  \n\n***Bharat Biotech (Covaxin) :***  The vaccine candidate was developed by BBIL in collaboration with the National Institute of Virology (NIV). NIV isolated a strain of the novel coronavirus from an asymptomatic Covid-19 patient and transferred it to BBIL early in May. The firm then used it to work on developing an “inactivated” vaccine — a vaccine that uses the dead virus — at its high-containment facility in Hyderabad. “Once the vaccine is injected into a human, it has no potential to infect or replicate, since it is a killed virus. It just serves to the immune system as a dead virus and mounts an antibody response towards the virus,” said the company, adding that inactivated vaccines usually have a proven safety record. Phase 1 and 2 were conducted on 800 Indians and phase 3 is underway with 25k registered participants and it has proven to meet safety requirements and also noted to have produced a robust immune response. Their efficacy data should be out in the next 2-3 months, as they are undergoing a very large phase 3 clinical trial. This vaccine has been given ***restricted access for emergency use*** so they will have to conduct any further vaccination like their clinical trials until full approval is granted. [src](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-what-is-covaxin-indias-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-how-long-before-approval-6483553/) \n\nTypical side effects:  Use of chloroquine and corticosteroids may impair antibody response. In addition, some mild symptoms like injection site pain, headache, fatigue, fever, body ache, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, giddiness-dizziness, tremor, sweating, cold, cough and injection site sweating may occur. \n\n# Largest vaccination drive\n\nIndia is set to begin the world's largest vaccination drive, here's how it will unroll. \n\nThe Government of India has procured a total of 1.65 crore doses of Covishield and Covaxin. In the first phase of vaccination health and frontline workers are to be given highest priority and the entire cost of vaccination in the first phase will be borne by the GOI fully. SII is selling at 200/- per dose to GOI, while a single vial costs 1000/- to private buyers. Bharat Biotech is selling at 206/- per dose to government, while their private market cost is yet to be announced as it has not been approved fully. [src](https://www.businessinsider.in/india/news/india-will-begin-its-covid-19-vaccination-drive-tomorrow-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/articleshow/80281740.cms)\n\nA whooping 3 crore health, frontline workers to be vaccinated over the next few months, \n\nPhase 1 plan: \n\n1. Healthcare workers: 1 crore population\n2. Frontline workers: 2 crore population\n3. People above 50 years age: 50 crore population\n4. People below 50 years with chronic illness: 1 crore population\n\nMoH [guidelines](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/india-ready-for-coronavirus-vaccination-drive-60-crore-vaccine-shots-100-people-per-session-11607855911412.html) for managing the logistics for largest vaccination drive. \n\n**3 lakh** health care workers to be vaccinated on Day 1 i.e January 16th 2020. There are a total of 3,000 sites for vaccination currently, while it is expected to go up to 5,000 in the next few weeks. Each vaccination site will have five team members and one vaccinator. Further vaccination data plan is yet to be released and based on the information from first phase, changes and priorities will be set accordingly. \n\n**Hotline - 1075 for 24/7 vaccination concerns.**\n\n**App:** [**Co-Win App**](https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/cowin-app-to-be-used-for-covid-19-vaccine-in-india-how-to-register-documents-required-and-everything-you-need-to-know/articleshow/80110700.cms) **for 24/7 vaccination concerns.** \n\n# Do's and Dont's issued by Health ministry: \n\n* The vaccine will be administered to people above 18 years of age. \n* Pregnant women, lactating mothers and those unsure of pregnancy have been advised to avoid the vaccination shot. \n* The vaccines are not interchangeable. Both the vaccine doses have to be administered from the same manufacturer. \n* The time duration between the two doses of the vaccine is 14 days.\n*  People with a history of an allergic reaction to a previous dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, who have an immediate allergic reaction to vaccines or injectable therapies, pharmaceutical products, and food items will also not be given the vaccine. \n\n# How to Register?\n\nThe government will be soon launching its official mobile app CoWin developed to monitor the COVID-19 vaccine delivery across India and enable people to register to get the vaccine. Once the CoWIN app is launched, one can download the app, submit any one of the twelve photo-identity documents such as voter card, Aadhaar, driving license, among others to register and for verification of beneficiary at session site to ensure that the intended person is vaccinated. Following online registration, the beneficiary will receive an SMS on the due date, place and time of their vaccination. The CoWin app will also give reminders for the second dose, helps one to reschedule the vaccination and report any adverse events. A unique health ID will be generated for each vaccine beneficiary in the CoWIN system, to help the government keep track. A QR code-based digital certificate will be sent via the application to those who have been administered both doses of the coronavirus vaccine.  No registration is required for healthcare workers.\n\n***Is data on Co-Win safe:***  The CoWin platform collects individual information and keeps a digital record on who gets vaccinated by whom, when and which vaccine. The Centre is asking states to urge the beneficiaries to seed their current mobile number with Aadhaar for registration and consequent communication through SMS. This is also to weed out proxies. CoWIN is an extension of the electronic vaccine intelligence network eVIN, the cloud-based IT solution platform that's been built to provide real-time feedback of vaccine stocks, power outages, temperature fluctuations, etc. To protect privacy, the data sets did not include names of any stakeholders or any other information that would allow identification of respondents. All physical copies of filled questionnaires and field notes were kept secure and confidential. All electronic data is stored on a password-protected computer while backup of all data and analysis reports has been stored on an external encrypted hard drive. However, there are some concerns about privacy and data protection.

Only after safety is established phase one is considered done. Vaccines passing this  are only allowed to be entered phase 2.\n\nPhase 2 : Ensures that vaccines cause an antibody response, this ensures that vaccine work. After the data is unblinded in this phase, it gets established that vaccine produces antibody titlers in the body i.e vaccines work. If a vaccine generates no immune response it fails the phase 2. It is interesting that after phase 2 the vaccine makers and have good idea about vaccine efficacy although for a small sample size.\n\nThere are various instances where vaccines got emergency aproval after phase 2 trials were established like zika outbreak.\n\nPhase 3 : This phase ensures that vaccine efficacy for large population groups and is considered a good benchmarks for vaccine efficacy. Generally phase 3 trials last for 1 to 2 years but for covid outbreak this has been fast tracked.\n\nPoint to remember same vaccine can have different efficiency for different population groups case in point the Chinese vaccine going in trials for brazil.\n\nHope this would have helped in determining that covaxin approval is correct or not. \nImmunology is a fascinating thing follow covid19 sub for some amazing discussions."<br />Author: 'iAmNotThatGuyJeez'  id: 'kyff80'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kyff80/regarding_covaxin_approval_and_some_info_going/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Couldn't post it in Indian_Academia, as it may not fit there. But would be grateful for any help/guidance. Serious."<br />Body: "Context -\n24 yr old now(recently).\nWas good at studies and sports. Then my dad died because of his toxic parents/relatives and some of his own decisions when I was in 10th.\nI died as well, mentally. ADHD/Depression/OCD/BPD/Suicidal.\nRecently came out of it in 2019-2020.\nI still have serious anxiety and etc, as now it is kinda ingrained in my head that everyone is better than me, or has become better than me in the time that I wasted(2012-2020).\nFeels like my life is done for.\n\nPassed 10th(2012)- 84%\n12th(2015) - 55% (PCM,CS, Eng)\n\nDidn't know anything about colleges, what to look for, what course to choose for and didn't want to waste another year within the same toxicity my dad had to and left my mom in it, to a tier-3 college in Rajasthan for a B.tech ECE, which is still continuing as I've backlogs. \n\nNo friends/seniors/mentors.\nNo experience, no internships, which I should've done but didn't/couldn't because of mental health issues. I don't/didn't like b.tech(maybe because of the environment of that area/students/teachers and/or my own shortcomings), figured in second year of it but couldn't leave as I was told not to and to continue.\nWanted to do a language course at JNU back then.\n\nNow when I see people, I feel more than left behind by time, like wtf was I doing.\nJust get any job of 10-15k and give govt attempts. I had made my mind to just get a job of whatever pay and invest whatever I get sensibly, live a conservative life and die. \n\nBut I want to give my life another shot, if there is, because I constantly feel like I betrayed my mom's faith/belief in me. Because of that, I don't want any responsibility of marriage/child etc.\n\n\n\nQuestion - I want to go into teaching line, after I clear the backlogs. One teacher suggested that this field is not good and not to enter it. Is it true?\n\n\nBut what options do I have with the above credentials or what field can I go to now?\n\n I thought about :\n\n1. doing a B.A/M.A in economics/psychology, or any cultural language. But job perspective, I don't know.\n\n2. to learn from scratch the software engg field(coding languages, testing tools etc) and get a job in that even if it takes time, 1-3 yrs, and get a side job till then.\n\n3. Do a b.ed and go in teaching line (special ed, pgt, tgt), by either in private schools or give govt exams, and give tuitions as well.\n\n4. Get any job of any pay between 15-20k and freelance by side content writer or any small skills which pay.\n\nBecause it feels/felt like I can do things if I just know what is it I am fit for at this point of time, even in this situation but I do get that from friends/people etc that I don't have time for any course now. And/Or that I won't get admission to any good college anyway. Just look for a job. And I kinda agree because I don't know what I want to or should do.\n\n\nIt may sound like a rant or I dont know. But I would really really appreciate and be grateful for any of you experienced ones to guide me into any good direction on what should I do now, to the point that I will pay you to help me. Insensible, but dead desperate, to the point of fighting suicidal thoughts often, again."<br />Author: 'reddittorunknown'  id: 'kxijir'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kxijir/couldnt_post_it_in_indian_academia_as_it_may_not/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'If there were even traces of something like "Love Jihad" happening in India from the Hindu side, the liberal media would never stop talking about it.'<br />Body: 'The heading of my post is not based on some rhetoric. I\'ve strong reasons to believe that if Hindus would have been doing something like love jihad, the liberal media won\'t shut up about it. Case in point, the mob lynchings of Muslims. In last three years, India saw 18 cases of mob lynchings over beef issue, and not all of these lynchings were even committed against Muslims, yet liberal media constantly kept talking about it as if Muslims were being lynched the moment they were stepped out of their houses. Again, I\'m not defending the lynchings here in any way, but 18 cases in 2/3 years is far from being an epidemic. \n\nSince, by the liberal logic, we already established that 18 cases in the span of two to three years is a number big enough to call it as a widespread crime committed at an "alarming impunity" (quoting a liberal media house), consider this:\n\nHere is an article from Indian Express after one month of anti-conversion law passed in Uttar Pradesh: https://indianexpress.com/article/india/love-jihad-law-up-police-7124001/lite/\n\nOnce you look past the heading and actually read the article, there are 14 such cases reported in a span of a month. Even if you consider half of them as fake and believe the women recorded their statements under the pressure of their families/police, it still leaves you with 7. 2 cases being literally filed by the women themselves. Even if I go with this extreme example of only two cases being actual complaints, that\'s two cases in one month from a single state. That\'s about 24 cases from a single year from one state only. If lynchings of Muslims was an epidemic, this one is an epidemic on a far larger scale. You\'ve to be willfully blind in order to not acknowledge that this specific problem where Hindu girls are being targeted by Muslim men doesn\'t exist, yet the liberal media, and liberal in general have such a hard time believing this. The sheer number of people who want to call it a conspiracy theory among liberal circles is overwhelming, even on the face of such compelling evidence. Now, I\'m no way saying that passing an anti-conversion law like UP did is the way to go about this, but people who bring up how the law promotes vigilantism (which i agree with) don\'t even acknowledge that a problem like love jihad even exist. \n\nWhich brings me to my larger point, and I feel like I\'m preaching to the choir here when I say this, since I\'m sure lot of people on this subreddit already know this:\n\nLiberas in India don\'t care about crimes/atrocities committed against Hindus. It\'s sidelined, ignored, and nobody talks about it. In fact, the crimes against Hindus aren\'t even believed to be real. And this attitude from liberals and liberal media, who btw portrays them as non-partisan and crusader of truth, pushes a normal Hindu towards something bit more to the right than I\'d like them to be, since they\'re the only group who are talking about it, and this is sad and everything about this bothers me.'<br />Author: 'lookingformomma'  id: 'kx6gwk'<br />Score:85<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kx6gwk/if_there_were_even_traces_of_something_like_love/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How I got most of my contacts to switch to Signal Messenger'<br />Body: " \n\nI guess everyone here is aware about Whatsapp's privacy intrusions and its new Terms of Service from February. Signal Messenger is an open source, secure and non profit messenger service that does not use your private data. Moreover, it has most of the features from Whatsapp and is easy to use. Even Telegram requires acccess to data(lesser than Whatsapp but still)\n\nI have always been apprehensive of apps using my private data for ad targeting etc. But when the new terms of service for Whatsapp were announced, it was the final straw. I decided to move to Signal messenger. I detail below how I got more than 90 percent(and counting) of my contacts to move to equivalent Signal groups. The major difficulty is in getting people to overcome their inertia to transition.\n\n1. Share articles and make people aware of cons of Whatsapp and pros of Signal.\n2. Create Signal groups of all your Whatsapp groups and start inviting/adding people. At first I was on the persuasive side for getting people to install signal by saying data privacy etc and as more people started doing it, I started more aggressive campaigning.\n3. After some people had joined the signal group, I started getting those people to leave the Whatsapp groups. In the groups where I was the admin, I asked for permission on the signal group and started removing them from the Whatsapp group. This puts pressure on those who had not joined signal, and they too started switching. **Creating pressure and momentum is essential. Only when people see that others have started switching and leaving the Whatsapp groups, will they start moving too. This cannot be done if everyone joins signal and remains on whatsapp too.**\n\nAt the end of this, more than 90 percent of my contacts from active whatsapp groups have moved to Signal. The corresponding Signal groups are now active while the Whatsapp ones are turning empty as people leave. Hopefully, all would have transitioned to Signal by February.\n\nSignal as the preferred messenger will only be succesful if people leave Whatsapp and join it. If they remain on both, Whatsapp will win. As Whatsapp/Facebook steps up its game of ads and data collection, Signal so far is our best hope of retaining our data privacy.\n\n**I have no financial interests in promotion of Signal, just personal privacy interests. Only if people start using Signal, my self interest of a private messenger will be successful.**\n\nPlease share this around on reddit/twitter etc freely.

      <li>Title::: 'The Nyāya Sutra - Introduction'<br />Body: 'Millennia ago, even before Socrates taught the Greek world to question everything and to know themselves, there emerged in India a movement of rational thought that made deep inroads into the culture of the time. This movement was simply known as *Hetu Vidyā* (हेतु विद्या), or The Study of Reason.\n\nPeople did not like Hetu Vidyā from day one, and even as great a figure as *Dvaipāyana Vyāsa*, the author of the *Mahābhārata*, was deeply opposed to it. *Hetu Vidyā* involved several things which people did not - or rather, *could* not - accept at the time. It involved questioning the *Vedas,* questioning the existence of God and the *devas*, and so on. It did not help that *Hetu Vidyā* was a fundamentally absurd study, with no system and no standard, and not much of a ruleset. Most people found it so chaotic that they decided that nothing good would ever come out of it, and this led to a general sense of animosity to the subject.\n\nWhat complicated matters further was that there were many schools of thought, each of which was known as a *tantra* (तन्त्र). These did not agree on common axioms and results, and they argued ceaselesly among themselves, committing common fallacies of reasoning, since there was no one to tell them what the fallacies of reasoning were and how to avoid them.\n\nAnd then, one man changed it all.\n\n*Maharshi Gautama Akshapāda* was born in Mithila, modern day Bihar, on the banks of the river *Kshirodadhi*. Over time, he came to settle in what is now known as Godnā, a small village at the confluence of the Gangā and the Sarāyu, and eventually retired to Kaṭhiyāwar in Gujarat, on the Sea Coast. His time of living is understood to be contemporary to *Jātukarna*, a Vyāsa of prominence in his day. This was approximated in 1913 to have been about 550 BC, about a century before Socrates of Athens.\n\n*Maharshi Gautama* began the study of *Hetu Vidyā*, and with time he was completely lost in the science. He would spend so much of his time reasoning, that it is rumoured that on one occassion he was engrossed in his reasoning and logic as he walked, and in his absent-mindedness he fell into a deep hole which had been dug in the ground. There had then been much hassle in bringing him back out.\n\nOver time, he formulated a set of rules of thought. Powered by these rules, reasoning was finally brought into a systematic form, and it was possible for the first time for  logicians to really discuss logic, without being lost in dialogue and reasoning in circles and committing fallacies. These rules came to be known by a very special name - they came to be known as The Rules, or *Nyāya*. And the branch of logic that began with strict adherence to these rules of thought, which avoided fallacies and resolved confusion through systematic dialogue, came to be known as *Tarka-Shāstra* or *Vāda-Shāstra*, the study of Argument of Dialogue. This is essentially our word for logic.\n\n*Nyāya*, as the more perceptive of my readers will notice, is also the name of the oldest orthodox school of Hinduism (i.e., the oldest *darshana)*. This is not coincidence. *Maharshi Gautama Akshapāda* is the founder of *the* *Nyāya* school, the very *Darshana* itself. And it was first standardized in his most valuable composition, the *Nyāyasutra*.\n\nI have been reading the *Nyāyasutra* for a time now, and they have been very enlightening. I have decided that I ought to share the wisdom of the great *Rishi*, and I am going to do it in a series of posts on this subreddit, beginning with this one. I am going to establish the key ideas of the *Nyāya* epistemology, its metaphysics, its value systems, and I am going to do it with the *Nyāya Sutras* of *Gautama* as my basis. My aim is two-fold: First, to establish that there was a very systematic form of logical analysis in this country *long* before any Western intervention, in other words, India had a genuine logical system since ancient times, and one that, in many ways, is better than the Greek one. My second aim is to present a system of reasoning which, if studied, can help give clarity of thought and reasoning to the reader. I have gained sight at the feet of *Akshapāda*, and I would like to present his method of critical thinking to all of you.\n\nIn this age of lies, opinionated loudmouths, paid news media which lie on behalf of their patrons, shameless publication of irreproducible results in "scientific" journals, self-proclaimed "intellectuals" who are utterly ignorant of what they discuss, and a confused public with voting rights, the critical thinking that *Nyāya* affords is the most liberating thing there is.\n\n## The Sixteen Components\n\nIf you are to study *Nyāya*, it is a good idea to know your syllabus. There are, according to Nyāyasutra 1:1:1 (the very first Sutra!), *sixteen* components of *Nyāya*. Knowing these sixteen things earns you **Supreme Felicitation as an Epistemologist** (तत्वज्ञानात् निश्ष्रेयस). In this post, I will simply number them below. From the next post onwards, we will begin a discussion on them. My discussion will be adapted for modern readers, but I will nevertheless stay as loyal to the original presentation of the method in the Sutras as I can.\n\n1. The means of acquiring Right Knowledge,  or *Pramāṇa* (प्रमाण)\n2. The objects of Right Knowledge, or *Prameya* (प्रमेय)\n3. Doubt, or *Samshaya* (संशय)\n4. Purpose, or *Prayojana* (प्रयोजन)\n5. Familiar knowledge, or *Drishṭānta* (दृष्टान्त)\n6. Theorem, or *Siddhānta* (सिद्धान्त)\n7. The *components* of a logical argument, or *Avayava* (अवयव)\n8. Argument, or *Tarka* (तर्क)\n9. Resolution of an argument, or *Nirṇaya* (निर्णय)\n10. Discussion / Debate / Dialogue, or *Vāda* (वाद)\n11. Wrangling, or *Jalpa* (जल्प)\n12. Cavil / Fault-finding, or *Viṭaṇḍā* (वितण्डा)\n13. Logical fallacy, or *Hetvābhāsa* (हेत्वाभास)\n14. Trickery, or *Chhala* (छल)\n15. Futility, or *Jāti* (जाति)\n16. Occassion for rebuke, or *Nigrahasthāna*, (निग्रहस्थान)\n\nIf you want to hop into the study of the *Nyāyasutra*, here is a link to a scanned PDF of a 1913 translation and commentary on the text by various scholars of Sanskrit at the time: [The Nyaya Sutras of Gautama.pdf](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/605710614496804876/798543061336326144/Nyaya_Sutras_of_Gautama.pdf)\n\nIt is my personal textbook and reference.\n\n## The Spiritual Views of Maharshi Gautama\n\n*Nyāya* was not a nihilistic system. Early practitioners of the Nyāya system were very clear in their idea of the purpose in life. In Nyāyasutra 1:1:2 (the verse immediately after the syllabus), *Maharshi Gautama* establishes his views on life, afterlife, and the purpose of life.\n\nThe *Nyāyika* (practitioners of this *darshana*) believed that the end goal of *Nyāya* is to be freed from *dukkha*, or suffering. This is achieved, according to *Nyāya*, by first annihilating four things in order: Misapprehension (मिथ्याज्ञान), or the ignorance formed from false beliefs and ideas, Faults (दोष), Activity (प्रवृत्ति) and then Birth (जन्म). Maharshi Gautama and his followers believed in reincarnation, which they called *pretyabhāva* (प्रेत्यभाव). This was a serious belief in their minds, and they were very dedicated in their search for final release from suffering, which they called *apavarga* (अपवर्ग).\n\nIn the *Nyāya* system of thought, birth occured because the Self was unfulfilled, and this unfulfillment caused it suffering. Only its fulfillment can lead to the end of the ceaseless Sufferings of life. However, they also did not believe that there was any pleasure in release. It is, to the *Nyāyika*, a final release from both pleasure and pain. And it can only come when the knowledge and understanding of the world is complete.\n\nEssentially, they believed that all our actions are motivated by the desire for something, and what we ultimately desire is the experience of something. This desire for experience is ultimately a desire for knowledge, and this desire vanishes upon the acquisition of knowledge. Thus, Right Knowledge, or truth, is the Ultimate Goal of life. And upon acquiring this goal, we cease our reincarnation, having found complete tranquility.\n\nThis is a lot similar to a later philosophical system which emerged in Greece, created by a mathematician named Plato. Plato, however, did not accept reincarnation. Instead, he believed that Philosophy is ultimately a way to slowly die, as your understanding of this world, which he regarded as False, would be replaced by the immersion of your mind into what he called *Eidos*, or the essential idea of things. However, *Nyāya* sees in the acquisition of knowledge not a means to Death, but a means out of what the *Kathopanishada* calls the ceaseless cycle of birth and death, which again and again brings the Self into the clutches of *Yamarāja*.\n\nThis means that the students of *Nyāya* were not simply logicians for the sake of logic. They were not simply trying to be nasty to religious people when they approached life with an attitude of thorough skepticism. Instead, they were dutifully dedicated to discovering Truth, which they called Right Knowledge. In this quest for Truth, they saw a spiritual quest and a sense of purpose. Their curiosity was not just an idle engagement of the mind, but to them, curiosity was a deep and purposeful calling of the soul for its fulfillment.\n\nIn short, the followers of *Nyāya* can be relied upon, if for nothing else, then at least for being honest and thorough in the never-ending quest for truth. They were deeply honest in their inquiry, and their methods were forged in the heat of their curiosity, shaped by their soulful engagement in the mission to seek, find, and learn the Truth.\n\nAnd that\'s enough for the introductory post, I think. I will continue this in the following posts, which I will name "**The Nyāya Sutra - 1. The Means of Acquiring Right Knowledge**".

You can join this for free and earn very little amount or you can add Rs 200 and unlock the first level ans make around 10-30 everyday. Now the thing about this is that you cannot unlock higher levels unless you invite more people. Like you cannot just invest and earn you and you have to invite and earn to unlock levels. This takes time and energy. \n\nHere is the chart of how it works.. \n\nhttps://ibb.co/hcbyrj4\n\nBut the good thing about this app is it is risk free...it is not like gambling. You don't lose money. \nYou can jusr stay with the first level and place 30 order every day as beginner it takes 3-6 minutes. And you can make small money and keep the money flowing. \n\nI am being honest because I don't think it would be fair to be dishonest and create a scam. \n\nSo if any of you guys are interested you can pm me and I will share the link with you. This way I can earn higher commissions by inviting you and you can make some money too even if it is as little as paying for your electricity or grocery. It isn't that bad ✨\n\nPm me if you have questions thanks.\n\nYou can go for the free experience for 3 days and see how it works and if you are interested for the other levels you can join to unlock the access to higher rooms and higher commissions and rewards for inviting other people..I will walk you through it.\n You have to also invite people after you earn a certain amount you cannot just invest without unlocking the levels with out invitation. It is slow and takes work but the best is you make some money everyday . This can even compensate for little things like grocery , travel or electricity stuff like that and two minutes of clicking on your phone you got nothing to lose. Until you use it you will see it's safe and maybe slow but very safe to use as a beginner.\n\nYou can also join my watsapp group and find other conversations to see how that works.

      <li>Title::: 'Why I Love India'<br />Body: 'So, the title is quite self-explanatory, this is basically just me explaining why I am so fascinated by India.\n\nI decided to do this since I have way too much free time right now (thank you Corona), and the reactions I got from some people on my last post about India were rather curious, many people did agree with what I said but they did not understand how come I knew so much about India or why I was interested in the country, some people for some odd reason even thought I was an Indian trying to pass off as a Westerner.\n\nI even got some (very nice and kind) private messages enquiring about my interest in India and how come I seemed to know so much about it (although I consider my knowledge of India to be very superficial).Heck some of you guys were so nice you even offered to show me around India should I ever visit.Thank you so much!\n\nFor those of you who do not know about that post, you can either search it here on this sub, under the title "We Westerners must stop demonising India" or you can go to my profile and search through my posts.There aren\'t many, so you will find it immediately\n\nWell, there are quite a few reasons, but it has mostly to do with my upbringing, curiosity, political views, life experience and cultural exposure.\n\n1) Before moving to Germany I did grow up in Portugal, and Indian pop culture, mostly Bollywood films are quite popular there, as surprising as it may seem.\n\nBollywood was and remains mostly popular with my parents\' generation, so those born in the 60\'s and 70\'s, however I can assure you that their impact is felt even today.I\'m only 25, and even girls in my age range say how they want to have long beautiful hair like Indian actresses.\n\nSo, as a result, back when I was a child I would watch Indian films with my parents.In fact, the first film I remember watching with my mum was Nagina with Sridevi.\n\nMy childhood was a bit rough, so watching these films were some of my best memories since they bring me back to times of joy.\n\nMy mum still watches these films today. Back in the days she\'d go buy them at the street markets as cassettes for the VHR.\n\nThese films presented India as a colourful country, full of energy, joy, dance, music, sensual people, exotic spiritual beliefs and a rich culture.\n\nThis idea got stuck in me even to this day, so even when I watch bad news about India, my idea of the country as a magical place never vanishes.\n\n2) India is unfairly maligned because of our media bias.  \n\n\nWe keep seeing how our media portrays India as an intolerant, racist and whatever hell hole.  \nThis in spite of the fact that in India there are over 20 protected languages, the muslim population keeps breeding like rabbits (as they do everywhere), LGBT rights have received more support and visibility over the years and so on.  \n\n\nThis stems from the fact that, and I gotta get into politics and religion a bit here, for some reason muslims are treated as a somehow "sacred" minority by Western media, one that must never be criticised nor analysed. Muslims are to always be protrayed as victims, kind spiritual people, etc...  \n\n\nSo it\'s easy to blame Hindus and Indic culture for everything they go through, instead of outright admitting that there is an issue with the majority of muslims valuing their religion more than the countries they should be loyal to.  \n\n\nMy life experience and interactions with muslims in the West have shown me that most of them are not grateful for the opportunities they have and behave like spoiled and entitled brats, if they can do this here, then I can only imagine how they behave in India, a country where they represent 14% of the overall population.  \n\n\nThe BBC has called claims of "Love Jihad" a conspiracy theory, well, from my experience, meeting women who went through relations with such men, it\'s not a conspiracy theory, also, let\'s not forget that the BBC is a British broadcaster... They suck at reporting on muslim crimes.  \n\n\nRemember the Rotherham sex scandal after all? When all those little girls were sexually abused by muslims for years, but no one spoke about it, and those that did were accused of racism back then?Google it, so you will know it.  \n\n\nAlso to note, that as a gay progressive man I am more supportive of Hinduism despite being very secular, since it is the only major religion that can trully be said to be inclusive and accepting of diverse genders, sexualities and so on.  \n\n\nWhy should I attack the only major religion that doesn\'t treat me like a monster? That\'s like spitting on the face of someone who is kind enough to open a door for you.  \n\n\nThis is one more reason to support India!  \n\n\n3) Our upperclass is often biased against "Paganism"  \n\n\nI had catholic class (once a week) back in Portugal, and our teacher spoke kindly of christianity, islam and so on... but during a lesson on world religions, in which he had to mention the many different major beliefs in the world, he took this stance on Hinduism "It\'s not really a religion, it\'s a form of paganism that somehow survived until this day."  \n\n\nAnd while he welcomed in class a missionary who went to Africa and such to spread catholicism, and spoke kindly of those who converted, he considered Europeans who converted to Hinduism to be crazy.  \n\n\nThis opened my eyes to the bias that Hindus still have to go through nowadays, and that only increased my resolve in siding with Hindus when they wish to protect their culture from outside influence.  \n\n\n4) India\'s culture, religion and history are fascinating, why not protect them?  \n\n\nI am tired that patriotism is being confused with racism!  \nBeing proud of your culture, wanting to celebrate your religious festivals, dressing up in your national dresses, and emphasising your own heritage rather than that of invaders is NOT racism, it is an open celebratin of who you are, your identity and the accomplishments of your ancestors.  \n\n\nThe same left-leaning media that is constantly telling us how multiculturalism is wonderful is the exact same one that is destryoing beautiful cultures in favour of conformity, political correctness and islamism.  \n\n\nI am tired of seeing and experience here in Europe, how we are basically bowing down to PC culture and islamists.  \nGlad to see a nation that does not fall into the same mistakes as we have!  \n\n\n5) I\'ve always been much of a nerd, I love studying and learning about ancient cultures and the world diversity and so on.  \nIndia is just so awesome, how could someone not love a nation with such diverse nature, fascinating national clothes, deep spirituality and diversity of tongues?!  \nIndia has more diversity as a single country than the whole of Europe!\n\n6) Not really about loving India, but I just want to let out how much I hate Congress!  \n\n\nI mean seriously, how dare congress defend the whole triple talaq thing and so on?!  \nThey are just like so called liberal parties here in Europe! Claim to stand for social justice, feminism and gay rights, and then side with the exact oppose of those causes!  \n\n\nThey are a shameful stain in your country if you ask me!  \n\n\nAnyway, to all the kind Indians who last got in touch with me, thanks, I promise that should the chance arise I\'d love to visit your beautiful country and meet you up!  \n\n\nOverall the struggle of European and Indian patriots is the same. We are being told to be ashamed of our glorious cultures while praising primitive ones!  \n\n\nWe must stand together brothers!  \n\n\nI hope you are all well, and I send you all my love!'<br />Author: 'EmmanuelDeLaRiviere'  id: 'kuzn31'<br />Score:109<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kuzn31/why_i_love_india/</li>

Guess I won\'t be conforming to this because you can\'t say these things in "real life".\n\nThese days if you talk about gender discrimination, the gender gets replaced with "female discrimination" and talking about men in this context has become taboo.\n\nI talked to my brother about this, he has already done a bit of research on this topic and said "I\'ll think about it when it becomes my problem". I asked him "when will you know it has become your problem ?".\n\nI\'ll list down these questions I asked him and hopefully, you\'ll understand the depth of this problem. There are three primary problems I\'ve come across so far\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Discriminatory Hiring Practices**\n\nWill it become your problem when you apply for a job which you\'re more qualified for, has more experience with and has better portfolio, but the company chooses someone instead of you, based on the gender ?\n\nSource: More anecdotal evidence of "Women only job roles" in tech. But here\'s the more public James Damore case perfectly summed up by the one who betrayed him:\n\n[https://np.reddit.com/r/JamesDamore/comments/adpj0h/i\\_helped\\_google\\_screw\\_over\\_james\\_damore/](https://np.reddit.com/r/JamesDamore/comments/adpj0h/i_helped_google_screw_over_james_damore/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*   **Biased Gender roles**\n\nWill it become your problem that when you or your boy scored higher than someone in an engineering exam and is denied a seat in a college because that someone belongs to category of "women" or some other caste ?\n\nSource: basic problems with reservations, [https://www.entrancezone.com/engineering/jee-main-seats-reservation-2020/](https://www.entrancezone.com/engineering/jee-main-seats-reservation-2020/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*  **Biased Laws And Social Stigma**\n\nWhen you are falsely accused of domestic violence and treated "Guilty until proved Innocent", destroying your life, carrier and respect without any repercussion on the false accuser ?\n\nSource: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1\\_2gl7lz25E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_2gl7lz25E), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6437789/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6437789/),\n\nOne case of many: [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/apology-accepted-in-fake-rape-case-hc-quashes-fir/articleshow/79632105.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/apology-accepted-in-fake-rape-case-hc-quashes-fir/articleshow/79632105.cms)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I present my views. Who am I? I\'m a 24 yo male working as a software developer who is against preferential treatment and injustice.\n\n**On Jobs And Livelihood**\n\nMany strides are made to promote women/diversity in men dominated fields (including discriminatory hiring practices), yet no incentives are created for men to fill in women dominated roles, well paid or otherwise.

      <li>Title::: '"Gender based discrimination". When will it become your problem?'<br />Body: '"Behave   like you would in real life" reddit says, before posting. Guess I  won\'t  be conforming to this because you can\'t say these things in "real  life".\n\nThese days if you talk   about gender discrimination, the gender gets replaced with "female   discrimination" and talking about men in this context has become taboo.\n\nI   talked to my brother about this, he has already done a bit of research   on this topic and said "I\'ll think about it when it becomes my  problem".  I asked him "when will you know it has become your problem  ?".\n\nI\'ll  list down these  questions I asked him and hopefully, you\'ll understand  the depth of  this problem. There are three primary problems I\'m come  across so far\n\n1. **Discriminatory Hiring Practices**\n\nWill   it become your problem when you apply for a job which you\'re more   qualified for, has more experience with and has better portfolio, but   the company chooses someone instead of you, based on the gender ?\n\nSource: More anecdotal evidence of "Women only job roles". But here\'s the public James Damore case perfectly summed up:\n\n[https://np.reddit.com/r/JamesDamore/comments/adpj0h/i\\_helped\\_google\\_screw\\_over\\_james\\_damore/](https://np.reddit.com/r/JamesDamore/comments/adpj0h/i_helped_google_screw_over_james_damore/)\n\n**2.  Biased Gender roles**\n\nWill   it become your problem that when you or your boy scored higher than   someone in an engineering exam and is denied a seat in a college because   that someone belongs to category of "women" or some other caste ?\n\nSource: [https://www.entrancezone.com/engineering/jee-main-seats-reservation-2020/](https://www.entrancezone.com/engineering/jee-main-seats-reservation-2020/)\n\n**3. Biased Laws And Social Stigma**\n\nWhen   you are falsely accused of domestic violence and treated "Guilty until   proved Innocent", destroying your life, carrier and respect without  any  repercussion on the false accuser ?\n\nSource: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1\\_2gl7lz25E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_2gl7lz25E), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6437789/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6437789/),\n\nOne case of many: [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/apology-accepted-in-fake-rape-case-hc-quashes-fir/articleshow/79632105.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/apology-accepted-in-fake-rape-case-hc-quashes-fir/articleshow/79632105.cms)\n\nBefore   I present my views. Who am I? I\'m a 24 yo male working as a software   developer who is against preferential treatment and injustice.\n\n**On Jobs And Livelihood**\n\nMany   strides are made to promote women/diversity in men dominated fields   (including discriminatory hiring practices), yet no incentives are   created for men to fill in women dominated roles, well paid or   otherwise. Why is this an issue ?\n\nThe   pie that we are all aiming for (I\'m mostly aware of engineering so   that\'s what I\'ll talk about) is not growing at a rate for everyone to   have a piece of it. I had to drop 2 years after 12th to crack JEE Main   and get into a good college. I can say I have some idea on the effort   that it takes.
