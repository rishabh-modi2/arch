I heard people are using publicly shared google sheets to know if the store is crowded or not. But it is sometimes hard for small shops to have a computer with them. That is why my friend and I came up with an idea for people to use it over the phone, a very basic interface to click the plus or minus buttons to show how many are there in the store currently.\n\nIf you are a store owner, I suggest you use it to help your customers know your crowd before they leave their homes. If you are a customer, please share the website with the shop owner you go to daily.\n\nDemo: [https://nearbyopen.com/demo.gif](https://nearbyopen.com/demo.gif)\n\nHere's the link to the website: [https://nearbyopen.com](https://nearbyopen.com/)\n\nJust a small effort to support fellow Indians in this crisis situation.\n\nBarath Mata ki Jai.

They're only ruining the futures of the children."<br />Body: 'Seeing my teenage brother doing "questions" on Byjus, Vedantu, playing maths "games" makes me sad. He will get addicted to these in no time. I don\'t remember going to coaching classes, using internet for my studies and I went to all average UP board Hindi medium and CBSE hindi then english medium schools with average teachers and I still got 95% in 10th and 12th science in 2014. My brother on the other hand is on YouTube "learning" then Byjus then Vedantu. I cringe when I see their advertisements on TV. Kids and teenagers are prone to distractions. Their young minds will get addicted to "online learning" which is rubbish, complete rubbish. You still have to read NCERT, go to actual coaching for competitions and actually solve questions. The Byjus teachers "showing Pythagoras theorem with animation". This is not a western country. Indian education system has not changed in ages. A child will open Byjus to "study" and in no time he will be on Facebook or YouTube. \n\nYou cannot blame him. When even adults cannot control themselves, then how will the children do? I also see the youngest cousins of mine watching Doraemon on YouTube all the time. I can only imagine what will happen to their brains when they grow up. But for now, the current teenagers should read from books. ignore the online drama. They are themselves loser teachers now making videos to misguide the young students for money. Khan Academy is good if you\'re in USA, let\'s say, but in India with cutthroat competition and the same old book copy exams.... it is a failure, complete disaster.

This was a big PR disaster for the Tablighi Jamaat people as they faced wrath of multiple south eastern countries who were affected by this. This single event spread the virus to dozens of countries. This is not a news anyone in that group can "miss" as it affected them so much. I am sure every single Tablighi Jamaat person who was in Delhi event knew about this.\n\nDespite the outbreak, Tablighi Jammat organised a second international mass gathering on 18 March in Gowa Regency near Makassar in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Though the organisers initially rebuffed official directives to cancel the gathering, they subsequently complied and cancelled the gathering.\n\nNizamuddin faction of the Tablighi Jamaat held a religious congregational program in Nizamuddin West, Delhi from 13 to 15 March 2020 before pan-India lockdown was announced which was attended by several foreign speakers and over 500 members. It is suspected that some of these speakers were infected by the Coronavirus which later spread to the congregants.\n\nIn Pakistan, 36 Tableeghi Jamaat members tested positive in Hyderabad, Pakistan on 30 March. 1000s more are suspected and common people in Pakistan are ostracizing people of Tableeghi Jamaat due to fear of coronavirus.\n\nThese are the known places. It is very possible that they have infected in Bangladesh and several other countries like Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.\n\nThe thing is that even after knowing they were infected and caused such a massive problem in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonasia, two weeks later, they did a similar event in Delhi. Another bad thing is that even after knowing about this outbreak in Malaysia originating from this group, India failed to stop them from doing an event in India.\n\nHere is the NEWS about this from MARCH 12th - https://www.nst.com.my/world/world/2020/03/574064/singapore-identify-95-who-attended-malaysias-tabligh-gathering\n\nhttps://www.thejakartapost.com/seasia'<br />Author: 'Eric_Cartman-_-'  id: 'fwoa7f'<br />Score:36<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fwoa7f/just_saying/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 2.18'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : How the spirit soul/living entity is different from the material body ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "The material body is perishable by nature. It may perish immediately, or it may do so after a hundred years. It is a question of time only. There is no chance of maintaining it indefinitely. But the spirit soul is so minute that it cannot even be seen by an enemy, to say nothing of being killed. As mentioned in the previous verse, it is so small that no one can have any idea how to measure its dimension. So from both viewpoints there is no cause of lamentation because the living entity can neither be killed as he is, nor can the material body, which cannot be saved for any length of time, be permanently protected. The minute particle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his work, and therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized. In the Vedānta-sūtras the living entity is qualified as light because he is part and parcel of the supreme light. As sunlight maintains the entire universe, so the light of the soul maintains this material body. As soon as the spirit soul is out of this material body, the body begins to decompose; therefore it is the spirit soul which maintains this body. The body itself is unimportant."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 2.18, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/je8rhcvioer41.png?width=169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a84f6e8440f99bd743470ffb67aed58bcd0bd573\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

These shits have Delhi police under them but DIDN\'T gave orders to shoot at rioters. \n4. AAP ordered compensation for Muslim rioters from Waqf Board. BJP-RSS did NOTHING to help. Kapil was begging for money for Hindus on Twitter. After having central government for 6 years, these people are begging from us.\n5. What is the point of Central Govt. if Hindus are not even safe in Delhi???\n\nCovid has completely destroyed any hope I had from the BJP-RSS. 30% patients are from Tabligi Jamaat, they have spread the virus to villages in Himachal, Uttarakhand, TN. far off places with little Muslim population, which definitely would have been safe from the Virus except for the Islamic preachers.\n\nContrast the response of the Secular lobby vs the (supposedly) pro hindu lobby. \n\n1. Secular lobby has threatened News reporters, stopped people from pointing out Tabligi connection in Maha, Bengal and Tamil Nadu. Fucking TN, in that state of all CoViD cases more than 80% cases are directly connected to Tabligi Jamaat but if you point it out, you will be in JAIL. \n2. They have arrested a DOCTOR in Maharashtra for saying Tabligi Jamaat is spreading the Coronavirus. Bengal has stopped counting Covid deaths so Secular Fabric is not broken. TN  govt has filed a case against a video blogger for reporting on TJ. In that state, Hindus gods and Brahmins are regularly and safely abused in name of Freedom of Speech but FoS is not for Islam.\n3. Pawar gave a long speech yesterday shaming people for bring religion into this. They have hired random Bolly actors, PR firms to save Muslims and shame Hindus for even discussing this.\n4. There is PIL in the midst of all this for guess what? It is to stop Media from blaming Tabligis for virus. \n5. Regular attacks on police and medical staff are being brushed under the carpet. Remember how long a single lynching of one Muslim was discussed for hundreds of hours with marches and special events and here hundreds of attacks are forgotten because of our Secular Lobby.\n\nWhat about our pro Hindu lobby? \n\n1. No discussion about anything, no pointing out the nefarious and coordinated hiding of Jamaatis by normal Muslims. \n2. **RSS has given a statement yesterday and shared on Twitter saying "NOT ALL MUSLIMS ARE TO BLAME,  IT IS JUST FEW JAMAATIS"** It is the normal Muslims who hiding Jamaatis and attacking police. Why the fuck is even RSS defending Muslims? Aren\'t they supposed to be Hindu orgainzation. Yesterday, three children in Pak were BURNT ALIVE, RSS is YET TO MAKE ANY COMMENT. \n3. Secular lobby launched a disgusting "Ashamed to be a hindu" campaign after the Kathua rape case. **Where is our campaign? Why are we not shaming this hateful and medieval religion?** Why are these so called Hindutva forces not doing anything to get back at them for years of Hindu hate.\n4. Today, and this was the last straw, **BJP CM and lifetime RSS member Yeddurappa gave and official statement ORDERING us to  NOT SPEAK A WORD AGAINST MUSLIMS** and anyone WHO DOES WILL BE ARRESTED. Okay so people who are sprerading virus are in Hospitals, attacking staff, pissing, shiiting and spitting in hospital. But HINDUS WILL BE ARRESTED FOR POINTING IT OUT.\n5. Here, is a bonus one**. NGOs in Pak are not giving basic Ration to Hindus and children are being burnt alive.** How has our Hindutva Govt responded? **We will be exporting medicines to Pak to help them.** \n\nRSS and BJP are SECULAR , HONEST and NATIONALIST. They do work efficiently and honestly. But, they are not pro Hindu and they will not stop global Islam and Christianity from destroying Hinduism. Things like Ram Mandir and Kashmir issue are done by following law and are pro India biut not pro Hindu. **India will be rich and safe under BJP but Hindus are alone and have only themselves.** \n\n**BJP-RSS are like Congress of pre 1947. Commie and Islamists attack them pro Hindu but in reality, they are doing nothing for Hindu Dharma.**'<br />Author: 'anujjv51'  id: 'fwkf1v'<br />Score:99<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fwkf1v/rss_bjp_need_to_realise_and_accept_the_nature_of/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Pazhassi Raja - The Lion of Kerala #1'<br />Body: " \n\nSince Independence, the pages of our history books have not been kind to the heroes of India. Forgotten to the glorified invaders, the true heroes who never bowed down when facing adversity. **Today we will talk about a hero who might have been embedded in the folklore of Kerala but never got the recognition he deserved pan India.**\n\n**An Introduction to the great King - (Background)**\n\n**Pazhassi Raja Ji** was born on 3 January 1753 Padinjare Kovilakam (Western Branch of Royal Clan) of Purannattu Swarupam, Peralam Village, the royal clan of the kingdom of Kottayam in North Malabar in south Kerala. He was a well-trained in the arts of warfare and politics.\n\nDuring these times, the Islamic Warlord Hyder Ali wanted to take over the Malabar, now in Kerala. In 1766 he launched a brutal military invasion of Kerala which lasted for 26 years. During this invasion, Thousands of Hindus were killed. The Nair forces native of Kerala were outnumbered. Hyder Ali himself came to Malabar and ordered his troops to find and kill the Nairs. Many Nair soldiers were killed on sight and 15,000 Nair Soldiers were deported to Kanara, **only 200 of these 15,000 Soldiers survived.**\n\nTherefore, in 1766 to save the people from this brutality the many Kings and Leaders of Malabar accepted a treaty in which they had to pay hefty sums to the Mysore Kingdom of Hyder Ali. These payments were too much for the small Kingdoms of Kerala and soon the Farmers felt the brunt of excessive taxation. The Kings had no choice they could not give this much amount and in the year 1773, the Kings refused to pay the tributes. Hyder Ali with his army marched to Malabar once again. Most of the Rajas of Malabar, along with many Princes went to seek political asylum in Travancore. Princes and younger noblemen who refused to flee the invasion organized resistances.\n\nDuring this time, the Pazhassi Raja Ji had become a grown man in his twenties. His uncle Vira Varma the king of Kottayam along with other king had gone to Travancore in search of asylum. In his absence, **the Pazhassi Raja Ji had become the leading authority**. Vira’s other nephew Ravi Varma was too incompetent to play any serious political role and hence his role only was nominal. Pazhassi Raja became the most powerful figure in Kottayam, much to the chagrin of his uncle Vira Varma. Hence Vira Varma played a series of power games aiming to check the growing clout of his nephew. So the relation between Vira Varma and Pazhassi Raja was one of enmity right from the onset.\n\n**Pazhassi Raja Ji vowed to resist and defeat Hyder Ali at all cost** but the military situation was grim for him and his troops. In 1774, Coorgs (a neighbour Kingdom of Malabar) had joined hands with Hyder Ali on the promise of being gifted Wynad and a large Coorg army camped in Wynad to help Mysore troops And in 1776, Hyder Ali re-installed the Hindu Raja in Chirakkal and the latter joined Mysore war effort to crush Pazhassi Raja. This triple alliance lasted till 1780 and on many occasions tried to defeat Pazhassi Raja Ji.\n\nThe army of Hyder Ali was successful in the siege of Raja’s kingdom. Hyder Ali had control over Kottayam. But Pazhassi Raja Ji was an expert in strategical warfare. He knew that he may have not the resources and numbers the alliance had but he had the will and courage to defeat them for his motherland. To gain resources and bring down the morale of the enemy army Pazhassi RaJi Ji and his men used to frequently raid the domains of neighbouring Rajas who had accepted Hyder Ali's rule in northern Malabar and the Coorg to harass the enemy regiments posted there and he was often supported by the local population of those territories. Along with this, he had close ties with Ravi Varma and Krishna Varma, who were princes of Calicut and popular rebel leaders of southern Malabar.\n\n**Siege of Thalasseri**\n\nThalasseri (also known as Tellicherry) was a harbour-fort which was held by the British East India Company. The British produced arms and weapons in the fort using it as a factory. The weapons were also then later sold to rebels. So if Hyder could capture this fort, he could, at a stroke, cripple both the rebels in North Malabar as well as the British military which was gaining power at the regional basis.\n\nSo in 1778, Hyder's trusted, the Raja of Chirakkal, besieged Thalasseri and enforced an economic blockade under order from Hyder himself. The British planned a scheme to put pressure on Chirakkal’s army. They used their factories and armed Pazhassi Raja's men to enable them to recover Kottayam from the Mysorean Army. This move by the British ensured that the Chirakkal army was now at risk of being struck in the rear by Pazhassi Raja's force. The Chirakkal troops began to retreat, but Pazhassi chased and devastated the Chirakkal army, and then marched to Kottayam where he obliterated the Mysorean occupation and overran all of western Kottayam. But at this critical moment when the Mysorean army in Malabar could have been destroyed by a joint action on the part of the British and the Rajas, the British factories at Talassery were instructed by the Governor not to upset the nominal peace with Hyder.\n\nThus the British decision not to exploit the victory at Thalasseri was exploited by Mysore. The Chirakkal army reinforced by a Mysorean contingent under Balwant Rao marched into Kottayam. Pazhassi's men, though secretly supplied with arms and ammunition by the British, could not hold or defeat this huge host and soon the Kottayam army was forced to disperse after a fight. Then the Mysore-Chirakkal army captured Kadathanad and installed a puppet Raja who joined hands with Mysore.\n\nIn 1779, another attack on the British factories was led by the huge Mysore-Chirakkal-Kadathanad army. When Pazhassi Raja Ji cam to know about this move, he sensed the gravity of the situation and sent a force of 2000 Nairs to aid the British defence of Thalassery, since losing those factories meant losing the source of weapons and ammunition. This enabled the factories to hold on successfully.\n\nBy the end of 1779, Hyder Ali grew impatient and sent Sardar Khan, the Mysorean general to Thalasseri to bring the siege speedily to a successful conclusion. **Sardar Khan came with a force of 10,000 troops and 30 heavy guns**. Sardar Khan knew that if he wanted to gain control over Thalasseri he had to stop Pazhassi Raja since it was his help that enabled the British to resist him. Sardar Khan opened negotiations with Pazhassi Raja Ji. He offered to restore the occupied territories of Kottayam if Pazhassi Raja Ji would ally himself with Mysore and pay an immediate tribute of 500,000 rupees. Sardar khan knew that this was beyond the capacity of Kottayam to raise this huge sum in so short a time. Pazhassi Raja ji did his best to pay Sardar Khan and 60,000 rupees was paid to the Islamic General. But Khan was not satisfied and rejected Pazhassi's request that regional rule over Malabar be restored. This greedy and tactless approach of Sardar Khan's made sure that there was no chance of Raja Ji accepting the deal.\n\nIn the meantime, The Kottayam army of Raja Ji attacked the rival Coorg, an ally of Hyder Ali, in Wynad. The battle was a success for the King, the troops of Raja Ji surrounded and decimated the Coorg army. The destruction of Coorgs in Wynad enabled Raja Ji to send a whole new army into the contest at Thalasseri against Hyder Ali.\n\nIn 1780, Pazhassi Raja proposed a plan to the British to break the Mysorean siege of Thalassery: he and his men would strike the enemy in the rear from the east as the British came out of the fort and struck the Mysorean line in front. Both armies would effect a junction that would split the enemy into two. The Mysorean and allied troops could then be routed easily. But it was only in 1781 that the British understood the value of this plan and agreed to it. An operation was carried out as per Pazhassi's plan; it ended with the destruction of the Mysorean forces. Sardar Khan himself was killed. Soon after this victory, a rebellion in Kottayam led by Pazhassi Raja Ji defeated and ousted the Hyder Ali’s Mysorean army. **After many years Kottayam was under Hindu rule and its King was Pazhassi Raja Ji.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***During his reign, Pazhassi Raja Ji defended his kingdom from both Islamic and British forces. Initially, an alliance was struck between the British and the Raja Ji to defend the fort Thalasseri but it quickly ended.***\n\n*Please if any mistake is found feel free to correct in the comments below, I will correct it.

The tablighi jamaat in no way has a political agenda and has been staying away from such stuffs for a long time. A jamaat is basically a group, there are close 12-15 members in a single jamaat. The time period of a jamaat ranges from as short as 3 days to as long as 5 months. The jamaat stays in mosques of whichever area they are visiting, the schedule for which mosque to visit and for how many days to stay in that area is decided close to 3-4 months in advance. They also have their mandatory daily schedules such as praying, reading the Hadees, correcting each others Quran and giving sermons in the mosque. A jamaat is not conference or a congregation.\n\n\\#2 Now "What is a Markaz ??"\n\nA Markaz is a mosque in itself but also doubles up as a place where the jamaats that have long schedules like 4 months or sometimes 40 days, stay and get their schedules (i.e which areas and which mosques to visit) updated. They stay at the Markaz for almost 2-3 weeks. Also since its a mosque where jamaats stay for long period of times, there tends to be a lot of space issue. Also there are many markaz around the country as well as around the world where jamaats stay and get their schedules updated.\n\nNow talking about the Delhi Nizamuddin Markaz it is a kind of HQ for most, if not all the jamaat work that is done around the world. It was here in 1926 that the jamaat work was started and hence has been a kind of HQ since then. The schedules of every jamaat is planned here 3-4 months in advance. Every jamaat containing foreign nationals first arrive at the Delhi markaz where they stay for almost 2-3 weeks. There are also 4 months to and some 40 days indian jamaats which stay at the markaz for 2-3 weeks before getting their schedules updated. The lower markaz management changes every 2-3 months as there are people who volunteer to be present at the markaz for providing hospitality to the foreign nationals at the markaz as well as some join their jamaat to help them during their time in the country, since most foreign nationals dont speak in hindi.\n\nAlso since all foreign jamaats are here for 4-5 months we dont have a clear number of how many people came to India after covid19 was declared as a health scare. Since there are always a lot of people at the markaz an even more number of people are required for hospitality. Also there wasnt any gathering or congregation there are always this many people at the markaz. Since its a place where foreign as well as indian jamaats stay, therefore there are always close 3000-4000 people at the markaz EVERYDAY of EVERY YEAR.\n\n\\#3 Now coming to the incident that happened;\n\nOn 13th March the Delhi officials passed an order, in which they were prohibiting all sports gatherings /conferences /seminars activity having more than 200 people.\n\nOn 16th March the Delhi officials again passed an order, in which they were prohibiting all religious/ social /cultural gatherings having more than 50 people.\n\nAfter the 16th March order was passed the management started to vacate the markaz and relocated almost 1000-1200 people bur couldnt relocate the remaining 2000-2500 due to the overwhelming of the public transport services and cancellation of flights. After the Janta curfew on 23rd March the markaz management visited the delhi officials and as per the instructions given by the officials wrote a letter to the SDM office.\n\nThe video of 23rd March;\n\n[https://twitter.com/i/status/1245377722156748803](https://twitter.com/i/status/1245377722156748803)\n\nThis video nicely explains the steps that the Markaz management took after meeting the officials on 23rd March\n\n[https://youtu.be/fWUGVWAZFPA](https://youtu.be/fWUGVWAZFPA)\n\n\\#4 Now coming to the things the media is not reporting;\n\n"THERE IS A POLICE STATION RIGHT NEXT TO THE MARKAZ"\n\nThere are baseless allegations that the markaz was hiding people. how come the police did not know that there were this many people inside. The thing is, the police right beside the building knew that there are always 3000-4000 people in the markaz. Even the Delhi officials knew about this since this is happening for such a long time. But nobody is reporting this, rather the media is stating that the markaz management was hiding people.\n\nWhat I think the markaz should have done is informed the officials about the number of foreign nationals who were there and asked for their immediate testing. This would have made the officials act quickly and a lot of spread would have been reduced.\n\nComing to the speech of the Head cleric that is doing the rounds in which he is heard condemning the closing of mosques and telling people "to not get away from the mosques in such times" is what I am 100% against. That speech was a clear case of his negligence to the seriousness of the issue. Even though the sermon was given on 19th March, it was unnecessary and unwanted, rather he should have informed the people about the seriousness of this pandemic and advised them to do their prayers at home.\n\nI also seriously condemn the behavior of the jamaat members in different states towards the health officials. They should be punished for putting the lifes of our nurses and doctors in danger. According to a Hadees "Cleanliness is stated as half of Islam", and these people are completely going against a Hadees. They should be thankful that these nurses and doctors are taking care of them.\n\nAlso for the foreign nationals who violated their visa regulations and did preaching work in the country while having a tourist visa should also be punished. The tablighi jamaat in no way supports such kinds of visa breach.\n\nAs for the videos on tiktok where people are talking about Sunnah I just wanted to ask them why isnt there this kind of love for Sunnah in your day to day life. Why have they realised now during this pandemic that as Muslims they have to follow the Sunnah. They are just clout chasers and i would advised you\'ll not to give them any.\n\nMy point here is simple.\n\nEveryone here is at fault, the Markaz mangement for negligence but so are the Delhi officials for not taking any prior precautions inspite of them having the knowledge about this.'<br />Author: 'abbaadmasri'  id: 'fw66s8'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fw66s8/hello_everyone_i_am_a_23m_muslim_and_have_been_in/</li>

Because the reality is that Muslims are the *least* tolerant, *most* radicalised, and *most* likely group to engage in terror apologia. \n\nThey\'re proving it themselves, right now! They make excuses for putting lives of a billion people at risk, they pelt stones on cops and doctors who are risking their own lives out there. They want to do jumma sunna punna lunna even though their abbu and ammu will be the first to drop fucking dead. \n\n#Curb your whataboutism - there\'s a distinction between stupidity and malice\n\n***Dumb people exist everywhere***. People broke quarantine for dumb reasons everywhere. People went to temples and churches. People went to dance in the streets, or to buy veggies. People forgot about social distancing at many points.\n\nBut NOBODY else actively *TRIED* to spread the virus. NOBODY else spread messages and videos urging others to spread covid and sneeze and spit and remove masks. NOBODY else spread messages proclaiming this as divine punishment on the infidels. NOBODY else led prayer sermons hoping for crores of deaths. NOBODY ELSE TRIED TO BEAT UP DOCTORS TRYING TO HELP THEM. Nobody attacked cops the way Indian Muslims did. ACROSS THE NATION. Multiple cities. Separate incidents of stone pelting, violence, defiance, harassment, spitting.\n\nYou can cry about *BJP-BJP* and *Godi media* all you want, we don\'t give a flying fuck. **If you\'re gonna defy orders from the govt that were given to keep the public safe, then you and your entire cult are an enemy of the public and a threat to the nation.** \n\nIf you don\'t have the spine, the guts, or the foreskin, to stop defending these terrorists trying to spread death via disease, or pretending to be victims, **then you\'re a part of that group**, and by the time this crisis passes, ALL OF INDIA - your non-Muslim friends, coworkers, classmates too - will all look at you the same way. \n\nBe warned, and separate yourself from this cult now.\n\n#And your cult brought this about on itself. \n\nEVERY other community ostracizes and demonizes their worst - their fringe, their radicals, their violent, their criminals. They distance themselves from such people. They abuse them, insult them, express disgust towards them, express solidarity and unity with the victims and the world. Such people are shamed maligned by members of their own community. Such people are not welcome to any mainstream gathering outside the fringes where they may continue to skulk. \n\nBut when there\'s a terror attack or some unacceptable heinous shit that one of *YOUR COMPATRIOTS EXECUTES*, you cunts start howling about Muslims being victims, or how they\'re being demonized, or how people are being mean and discriminating, *instead of crying about the victims, or screaming condemnations at the attackers, or joining the rest of the world in their outrage and anger.* **But NooooOOOoooo.** You\'re more concerned that your fuckall *RELIGION* shouldn\'t be besmirched! This is all you lot ever care about. The handful among you that DARE to speak out in solidarity with the world are *HOUNDED AND THREATENED* by your fellow cultists! No Muslim stands up to defend and support them! \n\nImagine that. Such cowards.\n\nEven worse, some of your ilk come out and start *GLAMORIZING* and doing *image makeovers* for some of these psychotic nutjobs - be it \'poor terrorist\' or \'peaceful islamic scholar trying to kill millions with a virus\'. And this happens *WITH FULL COMMUNITY APPROVAL*. Such repulsive little cretins.\n\nAnd the ones who do these makeovers *are rewarded* by being made into influential spokespersons on Muslim affairs! Like Arfa and her ilk.\n\nAnd then you retards write articles whining about how you need to *"prove your partiotism"?!* FUCK YES, YOU DO. Until Muslims stand up and start trying to shame, or drive out the worst among them, and to reform their community, they are just willingly providing camouflage for terrorists.\n\nThere are only 5-6 talking point of any Muslim \'spokesperson\' anywhere, after any attack or incident:\n\n1. He was not a Muslim! (No True Scotsman - bullshit denial)\n2. Islam is a religion of Peace! (Gaslighting everyone with the same old bullshit)\n3. It\'s really the fault of the victim - secretly saying the attack was justified. (Victim blaming - justifying the crime)\n4. It\'s Islamophobia to talk about Islam after a terror attack dedicated to Allah! (Emotional blackmail)\n5. Muslims are being inconvenienced by your grief and anger - stop linking the actions of Islamic terrorists, to Islam! (Victim card)\n6. It\'s a conspiracy by CIA, RSS, RAW, FSB, XYZ! (Gaslighting again)\n7. They would never do such a thing! (Image makeover).\n\nThis shit doesn\'t fly anymore. You guys think you can keep this up forever, because people got bullied into silence earlier. \n\nYou\'re mistaken.\n\n\n#Let me give you a little insight into where your community\'s actions will lead, by the time this crisis is over \n\nMost of the fallout will be thanks to videos that your people have voluntarily uploaded, glorifying their diseased mindset!\n\n1. All trade with Muslim sellers will come to a total HALT. Not because of bigotry or hatred. Just because nobody would ever trust that one of you lot hadn\'t got some deadly disease, and wasn\'t trying to actively spread it by licking notes or sneezing on oranges. Who wants to risk their family dying when there\'s a Sikh or Hindu or Christian down the street selling the same thing on his *thela*?\n2. Your community will refuse to reform - sudharenge nahin - meaning YOUR population will get decimated by this disease. It will continue to afflict your community even YEARS later, when a vaccine would have been developed, because they will never trust doctors, vaccines, or authorities (because *kAgAz nAhY dEkhAyEnGaY* lmao). \n3. COVID will become endemic specifically within Indian-Muslim populations. That sucks for the rest of us too, because it breaches our herd-immunity, but then society will then be forced to find ways to insulate itself from you - permanent social distancing.\n4. Indian Muslims will, over the next few years, have very very few old people. No more mullas with long orange-grey beards. Most of those will probably get infected and proceed to Jannat within the next few months. Any \'old wise men\' in your community will be gone. This is bad for everyone, because the young dumb ones are going to become even more stupid and violent.\n5. Your community will be denied visas for travel by other countries. Nobody wants diseased and demented bastards coming to their country, trying to infect people.\n6. People will **literally** *"avoid you like the plague"*. No jobs, no contract work, no personal interaction.\n7. All islamic outfits will start getting investigated for terror links and islamist ideologies.\n\nThere will be a lot more, but that is a short introduction to a few outcomes that your brethren will gift to you. \n\n#Why tell you this?\n\n**I tell you this, not because it makes me happy.** I\'d rather every Muslim learned to live as an INDIAN, and become one with us, like some of our best and brightest - Abdul Kalam, MF Hussain, Zakir Hussain, Arif Mohammed Khan, Mohammed Kaif, Ahmed Shariff, and so many more.\n\nI tell you this because NOW is when you and every Muslim you know needs to start HOWLING at your Mullahs and radicals and extremists. \n\n**If you aren\'t going to stand with INDIANS, against TERRORISTS, at THIS time, and are most worried about how your religion is \'looking bad\'... guess what... YOU\'RE making your religion look WORSE.**\n\nEvery religion has retards. Islam has an exceptional buttload of retards, but that\'s okay too. The problem is YOU LOT. The "regular" guys - the "moderates" - who run around trying to defend your retards, blaming victims, and trying to make it all about yourselves, and your cult-leader.\n\nI give you this warning with the hope that you will read it and open your eyes to what you are inviting "upon your necks". (Get it?)\n\nBecause trust me lads, your community is gonna have to go through some ***terrible*** times from the day this lockdown ends, till many many years later.\n\nYou haven\'t got much time. How you guys respond during this lockdown TODAY, will decide how your community fares in the long run.\n\nI don\'t have high hopes for you, but I\'ll wish you the best.\n\n#Sudhar jao.'<br />Author: 'fsm_vs_cthulhu'  id: 'fvv0mn'<br />Score:905<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fvv0mn/to_all_the_muslims_defending_tabhligi_jamaat_or/</li>

It may perish immediately, or it may do so after a hundred years. It is a question of time only. There is no chance of maintaining it indefinitely. But the spirit soul is so minute that it cannot even be seen by an enemy, to say nothing of being killed. As mentioned in the previous verse, it is so small that no one can have any idea how to measure its dimension. So from both viewpoints there is no cause of lamentation because the living entity can neither be killed as he is, nor can the material body, which cannot be saved for any length of time, be permanently protected. The minute particle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his work, and therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized. In the Vedānta-sūtras the living entity is qualified as light because he is part and parcel of the supreme light.

Fighting by sword (aggressiveness) is not the only way of safeguarding Dharma while it's certainly necessary. It would have helped millennia ago when we were getting invaded but now I feel like we're slowly changing the image of hinduism as a thought provoking concept to bunch of confused illiterates. I feel like people who wrote Vedas and Upanishads would be embarassed to see what those regions now evolved into. Decades ago if you ask someone to close their eyes and imagine hinduism they would have seen different colours or traditional wears, temples, statues but now the cow urine is dominating the main stream narrative thanks to certain politicians. While we certainly need more unity among Hindus, I think we're losing ourselves in the process. To counter the fanaticism of Islamic followers, Hindus are injecting fanaticism into Dharma which is unnatural. I wish our politicians from 70 years didn't stomp on Hindus to give unfair importance to minorities which wouldn't have lead us to this mess of power dynamics which is ultimately going to make us look like idiots. Muslims have nothing to lose honestly.

      <li>Title::: "Thoughts about the IT cell? Malviya team is ruining our PM's reputation."<br />Body: 'Think about the following tweets at a time when more than 18 have died while going home walking from their cities because they cannot afford food. \n\n"Exodus of migrant workers from Delhi to Kottayam was BIG news! Rightly so. But there is deafening silence as role of CM Kejriwal in Delhi and some \'Islamic fundamentalist groups\' in Kerala emerges"\n\n"How evil and untruthful can a man be? We have been saying all along that the migrant crisis in Delhi is a manufactured one and none other than the Chief Minister is responsible for it."\n\n"Must read. Micro detail of how Modi government has been, perhaps the most proactive government, in the world, to act against the threat of #Coronavirus.\n\nExplains why India has managed a flattish curve, so far."\n\nA disclaimer. I was born and raised in Vadodara and I have been a Modi voter since the age of 18. I really admired the fact that corruption at ground level was less, roads were good most of the time. And the government made very good infrastructure for various sectors. \n\nHowever, I cannot fathom how this Malviya guy has been the HEAD of the IT CELL for a government without any political experience. He posts communal crap ALL THE TIME. You should read his archived tweets where he says the IT Cell\'s role is to share pornography. That was in 2010. \n\nBut now, almost always, he posts fake news and communal crap. I looked at his tweets in the last few days. NOT ONE WORD ABOUT CRORES OF MIGRANTS WALKING HUNDREDS OF KILOMETERS TO UP. All he does is blame game. Also see how many people share his posts. Usually around 1-2k, and mostly fake IT Cell profiles with fake pics. Reverse search those pics and you will see most of them are common across profiles.\n\nI know the person who started the IT Cell in BJP. He is now a cleantech entrepreneur in Delhi. He said that the IT cell was conceived as a medium to share INDIAN VALUES TO MASSES AND MAKE THEM BELIEVE IN THE RSS AND SIMILAR IDEOLOGY. \n\ni feel sad that this guy (Malvia) has ruined the reputation of the IT cell worldwide. It is now perceived as a fake news source of communal propaganda. Nothing constructive at all. This guy is just hatred and ego. No substance. He has no idea of people who suffer due to poverty. He is also a monster insulting veteran journalists who are neutral (unlike Sardesai). See News18 video where he abuses a journalist for just asking questions. \n\nI hope the BJP realizes that having a social media influencer without any credentials as a political activist or leader won\'t help it win elections. It simply defames India and ruins the reputation of our country. This guy Malviya is bringing a bad name to our community of Banias. \n\nTLDR: Malviya is a liability for the BJP, and many leaders accept that. Hope the ITCell becomes the true voice of nationalism, without hatred, soon. Right now most look at it as a troll cell.'<br />Author: 'The_Real_Deshbhakt'  id: 'fuw0fm'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fuw0fm/thoughts_about_the_it_cell_malviya_team_is/</li>

Recommendations have been made to Dr. Chandanwale to take necessary corrective action against Neeraj Pedhekar and set a strong precedence in order to ensure that no such acts are committed by the students in future. Additionally, recommendations have been made to Dr. Chandanwale to implement a sensitisation program for all students and teaching as well as non-teaching staff in order to make the institution campus safe for LGBTQIA+ students.\n\nAfter receiving backlash from multiple users on Instagram, Neeraj posted an apology message through a story on Instagram however in the very next story, he continues to speak in a demeaning way about the LGBTQIA+ community.\n\nReviewing the incident, Duggirala Subash, a queer Law student said, “The sections under 153A and 505 IPC deal with promoting enmity between different communities, causing public mischief, inciting groups to commit violence against other communities.” He further added, “Any person who does or acts against the interest of the LGBTQ community shall be punished with imprisonment upto three years and a fine.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Source* : [Yes, We Exist (@yesweexistindia)](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-eSnKMlMob/)'<br />Author: '_onan'  id: 'fuq3gq'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fuq3gq/complaint_filed_against_pune_student_for_hate/</li>

But at minimum, that means each person infected 7.5 others. A more aggressive estimate would be that 70% of the infected were safely quarantined, but that means that 30%  (18 people) infected the other 459. That means each careless person potentially infected 25.5 others.\n\n&gt;Those 459 have potentially infected dozens of people over the last 2 weeks... EACH.\n\n&gt;So current number of infected that will be going into lockdown today, could easily be anywhere between 3500 (lower estimate) to 12000 (more realistic estimate). Remember, it's a big set - some will show symptoms from tomorrow, others will show symptoms only after 13 days.\n\n&gt;Those undetected infected folks going into lockdown today, may still infect at least 2-3 others each, over the next day or two (including family members, people in queues tonight, random careless contact, those that violate curfew, etc).\n\n&gt;So by the end of week 2, I'm expecting we could have between 7000 (lower margin) all the way up to 30000. \n\n&gt;By the end of week 3, we will see the REAL effect of the curfew.\n\n&gt;Remember, Coronavirus has a nearly 1% death rate - that's 70-300 deaths.\n\n&gt;We're already well over 1000 infected (not yet symptomatic).\n\nAt the time people were somehow hoping we'd stay below 1k (which was impossible anyway).\n\n14 days ago (21st of March), we had detected only 280 cases in India.\n\n###As of today, 10 days later, we've detected 3127 cases total.\n\n2812 of these detected are still actively infected.     \n229 have recovered.         \n86 are dead.\n\n\n##KEEP IN MIND: These numbers are just 'detected'. Almost all of them were already infected over 7-14 days ago. The data we have for 'today' is actually people who were infected around 2 weeks ago, being detected now.\n\nSo, place your bets.

In this case, Indians are relevant people.\n\nEven international governments are looking up and appreciating on how India has contained the spread or else imagine the calamity had covid spread in villages.\n\nI do not wear rose tinted glasses and even for a minute suggest that things are perfect and nothing remains to be done. Far from it. But kudos to the man who is trying to bring everyone together, who is not shying away from making tough decisions and sticking to them. Yes there are people who are suffering and devoid of food, medications, basic rights but tell me the alternative. Trust me, not imposing a lockdown is not an option at all. And my experience in corporate world says that in front of team ( Indians) only positives are shown to keep the morale high, while the battles are fought and won in closed strategy rooms. So to the people who ask why crucial matters like food and jobs were not discussed yesterday, please understand that big wars are won by celebrating small victories not by lamenting on difficulties. Its easy to rant and pick out faults, but what Modi is doing (action) is incredibly difficult. I have nothing else but respect for this man at present and I seriously do not understand why some people keep complaining."<br />Author: 'Igiveitrightback'  id: 'fuo2m4'<br />Score:25<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fuo2m4/a_relfection_on_current_hate_towards_indian_pm/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Perspective of an NRI and the negative bias towards India'<br />Body: 'I\'m an NRI. I wanted to share some of my feelings being an Indian American particularly what I have noticed the previous 4-5 years with respect to the portrayal of Indian politics and news.\n\nI\'m not going to comment on what I feel about the BJP, Congress, or Modi\'s leadership. Whatever you think of all of that - good or bad - it is quite clear that there is a negative attitude towards Indian politics and social issues in American media, particularly that which is aimed towards young adults and twenty something year olds (John Oliver, Hassan Minhaj, etc.). The regular media looks at some of the things in a negative way like the handling of Kashmir and the CAA issue. But I would argue it\'s not as bad as the Jon Stewart clone club, which like to talk about these issues constantly. The younger group that watches these shows are more involved in group think. They aren\'t just liberal, they have a specific brand of liberal, where they are more focused on certain social issues and even more than that, favoritism towards certain races. It seems like Hassan\'s critique of Modi was very popular which allowed other people to start "investigating" the problems of the BJP and report them.\n\nI did say that I wouldn\'t comment about how I felt about the government and its policies, but now that I think about it, I think it would be a good idea to express my basic feelings about them. I don\'t think the BJP handles the problem with Muslim hate speech well and I think the CAA is a bad move. That will probably anger many of you, but I wanted to express that so you know and others know what I\'m about to say isn\'t some India shill speak.\n\nWhat I have noticed is a strong anti-Indian news coverage in American media that is unlike that of other countries that have much worse issues. What has always concerned me for many years, and especially in light of recent events, is the lack of negative attention towards countries like China, where the government actively kills Muslim minorities. Here in America, the media surrounding the riots and the Muslim deaths in India treated the events as if they were government sanctioned acts. No they were not. Riots between Hindus and Muslims have happened in the past and no, Modi wan\'t PM then. Are they going to ignore decades, if not centuries, of conflict between people of these two religions? \n\nYet when there is a country that actually takes their citizens, who are Muslim, to concentration camps, you don\'t see  "Austin Powers" Oliver talking about this. Where is his woke statement about how China is killing Muslims with a menacing picture of President Xi in the background? He talks about stuff that everyone is already aware of with China. Same authoritative censorship BS that everyone already knows about. No one dares to dig deep into the extremely negative aspects of the CCP that would put China in an even worse light than any other country. Barely anyone talked about the Chinese treatment of animals and consumption of wildlife between the end of the SARS in 2003 and with the rise of coronavirus. Even now if someone were to criticize the handling of the CCP with the coronavirus issue and express criticism towards cultural habits of mainland China, you are labelled a racist. Even when I bring up how that the recent virus issue aren\'t even the tip of iceberg when it comes to problems in China, like bringing up the persecution of Ughyer Muslims and journalists, they will paint you as a racist who is trying to deflect blame and should be more concerned with trying to find a solution with what we are dealing with right now. I can only imagine how reaction would be towards India and Indians in general if a pandemic emerged from India.\n\nWith India you can make accusations towards the leader wanting minorities dead and inciting violence when those claims are tenuous. You could make a criticism towards the BJP\'s preference of a Hindu nation, but to make an assumption that the government is trying to actively kill minorities when that is simply not the case, while ignoring or barely covering what is happening in China, is simply biased and terrible reporting.\n\nAnd this is what I\'ve started to notice as an Indian American. We have faced a lot of the brunt of racism in the Western world, when it comes to being an immigrant, more so than East Asians and South East Asians. There are select "minorities" that are off the table so to speak when it comes to criticism. But nobody talks about this. Even bringing this up will get you bad looks or push back. It goes beyond CCP propaganda in my opinion. There is a general negative bias towards Indians and Middle Eastern people (pretty much brown colored people). Part of it is probably being lumped with Middle Eastern people who are seen in a negative light due to terrorism. But it goes deeper than that and my personal belief is that the West has always had a negative bias towards South Asians in general. That bias seeps down into the liberal mindset that unwittingly accepts this racism while projecting a false support for equality. We often don\'t talk about how being a true person of color, and one that was colonized, we have been dealing with negative racism from the West for centuries, and that\'s not comparable to what East Asia has experienced. There are a lot of subconscious and latent negative beliefs towards Indians in general and it drives both sides of the Western media. To ignore that is foolish. You are pretty much ignoring history.\n\nI feel that is overlooked and the preferential treatment of the Chinese government and people of East Asian descent in the Western world is not discussed by other types of minorities in the West. Bringing that up is extremely taboo.\n\nI understand that his is a sub focused on people who live in India, but I wanted to share this because I think some of you might find it interesting. If there are any NRIs who visit this sub, please feel free to discuss this. Do you disagree with me or agree? Why? I\'d love to hear from other NRIs and also those who live in India. I wanted to express my thoughts. I hope I didn\'t offend anyone or bore anyone or worse confuse anyone with my rambling.'<br />Author: 'haveacorona20'  id: 'fulg6z'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fulg6z/perspective_of_an_nri_and_the_negative_bias/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Obsession with Pakistan'<br />Body: "For a long period of time I have been feeling that we Indians are getting over obsessed with tention with Pakistan. I am not downplaying the threat that Pakistan is to India, but we are seriously ignoring a much severe threat that is expanding ambitions of China. We all know Pakistan is nothing compared to India, in all fields, sports, arms and armies, economy, growth, intellect, etc. but to feel supirior we always focus on Pakistan, and China is using our obsession, they are building belt &amp; road initiative, strings of pearls, etc. to strip India of the control and power that we still have in the region. China has infiltrated our markets to deep extent (how many of you are reading this on a chinese phone?). They are not only becoming more powerful but also stripping India of it's existing power. And we are not even aware of it. We are constantly comparing ourselves with Pakistan (even in the time of this pandemic crisis), but why? To feel supirior. China is much more powerful than us in economics and world influence (no offense), and slowly we are even loosing our current influence. In some recent years influence of India has surely increased, but still we have a long way to go. For every news channels, youtubers, media outlets they publish almost 20 sources which bashed Pakistan to one against China. Seriously we need to take china seriously or else we will become just another nation on the globe. Even USA which is arguably most influential nation in world is taking China seriously, but we, who share a boundary with China are not. We all know the expanding ambitions that china has, it did invade Tibet and destroyes their culture and their people. I have complete faith in our Indian armed forces but still if we continue to ignore China, we will loose Arunachal Pradesh to them(China claims Arunachal as South Tibet and has ambitions to invade it just like Tibet). China invaded Tibet when China was not even a super power, and still world didn't retaliated, what makes you think that the world whould now retaliate now given now China is indeed a super power. There is a serious need for us to realise the real threat is to the sovereignty of India. We lost Aksai Chin and no one came to help india, but we still are obsessed with POK. If there was no China threat, POK can be taken back within a weak( I know Pakistan has nukes, but still we have defence mechanisms and mostly our intelligence knows the location of these nukes in Pakistan, we can quickly neutralize them. Pakistan doesn't have nuclear submarines or aircraft carriers. They only have stationary nukes, which can be dealt with). The only threat that India has while attacking POK is China, as we cannot handle both Pakistan and China simultaneously. Our aim should be either to weaken China or form good relations with them(like USA-Canada), so that if we try to fight Pakistan,  China should not intervene. What do you think is greater threat to India's sovereignty, Pakistan or China?"<br />Author: 'dev_me1'  id: 'fujo3r'<br />Score:54<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fujo3r/obsession_with_pakistan/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How I transformed from a Kejriwal supporter to a Modi supporter'<br />Body: "Not sure if this is suitable for this sub. Still, I will write it down anyway.\n\nIt all started with Anna Hazare movement in 2011. Everyone was fed up of Congress's corruption and wanted a law to punish those who were involved in corruption. From that movement rose Kejriwal. He was a young leader who resonated with the youth. When he launched his party in 2012, I thought there was some hope with them. I even supported them by donating to the party. I was in college at that time a keyboard warrior. I was frequently involved in arguments with friends on Facebook.\n\nAAP gave a tough fight in 2013 and I was really happy with them. They formed a coalition government with congress - still happy that they will do some good work.\n\nThen came 2014 general elections. India was drenched in Modi wave but I was obsessed with Kejriwal. I seriously thought removing corruption was the only way for India to progress and voted for AAP in the general election (so stupid of me).\n\nIn 2015, Kejriwal won 67 seats and I literally gave a party to my friends in happiness.\n\nDuring this time Modi started his schemes and plans. Most of them were unheard of and I didn't even know they were problems in India.\n\n**Jan Dhan Yojna** \\- I failed to realise that a lot of people were not connected to the Indian banking system which leads to corruption in social welfare schemes. How millions of people were added to the banking system with this scheme and billions of rupees entered the banking system.\n\n**Ujwala Yojna** \\- He asked people to give up subsidy. This was unheard of. Indian middle class, for whom every single penny is so important, giving up subsidy sot that poor could benefit.\n\n**Biometric Attendance** \\- I was like seriously? The government bureaucracy being made accountable. Never thought this was possible.\n\n**Swatch Bharat Mission** \\- Didn't even know sanitation was such a big issue in the country.\n\nAlso, the infamous **demonetisation**. I was could not believe someone could take such a big step to curb corruption. Although it was a failure, caused a lot of problems for the common man. Still, he made his intentions clear for future years.\n\nWith these schemes, I realized that corruption cannot be removed by that Jan Lokpal. It should be removed from the source.\n\nAdd to that I was secular before and didn't know about the hypocrisy that went on with Hindus in this country. I am not that religious but still Hindu values, mythology and culture are important to me.\n\nNot every decision he made was right. But, he still dared take them without trying to be politically correct. Now I know that he is the real Dark Knight we needed and Kejriwal is a cunt.

      <li>Title::: 'V.D Savarkar on the concept of God - The god of Humans v/s the God of Universe.'<br />Body: 'If we were to hit a rod onto the surface of a flowing stream, the undivided flow of water seems momentarily divided into two streams. In the evening sky, the moment the first star appears and twinkles, the otherwise unending sky appears to have acquired a point of reference, quadrisected into four cardinal directions.\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0This material world too, in all its eternity, gets divided into two parts as soon as the star of human awareness starts twinkling.\xa0 Dichotomies like the beautiful and the ugly, the fragrant and the malodorous, the melodious and the harsh to hear, the soft and the hard, the dear and the unpleasant, the good and the bad, the divine and the evil, and others emerge as soon as human need becomes the point of reference in this cosmos. All that humankind considers good, pleasant and helpful is one part of this world while all that is unpleasant, all that unfavorably or adversely affects human existence is the other part of this world. He who creates the good part is “God” while he who creates the bad part is the “Rakshas”, “Asura”, “Satan” or “Devil”. Accepting these elementary human sensibilities as the working criterion for understanding the usefulness, goodness or badness of the cosmos is quite unavoidable.\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0Our ancestors realised ages ago that it was impossible to count, analyse, characterize and qualify or quantify each and every living species and non-living entity of this immeasurable and unfathomable universe. Instinctively they chose to analyse the things and beings in the universe using the five senses humankind is gifted with- touch, sight, scent, hearing and taste. Now everything had one or more attributes one could, well, “sense”. For example, the rose was red by color, soft to touch and fragrant by scent. While a fruit was sweet or sour by taste, aromatic by scent, cool and wet to touch, with a certain appearance for the eyes. A cuckoo was black to see and sweet to hear. A breeze was cool or warm to feel (to “touch”) while a sea storm was frightening to hear, forceful to feel and salty to smell. Given the primitive times then, this very idea of using the five senses was a veritable leap of human ingenuity! They developed this thought process to call the five senses representatives of the Pancha Maha Bhootas (The Five Great Elements), namely Pruthvi (Earth or the solid state of matter), Aap (Water or the liquid state of matter), Tej (Fire, light energy or radiations), Vaayu (Wind, air or gaseous state of matter) and Aakash (Outer space, vacuum or the Great Void). Spiritually, they theologized that whatever conversation or dialogue we humans could have with the God of this universe was also through these five senses, hence they even developed the concept of the five-headed deities, like Pancha Mukhi Mahadev, Pancha Mukhi Hanuman or Pancha Mukhi Ganesha.\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0Just as the process of studying the universe and its objects and beings with our five senses was so natural and instinctive, so were the attempts at trying to figure out if there indeed was any psyche behind the very forces who could create this universe. These forces were deified and became objects of faith across ancient cultures. The thought that came forward was that by creating this bounty and abundance of natural wealth for human prosperity, Nature was indeed very kind-hearted and affectionate like a mother who provided for her children, us human beings. Nature was\xa0Mother\xa0Nature,\xa0Mother\xa0Earth,\xa0Mother\xa0Life, the Goddess “Srushti” or “Prakruti”, who tended to us her children. By psyche she was all that a mother could be- affectionate, loving and providing. This “faith” has only been reinforced from time to time by the gifts Mother Nature has been showering onto us from time and again onto humankind till today! Likewise the Creator was Father Creator, the powerful “Purusha”, who though so powerful was yet, by psyche, so kind, gentle, caring and compassionate that He laid the very seed of human existence and a habitat to sustain human life!\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0Truly, for the benefit, utility and happiness of humankind, the compassionate God has created nature with such meticulous paternal love! This sun, this ocean, how majestically big these Great Elements! But the kind God employed even them for the service of humankind. Just as a mother would keep cool sweet water filled up for her kids coming home from their play out in the afternoon sun, so does the “Sun-God”, using sunrays as suction conduits, suck up only the water sans the salt from the salty oceans thereby sparing the sweet water of the rivers – and then store up this distillate in heavenly reservoirs, making it tempting even to the Gods! Just imagine the control mechanism over this saltwater-to-Sweetwater conversion – only as much capacity is there in the sunrays for this conversion as is the water required in one year and only as much is the water storage capacity of the celestial reservoirs- the clouds. At the same time, the oceans are themselves not turned sweet, sparing our whole life from becoming tastelessly bland!\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0Look at the animals! They are of various calibers of intelligence and various specializations, as varied as the varieties of services humankind expected of them in the pre-industrial ages! The Gods taught the camels the art of eating desert thorns and going without water for days, adapting them to life in a desert habitat – and they became the ship of the desert, a lifeline for sustaining human life in the inhospitable harsh desert! And how swift is the horse! God has given him strength and forbearance to both gallop for hours and to manoevour in the midst of a pitched battle all the time balancing and bearing the weight of a human rider for hours. There are many examples of steadfast loyalty where horses have even sacrificed their life for their masters, like the horse Chetak who carried Rana Pratap to safety before dying of exhaustion. Yet God has not over endowed the horse with the intelligence to ride a human being instead. Take the dairy cow or buffalo - one just has to push dry grass from one end to get rich, creamy, fresh, life-giving milk in abundance from the other end. Really, how kind God must be to his human children for creating such a biochemical process as milk formation! What’s more - God endowed the same dairy cow or buffalo that produces milk with the ability to leave behind her own progeny, a reproduced copy, with the very same miraculous biochemical abilities to turn dry unpalatable inedible grass into sweet, creamy milk before she retires or passes away. A milk-vending machine that vends not just milk but also another milk-vending machine!\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0One has to sow just one grain of wheat - and it turns into a plant producing more than a hundred grains! Just\xa0one\xa0mango – a divinely juicy, delicious, nutritious, pulpy fruit – but it comes with its own seed that if sown and nurtured, turns into a majestic tree that gives\xa0hundreds\xa0of juicy mangoes for generations of a human family, year after year. Not just that, the mango even appears by branch grafting, producing whole orchards after orchards of the noble fruit in veritable abundance! Rice, millet or other varieties of different foodgrains with different nutrient profiles and tastes grow in all sorts of climatic conditions – in each case, one gets a whole sack full from one single, sowed grain. The varieties of fruits- pomegranates, bananas, apples, figs, jackfruits, dates… from different climatic profiles follow the same law - just\xa0one\xa0sown seed supplies enough fruit for satisfying the needs of at least a small family! All sorts of tasty, nutritious vegetables grow by themselves when kind of “ordered” by the mere act of being sown – the Lord God made this possible for us his human children! Then there’s sugarcane, after all a mere grass – with its weed-like propensity to proliferate wherever water is available. But when humans discovered its sweet juice, it just had to be disciplined into growing within the space allotted to it and nurtured by irrigation before it grew into vast lush stretches of such a generous produce that after being squeezed of its last drop of sweet juice by industrial scale sugar extraction processes, can still provide basic roughage to field oxen from leftovers! In fact, today’s scientists in the field of unconventional energy resources are researching the possibility of employing crops like sugarcane and even weeds from hillsides to generate the bio-fuel ethanol just when the world thought its fossil fuels were getting used up! Truly, when one resource dries up, another becomes available! How\xa0can\xa0we humans\xa0ever\xa0even quantify, leave alone repay, the kindness that God showered on humankind, making arrangements for every aspect of human existence!\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0And what about human anatomy!\xa0 From the soles of our feet to the most microscopic of the organelles of the brain, the layout of the human body is full of masterly, orderly planning and co-ordination- O Lord, how meticulously Thou hath designed our bodies for us! Our\xa0human\xa0eye- how many ages, eons, generations of evolutionary experiments hath Thou conducted to bring our eye to its present capabilities? Initially the eye was just a nervous tissue able to merely make out a ray of light, which could only differentiate illumination from utter darkness, recognize a shadow more than actual details of a form; but by continuous evolutionary experiments, trials and errors, we humans now have our beautiful, spherical, moist – and –\xa0ambitious\xa0human eye. Today the human eye is so capable that we humans have the ambitious foresight(!) to beat Thee at Thy own game, by inventing a duplicate eye, an extension, the telescope, to view not just the interiors of Thy own cosmic laboratory of outer space, but to discover none other than\xa0Thee Thyself\xa0 somewhere in space!\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0Further, how\xa0can\xa0one ever describe fully the festival of beauty and colours Thou hath conducted in the Three Worlds? The ultra-delicate flower of the Parijaat, the ultra-fragrant Golden Champak flower! The peacock’s vibrant plumage – the colors and design of every feather, the peacock’s inimitable gait! What a natural artist that noble bird is! When I watch the bird spread his plumage, dance with excitement and cry out aloud, believe me, O God, even my heart dances in sync with every step of this gifted bird and cries out Thy glory in admiration of Thy divine creation. In fact, I feel like sulking that\xa0I\xa0do not have the wonderful plumage of the peacock. The whole earthly creation resounds with the songs of birds and is a kaleidoscope of pleasant sights and landscapes! Roses, chamelis, bakulis, Juhis, Jaais, Champak, sandalwood, Ketakis… creepers and shrubs in full bloom, whole gardens full of them freshening and lending fragrance to the atmosphere! The Gods of love, Madan and Rati, are busy linking the hearts of lovers! The nights are starry, the dawns are pink, youth is confident and fresh, sleep is sound and deep, and love is like a cool breeze heralding the rhapsody of springtime. There is material and spiritual growth all over… O Lord, how can we humans not help thinking that such a beautiful world was created specially for us by Thee? If we love, nurture, protect and provide for our children, so doth Thee. Thou truly art both our father and mother and we Thy children. Even the milk our mothers give us is given ultimately by you. O Lord, we are Thy devotees and Thou, the Lord God of humankind, the God of Man!\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0Not just that, Thou art the only God, there can be no other and Thou hath created this world specifically for our peace and prosperity!\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0… This ideology, this concept of “The God of humankind” creating the universe specially for the survival and prosperity of Humankind could indeed have proved truthful and correct – if and only if everything, every being and all conditions in this world would have been only helpful, pleasant, beneficial and useful to humankind.\xa0\nBut alas! The cold fact is that most of this earth, the very earth we instinctively consider Mother Earth, Mother Nature and Mother Life is hardly all that safe, protective, kind and considerate to us humans as we were just philosophizing. On the contrary, the living conditions existent on this planet and influences of the atmosphere, the sun, moon and stars in reality seem to contradict our pet theory of faith too much – conditions that obtain on earth are mostly inhospitable, harsh, with the law of the Jungle working all the time around us. Humankind has to struggle for its very survival and struggle still further for ensuring prosperity.\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0Take a good look at the very Sun and oceans we sung paeans in praise of just some time ago. The way the unsparing rays of the hot sun finish off a helpless victim of sunstroke or heatstroke is quite comparable to the ruthlessness with which a gatekeeper watchman beats a poisonous snake by repeated relentless blows- striking the final blows even when half-dead. In the very India where millions of Hindu Brahmins offer prayers to the Sun God every sunrise and sunset, the very same sun shines hot for the entire spell of a drought or famine, even lasting several years, killing thousands of heatstroke, hunger or thirst.\xa0\nIn the Quran, Talmud, Torah and Bible, devout prophets sang in praise of God Yahweh, “For us Humans, O God, Thee hath kept a plentiful supply of fish for us to eat in the oceans!” But the same oceans are also full of creatures like human-eating sharks which can eat a human body alive and whole. The oceans are also teeming with other forms of sea life like poisonous snakes, sting rays, electric rays and the Portuguese-Man-of-war which can either kill, maim or in any other way seriously harm any human form in sea-water – a swimmer or diver, a shipwrecked sailor, a fisherman, marine biologist or oceanologist – the ocean Gods are quite busy nurturing these forms of life harmful to man with sustained impartiality. Quite similar to a mugger who first poses as a traveler’s guide, then waits for an opportune time to shed his mask to finally loot his trusting quarry in the middle of nowhere, the ocean, while carrying afloat thousands of rafts, boats and vessels at a time, suddenly throws some of them off its back and into its terrible jaws to swallow up entire vessels and ocean liners like the doomed Titanic, drowning all the thousands of people aboard in one gulp. Oceans can unpredictably erupt into tsunamis sucking entire populations of coastal settlements into their watery graves.\xa0\nRivers in Africa, Australia and South America are full of potentially human-eating creatures like alligators, piranha and crocodiles. The holy rivers, on whose banks civilizations and cities flourished, can swallow up entire townships or at least several thousand helpless people and animals in one spate, be they the Holy Mother Ganges or Jamnaji, the Brahmaputra, Hwang-Ho or Nile, the Holy Jordan or the Father Thames.\xa0\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0Primitive Semitic devotion believed in the Abrahamic Books that the Elohim (Yahweh of the Bible and Allah of the Quran) created the goat, lamb, deer and other creatures so that his believers would get lots of meat to eat! But the devotion with which the believer smacks his lips on seeing “food” animals blinds him to the obvious fact that the same world in which he resides with his “food” animals is also home to potentially man-eating animals like the big wild cats, crocodiles, bears and sharks. If a man-eating Sunderban Royal Bengal tiger preys on an unsuspecting human child and is spotted smacking his lips after devouring the child’s flesh, should we say that God created small human children with tender flesh just so that some man-eater can have a delicious meal? And as if to provide icing on a cake, the world has its share of dangerous vegetarian beasts as well, from the very herbivorous African river hippos that can cut a human form into two in one snap of their jaws (just as easily as we crunch a slice of cucumber at our dinner table), to the grass-munching land giants like the bison or Assamese rhinos and ultimately the largest land mammal, the\xa0 solitary bull African elephants all of whom are known to kill humans more often than do the carnivorous big cats. \xa0\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0When a tsunami strikes a coast, it sucks in everything it can from coastal human inhabitation- brides in their own wedding ceremonies about to garland their grooms, mothers suckling their meek hungry and vulnerable infants, artists with unfinished paintings and sculptures, lovers locked mid-ardor oblivious to the world, devotees in mid-meditation with spiritual ecstasy… entire cities like Dwarika and Atlantis, regions and subcontinents have gone under water, got buried under volcanic lava like Pompeii… as quickly as Ganesh devotees immerse a Ganesh idol in the sea – with cataclysmic precision. And yet, the next daybreak, the same Dawn Goddess Usha, who was soulfully venerated with sacred chants of the Vedas, appears as pink as always over the destruction.\xa0\nThe Quran quotes that Allah created the moon so that the believer could tell the parts of the day to know when to offer namaz. But when the “infidel’ Chengiz Khan stormed Baghdad, the cultural capital of Islamdom, massacring all Momins in his wake, slaughtering clerics and the Caliph with his family, demolishing the whole city, razing all buildings and walking over a pile of cut heads of killed Muslims, did not the moon still rise over the same Baghdad that night too, informing the namaz-hating Chengiz Khan about the times of the day just as it did the namaz-performing Muslims?\xa0\n\nFragrant flowers, melodiously singing songbirds, the haughty peacock with his inimitable plumage, even entire forests get roasted alive in a single bushfire or forest fire, like we roast a brinjal on a flame. \nWhile a human population trustingly plays the game of life in the daytime and rests secure every night in the lap of Mother Earth, some particular moment the same terra firma demolishes the unsuspecting population with one earthquake tremor – buildings get flattened, both huts and architecturally marvelous monuments of human creativity and civilisation, like a pack of cards ceases to exist. Entire villages can be swallowed alive in a moment with the same earth opening up a giant crevice in an earthquake!\xa0\nHistorically giant meteors have hit the earth and in some cases, even set in massive cycles of climatic change and destruction with extinctions of entire species. Can a flaming comet also not suddenly appear out of the blue (from outer space) and hit the surface of the earth setting ablaze entire regions much like a flaming torch can set ablaze a whole pile of cotton?\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0For every lifestyle there exists a dysfunction. The human body, when diseased, is a museum of pathologies and pain- furuncles, epilepsy, tumours, agony, coma, palpitations, diabetes and heart arrests… The world out there has its rounds of bubonic plagues, famines, cholera epidemics …\xa0\nOur faith and belief that humankind is the centre of reference for the whole universe and that not just\xa0our own\xa0planet - the earth with her plentiful resources and life forms - but the whole\xa0cosmos\xa0was created by God\xa0only\xa0for humankind,\xa0only\xa0to favour humankind,\xa0only\xa0to provide pleasure to humankind and\xa0only\xa0out of special partisan fondness for humankind, eventually crystallized into belief systems, some open to contrary thought and other times closed to alternative view-points, like unbending dogma unwilling to confront rationalism. We humans even created religious texts of this dogma, selectively only documenting phenomena supportive of our theory that God first manufactures and then employs even stars, planets, comets, black holes, galaxies and constellations exclusively for sustaining human existence, protecting human life, providing fun, pleasure and entertainment to humans and eternally providing resources to human civilization, happiness and prosperity. This blinkered approach has only blinded us to stark, obvious natural phenomena and unpleasant observations of accidents and natural catastrophes endured by humankind that contradict our doctrine of “God’s Creation for human welfare”. We have to free ourselves of the shackles of this dogmatic conditioning to outgrow our primary assumption and adopt the approach of unbiased reasoning and dispassionate analysis to explain observations both pleasant and unpleasant.\xa0\n\nFaith in this God-of-man theory can best be treated as a development of the primitive emotional human mind at its most innocent, childlike, seeking state. Faith created scripture - we can even marvel at the poetic expressions and emotional inputs that created some devotional scripture. We can pragmatically and patiently hear out, even study with interest all religious, devotional and ritualistic versions of the same God-of-man belief across the world as necessary stepping stones in the evolution of the human mind. Not all scriptures are unbending dogma. Some scriptures and cultures like the Indic (Bhakti-Vedantic, Buddhistic and Jain), Greek, Egyptian (Pre-Arian and Arian) and Far Eastern (Taoist, Confucian, Shinto) showed a readiness to discuss alternate viewpoints freely, while other types of scriptures like the Bible and Quran show the otherwise seeking human mind trapped at some primitive stage of thought not amenable to reasoning, with self-imposed fossilization, in the evolution of human thought processes.\nIt is\xa0completely beyond\xa0human reasoning powers to deduce the real intention due to which or without which this cosmos came into existence even with the best of telescopes, space exploration technology, knowledge of physics and mathematics – or with the most insightful of meditative techniques. We can only reason this much – the world and cosmos are not specially created for man; man matters little to other space bodies, whatever our earthly human thoughts - theist or atheist, scientific or devotional. We humans are only as significant in the big universe as may be some other creature- some worm, germ, bug or bee. In other words, humans are no more than a very ordinary, temporary production in the eternal flow of time and the incessant dynamics of the universe.\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0Thus, crops do not grow, fruits do not ripen or spices are not delicious so that humankind should be fed good food. Crops grow, hence humans can eat them – that’s all. Rivers do not flow because humankind needs water- on the contrary; we happen to get water because rivers flow. Even when it was the age of the dinosaurs before the evolution of modern humans, rivers had been flowing, flowers were blooming, the stars were twinkling – just as they do so now! Even when the earth was under the grip of the ice age, or even before the very birth of earth, this very own home planet - the sun had its cosmic motion unfazed by anything else. Why, even if this very\xa0sun\xa0or our very own Milky Way were to vanish, the rest of the cosmos would be probably as affected as the luminosity of daylight is affected by the death of a firefly. Such an unfazed, unperturbed cosmic power that would not elicit even a moment’s mourning by the sudden nemesis of a hundred suns or solar systems even on a daily basis\xa0can\xa0still be venerated as “God” (to satiate human spiritual hunger) but slightly differently - as the “God of the universe” - certainly not as our older conception of “God of Humankind”.\xa0\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0If our “God of Humankind” would\xa0not\xa0have provided even\xa0elementary\xa0aids of survival, some minimal resources to exploit or primitive conditions of protection from the wild side of nature, could anyone or anything have stopped Him from disallowing any human existence? Yet, the human race\xa0did\xa0get access to natural bounty as comprehended by our five elementary human senses,\xa0could\xa0exploit resources and\xa0could\xa0modify circumstances to make quite a few habitats hospitable to human survival.\xa0 Not only did humans survive, they prospered into civilizations. They did not just get a world, they got a rich earth, with rivers of water, edible foods, and useful animals – with fragrant flowers, scenic beauty and melodiously singing birds added in to enliven existence. The human race has eventually flourished so far, certainly not perished!\nYet, this appearance of human life on earth, juxtaposed in the evolutionary history of the earth, itself juxtaposed in the eternal universal upheaval of creation, sustenance and destruction, is no more than a speck in time, a temporary, ordinary and miniscule event not worth reckoning in the largely unknown, unfathomable history of the universe. Whatever dependability nature has shown with whatever few conditions encouraging human existence on this planet earth, are\xa0merely a coincidence. So long as this coincidence lasts, so long as we survive as humans, we humans can term this coincidence, this favorable set of circumstances, the “God of Humankind”; we can even offer Him a flower out of devotion and gratitude. To this, and only to this limited extent, can we condescend to say that the “God of Humankind” is kind to, partial towards and protective of his human “children”.\xa0\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0Mentally envisaging the “God of the universe” is merely going logically further in our God-conceptualization exercise. There are two techniques, scientific and spiritual, essentially complementary to each other. Scientifically, we have space shuttles and telescopes augmenting the eye, to note birth of stars or their celestial burial in black holes. Spiritually, ancients reached yogic contemplative planes like Saptapatal, Brahmalok, Vishnulok, Devalok, etc. through meditation augmenting the inner mind. Either way, the universe (or the “God” of the universe) is uninfluenced by prayers, unperturbed by human emotions, unaffected by human birth or death, prosperity or tragedy, too abstract to be affected by anything, partial towards no one, certainly not humans, is equally responsible for both genesis and nemesis. Neither does this power purposefully bless us, nor purposefully punish us. This “God of the universe” is too subtle and omnipotent to be a personality like a jealous Old Testament Yahweh who vindictively resorts to curses against and punishments like sending locusts and frogs against bonded followers trespassing into worshipping alternate God-forms.\xa0 The power of the “God of the universe” is also not thanks to some seat or tag of authority, like is the case of the celestial Indra (whose power being not his own but by virtue of the\xa0throne\xa0of the “ruler of heaven-residing deities”), who insecurely presupposes that anyone engrossed in meditation, sage or demon alike, can get strong enough to usurp his throne and depose him. The “God of the universe” requires no medium like angrily foaming prophets whose careers were nothing more than haranguing people into remaining bonded to the Old Testament books of dogma by issuing dire warnings, or mysterious secretive shamanic witch-doctors sacrificing poor animals to entities like demons and spirits in occult rituals while mumbling to themselves in a state of mind bordering on epilepsy, creating a whole plethora of lesser Gods, demi-Gods and other entities taking their toll tax from a seeker on a spiritual quest on the way towards the real God unluckily trespassing onto their domain of esoteric teritory. The God of the universe could freely be “He”, “She”, even “It” - we don’t know, we can call this force what we want.\n\nConceptualising God of this nature requires not just intellectual effort but also spiritual courage. We now have a God to bow before but we must learn to take care of ourselves in individual and collective crises in life within the framework of natural laws,\xa0praakrutik dharma. If one is the captain of a sinking ship, one should use all knowledge in navigation and ship mechanics to save the ship, passengers and cargo first – all prayers to the God of the ship or the God of the Seas or the God of humankind are only\xa0after\xa0all realistic efforts are instituted. Like vitamin B complex helping the main medicine fight an illness, rather than becoming the medicine itself denying other specific medicines the credit of working. Thus the God of humankind is nothing other than one side, namely the bright, congenial side - the feel-good factor - of the God of the Universe. Whether the devotionally conceived God of Humankind partial to humankind or the intellectually conceptualized God of the Universe partial towards no one, we can treat every conception with respect, since we term the conception “God”. Particularly when we have first respected the “God of humankind” and then pulled Him into the morass of half-baked notions of devotion, the “God of the universe” deserves greater respect.\nWe first invested the conception of the God of humankind with human emotions and personalities, good and bad traits, then invoked Him (or Her) to account for each and every positive or negative personal event and gradually, pulled down Divinity into the mud, demoted the stature of our conception of “divinity” into an entity that serves our selfish interests and base desires by ordinary bribes of prayer. The bigger our personal desire, the more flamboyant or expectant our prayer gets - the “God of Humankind” would do us good if we conduct some sacrificial rite, organize a Satyanarayana Pooja, attend successive masses of Novena or repeatedly visit a fakir’s mausoleum. Imagining any covenant with the “God of Humankind” simply ties us up in illogical knots - if we offer prayers of gratitude to God for saving us from danger, then who presented us with these dangers in the first place? The same “God”! First He slits our neck and then He heals it. If we should worship Him for healing us, should we also not full-fledgedly blame Him first for hurting us? It is like the story of two roadside beggars fighting amongst each other saying, “I am right, you are wrong” and desperately but unsuccessfully trying to get the judgment of superiority from an emperor whose retinue passing momentarily by their way – the emperor does not even notice, the convoy passes ahead and the two beggars go back to wrestling each other in the muck. Well, invoking the “God of Humankind” for these twin emotional outbursts of blaming and thanking, for every worthless and inconsequential event of life, is worse than the fight of these two roadside beggars. The age and limits of our universe are too big to even be measured - human devotional tantrums do not matter at all.\xa0\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0What is\xa0rational\xa0is that we can study, infer, discover, analyse, comprehend, teach each other and then recode for posterity the\xa0laws\xa0by which the universe and its components exist, govern themselves and act or interact. We can then try and align ourselves with the laws of the functioning of nature and the universe in ways beneficial to the human race, conducive to our survival. This is the only thing possible for us humans. Thus any act, behaviour or conduct of a human being conducive and helpful to the survival of the whole human race and to our habitat (the earth and “her” environment) in the long term is\xa0good, ethical and correct\xa0behaviour. On the contrary, any thought or conduct that can make us perish or destroy our own habitat, anything that can adversely affect human survival or can be a deterrent to long-term human survival of our human habitat is\xa0bad, unethical and incorrect\xa0behaviour. This definition of human ethics is workable, rational and clear to understand. But beliefs like “What ‘God’ likes is ethical” and “That which is helpful to Humans is liked by God” are untrue and untenable, in fact too childish to sustain. We need to realize that we are part of the universe, but the universe is not ours or ruled by us. To a negligible extent the universe favours us. To a much greater extent, the universe is unfavourable to us. Accepting this truth clearly, bravely and unhesitatingly is being both human and humane. And this is the true religion of the entire human race, the true worship of the “God of the universe”.'<br />Author: 'nathuram-godse'  id: 'fu2zfu'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fu2zfu/vd_savarkar_on_the_concept_of_god_the_god_of/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'V.D Savarkar on the concept of God'<br />Body: 'If we were to hit a rod onto the surface of a flowing stream, the undivided flow of water seems momentarily divided into two streams. In the evening sky, the moment the first star appears and twinkles, the otherwise unending sky appears to have acquired a point of reference, quadrisected into four cardinal directions.\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0This material world too, in all its eternity, gets divided into two parts as soon as the star of human awareness starts twinkling.\xa0 Dichotomies like the beautiful and the ugly, the fragrant and the malodorous, the melodious and the harsh to hear, the soft and the hard, the dear and the unpleasant, the good and the bad, the divine and the evil, and others emerge as soon as human need becomes the point of reference in this cosmos. All that humankind considers good, pleasant and helpful is one part of this world while all that is unpleasant, all that unfavorably or adversely affects human existence is the other part of this world. He who creates the good part is “God” while he who creates the bad part is the “Rakshas”, “Asura”, “Satan” or “Devil”. Accepting these elementary human sensibilities as the working criterion for understanding the usefulness, goodness or badness of the cosmos is quite unavoidable.\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0Our ancestors realised ages ago that it was impossible to count, analyse, characterize and qualify or quantify each and every living species and non-living entity of this immeasurable and unfathomable universe. Instinctively they chose to analyse the things and beings in the universe using the five senses humankind is gifted with- touch, sight, scent, hearing and taste. Now everything had one or more attributes one could, well, “sense”. For example, the rose was red by color, soft to touch and fragrant by scent. While a fruit was sweet or sour by taste, aromatic by scent, cool and wet to touch, with a certain appearance for the eyes. A cuckoo was black to see and sweet to hear. A breeze was cool or warm to feel (to “touch”) while a sea storm was frightening to hear, forceful to feel and salty to smell. Given the primitive times then, this very idea of using the five senses was a veritable leap of human ingenuity! They developed this thought process to call the five senses representatives of the Pancha Maha Bhootas (The Five Great Elements), namely Pruthvi (Earth or the solid state of matter), Aap (Water or the liquid state of matter), Tej (Fire, light energy or radiations), Vaayu (Wind, air or gaseous state of matter) and Aakash (Outer space, vacuum or the Great Void). Spiritually, they theologized that whatever conversation or dialogue we humans could have with the God of this universe was also through these five senses, hence they even developed the concept of the five-headed deities, like Pancha Mukhi Mahadev, Pancha Mukhi Hanuman or Pancha Mukhi Ganesha.\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0Just as the process of studying the universe and its objects and beings with our five senses was so natural and instinctive, so were the attempts at trying to figure out if there indeed was any psyche behind the very forces who could create this universe. These forces were deified and became objects of faith across ancient cultures. The thought that came forward was that by creating this bounty and abundance of natural wealth for human prosperity, Nature was indeed very kind-hearted and affectionate like a mother who provided for her children, us human beings. Nature was\xa0Mother\xa0Nature,\xa0Mother\xa0Earth,\xa0Mother\xa0Life, the Goddess “Srushti” or “Prakruti”, who tended to us her children. By psyche she was all that a mother could be- affectionate, loving and providing. This “faith” has only been reinforced from time to time by the gifts Mother Nature has been showering onto us from time and again onto humankind till today! Likewise the Creator was Father Creator, the powerful “Purusha”, who though so powerful was yet, by psyche, so kind, gentle, caring and compassionate that He laid the very seed of human existence and a habitat to sustain human life!\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0Truly, for the benefit, utility and happiness of humankind, the compassionate God has created nature with such meticulous paternal love! This sun, this ocean, how majestically big these Great Elements! But the kind God employed even them for the service of humankind. Just as a mother would keep cool sweet water filled up for her kids coming home from their play out in the afternoon sun, so does the “Sun-God”, using sunrays as suction conduits, suck up only the water sans the salt from the salty oceans thereby sparing the sweet water of the rivers – and then store up this distillate in heavenly reservoirs, making it tempting even to the Gods! Just imagine the control mechanism over this saltwater-to-Sweetwater conversion – only as much capacity is there in the sunrays for this conversion as is the water required in one year and only as much is the water storage capacity of the celestial reservoirs- the clouds. At the same time, the oceans are themselves not turned sweet, sparing our whole life from becoming tastelessly bland!\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0Look at the animals! They are of various calibers of intelligence and various specializations, as varied as the varieties of services humankind expected of them in the pre-industrial ages! The Gods taught the camels the art of eating desert thorns and going without water for days, adapting them to life in a desert habitat – and they became the ship of the desert, a lifeline for sustaining human life in the inhospitable harsh desert! And how swift is the horse! God has given him strength and forbearance to both gallop for hours and to manoevour in the midst of a pitched battle all the time balancing and bearing the weight of a human rider for hours. There are many examples of steadfast loyalty where horses have even sacrificed their life for their masters, like the horse Chetak who carried Rana Pratap to safety before dying of exhaustion. Yet God has not over endowed the horse with the intelligence to ride a human being instead. Take the dairy cow or buffalo - one just has to push dry grass from one end to get rich, creamy, fresh, life-giving milk in abundance from the other end. Really, how kind God must be to his human children for creating such a biochemical process as milk formation! What’s more - God endowed the same dairy cow or buffalo that produces milk with the ability to leave behind her own progeny, a reproduced copy, with the very same miraculous biochemical abilities to turn dry unpalatable inedible grass into sweet, creamy milk before she retires or passes away. A milk-vending machine that vends not just milk but also another milk-vending machine!\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0One has to sow just one grain of wheat - and it turns into a plant producing more than a hundred grains! Just\xa0one\xa0mango – a divinely juicy, delicious, nutritious, pulpy fruit – but it comes with its own seed that if sown and nurtured, turns into a majestic tree that gives\xa0hundreds\xa0of juicy mangoes for generations of a human family, year after year. Not just that, the mango even appears by branch grafting, producing whole orchards after orchards of the noble fruit in veritable abundance! Rice, millet or other varieties of different foodgrains with different nutrient profiles and tastes grow in all sorts of climatic conditions – in each case, one gets a whole sack full from one single, sowed grain. The varieties of fruits- pomegranates, bananas, apples, figs, jackfruits, dates… from different climatic profiles follow the same law - just\xa0one\xa0sown seed supplies enough fruit for satisfying the needs of at least a small family! All sorts of tasty, nutritious vegetables grow by themselves when kind of “ordered” by the mere act of being sown – the Lord God made this possible for us his human children! Then there’s sugarcane, after all a mere grass – with its weed-like propensity to proliferate wherever water is available. But when humans discovered its sweet juice, it just had to be disciplined into growing within the space allotted to it and nurtured by irrigation before it grew into vast lush stretches of such a generous produce that after being squeezed of its last drop of sweet juice by industrial scale sugar extraction processes, can still provide basic roughage to field oxen from leftovers! In fact, today’s scientists in the field of unconventional energy resources are researching the possibility of employing crops like sugarcane and even weeds from hillsides to generate the bio-fuel ethanol just when the world thought its fossil fuels were getting used up! Truly, when one resource dries up, another becomes available! How\xa0can\xa0we humans\xa0ever\xa0even quantify, leave alone repay, the kindness that God showered on humankind, making arrangements for every aspect of human existence!\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0And what about human anatomy!\xa0 From the soles of our feet to the most microscopic of the organelles of the brain, the layout of the human body is full of masterly, orderly planning and co-ordination- O Lord, how meticulously Thou hath designed our bodies for us! Our\xa0human\xa0eye- how many ages, eons, generations of evolutionary experiments hath Thou conducted to bring our eye to its present capabilities? Initially the eye was just a nervous tissue able to merely make out a ray of light, which could only differentiate illumination from utter darkness, recognize a shadow more than actual details of a form; but by continuous evolutionary experiments, trials and errors, we humans now have our beautiful, spherical, moist – and –\xa0ambitious\xa0human eye. Today the human eye is so capable that we humans have the ambitious foresight(!) to beat Thee at Thy own game, by inventing a duplicate eye, an extension, the telescope, to view not just the interiors of Thy own cosmic laboratory of outer space, but to discover none other than\xa0Thee Thyself\xa0 somewhere in space!\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0Further, how\xa0can\xa0one ever describe fully the festival of beauty and colours Thou hath conducted in the Three Worlds? The ultra-delicate flower of the Parijaat, the ultra-fragrant Golden Champak flower! The peacock’s vibrant plumage – the colors and design of every feather, the peacock’s inimitable gait! What a natural artist that noble bird is! When I watch the bird spread his plumage, dance with excitement and cry out aloud, believe me, O God, even my heart dances in sync with every step of this gifted bird and cries out Thy glory in admiration of Thy divine creation. In fact, I feel like sulking that\xa0I\xa0do not have the wonderful plumage of the peacock. The whole earthly creation resounds with the songs of birds and is a kaleidoscope of pleasant sights and landscapes! Roses, chamelis, bakulis, Juhis, Jaais, Champak, sandalwood, Ketakis… creepers and shrubs in full bloom, whole gardens full of them freshening and lending fragrance to the atmosphere! The Gods of love, Madan and Rati, are busy linking the hearts of lovers! The nights are starry, the dawns are pink, youth is confident and fresh, sleep is sound and deep, and love is like a cool breeze heralding the rhapsody of springtime. There is material and spiritual growth all over… O Lord, how can we humans not help thinking that such a beautiful world was created specially for us by Thee? If we love, nurture, protect and provide for our children, so doth Thee. Thou truly art both our father and mother and we Thy children. Even the milk our mothers give us is given ultimately by you. O Lord, we are Thy devotees and Thou, the Lord God of humankind, the God of Man!\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0Not just that, Thou art the only God, there can be no other and Thou hath created this world specifically for our peace and prosperity!\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0… This ideology, this concept of “The God of humankind” creating the universe specially for the survival and prosperity of Humankind could indeed have proved truthful and correct – if and only if everything, every being and all conditions in this world would have been only helpful, pleasant, beneficial and useful to humankind.\xa0\nBut alas! The cold fact is that most of this earth, the very earth we instinctively consider Mother Earth, Mother Nature and Mother Life is hardly all that safe, protective, kind and considerate to us humans as we were just philosophizing. On the contrary, the living conditions existent on this planet and influences of the atmosphere, the sun, moon and stars in reality seem to contradict our pet theory of faith too much – conditions that obtain on earth are mostly inhospitable, harsh, with the law of the Jungle working all the time around us. Humankind has to struggle for its very survival and struggle still further for ensuring prosperity.\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0Take a good look at the very Sun and oceans we sung paeans in praise of just some time ago. The way the unsparing rays of the hot sun finish off a helpless victim of sunstroke or heatstroke is quite comparable to the ruthlessness with which a gatekeeper watchman beats a poisonous snake by repeated relentless blows- striking the final blows even when half-dead. In the very India where millions of Hindu Brahmins offer prayers to the Sun God every sunrise and sunset, the very same sun shines hot for the entire spell of a drought or famine, even lasting several years, killing thousands of heatstroke, hunger or thirst.\xa0\nIn the Quran, Talmud, Torah and Bible, devout prophets sang in praise of God Yahweh, “For us Humans, O God, Thee hath kept a plentiful supply of fish for us to eat in the oceans!” But the same oceans are also full of creatures like human-eating sharks which can eat a human body alive and whole. The oceans are also teeming with other forms of sea life like poisonous snakes, sting rays, electric rays and the Portuguese-Man-of-war which can either kill, maim or in any other way seriously harm any human form in sea-water – a swimmer or diver, a shipwrecked sailor, a fisherman, marine biologist or oceanologist – the ocean Gods are quite busy nurturing these forms of life harmful to man with sustained impartiality. Quite similar to a mugger who first poses as a traveler’s guide, then waits for an opportune time to shed his mask to finally loot his trusting quarry in the middle of nowhere, the ocean, while carrying afloat thousands of rafts, boats and vessels at a time, suddenly throws some of them off its back and into its terrible jaws to swallow up entire vessels and ocean liners like the doomed Titanic, drowning all the thousands of people aboard in one gulp. Oceans can unpredictably erupt into tsunamis sucking entire populations of coastal settlements into their watery graves.\xa0\nRivers in Africa, Australia and South America are full of potentially human-eating creatures like alligators, piranha and crocodiles. The holy rivers, on whose banks civilizations and cities flourished, can swallow up entire townships or at least several thousand helpless people and animals in one spate, be they the Holy Mother Ganges or Jamnaji, the Brahmaputra, Hwang-Ho or Nile, the Holy Jordan or the Father Thames.\xa0\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0Primitive Semitic devotion believed in the Abrahamic Books that the Elohim (Yahweh of the Bible and Allah of the Quran) created the goat, lamb, deer and other creatures so that his believers would get lots of meat to eat! But the devotion with which the believer smacks his lips on seeing “food” animals blinds him to the obvious fact that the same world in which he resides with his “food” animals is also home to potentially man-eating animals like the big wild cats, crocodiles, bears and sharks. If a man-eating Sunderban Royal Bengal tiger preys on an unsuspecting human child and is spotted smacking his lips after devouring the child’s flesh, should we say that God created small human children with tender flesh just so that some man-eater can have a delicious meal? And as if to provide icing on a cake, the world has its share of dangerous vegetarian beasts as well, from the very herbivorous African river hippos that can cut a human form into two in one snap of their jaws (just as easily as we crunch a slice of cucumber at our dinner table), to the grass-munching land giants like the bison or Assamese rhinos and ultimately the largest land mammal, the\xa0 solitary bull African elephants all of whom are known to kill humans more often than do the carnivorous big cats. \xa0\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0When a tsunami strikes a coast, it sucks in everything it can from coastal human inhabitation- brides in their own wedding ceremonies about to garland their grooms, mothers suckling their meek hungry and vulnerable infants, artists with unfinished paintings and sculptures, lovers locked mid-ardor oblivious to the world, devotees in mid-meditation with spiritual ecstasy… entire cities like Dwarika and Atlantis, regions and subcontinents have gone under water, got buried under volcanic lava like Pompeii… as quickly as Ganesh devotees immerse a Ganesh idol in the sea – with cataclysmic precision. And yet, the next daybreak, the same Dawn Goddess Usha, who was soulfully venerated with sacred chants of the Vedas, appears as pink as always over the destruction.\xa0\nThe Quran quotes that Allah created the moon so that the believer could tell the parts of the day to know when to offer namaz. But when the “infidel’ Chengiz Khan stormed Baghdad, the cultural capital of Islamdom, massacring all Momins in his wake, slaughtering clerics and the Caliph with his family, demolishing the whole city, razing all buildings and walking over a pile of cut heads of killed Muslims, did not the moon still rise over the same Baghdad that night too, informing the namaz-hating Chengiz Khan about the times of the day just as it did the namaz-performing Muslims?\xa0\n\nFragrant flowers, melodiously singing songbirds, the haughty peacock with his inimitable plumage, even entire forests get roasted alive in a single bushfire or forest fire, like we roast a brinjal on a flame. \nWhile a human population trustingly plays the game of life in the daytime and rests secure every night in the lap of Mother Earth, some particular moment the same terra firma demolishes the unsuspecting population with one earthquake tremor – buildings get flattened, both huts and architecturally marvelous monuments of human creativity and civilisation, like a pack of cards ceases to exist. Entire villages can be swallowed alive in a moment with the same earth opening up a giant crevice in an earthquake!\xa0\nHistorically giant meteors have hit the earth and in some cases, even set in massive cycles of climatic change and destruction with extinctions of entire species. Can a flaming comet also not suddenly appear out of the blue (from outer space) and hit the surface of the earth setting ablaze entire regions much like a flaming torch can set ablaze a whole pile of cotton?\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0For every lifestyle there exists a dysfunction. The human body, when diseased, is a museum of pathologies and pain- furuncles, epilepsy, tumours, agony, coma, palpitations, diabetes and heart arrests… The world out there has its rounds of bubonic plagues, famines, cholera epidemics …\xa0\nOur faith and belief that humankind is the centre of reference for the whole universe and that not just\xa0our own\xa0planet - the earth with her plentiful resources and life forms - but the whole\xa0cosmos\xa0was created by God\xa0only\xa0for humankind,\xa0only\xa0to favour humankind,\xa0only\xa0to provide pleasure to humankind and\xa0only\xa0out of special partisan fondness for humankind, eventually crystallized into belief systems, some open to contrary thought and other times closed to alternative view-points, like unbending dogma unwilling to confront rationalism. We humans even created religious texts of this dogma, selectively only documenting phenomena supportive of our theory that God first manufactures and then employs even stars, planets, comets, black holes, galaxies and constellations exclusively for sustaining human existence, protecting human life, providing fun, pleasure and entertainment to humans and eternally providing resources to human civilization, happiness and prosperity. This blinkered approach has only blinded us to stark, obvious natural phenomena and unpleasant observations of accidents and natural catastrophes endured by humankind that contradict our doctrine of “God’s Creation for human welfare”. We have to free ourselves of the shackles of this dogmatic conditioning to outgrow our primary assumption and adopt the approach of unbiased reasoning and dispassionate analysis to explain observations both pleasant and unpleasant.\xa0\n\nFaith in this God-of-man theory can best be treated as a development of the primitive emotional human mind at its most innocent, childlike, seeking state. Faith created scripture - we can even marvel at the poetic expressions and emotional inputs that created some devotional scripture. We can pragmatically and patiently hear out, even study with interest all religious, devotional and ritualistic versions of the same God-of-man belief across the world as necessary stepping stones in the evolution of the human mind. Not all scriptures are unbending dogma. Some scriptures and cultures like the Indic (Bhakti-Vedantic, Buddhistic and Jain), Greek, Egyptian (Pre-Arian and Arian) and Far Eastern (Taoist, Confucian, Shinto) showed a readiness to discuss alternate viewpoints freely, while other types of scriptures like the Bible and Quran show the otherwise seeking human mind trapped at some primitive stage of thought not amenable to reasoning, with self-imposed fossilization, in the evolution of human thought processes.\nIt is\xa0completely beyond\xa0human reasoning powers to deduce the real intention due to which or without which this cosmos came into existence even with the best of telescopes, space exploration technology, knowledge of physics and mathematics – or with the most insightful of meditative techniques. We can only reason this much – the world and cosmos are not specially created for man; man matters little to other space bodies, whatever our earthly human thoughts - theist or atheist, scientific or devotional. We humans are only as significant in the big universe as may be some other creature- some worm, germ, bug or bee. In other words, humans are no more than a very ordinary, temporary production in the eternal flow of time and the incessant dynamics of the universe.\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0Thus, crops do not grow, fruits do not ripen or spices are not delicious so that humankind should be fed good food. Crops grow, hence humans can eat them – that’s all. Rivers do not flow because humankind needs water- on the contrary; we happen to get water because rivers flow. Even when it was the age of the dinosaurs before the evolution of modern humans, rivers had been flowing, flowers were blooming, the stars were twinkling – just as they do so now! Even when the earth was under the grip of the ice age, or even before the very birth of earth, this very own home planet - the sun had its cosmic motion unfazed by anything else. Why, even if this very\xa0sun\xa0or our very own Milky Way were to vanish, the rest of the cosmos would be probably as affected as the luminosity of daylight is affected by the death of a firefly. Such an unfazed, unperturbed cosmic power that would not elicit even a moment’s mourning by the sudden nemesis of a hundred suns or solar systems even on a daily basis\xa0can\xa0still be venerated as “God” (to satiate human spiritual hunger) but slightly differently - as the “God of the universe” - certainly not as our older conception of “God of Humankind”.\xa0\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0If our “God of Humankind” would\xa0not\xa0have provided even\xa0elementary\xa0aids of survival, some minimal resources to exploit or primitive conditions of protection from the wild side of nature, could anyone or anything have stopped Him from disallowing any human existence? Yet, the human race\xa0did\xa0get access to natural bounty as comprehended by our five elementary human senses,\xa0could\xa0exploit resources and\xa0could\xa0modify circumstances to make quite a few habitats hospitable to human survival.\xa0 Not only did humans survive, they prospered into civilizations. They did not just get a world, they got a rich earth, with rivers of water, edible foods, and useful animals – with fragrant flowers, scenic beauty and melodiously singing birds added in to enliven existence. The human race has eventually flourished so far, certainly not perished!\nYet, this appearance of human life on earth, juxtaposed in the evolutionary history of the earth, itself juxtaposed in the eternal universal upheaval of creation, sustenance and destruction, is no more than a speck in time, a temporary, ordinary and miniscule event not worth reckoning in the largely unknown, unfathomable history of the universe. Whatever dependability nature has shown with whatever few conditions encouraging human existence on this planet earth, are\xa0merely a coincidence. So long as this coincidence lasts, so long as we survive as humans, we humans can term this coincidence, this favorable set of circumstances, the “God of Humankind”; we can even offer Him a flower out of devotion and gratitude. To this, and only to this limited extent, can we condescend to say that the “God of Humankind” is kind to, partial towards and protective of his human “children”.\xa0\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0Mentally envisaging the “God of the universe” is merely going logically further in our God-conceptualization exercise. There are two techniques, scientific and spiritual, essentially complementary to each other. Scientifically, we have space shuttles and telescopes augmenting the eye, to note birth of stars or their celestial burial in black holes. Spiritually, ancients reached yogic contemplative planes like Saptapatal, Brahmalok, Vishnulok, Devalok, etc. through meditation augmenting the inner mind. Either way, the universe (or the “God” of the universe) is uninfluenced by prayers, unperturbed by human emotions, unaffected by human birth or death, prosperity or tragedy, too abstract to be affected by anything, partial towards no one, certainly not humans, is equally responsible for both genesis and nemesis. Neither does this power purposefully bless us, nor purposefully punish us. This “God of the universe” is too subtle and omnipotent to be a personality like a jealous Old Testament Yahweh who vindictively resorts to curses against and punishments like sending locusts and frogs against bonded followers trespassing into worshipping alternate God-forms.\xa0 The power of the “God of the universe” is also not thanks to some seat or tag of authority, like is the case of the celestial Indra (whose power being not his own but by virtue of the\xa0throne\xa0of the “ruler of heaven-residing deities”), who insecurely presupposes that anyone engrossed in meditation, sage or demon alike, can get strong enough to usurp his throne and depose him. The “God of the universe” requires no medium like angrily foaming prophets whose careers were nothing more than haranguing people into remaining bonded to the Old Testament books of dogma by issuing dire warnings, or mysterious secretive shamanic witch-doctors sacrificing poor animals to entities like demons and spirits in occult rituals while mumbling to themselves in a state of mind bordering on epilepsy, creating a whole plethora of lesser Gods, demi-Gods and other entities taking their toll tax from a seeker on a spiritual quest on the way towards the real God unluckily trespassing onto their domain of esoteric teritory. The God of the universe could freely be “He”, “She”, even “It” - we don’t know, we can call this force what we want.\n\nConceptualising God of this nature requires not just intellectual effort but also spiritual courage. We now have a God to bow before but we must learn to take care of ourselves in individual and collective crises in life within the framework of natural laws,\xa0praakrutik dharma. If one is the captain of a sinking ship, one should use all knowledge in navigation and ship mechanics to save the ship, passengers and cargo first – all prayers to the God of the ship or the God of the Seas or the God of humankind are only\xa0after\xa0all realistic efforts are instituted. Like vitamin B complex helping the main medicine fight an illness, rather than becoming the medicine itself denying other specific medicines the credit of working. Thus the God of humankind is nothing other than one side, namely the bright, congenial side - the feel-good factor - of the God of the Universe. Whether the devotionally conceived God of Humankind partial to humankind or the intellectually conceptualized God of the Universe partial towards no one, we can treat every conception with respect, since we term the conception “God”. Particularly when we have first respected the “God of humankind” and then pulled Him into the morass of half-baked notions of devotion, the “God of the universe” deserves greater respect.\nWe first invested the conception of the God of humankind with human emotions and personalities, good and bad traits, then invoked Him (or Her) to account for each and every positive or negative personal event and gradually, pulled down Divinity into the mud, demoted the stature of our conception of “divinity” into an entity that serves our selfish interests and base desires by ordinary bribes of prayer. The bigger our personal desire, the more flamboyant or expectant our prayer gets - the “God of Humankind” would do us good if we conduct some sacrificial rite, organize a Satyanarayana Pooja, attend successive masses of Novena or repeatedly visit a fakir’s mausoleum. Imagining any covenant with the “God of Humankind” simply ties us up in illogical knots - if we offer prayers of gratitude to God for saving us from danger, then who presented us with these dangers in the first place? The same “God”! First He slits our neck and then He heals it. If we should worship Him for healing us, should we also not full-fledgedly blame Him first for hurting us? It is like the story of two roadside beggars fighting amongst each other saying, “I am right, you are wrong” and desperately but unsuccessfully trying to get the judgment of superiority from an emperor whose retinue passing momentarily by their way – the emperor does not even notice, the convoy passes ahead and the two beggars go back to wrestling each other in the muck. Well, invoking the “God of Humankind” for these twin emotional outbursts of blaming and thanking, for every worthless and inconsequential event of life, is worse than the fight of these two roadside beggars. The age and limits of our universe are too big to even be measured - human devotional tantrums do not matter at all.\xa0\n\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0What is\xa0rational\xa0is that we can study, infer, discover, analyse, comprehend, teach each other and then recode for posterity the\xa0laws\xa0by which the universe and its components exist, govern themselves and act or interact. We can then try and align ourselves with the laws of the functioning of nature and the universe in ways beneficial to the human race, conducive to our survival. This is the only thing possible for us humans. Thus any act, behaviour or conduct of a human being conducive and helpful to the survival of the whole human race and to our habitat (the earth and “her” environment) in the long term is\xa0good, ethical and correct\xa0behaviour. On the contrary, any thought or conduct that can make us perish or destroy our own habitat, anything that can adversely affect human survival or can be a deterrent to long-term human survival of our human habitat is\xa0bad, unethical and incorrect\xa0behaviour. This definition of human ethics is workable, rational and clear to understand. But beliefs like “What ‘God’ likes is ethical” and “That which is helpful to Humans is liked by God” are untrue and untenable, in fact too childish to sustain. We need to realize that we are part of the universe, but the universe is not ours or ruled by us. To a negligible extent the universe favours us. To a much greater extent, the universe is unfavourable to us. Accepting this truth clearly, bravely and unhesitatingly is being both human and humane. And this is the true religion of the entire human race, the true worship of the “God of the universe”.'<br />Author: 'nathuram-godse'  id: 'fu2y9l'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fu2y9l/vd_savarkar_on_the_concept_of_god/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Why do Indians look the way they do? Why are their bodies built in such a way?'<br />Body: "This may sound like a stupid question, but its important. Below are some observations and hypothesis that I've come up with. Feel free to refute if you know better, we can all learn from this interaction. \n\n**1) Indians are more prone to diabetes than other ethnicities -** Its because Indian food can be very sugary, especially the snacks. The reason for that is because in the olden days when almost all of India is agrarian, people can cope with the overdose of sugar. All of that glucose will be turned to energy in the field. These days, Indians don't do a lot of physical work, but their diet didn't change according to their lifestyle. \n\n**2) Indians sweat profusely -** This is because of hot climate. Sweat stabilizes the body temperature and allows humans to carry on doing what they do under the Sun. In India, I'm sure the farmers who sweat a lot tend to get more work done, so overtime this trait became favorable. \n\n**3) North Indians are of medium-height, South Indians are short -** It's because ANI people are largely pastoral while ASI are almost 100% agrarian. Just as in East Asia, short people have an advantage in the farm, because they are nimble and require less energy to work for a long time. Over time, this trait became prevalent. \n\n**4) Many Indians are hairy -** I think this trait came from Central Asia. Body hair helps in insulating heat. So during cold weather, the hair traps heat and allows body to be warm. In parts of India which is not near the coast, the temperature can drop by a lot at night, so body hair is still helpful and so stayed within the population. \n\n**5) Indians have a relatively low-metabolism rate -** It's the reason why rich and middle-class Indians, including ethnic Indians in developed countries, have an obesity problem. Perhaps low-metabolism helps during food shortage. Think about it, if your body burns all the carb to energy so quickly, then you need to keep feeding your body a lot of food. So my theory is that during the ancient times, many parts of India had food crisis from time-to-time, and this trait helped in limiting the amount of carb that gets burned."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'fu1cql'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fu1cql/why_do_indians_look_the_way_they_do_why_are_their/</li>

Today, we are passing through an exceptionally difficult time due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn additional to this, further problems confront humanity such as extreme climate change. I would like to take this opportunity to express my admiration and gratitude to governments across the world, including the Government of India, for the steps they are taking to meet these challenges.  \n\nAncient Indian tradition describes the creations, abiding and destruction of worlds over time.  Among the causes of such destruction are arms and disease, which seems to accord with what we are experiencing today.  However, despite the enormous challenges we face, living beings, including humans, have shown a remarkable ability to survive.\n\nNo matter how difficult the situation may be, we should employ science and human ingenuity with determination and courage to overcome the problems that confront us.  Faced with threats to our health and well-being, it is natural to feel anxiety and fear.  Nevertheless, I take great solace in the following wise advice to examine the problems before us: "If there is something to be done - do it, without any need to worry; if there\'s nothing to be done, worrying about it further will not help.\n\nEveryone at present is doing their best to contain the spread of the coronavirus.  I applaud the concerted efforts of nations to limit the threat.  In particular, I appreciate the initiative India has taken with SAARC countries to set up an emergency fund and an electronic platform to exchange information, knowledge and expertise to tackle the spread of Covid-19.  This will serve as a model for dealing with such crises in the future as well.\n\nI understand that as a result of the necessary lock-downs across the world, many people are facing tremendous hardship due to a loss of livelihood.  For those with no stable income, life is a daily struggle for survival.  I earnestly appeal to all concerned to do everything possible to care for the vulnerable members of our communities.\n\nI offer special gratitude to the medical staff - doctors, nurses and other support personnel -  who are working on the frontlines to save lives at great personal risk.  Their service is indeed compassion in action.\n \nWith heartfelt feelings of concern for my brothers and sisters around the world who are passing through these difficult times, I pray for an early end to this pandemic so that your peace and happiness may soon be restored.\n\nWith my prayers,\n\nDalai Lama\n\n\nSource: https://mailchi.mp/8b11ba0f70a4/ibc-newsletter-issue-4006358?e=9db75d14a2'<br />Author: 'boomer1man'  id: 'ftrgp9'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ftrgp9/a_message_from_his_holiness_the_14th_dalai_lama/</li>

As I grew older I became more aware of the social issues here and started making comparisons to Bharat. \n\nThe first and foremost think I have noticed is that leftists don't understand and value their culture. With majority of leftists being hindu, middle upper to upper class people, (may be wrong correct me if so) ey haven't really left the shell of their own life restricted to themselves their family and their job. These leftists, from a young age, begin to take in heaps and heaps of western influences and start thinking it's cool to be left and woke and edgy. My opinion is that it does not work. The whole idea of 'hindu guilt' which is permeating the left is extremely dangerous, and if not acted upon with swiftness and a hard-nose, it could destroy Bharat.\n\nSecondly, I feel a noticeable difference is that in western countries, it's cool to be tough and in Bharat especially it's cool to be woke and the peaceful kind. In Sydney especially, the ethnicities with the most respect are wogs (middle easterners) and islanders (Polynesians). These ethnicities have built an image of respect by starting gangs, feuds, getting sent to jail and making music. However, Indians as viewed to be very weak and are taken as a joke, which is frankly annoying considering the long lineage of Kshatriyas and warriors we have had. In Bharat, the more peaceful you are the more cooler you are. I feel as well if we are not winning either front, overseas or in Bharat. We, as Hindus, should become tougher, and ready to get physical and use our voice without fear of repercussions.\n\nI have many more things to say, but I type this up late at night and I still have school the next day :(.

      <li>Title::: '22nd March 2020. One for our future history books!'<br />Body: 'This is not a letter or a statement. This piece does not have any intention of putting someone down, venting, ranting, opposing or supporting any religious, political or social views. Think of it as another piece of art/literature put out by a quarantined citizen of the world during the coronavirus. Just the start of this piece has given me a sense of realisation of how miniscule my opinions and I are, hence I will talk only specifically of things I have witnessed in the city; more specifically the area where I live. Once again, I do not have any ill intentions. I hope you enjoy reading this just as a slice of humour birthed from my head or as a small part of the history which you’ll can look back on years from now, if you make it out alive, obviously. Usually takes me a few drinks to get the thought process flowing, but this one is being done completely sober, so please bear with me. Be nice!\n\nOn Sunday, 22nd March 2020, we Indians observed a day in history which we will have to talk about years from now. A day we must’ve seen together for the first time since the Emergency. While the world stood together to fight of a virus that at the moment is being compared to something that is symbolising the end of the world, India was dealing with another situation. Women clicking selfies and telling each other how pretty they are, because why not? India has finally given women a platform after years of oppression, how dare COVID-19 steal the spotlight from feminism! Women together are struggling to fight COVID-19 from stealing their thunder by posting Instagram stories and tagging other women encouraging them to do the same!  If that’s not enough, people are now drawing fuckin fruits and vegetables on their stories! Take it easy guys, Modi clearly said essential services are still open, food included… you hungry little bastards.\n\nComing back to the point; on Friday 20th March our Honourable Prime Minister, Sri Narendra Modi spoke to the nation at 8pm, telling us to keep our spirits high and that we would get through this situation together. First thoughts? – Great! Now give us the antidote? Some kind of research statistics? Tell us how close we are from winning this fight? Or how far? Alright, just tell us how much money you’ve allocated to fight this virus? Any emergency hospitals? New quarantine zones? Taskforce establishment for medical check ups? Oh! Janta Curfew? Okay that works too. Oh… only from 7am-9pm on Sunday. Enforced by the law? Okay so let me get this straight, Mr. Modi, the man with a plan, you have asked 1.3 billion people to stay at home on a Sunday for 14 hours? That’s the solution? OH! My bad I should’ve let you complete, while we stay home, we have to come to our windows, balconies, terraces and doors to clap, ring bells and bang vessels for the noble people who are working during the time of the virus to fight it as well as maintain the structure of our nation by not bringing it to a complete halt? What a noble man you are! I’d like to come to my window and clap for you right now. Thank you for this. We as a nation, needed to come together and be made a fool off because you are not satisfied by the fool’s we made of ourselves during the last election?\n\nBasically, we, the citizens of India, have been urged and requested to stay indoors on Sunday for our well-being. This curfew is by the people, for the people (where have I heard this before?) giving it the name, ‘Janta Curfew’, but our prime minister has requested the police help enforce this ‘voluntary’ curfew by making sure people aren’t roaming around in public. Well said Mr. Modi, good choice of words. Is there anything you can’t sell?\n\nComing to the fateful Sunday, it was almost like any other Sunday… for me. On waking up and going to my balcony, I realised; it wasn’t like any other Sunday. The streets were empty. Clean. There was no construction sound, there was no smoke in the air, there weren’t people begging on the streets (I mean, who’d they beg to anyway!) the sea seemed more… blue. The only sounds I could hear at 11:30am were the birds, the strong breeze blowing through my hair and for the first time during the day, my thoughts! I knew just then., it truly was a historic moment. Seeing pictures and videos from various places around the city and listening to the people who complained about the city and wanted to move away, smiling and proudly putting up pictures of the city made me feel humoured.  They finally saw what I saw. The beauty of my city. It truly has potential. Nothing less than California or New York. I was glad the city could finally breathe, be loved and looked after. Under the dirt, pollution, garbage, filthy people and traffic; the city looks like art. Of course, the faults of this city are what gives it more character compared to the rest; and I love it, even with all its faults. I’ll save this thought for another piece though. \n\nI walked out of my balcony and towards my living room where my breakfast had been served (yeah, privilege, I know…) surprisingly I see my family getting together and assembling. Family meeting? No, that was scheduled for when something went wrong? Intervention for my sleep schedule? No, they know I snap in the morning, they wouldn’t risk it…Well I’m not going to be hypocrite and hide things about myself so here goes; my family had a little meeting scheduled. It was a get-together with the gods. It was serious. My family; led by grandfather, willingly or out of respect, had decided to have a sit down with the gods. As you can see, I’m not a big fan of the men above us and I chose to not partake in the conference my family was having. They prayed, chanted and rang bells well I enjoyed the serenity in my balcony. If the virus is taken care off by tomorrow, you know who to thank. \n\nAt 4:45pm I realised what today was about, it was about clapping from our windows! I put off the movie I was watching, washed up and looked myself in the mirror. For some reason I was nervous. Why? I didn’t have to perform. I didn’t have to give a speech, interview or pose for photograph. So why the stage fright? Through some internalisation I realised it was just performance anxiety. Not for myself, but the others. Our democratic nation has never been on the same page and in agreement about anything. Was it going to be just my Modi supporting family cheering from the windows? Maybe that’s what I was nervous about?\n\nAt precisely 4:55pm I realised what was happening. Just like Indian men, the people got a little too excited a little too soon (pre-mature…) resulting in the noise going off sooner than expected.\nWe started clapping 5 minutes earlier than decided and lasted a whole 20 minutes. That’s 15 minutes more than expected (unlike the Indian men) in this timespan, I noticed a few amusing things.\n\nAlcohol was still sold. Fewer drunk men on the street, nonetheless, they were present. How and where they got it from? Come on! You can’t stop the sale of something this valuable to us! It doesn’t work in Gujarat, what makes you think Mumbai will allow it, even for 14 hours? We can do without bread, butter, milk, eggs, sanitiser and toilet paper, but not our drinks. You can take Mumbai out of the drunk, but not the drunk out of Mumbai! Other than the random hooligans sitting on road, drinking and hurling abuses at coronavirus (man I wish I was that drunk) I saw people in my building drinking as well! I spied with my little eyes (well they’re big actually) a few people had a little get together at a flat 2 floors below mine, the older men sat on the window and enjoyed their drinks while obviously discussing religion and politics, I assumed. Or maybe they discussed how they could’ve had a better solution compared to the Curfew (don’t we all feel like that).\n\nLooking back at the street I saw the policemen had suddenly come onto the streets.  After sitting in hiding, avoiding work the entire day, they’ve jumped out and are now grabbing their only opportunity of being appreciated. As Mercedes and BMWs passed by, the happy cops waved out at them, but we all know how much our cops hate people on bikes! As soon as one passed by, the police gathered together to stop him, lecture him, threaten to hit him and then sent him back his way, while people still clapped at their windows and cars passed by, waving at them.\nThe patrol bikes started moving around on the street like they had imposed the curfew themselves. It almost felt like Republic Day. Riding with one arm and waving out to us with the other. Thank you Shahrukh Khan for making it every Indians dream to wave out to the public! And thank you Honourable Prime Minister; for fulfilling the dreams of these hardworking, underpaid men.\n\nWhile we stood like fools at our windows creating a commotion after a complete Day of Silence, I saw the birds fluttering away because they had no where to sit. The dogs were running around wild on the street, I’m sure they must’ve wondered how Diwali came early this year (but so do all Indian men…. Ok ill stop, I’m an Indian man too, after all) We did well up until 5pm.\n\nOnce again, after some conversations with a very intellectual individual (that being myself) i noticed the brighter side, I think we all got a taste of togetherness. We haven’t been this united since 1947. It may have been for a whimsical activity but we still stood together. We came out. We showed up. We stood for what we believed in. We contributed in whatever small way we felt was right. This happened all over our country today. Like I said, this isn’t being written to bash anyone, but maybe it can be seen as a thank you. Thank you for making us believe in ourselves. Thank you for bringing us together. Thank you to everyone who came and showed up and did what they felt was right. This is the first step. Now that we have a taste of unity, now that we know that we can come together in times of struggle to support one another, lets stick by it. Let’s grow and change ourselves. Let’s stand together and deal with issues that need to be dealt with; not as a class, community, gender or religion but as a nation. \n\nToday, I clap for you. For each and every person that came out to their windows, even if it was just to watch. You are the future.\n\nUntil the next apocalypse.\n\n\nHumorously yours,\n\nAn Indian Citizen.'<br />Author: 'peevee555'  id: 'fthoe7'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fthoe7/22nd_march_2020_one_for_our_future_history_books/</li>

What does that mean? I help people improve their mental health so that they can prevent/avoid mental health issues. Think of it this way - a trainer and nutritionist can help you get healthy and fit so you're less vulnerable to illness and common injury. But that doesn't mean you won't get hurt, or won't fall sick occasionally, in which case, you will then go to a doctor to help you out. I am that trainer - but for mental health. \n\nI primarily work with undergraduate students on college campuses. I also spend a lot of time on Reddit. For a long while now, I kept seeing posts about feeling lonely, not being able to fit in, looking for activities etc. on Indian city subs. So I launched weekly discussion sessions that everyone could participate in at Cubbon Park in Bangalore. Given the current necessity for anti-socialization, I started hosting webinars instead a few weeks ago. \n\nNow, I figure that people across the country have Internet, not just Bangaloreans, so why not open up the discussions to everyone who'd like to join? The theme is 'Happiness for Millennials' - what happiness means to us, what obstacles we face, how to get there. **These aren't lessons on how to be happy.** So if you're thinking, 'heh I'm happy I don't need to participate', well, that's exactly why you should! Show everyone what happiness can look like! \n\nI host the webinar every Sunday morning, but based on the responses, I might have to make some changes, maybe open up more slots.

They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.**  \n.  \n.  \n**PURPORT**  \n.  \nIn the proper discharge of duty, one has to learn to tolerate nonpermanent appearances and disappearances of happiness and distress. According to Vedic injunction, one has to take his bath early in the morning even during the month of Māgha (January-February). It is very cold at that time, but in spite of that a man who abides by the religious principles does not hesitate to take his bath. Similarly, a woman does not hesitate to cook in the kitchen in the months of May and June, the hottest part of the summer season. One has to execute his duty in spite of climatic inconveniences. Similarly, to fight is the religious principle of the kṣatriyas, and although one has to fight with some friend or relative, one should not deviate from his prescribed duty. One has to follow the prescribed rules and regulations of religious principles in order to rise up to the platform of knowledge because by knowledge and devotion only can one liberate himself from the clutches of māyā (illusion).  \n.  \nThe two different names of address given to Arjuna are also significant. To address him as Kaunteya signifies his great blood relations from his mother's side; and to address him as Bhārata signifies his greatness from his father's side. From both sides he is supposed to have a great heritage. A great heritage brings responsibility in the matter of proper discharge of duties; therefore, he cannot avoid fighting.  \n.  \n**Question 1 : Why one should follow the prescribed rules and regulations of religious principles ?**  \n.  \n**Question 2 : What is the significance of the words Kaunteya and Bhārata with reference tot his verse ?**  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/76me3gnjebq41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b1e3a1609efdc4f52501db63bd4b0999222ca8d\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'fte1my'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fte1my/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_214/</li>

While it is a travel-oriented discussion, here you have several foreigners who have been all over the world but still end up having more hassles in India. The general takeaway from the comments is that while India has lots of great things about it, solo traveling it is not a good idea, especially if you are female, and that poverty, pollution, dirtiness, scams, sexual harassment, and corruption are worse in India than in many other countries. Not only when compared to "Western" countries, but also places such as Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, etc. Even Nepal doesn\'t see anywhere near as much, despite a similar culture. In fact, as mentioned in the thread, only Morocco and Egypt seem to be comparable to India in terms of hassles tourist face. \n\nAll of these issue are ones faced by locals in India too, so it begs the question of just WHY India seems to have these problems on a greater scale than most countries? Can\'t just be population as a factor, as China doesn\'t appear to have near as many problems like this (of course, they may not be telling the whole truth about China, but that\'s another discussion). Are there some combinations of cultural issues, government issues, social issues, etc which are peculiar to India which could contribute to these problems?'<br />Author: 'indthwy'  id: 'ft66zm'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ft66zm/why_does_india_seem_to_have_a_larger_scale_of/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Covid’19 Situation in India compared to other European Nations'<br />Body: ' \n\nThe reality is yet to come to India. We cannot compare the two countries which are in different stages currently.\n\nIndia is still at a very early level of stage2 and chances are high that India may face the same situation alike in Europe after a month or so.\n\nWhy so?\n\nFour days before, India put over 1.3 billion people in lockdown when the number of cases crossed 500.\xa0[\\[1\\]](https://www.quora.com/#KnXOb)\xa0All the developed countries went to lockdown after the number of cases crossed several thousand (i.e 20K +). But India went one step ahead and took a brave step even though it will affect the day to the life of the second populated country in the world.\n\nWhy such an early lockdown?\n\nAs per data available with National Health Profile–2019[\\[2\\]](https://www.quora.com/#ojUvN)\xa0, India has only 0.55 beds per 1000 person which is relatively low compared to China(4.3), Italy(3.2), U.S(2.8).\n\nWhen it comes to intensive bed care, the below image will clearly explain to you where India is and the country with the most beds are struggling to handle the number of patients.[\\[3\\]](https://www.quora.com/#snTTU)\n\nThere is no way that India can handle the situation in a better way after being affected by the virus heavily like other developed nations. Even, developed countries failed to do it. India realized this very early and took this decision of going for a complete lockdown for 21 days in order to implement the social distancing. But, India will fall under the category of Italy and the US where people try to be more chill and not taking things seriously.\n\nWill Lockdown reduce the number of cases and deaths?\n\nHighly Impossible.\n\nThis is what happened in Chennai(south of India) after Prime Minister announced the 21 days lockdown. It happened 24 hours before lockdown where the people are taking the buses to go back to their native places. YOu can clearly see that the exact opposite of social distancing is happening.\n\nAnother one here in Delhi,\n\nThis the fourth day of lockdown.[\\[4\\]](https://www.quora.com/#GzxXk)\n\nEven though the government arranged thermal screening, but still it’s very tough to manage such a big crowd of more than 20K people at the same place. If anyone of them had the infection then there are high chances that the number of cases will spread rapidly. These are migrant workers who are in the queue for 100kms to take their buses back to the village.\n\nNo one knows, how many people are affected because of this virus. India tests a very less number of people compared to other countries[\\[1\\]](https://www.quora.com/q/coronavirus/submissions#LIcNR)\xa0. This may become a huge issue in the near future and led the second or third wave of corona outbreak\n\nWho is the reason?\n\nThe Indian Government failed to address the migrant workers in Delhi well before and didn’t prepare any proper infrastructure or transportation facilities which made them o walk 100 km on foot. There is no point for them to stay in the country capital without any jobs and struggling for food.\n\nBut, still, I believe there are chances to reduce or control the cases if the government starts checking the people in a huge number like Germany or South Korea. The only way India can control the number of cases is by mobilizing health care and spreading it thicker. Currently, India doesn’t have such a strong healthcare system to handle one of the deadliest viruses in recent history with a huge\xa0[http://population.So](http://population.so/)\xa0I would say that even though Europe failed to address this pandemic situation seriously, for a country like India 21 days lockdown is not a final solution.\n\nWe have to wait and watch for the government’s next steps and where it leading to. Let’s hope that India will handle this pandemic situation more seriously than ever.\n\nFootnotes\n\n[\\[1\\]\xa0](https://www.quora.com/#cite-KnXOb)[Modi Orders 3-Week Total Lockdown for All 1.3 Billion Indians](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html)[\\[2\\]\xa0](https://www.quora.com/#cite-ojUvN)[Number of coronavirus cases 649 in India, death toll 13: Govt | India News – Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/number-of-coronavirus-cases-649-in-india-death-toll-13-govt/articleshow/74823913.cms)[\\[3\\]\xa0](https://www.quora.com/#cite-snTTU)[The Countries With The Most Critical Care Beds Per Capita \\[Infographic\\]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2020/03/12/the-countries-with-the-most-critical-care-beds-per-capita-infographic/#5daf2f3c7f86)[\\[4\\]\xa0](https://www.quora.com/#cite-GzxXk)[India’s Coronavirus Lockdown Leaves Vast Numbers Stranded and Hungry](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/world/asia/coronavirus-india-migrants.html)'<br />Author: 'AshishMesh'  id: 'ft2ji2'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ft2ji2/covid19_situation_in_india_compared_to_other/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 2.12'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : What are some of the arguments given by the Māyāvādī philosophers against the individuality of the soul ? How they are refuted ?**\n\n**Answer 1 : "**The Māyāvādī theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by the covering of māyā or illusion, will merge into the impersonal Brahman and lose its individual existence is not supported herein by Lord Kṛṣṇa, the supreme authority. Nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the conditioned state supported herein. Kṛṣṇa clearly says herein that in the future also the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is confirmed in the Upaniṣads, will continue eternally. This statement of Kṛṣṇa is authoritative because Kṛṣṇa cannot be subject to illusion. If individuality is not a fact, then Kṛṣṇa would not have stressed it so much—even for the future. The Māyāvādī may argue that the individuality spoken of by Kṛṣṇa is not spiritual, but material. Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material, then how can one distinguish Kṛṣṇa\'s individuality? Kṛṣṇa affirms His individuality in the past and confirms His individuality in the future also. He has confirmed His individuality in many ways, and impersonal Brahman has been declared to be subordinate to Him. Kṛṣṇa has maintained spiritual individuality all along; if He is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual consciousness, then His Bhagavad-gītā has no value as authoritative scripture."  \n"The Māyāvādī argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers to the body. But previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already condemned. After condemning the bodily conception of the living entities, how was it possible for Kṛṣṇa to place a conventional proposition on the body again? Therefore, individuality is maintained on spiritual grounds and is thus confirmed by great ācāryas like Śrī Rāmānuja and others. It is clearly mentioned in many places in the Gītā that this spiritual individuality is understood by those who are devotees of the Lord."  \n**Answer 2 : FITB : "**It is not that they did not exist as individuals in the past, and it is not that they will not remain eternal persons. Their individuality existed in the past, and their individuality will continue in the future without interruption."  \n\n\n**Answer 3 : FITB : "**Kṛṣṇa has maintained spiritual individuality all along; if He is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual consciousness, then His Bhagavad-gītā has no value as authoritative scripture."  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 2.12, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e3pdmx7e48q41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f184a6e48b6bcadc1fc8b36cb8c407aa176fc888\n\n  \nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

"The mask that keeps the virus out may soon be used to stop us from exercising our right to free speech."'<br />Body: '[Here\'s the link for the article](https://thewire.in/law/coronavirus-v-free-speech-modi-government-opens-new-battlefront-in-supreme-court)\n\n\nThe summary of the article is that Government of India has claimed that the unprecedented migration crisis amidst the Coronavirus pandemic was caused due to peddling of fake news regarding lockdown and it has sought the  Hon’ble Court to "issue a direction that no electronic/print media/web portal or social media shall print/publish or telecast anything without first ascertaining the true factual position from the separate mechanism provided by the Central Government".\n\n\nThe Court rejected this demand of the government but at the same time "direct the media to refer to and publish the official version about the developments” (of the pandemic).\n\n\nNow The Wire\'s journalists have claimed that "the court’s order might be interpreted by the Centre as giving sanction for prior censorship of content in the media." They have also stated in the article that "the Supreme Court’s order attributing the panic among migrant labourers heading to the villages from the cities to non-existent media reports suggesting prolonged lockdown for three months, amounts to absolving the Centre any responsibility."\n\n\nThis is were their standards of journalism comes to play:\n\n1. The central government did ask for \'censorship\'  but only to prohibit the publication of news related to the Coronavirus pandemic and the resultant lockdown without being verified by the government. There is a difference in this two things. Censorship implies that the publicist can\'t publish things without government\'s permission but in the latter the publicist can publish only after ascertaining the truth. Also the government\'s motive is clear that during this time of crisis, unverified news can cause much harm and thus it is better to be sure and certain before it\'s publication. \n\n2. The Wire\'s claim that there are non existent media reports regarding extension of lockdown is itself wrong. The Print had published the same, to which the Prasar Bharati had issued a fake news alert on Twitter. \n\n3. The Wire has published this article under the group \'Law\'. They have labelled charges of possibilities of censorship using provisions of Disaster Management Act and IPC but has conveniently ignored that the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Constitution of India is not an absolute right. In fact the notwithstanding clause in Article 19(3) allows the State from making any law to impose reasonable restrictions on this freedom to maintain public order, So any restriction on the media related to publication of news on the pandemic is not only legal but also desirable. \n\n\n4. Also the government has not issued any directions in this regard. They had asked the Apex Court to the same. Further the directions sought was related only to media outlets and not to common people. So there is no curbing of freedom of speech of common people using legal loopholes or unconstitutional methods.\n\n\n5. It\'s not central government\'s responsibility but that of state government and district administration to respond and provide help under disaster management act. So this problem of labour migration can\'t be attributed to central government, administratively speaking. The Wire has intentionally insuinated that the Apex Court has failed to reprimand the central government on this issue.\n\n\n\nTLDR: The Wire has twisted the entire story with intentional misquotes and omissions of important points to show the government in poor light as a big brother who is hell bent on curbing the freedom of speech by censorship. The headline along with the picture in the article shows how pathetic they are in advancing their miserable agendas.'<br />Author: '4bottlevodka'  id: 'fsyjly'<br />Score:37<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fsyjly/an_example_as_how_the_wire_advances_its_agenda/</li>

Toxic masculinity was never a concept- King Dashrath was a valiant warrior who single-handedly conquered the earth and killed many rakshasas. Despite this, he never had any reservations in openly expressing his love for his son Ram. He openly grieved for his son after Ram went to Vanvas and it is one of the most emotionally devastating episodes in the epic. As opposed to other cultures, where warriors were supposed to be emotionally distant and unaffected, being emotional was celebrated in Ramayan even before the marketing of concepts like 'Boys can cry.'\n\n2. Women had an opinion- Though Liberals let you believe that women in Ramayan were passive, but Sitaji had her own opinions. Even after Lord Ram would prefer she didn't go with him to forests, she still went with him. And though Western epics portrayed women as only beautiful persons, the focus on Ramayana for both men and women was the determination and strength of their character.\n\n3. No concept of caste and race- Though in old days, it is made popular by intellectuals that only Kshatriyas were eligible to fight in wars, but Lord Rama subverted this convention by making an army of Vaanars and Reech, which was entirely different race. The incidents with Kevat and Shabri also establish that Ram didn't believe in any division.\n\n4. Maintaining dignity even during war- When Lord Ram defeated Raavan, he could easily humiliate the person who abducted his wife but he told Vibhishan to perform Raavan's cremation according to ritual and showed respect to him by sending Lakshman to get his Gyan from him."<br />Author: 'dreamerimagine1'  id: 'fst8oj'<br />Score:103<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fst8oj/things_liberals_wont_tell_you_about_ramayan/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Tablighi Jamaat people KNEW about coronavirus spread among them when they did the Delhi event, because they spread to 600+ people in their Malaysia event, and they were forcefully banned from their Indonasia event! NO ONE IN NEWS IS TALKING ABOUT THIS.'<br />Body: 'Between 27 February and 1 March 2020, they organised an international mass religious gathering at the Sri Petaling Mosque in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, which has been linked to more than 600 COVID-19 cases, making it the largest-known centre of transmission of the virus in Southeast Asia.\n\nIt was all over reddit and international news. This was a big PR disaster for the Tablighi Jamaat people as they faced wrath of multiple south eastern countries who were affected by this. This single event spread the virus to dozens of countries. This is not a news anyone in that group can "miss" as it affected them so much. I am sure every single Tablighi Jamaat person who was in Delhi event knew about this.\n\nDespite the outbreak, Tablighi Jammat organised a second international mass gathering on 18 March in Gowa Regency near Makassar in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Though the organisers initially rebuffed official directives to cancel the gathering, they subsequently complied and cancelled the gathering.\n\nNizamuddin faction of the Tablighi Jamaat held a religious congregational program in Nizamuddin West, Delhi from 13 to 15 March 2020 before pan-India lockdown was announced which was attended by several foreign speakers and over 500 members. It is suspected that some of these speakers were infected by the Coronavirus which later spread to the congregants.\n\nIn Pakistan, 36 Tableeghi Jamaat members tested positive in Hyderabad, Pakistan on 30 March. 1000s more are suspected and common people in Pakistan are ostracizing people of Tableeghi Jamaat due to fear of coronavirus.\n\nThese are the known places. It is very possible that they have infected in Bangladesh and several other countries like Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.\n\nThe thing is that even **after knowing they were infected** and caused such a massive problem in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonasia, two weeks later, they did a similar event in Delhi. Another bad thing is that even after knowing about this outbreak in Malaysia originating from this group, India failed to stop them from doing an event in India.\n\nHere is the NEWS about this from MARCH 12th - https://www.nst.com.my/world/world/2020/03/574064/singapore-identify-95-who-attended-malaysias-tabligh-gathering\n\nhttps://www.thejakartapost.com/seasia/2020/03/13/no-tracing-yet-of-indonesians-attending-kuala-lumpur-event-after-positive-covid-19-cases.html'<br />Author: 'zqwz'  id: 'fshq1p'<br />Score:234<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fshq1p/tablighi_jamaat_people_knew_about_coronavirus/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 2.11'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : Why Lord Krishna chastised Arjuna ? What were some of the arguments against the war presented by Arjuna to the Lord ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "The Lord at once took the position of the teacher and chastised the student, calling him, indirectly, a fool. The Lord said, you are talking like a learned man, but you do not know that one who is learned—one who knows what is body and what is soul—does not lament for any stage of the body, neither in the living nor in the dead condition. As it will be explained in later chapters, it will be clear that knowledge means to know matter and spirit and the controller of both. Arjuna argued that religious principles should be given more importance than politics or sociology, but he did not know that knowledge of matter, soul and the Supreme is even more important than religious formularies. And, because he was lacking in that knowledge, he should not have posed himself as a very learned man. As he did not happen to be a very learned man, he was consequently lamenting for something which was unworthy of lamentation."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 2.11, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/60la6u74y0q41.png?width=581&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61026bad8fba0d118c23b861d5ca0e0bdb8d4fb8\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: 'Lachit Borpukhan – The Hero of Assam and Pride of India #2'<br />Body: " \n\n**The Siege of Itakuli**\n\nThe siege went for months but alas, the Ahom Army was unsuccessful in liberating the fort. Lachit Borpukhan Ji understood that a change in the strategy was needed and hence made a plan to conquer the fort. He sent a small group of soldiers under the leadership of Bagh Hazarika to enter the fort at night and put water in the canons of the Mughals this will lead to their canons being rendered useless in the battle. Bagh Hazarika completed the mission with the utmost care. Next morning Lachit Ji attacked the fort with all the might and this time **Itakuli fell and with that Ahoms had the control of Ghuwati.**\n\nWhen Aurangzeb came to know about the siege, he got very angry. **Enraged he sent Ram Singh with an army of 70,000 soldiers to attack Lachit Borpukhan**. Surprisingly the ninth Sikh Guru Sri Teg Bahadur Ji also accompanied Ram Singh but as a non-combatant as he refused to participate in the war. Ram Singh felt that Assamese used Black magic to win and Guru Teg Bahadur Ji will help Ram Singh counter it.\n\nOn the other hand, Lachit Ji knew that soon Aurangzeb will send his forces to conquer the fort again and Lachit Ji started to plan for the defence. During this time every guard was given strict guarding duty. One day, he found his uncle sleeping during guard duty and as a punishment for negligence and risking the lives of his countrymen he beheaded his own uncle. Seeing this the whole army had a new respect for Lachit Ji and a new resolve for their duties.Upon the arrival of Ram Singh in Assam, Lachit Ji started the attacks on the enemies but always avoided the direct fights with the much bigger Mughal Army; **Lachit Ji used Guerilla warfare to the utmost advantage and almost won the war.**\n\nHowever, as Ram Singh was losing the war, he made a malicious plan to win. He bribed the officers who were jealous of Lachit Ji. He was easily able to sway the traitors but most of the brave warriors refused to fight against their homeland. He even tried to sway the King against the brave Commander by sending an arrow to the Fort containing a letter, which said that Lachit Ji has been paid a some of One lakh to evacuate the fort, initially, the King grew wary but later King gained his senses and knew to not be fooled by such tactics. With all of his plans going disarray, he took his army and tried to force Ahoms into open warfare. Lachit Ji knew that Ahoms were outnumbered and refused open warfare. But the King Cakradhwaj Singha grew impatient and ordered a full-frontal attack.\n\n**The battle of Alaboi, the year 1669 AD**\n\nBeing outnumbered and fighting against traitors of their kin, the Ahom Army lost the battle badly. King Chakradhwaj's decision cost them and Lachit Ji and their army Ten thousand Soldiers in this war. Nevertheless, with the grace of God, he and the kingdom survived. But soon after the tragedy struck the Kingdom again as the King Chakradhwaj Singha Ji passed away. Udayaditya Singha Ji was named the new king.\n\n**The Saraighat Battle, March of the year 1671 AD**\n\nIn the year 1671, Ram Singh's informers told him about the breaches in the defence of the Ahom Army. After knowing about the breaches, Ram Singh decided that it was the time for a Final attack. He set up a large Mughal Army for a full Invasion through the River Brahmaputra. On the other hand, time and continuous warfare had taken its toll on the great warrior Lachit Ji. He became very ill and was bedridden, unable to fight and lead the army.\n\nBetween the Aswaklanta Temple and Itakuli fort, the river Brahmaputra was waiting for the final chapter in the story that started Eight years ago with the invasion of Mir Jumla. Both the Naval Forces were in front of each other. The large Ships of Mughals against the small Bacchari boats of Ahoms. This battle was not going to be fought in the land but in the waterfront of the Brahmaputra. When the battle started, Ahoms had some initial success and even captured the local Mughal Commander Mir Nawab but as the battle lingered on the Ahoms drew the full weight of Mughal army; personally led by Ram Singh the Mughals were ruthless as ever. The sheer numbers of Mughals were too much for the Ahom army whose Braveheart commander was not with them Commander. The Ahom army started to retreat.\n\n**Seeing Ahoms lose, Lachit Borpukhan Ji prepared for the battle** and when he was stopped by his physician the brave warrior told the doctor-\n\n*“When my countrymen are suffering from invasion, and when my army is fighting and sacrificing its life, how can I think about resting my body due to a mere illness? How can I think about going home to my wife and children when my entire country is in trouble?”*\n\nNot heading the advice of his physicians Lachit Borpukhan made his way to the battlefield. Seeing their army chief make his way to the battle it filled the Ahom army with courage. The battle raged on for hours. Ahom army using their intellect and inventions started turning the tide of the battle. Thousands of Mughals were killed, three of the Mughal chiefs were slain and the rest of the army fled the battlefield. With the might of the heroic and gallant Lachit Borpukhan Ji, the Ahom kingdom had won the battle.\n\nThe remaining Mughals returned to Aurangzeb and a beaten Ram Singh was unable to show his face to the warlord, he wrote\n\n*“Glory to the king! Glory to the counsellors! Glory to the commanders! Glory to the country! One single individual leads all the forces! Even I, Ram Singh, being personally on the spot, have not been able to find any loophole and an opportunity!”*\n\n***Aftermath*** **- Unfortunately, shortly after the war Lachit Borphukan took his last breath and passed away**. The Loin heart had given his life for the culture and for the respect of his Kingdom. Assam could not have asked for a better Hero. The last battle between Mughals and Ahoms were fought in 1682 AD and Ahoms were again able to defeat the Mughals once in for all. Mughals will never try to attack the Ahom kingdom again.\n\n**If today we see the pristine culture of Assam being intact, it is because it never faced the brutish invasion of the Islamic tyrants.**\n\n**Every year on 24 November Lachit Divas is celebrated to commemorate the heroism of Lachit Borphukan and the victory of the Assamese army at the Battle of Saraighat. Also since the year, 1999 the best passing out cadet of National Defense Academy is conferred with the Lachit Borphukan gold medal for his bravery.**\n\nPlease share this article and tell others about the valour of the Great Warrior which is surprisingly not known to many.\n\nI understand many people might be angry since I have not mentioned the legend of Bagh Hazarika and other trusted Generals of Lachit Ji in detail but I would like to give them separate articles in future posts. If any mistake is found, please feel free to correct. I will correct the error in the post surely.\n\n*Also, please remember to be respectful towards your fellow citizens regardless of their heritage, birthplace and culture.

      <li>Title::: 'Lock down is never about stopping spread of Covid-19'<br />Body: "The 21 days lock down was never about stopping the spread of virus or isolating people with corona virus. India is too populated and too big of a country with limited powers to government. We don't have mass testing capability now to effectively blanked test the population. We will never successfully contain the virus. \nThe idea of lock down is to give government time to prepare for the eventual spike in cases.\n\n1. A small town in TN which has only 1-2 cases is creating a 1000 bed ward out of government college. It might seem overkill with current number but eventually it will be all used up. Haryana and other states are also preparing large facilities with less number of cases.  \n1. Government ordering shit ton of medical equipment. If the virus is stopped in 21 days why does government need so many medical equipment? Its all for later use when the eventual spike comes. \n1. Maruti and other manufactures have started manufacturing ventilators. It will take 4-6 weeks for them to produce ventilators in respectable numbers and the government has given them time in form of lock down.\n1. We managed to from 100 to 1000 cases in 12 days where as other countries went to 1000 in 4 days and max to 8000 cases in 12 days. \n1.  Next 2 weeks are critical where USA went from 1000 cases to 55000 cases, Spain when to 35000 cases and Italy went to 21000 cases. This is where India will flatten the curve. \n1. Give time for medical companies to come up with faster and cheaper testing and treatment methods. Last week Abbott came up with 5 minutes test, and FDA approved malaria drugs for treatment. In another two weeks we might have even cheaper testing and treatment.  \n\nSo all the data points to that lock down is never about stopping corona virus but to slow it down enough, so that government has enough time to prepare. The lock down is also educate/scare people into following social distancing rules. Without lock down, many people would not have taken this virus seriously and it might have led to disasters in poorly prepared India. \n\nEven after 21 days, the government will still come up with some sort of minimal lock down like odd even scheme which will keep the spreading to minimum until we get effective treatment or vaccine."<br />Author: 'sco_black_scorpion'  id: 'fs6cdg'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fs6cdg/lock_down_is_never_about_stopping_spread_of/</li>

As friends, both of them were on the same level, but one of them voluntarily became a student of the other. Kṛṣṇa was smiling because a friend had chosen to become a disciple. As Lord of all, He is always in the superior position as the master of everyone, and yet the Lord accepts one who wishes to be a friend, a son, a lover or a devotee, or who wants Him in such a role. But when He was accepted as the master, He at once assumed the role and talked with the disciple like the master—with gravity, as it is required.

Ignoring WhatsApp group messages which suggest that China did this to break the world economy and grow themselves. This doesn’t make sense to me. \nConsider this, the first outbreak was in China which means China also had to face loses. They were in lockdown too. Their economy was also hurt. They say there were 80000 cases in China. That’s the official number, knowing China we know that it is fake. It is probably much more.\nWhich mean they were hurt as well. A country which themselves having issue with their population demographic, deaths does no good to them as well.\nAnd now to the real reason why I think China might not have planned this:\nAssume world economy is broke and since imf has officially declared recession, meaning several issue comes with it. I mean it is a recession. Now people lose their purchasing power. There is little money to pour, which means there is little demand for almost everything. Since China is manufacturing hub of the world and there is no demand in the world, effects the manufacturing (supply is directly proportional to demand). Their economy gets hurt real bad. Companies lower down production meaning less work for Chinese people. And that’s my confusion. Why would China do this?\n\nP.S: I know they have communist govt. and they are crazy enough to do unthinkable. But still what do they get out of it. As much as I can think they just wanted to hide the information to save their reputation.

Now, they are giving a corona discount and it is around Rs4k. But, they also offer Family pack which gives 5 different user accounts. If we divide the cost by 5, each person only pays approx Rs1.3k and get this service for next 3 years. Each user will get separate account, and each user can add 5 devices. There is no overlapping problems.\n\nAll of us save lot of money and get 3 years service for cheap.\n\nI would suggest you to first try the free service, and if we can get 4 people who like it, then we can divide the cost and get 3 years plan for the cost of one months plan.

It's only 5-10% that require hospitalisation. \n\nArgument 1: We need to do rampant testing like South Korea &amp; Germany. \n\nThe population of South Korea is 51 million and the population of Germany is 87 million. Even if India does 500k tests per week (like Germany) it will take is 2600 weeks to test everyone i.e 50 years.

So what is the point of rampant testing if almost 95% of the cases require no medical care? \n\nArgument 2: How do we know whom to treat if we don't test them \n\nThe first line of treatment after a positive test result is a 14 day quarantine. If the symptoms get worse, then they're moved to a hospital.\n\nBy imposing a lockdown we are essentially quarantining everyone basically assuming a huge chunk of the population is positive and we are giving the first line of treatment.  \n\nIn this 21 day period, those who develop serious symptoms will be treated.

Arjuna argued that religious principles should be given more importance than politics or sociology, but he did not know that knowledge of matter, soul and the Supreme is even more important than religious formularies. And, because he was lacking in that knowledge, he should not have posed himself as a very learned man. As he did not happen to be a very learned man, he was consequently lamenting for something which was unworthy of lamentation. The body is born and is destined to be vanquished today or tomorrow; therefore the body is not as important as the soul. One who knows this is actually learned, and for him there is no cause for lamentation, regardless of the condition of the material body.  \n**Question 1 : Why Lord Krishna chastised Arjuna ?

      <li>Title::: 'The bureaucracy and administration in India needs serious reform. IAS, IPS etc are obsolete and it is sad to see so many smart individuals wasting 3-6 years of their life for it.'<br />Body: 'I recalled a friend who was placed in a good company and worked for 2 years. Then, he decided to "serve the society" and try the IAS. He gave 3 attempts and didn\'t get in, eventually had to take up a corporate job again.\n\nIt is great to see young Indians competing for a prestigious position like the IAS or IPS or IRS.   \nBut what is so prestigious about these posts, apart from the raw power they carry, without accountability? And why after 7 decades does this myth of "serving the nation through the IAS" still persist?\n\nI was going through a few mock interviews by these coaching centers and was shocked to see the kind of responses given by the aspirants (panelists are ex-bureaucrats to simulate the interview condition). Everyone says that they want to do something for their town or village, *but the IAS/IPS doesn\'t even guarantee you\'ll be in the same state ever*! Also, I glanced through the notes of *one topper, and he mentioned "raw power" as a motivation!* \n\nA lot of IAS officers may be honest, but what about delivery? **Have you seen the office of a collector in any district? It is the most haphazardly maintained building and people coming for work usually stand out in the open.**   \n**But if you see the bungalow of the collector, even the luxury hotels will cease to amaze you. Full army of servants and drivers.** \n\nThe civil services are responsible for many of India\'s ills. We blame the government, but politicians change. It is the babus who run the show. And their isolation from the real India in their lal batti gadis and guards and servants is what makes things bad for the rest of us.\n\nBTW, you may say lal battis were banned, but most officials have simply replaced the red with a blue light. \n\n**TLDR**\n\nI think this generalist bureaucracy has stunted India\'s growth. Many civil servants are exceptionally talented, but the lack of specialization does not allow them to contribute the most. It is sad that talented youth still waste years to clear this exam, only to become a part of the problem India faces.'<br />Author: 'The_Real_Deshbhakt'  id: 'frjb6h'<br />Score:70<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/frjb6h/the_bureaucracy_and_administration_in_india_needs/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Learn Something New - Google Ads - Part 2'<br />Body: "Hello again everyone! I hope everyone is healthy, safe and keeping indoors. In these trying times it is important that we as a community support each other and try not to panic or believe in rumours.\n\nLet's continue with this series about learning Google Ads. We started with understanding what Google Ads is and created an account in it. You can go through Part 1 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/foso2z/learn_something_new_google_ads_part_1/). Today we dive into keyword research.\n\n**Your Product/Service**\nBefore we get started with keyword research, it is important to understand a bit about your business. Here are a few important things I note down:\n* The core product or service that you are trying to sell here\n* What are its unique selling points (what differentiates your product/service from the competitors)\n* How does the product/service benefit users\nHere is a simple [table](https://imgur.com/W6PFK87) I find useful to do this.\nFill out as many USP’s as you can and go into details of how they add value to the user. Be as descriptive as possible. This little exercise will help you identify better keywords for your business and will later on help you write impactful ad copy.\n\n**What is a “keyword”?**\nKeywords are the terms that people type into Googles’ search bar to find what they are looking for. You choose the keywords you think are relevant to your service and bid on them. But you have to be careful while selecting the right ones for you. As you know, Google will suck your money up. So make sure you are choosing the one that is most appropriate for your business and what you are trying to achieve out of this campaign.\n\n**Keyword Intent**\nTo help choose the right keyword, understanding keyword intent is important. Consider keywords as an expression of the searchers intent. A person searching for “web development services” is looking for companies/individuals offering such services. But when he searches for “web development” he may be searching for jobs in web development, just trying to understand what it is or trying to find forums related to it. Read more [here](https://moz.com/blog/the-basics-of-building-an-intent-based-keyword-list) and [here](https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-intent). For Google Ads, “commercial intent” and transactional intent” keywords are more profitable.\n\n**Keyword Research**\nKeyword research will allow you to identify these phrases. There are many tools that are available out there that will help you through this. But, by signing up for Google Ads, you have been granted access to a powerful research tool - the Keyword Planner.\n\n**Keyword Planner**\nIt is a simple tool that Google provides to all Google Ads users for free. It is easy to use and will give you loads of data. Here's where to find it and how to use it:\n* Log into to your newly created Google Ads account\n* Look for a wrench icon which is titled “Tools &amp; Settings” [reference](https://imgur.com/VBEU7Uw)\n* A menu should open up. Look for keyword planner in the left most column [reference](https://imgur.com/hatCBRJ)\n* This should open up the keyword planner for you. Click on “Discover New Keywords” [reference](https://imgur.com/bvfzC0N)\n* Here, you will see some cool options to filter your search. First option is to include brand terms from your searches (I filter out, but up to you to decide) [reference](https://imgur.com/XG9LIU3)\n* This tool does give you the option to change the language, but here the language means the language set by the user for his web browser. I find that you hardly get any data with other languages (at least for the products I have searched for)\n* Next, you can narrow down the area you want to retrieve the data for, by clicking on the location you are seeing here (I am seeing India, you might see something else) [reference](https://imgur.com/dKoF7ik)\n* Enter the location you have in mind for your research purposes in the area they provide and select it. This should give you data for the selected regions only. Before saving, make sure additional areas are not selected as well. You should see only the location/s you want in the “Targeted locations” box [reference](https://imgur.com/mO4zBWr)\n* Alright, now you should be ready to find out what keywords people are searching for. You can filter this further by putting in your website in the field provided, but I have often found it to be restrictive.\n* Type in the core service that we decided in the exercise earlier, in the field provided and hit “Get results”. Try not to be too specific at first. This will give you more results and you can always ignore the unwanted ones later [reference](https://imgur.com/N2oiegp)\n* Google will suddenly throw at you a huge amount of data. But don’t be overwhelmed, we don’t need to pay too much attention to it for now. Look for “Download Ideas” to download the information you see here [reference](https://imgur.com/XHD4K52)\n* Note, some you will see a range under the “Avg. Monthly Searches” column like in the screenshot above. We can get more accurate data when we start running a campaign. Here is what I see when I do this research in an active account. [reference](https://imgur.com/072gptv)\n* Now, let’s reduce the clutter in the sheet that was just downloaded. Get rid of the first two rows, currency column, “competition index” column and everything after “Top of Page bid (high range)”. You don't need any of this for now. [reference](https://imgur.com/dBblMM3). Your sheet should look something like [this](https://imgur.com/gfly4KV). I have applied a filter to my data. You can do this by simply selecting all the data and clicking CTR+SHIFT+L (Command Key+SHIFT+T on Mac). This makes it simpler for me to quickly go through the list here.\n* Let’s quickly understand what all these numbers are. “Min Search Volume”, “Max Search Volume” are what Google estimates to be the searches taking place for that phrase in a month. When you have an campaign up and running, you should see “Avg. Monthly Searches” instead of these two columns. Larger the number, the more people are searching for the phrase. “Competition” denotes how many people are bidding on it. High competition means more people bid on it, Low means less. “Top of Page Bid (Low range)” and “Top of Page Bid (High range)” is the range between which Google suggests you should bid on to reach the top.\n* Filter out (delete) all the keywords with “0” minimum search volume. If no one is searching for it, no point targeting it. Plus most of them usually are too specific or irrelevant to your product/service. Sometimes I get rid of all “Low” competition keywords as well.\n* Now, whatever keywords you are left with, you should go through each one to identify the most relevant to your service or products. Here, I am trying to create a campaign for a company which sells “web design and development” service in Pune region only. So I will get rid of keywords like “freelance web designer” and “web design company cochin”[reference](https://imgur.com/7l8wcEy)\n* Now let’s quickly understand why I am getting rid of these. Remember the user's intent we discussed earlier. With “freelance web designer” the user is looking for a freelancer and not a company and he might not click on your ad when he sees it. Even if he clicks on it and lands on your website, he may realise that this is not what he is looking for and you will have just wasted money on an irrelevant click. Similarly with “Cochin”, the searcher is looking for someone in Cochin and not Pune. You would have wasted the click and money again. So, you want to be as specific to the service/product you are offering as possible and try to understand the searchers intent behind the term\n* If you have more product/services, repeat these steps for each. Try repeating these steps for more specific, relevant keywords. Sometimes you might find keywords that you couldn't find earlier.\nSo now, you should have a good list of keywords which will be the basis of your campaign. But is this the only way you can find keywords? Nope. There are many other tools out there for keyword research. Ubersuggest, SEMRush, Keyword.io, Wordstream and countless more. They function more or less the same way, but none provide data as precise as Keyword Planner (just my opinion). But don’t forget to look for keywords on Google itself (google.com). Look at what results you get when Google tries to autocomplete the term you are typing in the search box. This is based on generally what people are searching for [reference.](https://imgur.com/NaO5iUg) You might end up finding some good terms for yourself. Another place on Google is to see what suggestions you get at the bottom of the page when searching for a term [reference.](https://imgur.com/Zp3za7U)\n\nSo now, you should have a fairly decent number of search phrases which will give you an idea of what people are searching in your target area for your product or service. So does that mean keyword research is over? Nope. Far from it. You should still find out what the competitors are doing. You might come across something you might have missed in your research here.\n\nWe will take a look at how to do competitor research in the next post. Stay safe. Stay indoors."<br />Author: 'bhelpuri13'  id: 'frhr9l'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/frhr9l/learn_something_new_google_ads_part_2/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] COVID-19 Special Edition'<br />Body: "Welcome to this edition of the Biweekly Geopolitics Thread, the place where we discuss events from around the world, even if they are not related to India. Right now, the world is pretty much engulfed in the COVID-19 pandemic, and almost all the news is from there. India is just as affected by this as the rest of the world. So here's a special thread on the effects of COVID-19 around the world.\n\n# Top COVID-19 stories from the world:\n\n1. [Tokyo Olympics postponed to Summer 2021](https://abcnews.go.com/International/uncertainty-shrouds-tokyo-2020-olympics-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/story?id=69742833)\n\nAfter strong pressure from national sports associations, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Japanese PM Abe Shinzo agreed to postpone the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics to 2021. Japan has initially resisted calls to postpone the event, worried about the unprecedented logistics and economic cost of the move, but amid calls to boycott the games, they consented. This is the first time outside of the world wars that the Olympics will not be held as scheduled. US President Donald Trump commended the move, and promised to join the Japanese PM in 2021 (assuming he wins his election, of course). \n\n2. [COVID-19 clears America's Shaheenbagh](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/hawaii-telescope-protesters-leave-camp-due-virus-concerns-69836479)\n\n For the last eight months, protesters have blocked the Mauna Kea Access Road in the US state of Hawaii. They have been protesting against construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) project, one of the world's largest astronomical telescope projects. The protesters are a mix of people who oppose the project on environmental grounds and those that object to its desecration of Native Hawaiian tribal lands. The police tried to clear the protesters in July last year but gave up after that. Now, the protesters have moved out, clearing tents, kitchens, and protest areas, for fear of COVID-19.\n\n3. [Brazilian President demands end to lockdown in states](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/25/821327282/in-brazil-bolsonaro-doubles-down-on-exaggerated-coronavirus?ft=nprml&amp;f=)\n\nThe President of Brazil  Jair Bolsonaro has been a maverick of sorts globally, insisting that fears of COVID-19 were hyped up. However, despite his opposition to doing virtually anything about the virus, governors of Brazil's federal states have been enacting lockdowns and quarantines. The country has nearly 3,000 cases and over 50 deaths, and the large cities of Rio and Sao Paulo are under a lockdown. Bolsonaro has called the lockdowns as criminal and fears their effects on the economy. People in those cities have taken to banging pots and pans to show their opposition to him.\n\n4. [Violence erupts across Africa over COVID-19](https://time.com/5811945/coronavirus-prevention-africa/)\n\nFrom South Africa to Kenya, countries across Africa are moving into lockdowns lasting several weeks, but enforcing them has seen police clash with civilians in many countries. In Kenya, police have been given more or less a free reign to enforce a curfew, as courts have minimized operations to only the most serious cases, effectively allowing police to detain people indefinitely without trial. In South Africa, police have been running behind homeless workers in order to get them into shelters. \n\n5. [China sends medical aid to Pak](https://time.com/5812015/china-medical-aid-pakistan/)\n\nAt over 1,500, Pakistan has the highest number of cases of COVID-19 in the subcontinent. However, given its dire economic circumstances, weak public institutions, and the vice-like grip of Islamic clerics who dismiss the virus, the country has very little means to combat the spread. To help its ally, a plane full of medical supplies and doctors from China reached Islamabad, where they were greeted by the country's foreign minister. They will now be spread around the country, where hospitals and exhibition halls have been converted into temporary hospitals. Pakistan has also closed its borders with India, Iran, and Afghanistan. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: Dr. Li Wenliang  \n\nGiven China's unmatched ability censor news and information, chances are that the name of Dr.  Li Wenliang will quickly be forgotten by history unless people around the world come together to preserve it. In November last year, a large number of people had contracted a respiratory disease in Wuhan, China, quickly overwhelming the health system in the city. Consequently, local authorities roped in anybody with any clinical training, including 34-year old ophthalmologist Dr. Li. However, Dr. Li realized that something was different about this outbreak: the symptoms were different from a flu, and reminded him of SARS. \n\nOn Dec. 30, he posted a message to fellow doctors in a chat group, warning them to protect themselves from this new disease. Of course, since nothing escapes Communist Party censors in China, his message was taken down and four days later, he was accused of spreading false rumours to disturb social peace and order. His comments were quickly dismissed, he and eight others were placed under investigation, and health authorities went back to insisting that it was just an outbreak of the flu. \n\nOn Jan. 10, he posted on social media that he had developed a cough, and on Jan. 30 he had been diagnosed with the new virus, SARS-CoV-2. He died a week later, and local authorities were unable to cover up either his story or the new outbreak that was spreading beyond China's borders. Censors quickly put down a series of online protests, but the national leadership quickly shifted blame to Wuhan authorities. But the truth is, the local leadership was only doing what was natural in a top-down government structure, where health workers are rewarded for fewer cases reported than more cases treated. \n\nDr. Li will perhaps be remembered as the last soldier at the gates before the world was overrun with the virus from Wuhan. Or perhaps he will be forgotten, as the world is told about how Xi Jinping heroically saved humanity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat stories from around the world caught your attention?"<br />Author: 'icecoolsushobhan'  id: 'frcj6f'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/frcj6f/biweekly_geopolitics_thread_covid19_special/</li>

Population of India is clustered into cities, towns, and villages. With the way COVID19 spreads, a single person can spread COVID19 to small clusters namely villages and small towns.\n\nWith the mass worker migration happening right now, and the horrid conditions where these workers are as cramped as humanly possible to board their mode of transportation, it is extremely likely that these people will infect the small clusters at their hometown.\n\nA word on stats given by Indian Government: it is mathematically impossible for states like UP, Punjab, Harayana, UP, Bihar, W. Bengal to have so few cases (unless North Indians have an immunity). These stats are so unreliable that I have not used them in this post. I believe gathering data is critical at this stage. It will help the government decide where the makeshift hospitals are needed, where masks are needed, where to supply the medication if and when a cure is developed, and which areas need a total lockdown (yes, these are required).\n\n[Source of population density \\[2011\\]: Census of India 2011](https://web.archive.org/web/20180127163347/http://planningcommission.gov.in/data/datatable/data_2312/DatabookDec2014%20307.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Population density of Indian States [2018]\n\n[Population density of India in 2018](https://preview.redd.it/4n32i7vd7np41.png?width=1248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=198d8f8f12b2c8afa841c5f2d1b35bafa998e915)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33178crg7np41.png?width=350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7648b99ed458603768be88a427171768dee9bcf4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nData from 2011 is outdated, but it still paints a similar picture. If you compare 2011 vs 2018 side by side, many states are one shade darker, but the overall picture remains the same. If anything, it is all the more reason to commit to social distancing.\n\n[Source of population density \\[2018\\]: UIDAI](https://uidai.gov.in/images/state-wise-aadhaar-saturation.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Math behind highly infectious diseases\n\nPandemics can be modelled after the following curve. Initially, the growth is very slow, yet steady. Once a threshold is hit, the number of cases rise exponentially. This rise continues till *inflection point.* After inflection point, the number of new cases start to slow down, eventually saturating the total number of cases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Inflection Point](https://preview.redd.it/bhayehbo7np41.png?width=412&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec56b99eec8807d9de3051944cae169a95345018)\n\nFactors such as population density, total population, extent of day-to-day body contact (hugs, handshakes) in different cultures, personal hygiene, density of public transit systems, percentage of people already affected, virality of virus, and lethality of virus affect the position of this inflection point.\n\n[Source](https://academic.oup.com/bmb/article/92/1/33/333536) (this is just one paper, google SIR model for more info)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Lowering inflection point\n\nThese are the actions you can take to ensure the infection point is reached sooner while affecting only a small portion of the population:\n\n* Wash your hands regularly\n* Do not touch your face\n* Wear mask if your work exposes you to a lot of people (doctors, police).\n* Wear mask if you have any COVID19 symptoms. This is a tricky one because COVID19 can remain dormant for a week before showing symptoms, so do exercise caution.\n* Speaking of dormant COVID19, with no way to know your status during the early stages of infection, **social distancing** is possibly the most important thing you can practice as an individual right now.\n* Do not reuse masks. Most people in my circle seem to disregard this point. The layer of mask exposed to the environment is prone to get contaminated by COVID19. After a day of use, if you touch the exposed layer, or worse put the mask in opposite direction, you are exposing yourself to COVID19.\n\n[Source: WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) (Highly recommend giving this a read as well)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Growth rate of highly contagious diseases (theoretical)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Theoretical growth of COVID19](https://preview.redd.it/dh90tnqm8np41.png?width=1550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=744b1da534f207288b24c89bf458f17b6a8990ea)\n\nBefore the inflection point, the cases of pandemics can be modelled using an exponential graph.\n\nThe percentages shown is the graph is the product of **probability of transmission of COVID19)** and **number of people an infected person comes in contact with.** Say this number is **x**\n\nWith the nature of the graph\n\n* if **x is 45%**, by the end of 53 days **240 million cases are observed**.\n* if **x is 40%**, by the end of 53 days **40 million cases are observed**.\n\nWith just a reduction of 5%, the COVID cases are **reduced by 200 million**.\n\n&gt;So, the number of people you meet, and how well protected you are if and when you meet someone during this critical time is the difference between 240 million cases versus 40 million cases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Growth rate of COVID19 cases (practical)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Actual\\/practical growth of COVID19](https://preview.redd.it/2ir7mnhs8np41.png?width=1554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19a8956d42d57bf7432cae2ba9dcc01c6412acbb)\n\nFortunately, the **x** for COVID19 is somewhere between 15-20%. Keep in mind that these countries are under strict quarantine. Although India is also under quarantine, the factors like people celebrating after one day lockdown, people praying in public spaces, people just roaming about on the streets, and migrating workers introduce a huge uncertainty in the system.\n\n[Source of COVID19 cases: John Hopkins University](https://github.com/datasets/covid-19) (Hosted on GitHub, updated daily, excellent resource)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Speculated COVID19 cases in India\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Speculated COVID19 Cases in India](https://preview.redd.it/dh97xyu19np41.png?width=1549&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb1cd1c85a6ad8ddeab56950f844f59d38e8fb1d)\n\nThe first eight columns graph show the confirmed COVID19 cases as on March 28, 2020 ([sourced by John Hopkins](https://github.com/datasets/covid-19)). The last two columns show my **speculated figure** as on March 28, 2020. Emphasis on speculated, please don't share this graph without context.\n\n**India (O)** is the optimistic figure modelled after the UK's COVID growth graph. I would have loved to select South Korea's graph as the optimistic model (not shown in this post), but the citizens and administration over there have done an exceptional job, and even the developed countries like UK and US do not compare with Korea's measures.\n\n**India (P)** is the pessimistic figure modelled after the US's COVID growth graph. This is again assuming we have practiced social distancing comparable to the people in US.\n\n*Math behind models: ( infectivity \\*\\* daysSincePatientZero ) \\* totalPopulation = infectedPopulation*\n\n# Takeaway\n\nI cannot overstate the importance of social distancing.

      <li>Title::: 'Cooking. Few recipes, easy cooking methods. Loved the way it is explained.'<br />Body: 'by u/alliknowisout\n\nAlthough ignorance is bliss, sometimes this may not be the case. Amidst the ongoing battle against deadly COVID-19 a lot of young people are out of cooks, reasons may vary. Many restaurants and food delivery companies may limit or close down their services. You may not be able go out to your daily food mess due to the ongoing circumstances. But everyone has to eat. How many days the battle will go on is a wise question but wiser men have still not figured it out.\n\nSo I will tell you few simple recipes that anyone can cook with minimal utensils, masala (spices), ingredients. Portion size is for individuals. Every dish can be prepared in a steam cooker or in a kadhai. In our homes we generally do not have weighing scales so we will use normal tea cups and spoons for measurements.\n\nChawal(Rice) steamed\n\n1 cup/half steel glass of chawal.\n\nWash it. Change water 3 times at minimum during washing. No need to soak.\n\nWater will be double the amount of rice. So add 2 cup/full glass of water.\n\nClose the cooker lid, put on the whistle (vent weight).\n\nOn medium flame. 2 whistles later, rice is ready.\n\nWait for 10 minutes before opening the lid. Enjoy.\n\nDal(Lentil)\n\nHalf cup of dal.\n\nWash it. Change water 3 times at minimum during washing.\n\nWater will be 4 times the amount of dal.

After 4 whistles both dal and aloo will be cooked.\n\nIf not boiling them with dal then add 1 and a half glass of water in cooker. 4 whistles later shut the gas off and wait 15 minutes before opening the lid.\n\nDon’t wash it under cold water. Peel them. Mash them with the help of a ladle or if it is not too hot you can also use your hand.\n\nTwo ways to cook them.\n\n1 small size onion, finely chopped. 1 finely chopped green chili. A quarter tea spoon of salt. 1 tea spoon mustard oil. Mix them well while mashing the potato. Enjoy.\n\nHeat the kadhai, Put 1 table spoon mustard oil/ghee.

      <li>Title::: 'Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 2.10'<br />Body: '\\*Please write answer to the questions in comments\\*  \nChapter 2: Contents of the Gita Summarized  \n\n\n**तमुवाच हृषीकेशः प्रहसन्निव भारत**  \n**सेन्योरुभ्योर्मध्ये विषीदन्तमिदं वचः || १० ||**  \n\n\ntam uvāca hṛṣīkeśaḥ  \nprahasann iva bhārata  \nsenayor ubhayor madhye  \nviṣīdantam idaṁ vacaḥ  \n\n\n**SYNONYMS**  \n\n\ntam—unto him; uvāca—said; hṛṣīkeśaḥ—the master of the senses, Kṛṣṇa; prahasan—smiling; iva—like that; bhārata—O Dhṛtarāṣṭra, descendant of Bharata; senayoḥ—of the armies; ubhayoḥ—of both parties; madhye—between; viṣīdantam—unto the lamenting one; idam—the following; vacaḥ—words.  \n\n\n**TRANSLATION**  \n\n\n**O descendant of Bharata, at that time Kṛṣṇa, smiling, in the midst of both the armies, spoke the following words to the grief-stricken Arjuna.**  \n\n\n**PURPORT**  \n\n\nThe talk was going on between intimate friends, namely the Hṛṣīkeśa and the Guḍākeśa. As friends, both of them were on the same level, but one of them voluntarily became a student of the other. Kṛṣṇa was smiling because a friend had chosen to become a disciple. As Lord of all, He is always in the superior position as the master of everyone, and yet the Lord accepts one who wishes to be a friend, a son, a lover or a devotee, or who wants Him in such a role. But when He was accepted as the master, He at once assumed the role and talked with the disciple like the master—with gravity, as it is required. It appears that the talk between the master and the disciple was openly exchanged in the presence of both armies so that all were benefitted. So the talks of Bhagavad-gītā are not for any particular person, society, or community, but they are for all, and friends or enemies are equally entitled to hear them.  \n\n\n**Question 1 : What is the significance of the word "prahasan" with reference to this verse ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](auhbcso18lp41)\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'fr3s4n'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fr3s4n/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_210/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Just a rant...'<br />Body: "I have watched three episodes of Ramayana on DD National and I'm loving it. A few days ago, long before Ramayana was announced to be retelecasted, it just came out of my mouth that Lord Rama is the most ideal person ever. At once, a woman said that how can you say so? Lord Ram was not a good person. He left Sitaji when she needed the support most. This was not the first time I was hearing this. My friend also said that Lord Ram was not a good person and how Ramayana was misogynist. Now, I am all for debate and discussion and even I feel that in Mahabharata, Kauravas and Karna were not wrong in everything nor were Pandavas always right and I even disagree with the moral base of some of Lord Krishna's actions in Mahabharata, but I absolutely hate it when people pass a judgement on how Ram was bad parroting liberal, western arguments. Most people conveniently ignore the fact that when Kaal went to privately discuss with Lord Rama and Lord Rama told Lakshmana not to let anyone enter until the discussion is over or else the person interrupting the meeting will receive death sentence. Then sage Durvasa came and demanded an audience with Lord Rama. Lakshman politely refused then sage Durvasa, famous for his anger, threatened to curse all of Ayodhya. Lakshman, to save Ayodhya, entered the room where Lord Rama and Kaal were having discussion. Lord Rama, under the obligation of what he said earlier, was going to punish Lakshman with death sentence, then the minister of Ayodhya suggested that an exile for a Kshatriya is same as his death so Ram gave the punishment of exile to Lakshman. Lakshman could not exist without his brother so he ended his life by taking Jal Samadhi in Saryu.\n\nThe whole incident doesn't mean Lord Ram was not a good brother or didn't love Lakshman. He was Maryada Purushottam and was bound by Maryada. Everyone, including himself, his father, Sitaji, Lakshman Ji had to endure hardship due to his obligation to perform his duties. You cannot view Ramayana with your lens of modernity. There were different rules and principles those days. I hate when just to appear feminist and woke, people say Lord Ram was not a good person.\n\nNow I'm not very much into religious rituals, but Lord Ram is not only a figure in our religion, he is the basis of Bharat. Though Lord Ram and Lord Krishna are same, but no one captures the soul of India better than Ramayana. \n\nThose who say, Lord Rama didn't respect women, seem to forget Devi Ahalya, Shabri Mata. Even he was polite to Shoorpnakha. Lord Rama broke the barriers of caste as was visible in the incidents with Shabri and Kevat. Lord Rama was the most ideal person ever."<br />Author: 'dreamerimagine1'  id: 'fr0pa8'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fr0pa8/just_a_rant/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Proud of being an Indian'<br />Body: "**I'm Indian and today, I'm extremely proud of being Indian.** India stands today as an example of a country that is able to effectively move to contain a real existential threat by inspiring the people, rather than through coercion.\n\n**I'm proud of our Prime Minister and our Central government.**\n\nWe indians are known for our Chalta Hai attitude. I've never seen a rule that has been made that hasn't been broken, sometimes within 5 minutes of the rule being made. In spite of that, the Government had the unenviable task of making sure 1.3 billion people followed what they had to say. Failure to do so meant the loss of millions of lives.\n\nAs a context, initially, many states were announcing curfews and shutdowns but the response was very poor. People were merrily breaking the rules and did not really worry too much.\n\nIt took the #Janathacurfew to bring India to its senses. It was a work of art. A beautiful way to make people choose to stay home, rather than beating it into them.\n\nmost people realised that this was the precursor to a bigger shutdown. And they stocked up before.\n\nAfter the Janathacurfew, the government then shut down the whole country. I'm sure there will be \\*experts\\* who will tell you it could be done earlier or later. There will be bright sparks who will tell us that the logistics have to be arranged first and then the lockdown announced.\n\nDon't you all get it? the government had to act \\*now\\* irrespective of whether the logistics are in place, irrespective of whether people are ready or not. They could not wait. It's funny that it's the same people who are cribbing about the lockdown who are also cribbing about the fact that the lockdown was delayed.\n\nThere will be \\*experts\\* who tell you that we need to test more. These are \\*experts\\* who in the past have gone by the simple principle of seeing what other countries are doing and then transposing the solution into India. See where that got us before?\n\nIf you take a look at the data, we have around a 1000 infected and about 20 dead. Assuming that the number of dead is a figure that we cannot fudge, we are at approximately .2% fatality, which is around the same the rest of the world. we might be misreporting some data, but not by much.\n\nTesting is not easy. it's not certain that the same tests that worked in South Korea will work for us. What if they don't work 100% of the time? then some people can show false negatives. what that means is that people, thinking they are not infected will go around infecting others.\n\nMedical testing in any country requires the experts from that country to tailor a testing mechanism to the needs of that country. It takes time. Usually it take months. Here, the government is trying to condense it as much as possible. if all of us do what we are asked to do and stay at home during this lockdown, it will give the authorities time to set up a proper testing regime. The virus won't go away after the 21 day lockdown but it will buy us a bit of time to prepare.\n\nI'm feeling proud that after announcing the lockdown, all the ministers are working round the clock to get their acts together. First the financial package to help the poor. Then the RBI intervention to cushion the middle class. slowly getting the essential commodities list right... mistakes were made but they were also corrected with a rapidity that shows great commitment.\n\n**I'm proud of the State Governments and the leaders of the Opposition at the Center**\n\nThe state governments have been very good at doing what is needed of them. For once, they buried their politics and animosity. The kejriwals, the pinarayi vijayans, the mamathas, the thakerays and the amrinder singhs.. All of them stood behind the center and did what they have to do. They took the messaging to the people and took care of the little details.\n\nAs always, mistakes were made. but the intent was there for all to see. We united as a country and we came together to fight this virus. it was great seeing democracy as it should be. State governments providing feedback to the center and the center acting on them. Center and state acting in cooperation irrespective of the party in power.\n\nRahul and Sonia threw their weights behind the government as well. Not forgetting they are in the opposition, once in a while, they point out mistakes and these get acted upon by the government.\n\n**I'm proud of our Industrialists.**\n\nStarting with Anand Mahindra, who threw open the doors of his resorts to the government and got his techs working on ventilator designs, to Ambani who fitted out a hospital in Mumbai, to Tata sons who put in 500 cr of emergency funds into the battle, to the CEO of Ola who gave up his entire year's salary and decided to create a fund to help their drivers, we are seeing the industry rallying around. Of course most of them will have their toplines hit by the virus. But in spite of that, they're doing what it takes to fight this hidden adversary.\n\n**I'm proud of some of the Media**\n\nEven the media, which normally tows an anti government line, did its bit. hammering the message across to the people to stay at home. It was strange to see Rajdeep Sardesai praise the government's actions.\n\n**I'm proud of the frontline warriors**\n\nThe police, the doctors, the nurses, ward boys, delivery guys, the sweepers, .. all of them wake up every day and put their lives on the line by doing their duties. These are the people who get the worst of these situations. They have to work in crazy conditions and usually face the ire of the public as well.\n\nIt did make my blood boil to see the public beaten with lathis. No civilized society should allow that. But still, some people were asking for it. In spite of repeated government requests to stay at home, they would go out to socialize. I'm not talking about those going to find groceries or cash at an ATM. I used to regularly find kids talking in groups or people in groups smoking. People who decided to take joyrides on their vehicles, going for religious congregations with 100s of people.\n\nIn spite of such irresponsible people, we are somehow holding our own and it's only because of the tireless work of our frontline warriors.\n\n**Our celebrities are doing their bit**\n\nOur celebs realise that their words count for a lot. And each of them has been proactive in hammering the message across. Our cricketers posted many messages asking people to stay at home. Akshay Kumar jumped at the chance to donate 25 cr to the PMs fund. So did many regional stars.\n\n**India will never be the same.**\n\nIndia has, never in its history, come together like this to fight a common opponent. Whatever happens henceforth, the world, and India will never be the same after the virus.\n\n**Each of us has a responsibility** to contribute as much as we can to this fight. For the normal people out there, all we need to do is stay at home and do what is asked of us. To look at others with empathy, To not be so quick to criticize.\n\nJai Hind."<br />Author: 'xzygnos'  id: 'fqp278'<br />Score:23<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fqp278/proud_of_being_an_indian/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'As a hospital worked to the bone, how do you deal with public negativity and keep up the morale of the medical staff?'<br />Body: 'Sorry if the formatting is bad I\'m on my phone. Also sorry if this doesn\'t belong here, I went through the rules but I\'m still not sure if I can post something like this here. TL;DR is at the end. \n\nI live in a small town (tier-3 city) in North India and work in the administrative team of a private 200-bedded hospital. The local journalist communities are exactly the kinds you\'d expect from a backward area - Ones that publish sensationalised "news" based on hearsay and opinions rather than by way of investigation and verification of facts. I know it is and has always been a tactic to force organisations into paying them off but how far these people can go can be really shocking.\n\nWe\'ve been ignoring their power trip for a while now, and usually when they create bad press for us, we put out the facts and let the public make an opinion themselves, but it\'s getting more and more ludicrous every day. This hospital has had a reputation for well over 40 years for following government systems and law, and for not getting involved with politics and "pay offs". The history of the hospital is well-known in the city, that it was founded by very simple doctors who earnestly wanted to help society and they\'ve dedicated their lives to that.\n\nBeing a private hospital, we are usually too busy continuously improving healthcare delivery while trying to keep costs to patient pocket friendly, and thus are too busy to come up with counter-strategies against the malicious misinformation. Simply speaking, if we start countering these distributors of false content, we will not have the time or space of mind to do our actual jobs and the quality of medical care to patients will suffer, which is what we care more for.\n\nUnfortunately, the public in the town reads this misinformation and is usually swung by it, not just if they haven\'t visited our hospital before, but even regular visitors who know our doctors in and out. I often hear feedback from first-time patients about how they were sceptical to visit our hospital at first, but eventually discovered the experience at the hospital was above expectations. I usually also see negative online reviews spike when there is bad press, and these reviews are usually not traceable to a registered patient or their relatives.\n\nThe misinformation by these people has tarnished our image unnecessarily in the past but now it\'s getting seriously ridiculous. \n\nThe most recent example;\nThe administration in our city had eariler passed an order for all suspected COVID-19 patients that report to any hospital, to be reported and referred to the local government hospital assigned for testing and isolating suspected and confirmed cases, so that they can keep a better track of the situation. The local medical fraternity and local IMA chapter too were in agreement of this as this would help the local authorities track down renegade patients who did not wish to admit to their symptoms and tried to abscond. The local papers however, paint such referrals and transfers (based on Government orders!) as our hospital\'s refusal to treat patients in the city\'s time of need. I mean, what are we supposed to do? Break protocol or go against government orders? Had they done a little further investigation, they\'d have easily accessed the orders from the appropriate medical authority, but I suppose that is expecting too much from them.\n\nI also know that these journalist communities are backed by local MLAs, and shady associations of medical suppliers who\'ve tried to bulldoze us in the past. In the time of this pandemic, I see other local hospitals turning away patients from their gates, with no record of their visit and without information to any government authority, based on simply that the patient\'s temperature indicated high fever (a symptom of COVID-19) and their concern for their own health over the patient\'s well-being or the overall goal to contain the spread in the city. I don\'t mean to point fingers but it\'s sometimes really annoying that we make the news and a blind eye is turned to actual unethical situations that go around in the city.\n\nAs a simple private hospital where everyone literally just wants to do their job and do it well, it is terribly discouraging. On one end, they clap, make noise with plates and ring bells for the medical heroes, and at the same time the same people bully medical staff, call them COVID-19 carriers as they take care of someone\'s mum and dad, leaving their own behind for round the clock shifts, and are turned out of PGs, hostels, and blamed for the spread of the disease in the city, as if our hospital is the reason the COVID-19 has even become a pandemic. (Seriously?) There are people refusing medical advice and not reporting their symptoms, there are still people in my city who are going out for fresh air, despite the curfew and lockdown orders, medical suppliers are hoarding sanitisers and masks for profit, and so on, but only our hospital is in the news because we don\'t succumb to bribing them to shut them up.\n\nNow with the home isolations and curfews, the newshounds have all the time in the world to create false articles and sensational untruths. It has gotten to the point that recently there have been incidents with our staff where they\'ve been called out on the roads and been bullied by police over "refusal to treat patients" even though our hospital was the first hospital to prepare an isolation ward and receive government authorised training for management of COVID-19 patients. \n\nThe management has always found these nasty tactics beneath them, and have never taken the baits, but God it\'s infuriating to me personally. More than that, however, I worry for our staff. Keeping the morale of medicos in a tier-3 up is more difficult than it seems (the living standards, overall Maslow\'s need hierarchy, and public attitude etc.) I empathise very much as they have a tough job already, made harder by blind believers. I want nothing else, but to do something to make it better for the staff but I am at my wit\'s end as to what I can do to stop my staff from getting trampled in the sensationalised news world. They are all simple and good people, trying to get our city through a crisis just like any other medical staff around the world. \n\nI love India and want to use my education and experience to build something better here, but things like these make one feel so powerless and useless that you don\'t even want to serve the people or give out positivity to the quiet majority because of a few loud bad eggs. I have considered several times to quit it all and move abroad anyway. Maybe I am looking for some positivity that I can pass on or a reason to stay/get back in the game. \n\n\nTL;DR - \nI work at a hospital in a tier-3 city of India as a manager. Staff morale has been low due to to blatantly wrong facts being sensationalised and reported as news by local journalists backed by political goons. It\'s annoying in general and we ignore it, but its tougher in the times of this pandemic when the shady are at home, free to publish false stories and the medical organisations are not even available to defend themselves. The staff risking their lives at the frontlines are painted as villains and I\'m kind of disappointed in our city, but it\'s okay. The main goal is to find anything that can help me make it better for the staff, they could really use some uplifting, but I am myself quite demotivated seeing people\'s behavior. So...

But Sañjaya disappointed him again in relating that Arjuna was competent to kill his enemies (parantapaḥ). Although Arjuna was for the time being overwhelmed with false grief due to family affection, he surrendered unto Kṛṣṇa, the supreme spiritual master, as a disciple. This indicated that he would soon be free from the false lamentation resulting from family affection and would be enlightened with perfect knowledge of self-realization, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and would then surely fight. Thus Dhṛtarāṣṭra\'s joy would be frustrated, since Arjuna would be enlightened by Kṛṣṇa and would fight to the end.  \n**Question 1 : What is the significance of the word "parantapaḥ" with reference to this verse ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h3m86ufjbdp41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2738957d72cbd8626fc23df0218545991c31fd2\n\n  \nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'fqfr65'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fqfr65/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_29/</li>

India is one of the best partners you need in this hour to disintegrate dragon. No one better than India will stand with all its might in this game with you! \n\n\\- Within 25-30 months of Trump 2.0 ensure embargo, sanctions and tariffs on China and its allies to fuck with OBOR. \n\n\\- Here, you are now close to 2024 elections and Trump is set to move out of the White House.

I will not be able to destroy it even if I win an unrivalled kingdom on the earth with sovereignty like that of the demigods in heaven.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nAlthough Arjuna was putting forward so many arguments based on knowledge of the principles of religion and moral codes, it appears that he was unable to solve his real problem without the help of the spiritual master, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He could understand that his so-called knowledge was useless in driving away his problems, which were drying up his whole existence; and it was impossible for him to solve such perplexities without the help of a spiritual master like Lord Kṛṣṇa. Academic knowledge, scholarship, high position, etc., are all useless in solving the problems of life; help can only be given by a spiritual master like Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, the conclusion is that a spiritual master who is one hundred percent Kṛṣṇa conscious is the bona fide spiritual master, for he can solve the problems of life. Lord Caitanya said that one who is master in the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, regardless of his social position, is the real spiritual master.\n\nkibāvipra, kibā nyāsī, śūdra kene naya\n\nyei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei \'guru\' haya.\n\n(Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Madhya 8.127)\n\n"It does not matter whether a person is a vipra \\[learned scholar in Vedic wisdom\\] or is born in a lower family, or is in the renounced order of life—if he is master in the science of Kṛṣṇa, he is the perfect and bona fide spiritual master." So without being a master in the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, no one is a bona fide spiritual master. It is also said in Vedic literatures:\n\nṣaṭ-karma-nipuṇo vipro mantra-tantra-viśāradaḥ\n\navaiṣṇavo gurur na syād vaiṣṇavaḥ śvapaco guruḥ\n\n"A scholarly brāhmaṇa, expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge, is unfit to become a spiritual master without being a Vaiṣṇava, or expert in the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But a person born in a family of a lower caste can become a spiritual master if he is a Vaiṣṇava, or Kṛṣṇa conscious."\n\nThe problems of material existence—birth, old age, disease and death—cannot be counteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic development. In many parts of the world there are states which are replete with all facilities of life, which are full of wealth, and economically developed, yet the problems of material existence are still present. They are seeking peace in different ways, but they can achieve real happiness only if they consult Kṛṣṇa, or the Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam—which constitute the science of Kṛṣṇa—or the bona fide representative of Kṛṣṇa, the man in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\nIf economic development and material comforts could drive away one\'s lamentations for family, social, national or international inebrieties, then Arjuna would not have said that even an unrivalled kingdom on earth or supremacy like that of the demigods in the heavenly planets would not be able to drive away his lamentations. He sought, therefore, refuge in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and that is the right path for peace and harmony. Economic development or supremacy over the world can be finished at any moment by the cataclysms of material nature. Even elevation into a higher planetary situation, as men are now seeking a place on the moon planet, can also be finished at one stroke. The Bhagavad-gītā confirms this: kṣīṇe puṇye martyalokaṁ viśanti "When the results of pious activities are finished, one falls down again from the peak of happiness to the lowest status of life." Many politicians of the world have fallen down in that way. Such downfalls only constitute more causes for lamentation.\n\nTherefore, if we want to curb lamentation for good, then we have to take shelter of Kṛṣṇa, as Arjuna is seeking to do. So Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa to solve his problem definitely, and that is the way of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n**Question 1 : Can the problems of material existence—birth, old age, disease and death—be counteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic development ? If not, how they can be counteracted ?**\n\n**Question 2 : Who according to Lord Chaitanya is a real spiritual master ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qdgfu9jmz5p41.png?width=599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f43e5009cbcffa823a6b58251f50f0eb3e9c1e8\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual\u200b](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'fpshnu'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fpshnu/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_28/</li>

क्या वास्तव में  उन्होंने इनका निर्माण दो सप्ताह में किया? हो ही नहीं सकता। वो  उनका निर्माण पहले से ही कर चुके थे। क्युंकी ये सब एक योजना का हिस्सा था।\nकल उन्होंने घोषणा की कि उन्होंने महामारी को रोक दिया है। वे जश्न मनाते हुए वीडियो में दिखाई देते हैं, वे घोषणा करते हैं कि उनके पास एक टीका भी है। सभी आनुवंशिक जानकारी के बिना वे इसे इतनी जल्दी कैसे बना सकते हैं? पर यदि आप खुद ही इस नाटक के निर्माता हों तो यह बिल्कुल मुश्किल भी नहीं है।\n और आज मैंने सिर्फ एक वीडियो देखा जो बताता है कि कैसे जिन पिंग जो की दुनिया के  शक्तिशाली देश का राष्ट्रपति है, उसने पूरी दुनिया को बगैर किसी युद्ध के घुटने टेकने पर मजबूर कर दिया। कोरोना वायरस के कारण, चीन में पश्चिमी देशों की कंपनियों का कारोबार नाटकीय रूप से गिर गया। जब दुनिया भर के स्टॉक एक्सचेंजों में इन कंपनियों के शेयर के भाव गिर गए तो उन्हें चीनियों द्वारा खरीद लिया गया। अब चीन, अमेरिका और यूरोप में इन्हीं एक्सचेंजों और अपनी पूंजी द्वारा यह डिसाइड करेगा कि बाज़ार का रुख कैसा होगा, औेर कीमतों को निर्धारित करने में सक्षम होगा। पश्चिम को अपनी जरूरत की हर चीज बेचने के लिए। \nक्या गजब की योजना ?\n\nहा इसमें  संयोग से कुछ बूढ़े मर गए? कम उम्र के लोग भी मारे गए पर ना तो चीन को इसकी परवाह है और ना ही कोई  बड़ी समस्या। वो इनके परिजनों को थोड़े समय मुआवजे के रूप में पेंशन दे देगा , पर इसके एवज में उसने कितनी बड़ी लूट की है। अभी पश्चिम आर्थिक रूप से पराजित है, संकट में और बीमारी से स्तब्ध। बिना कुछ जाने कि यह सब एक योजना का हिस्सा है और बहुत ही सोच समझ कर बनाई गई परफेक्ट योजना ।\nअब चीन 1.18 ट्रिलियन होल्डिंग वाले जापान के बाद अमेरिकी खजाने के सबसे बड़े मालिक है।\n-------_ -------------- _------- //// - ////// \nअब देखिए इस नाटक के दूसरे किरदारों का रोल \nकैसे रूस और उत्तर कोरिया में करोना नामक घातक बीमारी के केस इतने कम हैं या नहीं हैं जबकि वो तो चीन के सहयोगी हैं उनकी आपस में आवाजाही भी ज्यादा है। फिर भी क्युं उनके यहां करोना ने वैसा विकराल रूप नहीं दिखाया जैसा कि अन्य अमेरिकी और यूरोपीय देशों में देखने को मिला।\nक्या इसलिए कि वे चीन के कट्टर सहयोगी हैं ?\n\nदूसरी ओर संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिका / दक्षिण कोरिया / यूनाइटेड किंगडम / फ्रांस / इटली / स्पेन और एशिया गंभीर रूप से प्रभावित हैं\n\nकैसे वुहान अचानक घातक वायरस से मुक्त हुआ ?\n\nचीन का कहना है कि उसके द्वारा उठाए गए कठोर उपाय के कारण वुहान करोना मुक्त हो गया। कैसे वो कौन से उपाय थे, चीन ने उनका खुलासा नहीं किया। चलिए हम इसको इस तरह से देखते हैं कि वुहान ही क्यों जो वायरस पूरी दुनिया में फैल गया। वो वायरस चीन के दूसरे हिस्सों में क्यूं नहीं फैला ? बीजिंग जो कि चीन की राजधानी थी वहां इसका कोई भी असर देखने को क्यूं नहीं मिला? क्या एक भी संक्रमित बीजिंग तक नहीं पहुंचा ? जबकि पूरी दुनिया में संक्रमण फैल चुका है। या फिर इस नाटक को सिर्फ वुहान के लिए रचा गया था? क्या एक भी संक्रमित व्यक्ति ने नवम्बर से लेकर जनवरी तक वुहान  से चीन के अन्य हिस्सों में यात्रा नहीं की? जबकि इसके उलट ये संक्रमित  दुनिया के लगभग हर कोने में पहुंच गए। वो भी अच्छी खासी तादाद में, कैसे? क्यू ?\nबीजिंग में करोना से एक व्यक्ति नहीं मारा गया? और सिर्फ वुहान में हजारों.. \n\nयह विचार करना और  दिलचस्प है ., कि अब कैसे चीन ने इस पर काबू पा लिया? उन्होंने इसका क्या इलाज किया और फिर अब उसे व्यापार के लिए खोल भी दिया। आखिर कैसे? जबकि दुनिया भर के डाक्टर इसका इलाज ढूंढ रहे हैं तो चीनियों ने कैसे ये चमत्कार कर लिया? \n\nखैर .. \n\nकरोना को हमें व्यापार युद्ध में यूएसए द्वारा चीन की बांह मोड़ने की पृष्ठभूमि में देखना चाहिए...\n\nअमेरिका और उपर्युक्त सभी देश आर्थिक रूप से तबाह हैं...\n\nजल्द ही अमेरिकी अर्थव्यवस्था चीन की योजना के अनुसार ढह जाएगी।\n\nचीन जानता है कि वह अमेरिका को सैन्य रूप से नहीं हरा सकता क्योंकि अमेरीका वर्तमान में दुनिया में सबसे शक्तिशाली देश है।\n\nतो उसने यहां वायरस का उपयोग किया ... जो कि अमेरिकी अर्थव्यवस्था और रक्षा क्षमताओं को पंगु बना दे।\n\nमुझे यकीन है कि नैन्सी पेलोसी(जो कि अमेरिकी विपक्षी दल की नेता है)  को भी इसमें एक हिस्सा मिला होगा .... ट्रम्प को पछाड़ने के लिए ...।\n राष्ट्रपति ट्रम्प हमेशा से यह बताते रहे हैं कि कैसे अमेरिकी अर्थव्यवस्था सभी मोर्चों पर सुधार कर रही थी और नौकरियां संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिका में वापस आ रही थीं।\n\nAMERICA GREAT AGAIN बनाने की उनकी दृष्टि को नष्ट करने का एकमात्र तरीका एक ECONOMIC HAVOC है।\n\nनैन्सी पेलोसी महाभियोग के माध्यम से ट्रम्प को नीचे लाने में असमर्थ थी ..... इसलिए क्यू ना चीन के साथ मिलकर एक वायरस जारी करके ट्रम्प को नष्ट कर दिया जाए ।\n\nवुहान की महामारी एक सोची समझी साजिश थी।\n\nआप ही सोचिए महामारी के चरम पर .... चीन के राष्ट्रपति शी जिनपिंग ... उन प्रभावी क्षेत्रों का दौरा करने के लिए जाते वक़्त  बस एक साधारण आरएम 1 फेसमास्क पहने हुए थे जबकि इटली में इस महामारी का इलाज कर रहे डाक्टर पूरी तरह कवर होने और सावधानी बरतने के बाद भी संक्रमित हो रहे हैं।\n\nराष्ट्रपति के रूप में उन्हें सिर से पैर तक ढंका जाना चाहिए था ... लेकिन ऐसा नहीं था, क्यों?  क्या इसीलिए की इस महामारी से होने वाले किसी भी प्रकार के नुकसान से बचने के लिए उन्होंने पहले से ही कोई टीका लगा रखा था ? इसका मतलब है कि इस महामारी का इलाज पहले ही ढूंढ लिया गया था, बाद में इस वायरस को फैलाया गया है।\nशायद यह सब चीन की योजना थी, अब  ECONOMIC COLLAPSE के कगार पर बैठे देशों से अधिकतर शेयर स्टॉक खरीदने के बाद विश्व अर्थव्यवस्था को नियंत्रित करने  की ..... बाद में चीन यह घोषणा करेगा कि उनके मेडिकल शोधकर्ताओं ने वायरस को नष्ट करने का इलाज ढूंढ लिया है और इस तरह इस नाटक की समाप्ति की घोषणा हो जाएगी और बिना किसी युद्ध के चीन ने अपना साम्राज्य पूरी दुनिया में फैला दिया। अब वह अपने देश में बैठे बैठे ही किसी भी देश की अर्थवयवस्था को हिला सकता है। जैसा की अभी भारत ने मलेशिया के साथ किया था। जब मलेशिया के राष्ट्रपति ने धारा 370 के खिलाफ बयान दिए थे, उसके बाद भारत ने वहां के बाजार को हिलाकर रख दिया। ऐसा ही अब चीन भी अपने सभी पश्चिमी गठबंधनों के साथ मिलकर विश्व के अलग अलग  देशों की अर्थव्यवस्था के साथ करेगा, और ये देश बहुत जल्द ही अपने नए मास्टर ..... चीन के गुलाम हो जाएंगे। भविष्य का युद्ध हथियारों से नहीं व्यापार से शेयर स्टॉक से लड़ा जाएगा और चीन ने इस विश्व युद्ध की शुरुआत कर दी है। आपको हमें और देश को समझना होगा कि इस तरह के युद्ध में हमारी रणनीति क्या हो ?'<br />Author: 'Bunty2321'  id: 'fpof1a'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fpof1a/am_i_right/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Indian Corona crisis'<br />Body: '  \n\n**The Crisis.** \n\nMaybe many aren’t used to the whole virus thing attacking a human, staying inside them, feeding on them, growing within, evolving, mutating, making them sick and spreading to the ones nearby by whatever means, here we say, a mere touch, or even inspiring the air they breathe out. \n\nThis is something people don’t get to witness happening, which is why they don’t want to take it into something serious that could even affect them in turn, many are being ignorant, rather negligent.\n\nIf it were a Tsunami, waves crashing on the shores, capsizing boats, drowning people, screams all-around, there they get to see something live, they need not try and visualize things, as it’s all there happening. The same way an earthquake, cracks on the ground, buildings crumbling, felling of the walls and trees and everything around, even there they get to see something really bad happening around. This is where people get serious about, this is where they don’t try to mock it or laugh around it. They just want to witness it all live, hear the screams, look at the dead bodies being carried away, these define disasters or devastating occurrences and not something invisible, no matter how deadly it is or the amount of desolation it could bring upon the human kind let alone the economic impacts. People need to be more sensible and informed so that they get to understand the immensity of such an episode.\n\nIn a country of such a magnitude like India, people are supposed to be the paddlers rather they unknowingly are being a deterrence, breaking paddles, making holes on the deck, trying to fill the same with their fellow paddlers. \n\nThere can never be a perfect government, even the best ones couldn’t satisfy all sections of people. The thing to be understood here is that no government would want its subjects to suffer and die, that too during times of crises, it’s the duty of the government to take care of the people and to provide them with the basic amenities so as to come out of the situation in good health, giving its all. \n\nThere will be shortcomings, inconveniences, mismanagements, economic issues, the government would only look to sort it all out, the supposedly paddlers need not like it, but could be a little supportive at least during these times and keep their criticisms for later, this not only helps building confidence among people but would create an oneness, which would help in reaping greater positive results.\n\nA mere comparison of governments, leaders, he did this, he did that kind of things will just be of no help during instances of such enormity. Hatred is one of the key concerns prevailing around, the criticizing of a person or a government or their deeds just for the sake of doing it has increased, irrespective of the place, context and relevance. Looking up for instances to quote as examples isn’t really necessary despite there being many. These open criticisms, on open forums and portals mocking the steps taken, being harsh towards people trying to help would create anxiety, fear and disruption amongst the public. Togetherness is the need of the hour, try to give strength and belief, spread positivity, educate the ignorant and the young, be responsible, talk to those in need, befriend the lonely, support the whole cause. \n\nIf you want to be supportive, be it, if not, just stay calm and wait for the situation to stabilize and let normalcy prevail. Lives are being lost, precious human lives, stay calm, stay home, stay safe, let the storm pass, we shall pick up the rags and broken wood later, Together...!'<br />Author: 'vishsk'  id: 'fpk2p1'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fpk2p1/the_indian_corona_crisis/</li>

I think very lowly of those people who indulge in those types of discussions. **But I think we can all agree that Indian customs and traditions deal with virus outbreaks better than many other societies.** \n\nIt's as if ancient Indians have experienced it all, and so tweaked their culture to manage various diseases. Goddess Mariamman for instance is worshipped by many in the South because she's said to cure smallpox and chicken pox. In the very least, it shows that ancient Indians were very concerned about diseases, a lot more than other people.  \n\nIn Malaysia, many churches, mosques and temples have held mass-gatherings in the past two months. The gatherings in mosques and churches have caused high number of new cases, but temples didn't. At first I thought it was mere coincidence. \n\nBut as I delve deeper, I realized that Hindu temples (of South Indian Architecture) have vast open spaces where air is free to move in and out of the temple, as opposed to closed-spaces in mosques and churches. Besides, in Hindu festivals like Thaipusam, people move constantly. Even if you come close to an infected person, you won't be near him for very long. It's also held in an open-space, under the Sun. \n\nWe now know all of these are significant because sunlight, high temperature and high humidity adversely affect the transmission of a virus ( [link](https://www.accuweather.com/en/health-wellness/coronavirus-expert-says-the-virus-will-burn-itself-out-in-about-6-months/679415)).

In fact he himself suggested that based on our vedic Purana there are certain times when the sun is at the peak of his prowess. NASA confirmed starting from 25th March which is also gudi padva in Maharashtra, the sun will get harsher. Our great PM suggested about lockdown in whole of India. The NASA scientists laughed as they thought locking down a country of 1.3 billion people is impossible. Our home minister who was also present at the video conference as he was yet to sleep just said: PM hai to Mumkin hai.The scientists then did calculations and suggested that 21 day lockdown will be enough to get rid of the virus and that's exactly what was announced. Now it is matter of pride of our country and PM. We all know how NASA monitors our country from the sky. We all have seen those Diwali photos from the sky. NASA will also monitor our country during this 21 day lockdown.

But none of them dared to go out, which is perfectly understandable.\n\nWe bring out contact number of several police stations, as it required to cross district border.

Also, gave the in-charge's number in case of emergency.\n\nMy father got the reports and prescription of grandmother and started for city. He was stopped at 6 places with heavy police deployment. Everywhere they asked for reason and 2 places they inspected the documents. \n\nWithout any trouble, father went and came to home within 3 hours.\n\n\nTL;DR : Speak to your police station, in case you really needs to go out for long distance.

It might take 3 days to reach Delhi. People had nothing to do, no one was busy. Everyone was sharing the time together, all were on the same boat. Families would buy stuff together. Everyone inquired what the current station is, because if it is a big station you could get some good food. There are water shortages, you hope you can buy mineral water in the next station. By the 2nd day the food you bought from home is over, you now have to go out to buy food. Eventually you get tired of sitting and the boys/men go out and stand around when a station comes. Few kids are studying for school. Most are playing games, antakshari. Half of them are always sleeping 24x7.

      <li>Title::: 'Learn Something New - Google Ads - Part 1'<br />Body: "First of all, I hope everyone reading this is staying indoors and staying healthy. In these trying times it is important that we don't panic and fall pray to rumors. \n\n**What is this all about?**\nMost people who are visiting this thread already know that India is on a 21 days lockdown. So, since I am a strong believer in learning new things and in sharing knowledge with everyone, I wanted to start this series of posts. Through these posts, I hope to share my Google Ads knowledge with anyone interested in learning it and hopefully inspire others to share their knowledge and expertise with us.\n\n**What will you learn?**\nAt first, these posts will help you learn Google Ads, enough to get you started with your first campaign. I will also share some tips and tricks I have learnt along the way and some advanced strategies. Later on we can look at what are the metrics tracked in Google Ads, what do they all mean and which ones to focus on based on your goals.\n\n**Who is this for?**\nEveryone is welcome. But the knowledge here is more geared towards beginners. Advanced users can always share their thoughts in the comments.\n\n**How can you use this knowledge?**\nSome will find this knowledge useful to sell their own products or services on Google, others can add an extra skill during this lockdown period and yet others might find this knowledge useful to kickstart their careers in Google Ads.\n\n**Posts**\nSo far I have come up with 12 parts(might change) that will help you get started with your campaign. We will be starting with creating a Google Ads account. Wherever possible, I will share detailed screenshots of the process, explain why certain settings were chosen over others and share some tips and experiences.\n\n**Frequency**\nI will aim to share as many parts as I can bi-weekly. Hopefully I can get most of my knowledge out before the lockdown ends.\n\n**Other sources for similar knowledge**\nI highly recommend going through this [podcast](https://paidsearchpodcast.com/). It should also be available on iTunes and Stitcher.\n[PPC Hero](https://www.ppchero.com/) and [Search Engine Land](https://searchengineland.com/) are some more great sources for everything PPC\nNote, I am not paid by any of them. I just think they are cool resources.\nOf course, besides these there are thousands of other resources online. YouTube, Udemy, Simplilearn should have some amazing resources as well.\n\nLet's get started.\n\n**What is Google Ads?**\nGoogle Ads (previously Google AdWords) is a paid advertising platform that helps you reach your potential customers just as they are searching for the products or services you offer. This form of advertising is also known as pay per click (PPC). Simply put, the ad that you see on top of a Google search results page is a Google Ad.\n[Reference](https://imgur.com/WqwykwG)\nThe ad that you see in the example above is a search ad. Google today offers a variety of different forms of ads like display ads (video and image) besides the search ads.\n[Reference](https://imgur.com/I9SVsL1)\nDisplay ads appear on other websites or on Google properties like YouTube and Gmail. Besides search and display there are more ad types but, for now we will go into these two types only.\n\n**Why Use Google Ads?**\n* Massive reach\n* Highly measurable\n* Cost control\n[I'll let Google themselves explain this](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6123875?hl=en)\n\n**How does Google Ads work?**\nThere is a lot going on behind the curtains when you are served with an ad by Google. The advertisers bid on important terms(keywords. “Ad Words”. Get it?)  and then ads go through a scoring process to determine their position on the search page or the website it will be placed on. This can be a bit complicated for beginners and we will go through this in much more details further.\n\n**Have more questions?**\nAsk in the comments.\n\nSo, without further ado, let’s start with the simplest but the most essential lesson you will learn throughout these posts - Creating a Google Ads Account.\n\n**Creating a Google Ads Account**\nIn this part, we’ll walk through each and every step in creating your very own Google Ads account. We will delve into setting up business info and other very important settings and preferences. Think this is too basic? You’ll be surprised to know the number of people I have come across who find this almost impossible.\n\n**What you’ll need**\n* A Google Account\n* Physical location of the business\n* Time zone preference\n* Currency to use\n\n**Sign up for Google Ads (its free to sign up)**\n* Go to this URL (https://ads.google.com/intl/en_in/home/)\n* Click on “Start Now” or “Sign In” [Reference](https://imgur.com/8Cz6W0i)\n* Enter the email address you want to use and sign in. If you don’t have a Google Account, just create a Google Account and then use that to sign in.\n* Agree to all the terms and conditions, if prompted to enable two step verification, enable it\n\n**Skip campaign creation (for now)**\n* Google will immediately prompt you with creating our campaign. We skip it for now. Click on “Experienced with Google Ads? [Reference](https://imgur.com/R1Cnrx1)\n* Sometimes, you may see a different screen. If so, click “Switch to Expert Mode” and click it [Reference](https://imgur.com/7Z6TaeO)\n* Click on “Create an account without a campaign” [Reference](https://imgur.com/gecGKVn)\n\n**Confirm your location, time and currency preferences**\n* You will be prompted to confirm your business information [Reference](https://imgur.com/9PXhcUe)\n* Please ensure that you select the correct information here. These settings cannot be manually changed later. Let’s say you are in India and you choose Rupee as the currency for your account, you will not be able to provide reports in currency other than INR going forward. This is a problem when your client is situated in a different country. Time zone is also important as ad scheduling is based on what you chose here.\n* Click submit\nRejoice! You are done with the most basic step here. Simply click on “Explore Your Account” to proceed [Reference](https://imgur.com/nNjGFZI)\n\nThe next session is where things will start getting really interesting. This is where you start the real work. We will delve into keyword and competitor research. I'll get these parts up as soon as possible.\n\nBefore we go any further. It is important to note that Google Ads is a black hole for your money. Be extremely careful with what you do here. If you tell Google to spend x amount/day you could end up spending 2x amount or even more at times if you are not careful.\n\nAgain, I hope others here share their knowledge with this community. Stay safe everyone and stay indoors."<br />Author: 'bhelpuri13'  id: 'foso2z'<br />Score:48<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/foso2z/learn_something_new_google_ads_part_1/</li>

Please instruct me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy nature\'s own way the complete system of material activities is a source of perplexity for everyone. In every step there is perplexity, and therefore it behooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper guidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic literatures advise us to approach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life which happen without our desire. They are like a forest fire that somehow blazes without being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such that perplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion. No one wants fire, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic wisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who is in the disciplic succession. A person with a bona fide spiritual master is supposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in material perplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is the purport of this verse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWho is the man in material perplexities? It is he who does not understand the problems of life. In the Garga Upaniṣad the perplexed man is described as follows:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nyo vā etad akṣaraṁ gārgy aviditvāsmāl lokāt praiti sa kṛpaṇaḥ\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n"He is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a human and who thus quits this world like the cats and dogs, without understanding the science of self-realization." This human form of life is a most valuable asset for the living entity who can ultilize it for solving the problems of life; therefore, one who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a miser. On the other hand, there is the brāhmaṇa, or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe kṛpaṇas, or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly affectionate for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life. One is often attached to family life, namely to wife, children and other members, on the basis of "skin disease." The kṛpaṇa thinks that he is able to protect his family members from death; or the kṛpaṇa thinks that his family or society can save him from the verge of death. Such family attachment can be found even in the lower animals who take care of children also. Being intelligent, Arjuna could understand that his affection for family members and his wish to protect them from death were the causes ot his perplexities. Although he could understand that his duty to fight was awaiting him, still, on account of miserly weakness, he could not discharge the duties. He is therefore asking Lord Kṛṣṇa, the supreme spiritual master, to make a definite solution. He offers himself to Kṛṣṇa as a disciple. He wants to stop friendly talks. Talks between the master and the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk very seriously before the recognized spiritual master. Kṛṣṇa is therefore the original spiritual master of the science of Bhagavad-gītā, and Arjuna is the first disciple for understanding the Gītā. How Arjuna understands the Bhagavad-gītā is stated in the Gītā itself. And yet foolish mundane scholars explain that one need not submit to Kṛṣṇa as a person, but to "the unborn within Kṛṣṇa." There is no difference between Kṛṣṇa\'s within and without.
