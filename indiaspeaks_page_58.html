      <li>Title::: 'What was the Name of Sardar Patel’s Father - Arun Jaitley'<br />Body: 'He has put this article on FB. \n\nThe debate whether India should be a dynastic democracy has been ignited by a self-goal of the Congress Party. The Prime Minister’s mother’s age was made a subject matter of the electoral debate. His father’s anonymity was commented upon as an inadequate credential of the Prime Minister. The argument given was that if you represent the legacy of a well-known family, it is a political point in your favour. Millions of talented political workers who come from modest family backgrounds would fail by the Congress test of leadership. Merit, talent, ability to inspire and lead would not be a virtue. The Congress considers only a great surname as a political brand. \nOn hearing this rationale, I asked a few well informed friends of mine three questions:\n\n(1) What is the name of Gandhiji’s father?\n\n(2) What is the name of Sardar Patel’s father?\n\n(3) What is the name of Sardar Patel’s wife?\n\nNone of my well informed friends had a definitive answer. This is the tragedy of Congress politics and its impact on the nation. Gandhiji led the most extraordinary freedom movement of India. He created, through political awareness, Satyagraha and non-violence, an environment where British found it impossible to continue in India. Sardar Patel’s contribution was second to none. Besides being a frontline leader of the freedom movement, he, as the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India, negotiated the transfer of power with the British. He negotiated the integration of India with over 550 rulers. He gave to India, within a short period of few months, its present geography. Incidentally, Gandhiji’s father was Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi, Sardar Patel’s father was Jhaverbhai Patel and his wife’s name was Diwali Ba. No photograph of his wife or her details are available even after extensive research by modern day historians. \n\n**The Officially Glamorised Family**\n\nThe reason for this is simple. Decades of Congress rule, naming colonies, localities, cities, bridges, airports, railway stations, schools, colleges, universities, stadiums after one family was intended to declare the ‘Gandhis’ as India’s royalty. They were ‘officially glamorised’ as the blue blooded family of India. The others did not matter. In fact, upon Sardar Patel’s death in Mumbai, Prime Minister Nehru requested many of his cabinet colleagues that the best tribute to the Sardar would be to work on the day of his funeral and not go to Mumbai. The then Head of State and several Union Ministers defied the advice. The proposal for building his statue at Vijay Chowk was rejected. The country had to be satisfied with the installation of his statue at a traffic round-about on Parliament Street. \n\nMany believe that Sardar Patel was a farmer leader because of his participation in Bardoli Satyagraha. On the contrary, he was one of Ahmedabad’s most successful practicing Barristers. Panditji is passed off as a great lawyer though he never argued a single case in his entire career. He only went to court once for reasons of tokenism to sit behind senior lawyers led by Bholabhai Desai who was arguing for the three INA officers in the mutiny trial inside the Red Fort. \n\n**The danger of Glamorising at the Cost of Others**\n\nThe dangers of officially glamorising one family at the cost of those who made a far greater contribution is dangerous both for the nation as also for the party to which they belong. The contribution of other great stalwarts like Patel and Subhash Chandra Bose is downplayed. Members of one family are projected as larger than life. Their aberrations become national aberrations. The party adopts them as its ideology. When Panditji promoted his daughter as his successor, he laid the foundation of India as a dynastic democracy. When the daughter, in 1975, turned dictatorial, it became the party’s ideology to convert India into a “disciplined democracy”. When the Sikh were massacred in 1984, communal polarisation against them was considered a legitimate electoral strategy. Today anti-BJPsm leads the Congress to a situation where it can tie up even with its political rivals and sympathise with the Maoists, separatists and disruptionists.\nThe country pays a price for dynastic policies as we have witnessed in several regions. Three families – two of them in Srinagar and one in New Delhi in the last 71 years, have played with the destiny of Jammu and Kashmir. The consequences are obvious. Following the dynastic pattern of leadership within the Congress, several other parties have followed the same principle. In such organisations there is no inner party democracy, there are no ideological principles. There is a complete flexibility to switch sides and align with your erstwhile political opponents. In Andhra Pradesh, NTR filled up the political vacuum and created an alternative to the Congress. Gradually the party went into a control of the present Chief Minister who is willing to switch sides in every general election. There is no second line of leadership and the option offered is of “a coalition of rivals”. \nThe political parties in question also pay a price. The only leaders who have a political future are the ones which are acceptable to the leaders of the dynastic parties. You fall foul of the family, you are thrown out of the party or marginalised. Talent has no space. Merit is no virtue. Organisational structure need not exist. The charisma of the family alone is the party’s vote bank. The crowd around the family is the cadre. \n\n**The Weakness of the Dynastic Parties**\n\nThis model, however, has one significant weakness. Strength of the party is co-existent with the strength of the current generation of the dynasty. If he is found to be non-inspirational or inadequate in leadership, the party has to throw all its eggs in an incomplete basket. The basket may be worth only 44 Lok Sabha seats, at times slightly less; at times slightly more. The ill-informed reactions of the leader become the new ideology. The silver lining, however, is that India is changing. It has very large middle class and very strong aspirational class aspiring to get into the middle classes. This aspirational India judges parties and leaders very harshly. They don’t accept whoever is imposed. They ask difficult and penetrating questions and their yardstick is very tough. They look for leaders of integrity, they look for men and women who can inspire them, who are decisive and can lead the nation. To them surnames don’t matter – competence and capacity does. \n\n**The Challenge of 2019**\n\nThe real strength of Indian democracy would be when the charismas of some families is completely shattered and parties, through a democratic process, throw up leaders of merit and competence. This was more than adequately proved in 2014 where most dynastic parties lost miserably. India of 2019 is different from India of 1971. If the Congress Party wants the 2019 elections to be between Prime Minister Modi, who is the son of lesser known parents and someone who is known only for his parentage rather than capacity, merit and competence, the BJP would gladly accept the challenge. Let this be the agenda for 2019.'<br />Author: 'ribiy'  id: 'a0syiq'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a0syiq/what_was_the_name_of_sardar_patels_father_arun/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'After PanamaPapers, IndianExpress have teamed up for #ImplantFiles. In this year long investigation, it was found how faulty medical devices have been approved in dozens of countries including India ($5.2 billion market), based on approval from EU or US authorities and remains largely unchecked.'<br />Body: "Video explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZUzmA32Lbo\n\nIntroductory blog post: https://www.icij.org/blog/2018/11/icij-publishes-new-investigation-the-implant-files/\n\n\n**What is the Implants Files investigation?**\n\n&gt; It is a global examination of the medical device industry and its overseers. The International Consortium of International Journalists (ICIJ) and a team of more than 250 reporters and data specialists from 58 news organisations in 36 countries examined hundreds of cases to investigate various aspects of the medical device industry — regulation, faulty devices and corruption. The ICIJ and its partners filed more than 1,500 public records requests and collected more than 8 million device-related records, including recall notices, safety warnings, legal documents and corporate financial filings. More than 5.4 million “adverse event” reports sent by various countries to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over the last decade make up the greatest share.\n\n-\n\n**What are its main findings?**\n\n&gt; First, that governments in dozens of countries in Africa, South America and Asia don’t regulate medical devices, instead placing their trust in European authorities or in the US FDA.\n\n&gt; Second, medical devices that broke, misfired, corroded, ruptured or otherwise malfunctioned after implantation or use — despite assurances by regulators, the industry and doctors that they were safe — were linked to 1.7 million injuries and nearly 83,000 deaths over the last decade. Nearly 5,00,000 reports mentioned an explant — a surgery to remove a device — in connection with an adverse event.\n\n&gt; Third, that doctors and manufacturers often fail to report adverse events, and when they do the information can be unverified and incomplete.\n\n-\n\n**What is a medical device, and to what extent are these regulated in India?**\n\n&gt; India’s regulator Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) broadly defines a medical device as any “instrument, apparatus, appliance, software, material, or other article” that is to be used, whether alone or in combination, for “diagnostic or therapeutic purposes”. Earlier, only 10 notified medical devices were regulated in India. This has since been broadened to 23 categories of devices. These mainly include syringes, needles, perfusion sets, in vitro devices for HIV treatment, catheters, intra-ocular lenses, cannulas, bone cements, heart valves, orthopaedic implants, coronary stents, IUDs and condoms.\n\n**How big is the market for medical devices in India?**\n\n&gt; According to industry estimates cited on the Make in India website, the industry in India is currently valued at $5.2 billion and contributes 4-5% to the $96.7 billion Indian health care industry. The Indian medical device market is expected grow to $50 billion by 2025. Currently, India is the fourth largest medical devices market in Asia after Japan, China and South Korea.\n\n&gt; Equipment and instruments constitute nearly 54% of the medical devices in the market; the other important segments are consumables and disposables that are mostly manufactured by Indian player, patients aids like hearing aids and pacemakers, various implants, and stents.\n\nRead more here:  [#ImplantFiles | An ICIJ-Express investigation: Why implants were probed](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/implantfiles-an-icij-express-investigation-why-implants-were-probed-5464032/)\n\n---\n\nIndepth articles till now punished on their IE's portal: https://indianexpress.com/about/implant-files/\n\n- [Big medical device bazaar: Faulty implants, basement surgeries, lives at risk](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/big-medical-device-bazaar-faulty-implants-basement-surgeries-lives-at-risk-5463991/)\n\n- [New database tracks faulty medical devices across the globe](https://indianexpress.com/article/world/implant-files-new-database-tracks-faulty-medical-devices-across-the-globe-5464036/)\n\n- [Frequently asked questions and resources for readers](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/implant-files-frequently-asked-questions-and-resources-for-readers-5464041/)\n\n- [9 am, Room No. 7, AIIMS – 2 out of 10 here have had an implant gone wrong |  From clinics in small towns to hospitals in big cities, victims of botched surgeries make a beeline to this OPD for a second shot](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/implant-files-medical-surgery-9-am-room-no-7-aiims-2-out-of-10-here-has-had-an-implant-gone-wrong-5464033/).    \n\n- [Abbott coronary stents in 50 per cent adverse event reports for 2018.

      <li>Title::: 'A right wing perspective on Eminent Domain &amp; Land Snatching'<br />Body: 'Land Snatching for private companies is one of the vilest thing a Government can do. It\'s very popular in India where people think that business frandly is a right wing ideology.  \n\nActually, Protection of individual property rights is right at the top of stuff of right wing ideologies. \n\nRight wing ideology is to build infrastructure to enable factories and enterprises to function. Left wing ideology is to look for places where there is already decent infrastructure and then try to land snatch there and give it to private companies. \n\nEminent Domain laws are necessary for any country, but they are to be used mainly for long highways, railroads etc. Not to enable government to act like a broker for private companies.  \n\nA long highway cannot be built without violating property rights. Railroads cannot be built without violating property rights. The reason for this is that really long, continuous stretches of land are necessary and it\'s not going to be possible to buy or acquire this freely. However, even here the plan should be to plan the highway/railway lines in a way that as much as possible should be acquirable without force and for the remaining should be acquired using a land snatching bill (Eminent Domain). It\'s still land snatching (and not buying) but there is no alternative for it, so we should continue to do this in India. \n\nThe following things should never be allowed   \n\n- Use of Eminent domain for private industries &amp; PPP (unless PPP is for Highways/Railways kind of projects)  \n- Use of eminent domain for building stuff which does not require really long, continuous land (like most things except highways/railways).  \n\nIn the US, business frandly, left wing state and city governments have tried to use eminent domain for private enterprises but courts have usually come down against it and overturned the snatching &amp; returned it to the owners. However there was one case which was an exception - *Kelo v City of New London*. The City of New London is in Connecticut - a typical lefty, blue state which has voted for Democrats in the last 7 presidential elections. The City of New London snatched Susette Kelo &amp; a few of her neighbour\'s homes and made them sell the land to Pfizer for debelopment and jobs. The Supreme Court surprisingly didn\'t overturn this (it had done so many times before). The Supreme Court decision was a mixed bag - the 5 judges forming the majority opinion were a mix of right and left wing judges, similarly the 4 dissenters were also a mix of right and left wing judges.   \n\nThe dissenting opinion opposing land snatching was written by Sandra Day O\'Connor (left), Rheinquist (right), Scalia (right), Thomas (right). Rheinquist, Scalia and Thomas are usually considered far right judges. \n\nSome of the opinions from the dissenting Supreme Court Justices were   \n\n&gt; - Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party, but the fallout from this decision will not be random. The beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms.     \n\n&gt; - This deferential shift in phraseology enables the Court to hold, against all common sense, that a costly urban-renewal project whose stated purpose is a vague promise of new jobs and increased tax revenue, but which is also suspiciously agreeable to the Pfizer Corporation, is for a \'public use.\'      \n\n&gt; - Something has gone seriously awry with this Court\'s interpretation of the Constitution. Though citizens are safe from the government in their homes, the homes themselves are not.     \n\n\n&gt; - Allowing the government to take property solely for public purposes is bad enough, but extending the concept of public purpose to encompass any economically beneficial goal guarantees that these losses will fall disproportionately on poor communities. Those communities are not only systematically less likely to put their lands to the highest and best social use, but are also the least politically powerful   \n\nReaction to Kelo vs City of New London.   \n\n- Citizens were very upset. There was an upsurge of popular anger. \n\n- The Republicans were running the federal government of that time. They issued an executive order (this is like our Modiji\'s ordinance) that federal government cannot do something like this (Kelo Land Snatching was done by a local city government).    \n\n- As a result of this upsurge of popular anger, some 45 states have enacted eminent domain reform laws in the ten years since Kelo (most in the first three years after the ruling). No other Supreme Court decision in all of American history has generated so much state legislation. The state reform laws for Eminent Domain ensures that no government in that state can snatch people\'s property for private use. It was only some far left states which didn\'t. \n\n- The right was fully against Kelo vs City of New London, but suprisingly even some of the left wing orgs &amp; people stood with the right on this.  \n\n- Kelo vs City of New London happened in 2005. There is currently some talk in the US of making a constitutional amendment to prevent Land Snatching for private use all over the country.  \n\nIndian Land Snatching Laws always allowed Land Snatching for private use. But the bill which the current govt tried to pass a few years ago, extends it beyond private companies to even private entities.  \n\n- Modiji\'s Land Snatching Bill also reduces the consent clause from 80% to 70% - so would also apply for Land Snatching for use of private companies &amp; private entities.  \n\n- Consent is totally not required for Public Private Partnerships (among other kinds of projects).  \n\nIndia is a far, left country &amp; left wing ideologies like Land Snatching are very popular among the elites &amp; the 10 percenters. So let\'s please try to understand how vile a concept Land Snatching is before supporting it. In the long run, let\'s reduce left wing economic ideologies in India. \n\nSome references \n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/06/04/the-political-and-judicial-reaction-to-kelo/?utm_term=.ea0bbfe6d63a\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/10/16/a-constitutional-amendment-to-overrule-kelo-v-city-of-new-london/?utm_term=.1afae665529b\n\n\nVolokh Conspiracy is a right wing legal blog.

So, the question is, if it is any more worth it to have such a large standing army, and should India start to gradually cut short the number of personnel?\n\nIn the past, war used to be number game where the bigger the army, bigger the force, but in the modern threat environment it is not so simple. Now, what matters the most is on which country has the best technology, and generally, the country with a better economy tends to have better equipment.\n\nNow, other uses of the military are for disaster relief, internal problems like civil war, terrorist neutralization etc, but for all those tasks, it doesn't need so many people. I do not see what this 50+lakh personnel do on a daily basis.\n\nAnother use of the military is employment. It gives a steady source of employment to lakhs of people. But, if that is the case, then we can increase the number of personnel in Police forces, as they are horribly lacking.\n\nI come from a military family as in my grandfather and all of his brothers were military officers, and I studied in a military school, so I do understand a lot of what is going in the military. \n\nThat said, Indian army have recently stated that they plan to cut jobs by [1.5lakhs in next five years](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-to-cut-150-000-jobs-as-force-plans-to-go-lean-and-mean/story-GePcnuBveaGh6V8eqPY7KL.html) to go lean.

AskMeAnything\n\n-----------\n\n**Mr. Gurman,**\n\nA Data Journalist working with Hindustan Times and Reuters would be joining us for a Casual AMA from 28th to 30 Nov (Wed-Fri). \n\nThis means it would go for 2 days starting wed, and he would respond intermittently.\n\n**Who is he?**\n\nYou can know more about him here: http://gurmanbhatia.com/\n\n**What do we know him for?**\n\nSome of you might know his work &amp; post on[ pollution in Delh](https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-POLLUTION/01008173281/index.html)i, [how politicians spend their time in Parliament](https://www.hindustantimes.com/interactives/parliament-monsoon-session-2017-calendar/), and several such works. \n\n\n**What can you discuss with him?**\n\nAnything related to real life data, how it is presented in the news, or if you have your own data related curiosities you can share it with him, and perhaps if it gets support at work/from him he might work on it.\n\n\n---------------------\n# II. Announcements:\n\n\n# A. Planned Rule Revisions - Inputs welcome\n\n\n1. **Strike Cool downs**\n\n We plan to implement cool downs in our warning/strike related CSP. If a Regular user of the sub has not violated rules for an extended period of time (being determined, say around 4-6 months), their strikes from the board will be cleared. \n\n Please note, we'll have to use mod discretion in this  to avoid - alt abuse of loopholes, seriousness of violations, etc.\n\n Eg: If a user received a strike or two due to one-off or a few-off heated interaction (or in-the-moment emotion), but has refrained from such since then, the would be eligible for cooldowns.\n\n If a user generally has a a lot of hate speech or radical temperament, but has got strikes for inciting violence in the few content they went over board with - they wont be eligible for the cool down. \n\n Case-by-case, aim is to promote good, constructive interactions. Move on from one-off incidents if the user has turned a new leaf.\n\n\n2. **Locked posts.**\n\n We are aware that users have complained about locked posts clogging the front page, and wish it to be removed. It is a fair complaint when the limited slots of FP are hogged by these posts.\n\n We **DO NOT PLAN** to change this. Unless there are excess of reposts (De-cluttering), we don't remove locked posts. \n\n **Reasons:**\n &gt;*  Removing posts would be content curation, which is mainly community subject (vote it out).   \n &gt;* Users need to use their own sensibilities to understand if a news is genuine, noise, or drama. Don't depend on the judgement of mods for this. We are as human as you, as mods we dont know any better or worse than any other person. Also none of us on the mod team have any interest in imposing our world view via mod powers - so we have no interest on deciding what you need to see and what you don't. \n&gt; * We want to minimize spread of fake news, by removing a layer of misinformation - hence only un-edited titles allowed.\n\n\n That being said, if we see users who are trying to promote fake news/false information or even propaganda by abusing this, will be acted upon differently. \n\n &gt; So, if user constantly posts old news as new, or edits title for whatever reasons, such posts might be removed and the user warned. \n\n3. **Twitter submission rules - Phase II**\n\n As you are aware, we have updated our twitter policy where only verified twitterati can be directly linked. **Those who are unverified, but submit quality content can be added on our exceptions list.** \n\n Users can suggest exceptions in MMD or via mod mail. \n\n As a part of **Phase II**, those who are verified twitter users, but unreliable due to whatever reasons - the community can contest against them in MMD, or mod mail. We'll have a look into it. In case if reasons seem legitimate, we'll act on it - meaning, direct linking will be prevented, they'll have to go via self-posts for now.\n\n# B. We require a new mod\n\nWith drm and 4chan sort of retired, and with other mods a little busy, giving them less time on the sub, we need a new mod to fill the space. \n\nWhile we have compartmentalized some of the jobs, by giving limited permissions and allowances to kalmuah and decoder, we still need a full mod.\n\nThose who applied previously, but who just missed the cut would be contacted first. Feel free to throw your hat in - regular conditions apply (History on the sub, etc)\n\n# C. The Debate\n\nWe would like to know **your opinions** about our debate series &amp; the Tark system, viz,\n\n * Is the timing of Fri eve to Sunday eve appropriate? Or would you like any changes in timings for better participation?\n\n * Do you prefer it Weekly or Fortnightly? Currently we are doing a bit of both.\n\n * What kind of topics you prefer being asked? Currently we do Politics, Policy, and some non-political topics.\n \n * How many debates must be equal to 1 season? We are thinking 7 to 10 episodes. \n\n * How is the management of the debate? Conduct and enforcement of civil discourse? \n\n * Anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPlease note, we have 3 ways of recruiting the Jury - Jury recruitment threads, special recommendations, Jury recommendation (When a user gets 75 delta in all) - usual rules apply.\n\n# D. Looking for new episodic series contributors.\n * Some series are unfinished, so new interested users can pick it up. (drm will bribe you if needed).\n * Perks - Grant flair, appreciation, pinned posts, etc.\n\n# E.

After the success of Mangalyaan, ISRO has now got the courage to be ambitious and now there are a lot of interesting projects. This has only been possible because Indians has encouraged ISRO to go out of their usual routine and take risks to do such ambitious missions.'<br />Author: 'Fdsn'  id: '9zmah2'<br />Score:99<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9zmah2/oc_isro_has_a_lot_of_interesting_missions_planned/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'PewDiePie Vs Tseries Hypocrisy'<br />Body: "I don't buy the argument that it is individual Vs an corporation anymore. I used to watch PewDiePie since 2013, he used to be funny. But, recently all he does is review memes  (initially it was good) . His channel feels like leafy is here, another YouTube channel which shutdown few months back. His video dissing t series was funny, but his fans are taking it way too seriously. T-series comment section is now literally a shit show. Rampant racism from both the sides. Interestingly, Indians were not united, obviously since t-series is not an individual creator but a corporation. Though, recently people are getting united on this front. I see the light in the argument by PewDiePie supporters than an individual creator should be bigger channel than a company, but at the same time I wonder what makes them say. I thought YouTube is for everyone (individual creator as well as corporations). Are the corporations only the one which are subjected to scrutiny and not a individual content creator with over 70mil subscribers? One of the most things that bother me is that this guy never addresses racism amongst his fandom. I mean that guy has a responsibility right? Or is that only for corporations? His actions have consequences. That is why I think most media establishments hate him. Though I don't support misinformation that spread during his fiasco. But he needs to take up some responsibility for his fans spreading hatred. To a gullible Indian first time experiencing YouTube it would feel like it's India Vs the World. \nThis Bob and vagene meme is really giving us bad name in international fora. PewDiePie just aggravated that, he made many claims like t series is subboting, people in India are autosubscribe , etc. But he never addressed that if the claims were true or false. So, there is literally no difference between him and the media which  disses him.

      <li>Title::: "SMASH BRAHMINICAL PATRIARCHY! WHAT DOES THIS EVEN MEAN? Here's how to MAKE SENSE of Twitter's recent visit to India and it's IMPLICATIONS!"<br />Body: 'Everyone is now familiar with twitter\'s recent \'controversy\' involving journalists. The message \'smash brahminical patriarchy\', was ambiguous, but provocative, and people reacted to it based on their interpretations. The question is, **WHY did these journalists pose with that particular message** and what are they trying to accomplish? \n\nSocial media - once the \'wild west\' of the internet - has been in the limelight for the wrong reasons. Recently, the Indian government had taken strong steps to curb misinformation, hate and objectionable content. Its latest warning to twitter, was its strongest yet: [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-warns-twitter-of-strict-action-if-it-fails-to-check-hate-messages/articleshow/66595136.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-warns-twitter-of-strict-action-if-it-fails-to-check-hate-messages/articleshow/66595136.cms) Weeks later, with twitter visiting India, the government strengthened its orders: [https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/social-media-companies-like-facebook-whatsapp-get-fortnightly-meet-summons/articleshow/66721364.cms](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/social-media-companies-like-facebook-whatsapp-get-fortnightly-meet-summons/articleshow/66721364.cms) . Much of this follows a trend of greater regulation coming social media\'s way, as more concrete action is now being taken by a newly informed and empowered justice system: [https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/hc-directs-social-media-platforms-to-remove-weblinks-of-offending-article-against-judge/articleshow/66711729.cms](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/hc-directs-social-media-platforms-to-remove-weblinks-of-offending-article-against-judge/articleshow/66711729.cms) Once precedents are set, the boundaries are clearer, and laws harder to violate. What isn\'t clear however, and very much open to debate, is the definition of "hate" or "objectionable" content. \n\nThis is where the boundary lines continue to remain blurred. In the world of politics, one man\'s freedom fighter is usually another man\'s terrorist. With polarization being the norm, sympathy in the court of public opinion becomes an important factor in swaying votes. With elections coming up in May of 2019, **what the law deems \'permissable\' in the interest of objective enforcement is absolutely crucial.** \n\nThis is where it gets interesting. The last time India had a major election, the opposition Congress party, along with its allies, had been stripped of its credibility. Its figureheads and mouthpieces reduced to a joke. Most worryingly for them, their message was no longer getting through to the public.\n\nIn a world where the battle-lines were redrawn and the terms of engagement had shifted, Congress had fallen behind. In many ways, they\'re still catching up.\n\nFollowing their defeat, they are helplessly watching a "BJP government" having the authority to regulate social media. Their newly built internet presence - in the form of websites, twitter accounts, and \'fact-checkers\' - is coming into the spotlight. **In the build-up to the 2019 election, it is ABSOLUTELY VITAL that they either survive or delay any type of regulation. Greater regulation of social media puts the Congress party\'s future at stake, and their entire electoral campaign at risk.** \n\nIn this context, Barkha Dutt and her accomplices \'posing\' with the head of twitter was very much a cry of helplessness, but **also a stand against regulation**. Their victimhood was crafted specifically for the purpose of persuading twitter to fight the inevitable regulation. They had to convince twitter that any argument they make - even the most provocative ones (like, "SMASH BRAHMINICAL PATRIARCHY!!") - can fall outside the definition of "hate" or "objectionable" language. These messages, they argued, were referencing legitimate campaign issues. Posing with the head of twitter also appeared to be a *fuck-you* to the government, saying *"you cannot regulate us, they are on our side".* \n\nBut about twitter? What is their take on this?\n\nAs per official figures, India\'s presence on twitter is fairly small. While facebook\'s penetration has been significant, twitter has yet to gain mainstream acceptance. In some ways, twitter remains a space exclusive to India\'s elite. \n\nWith that in mind, what is the best course of action for twitter? Damage control was predictable, and the statement re-affirming twitter\'s commitment \'impartiality\' very much expected. \n\nHowever, if left to itself, can twitter take any action? With its user-base in india still minuscule, it is unlikely that they will. Twitter will most likely take a \'hands off\' approach, leaving the door open for more users to register, and will only act when the government demands. \n\nFor conversations to gain traction, there has to be disagreement. For disagreement to exist, you need opposing sides. More arguments and more disagreements **lead to more engagement with the platform**, which is what twitter ultimately wants. With that said, we can comfortably predict that **twitter WILL NOT unilaterally ban anyone on either side** of the political spectrum. \n\nPolitics is a battleground for messages. Whoever controls the message, usually controls the government. With political discourse bound to become nastier in the up-coming months, it will be interesting to see if the battle-lines change.\n\nTL DR:\n\ngovernment is regulating social media\n\ncongress is shitting itself\n\ncongress sends its journalists to protest regulation and convince twitter\n\ntwitter wont do anything on its own unless asked by the government\n\n if you ignored my whole article and skipped to this part, you can lick my balls '<br />Author: 'twatavious'  id: '9yzxwy'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9yzxwy/smash_brahminical_patriarchy_what_does_this_even/</li>

While kidnapping cases of women rose 280% between 2013 and 2017, those of children went up 421% during the five-year period.\n\nExperts reason that the enormous increase in registrations is due to more people coming forward to report crimes now. Earlier, many wouldn’t report due to social stigma related to reporting kidnapping and molestation cases. \n\nEven if that is the case, and the sharp increase is only due to courage to report, this is no small news.

He\'s been accused of promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion and race in a place of worship, insulting religious feelings and creating "public nuisance". He has been charged with an "obscene act in a public place". A protection of ancient monument law has been invoked to charge him with misuse of the Konark temple where he recorded his video. And the information and technology law has been dredged up to charge him with sending offensive messages. At least two of the charges are non-bailable and if found guilty, he could languish in prison for five years.”\n\nThis is a very heavy price to pay for a stupid mistake I would say. He was probably insensitive but he certainly didn’t mean to do any of the offences he has been charged with.

The system was formalized in a series of treaties between the individual rulers and the British crown. The princes had recognized the \'Paramountcy\' of the King Emperor as represented in New Delhi by the Viceroy and ceded to him control of their foreign affairs and defence. They received in return Britain,s guaranteed of their continuing autonomy inside their states\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf all the bizarre and exotic rulers in India "***His Exalted Highness, Most Faithful Ally of the British Crown", the seventh Nizam of Hyderabad was surely the most bizarre,*** Nawab Sir **Mir Osman Ali Khan Siddiqi, Asaf Jah VII** (born **Mir Osman Ali Khan Bahadur**) (6 April 1886 – 24 February 1967), was the last Nizam (or ruler) of the Princely State of Hyderabad and Berar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA devout and learned Moslem, he and an Islamic ruling caste presided over the largest and most populous state in India, an entity of 20 million Hindus and only 3 million Moslems set in the heart of the sub-continent. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Nizam\'s Life**\n\nHe lived in constant dread of being poisoned by some jealous courtier and was followed everywhere by a food taster whom he obliged to share his unvarying diet of cream, sweets, fruits, betel nuts and a nightly bowl of opium. **The Nizam was the only ruler in India entitled to the appellation \'Exalted Highness\',** a distinction conferred on him by a grateful Britain in recognition of his **25 Million Pounds contribution to their war-chest in World War I.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nln 1947, the Nizam **was reputed to be the richest man in the world** and the legends of his wealth were surpassed only by the legends of the avarice with which he sought to hold it intact. He dressed in rumpled cotton pyjamas and ill-formed grey slippers bought in the local market place for a few rupees.\n\nFor 35 years he\'d worn the same soiled, dandruff-encrusted fez. Although he owned a gold service for 100 places, he ate off a tin plate, squatting on a mat in his bedroom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Stingyness of th Nizam***\n\nSo stingy was he, **he smoked the cigarette buds left behind by his guests.** When a state occasion forced him to put champagne on the princely table, **he saw to it the single bottle he reluctantly set out never got more than three or four places from him**. In 1944 when Wavell was arriving for a viceregal visit, the Nizam cabled Delhi enquiring whether, in view of its high wartime cost, the Viceroy really insisted on being served champagne. Once a week, after Sunday service\' the English Resident came to call. Faithfully a retainer appeared with a tray containing a cup of tea, a biscuit and a cigarette for the Nizam and his guest. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne Sunday, the Resident arrived unannounced with a particularly distinguished visitor. The Nizam whispered to his servant who returned to offer the visitor **a second tray on which had been set one cup of tea\' one biscuit and one cigarette**. In most states, it was the custom once a year for the nobles to make their prince a symbolic offering of a gold piece which the ruler touched, then returned to its owner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Hyderabad, there was nothing symbolic about the offering. **The Nizam grabbed each gold piece and dropped it into a paper bag beside his throne.** \n\n&gt;On one occasion when one fell, he was on his hands and knees like a shot, racing its owner along the floor to the rolling coin. \n\nIndeed, so miserly was the Nizam that when his doctor arrived from Bombay **to give him an electro\'cardiogram, he couldn\'t make his machine work.** The doctor finally discovered why. In **order to save on his electricity bill, the Nizam had cut back the palace\'s current: no machine could function properly on it.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **Wealth of Nizam**\n\nThe Nizam\'s bedroom looked like a slum hut, its furnishings consisting of a battered bed and table, three kitchen chairs, overflowing ashtrays and waste-paper baskets emptied once a year on the Nizam\'s birthday. His office was littered with stacks of dusty state archives, its ceiling a forest of cobwebs. Yet tucked into the corners of that palace was a fortune beyond counting. \n\nIn one drawer of the Nizam\'s desk, wrapped in an old newspaper, **was the Jacob diamond, a bauble size of a lime, 280 sparkling, precious carats. The Nizam used it as a paper-weight.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the overgrown garden was a convoy of dozens of t**rucks mired in mud up to their axles contained loads of solid gold ingots.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The Nizam\'s jewels, a collection so enormous it was said the pearls alone would cover all the pavements of Piccadilly Circus, were spilled like coals in a scuttle on the floors of his cellars; sapphires, emeralds, rubies, diamonds, mingled in indiscriminate heaps. He had well over two million pounds in cash - sterling, rupees wrapped in old newspapers, stuck in dusty corners of the palace\'s basement and attic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere they earned a kind of negative interest from the jaws of the rats who annually gnawed their way through thousands of pounds of the Nizam\'s fortune. The Nizam had a sizeable army equipped with heavy artillery and aircraft. Indeed, he had every possible requirement for independence except two - a seaport and the support of  his people.\n\nHis overwhelmingly Hindu population detested the Moslem minority which ruled them. Nonetheless, there was no question about the future that the miserly, slightly demented ruler of a state half the size of France foresaw for himself.\n\n\'At last,\'he shouted, leaping from his chair when Sir Conrad Corfield had informed him of Britain\'s decision to leave India by June 1948,\'I shall be free.\'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe ruled Hyderabad between 1911 and 1948, until it was annexed into India by the Iron Man "Sardar Patel.

Well, I don\'t know the mods so I didn\'t take that argument. But I decided to check out this sub anyway.\n\nAnd.... Well, I see a lot of posts that go into how the media/public/intellectuals are targeting Hinduism. Like this one post that talks about how the media only cares about pollution during Diwali and that no one bats an eye when someone burns crackers during New Year.\n\nI just wanted to say that... Well, it\'s not intentional. Sure, Delhi has bad air quality all year round. But the issue always gets highlighted during Diwali and when farmers burn their stubble because *the pollution is much more visible*. It has nothing at all to do with Diwali being targeted. \n\nI think we should be proud of Hinduism that we\'re able to self-introspect our actions. When someone criticises a Hindu practice, they\'re not hatching an anti-Hindu campaign. \n\nPlease don\'t draw parallels with the practices of other religions. If you\'re going to constantly keep asking "What about New Year?" whenever the issue of burning crackers during Diwali, there is no debate. And then the rest of the lot can ask "What about Diwali?" when someone asks not to burn crackers during New Year. Yeah, good luck at that.\n\nFrom a Hindu.'<br />Author: 'worldgovernment'  id: '9ws1fq'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9ws1fq/theres_no_conspiracy_against_diwali_or_hinduism/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'With Rafale and allegations of crony capitalism being thrown around, YSK about the crazy heights of thuggery and crony capitalism that birthed Maruti'<br />Body: "all starts with Maa ka Ladla, Sanjay aka Sterilization king Gandhi returning back home from a 3 year internship stint at Rolls Royce in the UK. Even this must have been only because of Maa ka influence because, in keeping with family tradition he never completed college. In case you are wondering, Indira, Sanjay, Rajiv, Sonia all at some point in their life joined some college or uni, but never completed it. In Rajiv and Sanjay's case, they just sucked at studies. Indira, was supposedly a very good student, but ill health came in her way. Anyways, moving back to the topic, Sanjay bhaiya returns from the UK, all full of ideas for a People's Car!\n\nNow, the small hitch is, Indira had pretty much nationalised everything, and the few private companies left, like Hindustan automobiles or Premier automobiles or even Bajaj of the Chetak fame had stringent licensing norms, and buying even a chetak meant at least a year in queue after paying the money...if you were lucky. No matter, what Ladla wants, he gets.\n\nIn 1971, with ZERO experience in this field, no degree, no nothing, the GoI awarded a contract to this unknown entity to produce 50k cars (when even as late as 1991, India had a total car sales of some 100,000, in the 70's, this was around 30k units per year). No tender, no competition...nothing! Cronyism max...and it is just the start.\n\nThe moment this was done, everybody had to fall head over heels to satisfy the Prince. So, the Congress CM of Haryana promptly offered all the land the Prince wanted. But it was in a sad place in Haryana...our Prince had his eyes set on prime farm land and land belonging to the ordinance factory....Land Acquisition bill you say? Naw, rules didn't apply to his empress son. Land was acquired at dirt cheap prices, the army made to give up its land and the factory was put up.\n\nNow, they offered a prototype for testing...it failed all the tests, but no matter, safety mafety....the contract was upheld!\n\nBad? It gets worse.\n\nIndustrialists were literally extorted into buying shares of this company...if you didn't, you had family members thrown into jail till you paid up. Listing rules for the share market were outright broken to allow special provisions to this company. If you had applied to be a dealer, you were shit out of luck as you were threatened to buy shares (literally using goons and threat of violence) in the company...or else. Even if you were not applying to be a dealer, you were fucked. Some random guy, applying with the Harayana Govt to buy some land...was told that he had to buy shares in the company, or kiss his licenses good bye...he got the shares!\n\nBusinessmen who complained...including to the then Minister of state for finance, our Hon President Mr Mukherjee (who did nothing) were then arrested under various acts, including the infamous MISA. Yes, if you protested, you saw jail time bitch!\n\nCement, Iron and Steel procured to build the complex (strict quotas were in place for anybody without the Gandhi surname) were then promptly resold in the market for a profit, and more quotas kept getting alloted to this company.\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg. Many share holders listed never existed, huge monies were laundered through this sham of a company, many of Sanjay Gandhi's official documentation and requests were never dated or signed. Minutes of shareholder meets either were manipulated or didn't exist at all....it boggles the mind what the Gandhi family could do and still can tbh in its solo, singleminded quest for power and money.\n\nAfter the Janata Gov took power, they rightfully scrapped this company, established a commission, whose report you can read here.\n\nThis is why when Rahul Gandhi or his supporters talk about crony capitalism, I launch a full blown belly laugh! Indira, Sanjay, Rajiv (our man was the lead negotiator for an aircraft fighter deal...talk about being brazen), Sonia (Augusta) are all the biggest crony capitalists of them all."<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: '9wlgna'<br />Score:48<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9wlgna/with_rafale_and_allegations_of_crony_capitalism/</li>

Connecting people to the internet and getting them "jobs" shouldn\'t be an end goal in and of itself. \n\nI\'d like to think that india can aspire to be something more than just a slave colony for the rest of the world, but slavery generally doesn\'t happen without some complicity. As it stands, outsiders don\'t have to try very hard to shape Indian society in their vision. Independent india exists in name only. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the record,\n\nI\'m not in favor of \'banning\' pro-western, pro-colonization ideas. But there should be some balance in the debate. Every article in favor of colonization should be countered by an article in favor of self-sufficiency and protectionism. Politics is a battle of opinions, the winning side is usually the opinion heard more often. BJP mobilized its online support base on social media, now the secularists are playing the same game: you can laugh at the inevitable demise NDTV and the growing irrelevance of barkha and rajdeep, but you still have to maintain your advantage. \n\nNo wonder congress is battling for influence at twitter and facebook. At the very least, BJP should push its own platforms while maintaining its base. They should be regulating every foreign funded media institution in india. \n\nAs much as i hate the communists, they\'re the only political group in india principled enough to not be guided by foreign money.

From sites in North East to deep down south.Delhi centric view is gone.\n\nPics - [https://twitter.com/OnlyNakedTruth/status/1061524088361902081](https://twitter.com/OnlyNakedTruth/status/1061524088361902081)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. There is no mention of "Aryan Invasion" theory. When talking about the collapse of Harrapa they leave the options open. So the dark age here is left for the people judge, there is an excellent book on how the dark age is preserved since the towns and life style in any Harappan city found is so much similar to the modern India. Take any rural Indian to the Harappan excavated sites and he will feel at home. For more on this must read "Lost river Saraswati"\n\nPics - [https://twitter.com/OnlyNakedTruth/status/1061524111728377856](https://twitter.com/OnlyNakedTruth/status/1061524111728377856)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Finally Indian cities from Sindhu Saraswati civilization make appearance like **Rakhigarhi , Kalibangan**. More focus on **Dholavira**  No usage of "Indus valley civilization". But disappointingly no mention of "Sindhu Saraswati civilization" term either.\n\nPics - [https://twitter.com/OnlyNakedTruth/status/1061524133106733056](https://twitter.com/OnlyNakedTruth/status/1061524133106733056)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. Disappointingly Varna system still gets an unfair portrayal. But the term Manusmriti is gone. Small victories.\n\nPics -  [https://twitter.com/OnlyNakedTruth/status/1061524161518952448](https://twitter.com/OnlyNakedTruth/status/1061524161518952448)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. Mathura gets a far better treatment. Also mentioned are "Painted  Grayware" pottery that linked transition of Harappan and Gangetic  civilization.\n\nPics - [https://twitter.com/OnlyNakedTruth/status/1061524179625816064](https://twitter.com/OnlyNakedTruth/status/1061524179625816064)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6.

Too much focus on Ashoka, Buddhism. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat about you like to see more in the history books ? I would like to see more local histories from every region especially those where small kingdoms fought off the Islamic invaders. More focus on Vijayanagara , the magnificent empire. More on the Badami Chalukyas esp Vikramaditya II, more about Cholas, Pandyan Dynasty.

Who cares about stress on environment due to meat industry ! Food : Home delivered in plastic containers. Thrown away the same day. Milk, Bought in plastic bags.\n\n\n\n4. Transport : Mostly more polluting diesel engined cars bought because it is cheaper than petrol. Minimal use of public transport. Because walking and public transport is for poor.\n\n\n\n5. Love for trees : Never planted a tree whole life. Paid bribes to govt departments just to cut down the trees in front of house to get extra space for parking. Also because trees shed too many leaves and have to pay sweeper extra to remove those.\n\n\n\n6. Plants at home: Almost all fake, made of plastic.

A must read, and to ponder about...\n\n**" What is your view on the saying "Congress has looted India for 70 years?"**\n\nIt isn\'t the looting of wealth that bothers me so much as the sheer fact that the Congress merely replaced the Brits in some ways - they just became masters of the same, broken, weak people, who were simply willing to suck up to authority. Nobody gave India confidence! This is the part that bothers me so much, especially with MK Gandhi\'s style of \'winning\' us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral ground.\n\nSo, India has grown up as an apologetic impotent nation, where our children are taught to revere impractical, passive, cowardly notions like non-violence, when everything in nature tells us to fight to survive. Of course I know the philosophy of not fighting because of being strong. But this comes from mastery, not shamelessly bowing to masters!\n\nSo, we saw a change of guard. The Brits went, and new masters came in the form of the Congress Party. Hierarchies remained, the class system remained, and subservience remained. Where the heck did all the dynamism go?\n\nThen we were thrown into a socialist mindset, people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered. We got protectionist policies, that prevented prosperity and competition, throwing us away from a path of a meritocracy. Hindustan Motors was started around the same time as Toyota, and Tata Steel started around the same time as Nippon Steel. Nippon Steel produces around five times as much as Tata Steel without native resources of ore. No need to talk about Hindustan Motors and Toyota. Japan coming out of twin nuclear strikes was devastated way more than India under the Brits. Do we need to compare how different the growth paths of these two nations have been?\n\nOnly when thousands died did we start the Green Revolution. Only when China attacked us did we realize we need to become militarily stronger. Only with our backs against the wall, did India liberalize its economy. Under the Congress, every move we have made towards any kind of development has come under inevitable circumstances, with our backs against the wall.\n\nIndia was never allowed to be truly independent, strong, and proud of its people\'s full potential. No wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere. This is the loot I would feel most wronged by - denying India its best talents and minds, because we didn\'t create the conditions for dignified development.\n\nIncredibly, the immense sacrifices of our fighting heroes were also swept aside under this avalanche of worship for Gandhiji. Why? So that the Brits would feel good? The Congress party was reporting to British Intelligence for 5 years after we became an independent country, about Subhash Bose\'s family\'s movements. During a criminal probe of the Bofors scandal, the Congress External Affairs minister delivered a letter to a foreign body to deny evidence and cooperation to an Indian investigating agency. Years later, a whole bunch of Congress members and their cronies used the letterhead of the Indian Parliament to petition the USA to not issue a visa to Narendra Modi, the man who would become Prime Minister. It is these bunch of ass lickers that I want to hang or burn over a slow fire.\n\nThe Congress has a clear obsession with white people and a need to constantly please them. When Hillary Clinton asked India to wean itself off Iranian oil, the Congress government promptly obliged, even though Iran and India have been close friends for a long time. No surprise then that pasta aunty from Italy is their supremo. Think she would have got the same respect if she had been a Nigerian black woman? I don\'t think so. That\'s how deeply ingrained the slave mentality is in the ranks of the Congress.\n\nIt is the loot of India\'s pride, dignity, dynamism and die hard spirit that bothers me much much more than the loot of wealth. This country produced enough wealth to support the British Empire for 200 years. It can easily produce much more to ensure prosperity, health and well being for its own people. This is an abundant, powerful country, that has been prevented from being a developed, forward thinking, awesome nation that could by now have been an example for the world.\n\nIf India has been a weak, apologetic nation for so long, it\'s precisely because of the Congress. Why do we have to put up with these weasels and the fools who are aligning with them? I could even tolerate a ruthless, despotic, dictatorial mindset. It is this slimy, backstabbing, self serving Lutyens mindset that really irks me. I would give anything to destroy this smugness, decimate it, and put it firmly behind us.\n\nThe economic loot is nothing compared to this, but we will bloody well make them pay for all of it.

You have to register with a website.\n2. You have to submit your loan application.\n3. **You have to pay an application processing fee of ₹1000 + tax.**\n4. You will immediately receive a "letter of approval" by email.\n5. Then the bank will call you and ask you to submit documents.\n6.

How can Capitaworld sanction a loan and tag the bank? What is their locus standi? What authority? Quite simply, the sanction doesn’t mean a scrap of tissue paper.

This guy was so brilliant that he made some no name prince defeat the powerful Nanda dynasty of Magadha empire, the empire which scared off Alexander. The Mauryans were a very strong military, notoriously famous for torture, had an iron grip over the army, ruthlessly annexed the Mahajanapadas and their army one by one and crushed many rebellions, though Ashoka later embraced peace and converted to Buddhism. Hence they were so successful. One thing about Indian empires were that they were so rich and self-sufficient, they didn't bother to invade other neighboring non-Indian empires (most of them). Adding to that there were many geographical barriers.\n\nAs to why other Indian empires didn't manage the feat if the Mauryans, there is theory that every 200 years, a strong king emerges and unites almost all of the Indian subcontinent. In between, India would be fragmented. Let's see how this happened one by one and what factors made these kings fail to achieve what the Mauryans did.\n\n\u200b\n\n321-185 BC - The rule of the powerful Mauryans. As discussed above, the first three kings were very powerful and later kings were weak. The empire fell in 185 BC.\n\nAfter this, the Shunga empire was established by Pushyamitra Shunga. He was the military general of the last Mauryan emperor. Seeing Hinduism's decline under the Mauryans and fearing it's fall, he assassinated Brihadratha Maurya during a military review and proclaimed himself king. As to why the Shungas couldn't conquer the whole of India, the powerful Sathavahanas emerged from south India, the Indo-Scythians in the west and the militarily strong Mahameghavahana dynasty started in Kalinga (modern day Odisha, though a small and forested area , the people from kalingas were known for military strength).\n\n\u200b\n\nFast forward \\~200 years\n\n\u200b\n\n127-150 AD - The Kushanas under Kanishka I made strong inroads to India, conquering most of the north and north west India. His expansion was halted by the strong ruler of the Sathavahana dynasty, Gautamiputra Satakarni. Also numerous Satraps (small kingdoms) emerged all over India.\n\n\u200b\n\nFast forward \\~200 years\n\n\u200b\n\n375-415 AD - The Gupta empire consolidated power throughout India under the military expert Samudragupta. He was so powerful that he never lost a battle. As to why the Guptas didn't expand deep into the south, the Vatakatas, the Gangas and the Tamil kingdoms of Cholas and Padyas gave strong opposition. The later guptas (not related to the Gupta empire) were weak and India was fragmented.\n\n\u200b\n\nFast forward \\~200 years\n\n\u200b\n\n590-647 AD - The Pushyabhuti dynasty under the strong ruler Harsha Vardhana united the whole of North India. He faced strong opposition from Pulakeshi II of Badami Chalukyas. Pulakesi defeated Harsha in a battle and halted his southern expansion. During Pulakeshi's rule, the Chalukyas covered almost all of South and Harsha covered North.\n\n\u200b\n\nFast forward \\~200 years\n\n\u200b\n\n850-1000 AD - This is a unique timeline in Indian history. Three strong empires, The Palas of east, the Gurjara pratiharas from west and the Rashtrakutas from south covered all of India and were constantly fighting each other for control of India. All the three empires met at Kannauj. It is commonly referred to as the tripartite struggle. Even though they were fighting each other, the allied together to defeat the Arabs numerous times and halted their expansion into India. The Arabs suffered multiple defeats and gave up the idea of Ghazwa-e-hind (Islamisation of India). After the fall of these three great empires, India was fragmented again and faced constant invasions from islamised Afghans.\n\n\u200b\n\nFast forward \\~200 years\n\n\u200b\n\n1200-1300 AD - This is a turning point in Indian history. For the first time, a native Indian ruler Prithviraj Chauhan was tricked and defeated by the muslim ruler Muhmmed Ghori who established the first muslim rule in India based in Delhi. Many dynasties ruled from Delhi, but during their rule, the Cholas, the Golcondas gave strong opposition. Turko-Indian ruler Mohammed bin Tughlaq expanded till south. After him, smaller dynasties ruled from Delhi.\n\n\u200b\n\nFast forward \\~200 years\n\n\u200b\n\n1527-1717 AD - The Mughal empire. Established by Uzbek ruler Babur and later ruled by many strong kings like Akbar and Aurangzeb. During the early rule of the the Mughals, the south was untouchable because the rich and strong Vijayanagara empire. During the rule of Aurangzeb, the Marathas under Shivaji gave too much trouble. After the death of Aurangzeb, the empire was disintegrated and the Marathas ended their dominance.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn mid 1700s, the Marathas went on a winning spree from ruling small fractions to covering almost all of India within 30 years. The Marathas could have conquered all of India, but their over-ambition to conquer all of India in a very short span of time did cost them dear. They faced opposition from the Durranis, Tipu of Mysore, and the British. Their empire was slowly disintegrated and finally ended by the British.\n\n\u200b\n\nlate 1700s-1947 - The infamous rule of the British. By various tactics, deceit, allying with kingdoms, absurd rules and many battles, they conquered all of India and beyond. Finally India was independent in 1947.\n\n\u200b\n\nPS: Pre-Mauryan Emperors during Vedic times like Bharata and Yudhistira conquered all of India (disputed).\n\nPPS: I posted this answer to a question in ask historians, thought this would fit here."<br />Author: 'KillerN108'  id: '9tvn27'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9tvn27/the_reason_mauryans_were_the_only_indian_rules_to/</li>

Our culture is the reason why India is considered Vishwa Guru by all the countries. Anybody who has been to a foreign country knows how depraved and backwards their culture still is. My question is: Why has the West not been able to catch up with India in terms of cultural advancement? Yoga, Vegan food, Hare Krishna movement, etc are all popular revolutions that were started in the last century as an attempt to bring up the west upto the mark, but there is still a lot they are lacking as is evident if you even read  international news.

Under British Raj,  India was the most powerful nation on  Earth. Yes, what made India powerful before 1947?   Indian Rupee was at Par with the US dollar. Indians could buy $1 for Rs..2.30 pice/paisa. No Indians worked as slaves in the Arab Gulf, Dubai, Qatar, Kuwait or in Saudi. When Britain kicked out by the Nehru Raj on August 15, 1947,  the next day, the whole Indian economy and the Rupee collapsed. The final blow came to all Indians who were employed by British/US companies Nehru asked all White Managers and owners to get out, no compensation paid, not even one rupee, taken by force, and handed to Nehru's friends. By end of August 30, 1947, the Indian was not worth the paper it was printed. $1 was sold at Rs. 15, and within a year Rs 30 would buy $1 dollar. Those who wanted to go abroad were allowed to buy only $7. Secondly,  the biggest mistake by Nehru and Gandhi was to divide part of India to give to Muslim as Pakistan on a golden plate who declared war on Indians Hindus, where over a million were slaughtered. The biggest joke by Gandhi to Indians all should spin the wheel to make Khadi threads to become an economic power. Ha ha ha ha ha. Today millions are working as slaves who send millions back to India. And guess what? Modi buys Russian S-400 Missiles for $5 billion to defend against Pakistan and China.  One India a powerful country without enemies, now India has enemy self-created by Indian politicians, paid by Indians working as slaves abroad.  Can you believe it? India is the only country on earth is at war, non-stop for 70 years, and going on for the next 70 years till 2147.\ufeff"<br />Author: 'lisa48204702'  id: '9t0xl4'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9t0xl4/this_message_is_to_all_indians_who_were_fooled_by/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Are Rakshashas demons and personification of evil? Discuss'<br />Body: '  \n\nI was in an interesting exchange in /r/kerala recently and figured would compile the arguments here as well, makes for good discussion.\n\nFor those who don’t know, there is a strong narrative in Tamil Nadu (amongst the Periyarite and Kazhagam circles) and Kerala that Rakshasas were dravidians and Devas Aryans. That all Hindu texts demonise the Rakshasas / Dravidians as evil and the Devas / Aryans as good. That Ravana was actually a Dravidian ruler as was a Mahabali and “Brahmins” subjugated them.\n\nIs that really the case? What do our scriptures really say about Asuras and Devas?\n\nWe must first understand that in Hindu scripture, there is no clear binary good or bad (and that imo is a deep structural flaw, when faced with the onslaught of the predatory Abrahamic faiths). There is no pure evil and pure virtue. This is a very Abrahamic construct and done to ensure propagation. The threat is made explicit. Follow our faith and get rewarded with pure virtue and goodness, abandon (or don’t) follow our faith and you are pure evil, in the employ of Satan (who is the personification of evil) and will burn in the hellfires.\n\nHindu and Dharmic scriptures to a certain extent (Buddhism does have a slightly more binary concept than Hinduism, and Jainisim lesser than Hinduism even), do not have this binary. In fact they, like so many other Eastern philosophies have a duality in all individuals. So good and evil are consubtantial (like the Father, son and the Holy Ghost). Every human, deva or Asura possess one of the three gunas – Sattva (goodness), Rajas (the driving force and is neither good or bad, balance amongst the three gunas) and Tamas (dark forces, destructive and agents of chaos).\n\nHindu philosophy is explicitly clear in this. The Gods are exempt from having any guna (more on this in just a bit), but every other living being in this plane, be it the devas, asuras, humans, yakshas etc have all 3 gunas. You are defined by the balance of these three. So if you are “evil”, you might have a lot more of Tamas and very little Sattva. If you are an average human, you will have a combination of all 3 etc etc.\n\nTake Mahabali, Ravana or Duryodhana for instance. They are described as being gifted and benevolent rulers. Loved by their subjects. The vaishnavite texts explicitly state that after being vanquished by Mahabali fairly in war, Indra approached Vishnu for power and boons to overthrow him. Vishnu rejected these requests because Mahabali had conquered the three lands freely but did agree to test the extent of his devotion to Vishnu and thus the Vamana avataram. Likewise, an Indra has committed many a wrong, say lusting after women and being punished by having his entire body replaced by vaginas for instance. When he was lusting after another woman, a married woman no less, he was an Asura, his Tamas side overrode his Sattva side and his Rajas pushed him to action. Even the gods who have no gunas have been driven to ‘wrong’, impulsive actions with the only difference being they have the power to somehow undo it, the rest of us cannot.\n\nAccording to the Bhagavad Gita (16.6-16.7), all beings in the universe have both the divine qualities (daivi sampad) and the demonic qualities (asuri sampad) within each\n\nIt is not just consubtantiality but balance that Hindu philosophy strives for. Balance in everything and everything in balance. \n\nThe balance that is key to Eastern thought continues in the Bhagwat Purana where it is said that\'s in an age when Rajas is dominant (sattva is the purest quality, rajas is good and tamas impure), the gods including Mahavishnu will grant the wishes of the Asuras to bring in balance. That Vishnu being Atman he doesn\'t have any of the gunas but he is Keen to reduce the ascendancy of any particular guna and balance all 3 out.\n\nAsura also means mighty. Many kings and sages have been referred to as Asura in Vedic texts. Besides even the Asuras were divided into the Adityas (progeny of Aditi) and Danavana (the evil ones). Even devas were referred to as Asura, including  Shiva and Indra.\n\nThe Gita defines the Asura as someone suffering from (chapter 16)\n\n\\&gt; Arrogance, pride, anger, conceit, harshness and ignorance-\n\nThe devas including Indra, Shiva or Vishnu have at one point or the other suffered these and are thus Asuras.\n\nThe devas are defined as,\n\n\\&gt; Fearlessness, purification of one\'s existence, cultivation of spiritual knowledge, charity, self-control, performance of sacrifice, study of the Vedas, austerity and simplicity; nonviolence, truthfulness, freedom from anger; renunciation, tranquility, aversion to faultfinding, compassion and freedom from covetousness; gentleness, modesty and steady determination; vigor, forgiveness, fortitude, cleanliness, freedom from envy and the passion for honour\n\nA Mahabali would qualify as a Deva in this list. A Ravana would tick off all the boxes on this list bar one, covetousness. A Rama or Krishna would qualify as both an Asura and a Deva as would Ravana or Duryodhana.\n\nThis is the duality that someone steeped in Abrahamic binaries can’t even begin to comprehend and they reduce it to,\n\nDeva = Brahmin = Good.\n\nAsura = Demon / evil = bad.\n\nAnanda Kentish Coomaraswamy says it best,\n\n\\&gt;Although distinct and opposite in operation they are consubstantiatial, their distinction being a matter not of essence but of orientation, revolution or transformation. The Asura is potentially a deva and the Deva is potentially an Asura and by nature both posses these qualities.\n\nSo many such instances abound.\n\nShurkacharya (the preceptor of the Asuras) was born of Shiva\'s body, divided his own body into two, becoming a source of knowledge for both the Asuras and devas. He is the mentor of Bheeshma and married a goddess.\n\nIn a binary world, by virtue of being the chief guide for the "Demons", even bringing them back from the dead constantly, he must be the worst of all demons but Hindu philosophy doesn\'t work that way.\n\nThe story of Andhaka is particularly enlightening,\n\nBorn to Shiva, a Asura by birth, he became a Deva by virtue of his accomplishments, lusts after Parvati, fights a long war, gets killed and then becomes the chief of Shiva\'s Ganas!\n\nSo was he a demon? A god?\n\nAnd not to forget, in every single instance, the scriptures and myths say that all these so called evil “demon” kings and rulers attained swarkaloka, something not possible in the binary of Abrahamic thought – can you imagine idk Satan reaching heaven?\n\nThis entire binary of good aryans and evil Dravidians is a false narrative pushed to further the north south divide. None of the Sangam era literature, later Chola or even Vijayanagar era literature notice or write about such a divide. This is new and an artificial one that started in Tamil Nadu sometime in the late 1800’s and picked up speed under the Periyarite movement and has since then been perpetuated constantly.\n\nSources are general reading and also Wiki.

      <li>Title::: 'I love dark complexioned women.'<br />Body: "About an hour I was going shopping when I spotted a serious 7.5/10 thicc dalit goddess walking back from class. That girl was something else. She had chocolate brown skin, that shone in the afternoon Delhi sun. Her body gave off a vibrancy that can only come from years of oppression heaped upon you by your upper caste colonisers. She wore a tight, dark burgundy bodycon dress that stuck to her thick thighs and revealed more than it showed. Her breasts were a work of art, perfect little globes that whispered seductive promises to quench the thirstiest of men, with rivers of milk that would never run dry no matter how long you suckled on them.\n\nWatching her hips sway from side to side as she walked down was a moment of pure bliss. She inspired primal lust, in corners of my heart I had no idea existed. I was so taken by those curves that I decided to follow her to her home. She caught me following her, glanced at me a couple times and then quickly walked off into an alley, a shortcut I wager. I think it was my raging erection that scared her, but I can't say for sure.\n\nThat was the moment when I realised, I've had it with all these gori chitti Punjabi kudis. They are dime a dozen and most of them are obnoxious basic bitches anyways. Dark skinned girl, OTOH, are interesting, and generally aren't completely vapid since they aren't put on a pedestal since the age of 10. They aren't assumed to be beautiful and hence they usually put more effort into dressing well. They know how to groom and as a result, often look hotter than a dumb but fair cunt. I don't want a fair skinned bride anymore. I want to be BLACKED.\n\nCalling it now. The future is chocolate.

      <li>Title::: 'Your primer for just wtf is happening in TN politics - spoiler alert? Tis a gigantic cluster fuck.'<br />Body: '  If you like electoral shenanigans, if you like political wrangling and follow it like a sport? You are in luck, grab a seat, get yourself a large tub of butter popcorn and settle down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you might be aware, once Jayalalitha died, the Sasikala faction lead by T T V Dinakaran (she was in jail remember) mounted a coup of sorts, but eventually it failed. However, 18 rebel MLA’s switched sides, maybe prematurely? We don’t know, but they did switch to the TTV faction and the speaker, Dhanapal suspended them under the anti defection act. The suspension was then upheld today by the Madras high court as constitutional and valid. So why is all of this important?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSimple majority in the 232 member house is 117 seats. The AIADMK won 134 seats, but 18 are now suspended rebels, this takes their tally down to 116, 2 short of a majority. The DMK coalition is at 88 iirc and well, they are a lot short of the majority mark. In addition to the 18 seats, 2 more seats are vacant, caused by the death of M Karunanidhi and a no name MLA not of importance to anyone outside Thiruparangundram (his constituency).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here is how the numbers stack up,\n\n* AIADMK – 116, \n* DMK, 88, \n* rebel MLA’s 18, \n* Cong 8 (lol), \n* others 1 ( am getting my math messed up as the tally is short by 1, but meh! \n* Also Double lol BJP- contested 232, won 0.\n\nBy-elections are due in 20 seats. \n\nTheoretically if the AIADMK lose all (more on that in just a bit), and the TTV faction and DMK eat half each, it leaves the DMK with 98, TTV with 10, AIADMK OPS / EPS faction with 116.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbsolute shit storm. Now, the Cong could ally with AIADMK EPS faction and the alliance will have a comfortable majority, but this is not happening, there was a lot of bad blood behind INC leaders and EPS faction, also EPS faction is backed solidly by Messrs Modi and Shah, so this shotgun marriage ain’t happening. The DMK even if it wins all 20 seats, will still be short of a majority, but here an alliance with the Cong could get them 1 seat short of a majority AND a floor test and a suitcase or two exchanged might just bring down EPS aatchi (regime)but….and you knew there was a but coming, there are complications.\n\nElectoral chances in these 20 seats.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe seats themselves stack up like this, of the 20,\n\n* 7 Seats are in deep south and have been first an AIADMK (under MGR) stronghold and then later it moved to the very ‘capable’ hands of Annan Azhagiri. This region ALSO happens to be the hunting grounds for T T V and is his “kottai” (fort).\n* 1 is also in the south, but it is Tiruvarur and Stalin would have to be as inept in politics as Rahul Gandhi to lose this one – it is akin to Pappu losing Rae Bareli or Amethi. \n* 6 are in north and central TN, usually a DMK strong hold but DMK has not been doing too well there over the past 3 elections, but they definitely stand a strong chance.\n\nThe others are scattered all over, but mostly in the west which are neutral territory but also the sole region the BJP has won anything in TN.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe DMK though is in complete disarray. For all his faults, Karunanidhi was an exceptionally gifted master Chankyan politician who would have been sitting in Fort St George by now as CM if he had been alive and not a vegetable. Stalin though is clearly not his father’s man (Azhagiri has the native cunning, but M K has sidelined him entirely, echoes of the Shiv Sena succession battles?), he is clueless on how to handle this entire scenario that is a gift dropped on his lap. He even restarted the “le Dravida Nadu” and “Hindus suck” rhetoric which even his father had dropped decades ago, but this didn’t stick one bit. He has been prepping for 2019 now, but adopting the Ostrich method for the upcoming and vital 20 seat byelections. His brother still retains a lot of his clout in the south, is still heir to 1,000’s of crores in wealth and is chafing at the bit for having been cut out. He doesn’t have the organisational power (he has no organisation) or the political gravitas his brother still has, but he has 2 things, money, brute force, a definite talent for political manoeuvring and ambition (okay, that is more than two, but who cares) and he might not win a single seat, but can definitely take away a huge chunk of the DMK’s native votebank if he wants to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAIADMK – The very definition of Status quo ante. EPS and OPS drive there, cut some ribbons, drive here and name some baby, go there and give some bicycles but that is it. In this they have also not been helped by the Modi govt as large keystone infra projects (Metro phase 2, Salem eway, Chennai Bangalore Industrial corridor etc)that Jaya had stalled, they gave the green light within months of Amma being rested in her grave in Marina beach, and Modi and co gave them full hope by promising support and how construction will begin in months and it is now 18 months since and literally zilch has materialised on the ground. Aside from these grand projects, they lack the vision to do anything else and just keep blaming centre (right fully) and not doing anything (very bad). There has been complete policy paralysis over the past 18 months now and this is purely the Thompson twins fault.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCong – TOPKEK LOL LMAO\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBJP – TOPKEK LOL LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCaptain Vijaykanth – F\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here we are, a complete shit show waiting, while the opposition parties have made some noise about demanding re-election and EPS / OPS full of bravado “welcomed the verdict and the byelections” basically are sitting on their hands. No one wants to upset this weird, lethargic apple cart. AIADMK are rightly afraid of losing the entire govt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDMK and Stalin are shit scared of not winning even 50% of the seats which would show them up for just how poorly organised they are (RIP one of modern India’s finest Chankya, your son sucks – it is like if Sachin’s son was Suru Nayak or Salil Ankola). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCong, am sure Pappu doesn’t even know where TN is or who or why these 18 MLA’s got disqualified, we have to wait for Cambridge Analytica (or whatever they are called now)to come up with some lame Tweet on TN for Pappu maharaj to vaguely familiarise himself with TN and this situation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBJP? TOPKEK LOL LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a political observer, these are fun times. As a Tamilzh, the past 3 years have been like Maunmohan’s governance in term 2 x 100- We are redefining policy paralysis. Sadly there is no way out at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh, Rajini? The eternal coward has not moved an inch after his “am coming into politics” moment a year ago. Kamalji? He would be lucky if didn’t set a new record in losing deposits unless the people who are tired of this shitstorm and vote for this fair – has happened, many voted for Jaya in term 1 only because she was fair and MGR’s keep – and a posh English speaker in which case,  I hope my kannada bros will give me a visa because am emigrating to Bangalore or if Manoos bros permit, Mumbai.'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: '9rk3xg'<br />Score:65<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9rk3xg/your_primer_for_just_wtf_is_happening_in_tn/</li>

Padminl;\n2. Chitrinf;\n3. Shankhim; and\n4. Hastini.\n\n\nHe then compares them with 4 types of Moksha,\n\n* Padmini, means Sayujyata, also called Khadga-Moksha (Sword-release)  the absorption of man in to the Narayan (godhead)\n\n* Chitrinis as Samipyata Moksha, like those who, having been incarnated as gods, perform manifold and wonderful works.\n\n* Shankhimis as Sanipata-oksha, even as the man who takes the form of Vishnu, \n\n* The Hastini  as Salokata-Moksha, for she is what residence in Vishnu’s heaven is to those of the fourth class who have attributes and properties, shape and form, hands and feet.\n\nHe goes on to elaborate the characteristics of various types of these women,\n\n&gt;* Padmini, or Lotus-woman. Her face is pleasing as the full moon; her body, well clothed with flesh., is soft as the Shiras or mustard-flower; her skin is fine, tender and fair as the yellow lotus, never dark-coloured, though resembling, in the effervescence and purple light of her youth, the cloud about to burst. Her eyes are bright and beautiful as the orbs of the fawn, well-cut, and with reddish corners. Her bosom is hard, full and high; her neck is goodly shaped as the conch-shell, so delicate that the saliva can be seen through it; her nose is straight and lovely, and three folds of wrinkles cross her middle, about the umbilical region. Her Yoni resembles the open lotus-bud, and her Love-seed (Kama-salila, the water of life) is perfumed like the lily which has newly burst. She walks with swanlike gait, and her voice is low and musical as the note of the Kokila-bird; she delights in white raiment, in fine jewels, and in rich dresses. She cats little, sleeps lightly and, being as respectable and religious as she is clever and courteous she is ever anxious to worship the gods, and to enjoy the conversation of Brahmans. Such, then, is the Padmini, or Lotus-woman.\n\n&gt;* The Chitrini, or Art-woman 6, is of the middle size, neither short nor tall, with bee-black hair, thin, round, shell-like neck; tender body; waist lean-girthed as the lion\'s; hard, full breasts; well-turned thighs and heavily made hips. The hair is thin about the Yoni, the Mons Veneris being soft, raised and round. The Kama-salila (love seed) is hot, and has the perfume of honey, producing from its abundance a sound during the venereal rite. Her eyes roll, and her walk is coquettish, like the swing of an elephant, whilst her voice is that of the peacock. She is fond of pleasure and variety; she delights in singing and in every kind of accomplishment, especially the arts manual; her carnal desires, are not strong, and she loves her "pets", parrots, Mainas and other birds. Such is the Chitrini, or Art-woman.\n\n&gt;* The Shankhini, or Conch-woman, is of bilious tempermament, her skin being always hot and tawny, or dark yellow-brown; her body is large, or waist thick, and her breasts small; her head, hands, and feet are thin and long, and she looks out of the corners of her eyes. Her Yoni is ever moist with Kama-salila, which is distinctly salt, and the cleft is covered with thick hair. Her voice is hoarse and harsh, of the bass or contralto type; her gait is precipitate; she eats with moderation and she delights in clothes, flowers and ornaments of red colour. She is subject to fits of amorous passion, which make her head hot and her brain confused, and at the moment of enjoyment, she thrusts her nails into her husband\'s flesh. She is of choleric constitution, hard-hearted, insolent and vicious; irascible, rude and ever addicted to finding fault. Such is the Shankhini, or Conch-woman.\n\n&gt;* The Hastini is short of stature; she has a stout, coarse body, and her skin, if fair, is of a dead white; her hair is tawny, her lips are large; her voice is harsh, choked, and throaty (voix de gorge) and her neck is bent. Her gait is slow, and she walks in a slouching manner; often the toes of one foot are crooked. Her Kama-salila has the savour of the juice which flows in the spring from the elephant\'s temples. She is tardy in the Art of Love, and can be satisfied only by prolonged congress, in fact, the longer the better, but it will never suffice her. She is gluttonous, shameless, and irascible.

Let the world also be enlightened and be clear on this, said Brahma.\n\nOn questioning Durvasa, he replies, Sri Krishna is the ‘naishtika brahmachari’ without doubt. He further says, ‘One who lives where there are no women and observes celibacy, is not a ‘naishtika brahmachari’.\n\nThe one who loves amidst women and is not caught in the sway of desire is in reality a ‘vairagya brahmachari’. Krishna who sings and dances with ten thousand gopis without a sense of ownership remains the ‘parabrahman’.\n\nThe love and grace of the ‘parabrahman’ are the property of all. Krishna regards both cows and gopis alike, irrespective of gender. Some think of him as son, father, mother, friend, lover, guru, deity, etc. for their own bliss.\n\nKrishna lives without carnal desires both in mind, word, and deed, although he is the subject of love and attachment of everyone. He remains like water droplets on a lotus, hence he is the real ‘naishtika brahmachari’.\n\nIn the case of Ayyappan, as with every deity, the relationship (premam) with the devotees is transcendental and pure.

      <li>Title::: "Why it's important to grant women greater representation"<br />Body: "I saw this debate going on and would like to make a general post to reach out to everyone. I am speaking from mine and that of other female colleagues perspective\n\n1. I attended a conference by a lady well established, renowned across the world in her field. She said she was part of hiing committee. while sorting out the applications for interviews, the male colleagues discarded the application of a woman because her husband was working in a metro city nearby and naturally any wife would prefer living with her husband over wanting to work in comparatively smaller town which is 7-8 hrs away from the metro city. When this well established lady saw this she immediately reacted that you can't assume that. You can't reject an application of a woman based upon mere assumptions. If she applied, she is serious enough and we are in no position to decide on her behalf. Eventually the male colleagues agreed and her application was given a fair chance. \n\nNow so many placed don't have senior women, imagine how many women don't even get an opportunity because men considered her priority will be her husband.\n\n2. I had some issues with a very senior man (in his 50s) of our department. I was young, naive and didn't know whome to talk to. I inadvertently ended up conveying it to a guy who was my senior (around 28-30). He was a nice guy, he talked to the female director our department. She called me in her office and listened to everything I had to say. I was soooo afraid of retaliation from him or his friends, she soothed my fears and even took me to the heighest authority to calm me down and tell me that no one will hurt me if I compalint against him. And before leaving I also talked to her that in case the man in question tried to hurt my image to others in my field than she assured me that she will be willing to write to my new employer to disregard his opinion as there was case of sexual harassment against him so his words can be out of maliciousness. None of this would have been possible if there was no female senior member. I would have never been able to talk to a man about what he did and said.\n\n3. We had to face sexism at our work place from you are girls you don't need to work hard, earn enough, take care of your parents or take responsibilities to outright denial of cooperation from a few guys. Over tea we conveyed this casually to one of the senior lady, she was surprised. And next day there was a meeting of entire department (15 men, 1 women the make up of our department) and proposed what can we do to curb it. Finally next week we had a short workshop on gender sensitization.  Now if there were no woman, she wouldn't have shared her experience and we would not have casually conveyed it to her. Since it wasn't direct case of sexual harassment, we were unlikely to go ahead and file a complaint. Not to mention a lady was in better position to understand our problems than a man.\n\nI don't hope to change someone's opinion here but I hope you can at least see it from our (women's) perspective as well."<br />Author: 'I_exist_01'  id: '9q3x72'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9q3x72/why_its_important_to_grant_women_greater/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[The /r/IndiaSpeaks Debate: Non-Political] "Women should be granted greater representation in positions of power for their betterment and to prevent sexual abuse."'<br />Body: '[#The /r/IndiaSpeaks Debate Season 1 - Episode 2.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/457665564861661186/500222406632275978/1bb9a220-5b5e-4f92-bd42-ef2bb76ce5cc_4.png)\n\n##Topic\n\n&gt;# "Women should be granted greater representation in positions of power for their betterment and to prevent sexual abuse of the gender."\n\n&gt;"Women have always held a special position in India via tradition or otherwise.

      <li>Title::: 'Islamic Caste System.'<br />Body: 'Interactions between the oonchi zat (upper caste) and neechi zat (lower caste) are regulated by established patron-client relationships of the jajmani system, the upper castes being referred to as the \'Jajmans\', and the lower caste as \'Kamin\'. Upon contact with a low-caste Muslim, a Muslim of a higher zat can "purify" by taking a short bath, since there are no elaborate rituals for purification.[91] In Bihar state of India, cases have been reported in which the higher caste Muslims have opposed the burials of lower caste Muslims in the same graveyard.\n\nSayyed Jalaluddin Bukhari, also known as Makhdum Jahaniyan-e-Jahangasht, is said to have declared that providing knowledge beyond that of the Quran and the rules of prayers and fasting to the so-called razil (ajlafs) castes is like scattering pearls before swine and dogs! He reportedly insisted that other Muslims should not eat with barbers, washers of corpses, dyers, tanners, cobblers, bow-makers and washermen, besides consumers of alcohol and usurers. Mohammad Ashraf writes in his "Hindustani Maashra Ahd-e-Usta Main" that many medieval Islamic rulers did not allow to low-class people to enter their courts, or if some did they forbade them from opening their mouths because they considered them to be \'impure\'.[88] The scholar Shabbir Ahmad Hakeem quotes from another book by Thanvi called "Masawat-e Bahar-e Shariat", in which Thanvi argues that Muslims should not allow \'Julahas\' (weavers) and \'Nais\' (barbers) to enter Muslims\' homes. In his "Bahishti Zewar" Thanvi claimed that the son of a Sayyed father and a non-Sayyed mother is socially inferior to the child of a Sayyed couple. In his "Imdad ul-Fatawa", Thanvi announced that Sayyeds, Shaikhs, Mughals and Pathans are all \'respectable\' (sharif) communities, and that the oil-presser (Teli) and weaver (Julaha) communities are \'low\' castes (razil aqwam). He claimed that \'nau-Muslims\', non-Arab converts to Islam, cannot be considered the kafaa, for purposes of marriage, of \'established Muslims\' (khandani musalman). Accordingly, he argued, Pathans, being non-Arabs and, therefore, \'nau-Muslims\', are not the kafaa of Sayyeds and Shaikhs, who claim Arab descent, and, so, cannot inter-marry with them. The first president of All India Muslim Personal Law Board and Vice Chancellor of the Deoband madrasa, Maulvi Qari Mohammad Tayyeb Siddiqui, was also supporter of casteism and wrote two books in support in Mufti Usmani\'s book on caste: “Ansab wa Qabail Ka Tafazul” and “Nasb Aur Islam”. True to this tradition of legitimising caste, even today the admission form of the Deoband madrasa has a column that asks for applicants to mention their caste. For many years after it was established, non-ashraf students were not generally admitted to the Deoband madrasa and the practice still continues.'<br />Author: 'KachhaBaniyan'  id: '9pivfb'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9pivfb/islamic_caste_system/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Sabrimala - Do Tourists Have More Rights Than Devotees?'<br />Body: 'The SC treated Sabrimala as if it were a tourist site or a carnival. It isn\'t. It\'s an actively used place of worship, not a decommissioned building from a lost religion.\n\nThis is the equivalent of walking into a Gurudwara without covering your head, or wearing footwear into most places of worship, or going to a mosque visibly drunk and stinking of alcohol, or carrying pork and bacon along with them, or chanting the thousand names of Shiva inside a Mosque.\n\nNo person belonging to that faith would voluntarily do such a thing. The only people who *would* are people who don\'t respect the ground-rules of the site of worship - aka **"Tourists"**. The rights of tourists should **not** supersede the rights of worshipers.\n\nThey are fully within their rights to deny you entry, as it is against the norms of their faith, offensive to actual devotees (male and female, alike), and is behavior incompatible with the basic principles of the deity, religion, and the site itself. \n\nDespite some people\'s attempts to conflate this issue with Triple Talaq ^(Walrus SteamingShit), it\'s simply got nothing to do with it. They are two distinct issues. \n\n&gt;*[Side note: If you see any parallel between them, kindly explain what they are *(in a manner that looks at it in some level of detail and shows some actual comprehension of the nuances, not just your superficial "both have women" schtick)*. If you\'re unable to do that, you do not understand the issue at all, meaning your opinion is invalid, and is thus rejected (with utter disdain).]*\n\nI contest that (unlike Triple Talaq) there is no violation of one\'s individual rights when they are stopped from entering a place of worship based on any of the scenarios I mentioned previously. People do *not* have freedom of movement into any random place they wish, especially when that is a place of worship, but even in other cases where it is not solely a place of worship.\n\nFor example, **Taj Mahal** is closed to **ALL except local Muslims**, every Friday, and they all offer Namaz there. Is this a violation of my right to enter a public site that belongs to all Indians? Will our Secular Courts and Liberals agitate to allow local Hindus to also enter on Fridays? Taj Mahal is a **tomb**, not a mosque. There is a smaller mosque on-site, which is a distinct structure. Will SC and Liberals fight for the right of Hindus who got arrested and were forced to apologize for chanting the names of Shiva in the Taj Mahal lawns (away from the mosque)? Is their right to worship not important, and do they not have the right to believe what they like about "Taj Mahal being a Shiva Mandir"? Why not?\n\nI\'m guessing those supporting women going to Sabrimala will remain silent on these issues.\n\nWomen who worship Ayyappa, do not enter the site, **voluntarily**. They do so out of respect for the deity. Ergo, a woman who enters the site, either does not respect the deity, or is unaware of the norms (about as likely as a Muslim being unaware that Islam places restrictions on consumption of pork), or is intentionally trying to anger the devotees.\n\nAnd inb4 someone tries claiming "No True Scotsman", no it really isn\'t. The practices, rituals, and beliefs of Ayyappa-worshipers are well-recorded. To act against the core tenet of a faith (in this case, centered on the \'brahmachari\' state of Ayyappa - while in the case of Islam, focused on the existence of "only one God whose name is Allah, and Muhammad being his prophet"), means you are not a practicing person of that faith, and that your faith, while probably perfectly valid for you, lies DISTINCT from (and opposed to), the conventional way that faith is practiced.\n\nOne cannot claim to be a devout Catholic while worshiping Satan and desecrating the Bible. One cannot claim to be a religious Muslim while chanting to Zeus and Athena, and munching on bacon in the Mosque. At best, you might be a non-practicing (or \'cultural\') Catholic/Muslims/whatever, or part of some new-age sect that is distinct from the original.\n\nIn either case, you are a tourist at the site, and the devotees rights take precedence over yours.\n\nYou are free to open your own SecularSabrimala, (or Bacon-Eating-Mosque-to-the-Greek-Pantheon+Allah, or Catholics-for-Satan-Church) at any other location, feature the *murti* of "Ayyappa" over there, and invite all the ladies there, if you are so inclined. That will be your own "egalitarian Ayyapan" offshoot movement, and I would wish you all the success in your endeavor. However, the rights of devotees and the Temple management for the original Sabrimala should have remained paramount, in how their temple is used, and what/who is allowed there.\n\n'<br />Author: 'fsm_vs_cthulhu'  id: '9pinls'<br />Score:88<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9pinls/sabrimala_do_tourists_have_more_rights_than/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'What can i do about illegal toll collection on a National Highway?'<br />Body: "I was driving from Chennai to Kolkata on NH 16, and found a toll booth where local villagers are illegally collecting toll, even after it was supposed to be shut down.\n\nThere is a toll booth on NH 16 at Gurapalli. The effective collection date for that booth is 1 April 2018, as per NHAI's site. [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/gOnEERV.jpg). I'm assuming effective collection date means the date where toll collection is supposed to end. \n\nThe toll booths were darkened, and toll was being collected by people standing on the roads. There were no receipts, those turds told us they have never provided receipts at that gate.\n\nThe main reason I think it's a fake toll gate is that there was no collection when I went through the gate a couple days ago. Toll gates don't magically disappear and reappear like that. When we asked for any government issued ID, or a Authorization letter, they told us we had no right to demand anything from them. 10-15 people surrounded us and forced us to pay. We were seriously considering just driving away, but since there were women in the car, we were worried about being chased and didn't do it.\n\nThe emergency contact numbers mentioned on notice boards by the highway are non functional (number switched off). No one picked up when we called Khalikote police station's contact number mentioned on the notice boards 200 metres from the toll booth. Calls to 100 were not going through because 'all routes to this network are busy' from Airtel and Jio. We did lodge a complaint at NHAI's 1033 emergency contact number, but I don't really think anything will come of that.\n\nTwo of my friends also passed through the gate about half an hour later, and they had the same argument with the people collecting. However they went through without paying because they were cops and govt officials.\n\nHow do I stop the fake collection? I have photos of the people who surrounded our car. Is there any way we can lodge complaints against them? Is there any way to make sure this doesn't happen again?"<br />Author: 'no_lungs'  id: '9phivs'<br />Score:21<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9phivs/what_can_i_do_about_illegal_toll_collection_on_a/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Sabarimala case - A unique perspective on why the Supreme court verdict may indirectly cause harm to millions of women, and no one is talking about it. [An Atheist's view]"<br />Body: 'I just want to express a perspective which I have not heard anyone make. That is the only reason I am making this post. \n\nI am an **atheist** and is **politically neutral**, and I am **a stern supporter of equality**. At first glance, this is a very simple case - "Wait what? Why are women not allowed there? This is discrimination. Women are being wronged. This is against equality. Such practises must stop". That was my reaction as well, and I assume any logical person will also reach that conclusion by just reading the the headlines of various news agencies.\n\n \n\nInfact, few years ago, I was also the opinion that everyone should be allowed in this temple and it is not right to deny entry to women, it all changed when I actually travelled around and learned the ground realities.\n\nI will answer this in two parts. First an introduction to give a context to those who don\'t know anything about this temple, and second part will cover my point.\n\n \n\n# Part-1 : Context/Introduction\n\n**For those who don\'t know the context -** This is a very particular temple atop a huge mountain which is surrounded by hundreds of kilometers of forest that contain wild animals such as leopards and tigers. And, the only way up is by walking through all these. Most people will get tired halfway while climbing the mountain. This temple is only open during certain time period in an year, and it remain isolated and abandoned during the rest of the year.\n\nIt was extremely dangerous to visit this temple until about few decades ago because lot of things can go wrong and you could end up dead or injured. Thus, only very disciplined people used to go and that too in huge groups. To establish the discipline, everyone must undertake a 41 day period of discipline before the day the trip starts. This discipline includes wearing only particular type of dark cloths so people around you know that you are undertaking this oath, eating only vegetarian food, respecting everyone assuming there is god inside everyone, not saying bad words or name calling, not lying, not cheating anyone, not drinking alcohol or drugs, not having sex, not wearing footwear, and many more things. Anyone who break this oath of 41 days were denied entry to the group as without discipline people could get killed. Once the 41 day period is over, they literally pack up all their stuff into a small cotton bag, keep it on their head in a particular style and walk along with the group which is guided by people who have visited this place before.\n\nUntil few decades ago, only people troubled with life, or wanting adventure, or people of particular cult used to attempt such a visit, as the possibility that this person returns were uncertain. And, these people in the group have to walk hundreds of kilometers to first reach the forest, then cross the dense forest, then climb about 18 mountains, and then finally reach the temple.\n\nAnd, this temple is not really a "hindu" temple in its actual sense, instead it is a temple of that region, and many people of other religions also devoutly visit it. It was originally the temple of the local tribal folks and the local king of the region, but in recent years it got immensely popular due to its uniqueness and the challenge you have to take up to reach there.\n\nNowadays, due to the advance in technology and development in the nearby region, there is a road leading to the bottom of the final mountain, and all you have to do is to climb that one(which itself is not that easy, but do-able for most people). The danger of wild animals attacking has been almost eliminated with millions of people visiting there during the period it is open.\n\nIn olden times, anyone who is able to accomplish this almost 100 days of disciple required to undertake such an adventure generally gets better in life just due to that and return back as a changed new man. Even today, nearly all of the people who visit this temple take up this 41 day challenge, and some even walk their entire way from their home to this temple and back. The entire thing is more about the journey than about the goal of actually reaching there. In fact, there is nothing in the temple, it is just a tiny room with a statue inside. It used to be a "journey of a lifetime" for the people in the past.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Part 2 - Unique perspective\n\n# \n\nYou see, the majority of the people who visit this temple are extremely poor people who live a very different life than you and me. For these people, they don\'t have anything to look forward in life, and tradition and religion is everything for them.\n\nNow, many of them are not the best mannered men you will find. They are drunkards and wife-beaters. The women in their family suffer greatly due to this with no power to change the situation. So, they advice and convince these men to visit the sabarimala temple as it requires the 41 day rigorous oath of not doing anything bad. Usually the women of neighbouring houses also convince their own husbands or brothers or sons to also go along with them. Because, the men of the neighbourhood are also going, due to the "group thinking effect" most of them agree and take up the oath.\n\nThis changes them from drunkards and wife-beaters to the best behaved men their wives have ever seen. And, while these men are gone, the women get some peace of life for the first time in the year. By the time these people return, the men would have gone through so much discipline that they generally will return as a much better man leaving behind their alcoholism and bad manners at least for the next few months. I have seen this happen in real life and I was really surprised that these muscular all powerful men are really is able to suddenly change so much! How can this drunkard bad mannered guy abruptly leave alcohol/drugs/bad-language, I thought.\n\nMany women of the rural-folks use this as their sole way to make their husbands,brothers or sons to go in the right path. And, indirectly create peace in their own family. None of these women feel they are being discriminated. In fact, they are happy that they can use this excuse to at least attempt to make their men walk in the right path.\n\nNow, if women also start going and the place becomes a tourist site, then these men may start revolting and refuse to go, or they might think "if women can go any day and all my traditions are lost, why should I bother with this rigorous discipline".\n\nThis case was filed not because some women want to go there, but just because they are rich and they can. [Naushad Ahmad Khan](https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/the-sabarimala-verdict-is-anything-but-gender-equality-win/) is the lawyer who filed the case. That is not a women. And, he is also not even from the same region, in fact he lives thousands of kilometers away. So, why file a case like this which no one who actually goes cares for? The rural-folks and the tribal-folks to whom the temple actually belongs are unable to defend themselves against the wealthy educated folks for whom this case is just a means of achieving the fame of activism. \n\nAnd, generally in such cases, court asks the petitioners how this case is related to them and affecting them, but no such question was asked. Also, the case was rushed through, so that it ends before the Chief Justice of India retired on Oct 2nd. Plus, the government of Kerala is said to have not supported the case due to the communist way of life which do not like religions.\n\nWe have hundreds of things we can do with our lives, but for many of these people, this was kinda the only thing they looked upto. Their only trip in their lives. I know many people who have not travelled more than 50 km around their house and the only exception is that they have gone to this temple and few other temples they visit with their family. My friend in college was like that!\n\nThere are millions of temples in India which allow everyone irrespective of their gender without any discrimination whatsoever. There are handful of them which only allow men. There are another handful which only allow women. There are also girls-only-schools and colleges. Why destroy the uniqueness of the few if it makes so many men change their bad behavior and thus help their women make peace in their family?\n\nWeirdly, no one is talking about the viewpoint I presented. Not the lawyers, not he media, nor anyone else. I think the only way you can understand it is by actually travelling around and learning the ground realities.\n\nI am still confused on which side has the upperhand here, so I am neither supporting nor being against it. I just want you guys to make opinions based on details and not based on just media headlines because in many cases, things are not as easy as it seems at first glance.'<br />Author: 'Fdsn'  id: '9ozwfz'<br />Score:31<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9ozwfz/sabarimala_case_a_unique_perspective_on_why_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[nsfw] #metoo fan-fic: This Happened With Me'<br />Body: 'Hi, I\'m a 25 year old webdeveloper and this horrible incident happened to me 5 years ago. In Jan 2013 I had gone to Bangalore with my friend and fellow blogger Aneesh Mukund to a conference and workshop. We were staying in a posh hotel and Aneesh and I had separate rooms to ourselves. It was a Saturday when one of the speakers was the legendary Rocky (his real name is Rakesh Mehra, but he goes by the name Rocky) who is and used to be a big name in the websphere back then. I was really hooked to his speech and found him very charismatic. Aneesh also praised him. Later than night I was sitting in the hotel bar with Aneesh having a few drinks when Rocky came there. He was by himself and looked tired, but I took my chance and said to him, "Hello Sir! I am Loveleen, I have a blog called pyaarkirahi on blogspot, and I\'m a big fan of yours." To my surprise he was very interested in my and asked me many questions about my life and interests. I was feeling excited but I didn\'t realise that my friend Aneesh was feeling left out. Finally Aneesh said to me, "Let\'s go, it\'s getting quite late." But Rocky was still chatting with me so I asked Aneesh to leave and told him that I will soon go to my room after a couple of drinks with Rocky. So Aneesh left me alone with Rocky.\n\nAfter a couple of drinks. Rocky asked me if I would like to join him in his room where he can tell me some of the ideas he had to improve my web presence. I gladly said yes and we went to his room. I was quite drunk at that time and didn\'t realise how much I had had to drink, but once in his room I literally fell down on the bed from tiredness combined with drunkenness and he laid down next to me. We were talking softly looking at the ceiling and I was feeling sleepy. Just then Aneesh sent me a text message asking me if I was okay. I replied back saying that yes I\'m in my room and off to sleep. Then I switched off my phone because I didn\'t want to be disturbed. Rocky was telling me about he had had started his own professional life and the trials and troubles he had been through. While talking he put one of his hands on my thigh and it was then that I realised that my short dress had rolled up while I was lying on the bed and that my panties were visible out of the dress, but I didn\'t want to embarrass myself or Rocky so I ignored his hand and closed my eyes hoping that he will take away his hand and then I will turn and discreetly roll down my dress so that he won\'t know.\n\nBut he kept talking with his hand near my visible panties and I didn\'t say anything even though I was feeling uncomfortable and wanted to roll down my dress to cover up my legs. I didn\'t get a chance and I almost forgot about it as I started to nod off to sleep but then he moved his hand and that woke me up because he had now put his hand directly over my panties, but I pretended to be asleep as I had no idea how to react to this situation and was tired to walk back to my room and moreover I didn\'t want to upset Rocky because I thought that he must have put his hand there by mistake. He was gently brushing his fingers on my pussy from over the panties and I was lying there helpless pretending to be asleep, not knowing what to do. I was a virgin and never had anybody touch me there like this so I was feeling a mixture of fear, excitement and embarrassment. After some time he slid his fingers inside my panties and I was laying in the same posture for the last one hour, my body was starting to hurt and he pushed his fingers on my naked pussy, gently massaging my clitoris. It was during this time that I actually fell asleep and woke up the next morning next to him on his bed. My clothes were still on me and he was still asleep. I got up and quietly left the room without waking him up.\n\nOn Sunday morning I was\tfeeling terribly confused, I wasn\'t even sure if what happened last night was real or a figment of my imagination. Was Rocky really a rapist creep or was it too soon to blame him. I didn\'t tell this to Aneesh even though he kept asking me why I was looking so upset. This was our last night in Bangalore as we were leaving the next morning. I wanted to be sure about Rocky before we left, so I made a plan. This night also I wore a short dress. I even went so far as to shave my pussy (just to reduce my own embarrassment) and in the evening I went to the loo and took off my panties and put them in my purse. After that I was sitting in the bar with Aneesh as on the previous night. And then Rocky came to us as I was expecting him to. This night also I went to his room without telling it to Aneesh, and I was laying on his bed just as the night before but this time I had pulled up my dress myself so that my pussy was just a little bit uncovered in that semi-dark room. Rocky was laying next to me talking to me about something but I wasn\'t paying attention because I was waiting for him to make his move. He again put his hand on my thigh, very near my naked clean shaved pussy and I ignored him and we kept talking. I was aware that the edge of my pussy was visible very near his hand but I don\'t think he knew because he was talking so casually without directly looking in that area. He was gently stroking my naked thigh when I told him that I was feeling sleepy and that I hoped he wouldn\'t mind if I fell asleep on his bed like last night. He said, no problem, be my guest. So again I pretended to fall asleep while he was still speaking about his life while stroking his fingers on the upper edge of my thigh from under my dress.\n\nThis night I wasn\'t drunk, I had only one wine glass, so I was completely conscious and awake unlike the previous night. I was only pretending to be asleep when that creep moved his hand from my thigh to my pussy. I didn\'t move or twitch. So it was true I realised that Rocky had sexually assaulted me last night and was doing it again this night and there was nothing that I could do about it because I was afraid what might happen next. He was freely moving his hand under my dress and between my legs. He put his other hand on my boobs and started to squeeze them gently from over the dress while rubbing my clit with his other hand. I was very scared that I had become wet in my pussy and if he put his fingers inside my vagina he would know that I was only pretending to be asleep and who knows what he would do if he found out. I was scared for my life but I didn\'t say anything and kept my eyes shut. I was suffocating as he put his hand under my bra and started tweezing my nipples with his fingers. I was wet, I couldn\'t help it and his fingers were coming very close to the opening of my vagina which was spread open before him out of my short dress. My nipples were also erect. I heard him moaning softly but he didn\'t not try to wake me up. If he was a gentleman he would have woke me up a long time ago and would have asked for my permission but he didn\'t because he is a creep. The person whom I idolised was falling in front of me and I was sad for him to see him reduced to this pathetic state. At that time I was hoping against hope that Aneesh would walk into the room and free me from the clutches of this demon, but that didn\'t happen, he didn\'t even know where I was and what was happening to me, I had switched off my cellphone and kept it in my purse long before he could even message me to ask if I was okay. How I was hoping at that moment that my phone was still on and he would ring me so that I would be freed from this terrible situation. More than anything I wanted Aneesh to come and rescue me then, I have never longed for Aneesh as I did then.\n\nRocky had pulled out my boobs from my bra and now they were both hanging completely out of my dress. He had also rolled up my dress from my pussy and hips and now it was over my navel and I was completely naked below my waist except for my sandals and my legs were wide open. I hadn\'t even realised when he had spread my legs because my mind was so overloaded with anxiety. He then put his face between my legs and started licking my pussy with his tongue. Thankfully he had still not checked inside my pussy to see how wet I was. If he touched me there now he would think that it was his own saliva that had made my pussy wet because of the licking. He must have licked me there for five minutes straight but it felt like ages as I helplessly laid there. Then he moved over to the top of my body and started pulling sucking my nipples one by one while using one hand to probe inside my wet vagina with two of his fingers at the same time. My vagina was puffy by then because of all the rubbing and licking. I wanted so badly to push him away but I didn\'t want to risk whatever little safety I still had. After doing this for 10 minutes or so he called out my name several times softly, as if to check if I was awake but I was too scared to react and kept my eyes shut pretending to have passed out. He then pulled out his dick and put his erect penis on the opening of my vagina. I wanted to scream, if he had put his penis inside me I would have but he didn\'t. He kept rubbing his penis on the outside of my vagina and kept sucking my nipples. It was a long ordeal as I was going through hell when he finally came all over the outside of my pussy and stomach.\n\nHe then pulled away and left me alone for some time. I was too scared to move and I could feel his wet cum over my body. He went to the bathroom and came back after a few minutes. Then he gently put my boobs back inside my dress and rolled down my dress to cover my pussy, but he didn\'t bother to pull it from behind so my ass was still uncovered. He also didn\'t bother cleaning his cum from my pussy and he went asleep next to me very quickly and started snoring loudly. I was thoroughly disgusted and left the room soon after that. Next day I didn\'t see him again and I have never told this to anyone till now not even to Aneesh who is my best male friend as our friendship has only grown stronger since that weekend. You never know who you can trust in this world and who can turn out to be a predator and there is only so much a woman can do to save her honor. I wish there was something I could do to make this incident disappear from my life. But I was much more naive back then and easily impressed by the status of people. As a grown woman I will never come even close to putting myself in a situation like this again. But can you blame a young girl in early twenties to know about these dangers? Can she really be safe if she is afraid to raise her voice because the society will blame her first without even questioning the man? Is it too late for me to say \\#metoo? Will the society always blame me for going to his room on the next night when I had to do it for my own mental stability? Will Rocky ever be held to account or will he continue preying upon so many girls who still consider him an idol like I did? Help me please!\n\n^(Disclaimer: This post is not meant to hurt anybody\'s feelings or to detrack the #metoo movement in any way.)'<br />Author: '_miss_lovely'  id: '9o1wtm'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9o1wtm/nsfw_metoo_fanfic_this_happened_with_me/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Remembering Alisha Chinai....probably the earliest Bollywood MeTooer'<br />Body: 'Back when the Internet did not exist and Doordarshan was your only source of entertainment, one Gujarati crooner named [Alisha Chinai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisha_Chinai) made a cheesy hit single that launched her career. It was called [Made in India](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvloHsmi_vg) and it was all about her preference of a Viraat/thug Indian man over foreign men.  \n\nReality/Irony/Karma intervened and the musician, a Bollywood heavyweight named Anu Malik (and IDEAL INDIAN MAN) who did the music for the thing, ended up allegedly molesting her. It is unclear when this supposedly happened. If it happened while or before she was shouting "Made in India" then that makes her a hypocrite. Oddly enough, she has made peace with Anu Malik it seems. \n\nWell anyway, the reason why we are talking about this is that she went public with her allegations, a feat unheard of back then.

      <li>Title::: 'A lone western woman tourist’s story (cross post) (unverified)'<br />Body: 'Here is her account about her India tour:\n\nAnd as someone who’s even travelled to Afghanistan, that’s saying a lot.\n\nLet me start with a rough breakdown of my journey:\n\nDay 1 Air India left my bag in Singapore, then let it sit around Delhi airport for 24 hours until after numerous phone calls someone deigned to deliver it to me\n\nDay 2 Bag arrives with most of my things stolen. Air India still refuse to assist me (weeks later)in the matter giving me their “kindly be patient while we work on this bullshit” I just want a reference for my insurance. Wondering Connaught Place, which is FILTHY, I’m accosted by numerous sick and injured kids who beg for money and try to steal from me and men who won’t piss off wanting to take me to the “cottage industry” markets. People are literally shitting on the road.\n\nDay 3 I arrive in Rishikesh to attend a yoga school, the school who I’d paid almost $1000 USD for an upmarket retreat sends me to their “sister school” which is filthy, falling down and has no one else around. I leave and they initially ignore my attempts at contact for a refund, luckily my cc company steps in\n\nDay 5 now stick in Rishikesh I get horrific food poisoning\n\nDay 7 I meet a fellow woman from my country who introduces me to her Indian friend who lives in the next city I’m travelling to and can show me around. Creepy friend calls and texts me about 100 times a day until I block him\n\nDay 9 move to Jaipur where I meet a couple of kids who are being used by a bunch of men to guilt tourists into using them as guides. The kids show me where they hide their money and tell me that the men beat them if they don’t hand it all over so to please say I only paid 100 rupees. Same day I have a bunch of men groping me at a tourist destination asking me if I go hot for the dark skin and my tuktuk driver starts asking about my sex life and that of my sisters\n\nGet taken to a clothing merchant and buy a few pairs of tailored PJs, check my account later to find I’d been charged $300 USD, more than double what was agreed\n\nDay 12 leave Jaipur by train. The woman working there tells me that I need to go to a different platform about 1km away, once I realise this is incorrect I’ve missed my train - luckily a “helpful” man who had been standing with the official was able to “help me” by taking me to his tour shop. Fuck off champ. I bought another ticket online, not the first class one I’d paid for but a lower class so I was stuck in a carriage with a bunch of creeps staring at me while picking their noses.\n\nArrive in Agra, my supposedly good hotel was not. Still trying to get my money back for that one, at this point I have up on staying anywhere that wasn’t a large 5 star western chain, I’d tried to support the local industry by booking supposedly 5 star Indian properties but they’re usually closer to 2 apart from the Rambagh Palace in Jaipur\n\nGo to the Taj, it’s beautiful but visiting the Agra fort and other sites find its filthy, smells like piss and is full of annoying people trying to sell you things or beg. I actually saw people pissing in these heritage sites, everyone throws their rubbish around\n\nBook a private car to take me from Agra to Delhi, it doesn’t show up. Book another who charges me then, you guessed it, doesn’t show. Had to use the hotel car for a ridiculous rate.\n\nArrive in Delhi at a supposedly 5 star hotel which is part of a western chain in Connaught place. I’ve never seen anything more dirty, and after weeks in India that’s saying a lot. I get sick from the pollution and the black aircon vents in the room. Leave the next day and move to the shangri la as I’d already stayed there and knew it was okay.\n\nSo in just over two weeks I’ve been robbed, have been cheated, scammed groped, stared at and lied to numerous times. I’m not a backpacker staying in cheap places, I flew business class for most of my travels, booked what was supposedly 5 star accom, dressed conservatively, didn’t go out at night and took all the steps you’re meant to and even then I had this experience.\n\nFor every 1 good person I met in India I met about 100 bad ones. It’s like they all see westerners as walking bags of money and women as creatures who are gagging to jump into bed with these slum dwellers.\nEverywhere I went all I saw was filth, even national monuments aren’t safe. I have t even bothered to go into detail on the daily occurrence of being followed by men and stalked by tuk tuk drivers\n\nReading the news paper each morning was a terrifying eye opener and was full of stores of rape and murder, even little kids murdering other kids.\nWithout a doubt the most disgusting place I’ve ever been and is full of people trying to take advantage of you in some way.\n\nI used to be an empathetic person but found myself hating almost everyone I came across there.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r /india/comments/9nk4qz/worst_place_ive_visited/\n\nu/grassfed-stoic '<br />Author: 'Critical_Finance'  id: '9nmkmy'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9nmkmy/a_lone_western_woman_tourists_story_cross_post/</li>

      <li>Title::: '3rd and the last letter to PM of India by Swami Sanand [05.08.2018 CE]'<br />Body: ' \n\nMatri Sadan, Jagjitpur\n\nKanakhal, Haridwar\n\nDate: 05.08.2018 CE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Your Service\n\nShri Narendra Bhai Modiji,\n\nRespected Prime Minister, Government of India, New Delhi\n\nRespected Prime Minister,\n\nI have written a few letters to you in the past addressing matters related to Gangaji, but I have not received any response from you addressing them till now. I had a great confidence that after your becoming the Prime Minister you would think seriously about Gangaji because you have yourselves stated in the run up to 2014 elections in Banaras that you have come there because of the call given to you by Ma Gangaji — that very moment I came to believe that you would probably do something worthwhile for Gangaji and it is on account of that belief that I kept waiting in peace for the past four and a half years. You would probably be aware that I have undertaken several fasts in the past seeking actions in favour of Gangaji and earlier accepting the grounds for my insistence ((sic) erstwhile Prime Minister Shri) Manmohan Singh ji decided to stop as well as cancel all activities in a major project like Lohari Nagpala which was already 90% complete by then, because of which the Government had to bear the brunt of the loss of thousands of crores rupees, yet the Government under Manmohan Singh ji went ahead and did this for the sake of Gangaji. Over and above this the then Government went ahead and declared the stretch of flow of Bhagirathi ji from Gangotri to Uttarkashi as an Eco-Sensitive Zone so as to ensure that activities that may cause harm to Gangaji never occur.\n\nIt was my expectation that you would go two steps forward and make special efforts for the sake of Gangaji because you went ahead andcreated a separate Ministry for all works relating to Gangaji,but in the past four years all actions undertaken by your Government have not at all been gainful to Gangaji and in Her place gains are to be seen only for the Corporate Sector and several business houses. Till now you have only thought on the point of earning profits from Gangaji. You do not seem to be giving anything to Gangaji,such is the impression created by all of your projects in relation to Gangaji. Even if for the sake of making a statement you may say that there is nothing to take from Gangaji but only give Her from our side.\n\nOn the 03.08.2018 CE, Union Minister Sadhvi Uma Bharti ji came to meet me. She made me speak to Nitin Gadkari ji on phone,but the response is expected from you. It is therefore that I could not give any reply to Sushri Uma Bharti ji. It is my request to you that you accept the following four desired requirements which remain the same as I have listed in my previous letter written to you dated 13th of June 2018,failing which I will give up my life continuing my fast. I have no qualms about giving up my life because the issue of Gangaji is very significant to me and is of utmost priority. I was a Professor at an IIT and was member of the Central Pollution Control Board as well as that of Governmental organizations related to Gangaji. It is on the basis of my experiences gained over all these years obeing part of these institutions, I can state that in the previous four years of your Government, there is not even a single action that can be said to be a fruitful one in the direction of saving Gangaji. It is my request, I repeat, that the following necessary actions be accepted and acted on. I am sending this letter through Uma Bhartiji.\n\nHere are my four requests for necessary actions:\n\n1. Bring the Draft Bill prepared by Ganga Mahasabha in 2012 \\[Draft of National River Gangaji (Conservation&amp;Management) Act – 2012: r/http://www.gangamahasabha.org/gm%20docs/Draft%20Proposal%20%20of%20Ganga%20Mahasabha.pdf \\] for discussion in the Parliament immediately and get it passed (I, along with Advocate M.C. Mehta and Dr. Paritosh Tyagi were part of the committee in preparing this draft). In the event that this does not happen, then from the above draft bill, items from Chapter-1 (from Article-1 to Article-9) be brought into force by way of an immediate Presidential Ordinance.\n2. As a part of the above stated exercise, cancel all the hydel power projects that are underconstruction over Alakananda , Dhauliganga, Nandakini, Pindar and Mandakini and also cancel all the proposed hydel power projects on Gangaji and all feeder streams of Gangaji.\n3. From the draft Bill mentioned above, Article 4(D)-1 cutting/deforestation and 4 (F) slaughtering/processing of living species/matter and 4(G) all types of mining activities be completely stopped and this be enforced and this be specifically enforced in Haridwar Kumbha-Kshetra.\n4. Constitute a Ganga Bhakta Parishad provisionally (till June 2019 CE) in which there will be 20 members nominated by you, who are to take an oath standing in the waters of Gangaji that they will act only in the interests benefitting Gangaji and only Gangaji’s favourable interests and in relation to all actions pertaining to Gangaji, the opinion of this Parishad be taken as decisive.\n\nSince I did not receive any response or reaction from you for my letter dated 13th June 2018, I have started my fast as stated in the letter from 22nd June 2018 and in that light,this is for your appropriate action quickly as well as with due thanks for the same.\n\nYours,\n\nSd.\n\nSwami Gyan Swaroop Sanand\n\n(formerly Prof. G.D. Agrawal)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSource: [http://gangatapasya.in/2018/08/17/3rd-letter-to-pm-of-india-by-swami-sanand/](http://gangatapasya.in/2018/08/17/3rd-letter-to-pm-of-india-by-swami-sanand/)'<br />Author: 'themoodygod'  id: '9ni000'<br />Score:21<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9ni000/3rd_and_the_last_letter_to_pm_of_india_by_swami/</li>

But now the movement has made its appearance in India and an astonishing number of big and small names have come to light. \n\nWhen many people still have the mentality that the victim is somehow to be blamed, it takes tons of courage to go public with your story. There is no scarcity of people pointing fingers at the victims, trying to shame them and defend the offenders. This is the case all over the world not just India.\n\nEveryone knew that sexual harassment was commonplace in the show business but nobody had come out with names before now. I think it is great that women are bravely exposing their harassers. But this movement should not just become a passing trend. The offenders must be punished no matter how famous they are. I think the police should become involved with the movement and not wait until an official FIR is filed. \n\nThe film industry is coming out in support of the victims and asking to boycott the offenders. But that’s not enough. They need to be punished under the law.\n\nDo you think that is feasible? Are the hands of the police tied until formal complaint is made? Or can they start investigations based on the information coming to light through the movement? I suppose they would say they need some evidence to conduct investigations but what evidence can a sexual harassment victim provide?

      <li>Title::: "TIL:Vallabhbhai Patel read books written by Indian authors about India. Every morning he read 30 newspapers frm diffrt parts of India. His father fought in 1857 Mutiny. Patel called Nehru's views an utopian dream, dismissed his visions of a brave new Socialist world as ‘this parrot cry of Socialism'"<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\nVallabhbhai Patel was India’s quintessential politician. He was an Oriental Tammany Hall boss who ran the machinery of the Congress Party with a firm and ruthless hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatel was an emotional man, but he never let those emotions break through the composed facade he turned to the world. If he gave off one salient impression, it was that of a man wholly in control of himself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis Delhi home was filled with books **but every one of them was written by an Indian author about India.** He was the only Indian leader who sprang from the soil of India.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis father had been a peasant farmer in Gujerat province near Bombay and Patel still lived his life at a peasant’s rhythm. **He rose faithfully at 4 a.m. and was in bed just as regularly each night at 9.30. The first waking hours of each day Patel spent on his toilet, doing the bulk of his reading, 30 newspapers sent to him daily from every part of India.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatel’s vocation for **Indian nationalism had come from his father who’d gone off to fight the British at the side of a local warlord in the 1857 Mutiny**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe’d spent the winter nights of his boyhood around the dung fire of their peasants’ hut, listening to his old soldier’s tales. Soon after, he left the land for good to work in the great textile mills of Ahmedabad where \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGandhi was to found his first Indian ashram. He studied at night, saved almost every rupee he earned until, at 33, he was able to send himself to London to study the law. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe never saw the London of the Mayfair drawing-rooms where Nehru had been an admired guest. The London he knew best was the library of the Inns of Court. **He walked twice a day the ten miles separating the courts from his lodging to save the bus fare. The day he was called to the bar, he took another walk, to the docks, to book a passage home. Once he returned, he never left India again.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatel had not even looked up from his nightly bridge game the first time he’d heard Gandhi speak in the Ahmedabad Club. \n\nSomeone, however, brought him a text of the Mahatma’s speech and as he read its lines a vision rose from its pages: \n\nthe vision his father had inspired around a dung fire in the winter nights of his boyhood. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe sought Gandhi out and offered him his services. In 1922 Gandhi, anxious to see what civil disobedience might achieve, **asked Patel to organize an experimental campaign among 87,000 people in 137 villages in the county of Bardoli outside Bombay**. His organization was so comprehensive, so complete,that the campaign succeeded beyond even Gandhi’s hopes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom that moment on, Patel had shared with Nehru the place just below Gandhi’s in the independence movement. Employing his special genius he had assembled the Congress Party’s machine, thrusting its tentacles into the remotest corners of India. \n\nPatel had always been profoundly wary of his brother in Congress khadi Nehru. The two men were natural rivals and \n\ntheir ideas of what independent India should be were markedly different.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***Patel had no use for Nehru’s Utopian dream of budding a new society. He dismissed his visions of a brave new Socialist world as ‘this parrot cry of Socialism’.*** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCapitalist society worked, he maintained, the problem was to Indianize it, to make it work better, not jettison it for an impracticable ideal. \n\n‘Patel,’ one of his aides noted, ‘came from an industrial town, a centre for machines, factories and textiles. Nehru came from a place where they grew flowers and fruit.’ \n\nHe scorned Nehru’s fascination with foreign affairs, the great debates of the world. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***He knew where power was to be found and that was where he was, in the Home Ministry, developing the loyalty of what would be independent India’s police, security, and information services, as he had developed the loyalty of the Congress machine.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Source:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Freedom at Midnight***  \nBook by Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins\n\n[https://archive.org/stream/FreedomAtMidnight/Lapierre%2C%20Dominique%20and%20Larry%20Collins%20-%20Freedom%20at%20Midnight\\_djvu.txt](https://archive.org/stream/FreedomAtMidnight/Lapierre%2C%20Dominique%20and%20Larry%20Collins%20-%20Freedom%20at%20Midnight_djvu.txt)'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: '9mrhmi'<br />Score:79<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9mrhmi/tilvallabhbhai_patel_read_books_written_by_indian/</li>

      <li>Title::: "A woman's take on #metoo"<br />Body: "Hi guys. So far I am seeing a lot of passionate discussions from both camps on #metoo. I just wanna provide my side because so far I didn't see women talking about it other than angrily accuse anyone (Including me). So I took a step back.\n\nBackground (if it matters) I am definitely right leaning (for lack of better word) and do not identify as a feminist. I have been raped as a child, abused and also have a lot of cases where creepos have slid into my DMs asking me weird shit. I do not bear any ill-will towards any man other than my molestors. #notallmen\n\nI think we can classify the whole #metoo cases into two : Clear sexual harassment and creepy behaviour not necessarily harassment. \n\n\nLet's address them one by one.\n\nClear sexual harassment:\n\nEg the Vikas Bahl and Utsav Chakraborty cases.\n\nSome FAQs:\n\n1. Why did the women not report it?\n\nThere are many reasons a woman doesn't report sexual assault. The main reason is deep down, she is confused, ashamed and doesn't know where to go. I'll tell you one thing Guys; the cops do shit. I was raped as a 6-7 yo (too young to remember) and when I reported it after years (I am sure y'all can understand why: it took me many years to even understand what was happening) the cops did nothing. I understand it may be lack of proof. But still they should have had an investigation.\n\nAnyways, some of these cases like for eg. UTSAV, Were reported to people considered his superiors and nothing happened.\n\nEven when someone takes you seriously , they ask questions like:\n\nWhy did you talk to him?\n\nWhat were you doing with him?\n\nWhy didn't you just block and leave it at that?\n\n\nThese happened to me when I reported a guy who asked me for nudes. And also another guy who told that my breasts were really big compared to my pictures. I have screenshot evidence for all of this. \n\nWomen are afraid of being ridiculed. \n\n\n2. Why are these cases being exposed to the media? Why not just go to the cops?\n\nBecause they were first reported (many) and nothing happened. Another line of reasoning may be that the cops may not take it seriously unless there is pressure. \n\nEither way, I do think harassers and molestors deserve to be shamed in public \n\n3. Why after so long?\n\nSome victims suffer from PTSD. Anxiety. Some may brlirve it's their fault. It may take years to come out of it. It may take a few more years to gather courage. Some may have been of marriageable age when incident happened and their mothers might have told them to hush it up (happens a lot, guys). Some may have been living in a conservative society where they will be viewed as damaged goods. Some may have been drunk, wearing short clothes and think that they were responsible for their own molestation, without realising that humans capable of controlling their libido.\n\n\nI hope I have answered some of the most frequently asked questions. I understand this is new to you and may be difficult to comprehend.\n\nLet's move on to the other Category: \n\nCreepy behaviour not necessarily sexual harassment:\n\nSome people were creepy. Eg Gursimran Khamba. (I hope I've spelt it right) but afaik it wasn't #metoo. But this behaviour also has to stop because it is scary. Anyone calling anyone else drunk, angry etc is SCARY. Be it a man or a woman. We have to put an end to such behaviour at such a stage itself so that they do not progress to #metoo.\n\nImo these incidents do deserve to come out so that these people change their behaviour but tagging them #metoo is misleading and takes credibility away. Therefore they should be clearly written down as just creepy behaviour.\n\nFalse cases:\n\nMy stance on them is that the woman has to serve the same time that a man would serve for molestation or rape (whatever she has falsely accused him of) but again has to be carefully investigated. I'm sad that the Rohtak thugs got away. Truly sorry, guys. \n\nThis whole thing is just sad. I've always felt male feminists who bash men were just projecting, now this has cemented my views.  This is just sad.\n\nI think right or left, we all just want a safe india for everyone. I also want to say please keep your kids safe, boy or girl, you don't know what monsters roam the streets looking for prey. \n\nStay safe, mitron"<br />Author: 'hotdentist'  id: '9mnblu'<br />Score:148<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9mnblu/a_womans_take_on_metoo/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Develop a marketing strategy to revive Air India'<br />Body: 'The National Carrier Air India is experiencing heavy loss in recent years. It has accumulated losses of more than Rs 50,000 crore and debt of about Rs 55,000 crore,\n\nFew of the reasons why Air India is going downhill\n\n1) Less income in passenger revenue: Air India earned passenger revenue of Rs 15,773 crore,  almost 20% lower than projected Rs 21,297 crore in FY16. The airline lost revenue due to its  own inefficiency like lack of aircraft availability, faulty deployment, low utilisation of human resources and lack of ancillary revenue.\n\n2) Low monetisation of assets: Lack or faulty initiatives to monetise its assets- one of the  primary requirement of meeting the revenue deficiency led to dip in the company’s fortunes. \nFive out of 12 properties, the terms and conditions made it impossible to monetize. \n\n3) Non-availability of proper aircraft: There has been a mismatch in demand and availability  of the airline. For instance, there was over provisioning of wide body aircraft where as it didn’t have required number of narrow body aircraft for certain route where traffic is low. \n\n4) Mismanagement in granting bilateral agreements with foreign countries: More than required granting of bilateral seats to carriers of foreign countries hurt Air India’s prospects. \nFor instance, bilateral seats were enhancing from 13,330 seats to 50,000 seats in the India- Abu Dhabi befitted Etihad Airways at a cost of Indian carriers. \n\n5) Loss making international operations: Air India’s most of International routes burn a hole in the airline’s pocket as it fails to recover the cost. For instance, flights to North America and Europe results in a loss of Rs 2,323.76 crore in 2015-16. In the Delhi-New York-Delhi route the occupancy stands at 77% as Air India faces completion from other airlines.\n\n6) Mismanagement of manpower: According to the requirement, the company had 11,433 employees as against the envisaged requirement of 7,245. In addition, there was  underutilisation of pilots and cabin crews led to loss for the airline. For instance, it has excess 86 pilots as of 2015-16.\n\nHow would you revive the company if you are the marketing manager? \n'<br />Author: 'Humidsummer14'  id: '9mf96r'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9mf96r/develop_a_marketing_strategy_to_revive_air_india/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How central projects really work in TN. Delay after delay after delay. Case in point, Maduravoyal port eway'<br />Body: 'What is this project and why is it so important?\n\nThe Chennai port is India\'s second busiest port for handling TEU\'s (containers). It\'s berthing facilities have space to easily add 40% to existing volumes (volumes being lost to Colombo) but there is a major major issue. \n\nRoad bottleneck. As the port is located in the heart of Chennai city (imagine Mumbai port in Colaba) and is in a densely populated area, roads get very clogged up during the day, hence truck movement in and out is permitted only from 11pm to 6am. Truck turnaround times are around 18-20 hours from Container Freight Station (CFS-think a yard for containers) that are around 15-20 kms away. Think about it, it takes 20 hours to travel 20 kms, unload / load your cargo and get back. In ports like Jebel Ali Dubai, this is at 1-3 hours. \n\n\nThe solution was this elevated expressway connecting the outskirts of the city (near the industrial hub of Sriperambudur and on the Bangalore Chennai highway) to the port directly so trucks can move 24/7. This also had the added advantage of linking the dense population clusters in the Western and central parts of Chennai with the core of the city. So what takes a car 1.5 hours to commute in peak would take 20-30 mins. \n\n* This was first mooted in 2008. MMS laid the foundation stone in 2009, but promptly the project stalled for lack of environmental clearance. This took 2 years but in 2011, clearances were gained, the Chennai port trust released 500 crores (of the then 1,600 crore project cost). 40% of the pillars were laid by 2012. \n\n* Bitch Amma came to power and as was her wont, anything started by MK, she stopped so the project was straight up killed. Multiple cases are filed but for god knows why, Jaya kept stalling and stalling and stalling. She then dies. \n\n* January 2017, the new Govt approves the project again (the first infra project they approved). This is when the Modi govts super efficiency kicks in. \n\n* Pon Radhakrishnan after 6 months, in June 2017 said "work will start soon". \n\n* In July 2017, Pon Radhakrishnan said "work will start early next year"\n\n* In Sept 2017, we were told a fresh DPR was being prepared and work will start soon. \n\n* In Feb 2018, Pon Radhakrishnan said "work will be taken up soon once the DPR is completed which will be very soon". He said that he had instructed officials to expedite the DPR and construction will start in 3-4 months. \n\n* In April 2018, NHAI said it will now consider it as a 6 lane eway as opposed to the 4 lane and.... surprise surprise, a new DPR will have to be prepared. \n\n* In Sept 2018, Pon Radhakrishna.....again said [discussions under way](https://m.timesofindia.com/city/chennai/chennai-port-maduravoyal-elevated-corridor-nhai-tn-govt-to-hold-discussions-soon-union-minister-says/articleshow/65950640.cms)\n\n* The DPR, that this deshdrohi Modi govt had promised in April 2017? [Due in a month or so](https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/150918/port-maduravoyal-elevated-road-nhai-to-finalise-project-report-by-1-m.html). But then it has been "due" for 18 months at this stage. While this deshdrohi Modi govt has been setting new records in highway construction in BJP run states, is spending lakhs of crores on projects in Mumbai, can\'t get one, ONE key project that will help improve the lives of 10\'s of thousands of citizens, help increase the capacity of the second busiest port in the country by TEU, reduce pollution and congestion (and accidents) going. \n\n\nAt this stage Chennaites are convinced that this project will never get off the ground and Pon Radhakrishnan will keep promising shit while nothing will happen because Modi and Shah don\'t care about Chennai or TN for the matter. For these deshdrohi\'s, TN doesn\'t get them votes, so fuck TN. \n\n\n#inb4, "muh anti national lemurian govt stalling", the TN govt has thrown it\'s full weight behind pretty much all central projects incl this one.

Holmes shows Jindal a photo a bridge he collapsed in New Delhi. Jindal says I wouldn\'t do something like this in New York - this is New York, not India. The regulations here are not like in India. \n\nAfter this, another US babu, who gave them permission to dig in the river gets killed. Holmes examines the body and realizes that it couldn\'t have been Jindal who killed him. Why - because the guy\'s hands were tied with a leather belt before he was killed. Since Jindal belongs to the devout Vaishnava sect (Holmes deduces it from seeing an idol in his brother\'s restaurant &amp; from the factor that Jindal doesn\'t wear leather belt or shoes &amp; doesn\'t eat beef). So it couldn\'t have been Jindal who killed because he wouldn\'t have touched the leather belt!

      <li>Title::: 'Meanwhile in Rajasthan....'<br />Body: "Since September 17 all employees of RSRTC or Roadways as it is commonly known here are on a strike, along with employees of Jaipur low floor bus service. They're demanding among other things that the July agreement with the govt be implemented before the assembly elections, which would give the employees the benefits of 7th pay commission. Other demands include stopping the Lok Parivahan Sewa for rural routes &amp; reversing the corporatisation of bus depots under a seperate dept. \n\nNow Roadways in Rajasthan is one dept. which consistently remains in loss (although the buses are famous for following schedule). Even today many in Delhi, UP or Haryana take Rajasthan Roadways if they want to reach somewhere on time. But now the service has net liabilities of ₹3500 crores. It has led to a situation where more than 4000 employees who retired in last 3 years aren't paid pensions &amp; gratuity on time. All this have led to a situation where the employees have chosen a strike as a last move to pressure the govt. The strike has stopped 4700 buses across the state leaving lakhs of passengers dependant on private buses,jeeps &amp; other transportation services which are milking the opportunity. For example Delhi-Jaipur route for which Roadways charged ₹400-500 &amp; private operators charged ₹250-300 is now costing ₹700-800.\n\nInterestingly enough the govt has refused any negotiations with the employees &amp; simply declared that those on strike wouldn't be paid any salary for the duration of strike. Curiously, the strike is preferable to govt exchequer as the roadways dept. costs ₹45 crore every month to operate after deducting all revenues generated. Seems like the common public is the only one that's suffering.

This would mean the bench needs to reconstituted afresh and the case needs to heard once again.\n\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/india/bhola-drugs-case-punjab-and-haryana-hc-judge-recuses-himself-5334639/\n\n-\n\nThe Deputy Director of the Enforcement Directorate Niranjan Singh, who was the investigating was also put under pressure. He took up voluntary retirement from his post yesterday, citing 'personal reasons'. His retirement comes THREE years before his term was to end.\n\nIn 2014, when Majithia was summoned by Mr. Singh for questioning, within a month he was transfererd to Kolkata. Eventually the and Punjab and Haryana High Court had struck down the transfer.\n\n&gt;  “Less than a month after he had summoned Majithia in December 2014, he was transferred to Kolkata. We had taken up the matter in his favour and got his transfer stayed in the Punjab and Haryana High Court,” said lawyer Navkiran Singh adding that there were several attempts to scuttle the investigation later too.\n\n&gt; “His team had been reduced. He had to present several details in the court in a sealed cover. Off late, I too began to feel that he was not working to his capacity as nothing was coming since the past one and a half years but I never knew that he was under so much pressure. I realised this when I met him last in the court, he seemed to be very much frustrated,” Navkiran Singh further said.\n\n&gt; Insiders also shared that after he got promoted in October 2016, his powers had been curtailed to being a supervisory officer and he was no longer the inquiry officer.\n\nhttps://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ed-deputy-director-who-probed-rs-6-000-crore-bhola-drug-case-puts-in-papers/663649.html\n\n--\n\nAfter Mr. Singh was promoted, the new Investigating officer had not taken up the drug case for next six months atleast.\n\n&gt; In May 2017, Singh was promoted to the post of deputy director and made the supervisory officer of the case. The day-to-day investigation of the case was handed over to two other officers under Singh.\n\n&gt; Sources close to the officer said the investigations into the case virtually came to an end following the ED’s move to promote Singh. No further chargesheets have been submitted in the case since.\n\nhttps://theprint.in/governance/ed-officer-who-questioned-akali-leader-majithia-in-multi-crore-drug-bust-case-resigns/130217/\n\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/india/six-months-on-new-io-in-bhola-drug-case-yet-to-take-charge-4962896/\n\n--\n\n&gt; A President Medal awardee in 2014, Niranjan Singh had lodged a case against ICE king Raja Kandola in 2012. Next year, he had taken up the drug case of Anup Kahlon, which ultimately came to be called as Rs 6,000-crore Bhola drug case.\n\n&gt; He had dug up various cases related to FEMA including Rs 800 crore nexus involving money changers. He had also done preliminary investigation in the FEMA case against ex-IAS Swaran Singh. But after his transfer issue cropped up, all other cases were taken back from him.\n\n&gt; With regards to the case, nearly 71 persons have already been charge sheeted (none in the last one and a half years).\n\n&gt; The main accused, including Bhola, Anup Kahlon, Bittu Aulakh and Jagjit Chahal, are behind bars since 2013, mainly because of proceedings filed by the ED in the case. \n\n--\n\nTo me it clearly appears the Central, State Govt. and other parts of the machinery are making sure to dilute or atleast delay the case for political gains. This appears to be a perfect example wherein all prominent political parties sit in cahoots to benefit.\n\nIf there are more events in this timelines, please let know; will append accordingly.\n\n---\n\nYou should also read:\n\n- [How the Confessions of the Punjab Synthetic-Drug Racket Accused Point to the Involvement of Cabinet Minister Bikram Singh Majithia](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/punjab-synthetic-drug-racket-bikram-singh-majithia)\n\n- [Den of drugs: How Punjab politcos are linked to Rs 700-crore drug racket](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/north/story/punjab-politicians-in-dock-for-alleged-connections-to-drug-lords-176476-2014-01-12)\n"<br />Author: 'InertZeal'  id: '9lvehb'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9lvehb/the_high_profile_rs_6000_crore_bhola_drug_case/</li>

Calling the Congress “arrogant” with a “casteist  and communal mindset”, she said that people had not forgiven the  Congress for their “corrupt government”. \n\nHer remarks left the Congress, which is trying to stitch together an  alliance across the country against the BJP, scrambling for damage  control and cautious in its response. The Congress pointed out that  Mayawati had also expressed her regard for Rahul and Sonia Gandhi and  said that “creases will be ironed out”. A section of the Congress,  however, believes the BSP chief is setting the stage for some hard  bargaining.\n\nHer decision to contest polls alone came hours after Congress leader  Digvijaya Singh said that Mayawati had wilted under pressure from the  Centre and a fortnight after she announced an alliance with Ajit Jogi’s  party in Chhattisgarh. The BSP also released a list of 22 candidates for  the MP polls even as the Congress claimed that talks are still on.\n\nCongress has only one goal, which is to defeat the BJP in Rajasthan,  Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. He said the Congress will welcome those  who can work with it in that endeavour. “And those who cannot walk with  us, they can tread their own path…which doesn’t mean that the resolve  to oust the BJP and save the Congress and the country’s ideology is  weakened.”\n\nAs for Mayawati’s comments against Singh, he said the Congress does  not agree with “any adverse comment” made against any of its leaders  adding that “…many things, both bitter and sweet, are said impulsively  and at the heat of the moment.”'<br />Author: 'dennyandrew'  id: '9l71i1'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9l71i1/mayawati_smashes_rahuls_2019_dreams_rules_out/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'A King and his Sword - Fictional Story about Free Speech [OC]'<br />Body: '&gt;**There** once lived a pensive King in a land far far away.  \nHe was young and always learning, as he traveled near or away.  \nHe noticed his people always smiling, saying good things, and found it strange.   \nWas he the only one who saw both ups and downs, as and when things change?\n\n&gt;**He asked his trustee Minister**, Mr. Worldly Wise, what was he going through?  \nMr. Wise first hesitated but then let a slip, "Cautious are many, honest are a few".  \n"Are they afraid that they would make me unhappy or upset? Am I really such a threat?"  \nTo which Mr. Wise just smiled and said, "Sire, its trivial. Over it, please do not fret."\n \nThe next few weeks the messengers went from pillar to post drumming the King\'s strange message:\n\n&gt;"**Here ye! Here Ye!** Our Benevolent King has called out to one and all!   \nOur Sire will hand out **his sword to those who wish to speak freely** in the Court Hall!  \nWhence you hold the Kingdom\'s Sword - for you like a King - So Speak Freely and Strong  \nfor you will be heard by everyone, paid heed to by the nobles and common throng!"\n\n&gt; **From far and wide did people come**, at first to sing praises of the King  \nJust to hold the sword in the Court, that was the new in-thing.   \nSlowly did a few old men come to hold the sword and to discuss  \n"policies of the kingdom that hurt their young, please change them thus"\n\nWhen the people saw the King listened calmly to the those who held his sword **even** when they were a little critical of the King and his rule, they felt a new door opened for them. The new band of people who came now gave feed back to the king upon how they needed help and how things can be changed for the better. \n\n&gt; **Mr. Worldly Wise** saw this and **cautioned the king in private space**  \n"Sire, You are very Kind and Nobel and you are needed to keep the kingdom from Fire"  \nThe King brushed him aside, "Perhaps you should give the sword a try.  \n Able to be honest with ones thoughts, is power as much as one\'s Lie"\n\n&gt;"**Sire, Indeed such freedom is power**, but my allegiance lies with the giver.  \nFor such power being gifted without moderation, makes me quiver"  \nTo which the King laughed and shook his head, "O! My dear Minister Wise!  \nAre we not building a greater Kingdom, when out in the open are my people\'s strife?"\n\n\nThis went on for a few years. As every year passed, those who held the sword to speak became louder. The Enunches, the young, the old, the women, the merchants and the soldiers spoke of their problems. It caused discussions and sometimes fiery debates. Some were ignored, while others were ridiculed. Some where heard while others caused rage. Yet, at no point the sword was not given to someone who asked for it.\n\n&gt;"**After a few years** came a knave, tall and wise, he sought the sword to speak out loud  \nJust as everyone else before him. Yet, a deafening silence befell as he spoke the crowd.  \n"Our King is wrong and Senile", he said, "We ought to clean up his mess"  \n"His policies have created great sorrows, None has he been able to Impress."\n \n&gt;"**As his subjects, it is our right** to hold the sword and speak as we live here!    \nAre we not stakeholders? Is it benevolence for the King to lend his ear?  \nHow dare he try to gift to us what truly was ours from the beginning?  \nAre you not tired of such audacity, which from inception, was demeaning?"   \n\nThe Knave then continued to speak while craftily construing every act of the King as wrong. Some were aghast, while other argued intelligently. Mr. Wise again and again asked for moderation to the King, but the King listened intently. Most people disagreed and challenged the knave. The Knave brandished the sword in the air and kept on repeating, until the court grew tired and weary. \n\n&gt;"**I shall continue to repeat** as I rouse the masses! The Kingdom needs Saving  \nThe King is wrong, and the court is Jealous. The King has been betraying."  \nThe Knave continued his tirade not just in the court, but on the streets and roads,  \nPeople thronged to listen to him, their nobles had to agree while poets wrote his odes.    \n\n&gt;**Those who objected with reason**, were clubbed with the jealous and the nefarious.    \n"Are they not betraying the King\'s Call and order?", "The tyrant and his ilk are quite hilarious"   \n"Now they wish to take away our freedom to speak! What next? Turn us into steak?  \n"To our rights and freedoms we will fight ! O Tyrant King! Doth not take us to be Meek!"  \n\nThe Knave was loved for his \'new thoughts\' and \'Ideas\'. Those who challenged his ideas were branded the tyrant\'s pawns or simply bigots. Those who tried to reason with him privately were branded "corrupt and offering bribes". Others who followed the Knave threw sticks and stale bread at those who questioned the Knave. Soon, his (\'Knave\'s) voice stood alone, while others started to give up.\n\n&gt;**And then the day came**, when the Knave marched in front of the King boldly  \n"O King! No one challenges me anymore, the people love me", he said coldly.   \nThe King looked at Mr. Wise and smiled, and then back to the Knave he turned  \n"You did not ask the sword, when you wished to speak?" the king discerned.  \n\n&gt;**The Knave smirked** "Sire, it has given me everything it could. It would merely be a crutch.  \nand yet, I would need it one last time. For a role which only a sword can fulfill as such."  \nWhence the King handed royal Sword, the Knave spun it around and plunged it into the King\'s heart.   \nTurning around, the Knave then declared, "The Tyrant is now dead!

      <li>Title::: 'The King and his Sword - A Fictional Story of Free Speech'<br />Body: '&gt;**There** once lived a pensive King in a land far far away.  \nHe was young and always learning, as he traveled near or away.  \nHe noticed his people always smiling, saying good things, and found it strange.   \nWas he the only one who saw both ups and downs, as and when things change?\n\n&gt;**He asked his trustee Minister**, Mr. Worldly Wise, what was he going through?  \nMr. Wise first hesitated but then let a slip, "Cautious are many, honest are a few".  \n"Are they afraid that they would make me unhappy or upset? Am I really such a threat?"  \nTo which Mr. Wise just smiled and said, "Sire, its trivial. Over it, please do not fret."\n \nThe next few weeks the messengers went from pillar to post drumming the King\'s strange message:\n\n&gt;"**Here ye! Here Ye!** Our Benevolent King has called out to one and all!   \nOur Sire will hand out **his sword to those who wish to speak freely** in the Court Hall!  \nWhence you hold the Kingdom\'s Sword - for you like a King - So Speak Freely and Strong  \nfor you will be heard by everyone, paid heed to by the nobles and common throng!"\n\n&gt; **From far and wide did people come**, at first to sing praises of the King  \nJust to hold the sword in the Court, that was the new in-thing.   \nSlowly did a few old men come to hold the sword and to discuss  \n"policies of the kingdom that hurt their young, please change them thus"\n\nWhen the people saw the King listened calmly to the those who held his sword **even** when they were a little critical of the King and his rule, they felt a new door opened for them. The new band of people who came now gave feed back to the king upon how they needed help and how things can be changed for the better. \n\n&gt; **Mr. Worldly Wise** saw this and **cautioned the king in private space**  \n"Sire, You are very Kind and Nobel and you are needed to keep the kingdom from Fire"  \nThe King brushed him aside, "Perhaps you should give the sword a try.  \n Able to be honest with ones thoughts, is power as much as one\'s Lie"\n\n&gt;"**Sire, Indeed such freedom is power**, but my allegiance lies with the giver.  \nFor such power being gifted without moderation, makes me quiver"  \nTo which the King laughed and shook his head, "O! My dear Minister Wise!  \nAre we not building a greater Kingdom, when out in the open are my people\'s strife?"\n\n\nThis went on for a few years. As every year passed, those who held the sword to speak became louder. The Enunches, the young, the old, the women, the merchants and the soldiers spoke of their problems. It caused discussions and sometimes fiery debates. Some were ignored, while others were ridiculed. Some where heard while others caused rage. Yet, at no point the sword was not given to someone who asked for it.\n\n&gt;"**After a few years** came a knave, tall and wise, he sought the sword to speak out loud  \nJust as everyone else before him. Yet, a deafening silence befell as he spoke the crowd.  \n"Our King is wrong and Senile", he said, "We ought to clean up his mess"  \n"His policies have created great sorrows, None has he been able to Impress."\n \n&gt;"**As his subjects, it is our right** to hold the sword and speak as we live here!    \nAre we not stakeholders? Is it benevolence for the King to lend his ear?  \nHow dare he try to gift to us what truly was ours from the beginning?  \nAre you not tired of such audacity, which from inception, was demeaning?"   \n\nThe Knave then continued to speak while craftily construing every act of the King as wrong. Some were aghast, while other argued intelligently. Mr. Wise again and again asked for moderation to the King, but the King listened intently. Most people disagreed and challenged the knave. The Knave brandished the sword in the air and kept on repeating, until the court grew tired and weary. \n\n&gt;"**I shall continue to repeat** as I rouse the masses! The Kingdom needs Saving  \nThe King is wrong, and the court is Jealous. The King has been betraying."  \nThe Knave continued his tirade not just in the court, but on the streets and roads,  \nPeople thronged to listen to him, their nobles had to agree while poets wrote his odes.    \n\n&gt;**Those who objected with reason**, were clubbed with the jealous and the nefarious.    \n"Are they not betraying the King\'s Call and order?", "The tyrant and his ilk are quite hilarious"   \n"Now they wish to take away our freedom to speak! What next? Turn us into steak?  \n"To our rights and freedoms we will fight ! O Tyrant King! Doth not take us to be Meek!"  \n\nThe Knave was loved for his \'new thoughts\' and \'Ideas\'. Those who challenged his ideas were branded the tyrant\'s pawns or simply bigots. Those who tried to reason with him privately were branded "corrupt and offering bribes". Others who followed the Knave threw sticks and stale bread at those who questioned the Knave. Soon, his (\'Knave\'s) voice stood alone, while others started to give up.\n\n&gt;**And then the day came**, when the Knave marched in front of the King boldly  \n"O King! No one challenges me anymore, the people love me", he said coldly.   \nThe King looked at Mr. Wise and smiled, and then back to the Knave he turned  \n"You did not ask the sword, when you wished to speak?" the king discerned.  \n\n&gt;**The Knave smirked** "Sire, it has given me everything it could. It would merely be a crutch.  \nand yet, I would need it one last time. For a role which only a sword can fulfill as such."  \nWhence the King handed royal Sword, the Knave spun it around and plunged it into the King\'s heart.   \nTurning around, the Knave then declared, "The Tyrant is now dead! Our Great People Get a fresh Start!"  \n\nNeither the court moved nor the guards stepped forward. A King was dead, long had he lived for this to be his last sight. A new King was standing in front of them. Would it be wise to charge treason? What about all the people who were cheering for the new King? What was ought to be done?

      <li>Title::: 'Central OBC scholarships: A Sorry Tale'<br />Body: ' \n\nA few weeks ago, we had [looked ](https://securecoreblog.wordpress.com/2017/03/09/kabristan-vs-shamshaan-clean-up-at-home-first/)at the sectarian bias that exists in Central Government scholarships with respect to SC/STs and Minorities.\n\nA little more digging reveals an even abysmal state when it comes to scholarships for OBCs.\n\nOn the 15th of December 2015, in the Lok Sabha, an Unstarred [question ](http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/6/AU2567.pdf)was asked to the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment vide question number 2567. The question was as follows.\n\n==============================================================\n\n*(a) whether the Government provides pre-matric scholarship to OBC students and if so, the details thereof;*\n\n*(b) the amount that is being given for each student;*\n\n*(c) whether the said amount is highly inadequate and if so, the details thereof;*\n\n*(d) whether the Government is planning to increase this amount; and*\n\n*(e) if so, the details thereof, and if not, the reasons therefor?*\n\n==============================================================\n\nWe will ignore the answers to questions c, d and e for now and concentrate on the replies given to a and b. I again reproduce the answer given verbatim\n\n==============================================================\n\n*(a): Yes. The details of the scheme are annexed.*\n\n*(b): The rate of scholarships and ad-hoc grant under the scheme is as under:*\n\n*I. Hostellers:*\n\n*The students as hostellers are covered from class III to X. The rates of scholarships are as under:-*\n\n*Class III to VIII Rs. 200/- per month for 10 months*\n\n*Class IX to X Rs. 250/- per month for 10 months*\n\n*II. Day Scholars*\n\n*The students as day scholars are covered from Class I to Class X. The rates of scholarships are as under:-*\n\n***Class I to V Rs. 25/- per month for 10 months***\n\n***Class VI to VIII Rs. 40/- per month for 10 months***\n\n***Class IX to X Rs. 50/- per month for 10 months***\n\n*III. Ad-Hoc Grant An ad-hoc grant of Rs. 500/- per student per annum to all students i.e. hostellers as well as day scholars are also given.*\n\n==============================================================\n\nLook at the amounts given for ‘Day Scholars’ – Rs 25/40/50 per month for 10 months in a year. This is in the year 2015-16!! What can a student do with Rs 25 per month is anyone’s guess.\n\nI also looked at the budgetary [allocations ](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2017-18/eb/sbe89.pdf)for OBC Post and Pre Matric scholarships in the Budget of 2017-18. The allocation has remained static for 2 years, including this year. The total is (885 + 142) crores since 2016-17, and is marginally higher than (823 + 121) crores in the year 2015-16.\n\nThe fact that there is no immediate plan to increase these amounts is also confirmed by the answer to sub-question (d) asked above. The answer is as below\n\n==============================================================\n\n*“For the increase in scholarship rates, which involves huge financial implications, the Department of Expenditure has not committed or assured any additional resources.”*\n\n==============================================================\n\nIn another Unstarred [question ](http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/7/AU707.pdf)vide number 707 asked/answered on 1st March 2016, information on the total number of OBC students who were granted various scholarships, and the total amount disbursed was sought. The information given was as follows\n\n* Post matric scholarships:\n   * Total number of scholarships – 60.88 lakhs\n   * Total scholarship amount – 76802.8 lakhs\n* Pre matric scholarships:\n   * Total number of scholarships – 203.52 lakhs\n   * Total scholarship amount – 9581.77 lakhs\n* The total number of OBC students receiving scholarships in 2015-16 are 264.4 lakhs\n* The total scholarship amount comes up to 86384.57 lakhs\n\n**The per-OBC-student scholarship amount therefore is Rs 327/- !!!!!!!**\n\n(**Edit: Corrected the numbers from the original post and added separate comparisons for pre and post matric**)\n\nJust for comparison, I searched around for similar data related to the Ministry of Minority Affairs.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the same\xa0data for minorities was provided in response to Unstarred [question ](http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/9/AU531.pdf)number 531 on the 20th of July 2016 in the Lok Sabha.\n\n\\*The comparison year remains the same – i.e. – 2015-16\\*\n\n* The total number of minority students receiving scholarships in 2015-16 are 3812654\n* The total scholarship amount is 742.58 crores\n\n**The per-minority-student scholarship amount therefore is Rs 1948/-**\n\n**Pre-matric comparison:**\n\n**OBC:**\n\nTotal number of students: 203.52 lakhs\n\nTotal scholarship amount: 9581.77 lakhs\n\nScholarship amount per pre-matric OBC student: Rs 47/-\n\n**Minority:**\n\nTotal number of students: 3459093\n\nTotal scholarship amount: 529.02 crores\n\nScholarship amount per pre-matric minority student: 1529/-\n\n**Post-matric comparison:**\n\n**OBC:**\n\nTotal number of students: 60.88 lakhs\n\nTotal scholarship amount: 76802.8 lakhs\n\nScholarship amount per post-matric OBC student: 1261/-\n\n**Minority:**\n\nTotal number of students: 353561\n\nTotal scholarship amount: 213.56 crores\n\nScholarship amount per post-matric minority student: 6040/-\n\nYou should remember that the criteria for an individual student to obtain scholarships is very similar – such as being below the poverty line, not getting any other scholarship or assistance and so on.

      <li>Title::: "Kanhoji Angria's letter to the honorable Bombay President (November 1720)"<br />Body: 'Kanhoji Angria was the commander of the Maratha navy during the time of Chhatrapati Shahu. He had been pretty influential in curbing the Tarabai faction in the civil war &amp; securing the throne for Shahuji. Originally working as a quasi-independent pirate-cum-warlord, his old friend Balaji Vishwanath Peshwa convinced him to join Shahuji\'s service &amp; free the fort of Raigarh from Janzeera\'s Siddi. He is sometimes called "the father of Indian Navy." \n\n\nThis letter is after another European attack on him, a combined effort by British &amp; Portuguese. While the Europeans called him pirate Kanhoji simply pointed that he was serving the lord of the western coast &amp; therefore allowed to charge custom duties. Anyways 18^th century India was not a place to be enforcing around law &amp; legality.\n\nThe letter is an interesting one as an example of his wit. It also showcases the diplomatic culture of the time where people kept extremely polite, even with their enemies (maybe why our diplomacy succeeds even now). Here is the letter. (For more examples of such letters see the letters by Surajmal &amp; Shivaji that I posted.\n\n\n&gt;I received your Excellency’s letter, and have understood all your Excellency writes me. ‘That the differences that continue even until now are through my means; that the desire of possessing what is another’s is a thing very wide of reason; that such-like insults are a sort of piracy; that such proceedings cannot continue long; that had I from my beginning cultivated trade, and favoured the merchant, the port I now govern might, by the divine favour, have in some measure vied with the great port of Surat, and my name have become famous; all which,’ your Excellency says, ‘is not to be brought about but by opening a fair trade; that he that is least expert in war generally comes off a sufferer thereby; and that he who follows it purely through a love that he hath thereto, will one time or another find cause to repent; that if I had considered this something sooner, I might have found some benefit and convenience thereby.’ Your Excellency says, ‘you are very well acquainted with the manner of my government, from its beginning, and for that reason you would not on any account open a treaty with me until I set at liberty the people of your nation that are prisoners here: after that, you would receive any proposition from me that was friendly, or might tend to an accommodation.’\n\n&gt;At all which I very much admire, especially when I find your Excellency persuaded that I have been the cause of the past differences and disputes, the truth of which your Excellency will soon find when you examine both sides; for as touching the desire of possessing what is another’s, I do not find the merchants exempt from this sort of ambition, for this is the way of the world; for God gives nothing immediately from himself, but takes from one to give to another. Whether this is right or no, who is able to determine?\n\n&gt;It little behoves the merchants, I am sure, to say our government is supported by violence, insults, and piracies; forasmuch as Maharaja (which is Sivajee) making war against four kings, founded and established his kingdom. This was our introduction and beginning; and whether or no, by these ways, this government hath proved durable, your Excellency well knows, so likewise did your predecessors; and whether it is durable or no, I would have your Excellency consider, it is certain nothing in this world is durable, which if your Excellency does consider, the way of this world is well known.\n\n&gt;Your Excellency is pleased to say, ‘if I had regard to the weal of the people, and favoured commerce, my power would be much augmented, and my port become like that of Surat;’ but I never have been wanting to favour the merchants, trading according to the laws of this country, nor of chastising those transgressing the same as your Excellency well knows. The increase of power depends on the divine will, in which human diligence little availeth. Until this day, I have kept up the power that was necessary: whether I shall continue it or no for the future, who can tell? but that will be as God is pleased to determine.\n\n&gt;Your Excellency was pleased to write, ‘that war proves most fatal to those where the use of the sword is not understood; but in the government of his Excellency Charles Boone, nobody can say there was not loss on both sides; for victories depend on the hand of God, and for this reason great men take little notice of such losses.\n\n&gt;Your Excellency is pleased to write, ‘that he who follows war, purely through an inclination that he hath thereto, one time or another will find cause to repent; of which I suppose your Excellency hath found proof; for we are not always victorious, nor always unfortunate.\n\n&gt;Your Excellency was pleased to write, ‘that you well understood the manner of my government, and for that reason you could not enter upon any treaty of peace with me, unless I would first set at liberty the people of your nation that are prisoners here. I very well know your Excellency understands the manner of my government from its beginning, therefore this gives me no wonder; but if your Excellency says you will admit any proposition, after having your people released, I must then likewise say, my people are prisoners under your Excellency: how can I then give liberty to yours? But if your Excellency’s intent was cordially to admit any overtures of peace for ending our present disputes, and do really write me for that end concerning the liberty of your people, I am to assure you my intent is cordially the same. It is therefore necessary, that some person of character intervene, and act as guarantee between us, to whom I will presently send your Excellency’s people.

      <li>Title::: 'After all that circlejerk on the number of Hindi speakers being on the rise in the country, let us look at the number of Hindi speakers who are willing to learn another language. Any other language.'<br />Body: "When a staggering number of people speak your language(for those who speak Hindi natively/as their first language) as their second or third language, i.e [980 lakhs and 310 lakhs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers_in_India), let us take a look at how many Hindi first language speakers are well versed in another language. This includes English too, not just Indian languages. \n\n&gt;https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/push-for-hindi-in-centre-state-mail/cid/1516227\n\n&gt; 42.7 crore of 102 crore people were Hindi speakers. But only 12 per cent Hindi speakers knew an additional language.\n\n&gt;  That means 88 per cent Hindi speakers were monolinguals\n\nSo, to all those who see any form of opposition to Hindi as bigotry and forms of imposition as only natural, does the logic only work one way? If a vocal minority of people can be used as a reason to prove the existence of hatred against Hindi then by that logic something else can be considered bigoted as well. We all know, when the opportunity or the need presents itself to learn another language (migration for work, relocation, sometimes even being born and brought up), instead of making an effort, there is a minor contingent that demands that they be spoken to Hindi. \n\nFor all that effort at making a bogeyman out of TN, it seems that Hindi native speakers are exactly the same. It seems like you are made for each other. \n\n&gt; That means 88 per cent Hindi speakers were monolinguals, he said. Similarly, about 90 per cent Tamil speakers were monolinguals.\n\nSo, apart from the numbers being in favour of Hindi, I don't see why Tamil shouldn't be imposed on the rest of the country or promoted as a lingua franca.\n/s (for trigger happies). \n\nSo, perhaps the native Hindi speakers, a lot of whom are ever so concerned about Indian culture and Indian languages, who always remind people that English is colonial, foreign and a symbol of oppression(something that I agree with btw) and who, more importantly, also think that Hindi should continue as an official language for the union government, something very crucial, can please explain to me why a looksy in the mirror is too much to ask. \n\nOr, to put it simply, why can't you be arsed to learn another language?

More details [here](https://www.altnews.in/postcard-news-a-mega-factory-of-fake-news-that-continues-to-spew-venom/).  \n\n[MyNation](https://www.mynation.com/): Claims to be run by Asianet, a Malayalam news channel.

Kovai media soon acquired OpIndia, which also made it to this list.\n\n[OpIndia](https://www.opindia.com/): What is that supposed to mean? Some kind of ~~Intelligence~~ "Op" on India?  To [quote](http://www.rediff.com/news/special/busting-fake-news-who-funds-whom/20180408.htm),\n\n&gt;According to Sharma, *OpIndia* was taken over by Kovai Media in **October 2016.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A smaller stake, amounting to 23,872 shares (almost 2 per cent), is  held by Catamaran Ventures, whose promoter is Infosys co-founder N R  Narayana Murthy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Kovai Media\'s financial performance has slowly picked up over the years.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Its revenue from operations was almost Rs 7.7 million in 2016-2017, a threefold growth rate over the previous year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It received Rs 3.5 million in advertisement revenue and almost Rs 2.3 million in subscriptions.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It also upped the ante in paying freelance writers. In 2016-2017, it  paid almost Rs 12 million to freelance writers -- double the amount it  paid the previous year.\n\ntl;dr: Software company with many foreign investors buys news portal and pumps money into it to turn it into a hate machine. OpIndia is now run by Rahul Roushan. Roushan once specialized in fake, parody-style news! Inspired by the American news satire website The Onion, Roushan started Faking News in 2008, when he was working as an independent consultant in New Delhi. Roushan wrote under the pseudonym *Pagal Patrakaar* (Hindi for *crazy journalist*). In 2009, the blog was turned into a full-fledged website called [FakingNews](http://www.fakingnews.com/author/pagalpatrakar).Guess who acquired FakingNews in 2013? [Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/). Although not considered a fake news source, it does toe the pro-BJP line. Guess who owns Firstpost? The Network18 Group. Guess who controls the Network18 Group? The Ambanis. So now you know why these news outlets hate Rahul Gandhi and anyone who criticizes the Rafale deal. To quote Wikipedia,\n\n&gt;In Jan 2012, there was a large investment by Mukesh Ambani\'s Reliance Industries Limited in a complex deal that offered a possibility that Ambani-held Independent Media Trust (IMT) might eventually gain a controlling interest. In July 2014, the ownership was transferred to Independent Media Trust. On 29 May 2014, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) announced it would be acquiring control in Network 18 Media &amp; Investments Ltd, including its subsidiary TV18 Broadcast Ltd. The board of RIL approved funding of up to Rs. 40 billion to Independent Media Trust (IMT), of which RIL is the sole beneficiary, for acquisition of control in Network 18 and its subsidiaries. On 8 July 2014, RIL stated that it has completed the Network18 take-over. In 2015 Network 18 under ownership of Reliance Industries took over ETV Network for about ₹2,053 crore deal.\n\nSome news channels of this group are as follows:\n\nNews18 \n\nIndiaCNN \n\nNews18\n\nCNBC TV\n\n18CNBC \n\nAwaaz\n\nCNBC Bajar\n\nIn case you are living under a rock, CNBC and CNN are American owned, and closely tied with the Intelligence Agencies of that country. Notice how cozy they are with the Ambani network. What if they are running the Ambani network?[oneindia](https://www.oneindia.com/): Run by BG Mahesh, who is a Board of Director of the United Way, a well known foreign, US-based NGO. He was also  part of the leadership team driving the historic Mission 272+ digital campaign of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the 2014 Loksabha Elections in India. I suppose this news portal is a continuation of this "digital campaign."\n\n[pgurus](https://www.pgurus.com/): Got caught spreading fake news about Congress finance minister Chidambaram. To [quote](https://www.ndtv.com/communication/gurumurthy-and-his-fake-news-gang-of-four-1642003),\n\n&gt;P-T-G\'s story - and it is clearly just a story - keeps changing. He alleged that P Chidambaram had paid NDTV Rs. 5,000 crore (or was it Rs.  5,500? The figures doled out by P-T-G kept changing). This lie was  thrown out of court and a fine imposed (scroll down for details). Now he  adds another lie about the promoters. Facts and numbers are not his  strength. So a health warning: anyone reading pgurus.com beware, it is  riddled and infested with post-truth dishonesty.

I presented her with examples like the persecution under the Delhi Sultanate and Timur\'s Invasion of Delhi where he proudly claims to massacre lakhs of Hindus to punish them for Idolatory and persecution under the Mughals, Deccan sultanates, Jizya etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe countered this by saying that it was not specific to Islam and Hinduism also persecuted and massacred non-Hindus. I asked her to provide any one example supporting her claims. She cited an example from the book, "The First Spring: The Golden Age of India" by  Abraham Eraly. She gave an example of the Hunnic king Mihirakula.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Mihirakula was the successor of Toramana and he extended Huns further into India. \n* Mihirakula was a devotee of Shiva (Hindu) and was vicious towards Buddhists and massacred them and destroyed Buddhist Shrines and Temples.\n* Mihirakula once wanted to find a chaste woman to perform a religious rite but he found none among the noble families and had to choose a potter\'s wife, so Mihirakula slaughtered 3 crores of women with respectible births along with their husbands , brothers and sons.\n\nShe also said that this was responsible for collapse of Buddhism in North India.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked into the source she cited. So first about the author of the book:\n\n&gt; **Abraham Eraly** (August 15, 1934—April 8, 2015) was an Indian writer of history, a teacher, and the founder of Chennai-based magazine A*side* .  \n&gt;  \n&gt; He studied History at a college in Ernakulam and followed it up with a post-graduate degree in the same subject at Madras Christian College in Chennai. He became a Professor of History at MCC in 1971.   \n&gt;  \n&gt; His historical writing career started while at Madras Christian College. Dissatisfied with the material he used to teach history, he began to write a series of books on Indian history. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA quick Wiki search about the Huns in India directed me to the whole book which is present on Google Books. Going through it, I noticed some points were cherry picked like:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Mihirakula was a devotee of Shiva (Hindu)  **BUT** the author also claims that as a bloodthirsty Hun, It was the God\'s destructive aspect that attracted him.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The massacre of the 3 crore women is claimed by Kalhana, a **12th** century kashmiri historian.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The author claims that the Buddhist massacres come from Buddhist texts and by the **7th**\\-century Chinese traveler Hsüan-tsang.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only Info I could find of the Hunnic King was:\n\n&gt; **Mihirakula**,  (flourished 6th century ce), second and final Huna (Hun) king of India,  son of Toramana, the first Huna king there. Inscriptions belonging to  Mihirakula’s and his father’s reigns have been found as far south as  Eran (near present-day Sagar, Madhya Pradesh state). A patron of Shaivism (worship of the Hindu god Shiva), Mihirakula is recorded in Buddhist tradition as having been uncouth and extremely cruel. Kalhana says that he killed 30 million people and he attacked Sri Lanka  and Tamil Nadu. He was a king from the race of White Hunas. He decimated  Buddhism in Afghanistan, but supported Saivism (Hindusim) in Kashmir.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo how should I counter this? Is this considered a Legitimate source? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou may read the book here [The Golden Age of India](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=te1sqTzTxD8C&amp;pg=PA48&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true) , page 48.

Profs in smaller universities).\n\n* Additionally they need to be NET qualified (Which is not a requirement as such, except in a few places).\n\n* Or they need to be qualified from Top 500 world universities - India has just 3 universities (IISC, IIT D, IIT B) more or less. Which means, Indian PhDs cant be recruited in Indian institutes. \n\nGenerally, PhD is a lot of specialization, while NET tests a lot of High level questions across the board and subjects. \n\nNeither Publications nor other subject merit is being considered. **The requirements on the job as an academic position is completely different from what are the essential qualifications**. Indian PhDs' future looks more bleak than before. \n\nThe argument from the committee's side would be that since we (India) are churning PhDs from Govt and Private colleges alike, we need some form of standard exam to allow them to qualify to teach and do research. Having the top 500 university clause would attract talent from abroad.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that the skill sets are quite different, it would render lakhs of our own post graduates jobless (academia education is not useful in most industries), future PhDs would not have much of a choice regarding work in academia (We don't have a separate research sector as such for them to be recruited). \n\nPhDs from abroad are not likely to come to India because the work environment is quite toxic and fucked up, more so than there - most will move out back again sooner or later (Eg: Ramalingam fellowship cases).

      <li>Title::: 'Economics Debate: Adam Smith\'s "Theory of Invisible Hand" applied to Indian Corporate Lobbyismus and Farmer\'s dilemma of paying loans or seeking another subsidy.'<br />Body: ' In the following post I try to use Adam Smith\'s  "Theory of Invisible Hand" and on how free market economics works to Congress , Big Corporate lobbism and the farmer\'s dilemma of paying loans or seeking anther subsidy. Read on and engage in discussion if you agree or disagree with some adaptation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***How is Public Interest advanced meaning how does everyone contribute to an economy while trying to achieve their own goal of becoming rich ?***\n\nEach individual strives to become wealthy "**intending only his own gain**" but to this end he must exchange what he owns or produces with others who sufficiently value what he has to offer; in this way, by division of labor and a free market, public interest is advanced.\n\nI won’t go much into **Invisible Hand** as described by **Adam Smith**, what he says I will give you a brief over of it,\n\nMan however rich or poor are equally happy. Our nature leads us to think that we would be happier if we were wealthier.  This is a good thing, because it leads us to struggle to become wealthier, thus increasing the sum total of human happiness via the mechanisms of exchange and division of labor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## The modern "Invisible Hand"\n\nAn invisible hand process is one in which the outcome to be explained is produced in a decentralized way, with no explicit agreements between the acting agents.\n\nThe second essential component is that the process is not intentional. The agents\' aims are not coordinated nor identical with the actual outcome, which is a byproduct of those aims. The process should work even without the agents having any knowledge of it. This is why the process is called **invisible**.\n\nThe system in which the invisible hand is most often assumed to work is the free market.  \n\nWe as Consumers always want the lowest price, and that entrepreneurs want  the highest rate of profit.  \n\nThus by making their excess or insufficient demand known through market prices, consumers "directed" entrepreneurs\' investment money to the most profitable industry.  \n\nRemember that this is the industry producing the goods most highly valued by consumers, so in general economic well-being is increased.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne extremely positive aspect of a **market-based economy** is that it forces people to think about what other people want.\n\nIn one of his most famous quotes:\n\n&gt;*Man has almost constant occasion for the help of his brethren, and it is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only. He will be more likely to prevail if he can interest their self-love in his favor, and show them that it is for their own advantage to do for him what he requires of them. Whoever offers to another a bargain of any kind, proposes to do this. Give me what I want, and you shall have this which you want, is the meaning of every such offer; and it is the manner that we obtain from one another the far greater part of those good offices which we stand in need of. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor Smith, to propose an exchange is to attempt to show another that what you can do, or what you have, can be of use to the other. When you carry out the exchange, it means the other person recognizes that what you can do or that what you have is of value. **This is why so much of a person\'s self-esteem is bound up in their job - a well-paid job is supposed to be a sign that others value your contribution and find it worth exchanging their own resources for.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn theory the invisible hand sounds good but how realistic is it ? Lets find out ,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### The Prisoner\'s Dilemma\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe "Prisoner\'s Dilemma" describes two people in a simple situation, acting in an informed manner, both attempting to maximize their well being, and yet making choices that lead to an unnecessarily poor outcome for both.\n\nTwo people, who are suspected of being accomplices in a crime, are held prisoner in separate, non-communicating cells. The police visit each prisoner, and tell both that if neither confesses, each will be sentenced to two years in jail. However, if exactly one prisoner confesses, implicating each other, the one who confesses will get off scot-free as a reward, and the other, who didn\'t confess, will receive a punitive sentence of five years. If each confesses and implicates the other, both will be sentenced to three years.\n\nWhat should a prisoner in this situation do? Suppose that the other prisoner doesn\'t confess. Then the best course of action is to confess, and go free. Even if the other prisoner does confess, it will be better to have done likewise - at least the sentence will be lower. Both prisoners will reason thus, so both will confess and end up serving sentences of three years - even though, if both had remained silent, both would have served sentences of only two years.\n\nIt may not be immediately clear what the relevance of the Prisoner\'s Dilemma is to Smith\'s theory of the Invisible Hand. In fact, it has a number of implications for economic behavior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Temptation to default – Vijay Mallya’s / Nirav Modi\'s temptation syndrome\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVijay Mallya or Nirav Modi and the Bank have freely agreed to grant of loan to their mutual benefit, that is bank granting Mallya a loan in return for certain interests and the principal amount to be paid back in certain number of years.  \n\nTo make sure there is no cheating of any kind between the Banks and the loan taker in this case Mallya/Nirav Modi, we have courts and contracts in place to take care of these kind of situations.\n\nThis reduces the fear for the Banks of  Vijay Mallya/Nirav Modi defaulting, and makes it easier in repayment of loans.   \n\nEnforcing laws of contract requires cooperation and resources from someone else - in democratic societies, the courts on behalf of the government and the people. \n\nBut courts and prisons and police cost money and most of the costs fall on people who were not party to the contract in the first place - who are therefore paying for a service that doesn\'t directly benefit themselves.  \n\n***But in the India case, the courts and police are not as efficient as they should ideally be.***\n\nSuch courts fall into the category of "**public good**" - we are all better off in a society where the rule of law is upheld - but are not created and maintained by any invisible hand mechanism. Courts are set up deliberately to carry out a **public good**; and, although they may not always work the way they are intended to, there is nothing unintended about their use to enforce contracts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Subsidy-seeking – Vijay Mallya / Nirav Modi throw big parties to the Congress and to Bank Employees in return for favour theory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a democratic society, there is a strong temptation for "**special-interes**t" groups to form and lobby the government to provide tax-payers\' money to the people like Vijay Mallya / Nirav Modi in the form of subsidies.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Politicians like Congress party find the prospect of buying the loyalty of the Vijay Mallya / Nirav Modi attractive, and the Vijay Mallya / Nirav Modi sees the prospect of getting other people\'s money for nothing.***  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClearly, everyone would be better off if no one sought subsidies - by definition, **subsidies are only needed for unprofitable activities,** that is, activities that other people do not value sufficiently to pay their own money for.  \n\nHowever, if other people seek and gain subsidies, anyone who doesn\'t bother trying to do the same for themselves will end up subsidizing others while receiving no subsidies themselves.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Farmers Dilemma \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**This fear may force large numbers of people to spend their time lobbying the government for subsidies, rather than simply engaging in more profitable activities** \\- a classic example of the Prisoner\'s Dilemma, and one over which no court has jurisdiction is the Famer\'s loan subsidies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe previous Congress govt have pampered farmers with loan subsidies for votes and this turn has caused a huge burden on Tax Payers. Since the farmers are now in dilemma whether to pay back the loan or go out on streets for a few hours a day to get their loans washed off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe govt which was happy to offer the loan previously are also in dilemma since they afraid if they don\'t give the farmers another subsidy they might not vote in their favor in the coming elections. So instead of being moral ethical of not wasting the tax payers money they go ahead with giving farmer\'s another round of subsidy in the greed of making sure to remain in power.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA very similar situation occurs regarding monopolies. Since pretty much every producer is a consumer, it is probably to everybody\'s benefit overall if no producers attempt to raise prices by monopolizing their market; however, attempting to enforce a monopoly can be very attractive to individual producers. Smith rather sardonically observed that\n\n&gt;*People of the same trade seldom meet together even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public or some contrivance to raise prices."*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI read an interesting article and adapted it to India\'s situation, those who are interested can read the same from here - [https://plus.maths.org/content/adam-smith-and-invisible-hand](https://plus.maths.org/content/adam-smith-and-invisible-hand) '<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: '9jfz4u'<br />Score:44<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9jfz4u/economics_debate_adam_smiths_theory_of_invisible/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Monday Mythology : Ep-4 ----&gt; Mythology Meta'<br />Body: '*Tell me a story to remember,*\n\n*Tell me a story to sleep,*\n\n*For when I face the long december,*\n\n*When all the birds have sunken deep.*\n\n*I can sway the smoke from the ember.*\n\n*Singing to my kin and sheep.*\n\n-- Hymn of the Storyteller\n\n#Mythology – From where does it come ? \n\nTo understand the evolution of stories into mythology let us invoke the lesser known toolkit of survivability. \nLindy effect, the term coined by Benoit Mandlebrot is a very strong tool to understand the continuity of certain designs, certain traditions, certain values that we have shared as humans across cultures and within our specific cultures. This also includes scientific theories, as Taleb has even explained Karl Popper’s falsification in terms of Lindy Effect.\n\nOne can think of Lindy effect as the evolutionary game theory of non-biological items. \nWhat doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger, what kills you, makes others stronger. That which survives to pass the gene, survives even more. \n\nIn terms of stories, it is roughly the same. \n\n&gt;What does the Lindy Effect say ?\n\nIt says that the probability of survival of a non-tangible item, increases as the time increases. Hence, the distribution of survival durations for items in the same domain actually follow a power law distribution. \n\n&gt;If a book has been in print for forty years, I can expect it to be in print for another forty years. But, and that is the main difference, if it survives another decade, then it will be expected to be in print another fifty years. This, simply, as a rule, tells you why things that have been around for a long time are not "aging" like persons, but "aging" in reverse. Every year that passes without extinction doubles the additional life expectancy. This is an indicator of some robustness. The robustness of an item is proportional to its life!\n\nThe idea seems rather ridiculous at the first glance, as we all know that there are many old things and old designs that are not in vogue today. \n\n**BUT**\n\nThe Lindy effect does not say anything regarding the conflict between old and new, nor does it explicitly say that old things cannot die. What it gives is the probability of survival in absolute for a given time interval.\n\nIf a story has survived for 100 years, the probability of its survival in the next 100 years is more than the probability it had in the first 100 years, given the same circumstances.\n\nAnd it meets common sense too. As in the first 100 years, the story must have faced certain unspecified barriers. Barriers could range from something arbitrary like storyteller’s untimely death to sudden invasion of barbarians in the land or something cultural like the king persecuting a people of a community or speakers of a language.\n\nBut the most fundamental barriers lie in the human psychology, how we humans, orient themselves in the world as individuals and tribes as a whole. If the story doesn’t resonate with us, there is no way it can survive the next summer. It has to do relate very deeply with our survival, or our tribes’ survival or our relationship with the environment and existence as a whole. \n\n\nIf a story somehow makes through the test of these countless barriers, it gets immune to those set of barriers. Only new and alien barriers pose a threat to it. Meanwhile, the proliferation of story happens in the opposite direction to those of barriers in the form of Lock-in Benefits.  Lock-in Benefits in case of stories are plays, adaptations, cinema, paintings, poems and most importantly, induction in the religion. \n\nSlowly, over a course of a millenia, most barriers to a story have died, and the engagement has grown to a level that a story has become immortalized.\n\n**This is the time when we call a story, a mythology.**\n\nThis is precisely the moment, when a mythology has proven itself worthy of religion. When mythology can actually help humans guide their lives and act as the voice of their conscience. When mythology can perhaps speak the deepest understanding that the humans are capable of, in rather simple language that everyone of us could understand. \n\n#Mythology in Religion \n\nReligion as generally observed consists of two parts, the Dogmatic and the Prophetic. One part that precisely deals with observance of festivals and rituals. The other part deals with inner exploration and philosophy. Mythology plays a very important role in giving sense to the Dogmatic aspects of religion.\n\nA healthy religion generally has a nice relationship between these two elements. \n\nMythology gives a foundational structure on which certain rituals and festivals could be placed. \nFor example : Holi as we all is a spring festival. It happens on Spring, is celebrated with colors and flowers, that are available in spring. But we have a Puranic story of Holika attached to it, which is intimately bound to the proceedings of the festival, though the contents of the story don’t share any specific relationship with the season of Spring. \n\nHolika story is a classic example of purification by fire. Purification or resurrection by fire is a common archetype, most recently used in popular TV series, Game of Thrones for the character of Danaerys Targaereyan.\n\nBut this mythological story gives the festival a prophetic perspective. This way the Dogmatic meets the Prophetic. The mundane meets the divine. \n\nThis is precisely why, every festival in India, has got a Katha(story) to it. The Katha may or may not have anything to do with the basis of festival.\nIf one does a laser-sharp analysis to these festivals, one would find that almost all of them are more of less related to physical cycles of the agrarian life. But, it is Katha, which infuses in these festivals, something more, something eternal. \n\n\n#Mythology as a superset of Ideologies\n\n“Histories are often written by victors”. The phrase is often used to deride the authentication of historical texts. But we have seen in late 20th century, that even mythology is being evaluted in such contexts.\n\nMythologies have historical elements to it, agreed. Cultural elements present in mythologies can’t be denied. The forest-dwelling people were called Nagas, and the mountain dwelling people were Gandharvas. Our mythology has elements of culture. \n\nBut that doesn’t mean that the mythology is in any way partial or biased to anyone. If there are stories of heroics of Garuda, there would be stories of Vasuki too. Mythology has a basic obligation to be comprehensive in order to survive. \n\nIf Vishnu symbolizes all that is stable, civilized and rational. His following are the most suave Devas. All his accessories Shankha, Chakra, Gada and Padma are either Gold or rare or fragrant. \n\nShiva symbolizes all that is unstable, uncivilized and irrational. His following is savage, in the most literal sense of the word. All his accessories are found in wild. He is wearing a dead animals skin, his garland is a snake and what he carries is an iron trident.  \n\nMythology is not ideology. It is the place where ideologies collide and find their common ground. \n\nMythology is the place where Bali, the demon king of today, is the Indra of tomorrow. It is the place where Bali and Indra had to come together to get the best things out of the cosmic ocean. And divide between themselves the riches that come out of it. \n\nMythology is a place where Indra, the king of Adityas is ridiculed by a kid in Gokula. \nMythology is a place where Bali, the king of Daityas is blessed by a kid in Patala. \n\nMythology is not written by victors. Neither it is written by losers. It is what remains when both are done telling their part. \n\n\\m/\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n   '<br />Author: 'decoder007'  id: '9irvfc'<br />Score:32<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9irvfc/monday_mythology_ep4_mythology_meta/</li>
