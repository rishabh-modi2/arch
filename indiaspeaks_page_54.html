      <li>Title::: 'The Indian state, a new paradigm in development'<br />Body: 'It has always struck me that India as a civilizational entity post 1947 is blazing an entirely new model of development and democracy, and it is surprising that it has been given such limited coverage in the media or deeper analysis even. If you look at the first wave of development in the modern era (starting 1600’s), of the powers in the West (and I include the USA here), that lead to the great divergence was,  the opening of massive colonial markets as a source of cheap raw material &amp; later for finished goods triggered industrialisation which then lead to massive wealth transfer from the colonies to the mother countries which then created a large and growing middle class which then started clamouring for greater rights which then lead to more open democracies\n\nLimited devolution of powers had already taken place (USA, France and chiefly Britain), but these were mostly oligarchies with the voting rights given to a tiny proportion of land owning or otherwise wealthy individuals who were in the UK known as the ’40 shilling freeholders’. Universal Suffrage though did not come until much later. Take the UK for instance, despite having a parliament in some form from 1265 onwards via Simon De Montfort’s Parliament, all adult men got the right to vote only in 1918, all women only in 1928. The US had only white males eligible to vote for a century, women got the right in 1920 and people of colour only in 1965! France obtained UniSuf only in 1944 though it had some form of parliamentary democracy from 1792 on\n\nAll these states had attained middle to high income (per capita) status by the time they  came around to granting UniSuf. Along with UniSuf came wealth redistribution via taxes and the creation of a welfare state (the US is still waiting for this to happen I guess). Point is, there was a certain level of national maturity, and prosperity when the conditions for wealth redistribution to take place. A large part of absolute poverty had been eliminated thanks to the aforementioned wealth redistribution and industrialisation\n\nIn essence, these states denied the poorest and the marginalised the right to vote while a kleptocratic oligarchy ran affairs, and once extreme poverty was reduced substantially, and the rise of the middle class started was the right to vote given to these sections of society. Alternatively you have the autocratic states like China, with one party in total control, imposing growth top down, creating and removing structural impediments at will. India though has a unique model, one that has despite all the doomsayers, worked and continues to do so\n\nIndia with its 12% literacy rate, 70% poverty rates in 1947 granted complete universal suffrage. It has from then on has created a truly open democracy (except for the emergency period), and while we have our failings, a peaceful and smooth transfer of power is not one of those. This is very unique as just look at our own neighbours, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka (to a lesser extent) which have had massive instability, coups, counter coups, constitutional crisis’ etc. If you look at countries in our level of HDI, India is relative to them, far up on the democracy index ladder. What is also unique is the transfer and redistribution of wealth via social welfare schemes has been driven by the electorate and electoral competition amongst the political parties\n\nWe have managed to reduce absolute poverty from 70% in 1947 to the 15% now and are on track to eliminating it entirely by 2030. In a matter of 83 years we would have peacefully achieved the greatest reduction in poverty by a democracy. Our systems of checks and balances have for such an immature democracy worked splendidly (except for 1947 and the judiciary running amok these days), despite vitriol and mud flinging, power has been transferred in a completely peaceful and civil manner, guaranteeing stability'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'be7fql'<br />Score:47<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/be7fql/the_indian_state_a_new_paradigm_in_development/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'List of Indian media houses and their political leanings'<br />Body: "There have been some graphs posted previously which talk about media's leaning on political spectrum. However, some of those either are inaccurate, highly biased or are concentrated on the accuracy of reporting, which cannot always be measured and can be opinion based.\n\nI am trying to make a simple list of political leanings of various media houses, channels, papers or internet sites. I am concentrating more on English media so people are requested to mention non-English media's leanings if they have any.\n\n\nStarting from **far-left**:\n\n- The Wire\n- NDTV\n- Indian Express\n- The Hindu\n- Amnesty India\n- Bloomberg-Quint (1)\n- Reuters India (2)\n- BBC India (3)\n- Huffington Post India\n- Scroll.in\n- TheWeek\n- MirrorNow / any Mirror based paper (4)\n- Gujarat Samachar (5)\n- Caravan Magazine\n- Janta Ka Reporter\n- National Herald\n- The Logical Indian\n- Tehelka\n- Cobrapost\n- AltNews\n\n\n\nThese are somewhere around far-left to proper **centre-left**:\n\n- ABP News\n- IndiaToday / Aajtak\n- Hindustan Times\n- Indiatimes (6)\n- DNA India (7)\n- New Indian Express\n- News18\n- Firstpost (8)\n- ThePrint\n- Outlook Magazine\n- DailyO (9)\n- Livemint (10)\n- Moneycontrol\n- Business Standard\n- Business Insider India\n\n\n**Centre** proper:\n- Times Of India\n- ANI media agency\n- PTI media agency\n- WION (11)\n- DD News\n\n\nThese are somewhere around **centre-right to far-right**:\n- TimesNow\n- Swarajya Magazine\n- MediaCrooks\n- Financial Express (12)\n- The Hindu Business Line (13)\n- Economic Times (14)\n- IndiaTV\n- Zee News\n- Republic TV / Republic Bharat\n\n\nOutright **far-right**:\n- OpIndia\n- Postcard.news\n- Rightlog.in\n\n\nUndetermined - help appreciated:\n- The Asian Age\n- News Laundry\n- News Minute\n- Deccan Chronicle\n- Deccan Herald\n\n\n**Explanation of numbers:**\n\n1) Bloomberg worldwide is known for its right wing leaning. But when it came to India, it joined hands with The Quint. Together Bloomberg-Quint they are known to post far-left articles, while hiring far-left authors and economists.\n\n2) and 3) Many might find it surprising to see these in the far-left section. BBC and Reuters are known for their unbiased, highly factual reporting worldwide. Then why in far-left. Reason is, when these both agencies come to India, their unbiased reporting is sidelined. It specifically hires authors and reporters which come from far left background and are eager to show the country in bad light no matter what.\n\n4) Mirror Now is a subsidiary of Times News Network. Known for far left views, even more so on the channel.\n\n5) Gujarat Samachar requires a special mention. Many might not have heard this name before. Known for vile targets against Modi and army, the owner of once Gujarat's most read news paper can put evey party mouthpieces to shame. Well known to show Modi as the sole responsible person of Gujarat riots, the owner of this media house has a lot of petitions filed against him for his anti-army insults and comments.\n\n6) IndiaTimes is subsidiary of Times Of India, this is a far-left to centre-left leaning site.\n\n7) DNA is subsidiary of Zee Media yet it is not right winged. It's somewhere around left-centre.\n\n8) Firstpost is subsidiary of News18 media. The opinion based articles are from both sides, news is neutral to left-centre.\n\n9) DailyO is a subsidiary of IndiaToday. This opinion based site allows people from both the sections of the political spectrum. But a lot of them are far-left leaning.\n\n10) Livemint is a subsidiary of Hindustan Times. Known for posting both right wing - due to business oriented and left wing articles, however more of them are left wing ones. Some of the most detailed economic articles can be found on it.\n\n11) WION is a world oriented subsidiary of Zee Media. While known to show their political leanings towards India and Modi, they try to balance it out with their liberal views and reporting.\n\n12) Financial Express is a right wing subsidiary of the left wing Indian Express - while the articles on it might make one wonder how can it be associated with Indian Express, it is. Known for right wing click-bait articles, some of these articles are not found anywhere else on the internet, some of them even reported many days later in other mainstream media.\n\n13) The Hindu Business Line, owned by The Hindu, is similar to the FE, right wing subsidiary of left wing The Hindu, however, is relatively more subdued than FE.\n\n14) Economic Times is a right wing business oriented subsidiary of Times Of India. Similar to FE, some articles posted on it are not found elsewhere. The only exception to their political leanings is that they sometimes post copied version of Bloomberg-Quint, otherwise they are pretty centre-right leaning.\n\n\n\n**Source and reasoning behind all this:**\n\nI normally read dozens and dozens of articles every day and I just wanted to share what I feel is the leaning of various media in the country.\n\nWhile I am not claiming any of the above to be factually and fully correct, I have made the above list from my experience of reading various articles on various sites and watching news on various channels and reading people's views about them. In this post I have tried to be as open and correct as possible. But as always, humans are known to mistakes and have their own biases.\n\nAny suggestions, corrections, opinions and constructive criticism is welcomed for this."<br />Author: 'Mumbaikarsevak'  id: 'be5b2z'<br />Score:90<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/be5b2z/list_of_indian_media_houses_and_their_political/</li>

I\'ll quote the response\n\n&gt;We get these stereotypes from Aamir Khan\'s films. Because his films reflect Indian social problems. For instance, women there have lower social status. Then there\'s the caste system and the slums, which leaves the impression that they need to develop further.\n\nWhen was the last time a Chinese film aired in India and become such a hit that common Indians would be referring to the movie when asked about Chinese culture? Would such a hypothetical Chinese movie be aired in India that would "reflect Chinese social problems like whole populations in the millions sent to concentration camps. For instance, Tibetans have lower social status. Then there\'s the issue of Chinese drivers driving over accident victims twice etc."? Does the collective conciuosness of the common Indian even know a Chinese actor other than Jackie Chan? \n\nOverall the people interviewed shared a skeptical view of chinese media reports of India and said the reports are probaly exaggerated and they were hopeful for future cooperation.'<br />Author: 'bakchodbaj'  id: 'bdklmf'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bdklmf/heres_a_street_interview_in_shanghai_about_how/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Reviving Sankhya 2: Prakriti and Purush'<br />Body: "Previously I talked about the difference between the monism and dualism. Today I would like to elaborate on how this dualism is expressed in Sankhya philosophy. Sankhya divides things into the material world(Prakriti) and the experiencer(Purush). Think of it this way, imagine in the near future Virtual Reality has been realised. You are one of the people who get to try this. You put on your device and it transports you into another world where everything is different yet seems real. This world that you get to experience would be Prakriti. Everything the sun, the earth, the galaxies, the stars, even your own body is part of Prakriti. Prakriti in Sankhya is treated as something unreal, though to us it seems real. It is forever changing, forever evolving. Even your own body grows old eventually and change is a part of Prakriti.\n\nPurush on the other hand in the previous analogy would be yourself. But though it is easier to explain Prakriti through the previous analogy to understand Purush from this would not only be incorrect but wrong. Purush is basically your consciousness. The thing that makes you yourself. An incomplete but better analogy would be, imagine a rogue AI takes over this world which has VR. The AI malevolent as it decides to separate every human being's brain from its body then hooks it up with VR to give you this illusion that you're still living in this material world. Your brain would be the thing that you could call Purush. But we are not quite there and I would elaborate on why this is an incorrect definition. The AI decides that humans itself are becoming more and more intelligent and recognizing that they are in a simulation, so he comes up with a new solution. He dissects your brain in such a way separating with your memory, your decision-making skills and even your sense of current self. The thing left after this is what you can call Purush. The unchanging, undestroyable.\n\nThe reason for this very complicated definition of Purush is because in Sankhya our mind is a very very special entity. Our mind according to Sankhya is the infusion of both Prakriti and Purush. It is unchanging yet evolves and is subject to time, unlike pure consciousness Purush. I would have loved to go into deep detail about how Purush and Prakriti come together and give rise to our mind and consciousness(this itself has seven levels) according to Sankhya but alas it is beyond the scope of this series and maybe I would write about it some other time.\n\nNow to attain moksha or freedom from this material world(Prakriti) you need to be self-realized. To be self-realized i.e. your real self you need to experience your Purush or pure consciousness. But the question still arises am I not experiencing myself right now. No, you're not you are just experiencing a part of it. Do this simple experiment, look away from your screen and just see the present. I know it doesn't sound correct but that is the only instruction weird as it is that would work. Did you notice the elevation of your mind from when you were reading this article and when you looked away? This too is just a part of Purush, not wholly Purush. To experience it is easiest when you are not hindered by your senses(which is also a byproduct of the infusion of Purush and Prakriti). That is why people often have life-changing realization when they take LSD(which inhibits our senses) or in an isolation tank or while meditating. \n\nSo why am I rambling about all this when I stated in the first article that I would be going on in a more practical part of Sankhya philosophy. The reason why I am elaborating upon the theory part is that it is what makes the core of Sankhya enabling us to not only make the better decision but exhibits a better attitude towards life. After all, grasping the nature of the situation you are in the first step to solving the problem. Another thing I would recommend is meditating. Give it only the time you can afford but build a habit. I would elaborate more on the meditation techniques when I get into the Yoga part of these series. \n\nhttp://dgkl.in/reviving-sankhya-2-prakriti-and-purusha/\n\nPrevious posts-\n\nhttp://dgkl.in/reviving-sankhya-1-monist-vs-dualist/"<br />Author: 'srthk'  id: 'bdi2gw'<br />Score:77<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bdi2gw/reviving_sankhya_2_prakriti_and_purush/</li>

There are many African countries poor like India, do they hate African countries too as much as India? Or is it ignorance? Maybe they only know negative aspects of India?

Prime Minister doesn’t live in fool’s paradise where give and take policy or tactics work in force in a particular constituency.\n\nIt is a great democracy and opposition is free to investigate what is boiling in the cauldron means the black box so they may put an application to the appropriate authorities. We are spectators to watch the show and the show must go on.

      <li>Title::: 'Reviving Sankhya 1: Monist Vs Dualist'<br />Body: "  \n\nAs an ardent follower of Sankhya, I have seen a lot of people who don't have even heard of Sankhya. Through these series of blog posts, I intend to create awareness and a following of a philosophy that was once the crown jewel of Hindu Philosophy. I would prefer discussing the practical points of Sankhya in our lifestyle which would benefit the follower of this philosophy through my own experience, but first I would have to lay down the philosophical foundation for it. Since Sankhya is an Indian philosophy it would not only be unfair but also incorrect to describe it using English words so I would give an English synonym for it to convey what I mean and then give the correct word for it since there is a spasm between English and sanskrit. I would also request to have an open mind and consider them from a point of view of the actual question rather than understading them from your own preconceived notions. Also, I would like to remind the reader of admitting things that we simply can't know.\n\nMonism and Dualism, as I see it is are a take on the nature of our reality itself i.e. the mind-body dualism or monism. Both have their theistic and atheistic practices but that is for the reader to choose from. Sankhya is a Dualist atheistic aastik philosophy. The question is about the disagreement on the nature of consciousness(Chaitanya) itself.  Consciousness itself is difficult to define but we all intuitively know what it is. The question that separates them is whether consciousness(Chaitanya) is part of the body or not. Monism believes they are English and dualist believe they are different. That would be simplest definition there is though it doesn't fully convey the gravity of the question. I recommend reading more on the Mind-Body problem if you want a much nuanced understanding.\n\nWhen we go on to chart out the history of life itself on earth we face the question where did intelligent life came from, how did we evolve. We have solved how purely atomic forces and energy made up the geological construct of elements and earth but we haven't been able to theorize how these geological changes gave rise to life. That is currently the biggest puzzles of all. Monoism believes that the neurological changes in eventually gave rise to Chaitanya but they don't have concrete evidence of it. Dualists on the other hand believes that Chaitanya and body (that include the brain. I would make another post on philosophy and nature of brain itself according to Sankhya) are different and Chaitanya doesn't arise from the physical nature (everything including atoms itself, a better definition would be the world everything we can sense through the senses. A better term would be Prakriti.). \n\nIntuitively we affirm dualism as is evident from the concept of soul(Atma) but through current scientific temperament, we could say by the same intuition that monism is right. So who is right we cannot say and that too due to lack of evidence rather than an abundance of it. There is a hard problem of Chaitanya and soft problem. The former means how did these chemical and geological substances gave rise to consciousness, the hardware that is. The former is more concerned with how these things interact to give rise to consciousness and how does it work.   \nOne way of understanding yourself is the thought experiment of Ship of Theseus. The problem goes like this, there is a ship with 100 different parts. Every year one part goes bad and is replaced with another new part the old part is kept somewhere safe. After hundred years, all the original parts have been replaced by new ones. Now from the old parts, the ship is reconstructed. The question is which is the ship of Theseus the old one or the new one? As human beings the cells of our body itself are being replaced continuously, even our views and knowledge are being changed. some are being discarded some are being morphed and some are kept there. The dualist interpretation would be that it doesn't matterSanskrit because the thing that makes you you is not whatever material but your own Atma. Time itself is a material construct and shouldn't matter since it arises from prakriti which is ever changing.\n\nWhether you agree or don't with dualism one thing is clear the dualist view on the world is a very powerful tool for humans itself. By separating themselves from the needs and want of the body we create a perspective that results in an eye view of the nature of the self. To understand of yourself you need to separate yourself from your body and understand yourself from the point of view blog posts your consciousness and nothing else since it is the thing that makes you. By adopting it you would be able to see reality as it is rather than what you want it to be.  And that is the biggest strategic advantage you can have no matter if you want happiness, success or something greater than yourself.  \n\n\n[http://dgkl.in/reviving-sankhya-1-monist-vs-dualist/](http://dgkl.in/reviving-sankhya-1-monist-vs-dualist/)"<br />Author: 'srthk'  id: 'bd1dxg'<br />Score:23<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bd1dxg/reviving_sankhya_1_monist_vs_dualist/</li>

Using nukes was not an option. So instead of losing it all they decided to play safe. Plus they could always build new ones in future so they agreed.\n\nKSA literally owned these nukes and was always believed to have been in control of paki arsenal and that is why they never pushed for their own nuke program.Now with almost collapsing paki economy.. threat of eminent Indian attack might have forced their hand\n\n[Saudi, UAE crown princes played ‘commendable’ role in India crisis:\xa0Pakistan](http://www.arabnews.com/node/1460836/world)\n\nBajwa retires in November and he might follow footsteps of this predecessor Raheel Sharif and join KSAs IMCTC for a fat paycheque.

They\'ve lost more territory than ever before, and many areas are now **naxal-free**.\n\n\n\nIn case you\'ve been spending too much time on certain platforms reading garbage propaganda spread by Kambhakts, I would encourage you all to find better sources of information and verify for yourself. All this info is publicly available. Even Wikipedia has it, as does every single person keeping track of defense news. You should really try and find sources that challenge your worldview once in a while.\n\n###I sincerely hope you don\'t give your vote or support to people who play bhai-bhai with terrorists. \n\nIndia is at a **critical** juncture today. Terror is on the back-foot. The fight has been taken to them, and their \'safe-zones\'. They\'re scrambling for money, resources, troops, logistics, training, and support, and we have a SERIOUS chance to deal a fatal blow to terror within India over the next 5-10 years. But if you just ease off for a FEW months/years, by voting in a government that is soft on terrorists, coddling them, giving them security, negotiating with them, and giving them importance, then you\'re giving them time to regroup, to gather money, resources, and cadre, and to attack us all over again.\n\nYou should vote keeping in mind that the next terror victim could be someone YOU care about. I\'ve had 4 major terror attacks in 3 different cities, WHILE I WAS IN THOSE CITIES, during UPA era. They were all places I would often pass by, and where my friends lived/met-up. Dadar. German bakery. Churchgate. Sarojini Nagar. It shakes you up, knowing that you or someone you love could be gone in an instant... \n\n...because a terrorist\'s bomb doesn\'t discriminate, even if you were the nicest person, or a liberal, or a leftist, or an islamist, or a pious Muslim, or a "secular Hindu", or a Sanghi, or a cow-thief, or a vegetarian, or a beef-eater, or a Congressi or a Commie or a BJP voter.\n\n#Stay safe.

Now the real matter is, the muslims who lived in Hindustan, many of them, infact most of them helped in creating pakistan (almost all of the muslims voted for the muslim league to support them in creating pakistan, that\'s how jinnah got support in creating pakistan). That is ok, they (all muslims) voted (to create pakistan), for now that is ok. But now (when the time comes for muslims to emigrate to pakistan), in one day (day after independence), in one night, did they (muslims) have a change in heart? I can\'t understand this how they had a change in heart in one day... (loud cheering by crowd). I still can\'t understand how everyone (muslims) had a change in heart in one day (voted for pakistan but stayed back, he says this three times). But they say, "We are loyal, why are you having doubts in our loyalty? Why are you having suspicion?" But then I say that,"Why are you asking me those questions (about muslims\' loyalty), ask your heart, ask your mind, (about muslims\' loyalty) don\'t ask me!" You can\'t ask that (muslims\' loyalty) to me. He then goes on and disses pakistan and roasts them.\n\ntl;dr: Sardar indirectly questions shady muslims that why are they staying in India if they voted in creating Pakistan.

      <li>Title::: '2018 Exhibition FROM MADRAS TO BANGALORE explores how postcard practices imagined, figured and performed a colonial encounter by depicting cities’ monuments, street, people and places. [Old -2018]'<br />Body: 'Racism and stereotypes in colonial India’s \'Instagram’ (from a BBC article on the exhibit)\n\nIn the early 20th Century, picture postcards served as a kind of Instagram, giving Europeans a glimpse of the life their family and friends led in British colonial India.\n\nA exhibition at London\'s SOAS university showcased more than 300 such postcards that were sent from India to Europe between 1900 and the 1930s.\n\nIt was a popular way to communicate back then - more than six billion postcards passed through the British postal system between 1902 and 1910.\nOne set of postcards belonged to a popular series, called Masters, produced by a Chennai-based publisher in the early 1900s.\n\nIt was meant as a "humorous" comment on the master-servant relationship at the heart of British rule in India, according to the note explaining the postcards. But it also played on "British anxieties" and "insecurities" about what the "servant" would do when the "master" was not around. \n\nAnother Series "The Madras Hunt" showed women looking for lice in each others hair The note accompanying the series explained that these images were staged. In each of them, women are shown searching for head lice. The title, Madras Hunt, juxtaposes what they are doing with the British sport of hunting in an attempt at satire. \n\nThe postcards also reflect how Indians were often stereotyped based on ethnicity, gender, religion or caste.\n\nSome of these photos, such as the one above, were carefully staged in studios, part of a common photographic genre known as the "native type", according to the curators.\n\nIndians performing menial jobs for Europeans were also a common feature of these postcards. \n\nApostcard from Bangalore shows Hindu devotees pulling idols in a wooden chariot as part of an annual procession.\n\nIt was produced from a real photograph and then printed directly onto the back of a blank postcard. The message on the postcard, dated November 1916, reads, "This is another view of a juggernaut car, under which natives used to throw themselves."\n\nHere, juggernaut refers to the Hindu god Jagannath.\nImage copyright Stephen Putnam Hughes and Emily Rose Stevenson\n\nBut curators say that such messages betray a common misunderstanding of Hindu festivals.\n\n"Devotees never threw themselves under these cars," the accompanying note explained. It added that the message was part of a widely held misconception of Hinduism as a "fanatical religion based on blind devotion."\n\n"Decolonisation cannot be done once and for all," Dr Hughes says. "It is a continuous process, and each person has to do it for themselves. We hope that people were able to do that through this exhibition."\n\nInstagram Account [with Postcards](https://www.instagram.com/soaspostcard/)'<br />Author: 'dhatura'  id: 'bccb8k'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bccb8k/2018_exhibition_from_madras_to_bangalore_explores/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Why the Modi Trump comparison is facetious and the real comparison is between Trump and Pappu'<br />Body: 'Many “left” “liberals” and patrician “liberals” (a breed mostly found only in India) often compare Trump to Modi, but on what basis is beyond me. Aside from the fact that both represent the amorphous entity called “The Right” there is not one similarity between them\n\nModi, to use an American expression “pulled himself up by the jockstraps” and is the Yin to the born into privilege Yang of Trump. Modi’s policies have enhanced the protection of women, transgenders and aren’t discriminatory to any caste, religion or sect. \n\nTrump though is known to be divisive and works only for the White American Christian. Modi is a born orator, Trump can barely string 3 coherent cogent sentences together. Modi has the electoral backing of the masses, Trump lost the popular vote. So on and so forth.\n\nThe similarities between Rahul ‘Pappu’ Gandhi and Donald Trump though are uncanny and this should be the comparison that is made. Both were born into wealth and privilege. RG more so than the DT. Both ostensibly got into privileged colleges because of their family connections\n\nBoth are terrible orators, at least DT is a forceful speaker (even if 90% of it is bs), RG has the oratorial skills of a wet puppy, though his handlers clearly have told him to be forceful, and thus all the posturing about folding sleeves etc\n\nBoth lie, they lie, lie and lie. They are Brobdingnagian lie machines (RG has made up 7 different numbers for the Rafale Reliance offset in 7 days), and both have their slavish media houses (Fox for DT and the entire Lutyens ecosystem for RG) that simply lap up this drivel\n\nThey have promised impossible things in election campaigns – Wall and making the Mexicans pay for it for DT and well almost all of what RG says, including the 72k Ponzi scheme and again their pet poodles, the media lap up this drivel unquestioningly\n\nThey have a core votebank, scaling beyond this is well nigh impossible for them. DT has the 30% white Republican core that will vote him no matter what. RG has the approx. 20% “Minority” vote and possibly another 4-5% of the older voters who will vote Cong come hell or highwater \n\nDid I mention that they lie? If they were Pinocchio, their noses would have touched the moon by now and planning a return trip even. Yet all the “fact checking” is reserved only for their opponents. At least DT has a large segment of the media actively arrayed against him. \n\nIn the case of RG it is a case of the Emperor who has no clothes, with courtiers like Rana Ayub, Sardesai, Dutt, the whole of The Liar (sorry, Wire) and an entire ecosystem built up to pretending that RG wears the finest of silks and Muslin (see my thread from yesterday on why)\n\nActually DT is better than RG in many aspects, he is to a large extent, self made politically while Pappu is a serial loser of elections. RG is like if Salil Ankola was made captain of the Indian team only because the Ankola family owned the bats, balls and the grounds. \n\n“Agar first batting nahi to main bat le ke ghar jaoonga” phenomenon is what RG exemplifies. Both have an entire power structure that uses them as cover to get their work done, the Republican party in the US and the Lutyens + Congi ecosystem in India.\n\nBoth work actively only for their core votebanks, which is why RG fled to Wayanad, his core votebank forms nearly 50% of the electorate in Wayanad and thus he is safe while DT spreads a toxic miasma of lies to keep his votebank, the white middle / lower income republican happy\n\nTo even begin to equate Modi with DT betrays either massive ignorance or pushing of an agenda or….why not both? The only real comparison to be made here is between two children of privilege, born into wealth and power and one of them hasn’t worked a single honest day in his life\n\nYou decide who that person is…hint, he is the Hindu Brahmin Muslim Catholic leader, the Vishwatma who embodies so many contradictory things within his one person.'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'bca9zx'<br />Score:96<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bca9zx/why_the_modi_trump_comparison_is_facetious_and/</li>

Pointing to a few Bollywood starts as proof that Muslims have it great in India, is like saying Africans Americans have it good in the US because, you know, Michael Jackson. Intimidation and even murder of journalists, profs and intellectuals in India is increasing. You can get beaten up and harassed for being seen as "anti-national\'. Also the phrase \'missed the train in 1947\' which you seemed to have found hilarious earlier, is, though perhaps you were not aware, an extension of the RSS dogma that all Muslims are traitors and fifth columnists in India, and a more terrible version of that phrase/sentiment "ya Pakistan ya kubristan" (Pakistan or the Grave) was the slogan of the Gujraat massacres in 2002 in which Modi was implicated and because of which he was banned entry in many European countries including the U.K. Modhi himself proudly wears his RSS badge (you do know what the RSS is?). India\'s democracy is in serious crisis (as it is here in the US, Israel, Turkey, Brexit UK etc), and we should encourage productive critiques of the state and nationalists. You should take a look at the speeches of senior BJP leaders like Amit Shah and Yogi Adidyanath who are openly fascist hindu supremacists. Its worse than the KKK here. Take a look at this article in the NYT today... which is why I thought of this video you posted.'<br />Author: 'Buccnastyy'  id: 'bc6xwy'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bc6xwy/i_need_a_good_rebuttal_for_my_pakistani_uncles/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The truth behind the protests of the"Eminent Intellectual"'<br />Body: '100 ‘eminent’ writers and artists return awards, 600 ‘eminent’ filmstars and media personalities pen an open letter asking people to note vote for the ‘politics of hate’- dog whistle for Don’t vote Modi. The same subset also write paeans to the scion of the Nehru Gandhi family. \n\nJust who are these ‘eminent’ ‘intellectuals’ (‘EI’)&amp; why are against what they variously claim to be is the rise of fascism, hate and a hazaar other labels. Why are they so vehemently in support of a 5th generation noble who is the epitome of post colonial aristocracy in India.  \n\nThey position themselves as one of the masses, the proletariat in Marx speak. They identify with the subaltern classes or as representatives of the subaltern classes. Rahul Gandhi’s messaging or that of his illustrious predecessors is clear as is that of the “EI”. \n\n“We are the means through which the poor get a voice, the only way to end poverty and bring to light equality and a socialist utopia”, this is made abundantly clear when Indira yelled Garibi Hatao – As though poverty could be eliminated with one fiat or one stroke of the pen.\n\nModi to them threatens to upend this apple cart and the source of power these ruling classes have always held over the masses from 1947-1991 which is when the door of reforms creaked open, allowing light to come in, fostering the first steps in creating a more equal, meritocracy.\n\nModi’s reforms of the past 4 years though have set them quaking because as a true subaltern, Modi firmly believes in the adage, ‘give a woman a fish, you feed her for a day, teach her to fish and you feed him a lifetime’. His reforms are all about empowering the individual\n\nTake LPG subsidies Modi simply removes the subsidies from those who can afford it, gives the connection for free to the poor then adds the caveat that they need to fend for themselves after the first refill. In essence Modi has given the agency to base human impulse \n\nThis is manifest in so many other reforms of his, be it the SBA where the previous Cong way was to build large public toilets that quickly fell into disuse to constantly including public defecation in his messaging, building toilets at the house level and then trusting human instincts to take charge\n\nThe Congress way was to treat the masses as slightly stupid children, who needed to be spoon fed, washed and tutored day in day out. Modi sees them as equals, as intelligent beings who if given the tools will use them creatively and well and here comes the friction\n\nThe so called voices of the subalterns aren’t that but actually the nobility and aristocracy who have gotten fat sucking on the mammaries of Congressi munificence. Just like the rich aristocrats who faced the guillotine in France or the firing squad in Russia, they are THE SYSTEM\n\nFor decades they have landed plum governmental jobs, advisory roles, jobs as middlemen and brokers in a notoriously inefficient system nurtured by the family of the clown..sorry crown Prince. It was a deeply symbiotic relationship, the Family stayed in power and granted favours \n\nTo the media, industrialists, bureaucrats as a way of continuing to stay in power. If you scratch the backgrounds of many of the “EI”, you will see a deep vein of connections and power broking over decades. Take Nayantara Sahgal, she who cries intolerance so much these days\n\nShe is as landed nobility as it gets, her uncle was Nehru, studied in a posh boarding school in Mussorie (in the 1930’s when literacy rate in India was in the single digits) she &amp; her sister both graduated from a privileged college in the USA, been appointed ambassador to Italy, \n\nShe accepted the Sahitya Academy award from the Rajiv Gandhi govt in 1986 a mere two years after the bloody pogrom of 1984. The Rajiv era saw massive riots, it saw the Hashimpura massacre where Muslims were killed in cold blood by the UP police, \n\nA defamation bill Rajiv wanted passed (but thankfully it did not), Shah Bano, Satanic Verses being banned, Shilanyas allowed as a counter appeasement and in general was an intolerant era to be in. Yet farcially the likes of Sahagal woke up only in 2015 to cry intolerance\n\nLike this if you scratch behind the headlines and the names you would see sordid ties with the state, which in turn simply meant the Dynasty. \n\nIt was a Faustian bargain that these “EI” struck with The Family –give me a house in Lutyens, postings in the diplomatic corps, invites to wine and cheese parties with foreign reporters and the elite chaterrati and I will write paens to your glorious rule\n\nModi is the revolutionary with  the “EI” &amp; the dynasty in the form of RaGa and PrVa the rabid, orthodox counter revolutionaries. Modi has kicked out 1,400 squatters from Lutyens alone, he has ended junkets, he has ended the planning commission \n\nThey hate change, they liked the status quo ante when they lorded it over the peasants, granting favours from their ivory towers. The power to influence &amp; shape news is gone with  rise of social media when some uppity 19 yo from Madurai could point out the lies of these worthies\n\nTherefore every contrarian voice is labelled a “sanghi troll”, so that they could retire from a debate with their dignity intact, happy at having told a ‘troll’, they lack the intellectual honesty to actually debate objectively \n\nTherefore they harken back to a simpler time when everything was peaceful and India the land of milk and honey, not because this was real (it objectively was not), but because they were in charge and their children were guaranteed a bright future only because of nepotism\n\nLike all orthodox reactionaries these EI support the ancien regime which is the Gandhi dynasty in the hopes that once the ancient regime returns, their privileges would get restored and the ancient regime needs its footsoldiers to atleast show a patina of acceptability\n\nFighting these reactionaries are the masses, the true footsoldiers who I hope will go out in droves and metaphorically guillotine the dying ancient regime and its support structure…. translated, get out and vote, the future of our country depends on it.

It should be learnt from 2004 that most people of India sadly don’t really give a fucc about development. The Golden Quadrilateral doesn’t really appeal to most poor, rural people. They are easily seduced by short term small benefits and band aid solutions like farm loan waivers, high subsidies etc.\n\nThis Modi term has also been about deep reforms like Vajpayee’s. The results of some of which haven’t even started showing. While there has been an improvement in ease of doing business, the amount of business done in the country hasn’t shot up significantly, *yet*. Reforms like GST would always mean short term pain but long term gain, we’re still in the short term phase. National Security is over rated from elections point of view, poor people care more for freebies than all these ‘extra’ things. Muslims will never vote for BJP. Jobless folks who are worth nothing and have zero skills will blame Modi for their plight. Add to this Congress’s ₹72k per year promise, you never know how many will buy into it until elections happen. \n\nSome good things that everyone will benefit from is really low inflation, but BJP hasn’t focused much on this in its election campaign. It hasn’t done enough to remind people of the pain of 9-10% during UPA compared to its 3-3.5%, even lower on food.\n\nThis maybe the test of India’s electorate, whether it has matured and realised the importance of long term reforms vis a vis band aid solutions.'<br />Author: 'SakhtLauda'  id: 'bbyecp'<br />Score:54<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bbyecp/is_bjp_actually_going_to_win_like_it_is_widely/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Why has rigidity in Varna system persisted in modern era despite the evidence of it being absent in Rig Vedic times?'<br />Body: 'I came across this article and wondering what you people think of it.\n\n\n\n&gt;Vyäsa, a brahmin sage and the most revered author of many Vedic scriptures including the Vedas, Mahabharata, Bhagavada Gita and Bhagavata Purana, was the son of Satyavati, a sudra woman. Vyäsa’s profound knowledge of the Vedic wisdom established him as a brahmin even though he was born of a sudra mother. Vyäsa’s father, \n\n&gt;Päräsara, was also a son of a candala woman and yet was considered a brahmin based on his Vedic wisdom. \n\n&gt;Another popular Vedic sage, Välmiki was initially a hunter. He came to be known as a brahmin sage on the basis of his profound knowledge of the scriptures and his authorship of the Rämäyana. According to Rig Veda (IX.112.3), the poet refers to his diverse parentage: “I am a reciter of hymns, my father is a physician and my mother grinds corn with stones. We desire to obtain wealth in various actions.” \n\n&gt;Sage Aitareya, author of Aitareya Upanisad, was born of a sudra woman. Vasishtha, son of a prostitute, was established as a brahmin and Rig Veda book VII is attributed to him. In Chandogya Upanisad, the honesty of Satyakäma establishes his brahminhood, even though his ancestry is unknown as he is the son of a maidservant. Visvamitra, born in a ksatriya family becomes a sage, and hence a brahmin, based on his asceticism. Some Rig Veda hymns are attributed to him. The priest Vidathin Bhärdväja became a ksatriya as soon as he was adopted by King Bharata and his descendents were the well-known Bharata ksatriyas. Janaka, a ksatriya by birth, attained the rank of a brahmin by virtue of his ripe wisdom and saintly character and is considered a rajarishi (king-sage). \n\n&gt;Vidura, a brahmin visionary, who gave religious and moral instructions to King Dhrtarashtra, was born to a woman servant of the palace. His varna as a brahmin was determined on the basis of his wisdom and knowledge of scriptures. The Kauravas and Pandavas were the descendants of Satyavati, a fisher-woman, and Vyäsa, a brahmin. \n\n&gt;In spite of this mixed heredity, the Kauravas and Pandavas were known as ksatriyas on the basis of their occupation. Ajamidha and Puramidha were admitted to the status of the brahmin class, and even composed Vedic hymns. Yaska, in his Nirukta, tells us that of two brothers, Santanu and Devapi, one becomes a ksatriya king and the other a brahmin priest. Kavasa, the son of the slave girl Ilusa, becomes a brahmin priest. The Bhagavata Purana tells of the elevation of the ksatriya clan named Dhastru to brahminhood. \n\n&gt;In the later Vedic times, Chandragupta Maurya, originally from the Muria tribe, goes on to become the famous Mauryan emperor of Magadha. Similarly, his descendant, King Asoka, was the son of a maidservant. The Sanskrit poet and author, Kalidasa is also not known to be a brahmin by birth. His works are considered among the most important Sanskrit works.\n\n&gt; In the medieval period, saint Thiruvalluvar, author of ‘Thirukural’ was a weaver. Other saints such as Kabir, Sura Dasa, Ram Dasa and Tukaram came from the sudra class also. Many of the great visionaries in modern India were not brahmins by birth but can be regarded as brahmins by their life-styles and teachings: Mahätmä Gändhi, Swämi Vivekänada, Sri Aurobindo, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Swämi Chinmayänanda etc.\n\n\n[Source](https://huffpost.com/us/entry/us_877981?adsSiteOverride=in&amp;ir=India)'<br />Author: 'doc_four_twenty'  id: 'bbp7uw'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bbp7uw/why_has_rigidity_in_varna_system_persisted_in/</li>

Don't you agree?"<br />Body: 'For example, when CNN or BBC reports about a certain news about liberal democracies like India or Brazil, they have no problem in attacking the govt or various communities in the country. **It\'s because they know that they can get away with it**; these countries won\'t ban them from entering the country in the future. Will Western media do the same when reporting about China, Russia or Middle Eastern countries? \n\nAnother example, an NGO linked to Reuters reported that India is the worst country for women, while USA is the 10th worst. Even an illiterate knows that most of the Middle East have far draconian laws that make life more miserable for women than in India. But these NGOs won\'t dare to show that data, because they don\'t want to be accused of being racist or Islamophobe.\n\nIndians need to realize this double-standard and call liberal Western media and NGOs out. These people have a mentality of "*China, Africa and Islamic countries are so different from us, so we need to be friendly in order to get closer. Whereas, countries like India and Brazil are similar to us, so we should be critical of them in order for them to become more like us".*\n\nIt\'s such a twisted mindset that only internally destroys liberal democracies. Indians need to come out and tell these Western liberals that ***"We are not like you, in fact we detest you and if you keep treating us unfairly, we\'ll ban you from doing anything in our country, just like Autocracies and Theocracies do".***'<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'bbmmva'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bbmmva/indias_open_and_liberal_culture_is_actually/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'A few tips for you guys before getting a fiber internet connection.'<br />Body: "Recently we've been witnessing alot of fibercable companies which provide high speed data connection at cheap rates along with tempting data packs. Over the course of previous year I've changed my connection almost 4 times. Here are few tips from my side:\n\n1. Don't go for Unlimited data offers if the cost is substantially high. Unless you've to torrent alot video games and watch every damn video on 4k.\n\n2.  Don't buy the modems from the Isp. They generally overpriced the modem that you could actually get for almost 300 bucks cheaper if bought online. \n\n3. Always go for the lesser known services.( except jio ). The lesser known Isps will not have alot of traffic on there servers and can provide you with better speeds than a well known Isp in that area. Generally the subscriber count of the well known Isp exceeds the bandwidth owned by them. Hence it results in horrendous speeds incase the traffic is high.  They're not going to buy more bandwidth just because us customers are getting 30 to 40 percent less than what the company claimed.\n\n4. Don't get fooled by the oakla speed test. Most of the times they're going to set it on their home server and show you a whopping speed of 100 mbps.  But in actual the speeds you're getting are poorer than the 5 mbps broadband airtel connection. This happens because of throttling. \n\n5. Throttling is when the Isps alot more bandwidth to certain websites such as Youtube or Facebook and that is compensated by providing less to other websites. You'll might've wondered that videos tend to load slower on other websites than compared to youtube.  Well there's alot more to it than throttling but nonetheless it plays a major role in it. \n\n6. Lastly, never refrain from being on their ass for every damn issue. Be it refund ,low speeds, connectivity issues. I pretty much forced my Isp into securing my bandwidth .( this means that my connection will not experience reduced speeds incase of high traffic. It has been established in they're servers. The burden will go down to other subscribers.)"<br />Author: '_divyanshj_'  id: 'bbjl57'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bbjl57/a_few_tips_for_you_guys_before_getting_a_fiber/</li>

RAW spotted him during a theatre play where they are impressed by his acting skills and thought he\'d make a good spy as he was very convincing. Do you know which Indian real spy was spotted by RAW this way? Ravindra Kaushik. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nfrom Wikipedia, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra\\_Kaushik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Kaushik)\n\n&gt;Kaushik displayed his talent at the national level dramatic meet in [Lucknow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow), [Uttar Pradesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh), which was witnessed by officials from the [Research and Analysis Wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_Analysis_Wing) (RAW), India\'s external intelligence agency. He was contacted and offered a job of being an [undercover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undercover) Indian agent in Pakistan. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHeck, they even based on the appearance of their guy on Kaushik. \n\n[https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EdPn7W6Djm0/maxresdefault.jpg](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EdPn7W6Djm0/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut in the movie, his name is Romeo Ali? I mean. He\'s a Muslim Why?\n\nSecondly, the director takes the movie in a direction where Romeo\'s cover is blown. RAW decides to eliminate him, and the head of the spy network in Pakistan gives orders to kill him. The character goes through a bunch of emotions where he feels isolated by his country.  As a result, the director also takes the audience through these emotions. However, it is decided by higher-ups that Romeo will "play" a role in dismantling the Indian spy network in Pak so he can gain the trust of Pakis and infiltrate them. The RAW chief gives him the order to do so. \n\nRomeo goes on to blow the cover of the spy network, the head of which, **a Hindu,** shown constantly with a mala and a holy book, commits suicide to prevent any divulsion of secrets under torture. While we are taken through a range of emotions when Romeo is threatened, only threatened, when the Hindu guy is killed and it just passes as a fleeting occurrence with no regard of how the RAW chief and Romeo were totally okay with killing their entire spy network.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo top it off, we are given Bollywood\'s dose of seemingly familiar Hindu-Muslim couples. Every time it\'s the girl that\'s Hindu and guy that\'s Muslim. Kedarnath, Raazi and now this. I do not even question the joke of two RAW agents having to make out in a car in Pakistan, where such things are frowned upon and could blow their cover coz hey, creative liberties. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd finally, no mention of Ravindra Kaushik. All the biopics, Sanju, Kesari had creative liberties but at least they conceded they were based on True events but this film? Naah.

Because the ordinary Indian psyche is to think of everything outside one\'s own home as "not mine". People might have the right connections and get great jobs in civil services and feed their own family all the way to a very prosperous life, but they have a total disconnection to everything outside what is "theirs". Moral and ethical education in schools will of course help, but any child will inevitably adapt the behavior of their parents and peers as well, and the chances of such negative civic behavior to continue is high as long as the child sees people continue to get away with these petty ethical crimes (same as watching someone escape with a bribe, "inspires" another to give a bribe).\n\nBut once you know you are being watched, you will at the least - ahem - know you are being watched. But if a few are apprehended, fined and adequately shamed by authorities, most, if not all will think twice before doing something that causes public inconvenience in day-to-day matters.\n\nWhat do you think?'<br />Author: 'throwawayphilos'  id: 'bb7s3i'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bb7s3i/are_cameras_the_only_way_to_prevent_indians_from/</li>

Nuance be  damned.  \n   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Just so you know, all Indian parties are to some extent economically  left-wing, all of them are to some extent socially conservative.  \n   \n   \n   Our  parties differentiate themselves through their strategies to address  colonial trauma - some are focused on cultural revivalism, some on  self-respect for indigenous philosophies, some promote parochial,  regional, or subaltern interests, and some on enriching their founders.  \n   \n   \n   This  impression that the "liberal-conservative" divide in postcolonial  societies is somehow analogous to Western politics is either projection  by Western media and academics or ...  \n   \n   \n   ... a  reflection of the deracination and mental colonisation of the Anglicised  postcolonial elite, who act as the West\'s interlocutors to a set of  indigenous cultures and languages they perceive as inferior.  \n   \n   \n   It\'s  not taxi drivers whose jobs are at risk from self-driving cars in India,  it\'s English-media journalists who will be rendered unemployed, as  their only window into the political or cultural views of India is  conversations with the driver who picked them up from the airport.  \n   \n   \n   If it  were the case that these people genuinely cared about the left or  liberal cause, and genuinely felt that they can\'t relate to Indian  culture enough to be a part of politics in India, fair enough. Go to the  UK, join a party, fight an election. Move to NY, write for the NYT.  \n   \n   \n   If they did that, we would have respect for them, as we do for Dadabhai Naoroji.   \n   \n&gt;  \n&gt;But the reality is, they won\'t do that. They can\'t do that.  \n   \n&gt;  \n&gt;They are only useful to Western liberals as compradors and fixers who help them navigate Indian politics, history, or culture.  \n   \n   \n   They can only get a column in the Graun, BBC, or WaPo if it\'s to shame other Indians and rob them of agency.  \n   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Their awards for their journalism in India are merely pats on the head  for being pliant. If they were actually respected, they would be  entrusted with UK/US politics.  \n   \n   \n   As  soon as they stop toing the line or try to engage with politics in the  West the way they report on India, they are brutally cut down to size.  They don\'t get to host debates on CNN or the BBC.

Vyakaran is a distilled abstraction of language meant for only a few people, not everyone. \n\n&gt; Freebies, waivers, sarkari naukris and reservation are drugs.

We might mock them and they might be cretins but he has advisors of the Calibre of P Chidambaram and Amartya  Sen and unlike Pappu, they definitely have the intellect to cover all bases. \n\nThe most conservative estimates put this NYAY dole at 3l crores. Now if you bench mark that against our current govt expenditure it would be close to the 20% mark. \n\nHowever, what if you stall this saying procedural issues etc, our tax receipts, esp direct taxes have constantly gone up. It was at around 6l crores in 2013 and is now around the 10l crore mark now. A 40% increase in 6 years. \n\nEven tracking at the same rate and with the higher base and larger economy, by 2022 itself (and only half way into this assumed tenure), direct taxes alone would be around the 12.5l mark, keeping current expenses as is, maybe a marginal increase in taxes (as Sam Pitodourant already clarified) by 2022, Pappu can easily fund this scheme without busting the fiscal deficit. \n\nThe big fuck up here is, he will fuck up capital expenditure on infra, defense and other less sexy stuff for a scheme which would be self perpetuating. The Moment you flood the economy with 12k /family for the poorest, they stop being the poorest and the next set 21-40% lot would fill into the slot which would mean the budget for this would necessarily keep expanding. \n\nOr it's a Jumla and Pappu &amp; co plan on cutting current subsidies and replace it with this one scheme. \n\nThing to be noted here is, handed a buoyant economy by Vajpayee the Barmaid did exactly this. Front loaded the economy with massive (for then) subsidies like farm loan waiver, massive increase in MSP, MNREGA. Only issue here is, this is not effective structurally and will collapse the moment there are some external stresses on the economy as happened in UPA 2. \n\nPappu is like the guy who is taking out a massive loan today (as he is seeing good annual increments) and then investing it on coke and hookers, short term gratification yes but a disaster in even the medium term. \n\nHope this insidious scheme is roundly defeated.

Like someone was given a job and he did it for the money. Same with the organisation of content in the PDF. Congress\' PDF, is overflowing horizontally. LOL. This tells you of lack of professionalism. \n\n* BJP doesn\'t use highlight at all. Congress highlights the fck out of the document. It is almost reading like someone\'s notes. It is clearly written by a journalist, who must have told to do bold and orange to enhance impact. lmao. I can already imagine the meeting room scenario. \n\n* Congress headlines as "it will deliver". Starts off with an Aashvaasan. Its a weak position. BJP doesn\'t do any extra sloganeering and aashvaasan. Keeps it contained. The use of photos and bubble boxes is also kept to minimum by BJP. Congress overdoes it. Congress wants to IMPRESS with its agenda, BJP wants to EXPRESS its agenda. \n\n* As far as content is concerned Parties give off their main agenda quite clearly. The language and usage of words is fairly consistent. \n\n* BJP focusses on possibilities and gives specifics in terms of numbers. Congress focusses on schemes and keeps it rather vague. It is evident that BJP document is prepared by people who know their stuff, Congress document is prepared by journalists and bureaucrats.\n\n* There is special part of Congress given to "Art", NDTV had one day taken interviews from "Artists". They are targetting darbari and wannabe artists. LOL. Congress focusses on "Artists and their funds". BJP focusess on "Culture". Massive difference.\n\n* Congress has a separate section for Media. Seriously, who the fck cares about Media ? Apart from media people. \n\n* Congress manifesto is full of total liberand stuff copied from West.

      <li>Title::: '[Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Bangladesh-Myanmar tensions, Italy joins BRI, and Star Wars'<br />Body: 'Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Biweekly Geopolitics Thread. Here, we can discuss happenings from around the world - even things not related to India. Here are a few stories to get the conversation started:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Top 3 stories from India\'s neighbourhood:\n\n1. [US Afghan envoy visits Islamabad](https://www.voanews.com/a/us-envoy-discusses-afghan-peace-with-pakistani-leaders/4863808.html)\n\nThe US envoy to negotiate an end to the war in Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, visited Islamabad and met civilian and military officials. Khalilzad has held five rounds of talks with the Taliban that did not include an representative of the Afghan government. Earlier this year, the National Security Adviser of Afghanistan condemned the talks and accused Khalilzad of trying to become a viceroy-like power after the Taliban is allowed to topple Afghanistan\'s government. His remarks invited a sharp rebuke from the US.\n\n2. [Trump administration may designate IRGC as a terrorist organization](http://time.com/5565722/trump-calls-iran-revolutionary-guard-terrorist-group/)\n\nThe Trump administration appears to be ready to designate Iran\'s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, an elite military entity with significant economic and business interests in Iran, as a terrorist organization, a move that will have a big economic and diplomatic effect on Iran. The Corps was set up as a sort of parallel military organization after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and has ties to Shia militant groups across the region, notably Lebanon\'s Hebzollah. Iran has vowed to strike back in case the move materialises.\n\n3. [Bangladesh deploys paramilitary in disputed island](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/04/08/asia-pacific/bangladesh-deploys-border-guards-island-near-myanmar-first-time-since-1997/#.XKrJGyiYVuQ)\n\nFor the first time in 20 years, Bangladesh deployed paramilitary troops to St Martin\'s island in the Bay of Bengal, its southernmost territory, after Myanmar published maps showing the island as part of its territory. Until 1937, Myanmar (then Burma) was part of British India, but after it was separated, the island became part of India and then Pakistan in 1947, and then Bangladesh in 1971. Tensions remain high as Myanmar\'s border guards have previously attacked fishermen off the island. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Top 3 stories from the world:\n\n1. [Netanyahu pledges to annex West Bank settlements](https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710799152/ahead-of-israeli-election-netanyahu-pledges-to-annex-west-bank-settlements)\n\nIn comments being interpreted as a *brahmastra* in the ongoing elections in Israel, incumbent PM Benjamin Netanyahu told a news channel that if re-elected, his government will annex Jewish settlements in the Palestinian-controlled West Bank that cover a significant amount of territory. No country in the world, including the US, recognizes there settlements, but the Trump administration\'s recent moves in Jerusalem and the Golan Heights may provide the best climate to annex over a quarter of the West Bank. The move would effectively end any possibility of a two-state solution, ever.\n\n2. [Italy joins Belt &amp; Road Initiative](https://qz.com/1572243/italy-to-sign-up-for-chinas-belt-and-road-project/)\n\nDespite dire warnings from the EU and the US, Italy became the first European country to join China\'s BRI project, in a stunning reversal of about two years of bad news for the initiative that has sparked accusations of a neo-colonial land grab in Kenya, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia. The agreement, signed during Chinese dictator Xi Jinping\'s visit, includes a vast array of MoUs to cooperate in everything from infrastructure to banking and even media. \n\n3. [Air strikes in Libyan capital may spark a new civil war](https://www.vox.com/world/2019/4/7/18299388/libya-crisis-tripoli-air-strikes-armed-conflict)\n\nThe Libyan capital of Tripoli was rocked by air strikes launched by the Libyan National Army (LNA) of General Khalifa Haftar, who returned to the country from exile in the US after former dictator Muammar Qaddafi was deposed in 2011. The LNA controls large parts of Eastern Libya and rejects the internationally-recognized Government of National Accord that runs the country on paper, although effective control rests with the many militias in cities. The fighting led to oil prices reaching a five-year high, and the UN Secretary General as well as US troops having to be evacuated from Tripoli. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: Star Wars\n\nThe advent of nuclear weapons significantly changed warfare in the modern era. Before they became a reality, war was a profitable business for the winning side as long as it could limit the fighting to its borders and not suffer significant damage to its own cities. Nuclear weapons changed all that - a single weapon could ground an entire city and make war a lose-lose proposition, in a system called Mutually Assured Destruction  (MAD). Some have argued that MAD is the system that has ensured that World War III hasn\'t happened (yet). \n\nStill, not everybody is a fan of MAD. One such critic was former US President Ronald Reagan, who derided MAD as a suicide pact and created the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) as a result. The SDI was a program that would place anti-ballistic missile weapons in space to make it impossible for any country to deliver a nuclear warhead into the US, effectively negating MAD. The technological scale of this was vast: laser and particle weapons, ground- and space-based weapons, new high performance computing systems, and a completely new research framework. And while much progress was made, the initiative never reached its conceived targets. \n\nSDI faced severe criticism within the US, with prominent US Senator Ted Kennedy (of the famous Kennedy dynasty) dubbing it "Star Wars" (after the movie) and as a threat to global security. After the Soviet Union collapsed, support for the program declined, and ended completely in 1993. However, many of the technological advances from the program were migrated, with systems like THAAD and an experimental laser weapon being used by the US military, and possibly many more being classified as the US aims to build a Space Force.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat stories from the world caught your attention?

      <li>Title::: '5 year Rewind - What it looked like AND what it really meant.'<br />Body: '* When BJP was sweeping that election, my office people had placed a projector for us to see it all. There was procession outside in Ahmedabad. "Acche Din were there".\n\n* Within a year, many in my office started saying that govt. has gone nuts with Beef Ban. They gave me reasons that it is a cheap and best source of protein, they gave me reasons that everybody ate beef before some late vedic age revolution. They cried Brahminism. I lost some "friends" to idiocy.\n\n* Was never interested in politics. Facebook was a place for bakchodi, and Quora was place for mythology and erudition. It was on facebook when they started shoving their judgments on Swadeshi Indology, they rebuked every claim by saying "woah, vimanas are flying, Ganesha plastic surgery, lol".\n\n* Then came Kanhaiya/JNU stuff. Having grown up in the same area, the event was incredible. How the whole liberandu mind took those illiterate PhD students seriously. For kids like us, JNU was a place to "stay cheap in Delhi" to prepare for UPSC. People taking JNU seriously was a serious matter. I lost more "friends" to idiocy. \n\n* By now the internet has blown up. Every one was up in arms, I could see people sharing and reading stuff which was once a hobby reserved for amateur historians. People were reading Avesta, they were reading Chanakya Neeti. Everything was up for question. True Indology appears, bulldozes every wrong claim one by one, took away all credibility of eminent historians overnight. Something which Shourie tried for years. Internet ushered an era of rediscovery. This chaos rattled dumb journalists to proclaim post-truth. This chaos rattled weak-hearts who thought MODI was doing this.  \n\n* No. Modi was not doing this. The Hindu resurgence was due, it is currently ongoing, we are all part of it. Modi is just a part of it. The political face of it. Defining times throw up defining people like Modi and True Indology. In resistance to this chaos, was the resistance. Resistance came in the form of nostalgic utopia. As if the 90s, 2000s were some golden era, where cricketers were gods and Shahrukh was darling, and "Friends" was the show. Where Hindus-Muslims live in syncretism. Some kids held onto that nostalgic utopia, those kids are randians.\n\n* Now the chaos has flipped the definitions for liberals and conservatives. Thats why those holding tightly to their childhood lies are "liberals", while those who are brave enough to face any grim reality are "conservatives". These "conservatives" are leading a part of majority to a place where they can start to make some sense. \n\n* Modi meanwhile, did his job just like he did in Gujarat. There is nothing new. He is the same damn good administrator. I had felt that when I first went from Delhi to Ahmedabad. They said Riverfront was his idea. The riverfront was my favorite place to chill out. I also made everyone see the dashboard Piyush Goyal had made to see the electification progress. The dashboard was coded in latest framework, makkhan. \n\n* The period of chaos also created a lot of distrust. Because suddenly people lost trust in what they read, what they saw. Media lost credibility. But those vultures used it to their own advantage to say "we are the carriers of truth in this era of misinformation". Chor machaye shor. \n\n* The Internet also caused people to form connections with major political movements worldwide. "Smash Brahminical Patriarchy" to "Tulsi Gabbard is Hindu". There are some global trends too. In this era of massive information it is tough to carry out your work quitely. If we take that into account, Modi has done a really good job. The noise of lynchings, darre hue musalman is just noise. The signal is that one lynching on the ground can be magnified 10x on internet and can be made 100x by tags and algorithms. Same cannot be said about the good things, positive things do not scale by the same measure. Positive things compound slowly and blow up much later. \n\n* We are just halfway. Indian renaissance was not in 1800s with Sati etc. The Indian Renaissance is happening now. Bharatiya Punarjagrati.

      <li>Title::: "Caste explained by Yudhisthira in Mahabharata's Vana Parva (Section CLXXIX)"<br />Body: "As\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff a result of being cheated by the Kauravas in the dice game, the Pandavas had\ufeff to spend thirteen years in exile. During this period they travelled far and \ufeffwide visiting various places of pilgrimage and getting association of sages and saints who lived in forests. They also spend some time in the forests of\ufeff Vishakhayupa at the foothills of the Himalayas on the banks of the river Saraswati.\n\nBhima would often venture into the deep forests and there in a\ufeff\ufeff sporting spirit, he would uproot huge trees, kill ferocious animals and crush\ufeff giant peaks. \n\nOnce, while wandering in this way Bhima encountered Nahusha and\ufeff was promptly captured by the huge python. The mighty \ufeffBhima, with the strength\ufeff of ten thousand elephants, found himself powerless in \ufeffthe grips of the snake.\ufeff\n\nBecause of his prior exalted position, Nahusha had complete recollection of his\ufeff previous life and understood that Bhima was his descenda\ufeffn\ufefft.\n \ufeff\n\nHowever being extremely hungry and under the force of the envious snake-like mentality, he prepared to eat Bhima.\ufeff\n\n\nAt this time, Yudhisthira also came upon the scene a\ufeffnd requested Nahusha to\ufeff\ufeff free his brother. Nahusha then said that only if Yudhisthira correctly answers his questions would he free Bhima. \n\nThis conversation gives a very clear understanding of the system of Varna (caste system) as explained in the scriptures, specifically in regards to the position of a brahman.\n\n\ufeff \n\nNahusha: Who is a brahman?\n\nYudhisthira: One who posses the qualities of truthfulness, charity, forgiveness, good conduct, mercy, and who observes the duties of the brahmans should be considered to be a brahman.\n\nNahusha: These qualities could be conceivably found in a sudra also.\n\nYudhisthira: If these qualities are found in a sudra, then he should be considered to be a brahman. It is the actual possession of these qualities that \ufeffmake a person a brahman and the lack of them makes the person a sudra.\ufeff\n\nNahusha the\ufeffn challenged: O King if the caste of a person is determined by qualities alone and not by birth, then how can the caste of a child be determined?\n\nYudhisthira: One cannot be considered to belong to any varna (caste) by birth.\n\nActually every one is a sudra at the time of birth. Until a person is initiated by a bona-fide Acharya, he must be considered a sudra, no matter how exalted his birth is. \n\nFrom a practical point of view since people of different castes inter-marry, the caste of their offspring's will always be in doubt. Only after the appearance of these qualities, or their lack of, can the determination be made if a person is a brahman or not.\n\nSyammbhavu Manu has said, 'Anyone from a\ufeff lower or mixed caste, who has become purified by the reformatory process is superior to one born in a brahman family but who has fallen down from conduct suitable for the order.' Thus it is solely by qualities and not by birth that one should be considered to a brahman, ksatriya, vaishya or sudra.\n\n \ufeff\n\nNahusha was extremely pleased to hear his questions answered correctly. With this the curse of Agastya Muni also came to an end and assuming an effulgent \ufeffform, Nahusha after giving many benedictions to the Pandavas, returned to his heavenly abode.\ufeff\n\n[Source 1](https://www.indiadivine.org/content/topic/1239247-thought-of-the-week-yudhisthira-and-nahusha/)\n\n[Source 2](http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03179.htm)\n\n[Source 3 - Section CLXXIX](http://mahabharataonline.com/translation/mahabharata_03179.php)"<br />Author: 'Anti_Anti_Nacional'  id: 'bad96g'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bad96g/caste_explained_by_yudhisthira_in_mahabharatas/</li>

It might be a possible explanation as to why relationships at time ends in tears. if we\'re to study the evolution of a society through Tribes and Civilizations, it\'d be clear to us that the "sexual cost" has always been of paramount importance in deciding roles assigned to genders.\n\nEarly tribes used to fight each other a lot and it\'s been passed down to men through history. people today might look back and say that the ancients weren\'t treating men and women equally but they weren\'t supposed to. let\'s understand why. \n\nsuppose you have two tribes, both with equal number of men and women and a total population of 50 each. Tribe A has 20 fighters and all of them are men. tribe B has an equal amount of men and women fighters with 10 each. they engage in a battle and loses 50% of warrior population. this means that Tribe A now has 25 women and 15 men and Tribe B has 20 men and 20 women. in a longer run, Tribe A will be able to produce more kids than tribe B because of those extra 5 females, thus ensuring a better probability of survival. this, in essence is sexual cost and why men were chosen to fight the wars.\n\nnow let\'s talk of trust. in a battlefield, you\'re to trust the one fighting along with you as much as you trust your own senses. Blind faith, complete trust...you can call it whatever you want but it\'s necessary to have it as a trait if you\'re to survive and win. because of this, men used to develop this trust factor and they always believed that it\'ll be reciprocated back.\n\nWomen, on the other hand didn\'t require this trait for survival. their primary job was to produce and take care of progeny and her family. this resulted in a subconscious picking of family over everything else. it resulted in sacrificing pleasure for self but that is already covered in my paradox of partner. the wiring was oriented towards family and they adapted accordingly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnow, people don\'t admit to it but we haven\'t changed that much from those times. when you have that young love flowing through your veins and you feel that you\'ll give up everything for that one particular girl, know that there\'s a very good chance that it might not be reciprocated back. her instincts and upbringing will make her choose her family over you when it comes down to choosing between you or her family. should you blame her for it? i don\'t think so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nit\'s you who played the game without understanding rules of it. you made your bed, now you have to lay in it. you did what was instinctive to you and she did what came instinctively to her. is she sad that she had to make this choice? yes she is, but know that it\'ll be over once she starts a family of her own. and i don\'t blame her. that\'s just the way it is.\n\nit may seems that i\'m putting things up in binaries and that there are exceptions to this rule. your friend\'s or some celeb\'s story might be different to yours but see to it that i\'m telling you the general rule. there will always be exceptions but they should be treated as such. \n\nWhat should you do then? first, stop hating her for things that transpired. i won\'t comment on whether to keep your anger or let go of it but i\'d say use it constructively. i would say this though, be the keystone to your arch, the kabba to your mecca. if you\'re valuing someone over yourself, sooner or later...you\'ll fall to depths you don\'t even want to dream of.\n\n.................................................................................................................................................\n\nsee to it that it\'s my personal theory and i believe in it because i\'ve seen a lot of evidence supporting it through the years. i share it here because i feel comfortable doing. if you have any questions, criticism or suggestions....feel free to share it. \n\n '<br />Author: 'thesharkbreed_reborn'  id: 'ba50jo'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ba50jo/a_personal_theory_about_relationships_and_how_we/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'They want the best - but not necessarily from the best universities'<br />Body: 'If you look into immigration protocols of the most immigration friendly nations (relatively), you\'ll notice a trend.\n\nThese countries (like Canada, Australia, US, Europe), are looking for someone with above average to smooth language capability, reasonable experience and sought after skills.\n\nIn all practicality, I\'ve been comparing immigration to a company\'s recruitment process - where they take ready made citizen (of another country) as their own, instead of putting the effort to raise one of their own. Ofcourse they do, but to cover for the gap. \n\nIt is often a misnomer that "The best brains go abroad - like IIT, NIT or highly skilled people" - Nah, that\'s absolute bullshit.\n\nJust like a company, selections are based on who apply for the position, our best brains don\'t always pick these countries. For every IITian who\'d apply, you\'d see atleast 9 regular Indians applying. Some of them sub-par on these skills on most scales.\n\nAnd yet they may have the same success ratio, as long as they fill the check boxes. \n\nHow would these people who get selected in the immigration process do, if they were to stay back in India?\n\nIMO, they\'d do pretty bad actually. Even with a large population - which would mean a large requirement within India, our own population almost instantly fills up the job requirement. \n\nSo does that mean the outgoing Indian immigrants are sub-par compared to the ones in India? IMO, it is mixed, so Yes and No. \n\nIn most of these countries, even an average person can shine bright like a star - because of equal-er opportunity, lesser population. Regular life\'s challenges still exist - nepotism (working against them), racism, daily challenges, etc. So, they are no more, so much sub-par anymore.\n\nIn India, even the relatively brighter ones gets over shadowed due to the stiff competition, politics, social norms, and lack of any nurturing environment. So, all that bright dims quite rapidly. \n\nWhile I would like to ask my people to introspect in every turn about what kind of people they are nurturing, I understand as of now, there is little mind-space for this in society.\n\nLabels,  background, pedigree, and non-skill based affiliations are of prime importance, more than anything, right?'<br />Author: 'metaltemujin'  id: 'ba4ixu'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ba4ixu/they_want_the_best_but_not_necessarily_from_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Hinduism vs Hindutva'<br />Body: "Today morning when I woke up, I had gotten a news article in my notification which was about the same topic and needless to say that when I opened the article, I was utterly disappointed. I tried to look up for the writer on social medias and to no avail but what I found was that her article was being shared by US based 'Dalit groups'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince, it's first day of Chaitra Navratri today, I was asked by mother whether I wan to fast or not; till few days ago, i had read about only religious benefits of fasting, but then I saw Nasim Nicholos taleb retweet something which was about Ekadashi and how Indians, when they abandoned this habit of fasting on Ekadashi, they started getting diabetes; there were other habits too but this was the major one....So, I told my mother I'm fasting today...I don't believe that I'm going to heaven for this but it gave me much time to think about the article and why they do what they do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm pondering over the content of the article and I realized something important. This article was not just a lone attack on 'Hindutva' instead it was a multi directional approach of attacking dharma from all sides and why do I say this. If you remember the Ramayan we used to watch as kids when the sage Vashisth goes to the palace of King Dashrath, he asks the king to hand over his kids to him so that sage can train them and then they will defend the Rishi from asuras while he is performing Yajna. Asuras were always trying to disrupt the Yajna for one simple reason that they hated Dharma and good deeds; So, The princess who went there to defend the Rishi were basically practicing Hindutva i.e; to defend the dharma and not necessarily practicing it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday when people say things like Hinduism is different and Hindutva is different....of course it is. Hinduism is for bettering of Humanity, Hindutva is to save Hinduism so that it can do better for Humanity. When Shashi Tharoor and likes of them want to decouple Hinduism from Hindutva, what they are necessarily saying is that 'If Asuras come to your place and throw blood and flesh in your Yajna pind, you don't object to that and defend yourself. you shut up, stop your Yajna and do some other time when Asuras are asleep because trying to use weapon to defend yourself will make you a Hindutva person'. Savarkar might have given the name Hindutva in 19th century and made this movement mainstream but this was always there and will always be there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarlier I said that it's a multi directional approach of attacking Dharma....so at one hand they say Hinduism and Hindutva are different and on other hand they attack Brahmins viciously. I'm no Brahmin but one thing I have understood over period of time is that they don't have problems with Brahmins but whole Hinduism itself and they see Brahmins as big obstacle. So, attacking Hindutva because it defends Hinduism even when the person may not necessarily practice it, and attacking Hinduism in the name of attacking Brahminism. Based on the level of bigotry, modern day asuras(you will find most of them in famous India sub) keep attacking different aspects of Hindu Dharma. Stand up for it. You won't believe but I'm an atheist and I might not remain anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was my thought which came to my mind in morning  after reading that article and now I got time to put them in words. I don't want to put that article here to increase their traffic so don't ask me about it.  Please crosspost this to relevant subs and if possible, copy and paste it in the sub of Asuras as well. If this kind of argument has been posted here earlier...I apologize for missing that but this needed to be said. Thanks for reading. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl:dr; Save it, read it later.

      <li>Title::: 'The lies of Dhruv Rathee -On Rafale he has 7 lies in 8 mins! If he were Pinocchio, his nose would have touched the moon by now'<br />Body: 'Lie # 1 - at around the 2:33 mark, @dhruvrathee says that India had the option to build the Rafale entirely without any assistance because of ToT. \n\nThis is either an outright lie or very poor understanding of the facts, the same facts that he promises to get into. \n\n* As per the DP (framed by the UPA), even assembling from a SKD or CKD is considered ToT. In other words, an Ikea like putting together of a jet = ToT. *DPP Appendix G, pp 128.*\n\n* There is no way we know what the technology on offer was as that is highly classified. So to say that we could just manufacture these planes is disingenuous at best. \n\nLie by omission - at around 3:00, Rathee says simply that negotiations went on for long and the govt changed.   He gives the impression that the disagreements were simple and just time consuming. \n\nLie! The UPA / HAL and Dassault couldn\'t even agree on price, quality and delivery timelines guarantees of 108 planes to be built by HAL(HAL asking for 2.8 times man hours required by Dassault\xa0 for making 1 Rafale hence raising costs(by 150 crores per plane) and MOD wanted the Dassault\xa0 to take quality guarantees of 108 planes to be built by HAL which Dassault flat out refused. \n\nSo let me repeat, the "disagreements"that Rathee talks about so casually included every single element from pricing to HAL product quality guarantees. \n\nThe end result? Literally nothing of substance was even arrived at, let alone signed on. \n\nThe "workshare agreement" Rathee talks about? Well it was nothing but an agreement on the configuration of the aircraft (the UPA took 2 years to just arrive at the config) and a formal acceptance from Dassault that HAl would manufacture 108 platforms. \n\nLie # 3 - @ around the 4:00 mark, Dhruvrathee says that the Ccs didn\'t approve the deal. \n\nLie. [in the docs submitted to the SC it emerged that the CCS was fully involved in the decision making process and approved it before it was put into action](https://m.economictimes.com/news/defence/records-show-ccs-approval-to-key-rafale-decisions/articleshow/66469933.cms)\n\nFurthermore, Para 71 of DPP-2013 on Inter-Government Agreement (IGA) states that “there may be occasions when procurements would have to be done from friendly foreign countries which may be necessitated due to geo-strategic advantages that are likely to accrue to the country. Such procurements would not classically follow the Standard Procurement Procedure and the Standard Contract Document but would be based on mutually agreed provisions by the Governments of both the countries. Such procurements will be done based on an Inter-Governmental Agreement after clearance from the Competent Financial Authority (CFA)”. The CFA for procurement cases valued at more than Rs 1000 crores was the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) during the DPP 2013.\n\nWhat does this mean? According to the the rules framed by the UPA itself (and later questioned by the UPA), if it is an IGA, standard practices could be exempt including the clearance from the CCS. \n\nMr Rathee here is lying through his teeth or is poorly informed. Am really not sure. Moving on,\n\nLie #4 - @ 5:00 he slips in a casual point that the configuration of the aircraft in the new and old deal is the same. Implying that the aircraft is the same. \n\nExcept... Not true at all, a sample of the enhancements the platform will have in the new deal\n\n* Upgraded Sigma 95 INS (using the India developed GPS equivalent)\n\n* Upgraded AESA radar. \n\n* Upgraded m88-4e engines\n\n* Towed decoy system\n\n* Upgraded Spectra EWS \n\n* Targo 2 helmets\n\n* meteor bvr AAM. \n\nSo.... The Planes aren\'t even remotely the same. \n\nThe biggest lie so far, lie #5 - @5:00 /u/Dhruvrathee used ONE single report from the Hindu and says Reliance cornered 21k crores offset value\n\nLie lie lie. \n\nIn 2018, the full details of the offset clauses were released and is as follows,\n\nDRDO - 9k crores\n\nThe group companies involved in the Rafale manufacturing then have committed to the below\n\nThales - 6k crores\n\nSafran - 6k crores\n\nDassault - 8k crores. \n\nOf this 8k crore component DRAl is to get 10% or 800 crores and this was confirmed in July 2018. [https://m.economictimes.com/news/defence/dassault-to-invest-100mn-euros-in-indian-venture-with-reliance/articleshow/61276008.cms](https://m.economictimes.com/news/defence/dassault-to-invest-100mn-euros-in-indian-venture-with-reliance/articleshow/61276008.cms)\n\nDassault invested $100mn in DRAL. That\'s 800 crores. \n\nDoston (does random hand gesticulations), Dhruv Rathee is a liar of Goebbelsian proportions. He has the ability to make 800 crores into 21,000 crores. That\'s some top notch propoganda there. \n\nLie by Omission, lie #6. What this "factual" reporter here neglects to mention is that DRDO is the largest recipient of the offset clause and in addition to the 8k crores, SNECMA has tied up with DRDO to revive the dead Kaveri Engine project. \n\n[https://wap.business-standard.com/article/specials/drdo-ties-up-with-snecma-to-revive-engine-for-tejas-116112000534_1.html](https://wap.business-standard.com/article/specials/drdo-ties-up-with-snecma-to-revive-engine-for-tejas-116112000534_1.html)\n\nDoston any informed person would know that the engine is where India is struggling at the most. This is also one of the most crucial parts to get right and this assistance alone is a massive win. But I guess the factual reporter really didn\'t see fit to report something as important as this. Agenda, ignorance or pathalogical liar ? You decide. \n\nWhopper of a lie, lie # 7 - at 8:00 he talks about cost. Says that Cong claimed that per unit price was 500 odd crores. \n\nWell the Cong could claim anything it wants but it literally never even got on the same page with Dassault regarding pricing so....how do we even know that\'s a fair price or even the price Dassault agreed to?\n\nDoston it\'s like this. I could go to an Audi showroom and then tell the salesman that I want an A4 at 9 lakhs. \n\nI could come out of the showroom and tell my friends that the per unit price is 9lakhs but doston (random hand gesticulation), does it become true? It needs 2 parties to agree to a price. That\'s the basic premise of any negotiation. \n\nThere is a way we can judge this though. Let\'s see what other countries have paid. \n\nEgypt - eur 215 mn / unit, no enhancements, no ToT, no offset\n\nQatar - eur 250 mn / unit. Enhancements yes but no ToT, no offset\n\nIndia - eur 220 mn / unit with 75% Servicebility assurance, Special Enhancements, offset clause. \n\nDoston maybe Kejriwalji and Rahulji school of maths is more superior but isn\'t this actually a competitive price?\n\nAnd doston I stop now at the half way point because even I thought Dhruvrathee would lie maybe 2,3 times / video but he has 7 lies in 8 mins..... That\'s like a lie every minute and i can\'t debunk the rest of the 8 mins also. Too tiresome. \n\n/u/dhruvrathee if you have any integrity left in you and you take your claim of being a "centrist" and neutral, you will issue a correction video. If not you are a flaming big liar. \n\nSomeone link that shamshamsharma, he can freely use this material to make a diss video. \n'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'ba1y0i'<br />Score:227<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ba1y0i/the_lies_of_dhruv_rathee_on_rafale_he_has_7_lies/</li>

Because they stopped letting outsiders point their problems, built a strong image of themselves and used it to conduct business and from the income they got from that business they were able to fix most of those problems(without having to be pointed out constantly by outsiders) and their quality of life.\n\nBusiness and trade, where the image is the most important. And we are consciously or unconsciously losing that battle. Lets run a small experiment.\n\nBe truly honest, If there were two boxers of similar quality and looks basically identical in every way except their names. One is "Jayant Kajaria" the other named "Johny Denver ", which one do you usually go for??\n\nYou chose the second because the idea of the first one might not be good has been cultivated inside you without your knowledge. This is the sense of inferiority we need to get rid of. This isn\'t nationalism, this is business. Why would outsiders buy products from a vendor whose identity and image is often tagged with "problem ridden &amp; dirty"?\n\nAnd no, not everything is our own fault. In fact Uk has been running an active psy ops mission of planting such subliminal thoughts for decades now against any country they consider a threat.\n\nThis is why its important to put down people like pewdiepie, and send a clear message that they don\'t get to talk about us. Hell, we have enough people, we can easily make a random indian kid the biggest youtuber on earth. Lets see what new argument they are going to come up with to continue their hostility towards us.\n\nThis is a definitive moment in history (not pewdiepie t series shit but the whole world) where the world is at a cross roads and the market of future is forming, if at this point of time we fail to make a clear mark for ourselves, we\'d be the dumbest people to ever existed.\n\nIt\'s time we returned the hostility ten folds, even gandhi\'s movement was only effective because of the non-cooperation, not because of non violence or starving ourselves in front of british, they were doing that to bengalis intentionally anyway. Or else we\'ll always be only good enough to be come executives in outsiders companies rather than having our own products and companies.'<br />Author: 'nihilnashwar'  id: 'ba0tou'<br />Score:80<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ba0tou/pewdiepie_and_other_innuendo_based_racists/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Gyan about socialism from WhatsApp'<br />Body: 'An economics professor at a local college made a statement that he had never failed a single student before, but had recently failed an entire class. That class had insisted that socialism worked and that no one would be poor and no one would be rich, a great equalizer.\n\nThe professor then said, "OK, we will have an experiment in this class on Socialism principles: All grades will be averaged and everyone will receive the same grade so no one will fail and no one will receive an A.... (substituting grades for dollars - something closer to home and more readily understood by all).\n\nAfter the first test, the grades were averaged and everyone got a B. The students who studied hard were upset and the students who studied little were happy. As the second test rolled around, the students who studied little had studied even less and the ones who studied hard decided they wanted a free ride too so they studied little.\n\nThe second test average was a D! No one was happy. \nWhen the 3rd test rolled around, the average was an F.\n\nAs the tests proceeded, the scores never increased as bickering, blame and name-calling all resulted in hard feelings and no one would study for the benefit of anyone else.\n\nTo their great surprise, ALL FAILED and the professor told them that socialism would also ultimately fail because when the reward is great, the effort to succeed is great, but when government takes all the reward away, no one will try or want to succeed. Could not be any simpler than that. These are possibly the 5 best sentences you\'ll ever read and all applicable to this experiment:\n\n1. You cannot legislate the poor into prosperity by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity.\n\n2. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving.\n\n3. The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else.\n\n4. You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it!\n\n5. When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that is the beginning of the end of any nation.\n\n~~Can you think of a reason for not sharing this?\nNeither could I.~~👍👌👍😊☺️😁😎👏👏👏👏\n\nSeriously commies are such inhuman insects.

Infrastructure was being developed and local authorities were actually working. Also from what I have gathered crime has also decreased in UP. \n\nWhen these people came back to Amethi they were struck by the intense contrast and came to the realization that. साला कब से चुतिया काट रहा ये बन्दा। (Translation: this guy (Rahul Gandhi) has been playing is for a fool for quite some time)\n\nAnd so Anti-Congress feelings were developed in the local populace. Now Amethi is an important bastion for Congress. So they decided rather not risk it and move the polemarch somewhere safe where he can actually compete on a somewhat neutral ground (which would probably be better than Amethi for him in any case).\n\nNow even if he loses, he can say it is due to it being his first time in a new constituency and if he wins; well he won."<br />Author: 'Smooth_Detective'  id: 'b9dt5w'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b9dt5w/my_hypothesis_on_why_rahul_gandhi_is_fighting/</li>

Before he moved on to his new appointment on 22 October, Pakistani forces infiltrated Kashmir, capturing Domel and\xa0Muzaffarabad. The following day, the ruler of the\xa0princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, Maharaja\xa0Hari Singh, appealed for help from India. On 25 October, Manekshaw accompanied\xa0V. P. Menon, the secretary of the States Department, to\xa0Srinagar. While Menon was with the Maharaja, Manekshaw carried out an aerial survey of the situation in Kashmir. According to Manekshaw, the Maharaja signed the\xa0Instrument of Accession\xa0on the same day, and they flew back to Delhi.\xa0Lord Mountbatten\xa0and the\xa0Prime Minister,\xa0Jawaharlal Nehru, were briefed, during which Manekshaw suggested immediate deployments of troops to prevent Kashmir from being captured.[29]\n\n&gt; **Nehru was not in favour of the deployment of troops initially, but he was persuaded by\xa0Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the deputy prime minister**. On the morning of 27 October, Indian troops were sent to Kashmir, and Srinagar was occupied just before Pakistani forces reached the city\'s outskirts.   \n   \n2. Because of intra-defense fuckery revolving around politics (around Nehru in particular) Manekshaw lost an opportunity to represent India in the 62 War against China. He was also accused of being an "anti-national" by the officers who were in Nehrus favor and was court martialed for sedition. He was eventually exonerated.  \n  \n&gt; In May 1961, Thimayya resigned as the COAS, and was succeeded by General\xa0Pran Nath Thapar. Earlier in the year, Major General\xa0Brij Mohan Kaul\xa0had been promoted to lieutenant general and appointed the Quarter Master General (QMG) by Defence Minister Menon. **The appointment was made against the recommendation of Thimayya, who resigned as a result. Kaul was made the Chief of General Staff (CGS), the second highest appointment at Army Headquarters after the COAS. Kaul cultivated a close relationship with Nehru and Menon and became even more powerful than the COAS**. This was met with disapproval by senior army officials, including **Manekshaw, who made derogatory comments about the interference of the political leadership in the administration of the army. This led him to be marked as an\xa0anti-national.[29]**\n\n&gt; Kaul sent informers to spy on Manekshaw who, as a result of the information gathered, was charged with sedition, and subjected to a court of inquiry. Meanwhile, two of his juniors—Harbaksh Singh\xa0and Moti Sagar—were promoted to lieutenant general and appointed as corps commanders. It was widely believed that Manekshaw had come close to being dismissed from the service. The court, presided over by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of the\xa0Western Command, Lieutenant General Daulet Singh, known for his integrity, exonerated Manekshaw. Before a formal \'no case to answer\' could be announced, the\xa0Sino-Indian War\xa0broke out; Manekshaw was not able to participate because of the court proceedings. **The Indian Army suffered a debacle in the war, for which Kaul and Menon were held primarily responsible, and both were sacked**. In November 1962, Nehru asked Manekshaw to take over the command of\xa0IV Corps. **Manekshaw told Nehru that the court action against him was a conspiracy, and that his promotion had been due for almost eighteen months; Nehru apologised.[29][39]** Shortly after, on 2 December 1962, Manekshaw was promoted to acting lieutenant-general and appointed GOC of IV Corps at\xa0Tezpur.[40]\n  \nThis is not definitive enough on it\'s own to help anyone conclude that Nehru sucks, but we can add it to the giant pile of "This fucking family screwed India over".'<br />Author: '40ml'  id: 'b8wpio'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b8wpio/just_a_rant_on_how_terrible_nehru_was_as_a_leader/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'India and Hindus in Western social sciences: An example'<br />Body: 'The following is an excerpt from a prominent social scientist (Lloyd deMause)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_deMause]. He is the founder of The Journal of Psychohistory! This is what he [spoke](https://psychohistory.com/articles/the-history-of-child-abuse/) about child abuse in the world cultures, as recent as 1997!\n\n\n\n&gt;Outside the West, the sexual molestation of children is a routine practice in most families. Childhood in India begins, according to observers, with the child being regularly masturbated by the mother, the girl “to make her sleep well,” the boy “to make him manly.” The child sleeps in the family bed, witnesses and most likely takes part in sexual intercourse between the parents. The child is often “borrowed” to sleep with other members of the extended household, leading to the Indian proverb that “For a girl to be a virgin at ten years old, she must have neither brothers nor cousin nor father.”\n\n&gt;Childhood is so eroticized that, as one Western observer put it, “The little Hindu girls are deflowered by the little boys with whom they play, and repeat together the erotic lessons which their parents have unwittingly taught them on account of the general promiscuity of family life throughout India. In all the little girls of less than ten years of age the complete hymen is wanting…Incest is often the rule rather than the exception.”\n\n&gt;Child marriage was, of course, a long-standing Indian practice. When laws were passed in 1929 trying to outlaw it, the government was overwhelmed by men insisting that early marriage was an absolute necessity, since little girls were naturally very sexual and must be married early if they are to be restrained from seducing adults. “Cupid overtakes the hearts of girls…at an early age,” they said. “A girl’s desire for sexual intercourse is eight times greater than that of males.” Indian mothers also often supported early marriage, frankly admitting it was necessary in order to protect their little girls against rape in the family, saying that “they were afraid to leave their daughters at home, even for one afternoon, without a mother’s eye and accessible to the men of the family.”\n\n&gt;The Indian subcontinent, in fact, still has many groups, such as the Baiga, where actual incestuous marriage is practiced, between fathers and daughters, between mothers and sons, between siblings and even between grandparents and their grandchildren–thus disproving the oft-repeated anthropological truism that “no known tribe has ever permitted incest” because if it were allowed society would surely cease functioning. In many of these villages, the children move at the age of 5 or 6 from the incestuous activities of the family bed to spend the rest of their childhood in sex dormitories, where they are initiated by older youth and men into intercourse with a succession of other children, none for longer than three days at a time, under threat of gang rape.'<br />Author: 'sadhunath'  id: 'b8umgz'<br />Score:30<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b8umgz/india_and_hindus_in_western_social_sciences_an/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Anti-Manifesto in response to congress manifesto'<br />Body: '\nRahul Gandhi\'s Congress announced a manifesto ahead of the upcoming elections in India. The manifesto in its entirety can be read at https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/realtime/English_Manifesto_MobilePDF_1April19.pdf . As an Indian I am deeply troubled by some aspects of this manifesto and wanted to write a short note to outline my concerns.\n\nA wise man once said "If you want to make a show about changing a system you change the rules of the system, if you want to actually change the system you change the incentives in the system". In my lived experiences I have found the insights of this quote to be very deep. Humans as a species are hardwired to deduce the incentive structure of any given situation and  then maximize their rewards from the incentive structure. One can think of this as a deduce/optimize cycle, where we are always trying to understand how incentive structure changed and once we understand the change we adapt our behavior to optimize our chances of doing well in the new incentive structure. It is an odd trait for a species to have, but it does make us an interesting species because this deduce/optimize feedback loop in our minds causes us to be creative and competitive. As incentives adapt we take great pleasure in anticipating and recognizing the change in incentive before others, and then getting a juicy reward under the changed incentives gives us the dopamine high that pushes us to the next deduce/optimize cycle. \n\nThe single largest reason that the Congress manifesto bothers me, is that it changes the incentive structure of our country in a very significant way. The Assured Income Scheme announced in the manifesto guarantees a minimum income of Rs 12000 to every Indian, irrespective of their ability, background or current standing in life. And therein lies the rub - this changes the deduce/optimize framework of every single Indian. If implemented, this scheme would mean that going forward in all perpetuity, productive Indians in the middle class will part with sizable portions of their income to fund the minimum income scheme. For every day where they work hard they will have in their mind a few recurring questions - are there other lower tax countries where they could save more, is their hard earned money being used by the recipients wisely, is the government wasting large portions of it as an overhead? Basic questions of fairness will haunt their minds - should they not be saving for their retirement, or for their health expenses, or children\'s education or for any of the other reasons that are close to their heart. What do people do when faced with such questions? How do they react?\n\nIn trying to answer questions on how middle class will react, we are lucky that Rahul Gandhi is not the first politician to have thought of such a scheme. We can look at other places where such schemes have been tried and see if we can learn something. In all the places such schemes have been tried, they have ended with utter failure. There is a common narrative that unfolds in the following way\n\nThere is initial euphoria about the scheme and for first couple of years poor sections of the population are able to enjoy goods and services they were unable to in the past. All the freshly flowing money increases a demand for goods, causing markets to do well since there are a lot of new consumers in the economy. At the same time not everyone is happy, productive members of society in the Middle class notice that they are left with much lesser money at the end of the month, since the Government is taking a large part of their paycheck as a tax to fund the Income scheme for the poor. These middle class citizens see that the Rich are not paying their fair share in taxes as usual and feel victimized as the only section of society who is being asked to sacrifice to fund the minimum income program. As the middle class is unable to fund their children\'s education or health expenses due to shortage of money, they start looking for other options. They realize that not all countries have such wealth redistribution schemes and their friends who live abroad pay half the taxes (~30%) vs the 70% that they do. In a couple of years this middle class starts leaving for other countries to ensure a good life for their family. Middle class professions with transferable skils like Engineers, Teachers, Accountants are the first to leave. The country starts losing key skills from its talent pool.\n\nIn few years the euphoria starts settling down, effect of waning entrepreneurial activity and flight of productive middle class professionals starts to make a dent, but money is still flowing and hence inflation picks up. Goods and services both become more expensive. Everyone nervously knows good times are over but no one says anything. As inflation rises the same people who cheered for the initial socialist impulse, pressure the government to do more and ask for ever larger handouts. Governments cant stand up to the public because they trained the same public that "Government will take care of you and make sure you can afford the necessities in life". Governments cave in and give ever larger handouts. In the end we have a failed state which cannot fund its obligations. \n\n\nOn some level I do not particularly care whether @narendramodi wins or not, but I am very concerned that a great nation is possibly going to make a very dark choice. I hope we look at Rahul Gandhi\'s scheme for what it is - a cynical ploy to revive the fortunes of the Indian National Congress by reinventing it as a Communist party. In our rush to dispense with the current government, I hope we do not destroy our country irreversibly. A good litmus test for middle class voters to think about is - "Can I live all my life with 70% of my income taken away by the government?". If the answer to that is no, please vote against Rahul Gandhis Minimum Income Scheme.\n\n\n“When the people find that they can vote themselves money that will herald the end of the republic.” - Benjamin Franklin\n\n\nIf you think there is some merit to this, please share using the following link https://privatebin.net/?ee881f9b13c2a5b1#qtukejzMZvdehdUDwyA94NGG+SJgU8KV2QD9j7dfl6k='<br />Author: 'opdroid1234'  id: 'b8tlnw'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b8tlnw/antimanifesto_in_response_to_congress_manifesto/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Special One - Narendra Modi'<br />Body: 'Decided to start a media platform to provide an alternative view on Indian/World Politics/Culture - [The Emissary](https://theemissary.co/). \n\nThis is our first article: \n\n[**The Special One**](https://theemissary.co/the-special-one/)\n\nIf I were to tell you the poor little boy serving you tea would become your Prime Minister, would you believe me?\n\nWell he did.\n\nAnd he became the most powerful force in Indian politics since Indira Gandhi. \n\nNarendra Modi is coming up towards the end of his term now. He faces a crucial test of iron this year as the 2019 Indian General Elections take place. Many would not imagine this current scenario. \n\nSome couldn’t imagine someone from his background being PM. Others could not see Modi himself, who many consider a bigot and fanatic, become the PM of the world’s largest democracy (They seethe even more considering there were no major riots during his rule as to validate their hatred of him). Others are surprised that Modi’s aura of invincibility has waned, and that he now has to tenaciously battle against a cockney of opponents who are desperately trying to devise a mahagathbandhan – a Grand Alliance devoid of any clear ideology or policy except one: Dethrone Narendra Modi.\n\nI want to make this very clear – in the context of an independent India’s history, Narendra Modi is The Special One. As the infamous football coach Jose Mourinho anointed himself this title (and did earn it), Modi’s performance as Prime Minister and the situation surrounding him has made him deserving of this accolade. He is not one without weakness and failure, but Modi has profoundly changed not only the Indian political arena, but the minds of individual Indians themselves.\n\n\n**Context**\n\nFor 70+ years, India has been dominated by one party – the Indian National Congress Party. The party of independence that was supposed to be disbanded in 1947 but continued by the will of Jawaharlal Nehru against the wishes of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nThis party has been controlled by the Nehru-Gandhi family for the same period of time. So effectively, India, its government institutions, judiciary, media, and academia have been molded and abused by one family for 70 years.\n\nEnter 2014 elections. The ruling Congress Party has been caught in a practical orgy of scams. Social media has burgeoned into a powerful independent check against an increasingly compromised Indian media. A man named Narendra Modi touts his Gujarat model of governance and success. He comes from a poor chaiwala and lower-caste family and positions himself as a common man up against elites. He wins in a landslide. The greatest electoral victory in decades.\n\nModi was the first Indian PM born in an independent India. And in many ways, people saw his victory as the true beginnings of an India free from colonial inferiorities and a resurgence of indigenous thought.\n\n\n**Core Policy**\n\nDevelopment, anti-corruption, and Hindutva (Hindu-ness or the idea that all of India shared a common heritage in ancient Indian spirituality and culture) were the planks of Modi’s campaign.\n\nThe overwhelming theme of Modi’s first term has been focusing on the fundamentals. Financial inclusion, infrastructural integration, and welfare have been integral areas of focus for the administration. \n\nThis focus on the basics is exactly why Modi will be viewed in a much more positive manner in hindsight. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, known as India’s Warren Buffett, labeled Modi as a “distilled socialist” who wanted to expand the economic pie through capitalism first so that all Indians can benefit within the market with welfare if needed.\n\n\n**Financial Inclusion**\n\nModi’s financial inclusion initiatives will have massive long term ramifications for the poorest of Indians in the future.\n\nSome of the most prominent initiatives and their impacts:\n\n* Jan Dhan Yojana – 99% of households have at least 1 bank account\n* Direct Benefit Transfer – Synergizing with Jan Dhan and Aadhar (Indian Government ID system), DBT cut the corrupt middle man from government benefit transfers and puts benefits directly into the bank accounts of those in need\n* MUDRA – Micro-financing for 120 million people to encourage entrepreneurship and small businesses. 90 million of the beneficiaries were women\n* Ease of Doing Business ranking jumped from 142 to 77 in 4 years\n\nPoor households now have access to financial savings, monetary security, and business opportunity – something that has alluded them for decades since India’s inception. The compounding effect of wealth creation has been buttressed by a direct deliverance of welfare, which has been hampered in the past by corruption.\n\n\n**Macroeconomic Reforms**\n\nModi’s effect on the country has also been paralleled on a macroeconomic level. High level reforms have had a knock on effect to the GDP (one of the fastest growing economy in the world), inflation (reduction from ~10% in 2014 to ~2% in January 2019), and a reduction in fiscal deficit from 4.5% in 2014 to 3.5% now. The most amazing part of this story is that this occurred concurrently to the greatest infrastructure investment in India’s history. Construction in highway, railway, and electrification has been conducted at a blistering pace opening the veins and arteries of an economic powerhouse. \n\nHowever, Modi’s top level economic reforms would be controversial and painful to large swathes of the populace. Still, they have yielded improvements with time and are forward facing initiatives. The main ones include:\n\n* Demonetization – A drastic currency removal in November 2016 to combat black money, encourage tax collection, financial inclusion, and digitization. The informal sector was no doubt hurt by this, and the battle against black money was negligible long term; but tax collection, financial inclusion, and digitization skyrocketed after.\n* GST – Goods and Services Tax; again another painful but necessary reform. By setting a unitary VAT tax across all Indian states, business was streamlined while tax collection went up versus the old system of different VAT rates for different states.\n* IBC – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code; a revolution in India’s banking and credit culture which gave the government an effective method to combat NPAs (Non-Performing Assets ie bad loans), bankruptcy, and provide a just credit system towards powerful companies who had no fear of bankruptcy prior.\n\nThese backend reforms solidify India’s transformation to a formal economy and provide strong foundations for future economic growth and accountability.\n\nThis formalization has had a domino effect on corruption as well. Coupled with the mass efforts of digitization, corruption has been dealt a blow across India.  However, most notably one must point out how high level corruption is completely absent from the Centre. While perhaps the greatest exercise in fake news  – the Rafale aircraft controversy – has been screeched constantly by the dynast of India’s “First Family,” Rahul Gandhi; much of India has been unmoved as all government branches and agencies have cleared the procurement process as clean. Modi’s incorruptible image stands in stark contrast with a motley crew of scams trailing the Mahagathbandhan. \n\n\n**Welfare**\n\nWith lessened corruption and the DBT system, welfare to the poorest Indians has been much more effective and expansive than the past. Modi’s welfare schemes have aimed to improve Indians’ everyday lives. These along with his financial inclusion schemes have sought to integrate India’s poorest into the market economy in order to gain wealth and health.\n\nOf the numerous schemes, 3 stand out the most:\n\n* Ujjwala Yojana – 60 million households provided with Liquid Petroleum Gas tanks to replace dangerous and polluting traditional fire/cooking methods\n* Swacch Bharat – Millions of toilets built and an increased emphasis on sanitation and anti-littering messages have transformed streets and directly combatted the harmful practice of open defecation.\n* Ayushman Bharat – Possibly the grandest of all of Modi’s initiatives. Modi’s forever mark on India and a life-changing initiative for 500 million of India’s poorest who now have health insurance.\n\nIndia’s poorest were viciously stuck in a cycle of despair and poverty, but the above 3 initiatives have given them opportunity and health. The ability to climb from poverty and not worry about the bill from getting sick or hurt. To be able to go to the bathroom in peace. To live a clean life. \n\n\n**Foreign Affairs**\n\nIn foreign affairs, Modi has expanded India’s reach – a balancing act when strengthening relations with the USA and Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran, Israel and Palestine, as well as various other countries. Modi has reduced terrorism in India drastically compared to the UPA years while striking back at Pakistan through recent surgical strikes in addition to economic and diplomatic isolation. \n\nThe most recent airstrike at the Balakot complex housing Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists was particularly a game changer. Indian jets had bombed territory in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa ie Pakistan proper, not Pakistan occupied Kashmir. Modi has repeated moved the red line forward into Pakistan for its terror sponsoring, something few Indian Prime Ministers have ever done. On top of this, various nations came out in support of India’s right to self-defense, while none supported Pakistan.\n\nIndian military pressure became so terrifying to Pakistan, that its airspace has been closed for days in addition to reduction in naval shipments. The airspace has yet to fully open even till this day. This economic strangulation is the real danger to Pakistan as it literally raises the price of sponsoring terror.\n\nTime will tell if Pakistan will succumb to international as well as Indian pressure to truly crack down on its terrorist apparatus instead of paying lip service a few years by falsely banning “militant” outfits only for them to rename and strike India again. \n\nModi has also brought climate change to its rightful global stage. As head of the International Solar Alliance, Modi has spearheaded clean energy efforts that aim to create a global effort to combat this menace. India has lead from the front as it has exceeded its Paris Agreement targets and is aggressively pursuing green energy solutions.\n\n\n**The Case for Modi**\n\nModi has given hope to India’s downtrodden and elevated India on the world stage politically, economically, and culturally. While other parties are commanded by leaders from a prestigious family and wealth, Modi comes from neither.\n\nHe is the every man. His story connects with all Indians. He has felt the pain of hunger, poverty, and discrimination throughout his life. India’s problems have been his problems; and now India’s solutions have become Modi’s solutions. Modi is indeed a testament to India’s democracy, descended from the ganarajyas of ancient times.\n\nModi wears his Indianness with pride instead of with shame as many of the English speaking elites do. He believes in an India that is as old as human history, not one born of Nehru’s words in 1947. He believes in an India where unity is adorned with diversity instead of divided by it. He believes in the oppressed, the ordinary, and the entrepreneurial. He believes in a civilization moved by science and spirituality. He believes in India, and India should believe in him; as he is indeed, The Special One.

As the infamous football coach Jose Mourinho anointed himself this title (and did earn it), Modi’s performance as Prime Minister and the situation surrounding him has made him deserving of this accolade. He is not one without weakness and failure, but Modi has profoundly changed not only the Indian political arena, but the minds of individual Indians themselves.\n\n**Context**\n\nFor 70+ years, India has been dominated by one party – the Indian National Congress Party. The party of independence that was supposed to be disbanded in 1947 but continued by the will of Jawaharlal Nehru against the wishes of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nThis party has been controlled by the Nehru-Gandhi family for the same period of time. So effectively, India, its government institutions, judiciary, media, and academia have been molded and abused by one family for 70 years.\n\nEnter 2014 elections. The ruling Congress Party has been caught in a practical orgy of scams. Social media has burgeoned into a powerful independent check against an increasingly compromised Indian media. A man named Narendra Modi touts his Gujarat model of governance and success. He comes from a poor chaiwala and lower-caste family and positions himself as a common man up against elites. He wins in a landslide. The greatest electoral victory in decades.\n\nModi was the first Indian PM born in an independent India. And in many ways, people saw his victory as the true beginnings of an India free from colonial inferiorities and a resurgence of indigenous thought.\n\n**Core Policy**\n\nDevelopment, anti-corruption, and Hindutva (Hindu-ness or the idea that all of India shared a common heritage in ancient Indian spirituality and culture) were the planks of Modi’s campaign.\n\nThe overwhelming theme of Modi’s first term has been focusing on the fundamentals. Financial inclusion, infrastructural integration, and welfare have been integral areas of focus for the administration. \n\nThis focus on the basics is exactly why Modi will be viewed in a much more positive manner in hindsight. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, known as India’s Warren Buffett, labeled Modi as a “distilled socialist” who wanted to expand the economic pie through capitalism first so that all Indians can benefit within the market with welfare if needed.\n\n**Financial Inclusion**\n\nModi’s financial inclusion initiatives will have massive long term ramifications for the poorest of Indians in the future.\n\nSome of the most prominent initiatives and their impacts:\n\n* Jan Dhan Yojana – 99% of households have at least 1 bank account\n* Direct Benefit Transfer – Synergizing with Jan Dhan and Aadhar (Indian Government ID system), DBT cut the corrupt middle man from government benefit transfers and puts benefits directly into the bank accounts of those in need\n* MUDRA – Micro-financing for 120 million people to encourage entrepreneurship and small businesses. 90 million of the beneficiaries were women\n* Ease of Doing Business ranking jumped from 142 to 77 in 4 years\n\nPoor households now have access to financial savings, monetary security, and business opportunity – something that has alluded them for decades since India’s inception. The compounding effect of wealth creation has been buttressed by a direct deliverance of welfare, which has been hampered in the past by corruption.\n\n**Macroeconomic Reforms**\n\nModi’s effect on the country has also been paralleled on a macroeconomic level. High level reforms have had a knock on effect to the GDP (one of the fastest growing economy in the world), inflation (reduction from ~10% in 2014 to ~2% in January 2019), and a reduction in fiscal deficit from 4.5% in 2014 to 3.5% now. The most amazing part of this story is that this occurred concurrently to the greatest infrastructure investment in India’s history. Construction in highway, railway, and electrification has been conducted at a blistering pace opening the veins and arteries of an economic powerhouse. \n\nHowever, Modi’s top level economic reforms would be controversial and painful to large swathes of the populace. Still, they have yielded improvements with time and are forward facing initiatives. The main ones include:\n\n* Demonetization – A drastic currency removal in November 2016 to combat black money, encourage tax collection, financial inclusion, and digitization. The informal sector was no doubt hurt by this, and the battle against black money was negligible long term; but tax collection, financial inclusion, and digitization skyrocketed after.\n* GST – Goods and Services Tax; again another painful but necessary reform. By setting a unitary VAT tax across all Indian states, business was streamlined while tax collection went up versus the old system of different VAT rates for different states.\n* IBC – Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code; a revolution in India’s banking and credit culture which gave the government an effective method to combat NPAs (Non-Performing Assets ie bad loans), bankruptcy, and provide a just credit system towards powerful companies who had no fear of bankruptcy prior.\n\nThese backend reforms solidify India’s transformation to a formal economy and provide strong foundations for future economic growth and accountability.\n\nThis formalization has had a domino effect on corruption as well. Coupled with the mass efforts of digitization, corruption has been dealt a blow across India.  However, most notably one must point out how high level corruption is completely absent from the Centre. While perhaps the greatest exercise in fake news  – the Rafale aircraft controversy – has been screeched constantly by the dynast of India’s “First Family,” Rahul Gandhi; much of India has been unmoved as all government branches and agencies have cleared the procurement process as clean. Modi’s incorruptible image stands in stark contrast with a motley crew of scams trailing the Mahagathbandhan. \n\n**Welfare**\n\nWith lessened corruption and the DBT system, welfare to the poorest Indians has been much more effective and expansive than the past. Modi’s welfare schemes have aimed to improve Indians’ everyday lives. These along with his financial inclusion schemes have sought to integrate India’s poorest into the market economy in order to gain wealth and health.\n\nOf the numerous schemes, 3 stand out the most:\n\n* Ujjwala Yojana – 60 million households provided with Liquid Petroleum Gas tanks to replace dangerous and polluting traditional fire/cooking methods\n* Swacch Bharat – Millions of toilets built and an increased emphasis on sanitation and anti-littering messages have transformed streets and directly combatted the harmful practice of open defecation.\n* Ayushman Bharat – Possibly the grandest of all of Modi’s initiatives. Modi’s forever mark on India and a life-changing initiative for 500 million of India’s poorest who now have health insurance.\n\nIndia’s poorest were viciously stuck in a cycle of despair and poverty, but the above 3 initiatives have given them opportunity and health. The ability to climb from poverty and not worry about the bill from getting sick or hurt. To be able to go to the bathroom in peace. To live a clean life. \n\n**Foreign Affairs**\n\nIn foreign affairs, Modi has expanded India’s reach – a balancing act when strengthening relations with the USA and Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran, Israel and Palestine, as well as various other countries. Modi has reduced terrorism in India drastically compared to the UPA years while striking back at Pakistan through recent surgical strikes in addition to economic and diplomatic isolation. \n\nThe most recent airstrike at the Balakot complex housing Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists was particularly a game changer. Indian jets had bombed territory in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa ie Pakistan proper, not Pakistan occupied Kashmir. Modi has repeated moved the red line forward into Pakistan for its terror sponsoring, something few Indian Prime Ministers have ever done. On top of this, various nations came out in support of India’s right to self-defense, while none supported Pakistan.\n\nIndian military pressure became so terrifying to Pakistan, that its airspace has been closed for days in addition to reduction in naval shipments. The airspace has yet to fully open even till this day. This economic strangulation is the real danger to Pakistan as it literally raises the price of sponsoring terror.\n\nTime will tell if Pakistan will succumb to international as well as Indian pressure to truly crack down on its terrorist apparatus instead of paying lip service a few years by falsely banning “militant” outfits only for them to rename and strike India again. \n\nModi has also brought climate change to its rightful global stage. As head of the International Solar Alliance, Modi has spearheaded clean energy efforts that aim to create a global effort to combat this menace. India has lead from the front as it has exceeded its Paris Agreement targets and is aggressively pursuing green energy solutions.\n\n**The Case for Modi**\n\nModi has given hope to India’s downtrodden and elevated India on the world stage politically, economically, and culturally. While other parties are commanded by leaders from a prestigious family and wealth, Modi comes from neither.\n\nHe is the every man. His story connects with all Indians. He has felt the pain of hunger, poverty, and discrimination throughout his life. India’s problems have been his problems; and now India’s solutions have become Modi’s solutions. Modi is indeed a testament to India’s democracy, descended from the ganarajyas of ancient times.\n\nModi wears his Indianness with pride instead of with shame as many of the English speaking elites do. He believes in an India that is as old as human history, not one born of Nehru’s words in 1947. He believes in an India where unity is adorned with diversity instead of divided by it. He believes in the oppressed, the ordinary, and the entrepreneurial. He believes in a civilization moved by science and spirituality. He believes in India, and India should believe in him; as he is indeed, The Special One.

      <li>Title::: 'Introducing the IndiaSpeaks Council | Spoilers &amp; Basic information'<br />Body: 'Namaste Everyone,\n\n#Summary:\n\n&gt; A 10 member council having 4 factions (3 + 3 + 3 +1) which will now start determining a lot of things about the sub, how it is known and grows. \n\n&gt; While mods will still retain their powers and freedoms to a large extent - as they are still the only ones accountable to the site admins / management, most everything that does not concern the admins would have largely Council influence in determining things.\n\n&gt; With these powers also comes accountability and responsibility. \n\n\n#Quick Introduction:\n\nOur sub is growing. With growth comes new issues and challenges. What worked previously when the community was smaller, would not work effectively tomorrow. New user additions will bring their ideas, opinions and mentality into the sub. \n\nGrowth also attracts users of nefarious motive, at the same time emboldens existing members to be more conservative and off-putting. These are just a few of the issues, but the most pertinent of the issues would be the responsibility on the mod team. \n\nAt the moment, the mod team is sort of expected to manage the sub (Modqueue, Warnings, Bans, rule enforcement), Create activity, organize events, and mostly everything. That is not ideally their role - they are only facilitators and \'moderate discussion\' (Meaning, they prevent extremism of any kind).   \n\nDue to various recurring issues, conflict-of-interest and diversification of initiative - We plan to introduce an "IndiaSpeaks Council". \n\n\n#I. The Council:\nBriefly:\n\n\n&gt; The council would be a middle-level group (Between the community and the Mod team) of 10 users who would help promote activity, resolve serious conflicts, organize their own events. They will help share the weight of responsibility and accountability of the mod team (Decision making) while guiding the community towards positive growth (Activity) without directly indulging in regular mod duties. \n\n\n#II. Scope of the council:\n\n* Precede on controversial cases in a humane and just manner, while paying attention to best interests of the sub and its community. \n\n* As major stakeholders for the success of the /r/IndiaSpeaks  - advise and/or instruct on what is the best course of action in situations.\n\n* Ask for a policy to be surveyed by the larger community.\n\n* Organize and decide on regular and special events on the subreddit. Plan for the next month via monthly meeting.\n\n* Decide on non-urgent situations\n\nIn other words:\n\n&gt; Work on things that mods currently do, except moderation. Take input from the community, discuss and decide - advise the course of action to the Mod team. Decide on all non-urgent matters of the subreddit.\n\n##III. I. Powers of the council:\n\n* A majority verdict of a case can be made to be implemented by the /r/IndiaSpeaks mod team.\n* Major rules changes and/or bans can be asked to be implemented or revoked.\n* Moderator disciplinary action can be asked for.\n* Growth and expansion of the subreddit can be decided upon.\n\n##III. II. Counter-Powers of the Mod team (Council Limitations)\n\n* Mod team continues to have its rights to take discretionary decisions on issues of lesser importance. \n* Mod team continues to have its rights to take immediate, intermediate or interim decisions until the council comes up with a better solution.\n* Mod team continues to have its right to take a call on a rapidly emerging situation. \n* In cases of Subreddit security (or user site admin purview), they can use their **Limited Veto** a negate a case or council decision. A short reason can be given to the council privately. \n* If a case is going nowhere, the Mod decision would take preference. \n* If the council is not doing anything (totally inactive), then mods can look into dissolving the council, and perhaps reforming a new one.\n\n##IV. Factions of the council\n\nAs mentioned above, there are 10 members in total. These are divided into 4 factions.\n\n* **Jury Faction** - 3 Members selected by the [IndiaSpeaks Tark Jury](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/wiki/tarkjury) who have the freedom to select their **3 members** any ethical they deem fit.\n * Tark Jury currently has 14 Jurors. \n* **Elected Faction** - The /r/Indiaspeaks community would **Elect their 3 representatives**. Elections would use **Alternate/transferable vote system**. \n * Only registered voters\' ballot would be counted. \n* **Mod-Nominated Faction**: The mod team would nominate **3 members** who they deem fit, but are not part of either two factions to represent their case.\n * Preferable who are good contributors in the sub\n * Has some mod experience or understands mod-related perspectives.\n\n* **Invited Faction**: ** A single member** from generally outside the community chosen by the above 9 members. The community will give possible candidate list.  \n * Shouldn\'t be someone who at the very least, a neutral opinion of our community. \n\nMore details about the council will be released in a wiki page.\n\n#V. How do I become a part of the council?\n\n* **To be a part of Community Faction** Stand in Subreddit elections - campaign and get the 2/3rds / majority from the community via the alternate voting system. (Details later)\n\n* **To be part of the Jury Faction** Get recruited as a juror, apart from performing Debate jury duties, you can campaign among the jury team and get selected. They can decide their own cycling method. \n\n* **To get a Mod Nomination** - Hope sensei notices you. No lobbying here. Mods can nominate those who have helped grow the sub / contributed well but are not relatively popular. \n\n* **To be an Invited Member** - The 3 factions will invite an external user to help the council. You can give ideas, but it depends on the external user if they are interested. \n\n#VI. Sneak Peak about the Elections\n\n* There will be **a voter registration step**. We will do a few steps to minimize bogus voting (we accept we cannot eliminate it completely), hence the candidate powers are also limited (Just 3 elected reps).\n * A registered voter will have 2 ways to vote - **Early Stage voting** and **Poll day** - All registered voter **MUST** vote. \n * Those who **DO NOT** cast their vote would be fined: **About 1 month Ban from the sub**.\n\n* Alternate / transferable voting method would be used - as Subreddits generally tend towards echochambers (We\'ll call it \'fan base of a particular idea or ideology\') - the first-past-the-post is far too exclusive. We election method needs more inclusion and representation of user opinion. \n\n* Elections would be conducted every **3 months**.\n\n* Candidates can stand in elections as **independents** or as a **party**.   \n\n* While everyone who forms the community would vote - those who are a part of **Tark Jury cannot stand in the elections**\n\n~ Sorry, I just realized this is quite long for a spoiler. :S'<br />Author: 'metaltemujin'  id: 'b8hopz'<br />Score:54<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b8hopz/introducing_the_indiaspeaks_council_spoilers/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The West is not a utopia'<br />Body: 'This is me ranting about the western countries after watching Pewdiepie\'s diss track about "T-Series" even though it is obvious he is insulting India such as the caste system and poverty. Though the Caste System is not as big as a problem as it was before. It is nearly dead in the country. Then westerners will talk about how their countries are "utopias". I am gonna have a rant about this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanna start out by saying I hold no prejudice to any of these countries but I am merely stating facts which may be considered to be unpopular.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Western model is based on consumerism. People can buy things from businesses and receive hits of dopamine. Which is basically pleasure. Individuals in the west cannot get enough of it. This leads to depression as there is the high rush of dopamine and people want more and more. This then leads to drug usage. In America 2017, it is estimated that around 70,000 people have died from drug overdoses compared to around 18,000 in 2000. This is because that people want to satisfy the dopamine hits. \\[[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-americans-have-plummeted-into-record-levels-of-misery-2018-02-12](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-americans-have-plummeted-into-record-levels-of-misery-2018-02-12)\\]. The fact that there are movements to make drugs legal is just sad despite what it leads to. More people are depressed than ever even though the West consists of the most financially prosperous countries. There\'s everything but still misery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAmerica: Lots to talk about America but lets talk about the defecation. India is criticised for open defecation and its even a meme "Designated Shitting Streets". Well even though the number of open defecation people decreased (using toilets). There are people in America literally shitting in streets despite being the country with the highest GDP (nominal). San Francisco has a big defecation problem what with all the homeless \\[1\\]. Speaking of poverty, there are an estimated of 40 million Americans living in poverty and 18.5 million Americans living in EXTREME poverty (&lt;$1.90 per day) \\[2\\] I can also talk about the crime but we all know how many school shootings happen also with the Detroit gangs and South Chicago gang violence. Don\'t forget America is around $22 trillion in debt \\[3\\]. I can also go on about healthcare but everyone knows about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUK: The people in UK are highly screwing themselves over with Brexit. UK is currently stockpiling food in the case of a no deal Brexit which would be extremely bad for the country. You mean to tell me a high income country is stockpiling food? \\[4\\]. Also, UK is a country that is getting high amounts of crime now. Knives are getting banned just because of this. What do the police focus on? A dog doing a Nazi salute or someone posting something "offensive" on Twitter. For poverty, there are around 14.5 million people in the UK living under the poverty line \\[5\\]. But what is the government doing? Spending 600 million GBP on Brexit per week \\[6\\].\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrance: France is basically getting a revolution done. They also have slums and pissing problems. It can be compared to India but before the Swachh Bharat campaign. Its getting more dirty. They also have a crime and rape problem with an estimated count of 70,000 rape cases. There are Molotovs being thrown everywhere and tear gas being used due to the Yellow Vest movement. This is also done by the illegal immigrants. Might as well be a war zone. On Google images search "Paris Slums\' if you don\'t believe me about the slums. Or search "Paris Dirty" and you can get a good idea of how it is now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSweden: You might as well call Sweden an Islamic Republic. Sweden is getting mass amounts of rape cases. It has a rape rate of 56 rapes per 100,000. Making it the 2nd highest in Europe. \\[7\\]. Sweden is also arresting those who report rapes if a migrant does it because it is considered \'offensive\'. They also are allowing ISIS fighters to be in public housing and benefiting from the reintegration program. So basically Sweden loves those who commit violence.\n\nTldr: west is not a utopia. America has problems with gun violence, medical, defecation homelessness. UK arrests people for dumb reasons and Brexit is screwing them over. France has slums and riots. Sweden is basically glorifying violent migrants.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReferences:\n\n\\[1\\]: [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/18/san-francisco-poop-problem-inequality-homelessness](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/18/san-francisco-poop-problem-inequality-homelessness)\n\n\\[2\\]: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/25/trump-team-rebukes-u-n-saying-it-overestimates-extreme-poverty-in-america-by-18-million-people/?noredirect=on&amp;utm\\_term=.3a6b31ab1350](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/25/trump-team-rebukes-u-n-saying-it-overestimates-extreme-poverty-in-america-by-18-million-people/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.3a6b31ab1350)\n\n\\[3\\]: [https://www.thebalance.com/the-u-s-debt-and-how-it-got-so-big-3305778](https://www.thebalance.com/the-u-s-debt-and-how-it-got-so-big-3305778)\n\n\\[4\\]: [https://abcnews.go.com/International/uk-residents-stockpile-food-medicine-supplies-brexit-fears/story?id=60675982](https://abcnews.go.com/International/uk-residents-stockpile-food-medicine-supplies-brexit-fears/story?id=60675982)\n\n\\[5\\]: [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-poverty-levels-childcare-disability-ocial-metrics-commission-finances-a8540941.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-poverty-levels-childcare-disability-ocial-metrics-commission-finances-a8540941.html)\n\n\\[6\\] [https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-goldmansachs/brexit-uncertainty-has-cost-britain-600-million-a-week-goldman-sachs-idUKKCN1RD1T8](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-goldmansachs/brexit-uncertainty-has-cost-britain-600-million-a-week-goldman-sachs-idUKKCN1RD1T8)\n\n\\[7\\] [https://www.breakingisraelnews.com/113786/muslim-migration-and-rape-statistics-in-europe-opinion/](https://www.breakingisraelnews.com/113786/muslim-migration-and-rape-statistics-in-europe-opinion/)\n\n\\[8\\] [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/sweden-isis-fighters-city-lund-returning-jihadis-housing-job-education-benefits-reintegration-a7371266.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/sweden-isis-fighters-city-lund-returning-jihadis-housing-job-education-benefits-reintegration-a7371266.html)  \n '<br />Author: 'plebman1125'  id: 'b8dysk'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b8dysk/the_west_is_not_a_utopia/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Entertaining a bunch of thoughts.'<br />Body: 'made this post on a sister subreddit and a fellow bakchod suggested that i should post it here for a  conversation. so, here it is.\n\nhey folks, here\'s another thought entertaining (or as bindu would put it, sharkbreed\'s mental masturbation) post.\n\nit is a mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.\n\nso, today i was entertaining the idea of Hindu khatre mein h. i tried read a little about it and formulated my stance. so here\'s my stance - Hinduism khatre mein nhi h. \n\nI say it because the chief proponents i.e Muslims ruled for 800 years in different parts of subcontinent and yet they were not able to wipe out hinduism. they went all in with their genocides, brainwashings and assassination of religiously significant figures and yet were able to convert 33% of people, mostly because of a varna system that went wrong. i say this 33% because i counted the number of people in pre partition India and that came out be 33% in 1946.  \n\nnow, another argument that i tried entertaining was that of higher fertility rate among Muslims and that they\'ll eventually be a majority if nothing\'s done. while i absolutely stand firm with a law limiting number of children per mother, i feel that the "eventual takeover" is bit of an overblown idea. if we are to mathematically predict it, it would take about 10 - 15 generations or 200 years for them to atleast reach 50%. we would have a population of about 4 billion in that scenario. theoretically speaking, that would never happen because India can\'t produce resources fir such a large population. there\'s a thing called carrying capacity of earth and this type of figure would take it beyond that capacity.\n\nthen there are conversions. i, again stand behind a strict anti conversion law to check forced conversions. but let\'s assume that it won\'t be there and conversions will happen. even then it amounts to a max of 15,000 conversions a year( assuming the max figure of 500 conversions that were reported last year in Kerala becomes a norm throughout country). the figure as it stands js significant but miniscule if we\'re to put it in a larger context.\n\nso, in conclusion.... India will never again be a muslim majority because that\'s statistically an impossible thing. i feel that the focus should rather be directed on things that are actually the problem. a strong anti conversion bill to check the wolves, a law limiting breeding rate and a uniform civil code. these are the things that should be given utmost priority to ensure that this nation prosper. \n\nsee to it that none if these are hardlined facts and is an opinion. you\'re free to be critical of any and all points that i made above.\n\nso, these are my bunch of thoughts, let\'s hear yours. feel free to be critical or even call me names if you\'re insulted by any of my comments. but there are brownie points for being civil :).

Recently, he released a video titled, 'Congratulations', which is basically salty rant against T-series for passing him. In that video he constantly insults Indians, and tactfully made a comment on excluding those Indians who had support him earlier in order to retain their support. (And I think they will continue to support him.)\n\nIn the beginning he takes a series of jibes at T series. He lampoons by the company by saying that it is a corporate enterprise comprising of all Bollywood songs, (although there are other major players like YRF and Sony music, shows how ignorant he truly is) and how in its inception it used to sell duplicated cassettes, and moves on to say that they had links with the mafia. Then he moves on to insult India and Indians and makes the whole thing political. He tells T-series to hold their defecation, but we all know that’s a reference to the ‘Indians still shit on the streets’ jibe. The ghost-writer for hire, Boyinaband made a series of insinuating comments, like, “Next you need to fix the caste system” (Although it has been ages since we established ‘Equality before law’ under the Article 14 of the Constitution which ensures that every citizen shall be likewise protected by the laws of the country, and all this while I  think he had been living under a rock. With time, those that stick with the conventional views will change.

The video shows PewDiePie does not care about the far-flung implications of this. There are many Indians kids living abroad, and since PewDiePie’s audience mostly comprises of youths, they will be the ones subjected to racial slur and bullying. \n\nWe already saw how catastrophic this sub-war could be. In Christchurch, New Zealand, Indian Muslim immigrants were targeted at a mosque by a radical Australasian who said, “Subscribe to PewDiePie” before committing the horrible act.

Instead he only aggravates the situation to suit his personal agenda.\n\nIn truth, he would have never crossed the 70 million subscriber mark if T series was not there to give him competition. He created this whole corporate vs creator narrative to draw maximum support from his fellow youtubers, even though YouTube does not give recommendations based on number of subscribers. He accused T-series of using sub-bots (with no proof) and yet he encourages his braindead followers to keep making alternate accounts to subscribe him \\*ironic\\*. He accused T-series of cheating when it gained a lot of subscribers in a very short time (because he no concept of YouTube audits).

We are mostly consumers of the data that is being generated, not creators, we are mindlessly consuming all types of media be it news, videos or articles from all over the world. We have essentially outsourced all of our digital space to western or chinese companies. All this with little safeguards and checks in place.\n\nTake the example of tiktok, millions of people ogling over underage dancing girls wearing skimpy clothes.\n\nOr take porn, porn isn't some liberator of minds that some people think, watching a guy having sex with his step-sister isn't liberating, most of the content that is being watched by younger generation Indians, who haven't even developed the mental capacity to parse what is correct for them or not, are wanking to this stuff on a daily basis. \n\nSocial media websites have now become a toxic hell hole not to mention privacy nightmare. \n\nAnother good example is this pewdiepie vs t-series, it is not satire, it is racism and white supremacism disguised and repackaged in the form of satire or parody. I am not on any side, but any person with sufficient intelligence can see  through that. The worst thing about it is the amount of people supporting it, specially Indians. This stupid battle has perpetuated more racism than anything else.\n\nAll that cow, rape, poop, bob vagana , indianpeoplefacebook stereotype, is organized propaganda, you don't see any other culture or society being ridiculed like this, even if they are ridiculed they hit back and have their defense mechanism working. And this is not new, this racism always existed, before it was implicit, but after the rise of India in this digital era this racism has become explicit. \n\nHere is the most important thing, I don't blame them for any of it, it's us who is to be blamed, it is this ingrained deep seated inferiority complex that is working, we accept whatever they say to us, as if it is a universal truth.\n\n* You are the rape capital of the country, yes master we are.\n* You are street shitters, yes master we are.\n* There is a rape in the country, take it to the masters in the west and show them how bad are we. \n* Launched a satellite, master ko dikhane jaenge, yeh dekho my new toy.\n* Pewdiepie released a diss track, kya li hai bhai isne hum indians ki, maja aa gaya.\n* Youtube pe dekhenge ki, how much our masters like tikka masala, how much they like our bollywood songs. \n\nAll these cases of Indian looking for confirmation from 'white masters' is nothing but inferiority complex. This relationship is no different than a relationship between a human and a dog.\n\nThey didn't create the stereotype, we created ourselves. Rape captial!, are we really rape capital? All of us shit on streets? Who cares, it suites our ideology so hum wohi propaganda failayenge, I am really sick of leftists race to the  bottom on showing how bad our country is, most of you don't care to change the country you are just here to name and shame. That too not in this country only, we will shame internationally, sab milke we will bully this country into submission.\n\nAnd hamare desh ka right wing, kaise chutiya banaya bjp ne, pehle khud oppose kia FDI, fir khud bech khaye deskho FDI ke naam pe, gaddi milte hi. BJP ko sirf road banate ata hai aur kuch nahi. Yeh NCLAT ke naam pe abhi important strategic assets ko bech rahe hai India ke bahar. Are bhai, these ArcelorMittal's aren't any more clean than any other Indian company, sab corruption krte hai, Indian or Western. Yeh corruption free ka chutiyaap band kro. \n\nYeh left wale desh ki socially g\\*\\*\\* maar rahe hai, toh right wale economically.\n\nWhat to say about our NRI brothers, all those who left India because you consider this place a third world shit hole, then diss us back ya hume gyan c\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* ho, f\\*\\*\\* you.

I just watched it and let me tell you folks, it isn’t for people with a faint heart. It doesn’t really have any cliche “save the day” scenes and it fills you with hopelessness and rage. \n\nThe film was made by an Australian director, so half of the movie is following the hostages (who were white) taken by the terrorists. So, there isn’t a lot of focus on why NSG was late or how they cleared the buildings. But, it doesn’t have the cliche Hollywood guy saves the day thing which I really appreciate. There are scenes were they gun down innocent people which might be a bit hard to watch. \n\nThey should have focused on why mobile phones were used and how people were controlling them from Pakistan. The story behind their training and hijacking of the Indian fishing boat would have given more background info to the views who may not know about this. But, the film clearly shows the the attackers were muslims and it does show Indian security forces finally clearing the building. It mentioned that the perpetuators are freely living in Pakistan. \n\nBut, I’m happy that a non Indian director took time to introduce what was our deadliest terrorist attack to a western audience who may not have known about this. \n\nMy rating would be 8/10'<br />Author: 'SlytherinSlayer'  id: 'b7y7f2'<br />Score:50<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b7y7f2/have_any_of_you_seen_hotel_mumbai_here_is_my/</li>

Someone please relay this info to the top leaders and make a change."<br />Body: 'Most of my relatives like the current government\'s policies and want them to continue but they have posted terrible candidates in our state(Kerala). It is as if BJP purposefully do not want to win here. They had a chance in this election, but if they go like this, they are not going to make much of an impact.\n\nFor example, why is Thushar Vellappally posted in Thrissur constituency? What makes him a good candidate? He is casteist and has lot of cases of fraud going on against him or his family members, some even in foreign countries. Last year he was involved in a microfinance **scam**.

I have absolutely no idea why he was made the state president? Go watch one of his speeches and you will know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Few months ago I had written this comment**, and it seems BJP has not learned from any of their previous mistakes ---\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Kerala, Bjp has a good chance of winning some seats, but I feel they will blow away this chance by putting some bad candidates like last time. The problems with BJP which I noticed in the last election -\n\n1. They think the entire south is one culture, and one tactic will work. They put in Film/movie stars assuming they will easily win, like in Thiruvananthapuram, they had put freaking Sreesanth thinking "Put a sportsman and win". That would work in Tamil Nadu and Andra, but not in Kerala. Here, we are highly sceptical of such opportunistic people. It is important to understand such basic differences.\n2. The Main official leader of BJP in Kerala was an unappealing guy last time, and this time it is even worse. I have absolutely no idea why can\'t BJP find a better person? This guy doesn\'t even know to give a proper speech. He is not at all diplomatic/smart. I don\'t see that guy ever becoming a leader which people will like. I cringed when I first saw him talk.\n3. They had put candidates in wrong constituencies, like if a candidate was somewhat popular in location A, then instead of putting them in that constituency, they put him in location B to fight a strong opposition candidate. This candidate thus obviously loses in location B, but he had a chance of winning in location A. I don\'t understand what kinda strategy is that...\n4. You cannot win by shit-talking about Kerala. For example, the \'Modi comparing Kerala with Somalia\' incident. You may think it will make people question existing government and then they will vote for you just like how shitting on the 70years of congress rule works elsewhere. But, that is absolutely not going to happen here, instead everyone who had even the slightest intention to vote for you will abandon you like plague. People will only view it as an outsider coming here and shit-talking. Would you like if a British citizen comes to India, then completely shit-talk about the government, Indian culture, Indian history and India, and then ask you to vote for him?\n5. Religion based voting usually do not work here except for in Malappuram district where they only vote for muslims. But, this time it might work due to Sabarimala issue.\n6. Most people here are not aligned with any party. They will only vote for good candidates irrespective of the party including me. If I see a bad candidate of BJP, I am not going to vote for him just because Modi is at the toppest end of the party. That said, there are people who will strongly not vote for a candidate of a particular party, like for example, I will not vote for CPIM even if they put a good candidate because of their terrible current government who act like dictators.\n7. Parties over-estimate their vote-bank here. There are plenty of instances of very-good-candidates who have won at constituencies which was considered to be the other party\'s hardcore voter base. There are instances of good people standing as independent and winning against all parties. So, putting good likable candidates is the key which is more important than anything else.\n\nA strong campaign concentrated around "quick infrastructure development" like bullet train or expressways or startups have a good chance of working.'<br />Author: 'FadingMan'  id: 'b7kb2c'<br />Score:68<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b7kb2c/i_like_the_modi_government_but_i_and_many_others/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'A Big Year for the Indian Military in Space'<br />Body: 'The current year (2019) promises to bring much more than anyone could have expected with regard to Indian space applications of a military nature. The totally out-of-the-blue test of an ASAT weapon being case in point. In that spirit, I rounded up some of the important projects that have implications for the military, and are set to go into orbit (not always figuratively-speaking in this case!) this year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I head into discussing what is yet to come, I take a moment to mention what has already been done: On 24th January this year, ISRO’s PSLV-C44 launch mission had placed into orbit a rather mysterious satellite with very little-known specs &amp; even little-know mission profile –\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n…the **Microsat-R**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ktzosu82bap21.jpg\n\n There were many speculations on the purpose of this satellite and its payload, with assertions ranging from a Technology-Demonstration mission to a dedicated Reconnaissance payload. Although, given the unstable orbit of the satellite (a combined result of where it was placed and certain unexpected maneuvers which depleted its fuel), it’s unlikely to have been anything but a Tech-Demo platform.\xa0**The Microsat-R is the satellite believed to have been destroyed in the ASAT test on 27th March – after merely 2 months in orbit.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\++++\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother mission that deserves mention is of course, the ASAT weapon itself. Officially dubbed….\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n…the\xa0**PDV Mk-2**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n…developed by the nodal Defence Research &amp; Development Organisation (DRDO), the missile is basically an upper stage/nose section taken from the original PDV (an exo-atmospheric interceptor developed as part of Phase-I of the nation’s BMD program), combined with a lower boost stage that appears to be derived from a solid-fuel ballistic missile (most likely the K-4 SLBM, which itself draws on the tech of the land-based Agni-3 and Agni-5 missiles).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Pic credit: Press Information Bureau](https://i.redd.it/gxce8dlabap21.png)\n\n \n\nThe weapon, developed under the shrouded\xa0*Mission Shakti*,\xa0**reportedly destroyed the targeted satellite at an altitude of about \\~300 kilometers in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO).**\xa0The altitude, combined with the decaying orbit of the supposed target (Microsat-R) means that most, if not all, of the debris created by the destruction of the satellite would fall back to the Earth, burning up in the atmosphere, within an year’s time. A test against a satellite in a much higher orbit (like around the \\~850 kms mark, where the Chinese conducted their ASAT test back in 2007) would have resulted in the debris to largely stick around for near-indefinite periods, posing massive hazards to spacecraft.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The test, despite being aimed against a satellite, has even greater implications toward the BMD program and the mid-course interception capability against ballistic missiles.**\xa0This is a pivotal moment in India’s quest for self-sufficiency in offensive &amp; defensive uses of missile technology &amp; rocketry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ PDV \\(Mk-1\\), an Anti-Ballistic Missile \\(ABM\\) test-bed first launched in 2014.

Obviously, this is only the first step in the nation’s road to having a viable, deployed capability to target &amp; destroy the enemy’s satellites which support their reconnaissance, navigation, and communication abilities –\xa0**an important ability to have for a country that may well be one of the few nations who will draft a future Space Warfare-NPT.**\xa0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeautifully explained by defence journalist Saurav Jha here:\xa0[Mission Shakti cements India’s position at the ‘Space NPT’ high table](https://theprint.in/opinion/mission-shakti-cements-indias-position-at-the-space-npt-high-table/213596/)\n\n\\++++\n\nNow, moving on to what is yet to come…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EMISAT**\u200b  \n\n\nScheduled for launch very soon (1st of April), the EMISAT will share a ride alongside 28 other satellite payloads on ISRO’s PSLV-C45 mission. Much like the Microsat-R (which was developed by DRDO, not ISRO), the mission profile and purpose of the EMISAT remain a product of inference.\xa0**The most logical among which points at an ELINT-based mission &amp; payload.**\xa0Although the ‘official’ word is concerning “electromagnetic spectrum measurements”.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ The EMISAT and its co-passengers on the C45 mission being enclosed in the fairing of the PSLV. Pic credit: ISRO\u200b](https://i.redd.it/890t0ksmbap21.png)\n\n \n\nThe PSLV-C45 mission will also carry 24 American, 2 Lithuanian and a satellite each from Switzerland &amp; Spain, alongside the main EMISAT payload. Regarding the speculations on the purpose of its mission, I direct the reader to this well-written piece from Maxima Vigilantia:\xa0[ISRO’s EMISAT: Electronic Spy in Space](https://mark20x.blogspot.com/2018/12/isros-emisat-electronic-spy-in-space.html)\n\nAn excerpt:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n” The absence of large antenna (unless it has an unfurlable mesh antenna which isn’t visible in render)\xa0**indicates that EMISAT appears to be designed to intercept directed microwave transmissions. The microwave link between a satellite and ground station is highly directional. To intercept tight beam transmission, eavesdropper satellite has to be placed between the ground station and the target satellite. Another use of EMISAT is to determine the location of radar emitters (ground and naval) and command nodes.**\xa0A single EMISAT will be able to determine the probable location of radio emitters, however, for increased DF (direction finding) accuracy multiple satellites are required.\n\nAmerican SIGINT satellite Orion has a 255 feet diameter unfurlable antenna which can detect signals from a wristwatch-sized radio. Orion satellites are used for intercepting missile telemetry/datalink signals and monitoring microwave traffic.\xa0**SIGINT satellites like Orion are prohibitively expensive ($750 million each) for a country like India. EMISAT is a low-cost alternative. A cluster of EMISATs could mimic functions of a large satellite by sharing processing, communication and mission functions at a fraction of the cost.**\xa0“\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI leave the reader to draw their own conclusions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\++++\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CARTOSAT-3**\u200b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next-generation of Earth-imaging satellites from ISRO, and successor to the CARTOSAT-2 series. Scheduled for launch sometime in April on the PSLV-C46.\xa0**The previous generation (Cartosat-2) had panchromatic cameras that could provide a 1m resolution with 9.6 kms swath. The new Cartosat-3 is capable of 0.25m resolutions in panchromatic mode with 16 kms swath – a significant improvement.**\xa0Resolutions of about 1m in Multi-spectral mode and 12m in Hyper-spectral mode are also available on the 3rd Generation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/u2dodszsbap21.png\n\n The Cartosat-3 project was delayed multiple times owing to requirements toward finishing other pending missions (and recent re-directing of greater efforts toward the 2022 target for Human Spaceflight), and some further delays (possible slip into Q2 2019) cannot be ruled out at the moment. Like the -2, the -3 is only the forerunner of a series, which will include planned 3A and 3B missions as well: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/j9d8rmcvbap21.png\n\n \n\nAlthough the CARTOSAT series never had an explicitly stated strategic mission, the implications for the same are pretty obvious.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\++++\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RISAT-2BR1**\u200b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next in line in the RISAT category of dedicated military radar-reconnaissance satellites. The 2BR1 provides continuity of service from the RISAT-2 launched in 2009. The original RISAT-2 was an Israeli TecSAR-1 that had to be procured on an emergency basis owing to the delayed development of the rest of the RISAT family, which were all indigenous.\xa0**The RISAT series are equipped with a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) array, and the 2BR1 is no different. It carries the most advanced SAR array ever deployed by an Indian satellite**\xa0(the older TecSAR radar was already superseded in capability by the indigenous RISAT-1 launched in 2012, yes, the “1” was launched after the “2”).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ RISAT-2A. The 2BR1 arrangement of sensors will slightly differ, but the mission will be more or less the same.\u200b](https://i.redd.it/k5lja5j2cap21.jpg)\n\nThe 2BR1, weighing approximately 1.2 tons, is scheduled for a May 2019 launch, and\xa0**will be followed by additional -1 and -2 series sats, like the RISAT-2A, 2B (X-band) and RISAT-1A &amp; 1B (C-band) in the coming years (2020-21).**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Samples of RISAT-1’s typical imagery data](https://i.redd.it/m62f1my5cap21.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ RISAT-1 has a different arrangement of sensors \\(mostly owing to the different band used for SAR\\) compared to the 2-series](https://i.redd.it/okeiw2j8cap21.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*++++*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SSLV – Launch on Demand**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor purposes of this article, I would refer to this capability as\xa0**SLOD (Satellite Launch-on-Demand)**. This technology, currently being pursued by both India &amp; China,\xa0**affords the ability to quickly establish a level of satellite-based functions (mostly with regard to Earth-observation and monitoring military movements on the ground) with small cubesats in low(er) orbits, in the event the existing long-term (10-15 year lifespans) satellites are destroyed by an enemy’s ASAT weapons during active hostilities.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/fvn067becap21.png\n\n \n\nThe SSLV, the newest member of ISRO’s rocket family, is the platform which will afford India a real strategic SLOD capability. In the context of the inevitable militarization of space, I would broadly categorize the necessary capabilities into four sections:\n\na) Ability to launch large, long-term satellite payloads  \nb) Ability to knock down an opponent’s satellites  \nc) Ability to ‘snatch &amp; grab’ a satellite or other payload in space, and bring it back to Earth  \nd) Ability to quickly re-establish a limited satellite-based capability set in the event of existing sats being lost to enemy action and fixed launch pads being destroyed\n\nFrom the above four principle, basic needs for having a sound base for conducting Space-Warfare,\xa0**India already had A for a long time. B has just been live-tested. C will be afforded once the RLV-TD program matures into a Boeing X37B/C-analogue. And the SSLV will see to obtaining the capability represented in D.**\n\n**The solid-fuel SSLV can be fully prepared for launch on a 15-day notice. Compared to the 70-day preparation it takes for a current full fledged liquid-fueled space rocket like the PSLV. The modular stages of the SSLV are designed to be assembled by a skeleton crew in a matter of 72 hours, and the launch and pre-flight checks can be managed by a single Personal Computer**\xa0(these details excerpted from a report quoting ISRO’s chairman, link below). Like many technologies in this field, the SSLV is a thoroughly dual-use system. But for the purposes of this article, I’m only going over its military/strategic uses.\n\n[SSLV will offer cost-effective satellite launch options in India: Antrix CMD](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/science/sslv-will-offer-cost-effective-satellite-launch-options-in-india-antrix-cmd/articleshow/65740378.cms?from=mdr)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe SSLVs, owing to the nature of their solid-fuel stages, are more akin to a ballistic missile than a rocket – and to that effect, the SSLV (or a specific military variant developed from it) can be used by the Air Force in two different ways:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Strategic stockpiles of parts, such as the fuel/oxidizer stages, rocket motors, payload fairings and of course, the satellite payloads themselves, can be maintained in secure locations, ready to be assembled by a fully military-employed crew in the event of hostilities and rising tensions. These assembled LVs can then be either moved to military-owned launch pads (like the United States’ Vandenberg AFB) or put on mobile platforms for a more survivable launch system.\n* The fully assembled rocket, already mated with pre-determined payloads, can be stored in hermetically-sealed canisters (much like Agni-5 ballistic missiles or Brahmos cruise missiles) mounted on 16×16 or bigger all-terrain vechiles (like the Russian Topol-M ICBM). This is likely the more complicated of launch/storage options (not least because for precise orbital injections, liquid-fuel based Velocity Trimming Modules are used. But this could be mitigated by the future use of Ion thrusters (aka Hall Thrusters) on the payload bay. Similar thrusters, already being developed by ISRO, are generally used for in-space satellite propulsion for orbit-raising and trimming purposes), but also this is the more survivable one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’m sure the ideas for a submarine-launched SLOD is already floating in your heads by now.\n\nSpeaking of the rocket itself, it’s going to be 34m long, with a 2m diameter and weighing about 120 tons, with a payload capacity of 500 kgs to a 500 kms LEO orbit. Various payload-configurations are possible within that capacity, depending on the weight of the satellite(s):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/91ese6ricap21.png\n\n \n\nThe SSLV is set for a debut launch in Q3 (most likely August) this year, followed by another scheduled test either in Q4 or early 2020. In my opinion, the small SSLV deserves more watching that the big GSLV Mk-3s. Even in the civilian sector, the commercial implications bought forth by the SSLV will be tremendous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\++++\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SCE-200 Semi-Cryogenic Engine**\u200b  \n\n\nThe next step in big rocket propulsion for ISRO. Although it doesn’t have a direct strategic/military implication, it certainly has an indirect one – bigger rockets mean bigger payloads, and eventually &amp; inevitably, bigger military payloads. The first tests of the engine are likely to occur this year at ISRO’s Propulsion Complex in the high-altitude region of Mahendragiri.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ In a single \\(left\\), and a clustered configuration \\(right\\)\u200b](https://i.redd.it/ul6ukhuncap21.png)\n\n \n\n**The SCE-200 traces its lineage way back to the original Soviet RD-120 family of rocket engines. The designs (which although did not include engineering models and related documentation, which meant India had to develop a lot of tech to go with the design and adapt it) were transferred to India by Ukraine’s Yuzhnoye Design Office/Bureau – which had a hand in Soviet engine development before the 1991 break-up.**\xa0The Yuzhnoye design is called\xa0**RD-810**, and it was this design which was transferred.\n\nThe Chinese YF-100 and YF-115 engines, used today on Long March-5/6/7 rockets are also derived from the same RD-120 family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/9zswkboqcap21.png\n\n **All in all, the 2,000kN SCE-200 engines and its future derivatives will play an extremely crucial role in powering India’s future launch vechiles, such as the planned MLV family, with GTO payload capacities reaching 16 tons and LEO capacities reaching 41 tons (bigger than Ariane 64):** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ihg12ckscap21.png\n\n…besides having implications for the various re-usable launcher technologies being worked on at the moment by ISRO.

Current population is expected at 136.5 crores currently. Using the same population to household conversion the number of households would be 28.14 crores. Number of people per household is only going to decrease because of the demographic shift so 28.14 crores is the lower bound.\n\nNow congress is promising 20% poorest households will be covered under this scheme. So that would be 28.14/5=5.63 crore households.\n\n5.63 crores * 72,000= 4,05,360 crores. That is a big number but you don't know how big until you put that number in context.\n\nIn 2019-20 budget the total tax receipt is expected to be 17,05,046 crores, so this new expenditure will be approximately 24% of the tax revenue or one fourth of total tax revenue. Even if you include the non tax revenue of 2,72,647 crores, the total revenue only comes to 19,77,693 crores. So the cost of the scheme will still be more than 20% of all the revenue.\n\nI am not sure where all this money is going to come from. Unlike Modi's 15 lakh jumla they don't expect to get this money from black money in Swiss banks.\n\nIn short if Congress comes to power, boys we are fucked.

      <li>Title::: 'The Wire exposed spreading fake news again. Claimed ED officer investigating Nirav Modi had been transferred today. Denied directly by ED'<br />Body: 'Today exactly an hour before the Nirav Modi hearing was supposed to begin, the fake news machine Wire posted a story that ED IO investigating Nirav Modi has been removed from office. Social media was abuzz with this story, especially as Nirav Modi\'s hearing in UK courts was scheduled for today evening IST. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/thewire_in/status/1111657550594875393\n\nhttps://thewire.in/government/ed-officer-probing-nirav-modi-case-transferred-decision-reversed-within-hours\n\nThe article, as per usual wire\'s fake news standards, is pure propaganda and claims "political attempt to interfere" in Nirav Modi\'s bail hearing and investigation. Also makes some vague link to Arun Jaitley. \n\nAs soon as the article appeared, all the pidis were spinning it as if PM Modi had ordered to fire and change this investigator because he wanted Nirav Modi to get released on bail. The usual crap chowkidaar chor hai was trending briefly \n\nTurns out this is a bunch of fake news again, by the attention seeking troll swathi chaturvedi\n\nhttps://twitter.com/dir_ed/status/1111615048147828736\n\n&gt; Certain Media reports have been appearing that Joint Director supervising investigation in the case of Nirav Modi has been relieved. This report is not correct and denied\n\n(seems they have edited the article much later to include the rebuttal as well) \n\nAlmost every line in the article is fakenews \n\nFor example: \n\n&gt; Earlier, the British authorities said that India had not responded to an offer by the Serious Frauds Office in the UK for some documents to ensure Modi’s arrest. The public outcry after a Telegraph reporter in London tracked him down forced the Modi government to send the documents.\n\n\nThis has been denied, both by ED and SFO (uk). The interpretation of the wire is pretty desperate to say the least. The crux of the matter was that as per UK laws, any docs shared by India to UK could and should be shared by UK authorities to Nirav Modi. That basically means the evidence ED had against him could be given to Nirav Modi, at a time when he was not even co-operating with the investigation, thus putting the whole operation on the back foot. However these pathetic reporters leave out the pertinent legal aspects and go on to spin stories to brainwash retards \n\nThis article details the whole procedure to be followed, that includes several international laws and established procedure between 2 countries: http://www.uniindia.com/ed-clarifies-on-actions-taken-against-nirav-modi/india/news/1526581.html\n\n\nThese trolls at wire make libtards believe that UK arrested him based on the Telegraph video and Indian agencies/govt did nothing at all \n\n\nWire also includes crap like this :\n\n&gt; An angry senior official of the ED said: “They call themselves chowkidars, so why are they trying to help scamsters”.\n\nNo source, no names.. as per reporting standards, such a quote would be considered fake and manufactured. Yet Wire shamelessly carry such fabricated quotes. I find it really hard to believe that an investigating officer will talk to Wire (a no name, no repute fake news factory) about an ongoing investigation, risking not only the operation but also his job.\n\n\nIt seems, the main agenda behind publishing this story and the timing of it was likely to trend a bunch of lame tags on twitter in the hope that Nirav would get bail, and then pin the whole thing on PM Modi. \n\nUnfortunately for these asshats, he was denied bail. \n\nWire do have a good reason for their propaganda though - usually in the past, UK courts have simply junked such requests from India. You have Mallya, Lalit Modi, Sheetal Mafatlal, Tiger Hanif (bombing accused), Raymond Varkley (child sex offender) etc.. none of whom have been apprehended much less extradited to India.  \nIn Lalit Modi\'s case the courts simply threw out all requests (this was during UPA era). And in Gulshan Grover murder case,  a similar thing happened where Nadeem Saifi was never arrested and every UK court including High Court rubbished India\'s every requests to extradite him. So this Nirav Modi case was pretty much in the balance and based on past precedent, there was a good possibility that he would be granted bail. \n\nHowever he was not, which is one of the few times UK Courts have acted on Indian govt requests. This shows the weight of evidence Indian agencies have on him.  \n'<br />Author: 'MediumAdhesiveness5'  id: 'b73hun'<br />Score:90<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b73hun/the_wire_exposed_spreading_fake_news_again/</li>

I am a Gujarati speaker but i can easily understand Pure Standardized Prakrit, Hindi, most of Urdu, Marathi and bit of Kannada as almost all of these languages are using Sanskritic vocabulary.\n\n**2) Official Script -**\n\nwe have too many languages and Scripts that complicates learning other languages when Indians who speak one language migrate to other other state where official language or Script is different. we must Chose one official Script to write our all of languages to promote maximum integration of Indian People.\n\nI support using Standardized Prakrit with Devanagari script as our official language as Devanagari script is most widely used Script in India. languages such as Sanskrit,Hindi, Urdu, Marathi, Rajasthani, Punjabi, Haryanvi, Gujarati, Bengali etc all uses Devanagari script as either primary or secondary method of writing.\n\n**3) Promoting Native History -**\n\nwe must promote History of our own Native Kingdoms and empires who ruled our land and spread our Civilization and religions abroad.\n\nMauryan Empire, Cholan empire, Gupta empire, Rashtrakuta-Satvahana, Sunga, Rajput kingdoms, Harsha, Vikramaditya, Dahir, Brahmanshahi, Gurjara-pratihara, Pala-Sena etc are our own empires who promoted Indian culture, Civilization and religion and brought stability in India and expanded our influence outside. in order to reinstall national pride among people who were slaves for almost 800 to 1000 years of invaders from North we must promote our own Historic golden age among youth to revitalize their sprite.\n\n**4) Reforming Religion -**\n\nwe also need to Reform Hinduism as it's going bananas and almost every Pakhandi is claiming to be Baba and looting/fooling general public. this only makes people doubt their religion and loose interest in their gods. also there are some temples where people are drinking milk alongside filthy animals like Rats, this is dangerous to Human-life and we must stop these kind of practices as not only they are harmful but unnatural as well.\n\ni even prefer codifying all Hindu Gods into 3 Main god (Trinity of Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva) and one female goddess Sakhti like ancient brahmins did with Vishnu. reforming and codifying Hinduism will unite Hindus all over world and protect it from other religions who wants to destroy it and our way of life that we cherish [most.](https://most.it/) it will prevent curreption in future as well.\n\n**5) Monitoring foreign Religions -**\n\nlike China, Japan, Turkey, US etc we must monitor religions that have roots outside India and people who can impact out social life. we must put every religious building including Bahai house of worship, Temple, Mosque, Agiyari or Church under State control and get permission to elect Imams or Padri/Father by our government only.\n\nthis can prevent western or middle eastern stooges from influencing our people and nation from outside. just few days ago China forced Vatican to accept its authority over Chinese churches and Attaturk did same with Imams so i dont think we need to work hard in-order to Achieve this.\n\n**6) Censorship on Media -**\n\nas much as we don't want to become second China we have no option but censor or Media and internet. thousands of media houses are getting fat checks from western NGOs to promote their Agenda and parties by influencing Indians to achieve their Anti-India goals. sites like Schoop-Woop, BBC, Buzzfeed, the quint etc are well known to do such dirty job for western powers. imposing Censorship will keep these sites in check and we will prevent western Influence from destroying our country.\n\nremember, neither East or West is our Friend, we have no other friend in the world beside other Bhartiya.\n\n**7) controlling Internet -**\n\nlike i said above we need to follow Chinese and stop stealing of our data by foreign teach companies like Google, Twitter and Facebook . we need our own Search engine social media sites otherwise one day after china western powers will use data collected from Indians against us.\n\nthese are my points, please tell me what you think about steps i listed above to prevent another balkanization of India."<br />Author: 'RefinedBrahmin'  id: 'b6zblh'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b6zblh/steps_we_need_to_take_to_prevent_balkanization_of/</li>

      <li>Title::: "[Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Pakistan Day celebrated, Mueller report possibly gives a clean chit to Trump, and India's spymaster RN Kao"<br />Body: "Welcome to this week's edition of the Biweekly Geopolitics Thread, the premiere forum for discussing world affairs on this sub! Here, you can talk about the latest news from around the world - the discussion does not have to be related to India. To get the discussion started, here are a few top stories:\n\n# Top 3 stories from India's neighbourhood:\n\n1. [Pakistan celebrates Pakistan Day, anniversary of Lahore Resolution](https://www.dawn.com/news/1471381/pakistan-day-celebrations-civil-military-leaders-foreign-dignitaries-attend-military-parade-in-islamabad)\n\nPakistan celebrated Pakistan Day with a military parade, several ceremonies, and Malaysian PM Mahathir Mohamad as its Chief Guest. Pakistan Day is celebrated every March 23 to commemorate the Lahore Resolution of 1940, which was adopted by the then All India Muslim League for the ultimately successful demand for an independent Muslim homeland in the northwest and eastern parts of the Indian subcontinent. This year, six foreign contingents also participated in the military parade: Azerbaijan, China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Sri Lanka. Pakistan's foreign missions, including in New Delhi, also commemorated the day.\n\n2. [Military coalition government likely in Thailand](https://www.ft.com/content/59361e14-4eff-11e9-b401-8d9ef1626294)\n\nPreliminary results from Thailand's first democratic election since the 2014 military coup indicate that Pheu Thai, the civilian party of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, would emerge as the largest party in the lower house of Parliament, but well below its expected performance. Consequently, the military-backed party is expected to come second. However, the military selects 250 members of the upper house, and together with those elected to the lower house as well as a few smaller, pro-military parties, a military coalition is likely to form the next government. The former Prime Minister has already said that the elections were rigged, and delays in declaring results have added fuel to the fire.\n\n3. [US gains access to strategic Omani port (joins India)](https://gulfnews.com/world/gulf/oman/us-clinches-strategic-port-deal-with-oman-1.62896863)\n\nThe US has gained strategic access to the Omani port of Duqm in the Straits of Hormuz, a major choke-point controlled largely by the Iranian navy in the Gulf. While the deal is officially purely commercial in nature, there is little doubt that it will have a military component to it as well, as Iran has threatened to shut down the Straits in response to increase US pressure. Oman, which maintains a Switzerland-like state of neutrality in Middle East affairs, looks to transform Duqm into an economic powerhouse as it seeks to diversify its economy beyond oil. Previously, the Indian Navy [gained access](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/india-oman-may-talk-on-duqm-port-space-agency/articleshow/65927466.cms) to Duqm, and the Chinese also have an economic zone there (supposedly civilian).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Top 3 stories from the world:\n\n1. [Mueller report likely vindicates Trump on Russia collusion](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/mueller-report-appears-likely-to-validate-trump-claim-of-no-collusion-with-russia-to-win-election)\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller, who was appointed soon after the US presidential election of 2016, submitted his final report to the US Department of Justice, which in turn released a summary of the report as it looks to see what parts can be made public. The summary says that the Special Counsel cleared President Donald Trump and his campaign of any collusion with Russia in the 2016 election, a major point of contention that has hung over his head through his presidency. Opposition Democrats have long said that the Trump Campaign conspired with the Russian government to plant fake news on social media and hack their candidate, Hillary Clinton's emails. The investigation agrees that both those things happened, but the Trump Campaign had nothing to do with it. Separately, the report remained inconclusive on whether the President had tried to obstruct the investigation (an offense that could lead to impeachment), but the DOJ cleared him of the charge based on its internal standards. A fight to make the full report public is likely.\n\n2. [Chaos in UK over Brexit](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/25/uk/brexit-may-parliament-gbr-intl/index.html)\n\nChaos reigned in UK politics and London streets over the country's departure from the European Union, as pro- and anti-Brexit protesters took out rallies and MPs threatened to vote either which way. Following two defeats of the contentious Brexit deal in Parliament, the Speaker of the House of Commons refused to allow a third vote without substantial changes. Now, MPs are set to participate in an 'indicative vote,' which would tell the government what kind of deal could get support. Separately, rumours abound of a cabinet coup, with pro-Brexit ministers looking to oust Prime Minister Theresa May. In the middle of all this, the EU has agreed to extend the deadline for Brexit, but it needs to be endorsed by Parliament. Pro-Brexit MPs who are pushing for a clean Brexit have threatened to vote against the extension. \n\n3. [Cyclone Idai causes 750 reported deaths in Southern Africa](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/24/africa/mozambique-cyclone-idai-destruction/index.html)\n\nCyclone Idai, which developed in the Southern Indian Ocean and made landfall off the coast of Mozambique on March 15, has killed a reported 750 people, with over 450 of them in Mozambique itself, and the rest in Zimbabwe and Malawi. Widespread rains led to flooding and landslides, and aid workers reported seeing dead bodies floating in them, stoking fears of disease spreading. Already, Cholera cases are on the rise. The coastal city of Beira in Mozambique was the worst hit, with a reported 90% of its infrastructure destroyed. Several aid agencies and countries - including the Indian Navy - are engaged in relief operations there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: Rameshwar Nath Kao\n\nFor this week's geopoitical history, I thought we'd come closer home to explore the life of India's spymaster, RN Kao, who played a decisive role in India's security, including the establishment of our external intelligence agency, the Research &amp; Analysis Wing (RAW). Born in Varanasi in 1918 in the British-controlled United Provinces to a Kashmiri Pandit family, he joined the Indian Imperial Police Service in 1940, where he was deputed to the Intelligence Bureau (IB) during the fateful years of Independence. Kao maintained a thoroughly private life, having been photographed only twice (this was before smartphones!), but was known to be quite close to Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi. \n\nIn the years before and after independence, foreign intelligence was considered an afterthought (initially because the British took care of it, and afterwards out of political lethargy), and the IB was focused primarily on domestic intelligence. However, the 1962 Sino-Indian War, which led to a humiliating defeat for India under Nehru, and the 1965 Indo-Pakistan war led to a major rethink, with a separate agency being envisaged for external intelligence, both human and technical/signals in nature. In 1968, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi created RAW as a separate agency from the IB, with its chief holding the position of Secretary (Research) in the Cabinet Secretariat, a role that continues to this date. Kao became the first chief of RAW and was tasked with creating its foundation. \n\nUnder Kao, RAW grew quickly and had two major successes - the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 (where RAW trained the Mukti Bahini), and the Merger of Sikkim with India in 1975 (before that, Sikkim was similar to Bhutan). Kao remained head of RAW from 1969 to 1977, an unusually long period for a civil servant, primarily because of his closeness to Nehru and Gandhi, with her defeat after the Emergency being the catalyst for his resignation. In 1971, he also persuaded the government to setup India's Aviation Research Center (ARC) for aerial reconnaissance (aka spy planes), giving India a strong edge in border intelligence. Under Kao, India went from being an intelligence-deficient country to training intelligence agents from newly-independent African countries. \n\nKao continued to work with Indira and then Rajiv Gandhi after retiring from RAW. He is said to have played a role in the Golden Temple crisis as well as the LTTE in Sri Lanka. As security adviser to the government, he was instrumental in creating the National Security Guard (NSG) to address the Punjab terrorism crisis of the 1980s. Kao died on Jan 20, 2002 in Delhi, never having written a memoir and having largely shunned public glare. Few in India's history have had the effect on our national security as he had - and few have had the kind of long-term thinking that he did. \n\n 'As a people,we sometimes get carried away by euphoria or sink into gloom. It is quite clear that, so far as China is concerned, it would be a long haul for us. I remember that, in the mid fifties, while addressing an annual conference of the intelligence chiefs of the States, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had said that while our problems with Pakistan were acute and demanded urgent solution, our... problems with China would prove more intractable and continue for a long long time.'

This happened a few years back, me and my sis were going on activa to purchase a wall clock but I didn't know the exact route and I was not using google maps at that time. By mistake I got stuck in a muslim ghetto, three muslim boys started following me and catcalling my sis. The entire area was filled with women dressed as penguins and muslim men who didn't give a shit about what was happening. Now the ghetto was so freaking jam packed with these fuckers and pedophiles, I could not even accelerate, the roads were narrow and there were so many people walking , I could never start a fight with these primitive animals as I was in the wrong part of the city, I somehow managed to leave them behind. I got shit scared for my sis at that moment and could never forget it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother incident: my mom's friend was part of the census takers during 2001 census, she was assigned to take census of an area which had 2 muslim ghettos. She was 27 at that time. She went there on the first day, she actually experienced staring from these pedophiles on the very first day, each home had literally 7-8 children living in a small single room which was all these families had, the people seemed very hostile to the questions she was asking. So what she did was, take an approximate of the number of people living based on the total area and the area which she had already counted. She made up muslims names and filled up the forms, she was supposed to take census data for the next 4 days in these ghettos but she didn't. She was just frightened to even go there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe leftists say that Hindus are not secular, we have Islamophobia.

Main weapon of F22 is the same weapon we blocked, the AIM 120C5 missile. It can carry all variants apart from AIM 120D. It can carry that one too but at the price of converting it to a mere 4.5 gen baby.

      <li>Title::: 'Why I am an Atheist : Bhagat Singh'<br />Body: 'It is a matter of debate whether my lack of belief in the existence of an Omnipresent, Omniscient God is due to my arrogant pride and vanity. It never occurred to me that sometime in the future I would be involved in polemics of this kind. As a result of some discussions with my friends, (if my claim to friendship is not uncalled for) I have realised that after having known me for a little time only, some of them have reached a kind of hasty conclusion about me that my atheism is my foolishness and that it is the outcome of my vanity. Even then it is a serious problem. I do not boast of being above these human follies. I am, after all, a human being and nothing more. And no one can claim to be more than that. I have a weakness in my personality, for pride is one of the human traits that I do possess. I am known as a dictator among my friends. Sometimes I am called a boaster. Some have always been complaining that I am bossy and I force others to accept my opinion. Yes, it is true to some extent. I do not deny this charge. We can use the word ‘vainglory’ for it. As far as the contemptible, obsolete, rotten values of our society are concerned, I am an extreme sceptic. But this question does not concern my person alone. It is being proud of my ideas, my thoughts. It cannot be called empty pride. Pride, or you may use the word, vanity, both mean an exaggerated assessment of one’s personality. Is my atheism because of unnecessary pride, or have I ceased believing in God after thinking long and deep on the matter? I wish to put my ideas before you. First of all, let us differentiate between pride and vanity as these are two different things.\nI have never been able to understand how unfounded, baseless pride or empty vanity can hinder a person from believing in God. I may refuse to acknowledge the greatness of a really great person only when I have got fame without doing any serious efforts or when I lack the superior mental powers necessary to become great. It is easy to understand but how is it possible that a believer can turn into a non-believer because of his vanity? Only two things are possible: either a man deems himself to be in possession of Godly qualities, or he goes a step further and declares himself to be a god. In both these states of mind he cannot be an atheist in the true sense of the word. In the first case, it is not an outright rejection of God’s existence; in the other, he is affirming the existence of some kind of supernatural power responsible for the working of universe. It does not harm our argument whether he claims to be a god or considers God to be a reality in existence above his own being. The real point, however, is that in both cases he is a theist, a believer. He is not an atheist. I want to bring home this point to you. I am not one of these two creeds. I totally reject the existence of an Omnipresent, all powerful, all knowing God. Why so? I will discuss it later in the essay. Here I wish to emphasise that I am not an atheist for the reason that I am arrogant or proud or vain; nor am I a demi-god, nor a prophet; no, nor am I God myself. At least one thing is true that I have not evolved this thought because of vanity or pride. In order to answer this question I relate the truth. My friends say that after Delhi bombing and Lahore Conspiracy Case, I rocketed to fame and that this fact has turned my head. Let us discuss why this allegation is incorrect. I did not give up my belief in God after these incidents. I was an atheist even when I was an unknown figure. At least a college student cannot cherish any sort of exaggerated notion of himself that may lead him to atheism. It is true that I was a favourite with some college teachers, but others did not like me. I was never a hardworking or studious boy. I never got an opportunity to be proud. I was very careful in my behaviour and somewhat pessimistic about my future career. I was not completely atheistic in my beliefs. I was brought up under the care and protection of my father. He was a staunch Arya Samaji. An Arya Samaji can be anything but never an atheist. After my elementary education, I was sent to D. A. V College, Lahore. I lived in the boarding house for one year. Besides prayers early in the morning and at dusk time, I sat for hours and chanted religious Mantras. At that time, I was a staunch believer. Then I lived with my father. He was a tolerant man in his religious views. It is due to his teachings that I devoted my life for the cause of liberating my country. But he was not an atheist. His God was an all-pervading Entity. He advised me to offer my prayers every day. In this way I was brought up. In the Non-cooperation days, I got admission to the National College. During my stay in this college, I began thinking over all the religious polemics such that I grew sceptical about the existence of God. In spite of this fact I can say that my belief in God was firm and strong. I grew a beard and ‘Kais’ (long head of hair as a Sikh religious custom). In spite of this I could not convince myself of the efficacy of Sikh religion or any religion at all, for that matter. But I had an unswerving, unwavering belief in God.\nThen I joined the Revolutionary Party. The first leader I met had not the courage to openly declare himself an atheist. He was unable to reach any conclusion on this point. Whenever I asked him about the existence of God, he gave me this reply: “You may believe in him when you feel like it.” The second leader with whom I came in contact was a firm believer. I should mention his name. It was our respected Comrade Sachindara Nath Sanyal. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in connection with Karachi conspiracy case. Right from the first page of his only book, ‘Bandi Jivan’ (Incarnated Life) he sings praises to the Glory of God. See the last page of the second part of this book and you find praises showered upon God in the way of a mystic. It is a clear reflection of his thoughts.\nAccording to the prosecution, the ‘Revolutionary Leaflet’ which was distributed throughout India was the outcome of Sachindara Nath Sanyal’s intellectual labour. So often it happens that in revolutionary activities a leader expresses his own ideas which may be very dear to him, but in spite of having differences, the other workers have to acquiesce in them.\nIn that leaflet, one full paragraph was devoted to the praises of God and His doings which we, human beings, cannot understand. This is sheer mysticism. What I want to point out is that the idea of denying the existence of God did not even occur to the Revolutionary Party. The famous Kakory martyrs, all four of them, passed their last day in prayers. Ram Parshad Bismal was a staunch Arya Samaji. In spite of his vast studies in Socialism and Communism, Rajan Lahiri could not suppress his desire to recite hymns from Upanishads and Gita. There was but only one person among them who did not indulge in such activities. He used to say, “Religion is the outcome of human weakness or the limitation of human knowledge.” He is also in prison for life. But he also never dared to deny the existence of God.\nTill that time I was only a romantic revolutionary, just a follower of our leaders. Then came the time to shoulder the whole responsibility. For some time, a strong opposition put the very existence of the party into danger. Many leaders as well as many enthusiastic comrades began to uphold the party to ridicule. They jeered at us. I had an apprehension that some day I will also consider it a futile and hopeless task. It was a turning point in my revolutionary career. An incessant desire to study filled my heart. ‘Study more and more’, said I to myself so that I might be able to face the arguments of my opponents. ‘Study’ to support your point of view with convincing arguments. And I began to study in a serious manner. My previous beliefs and convictions underwent a radical change. The romance of militancy dominated our predecessors; now serious ideas ousted this way of thinking. No more mysticism! No more blind faith! Now realism was our mode of thinking. At times of terrible necessity, we can resort to extreme methods, but violence produces opposite results in mass movements. I have talked much about our methods. The most important thing was a clear conception of our ideology for which we were waging a long struggle. As there was no election activity going on, I got ample opportunity to study various ideas propounded by various writers. I studied Bakunin, the anarchist leader. I read a few books of Marx, the father of Communism. I also read Lenin and Trotsky and many other writers who successfully carried out revolutions in their countries. All of them were atheists. The ideas contained in Bakunin’s ‘God and State’ seem inconclusive, but it is an interesting book. After that I came across a book ‘Common Sense’ by Nirlamba Swami. His point of view was a sort of mystical atheism. I developed more interest in this subject. By the end of 1926, I was convinced that the belief in an Almighty, Supreme Being who created, guided and controlled the universe had no sound foundations. I began discussions on this subject with my friends. I had openly declared myself an atheist. What it meant will be discussed in the following lines.\nIn May 1927, I was arrested in Lahore. This arrest came as a big surprise for me. I had not the least idea that I was wanted by the police. I was passing through a garden and all of a sudden the police surrounded me. To my own surprise, I was very calm at that time. I was in full control of myself. I was taken into police custody. The next day I was taken to the Railway Police lockup where I spent a whole month. After many days’ conversation with police personnel, I guessed that they had some information about my connection with the Kakori Party. I felt they had some intelligence of my other activities in the revolutionary movement. They told me that I was in Lucknow during the Kakori Party Trial so that I might devise a scheme to rescue the culprits. They also said that after the plan had been approved, we procured some bombs and by way of test, one of those bombs was thrown into a crowd on the occasion of Dussehra in 1926. They offered to release me on condition that I gave a statement on the activities of the Revolutionary Party. In this way I would be set free and even rewarded and I would not be produced as an approver in the court. I could not help laughing at their proposals. It was all humbug. People who have ideas like ours do not throw bombs at their own innocent people. One day, Mr. Newman, the then senior Superintendent of CID, came to me. After a long talk which was full of sympathetic words, he imparted to me what he considered to be sad news, that if I did not give any statement as demanded by them, they would be forced to send me up for trial for conspiracy to wage war in connection with Kakori Case and also for brutal killings in Dussehra gathering. After that he said that he had sufficient evidence to get me convicted and hanged.\nI was completely innocent, but I believed that the police had sufficient power to do it if they desired it to be so. The same day some police officers persuaded me to offer my prayers to God two times regularly. I was an atheist. I thought that I would settle it to myself whether I could brag only in days of peace and happiness that I was an atheist, or in those hard times I could be steadfast in my convictions. After a long debate with myself, I reached the conclusion that I could not even pretend to be a believer nor could I offer my prayers to God. No, I never did it. It was time of trial and I would come out of it successful. These were my thoughts. Never for a moment did I desire to save my life. So I was a true atheist then and I am an atheist now. It was not an easy task to face that ordeal. Beliefs make it easier to go through hardships, even make them pleasant. Man can find a strong support in God and an encouraging consolation in His Name. If you have no belief in Him, then there is no alternative but to depend upon yourself. It is not child’s play to stand firm on your feet amid storms and strong winds. In difficult times, vanity, if it remains, evaporates and man cannot find the courage to defy beliefs held in common esteem by the people. If he really revolts against such beliefs, we must conclude that it is not sheer vanity; he has some kind of extraordinary strength. This is exactly the situation now. First of all we all know what the judgement will be. It is to be pronounced in a week or so. I am going to sacrifice my life for a cause. What more consolation can there be! A God-believing Hindu may expect to be reborn a king; a Muslim or a Christian might dream of the luxuries he hopes to enjoy in paradise as a reward for his sufferings and sacrifices. What hope should I entertain? I know that will be the end when the rope is tightened round my neck and the rafters move from under my feet. To use more precise religious terminology, that will be the moment of utter annihilation. My soul will come to nothing. If I take the courage to take the matter in the light of ‘Reward’, I see that a short life of struggle with no such magnificent end shall itself be my ‘Reward.’ That is all. Without any selfish motive of getting any reward here or in the hereafter, quite disinterestedly have I devoted my life to the cause of freedom. I could not act otherwise. The day shall usher in a new era of liberty when a large number of men and women, taking courage from the idea of serving humanity and liberating them from sufferings and distress, decide that there is no alternative before them except devoting their lives for this cause. They will wage a war against their oppressors, tyrants or exploiters, not to become kings, or to gain any reward here or in the next birth or after death in paradise; but to cast off the yoke of slavery, to establish liberty and peace they will tread this perilous, but glorious path. Can the pride they take in their noble cause be called vanity? Who is there rash enough to call it so? To him I say either he is foolish or wicked. Leave such a fellow alone for he cannot realise the depth, the emotions, the sentiment and the noble feelings that surge in that heart. His heart is dead, a mere lump of flesh, devoid of feelings. His convictions are infirm, his emotions feeble. His selfish interests have made him incapable of seeing the truth. The epithet ‘vanity’ is always hurled at the strength we get from our convictions.\nYou go against popular feelings; you criticise a hero, a great man who is generally believed to be above criticism. What happens? No one will answer your arguments in a rational way; rather you will be considered vainglorious. Its reason is mental insipidity. Merciless criticism and independent thinking are the two necessary traits of revolutionary thinking. As Mahatmaji is great, he is above criticism; as he has risen above, all that he says in the field of politics, religion, Ethics is right. You agree or not, it is binding upon you to take it as truth. This is not constructive thinking. We do not take a leap forward; we go many steps back.\nOur forefathers evolved faith in some kind of Supreme Being, therefore, one who ventures to challenge the validity of that faith or denies the existence of God, shall be called a Kafir (infidel), or a renegade. Even if his arguments are so strong that it is impossible to refute them, if his spirit is so strong that he cannot be bowed down by the threats of misfortune that may befall him through the wrath of the Almighty, he shall be decried as vainglorious. Then why should we waste our time in such discussions? This question has come before the people for the first time, hence the necessity and usefulness of such long discussions.\nAs far as the first question is concerned, I think I have made it clear that I did not turn atheist because of vanity. Only my readers, not I, can decide whether my arguments carry weight. If I were a believer, I know in the present circumstances my life would have been easier; the burden lighter. My disbelief in God has turned all the circumstances too harsh and this situation can deteriorate further. Being a little mystical can give the circumstances a poetic turn. But I need no opiate to meet my end. I am a realistic man. I want to overpower this tendency in me with the help of Reason. I am not always successful in such attempts. But it is man’s duty to try and make efforts. Success depends on chance and circumstances.\nNow we come to the second question: if it is not vanity, there ought to be some sound reason for rejection of age-old belief in God. Yes, I come to this question. I think that any man who has some reasoning power always tries to understand the life and people around him with the help of this faculty. Where concrete proofs are lacking, [mystical] philosophy creeps in. As I have indicated, one of my revolutionary friends used to say that “philosophy is the outcome of human weakness.” Our ancestors had the leisure to solve the mysteries of the world, its past, its present and its future, its whys and its wherefores, but having been terribly short of direct proofs, every one of them tried to solve the problem in his own way. Hence we find wide differences in the fundamentals of various religious creeds. Sometimes they take very antagonistic and conflicting forms. We find differences in Oriental and Occidental philosophies. There are differences even amongst various schools of thoughts in each hemisphere. In Asian religions, the Muslim religion is completely incompatible with the Hindu faith. In India itself, Buddhism and Jainism are sometimes quite separate from Brahmanism. Then in Brahmanism itself, we find two conflicting sects: Aarya Samaj and Snatan Dheram. Charwak is yet another independent thinker of the past ages. He challenged the Authority of God. All these faiths differ on many fundamental questions, but each of them claims to be the only true religion. This is the root of the evil. Instead of developing the ideas and experiments of ancient thinkers, thus providing ourselves with the ideological weapon for the future struggle, – lethargic, idle, fanatical as we are – we cling to orthodox religion and in this way reduce human awakening to a stagnant pool.\nIt is necessary for every person who stands for progress to criticise every tenet of old beliefs. Item by item he has to challenge the efficacy of old faith. He has to analyse and understand all the details. If after rigorous reasoning, one is led to believe in any theory of philosophy, his faith is appreciated. His reasoning may be mistaken and even fallacious. But there is chance that he will be corrected because Reason is the guiding principle of his life. But belief, I should say blind belief is disastrous. It deprives a man of his understanding power and makes him reactionary.\nAny person who claims to be a realist has to challenge the truth of old beliefs. If faith cannot withstand the onslaught of reason, it collapses. After that his task should be to do the groundwork for new philosophy. This is the negative side. After that comes in the positive work in which some material of the olden times can be used to construct the pillars of new philosophy. As far as I am concerned, I admit that I lack sufficient study in this field. I had a great desire to study the Oriental Philosophy, but I could get ample opportunity or sufficient time to do so. But so far as I reject the old time beliefs, it is not a matter of countering belief with belief, rather I can challenge the efficacy of old beliefs with sound arguments. We believe in nature and that human progress depends on the domination of man over nature. There is no conscious power behind it. This is our philosophy.\nBeing atheist, I ask a few questions from theists:\n1. If, as you believe there is an Almighty, Omnipresent, Omniscient God, who created the earth or universe, please let me know, first of all, as to why he created this world. This world which is full of woe and grief, and countless miseries, where not even one person lives in peace.\n2. Pray, don’t say it is His law. If He is bound by any law, He is not Omnipotent. Don’t say it is His pleasure. Nero burnt one Rome. He killed a very limited number of people. He caused only a few tragedies, all for his morbid enjoyment. But what is his place in history? By what names do we remember him? All the disparaging epithets are hurled at him. Pages are blackened with invective diatribes condemning Nero: the tyrant, the heartless, the wicked.\nOne Genghis Khan killed a few thousand people to seek pleasure in it and we hate the very name. Now, how will you justify your all powerful, eternal Nero, who every day, every moment continues his pastime of killing people? How can you support his doings which surpass those of Genghis Khan in cruelty and in misery inflicted upon people? I ask why the Almighty created this world which is nothing but a living hell, a place of constant and bitter unrest. Why did he create man when he had the power not to do so? Have you any answer to these questions? You will say that it is to reward the sufferer and punish the evildoer in the hereafter. Well, well, how far will you justify a man who first of all inflicts injuries on your body and then applies soft and soothing ointment on them? How far the supporters and organizers of Gladiator bouts were justified in throwing men before half starved lions, later to be cared for and looked after well if they escaped this horrible death. That is why I ask: Was the creation of man intended to derive this kind of pleasure?\nOpen your eyes and see millions of people dying of hunger in slums and huts dirtier than the grim dungeons of prisons; just see the labourers patiently or say apathetically while the rich vampires suck their blood; bring to mind the wastage of human energy that will make a man with a little common sense shiver in horror. Just observe rich nations throwing their surplus produce into the sea instead of distributing it among the needy and deprived. There are palaces of kings built upon the foundations laid with human bones. Let them see all this and say “All is well in God’s Kingdom.” Why so? This is my question. You are silent. All right. I proceed to my next point.\nYou, the Hindus, would say: Whosoever undergoes sufferings in this life, must have been a sinner in his previous birth. It is tantamount to saying that those who are oppressors now were Godly people then, in their previous births. For this reason alone they hold power in their hands. Let me say it plainly that your ancestors were shrewd people. They were always in search of petty hoaxes to play upon people and snatch from them the power of Reason. Let us analyse how much this argument carries weight!\nThose who are well versed in the philosophy of Jurisprudence relate three of four justifications for the punishment that is to be inflicted upon a wrong-doer. These are: revenge, reform, and deterrence. The Retribution Theory is now condemned by all the thinkers. Deterrent theory is on the anvil for its flaws. Reformative theory is now widely accepted and considered to be necessary for human progress. It aims at reforming the culprit and converting him into a peace-loving citizen. But what in essence is God’s Punishment even if it is inflicted on a person who has really done some harm? For the sake of argument we agree for a moment that a person committed some crime in his previous birth and God punished him by changing his shape into a cow, cat, tree, or any other animal. You may enumerate the number of these variations in Godly Punishment to be at least eighty-four lack. Tell me, has this tomfoolery, perpetrated in the name of punishment, any reformative effect on human man? How many of them have you met who were donkeys in their previous births for having committed any sin? Absolutely no one of this sort! The so called theory of ‘Puranas’ (transmigration) is nothing but a fairy-tale. I do not have any intention to bring this unutterable trash under discussion. Do you really know the most cursed sin in this world is to be poor? Yes, poverty is a sin; it is a punishment! Cursed be the theoretician, jurist or legislator who proposes such measures as push man into the quagmire of more heinous sins. Did it not occur to your All Knowing God or he could learn the truth only after millions had undergone untold sufferings and hardships? What, according to your theory, is the fate of a person who, by no sin of his own, has been born into a family of low caste people? He is poor so he cannot go to a school. It is his fate to be shunned and hated by those who are born into a high caste. His ignorance, his poverty, and the contempt he receives from others will harden his heart towards society. Supposing that he commits a sin, who shall bear the consequences? God, or he, or the learned people of that society? What is your view about those punishments inflicted on the people who were deliberately kept ignorant by selfish and proud Brahmans? If by chance these poor creatures heard a few words of your sacred books, Vedas, these Brahmans poured melted lead into their ears. If they committed any sin, who was to be held responsible? Who was to bear the brunt? My dear friends, these theories have been coined by the privileged classes. They try to justify the power they have usurped and the riches they have robbed with the help of such theories. Perhaps it was the writer Upton Sinclair who wrote (Bhagat Singh is referring to Sinclair’s pamphlet ‘Profits of Religion’ – MIA transcriber) somewhere “only make a man firm believer in the immortality of soul, then rob him of all that he possesses. He will willingly help you in the process.” The dirty alliance between religious preachers and possessors of power brought the boon of prisons, gallows, knouts and above all such theories for the mankind.\nI ask why your Omnipotent God does not hold a man back when he is about to commit a sin or offence. It is child’s play for God. Why did He not kill war lords? Why did He not obliterate the fury of war from their minds? In this way He could have saved humanity of many a great calamity and horror. Why does He not infuse humanistic sentiments into the minds of the Britishers so that they may willingly leave India? I ask why He does not fill the hearts of all capitalist classes with altruistic humanism that prompts them to give up personal possession of the means of production and this will free the whole labouring humanity from the shackles of money. You want to argue the practicability of Socialist theory, I leave it to your Almighty God to enforce it. Common people understand the merits of Socialist theory as far as general welfare is concerned but they oppose it under the pretext that it cannot be implemented. Let the Almighty step in and arrange things in a proper way. No more logic chopping! I tell you that the British rule is not there because God willed it but for the reason that we lack the will and courage to oppose it. Not that they are keeping us under subjugation with the consent of God, but it is with the force of guns and rifles, bombs and bullets, police and militia, and above all because of our apathy that they are successfully committing the most deplorable sin, that is, the exploitation of one nation by another. Where is God? What is He doing? Is He getting a diseased pleasure out of it? A Nero! A Genghis Khan! Down with Him!\nNow another piece of manufactured logic! You ask me how I will explain the origin of this world and origin of man. Charles Darwin has tried to throw some light on this subject. Study his book. Also, have a look at Sohan Swami’s “Commonsense.” You will get a satisfactory answer. This topic is concerned with Biology and Natural History. This is a phenomenon of nature. The accidental mixture of different substances in the form of Nebulae gave birth to this earth. When? Study history to know this. The same process caused the evolution of animals and in the long run that of man. Read Darwin’s ‘Origin of Species.’ All the later progress is due to man’s constant conflict with nature and his efforts to utilise nature for his own benefit. This is the briefest sketch of this phenomenon.\nYour next question will be why a child is born blind or lame even if he was not a sinner in his previous birth. This problem has been explained in a satisfactory manner by biologists as a mere biological phenomenon. According to them the whole burden rests upon the shoulders of parents whose conscious or unconscious deeds caused mutilation of the child prior to his birth.\nYou may thrust yet another question at me, though it is merely childish. The question is: If God does not really exist, why do people come to believe in Him? Brief and concise my answer will be. As they come to believe in ghosts, and evil spirits, so they also evolve a kind of belief in God: the only difference being that God is almost a universal phenomenon and well developed theological philosophy. However, I do disagree with radical philosophy. It attributes His origin to the ingenuity of exploiters who wanted to keep the people under their subjugation by preaching the existence of a Supreme Being; thus claimed an authority and sanction from Him for their privileged position. I do not differ on the essential point that all religions, faiths, theological philosophies, and religious creeds and all other such institutions in the long run become supporters of the tyrannical and exploiting institutions, men and classes. Rebellion against any king has always been a sin in every religion.\nAs regard the origin of God, my thought is that man created God in his imagination when he realized his weaknesses, limitations and shortcomings. In this way he got the courage to face all the trying circumstances and to meet all dangers that might occur in his life and also to restrain his outbursts in prosperity and affluence. God, with his whimsical laws and parental generosity was painted with variegated colours of imagination. He was used as a deterrent factor when his fury and his laws were repeatedly propagated so that man might not become a danger to society. He was the cry of the distressed soul for he was believed to stand as father and mother, sister and brother, brother and friend when in time of distress a man was left alone and helpless. He was Almighty and could do anything. The idea of God is helpful to a man in distress.\nSociety must fight against this belief in God as it fought against idol worship and other narrow conceptions of religion. In this way man will try to stand on his feet. Being realistic, he will have to throw his faith aside and face all adversaries with courage and valour. That is exactly my state of mind. My friends, it is not my vanity; it is my mode of thinking that has made me an atheist. I don’t think that by strengthening my belief in God and by offering prayers to Him every day, (this I consider to be the most degraded act on the part of man) I can bring improvement in my situation, nor can I further deteriorate it. I have read of many atheists facing all troubles boldly, so I am trying to stand like a man with the head high and erect to the last; even on the gallows.\nLet us see how steadfast I am. One of my friends asked me to pray. When informed of my atheism, he said, “When your last days come, you will begin to believe.” I said, “No, dear sir, Never shall it happen. I consider it to be an act of degradation and demoralisation. For such petty selfish motives, I shall never pray.” Reader and friends, is it vanity? If it is, I stand for it.'<br />Author: 'Large_Bumblebee'  id: 'b4fnmo'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b4fnmo/why_i_am_an_atheist_bhagat_singh/</li>

This Holi is specially unique because today is Vernal Equinox, the day and night are equal. Holi is supposed to be celebrated on vernal equinox, but deviates +/-15 days because of lunar considerations (has to be on full moon). \n\nToday the rate of increase of duration of day is maximum, and it will reach a maxima at summer solstice (Dakshinayana), where the rate of increase of duration would be zero.  \n\nBharatiya people have traditionally observed three main branches of festivals, all branches of festivals mainly governed by the position of the Sun in the sky. \n\nOne is spring festivals OR Vasantotsav. This includes Basanta-Panchami, Holi, Chaitra-Navratri, and even Vaisakhi/Bohag.

These festivals are mostly about harvest and celebration of life. \n\nThe second branch is that of Sharada festivals. Traditionally Indians have considered Sharada as starting of new year, hence came the word Sharada for year, (and Saal its Hindi variant). Zoroastrians also called the year, Saredha. Sharada includes Navratri, Dussehra, Diwali and Sharada Poornima. These festivals are the most bright and night is their kingdom.\n\nThe third branch is that of Uttarayan, where we celebrate Gudi Padwa, Makar Sankranti, Lohri and Pongal. These festivals are an overcompensation for rather cold and restrictionary natural environment.\n\nA fourth minor branch of festivals is in monsoon, which includes festivals like Teej and Paryushan. They are mostly restrictionary in contrast to a very active natural environment. \n\nGuru Poornima is the festival that falls around Dakshinayana, and is mainly restricted to ascetic life. \n\n&gt;  What I just described above is one of the ways we can understand the huge list of our festivals in a rather simple manner. Now I would try to list down the meanings certain words that pertain to this topic. \n\nVasanta : Vatsara-Anta (year-end) is the moment of completion of year. Obviously, it is also the starting of the year. Since Phalguna is the month when this happens, Phalguna is also called Vasantaka.\n\nSharada : Though it is literally translated as autumn, but autumn is wrong translation. Sharada has no translation in English. Sharada literally means cold, hence giving the Hindi variant Sardi. Sharada is the bonafide word for year in both Sanskrit and Avestan. Sharada was celebrated as new year (in Gujarat it still happens). All others have somewhat moved to Vasanta. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs I just described how Sharada is not autumn, and has really no English translation, there are plenty of concepts and words that not available to translation. \n\n&gt; This is an excerpt from a conversation I had with my friend on "Differences between Indian and Western Episteme" and how deep the colonialism has seeped into us. My friend had asked me about the difference between words Respect and Sammaan\n  \nA simple translation for respect is sam-maan. But are they the same thing ?\n\nSam-maan --&gt; equal minding, it means holding subjects on equal ground, standing. It is like bringing everyone to a platform. \n\nRe + spect --&gt; to look again, it means to consider someone, to give attention to. \n\nThese are two very very different words. One is about giving a standing, and other is about giving attention. \n\nThis simple duo is enough to show how different the worlds of two languages could be and what do they tell about their cultures. I will try to cover more on this topic in upcoming week, so stay tuned.\n\n\n\n\n\n'<br />Author: 'decoder007'  id: 'b3pzyw'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b3pzyw/streetside_linguistics_12/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Why does foreign media like BBC and Washington Post always side with Congress party of India so much?'<br />Body: "I've been thinking about this today, and here is why I think it is:\n\n1. Congress downplays the atrocities done by the British on Indians during their colonial rule. Hell, Nehru was pretty much friends with them, so doing that won't be much comfortable for Congress. BJP criticizes the British colonial rule and exposes them.\n2. Congress appeases to muslims a lot which fits well with the present British/EU pseudo-liberal ideology.\n\nWhat else could be the reason?"<br />Author: 'the_php_coder'  id: 'b3mypp'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b3mypp/why_does_foreign_media_like_bbc_and_washington/</li>
