      <li>Title::: 'Medical Diaries: My experience working in a Government hospital'<br />Body: 'I am an Orthopaedic Surgeon and this is my story; dealing with my experience working in a government hospital\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GOVERNMENT SECTOR IS DIVINE (\\*conditions apply)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was quite young when I joined  a government hospital for work not knowing what to expect. I loved working in the government sector, it was busy as hell, but the young blooded me loved it. It was like a race to help as many people as you can in a day and you felt good. The spiritual bliss that you get from a good days work, no amount of money can achieve that.\n\nI am not saying this just because I earn less and have to convince myself that "all is well". It really is something else. But yes, it is not sustainable. You cannot work like that as you get older since your body can\'t keep up with the pace. I would sometimes come home in vicious pain after a long day of surgery, fall on the couch, look up and smile, thinking to myself, "today was a goddamn awesome day". I wouldn\'t be able to move so mostly my wife would take pity on me and get me food, sometimes leaving me on the couch to sleep for the night. It might sound miserable to IT workers (like my younger brother who out earns me 7 times) or my engineer parents who are doing even better. But there is something to this kind of life that can\'t be achieved by running just behind money.\n\nContrary to the information in media, the life of a doctor is very different. It might sound smug saying this but a lot of doctors don\'t run behind money, specifically because of two reasons, one is you will always earn a decent amount and second you will never have time to spend that money. We are like honey bees in that matter, we keep collecting honey but someone else will take its benefits. That doesn\'t stop us from chasing flowers. Also most doctors aren\'t rich but none of them are poor. Enough about the financial aspects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PROS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Work satisfaction ; on a different level, almost divine and unparalleled**\n* **Decent Pay (for middle class it is a good pay Rs.80k-120k pm)**\n* **Decent Work hours**\n* **No pressures from management or non-medical staff**\n* **No fear of extortion with false cases**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGovernment sector has some major flaws. The allied paramedical staff do not want to work and treat it like any other job. This means putting someone\'s life at risk. This means that sometimes doctors have to start doing the job of a nurse, ward boy and even cleaners job. We were forced to do this and I happily obliged saying this is Gods work, being given the opportunity to save someone from misery. But again it is not sustainable. I am bound to get old and the more other people heap their work on me, the less I can do my own work. Another problem is that a lot of the techniques, especially advanced ones can\'t be done in government hospitals due to cost constrains. Also the patient doesn\'t come to a government hospital demanding robotic surgery and swiss made implants. So it goes both ways. That effects my craft since I will never be able to practise a part of my own profession only because of the place.\n\nIt is also very difficult to land a permanent job in government sector. It is highly contested and you are bound to be disappointed if this was your only hope.\n\nPoliticians are a big menace. They are supposed to maintain the upkeep of the hospital since they are the ones allotting the funds and making sure the utilisation is done well. But we all know how this story goes. Also they will come with random recommendations saying this patients need to be given priority etc making someone else feel bad that they are being displaced on a politicians whims. Worst part is they will eat off the funds allotted to the hospital and then themselves come saying so many facilities like ventilators are not there. Yeah of course they are not there, you converted the hospital ventilators to the Mercedes in your garage. Luckily the hospital I was working in didn\'t have much political interference. Miracle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CONS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Lethargic and lazy staff (not all but enough are)**\n* **Safety issue (violence and injuries can happen at workplace)**\n* **Politician interference (goons and random threats to fool patients)**\n* **Quantity over quality (not bad quality but not at corporate level so mentioning)**\n* **Cleanliness and hygiene issues**\n* **Long queues for patients**\n* **Delayed salaries (some hospitals)**\n* **Understaffing issues**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI personally did not face all these issues like quality and cleanliness were maintained in my government run hospital, food served to patients was good and clean, salaries were not delayed much and staff was adequate. But every other hospital I saw had one or more of these issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOpen to any questions and doubts regarding the work experience or other issues regarding this topic\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for staying up this far. Have a wonderful day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    More parts coming up:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Next week :* Medical Diaries: My experience working in a Private (Corporate) hospital\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n/u/11docdoctor11'<br />Author: '11docdoctor11'  id: 'tymip9'<br />Score:55<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tymip9/medical_diaries_my_experience_working_in_a/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Building Hindu Startup in public - 1'<br />Body: "I work at one of the FAANG/ decacorn tech companies  (I.e. Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) as the engineering/product leader. I am trying to build a product/service to serve Hindus and other Indic religions. Fortunately, many colleagues/friends who are also aligned with the cause are also interested in co-building and investing in this startup. \n\nI am clear on the space but not clear on what problem we would address for an individual. Collectively, I understand that following are the problems to be addressed : \n\n1. Lack of platform and censorship on existing platforms to discuss Hindu issues\n2. Fear of coming out / security issues as Hindu (getting labeled as Bhakt)\n3. Lack of awareness about Hindu traditions, rituals, arts (music/dance/painting/martial art/ satvik food)\n4. Lack of spiritual education and historical context from the dharmic lens (causing illnesses such as wokism/ being hostile towards our own culture)\n5. Lack of community activities in urban areas (holi celebration etc.)\n6. No pilgrimage keeping youths in mind \n\nThe majority of the aforementioned points are collective problems, not individuals problems/needs - it is difficult to build a startup without addressing individuals. \n\nFor instance, we thought of building a social network for Hindus but such a platform will have little diversity of thought - most members will mostly be aligned with the key causes and there will be little to discuss when all are aligned. I still use Twitter over Koo because no one opposes my opinions on Koo and on Twitter, diversity allows me to learn new things. Even platforms addressing Islam/Christianity didn't grow much because of the same issue. To conclude, there is no point in building another WhatsApp group where people keep sharing articles. \n\nThis conclusion led me to think about building hyper-local communities of Hindus around temples - so that offline interactions can take place. \n\nGoing deeper into it - what purpose does going to the temple serve on a psychological level?  Will our generation ever go to temples or shall we build alternative mechanisms for people to serve the same psychological needs? \n\nPlease honestly reply, how many of you go to the temple and what is the visit frequency?

      <li>Title::: 'A Message to the Government of India from Indian Students Pursuing MBBS in Ukraine'<br />Body: "The present scenario of Ukraine students coming back from war torn country has made us think why students go abroad for studying medicine. Many controversies have also been raised against students going to countries like Ukraine to pursue their dreams of becoming a [doctor.It](https://doctor.It) has been said that the quality of education in Ukraine and other countries are not competent .It is also said that incompetent students go to study abroad .Also only 20%students clear FMGE .These are the allegations put forward by many against these students. Nobody is keen to learn what actually is the reason behind 60%-70%students going  to learn abroad.\n\nFirst and foremost is our system of selection nearly 15lakh students appear for NEET exam 6lakh students get qualified with 50 percentile marks for around 90000 seats of which a large part is reserved for students who scored 35 percentile and are eligible for merit seat and the remaining few seats are left for general students who inspite of scoring above 80 percentile score have to struggle to get admission for a merit sear. No where else in the world such system of admission exist. So the result is above average students go abroad losing their seats to below average students. Next about the quality of education .Students studying in MCI recognized universities abroad get good education also they do well in FMGE tests too. It is to be noted even students in India should be made to tests Like FMGE to analyze and compare the standard of education. I agree clinical practice exposure is more in India than other countries but according to recent reports even Indian students have not been given clinical practices and complete theoretical classes .Students have exempted themselves from writing exams but this doesn't happen abroad there syllabus is completed and exams are conducted on time. If we take the record we can see that a large number of students with high percentage marks in their 12 board exams and comparatively with good score in NEET exam go abroad because their parents cannot afford to pay fees in aided colleges. Also our Government should look in how many drop outs occur each year in reserved seats also how competent they are?\n\nWhy blame the  students for going abroad and studying instead why don't our system support them with opportunities to stay back in our country and help in the growth and well being of our nation.\n\nWhile bringing this plight to light I plead the Government Of India to show their concern to thousands of students who are looking upon for a positive decision."<br />Author: 'star-dust-studios'  id: 'txolf2'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/txolf2/a_message_to_the_government_of_india_from_indian/</li>

Abdul Kalam Sir's inspiration for Agni 1, 2 and 3 missiles, linked with Bhagvad Gita and legendary warrior Barbarik."<br />Body: "I was reading Wings of fire, biography about the missile man of India Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam and found out how he got the idea for Agni 1 2 and 3 ballistic missiles from Bhagvad gita, yes you read that right, the most useful and wonderful Hindu scripture which  many people think is only for old aged people.\n\nSo Barbarik had in his possession 3 special arrows which were extremely powerful and he can win any battle by the use of those 3 arrows only😬,, shocking right, but it's true.\n\nThose 3 arrows became the inspiration for 3 guided ballistic missiles Agni missiles.\n\nNow Barbarik got these 3 arrows by worshipping a Goddess and doing lot of tapasya and sadhana but there was one condition that he can use these arrows only in order to help a weak person or weak group in battle.\n\nNow as he was grandson of Bheem, it was very obvious that he will enter battle of Mahabharat from Pandavas side.\n\nBut as soon as the battle would begin he would have used one of his arrow, that arrow would have wiped out half of the Kauravas army so they would have gotten weaker now and according to the promise Barbarik gave to the Goddess he will be inclined to fight alongside Kauravas now, he must support weaker army and in doing so it means changing side.\n\nNow if he joins Kauravas and fires another arrow from their side, Pandavas army would have been destroyed and then he will have to again change sides because he had to help weaker army.\n\nNow in doing all of this, releasing arrows and changing sides, ultimately in the end nobody except for him would have left in the battle field, Lord Krishna already knew about this and so he used his wit again and didn't allowed him to take part in the battle of Mahabharat, otherwise the battle would have been ended in seconds.\n\nWhen Barbarik was a teenager, Lord Krishna guided him that how can he start his training and suggested him a Guru, in doing so as Lord Krishna gave him the guidance, Barbarik considered Lord Krishna as his Guru and asked him what would he require in Guru Dakshina.\n\nBut at that time Krishna told that he will demand his Guru Dakshina in the future because he already knew about what future of Barbarik was.\n\nNow when the time came for Barbarik to enter the battlefield, Lord Krishna demanded his head in guru dakshina which Barbarik gladly gave him but there was a catch!!!\n\nEven after getting beheaded Barbarik would still remain alive and his head was placed at the top of the mountain from where he witnessed entire battle of Mahabharat.\n\nAfter battle was over, Lord Krishna reattached his head with his body and he came back to life again 😁\n\nBut after seeing so much death and destruction in battle of Mahabharat, he decided to gave up all of his powers and went into the woods to become a Sanyasi.\n\nHope you enjoyed it and learned something new today🤘\n\nCheers 🥂\nGoku."<br />Author: 'Goku___98'  id: 'txn3rc'<br />Score:64<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/txn3rc/dr_apj_abdul_kalam_sirs_inspiration_for_agni_1_2/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'The Dravidaryan Invasion Theory - A refutation of European and Marxist narratives'<br />Body: ' A link to the article in question. - [https://www.brownpundits.com/2022/02/10/16590/](https://www.brownpundits.com/2022/02/10/16590/)\n\nSome Interesting quotes from the article.\n\n“Returning to the model of steppe migration, it seems that this was  concurrent with both a Dravidian migration into peninsular India as well  as a thrust of AASI enriched Indians towards the northwest. This great  Indian churn reminiscent of the Samudra Manthan motif or “churning of  the cosmic ocean” in the Hindu Puranas is what produced the precursors  of Indian culture and society today. The modern Indian was being  assembled in this churn. Even more ingredients were added to the mixture  through the east through Munda migrations from Southeast Asia. These  migrants would particularly populate the DNA of India’s tribals or  “adivasis;” a misnomer meaning “first inhabitants” that has been  hijacked by political interests to misclassify these tribals as the  original people of the Indian As these Dravidians reached Tamil Nadu, they too brought with them Vedic  culture. This is something that will cause heartburn to the fanciful  separatists of Tamil Nationalist bent, but the earliest Tamil literature  of the Sangam Era extols the Vedas and Vedic gods such as Vishnu,  Shiva, Durga, and Indra. Even the much vilified Tamil Brahmins find  praise in the earliest of Tamil texts. There was no separate secular  notion in the Tamil nation. This was an Aryan land.”\n\n“But it is in the tales of the Dark Lord that we see a glimpse of  which gods would rule the Indian mind. While popular narratives would  tell you that a skin color apartheid was enforced by the steppe folk,  what’s curious is that dark skin gods would become their supreme  deities. They would even beg the gods for dark skin children. The  Brihadarayanka Upanishad devotes verses (6.4.16) denoting the high  merits and methods needed to conceive dark skinned children; merits and  methods that were greater than those needed for lighter shades. Vishnu,  whose avatars and epithets possess names frequently alluding to his dark  skin color, would rise as a zenith of the Hindu pantheon over the ages.  A possible peek into the rise of Vishnu’s prominence lies in the tale  of Govardhan.”\n\n“One of the more disturbing parts about the effect of such simplistic  takes on ancient Indian migrations is a niche form of genetic supremacy  that is developing. While some embellish the stature of their steppe  DNA, others claim themselves as the true aboriginal of the land due to  their large proportion of AASI lineage. They go so far as even asking  for reparations based on this poppycock of logic. While there is some  correlation between mixes of steppe, IVC, and AASI lineages around  caste, it is an imperfect and a diverse amount that is in the end, a  mixture. All Indians are an amalgamation of these people to various  degrees. There is almost no pure steppe, IVC, or AASI person in the  subcontinent (the Andaman Nicobar people may be sole exception on the  AASI front). The movement towards heightened caste consciousness  combined with the advocation of an almost racial element to caste could  be potentially disastrous for India.”'<br />Author: 'Status-Tourist1363'  id: 'txkyjh'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/txkyjh/the_dravidaryan_invasion_theory_a_refutation_of/</li>

Extreme poverty in India was as low as 1% in 2019. This is a substantial reduction in poverty rates from 2011 levels.\n2. Low inflation, more equitable growth and improvement in public distribution thanks to Aadhar helped reduce poverty.\n3. Extreme  poverty in India was below 1% even in 2020 - the pandemic year. The  doubling of entitlements under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann  Yojana prevented any substantial increase in extreme poverty in 2020.\n4. Inequality  in India has been on a decline since 2017 (IHDS survey reported the  first decline in 2017) - it is at the lowest level seen since 1993/94.\n5. All of this indicates a very inclusive growth in India over the last decade.\n6. Given  that extreme poverty has been eradicated in India, India should move  from the PPP1.9$ poverty line to the 3.2$ PPP line. Eradication of  extreme poverty is a big achievement especially as we celebrate 75 years  of independence later this year.\n\nReport\n\n[https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/04/05/Pandemic-Poverty-and-Inequality-Evidence-from-India-516155](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/04/05/Pandemic-Poverty-and-Inequality-Evidence-from-India-516155)'<br />Author: 'fap_fap_fap_fapper'  id: 'txknfc'<br />Score:191<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/txknfc/imf_report_says_extreme_poverty_in_india_as_low/</li>

Or an ideology that hates neither, but sees india as a fundamentally sanatani country. \n\nHow does this ideology view caste? Do people of SC and ST in general support this ideology or are they against it like what the libs claim? Do Dalits support it?\n\nIs it an ideology that is welcoming of all, like the Jews and zoroastrians in the past, or is it something that wishes to be unwelcoming to others?\n\nUnrelated question, but why can't the woken simply admit how harshly not only we hindus have been treated, but the buddhists, sikhs, jains and zoroastrians of this land (who we welcomed but were unfortunately most likely persecuted again by mughal empire)?\n\nIs it an ideology against all other religions like the libs claim? Or is it only against Christianity (that too only evangelism, all other groups who don't consider us devil worshippers bound for hell are fine), Islam (which has a terrible history here but some reformers may try to change, which most other Islamic groups don't accept) and atheism (that too only the antitheists who seek to destroy religion, not the atheists that have no problem and even take part in customs, like those in China that destroyed the tibetans, so we welcomed them here)?\n\nDo you think groups like the tibetans, zoroastrians etc or even indigenous groups like the jains and sarna stal people of jharkhand are better off under hindutva where they are not victims of predatory behaviour by proselytising religions, or will every non hindu group be relentlessly persecuted under it?\n\nI personally believe hindutva is exactly like zionism, which would actually give further points to the wokes to criticise it, but I think it explains very well.

      <li>Title::: 'Why India needs a Social Media infrastructure, possibly with govt backing'<br />Body: "This is in response to the post : [India needs own social media platform](https://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/txc94f/india_needs_own_social_media_platform/). I am just posting few notes I've compiled over a period of time on the same idea\n\nThis is a plan which will lay foundation for next generation of social networks that are decentralized and various services from various parties can be offered. This is decentralized so that there is no one party like YouTube or Twitter that can dominate the entire social media space.\n\nThe fundamental ideas are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs. The basic idea is to find real life analogues of social media and then figure out how social media can be designed for the entire country.  The motivation for this effort stems from the idea of terms and conditions that are offered to its subscribers on the platform. \n\n1. These terms are more often than not are verbose with lengthy paragraphs and with legal language which is hard for a single user to read, understand and agree. \n2. Also there is no provision for partial acceptance of the agreement i.e. there may be terms that user can disagree and that he agrees with. There is no way for the user to access the platform with degraded experience that is in tune with the subset of terms that he agreed to. \n3. User agreement must be the constitution of the country the user is citizen of. A private company cannot offer a service that restrictive of the constitutional rights the citizen is eligible to. Most of the social media networks don't adhere to this maxim. They offer their own set of terms.\n4. Current social media companies are dictating the social contract that is not in conformance with the governing rules of the country. By doing so they are by passing the social, political, legal and constitutional frameworks the citizens enjoy as part of the citizenship of the country they belong to. Social media companies have hijacked the social contract and now will be able to do political interference with impunity under the guise of their own terms and conditions.\n5. Its important to note that Social Media companies don't own the citizens of the country. Right now they are behaving as if they do.\n\nNow let us understand what is a social network. Consider two examples of a large Mall and a social gathering on an occasion say New year celebrations.\n\nA mall can have its own rules, security profile etc. But it isn't above the rules of constitution of India. There can be many malls and each mall can be considered to be a social network. \n\nIf there is a violation of any of the rules of the the mall, then it can at most deny the entry. But if the violation is like theft or crime, it must register a complaint with the police. The mall doesn't have much power of what kind of action will be taken against the citizen. And the mall is required to maintain a register of violations.\n\nThis is because the mall don't own their visitors or in social media parlance, their users. Users form a sovereign nation and they choose to participate in a Mall (or service) because they know the mall that is running is also governed by the same laws citizens are governed by. That mall is able to operate within a jurisdiction implies that the mall is bound by the same law that applies to citizens. If this is the case, reddit must not be accessible within India because they don't have an office in India and they don't cater to Indian audience.\n\nTwo people who can talk to each other like in real life should be able to do so without the Mall getting involved\n\nJust like a mall is within a state's jurisdiction and avails the benefits of policies of a particular state, it implies that it is obligated to implement the rules of the state they have taken advantage of. A Mall's users are not a free gift to the mall but a result of the policies of the incumbent government.\n\nNow this situation isn't specific to India. Lot of countries, political parties are worried sick about the social media bias and how they have become transnational organizations acting in their own interest. For example, UK, lots of countries in Europe will be interested in such solutions. And why, even US, the entire republican party folks who form at least 50% of the American electorate will come on to streets to back such a system.\n\nNow it's time to transform these ideas into something that can parallel social media.\n\nPlease join the conversation on www.bakchodi.org, here on this [thread](https://bakchodi.org/post/1318)"<br />Author: 'blackrock-orange'  id: 'txgjpc'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/txgjpc/why_india_needs_a_social_media_infrastructure/</li>

If pro Taliban, teen pronography, incest, murder and violence is not deplatformed in the name of NSFW then, the only reason that can justify deplatforming is just vulgar misuse against a place on internet where a different set of ideas were discussed. \n\nNow that r/Place is off, each day the canvas missed the power of the r/¢h0d!. We could have done bigger and in a more assertive way with our community that was deplatformed. But, still we did good. Until next time.

      <li>Title::: 'Dravida Nadu, And The Future Of My Country'<br />Body: 'India is unfortunately alone in our end of the world. China has managed to take all our allies, and now even our own countrymen are fighting against us. With the resurgence of Nationalism around the world, and even in India, it seems like a good time to talk about the Dravidian identity of South Indians.\n\n[We are the Dravidians.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravidian_peoples) We inhabited this land since the Indus Valley Civilization, long before the Aryan invasion. We lived there for thousands of years. [When the Aryans came, they brought with them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryan_migrations) the Caste System, and slavery of our people who they thought were inferior to their superior Iranian blood. Hindi should not be our National language. These light-skin Sanskrit/Urdu/Hindi people should not be leading a country with 300 Millions Dravidians. The Aryans assimilated their "Brahmin" Priest caste into our pre-existing protoreligions to create Hinduism, aka "The worlds oldest religion". I respect the Bhakti movement for all the changes that have been implemented, and the quality of life that it has brought to my countrymen over the past 400 years, and thus will not disavow Hinduism as a whole, but it is true that the dark-skinned dravidians are seen as a lower-caste by these Aryans. The self-hatred is evident throughout the world. India has 18 Million slaves, and these slaves are usually Dravidian, dalit , dark skinned , lower caste men and women who are descended from the population of us who were not able to escape to the south before the Aryans came and occupied the cities we abandoned in search of food during the recurrent northern droughts.\n\nThe past 80 years of relative peace have passed. With talk of a new Caliphate, a new Ottoman Empire, Europe rearming, the US pulling further out of the Middle East, and China and Russia resorting to desperate measures, it seems that a war is more likely than not, to happen. In case of a war against a Chinese coalition, we will be invaded from all 3 sides. Estimates say that Delhi will fall within weeks. There is doubt that India has a strong enough national identity to stand after the capital falls, and will thus fall into being a puppet state(again). We must establish the Dravidian Identity south of the Godavari before it is too late. The infighting needs to stop.\n\n[Dravida Nadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravida_Nadu) was an idea by our leaders post-WW2 to establish a country to the south, but the rest of the alliance rightly feared that the Tamilians would hold too much power within the alliance. But time for such trivialities has passed. Our people are being murdered every day, and that they don\'t even know why is a tragedy. Let every Dravidian know, that they kill us and enslave us because of the color of our skin. We must surpass religion. Build a naval power that can reach as far south as Australia, and as far west as Somalia. We can\'t depend on the American Navy to protect us from Somalian pirates anymore. We will do it ourselves. We can revamp trade with Indonesia(Fourth Largest Country in the world)/Ethiopia, and actually become a superpower by 2050. No more false promises and empty timelines.  With a Dravidian Identity strongly cemented in place, we will be able to be stronger allies with Sri Lanka as well.\n\nAre there any good arguments against this? Do you think Modi would allow us to secede? They allowed the Telangana debacle, so they might be on our side for this.'<br />Author: 'AlternateAccount1602'  id: 'tx8txq'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tx8txq/dravida_nadu_and_the_future_of_my_country/</li>

      <li>Title::: "An inner 'tea' on how Journalism in India is working currently, and why Jamia and JNU are the biggest culprits."<br />Body: "TL;DR: A funny story on what I've learnt in an year on how journalism really works and what kind of bullshit is spewed inside circles in the name of 'journalism'. And how most of these are internal circles of Jamia and JNU and outsiders literally have no control over it.\n\nWhy do you see so much appeasement in the news for Ms and so much hatred against Hs? It's mostly the philosophy being discussed in these circles. I'll give a story on how I dated someone from 'The Wire' (Wait for the breakup story, that's the funniest) and expose how these inner circles work.\n\nFirstly, we all know the narratives flying in Jamia and JNU. They consider Rana Ayyub and Barkha the goddesses of free speech in their whatsapp groups and otherwise, and consider Brahmins the coming of evil.I dated this journo woman for an year who was a Rajput landowner who turned into a pink haired woman so filled with self hatred she would only say bad things about her community and cry 'patriarchy' every turn she got. (Yes, her dad payed for her beautiful home in Delhi, and her uncles supported her and gave her a car but patriarchy). That's the case with most of her friends too. Indian men are rapists but sleeping around with mid aged white men is okay even if we do it everyday because of fucking patriarchy. Such logics are predominant in their inner toxic whatsapp groups where all they discuss is how they can paint muslims as victims. They eat confirmation bias for breakfast and have a huge dinner of all the sources they could collect during the day to fill in the quota for daily victim articles. And the scariest part is they legit believe this shit. M women are on the top of their ladder btw (Someone I won't name who's a prominent name was her best friend) and despite following their religion to the T they'll fill the young minds with poison about how Brahmin patriarchy has somehow ruined their lives and they should go around 'partying' to defy their parents.\n\nThe biggest example is us having an argument when the Afghanistan takeover happened. Her group legit had messages of people saying 'Woh din door nahi jab RSS bhi golia leke aajaega aise hi', and again they legit believed this. The worst part was the Jamia folk deviated the topic completely from Taliban to RSS, and despite one of their journalists dying in the ordeal the whole discussion shifted to how BJP MIGHT do it (CAA highlights). I had pretty Indic wing beliefs so I didn't bother to say much but the logics that would come out of her mouths were laughable at best. Everytime some news of a riot or H victim would come they'll be like 'Kapil Mishra ko to inhone jail me daala nahi to kyu likhe inke baare me'. The narrative is so widespread that you'll be cancelled immediately for being an 'islamophobic bigot' and my friend does tell me about stories of people trying to file headlines in that manner and getting fired hearing bizzare reasoning for their firing. The 'establishment' is anti-hindu to the core and sadly it's because our community is dominant mostly in the STEM and such branches. Everyone who's done a course of BJMC and equivalent will tell you the same shit, the journos having the most contacts up the ladder are predominantly the appeasers and this isn't changing anytime soon.\n\nOnto the breakup story: She was the typical 'No BJP guys' on tinder so I never revealed my political side to her. The day I gave her the tiniest hint that I might have that inclination (I guess a discussion of post partition atrocities), a mutual friend told me the discussion she had with her prominent M friend. 'Pakka s@ngh! hai, please dur rehe isse. Mai milwati hu kisi se'. Next day I get a call from her, so she met someone from the wire and after the drinks he comes to her house and assaulted her (lit. forced himself upon her) and when I tell her to fire a complaint she says the guy is too higher up and her prominent M friend (who suggested her to meet the guy) told her to stay quiet about the whole thing since this can blow up. I broke up with her because a self proclaimed feminist who hated JK Rowling for menial stuff is being a hypocrite on this. Now if the story is true every single one of the journos is a piece of shit and if it's false, the same applies because using the false story of an assault is just major stupidity.\n\nI blocked her from everywhere later but somehow the arguments stuck in my mind and I realised how deep knit the whole thing is. I honestly want to do something about the whole 'patriarchy' narrative because it's seriously doing a lot of harm to our men."<br />Author: 'justice4ssr'  id: 'twqwbh'<br />Score:61<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/twqwbh/an_inner_tea_on_how_journalism_in_india_is/</li>

Indian Govt - The biggest land holder in India is the Indian govt that hold around 13,505.44 sq kms of land. This land is distributed among different ministries. The ministries like Railways, Defense, Archeology, Monuments and Temples etc.\n\n[**How much land does the Indian govt own? About 9 times the size of Delhi**According to data collected so far, the government owns 13,505.44 sq kms, of which the railways ministry owns the biggest chunk.https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-much-land-does-indian-govt-own-officials-building-inventory-railways-biggest-landowner/story-NTUmFHp2xFXoB2lZRbv5TP\\_amp.html](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-much-land-does-indian-govt-own-officials-building-inventory-railways-biggest-landowner/story-NTUmFHp2xFXoB2lZRbv5TP_amp.html)\n\n2. Indian Catholic Church - As per an estimate, the Catholic Church is the “largest non-agricultural land owner” in India and the worth of its holdings may run into several lakh crores of rupees. The Indian Church acts like a state within a state in the Indian Union yet gives its allegiance to the Jesuit Pope in Rome.\n\n[**How religious minorities are enjoying fruits of secularism in India - The Sunday Guardian Live**Sometime ago, the official Chinese media had praised India’s secular fabric saying Hinduism has prevented the spread of radical Islam in this country. In an article, Global Times raised a very pertinent question: “Why does it seem that Muslims in India have remained largely away from the radicalisation that hashttps://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/religious-minorities-enjoying-fruits-secularism-india#:\\~:text=As%20per%20an%20estimate%2C%20the,several%20lakh%20crores%20of%20rupees.](https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/religious-minorities-enjoying-fruits-secularism-india#%3A~%3Atext%3DAs%20per%20an%20estimate%2C%20the%2Cseveral%20lakh%20crores%20of%20rupees.)\n\n3. Waqf Board of India - The Waqf Board had 4 lakh acres of land in 2009 which has seen an increase to 8 lakh acres in 2020 as stated by Hari Shankar Jain infront of Supreme court. It acts as a charitable organization for one community and is also connected to the govt ministry of minorities affairs along with an Act of 1995 which allows religious board to declare any piece of land as waqf property without necessary proofs or documents or any prior information to the owner. This makes it a very powerful organisation, though the property of Waqf board can also be privately owned. Some land holdings even date back to Mughal times.\n\n[**6.1 lakh Waqf properties across India, most in UP, West Bengal, Karnataka | India News - Times of India**India News: BENGALURU: As the Supreme court hears a PIL alleging non-enumeration of waqf properties across the country, data accessed by TOI shows that there are .https://m.timesofindia.com/india/6-1-lakh-waqf-properties-across-india-most-in-up-west-bengal-karnataka/amp\\_articleshow/74021460.cms](https://m.timesofindia.com/india/6-1-lakh-waqf-properties-across-india-most-in-up-west-bengal-karnataka/amp_articleshow/74021460.cms)\n\nThere was a time when temples used to own villages after villages which is very much a case for big temples like Jaganatha, Tirupati, Somnath, Kedarnath etc today as well but after muslim invasions less temples are left and all that land has been encroached by other people. British also helped in reducing the number of land owned by temple by making temples a govt subject which stripped the priest and local community of any say and most of the temples funds are now a govt property. But the same doesnt happen to other places of worship as you can see two out of three highest land holders in India are religious groups. Many kings also owned land but after they signed Treaty of succession with Republic of India they were also stripped of any power and property.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOriginal Link - [https://www.quora.com/Who-owns-the-highest-land-in-India](https://www.quora.com/Who-owns-the-highest-land-in-India)'<br />Author: 'HakaishikDpk'  id: 'twmf34'<br />Score:294<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/twmf34/came_across_this_on_quora_who_owns_the_highest/</li>

I have been following this sub for a while and I found out that non-hindus often create problems in your land. However, hindu's also do, but this sub doesn't talk about it. So, I assume it's biased to hindus. \n\nHowever, this is not my main message. My message is that India does get unnecessary hate from others. Firstly, there are some illiterate sh*ts from Muslim community that hates India for no reason. I know that, cause I am from their community as well. But trust me, these people are toxic in real life as well. These toxic people not just hate India, but anyone that they don't agree, this is what make them toxic in real life. Then, there are white skinned idiots. They are same as well.  You may see that they are hating India in particular, but no their mindsets are full of hatered, that's why they spread hate. Well, India does have cringe(like the way some hindus do things related to cow), but you receive way more troll/hate than what one should get for these stuffs, which isn't justified. I don't like to see these discrimination or hypocrisy towards people and I am always against these discrimination. Also, India and Bangladesh does have similar history too and I see those who hate India, most of them also hate Bangladeshi culture too, which really makes me angry. So, I am against any unnecessary/unreasonable hate, towards India, Bangladesh, European countries or any countries.

A pro-US govt in Islamabad could then be used by the US as a means of applying pressure on India, as per Washington's traditional playbook. Also, during the 1980s the United States famously used Pakistan for a jihad campaign against the Soviet Red Army in Afghanistan.

      <li>Title::: 'The world seems to have forgotten the importance of consent and boundaries.'<br />Body: "The world seems to have forgotten the importance of consent and boundaries and it is essential that we uphold the integrity of this not only for ourselves but as role models for others. No one has any right to touch your body unless your consent is given. If this rule was practised it would save so many of us so much trauma. People who embody their boundaries make the world a much safer place for all of us! \n\nThere are healthy boundaries and unhealthy boundaries. Healthy boundaries are boundaries that come from the inside out - they’re innate, they’re born from our essence and they empower us. Unhealthy boundaries come from the outside in - through traumas and undesirable experiences that have led us to put up rigid walls, or even hold a seemingly lack of boundaries. \n\nFor many of us, it’s common to feel uncomfortable saying the word NO. We’re afraid of disappointing someone, we’re afraid of rejection, abandonment, we fear confrontation or guilt. \n\nFor sex and any touch exchange, consent is paramount. It doesn't matter if you’re with your partner who you love and trust, consent is essential when touching another being and consent can change. One day, you may love your feet being touched, for example, and another day, you may not want them to be touched, this is okay and this is why healthy communication is so important with massage. Consent is also incredibly empowering for the receiver as well, to authentically say YES or NO for what is true for them at that time. Consent is a right that is robbed from many of us in life so to be able to stand in that right, is not only empowering, it’s healing. \n\nWith boundaries, there are 3 options. YES, NO or Still Deciding. Maybe it is not a decision so until it’s a clear YES, take it as a NO. \n\nBefore we do anything, we need to know what our boundaries are. What are we comfortable with, what do we welcome? What are we not comfortable with? What is not welcome? What do we desire? What do we need to be able to feel safe, held and supported so that we can fully embrace it? \n\nI would love to hear more examples below of healthy boundaries vs. unhealthy boundaries..

      <li>Title::: 'The civil services and how the British designed it to be corrupt, to loot and cripple India, and exploit Indians, and how this legacy continues to this day'<br />Body: '  \n\nSelected Indians groomed to subjugate fellow Indians for foreign rulers has been the foundation for civil services in India. Even the Mughals had a rudimentary form of this system in place with the objective of “assimilation”. Brown nosed Indians who would implement draconian laws that exploited the masses and eventually oppressed them to the extent that civil services was seen as a coveted position. This attitude still exists to this day where people aspire to get into the civil services for a chance at personal glory rather than an opportunity to serve. Even the most idealistic civil servants will rarely get a chance to serve the public, often getting transferred dozens of times in his/her career, preventing them to serve the people properly. \n\nThis is because the system itself was designed by the British to exploit the people and the land of India, not to serve. \n\nWorse yet, **the system was originally thought of as a “civilizing exercise”, which basically meant that India was a land of uncivilized savages and needed the British to civilize us**. Little did Indians foresee how it was meant to destroy India and not civilize it.\n\nWe start with the ubiquitous problem of corruption.\n\n# How the British civil services established a foundation for widespread bribery and corruption in Indian bureaucracy –\n\nThe civil services have always been a corrupt system. The British encouraged corruption at all levels, especially bribery. The higher posts in the civil services were exclusively held by the British. The lower levels of stooges in the administrative system would get paid poorly as compared to the British officers. But because these stooges were critical to the smooth functioning of the British Raj, they were openly encouraged to accept bribes from the poorer fellow Indian, to keep their loyalty intact.\n\nThis culture started when the British crown took charge of running Indian government from East India Company. Essentially, letting Indian officers accept bribes became a morale-building exercise to keep them happy and subservient to the British overlords. \n\nAnd the Indian officers happily accepted the system. They would openly charge a commission to get things done. **This was so widespread that when these officers would get marriage offers, they would be straight up asked “how much unofficial income you earn?”, by the bride’s family.** This culture exists to this day where IAS officers are in high demand in matrimonial pages.\n\nThis culture of bribery was so prevalent that there was an unofficial motto of “making hay while the British sun shines.”\n\n# \n\n# The objective of establishing of the civil services itself was to exercise absolute power over Indian population and keep them subjugated –\n\nIndian citizens who showed exceptional talent in bootlicking were awarded comfortable spots in the civil services which then encouraged them to loot from the poorest of the poor.\n\nEven the Indian police system, which is supposed to be ideally for protecting the Indians, was actually established to quell any dissent against the British Raj. The police officers were given a wide set of powers so that they could oppress freely their Indian subjects as per the orders from the British crown. \n\n**Regular civilians who sheltered the British officers during mutinies and revolts were given cushy jobs as civil servants and zamindars, who then took to exploiting Indian farmers.**\n\nIf the people revolted because of low pay and exploitation, the police services would be called upon to beat up the revolting Indians on behalf of the British.\n\nThis policy of doing the colonizer’s bidding resulted in grave abuses in the form of Jallianwala Bagh massacre and Simon Go Back protests where Tilak was fatally injured.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The lack of accountability in any shape or form during the British rule gave them overreaching powers and an immunity from any law that would essentially punish them for corrupt practices –\n\nIt was not as if anti-corruption law was not present during the British rule. They did have punitive punishments in place for corruption, but it was never ever enforced. Even high-ranking British governors, themselves indulged in open corruption while ruling India. **Even respected officers like Lord Clive or Warren Hastings were tried by the British government for corrupt practices although not really facing any significant punishment.** They are still remembered as benevolent figures in Indian history textbooks today.\n\nIf the governors were exempt from accountability, the lower rungs of administration were even more insulated from it. Even after the first world war, when the civil services were stretched thin by the challenges of food shortage, depleted treasury and famines, the British crown in England described it as “a steel frame” on which the culture of British rule stays secure in India. This is despite all the corruption and atrocities the civil services were complicit in.\n\nNot one of them were ever prosecuted for any of the corrupt practices they indulged in. The worst punishment they usually faced if public outcry became too loud, was to be shipped to England, where they could retire to the English countryside and draw a comfortable pension.\n\n**Speaking of pensions, retired English officers’ pensions cost Indian government around 4.36 million Pounds every year.** This was all paid by the Indians of course in addition to hundreds of million pounds that the British looted every year from India.\n\nThis culture of no accountability exists to even this day. Where erring civil servants are almost immune to prosecution and even the most corrupt ate just sent on administrative leave without facing jail time. It should be noted that they draw their full salary during suspension.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to my municipal office to get a new water connection a few years ago, and even though all my paperwork was in order, the file was not passed through the system and connection approved. Instead, I was made to wait for a month before I took it to my ward councillor. Even as an elected representative, he had to convince the bureaucrats sitting in the office to pass my file and even then they delayed. It was at that juncture that I took the complaint to the top bureaucrat who was head of the municipality, who comes from the state civil services. He plainly put across that I would need to pay 10,000 rupees because I was a local, otherwise the bribe is around 25,000 to 50,000 for an “outsider”. \n\nThis further prompted me to approach the elected president of the municipality. That man had to beg the civil servant to approve the connection otherwise I would lodge a complaint higher up. \n\nImagine a world where an elected official has to beg an appointed official to approve files. In the end I still had to pay 1000 rupees as token to get the connection approved.\n\nBureaucracy as we know it is a remnant of the absolutely corrupt British rule and should be dismantled completely if we are to bring any kind of reform in governance.\n\nJust like the Indian populace made peace with corruption in British civil services, today most citizens have let this corrupt culture fester in the Indian society, to the extent of even worshiping it. Civil services are still the most sought-after job because of the attractions of an easy life, far-reaching powers and a chance to make crores through corruption. \n\nEven well-meaning and good intentioned aspirants become corrupt as they enter the services. \n\nExploitation is still rampant, and the Indian mind still seems to be colonized.\n\nWorse yet, there are still people in India who will defend British rule as a benevolent one, which gave us the civil services, which in turn still acts as a steel frame that holds India together.\n\nThis could not be farther than the truth as the civil services was established to accelerate exploitation of Indians and loot India efficiently. Even today, it seems to be doing the same and is resisting any changes and calls for reforms.\n\nIt’s only after 70 years a sitting Prime Minister has openly called out the inefficiency of the Indian civil services and shown intention of transforming it for the good of the people.\n\nIt remains to be seen if this de-colonization indeed takes place or do we let this draconian and exploitative system continue.\n\nThat’s it,\n\nNamaste.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources – \n\nThe history of corruption in Indian police services during British India –\n\n[https://baylor-ir.tdl.org/bitstream/handle/2104/9728/Police%20Corruption%20in%20India.pdf?sequence=1](https://baylor-ir.tdl.org/bitstream/handle/2104/9728/Police%20Corruption%20in%20India.pdf?sequence=1)\n\nHow colonial police services officers worked with local zamindars to exploit the common man –\n\n[https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:OuKROlDdSFIJ:https://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/police-corruption-past-and-present/story-s1xMchqzMhq6TYuHMh835N.html+&amp;cd=18&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=in&amp;client=firefox-b-d](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:OuKROlDdSFIJ:https://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/police-corruption-past-and-present/story-s1xMchqzMhq6TYuHMh835N.html+&amp;cd=18&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=in&amp;client=firefox-b-d)\n\nAn excellent article which explains how the British crown rewarded corrupt civil services officers –\n\n[https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/how-our-british-rulers-legalised-bribery/article2442485.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/how-our-british-rulers-legalised-bribery/article2442485.ece)\n\nDadabhai Nowroji blamed the British civil services for the poverty in India –\n\n[https://theprint.in/pageturner/excerpt/dadabhai-naoroji-believed-the-indian-civil-service-was-the-reason-for-indias-poverty/433850/](https://theprint.in/pageturner/excerpt/dadabhai-naoroji-believed-the-indian-civil-service-was-the-reason-for-indias-poverty/433850/)\n\nHow the civil servant babus were rankled after being called out by the PM for reforms –\n\n[https://theprint.in/india/governance/babu-samjho-ishare-modis-critique-of-ias-evokes-shock-but-many-also-call-for-introspection/603341/](https://theprint.in/india/governance/babu-samjho-ishare-modis-critique-of-ias-evokes-shock-but-many-also-call-for-introspection/603341/)\n\nHow Modi is bringing in the biggest changes in civil services in 70 years –\n\n[https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/politics/under-modi-govt-indian-bureaucracy-is-facing-biggest-shakeup-in-seven-decades-6703321.html](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/politics/under-modi-govt-indian-bureaucracy-is-facing-biggest-shakeup-in-seven-decades-6703321.html)\n\nHow Modi is bringing a culture of change at least within the body of civil servants working under him –\n\n[https://theprint.in/india/governance/how-pm-modi-pulled-up-ias-officers-3-times-in-3-weeks-for-slow-pace-of-work-lacking-courage/616464/](https://theprint.in/india/governance/how-pm-modi-pulled-up-ias-officers-3-times-in-3-weeks-for-slow-pace-of-work-lacking-courage/616464/)\n\n[https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2022/jan/20/draconian-mamata-banerjee-to-pm-modi-on-proposed-changes-in-ias-cadre-rules-2409217.html](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2022/jan/20/draconian-mamata-banerjee-to-pm-modi-on-proposed-changes-in-ias-cadre-rules-2409217.html)\n\n[https://www.rediff.com/news/report/modis-message-to-new-ias-batch-take-reform-perform-transform-to-next-level/20220317.htm](https://www.rediff.com/news/report/modis-message-to-new-ias-batch-take-reform-perform-transform-to-next-level/20220317.htm)'<br />Author: 'Critavarma'  id: 'tv0m14'<br />Score:38<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tv0m14/the_civil_services_and_how_the_british_designed/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Petulant US Foreign Policy'<br />Body: ' \n\nA war that serves to pit brother against brother and weaken both.   \n\nA war instigated by vested interests, with fake promises of assistance.   \n\nThe Ukraine war is another example of caustic profiteering by US and  EU corporations at the cost of lives. NATO would not ever get in to a  fight against a peer level opponent. But that\'s what it implied to the  comic Zelensky.   \n\nA few hundred million worth of Javelins and stingers is chump change for a war that destabilizes the Rus.   \n\nSo who does it really serve??   \n\nLockheed, rheinmetall, BAE, SAAB, General dynamics, etc stock prices  have shot up. A huge boost to the western economies at the cost of Slav  blood. A shot in the arm for the economy after the free fall during the  pandemic years!   \n\nAnd then there is propaganda and lies peddled by the Western media  to suit a Western concocted narrative. Just like when propaganda hid the  shameless destabilizing of Libya for French oil companies and Iraq for  Halliburton.   \n\nBut for a narrative to ring true, you need other nations to peddle  it along with you. Not your usual nickel and dime European nations, but  peer level nations with significant zones of influence in other  continents.    \n\nIndia is that Unicorn. With a worthy reputation of quality low cost  pharma products especially to African nations, manufacturing and  distributing quality Covid Vaccines, largest contributor to UN Peace  keeping missions, stabilizing the Aden corridor from the Somalian  pirates, aiding Afghanistan to the extent even the Taliban were  impressed.   \n\nNow US and UK are desperately trying to get India to side with them.  But very very amateurishly! Duleep Singh, the shame of the Indian  American community, actually threatened a nation of 1.4 billion with  consequences. The same nation his ancestors came from!! Indian news  media is making fun of this approach! And Indian Public opinion is  actually shifting AWAY from the US narrative and perspective!   \n\nAnd on the more comical side....   \n\nImran Khan, the "magician" marrying demagogue of Pakistan, went to  Russia and praised the Russian invasion on the day it happened; LOL...  He thought the Chinese had his back! He is right now being toppled at  the instructions of the US to the powerful Pakistani army.   \n\nImran Khan deserves it, and Pakistan is not a country with a  army.... but more of an Army with a country. Pakistani army owns  factories, shopping malls, Cinemas, movie theaters, and even pizza  parlor chains in UK. It is a joke. But the Pakistani army knows, it  cannot fight with Chinese made garbage. And to this day, it\'s elite core  officer cadre is trained at West Point. Pakistani army and US share  very deep ties. Much deeper than with China and India (respectively).   \n\nBut the implications are serious. Inept, stupid, what ever he maybe,  Imran Khan was still the democratically elected leader of an American  allied nation. To kick him out does not suit the American image  projected of truth, freedom and democratic principles. Au contraire it  exposes the petulant and heavy handed approach of American strategists.   \n\nIndians are taking note of this as well.   \n\nIn stark contrast to Duleep Singh....Sergei Lavrov approached with  humility and something of tangible interest to India and it\'s people,  and was actually granted audience to the all powerful Indian prime  minister. Some thing NO other diplomat from EU or US or China has been  accorded in the past several weeks when a flurry of nations have been  desperately trying to swing India to their side.   \n\nAnd when Sergei Lavrov is offering $35 discount per barrel of oil,  that too on PRE-WAR PRICES to India, and when EU is still buying record  quantities of Russian oil and US is buying Russian Uranium; it is sheer  imbecility to expect India to not take the deal.   \n\nThe only hold up, is how the Indians will execute a Rupee-Rouble trade system, since the ruble exchange is at a state of flux.   \n\n(If India and Russia trade in Rupee-Ruble, then both countries will  need to open bank accounts in the other, and maintain billions of  dollars worth of currency deposits in those accounts for trade. And if  exchange rates are in free fall, it will hurt Indian buyers.)   \n\nBut with China doing a ruble-Yuan trade, Chinese Yuan - Saudi Riyal;  and India already having an Iranian Rial-Rupee trade system... A  rupee-ruble trade system will definitely happen.   \n\nConsequence will be a tremendous devaluation of the Petro Dollar.  And the Petro dollar is the one reason US always goes to war over.   \n\nSergei Lavrov approached the Indians with respect. With a message of  appreciation from Putin to Modi. And he made an offer that Indians  can\'t refuse... that the Rus would sell the Indians everything.   \n\nIndia WANTS Nuclear attack subs. S550. 6th Gen stealth fighters.  Indian money and software and Rus know-how was always a potent  combination.   \n\nAnd what does the US offer? Nothing tangible. The comment of Duleep  Singh about Rus not coming to the aid of India at the time of the  Chinese LAC attacks is fluff. Because neither did the US.   \n\nUS needs India more than India needs the US. Honestly, India can do  without McDonalds, Facebook, Uber, Tesla, etc. Nitin Gadkari will NOT  allow Tesla in to India. Period!   \n\nTo consider a truly strategic partnership and to actually GROW a  working relationship takes commitment and shared interests. NOT orders  and pontification.   \n\nIndia and US can collaborate on the Quad. In fact it could have  been great.. but then US ruined that too with AUKUS. "Hey fellow Anglo  nation, here are the Nuclear attack subs that you can\'t really afford,  operate effectively, or use decisively ... but hey, you are white and  you speak English ... albeit in a really funny way!"    \n\nThe US needs to realize it is dealing with a peer level power when  dealing with India. Power is never technology.... but BOOTS ON THE  GROUND!! And India fields an army larger than China (counting  paramilitary forces) with training and morale superior to most or on par  with any nation in the world. (Eg. ANY Alpine troops don\'t hold a  candle to Indian mountain troops.) India is NOT a teensy weensy European  nation beholden to the US. Or a shaky sham democracy like Pakistan  reliant on US and IMF loans to pay for energy for the next 2 weeks.   \n\nIf the Indians could secretly develop nukes in 1974, and develop  Nuclear Ballistic Missile subs (Arihant) and LCA Tejas Mark 2 and AMCA  after the 1998 post nuclear test US sanctions, then the Indians aren\'t  scared of anything including CATSA! Hell, even the North Koreans aren\'t  scared of sanctions, and they are always in famine.   \n\nWhat memory does India have of the US and it\'s allies?    \n\nOf Nixon calling Indian women ugly? Indira Gandhi a witch?  Supporting the genocide and rape by Yahya Khan against the Bangladeshis?  And when India was finally forced to intervene, sent the USS Enterprise  battle group to the Indian ocean (only to be thwarted by the Soviet  Akula class submarine battle group)?   \n\nWhat about US forcing a military Junta in Brazil and destroying any  chance of poverty alleviation in 1965 to 1984? Then vehemently opposing  Lula?    \n\nOf deposing Lumumba with that monster Mobutu Sese Sako?   \n\nOf forcing a colonial war against the Vietnamese?   \n\nIf the US want to truly ally with India:   \n\n1) Establish true democracy in the US with equal rights for people  of color and a fair judiciary that doesn\'t hand out life imprisonment to  minorities for stealing a backpack!   \n\n2) Stop raping and jailing pre-teen Mexican immigrant kids. Why take  it out on the kids when LA times and Gary Webb exposed the true perps.  behind the drug cartels?   \n\n3) Actually offer India some respect. Indians hate being lectured by perceived white superiority.    \n\n4) India wants a Permanent member position in the UN Security council.   \n\n5) India wants Nuclear attack subs more than anything, to compliment  it\'s Nuclear Ballistic Missile subs. And no thank you to the silly  Patriot systems. I wouldn\'t use that bucket of bolts to defend myself  against water balloons being thrown at me during Holi!! India will get  the S550. Don\'t even think of getting in the way!   \n\n6) Establish travel between US and India along the lines of US and  EU. Visa free. And respect for Indians at border check points.   \n\n7) Stop the whole "Anglo pals forever" fan club. AUKUS is  ridiculous! It is a joke, and as effective as my Californian ex-girl  friends\' chihuahuas at establishing safety and security.    \n\nLeadership is not about pontificating. It is about leading with courage and conviction.   \n\nThe US is failing at democracy. The US Capitol was attacked and  there were zero consequences for those that actually concerted that  attack.   \n\nGet your own house in order before pointing at others about what  they should do. And get a foreign policy based on strategic depth.

      <li>Title::: 'We have more in common to US and a lot more to gain than with Russia. Thoughts?'<br />Body: ' First. Just look at the money.\n\nWe  get annually around 75 billion USD from US for export of tangible  goods. 85 billion USD or so for services like IT/ Software, BPO etc.  Then we get another 11 billion dollars from US NRIs sending remittances  back to family here. That\'s **171 Billion Dollars**  right there!! Every fricking year... and going up... (please lookup and  confirm the numbers yourself. Don\'t take my word for it)... That\'s more  than double of our ENTIRE DEFENCE BUDGET!!!\n\nUS is also the country we have the largest positive trade balance with. (i.e more money **from** them and less money **to** them). US is literally just giving us money.\n\nThen  there\'s cultural flow. We are importing not just iPhones but also a lot  of American culture, some of you will say "it\'s not good" or whatever,  doesn\'t change the fact that it is happening. We are consuming American  media and striving for the way of that life. We listen to American  music, watch American movies, wear American Clothes, work American jobs  and eat American food.\n\nThen  there\'s the people, we may not be the largest diaspora in US but it is  sizeable, like 5 million or so. And... we are the richest people there.  The Average Indian American earns more than the Average American **Jew(!!)** or the Average White American, hence the huge remittances from US to India. Again, please don\'t just take my word for it.\n\nThen  there\'s the language, English. India is the second largest English  speaking country after US. We have very few native English speakers but a  big chunk of the population can manage English to some degree. English  is the "Lingua Franca" in many states in India like the Southern states  (where a lot of people can\'t or won\'t even speak Hindi), and in some  North Eastern states. Number of English speakers in India will only  continue to grow.\n\nSo tell me, what  do we even gain from Russia? Some weapons? We have already gradually  cut down on it in recent years. Fertilizers? Weapons and Fertilizers is  all I keep hearing about. Please some one.. tell me something else I can  add to this list.\n\nWe barely have  any trade with Russia. Nobody speaks Russian here. We barely have any  Indians in Russia. And all the Russians in India are doing or selling  drugs in Goa.\n\nAlso the argument  that they helped us in 1971 is flawed because it was not Russia that  helped us, it was the communist USSR, which is vastly different from  current Russia.\n\nWe still have some semblance of democracy left. Russia is completely authoritarian.\n\nI  am at a loss. I want to live in a Richer India. Siding with Russia  doesn\'t seem like the best way forward mathematically/financially or  morally.\n\nThoughts?'<br />Author: 'forgeror'  id: 'tuo2ig'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tuo2ig/we_have_more_in_common_to_us_and_a_lot_more_to/</li>

For almost last 1 year I have been working on and off with this one client (small startup) who has office in Spain. Last month, they offered me a remote contract job which is practically just a full time job but in a contract form.\n\nTheir parent company has a conference from 2nd July to 9th July for which I am supposed to visit London hence we planned that I might as well visit Spain in the meanwhile as a tourist and then visit London from there with the team, so here's what we are trying to plan:\n\n1. Bangalore To Valencia (Spain) - 7th May\n2. Valencia (Spain) To London - 2nd July\n3. London To Bangalore - 9th July\n\n---\n\n- I have a passport but I have never traveled internationally before and was wondering what's a good way to go about this.\n\n- I am self-employed (Freelance) and hence can produce last 2 year ITR as income proof. I would have around 2L in my bank account which I think should be plenty for international VISA requirements. I can pull in some 2L more if needed.\n\n- From what I understand, I should be able to qualify for Schengen Tourist Visa and for London I should be able to apply for a Conference VISA.\n\n- I can get a written invitation from folks in Spain and UK respectively for the tourist VISA and for UK Conference VISA.\n\n- I will be provided a place to stay in both places.\n\n---\n\nI know absolutely nothing about the processes and since the timelines are a bit tight, I'm starting to panic a bit. Anyone knows a simple way to get this process done? **Should I consult an agency or should I do the entire process all on my own?**\n\nI was hoping that the process would have been a simple online form thingy, but after some research, it's obviously more complicated than that.\n\nSome help or guidance on how to approach this would be greatly appreciated."<br />Author: 'SangeetDev'  id: 'tuinou'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tuinou/first_time_international_traveler_how_to_get_a/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'JEE aspirants need your help!'<br />Body: 'Hi,\n\nThis may not be one of the conventional posts that are made here but this is a very important topic which may make or break a JEE aspirants future.\n\nWe have been reaching out to the officials but there has been no response from them. They refused to accept a SC physical representation regarding our concerns\n\nLakhs of aspirants have been protesting against the dates of the first attempt of the JEE mains examinations. This is because of the following reasons:\n\n1. Last year, it was announced that jee mains would be conducted 4 times a year, but now, just 1.5 months before the exams, without any previous hints or news, we were abruptly informed that the examination will only be held twice. This is a major inconvenience as many aspirants have been preparing according to the promise of 4 attempts.\n2. The dates of the JEE mains have been scheduled in between board examinations of many states, also including CBSE and ISC . I will attach a picture showing the dates. Due to this the students will have difficulty appearing for the examinations as many students have their boards and JEE centres in different cities and also states. Along with this the WBJEE examinations are also in this time period.\n3. The time difference between the two attempts of JEE mains is only of 19 days as opposed to the 70-80 days in previous years. Last year, the 2021 batch got a postponement of the 4th attempt to increase the time between the 3rd and 4th attempt.\n4. Currently many students are involved in board practicals, pre boards, projects, etc. which is really disturbing the students\' studies.\n5. The government authorities are forgetting that even though the covid-19 virus is currently not a direct threat, the students are still facing its ill effects. Many students faced, and have been facing financial problems in their homes, they have had to endure the deaths of friends and family, have had various health aliments.\n6. The 2022 batch is the worst affected batch of covid. Many of the students have not been to school yet. We have had completely online classes from the past 2 years. Students of ICSE and CBSE had to appear for board examinations twice this year, where as last year no boards were conducted. Yet there is no leniency in the date sheet.\n\nOur only demands are to postpone the exams after all the major board examinations so all students can get their deserved score.\n\nAll of us 8 lakh JEE aspirants request you to support us in our protest against NTA(National Testing Authority) in a twitter campaign.\n\nPlease tweet "POSTPONE JEE MAINS 2022" with #PostponeJeeMains2022 and #JeeMainsAfterBoards. Also tag DG-NTA, dpradhanbjp, narendra modi in your tweets. Please tweet in between 7-9 pm today (2nd April 2022).\n\nPlease help us as this examination is the only thing we have in life.

Even now, if you would\'ve noticed, the only news that makes it to those subs are ones in which Ukraine are making some advances, and almost none of their setbacks, already making it an incredibly biased news source.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe should take of note that these subs are over 55% american and makes sense they would only want to hear about the good parts, even if it\'s very selectively handpicked to what they wanna hear,but the massive issue really arises when any news regarding India\'s neutrality (yesterday, the top voted post was US warning India with consequences for their take on the war) is seen as India literally \\*aligning\\* with the Russians. Nobody in their right mind seems to understand what Neutrality really means on a Geopolitical stance, instead they come up with senseless comparisons like "If you see a guy being killed and do nothing, you\'re on the side of the killer" which makes absolutely no sense on a Geopolitical level. None of us are experts on this, but these Mainstream subs would have to think so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is to not even begin on the fact about what US and Russia did in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war, and a million other factors which generally affect India\'s strong Non alignment motives. People just want to hate, and its out there for everyone to see how quickly people devolve back into Racist scum given the first opportunity. It\'s out in the open for everyone to see, On r ukraines\'s recent post as well as literally any post on worldnews regarding India, which at this point is just an excuse to hate. Sick of the west\'s insane virtue signaling and the inaction of the mods there basically shows how they don\'t even think this blatant racism against Indians for not taking sides is even a form of hate/discrimination. It\'s crazy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion the only thing we can do in this is simply ignore, there is absolutely no point engaging in any discussion on a world scale regarding India, you\'ll just be met with 55 different forms of discrimination. These armchair experts\' opinions will anyway in no way have any say in what is actually happening in the diplomatic world, because frankly none of us do as it all happens behind the scenes but nobody is ready to hear that. No point defending India as almost nobody is going to change their opinion which they\'ve already convinced themselves of.

If one is a true Hindu, then it is inherent to our religion that we respect diverse opinions and lifestyles. You must know that Hinduism allows different ideas including Atheism and Monotheism. How can we be okay with such intolerance?\n\nI understand that many of us have felt that we are always expected to accommodate other religions while others are given special rights.

But, rather than standing up for ourselves, we have limited ourselves to Muslim bashing. \n\nNot allowing Muslim traders to do their business.\n\nAnti-Halal movement.\n\nHijab issue.\n\nAlso, all this is only hurting India\'s secular image in the world (Bengaluru - our IT hub- is getting quite a lot of negative publicity)\n\nI mean what exactly is wrong with head coverings if the face is completely visible?

If you think Hindus aren\'t allowed the same privilege then rather than taking away the Hijab from Mulsim girls, we should fight for our own issues (but not like those saffron scarf-wearing idiots who have no respect for the color they are wearing around their necks and were only doing it out of spite).\n\nHonestly, Indian Right Wing has practically become the "Reactionary wing" with no original ideology and opinions other than opposing left/liberal politics? \n\nWe can certainly do better!!!!!!\n\nP.S.

I am looking for advice from you wonderful folks on how to guide him and how should I tell him that his mother had her own life and led it on her own terms. She and her husband did not get along and they moved apart. Calling her whore is not the right thing to do. She did her best to give her children everything they wanted and a better life. He should call it off with his gf. Being a single parent myself I can imagine what his mom must have gone through. I salute and respect her for that.  Her father giving money to his mom is only fulfilling his responsibility towards the children and his gf needs to just shut up \n\nBelow are the extracts from his chats he left last night:\n\nMy parents married in 1997 .\nI was born in 2000 .\nMy sister was born in 2002.\nThey separated in 2009\nNow my mother me and my sister moved out of the place .\nAnd we shifted\nNow in 2011 i started meating X uncle .\nHe was her colleague in her office 7 years younger .\nThey were friends and by 2012 he started coming home to live with us .\nHe was my mum's junior in her office .\nBut worked in the same room .\nAfter that we started living together and we have lived a very normal happy life .\nAnd I also meet my father every weekend and my grandparents too .\nNow I know they didn't cheat\nBut when I ask my mother that why did you guy separate ,she says there were arguments , misunderstandings , differences and Toxicity in the relationship\nAnd then she also says that it's between her and papa .\nAnd it her pvt life and she has done everything to make our life better\nAlso when X uncle was staying with us ,she had asked to not tell her father (my nanu ) as he was seriously ill and couldn't take it .\nBut my Nani knew about it .\nThis lead to me lying to my nanu that no other man was living in the house\nWho is wrong in this case ? Me or my mother.\nToday\nBut when I ask my mother that why did you guy separate ,she says there were arguments , misunderstandings , differences and Toxicity in the relationship\nAlso did my .mother make the decision of X uncle living with us too fast ?\nShe met him in 2008 and me and my sister met him in 2009 and he gradually became a friend ,he got close to us and in 2012 he settled with us .\nDoes this make my mother wrong ?\n\nAs my parents seperated in 2009 but their marriage was over in 2006 only .\nThe last three years they were just living together but like just co existing .\nAnd in the three years my mother was Arranging her finances to buy a house for her and her children .\nMy dad helped her financially back then .\nMy mother had a govt job ,stil has one .\nMy father still financially helps us .\nThe two of them still talk on phone comfortably .They Don't meet but they do talk on the phone about us (me and my sister ) .\n\nAnd me and my sister also have a very comfy relai with our father and his wife .\n\nIs all of this wrong ?\nIs my mother wrong in still taking the money from my father ?\nIs my mother just using everyone ?\nI have been living comfortably without knowing so much but recently I've been trying to talk and find out and this is what I found out ..\nAnd when I told my gf that my mother is now at stage in her govt job that she has the privilege to take leaves .\n\nYes when she takes an off ,X uncle works more .\nNo i don't think I have abused her. I think she's a whore who wanted to sleep around and couldn't be faithful. Your grandma got in the way, so she made the naukri ka bahana, uprooted her children, and left to go fuck whoever she could behind everyone's back and ruined her children's moral upbringing.\nShe is worse than a prostitute because at least they're forced. She is just begging her ex husband for money while not even meeting the man and forcing her children to starve for any semblance of normalcy. And the job she so loved, fucks around sleeping as her latest hookup does her work for her at the office while a full-time maid does the work at home.\nThis was her response when I said don't abuse my mother .\nAm I wrong in defending my mother ?\nIs my mother all wrong in this ?\nFor all i know ,my mother father ,my X step parents all tried to co parent me in the best manner they thought ."<br />Author: 'only_mann'  id: 'ttp3d9'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ttp3d9/whenever_i_needed_a_perspective_i_have_turned_to/</li>

Arranged marriages still make up a large portion of how people get married here. But what happens that due to some circumstances there is friction between the wife and the husband and they look for divorce and mind you I am not talking about the people who still take dowry and abuse and what not. I am talking about two married individuals where both of them are earning. \n\nThere are many things that potential partners especially in arranged marriage might not talk about especially finances. Do you think there should be a provision in the Hindu Marriage Act which should take into consideration the earning potential of the individuals when giving a ruling whether the man needs to pay the alimony or not? Like the reasoning that while being married the women was accustomed to a certain lifestyle and the husband has to pay and provide for that lifestyle is crazy to me. \n\nAgain in the context of individuals with a good earning potential. Prenup in it's core is to say that we both have individual finances and we are going to keep it that way. You money is yours, mine is mine, we both will come together to contribute in building a family.

Even if discussed in humanity classes, mostly students are thrown with straight facts.

This condition is worldwide. And then we wonder why crimes are happening. We have got tools in our hand. It is possible that through early interventions from childhood we can handle anti social behaviour in humans (Requires cognitive therapy and needs trained psychologists, some programmes are running in west , but in India mental health is not properly known and rarely considered an issue)\n\nParents are very unaware, they like throwing money on expensive educational platform which are running on foreign funding and having toxic work culture.\n\nAll in all we need to redesign structure of education. We demand democracy, but educational institutions are themselves lacking it. In name of discipline, students are simply supposed to obey the authority and never question the internal functioning and management.\n\nThis ks the responsibility of all the educators. Future of India is dependent on them and they have to be very careful around it.\n\nIrony is, in India those who fails in other fields are the one who join education sector.

The word ‘shaheed’, which is used as a Hindustani alternative to the word ‘martyr’, also has religious connotations and is linked to the concept of Shahadat in Islam. \n\n The word ‘martyr’ is said to have its roots in the Greek word ‘martur’. Various dictionaries define ‘martyr’ as a person who voluntarily suffers death as penalty of refusing to renounce religion. \n\nSince the armed forces of India are not associated with any one religion and do not lay down their lives for religious principles, the use of such words for their sacrifice has been found wrong in several quarters, including the top brass of the Army. Many retired senior officers and legal experts have pointed out that using the term ‘martyr’ or ‘shaheed’ for a soldier who dies for his country is incorrect in the Indian perspective. \n\nIn February 2022, the Army issued a letter to all its commands asking them to desist from using the word ‘martyr’ as it may not be appropriate for soldiers who die in the line of duty. They have been, instead, asked to use phrases such as ‘laid down their lives’, ‘killed in action’, ‘supreme sacrifice for the nation’, ‘fallen heroes’, ‘Indian Army braves and fallen soldiers’, ‘battle casualty’, ‘bravehearts’, ‘braves whom we lost’, and *veergati/veergati prapt/veer*.'<br />Author: 'Dumbhosadika'  id: 'ts070f'<br />Score:36<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ts070f/til_why_indian_armed_forces_dont_use_the_term/</li>

In place of petrol, ethanol will be used. Multiple motor companies has taken the project. Now Ethanol is produced by our farmers from Sugar, corn, broken rice etc. Economy of Ethanol will form 2 lakh crore economy from 40 lakh economy. Along with this, cars run by green hydrogen will be in market too, where the green hydrogen will be made by organic wastes. Our textile, transport etc will be run by green hydrogen. Within two years, electric vehicles and fossil fuel vehicles will be of same price. So ethanol, methanol, green hydrogen, electric etc will be the substitute for diesel, petrol etc."\n\nNow my questions are :-\n\n1) How will it effect our economy ? \n\n2) Are these sustainable as a substitute of energy ? \n\n3) What are the long term consequences we have to face from the change in power resources ?'<br />Author: 'dipmalya'  id: 'tr2a5u'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tr2a5u/some_questions_regarding_the_points_made_by/</li>

A lot of them took up Islam as their religion, while some took up Christianity. Very few became Hindus as the caste system did not leave much opportunity for them.\n\nThis is what the opening paragraph says. It tries to portray the Siddis as African slaves who willingly took up Islam and Christianity, but portrays Hinduism as a backwards, caste-ridden ideology that provides little room for others. This is blatantly false. The Siddis are a group of Africans, possibly of Ethiopian origins who were enslaved by Islamic empires first, then later by Portuguese empires. They were brutally enslaved and brought over to India, they most certainly did not willingly take up Christianity or Islam. \n\nIf you look at Wikipedia, this is what it says.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddi#:~:text=The%20Siddi%20(pronounced%20%5Bs%C9%AAd%CC%AAd%CC%AAi%5D,indentured%20servants%2C%20slaves%20and%20mercenaries.\n\nIt says that the largest group of Siddis in Karnataka are Hindus. This was the only religion that they took up willingly. Siddis are an African group that was enslaved brutally and brought to India by the Islamic empires. Islam was forced upon them. The same happened with the Catholic Portuguese rulers. Many of them chose Hinduism willingly, and blended it with their own traditional African beliefs that they were forced to abandon by Christians and Muslims, because Hinduism allows you to blend in whatever you want. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thenewsminute.com/article/meet-shantaram-budna-karnatakas-first-mlc-siddi-community-african-descent-129655%3famp\n\nHere, there is even an article on a Siddi RSS member who became MLC. \n\nThis is a community many people outside of Karnataka are unfamiliar with.

      <li>Title::: 'Lets Talk About Halal Food And Why Do We Need An Equivalent Board.'<br />Body: '\n\nWhat makes food Halal Certified?\n1) A halal slaughter involves a sharp knife. \n2) The animal should not see before it is slaughtered.\n3) The animal must be well-rested and fed before slaughtering.\n4) The slaughtering may not take place in front of other animals. The jugular vein of the neck should be cut in order to drain all the blood of the live animal and the butcher should invoke Allah\'s name saying "Bismillah" in order to take the animal\'s life to meet the lawful need of food. \n5) Only vegetarian animals are allowed to be killed. Birds that eat seeds and vegetables are permitted. Birds that eat forbidden items like insects are only permitted if insects are not a major part of their diet. Insects such as locusts are permitted, all others forbidden. \n6) Fruits and vegetables must be inspected before eating to see that they have no insects. \n7) Fish killed by the removal from water, or by a blow, are permitted. Shellfish are forbidden. \n8) Cheeses coagulated with acid or vegetable enzymes are permitted. Grains are permitted, provided they have not been prepared using animal fats or other forbidden ingredients. Vinegar which is not made from fermenting alcohol is permitted.\n(Kosher also follows similar demand and parameters set by the Jew community)\n\nWhy was Halal Banned In EU?\n\n&gt; The Court of Justice of the European Union (EU) Thursday allowed the European Union states to impose a ban on religious slaughtering like Halal and Kosher, of animals. The Court today ruled in favour of a regulation already imposed in the Flemish region of Belgium, which, on the grounds of animal rights, banned the slaughter of livestock without stunning them first. Belgium’s Flanders regional government had issued the order in 2017 which took effect in 2019. The order said that the slaughterhouses must stun livestock before slaughtering them. While issuing the directive the court said: “The court concludes that the measures contained in the decree allow a fair balance to be struck between the importance attached to animal welfare and the freedom of Jewish and Muslim believers to manifest their religion.” Muslims and Jews opined that the ban on Halal and Kosher slaughter is a ‘denial of democracy’ Both Muslim halal and Jewish kosher slaughtering requires the animal to be conscious when its throat is slit. The case revolved around animal welfare versus the right to religious freedom, guaranteed in the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights. This decision which Muslims and Jewish believe is against their traditions, which require livestock to be conscious when their throats are slit, has irked people of both the communities, which have called the judgement discriminatory. An umbrella organisation for Jewish groups in Belgium slammed the decision as a ‘denial of democracy’ that did not respect the rights of minority groups. “The fight continues, and we will not admit defeat until we have exhausted all our legal remedies, which is not yet the case,” Yohan Benizri, head of the Belgian Federation of Jewish Organisations, said. Meanwhile, Rabbi Menachem Margolin, chairman of the European Jewish Association, said that the court ruling represented a “sad day for European Jewry”. “What a terrible message to send to European Jewry, that you and your practices are not welcome here. This is a basic denial of our rights as European citizens,” he said in a statement. The Muslim community in Belgium was also unhappy with the ruling, which they believed insulted their traditions. The Belgian Coordination Committee of Islamic Institutions said the decision had been a “big disappointment” and argued that the court was pandering to populist sentiments. \n\nAs we all know there has been a uproar among Sanatani leaders to free Hindus Temples from Government sanctioned abuse. What I am proposing is to make Dharmic Board. Dharmic Board will collect money from temples as the government is already because of the existing mechanism but they will have many responsibilities such as\n1) Revival/Maintaince/Repair of Temples.\n\n2) Langar Like Services for the poor and needy people in/around the temple.\n\n3) Establishing a Satvik board which will issue satvik certificates for companies just like halal board is doing now. \n\n4) Scholarships for the students who need financial assistants.\n\n5) Establishing a sister Board for registration and safe keeping of temple land. With the same or equivalent powers granted to waqk board. This board will make sure the temple land is not being illegally captured by anyone and file cases on temples that were forcefully converted to mazars and mosques and file cases on state governments that have already occupied temple lands illegally.\n\nI\'d like to elaborate on funtions of Satvik board now. \nSatvik board will have catalogue of certificates to issue from.\n1) Jain Compliant Certified Food.\n2) Vegan Compliant Certified Food.\n3) Vegetarian Compliant Certified Food.\n4) Non-Vegetarian Compliant Certified Food.\n\nEvery product from a packet of namkeen to lipstick to even Vaastu compliant building can and should be Satvik certified. If hindus return the same courtesy that non-hindus do to us, this can be a billion dollar franchise in a matter of a decade. We can focus on Bharat as of now. But in future Dharmic Board can also open NGO\'s in neighboring countries for the restoration of thousands of temple lying in ruins now because of Islamic attacks in past and even on going. Imagine the number of communities we can benifit from making this mechanism into a reality.\nWe can even launch special packages to benifit Hindus in states where they are in Minority and face relentless abuse and desecration of temples everyday. This mechanism will no doubt will also help in denting the effect of forced conversion by giving monetary benifits in exchange of converting their faiths. \n\nFor this to succeed we need hindus to be aware and ask for hotels and restaurants show their satvik certifications before eating. Boycott and refuse to eat if thats not present. Its time we wake up before its too late. \n\nThese were my thoughts on the matter. Any feedback/Suggestions/Criticism is not only appreciated but demanded, no matter who you are. Wating for your input.

      <li>Title::: 'TIL: "Sugar" comes from Sanskrit, "Chenni" from Chinese'<br />Body: 'Interesting little factoid I found about the words we use for sugar around the world:\n\nEtymology enables words to deliver past facts and can become an independent source of knowledge. Here the word sugar is traced to the Chinese term Sha-Che, literally "Sand-Sugar plant," signifying a sand-like product from the sugar plant, which is sugar. Sha-Che underwent the following phonetic changes: Sha-Che = Sha-Ke = Shar-Ker = Sharkera, which became the Sanskrit word for sugar, with the variant Sha-Kera. Its popular vernacular form became Shak-Ker. This entered Arabic as Al-Shakker, changing into Al-Sukker, pronounced as "Assuker." Muslims in Spain gave the Spanish their word when Assuker = Azucar (Spanish). Sukker, the real Arabic word, entered Old French as Suker-e, Italian as Zuker-o or Zucckero, and German as Zucker. When "k" is emphasized it can become aspirated as "kh" or doubled as "kk," or mutate into "g." Sukker then changed into Sugar with the "s" further mutating into "sh," giving the final form Shugar, written as Sugar. The Greeks directly borrowed the popular vernacular word Shakker. It was Hellenized as Sakkharon, mentioned by Discoredes in 56 A.D. From the Greek it passed into Latin as Saccharum. In India the large crystalline form of sugar is called Misri. Its Chinese original is Mi-Sha-Li, "sweet-pebble-glassy," a sweet crystalline (glassy) substance the size of pebbles. Another form of sugar is in small crystals, which in a heap appear opaque-white or porcelain-white rather than transparent salt-white. Porcelain-white sugar was called Cheeni, where Cheeni = Porcelain. Thus, Cheeni does not mean Chinese sugar, nor Misri Egyptian sugar. Both these forms of sugar were sweetening agents not intended to be directly consumed. But a sweet, composed of sugar and an article of food, was known in Chinese as Kan-Di, "Sweet-Drop." This became Candy in English, Qand in Arabic, Khanda in Sanskrit and Khand in vernaculars. \n\nSource: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6764089/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6764089/)'<br />Author: 'ididacannonball'  id: 'tqqnde'<br />Score:76<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tqqnde/til_sugar_comes_from_sanskrit_chenni_from_chinese/</li>

(More about CFI at the end of the thread)\n\nDecember 27, 2021:\n\nSix students from Udupi Women\'s PU college began protesting for their right to wear a hijab after they were barred from attending classes with hijab.\n\n~~The girls subsequently petitioned the HC seeking relief~~\n\nA Hindustan Times article reported that these students had participated in the protests upon **receiving counselling from CFI leaders**. And that the protests only starters gaining momentum after CFI became involved.\n\nThe girls then petitioned the HC seeking relief\n\nAnti-hijab protests gained momentum in January with protests spreading to Koppa, Chikmagalur, and Kundapur.\n\nOn 2nd February, a video of Kundapur Govt PU college shutting its gates on students wearing hijab went viral.\n\nOn 5th February, an article by the Indian Express also reported the following quote by Abdul Azees Udyavar, the organising secretary of Udupi District Muslim Okkutta and district president of welfare party of Idia\n\n&gt;"it (the controversy) started after the results of urban local bodies elections in December. **Now it is being used to polarise voters**" ... "if Hijab was an issue for the students , I am sure parents would\'ve brought it to our notice. It could\'ve been solved without much hype."\n\nFebruary 5, 2022\n\nThe Karnataka government ordered a ban on wearing clothes that disturb equality, integrity and public order.\n\n~~The govt order said, Invoking 133 (2) of the Karnataka Education Act-1983, which says a uniform style of clothes has to be worn-compulsorily. The private school administration can choose a uniform of their choice."~~\n\nFYI: The Karnataka Education Act does not make any provision for a uniform in educational institutions. S133(2) gives the government power to give directions to educational institutions. The government has invoked these powers to pass directions regarding uniforms in educational institutions.\n\nTherefore, the ban was not specific to hijab, but also included a ban on saffron shawls and any other religious garb meant to be worn as a protest to the college\'s policy on religious garb on campus.\n\nFebruary 8, 2022\n\nProtests erupt outside MGM college in Udupi with classmates winding up on opposite ends.**\\***\n\nThe Karnataka HC began hearing petitions by students who had challenged the hijab ban.\n\nCM Basavaraj Bommai ordered all high s schools and colleges to remain shut for three days.\n\n**\\***While most mainstream media discussions called the government order a "**hijab ban**", every photograph of the gathered protesters showed them covered head to toe in a **burqa**. The not-so-subtle difference between the two went by unnoticed.\n\nFebruary 10, 2022\n\nThe Karnataka HC passed an interim order allowing the opening of colleges but that no student should insist on wearing "religious clothes" until the time the court decides the matter.\n\nMarch 15, 2022\n\nKarnataka HC dismissed the petitions by Muslim girl students seeking permission to wear hijab, effectively upholding the ban on hijab.\n\nA female Muslim Judge of the Karnataka High court also happened to be part of the bench of judges that passed this order.\n\n(More on the CFI: CFI is a political organisation calling itself “a neo social students movement, which aims to empower the campuses by developing a new generation of activists” . However the organisation has been reported to have roots in Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), an organisation formed by a group of supporters of Jamaat e Islam e Hind, which aims to work towards the establishment of Islam all over India, in the late 1970s.)  \n \n\n*This thread was written by Instagram user Tisha Saran (@tishasays)*'<br />Author: 'Familiar_Internet'  id: 'tqova8'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tqova8/the_hijab_controversy_timeline_credit_tishasays/</li>

However, instead of experiencing shame and remorse, a significant section of media, academics and intellectuals belonging to civil society have instead stooped to distorting history, even discrediting the victims themselves. It is therefore imperative that we, the Pandits, ensure that our history is preserved.\n\nVictims of transgenerational trauma, none of the horrors of our past were discussed in our families. Growing up, one heard hushed references of a time when the pandits were reduced to a handful of families in the valley. When asked about our origin, past exoduses were mentioned without any detail. Few took the effort to read and inform themselves. Some even falling for the narrative generated by the media and historians.  \n\n\nKashmiri history has been very well documented. Every Indian in school learned that Kalhan wrote Rajtarangini one of the best written chronicles of rulers in human history. Yet few know that Kalhan, a Kashmiri Pandit’s book is primarily on the kings of Kashmir. Jonaraja continues with Dvitiya and his pupil Srivara with the Tritiya Rajtarangini covering centuries. In addition to Kashmiri, we also have Persian and other historical sources like the Sikhs who ruled Kashmir.  \n\n\nLike the Zoroastrians, the advent of Islam in Kashmir in 14th century was disastrous for the Kashmiri Hindus. By the end of the century, we experienced the first exodus.  \n\n\n**First Exodus (1389 – 1420)**  \n\n\nThis period is marked by the rule of Sultan Sikander who was given the honorary title of ‘Butshikan’ or destroyers of idols. He was under the influence of the Sufi Mir Mohamad Hamdani who urged him to eradicate the infidel’s root and branch, from Kashmir.  \n\n\nRoyal edicts were issued, ordering the Pandits to convert or die. Bhatta Mazaar (Grave of Pandits who were and are referred as Bhattas) on the Dal Lake in Srinagar is said to have received it infamous name as the place where ‘7 maunds’ of sacred thread collected form the bodies of the Pandit drowned in the Dal was burnt.  \n\n\nJonaraja, paints a graphic picture writing that crowds of Hindus ran away in different directions, their life miserable with hunger and fatigue. Many died in the scorching heat. Some disguised as Muslims, roamed about the country, searching for their distressed families. “Hindus lolled out their tongues like dogs, looking for a dog\'s morsel at every door.”\xa0He compares the genocide to locusts, descending on and destroying a paddy field.\n\nCulturally, the eradication took place by imposing a ban on Hindu festivals and destruction of their temples. The famous Sun temple at Martand was burnt down. Material from many temples destroyed were used to build masjids and sufi khanqahs. The khanqah in Bijbehera is still referred to as the Vijiveshwara Khanqah.  \n\n\nOne of the few oral histories told in our families, refers to only 11 Pandit families surviving in the valley at the end of this period.\n\n**Second Exodus (1505 – 1514)**  \n \n\nFollowing the exodus there was about a century of peace and tranquility especially under the rule of Sultan Zain-ul-Abidin. The idea of Kashmiriyat took root during his reign. These good times unfortunately did not last and when the Chaks, Shias from Dard took control, the killings and persecution restarted. The Pandits became an easy target in the conflict between the ultra-conservative Shia, Noorbakshiya and the Sunnis. There are many brutal episodes during this period that made many Pandits flee to seek refuge out of the valley.  \n\n\nMir Shamshauddin Araqi a zealot from Herat visited Kashmir twice. Each time heralding death and misery. According to the Baharistan-i-Shahi, a Persian chronicle of the period “All traces of infidelity and idol worship was replaced by Islamic symbols and the infidels and holy thread wearers of Kashmir were converted to Islam.” 24,000 Brahmin families were converted to Islam. 2000 Brahmins were converted each day by administering the Kalima after removing their sacred thread. The ritual followed by circumcision and feeding of beef. After the valley Araqi turned his attention to Buddhist Kargil which till today is a Shia majority district of Ladakh.  \n\n\n**Third Exodus (Mughals Jahangir-Aurangzeb and later Mughals)**  \n \n\nAkbar conquered Kashmir in 1585 and brought respite to the Pandits and ushered in an era of peace. He repealed the hated jizya and other taxes imposed by the Chaks. According to the Ain-i-akbari he visited the temple at Martand and offered gifts. Kashmiriyat was rekindled. This era produced the poet Habba Khatoon.\n\nHis son and grandson sadly did not follow him. Jahangir’s love for Kashmir did not extend to the Pandits. His subedar Itquad Khan imposed taxes and forcefully converted many Hindus. Francoi Bernier the French traveler writes that Shahjahan’s summer palace was built from demolished temples. The puritanical Aurangzeb reimposed Jizya and his governor unleashed a reign of terror. According to Sikh historical accounts the Pandits asked Guru Teg Bahadur to intervene. The resulting confrontation between the Sikh and Mughals resulted in the martyrdom of the Guru.  \n\n\nIt was in this period that large numbers of Pandits found refuge in the Bazaar Sitaram area of Delhi and formed a Kashmiri Mohalla. My personal connection is that my grandfather was born in the haveli of his maternal grandfather there. More famously this was where Kamla Kaul grew up and married Jawaharlal.  \n\n\n**Fourth Exodus (Afghans 1753 to the Sikhs)**  \n \n\nAbdali’s capture of Kashmir started another horror-filled chapter for the Pandits. In addition to the atrocities in the past the Afghans especially targeted the Pandit women. Pandit parents resorted to shaving the head of their daughters, some even cutting off their noses and ears to protect them. The Afghans introduced a practice called khos where a Muslim was entitled to jump on the back and take rides. Pandits were even banned from wearing turbans and shoes.  \n\n\n**Fifth Exodus (1931 to post-Independence)**  \n\n\nMaharaja Ranjit Singh annexation of Kashmir into the Sikh Empire and the subsequent Dogra rule were finally a prosperous phase for the Pandits. There was upward mobility, and many moved to elite positions in the state’s hierarchy. However, as seen previously the Pandits became an easy target when the Muslims in the valley revolted against the Dogras. In an attempt to destabilize Dogra rule, on July 13, 1931, large scale violence against the Pandits was instigated.\xa0 21 rioters were killed and the day and since has been observed as Martyr’s Day. The Pandits remember the day as Bhatta Loot or the day the Pandits were looted.  \n\n\nPost-Independence Pandits were forced to flee because of discriminatory policies and laws that targeted them specifically. In 1950 an act called the J&amp;K Landed Estates Abolition Act was enacted that confiscated land without providing compensation. The Pandits were targeted as their land holdings were typically agricultural. Orchards and pasture lands that were mostly Muslim owned were exempt. A tiny minority in the state, the Pandits formed the majority of the 9000 whose land was taken away. In addition, there was rampant discrimination in employment and education. Indians are well versed with affirmative action where a minimum quota is provided for the backward groups. In Kashmir, the government passed an order creating a maximum admission limit for Pandit students.  \n\n\n**Sixth Exodus (1986)**\n\nLargely restricted to South Kashmir, this was really the precursor to the next one. Adding to the list of bizarre occurrences in Kashmir, this riot was instigated by the Chief Minister GM Shah himself. In response to protest in Jammu, the CM addressed a rally in Anantnag (referred as Islamabad by the Kashmiri Muslim) where he declared that Islam was in danger. The frenzied crowd attacked Pandits and their properties. Numerous temples were destroyed. In 2012 the state government admitted in the assembly that 208 temples had been attacked and damaged. One of the primary characters would become India’s home minister a few years later.  \nThe near complete silence from the Indian leadership, intelligentsia and media convinced many Pandits in South Kashmir, whose source of livelihood had been destroyed that there was no future for them in the valley. It also marked the establishment of Jihad to the separatist movement. The slogans started to shift from *Azadi* to *Kashmir banega Pakistan* and the establishment of Nizam-i-Mustafa.  \n\n\n**Seventh Exodus (Post 1989)**  \n \n\nThe response, rather the lack of response by the Indian state and the citizenry to the event in 1986 signaled the Jihadi that Nizam-i-Mustafa was a real possibility. That all that was needed was one huge thrust to oust the kafirs. The rest of India was too busy with Mandir and Masjid to notice and care. The Kashmir Files narrates some of the incidents that occurred in the period and the politics behind it.  \n\n\nIt has now been over three decades. An entire generation born in exile is now having their own children. Much like my family, the earlier refugees, the current ones have started to lose their link with the valley. With homes looted and burnt down there is no place to return amid mostly hostile neighbors. Most financially distressed sold off their properties cheap. Virtually nothing was done by the State after Independence to protect and preserve our culture.\n\nMy own family migrated during the reign of Aurangzeb. They first settled in Bareilly and later moved to Lucknow. Pandit Zind Ram Chaudhary acquired the name Tankha in his role of paymaster of Nawab Asif-ud-Daula\'s army. He built a Shiv temple and a shrine for our kuldevi Ragya dressed in Kashmiri attire.  \n \n\nPandits migrated all over North India and put down roots in different towns and cities adding to them. Endogamy helped preserve most of the culture and traditions with some adaptations. Somethings that needed a core population like language was lost. The earlier migrants like my family do not speak Kashmiri. Today even in the valley the Sharda script is all but dead. Indian currency has the amount written in all official languages. Kashmiri is written in the Persian script.  \n\n\nSikandar Butshikan’s dream of a Pandit free Kashmir may finally be realized in 80% Hindu majority Independent India. The faithful can then add ‘Bhattashikan’ (destroyers of Pandits) …'<br />Author: 'alexaxl'  id: 'tqd6bs'<br />Score:68<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tqd6bs/dont_get_angry_share_be_aware_wise_as_chanakya/</li>

He does seem to have cult followings, it seems like a more nationalistic nation than ever that values religion above all, and overall seems like an environment that suits Hindus more than it does other Indians.\n\nI thought the way that Hijab Row went down in Karnataka was an example of some of the ripple effects that Modi has had on India, and how it has made its way into various parts of the subcontinent. I will link a video down below that explained Hijab Row really well.\n\nOverall, I have a pretty negative impression of Modi and there seems to be no appropriate alternative for him to compete with him. What are your thoughts on Modi though? How do you as Indians living in India view the BJP and their actions? I am open to having my mind changed, and for people to bring their varying perspectives.\n\nLink to the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omsOKE1pu80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omsOKE1pu80)'<br />Author: 'Purple_Green_2070'  id: 'tqc2o1'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tqc2o1/as_indians_living_in_india_what_are_your_honest/</li>

That is not the case with religion. It has to be pan-India. What is the problem if a community is majority in Jammu &amp; Kashmir but minority in all other states. In Lakshadweep, Hindus may be 2% but they follow Hinduism which is majority in India.” \n\nIn his petition, Upadhyay had cited the example of J&amp;K and said, “In Jammu &amp; Kashmir, the government allotted 717 out of a total 753 scholarships to Muslim students based on the 1993 notification and none to Hindu students.” \n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-rejects-pil-seeking-minority-status-for-hindus-in-some-states/articleshow/72860951.cms\n\n---\n\n# Ashwini Upadhyay files a PIL seeking justice to the Hindus in the state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir \n\nIn his petition, Upadhyay had cited the example of J&amp;K and said, “In Jammu &amp; Kashmir, the government allotted 717 out of a total 753 scholarships to Muslim students based on the 1993 notification and none to Hindu students.”\n\nParasaran said Section 2(c) of National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992, “arbitrarily” notified Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists and Parsis as minority communities on October 23, 1993, based on their national population. He said some of these communities, despite being in majority in some states, were cornering government sponsored benefits meant for minority communities of those states.\n\n---\n\n# Feb 2020 - Approach HC, says SC on minority tag for Hindus\n\nA bench of Justices R F Nariman and S Ravindra Bhat turned down BJP functionary Ashwini Upadhyay’s plea to lay down guidelines to grant minority status to a community on the basis of state-wise population.\n\nThe petitioner contended that Hindus are in minority in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Punjab, Lakshadweep, Mizoram, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur. He said Hindus should be allowed to avail welfare schemes meant for minorities in these states. Upadhyay said minority status should be decided at the state level and not at the national level. \n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/approach-hc-says-sc-on-minority-tag-for-hindus/articleshow/74234236.cms\n\n---\n\n# Jan 2022 - SC grants last chance to Centre to file reply on PIL for identifying minorities\n\nThe Supreme Court Friday granted the "last opportunity" to the Centre to file its reply on a PIL seeking directions for framing of guidelines identifying minorities at the state level as Hindus are in a minority in 10 states and are not able to avail the benefits of schemes meant for minorities.\n\nThe apex court also allowed the plea seeking transfer of cases from several high courts to it against the Centre\'s notification to declare five communities -- Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Parsis -- as minorities and tagged the matter with the main petition.\n\n"Rational basis of declaring certain religions as minority by central government as they have less population in the states is contravened when benefits of schemes for minority are acquired by those religious minorities in states where they are in majority and those religious communities who are actually minorities are not been given equal status," the plea said.\n\nThe petition said that denial of minority rights to actual religious and linguistic minorities is a violation of right of minority enshrined under Articles 14 (equality before the law) and 21 (no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law) of the Constitution. \n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-rejects-pil-seeking-minority-status-for-hindus-in-some-states/articleshow/72860951.cms\n\n---\n\n# Centre refuses to issue guidelines to declare Hindus in 8 states as \'minorities\', left to state govts\n\nCentre’s affidavit said: “It is submitted that the state governments can also declare a religious or linguistic community as a minority community within the state. For example, the government of Maharashtra has notified the Jews as a minority community within the state of Maharashtra …in view of the states also notifying communities the petitioner\'s allegation that the real minorities in Ladakh, Mizoram, Lakshadweep, Kashmir Nagaland, Meghalaya Arunachal Punjab and Manipur cannot establish and administer educational institutions of their choice is not correct. \n\nIt is submitted that matters such as declaring that followers of Judaism Bahaism and Hinduism who are minorities in Ladakh, Mizoram Lakshadweep, Kashmir, Nagaland, Meghalaya Arunachal, Punjab and Manipur can establish and administer educational institutions of their choice in the said state and lay down guidelines for identification of minority at the state level may be considered by the concerned state governments.”\n\nSo on one hand they say they can\'t do this from a central govt\'s perspective and are pushing the matters into the State Govt, otoh how many State Govts where they rule have they taken up the issue, setup a committee or come forward to change the status quo\n\nIt shows how clueless and lack of will and power the BJP govt has, they hardly rile up the courage to look into such matters, this has been ongoing since 2014 now\n\n---\n\nSC has finally give the date for hearing \n\n# Minority tag for Hindus: SC hearing on March 28, govt yet to file counter-affidavit\n\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/india/minority-tag-hindus-supreme-court-hearing-govt-counter-affidavit-7837919/\n\n\n**Ashwini , Ashwini Upadhyay Main jhukega nahi, Sala**\n\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n- https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-rejects-pil-seeking-minority-status-for-hindus-in-some-states/articleshow/72860951.cms\n- https://indianexpress.com/article/india/minority-tag-hindus-supreme-court-hearing-govt-counter-affidavit-7837919/\n- https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-article-30-of-the-indian-constitution\n- https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/hindus-minority-status-in-states-where-they-are-in-minority-centre-tells-supreme-court-195122\n- https://www.timesnownews.com/india/centre-refuses-to-issue-guidelines-to-declare-hindus-in-8-states-as-minorities-left-to-state-govts-article-90480221\n- https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/states-free-to-identify-minorities-and-allow-them-to-administer-educational-institutions/article65265596.ece\n- https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2018/05/26/minority-tag-for-hindus-in-7-states-ncm-panel-to-hear-stakeholders-on-june-14.html'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'tq8rsc'<br />Score:25<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tq8rsc/debate_of_exercising_the_rights_of_minorities/</li>

He blessed us out of pure love and devotion, and has a massive respect for our religion too. \n\nThere are many Muslims who are so productive to society like Abdul kalam, etc. They have a lot of respect for our way of life and believe it is their duty to spread peace in the world, along with scientific development.\n\nI have visited a few mosques, they are architecturally beautiful. I also enjoy sufi music a lot. There are many arabs in gulf countries who do have a huge liking for us and our culture.\n\nOn the other hand:\n\nIslam has been used to butcher and torture my people for 1000 years.\n\nCountless temples have been destroyed in india.\n\nWomen took as sex slaves. The hindu just mountain range means the killer of hindus because that is what happened. \n\nAll the things that happened in kashmir, and the fact that many Muslims deny it to this day.\n\nNot just jndian religions, but looking at the way they tried to eradicate Judaism, I don't like it.

The place where zoroaster was born in Afghanistan is a mosque today, same goes for temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism, is a mosque today.of course, we all know about our sites too.\n\nHaving read the quran, it is barbaric and every second verse is about how kafirs go to hell. It calls for the violence on kafirs all the time, asks men to treat women badly, etc. It also has many scientific mistakes which normally wouldn't be an issue, but a verse in the quran says if there is even one mistake in this book, then it is not from God (ie Islam is false according to them).\n\nThe dilemma is that how can I hate something that is so dear to all those great Muslims who have helped me out in life? After all, krishna said whoever you worship, you are ultimately worshipping him only.

      <li>Title::: '[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Sri Lanka looks to IMF for bailout, Commonwealth unravels in the Caribbean, and the partition of the Arab World'<br />Body: '***For all my previous posts in the Geopolitics Thread, see*** [***ididacannonball\'s Corner***](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/wiki/ididacannonballcorner)\n\nWelcome to this week\'s edition of the Geopolitics Thread, the place where we discuss all the latest events from around the world. Geopolitics has been the main theme for a month now with the Ukraine war, but plenty of other things are happening in the world too. In this thread, I am happy to to share the third in a series on the history of the Arabian Peninsula. Please share your thoughts and interesting news articles in the comments. Here are a few to get the conversation started:\n\n# Top Stories\n\n1. [Sri Lanka\'s economic crisis deepens](https://gulfnews.com/business/sri-lanka-is-facing-clear-solvency-problem-imf-report-1.86741325)\n\nAlready hurt by the collapse of tourism due to COVID-19 and the Rajapaksa clan\'s decision to destroy agriculture for the sake of organic farming, Sri Lanka\'s economic meltdown seems to have no end in sight. The country has further been damaged by the huge increase in global crude oil prices due to the Ukraine war, and has been forced to hike fuel prices yet again. With the population seething, troops have been deployed to protect petrol pumps. Meanwhile, newspapers have stopped publication as the country ran out of paper (newsprint). An IMF report stated bluntly that the country needs a debt restructuring plan, as the leadership prepares to approach the IMF for a bailout in April. Sri Lanka has $3.9 bn in external, USD-denominated debt due in 2022, but only has $2 bn in foreign exchange reserves. Sri Lanka already received aid from India and Pakistan, and is also seeking aid from China. \n\n2. [Houthi\'s attack Saudi oil depot](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/reports-of-huge-fire-at-aramco-oil-facility-in-saudi-arabia.html)\n\nA huge fire raged in the Red Sea city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia after the Iran-backed Houthis claimed to have successfully attacked an oil storage facility on the outskirts of the city. The Houthis, who are fighting a war with Saudi Arabia over control of Yemen, claimed to have used armed drones for the attack, which is becoming an increasingly common, cheap, and effective means of waging war around the world. The attacked was condemned by Arab leaders and also, interestingly, by the Prime Minister of Israel. In retaliation, the Saudis launched a new round of air strikes in Yemen, though the war there is at a stalemate.\n\n3. [Biden raises the rhetoric against Putin](https://www.kwch.com/2022/03/26/biden-ending-europe-trip-with-unity-message-that-echoes-past/)\n\nConcluding a 4-day visit to Europe to reassure NATO allies, US President Biden used increasingly harsh language against Russia President Putin, calling him everything from a war criminal to a butcher. However, one remark stood out -  “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.” The US had to quickly walk back on this remark, which smacked of regime change in Moscow. The US clarified later that it is not seeking to depose Putin. Meanwhile, the US sent troops to bolster NATO\'s eastern frontier in Poland and Slovenia, even as Russia\'s war in Ukraine enters its fifth week. \n\n4. [North Korea reported to have tested longest ICBM yet](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/north-korea-tested-biggest-long-range-missile-foreign/story?id=83645211)\n\nIn the 12th such launch this year, North Korea reported to have conducted a test of a nuclear-capable Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM). This missile reached its highest peak ever at 3,700 km - which means that, if its trajectory were tilted, it could hit the US mainland. This follows failed attempts last year to revive talks with Pyongyang, which has since essentially stopped after the US became engulfed by the war in Ukraine. The missile finally landed within Japan\'s EEZ, which is technically not part of Japan\'s territory but was nonetheless seen as a provocation. North Korea is already under heavy UN and US sanctions but that hasn\'t stopped its ICBM launches. Japan, South Korea, and the US condemned the launch, though China remained silent.\n\n5. [Taliban fail to allow girls to return to schools](https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20220326-open-the-schools-afghan-women-protest-against-taliban-reversal-on-education)\n\nThe Taliban had set last Wednesday as the date for girls to return to schools (all-girls schools, obviously). However, within hours of the school day beginning, the Taliban\'s education ministry cancelled it, ordering all girls to return home. Girls were reported to have protested in Kabul, demanding that they be able to receive an education, but were quickly dispersed by Taliban fighters. No reason was given for the decision, and Afghan girls have been left without schooling for 7 months now. The US called off planned talks with the Taliban in Doha after the announcement. In their last stint of control, the Taliban has banned all girls from receiving any form of literacy at all. \n\n6. [Disastrous royal tour in the Caribbean ends](https://news.yahoo.com/prince-william-addresses-future-commonwealth-220058293.html)\n\nBritish royals Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton concluded their visit to the English-speaking Caribbean members of the Commonwealth, where Barbados recently decided to declare itself a republic and sever ties to the royal family. The current tour, aimed at assuaging similar sentiments in Jamaica, Belize, and the Bahamas, seems to have mostly failed to do that. All these countries continue to have Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state, but are demanding that Britain pay them reparations for slavery that brought Africans and Indians to their shores to work in inhuman conditions during colonialism. While the couple were met with smiling faces, they also faced protests and some blunt speak by the PM of Jamaica. The Duke of Cambridge expressed sorrow over Britain\'s history, but did not apologize or offer any reparations. The countries now seem determined to become republics. It may be noted that India was the first country in the Commonwealth to become a republic (Ireland never even joined), and the Commonwealth had to change its rules to allow India to remain in the group. India is today the largest member of the Commonwealth by population, GDP, and military size, and second-largest by land area after Canada.\n\n# Geopolitical History: The Children of Sykes-Picot Part 3: The Partition\n\n*This is the second part of a series discussing the history of the countries in the Middle East that were born of the Sykes-Picot pact.*\n\n[Part 1: Background](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sg001q/rindiaspeaks_biweekly_geopolitics_thread_nato/)\n\n[Part 2: The Arab Revolt](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/srsrha/rindiaspeaks_biweekly_geopolitics_thread_canada/)\n\nIn the previous parts, we saw that at the beginning of WW1, the Arab world was integrated into the Ottoman Empire, with Arab language and culture suppressed. Even attempts at democratic reforms within the Empire led to further sidelining of Arabs as Turkish nationalists gained the upper hand in the empire. However, with the outbreak of WW1, France and the UK built an alliance with the Arabs led by the Sharif of Mecca Hussain bin Ali to launch an Arab revolt, destroying the Ottoman Empire from within. They won - and Ali expected to be made king of a unified, independent Arab country. This country\'s borders need to be clearly understood: a vast majority of the Arab peninsula is a desert and sparsely populated by tribes and their chiefs, and while even these areas were to be incorporated into the Arab state, they were not really under consideration. Rather, it was the parts north of this - from modern-day Syria in the west to Iraq in the east - that were to be the main parts of the new state, along with the western part along the Red Sea.\n\nHowever, as early as 1916, the French and the British had already plotted to reverse their promise to Ali. They concluded a treaty, called the Sykes-Picot agreement, after the two diplomats Mark Sykes and Francois Georges-Picot, who led the secret negotiations. The treaty envisaged that the Arab lands north of the Arab peninsula would be partitioned into British- and French-controlled areas. If you look at the modern-day map of the region, you will see that Syria has a straight-line border in its east: this was the Sykes-Picot line. Everything west of that line would be French, and east and south British. Subsequently, Russia and Italy joined the agreement through additional treaties to gobble up Istanbul and Anatolia. The British area was most interesting, as it was to include the eastern part of the Arab peninsula along the Persian Gulf, but not the western part, the Hejaz, along the Red Sea. That part, which includes Mecca and Medina, was to be left as a rump state for Ali, far smaller than what he had envisaged. \n\nHowever, following the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in 1917, the secret agreement was made public even as Russia dropped its claims over the Ottoman Empire. The full text was printed in Russian newspapers. A great tussle followed, with US President Woodrow Wilson calling for all secret treaties to be suspended and for open negotiations to take place. Meanwhile, the British and French entered Damascus and setup a military occupation administration, with Ali\'s son Faisal also entering the city and declaring the formation of an independent, unified Arab state. There was a stalemate. To break this, the Paris Peace Conference was convened in 1919, where a system of "mandates" was conceived - a mandate area would be governed by the local people, but with the aid and consultation of the mandatory power, which would also control foreign and defense policy. The system was written into the Covenant of the League of Nations, but was broken before the ink even dried.\n\nThe French were the first to break their mandate obligations, taking full control of their mandate and deposing the Arab government led by Faisal. Meanwhile, in Iraq, the British tried to do the same thing but were met by stiff resistance in what is now called the Iraq revolt. Unlike the French however, the British used their old tool of divide and rule. Rather than continue to fight, which was a difficult proposition given that a new revolt in their crown jewel of India had sprung up, they partitioned their mandate into new countries. Ali, the Sharif of Mecca, was allowed to continue as the head of the Hejaz region (on the Red Sea), his sons Hussein and Faisal were made kings of Transjordan and Iraq, respectively, and the Nejd region (interior, desert parts of the peninsula) was placed under the control of the local tribal chief Abdul Aziz ibn Saud. All of these newly-created countries ceded their foreign and defense policy of Britain. \n\nBritain continued to control the trading port of Aden, and took direct control of Palestine where it sought to implement the Balfour Declaration and establish a new Jewish state. On the eastern coast, along the Persian Gulf, however, a different sort of agreement was reached to limit Persian influence. Rather than installing puppet governments, the British ceded genuine control to local tribal chiefs: seven of them in the so-called Trucial States, the al Khalifa royal family in Bahrain, the House of Thani in Qatar, and the Sultan of Muscat. Unlike in the western coast and the Levant, British interests in these areas was limited to exploitation of the newly-found commodity of crude oil, and were to be handled by the Governor-General of British India from Bombay. This was primarily because these areas severely lacked food and needed to import it from British India, setting up a comfortable relationship: food for oil. \n\nThus, five years after WW1, the Arab world was once again controlled by foreign powers. The Sykes-Picot agreement is seen as a turning point in the history of the region, a grand betrayal of the Sharif of Mecca and of the Arab people who had helped the western powers win their war. History did not end there, of course, with the new artificial borders creating new rivalries. The discovery of oil in the region further changed its history and the geopolitics of the world, whose effects can be felt to this day. In the following weeks, we will see how each of these countries developed over the next 100 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n *Have an interesting story from the world of geopolitics to share?
