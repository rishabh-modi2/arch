A $2 billion dollar house not very far from the slums\n\n2 ‘The City That Never Sleeps’.. I guess they didn’t know the name was already in use \n\n3. Film industry called ‘Bollywood’, yet another thing they ripped off from the US\n\n\nAnd I thought to myself why does every Positive Video / Content / Article about India has such hatred from other countries / races ? Do they not respect the enormous contribution of Hindus in Maths, Science, Architecture, Metallurgy, Medicine, etc. ? Are they not aware of the fact that we Hindus have been slave  for over 800 years ? \n\nWhy such hatred ? \n\nThen I watched another video about Trump Towers : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le2OF-oBUfM\n\nAnd the comments were very different, very positive. \n\nTrump has been bankrupt 6 times, openly boasted of 'grabbing pussy', has gold plated on his apartment+jet - similar to mindless middle-eastern dictators, was part of the mafia in the 80s, had multiple failed marriages where he had to import a submissive 'wife' from eastern europe, maybe russia has a video of him asking golden shower from a hooker, several sexual talks about his daughter ivanka, etc. \n\nNone of these vices are related to mukesh ambani. \n\nWhy is it that the rich in India are hated so much by foreigners ? \n\nThen I came back to toxic reddit. \n\nEvilBuildings is a subreddit which discusses the architecture of different buildings, in a light way calling them 'evil'.\n\nAntilia : https://old.reddit.com/r/evilbuildings/comments/66hmmt/antilia_in_mumbai_india_is_the_most_expensive/\n\nTrump Tower (I posted this yesterday) : https://old.reddit.com/r/evilbuildings/comments/cjvxf8/trump_tower_all_that_gold_inside_could_have_fed/\n\nNot one comment about trump tower criticised him / usa / christianity / rich people.

It's a better measure of the economic well-being of people of a country compared to GDP per capita. \n\nLook at how inflated Pakistan's figure is until 2010. I guess that's the benefit of being a US ally for so long, which quickly changed in 2009 when they found out that the ISI was in cahoots with Osama bin Laden. All countries that were allies with Uncle Sam in the last century benefited greatly. Pakistan even dared to go to war with India in 1999. \n\nI think this is one reason why Modi is so obsessed with making India a 5 trillion economy. Once India reaches 5 trillion, then it's probably like China when it reached that size, too powerful to mess with by any major world power, let alone a small regional power. At 5 trillion, US or China won't dare to use Pakistan as a hedge because India has enough money to equip themselves and do a lot of damage. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/jvijsjqctfc31.png"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'chmseg'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/chmseg/does_this_graph_surprise_you_as_an_indian/</li>

There won't be Himalayas, so the world will probably have about a billion people less in South and East Asia, who rely on the Himalayan rivers. That means South Asia itself would have a lot less people than it currently does.\n2. There won't be a significant monsoon due to the absence of a high Tibetan Plateau. I think India may geographically and geologically look like Australia reversed, with the center being dry and desolate. South India will have very thick tropical rainforest because its nearer to the Equator while northern coast will be more temperate. **Is there a geological expert in this subsection, who can confirm if my guess is true?**\n3. Demographically, Indians may look similar to Indonesians, basically more Mongoloid than Caucasoid. Austroasiatic &amp; Austronesian people, who are good at seas, would arrive at around 4000BCE and eventually dominate the island. Before that, the first African migrants may've arrived here during Ice Age, but remain in small numbers in the forest. There may be a significant Arab mix in the Northern coast, because of Arabic trade during the Medieval period. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/gqe5fn0p9fc31.png"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'chlyeg'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/chlyeg/in_an_alternate_history_if_the_indian_plate_didnt/</li>

Though people are getting aware about the social freedom and sexuality, but large part of our nation is still not changing fast enough. \nI think our youngsters are working hard and try to get settle before getting married. But because ppl wants to get settled the average marriage date is going way beyond or around 30 at least in cities. In those scenarios what about their sex life. I know as a country our main concerns are still roti, kapda, makan and internet. But I believe to life a healthy and fulfilling life these social concern should be dealt properly.

Allen of the [Center for a New American Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_a_New_American_Security),  "China’s leadership – including President Xi Jinping – believes that  being at the forefront in AI technology is critical to the future of  global military and economic power competition."[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_arms_race#cite_note-9)  Chinese military officials have said that their goal is to incorporate  commercial AI technology to "narrow the gap between the Chinese military  and global advanced powers."[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_arms_race#cite_note-10)  The close ties between Silicon Valley and China, and the open nature of  the American research community, has made the West\'s most advanced AI  technology easily available to China; in addition, Chinese industry has  numerous home-grown AI accomplishments of its own, such as [Baidu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu) passing a notable Chinese-language speech recognition capability benchmark in 2015.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_arms_race#cite_note-nytimes-11) As of 2017, Beijing\'s roadmap aims to create a $150 billion AI industry by 2030.[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_arms_race#cite_note-financial_times-12)  Before 2013, Chinese defense procurement was mainly restricted to a few  conglomerates; however, as of 2017, China often sources sensitive  emerging technology such as drones and artificial intelligence from  private start-up companies.[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_arms_race#cite_note-13) One Chinese state has pledged to invest $5 billion in AI.

Many point to a degeneration in organizational ethos. Until recently, ANI did not have a human-resources system. Many new journalists did not recieve offer letters, and face an arbitrary firing policy. According to a former employee, the security guard simply stops you at the gate, and no other warning is given for being  terminated. They also said that  “Because they get everything through jugaad, they don’t respect or value people working for them.” Another example is that of Vikram Bisht, a cameraman with ANI who was shot during the parliament attack in 2001 and died in 2003. Many colleagues of his said that ANI not only didn\'t support his family, but also called it \'unionbaazi\' when employees tried collecting some money for his family. There have been other instances where cameramen who have been injured or died while working for ANI are not shown due respect (for example, Brijesh Singh, and Prem Thakur). The employees are also not allowed to express their political opinions on social media platforms. A reporter also said that the recent rule of sending the reporter\'s location via WhatsApp everyday was an indication that they are not trusted. “It’s insulting. People have decided to quit because of that", said the reporter. \n\nRead more about this : [https://caravanmagazine.in/reportage/ani-reports-government-version-truth](https://caravanmagazine.in/reportage/ani-reports-government-version-truth)'<br />Author: 'businesspolitics'  id: 'chau0f'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/chau0f/how_does_the_asian_news_international_ani_treat/</li>

I studied in English medium and didn\'t study my mother tongue (Kannada) in school at all and I always felt disconnected from my roots. So I told my sister with some pride that I\'d read the first 100 pages of a rather difficult Kannada novel. She replied "I thought at least after going to Europe you\'ll become cool." It was half in jest, but she always says "chee" for any Kannada/Indian movie, songs, etc. \n\nNext I met an old friend and he was asking how my city is. He is Christian, so I was especially telling him about the amazing cathedrals and art and stuff, saying he would love it if he visited. Then we got talking about life in general, and he started saying I\'m lucky. I told him actually I just miss home a lot and it\'s not too great. He said yeah, sure, but you don\'t want to settle in this place (Bengaluru) do you? With lots of derision. And I simply don\'t get it - his family is so well to do and they\'ve lived a great life in this city. He has nothing to want for and he regularly goes for great holidays to Goa, Andaman, etc. All the things that he wants to complain about - traffic, filth, dust, poverty, everything is available in abundance also in Europe. Heck, the city I was in just had a strike by garbage-men because it is all controlled by the mafia and so the entire city was in a stench. \n\nThe third specimen is my friend there, in Europe, who is from Kerala. All he ever wants to do is bitch about India, among Indians and among Europeans also. And most of it is exaggeration - I don\'t mind honest criticism and we all know our country is far from perfect! But he is eager to do this. \n\nMy question is - what can we say that will make these people realise that our country is far from perfect but\n\na) We have it better than most\n\nb) Given what we started off with in 1947, we\'re doing AMAZING in almost every single field\n\nHow can we dialogue with people who want to EmIgRaTe? How can I speak about this to, for example, my sister.

So I recognize other perceptive people, by the symptoms they show. Trust me, Modi is the most perceptive person in politics I have seen. I see him operating people\'s minds like a pro gamer.\n\nRight now we all feel let down, each on our own expectations of him. But this is the right thing to do. The renaissance cannot depend on one man. After 2014, people were like we got Modi now, we can go now back. Now you are all taking things into your own hands because you feel there is no one there to do what needs to be done, as you should. Modi has done the right thing. Take it from me, when the time comes, he or his successor will come through in the best way. But we need to be doing our duty too.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to say I see a very perceptive person in Trump too. He passes himself as a fool, but he\'s just training people to ignore his criticisms by giving new bait everyday as that generates chaos everyday. And training the left to criticize anything he says regardless of content, making them look crazy. He didn\'t fulfill one of the big expectations people had of him like "drain the swamp". So people there are now asking questions, and taking things into their own hands (as they should). Although he\'s not on Modi\'s level, he\'ll be coming back too.\n\nEven CNN knows something is up: https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/25/opinions/michael-cohen-donald-trump-tape-strategy-zelizer/index.html\n\n----\n\nJust wanted to put it out there before I go (duty calls).

      <li>Title::: 'Anyone read the new book by Sanjoy Chakravorty: The Truth About Us: The Politics of Information from Manu to Modi?'<br />Body: 'In the book he shows how the social categories of religion and caste as they are perceived in modern-day India were developed during the British colonial rule, at a time when information was scarce and the colonizer\'s power over information was absolute. \n\nThe so-called four-fold hierarchy was also derived from the same Brahman texts. This system of categorisation was also textual or theoretical; it existed only in scrolls and had no relationship with the reality on the ground.\n\nThis became embarrassingly obvious from the first censuses in the late 1860s. The plan then was to fit all of the "Hindu" population into these four categories. But the bewildering variety of responses on caste identity from the population became impossible to fit neatly into colonial or Brahman theory. \n\nWR Cornish, who supervised census operations in the Madras Presidency in 1871, wrote that "… regarding the origin of caste we can place no reliance upon the statements made in the Hindu sacred writings. Whether there was ever a period in which the Hindus were composed of four classes is exceedingly doubtful".\n\nSimilarly, CF Magrath, leader and author of a monograph on the 1871 Bihar census, wrote, "that the now meaningless division into the four castes alleged to have been made by Manu should be put aside".\n\nAnthropologist Susan Bayly writes that "until well into the colonial period, much of the subcontinent was still populated by people for whom the formal distinctions of caste were of only limited importance, even in parts of the so-called Hindu heartland… The institutions and beliefs which are now often described as the elements of traditional caste were only just taking shape as recently as the early 18th Century". \n\nThe pre-colonial written record in royal court documents and traveller accounts studied by professional historians and philologists like Nicholas Dirks, GS Ghurye, Richard Eaton, David Shulman and Cynthia Talbot show little or no mention of caste.\n\nSocial identities were constantly malleable. "Slaves" and "menials" and "merchants" became kings; farmers became soldiers, and soldiers became farmers; one\'s social identity could be changed as easily as moving from one village to another; there is little evidence of systematic and widespread caste oppression or mass conversion to Islam as a result of it.\n\n**All the available evidence calls for a fundamental re-imagination of social identity in pre-colonial India.**\n\nThe picture that one should see is of astonishing diversity. What the colonisers did through their reading of the "sacred" texts and the institution of the census was to try to frame all of that diversity through alien categorical systems of religion, race, caste and tribe. The census was used to simplify - categorise and define - what was barely understood by the colonisers using a convenient ideology and absurd (and shifting) methodology.'<br />Author: 'dhatura'  id: 'cg86sp'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cg86sp/anyone_read_the_new_book_by_sanjoy_chakravorty/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How to manage grief?'<br />Body: "I am the old user shrama_ji_ki_beti and deleted my account just 3-4 days ago to be more productive IRL.\n\nA senior of mind committed suicide and now idk how to process it. I had worked in a group last year. I found the environment absolutely toxic and suffocating with very little to non existent personal space. This guy worked in the same group as me. While I was the youngest member of the group, he was second youngest. I always disliked him. I wasn't ever mean to him but just that he was so well adjusted to that environment that I blamed him and other seniors for creating this environment. If the seniors had established firm boundaries and not spoiled the expectations of team leaders we wouldn't have been expected to live like that. This senior guy worked 7 days a week, he would come around 9-10 in morning and stay till 8-9 at night includine weekends sometimes even till 10 pm. He hardly took half hr off for lunch and you would never see him wasting time on YouTube etc. He was always emotionally calm. I usually have emotional reactions to seeing an act of injustice being done but he didn't care about what happens to those around him. He was self centered in that way. Deep down I was envious of him for having adjusted so well to the world and thus being really productive, never losing sleep over issues which didn't affect him directly. While I was exactly opposite of that.\n\nFew days back he committed suicide. His suicide letter is just the way he was calm, rational. It showed no sign of stress, depression, anger, frustration, no one is blamed or praised. He just said I think it's good time to end my life. Thanked everyone who touched his life and that's all. \n\nEveryone around me is dealing with this sudden shock in their own ways. A day before I came to know of this I had fallen sick with fever. So now I am stuck on bed, thinking about him. To destress myself I can't even go for running/ swimming because I have fever. I can't sleep. I keep thinking about him. Its been almost 48 hrs and I have barely slept. I feel suffocated and can't help but wonder how much did that toxic environment contribute. How much were team leaders responsible for it. How they drove me too to months of sickness. \n\nI just don't know how to process it. I am just so angry and sad at the same time. I am just so angry that those sinister psychopaths who stressed me enough that I was bedridden and they might have been partly responsible for This too and they will get away unscathed. \n\nJust to clarify I don't feel guilty because I saw him only once briefly in past one year and I am not suicidal either. I am just losing my mind. I am also emotionally guarded person so idk who to share it with.  My mother knows a few good therapist/ psychiatrists in Jaipur so I can see them if the need be. \n\nI posted this here to maybe get some advise from more mature, senior members of the community. How would you have dealt with it?"<br />Author: 'sharma_ji_ki_betii'  id: 'cfmu6f'<br />Score:25<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cfmu6f/how_to_manage_grief/</li>

I connected to them through social media and the compnay is from a different state than me. They did not provide good service and even even failed to fulfill their certain condition which in turn made it elibligable to claim refund. Now, I went to consumer court, tried cyber crime department, police department and all the possible ways to get my refund but there is no result. When I approached one of the well known advocate of my city he advised me not go the judiciary way. In India, (Civil) decisions are so prolonged that it is really of no use. As it is said that justice delayed is justice denied. There are numerous cases where someone has illegally occupied somebody else's property and the case it going on for years. So imagine the cost of property is 1 million and to get the occupancy you need to invest 25 thousand it's a good deal. Now you can invest 50 thousand every year to prolong the case. It is quite cheaper than actually renting the property. Secondly the owner has to also bear the same cost just to fight back or else in most of the cases people prefer not to fight and give away such property."<br />Author: 'Hellow__Sir'  id: 'cfmbl5'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cfmbl5/indian_judiciary_boon_or_curse/</li>

None of the Government seems to take any action against them, instead of noticing them burning public transport, uprooting rail tracks, creating traffic Jams and many more things. This is just an example, I also have been noticing minority reservation. At one point we call ourself "SECULAR Country" then why the hell we do reservation on the name of the minority? Are these people not able to overcome their poverty, not litteracy, backwardness? Then the Government of India has made many schemes, but in the name of minority, it does not make any point to just give emphasis on Muslims. Practically minority category belongs to those religions which are very handfull. Then who says Muslims are a handful? There are other religions also like Christians, Sikhs,  Buddhism, Jain and some other. Then why does not Government talk about them? Just for the sake of votes, Muslims are given much importance over Hindus and even those other religious people who share a very less ratio to Hindu people.'<br />Author: 'ravikant99business'  id: 'cfjq1f'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cfjq1f/when_are_we_going_to_see_india_with_no/</li>

Even if you're irrational and let them know you will never attack, if your attacker is rational they will continue to attack because it gives them what they want (dominance).

Yes. Fishing.\n\nIn the west, certain parks and lakes prohibit \'proper\' fishing, to aid in conservation and prevent overfishing. However "catch and release" fishing is allowed, and is used by sport-fishermen and anglers.\n\nSimilarly, in Pakistan, it is prohibited to harm the big fish of terror. Only "catch and release" is allowed as a sporting activity, to aid in conservation of terror, and generate revenue. Loans that are never repaid are revenue, right? Anyway. This frequently takes place when the international community is watching. There is little local passion for the dog and pony show ^(*[but let us not confuse our metaphors]*), because terror-fishing in Pakistan is largely a spectator sport, mainly catering to foreigners who are enthralled by the elaborate ritual. \n\nHowever, in certain incidents over the past few years, some tourists have violated these rather strict prohibitions, and broken the unspoken rules binding the sport. \n\nOne such widely publicized incident was when a rather big and rare, critically endangered fish - indeed, a protected specimen - was killed by a group of American tourists on a fishing expedition, in [Abbottabad](https://i.imgur.com/7J34WQb.png). There was widespread outrage in Pakistan at the incident. The big fish was given a sea-burial to quell the outrage.\n\nMore recently, a group of Indian tourists made a brief visit to Pakistan and ended up killing a lot of fish using a similar technique called surgical fishing. The fish were not "big" fish, nor were they particularly endangered, but the high number of fish killed, threatened the delicate ecosystem and put the entire species at risk of overfishing. This received extreme criticism and anger from both, the Pakistani and Indian terror-conservationists.\n\nDespite this, just a few months prior, there was a *second* such deplorable incident, where *another* group of Indian tourists used the highly controversial and unethical technique of "blast fishing" (which uses a shockwave to render all the fish in the vicinity dead). This is not only considered inhumane, and unsporting, but also a terrible practice in general, as it eliminates hundreds of terror-fish in an instant. There are reports suggesting that over 300 fish were turned into bloody pulp within seconds, and that an entire school of fish was wiped out by the Indian tourists. However the Pakistani government intervened and shielded the tourists from further outrage by burying the news of the incident and claiming that only some trees were damaged and that the tourists had missed the school of terror-fish entirely, and that all the little terror-fish were safe and sound (although nobody has strangely seen them since). Once again, many terror-conservationists and terror-humanitarians within India cried foul at the incident.

As i wanted answers from Indians.\nI boarded my train from Delhi in the morning. I was going to Mumbai with my father for his regular medical checkup. I saw a girl already sitting on lower birth. I sit on the same birth my father sat on front birth. I didn\'t had even a eye contact with her for first two hours. After that some casual conversation started between me, my father and her. My father is recovering from Cancer treatment so she was also taking interest in story of my father\'s fight with cancer. I and she was also talking to each other occassionally and little bit eye contact was there. She told us that she want to work in Bollywood and is working there to achieve her goal.\nAfter sometime we all were silent. So I thought to spent some time on window of train looking outside. I told my father that I am going outside and started moving. From behind I heard that she was also saying that I also want to spent some time outside. I stood on window and found that she was standing behind me, from here our conversation started. The conversation was about like social issues, knowing each others backgrounds. Then we sat on the window ( maintaining a gap between us) and further converse for around one hour. I found out the she was an open minded girl and a nice human being from her conversation. After that we went inside and she started having food she shared some food with me and my father. After that my father went to sleep on upper birth leaving me and her sitting down there.\nI and she again went outside and sit on the same window. This time the conversation was like she was saying look at the moon how beautiful it is. The air is so good. We should sit here whole night( I didn\'t feel that safe). After sitting there for  two hours we decided to went inside and sleep.\nNext morning we woke up when train was just about to reach Mumbai. We didn\'t had any conversation in train. After deboarding the the train we shaked hand( that was nice feeling). Suddenly my father asked her if she can give her number ( I wasn\'t expecting that). She give her number and said " please call uncle, if you need any help. I said take care and started moving in opposite directions.\nAfter reaching my room in mumbai  I found her on facebook and and her number was also on WhatsApp. From her posts I also found her that she has worked in a small budget reality show.\n    So, till now two days have spent I haven\'t contacted her neither on whatsapp nor on facebook. I am little bit confused that, was she really interested in me or that was just normal for her. I like her and will be ready for further talking with her. \nGuys please guide me that what should I do now.\nAnd please Ignore my grammatical or other errors as I am not good in English.'<br />Author: 'himalayan_bear'  id: 'ceozzf'<br />Score:51<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ceozzf/met_a_girl_on_delhi_mumbai_train/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Is the rule of the BJP good for the Indian economy? by Balaji Visvanathan'<br />Body: 'In terms of economy BJP has increasingly turned socialist and has thus become an average — like the previous governments, rather than hitting the ball out of the park. The first budget of Modi 2.0 has been quite disappointing. While their social schemes have been quite good, these welfare schemes have to be paid by the large businesses. And the government has not been paying attention to them.\n\nI get that we need to build toilets and give out LPG cylinders. But, is that an excuse for not speeding up the economic reforms and unlock key investments? When are we going to bring key major foreign investments in retail, aviation, agriculture and other key sectors?\n\nWith the opposition decimated, this is the best time to bring bold new reforms. I expected the victorious Modi in second term to bring out the long awaited reforms that unshackled China in the 1980s. It is one thing to engage in welfare politics before the elections, but now that it is won and no major state elections are near, what is the excuse for going slow?\n\nThere has not been big bang reforms and economic reforms are getting as bad as past Congress governments. Even basic things like selling Air India and BSNL is taking far too long.\n\nThe NPA mess that UPA 1 created are yet to be cleaned off. There is no nationwide urgency to clean the banks and no public recognition of the dire crisis.\n\nThere are no big reforms in land and labour — two chains that shackle Indian businesses. There is no big push for exports — although we make in India, we have never seen any benefit to that. There are no new cities built — the smart cities have neither been smart nor been cities.\n\nWe expected the former Gujarat CM to replicate his magic at the centre. Rather it is increasingly looking like Congress [just more efficient &amp; less corrupt] — more on welfare politics and less on capitalism.\n\nLet Amit Shah keep working on his realpolitik, but Modi needs to come out and go big bang on issues of real substance. That is the only way to make history.\n\nIf you are hitting singles when the asking rate needs boundaries, public is going to be angered. Both in cricket and politics, our idols are not going to be spared. If you don’t take right kind of risks at the right time, you risk losing everything. Just as Dhoni [who cleared the team of old timers when he took over] found out, BJP has to realise that the same forces that sent them up, can also bring them down. Ultimately most of us BJP supporters are more loyal to the country than to the party and will have to make hard choices if things don’t improve soon.\n\nIt is not a sin being a suit boot sarkar and unleash the pent up market forces. That is the only way to become a $5 trillion economy in the near future.'<br />Author: 'indra_sword_rises'  id: 'cenqqb'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cenqqb/is_the_rule_of_the_bjp_good_for_the_indian/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Richa Bharti asked a question. I didn't see anyone trying to answer it. Let's do that (repost)."<br />Body: 'Per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism), \n&gt; Terrorism is, in the broadest sense, the use of intentionally indiscriminate violence as a means to create terror among masses of people; or fear to achieve a religious or political aim.\n\nLet\'s see:\n\n&gt;(24:55) Allah has promised those among you who believe, and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the earth...\n\nAnd what counts as righteous? Certainly violence in the "cause" of Allah is more righteous than non-violence:\n\n&gt;(4:95) - Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame, etc.), and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home)...\n\nAnd what is the "cause" of Allah for which Muslims are encouraged to fight? Fight till only Muslims remain:\n\n&gt;(8:12) (Remember) when your Lord inspired the angels... "I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them"\n\n&gt;(8:39) And fight with them until there is no more fitna (disorder, unbelief) and religion is all for Allah\n\nIn this matter, don\'t listen to your conscience, for Allah knows best:\n\n&gt;(2:216) Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.\n\nAnd what to do when you encounter peaceful Gandhians? Don\'t show mercy otherwise Allah will be angry with you:\n\n&gt;(8:15-16) O ye who believe! When ye meet those who disbelieve in battle, turn not your backs to them. Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless maneuvering for battle or intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah...\n\nAnd what about those Muslims who are "liberal"? Per the Hadith, they are hypocrites:\n\n&gt;(20:4696) the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: \'One who died but did not fight in the way of Allah nor did he express any desire (or determination) for Jihad died the death of a hypocrite.\'\n\nAnd what to do with hypocrites:\n\n&gt;(33:60-62) If the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease (evil desire for adultery, etc.), and those who spread false news among the people in Al-Madinah, cease not, We shall certainly let you overpower them, then they will not be able to stay in it as your neighbors but a little while Accursed, wherever found, they shall be seized and killed with a (terrible) slaughter.\n\nExcept the one Hadith verse, the rest are from Quran, and cannot be changed for the word of our Allah is perfect.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nEDIT: Treatment of female captives:\n\n&gt;(4:24) And \\[also prohibited to you are all\\] married women except those your right hands possess. \\[This is\\] the decree of Allah upon you. And lawful to you are \\[all others\\] beyond these, \\[provided\\] that you seek them \\[in marriage\\] with \\[gifts from\\] your property, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse...\n\nNote "unlawful sexual intercourse" is only prohibited for "all others beyond these" (i.e. beyond the ones your right hand possesses). Hence, rape is not prohibited for female slaves.\n\nNo need pull out either according to the Prophet (Allah\'s Messenger), even if it reduces the price of the slave (due to pregnancy) since those who Allah desires to be born will anyway be born:\n\n&gt;(Bukhari 34:432) O Allah\'s Apostle! We get female captives as our share of booty, and we are interested in their prices, what is your opinion about coitus interruptus?"  The Prophet said, "Do you really do that? It is better for you not to do it.

In the Mahabharata, Arjuna has to choose between following the commands of his brother Yudhishtra, the king and saving Draupadi.

Similarly, Gandhari, who is enraged at Lord Krishna, and even though she knows he is an avatar of Vishnu,  **curses him. Her curse comes true and Krishna's successors kill themselves in an angry brawl. This shows that not even the Gods are above being held accountable.**\n3. Arjuna, Drona and Ashwathhama\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo if I go by this description Indian culture is all about using your brain and realizing that hard lines are impossible to draw.

The government will hunt them down and throw them into the sea, he thunders. Unfortunately, it is not just the standard bluster from a nativist politician railing against illegal immigration. Last year bureaucrats in the Indian state of Assam, which has a population of about 33m people, produced a list of more than 4m of its residents whom they consider foreigners, without any right to live there.

      <li>Title::: 'Answer to why India cant develop advanced processors even with all its IT talent and what it can do'<br />Body: "Microprocessor development has two components to them 1. Micro-architecture design 2. Process Node\n\nLet me compare this to you building a house. So you go to the architect and ask for designs about how the building has to be designed, whats the hall size, how many rooms, how do you move around the house etc. Similarly, the microacrhitecure design is the same, how do I handle the addition, multiplication, how do I schedule the operations, what other mathematical operations can I support. The problem with architecture design is, its very difficult but doable. Companies need at-least 4-5 generations and iterations to nail the perfect design because it is so complex that finding problems, developing efficient solutions is a continuous process. The brighter side, this is entirely theoretical and can be done with our excellent set of engineers and research institutes at our disposal. Just the government should fund them for a sustained period of 10 years atleast to come up with a world class microarchitecture.\n\nProcess Node is the transistor size you are going to use to make this chip. Smaller the transistor, lesser your power consumption and faster the processor is going to be. So its measured in micro-meters and nano-meters. Having your processor design on bleeding edge process node or smaller process node helps you to get more performance out of your chip. TSMC has 7nm process node, Samsung recently developer Extreme-UltraViolet 7nm, Intel is struggling with 10nm, Global Foundaries(outsourced node from IBM) is stuck at 14nm. In comparison the last time I heard, the government's fabrication unit in Chandigarh uses 65 nm/micrometer process node which is 3 generations behind. Hence, even though your microacrhitecure design would be really good, the process node hampers you. Take AMD from 2008-2015 for ex, they had a really advanced microacrhitecure design but were hampered by process node which was stuck at 28nm, and Intel at the other end, even with small improvements in their microacrhitecure design outcompeted AMD with better process node of 22 nm. So why cant India develop mature and bleeding edge process node? Capital. A lot of money is required just to build these plants. Atleast $10-15 billion, and even if you pump that money, the plant should be utlised by all the companies to make sure it hits 100% utilization. And every 3-4 years companies around the world research newer process nodes, so your plant will be out-of-date within 5 years max and companies want more performance so they may move away from your plant and thereby not really 100% utilization. And we really dont have the infrastructure or the huge government funding to research bleeding edge process nodes.\n\nHence, even if you start on a war footing today, we would have to invest around $30 billion dollars to establish a bleeding edge plant, create a matured architectural design, and make sure they are utilized by the population at large so the next iteration can be funded. So give or take another 5-7 years to get all of this up and running.\n\nWhat the government is doing is exactly correct, target the smaller appliances like Navic and pass the technology unto other startup companies and once the companies are big (jio, airtel, wipro, infy), incentivize them to move their manufacturing and process node technology to India (preferably to a place with plenty of fresh water since these plants require a humongous amounts of them, so possibly north India which gets to benefit from the jobs and make sure the south Indian states get the majority of the research funding to develop the microarchitecure), next phase would be to conquer the storage (hard disk, usb, set-top box) market, then memory and finally high-performance processor market. So we started pretty late, but we can only do so much right now and we are moving in the right direction slowly, and if you want India to accelerate, well throw money at the problem and get it solved. But hardware is basically a commodity at this point and not really profitable, hence these shakti and ajit processors are very good for defense and if made cheaper, can be freaking really good for consumers too.\n\nAs of today, we are seeing some very good traction from IIT Bombay and IIT Madras with their Ajit and Shakti processor. Im expecting other premier research institutes and engineering colleges around the country coming up with their own variants and researching advanced microarchitecture topics and more research funded ones like IISc and IITs researching the process node technologies. With some government push, we can conquer the small-scale processor market which forms around half the appliances. \n\nCurrently we are on the cusp of a new phase in electronics where the process node technology has stalled. Quantum effects have come into picture and companies around the world are not able to push beyond 7 or 5nm technology. So there is only one way to go and that is the microacrhitecure design. There is plenty of low-hanging fruits of research that can be obtained from parallel programming. If the government can fund research grants for these and make IIT/IISc a central nodal agency to co-ordinate the efforts, we might as well make the next gen processor with radically new design architecure rather than play catch up with the current designs, we can leapfrog Chinese, European and American efforts on this front. \n\nFor context, the Chinese are funding three companies to come up with the Sugon (AMD derivative with Chinese addon) and WuDaoKao designs that are aimed at reaching extreme level of performance. American efforts are focused on funding Nvidia, Intel, AMD and HP to come up with next generation exaflop level systems. Europeans have launched EPI (European Processor Initiative) that aims to build an ARM cpu that can be targeted at various sectors like automotive self-driving (BMW, Audi), Space (Airbus, EADS) and even consumer electronics (Orange, Sky, Nokia) etc. The Indian companies are not of the same size but our IT companies can band their resources together and create a fledgling processor market combined with governmental purchase guarantess, then sky is the limit since our market is so huge. Ofcourse the first step should be from the government since Private companies shy away from such long-term endeavours. All the efforts are going to take atleast 5-7 years for maturity, hence, we need to start now. Contact your nearest public representative, send emails and tweet about these initiatives to make sure the government hears about this and spread the word. We are primed to take this oppurtunity and we can with a little nudge.\n\nJai Hind!"<br />Author: 'kamasutra971'  id: 'cdfya7'<br />Score:121<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cdfya7/answer_to_why_india_cant_develop_advanced/</li>

[Pakistan loses $6 bn Reko Diq case](https://www.dawn.com/news/1493967)\n\nThe government of Pakistan lost a long-running dispute at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), a constituent of the World Bank Group, against the Tethyan Copper Company (TCC) to develop the Reko Diq gold and copper mines in Balochistan. The company had completed a feasibility study and was granted a license in 2010, but in Nov 2011, the provincial government suddenly denied a license to its local subsidiary, bringing the project to a standstill and initiating arbitration proceedings. There have been rumours that the Pakistan Army, which has vast commercial dealings in the country, wanted to develop the mines itself and hence blocked the license. The arbitrators came back with a 700-page ruling, where it awarded TCC $4 bn in damages and $2 bn in interest. The Pakistani government has yet to make an official statement on this. \n\n2.

British Royal Marines boarded the tanker, Grace 1, and detained its entire crew as they were making their way to Syria. Iran denies this and has condemned the UK government for what it says is an illegal detention, threatening a BP oil tanker in the Persian Gulf that is currently stuck off Saudi territorial waters, unable to reach its destination in Iraq.

[Turkey takes delivery of S-400 system](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/12/741068857/turkey-accepts-russian-s-400-missile-system-rankling-u-s-and-nato)\n\nThe first deliveries of the S-400 missile defense system that Turkey bought for $2.5 bn from Russia were delivered on Friday, escalating tensions between the country and the rest of the NATO alliance. In response, NATO is expected to bar Turkey from using the F-35 fighter jet. NATO in concerned that advanced radar data from the systems could be sent back to Russia, effectively creating a mole within NATO (of which Turkey is a member). Turkey claims that it was forced to purchased the S-400 after the US withdrew the Patriot missile system from the country because of hostilities with US-allied Kurdish forces in the fight against ISIS. Turkey views the Kurdish forces as terrorists themselves. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The 1936 Olympics\n\nSports and politics have often been intertwined. Some would even say that international sport is war by other means. Who can forget the tension during India-Pakistan cricket matches, or football games between Germany and France? Wild fans who put tremendous pressure on their side, not to mention the rioting and behaviour often seen in England after football games, make international sport seem quite war-like indeed. But we live in a more peaceful world today, where people can have their fifteen minutes of "war" and go home. The world was not always so peaceful. \n\nIn 1936, three years after Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany, the XI Olympic Games were held in Berlin (it was awarded to Berlin before Hitler rose to power). It was a big moment for the Nazi government, which had broken provisions of the Treaty of Versailles and rebuilt the country\'s economy, and was hungry to show off its new-found prosperity and its "superior" way of life. There was much talk of boycotting the games in many countries as well, not least because the Nazi government had banned German Jews and Romas from participating in them, and was strongly discouraging other countries from sending any Jews as well. \n\nOn Aug 1, 1936, the Olympic Torch arrived at the new stadium in Berlin. The torch itself was a new tradition of the modern Olympics that remains alive to this day, invented by the Nazis as a means to popularize the games. The torch had been relayed from Greece to Germany, crossing seven countries, all of which would be occupied by Germany within the decade. Berlin had been sanitized of overt anti-Jewish laws and signs, and even Africans (who were considered as subhuman by Nazis and were discriminated against in America as well) were treated well. \n\nEspecially one of them: Jesse Owens, the African-American athlete who took home four gold medals (100 m, 200 m, long jump, and 4x100m relay) and, in the process, discredited Hitler\'s Aryan supremacy theory. In the midst of German athletes winning the most medals and celebrating it by saluting Hitler, the scenes of Owens saluting the American flag instead are remembered to this day. As is the fact that Owens was not called to the White House by Roosevelt, who ignored him completely. But despite this setback, the 1936 Olympics were a massive propaganda victory for the Nazis, giving them the confidence they needed to deal with the world in the years to come after they took complete control of Germany. \n\nAnd what confidence they had. The International Olympic Committee was so pleased with the Games that Germany was to host the 1940 Winter games as well after two cities pulled out. Eventually, those games never happened after Hitler invaded Poland and set off World War II, and the 1944 Olympics in London were also cancelled. In Hitler\'s march through Europe, among the millions of Jews killed by his genocidal regime were 11 athletes who had participated in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat stories from the world caught your attention?\n\n वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्'<br />Author: 'icecoolsushobhan'  id: 'cd8hr3'<br />Score:61<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cd8hr3/biweekly_geopolitics_thread_pak_loses_6_bn/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Maruti was crony capitalism 101 - read on about how Maruti was born.'<br />Body: "An older post of mine, reproduced here.\n\nall starts with Maa ka Ladla, Sanjay aka Sterilization king Gandhi returning back home from a 3 year internship stint at Rolls Royce in the UK. Even this must have been only because of Maa ka influence because, in keeping with family tradition he never completed college. In case you are wondering, Indira, Sanjay, Rajiv, Sonia all at some point in their life joined some college or uni, but never completed it. In Rajiv and Sanjay's case, they just sucked at studies. Indira, was supposedly a very good student, but ill health came in her way. Anyways, moving back to the topic, Sanjay bhaiya returns from the UK, all full of ideas for a People's Car!\n\nNow, the small hitch is, Indira had pretty much nationalised everything, and the few private companies left, like Hindustan automobiles or Premier automobiles or even Bajaj of the Chetak fame had stringent licensing norms, and buying even a chetak meant at least a year in queue after paying the money...if you were lucky. No matter, what Ladla wants, he gets.\n\nIn 1971, with ZERO experience in this field, no degree, no nothing, the GoI awarded a contract to this unknown entity to produce 50k cars (when even as late as 1991, India had a total car sales of some 100,000, in the 70's, this was around 30k units per year). No tender, no competition...nothing! Cronyism max...and it is just the start.\n\nThe moment this was done, everybody had to fall head over heels to satisfy the Prince. So, the Congress CM of Haryana promptly offered all the land the Prince wanted. But it was in a sad place in Haryana...our Prince had his eyes set on prime farm land and land belonging to the ordinance factory....Land Acquisition bill you say? Naw, rules didn't apply to his empress son. Land was acquired at dirt cheap prices, the army made to give up its land and the factory was put up.\n\nNow, they offered a prototype for testing...it failed all the tests, but no matter, safety mafety....the contract was upheld!\n\nBad? It gets worse.\n\nIndustrialists were literally extorted into buying shares of this company...if you didn't, you had family members thrown into jail till you paid up. Listing rules for the share market were outright broken to allow special provisions to this company. If you had applied to be a dealer, you were shit out of luck as you were threatened to buy shares (literally using goons and threat of violence) in the company...or else. Even if you were not applying to be a dealer, you were fucked. Some random guy, applying with the Harayana Govt to buy some land...was told that he had to buy shares in the company, or kiss his licenses good bye...he got the shares!\n\nBusinessmen who complained...including to the then Minister of state for finance, our Hon President Mr Mukherjee (who did nothing) were then arrested under various acts, including the infamous MISA. Yes, if you protested, you saw jail time bitch!\n\nCement, Iron and Steel procured to build the complex (strict quotas were in place for anybody without the Gandhi surname) were then promptly resold in the market for a profit, and more quotas kept getting alloted to this company.\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg. Many share holders listed never existed, huge monies were laundered through this sham of a company, many of Sanjay Gandhi's official documentation and requests were never dated or signed. Minutes of shareholder meets either were manipulated or didn't exist at all....it boggles the mind what the Gandhi family could do and still can tbh in its solo, singleminded quest for power and money.\n\nAfter the Janata Gov took power, they rightfully scrapped this company, established a commission, whose report you can read here.\n\nThis is why when Rahul Gandhi or his supporters talk about crony capitalism, I launch a full blown belly laugh! Indira, Sanjay, Rajiv (our man was the lead negotiator for an aircraft fighter deal...talk about being brazen), Sonia (Augusta) are all the biggest crony capitalists of them all."<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'cd3nmz'<br />Score:92<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cd3nmz/maruti_was_crony_capitalism_101_read_on_about_how/</li>

The racism leading to all this is clear, and the idea of "finding things out" is hazy, and veers between the ideas of feeding into colonialism and "nationalism" or more aptly "fascism". You get punished for thinking differently than white people, and calling it racism, when literally everything about this "Hindu nationalism" perspective has been drenched in racism, and colonial propaganda in the past and people know if anyone bothered to see the moments leading up to this. Those "scholars" label anything as Hindu nationalism, which somehow completely ignores history and is the most horrific bullshit there is. Not North Indian nationalism, no examination of "white supremacy", only scolding indian people for straying away from some theories, despite everything being drenched in racism against India in history. It actually annoys the shit out of me when white people use "supremacist politics" as a reason to discredit someone publicly, when the only "supremacy" in India has been revival of Hinduism and recovering the identity of India by decolonisation. The horrific amount of racism the other way is just a "myth according to the examination of white people. That people could be affected by it is just "unscholarly" or something. They seem to have such a one dimensional "Hindu oppression" view of Hinduism and nationalism in the context of our nation and wield it whenever possible when we are hardly the oppressors. They won\'t acknowledge the supreme racism against Indians leading up to the Hindu revival and appreciation of Hinduism and India and it seems people have completely forgotten the effects of colonial hangover with the effects of racism, when they are apt points for discussion. But if an indian says anything other than what white people say, they\'re just being "Hindu nationalists". What about the fight for decolonisation. Yet they are so sure that Hindu scholars are fascists. People don\'t even try to research on the effects of white supremacy. The racism and literal building of the "fascist Hindu nationalist" theory can be seen more clearly than anything else. There is not one drop of concern among Indians of racism against darker people in South India/Dravidians etc, their sympathies only lie with what white people say. Shouldn\'t there be more focus on racism towards darker people instead of "you\'re just trying to look good, lol stop trying to find things about your country". Indians suddenly just became "Hindu nationalists" when that narrative would be ego lifting for the British. Yet those liberal white "researchers" seem to forget all rigor and common sense when the biggest shift in politics in this mess came from fucking white fucking supremacy. So it would be fucking good if these little piggies should acknowledge this instead of the cop out of Hindu nationalist calling.\n\nHoly fuck.'<br />Author: 'gotisbadaha'  id: 'cca6nn'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cca6nn/about_the_political_aryan_invasion_theory/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'How much the British made on irrigation channels in Madras Presidency, how they were genocidal and other sundry items. We were just giant dollar signs as far they were concerned'<br />Body: 'As a part of my ongoing research on British era famines, and in particular the Madras Famine, I chanced on this very interesting report. Titled - Report from the Select Committee on East India (Public Works) it also appends a detailed series of MoM of this committee. Source - https://dspace.gipe.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10973/21407, the larger 42 MB file is the report and the MoM. This report is chilling in how the British Raj saw India and Indians – as assets only fit to be milked for revenue and profits. In this report for a start, the council is very upset that revenues and revenue growth from irrigation channels was slowing down. Clearly, the parsimonious British even expected revenues from public goods such as irrigation channels  nothing in the Raj was done without considering profit, INCLUDING building of basic infrastructure. This esteemed council spends so much time and effort grieving over how revenues from irrigation channels was not meeting projections. \n\nIt is telling that when they are talking about investing in a very dry part of India (the Sirhind canal) the reasoning is not in how it will improve livelihood but on how it won’t give any returns. Pp 14 is telling,  the chairman asks what the intention of the GoI is to in prosecuting some key works, the answer? Leave them as they are and only go bit by bit. Note that at this point, a large component of these expenditures went to English companies in the first place, so the expenses these  Raj administrators are anguishing over was money taken from India, to pay English companies to create infrastructure that would benefit British companies, but even this was too much for them. PP 14 (end) &amp; 15 are chilling.  These cold bureaucrats discussing the Orissa Canal. Line number 254 talks about how this was very useful as it saved ‘half a million pound of crops’ in the previous Orissa famine.  Chairman though is not happy and insists on wanting to know the revenues it was bringing in. 1 MILLION Indians died in this very same famine, yet this number is not even a footnote to be discussed, it was all about the profits, crops saved and money made (or saved)! How different is this from the Wannsee conference where German bureaucrats in a similar cold.\n\nIt would be pertinent to point out now that the GoI charged poor peasants money to access these irrigation canals as was being discussed in pp 16, point 265 where the Chairman notes with great disappointment that the people of Orissa refused to pay money &amp; use these services. That is one source of revenue, the second is the nominal profits made from dry (pre irrigated) to wet (post irrigated) lands. Pp 16 points 270-72 gives a very interesting read on the British mind. Here they discuss how a dam was built on the Coleroon &amp; the older Chola  built dam at Kalanai. The Chairman insists on knowing on IF the Raj had to build the second dam also, how much would it have cost and thus how much the Raj saved (nominal saving). Opportunity costs of something built a 1000 years ago are somehow relevant to these clerks and the answer becomes coldly clear! The Interest to be charged on the principle was on 230,000 GBP – 1,34,000 GBP on the British constructed dam + and GET THIS 1,00,000 on a dam constructed in 100 BCE by a Chola Emperor! \n\nYES, the BRITISH considered the capital cost of a for then 2,000 old dam and charged the people of India interest for it. Pp 18 line 304 explains very clearly the extent of pre British Indian irrigation planning and works (copy paste so all errors in spelling are replicated)\n\n&gt; Perhaps you WIll do well to explain to the CommIttee somethmg of the nature of those tank works, "hICh are hIstorIcally of great Interest JD IndIa, are they not?-They are formed by throwlJlg daDlB, generally earthen dams, across valleys,. and so arrestmg the water and retamlD" It until required fOl lrllgatlOn. Small channefs are led from the tank above the dam, whICh tra- verse the country, whIch •• commanded by the water, and so enable crops to be produced. In many cases the valleys are dammed With several dams In succeO!SlOn, from near the head of the valley, at intervals uf one or two or three mIles, accordmg to Circumstances, and each tank has its irflgatlOn channels led from these dams. In former years those tanks in dIfferent parls of IndIa were very abundant, were they not ?-There are an enormous number of them In the Madras PreSIdency In the tract, which is coloured blue au the map.\n\n\nNow let us look at how much the British spent and how much the earned. Total Capital expenditure (one time expense) for irrigation in Madras presidency in 1887 was GBP 29,07,000. The annual revenues were 13,80,000 or 45% returns ANNUALLY approx. Let me repeat, a large part of the capital expenses went to British firms and the money also came from taxing Indians, in essence Britain was making 13.8 Mn GBP on just irrigation channels annually on a zero investment of British capital. According to the BoE inflation calculator, 14mn in 1887 is equal to 160 Mn GBP today! Assuming the same rate of returns and adjusting for inflation annually, the British made the equivalent of $ 7.5 Bn from the irrigation networks of just one presidency! At ZERO COST to the British Crown. This excludes hidden costs – costs of labour of natives (which was exploited at near slavery rates), the costs of export of cash crops all of which would far exceed the capital costs. What makes the whole thing so inhumane was\n\nThe meetings were taking place when the Great Madras Famine was raging and by then no less than 1.5-2 mn Indians had perished! Yes the discuss this and other famines but purely in numbers. Look at pp 10, line 160 where the talk of the Orissa famine (1mn dead) and how it positively impacted railway revenues! These genocidal maniacs see a famine and then look at how good it was for railway revenues!!! Maniacs! Pp 29 / 556 again talks of a bonanza year for the revenues of the railways thanks to a famine in which only a holocaust’s worth Indians perished. pp 36 / 669, despite being hit with one of the worst famines in human history, ‘market forces always at play’, freight rates were reduced pre famine to push traffic but during the famine? No, we don’t do that. I must point out at this point that the rail network was used during famines to push surplus to granaries and then exported out. pp 47 / 871 this is particularly cold blooded and genocidal. Mr John Cross asks if the expenditure on irrigation channels would be more than the costs of the famine (5.5 Mn – 15 mn deaths). Pat comes the answer that we could cover India with channels but it would cost more than the famine, they continue that in Bihar (no deaths because of good relief works) if they had spent on irrigation, famine relief costs could have been averted. Pp75/ 1127 is telling and an answer to ‘how much money British made in India’. Just their surplus revenues for the years 73 to 76 is the equivalent of 700 Mn. Per year Britain was making $ 250-300 mn in just budgetary surplus. Excluding entirely the costs of raw materials exported, the revenues accruing from banning Indian production and making India a captive market for their products or the ‘loans’ they took from time to time or the billing of the princely states for administrative expenses etc etc. \n\nThis calm, rational discussion is the equivalent of the Wannsee conference of the Nazis. It exposes clearly the genocidal mindset of the administrators. Just like how Nazi planners saw Jews and Slavs as abstract concepts with a value attached to them, not even the deaths of 10 mn Indians in famines moved these accountants here. It was all about profits.'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'cc98re'<br />Score:52<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cc98re/how_much_the_british_made_on_irrigation_channels/</li>

Let us examine the two main aspects of this allegation: his view on race, and his actual record in World War 2.\n\nSavarkar on race\n\nIt is undeniable that Hindu Maha Sabha ideologue Savarkar spoke of reviving the "race spirit" of the Hindus. So did Golwalkar. Sri Aurobindo even used the term "Aryan race", which to him meant exactly the same thing as "Hindu nation",\xa0�and Sri Aurobindo was one of the most outspoken enemies of Hitler in India, supporting all-out involvement in the British war effort. But their reading of the term "race" was radically different from Hitler\'s. Not that it was in any way exceptional: Savarkar\'s interpretation of the term was the standard usage in the English-speaking world, while Hitler\'s usage was innovative.\n\nIt is not sufficiently realized today that before Auschwitz gave a bad name to the term "race", forcing it back into the strictest use as a biological term, it used to have a broader and hazier meaning, roughly as a synonym of "nation", but sometimes ranging from "species" to "family",\xa0�\xa0exactly like the Sanskrit word jati. In actual usage, "race" implied an element of identitarian continuity, but not necessarily biological continuity. As late as 1947, British sources spoke of Hindus and Muslims not as contending religions but as "the two races of India", though they knew fully well that these were not separate biological races, most Indian Muslims being the progeny of converts from Hinduism.\n\nAfter 1945, the English language gradually lost the usage of the term "race" for the concept of "nation"; the Hindu nationalists followed suit. This was only natural: they had never cared for "race" in the biological sense so dear to the Nazis. The very concept of race, having been narrowed down to its biological meaning, has simply disappeared from their horizon. It is plainly untrue that Hindu ideologues at any time have shared Hitler\'s racism.\n\nThe point is made in the most straightforward terms by Savarkar himself: "After all there is throughout this world so far as man is concerned but a single race\xa0�\xa0the human race, kept alive by one common blood, the human blood. All other talk is at best provisional, a makeshift and only relatively true. Nature is constantly trying to overthrow the artificial barriers you raise between race and race. To try to prevent the commingling of blood is to build on sand. Sexual attraction has proved more powerful than all the commands of all the prophets put together. Even as it is, not even the aborigines of the Andamans are without some sprinkling of the so-called Aryan blood in their veins and vice-versa. Truly speaking all that one can claim is that one has the blood of all mankind in one\'s veins. The fundamental unity of man from pole to pole is true, all else only relatively so." (Hindutva, p.90) This is the diametrically opposite of any "pure race" theory.\n\nMost secularists pretend not to know this unambiguous position of Savarkar\'s (in many cases, they really don\'t know, for Hindu-baiting is usually done without reference to primary sources). Likewise, Savarkar\'s plea for caste intermarriage to promote the oneness of Hindu society is usually ignored in order to keep up the pretence that he was a reactionary on caste, an "upper-caste racist" (as Gyan Pandey puts it), and what not. There are no limits to secularist dishonesty, and so we are glad to find at least one voice in their crowd which does acknowledge these positions of Savarkar\'s.\n\nAn Indo-Australian philosophy professor, Purushottam Bilimoria ("Hindu perception of Muslims in India: from Savarkar\'s ascendancy genealogy to the Bhavishya Hindujativad",\xa0International Conference on New Perspectives on Vedic &amp; Ancient Indian Civilization, LA 7-9 August 1998), has given a hostile but undeniably original and thoughtful interpretation of Savarkar\'s views. He comments on Savarkar\'s\xa0Hindutva: "Two things stand out oddly in this proclamation:\n\n(i). the difficulty of linking the modern Hindu with the erstwhile Aryan stock\xa0�\xa0so a theory of descendance does not hold firm;\n\n(ii). if all people (other than the tribal and indigenous peoples) are immigrants to the provinces of the subcontinent, then how can they claim to be the authentic inheritors of the mantle of the civil nation?"\n\nThe first point rightly acknowledges that Savarkar, not being a historian, accepted the Aryan invasion theory promoted by prestigious seats of Western learning; and that he saw modern Hindus as a biological and cultural mixture of Aryan invaders and indigenous non-Aryans. He shared this view with Indian authors across the political spectrum, e.g. with Jawaharlal Nehru. Like Nehru, he saw no reason why people of diverse biological origins would be unable to form a united nation; the difference being that Nehru saw this unification as a project just started ("India, a nation in the making"), while Savarkar believed that this unification had come about in the distant past already. At any rate, this is an excellent non-racist position, contrasting sharply with the then-common view that upper castes were Aryan invaders, a nation separate on biological grounds from the lower castes who were native. Savarkar\'s was an eminently reasonable interpretation of the Aryan invasion theory, viz. that in spite of divergent biological origins, people who live together end up mixing both culturally and biologically, and that this was not a problematic phenomenon as the Nazi race-purifiers thought, but a natural process and one which had happened to generate the Hindu nation.\n\nIn the second point, Bilimoria loses sight of the first, and lapses into the racist and non-Savarkarite view of distinct biological identities of the "tribal and indigenous peoples" and the rest, presumably the upper castes. Savarkar did not think that Hindus or anyone for that matter would lose their entitledness to membership of the nation just because some (or even all) of their ancestors had immigrated four thousand years ago. Only the anti-Brahmin Dravidian racists and tribal-hunting Christian missionaries could have come up with such a ludicrous idea. Like so many Hindutva spokesmen, Savarkar often gave the example of the assimilation of the Shaka and Huna invaders into the Hindu nation; foreign geographical provenance was not his problem. The view which Bilimoria ascribes to Savarkar here is just a straw man, unrelated to Savarkar\'s actual position.\n\nBilimoria claims to have found a "tacit commitment to a racialization doctrine which underpins the further moves Savarkar and the religious-political movements that grow out of this ideology (which have come to power in recent days in India)". The term "tacit" gives the game away: plenty of Hindutva-watching "analysis" consists in nothing but divining hidden motives and "tacit commitments" unrelated to the actual programmes and manifestoes which exist in cold print but remain unread by the supposed experts.\n\nNevertheless, let us read on: to Bilimoria, the Hindu nationalism ideology focused not on the inherited race, which is a mixed affair, but on "a future race-to-be, the spiritual blood once purified, rather than the racial lineage we can trace our blood directly to, which has all but been sullied and become impure through intermixing and mingling of disparate cultures. Now a race carved out along these lines can mean that others who do not fall within these descriptors have to be left out, and we can only speak of them as bearers of their own downward conditions, their victimhood, their otherness. This has been one reason why communalism has reached perilous dimensions in India, why the Hindu Right campaign for Uniform Civil Codes, and why there is global expression of fear and rivalry between the two groups across the \'garami hawa\' borderzone."\n\nIt is rank nonsense that the BJP position on a Common Civil Code (which is simply the implementation of the principle of equality before the law deemed essential to the very idea of a secular state) is based on a "racialization" doctrine: no BJP or related document even thinks of the Hindu-Muslim problem in terms of race, and if it did, its choice for a legal unification of Hindu and Muslim communities would obviously go against their "racial" separateness. And no Hindu wants to keep the Muslims out, the way racists want to keep members of other races out, on the contrary: every Hindu activists hopes that the Indian Muslims will return to the Hindu fold.\n\nHowever, Bilimoria has a point when he implies that Savarkar\'s policy of caste intermarriage would further the process of biological homogenization of the Hindu nation. But so what? Should he have opposed caste mixing instead? Then he would have been decried as a reactionary "upper-caste racist" and what not. But now that he takes the opposite position, it is still not good: now he is a "future-Hindu-racist", a kind of mad scientist brewing a new race in his lab, the caste-mixed Hindu-race-to-be. This is just another case of secularist justice: Hindu are damned if they do, damned if they don\'t.\n\nSavarkar and Nazi collaboration\n\nNicholas Goodrick-Clarke has written a book on the strange case of a French-Greek lady who converted to Hinduism and later went on to work for the neo-Nazi cause, Maximiani Portas a.k.a. Savitri Devi. The book is generally of high scholarly quality and full of interesting detail, but when it comes to Indian politics, the author is woefully misinformed by his less than impartisan sources. He squarely places himself outside the scholarly community and inside the Indian Marxist propaganda machine by asserting the following howler: "After the German invasion of Prague in March 1939, Indian opinion on Germany polarized sharply into two camps: those who would be loyal to Britain in the event of a war between Britain and Germany and those who would not. The Hindu Mahasabha adopted a particularly strong pro-German position, assuming a close congruence between the Aryan cult of Nazism and Hindu nationalism." (Hitler\'s Priestess, New York University Press 1998, p.66)\n\nTo say that, faced with the choice of being loyal to Britain in her war with Germany, the Hindu Mahasabha took "a particularly strong pro-German position", is the diametrical opposite of the truth. It is quite simply a lie. I am not saying that it is Goodrick-Clarke\'s lie, he may naively have copied it from partisan sources, of which there is no dearth in Indian academe nor in the Indian Studies departments in the West. But if he had done his research well, he could not have failed to come across one of the central facts of World War 2 in India: that the Hindu Mahasabha actively campaigned to recruit Hindu young men into the British war effort. Congress activists used to scold HMS president V.D. Savarkar as a "recruiting officer", for it was Congress which refused to stand by the British, at least until 1944.\n\nIf one is inclined towards fascism, and one has the good fortune to live at the very moment of fascism\'s apogee, it seems logical that one would seize the opportunity and join hands with fascism while the time is right. Conversely, if one has the opportunity to join hands with fascism but refrains from doing so, this is a strong indication that one is not that "fascist" after all. Many Hindu leaders and thinkers were sufficiently aware of the world situation in the second quarter of the twentieth century; what was their position vis-a-vis the Axis powers?\n\nFor their own reasons, Hindu and Muslim masses were very enthusiastic about Hitler. The Muslim League frequently compared its own plan of Partition with the Partition which Germany imposed on Czechoslovakia (the ethnic reunification of the Sudeten Germans with the Reich Germans was in fact deemed logical and fair by most observers, including Savarkar, though in contrast with the League he did not support the imperialistic methods used by Germany). Congress leftist Subhash Chandra Bose formed Indian battalions in the German and later in the Japanese army. The Congress leadership was utterly confused and took just about every possible position in succession or even at the same time.\n\nIn these conditions, the foremost Hindu leader of the time, Swatantryaveer Savarkar, refused to support the Axis and advocated a massive enlistment of Hindus in the British army. The point is proven even by the very nadir of the Hindu Mahasabha\'s history, viz. the murder of Mahatma Gandhi by its activist Nathuram Godse: of the seven conspirators, three had served in the British-Indian Army during the war. Savarkar calculated that massive Hindu enlistment in the war effort would provide a winning combination in the war. And indeed, in the successful retreat from Dunkirk and in the British victories in North Africa and Iraq, Indian troops played a decisive role. It would earn the Hindus the gratitude of the British, or at least their respect. And if not that, it would instill the beginnings of fear in the minds of the British rulers: it would offer military training and experience to the Hindus, on a scale where the British could not hope to contain an eventual rebellion in the ranks. After the war, even without having to organize an army of their own, they would find themselves in a position where the British could not refuse them their independence.\n\nIt is in this context that in 1940, Savarkar launched his slogan: "Hinduize all politics, militarize Hindudom." This slogan is nowadays often quoted out of context to impute to Savarkar a fascist-like fascination with "war for war\'s sake". But it meant nothing of the kind. He wanted Hindus to get military experience for a specific purpose, viz. that after the war, England would find a vast number of combat-ready Indian troops before her. More than a preparation for war, this combat-readiness was the right preparation for a peaceful showdown, in which the British would be made to understand that fighting was useless, that the Indian march to independence had become unstoppable.\n\nThis much has to be said in favour of Savarkar\'s strategy: it worked. It is a matter of solid history that the new military equation of 1945 was one of the decisive considerations in Britain\'s decision to decolonize India. With the military experience and capability now possessed by vast numbers of Indians, a British reassertion of colonial authority would have required an immeasurable investment of troops and money of which a war-weary Britain was no longer capable.\n\nIt is not unreasonable to suggest that Savarkar\'s collaboration with the British against the Axis was opportunistic. He was not in favour of any foreign power, be it Britain, the US, the Soviet Union, Japan or Germany. He simply chose the course of action that seemed the most useful for the Hindu nation. But the point is: he could have opted for collaboration with the Axis, he could have calculated that a Hindu-Japanese combine would be unbeatable, he could even have given his ideological support to the Axis, but he did not. The foremost Hindutva ideologue, president of what was then the foremost political Hindu organization, supported the Allied war effort against the Axis.\n\nIt must also be noted that Savarkar never went as far in his cooperation with the British as the Communists who supported the British (after they became a Soviet ally in 1941) by betraying Congress "Quit India" activists to them. While the Communists were Soviet loyalists who saw Indian opponents to the war effort as simply their enemies, Savarkar was an Indian patriot who differed with the Gandhian patriots (as with Bose) regarding the means but agreed with them on the goal, viz. India\'s independence, and therefore left them to their own designs without interfering.\n\nSavarkar\'s deputy on fascism\n\nThat HMS support to the anti-Nazi war effort was not merely tactical but to quite an extent also ideological, is shown by a series of statements by Nirmal Chandra Chatterjee, president of the Bengal Hindu Mahasabha and vice-president of the All-India Hindu Mahasabha. He declared in February 1941: "Our passionate adherence to democracy and freedom is based on the spiritual recognition of the Divinity of man. We are not only not communal but we are nationalists and democrats. The Anti-Fascist Front must extend from the English Channel to the Bay of Bengal." (Hindu Politics, Calcutta 1945, p.13)\n\nHe too had taken the habit of loosely labelling hostile forces as "fascist", e.g. in his opposition to a 1939 Muslim League proposal to communalize the municipal elections in Calcutta: "We must resist these reactionary measures which are founded on the principle of communal Fascism." (Hindu Politics, p.21; note how back then words hadn\'t lost their meaning yet, so that "communalism" was identified with Muslim League politics, not with its opponents). He also compared them to the Norwegian Nazi collaborator Quisling: "Political Misfits are as dangerous as Quislings." (Hindu Politics, p.25) More substantially, he called the threat of a Japanese conquest "the direct calamity that can befall Bengal". (Hindu Politics, p.25)\n\nAll this is hardly the language of a collaborator with the Axis powers. For anyone still in doubt on the Hindu Mahasabha\'s position, he declared in March 1942: "In the conflict of ideologies the Hindus have made their position perfectly clear. We hate Nazism and Fascism. We are the enemies of Hitler and Mussolini. We are longing and struggling for our own emancipation and we want to repel any dictator who would try to reduce sections of humanity to slavery to serve the whims of his own megalomania." (Hindu Politics, p.26) And in December 1943: "We are wholeheartedly anti-Fascist. Every anti-Imperialist must be anti-Fascist." (Hindu Politics, p.68)\n\nHis problem with the British was not that they were defending democracy worldwide, but that they were compromising with anti-democratic tendencies within their own Indian domains, particularly with the Muslim League\'s insatiable hunger for communal privileges. When the Cripps mission was announced (exploring an agreement with Congress to get India more actively into the war effort in exchange for promises of more autonomy), Chatterjee declared: "We shall suspend judgment unless we know what exactly he has to offer and we only wish that artificial minority problems will not be exploited to dilute democracy and to injure Hindu interests." The Hindu Mahasabha was, after all, in favour of undiluted democracy: "Our main plank is Veer Savarkar\'s message which he preached at the Calcutta session: \'Equal rights for all citizens and protection of the culture and religion of every minority\'." (Hindu Politics, p.74)\n\nYet, the British accused the Freedom Movement, including the HMS but also the Congress, of Nazi sympathies. Already in the 1930s, they had sometimes equated no less a person than Mahatma Gandhi with Hitler (a comparison which made Gandhian Congress activists feel proud). That was the only way they could hope to lessen the sympathy of the increasingly influential American public opinion for the Indian anti-colonial struggle. Against this colonial propaganda, Nirmal Chandra Chatterjee replied in November 1943: "The Hindus in this supreme crisis of humanity never wanted to shirk the responsibility to fight the Axis powers. Our leaders took a realistic view of the political situation. Veer Savarkar\'s clarion call to the Hindus had met with a ready response and the Hindu boys had rushed forward and joined up in thousands. On every front our boys have demonstrated their valour and discipline, and the African Campaign, if faithfully recorded, will put the Indian in the forefront of the noble heroes who decimated the Fascist [hordes]." (Hindu Politics, p.55-56)\n\nAnd in November 1944: "It is the subtle scheme of political propaganda to describe the Hindu as pro-Fascist. It is a cruel calumny which has been spread in America and other countries. The Hindu Mahasabha stood for Savarkar\'s policy of militarization and industrialization. We recognized that Fascism was a supreme menace to what is good and noble in our civilization. Due to Veer Savarkar\'s call thousands of young men joined the Army and Navy and Air Force and shed their blood for resisting Nazi tyranny and for real friendship with China and Russia. But as the Hindus had the temerity to ask for National Independence and took the lead in rejecting the Cripps offer, they were maligned and the subtle forces of organized British propaganda were let loose to blackmail the Hindus." (Hindu Politics, p.103) The current tendency to accuse the Hindu movement for cultural decolonization of India of "fascism" is nothing but a replay of an old colonial tactic.'<br />Author: 'assortedpartypoppers'  id: 'cbupws'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cbupws/was_veer_sarvarkar_a_nazi/</li>

And many of these are even outdated. \n\nThe government needs to welcome and request foreign  companies to set manufacturing plants in India by providing them a transparent system, resources, and if required any exemptions under \'Make In India\' initiative.\n\nThe goal is to provide jobs for Indian engineers in these fields which will encourage new engineers to maybe take initiative to set new Indian companies.\n\nThe electrical Industry us even worse. If Electrical Vehicle Industry is in the same situation for the next few years, All the Tier 1 cities will reach a new high in pollution levels. Look at China, currently at 2nd position rapidly accelerating in EV business. Top most position in manufacturing large EV\'s (busses). China has set various air cleaners all over their Tier 1 cities, which is purifying air instantaneously. \n\nSomething huge needs to happen in the next 5 years. Startups on large EV\'s (busses) should be encouraged. Ask foreign companies to make electric busses and vehicles in India. Companies such as Tesla should be brought in. Provide Tesla with all the Tax exemptions and whatever else that they require to setup a manufacturing plant. By 2030, all the cars that will be manufactured should be electric.

Why so serious? I\'m just here for the memes!**\nDesi Twitter is perfect for you. Just watch out for the Nazi\'s. Twitter loves Nazi\'s.\n\n**2. You\'re anti-foreigner. Facebook is just a company.**\nFacebook is an American company. They are like an American Aadhar, but far worse. Aadhar leaks your private data by mistake. Facebook _sells_ it on purpose. Just like oil companies and big banks extracting value from the country, but don\'t return value to the community.\n\n**3. Just don\'t use Facebook.**\nYou can\'t solve a problem by doing nothing, can you? So there needs to be an alternative. Change demands action.\n\n**3. It\'s impossible. Impossible. Don\'t even try.**\nIndia sent a satellite to Mars [for ten times _less_ than what it cost America to do the same](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29341850). Keep the "impossible" talk to yourself, please. :)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# **Free Speech is Under Attack in India**\n\nDid you know that, so far just in 2019, the government has:\n\n- [Sent politicians to jail for criticising PM Modi](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/southasia/2019/01/indian-politician-jailed-facebook-post-pm-narendra-modi-190128131746935.html)\n\n- [Proposed China-style internet censorship](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/technology/india-internet-censorship.html)\n\n- [Begun a crackdown on e-commerce and free speech in India](https://www.wired.com/story/india-is-cracking-down-ecommerce-free-speech/)\n\n---\n\nSo I want your help. I\'ve poured a year of my life into helping create an alternative. It\'s not a "Facebook killer". The purpose is not to eat the world as a giant corporation. The goals are:\n\n- teach about _privacy in action_ and help reverse the idea that "privacy is dead" (it\'s not unless we let it die -- this is a choice, not fate) \n- protect our communities from misinformation and propaganda\n- encourage free speech, not violent hate speech (World War II answered the questions about Nazi\'s and fascists already)\n\nI want your help to build a community for and by its members. Not only as passive "consumers". If we can create a community that succeeds in _doing_ what the government _says_ it wants to do, everyone wins.\n\n**Isn\'t it a perfect first step as a community** -- to translate the site from English into Hindi/Urdu, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil and Gujarati?\n\nWe can be a model for the rest of the world. Right now, aside from the United States, Brasil is the other major country where free speech is under attack from their president/dictator, Jair Bolsonaro. India and Brasil are places where this project can have most effect, because it is a matter of life and death now -- not just funny memes and empty comments.\n\nThe new site is online, and we need our first members. PM me or comment if you want to join, or help translate, or have other ideas. Bring a friend! We can save our privacy and community from Silicon Valley, to create a better choice for ourselves and the world.\n\nThe first goal is ambitious -- 1,000 members by the end of this month. With over a billion people of Indian culture around the world, I think this is far modest than sending a satellite to Mars. :) Our future is up to us, not Silicon Valley. So let\'s build it together, starting right now.\n\nP.S. If you have skills -- programming, design, web security, or you are in India and want to spread the word, these are things we need as well.

They say the way the Sangh treats minorities like the Muslims/lower castes is similar to how the white people treat the blacks and the Mexicans.   \n  \nThat is only somewhat true. Actually Muslims have not been facing historical injustices in India because they quite literally ruled over many parts in India for hundreds of years, during which time they tried to remove India\'s Hindu identity. \n\nAccording to liberal ideology, the group that has had the dominant power over the past is to blame for the injustices then and should make amends today. That is why they believe that blacks cant be racist to whites, because there is no power behind the racism. That is why they believe sexism from the female side has no meaning because men hold all the power anyway and have held it. As a centrist I try to understand all this but it becomes difficult, but I digress.  \n\nThat is why I agree that lower castes have been fucked over repeatedly but not Muslims, not all the time. And because lower castes have been fucked is why we have caste reservations. What is the idea behind caste based reservations? It is an attempt to correct the historical injustices done to lower castes by upper castes by giving them some way to be more "equal" in society today. It has its downsides but that is the motivation. \n\nOnly recently lives of some Muslims has become harder but the comparison made by liberals to say Sangh and Nazis are same is very incorrect. Because most Hindus in India have never historically oppressed most Muslims over centuries and centuries, the opposite happened. Muslim dynasties, empires and kingdoms are proof of this. Recent behavior by Sangh nothwitstanding, liberals should not try to have the cake and eat it too when talking about how caste reservations are justified and also how Sangh hostility and distrust towards Islam is unjustified.'<br />Author: '40ml'  id: 'cawit0'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cawit0/a_thought_i_had/</li>

I just saw a post with monitor lizard and remembered about it.\n\n Lastly, please don\'t fall for this type of nonsense from pandits and babas. keeping, suggesting or selling hathajodi is a criminal offence so if some shopkeepers/pandit/baba suggested you such a thing, report them to your nearest police station.

      <li>Title::: 'Our Whole taxation system is flawed. If you start following every damn rule in the book it will be impossible to run the business.'<br />Body: 'Our whole Taxation sysyem is flawed. Even worse is the current GST introduced. You litrally cannot follow every thing written in the book. You just can\'t theres always this provision and that provision which is *broken* by you in doing business. How to address this issue when it comes to the notice of the oficer? By corruption of course. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts also inconsisten as Fuck. Tell you an example. Under Income tax laws u / s 44AD, you don\'t not need to maintain any books of record except sales record  to declare 8% income and pay income tax. Its called presumptive taxation. Business having turnover upto 2 cr can show 8% of income as tax and have to keep record of only sales. Seems fair as business is small and it is undue burden to keep books of accounts as record.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnder gst which the  Same business has to registered as his sale is above 40L will have to maintain records of Stocks, purchases, Credit notes, debit notes, advances, payments, names and address of suppliers and customers, e way bills,  log of every entry correction, deletion , etc is to be maintained. And this has to be maintained for a period of **SIX YEARS.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow i ask you, If i am running a business, will I do the business first or play accounting all day? I undertand purchase records to be maintained as we are taking tax credit but whats the need for other unneccasry things? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, say it\'s year June 2022, you are in your shop doing business as usual, you can receive a letter for GST Department saying bring all above records and more for the period of Financial Year 2018-19 to GST Department because officer wants to "Check" something. I ask you what will be your reponse. And somehow you find all the require documents and officer will still harrass you for random zealous provison which you \'broke\' . In the end you\'ll have to "settle" the dispute.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Quantum of settlement will depend upon audacity of your "breach" of provision, mood of officer and some luck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nALL OFFICERS FROM BOTTOM CLERK TO TOP OFFICER OF YOUR CITY ARE CORRUPT. EVERYONE OF THEM HAS DONE CORRUPTION ONE WAY ORTHE OTHER. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI said example of GST but same is true of ITD, in fact IT people have more power. Hence are even more harder to "settle".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end the you just have kill your conscience and settle it. You can always have option of appeal but that\'s even more time consuming and expensive and many businesses don\'t prefer it, and damn revenue officers know that. Hence the harrasment...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd listen to me while I say this, There is no more flawed law than GST. It\'s a goldmine for Officers. Especially in small cities.

Students say they do not find time even to sleep well. While studying full time there, he acted and directed in several classic plays by Ayn Rand, Badal Sarkar, Vijay Tendulkar, Mohan Rakesh, Eugene Ionesco etc. These plays were opened to the public in general, and received media coverage.\n\n  \n\n\nShortlisted for Aditya V Birla Scholarship at IIM-A.

When I went through PrashantAdvait Foundation\'s website, it aptly described the mission as: "Creation of New Humanity through Intelligent Spirituality".\n\n  \n\n\nWhen one goes through his YouTube Channels or reads his Books, or get a blessed opportunity to be in his presence, they usually don\'t have any idea of the amazing and overwhelming journey of his life.\n\n  \n\n\nThe list of achievements and accomplishments he has is something that most of the us can just dream about, and yet, after doing all of it, he has been working towards his mission silently and incessantly.\n\n  \n\n\nNot only he is traveling to different parts of the country every month to come in contact with more and more seekers, but his presence on the Internet has revolutionized the way we interact with the world.\n\n  \n\n\nIt\'s not just about entertainment, it\'s not just about posting your cheesy pics from the last vacation, but much more than that, helping people to ease off, open up and really understand the substance of their lives better.'<br />Author: 'ArmanoKiArthi'  id: 'cany3w'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cany3w/one_of_the_most_underrated_hindu/</li>

In return they get to have greater say over their budget, fiscal policy and legitimacy for other loans (which is probably good for pakistan in the long run)  \n\n\n&gt; A senior government official told *Dawn* that beginning this year Pakistan will receive a total of $6bn in about three years ending 2021-22 from the IMF, while it has to repay about $4.355bn in four years ending 2022-23, showing net receipts of $1.65bn. \n\n \n\n&gt;Pakistan will receive $2.3bn during the current fiscal year, followed by $1.847bn next year (2020-21) and $1.847bn in 2021-22. During the current fiscal year, Pakistan has to make repayments of $1.045bn, followed by $1.167bn in 2020-21 and $1.06bn in 2021-22. This means the net inflows will amount to $1.26bn during the current fiscal year, followed by $680m next year and $786m in 2021-22.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In contrast, there will be no inflows from the IMF during the fiscal year 2022-23, but $1.08bn repayments to the Fund will be due that year. After accounting for $532m repayments last fiscal year and due until 2022-23, Pakistan’s inflows from the Fund will be $6bn against the outflows of $4.9bn, meaning net inflows of just $1.1bn over the five-year period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n&gt;However, the programme is expected, in the words of the IMF, “to coalesce broader support from multilateral and bilateral creditors in excess of $38 billion, which is crucial for Pakistan to meet its large financing needs in the coming years”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This will include about $8.7bn project loans, $4.2bn programme loans (mostly from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank), about $14bn of rollover loans (from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, China, Qatar and Islamic Development Bank) and up to $8bn in commercial loans. This will also include borrowing from the international capital market at least $1bn per annum.\n\n  \n\n\nIndia has 2.44 % shareholding in the IMF\n\n&gt; India’s current quota in the IMF is SDR (Special Drawing Rights) 5,821.5 million, making it the 13th largest quota holding country at IMF and giving it shareholdings of 2.44%. However, based on voting share, India (together with its constituency countries Viz. Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka) is ranked 17th in the list of 24 constituencies at the Executive Board  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  As part of the Fourteenth General Review of Quotas (2010, India’s total quota has been increased to SDR 13,114.4 million from SDR 5821.5 million. With this increase, India’s share would increase to 2.75 % (from 2.44%), making it the 8th largest quota holding country in the IMF.'<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'cai56d'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cai56d/pakistan_to_get_165bn_net_receipts_out_of_6bn_imf/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Is this the best time in India to make social-reforms on matters of caste?'<br />Body: "In no other known period of history have the various Hindu castes consolidated around one political entity. It's not perfect, as caste is still is a major political factor in many states. But I think the BJP and RSS has the best shot right now, to achieve their **'One nation, One culture**' goal; basically to unify the various Hindu factions into one large and indivisible community of over a billion people, similar to the Han Chinese. \n\nBelow are some ideas that could possibly help India move in that direction:\n\n1. Affirmative action in favor of lower castes &amp; tribes has obviously helped to create a class of successful people among these communities. Unfortunately it has also created resentment among the upper castes. This doesn't help at all because instead of trying to make people forget caste, these policies made caste more entrenched. So for example, a certain company may exercise preferential treatment when it comes to employment or promotion and the employer would say it's justified because the lower caste have an advantage in the public sector. **Therefore, all forms of government assistance, on the basis of caste, need to be gradually phased out. Its better to help based on how poor a family or village is.** \n2. **Hindu temples need a major reform**, not just on matters of caste, but also gender. I see no excuse in the modern day to exclude non-Brahmins and women from becoming priests. Non-Brahmins are just as capable to become scholars in the religious field while women today are just as 'clean' as men, thanks to technology. There's no other way of creating a united community, if some members are excluded in any or all professions. I think BJP has the best shot at convincing major temples to reform, and Hindus won't be suspicious of their motives.\n3.  **Caste-neutral family names need to be encouraged**. The goal is to completely eliminate the caste factor in people's everyday lives. People can easily tell a person's caste based on his/her name, and this impacts a lot of things, eg. call for interview. Intercaste marriages also need to be encouraged. Perhaps a policy that incentivizes people who made these sorts of transformation would work. \n4. **At some point, minority religions need to be treated like separate castes**. Because that's how they behave anyway, judging by how they're supportive of members of their own community and exclusionary towards outsiders. In some ways, the largest caste in India can be said to be the 'Muslim caste'. There's no other choice but to eventually assimilate them with the majority, not by force but by encouragement. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'c9uyp3'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c9uyp3/is_this_the_best_time_in_india_to_make/</li>
      <li>Title::: '"Those who violate this temple shall incur the sin of having slaughtered tawny cows and Brahmans on the banks of the Ganges" - Domlur Temple, BLR circa 1270 AD'<br />Body: 'A few years ago, I had a problem with my landlords and ended up in an OYO bang in the middle of Domlur, Bangalore for a few days. There was a temple a stone\'s throw from the OYO.\n\nEvery morning, I was woken up by the very pleasant aarti sounds coming from the temple around 6:30-7 ish. There was a stone pillar in the temple\'s courtyard which seemed ancient. My only takeaway from the short stay was mild annoyance early morning and the realization that a pillar somewhat indicates the center of a village / settlement in south India (in Bangalore at least). In the north, the perimeter of the village was delineated by trishuls dug in the ground. There\'s no pillar concept, none that I\'m aware of.\n\nToday I was thinking about visiting either the Bull Temple in Basavanagudi or Gavi Gangadhareshwara in Lalbagh so I researched this temple as well. Link -&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domlur_Chokkanathaswamy_temple\n\nApparently, there\'s a Tamil inscription in the temple premises which says:\n\n&gt; Those who violate this temple shall incur the sin of having slaughtered tawny cows and Brahmans on the banks of the Ganges\n\nAncient Bharata was a cultural continuum. It was one nation - by all definitions of a "nation". So the next time some librandu tells you the Brits unified Bharat, shove this nice, hard stone inscription up their arse'<br />Author: 'ektharki'  id: 'c9ufnx'<br />Score:41<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c9ufnx/those_who_violate_this_temple_shall_incur_the_sin/</li>

It doesn't matter.\n\nIt's a significant change for Hindus and other dharmic faiths. Because it doesn't matter whether she is opportunist or not. But it's a very clear indication of Hindu uprising the fact that demonizing Hindus doesn't sell anymore. She and most other politicians who intend to stay in politics have realised it. It doesn't matter whether urmila matolkar actually meant that Hindus are most violent. We will never know what these people actually adhere to in real life. Urmila matolkar thought demonizing Hindus will get her votes. So many leftists thought hating Indian army and making anti India statements, pro muslim statements will get them votes and that's what they did. That's what they had been doing and were voted in power again and again. \n\nRejoice right wingers! We have made it clear no more demonizing Hindus, no more anti India statements will be tolerated by common Indian. Some of the intelligent politicians seems to have got the message. Rest will follow soon if you stick to it. \n\nLastly I don't think most politicians have any religion except politics. Remember when mamata Banerjee threw tantrums protesting against illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in parliament. Did you see how she encouraged blatant illegals immigrants and turned to Muslim appeasement because that's where she found a solid voterbase. Tomorrow modi might do the same if we fall back to our old practices. If we allow ourselves to be divided again.\n\nWe might just get rid of anti Hindu laws if we stay united irrespective of your caste, region or language. And stop expecting modi- shah to do everything in next 5 years.

In fact, Allah gives Muslims the right to enslave non Muslim women as "spoils of war"\n\nThen we have all the stories that how before Islam there was usury, intoxication, people oppressed in Middle East and very peaceful at the time of Muhammad.\n\nI have narrated this story because that\'s what the Muslims try to portray everywhere.\n\n&gt;We are oppressed\n\n&gt;We increased in numbers\n\n&gt;We will wage holy war against you\n\n&gt;We will break your temples and idols\n\n&gt;We will say that those are our mosques (eg. Ram Janmabhoomi, Kashi Vishwanath).\n\n&gt;We will take our spoils of war (non muslim women)\n\n&gt;We will impose jizya\n\nThe reason why I\'m narrating this is because there seems to be an influx of "seculars" on this sub. This is to tell you\'ll main aim of muslims is to make the world bend it\'s knees to Islam. \n\nThey do so by following their SOP everywhere, starting from Middle East in 7th century.\n\nPlease feel free to correct any inaccuracies in the post.\n\nThank you.'<br />Author: 'prince_ranendra'  id: 'c8qwsz'<br />Score:25<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c8qwsz/owaisis_harmless_beliefs_should_be_an_issue/</li>

A majority of people here are illiterate or have bare minimum education. The incident happened on subsequent days.\n\nIncident 1- A current account customer comes to my desk and he wants to check his account balance and I tell him the balance. Cust : "No I received a msg that rs 2.00 lacs has been credited into my account". Me: Ummm no u haven\'t received the money. From where did u get the msg ?\n\n*Shows me msg* Msg from SBIDM says "Your account XXXX417 has been credited with Rs 2,00,000.00. I smell scam all around. I ask him did u receive a call from any one asking bank details ? He confirmed yes. Apparently he got a post cover with a lottery ticket from Flipkart which said he won two lacs and a person contacted him to give his PAN card details bank account number and address. This person gave him all the details. I warned him that this is just a scam and not to respond to them further and not to give details in future and sent him away.\n\nIncident 2-\n\nA teenager comes to the bank along with an elder.Says he wants to deposit cash to another bank. I tell him to do NEFT. I notice him holding an post cover that looks important. I casually ask him if its for a college application. He says No I have won a lottery of 12 lacs from Flipkart and I am sending the service tax money . I ask him the details and he opens the post cover and there is a small cardboard lottery ticket with proper flipkart logo and colourfully designed with a scratch panel where he had scratched and it showed you have won 12 lacs. I ask him how he got this and he said a person from flipkart called him. I asked him how the person from flipkart got his mobile number and the boysaid he purchases regularly from flipkart. After he got the card he contacted the number mentioned in it and a guy from somewhere north asked him all his bank details stating he was the Bank Manager and asked him to deposit Rs 6000/- "Tax" into his account. This account is an individual account and not a corporate account. This seems like just another version of the nigerian prince scame. Told the boy its just a scam and not to fall for this and to file a police complaint and sent him away after telling him about the way this scam works.\n\nI guess flipkart is selling people\'s data to scamsters and poor gullible people are targeted based on their locations.

Corruption, lack of accountability, poverty and no planning has destroyed the city. For what is the use of counting how great the economy is turning out to be, if there is no progress in improving the lives of the ordinary? Giving away land to private developers is easy, and inviting foreign nations and funds to build metros and coastal roads is not hard. But what is truly embarrassing is, India's richest city in which 50 percent of the population live in slums, most of them have no access to regular supply of water or sanitation, potholed roads, collapsing bridges, a creaking public transport system, terrible waste disposal, lack of green spaces, high pollution and no-long term planning. It's an ugly, dirty city and rightly an r/UrbanHell and a shithole.\n\nMumbai is just run by and is a comfortable home for the rich million or so, while the rest of 10s of millions toil away in the 'Mumbai Spirit', grown up to accept whatever shit that comes the way.\n\nMany asian megacities have gone through what Mumbai has, but they have improved over the years.

      <li>Title::: 'Maharaja Dahir Sen, the last Hindu ruler of Sindh'<br />Body: 'Born in 663 CE in the Sindh city of Alor, Maharaja Dahir Sen of the Chach-Brahmin Dynasty was the 3rd Maharaja of Sindh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Chach-Brahman dynasty (632 – 724 CE) was a Hindu power on the Indian subcontinent which originated in the region of Sindh. The dynasty was founded by Chach of Alor in 632 CE after he married the widow of Rai Sahasi II, the last ruler of the Rai dynasty. Most of the information about its existence comes from the Chach Nama, a historical account of the Chach-Brahman dynasty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rule of Sindh by a Hindu dynasty raised ire in the Umayyad Caliphate. Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan granted a large army to the governor Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, but no attempt was made to annex Sindh due to the caliph\'s death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, Hajaj launched a campaign under the command of Muhammad bin Qasim citing a pirate raid off the coast of Debal resulting in the loss of gifts to the caliph from the king of Serendib (modern Sri Lanka) as the primary reason for the expedition. In 711 bin Qasim attacked Debal and, on orders of Al-Hajjaj, freed the earlier captives and prisoners from the previous (failed) campaign.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom Debal, Hajaj moved on to Nerun for supplies, the city\'s Buddhist governor acknowledged the city as a tributary of the Caliphate. Qasim\'s armies then captured Siwistan (Sehwan) received allegiance from several tribal chiefs and secured the surrounding regions. His combined forces captured the fort at Sisam, and secured the region west of the Indus River.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometime before the final battle, Maharaja Dahir\'s vizier approached him and suggested that Dahir should take refuge with one of the friendly kings of India. "You should say to them, \'I am a wall between you and the Arab army. If I fall, nothing will stop your destruction at their hands.\'" If that wasn\'t acceptable to Dahir, said the vizier, then he should at least send away his family to some safe point in India. Dahir refused to do either. "I cannot send away my family to security while the families of my thakurs and nobles remain here."\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDahir said: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n"I am going to meet the Arabs in the open battle, and fight them as best as I can. If I crush them, my kingdom will then be put on a firm footing. But if I am killed honourably, the event will be recorded in the books of Arabia and India, and will be talked about by great men. It will be heard by other kings in the world, and it will be said that Raja Dahir of Sindh sacrificed his precious life for the sake of his country, in fighting with the enemy."\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDahir then tried to prevent Qasim from crossing the Indus River, moving his forces to its eastern banks. Eventually, however, Qasim crossed and defeated forces at Jitor led by Jaisiah (Dahir\'s son). Qasim fought Dahir at Raor (near modern Nawabshah) in 712, killing him. After Dahir was killed in the Battle of Aror on the banks of the River Indus, his head was cut off from his body and sent to Hajjaj bin Yousuf. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy enlisting the support of local tribes Meds, Bhuttos, and Buddhist rulers of Nerun, Bajhra, Kaka Kolak and Siwistan as infantry to his predominantly-mounted army, Qasim defeated Dahir and captured his eastern territories for the Umayyad Caliphate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/i08rf2lu9o731.jpg'<br />Author: 'misr_mamluk'  id: 'c7r4bv'<br />Score:27<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c7r4bv/maharaja_dahir_sen_the_last_hindu_ruler_of_sindh/</li>

The guy belonged to a long lined family of soldiers who fought for India, both during the British Raj and Independent India.\n\nHe described himself as an Ambedkarite and said his main motive was fighting for the underprivileged. His political movement was also marred with political thuggery that was usually justified on the basis of exploitation by the upper-class.\n\nThe main shift in the BSP came after his death. Mayawati, who he picked because she was, apparently, intelligent, but also because he thought that she was the best candidate for India as the first woman, Dalit PM. Now that Mayawati is increasingly making the party into her family oriented organization and her focus has shifted from the "oppressed population" to not even a Dalit but a Jatav vote bank focus party that has largely lost its relevance and continues to do so as more and more of the Dalit vote bank is shifting towards the BJP.

      <li>Title::: '[Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Nepal marks Pride Month, G20 Osaka Summit, and the Yalta Conference'<br />Body: 'Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Biweekly Geopolitics Thread, where we discuss big events from across the world that may or may not be related to India. The last two weeks have been quite news-packed around the world, so let\'s begin with some top stories:\n\n# Top 3 stories from India\'s neighbourhood\n\n1. [Pakistan Dy Speaker bans \'selected\' in National Assembly](https://www.asianage.com/world/asia/260619/unable-to-bear-pakistan-pms-criticism-official-bans-words.html)\n\nIn Pakistan\'s National Assembly (Lower House), the Speaker and his subordinates have the power to ban certain words that they deem unparliamentary. Since Imran Khan won his controversial election last year, the opposition has often called him a \'selected\' PM. Now, Dy Speaker Qasim Khan Suri (from Khan\'s PTI party) has had enough: he has banned the word, which instantly got him criticism from opposition members. Marriyum Aurangzeb from the PML-N now uses the word \'handpicked\' instead, while Bilawal Bhutto Zardari from the PPP (who is credited with coming up with the term) has challenged the Dy Speaker\'s authority to ban the word.\n\n2. [Nepal joins world in celebrating Pride Month](https://globalvoices.org/2019/06/30/in-pictures-nepal-holds-parade-during-international-pride-month/)\n\nPride Month, celebrated around the world in commemoration of the anti-LGBT police raid in New York and subsequent rioting in 1969, was marked in Nepal for the first time through an LGBT pride parade. Although Nepal has has pride parades every year for over a decade now, this was the first time it was celebrated in June. Nepal has historically been one of the most progressive countries in Asia (and by far the most progressive in South Asia) when it comes to LGBT rights, which are protected by law since the country became a republic in 2007. Currently, a law is being drafted to legalize same-sex marriage as well.\n\n3. [Canadian trash returns to Canada from the Philippines](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-canada-waste/ship-carrying-waste-arrives-back-in-canada-from-the-philippines-idUSKCN1TU0TB)\n\nA ship containing tons of biodegradable waste (including dirty diapers and newspapers) that was mislabeled as recyclable plastic and sent to the Philippines in 2013 has now returned to its country of origin, Canada. The shipment had led to a diplomatic row, with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte having threatened to go to war with Canada and withdrawing diplomatic staff in its mission. Canada had initially refused to take the trash back. Western countries (including Japan) ship waste to Southeast Asian nations for recycling, a practice that has become increasingly controversial. The current shipment will be incinerated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Top 3 stories from the world\n\n1. [Trump makes history as he enters N Korea](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-north-koreas-kim-wants-to-join-him-at-the-dmz/2019/06/29/ef99dc98-9a99-11e9-830a-21b9b36b64ad_story.html?utm_term=.b76597d4baa0)\n\nUS President Donald Trump made history as the first sitting US president to enter N Korean territory. On a visit to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the North and South - the working border between the two countries that still claim each other\'s territory in entirety - Trump met N Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and briefly stepped into N Korea for a picture before returning back. Trump\'s visit is highly unusual in that he issued an invitation to N Korea\'s dictator via Twitter, who agreed to meet him at very short notice. The countries have decided to resume talks that broke down earlier this year in Vietnam. \n\n2. [G20 Osaka Summit ends](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/29/g20-summit-osaka-japan-trade-wars-liberalism)\n\nThe 2019 G20 summit ended with much fanfare and controversy. The big headline of the summit was the resumption of US-China trade talks, with the US suspending additional tariffs on Chinese goods and the Chinese agreeing to buy American farm products while the two try to negotiate a deal without a fixed timeline. Meanwhile, 19 of 20 member countries pledged to tackle climate change in the spirit of the Paris Climate Agreement, with only the US remaining an outlier but promising to promote a healthy mix of energy and green technology. UK\'s PM Theresa May held an uneasy discussion with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who started the summit by bashing the idea of liberalism and its proponents as being out of touch. Indian PM Modi met Turkish President Erdogan, where they discussed their purchase of the Russian S-400 system, over which the US has threatened both countries with sanctions. And finally, India, Indonesia, and South Africa refused to sign on to a declaration on free movement of data across borders that was championed by Japan, a rare moment when India split with its long-time Asian ally. Separately, the US also made some unusual history when Trump\'s daughter Ivanka was in a [video](https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1144444815695908864) on the White House\'s official Twitter handle, summarizing meetings held in Osaka (instead of the usual practice of just issuing a press statement).\n\n3. [Sudanese military attacks pro-Democracy protesters](https://www.apnews.com/508fa97ee5aa48f3a1f5ae1d7644a157)\n\nSudan has been in the midst of protests since the overthrow of long-time dictator Omar al-Bashir. Since then, the country has been ruled by a military council that has repeatedly broken promises of restoring civilian rule. Protests have been continuing and came to a head last week, when over 100 protesters were killed by the military for continuing protests and causing general disruption. As a result, protesters, largely led by professionals, have called for a general strike in all the major cities. This has so far had mixed results, but clearly, Sudan\'s transition to democracy will not be easy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The Yalta Conference\n\nIt was February, 1945. Although World War II in Europe was still raging on, the tide had already turned the year before. Nazi Germany, which just five years before had been gobbling up territory and resources in Europe at a breathtaking pace, was fighting for its very existence. On the western front, armies of the US, the UK, and free France were pushing Nazi soldiers out of occupied lands, while on the eastern front, the Red Army had pushed the Nazis out of all of eastern Europe and was only a few days away from Berlin itself. However, as they say, war is an extension of politics, and the final resolution of WWII would not happen on the battlefield, but in a comfortable conference room. \n\nAnd thus was born the Yalta Conference, held in the resort of Yalta in the Soviet peninsula of Crimea. It was attended by the "Big Three" victors of WWII in Europe: Churchill from the UK, Roosevelt from the US, and Stalin from the USSR, and was meant to create a post-WWII European order by re-establishing European countries that had been occupied by the Nazis, and partitioning Germany so that it may never rise again. All three, of course, came with their own plans as well. For the Soviet Union, the most important desire was to create a Soviet sphere of influence in Eastern Europe to establish a buffer state for itself against any future invasion, and also to receive economic aid to rebuild itself. For the UK, its topmost priority was maintaining its global empire, while also converting Germany into an agricultural state with no industrial base. And for the US, which was basically funding the entire war, the main priority was convincing the Soviets to join a new international organization - the United Nations - and joining the war against Japan.\n\nConferences of this kind are often remembered for their achievements, the flashy photos and the high ideals from the final agreement. When the Yalta conference ended, there was a similar air of finality: the Allies had all but won, Germany would never rise again, and peace in Europe was assured. But those dreams remained dreams, for the Yalta Conference turned out to be a huge failure. The proverbial straw that broke the camel\'s back, just like in 1939, was the status of Poland. The UK and the US wanted Poland\'s borders restored and democratic elections held there. The Soviets, on the other hand, insisted that the parts of Eastern Poland that it had annexed in 1939 (under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact) remain with it, with Poland being compensated with western land from what used to be the largest German state: Prussia. The Soviets had their way, and then some: elections were never held in Poland, and a communist dictatorship was established instead. Russia did however, join the war against Japan.\n\nThe Yalta Conference established the post-WWII order, with one big difference. Out of the sheer size of its army and a US population that was tired of war and none too forgiving of an uninspiring President (Truman had succeeded Roosevelt after the latter died two months after the Conference), the Soviet Union could handily dictate terms, establishing puppet states across Europe and Asia. Those puppet states enabled the Soviet economic revival as a source of raw materials and captive markets. For the British, continuing mass uprisings in its most prized colony - India - and the collapse of its economy only seemed to point towards a dark future. For the Americans, despite their economic might and untouched homeland, a Soviet takeover of the world seem all but inevitable. \n\nUntil the first atomic bomb was tested. All of a sudden, the US had a new weapon that rendered Soviet military might obsolete. The war in Japan could be ended years earlier than expected, and the US could now dictate terms. And thus the Soviets were now forced to retreat from their triumphalism, and a quiet, uncomfortable peace was established. The Cold War had begun - just what the Yalta Conference thought it had managed to avoid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat stories from the world caught your attention?

      <li>Title::: 'Are Indians anti-authority by nature?'<br />Body: "I'm speaking in political terms, not personal life. \n\nThere's an opinion that Indians have always despised authoritarian leaders throughout their history. I think it was Shashi Tharoor who said that authoritarianism or even a less liberal democracy in the past were rejected by Indians. Ruchir Sharma on the other hand said that Indians always root the underdog, and that the word anti-incumbency is first coined in India, because it's so common for the incumbent govt to be booted out. \n\nAll of that has some truth to it, **but I think that in the national level, Indians have generally preferred more order than chaos.** Since 1947, so many incumbent state govts got voted out, but how many federal govts did? If you go back in history, 200 years of British colonialism and 300 years of Mughal rule hasn't been as turbulent as in some other parts of the world. Not so many people resisted them, relatively speaking. \n\nA regular Indian probably thinks: 'The nation is already so chaotic and disorderly, that's why we need a strong leader to bring stability. However, my local leader is a tyrant who needs to get kicked out'. And this mindset has always been there throughout history."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'c7ckfu'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/c7ckfu/are_indians_antiauthority_by_nature/</li>
