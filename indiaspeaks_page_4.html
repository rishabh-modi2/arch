Take AIMIM or Shiv Sena or BJP etc. Others use caste but that is too big a list.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany of us knew that Shiv Sena was even more brazen and hardcore when it came to religion before it came to power. But since then they have traded that religious ideology for power. They have essentially diluted their founders ideology and message to embrace the ideologies of its allies Congress and NCP. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor many it would look like a sellout but isn't that what all political parties will do or have done?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is a real example of what any political party based on religious ideology will end up as? A power hungry chameleon whose only loyalty is towards power.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSupporting political parties for religious reasons is not going to yield any result. Their religious propaganda is only for votes. Once they have power all they need is to be in power and that requires a complete U turn and secular ideologies."<br />Author: 'Maddoc_71'  id: 'ua4hrl'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ua4hrl/shiv_sena_selling_out_hinduism_for_political/</li>
      <li>Title::: "I read Qur'an within last two days. Now I am overwhelmed with thoughts!"<br />Body: ' I read *Qur\'an* for last two days, adjacent to many *hadiths* and *tafsir*. My goal was to better understand the religion and its formation. I have been always curious about different mythologies since childhood. I used to study and make family trees of Hindu, Greek, Roman, and Norse pantheons as a middle schooler. Internet was new for me and I was grinding it. I remember several hours over it, instead of my course work.\n\nMy interest awoke again, recently. This time, I decided to go for monotheistic religions/Abrahamic religions. The prominent ones I know of are Islam and Christianity. So, I decided to start with *Islam*. I did read a bit about formation of *Islam* in Class 11th History Book of NCERT. So, I started there. Read about the formation of *Islam* using various sources and then picked up *Ibn Ishaq*\'s biography of Mohammad. That was a week ago. Two days ago, I picked up *Qur\'an* and started going through the verses. I also started to read the relevant Hadiths compiled by *Ibn Hashim*. Now, the two days are over.\n\nFrom all I have learnt, I am just overwhelmed. I have a lot of mixed feelings. On one hand, I could understand the motivation of Mohammad to some extent in trying to form a religion in his own image based on his ideals, that was a way to uplift the society of Arabs. On the other hand, so many regressive practices were kept. Besides, I just can\'t wrap my head around a man saying that he speaks with God and that god appears in his dreams to give him sermons. However, I choose to ignore that willingly. It\'s not something I can help with. It was in past. Crying foul over it won\'t change a thing.\n\nWhat made my heart heavy instead was the fact that those words are still regarded as supreme words of God. I have learned that throughout history, many Asian religions have changed their practices to better accommodate the changing times. I am wondering why isn\'t that possible with *Islam* and *Qur\'an*? Can\'t we easily do away with many of the regressive verses if we wanted? I also read some conversations and debates regarding the controversial verses from the book and acts by Mohammad. Most of the arguments were simply that "it is a word of god, and hence can\'t be changed." But do they not realize that those are just words of a human that claimed to have spoken with God? Man makes God, then that god makes men. The same men can once again make their god; however they want.\n\nAlso, in many places online, I saw debates and arguments turn into mockery because people kept giving circular arguments. I was thinking about writing analysis about the different religions I had studied till now, after taking another go at the ones I studied during middle school. However, now I am not even in the stable state of mind to do so. I can\'t even claim and blame Allah for this. He is just a creation of Mohammad. At least in Homer\'s Odyssey, we could blame Zeus or Athena, or any other Greek God. Or in Hinduism, I can blame *Brahma* or *Indra*, or *Shiva*. That is because I know that even when these God\'s are made by men who wrote about them and their contemporary societies, they are at the end not active players in History. Neither do the acts of Greek, Roman, Hindu, or Norse gods are part of actual history. However, in case of *Islam*, the acts of Mohammad are actual part of history. What we know about pre-Islamic era is only through the texts of *Islam*. Even that made me doubt the many things I was reading.\n\nMy brain is currently a mess and I want to keep writing it out. But I think I should step back and let my thoughts gather before publishing anything. I am also now hesitating between going ahead and reading about the Christianity and Judaism, and just stopping here. Even if this was a vent, I welcome all your thoughts and any civil discourse you want to have.\n\nAlso, should I keep going and read about more religions now? Or just stop here? I have a feeling that Christianity and Judaism aren\'t going to be much different from *Islam* as they are both Abrahamic in nature too.'<br />Author: 'forprofitkiss'  id: 'ua46yt'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ua46yt/i_read_quran_within_last_two_days_now_i_am/</li>

But if the BMC or the SRA/MHADA undertake a slum rehabilitation project and convert all of these into public housing they can eliminate the slum problem of the city and create cheap housing for lower middle class/ lower class families migrating to the city. But the problem with this is the Real Estate Lobby always opposes such projects since they bring down the house value in a 1km radius. The Dharavi rehabilitation master plan which was initiated in 2016 a Dubai firm was appointed to carry out the first phase and was set to start construction in late 2019 the real estate lobby was lobbying hard for the scrapping of this project since Dharavi is surrounded by places like BKC and Bandra which are like the most expensive places for apartments and offices as soon as the MVA came in to power I am pretty sure they fed money to Shiv Sena or some other party in the alliance and got this project scrapped in 2"<br />Author: 'Spn_lol'  id: 'ua0l4i'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ua0l4i/mva_rant_2_the_dharavi_fuckup/</li>

I knew only of the non-violent way which is always taught in school and wanted to research on what did leaders like Netaji do, since he is such a prominent figure and many recognize him with fighting a true struggle.\n\nWhen I researched on what he did, I was shocked to know that he assisted the Japanese invasion of Burma in WW2 along with the then INA. I agree this was done to overthrow the British rule from India in a violent way, however this did cause a lot of death and casualties of many civilians in Bengal (not directly related to Netaji, it was the British who took from the locals of Bengal for the war effort). Not only that, I recently came across gruesome pictures of the Japanese army keeping Indian POW and, in typical Imperial Japan fashion, conducting many atrocities on them.\n\nFor sure, he wouldn't be celebrated such highly if this was the result of his efforts. I know that he was the founder of the INA and had really influential words, but wouldn't such acts make him condemned by his own people? since technically he was at war with India with India's enemies, the Japanese. (I also feel this wasn't a great thing since who knew if the Japanese wouldn't just take power over India and make it their puppet, just like the British having influence over us).\n\nThis question has really bothered me and I have not found any answer to this yet.

And many people laugh at us when we say that even Ramayan Has mention of this thing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n. \n\n\n\n. \n. \n\nNow I just wanted to put a logical thing here see:- All the languages in the world are developed on the basis of observable things and things that can be imagined. Now we have a word k/a "Vaiman" - meaning a thing that can fly. And it existed long before even Turks Invaded. In English or any European language I haven\'t found a single word that explains a mechanical machine that can fly until 1900. The word aeroplane is itself made of two words = aero(air) + planos(wandering). None of the words equivalent to anything that relates to a flying Machine. Acc to me this can be a proof that maybe, maybe our ancestors had some knowledge and the history about this man was totally wiped out or not even written by British historians to avoid any future claims by US.

NE gets very lil media attention so no wonder so many incidents never made it to the news.\n\nNagaland saw some of worst human rights violation during 1950s. Killing of several unarmed villagers , rape, torture, murder etc.\n\nThere many many incidents but will give a few examples.\n\nNagaland :\n\nMassacre of Matikhrü village 1960, Nagaland( u van Google it and see for yourself). This has been documented by the UNPO too. Here the entire adult male population was brutally wiped out.\n\nManipur :\n\nOperation bluebird,1987 - NSCN IM raided the Assam rifle post. And in return the Assam rifles led a counter insurgency operation. But the terrible revenge fell on 30 villages.\n\nSeveral women were molested.\n\n27 people died due to torture and starvation. A woman was forced to give birth and her new born baby died because no one could help them or feed the baby.\n\nMany men were tortured.\n\nManorama a manipuri girl was brutally tortured and raped by the Indian armed forces( 16 bullets were found in her vagina ).\n\nMizoram :\n\nIAF BOMBING 1966 ( the only Indian state to be bombed ). After that the unarmed villages were put in conc camps and were subjected to unspeakable torture.\n\nAssam :\n\nAssam has many cases of extra judicial killings and Massacres. Like Kakotpathor massacre in Assam.\n\nThere are many cases in the states of Tripura, Arunchal pradesh were women were raped and youths tortured.\n\nAnd this is just the TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

Just wanna make one thing clear this isnt to defame the entire armed forces. My answer is specifically talking about AFSPA regulated areas and the atrocities that indigenous population has to face during conflicts.\n\n Since some people dont like doing research.\n\nI just wanna say these incidents have been covered by various organisations, books, articles and documentaries have been written and made on AFSPA.\n\nIt doesn't take much time to google stuff and read.

      <li>Title::: "don't ignore"<br />Body: 'PLZ DONT EGNÓRE  A In the future there will be no BJP, no DMC, no Congress, no Left Front, Islam is the second largest religion in India. Professor Nasir bin Sulaiman ul Omar of Saudi Arabia says India is in a deep sleep. Islam is growing rapidly and thousands of Muslims have infiltrated the police, army, bureaucracy and entered the important organization, Islam is the second largest religion in India. Today India is also on the brink of extinction. Just as the rise of a nation takes decades, its destruction requires time. India will not end overnight. It will be gradually removed. We as Muslims pursue it very seriously. India will definitely perish. About 65,000 babies are born every day in India. Of these, about 40,000 are Muslim children and about 25,000 are Hindus and children of other religions. That is, the birth rate is about 20% of the total population of Muslims !!! Of the children born now, Muslims are the majority and Hindus are the minority. At this rate, by 2050, Muslims will be the majority in India. No one will stop India from becoming a Muslim country and India will immediately burn in the fire of riots. We Muslims will kill Hindus and bring them to an end. Today, according to government figures, Muslims make up about 20% of the population, but in reality they exceed 25%. Government figures are inaccurate because Wahhabi Muslims deliberately conceal real numbers and do not register this growing population as their weapon to keep Kafir Hindus unaware. Great fraud is going on in India in the name of secularism, but unfortunate Hindus are still in a deep sleep. Why did the Hindus not learn a lesson by looking at Kashmir, where the Hindus had to leave all their wealth and women and girls behind. India is secular as long as Hindus are in the majority, they do not know what will happen to them when they are a minority ???? These stupid Hindus do not even understand this from the statistics of the infidels of Pakistan and Bangladesh.\nThe Hindu will never speak, will remain silent, will take a high moral position, .. So, his destiny will surely sink . Pakistan and Bangladesh or Kashmir For example, Hindus are sure to come to an end. Consider the Muslim-majority areas of Kerala, Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Hyderabad and other states. Never go to an area where there are Muslim people in your city, you may be holding your breath between staring eyes! Apart from this, countries like Zambia and Malaysia are examples. With the arrival of the Muslim majority, these secular countries were declared Islamic countries. Violence occurs daily in countries such as London, Sweden, France and Norway. " Have you ever wondered why this is happening? Who does ?? What is the purpose ?? It is part of the peacekeeping tactic to create such panic among the people and instill fear without the courage to speak in their hearts! Don\'t you understand, they gather in the mosque 5 times a day in the name of Namaz and conspire against you ! ! They take a pledge and decide to finish you 5 times a day ...!! Therefore, closing the eyes and mouth is not effective . It is time to open our eyes and open our mouths and raise awareness among the people Less time !!! Think and understand. ?? Agarwal Sahab asked his servant Abdul-I have 2 children and I am worried about their future, but you have 12 and you are not worried yet. Abdullah - After 25 years, my 12 sons will take over your shop. You only earn for us, then why should I care. This is their state of mind. The great mansions built by the Hindus at Sialkot, Lahore, Gujranwala and Karanji were built for us. Even in independent India, the Kashmiri Hind us in Kashmir have built great mansions for us and in the end we occupied them and we do not have to worry about you.

      <li>Title::: 'A debunking of the Guardian article on Modi'<br />Body: 'Namaste\n\nI found this guardian article about Modi and BJP being "fascist": \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/20/hindu-supremacists-nationalism-tearing-india-apart-modi-bjp-rss-jnu-attacks\n\nHere\'s my refutation, copied from my other comments, feel free to use it whenever needed.\n\n&gt;Mahatma Gandhi was shot dead in 1948 by an RSS man, although the RSS claims he had left the organisation by then\n\nThe RSS chief, Gowalkar, literally said that Gandhi\'s death was a misfortune when he was informed of it,and immediately sent telegrams of condolences to Nehru, Patel, and Gandhi\'s children. He cancelled his countrywide tour and asked all RSS branches to remain closed for 13 days as a mark of mourning. And this was a big thing! RSS meetings are held 365 days a year, no break.\n\nHe called Godse a" traitorous individual" and called Gandhi\'s assassination "treacherous."\n\nAnd the government of the da, composed of people who *really* disliked the RSS, could not find any evidence against it.\n\nSo not outright fake but makes fake implications.\n\n&gt;ideologies of its students and faculty – exhibited in its hyperactive student politics – have traditionally been liberal, leftist and secular. \n\nSecular? If hating one religion and glorifying islamic terrorism and terrorists is secular, then yeah they\'re very secular.  Leftist? Is championing terrorism and publicly calling for the country to be broken up is leftist? Liberal? Unless the word has been heavily redefined, no.\n\n&gt;conservative, ethnocentric BJP\n\n1. Ethnicity is not even a factor in our politics lol.\n2. Is a massive welfare expansion, championing women empowerment, supporting legalisation of homosexuality conservative? Then yes, bjp is very conservative.\n&gt;The university has been like a stone in the boot of the BJP, hobbling the party with every step.\n\nHahahahaha hahahahaha\n\nRefugees of every south Asian faith are eligible – every faith, that is, except Islam.\n\nIf Modi\'s Hindu fascist, why does he want Jains, Buddhists, Parsis, Sikhs and Jains in?\n\nAnd secondly Normal refugee routes are always open for Muslims. And let\'s be honest here, it won\'t be politically correct but this act is meant to rescue people being persecuted in Pakistan and Afghanistan; Muslims aren\'t being persecuted there, considering that Pakistan was literally made to muslims.\n\nHonestly it\'s really funny how the Guardian calls violent, fiery riots as "demonstrations".\n\n&gt;72 years as a free country, India has never faced a more serious crisis.\n\nAnd this single sentence convinces me that the author, who\'s an expat in London btw, knows jack about Indian history. Look up the Indian emergency of 1975-77 when a PM literally declared a dictatorship over the country. This is nothing compared to that.\n\n&gt;Among their stratagems is the invention of categories of abuse for their opponents, to convey with a single label why such people should not be trusted to have India’s interests at heart\n\nNicknames are a common thing in political affairs. Even the opposition engages in it; just see Bh  a  kt, cha  d  di, etc.\n\n&gt;JNU type” refers to leftists of every stripe –\n\nNo! It only refers to people who do not have India\'s best interests at heart. People who publicly mourn for terrorists, who call for the breaking apart of the country. Not every leftist, not even a majority of them.\n\n&gt;the RSS had claimed that the Babri Masjid, a 16th-century mosque in the town of Ayodhya, stood on the very spot where the Hindu deity Ram was born. The location warranted a temple, the RSS declared, not a mosque built by an invading Muslim king. \n\nNevermind that an ASI survey, which included Muslims btw, supports that there was a structure there before Babri masjid. Let\'s just all label them as RSS 🤡\n\n&gt;he had allowed mobs of Hindu fanatics to murder hundreds of Muslims in riots during his chief ministership of Gujarat in 2002\n\nNevermind that he was a newbie who had just been thrust into office, heliterally begged the neighbouring states ruled by opposition to send police forces to help him start the riots? Nevermind that the riots were not started by him or the rss, but by a bunch of muslims burning a trainload of innocent pilgrims to death?\n\n&gt;Vice News\xa0examination\xa0of five of these tribunals found that nine out of 10 cases involved Muslims. Of the Muslims who appealed, 90% were declared illegal immigrants; for Hindus, the figure was 40%.\n\nJust look at the demographics of Bangladesh; 90% muslim and less than 9% Hindu. What do you expect the composition of illegal migrants to be?\n\n&gt;Niraja Jayal a Political scientist\n\nThis woman btw is a gender studies professor at a uk University.\nNot any sort of authority on India.\n\nThere\'s a lot more, but I\'m tired of reading this horseshit, so I\'ll end it here.

      <li>Title::: 'A few (perhaps platitudinous) thoughts about KGF'<br />Body: 'Many out here are calling it over-rated, &amp; to particular perspectives on how Cinema should be made, it is valid judgement. However, KGF should be seen as a stepping stone for better projects.\n\nA few points in favour of KGF:\n\n1. As far as conventional (popcorn) Kannada cinema is concerned, this is our magnum opus. It’s booked our place on the masala map so far dominated by Telugu, Tamil &amp; Hindi cinema.\n\n2. As far as intellectual/parallel cinema is concerned, the New Wave of Kannada Cinema is fresh, vibrant &amp; thriving. What’s more is that as we type all this out, more curious non-Kannadigas are googling Kannada movies &amp; probably statistically falling for our less-marketed, but smarter offerings as well as whatever else is similar to KGF. So we have KGF to thank for that.\n\n3. It’s brought together North+South industries in ways that Baahubali which was bigger, didn’t. Yes, RRR with Ajay Devgan came first, but this has a pan-India story, more of the Northern presence than ever seen before, &amp; isn’t restricted to regional freedom-fighters(not like that hindered the success of RRR!).\n\n4. The section of Indian cinema-lovers that’s looking to shun Bollywood for whatever reasons, now has something else to fixate on, instead.\n\n\n5. It’s high-octane hero-worship action, whistle worthy stuff, &amp; all that laymen miss from before the COVID era. It (along with TKF, Pushpa &amp; RRR) have brought the masses back to the Cinemas. These common folk can’t be blamed for thronging to what their hearts desire.\n\nMany liked it, so live &amp; let live, I say.

When you order a cab/rickshaw you usually want them to come pick you up in a reasonable time but that\'s never ever the case no matter how close the driver might be to you.. first they expect you to call them and personally invite them to your house for a pickup or they won\'t even move; then then they roam around somewhere for 10 minutes before even taking the proper route to your place. I lost it one day when the guy went like "sir coke pee raha hu aap ruko thodi der"\U0001f972. \n\nafter that unka natak shuru hota hai with " I will only come if you pay in cash" which is what I always wondered about. do they maybe not have a bank account?.. but nah, they just want the feel of money in their pockets.. but alright sure I am okay with that. Then the last thing if they don\'t just cancel, most of them don\'t even know how to use the technology; you will have to sit down and tell them how and which road to take, which shop to look out for and shit.\n\nThis all takes long with probably 2-3 cancellations already at which point you are better off just walking.. talked about it with the people I know who travel, and they face the same things in many different cities.

      <li>Title::: "SEBI extends deadline for removal of pooled accounts; MFU says that order doesn't apply to us"<br />Body: 'Firstly, it\'s not clear what SEBI is trying to achieve by making the NAV date more and more hazy. Not that the NAV date is hugely important for MF investors, but when they get too erratic, it looks very untidy and causes difficulties if you are reconciling your orders and cash flow data with each other. The order date, date of execution as per the order, date of debit on your bank account and NAV date ALL are likely to be different. Not only that, the gaps between them are not fixed.\n\nEarlier (I think in 2020) it ordered that the NAV date would depend on realization time of funds. Before that the order date used to be honored. Apparently order cancellations were hurting the AMCs, so this measure. But wish they had spared small investors and applied this rule for larger amounts.\n\nSo, after this measure came in, extremely convenient methods like MFU\'s PayEezz (NACH based) stopped being useful if you are interested in a predictable NAV date.\n\nBut there was an option of NEFT which was still giving a predictable NAV date. Wef 1st April SEBI barred use of pooled accounts and this option was closed. It\'s back to PayEezz now and with horribly unpredictable NAV dates.\n\nMFU said they are finding a solution and will release it soon. But "soon" of MFU is anybody\'s guess.\n\nFurther, SEBI extended the deadline for removal of pooled accounts to 1st July. On requesting MFU to restore NEFT mode at least till 1st July (and hoping that by then whatever new mechanism they have promised becomes operational), MFU replied saying "that SEBI order doesn\'t apply to MFU". They did not clarify why.\n\nSo comments welcome on:\n\n    What is SEBI up to in a series of these decisions that are not letting a customer get a predictable NAV date (notwithstanding it matters to some investors, and some investors don\'t care about it - it\'s anyway prudent to have a predictable settlement cycle like in stocks).\n\n    Why does the SEBI order to extend the deadline for removal of pooled accounts to 1st July does not apply to MFU (as claimed by them).'<br />Author: 'AdRelative8852'  id: 'u7pkpv'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/u7pkpv/sebi_extends_deadline_for_removal_of_pooled/</li>

This week I didn't see her for a couple of days and then she came again yesterday and was limping. I think one of her legs is broken or something. I gave her food and had to drop her outside. Unfortunately a couple of times she pooped in my Aunt's room and so she doesn't like them staying in. \n\nI live in a very remote village and there's no vets here also the cat is not vaccinated. My question is what can I do to help her?

      <li>Title::: 'The problem with the “left” news sources.'<br />Body: 'I worked in journalism in the UK for a short while, first for a local print and then for a rather large news company. What I have come to learn about large news sources is this: they do not care about the truth at all. This might seem very obvious to many people here, but because of this fact, we need to discuss things differently with people on the other side. The news sources quoted by these people include Al-Jazeera, BBC, CNN etc.etc. Every single one of these sources has journalists and writers in them that are very talented at twisting the truth without making it a lie. It is the **slight** wording of a phrase that can completely change the way it registers with the reader. For example:\n\n“In more than once incident, law breakers pelted stones and assaulted devotees celebrating Ram Navami in several states in India”.\n\nThis is the truth, and this portrays the truth in a way that is clear cut and shows how the victims of the crime were affected.\n\nA News source which wishes to emphasise the suffering may use words like goons, hooligans, criminals etc.\n\n\n“Stones were pelted on some Hindu festival processions in some states in India”. \n\nHere, there is no mention of the perpetrator. This absolves blame on a very minute psychological level. The festival and details surrounding the crime are blurry and unclear. The use of “some” states downplays the fact that it happened more than once and one too many times. Be aware of these things when conversing with people that consume these news sources.  \n\nIf you don’t believe me, go and look at the reporting that these very news sites do when it comes to Muslim tragedies and any other religious tragedies. They rightfully emphasise neoNazi crimes aswell, but when it comes to Christianity Hinduism Sikhism and Buddhism, it’s a far cry.'<br />Author: 'No_Friendship_9537'  id: 'u749zu'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/u749zu/the_problem_with_the_left_news_sources/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'experience as a Nastik in Hinduism'<br />Body: 'Is there anyone like me out there, who does not believe in god or concepts of heaven/hell? . I do nothing as a ritual, even don\'t follow anything whether it is Navratri/ puja/ fasting etc.\n\nBut I don\'t know, something is unique about this land that is very "mystic", it pulls you towards itself. And even me as a "nastik" starts to enquire about life, the dharma, everything. When I became "equally awestruck" of our ancestors wisdom, rich heritage in form of epics, natyashastra, Kavya, beautiful carved temples, carved sculptures, our culture and tradition. I was drawn into Bhagavad Gita / Mahabharata as "cool thing in hinduism"\n\nWhat happened to me, I don\'t know , slowly dived into Bhagavad Geeta. I was first skeptic about its "authenticity/ poem" as I was trying to interpret literally. This was because I had ego of "knowing science "just like other youngsters . Slowly I understood little by little.\n\nLater when I was sitting in my room, suddenly I found that "Bhagvad Gita" is not to be understood based on third person. it is to be understood based on first person where "Arjuna is me and not " "based" archer Arjuna", Mahabharata is inside my mind - negative/positive thought. Krishna is telling me and not Arjuna to the duty for dharma .\n\nAnd who is Krishna, after 2 -3 slow reading, I meditated and ponder about his character. I found that he is the diplomat, the ruler, charioteers, wise man who was enlightened just like Buddha. He showed Arjuna " Viraat Swaroop" that is " the consciousness", where Arjuna submitted to him, and found that if everything in life is perishable, destructible then why to be sad knowing this truth.\n\nThis realisation of truth made me think for almost 1-2 years. I even thought , I shouldn\'t have read , or gone into that zone. But later when I was "glancing over Ashtavakra Geeta" I got the answer " you are that - that "सच्चिदानन्द" who is always there before time/space. Here not talking about mind but the "dhyan" which resides in you, you have to just put your dhyan on yourself , watch your thought in mind chatters, if it disappears, your "chit Swarup will blossom"\n\nLater after "experiencing" that no other Human beings, even plants, animals are different to me, their life is exact the same as me. Then why create boundaries , fight over resources among humans. IT is here I realised that how Gandhi made a huge mistake. He tried to follow the spiritual path and dictated his followers to do the same . His "story of my experiments" showcases how spirituality can create roadblock in "Artha/kama/Dharma". Here the role of Krishna as a diplomat/wise man comes to play, he was "not for ahimsa but for himsa" for dharma. Secondly, role of Vishnugupta Chanakya\'s role in compilation of Arthshastra comes to play. [https://www.amazon.in/dp/B06XXTB7L2/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?\\_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B06XXTB7L2/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1)\n\nSo in last I want to convey the full verse of "अहिंसा परमो धर्मः Non-violence is the ultimate dharma" that is in Mahabharata - अहिंसा परमो धर्मः धर्म हिंसा तथैव च - "Non-violence is the ultimate dharma. So too is violence in service of Dharma and I(Krishna) manifest in life form and appear on earth to restore dharma"\n\nI -krishna represents "conciousness" when there is right condition in time/space there will "appropriate mind" who would fight for dharma from age to age -like Shivaji, Maharana Pratap, Guru Gobind. You may be thinking he is talking about "Kalki" so then question, it should have written "I will born once again as Kalki" and not "born from age to age".\n\nSo at last , wanted to say , you can be him but have you got right kind of spirit? sacrificial elements? knowledge of righteousness?\n\nStill I am Nastik ! but the "duty for dharma" have strongly moulded my thoughts there on !'<br />Author: 'Practical-Penalty308'  id: 'u71goo'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/u71goo/experience_as_a_nastik_in_hinduism/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Please protect Hinduism from Christianity'<br />Body: " While the Hindu community is busy with Muslims - the biggest threat to Hindus lies not from the Muslims but from Christians . Christian conversion is taking place at a rapid rate and demographics are changing very fast-I am from Karnataka and here I am seeing even middle class upper caste people getting converted and I have no idea why.\n\nMany times these people while getting converted will add a Christian symbols along with the statues of Hindu gods - but once they get converted they remove the Hindu gods altogether. The removed stickers/paste marks can be seen on the headboard of the vehicles\n\nThe number of Christians is increasing at a rapid rate and they are becoming extremely active. While the numbers cannot be seen directly since many still say they are Hindu. The following can be used to predict the actual number of Christians.\n\n1)See the number of Crosses on vehicles  \n2)The number of active users on sharechat for the Christian posts forum vs Hindu posts forum  \n3)On Google maps search Church and the zoom into an area - you will see many buildings/prayer houses that earlier were not there\n\nBased on this my estimate is that there are already close to 15% Christians in Karnataka - and the governments, the temples, RSS seem to be sleeping.\n\nThe Karnataka govt has for example passed the Anti-conversion bill in only one house while making noises about other issues that become popular like temples freeing, education changes -making noises but at the same time doing nothing. There were talks about reconversion by Hindu Mathhas but nothing materialized on the ground. A church survey was planned but nothing done.\n\nThe BJP govt in Karnataka makes the right noises without actually doing anything while the BJP govt doesnt even make the right noises. Small actions like tightening FCRA, putting the fear of Hindus in the Christian pastors, punishing people who proselytize in the name of fake promises and health gains, prosecuting pastors such as Balwinder who have rape cases against them have not been taken.\n\nBy hiding numbers Christians are able to increase and expand without facing the backlash they would normally face. The government and individuals need to wake up before it is too late. Already Christians are the largest religion in Arunachal Pradesh(growing from 1% in the last 30 years - data available on wikipedia) and are the largest religion in Kanyakumari(Data available on wikipedia) according to open data.\n\nIt is just a matter of time before the shown numbers start reflecting what has been going on in other states as well\n\nI request any and all Hindu organizations to wake up.\n\nYou are failing to protect Hinduism - there is a saying 'Demography is Destiny' - and the way things are going we may soon be reduced to a minority in our own land. \n\nWake up take action - start reconversion - reduce dropouts.\n\nI have written an article of what can be done - but please wake up [https://structures.substack.com/p/part-1-how-to-protect-hinduism-in?s=w](https://structures.substack.com/p/part-1-how-to-protect-hinduism-in?s=w)"<br />Author: 'ramesh-suresh'  id: 'u6xx8e'<br />Score:196<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/u6xx8e/please_protect_hinduism_from_christianity/</li>

The car was so fast that there were skid marks over 100 feet long. He was dragged for 20-30 feet then hit his head on the divider. There was a lot of bleeding and he couldn't be saved. \nWhat sucked is that there is no police action yet. There is no information on the car driver yet. I think the police don't give a damn because the man didn't belong to a powerful or super rich family. Probably the police will close the case in a few days with no lead. \n\nAlso, my colleagues who reached the accident spot first told me that there were people who were making videos of him lying unconscious while no one was trying to help.

Don't fall trap to the EQUALITY MENTALITY"<br />Body: 'We recently heard news from Maharashtra government that Hanuman Chalisa will be banned within 100m from a mosque.\n\nEveryone knows a lot of mosques were built right on top of demolished temples.\n\nBut do you know how many mosques literally share a boundary wall with a temple and blare Azan?\n\nClearly there is no law banning Azan within 100m of a temple.\n\nWhich brings me to the **TL;DR - Don\'t be a Dhimmi.**\n\n----\n\nDon\'t fall trap to the EQUALITY MENTALITY\n\nBan Hijab/Azan. Wear Tilak/Bhagwa. Play Hanuman Chalisa. \n\n**Don\'t say - "If they can do X, We can also do Y".  \nInstead say - "They should not do X. We will do Y".**\n\nX=masjid azan, Y=hanuman chalisa  \nX=kala hijab, Y=kesari angavastra  \nX=tax masjid, Y=free mandir  \n\nBias cannot be fought with neutrality. **Bias must be fought with bias.**  \n-10 can become +10 only by adding +20, not by adding +10, which will only result in 0.\n\nThis is Naya Bharat.\n\nI don\'t want a secular country. I don\'t want a pacifist Hindu Rashtra (which we already are).\n\nI want a Bharat Rashtra that is intolerant of Abrahamic religions like Islam and Christianity.  \nBecause these two Abrahamics have proven to be intolerant of Hindus.  \nCurrent citizens of other religions can ghar wapsi back to Hinduism, the religion of their ancestors.  \n\nOthers can practice their religion in their country.  \nThat is what Hindu Rashtra means - We do not invade other countries and convert them **by force.**  \n\nTamil Chola Hindu kings conquered SE Asian countries like Thailand (which still has Pattabhisheka ceremony for a king), Indonesia, Bali, Cambodia etc. But is there any historical edict of forced conversions in those countries ? Unlike Mughals in India who converted at sword point (men) or dick point (women).\n\nOther religions actively enter our country and convert our country men. But here, we are whining like wussies about not getting EQUAL treatment in our own country.  \nAre all Kshatriyas in this country dead? What\'s left are bunch of **napumsaks masquerading their impotence as ahimsa**\n\nBhagavan creates different religions for people of different gunas.  \nIslam for Tamas-guna-predominant folks, Christianity for Rajas-predominant and Hinduism for Satvik-predominant folks.  \nAll paths may lead to Bhagavan, but they are all steps in a ladder. \nOnly our Satvik religion is the final step before Moksha.\n\n----\n\nHowever, Do not think you are pro-Hindu just because you are anti-Islam.   \nIf you are against conservative/orthodox principles, you are against all religions.\n\nIn order to be different from the Abrahamics, should we give up our own traditions ?  \nAlcohol is prohibited in Islam, so let us drink daru.  \nAdultery is prohibited in Islam, so let us fornicate.  \nPornography is prohibited in Islam, so let us become hoors.  \nSince Muslims breathe oxygen, raitas will stop breathing too ?\n\n**I don\'t have a fetish to differentiate Hinduism from Abrahamics.**  \nMy religion is the only one that can answer perennial spiritual questions about karma and rebirth.  \nHinduism is a superset of Islam. Most rules in Islam already exist in Hinduism. But there are more rules &amp; restrictions in Sanatan Dharm than in any other religion, and I\'m proud of it, because the more you constrict a spring, the higher it can jump.  \nBut the sheer beauty of it is that most of these rules are voluntary and not imposed. There is no extra punishment for not attaining Svarga or Moksha because that itself is the punishment.\n\nShould I give up my claim to be the true path just because someone else also claims it ? Only napumsaklibbus do that.\n\n----\n\nI don\'t have a fetish to be different. I have a fetish to be true. Sanatan Dharm is true. \n\n**Satyameva Jayate**'<br />Author: 'Happily_Single'  id: 'u6xsz4'<br />Score:312<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/u6xsz4/dont_be_a_dhimmi_dont_fall_trap_to_the_equality/</li>

This is a very nonsensical debate that should not even happen as it is common sense. When you enter a mosque, it is required that you cover the head. If I don’t want to cover my head and demand that I enter the mosque and receive benefits, isn’t that stupid? Isn’t it stupid that when I’m denied entry that I cry I’m being deprived of my right to go inside a mosque and pray? I’ll just go and pray elsewhere then. Common sense.\n\nAll that being said, it’s not worth the debate or the issue. I feel you should let them wear what they want because look at the big issue they’ve made of such a small thing. There are many schools, there are home schools, there are tutors. Why not switch? But to avoid all the nonsense and resource wasting and violence against Hindus because of this, just let them wear whatever. The school should just allow it and let them wear a chaddar and come to school wrapped up in hot weather, it doesn’t matter so long as there is no more violence and rioting over this issue. It’s a time waste issue.

      <li>Title::: 'Help my dad find a job (journalism)'<br />Body: 'Hello /r/IndiaSpeaks,\n\nLong time lurker, but currently using an alt I created just for ranting about my familial situation many months ago.\n\nMy father (56) lost his long-time job in April 2020 as an English print media journalist when the early phase of Covid struck India. He has been working in the media/journalism industry for over 35+ years and his lay-off came as a big shock to our family.\n\nSince then, he has been struggling to get a proper, suitable job. He has since been doing part-time work appearing on radio shows hosted by All India Radio (AIR) and other small ‘subject matter expert’ gigs that pay like crap. He told me that the job market in print media is extremely tight because of a massive decline in newspaper circulation and the rise of digital media and whatnot. He has been really struggling and my mom has also been extremely vexed because of this.\n\nHe’s a classic old timer journo who still uses pen and paper during press meet/press conferences to jot down key points and whatnot, though he is well versed with publishing tools and email and whatnot.\n\nIn terms of his work history, as I mentioned earlier, he has been in the industry for over 35+ years and has worked with extremely well-recognized media organizations in the country, including a newspaper that’s read by nearly every UPSC aspirant, and another media organization from the house of Goenka, and a well-recognized news wire service. His last job title was that of a **‘Senior Assistant Editor.’**\n\nIn terms of the topics covered (or ‘beats’ as you call it in your journalistic jargon), he has worked on:\n\n•\tSouthern Indian politics, especially from a federal perspective (his specialty)\n\n•\tParliament proceedings (Lok Sabha+Rajya Sabha between 2004-2014; 10 years of UPA)\n\n•\tMinistry of Labour and labour rights issues\n\n•\tDefence ministry for a brief period (during the Pranab da, AK Antony days). Covered a few under Manohar Parrikar ji as well!\n\nAmong his most prized topics of coverage (which he still talks about to this day) was his covering of Rajiv Gandhi assassination trial in Madras High Court (when he was based out of the south). **He was also formerly accredited with the Press Information Bureau (PIB) of India, though he currently doesn’t hold that accreditation.** \n\n\n\nMy family (including my father) is **currently based out of New Delhi**, though I live elsewhere. I chose to reach out to reddit indiaverse because I’ve been seeing him struggle for 2 straight years now and his mental health has taken a beating, not to mention the loss of income to the family and whanot, aside from the fact that I work in the tech industry so I have no connections in the journalism industry. Oh and he speaks 5 languages (can read and write 3 of them).\n\nWhen I spoke with him earlier today (the first proper chat I’ve had with him in months as I don’t have a great relationship with my dad), he mentions how his age plays into his employment situation as most media organizations are (understandably) interested in recruiting younger journalists. The fact that he’s also just 3 years away from his retirement (though he’s willing to work beyond 60 to make up for lost time) also plays into it.\n\nAdditionally, he’s also willing to work in other auxiliary/related roles like corporate communication, public relations, etc. I’m sure there are many redditors on /r/IndiaSpeaks who work in the journalism industry, so any help would be greatly appreciated in this matter.\n\nThank you so much for reading my plea. If this post results in him landing a job, it would mean the world to our family.\n\nMy inbox is open for queries (and for his CV/resume) and I’d be more than happy to connect you with my father if you think you have a role that might suit his profile and skills.

The Home Affairs Ministry has detailed the purpose of the division, but it was only after Narendra Modi came into power that the Naxalites actvties reduced. In 2009, The Government of India initiated a project to reduce the Naxalites in these regions. This initiative is known as the Integrated Action Plan which is to focus on promoting economic activities in the Naxalite hit areas and an increase in special police funding.\n\n# Why things got better after Narendra Modi?\n\nLet’s do a small recall.\n\nShri Rajnath Singh was appointed as Home Affairs Minister from 2014 to 2019. Under him, he visited the LWE places and decided to take stock of what has happened.\n\nLet’s look at what are some of the new projects that both PM Modi govt and CM Naveen govt has put out:\n\n**Jeypore Airport**\n\nThis airport was included in UDAN and was supposed to commence operations before 2020 but it hasn’t commenced yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Junagarh-Nabarangpur ; Nabarangpur-Jeypore Railway Lines.**\n\nLand Acquistion has delayed the Nabarangpur-Jeypore project and the final survey location for Junagarh-Nabarangpur has been approved.\n\nWith Ashwini as Railway Minister and the Rajya Sabha MP for Odisha, this railway project will be a test whether he is able to work with Odisha Government to speed up the work for this line.\n\nThe Southern District of Odisha have not gotten a single railway line since 1948. I hope PM Modi government and CM Naveen Patnaik begin the construction.\n\n**Software Technological Park of Jeypore** \n\nThe park was supposed to be completed in February 2022 however this is still not known if this has been completed.\n\n([https://bhubaneswar.stpi.in/en/about-stpi-bhubaneswar](https://bhubaneswar.stpi.in/en/about-stpi-bhubaneswar))\n\nMobile Towers in Southern Odisha \n\nMobile towers have been setting up in Southern Odisha. Odisha’s rural area has a tele density of 61.81% which is quite low. \n\nOne fact from the statement from the Minister is note worthy:\n\nFive towers could not be installed due to [Maoist](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Maoist) activities and forest clearance permission, said minister of state for communications [Devusinh Chauhan](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Devusinh-Chauhan) in [Lok Sabha](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Lok-Sabha) on Wednesday.\n\nIt is hoped they will be able to clear the Maoists from the state.\n\n[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/odisha-483-more-mobile-towers-coming-up-in-left-wing-extremism-affected-areas/articleshow/88303751.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/odisha-483-more-mobile-towers-coming-up-in-left-wing-extremism-affected-areas/articleshow/88303751.cms)\n\nSurrender And Rehab Policy\n\nThe policy has seen a great success as it has resulted in a drop in the Maoists activites.\n\nIt is interesting to see what the policy entails. \n\n**In a nutshell:**\n\nFor higher cadre member:\n\nRs 5 lakhs will be given as help\n\nFor lower and middle cadre: Rs 2.5 lakhs will be given as monetary help.\n\nEach Maoist cadre will receive a stipend of Rs 6000 per month to go through vocational training. This move is really good as they can acquire new skills, contribute to the economy and feel a sense of belonging as an Indian. The reason why I said this is because Maoists are anti nationals and always resort to the unconstitutional activities by using violence on innocent folks. An MP in 2007 was even killed by Maoists in Jharkhand. When the Maoists have the skills, they can venture out to get jobs in other regions of Odisha or the rest of India.\n\n[https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2021/aug/17/three-naxals-from-chhattisgarh-surrender-before-dgpin-odisha-2345771.html](https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2021/aug/17/three-naxals-from-chhattisgarh-surrender-before-dgpin-odisha-2345771.html)\n\n# Why has the rural area not receive any development?\n\nThis is a question that I too have. I was pondering is it because we have forgotten on rural areas while improving the urban areas?\n\nAnother issue is the center-state relationships. Odisha healthcare in rural is really saddening. People may praise Naveen Patnaik government for his excellent healthcare policy. But it’s the centre who is at fault along with Naveen Patnaik government.\n\nNITI Aayog has too expressed disappointment and agony over how things have turned out. For example, Odisha is the ONLY state that has not implemented the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana so far. Instead they have their own health scheme: Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana. This is very clear because the people of Odisha vote for Biju Janta Dal on the basis of Biju Patnaik. The Niti Aayog has mentioned this in their report for the Missing Middle.:\n\n"The Niti Aayog report says BSKY also covers the missing middle, but it mostly focuses on economically vulnerable families which are covered under the Food Security Act of both the Centre and the State.\xa0 Some State extension schemes, including the BSKY, though provide a broader or deeper benefit package and include groups like differently-abled, individuals earning below state-specific income thresholds, there is nothing much for the missing middle."\n\nWhat is missing middle:\n\n“The ‘missing middle’ is a broad category which lacks health insurance, positioned between the deprived poorer sections, and the relatively well-off organized sector. The deprived and poor sections receive Government subsidized health insurance, while the relatively well-off in the organized sector of the economy are covered under social health insurance, or private voluntary insurance. The missing middle refers to the non-poor segments of the population who remain prone to catastrophic, and even impoverishing health expenditure, despite the financial capacity to pay for contributory health insurance. “A visualisation can be found in page 12 of this report.\n\nAnother issue is the railways project which can help to bring some new commercial activity near the area but this has been marred as mentioned by land acquistion issue. If center and sate can work together to get land acquistion done on time and ensure that construction is done as quick as 3 years, I am sure the Maoists would not have chance to spread their anti national efforts. But there needs to be enough security when doing this infrastructure work.\n\n[https://www.niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2021-11/HealthInsuranceforIndia%E2%80%99sMissingMiddle\\_01-11-2021\\_digital%20pub.pdf](https://www.niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2021-11/HealthInsuranceforIndia%E2%80%99sMissingMiddle_01-11-2021_digital%20pub.pdf)\n\n([https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jan-ashirwad-yatra-aswini-vaishnaws-outreach-visit-this-week-to-cover-kbk-region/article35951305.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jan-ashirwad-yatra-aswini-vaishnaws-outreach-visit-this-week-to-cover-kbk-region/article35951305.ece))\n\n([https://odishatv.in/news/exclusive/niti-mpi-shows-odisha-s-kbk-syndrome-lingers-on-from-narashima-rao-to-naveen-patnaik--164926](https://odishatv.in/news/exclusive/niti-mpi-shows-odisha-s-kbk-syndrome-lingers-on-from-narashima-rao-to-naveen-patnaik--164926))\n\n# About Maoists\n\nThese are the extremists who provided hope to the poor citizens living in Odisha, Chattisgarh and AP but were actually anti-national. It is sad to see that the previous governments did not focus on the root cause.\n\nThe root cause is due to the development as I mentioned. However, the funding for these Maoists needs to be stopped and hope Amit Shah can do something. \n\nAmit Shah and Rajnath Singh have done some things but there are still rooms for improvement.\n\nAs for Odisha Government, it has to ensure that the region gets its necessary development. 70 years and on, the government is grappling with land acquisitions. It needs to get a strong land acquisition law and strong officials to do this.\n\n**Will Odisha see a next change in elections?**\n\nNaveen Patnaik is powerful and strong to be defeated. Opposition is unable to match up to him. It is disappointing to see very slow progress in the state due to land acquisitions.'<br />Author: 'LankyAcanthocephala3'  id: 'u5irb0'<br />Score:35<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/u5irb0/the_harsh_realities_of_southern_odisha_and_how/</li>

Partition takes place, Pakistan is formed. Maharaja Hari Singh is still undecided about Kashmir’s accession to either India or Pakistan.\n\nOctober 1947: Aided by Pakistani army regulars, tribesmen from Pakistan’s Northwest Frontier Province attack Kashmir in a bid to occupy it.

Pandit families living in border towns are forced to flee and take shelter in Srinagar and elsewhere.\nMaharaja Hari Singh signs the instrument of accession with India.

      <li>Title::: 'There is no "EASY MONEY" or quick returns for financial Security/Investments . How to avoid Traps'<br />Body: " I have a severely stereotypical 'Adarsh baalak' Indian background (Engg + MBA Fin) and live a typical 'normie' life in an Indian Metro city , a life that the average parents would love their kids to have. I have been involved in the stock market 'Analysis &amp; investing stuff' as a hobby since past few years. \n\nI'm writing this because off late I've seen a disturbing trend in the past year with the mushrooming of telegram &amp; Whatsapp groups, discord servers  and heck even I get those annoying calls from Indore promising me to make money . ( and also because it’s a 4 day market holiday and I was itching to do something.)\n\nAm seeing more and more Newbies and Young folk ( even teenagers) getting a DEMAT account opened along with Futures and Options segment activated and that too in their parent’s name!! ( This is the brokerages’ ploy and is unethical.. more on that in a later post)\n\nThe big draw seems to make an huge and easy gain by ‘simply’ following the tips and trades shared on a telegram channel and buying whatever thing that is recommended you don’t need to know anything , no qualifications required just sit back become a ‘trader’ click buttons on an app after seeing a graph with a ‘custom indicator’ and earn easy money. \n\nPicture seems to be: No Education required , no jobs needed, no rat race.. just sit on a beach with a coconut with cocktail straw  and a laptop while money falls around you.\n\nSadly, Nothing can be further from the truth and don’t know about coconuts but you probably end up with peanuts if you are lucky (crushing debt if you're not). \n\nSo here are simple points to Identify and avoid such traps.\n\n1&gt; **If some thing sounds too goo to be true it probably is**. There’s a concept called risk and return: It basically boils down to the bigger the reward you expect, the bigger the risk you will have to take. That is a law of nature and Capital Asset Pricing Model. (Fun fact: IF you take a huge risk that is NO guarantee that there will be a huge return) . \n\nThis means that if you see huge gains from little effort, that means there HAS to be an appropriate amount of huge risk sitting underneath the iceberg. Avoid anything that promises huge returns with little to no effort. \n\n2&gt; **Past Returns are no guarantee of future returns** : With a skewed risk reward ratio, Even if you got lucky in round 1 it is statistically unlikely that you will be able to repeat the results again and again and this cannot be a way to create long term wealth. If you see anything advertised ONLY because it has got a huge return, understand that it is in no way predictor of future. Run away from that scheme\n\n3&gt; **No one can accurately predict or time the market.** Trading gurus, Telegram Channels and ‘YOLO Trade calls’ are mostly a scam. There’s a saying in trading : If someone says they bought at the bottom and sold at the top are either God or a Liar. Market is a place which teaches you humility in the long run no matter how big a fish you are. There are huge hedge funds run by brilliant people with all the resources which go bust jut because of arrogance. If you see such ‘foretelling’ ‘visionary’ claims, RUN away and delete your browser history.  \n\n4&gt; **Derivatives: Futures and Option are a recipe for instant destruction**. If you are new to the market and a cool guy comes and asks you to just buy a CE/PE of Nifty/Banknifty after showing you charts about how it doubled just in a day, feel free to smack him on the nose with a roll of newspaper. Please realise that Derivatives are a ZERO SUM GAME. That means whatever amount you earn HAS to come from someone’s pocket. (Usually it is us, the ‘retail investors’ who generously donate money to Institutions and Brokerages) It takes years to understand the mathematics and the factors that affect the price of a simple Option contract and how to create a strategy as per the market condition. Plus execution is a different game. You could be RIGHT in your View and still LOSE money if you don’t execute the trade optimally.\n\n5&gt; **One trading course will NOT bring you a fortune**. Ever wondered why would anybody invest so much time and energy to teach you trading if they can easily make loads of cash with their superb trading skills?? Because it is extremely difficult to earn a consistent living from trading.\n\nFine, now you realize that I seem to have removed all the fun and easy ways to get rich, you start to think this ageing millennial who probably moves around in a ‘banyaan’ scratching his hanging paunch while sneezing and farting loudly just wants kids to have a hard time and ‘suffer’ like he did: \n\nNo, there are ways to secure your financial freedom and you have to be very disciplined about it. Experience and markets are expensive teachers and I’m telling you these things after having wasted a lot of my life: time , money and resources to finally realise these things. But you are free to discover these on your own:\n\n1&gt; **Trading is not an easy career path.** First let me Address the Elephant in the room: Entrance exams and studies are tough right? Those damn high cut-offs ,95+ percentiler CAT/XAT/NEET cutoffs.. why go through the grind when you can make some effort to read , be well informed and then trade.. that surely must be different since you are taking trading as a career right?\n\n Well , read what  The Creator of ZERODHA is saying : \\[just 1% of active traders make more than bank fixed deposits over 3 years timeframe\\]( https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1478260639105622019?s=20&amp;t=Voq3TYHmZ7kNxsCfueJXGw)  \n so Yes, the Percentile to succeed remains brutally the same(if not more), but the side effect is that you waste your time and burn money you and gain no other useful marketable skill to get you an actual job with a consistent income. Therefore if you’re new this CANNOT be your main pursuit in life. If you want to ‘learn by experience’ do it with your own money that you won’t bother if it turns to Zero. More importantly do it with expendable money AFTER your savings. At the bare minimum read Zerodha Varsity before doing anything related to the market. (Can't get a more accurate, better and easier teacher/material than that)  \n\n2&gt; **Develop a skill,** “Get one of them jobs” reduce expenses, avoid credit/debt of any kind, Plan your finances! Your wealth will grow from whatever ‘Assets’ you create, it can be an Investment from your savings , a skill that you use to create things or even an automation that you use to save time. Try to make something that works for you without you having to look after it.\n\n3&gt; **Power of compounding**. If you are starting off in life you would be amazed what the power of compounding. Remember those guys saying ‘Mutual Funds sahi hain’ in the Ads ..well they aren’t completely wrong. Any MF would give you an average of around 10-12% in the long run. Use any SIP calculator and check: if you invest just 10k per month in SIP when you’re 20 you’ll have around 1Crore by the time you reach 40. So whatever happens, for the love of money please do not discontinue your SIPs, keep on finding ways to increase them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHAT is how you will become a crorepati without sweat."<br />Author: 'Unvalued_Investor'  id: 'u4ry4w'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/u4ry4w/there_is_no_easy_money_or_quick_returns_for/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Men in power'<br />Body: 'Today I met my friend after 4 months, and she shared an incident that happened with her back in her college which is in Gwalior.\n\nLet’s say my friend’s name is Olly; Olly lives with her family in a small city near Lucknow. No one except for her is in the same college as her from her hometown. She has a couple of friends in her college and one of them is her best friend, let’s name her Maya. Now Maya comes from a family that is very orthodox and doesn’t let their daughters explore the world. Some how, Maya’s relative got to know she has a boyfriend, and he hacked her phone, got to read her conversations w her boyf, saw their pictures together, etc. They then confronted her, beat her up, and took her access from her phone and other digital devices. When she came to college, the hacker relative followed her, and saw her with Olly (my friend). At this time, Olly and Maya were unaware that they’re being followed, and since Maya did not have access to her mobile, she reached out to her boyf using Olly’s phone. Seeing that, this hacker relative came up to them, snatched Olly’s cellphone, and pushed her to get into his car. He then drove these two girls to Maya’s home. In all of this duration, Olly did not have her phone, and she felt very unsafe as anything could have happened. \n\nUpon reaching home, the hacker relative twitched and pulled Olly’s ear and dragged her inside the home. And he started beating up Maya, and locked them inside a room without giving back Olly her phone. And these things were witnessed by Maya’s mom, grandmother and grandfather. These grandmother and grandfather started discriminating Olly based on her religion as she’s a Christian and they started saying stuff along the lines “ye toh shaadi se pehle hi sab krlete h”\n\nWhen she shared these things with me, I insisted her to take legal actions against the hacker relative. But she told me the hacker relative is some politician in Gwalior and no one would take action against him. \n\nI really want to help them, and the hacker relative should be held accountable for his actions. Girls shouldn’t live in fear, we’re living in 2022 and we still have such people in India. \n\nTLDR: My friend was abused by her friend’s relative and we couldn’t take legal actions against him as he is some politician of Gwalior.

      <li>Title::: 'Discussion on rising oil prices and inflation'<br />Body: 'As we all witness oil prices are rising globally and want to share some thoughts.\n\n1) Why it happened?\n- Companies dialed down production to protect themselves during covid, supply chain issues and sudden rise in demand.\n- Second more important factor: US printing money like there is no tomorrow. The world runs on US dollar and it is not pegged to gold hence US has the power unlike any other country to "create money". All the covid cheques, and trillions of dollars in US market meant \nUSD lost a bit of its value and US exported inflation.\n- Third Ukraine war affecting oil and food prices. Creating uncertainty in the world.\n\n\n\n2) How does India stack up against the world?\nSurprisingly India is doing better than almost every nation including the US in terms of inflation. Basic gyan developing countries have inflation whereas developed countries have a very very low inflation. American savings account offer 0.1% interest rate compared to higher rates in India or other developing countries\n\n- US inflation hit 8.5%, something which never happened since 1980s. Unlike Indian white collar jobs, US companies used to hand our 3-5% yearly hikes since inflation was almost always less than 2%.\nhttps://apnews.com/article/us-inflation-rate-historic-high-4ba3435cc3730198e299690a9d968038\n\n- Forex status of our neighbors:\nForex  disasters in Pakistan, Nepal and sri Lanka. Our Forex reserve fell by 30% as well but nothing like surrounding countries.\n\n- Inflation in the south asian region:\nIndia at 7%, Pakistan at 12% and Sri Lanka at 19%\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/14/indias-central-bank-pivots-focus-from-growth-to-fighting-inflation-as-prices-rise.html\nIndia\'s inflation at 6.95%\n\n\nJust stating things are bad everywhere they just suck a little bit less in India.

      <li>Title::: 'Confessions of a male rape victim'<br />Body: "Man here. Sometime ago a user posted on a different sub about their experience as a victim in high school from a classmate. Seeing this, I'm now willing to open up mine.\n\nFirst attempt (during my highschool days by a male classmate):\n I used to have a bitter tussle with a classmate of mine, say A. In a couple of days it cooled down. A told me the best way to make amends was accept what he wanted to do. I was eager to become friends again after he made repeated apologies to me. But what he did next was something I'll never forget. \n\n\nA period before lunch break, he wanted us to cut classes. Then we went to the restroom. He hadn't yet told me what it was yet. Then he tells me what he's gonna do would give a very bad name for me and my family if exposed. And he went on to talk about how the police will spit on you, etc. I began to feel uncomfortable. We had to then lock ourselves in a restroom and I was shaking when he asked me to remove my pants and underwear. He told me it will only take a few minutes before it'll be all over. I was scared and shut my eyes tight (he asked me to because I was too scared). \n\n\nIn a few minutes it was all over, nobody else saw anything, save an assistant who walked to the restroom and he convinced him that I was sick and was vomiting and he was merely 'helping out' before he convinced the attendant to leave. I felt him doing the 'sex' when he stroked my body up and down. It's been like 10 years since and remains an unforgettable memory. Years later a lecturer, who happened to be a child rights activist, gave a long lecture on rape and sexual assault. She happened to include confessions and instances of male victims in her long speech. I told her of my experience and it seemed though she was very familiar with male victims as well as she wasn't very surprised when I narrated my experience. She is the only one who knows of this, nobody else does. \n\n\nA second possible attempt (by a woman co-worker):\n\nA second possible attempt happened in 2019 when I was working at a company. A woman, who also worked for the same company me was a frequent visitor to my boss's office. She always seemed to have an intense liking and respect for me. She was trusted by my boss and respected by others as well. I was mostly occupied with my work so she never found time until that day. I too was resting, waiting for orders. She came up to me and struck up a conversation with me. \n\n\nShe then whispered to me that she felt 'aroused' and badly wanted to have sex with me, and that I could fuck her everyday if I employed her as a domestic help. Just then my boss was coming towards me with some orders when she changed the conversation and began to speak rather loudly that she was looking for a side job and she was looking for extra income. My boss heard nothing, and things were back to normal again. However the clerk was a bit suspicious seeing the changed expression on my face. I waved her off stating it was nothing unusual. But she always seemed suspicious of the former.\n\n\nBut in the following days she had her eyes set on me. She was watching me work and I happened to notice it too. But I began to feel more and more uncomfortable as the days passed and I quit my job straightaway."<br />Author: 'DefiantDeviantArt'  id: 'u3mkud'<br />Score:138<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/u3mkud/confessions_of_a_male_rape_victim/</li>

      <li>Title::: "US organization's activities against India"<br />Body: '"Our survey of US-based South Asian Studies has revealed a very strong pro-Islamic bias. Hindus and the Indian government are blamed in all sorts of issues concerning Indian Muslims and issues of terrorism in India. Various Islamic advocacy groups in the United States nurture such scholars, and provide forums and mechanisms to bring them together with affiliates in India. 79 An example of a prominent lobbyist influencing the US academy is the Indian Muslim Council. \n\nThe Indian Muslim Council (IMC) is a US-based advocacy group for Indian Muslims. One of its most local leaders, Kaleem Kawaja, has been openly sympathetic to the Taliban, even after 9/11. 80Yet, IMC is successful in influencing US government policies on India. 81 It takes up anti-India stands on issues like Kashmir, and Kawaja writes in Pakistani magazines comparing Kashmir to Kosovo and East Timur. 82 IMC’s keynote speakers 83 at its high profile conferences have included Lise McKean (described earlier in this chapter), and Congressman John Conyers, an important liberal Democrat who joined right-wing Republicans to pass a resolution condemning India for ‘violations of religious freedom’. 84\n\n At IMC’s 2008 annual conference in the US, Tarun Tejpal, founder and head of Tehelka magazine, delivered the keynote, highlighting the oppression of many minority groups in India, including the Muslims, Dalits, tribals and Christians. 85 At the conference, Angana Chatterji was awarded the ‘Tipu Sultan’ award. PIFRAS, a radical Christian right-wing group (discussed in Chapter Thirteen), participated to show solidarity against their common enemy. 86\n\n In 2008, IMC arranged an American lecture tour for the activist Teesta Setalvad, whose international fame was based on supplying atrocity literature about claims of Hindu rioters ripping open a pregnant Muslim woman and throwing her fetus into the fire. However, the Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India to probe those communal riots refuted the veracity of this account. Many riot victims said that Setalvad had made them sign the affidavits written in English (which they did not understand) to exaggerate the violence. 87\n\n In the wake of the Mumbai terror attacks of 2008, IMC’s press release related the episode to ‘ethnic cleansing and targeting of minorities, police harassment and scapegoating of innocent civilians and fake encounter killings’ in India. 88\n\n Western transnational groups and their India-based associates regularly come together to share intelligence. For example, in 2008 a study on ‘Hindu Nationalist Organizations in Social and Political Context’ was conducted under the Special Assistance Program of University Grants Commission (a Government of India body) in collaboration with the Indian Council of Social Science Research, New Delhi. Some of the scholars and institutions (including foreign institutions) had a very clear evangelical bias. This illustrates how several liberal-left postcolonial scholars, who claim to be against US intervention, have been effectively co-opted. There are several causes, which include the lure of academic prestige, underlying Eurocentric bias in the social sciences, and a benign perception of multinational religious institutions operating in India.

      <li>Title::: 'Islam - the issue for Indians, both Hindus and Muslims'<br />Body: 'I see an increasing level of polarization between Muslims and Hindus in India. Whilst the communal tension between these two factions are not new - it has taken a more systemic, national, value based form of rift. I think this is not only the evolution of Islam globally, but also the emerging identity of Hindus that is causing this. Unfortunately, I don’t see a peaceful end in sight. \n\nHere are some thoughts to structure the issue - \n1. There are almost 1.8b Muslims globally. There are closely tied into a religious identity of Ummah, that surpasses the national identities\n2. 1.46B of these Muslims live in countries that either are outright Islamic or they are the majority community there. This includes 55 countries that have 51% or more muslim population as per their census. These countries are shariah compliant or have a state religion of Islam. Their civil courts, constitution and social laws are built around Quran and Islamic tenets.\n3. Another 88M live in the countries where they control the political bodies through 20-50% population representation. This means that they have a substantial say in the civil law, state religion and social conduct. This is another 16 countries.\n4. Then there are 350M that live in 110 countries with less than 20% population, of which 200M are in India. That means about 150M are spread in 109 countries in small percentage of overall populations. These are the countries where Muslim people have recently migrated to and as a result the body of population is generally well educated and most people are moderates. These are the states where the co-existence and secularism is upheld as a model for other countries to emulate. UK, Canada, France, US and other OECD countries with tough and selective migration rules have allowed recently migration of Muslims allowing for up to 3% of their population to be Muslim.\n5. At the same time there has been a recent wave of awareness of the Islamic brotherhood globally, whether it was Al Qaeda or ISIS, increasingly the message of persecution of Islam by the western powers is coming to the foremost conscious of young Muslims. Whether they use Palestine or Afghanistan or Iraq - the narrative has been strongly built around the fact that Western Powers have oppressed the Muslims and the age old crusades continue today, in a different form.\n6. Rise of Salafism and Wahhabism since 1975 - when Mecca was taken under siege and Saudis reverted back to more stringent Wahhabi form of religion - has further strengthened this movement. The radicalism has gone completely exclusionary, monotheistic which means increasingly the ability to coexist with other belief systems has become diminished.\n7. Since 1975, there has also been rise of two factors - increased funding to spread the theology of Salafism from Saudis to Asia and Africa as well as rise of their economies which has meant more Asian Muslims working and living in the GCC. Both factors mean that spread of this extremist and exclusionary monotheistic theology has been rapid - especially in the subcontinental region.  \n8. The concept of secularism constructed for India started to wear thin, as it did globally. There is limited understanding of what that actually means in practice and unfortunately not very consistently practiced in the most countries. At the very least it means the separation of church / religion and state and in the strictest sense it means excision of religion from public discourse and pushing it strictly into private domain. India has done little on both ends of it. \n9. Increasingly the majority feels aggrieved about what they see as being preferential treatment being meted out to the minorities. The vote bank politics aggravated their sense of being victimized in their own country. Additionally, having now been exposed to the global reality of religious affairs, more Hindus started realizing that the only country where they potentially have any control over the social construct and civil laws that even remotely represent their values and beliefs is India. Not being able to do so in the only country where they exist in substantial numbers - further aggravated the general sentiment of resentment. There are other factors as well - the way the country was designed from conception, the interests of minorities - both Hindus (SC/ST/ OBC), Muslims and others were protected from what was perceived by the founding fathers to be powerful majority of upper caste Hindus. This today becomes debatable and in many peoples views is a gross injustice being meted out to them.\n10. Muslims want to hold the country to a this dissatisfactory standard of secularism and the government / political parties don’t have the necessary political will to rectify this issue.\n11. Any correction to this status quo creates a ruckus that is quickly visible on the global stage - which then further undermines the political will within the country\n12.The Ummah comes together well to create a persecution narrative which is hard to counter for an isolated population of Hindus. Furthermore, a substantial number of Hindus in India only ever encounter the moderate Muslims that have assimilated into the communities. There lack of exposure to the “Muslim Areas” where hardline philosophies are espoused, propagated and practiced remains invisible to them. This means the there is no single voice of Hindus - it is fragmented between liberals and conservative Hindus\n\nWhat is the solution? I guess this is why BJP is so popular! They have shown political will and have made some changes. But event they are not willing to engage on a full scale conversation of secularity. It is inevitable that in the end India has to address the issue of secular state and what it means.'<br />Author: 'distantindian'  id: 'u32dvp'<br />Score:39<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/u32dvp/islam_the_issue_for_indians_both_hindus_and/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Unpopular opinion : Population exchange might have brought peace in sub-continent'<br />Body: "It's very much worrying that tensions between Hindus and Muslims increasing day by day in our country. After the rise of Hindutva goons its getting escalated each day to a point where even an internal war in some regions seems to be around the corner in the future.\n\nEventhough these things getting escalated after Modi won the elections it not like Hindus and Muslims are living in Harmony before that . Hindus and Muslims are warring for nearly a millennium. Hindus and Muslims of sub-continent differs in every aspect. Even if we take our history who ever Hindus considers as oppressor are heroes for Muslims. (Ghori,Aurangazeb,Ghazni ....). Both follows completely unrelated religion and doctrines (Polytheist vs Strictly monothiest). So eventhough we share a common language and culture our paths are completely different in every aspect. To be more precise a more devotional Muslim should connect to the brotherhood of a Palestine or Saudi Muslim than his Hindu counterpart in his locality. \n\nBy saying these I always thought about few things.\n\nThought 1:  Population exchange in North India\n\nI always thought about why our founding fathers didn't consider about population exchange. Atleast population exchange should have been happened in Northern states, where religion plays a strong affiliation in their way of life. Yeah I know how gruesome it was during partition but on the brighter side we have to see how many lives would have been saved if exchange was done. Tens of thousands of people died in hindu Muslim conflict in independent india. Nearly a million people died in 1971 Bangladesh genocide (most of the brutality was targeted towards Bengali hindus), countless Hindus Sikhs murdered in independent pakistan. If exchange would have happened these brutal incidents might have been averted. Actually 10-20 million people migrated during the partition without any govt support, if Govt would have supported and utilized its large resources it could have helped other tens of millions more to migrate across the borders. If this happened then India pakistan might made some agreements on kashmir where Muslim majority goes to pakistan and Hindu Buddhist majority goes to India.\nIt would have brought total peace in Sub continent and Strong Ind-Pak frienship.\n\nEven Ambedhkar suggested the same and cited the population exchange which happened between Turkey- Greece. But Nehru and Gandhi choose emotions instead of being pragmatic. Can give some points to Jinnah in this regard. He did foresee what gonna happen.\n\nThought 2: Strong enforcement of Secularism\n\nIf our founding fathers didn't wanted to take that harsh way of population exchange and wanted Hindus and Muslims to live in harmony atleast they should cemented our constitution in way a that our country would never fall in the hands of religious bigots. They should have outright banned all political parties and  groups with religious and casteist agendas. A law should have been made where it is a criminal offense to ask votes by polarizing people.\n\nSince our founding father Nehru was Secular and had socialist view he should have made huge efforts to reduce the religious extremism and to bring both Hindus and Muslims towards atheism or atleast to a point where they can take criticism and start questioning their religion. Lol even today we have some regressive laws that can send a person to jail if he criticize a religion. In this regard USSR did a commendable job, it transformed many Islamic republics very liberal and the same incase of Turkey's Ataturk.\n\nWithout doing any of these can you imagine what Nehru would have thought in 1947 ?( Yeah whatever..We are witnessing hindu,Sikhs Muslims killing each other brutally. Without analyzing the root cause for this mess just put them again in the same situation and nothing can go wrong, right?) He just had one major task to do. Just make the country foundation stronger by reducing religious extremism. But he and his family successors failed big-time here. He gravely miscalculated that Hindutva is a dead cause and it won't became a huge force in the future. Without making the foundation stronger there is no use in doing other things. Whatever built on top of that would fall like a pack of cards.\n\nWell whatever happened we can't change. Ours and older generation is already radicalised to point where it is difficult to explain them. Our only hope is future generation. Only way to get out of this mess is too bring the people from different extreme religious doctrines to a central point (Science). Seriously school education should be giving high values in teaching about Evolution, Origin of Universe.

Wouldn't say shit about state sanctioned pedophilia among muslims in India\n2. Think India is a secular country. Refuse to say anything about masjids and church not being under government control. Wouldn't say anything about extra provisions for minorities.\n3. Think citizens of this country can starve to death and lose jobs while illegal rohingyas should be allowed (While being kicked out of bangladesh and myanamar, Both Islamic states) in the name of humanity. \n4. Think Hindus aren't in danger but haven't ever been to kashmir or pakistan or bangladesh where a Hindu can be killed for blasphemy.\n5. Thinks BJP is a communal party while TMC calls to break India (100s of Thousands of people died in India during partition) and AIMIM Party calls for beheading of people\n6.

Still chastise Hindus for caste system but don't criticize Islam and Christianity for dealing in astronomical levels of slavery, wiping out entire civilizations and religious persecution among many other barbaric evils committed.\n9. Think atheists in India are under danger and live as second class citizens just because beef is banned while atheist get killed for blasphemy or even just existing in Islamic countries\n10. Think Hindu religion is full of superstition but believe in karma and zodiac signs. \n11. Think Congress was formed to give India independence without knowing they were british stooges with their leaders insulting freedom fighters in the 1857 mutiny and wanted Britishers to continue to rule them.\n12. Blame India for its high population without checking Muslim birth rate in India.\n13.

Criticize every Hindu festival as backward or a threat to the environment but don't point a finger at other festivals\n16. Fail to see why everyone in the world is hostile to muslims be it hindus, buddhists, christians or even secular countries like france. Scream Islamophobia and call everyone fascist instead of seeing the main cause which is political Islam\n17. Think eliminating Hinduism from India will make it a better place. Don't know Islam will take over India and treat them like second class citizens. Kill them over tearing off mohommad stickers. \n18. Aim for open borders allowing anyone from any country inside while people in the country don't have jobs and are starving. When these immigrants start raping their woman and burning their houses they blame citizens for going to immigrant settles areas for being raped and getting their property burnt or being outright killed.\n19. Think a person is a transphobe if he refuses to date a trans person. A person is a racist if they refuse to date a black or white person. Their chimp brains incapable of understanding it's the person's choice and they don't have any right to judge people on how they want to spend their life.\n20. Think we should make unisex bathrooms to accommodate trans people. This means allowing men and women to use the same bathrooms. Think men should be allowed to compete in women sports championships and avail scholarships for women if they identify as a woman.\n21.

Fire people and label them communal and destroy their career for being islamophobic but champion and sponsor Hinduphobia calling it as a fight against hindutva.\n24. Think instances of Hindus eating beef in ancient India proves that cows aren't sacred to hindus despite it being said clearly in Hindu sacred texts. Make every bit of an effort to get that included in textbooks in India to hurt religious sentiments of hindus. Don't talk about Allah and God being pagan words adopted by Abrahamic Religions. Don't talk about sex slavery being practiced by Christians and Muslims. \n25. Think supporting Hinduism and criticizing Islam means being a modi supporter. \n26. Don't know that 99% of terrorist organizations fight for Islam. Still say terrorists have no religion. Become complete hypocrites when they call every bjp and rss worker hindutva terrorists.\n27. Live in privilege without knowing how minorities are treated in Islamic states. Think Hijab is empowering.\n28. Try to justify rape and hide rape cases by Islamic grooming gangs in their country so they don't appear communal. Choose to support pedophiles and rapists instead of pointing out crimes by Muslims just so they can be politically correct.\n29. Think it's fine if 1000s of Hindu girls are raped and converted in Muslim countries every year. Think making special provisions for easier access to citizenship for these prosecuted minorities is being communal. And outright 'villainous'. Living in privilege in their homes while not knowing anything about the pains of being raped or being abducted and married off to a Muslim man.\n30. Refuse to see how bollywood has become urduwood. Every Bollywood actor has been known to mock Hinduism on screen or praise Allah. \n31. Haven't read a single Hindu scripture. Become the figurehead for all Hindus when a muslim is oppressed. Stay silent on attacks against hindus.\n32. Think it's okay to mock hindus under the garb of hindutva. Think mocking Islam is communal and fascist\n33. Think all the crimes by muslims is because of culture instead of a religious dogma. Refuse to see clear signs of crimes committed by muslims invoking the name of Islam in every corner of the world.\n34. Think ram mandir trust should be used for welfare of people. Think people should make hospitals instead of temples. Refuse to say anything about waqf board or people creating masjids and churches all around India\n35. Show their utter idiocy and lack of brain cells when they compare polytheistic and Abrahamic religions together. Don't know how they differ completely.\n36. Are quick to list crimes by other religions under news reports of crimes by people holding Islamic ideologies. Refuse to do the same for other religions. \n37. Fail to raise voices for making Islamic states secular. \n38. Cry tears and make a million posts for hijab ban in France. Stay silent on concentration camps for Muslims in China.\n39. Will cry tears over BLM. Black athletes making public announcements in support of BLM. The same black athlete refuses to cut ties off with Chinese companies sponsoring him to protests against concentration camps for Muslims in China.\n40. Think murderers and rapists should be given lower life sentences. Cry human rights violations for such monsters. \n41. Will support communism despite it having killed more people than world wars.\n42. Think speaking English is a sign of being educated. Don't know it's a basic language and absolutely pathetic compared to scholarly languages like Sanskrit.\n43. Think speaking Hindi is backward. Lick white boots and seek white validation. Think criticizing Hindu practices like Karwa Chauth is being progressive and cool.\n44. Think India didn't exist before British rule. Have no Idea India was culturally connected for thousands of years having been unified under several empires before the Britishers like Mauryas, Gupta-Vakatas.\n45. Think India isn't a Hindu country because allegedly aryans 'invaded' India thousands of years ago. Fail to see that logic applies to every other country geographically defined today. All cultures country claim as their own has been brought to them by invaders\n46. Think Indians were backward and peasants in the past while Europeans were advanced. Have no idea Europeans lived in poor conditions in the past and were barbarians while Indians were civilized booming with trade and having vast amount of resources.\n47. Goes abroad to see a broken colosseum calling it a technological marvel. Fails to see the culmination of human artistry and skill in Kailash Ellora Temple in his own country.\n48. Thinks temples are useless failing to see the welfare causes and donations they make for people all throughout India.\n49. Thinks Islamic invaders were not religious bigots and writes 1000s of books trying to prove that without reading the 100s of contemporary accounts by the same invaders where they are overcome with extreme tears of joy at killing Hindus and making their women their sex slaves. Such barbaric Muslim mentality isn't found anywhere else in the world. Nobody else in known history has been so proud or happy at killing and torturing other people and razing their temples to the ground than followers of these abrahamic religion whose dicks these liberals are sucking now.\n50.

Do Pakistan would give subsidie for hindus to go on Vaishno Devi mandir? In india during muslim religious festivals masjids are protected by policemen irrespective of their religion. But during Ram navmi no such protection. Muslims have Their own Law board!!!! Which is inspired by sharia law. But do hindus have such own law?

A ruler from Uzbekistan, relative of mongols, Babar attacked india and break hindu temples. Even one of the holy places of hindus Ram mandir, and built Babri Masjid. Islam does not allows Muslims or even non Muslims under Shariah law, to destroy any house of worship of any religion at any cost. Hence breaking of ram mandir is against islam. Hence allah would himself want to replace that fake building (not true muslim building cause i mentioned) with the ram mandir and show peace.\n\n&gt;caa nrc\n\nThe full form of CAA is “Citizenship Amendment Act“.

      <li>Title::: 'Why we need to be cautiously optimistic about our country'<br />Body: "This post isn't to say that we don't have ongoing problems in our country but to lay down facts, problems &amp; the need to stay cautiously optimistic about our country's future.\n\nFirst off, let me start by dismissing the argument that we are heading toward an economic crisis like that of Sri Lanka's:\n\n* Sri Lanka has a[ history](https://fortune.com/2022/04/09/sri-lanka-debt-crisis-inflation-rajapaksa-protest-imf-ukraine/) of bad debt. Many of its costly infrastructure projects have been economic duds, and without any genuine source of revenue, the Sri Lankan government is left unable to repay the interest on its loans. On top of that, the pandemic hit them hard &amp; on top of top of that, their government mandated a shift to organic farming.\n* Sri Lanka's FDI investments were on a downhill since 2018. India's, on the other hand, are[ growing](https://www.ibef.org/economy/foreign-direct-investment) consistently and it's expected to go up at an accelerating rate in the incoming years.\n* Sri Lanka's foreign reserves have gone down[ significantly](https://tradingeconomics.com/sri-lanka/foreign-exchange-reserves) over the years. India's foreign reserves have been[ going up](https://www.statista.com/statistics/802050/india-value-of-foreign-exchange-reserves/) consistently.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's look at some of the problems we are facing at the moment:\n\n* Russia-Ukraine crisis: This war has taken a toll on every country, but the poorest suffer the most. This war is unlikely to last very long but it's definitely causing short-term pain to our country's population.\n* Inflation: Pandemic, followed by a war, and global supply chain issues have caused inflation to skyrocket and I'm sure no one's enjoying having to pay higher prices. Though RBI recently[ announced](https://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-prioritising-inflation-over-growth-now-shaktikanta-das/articleshow/90722463.cms) that they'll be prioritising inflation over growth, but to me, it seems like there are major factors at play here that no one can really control.\n* COVID: The virus is extremely unpredictable, now, we do have a good vaccination rate, but it's not impossible for a mutation to bypass the vaccine's immunity. So let's hope that never happens.\n* Women in workforce: India has performed[ poorly](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-india-is-no-country-for-working-women-explainspeaking-7249928/) when it comes to women in workforce. For India to become a more productive country, it *needs* women in the industry. India has almost as many women as there are men, it's obvious-- the amount of untapped potential we have.\n* Internal Conflicts: For a country to function optimally, it needs to minimise its internal conflicts. This not only makes it a good place to live but also an attractive investment destination. This one is harder to measure, and most of it is politically induced and unpredictable.\n* Border conflict with China: Full-on invasion of India, like that of Ukraine, is extremely unlikely, both India and China are[ nuclear](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2021/07/28/the-countries-with-the-biggest-nuclear-arsenals-infographic) &amp;[ military](https://www.statista.com/chart/20418/most-powerful-militaries/) superpowers. Both sides are aware of the low rewards and high risk of such actions. An increase in border tensions is more likely here.\n\nWith our increasing dependence on technologies that let you instantly access information, you'll find yourself consuming more and more negative news &amp; speculations, and with advancements in suggestion AIs that bump up more articles of the sorts that grab the most attention, it's almost impossible to go by a day and not come across something worrying. When things seem shaky, the key is to not let yourself fall for the 'speculations' and stick to the absolute facts. Worrying will not get you anywhere, seeking solutions will.\n\nAs a country, we'll be making many mistakes on our way, and for a quick rebound, focus on strengthening our fundamentals is essential:\n\n* Education\n* Technology\n* Competitiveness\n* Economic output\n* World Trade\n* Military Strength\n* Reserve Currency\n\nLet's hope things get better and keep working for a better future :)"<br />Author: 'sleepymusk'  id: 'u2l1d1'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/u2l1d1/why_we_need_to_be_cautiously_optimistic_about_our/</li>

Your annual income is below 5 lakhs. 5 lakhs is the threshold for taxable income so you dont qualify as tax paying citizenry.\n2. You feel that you are not getting the services commensurate with the tax you pay. i.e \n   1. your roads are not smooth and wide. \n   2. your city/town sanitations system is not good.\n   3. electricity is not regular and reliable. \n3. You think that why you should pay for the salary of those who exploit you i.e\n   1. Government officers who demand bribe for simple tasks\n   2. Police who treats civilians like trash \n4. You feel that all of your earning is due to your own hard work, you worked hard 9 to 7pm, you earned by sweat and blood,  so there was no contribution of society in it. So you have no responsiblity to pay tax on income.\n5. You feel that cost of basic necessity is so high such as education and health so you must save money. So, tax avoidance and evasion seems reasonable option. \n6. You see income inequality around you. You see businessmen/women evading taxes in news and around u .  Therefore you feel that \n   1. it is how people become rich\n   2. if they are not caught then why you should fear. \n7. The procedures to file taxes is so complex for you that you avoid it. \n8. You have made peace with the fact that if tax authorities ever raid your house you can evade it by paying bribe to judge and police. So you intentionally dont pay tax. \n9. You know that tax authorities will never raid your house because your tax liability is too small.

      <li>Title::: 'A rational take on the LANGUAGE debate that is going on right now.'<br />Body: 'Lately there has been a lot of heated arguments on the alleged HINDI imposition. I would like to point out the following.\n\n1.**There southern politics/obsession around language -** There is a narrative that has been created created by politicians in the south that all of the northern states have Hindi as their mother tongue and they want to impose that on the southern states. Which is just no true. If you really look at it Delhi, parts of U.P, Uttarakhand and M.P  only these places have Hindi as their mother tongue all other states like Haryana, Bihar, Rajasthan, Gujrat, Himachal, Punjab etc have their own distinct languages which might be some what similiar to Hindi lik Haryanvi or Bhojpuri or very different like Rajasthani or Gujrati but unlike the southern states people are fine using Hindi as a common language to communicate with one another or even using each others languages for the same because at the end of the day language is juts a tool for communication but the politicians in the south have made this a deal of identity. I understand that it is difficult for a Tamil person to understand Hindi but does he has the same deal of difficulty in understanding Telegu? still they will refuse to listen to it. In short they are not able to have a common language of their own and also are not willing to communicate in each others languages which makes a unique language problem in southern India.  \n\n\n**The English Argument -** A argument that is made quite often by the supports of this language poltics in the south is that we should use English as a common language and not Hindi while the northern people or common language supporters in the south argue that why we would use the language of the colonizers rather than the language of our own nation that is Hindi. Both of these arguments are problematic. First of all the argument regarding not using the language of the colonizers i.e English is that it is the language of the internet and technology.  Most of the world knowledge is available in the English language and translation is neither feasible nor helpful in certain cases. Not using a language just because it is not native to us is falling to the same language identity problem especially when that language has a lot of benefits in the modern world.\n\nThe problem with the argument of using English as the sole common language falls on its face because the actual matter of the fact is that not a lot of Southerners do not actual know English or at least do not know that English which any native English speaker shall recognise as English or language for that matter. What they actually know is very broken English that anyone who knows proper English will find jarring to listen and understand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Imposing HINDI as the official language -** In the light of all of the above facts I think that is neither right or productive to declare Hindi as the official language instead people from all states should be made aware of the benefits of having a common language so they accept Hindi as an bharatiye language and not as an alien language being imposed on them while we should not discriminate against anyone who does not know Hindi.'<br />Author: 'sir_abhishek'  id: 'u1ti7z'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/u1ti7z/a_rational_take_on_the_language_debate_that_is/</li>

AFAIK  there are two check-ins that you have to do, one for yourself and for  your baggage. Right? And also does web check-in and baggage check-in  goes hand in hand online or do you have to check-in online and do a  baggage check-in at the airport? Or are both possible?\n3. I  remember reading somewhere on the internet that you can just walk into  an airport and buy tickets. Is that possible? What documents do you have  to show when you walk into an airport? Do you have to walk in into a  specific terminal if you want tickets right there? (I have always booked  online but I am curious to know as to how it would work in person and  also the last time I went to the airport we were asked for a photo-ID  and a ticket)\n\nAnd also some questions regarding international flights which I have never been on.\n\n1.

From NE to West to South. It technically ALREADY is unofficially, the national language.\n\n* F.e - if kannada was the most spoken or understood language across the country, then i\'d say the same for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo other indian language has that level of reach across the country. This is reality. Getting offended is pointless. English is NOT an indian language and is hardly understood across the country, so please don\'t bring it up.\n\n* Hindi "imposition" ≠ Abandoning regional language or mother tongue. Imposing you to learn a new language doesn\'t mean being forced to leave your native tongue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA common indian language, well understood across the country, will only help everyone, politicians and civilians alike. You don\'t HAVE to use it ALL the time. Only when you need to, like a useful tool.\n\n* We CAN manage just fine without "Hindi imposition", but a common interface does help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA language is a valuable skill. I\'ve lived in 9 states in different regions of India and learnt 5 local languages passively. Can speak more but not so well.\n\n* I\'m SUPPOSED to be a southie, but after so much time spent everywhere from childhood to adulthood, i simply identify as indian, not south indian or north indian. It is what it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#Finally - \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I\'ve seen Tibetan, Assamese, Punjabi, Gujarati, etc all kinds of people learn the local language anywhere in South without any hassle, for their businesses. Because it\'s common sense.\n\nI know for a fact some northerners have a ridiculous superiority complex issue and even bully southerners for no apparent reason. I\'ve seen it for decades. Kindly curb it down or discourage others from doing it. Haven\'t noticed this behavior in southerners expect a few times in Chennai, first seen back in 2009.\n\n* Northerners SHOULD learn a few regional languages and observe their local traditions. It helps. Besides, learning a language is fun and insightful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom what i\'ve seen, Southerners going to northern states on work or business, do usually adapt. If they don\'t, no matter how much they communicate in English, it won\'t always be optimal. \n\n* It\'s up to you if you WILLINGLY want to handicap yourself. I don\'t and am glad.\n* Heck I\'ve seen a Dutch old man in Vizag, learn Hindi and Telugu, BOTH, for having the best possible outreach to his business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone knows regional or national political parties usually needlessly rile up civilians over this issue. Amit Shah laid a funny and cunning trap, and the regional political entities are NEEDLESSLY walk right into it. Give it time and you\'ll understand.\n\n* Regional political parties need a boogeyman to stay in power. That boogeyman is shown to the public as BJP, despite both being just regular political parties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#Kindly discuss but please try to keep away personal attacks from each other.\n\n\\#So what do you think ?

      <li>Title::: 'How India-Israel ties went from cold shoulder to warm embrace'<br />Body: 'Narendra Modi’s affinity with Israel is based on a blend of ideological pedigree and national interests. And propitious geopolitical shifts have facilitated the momentum. \n\nThe Abraham Accords normalizing relations between Israel and a number of Arab states eased India’s weaning process from walking the usual tightrope in formulating its West Asia policy. The new Middle Eastern ‘Quad’ – a strategic group of the U.S., India, Israel, and the UAE – opens avenues for both sides to enhance strategic interaction.  \n\nThere are instructive markers for this changed course. \n\nFirst, as the first Indian prime minister to visit Israel, in July 2017, Modi chose to skip Ramallah to signal dehyphenation, the extrication and separation of India’s relationship between Israel and the Palestinians. He reinforced this message by not overflying Israeli air space en route to Ramallah the following year. Assessing ties with Israel on its own merits is a crucial makeover for New Delhi. \n\nSecondly, as part of its balancing political act at multilateral organizations, India has usually reiterated its desire for a two-statesolution, coupled with a wish for East Jerusalem to be Palestine’s capital. In 2016, India formally dropped that demand at the UN; it was also absent in Modi’s remarks during Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ 2017 visit to New Delhi. \n\nIndia has maintained that position since, signalling further its disinterest in provoking Israel by abstaining from a UN Human Rights Council vote calling for an inquiry into Israeli actions during last summer’s conflict with Hamas.\n\nThirdly, although agri-tech and the arms trade currently constitute the lion’s share in bilateral, that conventional lens for viewing Israel – as a partner solely in defense and agriculture – has been superceded. Both sides are actively exploring cooperation possibilities in cybersecurity, water conservation, traditional medicines, film production, space technology, and innovation. \n\nThese favorable outcomes are also underwritten by tremendous strategic patience on the Israeli side. Weapons sales and agricultural aid were considered long-term equities that would, eventually, pay off. Despite Tel Aviv’s aid to India in times of adversity, it was never dispirited at India’s lack of political reciprocity. \n\nWhen India used to closely hew to the Arab bloc and no diplomatic ties were in place, Israel did not hesitate to supply ammunition to India during the 1971 war with Pakistan. Similar help was extended during the Kargil war when India was under U.S. sanctions.\n\n-https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-the-real-story-behind-india-and-israel-s-surprising-alliance-1.10597207\n\n——-\n\n🇮🇱❤️🇮🇳'<br />Author: 'Dry-Basil-3859'  id: 'u1l8hm'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/u1l8hm/how_indiaisrael_ties_went_from_cold_shoulder_to/</li>

What else could they do? Poppet wasn't lasting long enough in bed, and this became a big problem for his wives.\n\nOnce Poppet was visiting a friend with his caravan, and decided to take his favourite wife along. When the caravan reached, young wife had to take a dump and so Poppet sent his young fighter to guard her.\n\nWord got out and locals attacked Poppets caravan. Poppet mounted his horse and ran back home with his caravan.\n\nBUT Poppets wife and the young fighter had to hide behind, and could only come back the following morning. \n\nThe town started gossiping about Poppets favourite wife spending a whole night out with a young fighter, who seemed very pleased with the whole situation and had a big permanent smile on his face thereafter.\n\nThe insecure Poppet was mad with rage. He ordered all his wives to be restricted to Black Tents.\n\nWhen wives wanted to move about, few soldiers had to carry black tents around so no one could see Poppets wives.\n\nThis pissed off a lot of new soldiers who just had to carry Black Tents around instead of actually fighting and looting villages.\n\nThen one of the soldiers designed a smaller Black Tent that can be worn by the wife - it was a genius invention that solved ALL problems. No one could see Poppets wives, his wives could move around freely and soldiers can go back to looting and fighting instead of lifting and shifting Black Tents.\n\nThus, Black Tent Junior was invented.\n\nSome Poppets make their wives wear them even today - but the colours can vary.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the story and found it entertaining and educating. \n\nIf more people like it, I will have more such PoppetStories to share.\n\nThank you for reading."<br />Author: 'mahatmapatha'  id: 'u15txm'<br />Score:41<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/u15txm/poppetstories_black_tent_origins/</li>

The way he gets his work done requires lot of push (labours who works under him). He pays lot of attention to details and understands the mentality of labours (here)- mostly they won't do work properly &amp; ask for money as much as they can (I know which is way lower than what we earn). The point being, they aren't honest to their work so it's very hard for anyone to sympathise. But in the end of the day, that's how everything works in UP East (may be India as well).\n\nI am 28M, live in Bangalore, work in IT &amp; is in top 1% salary bracket. Life is so chilled out here. People are professional, even the support staff. Corporate has its own way of doing things and focusing on (non-) trivial issues like WLB etc. My colleagues have completely different priorities like - should my children study in US or India, swimming lesson etc.\n\nNow here are my questions:\n\n1. **How to deal with such a contrast in Life?** Seems like there's two sides of India. One part you can get the grocery delivered in 10 mins at your doorstep, Other you have to do everything on your own because you live in some shitty place.\n2. **Do I need to be aggressive or professional for my future ahead?** Meanwhile I see lot of my friends moving to US. I don't see the point for me because eventually I have to come here, this professionalism, etiquette goes into dust bin if you're ever planning to live in UP East. We are getting house constructed, it's a nightmare dealing with local labours here. One wedding in my family got ruined because marriage hall owner served shitty food and created scene after drinking (we called police nothing happened) (while I see everyone is getting happily married).*Basically many people are cheaters, they don't give damn about anything (specially in UP).

Infact, it was so close to Christianity and Judaism that people openly mocked his theories and his new religion.\n\nBUT in the last year, poppet changed his tactics and started attacking the other religions in Mecca, since no one was converting to his plagiarised religion except his family.\n\nMeccans had enough and were super pissed off at this intolerance and decided to kill poppet, but he found out from Meccan jaichands and ran away to Medina with his tail between his legs.\n\nAt Medina, he was given "asylum" by unsuspecting locals - Medina at the time was a Christian, Jew and polytheist socieity. They all helped Poppet and his family.\n\n*Poppet was in minority, and was given special privileges by the locals.*\n\nBUT Poppet had nefarious intentions. He soon assembled an army, killed Medina Jews, then Christians, then polytheists, then marched to Mecca and killed his own cousins etc - people had to convert or die.\n\nMore criminals joined Poppet, as they ransaced entire villages - loot was distributed amongst fighter but 1/3rd always went to Poppet. Also, women were enslaved and sold off but the best ones were kept ny Poppet.\n\nPoppet desired a boy unfortunately he never had one. He could only father girls.\n\nPoppet had 14-15 wives and two of them conspired to poison him.

Kids at that age go through the puberty shitstorm, they face mood swings, anxiety about future, they are volatile and they just begin to understand what the real world is at that age and instead of letting them have a proper childhood, give them space and time to figure out their likes and dislikes, they’re forced to make bigass decisions in their life which most kids won’t have the privilege to undo if they wanted to.\n\nIn the west, the kids only have to make such decisions at 18, until then they have a well rounded education and then they write SAT and apply for whatever degree they want. I know that some 15 year olds are super focused and driven and they know exactly what they want in life and that’s great but there’s a lot of kids who don’t.\n\nI chose pcb because I was afraid of math, I was good at 10th grade biology and I watched some cool medical shows. Now i’m in my final year, I regret choosing pcb every fucking day, I’ve to prepare for fucking neet and then get into a medical college for mbbs which is even more stressful, this honestly feels like the final episode of my life, nothing can be done now but I just hope that more kids in the future won’t have to face this crap.\n\nThere was lots of talk about some new education policy a few years ago, idk what happened to it but it honestly sounded like a big step up, I just hope that it gets implemented in the near future, I don’t think i’ll be around to see it and i’m kinda jealous about the kids who’ll get to experience it’s advantages but they totally deserve it, I just hope it happens soon.'<br />Author: 'bjorkssitar'  id: 'u11uqr'<br />Score:46<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/u11uqr/why_the_fuck_are_1516_year_olds_in_this_country/</li>

India abstained itself from the voting of any decisions and encouraged diplomacy. What is diplomacy? Diplomacy is to ensure that the relations of two big nations are peaceful and resolved peacefully. The Narendra Modi Government is advocating for peaceful dialogue between Russia – Ukraine because war would not lead to any desirable outcome and would result in more unhappiness. Not just happiness, the discord between the two countries will be broken.\n\nAnother milestone in India’s foreign policy is to maintain relationship with Palestine and Israel. India has been balancing the relationship between Israel and Palestine. Ever since PM Modi has been in power, his government has been establishing relationships. PM Modi made a historic visit to Palestine as the first leader of India to visit the Palestine state. But why did Modi visit the Palestine State?\n\nWell, Palestine is backed by the Arab League which comprises of countries whom India has good relations such as Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Egypt. Moreover, India has been an observer state. Therefore, this was necessary for India to balance the ties between Palestine and Israel. Let’s not forget that India imports oils from Saudi Arabia and has its own citizens working in United Arab Emirates.

But what India did next was something that sent to the world: “Don’t you underestimate us and our military.”\n\n([https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/19-minutes-12-jets-3-targets-this-is-what-the-iaf-did-in-pakistan-while-you-were-asleep/articleshow/68164179.cms?from=mdr](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/19-minutes-12-jets-3-targets-this-is-what-the-iaf-did-in-pakistan-while-you-were-asleep/articleshow/68164179.cms?from=mdr))\n\nNarendra Modi tried to reorganize the defense industry which was in shambles. Some of the moves were to organize the 41 Ordinance Factories into 7 DPSUs. The recent conflict shows how vulnerable can a country can be if the army is not self-reliant or organized. By merging the 7 DPSUs, the government ought to improve manufacturing and increase defense exports. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tejas Aircraft performing at Singapore Air Show 2022\\(Picture from https:\\/\\/www.indiatoday.in\\/india\\/story\\/iaf-to-show-off-tejas-fighter-jets-at-singapore-air-show-2022-1912188-2022-02-12\\)](https://preview.redd.it/tpjo6hnwdls81.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8212b3f6a744fd00648b6514c28f6238c00bd8f)\n\nNow, the Tejas Aircraft has received expressions of interests from many countries including Malaysia and Singapore.

In such times, the Tejas aircraft and BrahMos have proven that India is no less in providing not just a military equipment but of a high-quality military equipment packed with advanced technology. The successful BrahMos testing off Balasore, Odisha proved that India is now equipped with a missile which has shaken the entire world and made the world put their lens on India.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Brahmos \\(Picture from Wikipedia\\)](https://preview.redd.it/kxptbexbels81.png?width=3888&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe07d5a09b2491efbfd6e7f5a772ce9b7df62e25)\n\nRecently , India collaborated with Israel to work on quantum technology, specifically Quantum cryptography. This is to help develop secured communication. Quantum technology is a new and upcoming field which is developing faster than other fields. Some of the examples include quantum computing, sensors, cryptography and imaging. This is a step ahead. As I am not an expert in explaining the exact terminologies, I have found a good article that explains it. (Link: https://hbr.org/2021/07/quantum-computing-is-coming-what-can-it-do)\n\nA 2020 article listed some of the items that India has exported to countries.

The Jaffna International Airport is located in Palasy and this is the second international airport in Sri Lanka. Compared to how China mishandled the Hambantota Port which led to the spiral downfall of the economy of Sri Lanka, India sent its technical team to advise the airport authorities on how to upgrade the airport and left the upgrading works to the authorities to do it. ([https://www.ft.lk/opinion/The-Jaffna-International-Airport-Fulfilling-Sri-Lankan-aspirations/14-687772](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/The-Jaffna-International-Airport-Fulfilling-Sri-Lankan-aspirations/14-687772))\n\nUnfortunately , due to the COVID 19 , the airport was shut down but Sri Lanka Finance Minister had approached India PM Narendra Modi where he was assured India will help Sri Lanka open the airport.\n\n**Free Trade Agreements.** \n\nThe Free Trade Agreement is meant to lower the tarrif barriers between two nations and to encourage free flow of goods and services as well as allow tourisms to visit the two countries without any issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[PM Modi and PM Scott Morrison in Virtual Meeting \\(Picture from https:\\/\\/theprint.in\\/diplomacy\\/india-australia-interim-trade-deal-not-in-sight-even-after-pm-modis-summit-with-morrison\\/883012\\/\\)](https://preview.redd.it/imyjkwp2ils81.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b35cbed2cf6aa01ec002b8d344d6ac9b0c3304b)\n\nOne of the recent FTAs concluded was the India-Australia FTA. There was a friction between Canberra and Bejiing which led to the same treatment where sanctions were imposed. With India being the global hub for IT services, pharmaceutical and manufacturing, this FTA is seen as India being an alternative to China. Moreover, whatever transaction costs were incurred before this FTA, those have been either reduced or eliminated. (Refer to Annex 2A and 2B). This will benefit both consumers and the businesses. If the taxes are reduced, the items will be cheaper which will attract more consumers.\n\nLet’s say an Australian Potato costs Rs 120 after all the customs and transaction cost. And let’s say the tarrif was 5%. Now it is 0%.\n\nThis would mean that the potato costs will be Rs 114. \n\nIf India signs more FTAs and concludes more, the exports will improve which will improve the net exports of the GDP component and bring in more revenue for both countries. More revenue for India means they can use the money to upgrade the infrastructure in India and improve the standard of living of Indians.\n\n([https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/both-australia-india-set-to-gain-from-free-trade-agreement-101649357020513.html](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/both-australia-india-set-to-gain-from-free-trade-agreement-101649357020513.html))\n\n**Economic Aid to the Neighbouring Countries**\n\nDid you know India provides economic aid to its neighbours?\n\nIndia has set aside Rs 17,250 crores for the Ministry of External Affairs for development assistance to other countries such as Mauritius, Afghanistan and Nepal.\n\nOne of the projects that caught my eye was Chabahar Port in Iran. This port is a strategic port for India which allows the ships to bypass Pakistan and allow India to get more trade from this port in Iran. Moreover, the location is also strategic and allows a stiff competition between China and India. Moreover, this port is also significant in India-Iran-Afghanistan Partnership. During the COVID pandemic, essential items and vaccines from India went through this port to be shipped to other ports.\n\n[Chabahar Port in Iran. \\(https:\\/\\/thediplomat.com\\/2019\\/02\\/a-first-afghan-shipment-heads-to-india-via-irans-chabahar-port\\/\\)](https://preview.redd.it/udaf4oh8lls81.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d6d1f6eef2a0dc1d5b1df415d3332fdfdcda31d)\n\nI wonder if India can run this port, why did Sri Lanka offer a port to India to run the operations? Turns out that Sri Lanka Ports Authority actually signed an agreement in 2021 with Adani Group to run a port in the capital, Colombo and the port is next to the Chinese run jetty. This venture is known as Colombo West International Terminal. Adani will run this for 35 years. One key issue is that the Chinese Merchant Ports Holdings operates the Southern Hambantota port. It will be seen how will the Chinese do business alongside a Indian company. \n\n[ Adani signs BOT deal for Colombo Port’s Western Container Terminal  \\(Picture from https:\\/\\/www.ship-technology.com\\/news\\/colombo-port-western-container-terminal\\/\\)](https://preview.redd.it/jckc9ad3nls81.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f83a6990fd7b01271810e5b152e8f37cecc73c7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 4) State’s Intelligence Capabilities.\n\nRecent Kashmir Cyber Attacks :\n\nRecently, many Chinese hackers targeted the Ladakh Power Grid and other power grids in the country. However, it seems India’s intelligence managed to save it and the cyber defense mechanisms had protected the grids from being cyber attacks. \n\n[https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/china-tried-to-hack-power-grid-systems-in-ladakh-thrice-r-k-singh-122040701313\\_1.html](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/china-tried-to-hack-power-grid-systems-in-ladakh-thrice-r-k-singh-122040701313_1.html)\n\nThe case study is not India’s case study. But this happened in Singapore. The case is known as SingHealth Cyber Attacks. The SingHealth Cyber Attack findings mentioned a foreign entity was behind this and the hackers wanted to know what medicine Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was taking. It is clear who was it. And India should ensure that its secrets and personal data of its citizens are not compromised. \n\n([https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/personal-info-of-15m-singhealth-patients-including-pm-lee-stolen-in-singapores-most](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/personal-info-of-15m-singhealth-patients-including-pm-lee-stolen-in-singapores-most))\n\nThe state intelligence is something that is bounded by the Secrets Act. Therefore, there are limited case studies. \n\n# 5) Aid\n\n**Afghanistan Wheat Exports.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Afghan Driver walking on the sacks \\(Picture from https:\\/\\/www.reuters.com\\/world\\/india\\/india-dispatches-first-wheat-aid-shipment-afghanistan-2022-02-22\\/\\)](https://preview.redd.it/62dhvzbeils81.png?width=4572&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d2859a8f5f3df5af45dbb7d6d0cddc5f20eb9d9)\n\nIt is extremely funny that allegedly, Pakistan had formed the Taliban and now the Taliban is attacking Pakistan but instead it is supporting India.

Pakistan had sent wheat too but it was rejected as it was of poor quality. This shows the trust Talibans too have in Modi Government as Modi is seen as a strong leader.\n\n**Russia-Ukraine Conflict: Ukraine Aid**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[NDRF Officers busy in the shipment of aids \\(https:\\/\\/www.hindustantimes.com\\/india-news\\/india-sends-relief-and-med-supplies-to-war-hit-ukraine-101646193995703.html\\)](https://preview.redd.it/90udox62jls81.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff494d8be8fd91890a47a847c8077a93bab6d0bd)\n\nDuring the recent Russia-Ukraine Conflict, India too provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine by providing essential supplies like medicine and food. It shows that India is on standby to help countries regardless of whether they have supported India or not have supported India in any location during any circumstance.\n\n**COVID-19 Pandemic : Brazil** \n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic , Brazil had to face a situation where there was a shortage of vaccine. India donated 2 million vaccines to Brazil. However, this was stopped after some reports emerged that this was done through a corrupted manner and matter was investigated.\n\n**Sri Lankan Economic Crisis 2019-2022**\n\nThe next crisis was the economic crisis in Sri Lanka where India donated many essential supplies like medicine, diesel to power the country and to provide fuel for vehicles.  Sri Lanka has thanked India profusely despite siding with China previously for most of the projects. India under PM Narendra Modi is quick to provide the necessary support to provide Sri Lanka with necessary and essential resources. These resources will help Sri Lanka in recovering back its economy. Essential items like food and power are critical to any country to generate economic activities. \n\n**Food Insecurity Around The Globe**\n\nBesides Sri Lanka, its neighbors find themselves trapped in food insecurity issues. Under the new Food Plan, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution has sponsored the donation of wheat and rice to five countries namely to Yemen, Ethiopia, Syria and Afghanistan.  This is to also complement the UN World’s Food Programme which aims to ensure that the food insecurity in low-income countries is low and since India had surplus of rice, the FCI and Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution decided to donate the surplus to the five above mentioned countries. By doing so, India will be the main exporter of the rice and by providing rice to the countries which have food insecurity, this will strengthen the diplomatic ties between India and the five countries that have been mentioned. This policy is known as Neighbourhood First Responder where India proves to the world that it stands ready to provide humanitarian assistance to any country which is in need. Interestingly, there were reports of godowns overflowing with surpluses which made it feasible.\n\n[S'pore company at centre of Brazil's probe into import of Indian vaccine | The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/spore-company-at-centre-of-brazils-probe-into-import-of-indian-vaccine)\n\n[India’s Foreign Aid Explained - The Borgen Project](https://borgenproject.org/indias-foreign-aid-explained/)\n\n[India starts supplying rice to Sri Lanka in first major food aid - CNA (channelnewsasia.com)](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/india-supplying-rice-sri-lanka-food-aid-2603331)\n\n[As Part of New Food Plan, India to Feed Millions in 4 Nations; Move to Push Diplomatic Outreach (news18.com)](https://www.news18.com/news/india/as-part-of-new-food-scheme-india-plans-to-feed-millions-in-4-countries-move-to-push-diplomatic-outreach-4938812.html)\n\n# 6) Promoting itself (India) a major hub for manufacturing and investment.\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccines – The pandemic might have caused a huge dent on India and led India to the worst recession, but the way India stood in the pandemic was commendable. India itself decided to take action by implementing its own policy: Make In India.\n\nEventually, CoviShield and Covaxin were shipped to other countries like the United Kingdom and given to the low-income countries as well as neighbouring countries like Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. MEA had published the numbers in its own website.\n\n([https://www.mea.gov.in/vaccine-supply.htm](https://www.mea.gov.in/vaccine-supply.htm))\n\nThis cemented India as an alternative to China who also supplied vaccines to the world and India took advantage of its pharmaceutical hub. \n\nSemiconductors is PM Narendra Modi dream where he aspires India to have its semiconductor industry so that it can reduce the dependence on other countries for electronic components. It is hoped that India will cement itself as a semiconductor hub too. By having a semiconductor industry, it can possibly proceed itself into the manufacturing of other products like laptops, mobiles, and other electronic devices. This way, China would not be able to exert its pressure and realise that India is its own competition. Hopefully, Shri Ashwini Vaishnaw sets up a semiconductor industry soon so that we can have Make in India electronic products for exports which we can be proud of. Eventually, we can reduce the import of electronic products and pay exorbitant tariffs and be subjected to the bullying of big nations. Eventually, we can have more revenue also from the sale of electronic items and boost the domestic consumption which can boost GDP.\n\nAnother country that we have maintained excellent tie is Japan. Japan has been helping to fund some of India’s development.\n\nAmong all these, India ensured that its citizens were priority. The Russian Oil imports helped to lower the cost of fuels as the cost of fuels have surged significantly.\n\nIn conclusion, India has shifted its foreign policy from import to “Come to India and invest”. The talents of Indians are a result of why India has become the IT Hub of the World and Pharmaceutical hub of the world. With PM Narendra Modi government trying to improve the local laws and policies, PM Narendra Modi government is trying their best to encourage skill development for the country to push itself for being the alternative to China. The humanitarian assistance also boosts the reputation of India being a country that not just provides investment opportunities but also friend in need whenever help is required.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Links:**\n\nMilitary Section:\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/china-has-fully-militarized-three-islands-in-south-china-sea-us-admiral-says\n\nhttps://www.fortuneindia.com/enterprise/indias-41-ordnance-factories-now-history-merge-into-7-dpsus/106275\n\n[https://m.economictimes.com/news/defence/mega-multi-agency-military-exercise-conducted-in-kutch-to-test-indias-combat-readiness/articleshow/87854774.cms](https://m.economictimes.com/news/defence/mega-multi-agency-military-exercise-conducted-in-kutch-to-test-indias-combat-readiness/articleshow/87854774.cms)\n\n[https://www.financialexpress.com/defence/indo-israel-quantum-technology-collaboration-with-military-focus/2485892/](https://www.financialexpress.com/defence/indo-israel-quantum-technology-collaboration-with-military-focus/2485892/)\n\nEconomic:\n\n[https://www.ship-technology.com/news/colombo-port-western-container-terminal/](https://www.ship-technology.com/news/colombo-port-western-container-terminal/)"<br />Author: 'LankyAcanthocephala3'  id: 'u0dej0'<br />Score:209<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/u0dej0/foreign_policy_of_bhartiya_janta_party_government/</li>

For most of us death of a family member, a friend, a loved one is a woeful yet rare experience isn\'t it, and I am glad that it is, beacuse in doing so it gives us time to move on and get on with our lifes to get to a point where the sands of time washes away the grief of brievment and we are only left with the smiles. \nBut what if the grief is too cosmic to be swept away. No tide too strong, no wind too hard, no fire too hot too take it away to consume it. It remains with thee, It sits in your heart, it flows in your blood, it becomes an inextricable part of your being. It\'s there in every tear, in every smile, in every dream  even when you close your eyes it there and it whispers its dark intensions. \nIt\'s almost been an year since I experienced a time in my life that I want to forget the most yet it seems that I have been reliving it ever since it has happened. Its funny how something I didn\'t know even existed 3 years ago could change our lifes so much. When CoVid broke out in 2020 I was like everyone else learning as we go gently adapting to the new norms, and in my case coming from India the apathetic first wave and a stunted viral count of the variant made me and millions like me cavalier about the virus and its impact. I would hear about cases effecting friends and family and the minor inconveniences they suffered from such as loss of smell, mild fever etc and it boldened my indifference.\nAnyways by the time winter of 2020 rolled in, it brought with it self a sharp decline in cases nationwide so much so that we celebrated and grew unwary of its veneomus objective. \nFast forward couple of months to spring and it was March, people started going out with thier masks on, they forgot about social distancing giving the hidden viper a chance to jump out of its hole and bite, and it bit harder then ever before. We started seeing an unprecedented exponential increase in cases per day.But this time it came with a lethal caveat the fever wasn\'t as mild as before, the inconvenience wasn\'t as little as before. The viral count was incrementally higher than before and it accompanied with it high fever, loss of breath leading to multiple organ failure and ending with loss of life. The case fatality rate increased by every passing day, at its peak there were 370,000 cases "reported cases" per day with a peak of 4,140 "reported deaths" per day. I still remember it was today April 10th 2021 that the law of averages caught up with me. Till then I have been getting few calls from friends and relatives asking for help RE the resources such as oxygen cylinder, getting an hospital bed,  remdesivir etc. But early morning on the 9th I got a call from my friend, let\'s call him K I picked up thinking it\'s one of those  early Saturday morning wassup calls, but he sounded different there was woe in his voice I asked him about and all he said that "P you gotta get me an oxygen cylinder, grandad isn\'t looking all that well and is in desperate need of oxygen and I can\'t find it any where, you gotta help me cause grandma is also looking kinda under the weather and her results won\'t be in till tomorrow". I assured him I will do whatever I can to help him, got of the call and immediately called contact and asked him to set aside a cylinder for me, he did so under protest saying there are more than 100 people standing outside his shop waiting for their turn but considering our long standing relation he will keep one aside for my friend and immediately called K to go and pick it up. \nI remember getting quite a few other calls throughout the day , which as cruel it may sound I don\'t remember very well. What u remember is getting a call from K around evening thinking he just calling me to thank me for the cylinder but I was again surprised when I picked up the call and heard that same woe in his voice and then he told me that his grandmother is also having some breathing trouble and requires another cylinder and I foolishly said I will do whatever I can and asked him about his grandfather, hoping to hear a semblance of good news,and he then with a deep voice said that his condition hasn\'t changed since the morning and he isn\'t looking all to well.\nI again got on call with my contact, assured him its my last time asking for favour but that I need that cylinder ASAP, he said I will get one but for twice the price, I aksed him why he said he is giving me a good price considering how he has been charging upto 5X to others. I remember getting few other calls for assorted reasons during the evening and I remember going to sleep knowing that I have helped everyone to the best of my capabilities. Then I got a call from K around midnight, in my sleeping somber my navity and narcism were in full affect because as soon as I saw his name flashing on my mobile screen I immediately thought that he might be calling me to thank me, I was wrong again cause as soon as I picked up he sounded disjointed and a was on the verge of breaking I asked what was wrong and he told me that both his grandparents aren\'t doing well and the doctor is recommending to hospitalize them immediately and asked for my help to get them into one of the  best hospitals in the area  so I got up woke my brother who happens to be a budding politician and had many contacts and favours to call, so he did that and got them a bed. \nNext morning the calls came in again and I  picked them all feeling good about myself fueling my messiah complex. I still remember it was around afternoon that I got a call from K again saying that he got thier reports back and that they are all positive with the virus his father, mother and him and both the hospitalized grandparents, the whole family all of them had the virus, I told him to lay low and isolate and let me know if he needs anything. Then within a few hours i got a call from him again saying that his grandfather has just died an hour ago and his grandmother died shortly after, he sounded like a broken man and asked me to help him with thier last rites, I took my bike out made a few calls at the cemetery and got there within an hour. What I saw there still shakes me to my core when I look back, when I got there I saw atleast 6 hospital and hearse vans with atleast 3 or 4 bodies each in them covered in plastic body bag with only 1 allowed family member accompanying the dead body, I turned my head and saw K standing there looking completely broken by then. I looked at him and just nooded resisting the urge to hug him and went and spoke to the guy in charge and got the arrangements ready,and within a couple of minutes picked up his grandparents and placed them on the funeral pyre and saw my dear friend giving fire to both his grandparents in a single night. After couple of hours we stood there just staring at the flames collected thier Ash and went on our way, on our way I asked him about his parents and he told me they weren\'t doing good and are currently on medication and would probably have to be hospitalized early morning arrangements for which have already been made. \nThe next morning I was again strafed with calls, but something had changed in me I wasn\'t picking up every call, only the people that I knew well and even then I didn\'t feel good about myself even when I did help them. The naivity and narcism went out of the window and was soon replaced with gloom and pesismism. Couple of days passed and just when it seemed that the gloom may pass I got a call from K again around 1 in the afternoon I picked it up with a heavy heart knowing that it couldn\'t be good and for once hated myself for being right because as soon I picked it up I heard a shrill in K\'s voice and all he said was that he is gone, he died my father just died and he took my mother with him, I was speechless for a whole minute before I asked him how is mother was all he said was that he wasn\'t doing well and the doctors have given up. I told him I am on my way and we will make the funeral arrangements once I get to the hospital, in about an hour I was there not knowing where my friend was cause all I could see was shell of guy that I once knew siting on the curb, but when I got near to him I could see that he wasn\'t just siting he is was shivering, my friend was crying his eyes out I ran upto to him called his name couple of times he didn\'t answer than I looked at his uncle standing besides him and asked him what happened he just put a hand on K\'s head and said that his mother died about 10 min ago. At that point I remember not crying in years, and was actually quite proud about it, but as soon his uncle said those words I could feel a tear rolling down my eyes and my heart just dropping into a large crater, it was a lady that I had known for years, she has always been nice to me, fed me looked after me at times and she was no more. But more than that I could see my friend disjointed, disheartened and completely broken down I looked at him and I couldn\'t find the courage to let out even single word out of my mouth only tears came out.\nI picked him up forgoing the obvious threat of contraction and hugged him and cried with him for a good 5 minutes and quite frankly don\'t remember the next hour. The last thing I remember was again being in a familiar place two funeral pyres burning in front of me and atleast 20 others burning all around me. I just remember getting a few calls while I was standing there and I ignored all of them, I switched off my phone and  stood there looked at my friend who has just lost all of his family in a matter of 4 days who just stood there with nothing but desolation and despair in his eyes and i know it for fact that a large part of him and a little part of me burned in those flames with his parents.'<br />Author: 'candidlyintrovert'  id: 'u0aqbc'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/u0aqbc/cant_believe_that_it_has_been_an_year/</li>

But that's merely a historical blabbering.\n\nGT Road existed long before shershah. Read on.\n\nUttarpath\n\nBuilt around: \n\nFirst mention of Uttarpath is in Panini's Ashtadhyayi written around 2400BC. We can only imagine Uttarpath being built around 2600BC then.\n\nHistorical mention:\n\nThe term is derived from the word Paniha, which in Atharva Veda's Prithvi Sukta mentions it as the arteries of the Indian subcontinent. The Uttarapatha has also been mentioned by Acharya Panini and in Ashtadhyayi. Many Jataka stories of the Buddhists also mention this route. \n\nPatrons:\n\nChandragupta Maurya had recreated and renovated the road and Ashoka put a lot of effort into the maintenance of this route. He established many guest houses and water bodies for the travellers. Samudragupta also made efforts for this route as mentioned in the rock edicts of the Ahokan age. \n\nRoute:\n\nThis route started from Kabul in Afghanistan to Chittagong in Bangladesh. It covered Khyber Bypass and connected cities like Rawalpindi, Amritsar, Attari, Delhi, Mathura, Varanasi, Patna, Kolkata, Dhaka and Chittagong. It used to meet with Bay of Bengal via Tamralipta or modern day Tamluk.\n\nLater Sher Shah rebuilt it in 1700s.\n\nUttarpath has a equivalent for the southern India, Dakshinpath. They used to meet near Sarnath.

      <li>Title::: '[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] New Chinese base in the South Pacific, Shanghai under lockdown, and the creation of Saudi Arabia'<br />Body: '***For all my previous posts in the Geopolitics Thread, see*** [***ididacannonball\'s Corner***](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/wiki/ididacannonballcorner)\n\nWelcome to this week\'s edition of the Geopolitics Thread, the place where we discuss all the latest events from around the world. In this thread, I am happy to to share the fourth in a series on the history of the Arabian Peninsula. Please share your thoughts and interesting news articles in the comments. Here are a few to get the conversation started:\n\n# Top Stories\n\n1. [Panic in South Pacific over potential new Chinese base](https://apnews.com/article/business-solomon-islands-africa-guam-new-zealand-c7071aaac9c61b98b0783f663e9b921d)\n\nIsland states in the South Pacific, as well as New Zealand and Australia, have expressed outrage at the signing of a new security pact between China and the Solomon Islands. The pact was sealed after the Islands switched its recognition to the PRC from Taiwan in 2019. That move set off a series of protests from people who feared that the country was going to enter a Chinese debt trap. The protests turned violent. The new pact envisages Chinese naval ships having rights to use the island, as well as Chinese "peacekeepers" being available to be called on to maintain order in case of any future riots. The Islands and China have refused to call it a military base, but it fits a growing trend of the PLA obtaining rights over foreign ports such as those in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Cambodia. A base in the Solomon Islands would put the PLA within striking distance of the US territory of Guam as well as Australia and New Zealand.\n\n2. [French Presidential race tightens](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/french-presidential-race-tightens-far-right-challenger-nipping-macrons-rcna23004)\n\nFrance is all set to go to polls this month, as a constellation of 16 candidates faces off in the first round of presidential elections. The two candidates with the highest vote will face off in a second round vote on April 24. So far, incumbent Macron leads the pack with about 26% support in opinion polls, but his right wing challenger Marine Le Pen is gaining with 23% support. In the last election, Macron and Le Pen went to the second round, when there was a surge of left wing support for Macron to keep Le Pen out. This time however, Macron in extremely unpopular among left wing supporters due to his economic policies and a low turnout could doom his chances.\n\n3. [Terrorist attack in Israel receives unusual condemnation](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-703668)\n\nA Palestinian man opened fire and killed three Israelis in the internationally-recognized capital city of Tel Aviv, a rare terrorist attack in the country\'s largest city. In retaliation, the Israeli Defense Force said that it tracked down and killed the attacker. Unusually however, Turkey, Bahrain, and the UAE all joined to not only condemn the attack, but also to explicitly call it a terrorist attack, instead of the usual rhetoric of Palestinian freedom. Hamas, the main terrorist group in Palestine, hit back at those countries and claimed that the terrorist attack was a right as a matter of self-defense. The unusual condemnation shows the extent to which force in the Middle East are realigning since the signing of the Abraham Accords that were brokered by the Trump administration.\n\n4. [World\'s largest lockdown drawing residents\' ire in Shanghai](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/this-is-inhumane-the-cost-of-zero-covid-in-shanghai)\n\nWhile most of the world has largely moved on from the COVID-19 pandemic after suffering terrible tragedies, China continues to pursue its zero COVID policy of strict lockdowns and mass testing in response to even a single new case. Now however, the country is dealing with a huge outbreak in its largest city, Shanghai, home to 26 million people. Local communist authorities have put the city under lockdown since March 28, ordering all residents to submit to regular testing. Reports of food shortages and patients dying from other diseases have surfaced through China\'s strict censorship. Industries are also facing closures due to supply shortages, as the world\'s busiest Port of Shanghai also faces labour shortages. Although a vast majority of the cases are asymptomatic, local authorities are under tremendous pressure from the government of Xi Jinping to bring case counts to zero and often react with disproportionately harsh measures. \n\n5. [UK Finance Minister faces new scandal](https://www.businessinsider.com/rishi-sunak-political-future-us-green-card-minister-admission-2022-4)\n\nThe British Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister) Rishi Sunak, once seen as possible successor to PM Boris Johnson, now faces an existential threat to his political career. Last week, it was revealed that he and his wife, Akshata Murthy, both held US green cards and own a multi-million dollar vacation home in California. Murthy is the daughter of Indian businessman Narayan Murthy. That by itself is OK, except for the revelation that Murthy claimed non-resident tax status in the UK, effectively shielding herself from her husband\'s unpopular tax decisions. As the cost of living in the UK rises due to inflation, this revelation set off a storm. Sunak now faces calls to resign, even though Johnson continues to support him. There is speculation that he may swap portfolios with Foreign Minister Liz Truss, who herself was recently in New Delhi.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The Children of Sykes-Picot Part 4: The creation of Saudi Arabia\n\n*This is the fourth part of a series discussing the history of the countries in the Middle East that were born of the Sykes-Picot pact.*\n\n[Part 1: Background](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sg001q/rindiaspeaks_biweekly_geopolitics_thread_nato/)\n\n[Part 2: The Arab Revolt](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/srsrha/rindiaspeaks_biweekly_geopolitics_thread_canada/)\n\n[Part 3: The Partition](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tpn239/rindiaspeaks_biweekly_geopolitics_thread_sri/)\n\nIn the last part of this series, we saw that after WW1, the French and the British tore up their agreement with the Sharif of Mecca to create a unified Arab state from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire. Instead, the French created new territories to the northwest, and the British established new puppet kingdoms in the southeast. The House of Hashem was established with British support in the newly-created countries of Transjordan and Iraq, while the British established direct rule over Palestine (cis-Jordan) with the ultimate goal of establishing a Jewish homeland there. \n\nOf course, all this intrigue was taking place to the north of the actual Arabian peninsula. On the peninsula itself, a myriad of small tribal chiefs ruled over a sparsely-populated desert. The richest part of the peninsula was the Hejaz on the Red Sea, which included Mecca and Medina, and which was the main front of the Arab Revolt. But the interior of the peninsula (the Najd), as well as the eastern (Al-Ahsa) and southern (Asir) parts coveted control of the Hejaz. One of these tribal chiefs however, found a winning formula to unite the tribes. In 1744, Muhabban Ibn Saud, the ruler of a few villages around modern Riyadh, formed an alliance with the radical Islamic preacher Muhammad Ibn Abd-al-Wahhab. They created a new, ultra-conservative Islamic movement called Wahhabism, and managed to gain significant territory until the Ottomans invaded and took control of the Hejaz. Ibn Saud was pushed back to the desert in the Najd, and the Ottomans handed nominal control of the area to the Hussein bin Ali.\n\nIn WW1, even as bin Ali led the Arab Revolt and defeated the Ottomans, Ibn Saud\'s successor Abdulaziz Al Saud in the Najd refused to cooperate with them, rightly seeing a threat to his rule in the Najd. Already, in 1913, Al Saud had won Ottoman territory along the Persian Gulf, the site of most of the oil reserves of modern Saudi Arabia. However, Al Saud did not directly attack bin Ali in the Hejaz, fearing that he had British support in the form of troops from Egypt and India. That changed in 1924 however - cheated out of the promise of a unified Arab homeland, bin Ali because a sworn enemy of the British. Al Saud saw a golden opportunity: he sent his Arab army, the Ikhwan, to attack the Hejaz and received covert British backing to do so. Within a year, in 1925, the Hashemites had been driven out. The Ikhwan established a new Wahhabi order in the Hejaz, uprooting the cosmopolitan society that had been established by the Ottomans. \n\nAl Saud declared himself the king of the Hejaz and Najd. In 1927, the British signed the Treaty of Jeddah to recognize the new kingdom with the agreement that the Ikhwan would not go further north into the British areas of Transjordan and Iraq. This led to a brief revolt in the Ikhwan against Al Saud, but it was eventually put down. In 1932, Al Saud renamed his kingdom to Saudi Arabia after his dynasty. It remained a poor, puritanical society whose existence was mainly to act as a buffer state between the British and Persia. That changed in 1938, when crude oil was discovered, and by 1945, Saudi Arabia became the world\'s largest producer of oil, overthrowing the United States on that list. All of a sudden, the impoverished desert kingdom became an economic miracle. A handshake between US President Roosevelt and Al Saud aboard the USS *Quincy* in the Suez Canal cemented the relationship between the two - oil for military protection, and arrangement that lasts to this day.\n\nOil however, has not entirely been the boon the Saudi dynasty has hoped for. Al Saud died in 1953, and a power struggle broke out between his sons Saud and Faisal. Faisal ultimately won that, but his reign was rocked by several crises: the civil war in Yemen, the Arab-Israel War, the Arab oil boycott. Not to mention, internal divisions in the dynasty continued. Faisal was assassinated by his nephew a few years into his reign, and was succeeded by his half-brother Khalid. Under King Khalid, the kingdom achieved rapid development and modernization of infrastructure, but faced two new crises. In 1979, the Shah of Iran was overthrown by Ayatollah Khomeini, creating huge anti-regime protests in Saudi Arabia as well. Islamic fundamentalists occupied and took control of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, and in response, Khalid imposed a new, even-stricter version of Islam in order to win back orthodox backing. In 1982, his brother Fahd succeeded him and continued the new conservative tilt, exporting it to other countries. He also oversaw Saudi Arabia\'s response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the First Gulf War, cementing the kingdom as a US ally. \n\nThe final chapter of Saudi Arabia\'s modern history started in 2005, when King Fahd was succeeded by King Abdullah. He started a new policy of moderating the strict interpretation of Islam and taking a new line against terrorism, while also keeping the Arab Spring at bay. His polices proved to work, as the dynasty survived the upheaval. In 2015, Abdullah was succeeded by his half-brother Salman, whose son Muhammad bin Salman (MbS) became the de facto head of the government as the crown prince. MbS has tried to move the country away from its century-long dependence on oil and diversifying its economy on the lines of neighbouring Dubai. \n\nWait, Dubai? Emirates? Arab Emirates? The *United* Arab Emirates? How did that survive the Saudi conquest of Arabia? We\'ll find out in Part 5.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Have any interesting stories from around the world?

      <li>Title::: 'Analysing different political parties'<br />Body: "I am a what you will call a centrist. I dont like the right and the left. I think they both are hugely problematic. I think bjp is bad for india ,but so is congress and aap. They all are bad for india in the long run. Here i am trying to analyse the top political parties in india,tell me what you think:\n1. Bjp:\n Strength:the only openly pro hindu party. Being the only pro hindu party and non left party, becomes a default option for anybody from centre right to far right and for people who dont like left. Unlike what most people think,has a very diverse vote base. Lack of competition in the right space is its biggest strength.\nWeakness: doesnt really cares about hindus. They are only used for votes(case in point not freeing the temples). Too dependent on modi's image to win election. Lack good local leaders in many states. Most leader relies on modi's image and religious sentiments to win election rather than talking about development. Being a very pro hindu party, alienate other groups like sikhs n muslim to vote for them.\nThreats: again unlike what is general perception,most of bjp vote bank are not like people from bajrang dal. Bjp runs the risk of trying to carter to the vocal far right minorities which will result in alienation of its major vote banks. Modi  no longer has that image he used to have. Gujarat model has been busted. Amit shah is really more interested in winning the next state election than looking after development of india.  Too much centralisation of power in modi shah hands,run the risk of doing same mistakes congress did. Not doing any development but only talking about religion can be downfall of bjp. \nOpportunity: being the only pro hindu party ,bjp will always remain relevant untill another pro hindu party give it a competition in this space. If it doesnt fall into the trap of far right hindus ,it will do good. Bjp as a pro hindu development centric party has a very bright future, bjp as a far right party only talking about religion will be doomed.\n2) AAP:\nStrength: Doesnt have any ideology,which works in its favour. Try to appease everybody,whether you are a hindu,muslim,sikh,doesnt matter. Arvind kejriwal has a good image. Trying to be a centrist party, away from right or left. Aap is opportunistic enough to realise where the wind is flowing and go with the wind. This kind of flexibility is great in politics. Follow the welfare state model, which is attractive to alot of poor peoples. Has done some good work in field of schools and hospitals. Has a non corrupt party image.\nWeakness: the biggest weakness is the economic model they follow ,which is based in giving alot of freebies. Have not proven themselves yet that they can attract investment and industrialise a state. Delhi is a rich state,what can work in delhi will not work in most states. Welfare state model is like playing a russian roulette,it works sometimes( especially when are already industrialised) but most of the times it fails in long run. Aap just need to mess up one state n that will a death blow for them. Not having any ideology can also seems problematic to your vote bank. Because they dont know what you really stand for. \nThreat:Too dependent on arvind kejriwal's image. Its arvind kejriwal show from start to end,he is the star. If he fails ,aap fails. Need other leader who can shoulder the responsibility. Congress reviving itself is the biggest threat to aap. Their economic model failing in just one state will be enough to curb their growth.\n\nOpportunity:  As long as aap remains a centrist party away from right and left,it has a very bright future. It will most likely become the main opposition to bjp replacing congress. Aap as a no nonsense, centrist, development centric party has a great future.\n3) Congress:\nStrength: it is the grand old party of india. Many people still associate it with the past glories. At state level has strong vote base in many states. Many of the achievement and development of india can be attributed to them.\nWeakness: the gandhi had failed to provide a proper leadership to the party. Not being able to become a centrist party which it alway used to be, has led to its downfall. App is quickly filling this space. Still struck in the past and only talk about past glories. Have no real plan for india, only plan is to win election anyhow. Have no real ideology ,only ideology is to defeat bjp at any cost. Party is in desperate need for a proper plan and reconnect with the masses.\nThreat: Aap is the biggest threat that congress is facing. It can replace it in national as well as state level. Gandhi family is no longer an asset they have become a liability. Congress lack of party democracy can led to its downfall. Need to promote better leaders from the party n talk about development. Flirting with far left and communist elements has only put a dent in congress's centrist image. Reluctancy to remove gandhis from leadership position\nOpportunity: not much, it is a fight for relevance for congress party. Need to get rid of far left and communist elements ,focus on being a centre left party as they use to be. Desperately need a leader who can connect with the masses. Focus on states where you still have good vote base and not lose those states."<br />Author: 'ralni7391'  id: 'u00wh0'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/u00wh0/analysing_different_political_parties/</li>

The justice for scheming of killing 163 people is Jailing? He must be hanged to death, multiple times. Jailing is, just a smoke screen so that they can get around FATF gray list. It means shit. And as most of you said, Jail is probably full with 5 star amenities or a safe house to keep him away from our RAW boys. \n\nBut TBH, I don\'t really think RAW really wants to take him out. He is valuable alive than dead. He is the big bounder sitting on an entire country draining them economically. There is no bigger punishment to Pakistan than having this piece of shit alive and well. He is just a case of an asset who turned to be a liability. Tough luck! Let them lick their wounds. Serves them good.\n\nIt would have been a different matter if they\'ve acted soon after 26/11 and convicted him. That would sound sincere. But now, with we forcing them on FATF list and engaging in an economic war, they were forced to act as we wish. There is no reason why we should credit them anything. ANY fucking thing. This is just another case of licking your own spit or "thook ke chatna". Serves them good.\n\nAnd moving forward, I am not sure if we should trade with them at all. Especially because pakistan is in a millitary alliance with China because it is convenient to be friends with enemy of my enemy. However this argument doesn\'t work when it comes to trade. You trade with friendly countries as a group. India doesn\'t want to trade with china and actively pursuing policies that try to decouple itself economically from China. By association, given that China is investing in Pakistan, India wouldn\'t be too keen to pursuing trade relations with Pakistan. Also it should be noted that China is known to wage economic war. There is no telling that it wouldn\'t use Pakistan as a proxy to dump goods into India and hurting our local industries.\n\nAlso we should weigh which is profitable to us? $ that we make by exporting to Pakistan OR Pakistan hurting by not being able to import from India. And also it should be noted that in recent days (~ 7 days ago) I\'ve read a news that Pakistani traders have not paid their arrears for last 3 months to Indian traders. And a complaint has been lodged.\n\n\nAlso this people-to-people contact nonsense must be stopped. If people from Islamic Republic of Pakistan visit India either for say participating in IPL or in Film Industry, they would be living and working among Hindus. In that case what happens to their "Two Nation Theory"? The moot question is can a Pakistani Muslim live and work among Hindus shoulder to shoulder? Unless they are willing to let it go in order to make money in India. I find it troubling that on one hand they teach "Two Nation Theory" and tell their children that they cannot live with Hindus and OTOH they want to come and work among Hindus to make money.  Unless these questions are resolved there is no point in trying to enhance people to people contact. But more importantly, given that hatred among communities is so high that it is going to show up once this feel good honeymoon period dies down and ugly realities of pre partition shows its head up.\n\nBut if govt does, I promise that I am going to make ANY Pakistani visiting India miserable. I am going to harass him/her 24/7 until they leave the country. I am going to give money to MNS and drive any Pakistani that steps into our land.\n\nAnd TBH, I look at them as mischief makers.

      <li>Title::: 'I come from the Muslim Arab World and when I go to India, Indian Muslims frighten me. (throw-away account)'<br />Body: 'I\'m an ex-muslim now atheist and this is obviously a throwaway account.\n\nOkay so that makes me angry and I wanna rant.\n\nI frequent India because I have ties here. I come from a country in the Middle East where Islam is the main religion in the damn constitution, been there for over a thousand years. It\'s even mentioned in the Quran lol. I traveled in the Middle East, I\'ve talked with all kind of other Muslims in my life, Arabic speaking and non Arabic speaking. \n\nWE HAVE NEVER SEEN THE KIND OF EXTREME ISLAM THAT EXISTS IN INDIA. Period.\n\nThe ATTIRE! Damn the ATTIRE! They dress like people who are seen as extremists and dangerous in most Arab states. The amount of beards, white garments (Jelbab) is higher than Saudi Arabia, literally.\n\nThe small cap (taqiyah) you rarely see them outside of specific occasions, they wear it as if it defines them!\n\nThe women are willingly, mind-blowingly, alarmingly and unusually adhering to very oppressive traditions that aren\'t even required!! Other than Saudi and Iran, all you need is Hijab if you wanna adhere to the Muslim attire and the rest is up to you. Not wearing revealing clothes is a given (even though in so many Arab states you\'d see hijab on jeans and tight skirts normally), but that amount of craziness I\'ve never seen.\n\nIn India, I\'ve seen women covering their eyes and I\'ll never understand how they can see. \n\nThey call marriage Nikah, which is a loan-word from Arabic literally means fucking. Literally. I saw a Tiktok with an expat Indian woman saying "when you\'re getting ready for your Nikah....." and it got recommended to the Arab speaking world. You can imagine what people thought the video is, they thought she was a pornstar at first and comments in Arabic was asking what the fuck do you mean? lol.\n\nShe ended up calling people "sick" because nikah is the islamic name for marrriage WHICH IS NOT. Nikah is the islamic term for FUCKING. They refuse to learn the truth from the ORIGIN OF THE DAMN RELIGION. Nikah has to be put in a lot of context for it to refer to marriage. Use it on its own it\'s just fucking.\n\nThe dowry system they have is in reverse in Islam, Muslims give dowry to the women not the other way round and it\'s called Mahr. Giving men dowry is an enormous no-no haram haram lol.\n\nThey have a caste system, in Islam! Argue about Islam all you want, Islam does not have a caste system, they invented one and they take it very seriously. It\'s laughable and when I say to folks here Indian Muslims have a caste system they go like "what does a caste system even mean?" and when I elaborate, they feel like I\'m making this shit up. \n\nIt\'s insane. The amount of beards there is unprecedented compared to the Arab world, I need to remind you that this is the birthplace of Islam. It\'s mainly designated for sheikhs and when an ordinary person grows it that way and wear the "full gear". It stands out, not usually bad but it stands out. But in India I thought I was in a big ISIS camp. They scared me. AGAIN, Islam is the official religion in the constitution and we are pretty much obsessed with Islam as a society it\'s a major problem and  yet I felt scared around them.\n\nMost of them don\'t understand The Quran, because it\'s a very very untranslatable book. Literally untranslatable. A lot of words don\'t have a specific meaning and there are books that are dedicated to explain what WORDS mean, so you can\'t actually translate the Quran like you can translate the bible. That\'s a global thing not an Indian thing, but given the amount of extremism I\'ve seen, it\'s worth mentioning. Consider it a cherry on top.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah and they have TERRIBLE unsafe neighborhoods, I was with a female friend, we roamed India safely in broad-daylight. We keep common sense and we stay safe for the most part. She was never harassed, or touched once except in their maulas den around Jama Masjid. I guess I\'ve never felt that unsafe anywhere in India more than Chandni Chowk in 2 pm and we didn\'t stay more than 5 minutes. She was groped 3 times.\n\nThis is worth mentioning because in the Arab World, when you grow your beard, wear a jilbab, wear a taqiyah, and go full gear, the last thing you expect from that person is to grope women and look them in the eye in broad-day light. I\'m not saying that these kind of people don\'t harass in the Arab world, I\'m just saying that TYPICALLY this stereotype is expected not to grope you. \n\nWomen were giving my friend WHO WAS DRESSING REALLY CONSERVATIVELY but was Hindu, very dirty looks I felt sickened. \n\nI\'m really sorry if it\'s inappropriate to say that. BUT WHAT\'S WITH THE FUCKIN\' HYEGINE? Every uber/cab/auto I take and the driver happens to be a muslim, the car is absolutely filthy. Their shops are usually shit too. Muslims are obsessed with hyegine usually (except the women who don\'t put perfumes cause haram to smell good you have to be as repulsive as you can for god not to torture you). But in India?? Muslims are doing things that are absolutely unheard of from people who are that obsessed with religion, attire and protesting in the streets for more religion and attire.\n\nIndian Muslims have things that are so extreme, in a religion that\'s by nature and on itself is so extreme. I want you to imagine the disaster. \n\nMay India come out safe of this terrible time-ticking bomb (no pun intended)\n\nJai Hind.'<br />Author: 'Unlucky_Sentence6902'  id: 'tzm8vi'<br />Score:665<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tzm8vi/i_come_from_the_muslim_arab_world_and_when_i_go/</li>

As an adult, I am only able to get deeper into spirituality/sadhana because of the foundation these bedtime stories built in my mind. Unfortunately, today's parents are not themselves well versed with our scriptures, hence the vacuum. \n\nThe usual size of stories would be 15-20 mins in a calming voice and soothing background music, helping kids fall asleep. It goes without saying, unlike '**Chota bheem',** our stories will be well researched and will be picked from the plethora of Indian literature and personas such as Thiruvalluvar, Guru Nanak, Krishna, Gautama Budhha, Mahaveera, and other Jain teerthanker. \n\nIn addition to stories, we will also have meditation picked from Hatha yoga and Raja yoga literature, suited for kids. \n\nApart from sensitizing our future generations about dharmic culture - we will be helping parents get some sleep because if kids aren’t sleeping, parents aren’t sleeping too :/ \n\nIf this works, we can build a full **spiritual OTT platform for kids** \\- rooting them into Indian tradition from childhood.\n\nI need people who can contribute in : \n\n1. Story writing (converting scriptural stories into child-friendly stories) \n2. Audio artists who can narrate such stories and meditations \n3. Digital marketers/growth hackers \n\nIf you fall into any of these categories, please DM me\n\nFor techies, we would be requiring techies soon, for now, I will code it myself :) \n\nPS. I am trying to build a proper profitable and investable startup, as I believe profit enables us to experiment and grow in different directions, ultimately will help us with goal of the Hindu renaissance"<br />Author: 'rajajanmejay'  id: 'tz1wa2'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tz1wa2/dhyāna_and_bedtime_stories_app_for_children/</li>
