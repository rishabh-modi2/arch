      <li>Title::: '"Acharsahinta and Haryana recruitment" - An anecdotal discussion'<br />Body: 'In this short write-up, I\'ll compare briefly what used to happen before the current government (Bjp@Centre, BJP@State) and what happened now. \n\n**This anecdote is limited to the state of Haryana**\n\n#Preliminary explanation:\n\n*Acharsahinta* is also dubbed as "Governor\'s rule". About 1 month or so before the state or central elections the state goes into Governor\'s rule. During this time, all unfinished recruitment, policy implementation, changes are halted (or even cancelled) as it becomes the prerogative of the new govt. to decide if they want to go ahead with what\'s been decided or not. The governor does not take any such decisions.\n\nHe/She only manages general continuing functioning the government bodies.\n\n\n\n-----------------\n\n##**Before**:\n\nIt was a usual trend to ramp up recruitment positions, collect money from the recruitment drive (forms, etc) a short while before the implementation of the governor\'s rule. \n\nAt times, the government would prefer \'approach\' or corruption in these selections (even low level ones) like Clerk or Peon C or D. \n\nThere used to be interviews which used to be more or less a sham, as those who have had paid up. The running cost of a Police position was about Rs 7 Lakhs, Forest guard C was about 4-6 Lakhs. If you\'ve paid the amount, you only go there and show your face in the interview, or else...\n\nOnce the interviews are over, the government used to not release the list of successful candidates in time.\n\nGovernor\'s rule would then make the selection process void - until the new government decide on it. (Once the rule is in place, neither the government nor the governor has the power to implement the recruitment list)\n\nThe existing government would then say, "Vote for us back into power and we\'ll establish the list".\n\n1999 to 2004 - [INLD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Lok_Dal) (indian national Lok dal) - Jat favoring party was corrupt at the community level. The vice president of the party, due to corruption is now in Jail (Read: Om Prakash Chautala)\n\n--------\n\n#What happened this time?\n\nWhile the current BJP government started recruitment a little late (not as soon as they came into power), they started almost a year ago. \n\nSecondly, for positions such as C and D, they removed **Interviews**, so the people were selected based on written test merit (and quota). \n\nThird, they have already released the list of selected positions and now these people have government jobs - before the implementation of government\'s rule.\n\nHow this translates on the ground, villages in and around Kurukshetra, Ambala, Yamunanagar, Pewa, Kathal, Karnal, Jind, Rothak, Jahjhar, Nu according to the requirement in various districts - all those who passed the cutoff were given positions. If there were excess candidates in one location but positions in other locations they were sent to those locations. \n\nIn smaller villages, people have visibly noticed that every 3rd or 4th house has got a person who has got these jobs and this has improved the goodwill for BJP. \n\nThe second notable observation was that, there is no observable corruption - one of the main sources of petty and recruitment level corruption was the interview stage - which was done away with.\n\nWhat will happen when governor\'s rule comes into effect? Nothing - they area already officially recruited with the offer letter (or equivalent) \n\nThis has caused a strange level of goodwill in the village level and BJP has created a favorable atmosphere for itself without the carrot and stick approach. \n\nWhy was this done so late? I guess politics? as this would remain fresh in the people\'s memory in the run up to the general elections.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nIn other news, those farmers who\'ve had bank accounts have received Rs. 2000 from the central government - as per the bill passed (By Piyush Goyal?) for the farmers. Haryana government paid Rs. 2000 more from its side as goodwill for the farmers.\n\n-----------------\n\nSources: \n* Ground level reports from villagers and farmers around Kurukshetra\n* [Haryana Staff Selection Commission](http://hssc.gov.in/)\n\n--------\n\n#Points to discuss:\n\n1.

My village is famous for its watermelons. When I was a child, the farmers would organise a watermelon-eating contest at the end of the harvest season in May.\nAll the kids would be invited to eat as many watermelons as they wanted. Years later, I went to IIT Mumbai to study engineering. I went back to my village after 6.5 years. I went to the market looking for watermelons. They were all gone. The ones that were there were so small.\nI went to see the farmer who hosted the watermelon-eating contest. His son had taken over. He would host the contest but there was a difference. When the older farmer gave us watermelons to eat he would ask us to spit out the seeds into a bowl.\nWe were told not to bite into the seeds. He was collecting the seeds for his next crop. We were unpaid child laborers, actually. He kept his best watermelons for the contest and he got the best seeds which would yield even bigger watermelons the next year.\nHis son, when he took over, realized that the larger watermelons would fetch more money in the market so he sold the larger ones and kept the smaller ones for the contest. The next year, the watermelons were smaller, the year later even smaller\nIn watermelons the generation is one year. \n\nIn 7 years, Parra’s best watermelons were finished. In humans, generations change after 25 years. It will take us 200 years to figure what we were doing wrong while educating our children.\nUnless we employ our best to train the next generation, this is what can happen to us. We must attract the best into teaching profession."\n\n#RIPManoharParikar 🙏🏽🇮🇳🙏🏽\nThis is such tremendous insight and wisdom from his simple personal observations.\n\nWhen people pass away, everyone says wonderful things about the deceased.\nWhile he was amidst us, It’s safe to say that I’d heard only respectful words spoken about #ManoharParrikar\n\nhttps://twitter.com/atulkasbekar/status/1107498848136687616'<br />Author: '10dozenpegdown'  id: 'b2gjxz'<br />Score:84<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b2gjxz/swa_manohar_parrikar_dropping_some_goan_wisdom/</li>

I remember it was the first telecom company that came into our small town, it provided very good service for that time, it was relatively cheap and reliable. It was also the first 3g provider in our area. \n* But somehow, quality of its services went downhill over the years,nowadays the network goes down in my area very frequently due to some fiber optic cut, or sometimes something gets stolen from the tower premises and nobody seems to care. \n* Everybody in my town had at least one BSNL sim which they used, but after the disruptions everyone got frustrated and switched to other providers. \n*  At the time of 3g allotment, BSNL was forced to take the spectrum in all circles by matching highest bid price in that circle. I don't understand why couldn't the govt give the spectrum for free in the first place. After all it's a govt entity, and everybody must have known it would kill BSNL.\n* The government didn't even allocate 4g spectrum to BSNL, it was like the final nail in the coffin. \n* Also, It's not just about ambani and modi or bjp and congress, both the govt were part of it."<br />Author: 'antarikhsha'  id: 'b2fn1a'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b2fn1a/what_happened_to_bsnl/</li>

The "Tarikh-i-Firuz Shah" is a historical record written during his reign that attests to the systematic persecution of Hindus under his rule.Capture and enslavement was widespread; when Sultan Firuz Shah died, slaves in his service were killed en masse and piled up in a heap.Victims of religious violence included Hindu Brahmin priests who refused to convert to Islam:\n\nAn order was accordingly given to the Brahman and was brought before Sultan. The true faith was declared to the Brahman and the right course pointed out. but he refused to accept it. A pile was risen on which the Kaffir with his hands and legs tied was thrown into and the wooden tablet on the top. The pile was lit at two places his head and his feet.

These people were seized and brought before me. I ordered that the perverse conduct of this wickedness be publicly proclaimed and they should be put to death before the gate of the palace. I also ordered that the infidel books, the idols, and the vessels used in their worship should all be publicly burnt.

It\'s easy to criticize his decisions in hindsight but if you think from his point of view, as things were back then, he was completely rational: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. India was destroyed by the western world, and was about 10 years removed from it\'s independence struggle. \n2. Independent India had no true allies in the West, and they \\[rightly\\] had no desire to trust a western country in a multipolar cold war world. \n3. Why on earth would an independent India give up even a little bit of its newly acquired political sovereignty?\n4. Taking a UNSC seat would have compromised the non-alignment policy\'s objective of challenging the existing world order. \n5. Nehru viewed China as a potential ally and regional leader, and for very good reasons. The alternative of an eastern-led order was (and still is) a bit more worthy of support. \n6. Independent india needed good relations with its neighbors. This argument still holds true today, as many of the issues in the subcontinent could be solved through stronger relationships with neighboring countries. \n7. Communism was a perfectly good alternative. Remember, Indian princely states were subsidiaries of the East India Company, who raided India\'s resources for profit. Fair to assume that a politician of a brand new country emerging from the depths of capitalist hell, would have been a tiny bit opposed to yielding anything to nations built around corporate entities. \n8. For a country torn apart by religious riots for several decades, the more godless communist ideas were a perfectly reasonable alternative. Hence the strong presence of communists in educational spaces. Naturally, playing to the interests of like-minded Soviet Union and China made sense. \n9. Did it not make sense to tighten the state\'s control over land? Ultimately, this led to the creation of corrupt babus involved in shady land dealings (hello robert vadra) but Nehru couldn\'t have envisioned this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know India - and indian elites - are finally transitioning out of age old communist ideas. The communist party of india is practically dead in every state other except kerala. Everybody wants to start a business, a company, make money. and that\'s good. \n\nBut this doesn\'t mean Nehru\'s policies (and accompanying vision) were wrong, even if revisionist history would lead you to believe otherwise. \n\nThis is not to say that Nehru wasn\'t without flaws. He wasn\'t diplomatically savvy, like any "liberal" thinker of his time, and too closed to new ideas. He didn\'t really evolve, but then again, he was a British educated secularist elite completely disconnected from the masses. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas Nehru a good PM?

      <li>Title::: 'Whom should you vote ? A pragmatic guide to both the new and the old voter'<br />Body: "&gt; I am not hijacking the other thread, I felt that commenting there won't be enough. \n\nQ) Whom should you vote ? The candidate OR the party OR the ideology. \n\nA - It depends. It depends on the level of election. \n\n**Voting for candidate over party in general election is irresponsible**.\n\n**Voting for party over candidate in local election is irresponsible**.\n\nEvery complex system shows different properties at different scales of operation. \n\nAs far as ideology goes : One could be communist in hostels, socialist in families, democratic in municipality, conservative in district and libertarian at national level. And that is how nature operates. Head of the family may be autocrat at home, but is a proletariat at office. \n\nYour childhood teacher was an absolute overlord in the class, but is just another human being in the crowd. The world operates at different levels. It is not you got smarter/wiser as you grew up and realized the ordinary nature of your parents and teachers. You just changed the setting/level of operation.\n\nKeeping this knowledge in hindsight, you don't need to shove your national/global ideas in your locality and vice versa.  \n\nQ) Why voting for your candidate works at local level but doesn't at national level ?\n\nBecause, suppose I chose an independent candidate X to Lok Sabha. Neither would he have any clout to force any national policies that you deem worthy, nor would he get any specific administrative machinery to do very local tasks in your constituency. He can only get some big deals done, that too if he/she manages a good reputation with his colleagues.\n\nNational level elections are done precisely to get someone to represent your ideas at national level. Not to solve your immediate local problems, even district level problems. \n\n* So, do not fall for this booby trap of voting for candidate in general elections. BTW this is a really slick way of cutting votes for middle class votes in general elections. NDTV would play it again and again.    \n\nIt is ridiculously easy to go for the seemingly right candidate. What is tough is to put pressure on your party to get better candidates. And that one can do in 5 years. \n\n* Chanakya knew that to keep Greeks at bay he needed someone right in Magadha. He had to twist arms of every machinery within Magadha to throw Nandas out. He couldn't just afford to sit and manage border kingdoms Chandragupta had conquered.\n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ) What are the issues that I should vote for  ? Ram Temple OR economic policy \n\nTaking example of families. \n\nGestures like gifting your father a box of poster colors are symbolic.\n\nGestures like fixing your insurance policy are rational.  \n\nBoth are important, but sometimes we indulge in one or the other excessively. \n\nGestures like Sports day, Annual function keep a school alive.\n\nMeanwhile it is the scheduling of classes and exams and selection of courses and faculty that keeps the things running. \n\n&gt; Nation requires both - celebrations of culture and heritage, AND machinations of a well running economy and dependable security.  \n\nRest all, to me, is drama.

Transport infrastructure is one of the most important factors for a country's progress. With rapidIndustrialization, Urbanization, Globalization and concentration of large population in urban centers, the cities and towns of the country are growing at a faster pace. To keep this faster pace, for moving people, goods and services, metro rail projects are playing a crucial role not only as a transportation solution but as a means to transform cities.\n\n2. Today, 490 kms of metro lines are operational in 10 different cities in the country. More than 600 kms of metro rail projects are under construction in various cities. In the coming years there will be robust growth in metro rail sector. More than 350 kms of new construction will be started in the next few years as more and more cities are planning for expansion or new constructions of metro rail. In addition to metro rail network, Regional Rapid Transport System (RRTS) is also being introduced to decongest Delhi &amp; NCR. The first phase of RRTS consists of 3 corridors, covering a total length of about 380 kms. This transit system will connect Delhi with Sonepat, Alwar and Meerut.\n\n3. The Government of India is providing financial support in the implementation of metro rail projects by way of Equity and Subordinate Debt aswell as well as sovereign guarantee for multilateral and bilateral loans. The increasing trend of central government budget outlay provided for metro rail projects in last four years is evidence of the ever growing need for metro rail to decongest and enhance mobility in our cities.The average budget outlay of Govt. of India is likely to increase to about Rs 25,000 cr annually, apart from the investments envisaged by the state governments, private partners and ULBs.\n\n4. Various other steps have been taken for the systematic and sustainable growth of metro rail projects in the country. The standards for rolling stock and signaling systems or the metro rail in India have been notified in 2017 after concurrence from Railway Board. The standards for rolling stock also fixes the standards of civil structures. The standards for electrical systems have been concurred by the Railway Board recently and the same will be notified soon.Various new metro systems have already started procurement of the systems as per the notified standards.The detailed specifications for the Automatic Fare Collection System and the complete eco-system based on the Rupay standard has been prepared by NPCI and C-DAC in collaboration with DMRC through a research project sanctioned by MoHUA. BEL has been tasked to manufacture the prototype of the gate trough their ownfunds. Substantial expenditure has already been incurred and the first indigenous gate based on the National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) is likely to be launched in October 2018.The specifications of the most advanced signaling system in the world viz. Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) system, which was introduced by Kochi Metro Rail first in the country, is also being formulated jointly by BEL, C-DAC, DMRC, STQC through MoHUA.\n\n5. However, there are numerous other areas for which indigenous standards need to be formulated.These are layout of metro station,platforms, signage &amp; displays, size of tunnels, fire protection systems, disaster management systems, environment friendly and waste management systems, standards for solar panels at stations etc.\n\n6. These indigenous standards will ensure that metro rail sub systems for all new metro projects conform to the prescribed standards thus incentivizing manufacturers to plan for long term investments in the country and set up manufacturing units. This will also bring down the cost of the metro rail constructions and operation.\n\n7. For this purpose, a committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Sh. E. Sreedharan for Standardization and Indigenization in Metro Rail with the following members:\n\nChairman Dr. E. Sreedharan\n\nSh. H.S. Anand, (for Rolling Stock) Former Director, Rolling Stock, DMRC\n\nSh. Sameer Lohani, (for Rolling Stock) Executive Director (Carriage), RDSO, Indian Railways\n\nSh. D. K.

Mukund Kumar Sinha, (Member Secretary) OSD (UT) and Ex Officio Joint Secretary, MoHUA\n\n\nThe committee is expected to submit its report in 3 months. After 3 months, based on specific task of standardization, Dr. Sreedharan could co-opt the relevant expert members for the task for a specified period of time.\n\n\n&gt; Posting just for record"<br />Author: 'randibhasam'  id: 'b1fs15'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b1fs15/constitution_of_committee_for_standardization_and/</li>
      <li>Title::: '"Why did they give him back, I would have killed that pilot"'<br />Body: '#The following story is anecdotal, please take it with a lot of salt.\n\nIn this write-up, I will opine on how discussions and opinions are in the general public (here) about important events or countries. I will also throw light on how lies are the greatest beneficiaries of freedom of speech. I would conclude with what we must watch out for.  \n\nMost of you who are within India have not had the (mis)fortune of being in close proximity to a global crowd along with other Pakistanis. \n\nIt is quite surprising to me when people give political opinions (that are not socially appropriate) in places where the aren\'t warranted. I personally have "No Political opinions" as a general public-interaction policy, because it is just not worth it. Compromising social relations (which are more relevant) by stating political opinions, for which one has relatively no power to enforce or influence does not make sense to me.\n\nRecent events have highlighted that international Pakistanis continue to emote their political opinions in social forums or events (offline). I am sure there are Indians who\'d do that as well. Alternatively, I am also sure that there are both Indians and Pakistanis who hold their tongues.  \n\nThe international Indo-Pak citizens must adhere to respecting the laws of relative neutral territory they are in. Making such statements or follow up would go into an interpreted clause of "Not respecting people of other religions, communities or beliefs". \n\n**Observation 1:**\n\n&gt; When Abhinandan was captured, our work related discussions turned towards political taunts, and itch in people to carry the fight to such discussions. Most Pakistanis did echo in a similar fashion. On the other hand, some of the Indians went "I am not a nationalist...I am quite forward thinking" (a Pitiful argument, but alas, I wasn\'t going to take either baits).\n\n**Observation 2:**\n\n&gt;Most people of the world have no fucking clue about India. They\'ll absorb any information they\'ll get, so if you\'re a Pakistani saying, "India is dropping shit-bombs on our lunch plate", you\'d surely have someone come up and say, "Why don\'t Indians have toilets?"  That is the level of cluelessness. They know as much about India, as the average Indian knows about Peru or Cuba.\n\nSurely, being silent is the more prudent sensibility, \n\nBut from Observations 1 and 2 -  you\'d realize that Most of the world\'s population is a clean slate, and once the first person has filled it - it is harder to fill it up with a counter argument, lest it be muddied with conflicting propagandist information. \n\nOne would argue that, "If one is educated enough - they must have the basic sensibility to inform themselves correctly on a topic before they talk about it, rather than form opinion based on the first donkey\'s bray."\n\nBut that\'s just it,\n\n**Observation 3**\n\n&gt;No one, even experienced scholars, put the effort to go in-depth about the veracity of arguments and comments by parties in matters that does not concern them professionally, socially or personally. Even the best scholar (Say from Science), is likely to take a random opinion and hold it until they are somehow urged to get more informed. This is not due to capability or bias, but people just don\'t have the MindSpace for going into excruciating detail about things that don\'t matter to them. They\'ll just grab the first thing they see off the shelf. Better yet, if it is physically uttered by someone around them.\n\nWhile Observation 3 would be applicable globally, it also highlights a very grave consequence.\n\n**Observation 4**\n&gt;**Freedom of Speech is a power to turn lie into the a perceived truth**. All you have to do is, propagate it enough, regardless of counters and oppositions - and it needs to stick long enough.\n\nEven if proved wrong, it still sticks like a coffee stain on a shirt. \n\n**Counter-argument**\n\n&gt;But then, the government bodies who did the due diligence to investigate the matter, have sided with India on the matter. So what people think should not matter.\n\nTrue, but for how long does that last? Remember, the people in these bodies are elected by the people influenced by such shallow-opinion forming. Sooner or later, the tide of mis-information will take its toll and change the colours of the bodies as well. Oftentimes we have seen government bodies being influenced by the protests and voices of the people - an unwanted result of a democracy.\n\nWe see such lies being repeated even in our own political discussion - often like a broken record. The purpose is not propagating truth, but the inception of a lie. (Ask question like: Why is Rahul G continually talking about rafale? Why does Modi talk about something? Why do Media people talk about the same stuff?)\n\nIn fact, we have no way to legally gaging a lie.\n\nIn conclusion, when the Pakistani says "We released the Indian pilot" it is assumed that Pakistani benevolence was not reciprocated and they are the victims. While the informed ignore them, the oblivious pick up the information - the question remains, does taking the high road of any use at all? (Not getting involved in politics)\n\n\n\n\n'<br />Author: 'metaltemujin'  id: 'b1eq21'<br />Score:30<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b1eq21/why_did_they_give_him_back_i_would_have_killed/</li>

We were at 32% of world GDP at one point). The circumstances changed sometime before last millennium began, and while our diversity surplus ensured we survived, we lost our potency, and are losing our diversity as well.

Mention the Chinese oppression of Christians.\n\nIn the long run, it is ideas that win, not bullets. Never use made up facts, stay polite, convince your audience and plant ideas.

Once again Indian government has resorted to a self-serving, reckless and fictitious claim,” 1* 2*\n\n\n2. Pakistan foreign minister Qureshi said “multi-dimensional intrusion” had been attempted by the Indian fighter jets early on Tuesday. “But the intervention by Pakistani jets forced them to return back within minutes,” he said. The minister dismissed the notion that Pakistan Air Force jets were late in responding to the Indian attack, saying the planes were “ready” and “air-borne”. 2*\n\n\n3. Director-general of Pakistan’s Inter Services Public Relations, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, said India had “attempted” to send its combat air patrols (CAPs) “first from the Lahore-Sialkot sector” and they were “challenged” by Pakistani CAP. “They tried to enter from Bahawalpur-Okara and were forced to go back,” he said. According to Ghafoor, “the third (Indian) CAP which was bigger in number made it from Muzaffarabad and they were challenged and were forced to return”. 2*\nMaj Gen Asif Ghafoor\n✔\n@OfficialDGISPR\n Payload of hastily escaping Indian aircrafts fell in open.\n\n\n4. Pakistani Army confirmed attack on Twitter with pictures of craters outside the terrorist training facility. They claimed that bombs missed target and damaged only one civilian who suffered a gash on his forehead and a few trees.  “Payload of hastily escaping Indian aircrafts fell in open. pic.twitter.com/8drYtNGMsm”\n\n\n5. This video shows house of a local “civilian” close to the terrorist camp. It is a bit odd as it shows a small crater about 25-30 meters downhill and narrator claims that the whole house has been severely damaged.\nhttps://youtu.be/qVC6VxQepzU\n\n**Actual Proofs:**\nFollowing are some videos and pictures which tell a different story.\n\nThis video was uploaded on 8th March by a Pakistani media outlet. It shows a senior Pakistani army officer in a village meeting consoling family members of some (200) dead people. Some roughly translated lines below:\nhttps://youtu.be/0WJG5990ds0\n\n&gt;Whoever fights alongside rulers of land in name of jihad is fighting for jihad.\n\n&gt;Yesterday 200 people died. It was written in their fate, not ours.\n\n&gt;Your father is not dead, he is alive. We don’t call him dead,\n\nSo this Pakistani army man is definitely admitting that 200 or more “good jihadis” got killed in one go.\n\n2. Indian government and armed forces have release very little information till now. Maybe it’ll change later as it did with Uri strikes. But as of now, one major statement made is that Indian intelligence had detected around 300 mobile phone signals in the terrorist camp. 4*\n\n\n3. Following interview with some locals deflate official Pakistani claims\n\n\na. Access to whole area has been completely blocked off for outsiders as well as locals.\n\n\nb. Pakistani authorities are prohibiting any information leaks. For this, they’ve blocked internet, enforced no go zones and are actively warning people against talking to anyone.\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3xtXnS9Fw6g\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jAIWbb0XjjU\n\n**What Happened :**\n\n\nFollowing are my guesses based upon available information:\n\n1. IAF Mirage 2000s did attack atleast one target at Balakot. Other two possible targets were Chakoti and Muzaffarabad. Both are near to LoC in J&amp;K\n\n\n\n2. Earlier reports said that terrorist camp was hit using “1000 kg bombs”. Later it was revealed to be Spice, which is actually a guidance kit for 2000, 1000 and 500 pound bombs in Indian inventory. I believe that it was Spice 1000 used for 1000 lbs (450 kg) bombs which can have 200 kgs of high explosives. A single 1000 kg bomb will have around 450 kgs of explosives which will blow off most of hill top. Considering that avoiding collateral damage was one major mission objective, it’s unlikely that 1000 kg bombs were used.\n\n\n3. According to local witness accounts, 4-5 bombs were dropped. It should be pretty obvious that these smart bombs usually don’t miss. Even if we believe story of that single injured civilian whose house was damaged, there are still 3-4 other bombs which found their mark. Their impact points have not been made public by Pakistan and access blocked off.\n\n\n4. There have been atleast 200 causalities including some terrorists, their trainers as well as regular Pakistani army. Pakistan is doing everything in it’s power to hide it. We’ll have to wait for more information to be released by Indian government to have a reasonably accurate number and actual impact.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\n1. https://www.news18.com/news/world/pakistan-vows-to-respond-to-indian-air-strikes-at-time-and-place-of-its-choosing-2049355.html\n\n\n2. https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/damage-come-and-see-it-says-pakistan/cid/1685821\n\n\n3. https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/jaish-e-mohammed-camp-balakot-pakistan-blocks-media-1473243-2019-03-08\n\n\n4. http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/mar/04/ntro-surveillance-of-balakot-jem-camp-before-strikes-confirmed-300-active-targets-1946650.html'<br />Author: 'dark-ritual'  id: 'b0x80j'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b0x80j/what_happened_in_balakot_on_26th_feb_2019/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Medusa'<br />Body: 'Major Gaurav Arya (Veteran)\n\nOn 14 August 1947, a part of the British Indian Army separated from its mother organization and became the Pakistan Army. It retained the flavor of its British creator; the parties, the spit and polish, the gin in the afternoon and whiskey in the evening, the ‘hard as hobnailed leather’ ethos and the drill square. Its officers were Pakistani in skin-tone but British in thinking. “Brown Sahibs” would have been an apt description. \n\nWe were no different.\n\nThe Indian Army has seen a strong and consistent democratic dispensation since independence. Yes, our political leaders have made mistakes. But it is also true that the Indian Army is the better for never having tasted the fruits of unquestioned power. \n\nIndia ratified its Constitution on 26 November 1949 and gave itself a Constitution on 26 January 1950. \n\nThe Pakistan Army saw a political leadership vacuum from the very beginning, something they could take advantage of. While India’s socialist democracy moved towards economic justice, the power center in Pakistan remained the landowner, the redoubtable Wadera. In the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the relationship of the ruler and the ruled has always been that of the Chaudharys and Haaris, the landowner and the landless tiller. And the biggest Chaudhary of them all has always been the Pakistan Army.\n\nPakistan’s first Constitution was approved in 1956 but abrogated in 1958, after a military coup. The 1962 Constitution was suspended in 1969. It was abrogated in 1972. In 1973, Pakistan framed a new Constitution. It was again held in abeyance in 1977, after a coup. This Constitution was restored in 1985.\n\nEach time it was a Pakistan Army General who tore up the Constitution of Pakistan. When it wasn’t a General, it was a civilian who was all too willing to dance to the tune of whoever was the pied piper in Rawalpindi. Governor General Ghulam Mohammad, Major General Iskander Mirza, General Ayub Khan, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, General Zia ul-Haq, General Parvez Musharraf, Mian Mohammad Nawaz Sharif…not all Pakistani autocrats have worn the uniform.\n\nGen Ayub Khan midwifed the political career of the greatest of all Pakistani democrats, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. In 1983, another military dictator General Zia-ul Haq appointed a young industrialist to the very important position of Finance Minister of Punjab. That young industrialist was Nawaz Sharif. Before 2013, there was no one more liberal and secular than Imran Khan. He baited the Army and called out the fundamentalists. After losing every election and looking down the path of political oblivion, Imran Khan understood that without the three A’s of Pakistan, he was dust. Allah, Army and America have always been the pillars of Pakistan.\n\nImran saw that the national mood was against America. So, he embraced Islamic fundamentalism, and suddenly the Pakistan Army was Teflon coated. The elite soon renamed him “Taliban Khan”. In 2018, General Qamar Javed Bajwa manipulated the Pakistan General Elections and Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi became the twenty-second Prime Minister of Pakistan. Incidentally, Imran belongs to the same clan of Mianwali Niazis that gave Pakistan another historical gem, Lt Gen AAK Niazi.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nStrategic depth is the Holy Grail that the Pakistan Army has always sought. You need land to fight wars and Pakistan is not more than 400 kms wide, at an average. No nation wants to fight wars on its own land. It is avoidable. So, the Pakistan Army creates “zones of influence”. In Iran, it is the Sunni terror outfits perpetually at war with a Shia state. In Afghanistan, it is the Taliban and the Haqqani Network, amongst many others. In India, it is Kashmir. Earlier, it was Punjab. There are other geographies involved, within India. What I mention here is the tip of the iceberg. There are circles within circles. Pakistan’s attack on India is asymmetric. And it is mind-bogglingly sophisticated. \n\nNo one can accuse the Pakistan Army of not having a sense of humor. When the elected Prime Minister of Pakistan Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was overthrown by General Zia ul Haq, the coup was called Operation Fair Play. \n\nZia irreversibly changed both Pakistan and the Pakistan Army. It was under him that mainstreaming of radical Islamists started. When he appointed various ultra-conservative Ulema to the all-powerful Council of Islamic Ideology, an unknown Sargodha born cleric found a special place in Zia’s heart. General Zia-ul Haq created Hafiz Mohammad Saeed. \n\nThis was the time when the boundaries between the Pakistan Military and the self-styled Mujahideen who had fought in the Afghan Jihad, started blurring. Unity, Faith and Discipline, the motto given by Jinnah was dumped. Its place was taken by the freshly minted ‘Iman Taqwa Jihad fi-Sabilillah’. Jihad became the avowed aim of the Pakistan Army. Its soldiers were no longer simply professionals. They became Ghazis, devout Muslims who were at a state of perpetual war with non-Muslims. \n\nOfficers and men were graded by how ‘pious’ they were. Outward signs of this piety were namaz, the obligatory beard and frequent references to the Holy Quran. Liquor was banned. Music was declared ‘haram’. \n\nFrom the day it was born, Pakistan’s journey to being a security state started. This required money. So, agreements were signed with US and later with China. It was easier for US to deal with Pakistan, than with India, notwithstanding India’s socialist leaning towards the USSR. India was a messy democracy and work in progress. In Pakistan, US had always dealt with one man, the Army Chief. It was always about convenience. Nothing has changed. Pakistan Army has always had serious mercenary tendencies. That too has not changed.\n\nSoon, the ISI had its own political wing, used for keeping tabs on politicians. They blackmailed, harassed and pressurized. They created and destroyed governments. They were instrumental in assassinations and disappearances of political rivals. They say that the ISI has closed down its political wing. But then, they say a lot of things.\n\nThe Pakistan Army was the self-proclaimed savior of the nation. But to be the savior, an enemy was needed. So, the Pakistani population was told how India had never accepted partition and how the Constitution of India did not acknowledge the existence of Pakistan. India, five times the size, would gobble up Pakistan. The Hindu was to be reviled and looked upon with suspicion. Incidentally, Pakistan’s school textbooks have some of the most hateful literature you can find in any school curriculum in the world. The hate for India was thus institutionalized.  \n\nFour wars were fought, three over Kashmir. Countless acts of terror later, Pakistan is no closer to getting Kashmir than it is to speaking a coherent sentence in front of a global audience. But once you are the self-appointed Fortress of Islam and the only ‘Muslim nuclear power’, you have an inflated sense of importance.\n\nToday, the business interests of the Pak military are worth over USD 100 billion. Fauji Foundation, Shaheen Foundation, Baharia Foundation, Army Welfare Trust and the Defence Housing Authorities own about fifty different businesses. From cement to real estate, from custard to diapers, the Pakistan Army manufactures every consumable you can think of. \n\nPakistan Army breeds terrorists because they are cheaper to maintain and arm, than a regular army. It also breeds them because of the huge advantage of plausible deniability. And who can argue with the fact that Pakistani Generals are far better at making money than fighting wars?  Pakistan has outsourced its wars with India to the likes of Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar.\n\nPost Pulwama, a few things have changed irreversibly. One, Pakistan has upped the ante by introducing suicide bombing to Kashmir. Two, India’s response by launching air strikes into Pakistani territory not just in PoK but also Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has raised the bar for anti-terror response. This message that the air strikes gave was not what politicians thought it was. They were busy counting bodies. Bodies are not important because to get bodies, we could have used MBRLs or medium artillery. We could have done it from the safety of our country.  The simple act of launching fighter jets into enemy territory is an incredible statement. \n\nIt is not about Kashmir. Pakistan will remain in a state of perpetual war with India, until we are ‘cut to size’. Imagine how we must look to an insecure nation; five times the size, huge geographical area, an economy that has left Pakistan in the dust, a military that dwarfs its own and the blue passport that is respected worldwide. We are everything that Pakistan wanted to be, but never could. Jealousy breeds hatred.\n\nAfter 1989, Pakistan convinced itself that it was the sole reason for the defeat of USSR in the Afghan War. It forgot that it was just a paid middleman between the CIA and the Afghan Mujahideen.  Lt Gen Hamid Gul was the man who fanned this mad fantasy of ill equipped Holy warriors who won on the strength of their faith alone. All this is helium, off course. It was massive CIA slush funds and the infusion of weapons, including the redoubtable stingers that caused Soviet fatalities. All that welded with the Afghan warrior spirit was a little too much for the Red Army.\n\nThe more Hamid Gul lied, the more this fantasy took firm hold. If Pakistan could defeat the USSR, India would be a cakewalk. It would fall in two or three years, at the most. With this plan firmly in place, the Kashmir Jihad was launched in 1989. Flush with initial success, the ISI could almost smell the apples in Kashmir. Then, something happened that wrecked their insane plans of conquest. They ran into the Indian Army. \n\nA Kargil and hundreds of terror attacks later, Pakistan has not gained an inch of land in Kashmir. And I will say it again and again; much as Pakistan may like to weave this wobbly narrative around Kashmir, this battle has little to do with the Valley. But one thing Pakistan Army has done, with some degree of brilliance. It has convinced a vast majority of its population that there are good and bad terrorists. And, terrorism is a legitimate tool when the enemy is India.\n\n1947-48, 1965, 1971, 1993, 1999, 26/11, Punjab, Kashmir, Parliament attacks, and Akshardham temple attacks…I can go on and on. 15,000 Indian deaths later, we are no closer to peace, than we were when we gained independence.\n\nImagine a weird, hypothetical scenario, never possible in a million years. But humor me. Let us say we give Kashmir to Pakistan. Only the extremely naïve, in moments of absolute lack of lucidity, will believe that this will buy peace. It will not. \n\nA full-fledged conventional war with Pakistan will have consequences that are avoidable. There are other ways to punish Pakistan, militarily. What India lacks is a coherent and consistent policy of dealing with a rogue neighbor. It is important that we don’t lose the momentum gained by the Balakot air strikes.  We must keep our foot on the accelerator. The Pakistan Army must be in a constant state of pressure. It cannot strengthen both its Eastern and Western fronts. It is this dilemma for Pakistan that we must always seek.\n\nThe Pakistan Army is the Pakistani State. Of this I am convinced. It will have its ups and downs, its ebbs and flows. But it is also true that since 1947, it has defined the idea of Pakistan. It is the self-proclaimed guardian of Pakistan’s ideological frontiers.\n\nThere can never be peace with Pakistan unless Pakistan becomes a democracy in the truest sense. For that, the Pakistan Army will have to cease to be the center of gravity of that nation. \n\nGreek legend speaks of a female monster called Medusa, whose stare would turn men into stone and who had snakes in place of hair. This terrifying being destroyed everything in her path. The only way to end her terror was to behead her. Perseus, the Greek warrior, did this. By this act of beheading Medusa, he brought peace to Sarpedon. \n\nIt is time to cut off the head of Medusa.\n\nMajor Gaurav Arya (Veteran)\n17th Battalion, The Kumaon Regiment\n\n#MajorGauravArya #Medusa #adgpi #IndianArmy'<br />Author: 'prasad_knew'  id: 'b0m17n'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/b0m17n/medusa/</li>

The benefits accrued by Indians  in India should go to the west. That is their ultimate goal, and to  achieve it, **they use the western media to create anti-establishment sentiment and KEEP THE RULING GOVERNMENT AS WEAK AS POSSIBLE**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's an update:\n\n[https://fair.org/home/when-india-tries-to-regulate-amazon-us-media-qualms-about-monopoly-disappear/](https://fair.org/home/when-india-tries-to-regulate-amazon-us-media-qualms-about-monopoly-disappear/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe article is long, but worth a read if you're wondering where the western media gets its motivations from. Here are some highlights:\n\n \n\n&gt;So while commentators are at least beginning to worry about [**Amazon**’s emerging monopoly](https://www.thenation.com/article/amazon-doesnt-just-want-to-dominate-the-market-it-wants-to-become-the-market/)  here at home, this concern does not extend to countries like India, exposing the underlying neocolonial disposition of corporate media:  **Business practices that may be intolerable for the mother country should  nonetheless be encouraged at the colonial periphery.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Although understanding India’s unique historical struggle to secure  its political and economic sovereignty is essential to comprehending the  dynamics of the present standoff, corporate media chose instead to  paint a picture for readers using more familiar—but fundamentally  erroneous—analogies to a Western context.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Whenever abuses by monopolies become so egregious as to provoke  popular resistance, corporate media’s shallow coverage tends to cast  aside the real story in favor of a staged battle royale between moguls (**FAIR.org**,[ 8/18/17](https://fair.org/home/net-neutrality-reduced-to-mogul-vs-mogul-in-corporate-medias-shallow-coverage/)). A similar trend emerged once again as India’s position on FDI in e-commerce evolved.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[**Recalling the decimation**](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/16/17980424/shop-local-jeremiah-moss)  **of American mom-and-pop shops would arouse sympathy among a US audience  but, sadly, erasing the plight of ordinary Indians isn’t the only  diversionary tactic that corporate media have employed to spin this  story.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Despite their openness to a new conceptualization of antitrust that  is responsive to the dynamics of modern industry in the United States,  **corporate media are aghast at the implementation of such an approach to  forestall US monopolies in another country like India. And despite  adopting a banner of vanguard resistance against Trumpism, corporate  media position themselves alongside Trump in his effort to undermine  India’s economic sovereignty.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The only way to explain these inconsistencies is to acknowledge the latent neocolonial attitude that governs corporate media’s treatment of  familiar issues whenever they cross the US border.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**No one yet knows what the future will hold for India’s online retail  economy, or the US corporations salivating at the chance to take a bite  out of it, but it should go without saying that this future is India’s  to decide for itself. US media need to quit the role of corporate  cheerleader for once and leave Indians to it.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonopolies in America = bad. Monopolies in India = good. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlways remember: **WESTERN MEDIA ARGUES FOR THE INTEREST OF WESTERN CORPORATIONS**.

      <li>Title::: "I am being accused of Rape by an elderly Woman who I don't even know"<br />Body: 'This is kind of long,  but will cover the whole story\n\nMy name is Ian \\[18 Y/o Male\\], I live in Mumbai, India, My family gives out our villa for rent to film shooting people from the past 20 years, my villa is in part of a village where the roads are bad and there is not enough of space for traffic to flow, however we always try to make space as there are Make-Up vans that have to enter the Villa Compound to park.\n\nThe Neighbour hood is harsh and violent and is a mix of communal territories, they usually have a problem with our film shooting even though its not affecting them in any way, there is no light no sound, all our crew\'s vehicles are parked inside the compound, the neighbor hood always has a problem with us and always tries to stop our business since we are a minority in this area. However, we have a license to run this business.\n\nSo yesterday (11-03-2019) we had a booking for a shoot, everything was going well except there was an issue with the Trucks (Carrying Lighting equipment coming in) The people in the area avoid traffic and road rules and regulations, there is often double parking or Illegal Parking of Vehicles on the road for which we have complained many times to the authorities but no big action was taken.\n\nThe villa has 2 Big Gates and 1 small gate, The Main big gate opens outside towards the road hence if there is any car parked in front of my gate, then we wont be able to open it.\n\nThe Second Big Gate opens inside the villa, but there are always bikes parked outside that gate, restricting access to my villa (as i said the neighbor hood does not follow the traffic regulations and since we are minority they may be thinking that we can\'t do anything)\n\nThese roads are always blocked by Illegal Parking, keep in mind that this is a road without any footpath, there shouldn\'t be parking allowed any which ways, My Villa is made up of 70% Wood, if there is a fire - how will the Fire-brigade/Ambulance enter into our lane and come for rescue?\n\nHowever we have struggled to tell people to not park infront of our gate and at the turns as it causes a problem for our vans to enter into our villa, These people are more of Thugs (Gundas) and act like they own the area, due to their communal strenght. We still manage to get the Vans in and make sure all the Shoots are going smooth.\n\nWe are a family of 4 (Me, My Elder Brother, My Mother and my Father) + our helper who is our Maid + Our Dog (German Shepherd)\n\nWe have been living here from the past 25 Years, this Villa is 178 Yrs Old and was built during the Portuguese era. My dad is the Legal Owner of this Property.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**------- The Back Story ----**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo as i said the community we live in is not very nice, when the area started to get developed 10 years ago, most of the houses developed are Buildings and are illegal (They are above 4 stories and have not left the required ft. area from the road before building) anyways, we did not have a problem at first but these people have got jealous (assumption) of our business as they only strike us when there is a film shooting going on, They tell us that it is illegal, they try stopping the shoot by trespassing our property and cutting the electricity, once they even called a big mob (around 35-40 people) and were harassing and abusing us. They have also vandalized the property once upon a time and also threw rocks at a film shooting client once. We are living in the 21st Century and still these people have such manners?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey purposely park their cars in front of our gate to obstruct our Client\'s Vans and Trucks from coming into our Compound, there are some people who also imitate their parking as they think its alright to park and that is a parking space, but in reality its not, We even have signs on our gate that request people to not park in front of our gate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe always call the Police and inform them, the Police have taken action accordingly also the Police tell us that whatever we are doing is legal, is ok and we can continue to carry on our business, whenever there is a problem the police always come for help, they disburse the mob or crowd that is causing trouble, for that i am very grateful to them, The Police understand our problem but they do not have the power to just make that area a no parking zone as there are many legal procedures and paper work to be done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have attempted to write such letter to the Traffic Ward but there is no reply from them sometimes or no action could/can be taken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Coming back to yesterday\'s incident....**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had a booking, Our Clients came and they were preparing for the shoot, they had to get their makeup van inside, but it was difficullt as there was a car that doubled parked on the intersection of the road, however we managed to get the car shifted and with great difficulty we got the vans inside, however the light van also had to come and it fitted inside the compund but only a slight part of the van was on the road (say about 1 feet and the gate was kept open only) There was no problem we always keep the gates open during the shoot as the film shooting crew is usually large (around 100 - 150 people) so they come in and out and everything goes smooth, There was no problem of traffic and no issues with part of the van being slightly outside of the villa (it was so minorly outside the villa as if a person is standing on the demarcation of the gate border)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**--- The Rape Accusation &amp; how it probably started ---**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, There is a husband and wife duo who are elderly and always cause problem along with the rest of the community to our business from the past 5 years. They are of a different community\n\nAfter a while, the same people who always cause problems came and started screaming and shouting saying that we are blocking the way etc etc.\n\nI WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT - **THERE WERE OTHER CARS, VEHICLES, ETC THAT DID NOT BELONG TO US PARKED OUTSIDE THE LANE THAT WAS CAUSING EVEN A BIGGER PROBLEM FOR TRAFFIC AND STILL THESE PEOPLE WERE HAVING A PROBLEM WITH OUR VAN BEING SLIGHTLY OUTSIDE OUR OWN COMPOUND?!**\n\nThe fact that they caused so much of screaming and shouting, it became a very big scene and a crowd started to gather, My mother and maid who were present at the Villa came to confer with the Husband and Wife who were causing trouble (I was not present at the Villa as I was in College at the Time) after continuous Abusing my clients and Mother they went back.\n\nThe shoot was going well and smooth, and the whole film crew also knew who was in the right, The Husband and wife live 4-5 Blocks away from my house, why do they have a problem with us doing our business? Even if they had a problem they could of easily told us OR requested us OR Call the Police. But instead they tried to take matters in their own hands..\n\nI returned Home from college, the shoot was going alright, 3-4 hours pass and then again at around 7:00 PM, the Husband and Wife Return to Threaten us and the Film Crew that they will cause trouble, They started banging the Van that was parked slightly outside the main big gate.\n\nI was upstairs working on my Internship Projects and heard that there is a fight or some sought of problem so I went downstairs and **saw the Woman and Husband trespass my Property and screaming at my Mother** and the Film shooting crew.\n\nThe Wife - **She was an elderly fat woman and was constantly abusing**, Right enough I went outside on my front yard where they were screaming inside my property and told the Woman to "Get out of my Property!" as I know my rights and am studying a law subject in college, I told her continuously to get out of the property (as she was trespassing private property and harassing us, under the Indian Penal Code she has committed an Offence)\n\n**This is when things get out of hand**\n\nWhen i told her "Get Out", **she caught my left hand tried to pull me towards her** and was pulling me outside of my villa compound (**This was seen by the whole shooting crew and photo and video evidence has also been recorded**) She **did not leave my hand and kept on pulling me** while her husband was also abusing us, My mom came and tried to break up this hand twisting, The **Woman also pulled my Mom\'s hair**, after My Mom my maid also was telling her to leave my hand and **more people came to the rescue**, afterwards **she left my hand** and as soon as I REPEAT **as soon as I removed my phone to record the husband pulls the wifes hand and takes her out of our property.**\n\nThis was recorded on my Phone, **I have picture and Video evidence and not to forget that there was a whole crowd of my client\'s crew who also witnessed the whole situation right before their eyes**, they also come to our Aid and try to calm everyone down, I had red marks on my Hand for which i went to my kitchen to apply ice with my mom, I **have a recording of my Hand being Red with Scratch Marks**.\n\nOK, so slowly we were trying to de-escalate the situation even thought the husband and wife duo were **still causing harassment outside of my property** with their Mob, The Husband and **Wife** kept on **telling lies** about us that **WE attacked them**, but the video recording shows and witnesses know what exactly happend. They knew they were in wrong so they tried to scare us by calling a big mob and by calling the **police first and falsely complaining**.\n\nThe shooting people had anyways finished their shoot, I spoke to the producer and asked him if everything was alright, He was very nice and he said that everything was perfect and planned. He also was confused about why this couple had a problem with the shoot, he thought these people have a low mentality or are just mentally ill. However the shooting crew started to pack up...\n\nbut outside our gate was a big mob and they were **abusing the shooting crew**, Our Crew just **ignored them and got to work** as they had to go to the next location and knew that they (the trouble makers) were full of crap.\n\nThere was a big problem, they were **not allowing our Vans** that were parked in our Compound **to leave**, but the police had arrived, **we explained to the police** what happend and how **these people always create problems** for us. We also **called** the **Police** and told them about the incident, in **5 minutes** there was a Big Police Van (Riot  Controls Van) along with 2 Police SUVs who came in for protection, the Police knew that we were on the right and also tried calming my mom down as she was in huge tension.\n\nThe **Police De-Escalated the mob slowly** and the Crowd, the Film crew also was relived and was working with the dismantle of the Set in my Villa. But the **Husband and Wife duo** was **countinuosly screaming and shouting**, They knew they were in the wrong so they **started lying** about us blatantly so as to so **they said I Raped the Wife**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**(Now keep in Mind, I am a 18 yr old boy, who does not know this person in my entire life, I am clothed and was in front of the eyes of 50+ people who were witnesses and she says "I Raped and Molested her" even though she was the one who trespassed into my property and first pulled my hand towards her after i told her to "Get out of my Property" for which she tried dragging me outside my compound. She is the one who first attacked me, and now she says i Raped her? I was in shock. I would never want to harm a woman in my whole life, that to in front of so many people?)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was confused why a Woman whom i have never even met in my entire life, who trespasses my property and abuses, harasses and even harmed me, would say that i raped her?**\n\nShe **defamed me** and **my family\'s character** in Public outside the villa. The Duo **kept Lying** because they knew they did something wrong, **at one point** they even **lied about my "Maid hitting her Wife"**\n\nMy maid comes from a backward caste from Telegana in South India, She is the sweetest person who always helps us and is always there for us, She speaks softly and calmly always and has been with us for over 10 years, and the woman accuses this person who ALSO she has not met/contacted in her entire life and Accuses her of hitting her? What do they think of themselves? that they can just blatantly lie and try to put us in trouble.\n\nI said to myself, this is enough, we are going to make this right, Peacefully and Legally.\n\n**We** called and **Informed the Police**, they came and advised us to launch an **FIR/N.C Complaint** and take this matter up.

      <li>Title::: '[Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Vietnamese boat sinks in South China Sea, Ethiopian Airlines crash, and the story of Robert Hanssen'<br />Body: "Welcome to another exciting episode of the Biweekly Geopolitics Thread. After a week that has been action-packed at home, let's talk about what else made news in the world. The discussion can range from politics to sports, and it does not have to be related to India. Here are some interesting stories to get the conversation started.\n\n# Top 3 stories from India's neighbourhood:\n\n1. [Closure of Pak airspace causes havoc](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/02/28/business/closure-pakistan-air-space-snarls-flights-across-asia/#.XIafUihKjIU)\n\nAfter India and Pakistan exchanged air fire in response to the Pakistani attack on troops in Pulwama, Pakistan closed its airspace for a prolonged period of time, causing havoc for flights between Europe and SE Asia, which transit through the airspace. Travel in Bangkok's Suvaranabhumi International Airport was hit particularly badly, as thousands of tourists were stuck for several days as Thai Airlines tried to obtain permission to fly through China's airspace instead. Even after immediate tensions subsided, Pakistan continued to close its eastern airspace over Punjab and Sindh, with even domestic flights between Karachi and the capital Islamabad being routed through a western corridor. India also briefly closed its airspace at a few northwestern airports, causing some minor delays and cancellations.\n\n2. [Floods in Afghanistan leave many homeless](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/mar/06/chilling-reality-afghanistan-suffers-worst-floods-in-seven-years)\n\nAfghanistan and Balochistan suffered some of their worst flooding in a decade. This comes after a severe drought gripped the country, causing even more strife in the midst of war. Over 2,50,000 people have been displaced by these disasters, and the government as well as foreign troops stationed there are working to rescue those trapped by the floods. In Balochistan, Pakistani troops have similarly been pulled into the rescue efforts. Western countries fear that the increased displacement will lead to even more asylum seekers reaching their shores.\n\n3. [Chinese ship allegedly sinks Vietnamese fishing boat](https://www.foxnews.com/world/vietnam-says-fishing-boat-rammed-and-sunk-by-chinese-ship)\n\nThe Vietnamese government blamed a Chinese vessel for sinking a Vietnamese fishing ship with five fishermen on board off the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea. China claims the entire area for itself, which has been a source of great tension between ASEAN and China. Vietnam claims that another fishing ship rescued the fishermen, while the Chinese media reports that boat sunk for other reasons and was actually rescued by the said Chinese vessel. Whether the Chinese vessel was civilian or military is not clear.\n\n# Top 3 stories from around the world:\n\n1. [Hanoi summit fails with no Trump-Kim deal](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/08/asia/hanoi-summit-north-korea-no-agreement-intl/index.html)\n\nThe second summit meeting between US President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un ended in Hanoi, Vietnam without any deal. The summit began with high hopes from both sides on denuclearizing the Korean peninsula (and a Nobel Prize for Trump), but appeared to end when North Korea insisted that US sanctions be lifted before it denuclearize. The summit did make some history - Kim answered his first ever question to a foreign journalist during a press conference. After the summit was called off abruptly, Kim's visit was turned into a state visit to the fellow Communist nation, the first since his grandfather founded the reclusive state, complete with pomp and show.\n\n2. [Ethiopian Airlines plane crash raises questions for Boeing](http://time.com/5549031/boeing-737-stocks-down/)\n\nAn Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed within mere minutes of taking off from Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people on board, in a chilling reenactment of the crash of a Lion Air flight from Singapore just a few months ago. In both cases, the aircraft in question was a Boeing 737 MAX, and while the investigation into the Ethiopian crash is on, the Singaporean crash was blamed on a malfunctioning system on the plane. The news of the crash sent Boeing stocks crashing, with China's civil aviation authority ordering grounding of all of those aeroplanes in the country, and India's DGCA ordering an assessment. Southwest Airlines in the US, the largest buyer of the plane, has not made any moves yet.\n\n3. [Venezuela descends into darkness, literally](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47492624)\n\nVenezuela, once Latin America's richest country, has literally descended into darkness as economic mismanagement under the socialist dictatorship of President Nicolas Maduro continues. The capital city of Caracas has been plagued by an extended power outage, supposedly caused by a malfunctioning hydroelectric power plant. Local media reports that the outage has extended to more than half the country. Most of Venezuela's electricity comes from dams instead of fossil fuels, but a chronic shortage of funds for maintenance of those projects has led to many sporadic closures.  Maduro has blamed his political opponents of sabotage, together with the US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: Robert Hanssen\n\nThe history of geopolitics is riddled with spies. From Sun Tzu's nurturing of spies to aid the many Chinese wars to Chanakya's use of intelligence to unify the Indian subcontinent, human intelligence has been and remains crucial in the defense of any nation. Recruiting spies has an equally long tradition, with everything from blackmail to greed being weapons in the hands of intelligence agencies. But a rare tool that can be equally potent is ego - the desire of an individual, in the right place and time, to make a name for him or herself.\n\nRobert Hanssen, born in Chicago, was one such spy, who did it purely because he wanted to. An FBI officer with high-level security clearances, he spied for the Soviet Union and then Russia from 1979 to 2001, providing thousands of classified files and even revealing the names of CIA spies in Russia/USSR, many of whom were caught and executed by the Communists. But perhaps the most distinguishing feature of his spying career was that he recruited himself - he approached Soviet representatives himself, chose what information to supply them with, and decided drop-off points where they would be exchanged for money. The Soviets never knew his true identity, but were quite pleased with his work nonetheless.\n\nHow did Hanssen manage to run perhaps the most damaging spy ring within the US for so long without being caught? Although part of it came down to the fact that even the Soviets didn't know who he was, he was unwittingly helped by Aldrich Ames, a CIA operator who was spying for the Soviets at the same time. In a strange irony, Hanssen was actually part of many investigations on Soviet spies, making sure each time to write detailed reports that pointed entirely in the wrong direction. He even deflected blame to Ames, thus not just saving himself, but endearing himself to his superiors for his service!\n\nAfter the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Hanssen stopped his activities, but emerged again in 1992 to offer his services to the new Russian Federation. By 1999, the FBI and CIA were so frustrated that they resorted to the ultimate solution - they bribed a former KGB official $7 million to gain access to Hanssen's communications and documents that he shared. Ultimately, they were able to match a voice recording to him - with the strange coincidence that many of the FBI operatives instantly recognized his voice after having worked with him on counterintelligence operations! The FBI set up a trap for him in 2001, when he was finally apprehended. According to the FBI, his motives were basically to prove that he could do it - ego, in other words. He remains in a federal prison today, sentenced to 15 life sentences to which he pleaded guilty but showed no remorse, except for any damage done to his family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat stories from the world caught your attention?

Perhaps they expect Indian jets to take cover behind civilian aircrafts.\n   1. If so, an interesting point is why they expect another strike. Is there another terror strike planned, and the Indian strike would be in retaliation for that?\n3. Repurposing airports for military crafts (although that would only block the airports, not the flight paths).\n4. They expect an Indian strike on civilian aircrafts. This would be an irrational move because it would be disastrous diplomatically.\n5. They can't tell the difference between Indian and non-Indian aircrafts easily. Or it takes time to do so.

Government has to give us everything. I propose a few things- \n\n* Make government less powerful. Whoever is with government has way too much power for a citizen, but I see no provision for such privileges in any law. Viz. power, bungalow, drivers, servants at ministers, MP, MLA, officer\'s houses. I think its high time for the wives of officers to start cooking roti sabzi for their own family like the rest of the world. \n* Private sector and companies are still quite weak. They don\'t get their due importance, especially Indian start ups. An MNC still has a better chance to make it big in India, but when we\'re so populated why do we so less companies, such less talent? I think it\'s because everyone wants to work with government. Well learned engineers give up everything, study humanities to join government, then who will set up a company, make games, animations, coding, or better things in technology? \n* Industrial revolution is stunted in India. 4th revolution has to be all about technology and innovation. I think we fail to recognize how progressive other countries are in terms of technology. Apart from Bangalore and except the already big international companies, we\'re not making any technological improvements. We\'re not making original devices and original talent. \n* When you have to write an essay, you\'ll go "India has so much population and such human resources" but all this population is getting older ruining their potential, trying to get a government job so that they can live in *bhaukaal.* \n\nWhat is going wrong with India?

We\'re now finding ourselves in a multipolar world: and we\'ll have to choose between America or Russia/China.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich side should we favor? Read the thread and find out!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, there\'s an entire generation of indians that think being **non-aligned** \\- or in other words - not having any strong(er), long term diplomatic alliances with any particular country - is **BETTER**. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I completely disagree with this view.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo a logical starting point would be to **explain why alliances are useful**. What are the benefits of pursuing a strong, long term diplomatic alliance with a particular country? \n\nThere are 3 sides to it: the political, economic and sociological case, each one yielding different benefits. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.\n\nThe political case: **An alliance wins you friends**. These friends are happy to recognize the sovereignty, territorial integrity and legitimacy of your government. Aside from the obvious benefit of having a "friend" that will stand up for you - and fight for you - a political or diplomatic alliance also opens the door for cooperation on a common safe-guarding of the national interest. **It\'s easier to justify the pursuit of your own country\'s objectives if it\'s perceived as being "for the greater good". This is also known as, "strength in numbers".**\n\nIf your country feels threatened, you can call upon your "allies" to defend you on internationally recognized platforms (like the UN). Not surprisingly, diplomatic ties are built and sustained far more comfortably when a group of allies **have a demonstrated history of mutual understanding and trust**. Aren\'t you more likely to trust a person your family (or friends) have already known for a long time?\n\nIn addition to this, if two or more countries have a similar political system, laws are (more) uniform across the board, and you can call upon your allies to **establish precedent** when you\'re trying to change something. This will allow you to act in tandem on issues of trade, national security, environmental change, "human rights", and so on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. \n\nThe economic case: **Allies grow their economies together.** For a country to prosper economically, it needs RELIABLE trade partners. A simple road linking one country to another potentially allows for a free and unrestricted movement of goods. An unrestricted movement of goods **provides your population greater accessibility to markets** that might produce things you either need (or don\'t have enough of). It also allows your own country\'s businesses to sell their products with minimal intervention or bureaucratic obstacles. \n\nMore importantly, you have multiple sources of funding made available to you. Banks are more likely to support the projects pursued by companies from allied economies. This could be a huge difference maker in times of economic strife or slowdown, **your country can rely on mutually acceptable sharing of economic benefits.** \n\nThis is why relations with neighboring countries are particularly important. It\'s easier to link two economies if the borders are relatively open. It opens up the region to investment, and **allows your country to function as a larger, inter-connected economic zone** rather than as a smaller, and separate nation state. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. \n\nThe sociological case: Alliances foster greater people to people exchanges. The more you interact with people from another country, the more you\'re likely to understand, relate and even identify with them. For countries to grow closer, human contact between citizens has to become more frequent. This is often realized through fewer visa restrictions; a greater ease in obtaining work permits or college scholarships. **A passport is only as strong as its issuing country\'s alliances**! Wouldn\'t you be more likely to visit a country if it was easier to do so? If you had more reasons (or benefits) to do so?\n\nWith more people to people exchanges - human bonds are often strengthened and personalized - in the form of friendships, business ventures, and even marriages. From a sociological standpoint, a strong alliance will **help inspire common citizens outside your own borders to advocate for your country in a meaningful, well-informed and positive way.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is what non-aligned India is currently missing out on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUsing this model, focusing on the political, economic and sociological case: which country is most likely to be India\'s reliable ally? America? or China/Russia? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat would India, with an alliance with either country, look like? How would it impact India in all 3 cases?\n\nLeave your comments below. \n\n&amp;#x200B;'<br />Author: 'twatavious'  id: 'azd3xw'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/azd3xw/my_case_for_ending_indias_nonalignment_policy_do/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'How Hinduism survived in India'<br />Body: 'I found an interesting answer by u/artfulorpheus on askhistorians and it was shareworthy so here it is.\n\n&gt;When we talk about Hinduism, we are talking about a very broad group of traditions, broader even than when we say Abrahamic Faiths. Hinduism, as it stands now, incorporates thousands of individual groups many with their own distinct philosophies and worldviews that are counter to another. Most Hindus recognize the authority of the Vedas and the Upaniṣads, but not all. In any case, it is hard to talk about Hinduism as a monolithic tradition, but I will do my best.\n\n&gt;When we talk about the Influence of Monotheistic faiths, we are typically referring to Abrahamic, due to our Western bias, but what is a "monotheistic faith" in the first place. Islam decries Christianity as Shirk (idolatrous or polytheist) due to the doctrine of the trinity or worship of saints. However many Muslims also venerate saints or ward of spirits in a way that is difficult to distinguish from what they call shirk. We largely all agree that the Greeks were polytheists, but many believed in an all powerful personal god personified in a number of forms, such as the powerful Platonists of late antiquity. Bearing this in mind, now we can look at Hinduism.\n\n&gt;Hinduism is very diverse, but there are large sects and strong themes throughout. One of these is the concept of Brahman, a universal monistic principal that pervades all things. Many Hindus identify this principal with a God or entity, such as Śiva or Viṣṇu. In essence, this principal is the form of a supreme god pervading all things while the human forms and stories are merely personifications of the God. This Supreme entity varies and often exists alongside other gods, but does this make it not "monotheist?" The gods of Hindu, especially in its Bhakti incarnation, are personal, all-powerful, and all pervading, like the God of Christianity, the God of Judaism, or the God of Islam; so is it not a Monotheistic religion? Of course, not all Hindus share this view of God or gods, but I would say that the majority do.\n\n&gt;IN any case, philosophy aside, how DID Hinduism survive in India, while it did not elsewhere (such as Indonesia and the Philippines) and many other faiths didn\'t either. I think we need to move away from Monotheism as the determining factor here, after all, Zoroastrianism is almost extinct and it was Monotheist in the classical sense. Rather, we need to look at why people "convert" and how religions develop and shift.\n\n&gt;South Asia circa the tenth century was perhaps the most religiously diverse region in the world, rivaled perhaps only by China and Persia, but the later had recently seen a dramatic shift in religious policy as Islam came. That isn\'t to say that Islam destroyed religious diversity though. There is a persistent myth that Islam was intolerant and religions were swiftly crushed, however, Zoroastrianism, Nestorianism, Buddhism, and other faiths continued to an extent under Islamic rule, though some suffered more than others. In any case, the tenth century marked the incursions of Islamic Turkish invaders into India and the formation of the first Indian Sultanates. The religious policies of these Sultanates varied, with some being very active in persecuting other religions, especially in the west, but others being very open. Furthermore, early on there was an encouragement of dialogue between Islam and Hinduism. The Ghaznavid\'s encouraged this dialogue and facilitated it through scholars and polymaths, most famously Al-Biruni. Even the (somewhat questionably and unfairly) iconoclastic Dehli Sultanates often encouraged dialogue, with some like Sultana Raziya, even funding Hindu temples.\n\n&gt;There was also an economic incentive to keep Hinduism strong in the empires that ruled India. Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists had to pay the Jizya tax (and sometimes others) in order to practice while Muslims did not. This meant that every convert, while perhaps being more reliable, payed less into the tax pool. In essence, this meant that keeping the Hindus around made sense and made dynasties very rich. We also have to keep in mind that while large parts of India were controlled by Muslims, many local aristocrats and powerful land owners were Hindus who swore fealty. Most of the Persianate dynasties had a somewhat decentralized powerstructure, culminating in the Mughals whose system eventually meant that these rulers were only nominally under their control after the rule of Aurangzeb.\n\n&gt;The Mughals are very interesting as, perhaps more than any dynasty before them, they took advantage of the existing rulers and promoted religious tolerance by having a number of Hindus and Jains in fairly powerful positions. Akbar, the third emperor, even suspended the Jizya tax and promoted his own synthesis of Hinduism and Islam, under the guidance of radical Sufis. While his legacy of religious synthesis was not adopted by his successors, his policies of keeping Hindus and Jains in court were.\n\n&gt;When the British took control of India, they inherited the systems already in place. The British were largely unconcerned with converting the populace of India, or at least, the ones with the most power weren\'t. There was of course a faction that did their damndest to convert the enormous population of India, but they were not particularly successful, outside of the region of northeast India. The British also held a sort of "divide and rule" policy which encouraged the tension between religious groups to make them more submissive to the British. Furthermore, the Romantics and their successors found themselves drawn to Hindu ideals and religion, with translation efforts skyrocketing in the mid nineteenth-century.\n\n*Sources*\n\n    Raj: The Making and Unmaking of British India Lawrence James\n    Medieval India: From the Dehli Sultanate to the Mughals, Satish Chandra\n    The Hindus, Wendy Doniger\n    Al-Hind, Andre Wink\n    “The Disappearance of Buddhism and the Survival of Jainism: A Study in Contrast”, Jaini, Padmanabh S.\n    History of Indian Philosophy Podcast Jornardon Ganeri and Peter Adamson\n    Buddhism and Islam on the Silk Road John Elverskong\n\n'<br />Author: 'PATAK_KE_MARUNGA'  id: 'azbwp1'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/azbwp1/how_hinduism_survived_in_india/</li>

One of the besr summary of the current status on Indian politics I have read. \n\nSri Thiruvadanthai is a renowned and very well respected Economist based out of US. [His profile](https://www.levyforecast.com/about-us/srinivas-thiruvadanthai/)\n\nTwitter thread - https://twitter.com/teasri/status/1104393959562973184?s=19\n\nThe linked 2016 Demo article on swarjyamag, in the thread, while good, isn\'t the main focus or issue, so one can ignore that. \n\nThe thread is copied below;\n\n\nIf you want to understand current politics in India, and why the left elites are suddenly so completely at odds with the national mood, you have to start with the rise of the neo middle class in India. I tackle that here in the context of demonetisation. \n\nWhen most people were eking out subsistence, abstract notion of nation did not have widespread resonance. So, regional/ethnic/caste divisions seemed unbridgeable.\n\nHowever, it was really not unbridgeable. All you needed was development, people to progress beyond subsistence, and for people to see that their future welfare is tied to the welfare of the nation state. And that has happened in the last 40 years as economic growth has reduced extreme poverty dramatically. More important, populist policies and reservations (affirmative actions but with hard quotas), have made growth more inclusive. Many in the right hate these, but they are really stupid IMO. You cannot have a democracy in which a tiny sliver dominates all spheres of life. In bringing everyone together, India has deepened and broadened democracy while making the economic gains more resilient. The result is a neo middle class that sees its future tied to the nation state\'s success. That is why such anger ...over Phulwama, the massive support for the airstrikes, the widespread celebration of the armed forces. The left elites still clinging on to their "India is a multinational state" and it is should naturally disintegrate are flummoxed.\n\nThey are still doubling down on Hinduism was created by the British, Aryan invasion, north/south divide. The reality is that a common thread always existed but it was not politically expressed. That has been changing since 1980s and is now a major force.\n\nThe Congress is ill-equipped to address that challenge because from a big tent party it has effectively become a family party trying to exploit faultlines. It may occasionally succeed, but the long arc of history is against it.\n\nAddenda: people as they become a little more prosperous are actually becoming more interested in restoring and preserving temples, festivals etc. I was speaking to my mother the other day and she said that all the temples in her native village have undergone massive renovation. Not just that, a barely used temple has gotten new images and is being actively used now. They also restarted festivals that had been discontinued due to lack of funds. And the support cuts across caste lines.'<br />Author: 'ribiy'  id: 'az562j'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/az562j/the_current_state_of_the_country_and_politics/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'When India ordered Mirage 2000s in October 1982…'<br />Body: 'India ordered Mirage 2000s in October 1982. Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister then. India began negotiations for 150 Mirage 2000s and finally closed the deal at 40 Mirage 2000s, with an option to buy 9 more.\n\nDoesn’t it sound eerily similar?\n\n150 Mirage 2000s were discussed with Dassault and finally Congress placed orders for 40 planes only. Why?\n\n126 Rafales were discussed with Dassault and then Congress refused to confirm the order itself in this case. Why?\n\nIn both cases, “bribery” was the reason.\n\nIn 1982, when Indira Gandhi negotiating for 150 Mirage 2000s, the grapevine says Lord Swaraj Paul was the “interface”.\n\nIndira Gandhi, seemingly, asked for 2%. Lord Paul conveyed to Dassault 7% as Bribe.\n\nDeal reduced to 40 planes.\n\nLord Swaraj Paul was “famously” close to Indira Gandhi in 1980s. So close that British Intel maintained a classified dossier on it, which were declassified only recently.\n\nSuch shady deals are rumoured to be part of that relationship, including Christian Michel’s father.\n\nSimilar modus operandi was seen in Congress’ dealing of Rafale Deal. They negotiated for 126 planes. They instituted an offset clause where they wanted Robert Vadra’s company to benefit.\n\nBribery didn’t come through. Congress refused to close the deal itself, losing precious time.\n\nIn 1982, Indira Gandhi was comparatively more sensitive and closed deal with Dassault after brief negotiation. I guess we lost only few months.\n\nBut Sonia &amp; Rahul Gandhi were not equally sensitive. Deal dragged on for years with no outcome in sight. Payment of bribe was priority.\n\nToday, Congress is like a deer caught by the headlight, startled, unable to figure their course of action, unable to get a share of glory of tough decisions taken by Narendra Modi. They are begging for crumbs.\n\nCopied from this twitter thread.

A 1000 kg bomb does not necessarily decimate the structure:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; So this misses one very important point. Big penetrators spend most of their mass on the casing (to, you know, penetrate).

      <li>Title::: 'Will India become like a Latin American country in the future?'<br />Body: "I've been thinking a lot about this question. A lot of people have suggested that India's future will be similar to that of a Latin American country, like say Brazil or Mexico. Politically, it won't have the strong institutions that developed countries have while economically, it may get stuck in the middle-income trap. \n\nIndia does somewhat share a similar climate to Latin America. Culturally too, I think there are many similarities. For example, both people have a general non-compliance to the rule of law. Corruption and tax evasion are major problems in both regions and this only weakens the state's ability to govern the country. There's also a strong culture of socialism; lots of welfare schemes are promised to many groups and this causes fiscal indiscipline and less investment in infrastructure.\n\nBut India has some unlikely tailwinds. It doesn't suffer from the [resource curse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse) like Latin Americans; Indians are always reminded that they're energy, land and water deficient. Its overpopulation may actually make the masses more law-abiding and governable, because usually people who live in overpopulated countries/cities end up becoming more patient and less-entitled, out of necessity. Overtime, perhaps what worked in Japan, is working in China, could be emulated in India.\n\nWhat do you think about this question?"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'axw3ds'<br />Score:25<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/axw3ds/will_india_become_like_a_latin_american_country/</li>

But they seem to overlook this basic detail.'<br />Body: " \n\nDid anyone lookup how the Spice 2000 (the bomb used in the strikes) actually works?\n\nI saw some example, and it actually penetrates through the roof and goes into the ground and detonates with a slight delay.\n\nWhich means it is not built to destroy the buildings but cause damage inside of it. The building would still be standing, only thing that can be seen through satellite images is a hole through the roof.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/wy59zaxd6gk21.png\n\n&gt;“It first penetrates through the roof, then enters the building and explodes after a delay. It is meant to hit the command and control centres and does not destroy the building. The software has to be programmed with the type of roof – its thickness, material of construction etc. – and that, accordingly, sets the delay period for the PGM.”\n\n[https://indianexpress.com/article/india/radar-imagery-confirms-4-buildings-in-jaish-madrasa-were-hit-official-5607623/](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/radar-imagery-confirms-4-buildings-in-jaish-madrasa-were-hit-official-5607623/)\n\n&gt;The government official said that these buildings had roofs made of corrugated galvanized iron (CGI) sheets and the SAR imagery shows that on the first day, these roofs had gone missing.  \nThese CGI roofs were repaired after two days, making it difficult to assess the full damage by technical intelligence, he added.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sources also denied that any of the IAF bombs hit the hilltop at Jaba where Pakistan Army has taken a team of journalists to see some craters, and splintered trees. The military official said that “if only S-2000 PGM were fired, there is no possibility of craters or sheared trees. The PGM would go inside the earth and then explode, which would create a mound of earth instead.”\n\nReporters visited the site only after the army had already sealed the area, they all show some splintered trees and 4 craters. They say the Madrasa looks intact from where they could see it, but none of them visited it as it wasn't allowed.\n\nAlso, considering the type of bomb used it's unlikely that they'll miss the target. I believe the bombs hit the target and Pakistan Army covered it up quickly. None of the reporters are questioning the type of impact the bomb will have on the site and whether it would form craters or mounds...they were taken to the site and shown craters and they are only reporting what they were shown."<br />Author: 'yashvone'  id: 'axvzbk'<br />Score:54<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/axvzbk/did_the_bombs_miss_the_target_international_media/</li>
      <li>Title::: "Time for some positive news. Here's a couple of ancient links about how much things have changed for India"<br />Body: 'From 1974: [India, Badly Needing Aid, Hails Visiting Shah of Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/03/archives/india-badly-needing-aid-hails-visiting-shah-of-iran.html)  \n  \nExcerpts:  \n  \n&gt; The Shah is in a position to help India substantially in her serious economic crisis marked by food shortages and high prices. The bulk of India\'s oil imports come from Iran, and the price increase last year has resulted in huge Indian trade, deficits with that country.\n\n&gt; **Iran has already extended long‐term credit for oil purchases. Further credit, or the supply of crude oil in exchange for Indian exports, would enable India to divert her scarce foreign exchange resources to the purchase of more wheat and other grains. This would reduce her dependence on concessional supplies from the United States or the Soviet Union.**\n\n&gt; India imports 10 million tons of crude oil from Iran out of total oil imports of 17 million tons.  \n  \nThis was 45 years ago, when most of our parents were young adults. The country has changed for the better and will continue improving. Don\'t let any numbskull with an agenda tell you otherwise.  \n  \nFrom 1992: [India Stumbles in Rush to a Free Market Economy](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/15/world/india-stumbles-in-rush-to-a-free-market-economy.html)  \n  \n&gt; The range of issues addressed in the report included the structure of agriculture in the country, from which 70 percent of India\'s 850 million people still earn their livelihood. "The stagnation in agriculture is the sign of some fundamental problems, but the Government has yet to articulate a comprehensive program for rejuvenating the sector," it said. It also noted the budget-guzzling appetite of the state\'s insolvent enterprises, and the reduction of subsidies, intended for the poor, but which, in the report\'s analysis, "accrue mostly to richer farmers."\n\n&gt; Fiscal and financial problems remain acute, with only **7 million out of a total population of 850 million paying any form of income tax**. Farmers, no matter what their income, pay no income tax and still receive huge subsidies on fertilizer purchases, and get all their electricity free, a grant that accounts for 4 percent of the country\'s gross domestic product. Criticism From World Bank\n\n&gt; The World Bank report was severely critical of India\'s maze of regulations on private investment, both domestic and foreign, and urged they be gutted. The Bank also called for hastening the closing of bankrupt state-controlled industries. **An example cited by the Bank\'s report is a government fertilizer plant built in Haldia in 1980 that employs 3,000 workers; it has yet to produce a single ton of fertilizer. In India\'s 45 years of independence, no state industry, no matter how inefficient, how bankrupt, has ever been closed.**\n\n&gt; So cumbersome still are the bureaucratic hurdles to investment, **that Motorola, which intended to invest $1.4 billion in India over the next decade, has thrown up its hands in frustration and has decided to move some of those investments to China**. In the first three months of this year, China received $6.5 billion in foreign investment; in contrast, during the same period India has approved only $300 million in foreign investment.     \n  \nThis was 27 years ago. What took the West several generations took us two generations to achieve. We shouldn\'t rest on our laurels yet because we have threats that can steal our thunder (a stable Africa, automation, global warming, internal divisions) but anyone who suggests India is totally shit doesn\'t know what they\'re on about.  \n  \nThe equivalent of what we\'ve achieved is: a little hut in rural MP we have now moved to a LIG apartment complex in Delhi, all on our own with our smarts.

      <li>Title::: "Death by a Thousand Cuts - Pakistan's policy of covert warfare in India part 1"<br />Body: 'This is going to be a 30,000 feet overview of Pakistani adventurism in India over the ages, why does Pakistan do what it does, and lastly a bit of armchair theory crafting on why Pulawama and how can India respond\n\n\xa0\n\nAfter a tumultuous start in 1947 what with the partition and the war in Kashmir, relations settled on an uneasy keel for the next 3 years when the first flashpoint erupted. India after ratifying it’s constitution, formed the constituent assembly in Kashmir in 1950. This caused Pakistan to take the matter to the UN Security council as it saw a clear violation of the UN resolutions on Kashmir. India responded saying it was well within its terms and that this would not affect any upcoming plebiscite. Things took a nasty turn after this with Pakistan accusing India of mustering its army and parking it on the Indo Pak front, India in return said that she wanted peace and accused Pakistan in turn of wanting war and increasing troop concentrations on the frontier. The Commonwealth (which still held a lot of power back then) came up with a way to diffuse the tension, it suggested that the Commonwealth send troops to Kashmir, with a complementary unit of Indo Pakistani troops also in support and then the plebiscite to be held. As these were in clear violation of the UN resolutions (which asked for a total withdrawal of all Pakistani units before a plebiscite), India rejected these terms. Then in 1953, the then CM, Sheikh Abdulla said that a plebiscite must be held, to which the Nehru govt sacked him and then arrested him triggering the first mass demonstrations on the streets of Kashmir and the first deployment of the army / paramilitaries to stop the protests. \xa0\n\n\xa0\n\nFirst Plebiscite offer – Nehru then decided that a plebiscite was the only way to resolve the issue and informed the then Pakistani PM, Bakshi Mohd of his intentions to hold a plebiscite, something that Bakshi readily agreed to but then the first major geopolitical shift intervened. Pakistan in 1955 signed the so called Baghdad Pact (CENtral Treaty Organisation-CENTO) and formally became a US ally, and the US started funnelling arms into Pakistan. Nehru was alarmed by this and figured that a UN / US observed plebiscite wouldn’t be neutral and unilaterally walked out of the offer of plebiscite.\n\n\xa0\n\nBy now the cold war was heating up and India was drifting towards the Soviet Union, but Nehru was still trying a juggling act by allowing the CIA bases in India to operate into Tibet, this and other causes (out of scope) triggered the Sino Indian war and this caused India to drift closer to the orbit of the Soviet Union (for arms and support) and away from the US. Pakistan in the meantime solidified its position as a key US ally in the region and both arms and money continued to flow into Pakistan.\n\n\xa0\n\nEnabled by what Pakistan saw as Indian weakness (defeat in the Sino-Indian war) and coupled with a growing network of insurgencies and asymmetrical warfare across the world, she decided that the time was ripe to pluck Kashmir by a guerrilla warfare campaign. You must keep in mind that in the 60’s and indeed through to the 80’s even, Pakistan’s army was qualitatively better off (with the best in US arms) than the much larger but poorly funded Indian army and this emboldened Pakistanis planners.\n\n\xa0\n\n**Operation Gibraltar** - This plan was a repeat of 1947 (and indeed 1999 Kargil) with the idea being that no less than 50,000 Pakistani regulars would be ‘infiltrated’ into Kashmir, they would start a general insurrection / rebellion, and quickly seize Kashmir allowing regular Pakistani units to occupy Kashmir, sue for peace and bring a solution to the Kashmir question. Good plan in paper, but horribly executed on the ground. In July 1965, the plan was set in notion and 10’s of thousands of Pakistani regulars dressed up as irregular Mujahideen flooded into the valley. They divided into 9 columns with different objectives and start Op Gibraltar.\n\n\xa0\n\nExcept it was an unmitigated disaster from the get go. The Pakistani army didn’t even bother informing the Pakistani airforce, the “mujhaideen” chosen did not even speak the local Kashmiri dialect in most cases and stood out like a sore thumb. No less than 10 of them were captured right at the start and paraded on All India Radio where they openly spilled the beans, and Indian Intelligence quickly pinpointed where these 9 columns were and destroyed them piecemeal. Only one even managed to meet its first objectives before being turned back. Equally importantly, the rebellion never happened because the local Kashmiri population didn’t care for the Pakistani invasion and simply sat at home waiting for the conflict to blow over. The Indian army pulverised these ‘rebels’ thus forcing Pakistan to launch a general open war, the war of 1965 that ended in Stalemate.\n\n\xa0\n\nThe East Pakistan War (Bangladesh war) of 1971 though was what truly caused Pakistan’s policies to change. The scale of losses and the sheer ineffectiveness of the Pakistani military put paid to any notions of even notional superiority with India. Post 1971, the Soviet Union accelerated deliveries of some of the latest arms techs to match US deliveries to Pakistan thus even the edge of quantity Pakistan had was now gone. That this was clear to Pakistani planners is clear when Zuliqar Ali Bhutto decided and declared that the only way to defeat India was to bleed her to death by a thousand cuts.\n\n\xa0\n\n**Death by a Thousand Cuts** - Just what does this mean? Simple, it means use covert means to fund insurgencies and rebellions (Khalistan, Kashmir, Maoists) and destroy India from within while maintaining plausible deniability. If it sounds familiar it is because this is exactly what Pakistan has been doing for decades now. How can India respond to a bomb blast in Delhi or Coimbatore? Especially when Pakistan publicly denies any knowledge of these terrorists? This is what is called ‘plausible deniability’.\n\n\xa0\n\nFrom 1971 to 1979, this was the general strategic direction of Pakistan’s policymakers, but they had two key constraints,\n\n\xa0\n\nThe valley was pretty much at peace and the local populace not interested in any general rebellion (as proven by 1947 and 1965)\n\nMoney – This was a big constraint. While Pakistan’s per capita GDP was higher than India’s (or even China’s) at this point, they were still a much smaller economy and there was not much money to be spared for funding insurgencies in India\n\n\xa0\n\n**The paradigm shift of 1979 and Operation Cyclone**\n\n\xa0\n\nThis however changed drastically in 1979 when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Pakistan’s policy of death by a thousand cuts got a massive boost of adrenaline and was hypercharged. To put it simply (as it is out of scope), the US still smarting from its defeat in Vietnam saw in Afghanistan, the Soviet Union’s own Vietnam, a chance to weaken her main foe in a bloody endless war. This though had its own set of challenges,\n\n\xa0\n\nAfghanistan is a landlocked country, it is surrounded by countries hostile to the US, Iran and the Soviet Union but on one border it had Pakistan, a key US ally\n\nIn Vietnam, the Soviet Union and China could both legitimately fund the South Vietnamese Government as it was govt – govt dealings, but in Afghanistan, the govt itself was a Soviet puppet and the resistance was lead by a 10’s of different Muslim warlords. Juxtaposed against the Iranian revolution with crowds of Muslims baying for American blood (the nuance of them being Shiite while these rebel warlords were mostly Sunni would have been lost on the American populace then and now) wouldn’t have gone down well with the American people. How to get the arms and money to these rebel leaders was another question that plagued the American policy makers\n\nFunding – Initially at least, the Mujahideen (Afghan resistance) wasn’t a glamourous cause amongst US senators and finding money for the project was difficult and only a pittance was raised in the first couple of years, so they needed to solve the funding issue also.\n\n\xa0\n\nThe US solved the first and the second by one simple solution – Use the ISI as a conduit and for the third, the ISI proposed a solution, it brought on board the Saudi intelligence (GID) who agreed to match dollar to dollar, US funding. While this helped the US achieve its global aims, it was the ISI that benefited the most as it was purely in the drivers seat. The ISI decided who got what arms, how much money if at all and what support. Do note, all this money was black bagged and completely unaccounted for.\n\n\xa0\n\nBy 1986, fully $ 2 billion a year ($ 1 billion each from the CIA and GID) was flowing directly into the coffers of the ISI, pure unaccounted cash. To put things into perspective, the GDP of Pakistan in 1985 was $ 30 bn, so money equal to roughly 6% of their entire GDP was coming in as pure hard currency. Now further consider the fact that in the mid 80’s, Pakistan’s entire defense budget itself was around $ 3-3.5 bn a year and the numbers become stark. The much ISI had a buying power equal to that of the Pakistani military, and on a per capita basis, the ISI far outstripped any other branch of the Pakistani apparatus in terms of sheer clout and muscle. This excludes the unofficial monies flowing from “charities” that also went into ISI coffers, all told they had a net inflow of $ 3bn at the peak of the Soviet – Afghan war. Zia (then President) made it explicitly clear to the US and Saudis that only the ISI would have any direct contact with the Mujahideen which meant all the money would flow into one source and all the guns and ammunition would also be given to the ISI.\n\n\xa0\n\n**Wahabbisation of Pakistan**\n\n\xa0\n\nAll along you also had the growing influence of radical Wahabi preachers in Pakistan. From an estimated 180 madrassas in 1947 to nothing less than 15,000 by 1980 the growth of Wahabbi Islam funded Madrassas was explosive. This excludes the unregistered ones of which we have no way of estimating, but most counts put this number at around 25,000 madrassas by the mid 1980’s. This was reflected in not just the ground level population but in the leadership of Pakistan itself. Just look at the director generals of ISI itself. A Ghulam Jilani Khan (ISI head from 1971-78) was a westernised Pakistani elite whose founding education was in Doon School India. The next ISI DG, Mohd Razi Khan was shortlived, but his devout nature was a key feature of his personality. The next ISI DG, Akthar Abdu Rahaman (1979-89) and one who stamped his legacy on Pakistani policy was even more devoutly Muslim, and in a letter to Zia (the then Pakistani President) swore his allegiance to Zia personally and to the Jihad (in Afghanistan). So in a short span of 3 years, the ISI leadership went from a westernised secular one to one that saw Jihad and Islamic holy war as a key component of its duties. The DG’s who followed like Hameed Gul were even more conservative Muslims (Gul even founded a conservative Islam based political party).\n\n\xa0\n\nThe potent cocktail was ready, money, arms and the only thing missing was the spark.\n\n\xa0\n\nKhalistan!\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'axiey8'<br />Score:92<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/axiey8/death_by_a_thousand_cuts_pakistans_policy_of/</li>

I would like to share on this platform information about Lionbridge with whom I have been working for some time. Most of the r/workonline opportunities don't work in India. You need a laptop/desktop and good googling skills and decent internet.\n\nLink of their website: http://www.thesmartcrowd.com/workers/job-opportunities/country/india/#jobs-list\n\nLet me share the process:\n\nFirst of all you need to upload your CV and answer their preliminary questions.\n\nFair warning: The complete process from uploading you application to getting your first payment may take 4 months easily depending on how well you progress.\n\nIf they feel you are the right fit, they get back and give you access to a 200 page document from which you will be tested.\n\nYou then get access to the final exam for which you are given 1 week to 10 days to complete. This is the tricky part as many people have written on r/workonline that you need to answer above 80% to pass the test.\n\nNow all this is unpaid work from your side, you may have to spend between 10-20 hours to read the guidelines and give the test.\n\nIf you fail the test, which is very very likely in first attempt, they usually get back to you to give another chance and the whole process repeats.\n\nAfter passing the test, you may get complete access in 5-10 days and you start rating. The payment is monthly in you bank account via SWIFT. First payment comes ~40 days after the end of the month whenever you start.\n\nDoing their minimum work depending on which program you are working, you can easily earn 10k doing minimum work and I have known people who have been earning 40-60k per month doing the max grind which is 20hrs/week and 80hrs/month.\n\nThe tasks are repetitive and you will easily get bored but that's the job. For example, in one job you may be checking accuracy of businesses and their map location while in other you may be looking up what you think of the results which pop-up.\n\nThis type of work is very useful to major internet giants who make the AI think like a human. The pay rates are shitty compared to what they pay globally but that's about it.\n\nPS:If you have any questions, would be happy to answer. Also, if you have personal experience with any work from home opportunity, please share in comments.\n\nAlso, I am not getting paid to write this post.

      <li>Title::: 'Why I believe Modi is the real peacemaker in the India- Pakistan faceoff!'<br />Body: 'Unless you\'ve been living under a rock, you\'d know that India had conducted an airstrike in Pakistani territory in response to Pulwama suicide bombing which killed more than 40 CRPF men in Kashmir, India. The terror outfit Jaish-e-mohammad took responsibility of the attack. Feb 26 airstrikes by India were conducted on a major installation of this terror outfit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the situation was expected to go, Pakistan vowed retaliation. On Feb 27, 24 F-16s and JF-17s progressed towards Indian side. In response to this infiltration attempt, India scrambled 8 jets ( MIG-21 Bison, Mirage 2000 and Sukhoi 30MKI ). In this Dog fight, one of the F-16 of Pakistan was shot down by a MIG 21 BISON. However, the MIG also crashed and it\'s pilot, W.C Abhinandan landed on the Pakistani side. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPakistan PM had made 2 attempts to  "persuade " (in their own terms) India to de-escalate. Coupled with the release of W.C, Pakistan PM is being promoted as a candidate for Nobel peace prize by their media and citizen alike. BUT IS THIS THE ONLY PERSPECTIVE ?\n\nIf one changes the shades and sees through Modi\'s eye, the situation looks all rehearsed by the Indian side with nothing (much) really going off tracks. So yes, Prime Minister Modi decided to take action on terror outfit. The objective of the mission? To eliminate the chief commanders and key people of JEM who provide strategic and logistic support to this terror outfit. The airstrikes made sure that this was achieved. In a press briefing, the Indian Foreign secretary confirmed a **"non- military, preemptive action ".**  \n\nThe words matter a lot in international diplomacy and hence the need to put them out there in bold. Since this is not a military action, the action *cannot* be treated as an act of war and at best, as an aggressive violation of airspace. But unless it is declared as a *"state of war"*(as required by Hague convention) by any one side, the situation at best can be defined as an *" armed conflict "*, thus triggering the Article 2 of Geneva convention (which only means that the conditions of Geneva conventions relating to treatment of soldiers, POWs, nurses etc now apply under Article 12). \n\nOkay, so Pakistan did react but this time hitting **"military installations" ,**as confirmed during the joint press brief of all the three forces of India.  This does translates down to an act of war as it gives a logical excuse to any country to declare an official state of war. However, India did not choose to do so. \n\nAlso, in his request to de-escalate, Pakistan, a state with $2Bn as forex, talked about how nuclear war would be disastrous for the region. But wait a second, even mentioned war? Did Government of India or any of the representatives of the armed forces even mention the word \'WAR\' when they were being blackmailed by the terms such as "nuclear" from the other side? I don\'t count the war room experts of ABP news as official spokespersons for India, sorry. \n\nWhile watching France24 debate on this issue, I heard a unique point being mentioned by a panelist who said that Modi\'s continued engagements with scheduled functions showed a complete lack of leadership. I found it interesting because his continued engagements at different events showed how disinterested the Government of India was in a war that was almost a reality to the TRP freaks and keyboard warriors. It also showed how India was calling the bluff of Pakistan out in the open. \n\nWas Indian reaction to the inbound Pakistani jets wrong? Isn\'t it the duty of IAF and other armed forces to react as bravely as they did? Isn\'t it logical that India offered no negotiations on the  capture of W.C Abhinandan, making it clear that the Pakistan side must release it ? Isn\'t it logical that India took the matter to UNSC the day airstrikes were conducted , thanks to the French? Would a country, interested in war or escalation of conflicts approach an international body on security ? Isn\'t it logical that few hours into the announcement of visit of Saudi FM to Islamabad and a interesting remark the US president, PM Imran khan offers a peace gesture? \n\nTruth is, the whole narrative of war was created by Pakistan and fueled by the TRP hungry news channel. India and it\'s leadership are the real peacemakers here because we defeated the narrative of war, pressurized Pakistan a BBC gaffe and also called the bluff that Pakistan takes with itself to the table.

      <li>Title::: 'The real reason why the western media (BBC, NYT, CNN, WAPO, etc.) biased against India'<br />Body: 'u/abyssdweller3300 asks: \n\n&gt; Can  we talk more about this? Why are they like this? What could be the  reasons they act as an organized system against India? I can understand  BBC but why the others like NYT and WAPO?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will answer this question. \n\nIts not the first time I have heard someone from India - often young - and growing up in a vastly improved country, wondering why the western media\'s coverage of India doesn\'t match their own reality. \n\nYou could pin this, if you like, u/metaltemujin\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere\'s why:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.\n\nThe first and most important thing to remember as you read this is, **the western government USES DEMOCRACY AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR REGIME CHANGE**. \n\nRepeat this sentence to yourself, and memorize it. Keep in the back of your mind as you read everything else. \n\n**the west USES DEMOCRACY AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR REGIME CHANGE**. **the west USES DEMOCRACY AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR REGIME CHANGE**. **the west USES DEMOCRACY AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR REGIME CHANGE**. **the west USES DEMOCRACY AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR REGIME CHANGE**. **the west USES DEMOCRACY AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR REGIME CHANGE**. \n\nGood? Let\'s move on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor those that aren\'t aware, western media portrays every non-western country - not just india - the exact same way - inferior countries that "NEED" democracy. \n\n**If we have to describe western media in a nutshell, we can therefore say that it has a very strong "pro democracy bias**". Here\'s the head of the BBC saying it unashamedly:  \n\n*"The  millions announced today will help the BBC deliver on our commitment to  uphold global democracy through accurate, impartial and independent  news reporting.* [*https://news.yahoo.com/britain-boost-world-bbc-funding-soft-power-201636697.html*](https://news.yahoo.com/britain-boost-world-bbc-funding-soft-power-201636697.html)\n\nThe same rhetoric is seen in America, "Democracy dies in darkness" is WaPO\'s official line, and so on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy is democracy so important to the west? \n\n**Because the only way the west can protect its competitive advantage by pushing democracy onto others**. Think about it: it\'s much easier to fight your rivals when they\'re fighting amongst themselves. \n\nDemocracy requires a population to have 2 or more political choices. In a democratic country, if the ruling government acts against western interests, the west can simply back the opposition and replace it with a more favorable regime. \n\nHowever, in countries with STRONG, MAJORITARIAN GOVERNMENTS, regime change is next to impossible. For this reason, the west never stops attacking China and Russia for its lack of "democratic values". China, russia, and iran have STRONG MAJORITARIAN GOVERNMENTS that will rule long into the future. The western world is terrified of the competition, and rightly so.\n\n**STRONG, MAJORITARIAN GOVERNMENTS are a competitive threat to the west, because** they\'re more likely to put their own country\'s interest first, more difficult to manipulate and most importantly, and worryingly, **less likely to bend to western interests.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Therefore, the western media\'s objective - or editorial point of view - is to ensure that ANY ruling government ANYWHERE outside the west looks AS WEAK AS POSSIBLE.** Alternatively, they want to prevent the formation of any STRONG, MAJORITARIAN GOVERNMENTS that can challenge their "global democracy", or rules based order. \n\nHow do they do this? By giving a platform to every single minority or "marginalized" voice. By promoting these voices, they weaken the ruling government**, create and popularize arguments against the government\'s policies, incite social discord and ensure continuity of a democratic order.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo this end, Western media is known to have a very strong representation of MINORITY or opposition views. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow does this apply to India? \n\nThe modi government and the BJP are a STRONG, MAJORITARIAN GOVERNMENT. \n\nThey could easily end up dominating Indian politics. \n\nThey openly and unashamedly speak of a "congress mukt" (or opposition mukt) bharat. \n\nAll this is terrifying to the west, **because they feel that the BJP could easily position itself against western political and economic interests.** \n\nThis isn\'t specifically about the BJP by the way - the west would treat ANY OTHER STRONG MAJORITARIAN GOVERNMENT in India, the exact same way. \n\nThe only way to ensure India doesn\'t have a STRONG, MAJORITARIAN GOVERNMENT, is by undermining every single policy and misrepresenting it as a complete failure. Present the whole country as a failure. The objective is to create a lack of trust within the general population, so **any ruling government remains weak, despised and ALWAYS open to western influence.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is why reuters, BBC, NYT, WAPO, CNN, etc. routinely attack the ruling government and act as a front for the opposition parties. This is why India\'s "liberal" western educated journalists often write columns and report on behalf of western media. This is why the once inept nobodies like arundhati roy, john dayal, kancha ilaiah have become celebrities in the western world. This is why indians with American citizenship become "founding editors" of foreign funded anti-establishment websites like "the wire". This is why kashmir isn\'t on the Indian map on western news channels. This is why hinduism is portrayed as primitive and violent. This is why muslims are "in danger". This is why women are "unsafe". This is why the "Make in india" scheme is repeatedly undermined. This is why effective government led initiatives like aadhar and ruPay are constantly attacked for "privacy leaks". This is why giving gas cylinders and bank accounts to villagers is termed as "populism". This is why Ambani, adani and any indian industralist generating jobs for the betterment of indian society is portrayed as a corrupt scumbag, a "crony capitalist", while we\'re told to unconditionally LOVE and RESPECT Jeff bezos, zuckerberg and of course...the modern day puppet nawab "indians" with american citizenship working for the modern day East india companies, google and microsoft....sundar pichai and satya nadella. This is why the space program, the bullet train, and even the IPL are portrayed as "luxuries" that shouldn\'t exist in a country of "poor people". I could go on and on...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe point is...western media exists to DESTROY any possibility of a STRONG, MAJORITARIAN GOVERNMENT in India that works for the benefit of the people. \n\nFor the west, Any wealth generated in India, HAS to have western involvement. The benefits accrued by Indians in India should go to the west. That is their ultimate goal, and to achieve it, **they use the western media to create anti-establishment sentiment and KEEP THE RULING GOVERNMENT AS WEAK AS POSSIBLE**. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce again,\n\n**the west USES DEMOCRACY AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR REGIME CHANGE**. **the west USES DEMOCRACY AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR REGIME CHANGE**. **the west USES DEMOCRACY AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR REGIME CHANGE**. **the west USES DEMOCRACY AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR REGIME CHANGE**. **the west USES DEMOCRACY AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR REGIME CHANGE**. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL: DR, read the bold print. \n\n&amp;#x200B;'<br />Author: 'twatavious'  id: 'awylbj'<br />Score:135<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/awylbj/the_real_reason_why_the_western_media_bbc_nyt_cnn/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'PROVE ME WRONG: The western world has less "freedom of speech" than India.'<br />Body: 'While many secularists (or people who call themselves \'liberal\', I guess) in India claim freedom of speech in dying, I completely disagree. \n\nAside from the fact that they\'re saying this out of concern for their own selfish political motives - knowing fully well they no longer control the media like they used to - they also like to affiliate themselves with a greater cause, referring to western laws and governance as a perfect example of complete tolerance and freedom of speech.\n\nThe problem is, western countries have NO freedom of speech whatsoever. India has total and complete freedom of speech. Let me explain why:\n\n- in India, I can say just about anything against any class of people. I can literally call for ethnic cleansing of Brahmins and still win votes. The elite class of Indians are Brahmins, and they\'re often the most persecuted and slandered - in fact, our secularist media led by barkha dutt and co, has even whitewashed crimes against Brahmins. Forget about Kashmiri Pandits ---. Laloo yadav and mayawati ran entire political campaigns based on anti Brahmin sentiments - calling for riots and killings of Brahmins. They enjoyed decades of political power, and still do. Nobody said anything. Foreign countries, Christians and Muslim organizations, are happy to fund them. In fact, slander of Brahmins is often ENCOURAGED, while similar rhetoric against Muslims and Christians is suppressed. It just goes to show who was actually running this country for so many years - the congress party - an elite class of fake Brahmins, masquerading as Christians, bought off by foreign interests. \n\nThis situation can ONLY be possible as a result of total freedom of speech. Western countries and Islamic nations want to exterminate Brahmins from India. It\'s the only way they\'ll ever control the country\'s population. \n\n- in the western world, there\'s a lot of shit flinging of "racism", "sexism", "misogyny", LGBTQRSTUVW, "transphobia" and all this nonsense, plenty of rallies, plenty of chaos which Leads gullible Indian "liberals" to believe that there\'s freedom of speech. But all these social issues are nothing but distractions. They don\'t hold the elites to account. These issues never threaten the authority of the elites. And who are the elites? The Jews. \n\nHave you EVER seen a western politician - or even a common citizen - criticising Jews or Israel and getting away with it? Have you EVER seen a western equivalent of lalooo yadav\'s "bhura Baal Saaf karo" slogan, which led to him ruling Bihar for a decade? Have you EVER seen western media - NEw York times, BBC, CNN - promoting views or figures critical of Israel or the Jewish lobby, Jewish community or Jewish politicians in their country? Has anyone EVER in the western world, been able to avoid consequences for saying something critical of Israel or Jewish poeple? The answer is NO. That\'s because there IS NO FREEDOM of speech, or FREEDOM FROM CONSEQUENCE for people critical of elites. You\'re immediately labeled anti Semitic and fired, smeared and destroyed in the public domain. Recent examples:\n\n1. American Muslim senator Ilhan Omar being forced to retract and delete comments critical of Americas Jewish lobby. She\'s labeled anti Semitic and silenced by the Democratic Party. \n2. CNN anchor Michael Lamont hill was fired for criticising Israeli treatment of Palestinians. \n3. British labor party candidate Jeremy Corbin - an anti war candidate arguing against British arms exports and war mongering on behalf of Israel  - has been labeled anti Semite, and is being destroyed in the court of public opinion. \n4. The two "minority" demographics most critical of Israel - Muslims and practicing Christians - are effectively demonized and banned from participating in public discourse. They\'re all labeled as "terrorists" by the western elites. Countries like Iran and Russia  - critical of Jewish led western foreign policy - are deliberately isolated from the entire world. \n5. Since world war 2, not a single politician - on EITHER side of the political spectrum - in England, or America, has ever said anything remotely critical of Israel or the influential elites in the Jewish lobby. You won\'t find a single one. \n\nIf the western world had actual freedom of speech, you could freely criticize western war mongering and killing of innocents on behalf of Israel , Israeli involvement in American and British politics as relating to sovereignty, and the state of Israel itself. You can\'t. And until this changes, I can never accept the idea that India has less freedom of speech than the west. \n\nProve me wrong. \n\n'<br />Author: 'twatavious'  id: 'aww4bi'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/aww4bi/prove_me_wrong_the_western_world_has_less_freedom/</li>

This requires that the subredditors here to be better informed about India related issues. As last few days have made it clear, media - print/news/twitter etc. is mostly filth spread by journalists and other such otherwise-would-be-unemployed individuals. The question is not whether journalists are biased or fair. They question is are they well informed/intelligent? \n\nIf you want to get even a  cursory 'understanding' of a very complex issue you have to invest some time investigating it. There are individuals who have dedicated their entire lives to studying these issues. This certainly does not mean they are unbaised. But these individuals do bring loads of facts and very interesting hypotheses, conjectures, theories to the table. These experts at think-tanks often have long form discussions. These videos are usually uploaded on the YouTube channels of respective think tanks and journals. For example, have a look at experts discussing various issues that are relevant for Indians (links below). The depth of knowledge is unmatched to whatever you will get on print/facebook/youtube snippets/new. There is often a question and answer session at the end which encourages counterarguments and further understanding of the issue at hand. These experts often appear on news channels and do make tweets on Twitter, but it is impossible to comment on a complex issue with a 140 character/ 4 minute answer limit.

I\'d say most \'english\' language media in India follows whatever the BBC writes. \n\nIts strange, because you\'d think the British government\'s mouthpiece wouldn\'t be a reliable source for anything related to India. It really isn\'t, but our secularists think it is.\n\nBut what do British people think about the BBC?

      <li>Title::: 'How Nehru &amp; His Cronies Ignored Actual Reports Of Chinese Aggression'<br />Body: 'One of the biggest failures of the Narendra Modi government has been to ignore the post-Independence history. To give an example, the South Block still does not declassify historical documents and transfer them to the National Archives of India, as legally mandated.\n\nAnother disappointment is that the VK Krishna Menon Papers, held at the Nehru Memorial Museum &amp; Library, are still kept under wraps and not accessible to researchers and scholars. Menon humiliated competent military officers, in some cases with the backing of the then Prime Minister. Why should this be kept secret?\n\n📷**VK Krishna Menon\xa0humiliated competent military officers. Why is this a secret? (WikiMedia)**\n\n**Keeping the secret**\n\nFurther, without rewriting history, it is important to learn from past successes, victories, as well as defeats.\n\nIn fact, there is certainly more to learn from blunders, than successes.\n\nThe case of Lt Gen SPP Thorat’s report about the “Chinese Threat” on India’s borders is worth citing. On October 8, 1959, Thorat, then responsible for Eastern Command, sent a paper on the defence of NEFA to the Army chief, who forwarded it to the minister.\n\nThorat’s findings were outright rejected by Menon and, worse, Thorat was accused of being an “alarmist and a warmonger”.\n\n📷**Chinese threat: Thorat alerted about the threat in 1959. But he was accused of being an "alarmist" (India Today archive)**\n\nThe report began thus: “Previously, the only real threat against India which merited consideration was from Pakistan. To this now has been added the threat from China… This is primarily due to the claim made by China upon large territories which are clearly ours… (China) has also refused to recognise the McMahon Line as the international boundary and has made deliberate incursions into our territory in Ladakh, Uttar Pradesh and NEFA (North- East Frontier Agency).”\n\nSoon after Menon took over the defence ministry, Thorat, like General KS Thimayya, the Army chief, had fallen out of Menon’s favours.\n\nMajor Gen VK Singh, who wrote one of the Army Commander’s biographies, noted that Thorat “clearly brought out that with the troops, weapons and equipment available at that time, a Chinese attack could not be contained or defeated, and the ‘forward policy’, being advocated by Menon, was not practicable.”\n\nThorat also provided a time table showing “how the defences would fall day by day in case the Chinese attacked.”\n\nHe advocated the use of the Air Force to counter China.\n\n📷**It is said that after the war Nehru realised how right Thorat had been in his assessments (India Today archive)**\n\nSingh further noted: “When Thimayya retired in May 1961, it was expected that Thorat would succeed him as the Army chief. He was highly decorated, had combat experience, and was held in high regard in the service. Most important, he was GOC-in-C Eastern Command, and was familiar with the situation on the borders with China.”\n\nUnfortunately for India, Gen PN Thapar got the top job; though technically senior, he had little field experience but was pliable and close to the minister. An exchange between Gen Thapar and Lt Gen Thorat shows the pettiness of the then leaders; it occurred at a time Thorat was in the process of retiring.\n\nAt 8am on June 24, 1961, Lt Gen Thorat received a letter from the Army chief who had been “asked” by the Prime Minister for his comments “on the following allegations against you (Thorat) which have come to his notice.” By the evening Thorat had answered all the points.\n\n📷**Thorat had said officers must only be loyal to their superior commanders (India Today archive)**\n\n**China war**\n\nThe first allegation was about a speech given by Thorat in Ranikhet where the Army commander would have said: “Indian officers were seeking promotions through political influence which was disrupting our Army, or words to that effect.”\n\nThorat replied that he had only said that “officers must give their loyalty to their superior commanders and through them, to the COAS (Army chief) whoever he may be. Any tendency to look in other directions for early advancement was likely to ruin the discipline of the Army.”\n\nThe habit of finding other ways of “advancement” had already sneaked into the Army, mainly due to Menon’s ways of working.\n\nThe second allegation was that Thorat would have told a senior IAF officer that he was “allergic to the defence minister whom (he) could not stand and who was disrupting the Army.”\n\nThere is no doubt that many in the Army thought that way.\n\nHad Thorat said it openly? Thorat answered to the chief: “I recollect that some IAF officer possibly at Jorhrat or Tezpur asked why I had not been appointed COAS. To the best of my memory, I remember having replied that you were senior to me and also that the hon’ble defence minister and I were not very fond of each other.” He admitted that it was not proper to make such a statement.\n\n📷**We must learn from the blunders committed by arrogant ministers in the past (India Today archive)**\n\n**Right prediction**\n\nThis exchange, however, shows the small-mindedness of those who asked these questions just before Thorat’s retirement. The next query was worse: “Your headquarters spent large sums of money on the farewell parties, functions and parades for General KS Thimayya in Lucknow during his visit earlier this month. How much money was spent, and how many vehicles were employed under the items mentioned above?”\n\nThe Army Commander listed “his” expenses during the farewell functions:\n\n(a) At Home: Apr 26 Nil\n\n(b) Guest Night: Apr 29, Nil\n\n(c) Parade: May 1, Rs 450.\n\nHe went on to provide the details for the Rs 450.\n\nThorat’s conclusions were: “Should (the PM) not be satisfied with my explanation, I request that I may be given an opportunity to clear myself in person, in the presence of those who have made these allegations.”\n\nThapar had nastily written to Thorat, “These are serious allegations and cannot be ignored.”\n\nIt is said that after the war Nehru realised how right Thorat had been in his assessments and predictions. It was too late. One can only hope that the VK Krishna Menon Papers will soon be available to the Indian public; then we may realise all the blunders committed by the arrogant minister, and learn from them.\n\n(Courtesy of *Mail Today*)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom : [https://www.dailyo.in/politics/why-centre-must-declassify-vk-krishna-menon-papers-on-1962-india-china-war-spp-thorat-clash-between-army-and-defence-ministry/story/1/25291.html](https://www.dailyo.in/politics/why-centre-must-declassify-vk-krishna-menon-papers-on-1962-india-china-war-spp-thorat-clash-between-army-and-defence-ministry/story/1/25291.html)'<br />Author: 'JainMutton'  id: 'awrb2r'<br />Score:53<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/awrb2r/how_nehru_his_cronies_ignored_actual_reports_of/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'My view on Indian muslims as an ex-muslim'<br />Body: "I've always felt that I was right wing ever since I became an atheist 5 years ago. I agreed with most of the people here that there needs to be a serious talk about the muslim community, and instead of appeasement politics there needs to be real reform coming from within the community itself to fix our issues ranging from extremism to illiteracy. \n\n  \nHowever, when I came to the right wing a lot of what I've seen is that there seems to be very little nuance here as to what the solution of our problems is as a nation. Just recently when Nas. shah made some comments, people started spouting out the most vicious vitriol towards him. People regularly call Javed Akhtar a pakistani here, and any comments from such agnostic muslims is always met with this word in bold: **TAQIYYA**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrowing up in a fairly moderate muslim family, I can honestly say I've never heard of this phrase in my life. When I asked my parents, they didn't know about it either. I had to google to find out what it actually meant. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here's some clarification which I feel the saner voices of this group might be able to appreciate. Most Indian muslims I've known in my life have been the most liberal and non practicing out of all other muslim nationalities. Most Indian muslims get offended if you call them pakistanis because it's actually offensive considering we actually like the fact that we're Indians and not pakis. Most Indian muslims practice their own version of Islam, and most of them have cognitive dissonance in that area.  But most people in the right wing keep criticizing muslims with such intense and deep rooted anger that I feel like even though I agree with most policies of the right wing, I could never belong here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are people who bash muslim superstitions with such intensity, but completely shut down when you question their superstitious beliefs. I don't know if it's willful ignorance or they've just been misinformed about how muslims think. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOfcourse I can't speak accurately as to how Indian muslims feel because I haven't been one for a while, and this is just anecdotal. But as someone who's probably been more victimized by his religion at birth than most people in the right wing, I can clarify any genuine questions you might have and open some dialogue.  I'll try not to be biased in any way, although rooting out bias 100% is impossible for any human being.

It broke the mental self imposed barrier in regards to punishing Pakistan for it's support of terrorism and misadventure. Not only that we were also able to call the bluff on the 'nuclear - deterrence ' doctrine of Pakistan.\n2. We achieved major diplomatic victories during this confrontation , most of the countries either supported us or stayed neutral. This basically understates the hard work done by the current government.\n3. We also changed the paradigm of dealing with tough situations when we flat out refused to attach any condition to freeing of our Wing Commander.\n\n   **Learning:**\n\n1. Psy-ops is one major area where we completely lagged behind which then also translated to. people proclaiming that we lost PR war. However the badly edited video statement aka propaganda video released by Pakistan backfired and weakened their Psy-ops to a good extent. \n2. The #saynotowar and #thankyouimraan crowd consist of gullible crowd who are emotional and it also consist of few vested interest who tried to take a political capital out of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow as far as de-escalations goes , I think Indian government made it clear that India does not desires any further escalations. So I think situation will remain same as of now but it will be within a paradigm of controlled war where any misadventure will have a cost attached to it.

Pakistan is not a terror funding/supporting state. It is a victim of terrorism, so why would it fund/support it?\n\nNo nation in this world would publicly acknowledge they support terrorism in any way. No government institution for sure. How does Pakistan grossly navigate though that?\n\n* **"We do not support terrorism or kashmir. We morally support Kashmir\'s self-determination &amp; Referendum"**\n\n&gt; = (Because we know, if Kashmir votes, it will vote independence or Pakistan, both allow maximum Pakistani influence in the region).  \n\n* **"We \'officially\' don\'t know where globally designated terrorists are, but we know people who know their whereabouts or are in contact with them"**. \n&gt;= (This means, for the public, govt does not know where they are hiding, even if they are in and protected by Pakistan).\n \n* **"If India or anyone has proof of XYZ being a terrorist, please provide us with evidence. We also have courts and we have to prove to our people, if we are calling and sentencing someone as a terrorist"** \n&gt;= (We will hide behind the facade of \'rule of law\' when it suits us, and bother about the opinions of the Pakistani people, when it suits us. It is in our best interests to preserve the lives and influence of those who can threaten or harm any other country in the world - as it gives us extra territorial power, without the need of weapons or money.)\n \n* If provided any amount of proof or evidence, **"The proof that xyz country has provided is not a strong case and is just wild speculation, which will not hold in Pakistani court. Due to this, no action can be taken. This is the law, there is no need to get aggressive or frustrated with us."** \n&gt;= (The only mystery is if we ever opened your dossier. The result and our court\'s decision was already drafted even before you presented evidence. At best, we\'ll use the evidence to improve our ways)\n\n * If there is militancy in countries that Pakistan considers adversary, **"Pakistan speaks against the human rights violations by XYZ govt and their people have the right to self determination by any way possible. They have Pakistan\'s moral support"**. \n\n&gt;= (Pakistan supports violent and political instability in neighborhood as we seems to have a better influence in disorderly regions).\n\n\n * If there is militancy within Pakistan, **"We do not support terrorism in any shape or form.** \n\n&gt;= (If it is within, there will be no press freedom, we will crush them with ruthless force and continue to subjugate them like savages, but our other nations should be humane to people whom we give moral support to).\n\n * **"Pakistan\'s moral support to Kashmir, which is an unresolved part of partition, is not support of terrorism. But their right to self determination."** \n\n&gt; = (Good Terrorists)\n\n * **"Indian or any other country\'s even verbal lip service to militants in Pakistani borders means the country is a state-sponsor of terrorism within Pakistan"**  \n\n&gt; = (Bad terrorist, if you reciprocate our behavior, you\'re the worst) \n\n\n#2.) On Kashmir\n * **"India must vacate Kashmir, UN must hold referendum - according to UN"** \n\n&gt;= (We will conveniently ignore that the UN actually said Pakistan must completely vacate Kashmir, and then India have minimal military presence for Kashmir Plebiscite, as we don\'t trust India and we cant influence the result then.)\n \n* **"Kashmiri Jihad and fight for muslim rights is legitimate and true"** \n\n&gt;= (Self explanatory, because according to Pak, Islamic people are always right)\n * **"Indian Kashmiri Pandits are insignificant vote bank anyway,  as they are only 5%. It doesn\'t matter if they stayed or left kashmir."** = (Why send your 5 people to vote when majority of 95 will vote for us).  \n\n* **"Agents using any way or form to gain self-determination will not receive condemnation from Pakistan. Any act of protecting Indian Constitution or trying to preserve rule of law will be condemned strongly."** \n\n&gt; = (By this, every act of self preservation by the Indian army in Kashmir will push the foolish Kashmiri into believing India is true evil (Face value), and since Pakistan is \'supporting us\' and \'not hurting us\' - they are our friends. The perfect plot with an confused opponent. Pakistan encourages militants \'morally\', they bomb in kashmir. Indian Army does what needs to be done to prevent bombings, disturbs Kashmiri freedom, Kashmiris hate India for doing this, so they want independence.)\n\n * **"Situation in POK/Azad Kashmir and Giglit Baltistan is good. They are all happy to be independent / protected by Pakistan"** \n\n&gt; = (Reality can be anything since there is no Independent media here. Even the people here are aware of this, and have given up fight for rights. They are made to focus on Indian kashmir first, everything else later.)\n\n* **"Ensure freedom of speech to separatists."**\n\n&gt; = (They are our bitches on our payroll. While they think they will lead independent kashmir, they will do our bidding, so give them the power of voice.)\n\n#3) International influence\n\n* **"We are the small, poor, terror ravaged country. India is the aggressor"**; \n* **"Pakistan wants Peace, India does not."**; \n* **"We want talks, India does not. It keeps saying talks and terror cant go hand-in-hand as an excuse trying to blame us for their own militancy problems. but cant provide a shred of evidence to back that claim"**\n\n&gt; = (The west is filled with fucking retards who will never ever understand the east. Everything is binary for them. They are easy to influence if we play the right cards.\n\n* **"We hope russia, US, UK, China intervenes and helps broker peace with India"**\n\n&gt; = (Best way to control narrative is to appear as the peace monger to the west, and bring in as many players as possible to make the waters muddy. Everyone wants influence against India, and by inviting them to talks to make decisions for India - we are gifting influence to these countries.)\n\n* **"We hope the Kashmir problem is resolved peacefully and we seek anyone\'s help in it."**\n\n&gt; = (Fuck no.

Get India to pursue this case strongly. Get Indian media to report it. Then International media will copy paste and make a big deal out of it citing Indian media as the source.

He is alive as you can see for yourself". This will conclusively prove that Shahaz being dead in F-16 crash is false, and India will look bad, thus losing the credibility of the claim about the shot down F-16.\n\nIf I was in Pakistani cyber warfare team and I am forced to make it seem like that crash did not happen, then this would be what I would do.

Even if it was allowed, can we not even sanitize the route properly, can we not even use our military satellites and drones to see in real time what is happening and target suspicious vehicle activity.\n\n\\- Why was the MIG 21  used for the attack and defense operations given the known vulnerabilities of this aircraft in such a critical situation, they crash like crazy even in training, they are not suitable either for defense or attack scenarios especially when we know the enemy has F18.\n\n\\- Indian people are so fucking bad at propaganda and mental warfare, they downed one of our planes and capture one of our pilots, we started getting so emotional. Pakistan clearly had leverage over us at this point, not because they captured our pilot but because we allowed them to take over our minds and our emotions. That torture video, the parading of our brave pilot was clearly aimed at propaganda, they clearly won the psychological warfare then and there. \n\n\\- You don't go on a war with a suicidal terrorist state like Pakistan with such weak mental preparedness, Pakistan doesn't care how many of its citizens die, so we should have prepared ourselves for casualties on our side too. We are exposed now, every country in the world now knows how easy it is to psychologically manipulate us. \n\n\\- About this shameless impotent government, when it's time to take credit for a situation there is no defense personnel to be seen in any press conferences, but when there is a not so favorable situation, they throw our military leaders under the bus and shove the mics on their faces so they don't have to answer questions. \n\n\\- Now, I am neither a peacenik nor a warmonger, but we clearly have these terrorist fundamentalist states around our borders circling like vultures ready to pounce and grab their share of the bounty. We simply cannot afford to show a weak face or that we are vulnerable in our military and most importantly psychological defenses. \n\n\\- One more important thing, nobody is our friend in this war, nor America, nor China, nor Israel, nor Russia, we are on our own, on the surface, it may seem that they are our friend or helping us, but their geopolitical and business interest will always be a priority before us. All the tech like Planes and missiles used by Pakistan were either provided by China or USA, it is also time to ask whether this so-called friendship with the USA is real when they continue to weaponize Pakistan knowingly that those weapons will be used against us."<br />Author: 'antarikhsha'  id: 'avzya6'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/avzya6/questions_to_be_asked/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Some lingering thoughts on current situation'<br />Body: "I could have shared this on main thread itself but I really wanted it to come across as a post rather than comment\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. First of all , I am appalled by the majority of Indian media for their coverage of this incident, no journalistic integrity and professionalism. I don't agree with Ravish Kumar on lot of things but I do agree with him that most of the media houses were not reporting but having a 'tamasha' for TRP's.\n2.  Secondly, I am also  saddened by my few fellow countrymen who have more faith in the ISPR tweets than our armed forces and government.I mean ISPR tweets and their narratives changed multiple times, like their claim of arresting three pilots which then changed to two and then finally to one.They also lied about not using F-16's for incursion. On the other hand IAF from beginning emphasised that only of their pilot was MIA. Lest not we forget it is the same ISPR which is part of Pakistani establishment which peddles lies regarding the outcomes of last 4 wars.\n3. Third, I am worried the way in which some section of our country started suing for peace when the news of one IAF pilot being arrested broke out. In war logic , strategy and tactics are primary factors not emotions.On one hand we read story of how our captured pilot showed bravery and logic in face of adversity and other hand we have soft bellied personalities who started PEACE!! PEACE!! on first sign of adversity.\n4. Lastly I would like to address the fellow Indian citizen who have constantly accused government of a) staging air strikes for political benefit, b) asking for proof of strikes, c) putting Imran Khan on pedestal and d) even questioning that why airstrikes.Is your dislike/hatred of BJP/Modi so high that you forgot that this airstrike was to prevent another incident like Pulwama, that this was about sending message to the Pakistani establishment that stop harbouring terrorists. For point b), I read somewhere that we are in democracy and we have right to ask questions and I completely agree but would you rather not want to ask questions when the dust has settled , when the time is right and country is back to normal.And last not the least pedestaling Imran Khan, just because he seemed gracious and talked peace doesn't means that we will put him on pedestal. Him releasing our pilot is not simply his goodwill gesture but  the pressure exerted by our government and other world leaders. You may like him personally but don't forget at the end of the day he is the head of our adversary state.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"<br />Author: 'that_nameis_taken'  id: 'avzt57'<br />Score:92<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/avzt57/some_lingering_thoughts_on_current_situation/</li>

Interestingly, the name struck a chord and I decided to look into it further. Also the fact that there seems to be a rough path leading to the facility that could easily be navigated on foot from the Masjid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the top results that popped out to me was this Telegraph article profiling the Birmingham Islamic terrorist cell that was busted before it could carry out a massive suicide bombing attack: [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/9868154/Birmingham-plot-The-facilitators-and-foot-soldiers.html](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/9868154/Birmingham-plot-The-facilitators-and-foot-soldiers.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few red flags instantly came up such as one of the terrorists, Rarin Ahmed, being heavily influenced by JeM head Maulana Masood Azhar.\n\n" In one recording Ahmed claimed he had been “on this path since I was eight years old” and talked about his older brother bringing home a book about **Maulana Masood Azhar**, leader of the terrorist group Harakat ul-Mujahideen, that had been given to him outside Heartlands High School. \n\nAnother major one was the revelation that all of the terror cell members attended a curious little place called the **Masjid Abdullah bin Masood.** \n\n"All lived in neighbouring streets in an area of Victorian terraced housing off the Stratford Road where Asian shops line both sides of the road for more than a mile.\n\nThey attended the **Masjid Abdullah bin Masood** on Evelyn Road, Sparkhill, and went to a gym called Darul Ihsaan \\[Place of Excellence\\] or “Jimmy’s gym.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt gets a little more interesting here too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n"The same group had apparently been to Saudi Arabia on umrah \\[a minor pilgrimage\\] a year earlier.\n\n**They told their parents they would be travelling to Islamabad in Pakistan to go on a pilgrimage with a group called Tablighi Jamaat and stay in a mosque for the last ten days of Ramadan in a retreat known as for itakaf.**\n\n**Instead they allegedly travelled into the mountains where they sought training in terrorism before one of them apparently rang home**."\n\nTablighi Jamaat is another radical Sunni Islam outfit known for breeding notorious terror startups like HuJi, which Azhar ratted out to the Indian authorities while he was in our custody because of his close affiliations to it. ([https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/jaish-chief-maulana-masood-azhar-a-blue-eyed-boy-of-isi/articleshow/68172707.cms](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/jaish-chief-maulana-masood-azhar-a-blue-eyed-boy-of-isi/articleshow/68172707.cms))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComing back to the point, I think it\'s highly likely Masjid Abdullah bin Masood is another Islamic radicalization front with affiliations to the JeM. And the fact that it is the next door neighbour of that creepy isolated facility in question, it only further consolidates that Balakot KPK is indeed used as a terrorist training ground and Pakistan has a lot to cover up.'<br />Author: 'waronterror11'  id: 'avvkp4'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/avvkp4/digging_deeper_into_the_balakot_kpk_airstrike/</li>

Whether it be Kargil, Parliament Attacks, Mumbai Train Attacks, 26/11, after every attack, I recall seeing people who are feeling dejected. \n\nI remember watching in absolute horror and then despondence the attacks on the Taj on 26/11. I recall a sense of sadness and awe after learning that my fathers lawyer is no more, killed by terrorists. It feels like a twisted joke, stepping out for dinner and getting shot by terrorists. Even more sick is that ordinary people on the evening commute back home getting shot by Kasab &amp; friends.\n\nAnd if you want more comedy around how to not handle a crises, read this [interview](https://thewire.in/security/26-11-mumbai-terror-attacks) of the former NSG Chief. \n\nOr try **not to** give permission to a 2 bit Movie director to "[tour](https://www.indiatoday.in/latest-headlines/story/controversy-on-cm-taking-son-on-taj-visit-34307-2008-12-01)" the ruins of the Taj Hotel to save your "actor sons" fledging career.\n\nI recall reading a **lot** of Pakistani media and books on Pakistan and then coming across [this piece](https://www.dawn.com/news/672000), where any Hindu and India is an enemy of Islam and Pakistan.\n\nFor those who feel that we can make up with the Pakistanis perhaps need to read Bhutto &amp; Zias proclamation of "Death By A Thousand Cuts" doctrine.\n\nAnger is a useful emotion. It tells us emotionally when a boundary is violated and as a nation, accept that anger. Gandhi quotes and thoughts like "Be the bigger Country" sound good in Op-Eds. \n\nSadly Op-Eds do do not deter fanatics from across the border.

Sq. 19 also known as Sherdills or Warhawks\n\nNow According to this site http://www.f-16.net/units_article455.html Sq. 19 only has F-16 A/B Block 15. \n\nBlock 15 F-16 is equipped with PW100 Engines which the Pakis were claiming\n\nSo are they right? \n\nWell NO.\n\nWhen you go this chinese defence site https://lt.cjdby.net/thread-2241258-1-1.html, it gives you details on Squadron 19 which accurately matches with the information available here http://www.f-16.net/units_article455.html that there are 13 F-16s however with a minute change. \n\n&gt;19th Squadron (Sherdills): equipped with 9 F-16A ADFs and 4 F-16B ADFs.

      <li>Title::: "India's Future"<br />Body: "Frequent lurker here, but posting for the first time, I just want to say that I am frustrated with what is going on in India not just regarding recent events in Pulwama but general direction India as a society has taken. Right now all I can say is that India is in organized chaos. Various factors contribute to this state like our history, colonialism, corruption, overpopulation, casteism, limited resources, brain drain, and general lackadaisical attitude of everyday Indian. This has led to a situation in which every other country tries to exploit us in the manner they can e.g. Russia and America selling us weapons, America, China, and Pakistan constantly meddling in our internal affairs and needling us by creating a divide between various groups on the basis of religion, gender or caste. Most people can't even see beyond Pakistan and China, they cannot even fathom that Pakistan is just a pawn in the bigger picture of geopolitics.  People who are woke or idealist are generally taken advantage by special interest groups. India is not some small country or city-state, it is a completely different civilization of more than 1 Billion people, whose way of life is unlike any other. The thing that I fear the most is technology and its use by TPTB to subvert us, and Indian state, intelligentsia, the military has completely failed us in this regard. We have failed as a state to produce critical technologies and are ages behind in most of the fields like Military tech, Software Tech, Hardware Tech, Medical Tech, Space Tech, Hard Sciences, etc etc. We have become guinea pigs for the powers like China and America, they test Vaccines and medicines on us, they are getting the biggest data bank of the world for free(Aadhar, Google, Facebook, WhatsApp) and we so casually allow them to steal it as if it's their right. We are living in the age of neo-colonialism in which the power doesn't have to directly live among us to control us or subjugate us. Recently after the attack at Pulwama, the so-called nationalists started doxxing  people all over the place for siding with Pakistan or sympathizing with terrorists and look I get it, passions are high right now, but for me, freedom of speech is of paramount importance in this age of information, and it should be for you too. What will you achieve by doxxing them, will they stop hating Indian army or Indian state? No they won't, they will hate us even more and it will be hidden now. Before it was public, everybody could see their hatred. I think most of the Indian right wing is reactionary, has no intellectual depth and have their heads up their asses and I sadly used to be part of that tribe. Most of the digital platforms are owned and operated by either a western or Chinese company, they can easily manipulate the discourse at the behest of their state and they probably are. I am sad to say that we have completely pawned our digital, technological sovereignty for some free use of their apps. I cannot find any sane discussion anywhere with critical thinking, everywhere it is chest thumping, memes, or India bashing. Having said all of this, I have a proposal, we should create a safe space for constructive discussion about India's past, present and future, it could be a new sub or any other website but it should be about serious discussion, no shitposting, no hate and easily accessible. We can create a thread every weak about a new topic, diagnose the problem and discuss it.

Pakistan must take urgent and meaningful action against terrorist groups in its territory, including Jaish-e-Mohammed which has claimed responsibility for the 14 February bombing, and Lashkar-e-Taiba. Pakistan must do everything possible to implement its own proscription of Jaish-e-Mohammed. It can no longer allow extremist groups the legal and physical space to operate from its territory. These steps would make a substantial contribution to easing tensions and resolving the underlying causes of conflict. Australia urges both sides to exercise restraint, avoid any action which would endanger peace and security in the region and engage in dialogue to ensure that these issues are resolved peacefully.

France recognizes India’s legitimacy in ensuring its security against cross-border terrorism and calls on Pakistan to put an end to the activities of the terrorist groups established in its territory. France, which stands alongside India in the fight against terrorism in all its forms, is fully committed to mobilizing the international community to punish the terrorists responsible for this attack and to block their channels of financing.

This was in response to the Pakistani attack on an Indian observation post.\n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/news/national/locked-in-un-files-15-years-of-bloodletting-at-loc/article4358199.ece\n\n28th July 2011:\n\n5 Pakistani soldiers were killed when Indian Army carried out a hushed up raid.

Was the attack information available so freely that even a lowly BJP leader was privy to what was going on?\n\n2. Are the BJP leaders trying to milk these opportunities to create a public sentiment in their favor which will ultimately result in electoral gains for them?\n\nIn either case, it is pretty clear that the credit which has always belonged to the Indian Army has been turned into a chest-thumping opportunity by Modi and his band of patriotic Bhakts.\n\nMeanwhile, it is equally important to address the situation which has led to these counter strikes, which clearly indicates the failure of the Government as far as the internal security and intelligence gathering is concerned.\n\nAnd to those people who are thinking that this was the first ever airstrike India has made against Pakistan, do remember that India did not win the previous wars against Pakistan by throwing stones at them across the border.\n\nDisclaimer: The credit for all military strikes against enemies from 1947 till date goes to Modi. The responsibility of all Terror strikes on Indian soil during the same period is to be blamed on Nehru.\n\nSource: An FB post.'<br />Author: 'smartdog99'  id: 'auz3l6'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/auz3l6/well_done_indian_armed_forces_p/</li>

Initially the reports can be very brief and innacurate. According to current sources, 12 Mirage 2000s carried out the operation and dropped 1000kg Laser Guided Bombs on terrorist camps in Balakot. Balakot is in Pakistan not POK (near Muzaffarabad).\n\nNow Pakistan Air Force reported to media that their Air Force had scrambled jets to counteract with Indian Air Force and because of that IAF dropped targets in haste and went back. The answer to this is, it's a fabricated claim. This is why:\n\nIAF jets took off from Awantipora Air Forces Station and Srinagar Air Force Station according to reports. They entered from Muzzafarabad area. Now the distance from where the LOC begins to Balakot is around 72 kilometers.\n\nThis is the point where the radars alert PAF in Islamabad. They scramble their jets.\n\nScrambling F-16s when on high alert takes a minimum of 4-5 minutes due to warming up of engine and taking off of runway. \n\nTill the time the F-16s take off, the Indian Air Force jets would have already dropped the bombs on Balakot Camps as it's only 72 kilometers from LOC. Considering the jets flew at around 1200km/h because they are flying low, it would take around 3 minutes and 36 seconds to drop the bombs on Balakot. \n\nNow Islamabad Air Force Base is approximately 100 kilometres away from Balakot. Considering that it would take F-16s easily 4-5 minutes (considering they were flying at around 1600km/h which is max possible at low altitudes and initially the speed would also be very low, so 1600km/h on average is still very very high) to reach Balakot, Indian Air Force would've already have crosses the LOC and returned into Indian Air Space meaning that the claims of Pakistan Air Force authorities saying that IAF dropped bombs in haste because PAF jets almost intercepted them is pure bullshit. They just want to save their ass by saying so. \n\n\n"<br />Author: 'jatishtyagi'  id: 'auv6uw'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/auv6uw/calculations_iafs_strikes_on_terror_camps_in/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Afghanistan complains to the UN, the fate of ISIS brides, and the story of Golda Meir'<br />Body: 'Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Biweekly Geopolitics Thread, your place to discuss all the latest events from around the world on r/IndiaSpeaks. Discussions can be about any event from anywhere in the world - be it sports, fashion, or of course, politics. Topics do not have to be related to India. Here are some of the top stories to get the discussion started:\n\n# Top 3 stories from India\'s neighbourhood:\n\n[1. Attempted plane hijack in Bangladesh](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47350138)\n\nA Bangladeshi national, about age 25, allegedly attempted to hijack flight BG147 from Dhaka to Dubai, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing in Chittagong. Security forces stormed the plane and killed the man, who was found to have a pistol, according to official reports. All other passengers successfully disembarked the plane. The exact reason for the attempted hijack is unclear, but Reuters reported that the man was mentally unstable and wanted to talk to PM Hasina, who was visiting Chittagong.\n\n[2. Afghanistan complains to UN about Pakistan](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/afghanistan-protests-to-un-on-pakistans-role-in-taliban-peace-talks/articleshow/68039197.cms)\n\nThe Afghan government shot off a strongly-worded letter to the UNSC about Pakistan\'s role in the ongoing peace dialogue with the Taliban, objecting to being cut off from the process entirely. The government claimed that Pakistan\'s role in the dialogue was a violation of the country\'s sovereignty and the need for an Afghan-led peace process. Matters came to a head when news circulated about representatives of the Taliban meeting Pakistani PM Imran Khan (often called \'Taliban Khan\' for his soft corner for the group), a clear violation of UNSC sanctions that forbid members of the group from traveling.\n\n3. [Saudi sisters stranded in Hong Kong](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-saudi-sisters/i-was-like-a-prisoner-saudi-sisters-trapped-in-hong-kong-recall-beatings-idUSKCN1QC0DH)\n\nTwo Saudi sisters have been left stranded in Hong Kong after authorities revoked their passports. The girls have alleged that their life under Saudi Arabia\'s strict custodianship laws (which forbid any woman from so much as going outdoors without a male relative) was akin to being born into a prison. They saved money over years and, when the family was holidaying in Sri Lanka, attempted to flee to Australia to seek asylum. They were caught in transit in Hong Kong when Saudi authorities revoked their passports, and have been stuck in the city-state for six months. Once their period of visa-free stay ends, they may be deported back home, where they allege their lives are in danger from their brothers and father. The girls have also announced their renunciation of Islam, which is punishable by death in the kingdom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Top 3 stories from around the world:\n\n1. [King Jong-Un boards train for Hanoi to meet Trump](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/2187441/trump-kim-summit-2019-kim-jong-un-crosses-yalu-river-china-his)\n\nIn a style characteristic of his late grandfather and founder of North Korea Kim Il-Sung, Chairman Kim Jong-Un boarded a train to reach the Vietnamese city of Hanoi for his second summit with US President Donald Trump. The journey could take up to 60 hours, with China locking down cities along the way to ensure their ally\'s security, as the custom-made train with bedrooms and conference rooms winds through the Chinese heartland. Reuters reports that he will stop at the Vietnamese border and drive the rest of the way to Hanoi, where authorities have planned a grand welcome in the fellow Communist nation. At the summit, the two leaders are expected to take stock of efforts to denuclearize North Korea, a move for which Trump has regularly claimed the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n2. [Nigeria holds election amidst reports of violence](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-25/dozens-killed-in-election-violence-as-nigeria-votes/10844842)\n\nAfter having to delay the vote for a week citing logistical issues, Nigeria, Africa\'s most populous country, finally held a national election to elect a new president. Although 70 candidates are on the ballot, the two leading candidates are incumbent Muhummadu Buhari, the 76 year-old former military dictator of the country, and businessman Atiku Abubakar (72). Observer groups have reported 39 deaths related to the election in the country of nearly 200 million people. Interestingly, the incumbent President Buhari spent five months undergoing unspecified treatment in Britain, during which time news circulated that he had died and was replaced by a Sudanese body double. Eventually, [he had to deny these rumours](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-03/nigerian-president-denies-dying-and-being-replaced-by-clone/10576886) of being cloned.\n\n3. [ISIS bride Hoda Muthana denied return to the US](https://www.al.com/news/2019/02/who-is-hoda-muthana-alabama-woman-who-joined-isis-wants-to-come-home-with-young-son.html)\n\nIn November 2014, Alabama, US resident Hoda Muthana abandoned her family to join the terrorist group ISIS in Syria, during which time she allegedly used social media to encourage others to \'spill American blood\'. Since then, she has been married thrice, with all her fellow jihadist-husbands having been killed in battle as the group is blown nearly out of existence. Now, living in a refugee/POW camp in Syria, she has expressed interest to return to the US and rejoin her family with her 18-month old son. US President Donald Trump categorically and publicly (on Twitter) denied her permission to return, although Muthana claims that she regrets her decision to leave. Her family is said to have filed a case against the US government to bring their daughter back. European countries are also facing a similar dilemma of returning ISIS fighters and brides, with the UK having stripped one of them, [Shamima Begum](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/20/uk/shamima-begum-uk-citizenship-stripped-gbr-intl/index.html), of citizenship, although London Mayor Sadiq Khan and opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn have condemned the move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: Golda Meir\n\n*A new segment bringing alive great events and people from history who changed the world*\n\nIt is an unfortunate fact that few women have led major countries in the world, and even fewer have been remembered. However, standing with the likes of Margaret Thatcher and Indira Gandhi as fellow \'iron women\' who showed strong leadership in their countries, is the fourth and only woman PM of Israel, Golda Meir. Born in Kiev in Imperial Russia, she immigrated to the United States in 1906, and in 1917, after marrying her husband Morris Meyerson, moved to British-mandate Palestine with strong Zionist zeal. She returned to the US some years later, but became embittered after President Roosevelt and most other leaders chose to turn their backs on European Jews being persecuted by the Nazis.\n\nIn 1946, she joined discussions with the US on the UN Partition Plan for the Palestinian Mandate and helped raise funds for what became the state of Israel in 1948. It is said that days before Israel was established, Meir traveled undercover to meet King Abdullah I of Jordan (then called Transjordan) to request him to stay neutral in the inevitable war on the new state. When the King asked her to not hurry in her quest for a Jewish homeland, she is said to have remarked, "We\'ve been waiting for 2,000 years. Is that hurrying?" She was later one of the 24 signatories to the Israeli Declaration of Independence, a historic moment for the Jewish people.\n\nIn 1969, she was elected Prime Minister of Israel after having served in several prominent cabinet-level positions, and retained that position till her resignation in 1975. In her term, she oversaw several crises: The Munich Olympics massacre, where Palestinian terrorists killed Israeli Olympians; the Austrian hostage crisis, in which Jews returning to Israel via Austria were kidnapped by Palestinian terrorists; and perhaps the most serious of them all, the Yom Kippur War of 1973, an invasion launched by a coalition led by Egypt and Syria to take back Israeli-occupied Sinai and Golan Heights. Under Meir, Israel emerged victorious at Yom Kippur, and entered into the Camp David Accords, which led to the first Arab country (Egypt) recognizing Israel, and eventually leading Egypt to exit the Soviet sphere of influence.\n\nGolda Meir was also PM during the 1971 India-Pakistan War that led to the creation of Bangladesh. Although the country condemned the genocide of Bengalis in East Pakistan, it did not supply any support to India in the form of money or weapons. At that time, India was in desperate need of mortar weapons to arm Mukti Bahini. Despite the fact that India did not have formal relations with Israel, Indira Gandhi\'s secretary and one of the architects of the 1971 war, PN Haksar, [used his secret networks](https://thewire.in/diplomacy/india-israel-bilateral-ties) to convince Israel to sell the arms to India, with the ultimate green light coming from Meir herself. She wrote a now-immortalized letter, hoping that Indira Gandhi would appreciate the help Israel was providing. Of course, it was only in 1992 under PM PVN Rao that India finally established diplomatic relations, and in 2017 under PM Modi that an Indian PM finally visited the homeland of the Jewish people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat stories from around the world caught your attention?

Right now Western countries suck up to Pakistan because the lives of their soldiers in Afghanistan depends on Pakistan not increasing its long-time support for the Afghan Taliban.\n\nDoes that mean India cannot punish Pakistan? No, there are still plenty of ways to punish Pakistan. India can and should do exactly what Pakistan is doing to India: Support and fund all separatist movements in Pakistan.

      <li>Title::: "To fight digital colonisation by Silicon Valley companies like Facebook, we have to take a different path. Here's the problem with allowing Facebook to take over our digital lives."<br />Body: 'Next to Aadhaar, Facebook may be the greatest modern threat against privacy. How do we fight back and keep Facebook from colonising India?\n\n&gt; "The business model of the internet is surveillance. We build systems that spy on people in exchange for services. [Corporations call it marketing.](https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2014/04/surveillance_is_the.html)"\n\nHave you noticed? Whenever someone says "you\'re being **too political**", it usually means "you\'ve mentioned a group of people I don\'t care about".\n\nOr **they gaslight you** -- saying you\'re "crazy" for not being white, male, straight, or "American" enough. If you dare to notice the discrimination built into their systems, they try to distract from the issue by **attacking you as a person**, trying to force you to jump through endless hoops of arbitrarily defined "moral purity".\n\n**This is the typical response on Reddit.** Silicon Valley\'s social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit) was built by them, for them. "Them" means entitled middle-class white males. More specifically: _middle-class, white, aged between 18 and 49, male, cisgender, heterosexual, and mostly American_ males. They built social media for themselves and their friends. The rest of us are unwelcome guests in their safe space.\n\n# **Free Speech versus Diversity?**\n\nThis is why the rest of us (non-white, women, LGBT, and others) are treated so badly on their systems. They refuse to ban racist, or violent misogyny and homophobia because it would hurt "free speech". Their persecution anxiety leads their bigotry behind slogans like "diversity is the problem", "don\'t shove _your diversity_ in my face". George Orwell would be proud (or horrified) to see such twisting of words in service of harmfully bad ideas.\n\n&gt; Here\'s an analogy: nuclear power can be used to power entire cities and give millions of people energy for centuries, or destroy cities and commit genocide in the blink of an eye. Should we allow the secrets and materials for nuclear to proliferate everywhere, because it\'s "just science" and "knowledge wants to be free"? Of course not.\n&gt; \n&gt; Should we allow bigotry and hatred to rule on social media because it\'s "just speech" and "information wants to be free"? Of course not.\n\nNow you see the bigotry hidden in Silicon Valley talk about "free speech". It\'s free for them, and the costs are left for us to bear. This is the same as patterns of colonisation throughout the history of Western civilisation. History has begun to repeat itself on the internet.\n\nIn other words, they have no grasp of basic morality for anyone who isn\'t like them. And as you\'ll see here, that means people in India, Brasil and around the world are now starting to die.\n\n---\n\n## **Aadhaar\'s Failure is Facebook\'s Success**\n\nThe question here begins with privacy.\n\nAadhaar is well-known for allowing unauthorised access to [private information of millions of India\'s citizens](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/aadhaar-breach-everything-you-need-to-know/story-VhCKHDIL8lziw6OcnhL4wO.html). People are concerned, are rightfully so.\n\nIn the case of Facebook, selling your privacy to the highest bidder is the entire profit model. That\'s why Facebook is "free". It\'s as if Aadhaar\'s privacy-destroying mistakes are Facebook\'s business plan.\n\nFor India, a country where [69% of citizens live in rural areas](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS), this means that over 300 million people (those who have smartphones) are at risk. And unlike the Indian government\'s dependence on the will of the people, Facebook is completely unaccountable to anyone but their company shareholders.\n\n# **Facebook\'s Plan to Colonise India**\n\nStarting in 2014, [Facebook tried to give away free Internet to rural India](https://www.cnet.com/news/why-india-doesnt-want-free-basics). The bargain was simple: if you use internet through Facebook, we give it to you for free. That really means, "if you allow us to watch, record and sell data about every move you make online, we\'ll give you access to a limited amount of internet for no cost."\n\nThankfully, India\'s regulators eventually said no, and in 2016, the Free Basics program was stopped.\n\n## **Facebook and Bollywood**\n\nIf you\'ve watched any Bollywood films over the past few years, there are two names you\'ll see and hear all the time. You can probably guess. No, it\'s not SRK or Deepika Padukone. Also not Salman Khan or Katrina Kaif.\n\nThe two names are Facebook and WhatsApp.\n\nAgain in rural India, WhatsApp has been involved in [an increasing number of murders](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2017/12/deadly-rumours-india-whatsapp-dilemma-171216091928319.html). The culprit is rumours and intentional misinformation that spread via Facebook\'s messaging service (WhatsApp).\n\nEven though Facebook\'s attempts to colonise India are blatant (the Free Basics program) and have led to several deaths (WhatsApp), they are still making more efforts.\n\nInstead of regulators, they are trying to convince citizens that Facebook is good by having celebrities constantly use the service in Bollywood films.\n\nYou may not have known this, but Instagram and WhatsApp are owned by Facebook. Now think of how many times you\'ve seen films where the real stars in the background are social media accounts on someone\'s smartphone. (There\'s even a Reddit community [specifically for Indian people praising Facebook...!](https://np.reddit.com/r/indianpeoplefacebook/))\n\n# **Democracy, Immigration, Misinformation and Disinformation**\n\nNow think about how easily democracy has been subverted in places like the United States, Britain and Brasil. In the U.S., the Trump campaign openly acknowledged targeting [millions of young women and black voters through Facebook](http://fortune.com/2016/10/30/trump-voter-supression-operations/) to suppress their votes, since they tend to vote Democrat (not Republican; Trump is a Republican). In the case of Brexit, [hundreds of fake Twitter accounts also spread disinformation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/14/how-400-russia-run-fake-accounts-posted-bogus-brexit-tweets).\n\nAs more children and adults in mass detainment centres, the American immigration service (ICE) is [using users\' private Facebook data to target and hunt down immigrants](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/ice-facebook-data-track-immigrants).\n\n# **To prevent colonisation of our digital lives, we must fight back for our right to privacy.**\n\nSo how can we fight against amoral companies like Facebook (with WhatsApp and Instagram) and Twitter?\n\nWe now know that ["free" access via Internet advertising is just another word for intrusive surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/24/deep-surveillance-is-price-of-a-free-web-advertising). We know that in rural India, where many are less educated, people are dying because of misinformation spread through social media. And we know since 2016, that as long as Facebook and Silicon Valley can get away with it, they don\'t care.\n\nThere needs to be an alternative, and it needs to come from the people who are most affected. Not another Facebook, Orkut, Reddit or Twitter, created by white men, for white men -- and if anyone else wants to join, they\'d better not be too "political". The web is run by narcissists and bullies now, and there has to be a better way.\n\nI\'m working with a project that is creating a new social network, but if this post inspires you to start something for India and the rest of the world, I\'d be glad to work with you, too. And if you\'re just hearing some of these facts for the first time, it\'s okay to be angry. Get angry enough to do something right now. The stakes are too high now to just shrug, turn away and take another selfie: if we let Silicon Valley take our privacy away, they will never give it back.'<br />Author: 'nibirujiii'  id: 'atq322'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/atq322/to_fight_digital_colonisation_by_silicon_valley/</li>

Truth:- They were NOT in the blacklist, but in greylist which has not much effect.'<br />Body: '**Title of the article** \\-  [India’s trying to get Pakistan on FATF blacklist, but it won’t really hurt their economy](https://theprint.in/diplomacy/indias-trying-to-get-pakistan-on-fatf-blacklist-but-it-wont-really-hurt-their-economy/196049/)\n\nThe article go on to say that India\'s effort is completely useless and will not do much. This is at a time when India is strongly pushing to put Pakistan in the FATF blacklist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Read this paragraph -** \n\n \n\n&gt;Given the costs, getting Pakistan on the FATF blacklist might seem an effective way to punish the country for the Pulwama attacks. But [evidence](https://thediplomat.com/2018/03/how-will-being-on-the-fatf-grey-list-actually-impact-pakistan/) suggests otherwise.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This won’t be the first time Pakistan is blacklisted by the watchdog. **Pakistan was on this blacklist from 2012 to 2015** and the actual effects of the move on its economy were negligible.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;During this period, Pakistan managed to successfully complete an IMF programme of $5 billion and the country’s exports remained relatively stable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat is a FAKE information. Pakistan was never put on blacklist as far as I can see. They were on GREYLIST inbetween 2012 to 2015 AND the problem is that the link which they have given for the word **"evidence" in the above paragraph itself says that pakistan was on the greylist.**\n\nTheir own link says it was greylist, yet they purposefully are spreading fake information even after knowing the truth. Just to make sure you understand this, I will copy the paragraph from their "evidence" link -\n\n \n\n&gt;The factual evidence, both historic and current, suggests that these assertions are simply incorrect. **Pakistan was on the FATF grey-list from 2012 to 2015**, a period during which it successfully completed an IMF program and raised over $5 billion from the international bond markets. During this period Pakistan’s imports and exports remained stable, evidence that the grey-listing did not raise any significant barriers to trade.\n\nSo, why are they spreading fake information purposefully? There should be an outrage against the writer of that article, and they should be held responsible.\n\n**News from other media -** \n\n# [All Eyes on FATF Today as India Pushes for Pakistan to be Blacklisted Like North Korea and Iran](https://www.news18.com/news/india/all-eyes-on-fatf-today-as-india-pushes-for-pakistan-to-be-blacklisted-like-north-korea-and-iran-2044657.html)'<br />Author: 'zqwz'  id: 'ate1hz'<br />Score:70<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ate1hz/important_fake_information_purposefully_spread_by/</li>

This is to allow users to participate when they are free due to the time zones as India is 5.5 hours ahead of Finland\n\nThe purpose of this event is to allow people from two different nations to get and share knowledge about their respective cultures, daily life, history and curiosities.\n\nGeneral rules of Reddit and the respective subreddits apply on both sides and any troll/hate/edgy/hostile comments won\'t be tolerated. Please be respectful of one another. Remember to have civil discussions and no drama please.\n\nI hope the exchange turns out eventful and would like to see active participation and engaging discussions during the cultural exchange from both sides.\n\nIn light of the recent events, I understand it may not be the best of time to have this cultural exchange but it\'s best we honor what we had planned. I would like to thank the mods of r/Scotland for giving us the privilege to host their subreddit.\n\n\n\nTo get you all started, here are some amazing facts about Scotland!\n\n**Scotland’s national animal is a unicorn.**\n\nThe unicorn is the national animal of Scotland. The Royal Coat of Arms of Scotland, used prior to 1603 by the Kings of Scotland was supported by two unicorns and the current royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom is supported by a unicorn for Scotland along with a lion for England. The unicorn is frequently found as an ornament on mercat crosses. \n\n**Scotland is home to the world’s tallest hedge.**\n\nRecognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the highest hedge in the world, the Meikleour Beech Hedge was planted in 1745 and is one third of a mile long (530 m) and 100 ft (30 m) high. It is thought the men who planted it were called to fight in the Jacobite Rebellion and none of them returned alive. In tribute the trees were allowed to grow and the hedge acts as a living landmark to them.\n\n**Golf originated in scotland**\n\nThe modern game of golf is generally considered to be a Scottish invention. A spokesman for the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, one of the oldest Scottish golf organisations, said "Stick and ball games have been around for many centuries, but golf as we know it today, played over 18 holes, clearly originated in Scotland. The word golf, or in Scots gowf , is usually thought to be a Scots alteration of Dutch "colf" or "colve" meaning  stick or bat. \n\n**The Scots invented the modern world.**\t\n\n1.The first ever artificial refrigeration was designed in 1755 by Scottish professor William Cullen\n\n2.John Logie Baird created the world’s first TV picture on October 2, 1925 \n\n3.Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in Boston in February 1876. \n\n4.The Encyclopedia Britannica, the oldest encyclopedia in the English language and still going strong today, the first issue was published in Edinburgh as three volumes between 1768 and 1771.\n\n5.The toaster was invented in 1893 by Alan MacMasters, a Scottish scientist \n\n6.Scottish banking mogul and trader Sir William Paterson was one of the first to put forth the idea of the Bank Of England.\n\n7.The year 1888 witnessed a nifty contraption, the very first pneumatic bike tyre. This was all thanks to Scottish inventor and veterinary surgeon John Boyd Dunlop.\n\n8.Born in 1996 at the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh, Dolly was the first ever mammal cloned via the process of nuclear transfer from an adult somatic cell. \n\n9.Scottish watchmaker and instrument inventor Alexander Cumming was actually the first to patent the design of the flushing toilet.\n\n10.The breakthrough for the MRI scanner was made by a team working at the University of Aberdeen. In 1980 the team obtained the first clinically useful image of a patient\'s internal tissues.\n\n11.A cult classic and trusty go-to for many gamers, Grand Theft Auto is the brainchild of Scottish video game design extraordinaire David Jones (founder of game company DMA Design, now Rockstar North) and Mike Daily.\n\n\n**Head on over to this thread [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/atc6d8/cultural_exchange_with_rindiaspeaks/) to ask our Scottish friends questions!**'<br />Author: 'Scype_crisis'  id: 'atd2a8'<br />Score:46<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/atd2a8/welcome_rscotland_our_cultural_exchange_is_now/</li>

Breaking treaty is NOT act of war or act of aggression. They call it world\'s most successful treaty in the face of conflict that survived this long. Guess what happened to such reminding 99% treaties with conflicted situations. That\'s correct they are broken. Idiots and paki tools are spreading misinformation that India is weak country and breaking treaty will annoy our masters at UN. Be cautious when someone approach you with notion. \n\n"International treaties are not end all and be all. All the countries including India breaks many treaties all the time which at this point serves like a guide. No treaty would survive especially if it\'s unfair no matter how "international" it is. It is a bilateral treaty brokered by World bank. It is not even act of aggression pulling out of that stupid treaty. Read below article about treaty. Let go of notion of India is weak country and can\'t do anything unless it has UN approval or International approval."\n\nRead below: \n-------------\nhttps://www.jurist.org/commentary/2018/11/sufyan-zia-revocation-indus/\n\n"Finally, it can be concluded that any such unilateral revocation of IWT by India or Pakistan would amount to breach of the international obligation which may incur state responsibility of that state under international law.

120 पैदल\nसैनिकों ने पाकिस्तानी टैंक बटालियन को नाको चने चबवा\nदिए थे। उस समय लगता, हाथ में बन्दूक होती तो हम भी 8-10\nपाकिस्तानी सैनिक ऊपर पंहुचा ही देते।\n\nबॉर्डर रिलीज़ के बाद 1999 में करगिल युद्ध हुआ था। एक दिन के\n\'आज\' पेपर की हेडलाइन आज भी याद है "करगिल युद्ध जारी,\nपाकिस्तान के 50 सैनिक मरे, भारत के 17 जवान शहीद।" ये देख के\nफिर \'बॉर्डर\' की याद आ गयी और सीना गर्व से एक्स्ट्रा चौड़ा\nहो गया। लगने लगा करगिल में भी कोई मथुरादास वक़्त पड़ने पर\nकायर से अब्दुल हमीद जैसा बहादुर बन गया होगा, दुबक कर बैठा\nकोई धरमवीर हनुमान की तरह बल याद दिलाने के बाद\nपाकिस्तानी सैनिकों को मार रहा होगा।\n देश की मिट्टी से\nबेइंतिहा प्यार करने वाला भैरो सिंह, हाथ में एन्टी टैंक माइन\nलेकर पाकिस्तानी टैंक को उड़ाने निकल पड़ा होगा जिसे देखकर\nटैंक वाला सैनिक डर से "पीछे लो, पीछे लो" बोलने लगा होगा\nया किसी सुबह कोई कुलदीप सिंह बाजूका लेकर, गले में ग्रेनेड की\nमाला पहनकर पाकिस्तानी सेना और टैंकों पर धावा बोलने\nनिकल पड़ा होगा। फिर जब वो कुलदीप सिंह किसी टैंक का\nनिशाना बनने वाला ही होगा, तो कोई ऐंडी बजवा हंटर प्लेन\nलेकर चमत्कार की तरह आया होगा और उस टैंक को नेस्तनाबूत करके\nउड़ गया होगा। इस बीच बैकग्राउंड में "हिंदुस्तान, हिंदुस्तान,\nमेरी जान हिंदुस्तान" गाना चलता रहा होगा।\n\nकितना अद्भुत नजारा लगता था ये। युद्ध के बारे में सोचते ही ये\nसब याद आ जाता था और याद करते ही गूज़बम्प्स। इस तरह से इस\nमूवी ने युद्ध को एक ग्लोरी बना दिया था। हालांकि ये\nअकेला कारण नही है, जिस तरह से आपने युद्ध वाली कहानियां\nसुनी है, पढ़ी हैं, इतिहास में स्वतंत्रता संग्राम पढ़ा है,\nमध्यकालीन रजवाड़ों की लड़ाइयाँ पढ़ी हैं, लता मंगेशकर वाले\nदेशभक्ति के गाने सुने हैं जिनके बीच में ऐसी लाइन्स आती हैं, "दस दस\nको एक ने मारा, फिर अपनी लाश बिछा दी।" भरोसा हो\nचला था कि हमारे सैनिक वार मशीन हैं, दुश्मनों को मारकर ढेर\nकर देते हैं, उन्हें डर नही लगता, उन्हें दर्द नही होता। इस चक्कर में भूल\nगए कि उनमे इंसान जैसा कुछ होता है। फिर क्या था, जब भी\nकोई आतंकवादी घटना होती, मैं युद्ध की पैरवी करने लगता।\nपाकिस्तान को मिटा देने की सोचने लगता। सिलसिला\nसालों तक चलता रहा।\n\nकुछ साल पहले एक और वॉर बेस्ड मूवी देखी, \'सेविंग प्राइवेट रायन\'\nजो दूसरे विश्वयुद्ध के दौरान फ्रांस के ओहमा बीच पर हुए \'द\nनोर्मंडी लैंडिंग्स\' ऑपरेशन से शुरू होती है। शुरूआती आधे घंटे की\nलड़ाई देखकर ये देख के समझ आया कि युद्ध असलियत मे क्या होता\nहै। कुलदीप सिंह की तरह बाजूका लेके दुश्मन को कोई नही मार\nपाता, भैरों सिंह की तरह गोलियों की बौछारें खाकर भी,\n\nकोई जिंदा खड़ा नही हो जाता। गोली आती है, किसी\nसैनिक की आंख से होते हुए सर का मांस खोल देती है। किसी बम\nके धमाके में कोई सैनिक अपना एक हाथ खो देता है, फिर वह अपना\nकटा हुआ हाथ ढूंढने लगता है, ताकि शायद डॉक्टर कोई चमत्कार\nकरके उसे वापस जोड़ दे। कैप्टन किसी घायल सैनिक को मेडिकल\nहेल्प तक पहुचाने के लिए हाथ पकड़कर खींच रहा होता है, तब तक\nदूसरा बम सैनिक के शरीर के चिथड़े उड़ा देता है, कुछ चिथड़े और खून\nउसके चेहरे पर पड़ते हैं और उसे महसूस होता है कि वो पूरी बॉडी\nनही, महज एक हाथ, कंधा और उससे जुड़ा सर खींच रहा होता है।\n\nकिसी ब्लास्ट में किसी सैनिक के पेट से आतें बाहर आ गई हैं, वो\nउन्हें कराहते हुए समेटने की कोशिश कर रहा है और मेडिकल हेल्प मांग\nरहा है। घायलों की पट्टी और कटे फटे हाथ, पैर, पेट, मुह में टाँके\nलगाने वाला डॉक्टर खुद खून से लथपथ होता है। जो कराह रहे\nसैनिकों को मॉर्फीन देते हुए, उनके टाँके सिलते हुए उन्हें "कुछ नही\nहोगा, ठीक हो जायेगा" वाला दिलासा देता है जबकि उसे\nपता होता है आंतें बाहर निकल आईं हो तो चार टाँके लगाकर\nआदमी नही बचेगा।\n\nतब एहसास हुआ कि जिस चीज को ग्लोरिफाइ कर रहे थे, वो\nकितनी भयानक हो सकती है। जिस चीज की हर चौथे दिन मांग\nकर रहे थे, उसमे जाने वाले किस मंजर से गुजरते हैं। एक तरफ की सेना\nअगर ज्योग्राफिकल एडवांटेज पर हो तो वो दूसरी सेना के\nसैनिकों का क्या हाल कर सकते हैं। कोई ख़ुशी नही मनाता। युद्ध\nजीतने के बाद जीतने वाले रोते हैं, क्योंकि उनके आस पास उनके\nसाथी बिखरे पड़े होते हैं। और हारने वाले रोने के लिए जिंदा नही\nबचते। किसी गहरी नींद से जागने जैसी फीलिंग आई थी उस दिन।\nजिस चीज की मांग कर रहे हैं, उस चीज को जानना चाहिए। वहां\nका मंजर किसी गार्डन जैसा खूबसूरत नही होता, फुलवामा\nजैसा खौफनाक होता है, जो आँखों के सामने आ जाये तो आँखें\nफट जाएँ और आप शायद बेहोश। दुश्मन देश आक्रमण करे, तो युद्ध\nरास्ता होता है, करना पड़ता है, वो मजबूरी है, एक देश और उसकी\nसेना को उस परिस्थिति के लिए तैयार भी होना चाहिए।\n\nकिसी के मेंटल सैटिस्फैक्शन के लिए युद्ध की बात करना घटिया\nइग्नोरेंस है। सैनिक इंसान होता हैं महज एक संख्या नही जिनको\nमौत के मुह में धकेलने से कोई परहेज न किया जाए। समस्या आई, तो\nसमस्या का रूट कॉज एनालिसिस किया जाना चाहिए, वजह\nनिकल आने पर उसका इलाज ढूँढा चाहिए, और फिर इलाज करना\nचाहिए। न कि सैनिकों की जान की कीमत पर अंधे होकर\n"बदला, बदला" चिल्लाना चाहिए। जैश-ए-मोहम्मद को कैसे\nनेस्तनाबूत करना है, इस पर सिक्योरिटी एजेंसीज और इंटेलिजेंस\nको सोचना चाहिए। इस जैसे और ग्रुप कश्मीर में अप्रभावी कैसे\nहों, ये सरकार की प्रायोरिटी होनी चाहिए। और हमारी\nमांगें भी सेंसिबल होनी चाहिए, महज भावावेश नही, जो\nशहीदों की चिता की धधक शांत होते ही कमजोर होने लगें!'<br />Author: 'Shalini_kapoor'  id: 'asz5o2'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/asz5o2/war_glorification_कवल_मजबत_दल_वल_पढ/</li>

Or virtue signaling? See below -\n\n&gt; How should we respond to it, here and now? To this, the peaceniks have no cogent answer. Not to put too fine a point on it: when it comes to national security, we live in denial.\n\nYes, and it\'s about time they recognised it.\n\n&gt; One, our post-Independence liberal elite feels awkward about nationalism. Like the European elite, we have started associating nationalism with negativity, jingoism and ethnic supremacists. In doing so, we have cut ourselves off from the rich and inclusivist legacy of Indian nationalism. We want to live in a modern nation-state without caring for our nationhood.\n\nWow! Someone actually came out and said it from the "liberal" camp? \n\n&gt; Right from Nehru’s naiveté and the Communists’ silence in the face of Chinese aggression, the Left-liberals have had no defence doctrine of their own. \n\nCalling out the Communists for not siding with India (unlike the Chinese Communists, for whom nation clearly comes first) is unusual too. \n\n&gt; Let us begin by acknowledging that no self-respecting nation-state can sit quietly in the face of such a provocation. The government can and should find an effective way of inflicting serious diplomatic, economic and military cost to the JeM and its handlers in the Pakistani establishment. \n\nIs this man leaving the "liberal" camp? \n\n&gt; While everyone talks about Pakistan, we need to think hard about the more serious long-term security challenges — especially from China. The size and resources of our armed forces need to be aligned with the requirement of India’s security challenges in the 21st century. \n\nThis is the first time, I have seen anyone from the "liberal" camp actually call China out. It is usually the "Right Wingers" who do and are pilloried for it.\n\nHas the "enough is enough" view in India finally diffused into at least one "liberal" now? Or is he simply anxious to distance himself from the rightly blamed "liberals" in India?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'<br />Author: 'xdesi'  id: 'asxx22'<br />Score:67<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/asxx22/an_indian_liberal_soulsearching_now/</li>

A woman\'s life changed when her son returned from Mass at the church and told her that the parish priest had raped him. Cardinal Gracias will open the second day of the summit with a conversation about accountability in the Church. "I told the cardinal about what the priest had done to my child, that  my child was in a lot of pain. So he prayed for us and told us he had to  go to Rome…my heart was hurt in that moment.*\n\n*Asked if he regretted not calling the police personally at the time, he  said: "You know I\'m being honest, I\'m not 100% sure… but I must reflect  on that. I admit whether immediately, the police should have got  involved, sure."*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I had taken St John\'s Hospital, Bangalore, to a consumer forum because they had not conducted a test properly. It took 1-year for the consumer forum to pass a ruling in my favor. Every rule in the Consumer Forum Act was ignored completely.\n\n(That\'s OVER 30 TRIPS of 4hrs each) The sum of money involved was INR:5000. The first thing they do is blame the victim:\n\n1. they said I had acted violently against the hospital\n2. then THEY threatened to levy a fine of INR10K on me\n3. they kept mentioning \'justice\' when literally all MY promised rights under the Act, were being violated by the forum members (Hindu\'s).\n\nBasically the \'Judge/President\' had been bribed to stall proceedings - in fact, the online portal has a list of appearances and many of my dates don\'t even show up on the list.\n\nThe thing is, OUR govt gave them the money/land to setup hospitals - their Koramangala property dates back to when WE first moved to BLR so basically we created these A\\*holes - throuch lack of proper enforcement of regulations.\n\nIt takes a Hindu to backstab a Hindu - NOT A \'LIBERAL\'.

      <li>Title::: 'Neither a Borrower Nor a Lender Be: Why Micro-Credit Brings Only Modest Returns'<br />Body: " Everyday, [Sufiya Begum](http://www.futureofchildren.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Speaking-Truth-Muhammad-Yunus-v1.pdf), a 22-year old mother of 3, borrowed 22 cents from local moneylenders to buy bamboo with which she made furniture. All of her profits went back to those same moneylenders as she had to borrow at interest rates of 10% a day. Lack of access to capital and financial services has locked hundreds of millions of the most vulnerable in poverty. Many have touted microcredit as an intervention that can pull these people out of poverty, but it is unclear how effective it is in fighting poverty. Today's podcast will be exploring the effect of microcredit on global poverty, focusing on the success of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, the microcredit financial crisis of India, and an examination of the empirical evidence on microcredit.\n\nMuhammad Yunnus, winner of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, began his career as banker to the poor in the village of [Jobra](https://www.economist.com/media/globalexecutive/banker_to_the_poor_yunus_e.pdf), Bangadesh. He was inspired by the story of Sufiya Begum to make small loans to [42 women](https://www.economist.com/media/globalexecutive/banker_to_the_poor_yunus_e.pdf). To his surprise, all 42 women paid back their loans. Banks showed little interest in adopting Muhammad Yunus's idea, so in [1983 ](http://grameen%20bank%2C%20microcredit%20and%20millennium%20development%20goals/)Muhammad Yunus created the Grameen Bank. The Grameen Bank's model centered on organizing groups of poor women. Each individual in a group is mandated to save small amounts of money everyday, and receives financial coaching from Grameen Bank employees. Average loans are [small ](http://www.grameen.com/wp-content/uploads/bsk-pdf-manager/GB-2015_33.pdf)around $170, and generally intended for small business creation. While loans are made to individual members, liability for loans are share at the village level among groups of groups. The microlending relies upon social pressure by group members and the fact most members have few borrowing choices beyond microcredit to ensure extremely high levels of [repayment](https://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/reswkpap/pdf/rwp10-11.pdf), Microcredit has grown at a spectacular rate in Bangladesh. [Approximately ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314243671_Microfinance_Market_in_Bangladesh)25 million Bangladeshis, about one seventh of the population, borrow $5 billion from microredit financial institutes every year, and microcredit has been credited for [one tenth](http://www.ifpri.org/blog/how-microfinance-has-reduced-rural-poverty-bangladesh) of poverty reduction in rural Bangladesh.\n\nThe initial success of micro-credit in Bangladesh led to it's rapid expansion. However, as is the case in Andhra Pradesh, India, the result was overexpansion. Vikram Akula, a long time admirer of the Grameen Bank, founded SKS Microcredit in 1995, quickly turning it into one of the regions largest microcredit lenders. Akula argued that microcredit needed to attract private, [profit seeking](http://www.informaticsjournals.com/index.php/jbt/article/viewFile/21237/17453) capital if it was to reach all of the poor. Vikram Akula worked to attract venture capitalists such as Seqouia Capital, the venture capital firm behind Google and Apple. The company's expansion accelerated in 2009, as the company moved towards an IPO. SKS added 100 branch banks, trained 1,000 workers and added 400,000 borrowers in just work. Loan officers were given incentives such as expensive watches and cash bonuses for signing up as many people as fast as possible. Unsurprisingly the quality of loans dropped rapidly, and SKS loan officers had to resort to drastic tactics to [coerce ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203918304577242602296683134)repayments. SKS officers threatened borrowers with violence. Scores of suicides by desperate borrowers have been documented. The public turned against SKS bank, and it's employees were attacked if they attempted to collect loans. Eventually, the government of Andhra Pradesh stepped in, dramatically increasing regulations on microcredit and effectively shutting the for profit microcredit industry down.\n\nGiven Bangladesh and Andhra Pradesh's opposite experiences with microcredit, it is incredibly difficult to say if microcredit has a positive impact on fighting poverty. The original research on microcredit was highly promising. Studies consistently found [large ](https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/jef/vol9/iss1/2/)positive impacts on income, especially for [poor women](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/19162/multi0page.pdf?sequence=1). However, these studies were observational rather than experimental. While economists try to control for education, income and other observable variables in their analyses, it is impossible to control for everything. As a result, developmental economics is coming to use experimental methods such as randomized control trials to understand what works. In 2005, researchers created a microcredit experiment in [Hyderabad](https://economics.mit.edu/files/5993). They partnered with a local microcredit lender to open branches in 52 neighborhoods, and selected 52 other neighborhoods to act as a control and collected a series of survey over the next three years. The researchers found that although households in neighborhoods with a new microcredit branch borrowed substantially more and invested more in small businesses than control neighborhoods, the impact on poverty were modest. RCTs in [Ethiopia\xa0\xa0\xa0,](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.721.1455&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf) [Bosnia ](https://www.nber.org/papers/w18538.pdf),[Morocco](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C15&amp;q=rct+microcredit+morocco&amp;btnG=) and other places have consistently found disappointing results.\n\nThe best empirical evidence suggests that microcredit does not live up to the high hopes of the Grameen Bank, nor does it usually result in impoverishment as among many who borrowed from SKS Bank. It is instead a tool in the fight against global poverty that is useful in some circumstances. The development experience with micro-credit makes it clear that we can only identify the most effective anti-poverty strategies with rigorous analysis.\n\n**Selected Sources:**  \n[Grameen Bank, Microcredit and Millennium Development Goals, Muhammad Yunnus](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4415509)[The Creditworthiness of the Poor: A Model of the Grameen Bank , Michal Kowalik, David Martinez Miera](https://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/reswkpap/pdf/rwp10-11.pdf)[In credit we trust: Building social capital by Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, Asif Dowla](https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&amp;ei=RJJsXOTrLu2zgged8KOoCQ&amp;q=In+credit+we+trust%3A+Building+social+capital+by+Grameen+Bank+in+Bangladesh%2C+Asif+Dowla&amp;btnK=Google+Search&amp;oq=In+credit+we+trust%3A+Building+social+capital+by+Grameen+Bank+in+Bangladesh%2C+Asif+Dowla&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...543.543..747...0.0..0.184.280.1j1......0....2j1..gws-wiz.....0.CPBVggpoV-g)[Beyond Ending Poverty : The Dynamics of Microfinance in Bangladesh, World Bank](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/366431468508832455/Beyond-ending-poverty-the-dynamics-of-microfinance-in-Bangladesh)[Rise and Fall of Microfinance in India: The Andhra Pradesh Crisis in Perspective, Phillip Mader](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264487807_Rise_and_Fall_of_Microfinance_in_India_The_Andhra_Pradesh_Crisis_in_Perspective)[The miracle of microfinance?

      <li>Title::: "Here's what's missing in the current Kashmir discourse - Afghani terrorism"<br />Body: "A big reason why attacks in Kashmir are growing is because the America is increasingly looking to move away from Afghanistan. This means  Islamic terrorism that was increasingly used by Pakistan in the Afghanistan conflict against the Afghanis will be less useful. If there is some minor settlement in the current Taliban talks a large portion of these radicals will be re-routed towards Kashmir. Is India prepared for the wave of terrorism coming from Islamicists in the coming year? I'm not sure. Plus the Pakistanis along with certain Indians will look to increasingly to look to use that to show the Modi government is weak and violent in Kashmir when its really just increased terrorism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIndia needs to start taking certain steps\n\n1.Cut Saudi oil - this doesn't happen because of the Americans. We need to shift to Irani, UAE, and Venezuela oil. All of whom are willing to deal in INR.  De-dollarisation will stop the American arrogance dead in its track.\n\n2. Put tariffs on Chinese goods, riding on the same rhetoric from U.S. \n\n3.Cutting Israeli and U.S defence orders unless they sanction Pakistan. Israel has made a pivot to Saudi which sponsors terrorism and Pakistan\n\n4. Start a massive program of terrorism in Pakistan last time we did this after 26/11 the Americans begged we stop. This time we don't stop.\n\nThis cannot war cannot be won by conventional warefare."<br />Author: 'Taroman23'  id: 'as9cbf'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/as9cbf/heres_whats_missing_in_the_current_kashmir/</li>
      <li>Title::: '[Rediquette] Is "shaheed" the correct word to describe people who died in war or sacrificed their life for the nation?'<br />Body: 'This is something that I learned while casually browsing through another Reddit thread. According to several online dictionaries and this [Oxford Islamic Studies entry](http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t243/e209), the word शहीद or martyr is usually used for people who died for their religion. \n\nI found this [Twitter thread from Tarek Fatah](https://twitter.com/TarekFatah/status/1097117831706087425) where he is asking the same question to his Indian audience. Twitter users pointed out that वीर-गति or हुतात्मा is the correct word for people who sacrifice their lives for the greater good. \n\nNow I am not exactly the guy who cares about semantics but on that Reddit thread, some users did point that using the word "martyrdom" sends out negative impressions because of the connotations attached to it and could make the reader take it lightly. \n\nWhat do you guys think about it? \n\nPS- post is marked rediquette for a reason \n'<br />Author: 'indi_n0rd'  id: 'as8lpa'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/as8lpa/rediquette_is_shaheed_the_correct_word_to/</li>

The international caller would  make a data call, which would be routed through one of the SIM cards on  this device and would be converted to a local call. If the receiver had  a caller ID, it would pull up the local number of the chosen SIM card.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy can't the govt allow for a central DB where people can email their call lists. \n\nEg: I call only a few numbers and these people all have names and addresses. This DB can then build a map which could be used to filter, legitimate caller-receivers, from unknown-shady-type callers."<br />Author: 'veekm'  id: 'as8ivr'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/as8ivr/how_a_suspicious_call_led_police_to_a_telephone/</li>
