It is second in its annual list of 52 places to visit worldwide. There is a big, proud and positive buzz in India about this.\n\nOne of the reasons NYT lists Hampi this year, and so high up, is that this relatively remote treasure in north-eastern Karnataka, along the Tungabhadra river and next to Bellary’s iron ore laden ranges, has become more accessible. The wonderful UDAN scheme has now brought daily flights from Bengaluru and Hyderabad to Vidyanagar, a tiny corporate airport in the Jindal Steel Works (JSW) campus less than an hour’s drive from Hampi. Even better, there is the Hyatt Place Hampi in the same mega steel plant campus, the first prominent chain hotel in the region.\n\nYou can, therefore, reach Hampi easily, stay in comfort and savour the delights of its 7th to 16th century ruins and **imagine what a stupendous kingdom** **it might have been for nearly 500 years until a coalition of sultans sacked, pillaged, and burned it after defeating the Vijayanagara empire in 1565 AD.** Historians tell you it was then the **second largest city in the world after Beijing**, dotted with **temples, palaces, bazaars and water channels**. You can mourn, therefore, the destruction of your own Pompeii or Babylon.\n\nOr, more relevant, you can mourn the destruction of whatever was left after that pillage, the surviving ruins of our most valuable pre-Islamic heritage by our own indifference, and, not to forget, illiterate over zeal to fix what was broken, even if we didn’t know how to.\n\nHistorians and archaeologists can tell you more but even from my philistine’s eyes, I could see the damage we, the latter-day invaders, have done. **The centrepiece of the Hampi complex is probably its oldest structure, the Virupaksha Temple that goes back to 7th century AD. This is the only living shrine in the complex. It is also the most rudely treated.**\n\nIts **50-metre gopuram, which could be older than a millennium, looks painted in gaudy yellow like any other modern-day imitation temple or circuit house**. From where did this abomination come? You are told, the state archaeology department had control of the site even after it got the Unesco World Heritage status and routinely “spruced up” the temple.\n\nIf that’s not enough, walk in and around the temple infested with flies and monkeys. Its corridors are like locked-up ruins. In one corner lies a rusted, broken board with the family tree of Vijayanagara rulers. There is, however, another corner of this corridor that still has life: The **state government runs an ayurvedic clinic and dispensary here**. A hole in the wall, but in a wall dating back to 11th century, if not the 7th.\n\nAn ancient bazaar is being excavated along the avenue leading to the temple. But next to it, **just about 50 metres away, is an inhabited, living, slum**. Inside a World Heritage Site complex. You can see plenty of clothes put out to dry, dish TV antennas.\n\nI find a 2015 story in Bengaluru Mirror on how **Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) fought a turf battle with the state government** **to stop them from removing the ancient steps going to a temple on a mount** (the mountain is also a World Heritage Site) and replacing these with brand new, PWD-style, cement-and-lime blocks. The big, imposing Ganesha, in another temple, had its arms broken by the invaders (as also the famous old Narasimha in another compound). The state archaeology department, it’s seems, “fixed” these with brand new arms. Plastic surgery, apparently, has followed Lord Ganesha from Lord Shiva’s times. ASI has now removed these. So, the poor Lord received artificial limbs but lost those too. And just as well.\n\nThe complex, despite its incredible global value, is hardly fenced; anybody can walk in and out. There are some new toilets, but I can promise you this isn’t part of any ODF (Open Defecation Free) zone. There is incompetence, callousness and vandalism of criminal proportions strewn everywhere. Most of all in the beautiful, octagonal, royal ladies’ bath, named as the “zenana” by a Persian traveller. Every square inch of its walls has some usual so-and-so-loves-so-and-so kind of graffiti, with many hearts pierced by giant arrows.\n\nThe magnificent rulers of this incredibly powerful and rich kingdom built their city along river **Tungabhadra**. Like most other rivers in the country, it **is now a swamp and its banks, just a bushy public latrine**. Warnings about crocodiles also do not deter the adventurous and needy.\n\nGo, take a look at **India’s most wonderful but probably least-appreciated marvel.** Also find time to see how different the Krishna Temple here looks from the rest. So beautifully and classily restored. How did that happen?\n\nIt will take us right back to the debate on whether “evil” corporate companies can be trusted with our heritage like, much newer, Red Fort of Delhi. This temple complex was adopted by the Jindals, who own the nearby steel complex. They brought in the best experts from around the world. ASI is not short of skills or good intentions. The work it is doing is classy too. But do you know what its annual budget for Hampi is? Just Rs 6.5 crore, that is, less than $1 million.\n\nSo, go to Hampi also because it might persuade you to see the idea of involving good corporate companies in preserving heritage differently. It will be much better utilisation of corporate social responsibility money than **building giant new statues, whether of unity or diversity, and running gaushalas in Uttar Pradesh as Yogi Adityanath wants**.'<br />Author: 'arishtanemi_'  id: 'aezdgx'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/aezdgx/mourn_the_destruction_of_indias_pompeii_or/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'People who defend Indira Gandhi are pathetic.'<br />Body: 'Every day I open the newspaper and I come across news about some farmer committing suicide or just burning himself and his family. Everyone is angry at the news and just goes on to say "Why doesn\'t the government help these people". My initial reaction to these news items is "We are still suffering because of that one wicked woman". Anyone will agree that in a country of billion + people, farming alone being the profession of as much as half the country is not sustainable in the 21st century unless and until we export a major part of our food produce at globally competitive prices.\n\nThe textbook case of any country\'s evolution is as follows - agriculture -&gt; mass manufacturing -&gt; services\n\nIn India we did parts 1 and 3 properly. Agriculture was and still is unfortunately dominant in terms of the percentage of population it employs. Only difference is that while agriculture\'s share of GDP was high earlier, it is far lower now but the percentage of population reliant on agriculture hasn\'t declined proportionately to its GDP and we are already seeing the effects - suicides, self immolation and what not. As far as services is concerned, we are one of the most competent countries when it comes to export of services as is evidenced by the rise of meteoric giants like TCS, Infosys and various other companies.\n\nThe part we screwed up -&gt; manufacturing\n\nWhy did we screw up manufacturing? Thanks to one woman named Indira Gandhi. Her thirst for power made her do stupid things to the country\'s economy. She went on to nationalize many private industries such as banking, oil and what not. If that was not enough, her license raj regime whereby the government decided which company can produce what and in how much quantity meant that she empowered herself and her government even more. Some will defend her, saying she was protecting the country from an economic crisis but that crisis nevertheless occurred in 1990s and was more of a boon than a bane.\n\nIndira Gandhi\'s horrible AF policies meant that India lost some of the golden years of the Asian economies to its neighbors. During this phase our country should have made a massive jump from agriculture to manufacturing but we never made that jump. While we were registering a growth rate under 4% from the 1960s to the 1980s, South Korea, Taiwan etc were growing at 8% and above because they really nailed down export led manufacturing. This made all the difference and is why India is such a poor country as of today while our neighbors are way more prosperous.\n\nIndira Gandhi unfortunately had the support of people like very few other governments have had and her policies continue to make their presence felt even today - half a century later !. The reason why the government machinery is still so corrupt is her, her empowerment of government during license raj means that even today the peon of a government agency expects you to bribe him to get your work done.\n\nMost governments even today just keep spending inordinate amounts of time undoing the mess Indira left behind. Unfortunately, most of the coalition governments over the past two decades never had the balls (read UPA) to quickly undo her mess. And when some government like the current one does move ahead to make necessary amendments to alter the labor laws and make manufacturing more viable, unions are quick to react and media gives these morons the attention they don\'t deserve.\n\nI honestly think Indira Gandhi never ever had to sleep in a leaky house or had to sleep without having a proper three course meal. She got the best of medical care and the best of education and the fortunes of her lineage were not dependent on floods or droughts. But her policies made sure that hundreds of millions of Indians DO sleep in a leaky house, can\'t fill their stomach, get no medical care or education and for generations together the survival of their family depends on weather conditions (dependent on agriculture).\n\nHonestly guys, that woman is a cunt because of whom hundreds of millions of Indians suffer today and anyone defending her is an even bigger cunt.\n\n '<br />Author: 'bjpfanboi'  id: 'aew533'<br />Score:158<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/aew533/people_who_defend_indira_gandhi_are_pathetic/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Shashi Tharoor on decline of Indian culture'<br />Body: '&gt;This is a pretty long essay but it’s worth it \n\nAt the outset, I would like to state that this is not an essay that is critical of India or its people in any way. I am merely stating what I have observed and what I have concluded based on these observations. For this is the unvarnished truth. And India cannot palate the truth.\n\nSocrates, the father of Western thought, often spoke of a concept called Thumos. Thumos was very much a Greek concept. An abstract concept that held many meanings and translations. However, this concept has been lost to humanity and no literal translation exists in English. The essence of ‘Thumos’ can probably be summed up by the saying – “When making a decision, a man is faced with two choices. An easy path and a tough path. The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization". And it is this tough road that every society must traverse to reach a peak. Taking the tougher road is an informed decision, for the natural impulse of every man is to take the easy path. He has to consciously take the tougher path, and avoid the easy. However, a man might unknowingly go down the easy path and end up where he did not want to be. Retracing your steps back to the tougher path is often a thankless and sometimes nigh on impossible task. Most men do not make it. India too, is at this cross roads today. And we might not make it.\n\nIt is indeed, ironic then, that I started this essay about the decline of ‘Indian civilization’ with a concept borrowed from the West. This is not to show that Indian philosophy has not reached the high levels of thought to have such a concept, but to merely show how far we have strayed from it. Make no such mistake. For the Vedas, the ultimate repository of Indian philosophy, were written long, long before Socrates’ ancestors even took up the plough and decided to grow the weeds they had observed in the wild and gave them nourishment. We had reached unimaginable highs and fallen from those highs, long before Socrates even had his first coherent thought. All Socrates did then, was re-discover what we had already known. We were superior in all respects. And it is in this very attitude, that lies the seed of our destruction. How many times have you heard your elders say – “Indian culture is the best. Anything associated with the West is bad!”. I hear it all the time. It is a constant din in our ears. Anything associated with the West is decadent and immoral and inferior. And Indian culture is superior to every other culture, past, present and future. Well then, superior in exactly what manner?? Few, if any, gave a concrete answer to this question. If they gave an answer at all.\n\nThe most common response to my question was anger and a rebuke for asking too many questions. How then are we superior? IF we are superior at all? Let us look around the world today and ask ourselves, “How many of the concepts, ideas, and objects that I use in my daily life on a day-to-day basis emerged from purely indigenous sources?” I asked myself this question many times, over and over again. The conclusion was the same everytime. None. To further clarify this point, let us look at the last invention of consequence which had a purely Oriental origin. Gunpowder. And this too was taken up and advanced by the West. If the Chinese invented Gunpowder, it was the West that developed the cannons that used them. Indeed, there is nothing that we can call truly our own except the past. And as all of us have seen, we revere the past. It is drummed into us in our schools, in our universities, in our families and at the dinner table. Indian culture always was and is, miles ahead of the decadent and corrupt influences of the West. It is not. This assertion is nothing but an inferiority complex. And an aversion to the truth.\n\nIt is important to realize that I am not saying that India or Indian culture is inferior or all that we developed as a civilization is a fabrication. It is not a fabrication. We were indeed a highly advanced civilization, and a highly cultured one at that. But we were, and not are. What we are now is a mish mash of cultures that does not know where it is headed.\n\nHow did we then fall so low? How did we, we who had reached highs that even now are only dreamt of, fall to the very depths from where these highs are unimaginable? It is tempting to blame the West, colonialism, British rule and all that. But the problem lies much deeper than that.\n\nEvery empire is built on one strength. One strength that sets it apart from the neighbours and allows it to grow while others around it stagnate. The Roman empire was built on the discipline of its Legions. Most armies of that time were little more than unruly mobs and this proverbial discipline of the Roman Legion made it a formidable attacking force. The British Empire was built on the strength of the trade links between Britain, a small insignificant island, and its vast territorial holdings in every corner of this planet. The dominant empire today is the USA. This empire is a little different. For its strength stems from its culture. Right from Hollywood, to sitcoms, our thought processes and ideas, to even what we eat and wear, it is the cultural power of the USA in full show. Every empire in history has had its one strength. And India too had a cultural empire similar to what the USA has today. A thousand years ago, students flocked from all over the world to study at Nalanda and Taxila. Just as they flock to the USA today. Great ideas were born in this crucible of free thought. Religions, philosophies and sciences were established by enlightened souls. Just as they are being established in the USA today. However, all empires must fall. The Roman empire fell when the discipline of its legions eroded. The British empire fell when its trade links could no longer be kept captive to serve them alone. The cultural empire of the USA is ripe to fall even as I write this. And the Indian empire has already fallen. A thousand years ago India was the USA of the age. Not any more. Today this cultural empire has eroded until all we have left is a kind of cultural hubris. And hubris, as we all know, is a fine quality. Often found in those who perish from it.\n\nThe strength of Indian civilization was always in its openness to new ideas. And a willingness to put in the hard work to further those ideas. Today however, we have neither the openness to new ideas, nor the will to work hard. Take for example the resistance to ‘Westernization’. Does it not speak of a reluctance to embrace new ideas and concepts? This hardening of opinions and closing of minds is prevalent not only in resisting outside influences and ‘preserving Indian culture’, but also in every detail of our lives. A teacher in India does not like it if his student questions him. For in that question, lies the seed of a new idea. And in that seed, lies the implication that the teacher may be wrong. And that is why we Indians do not like someone who asks too many questions, as I found out to my cost when I questioned India’s supposed cultural superiority.\n\nA far more dangerous symptom however, is our instinctive reluctance to work hard for what we want. Our instinctive impulse to take a shortcut. Our instinctive reflex to take the easy road. Here I come back to the opening statement of this essay. “The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization”. The tough road is often a tedious path. And in India, this road is often avoided in favour of the easy. Jugaad. It is nothing but a shortcut. And we as a nation, nay, as a civilization have become addicted to shortcuts. And hence we have fallen. Everything in India can be resolved by a shortcut. If you stand in a queue, there is always a tout who will be happy to help you jump the line for a fee. Instead of paying your taxes, it is far easier to just hide your income under your bed. Why wait for the light to change from red to green when there is no one crossing your path? Why be orderly when you can be disorderly and get away with it? Why work hard when you can steal from someone? Why be polite when you do not have to be? Why throw the garbage into the dustbin when someone is there to collect it from any spot in the city? I could go on and on. Everything in India has a shortcut. And this culture of taking shortcuts has struck root in the very mindset of our society. Every single thing is now a shortcut. Jugaad. Why take the tougher road to civilization? Why apply our minds when someone else can do it? It is easier to run away to the West than stay back and make this country worth living in. Why perform original research in India where you have to build your own apparatus, when you can just hop across the pond and perform that same research in the West, where that same apparatus can be bought off the shelf? Why? Why indeed? Because, it is the short cut. It is the easy path. And it shall lead us to barbarism. It is not an individual failing on the part of Indians. I will not blame any one person for this. It is a failing of our society. Indeed, it is a historical inevitability.\n\nHistorical inevitability? Yes, our decline was inevitable. Every great civilization has declined when its culture of openness is replaced by closed minds and an aversion to questions. Look at Islam a thousand year ago and today. If at all anyone dares to interpret the quoran any way other than the accepted dogma, he is immediately met with a fatwa calling for his beheading. Western civilization has flourished and prospered precisely because it has cast off the yoke that is the Catholic church and allowed free thought. This freedom of thought does remain in India, but only in vestiges. And as we have already seen, it is being gradually eroded. It is historical inevitability. The point is further clarified by a study of entropy. Entropy, in layman’s terms, is a measure of the disorderliness in a system. In any spontaneous process, Entropy always increases. So if we consider human history to be a spontaneous process, interspersed by periods where Man has consciously tried to improve himself, it is not difficult to see how every rise is followed by a fall. As I have already stated, taking the tougher road is an informed decision, while the easy path comes spontaneously. Every civilization at some point, will abandon the long tough road, to take the short cut. And when a society starts taking shortcuts, it begins to decline. Every civilization has declined and so shall we.\n\nAnd so we have declined. Our fall has only begun. And we shall keep falling, for a long, long time. Is there nothing that can be done? I do not know. The only thing that can be done is the administration of a shock treatment. A shock treatment that so drastically affects us that we will be forced to change for the better. The Black Death in the 14th century jolted Europe and gave rise to the Renaissance, which laid the foundation for the current dominance of Western civilization. Kemal Mustafa Ataturk’s radical measures of Westernization and his suppression of anything connected with the decadence of the Ottoman empire, gave rise to Modern Turkey. A nation that is a beacon of hope for the Muslim world. What kind of shock treatment can reverse the tide of India’s decline? I do not know. But the least we can do, is acknowledge that we have a problem. And when you see the problem and the scale of it, it will give you the shock treatment.\n\n'<br />Author: 'Aayush-Ap'  id: 'aekwfv'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/aekwfv/shashi_tharoor_on_decline_of_indian_culture/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Streetside Linguistics #10 paN'<br />Body: '&gt;This episode is a proposal on etymology of vaNij. It also contains a cute rebuttal on a specific argument of Aryan Invasion/Migration theorists.\n\n&gt; Word of the day : Baniya\n\nBaniya as we might know is a classic North Indian term for someone who engages in trade and commerce. The word for commerce itself is Vaanijya. \n\nWe can already guess that vAnijya and Baniya are related, as the va might have become ba, in the local slang, as it happens with many words like vArta --&gt; baat. \n\nThey are indeed related as vaNij is a word found in Rg Veda, vaNij means a trader, someone engaged in commerce.\n\nIf yes, what could be the base root for the word, vAnij ? \n\nvaN means sound, vANi means voice, vINA and veNu are sources of sound. vaN doesn\'t seem to be a fitting root for something related with commerce. \n\nThen, what could it be ? \n\nYaska argues that vanij of Rg Veda is actually comes out of the root paNih.\n\nBefore we go onto paN, let us first remember Yaska, because without Yaska we might not have linguistics as we know it. Yaska was an Indian linguist. He wrote a Vedanga known as Nirukta, a book on etymology. Perhaps the first methodical work on language. Nirukta is appended to a thesaurus called Nighantu, whose surprises are meal of some other day. Mind that he did all this in 6th century BCE. \n\nComing back to paNi.\n\nSome of us who have watched Chanakya, the TV serial might have to recall a little bit. The word that the writers used for currency was paNa. It was a revelation to me, because I had seen the usage of paNa in only two contexts before : \n\n1. One was the word pANi which means handful, as in vajrapANI, padmapANi, cakrapANi. These sort of words are common in Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism. \n\n2. The other word was paNi, a class of Rig Vedic "demons", who were wealthy and looked after the treasures. They are told to be miserly, tough bargainers, unwilling to sacrifice. They were also said to keep hold of the cows and riches, that the dragon Vala had taken from the Devas. \n\nNow, a lot of early philologists, especially those with an enthusiasm for Aryan Invasion theory took the demon Panis to be a human race, a different and affluent race. Some of them even connected them with Harrapans, some with Tamil merchants and what not. Almost blind to what Yaska, the OG had said, paNiH vaNij bhavati. \n\nNow, let us see what the root paN holds. Will that tell us anything about paNi ?\n\n&gt; Root of the day : paN\n\npaN --&gt; to barter, to purchase, to bet, to bargain, to put at stake.\n\npaNa --&gt; currency, contract, bet, price.\n\npaNa --&gt; **handful**. It is probable that **handful** was used as a method of transaction, but then was later used for handful of any item as we see in cakrapANi, vajrapANi etc.  This is the earliest reference of Lagaan-type tax.  \n\npaNa --&gt; business, property\n\npANa --&gt; trade\n\npANi --&gt; market\n\npaNana --&gt; buying, purchasing, dealing\n\npaNita --&gt; staked, placed as bet\n\npaNitR --&gt; trader, seller\n\npANimula --&gt; wrist, as pANi is a handful. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI think it is fairly clear why Yaska said paNiH vanij bhavati (paNi is vanij). \n\nBut, as I said, the philologists had their own strong-headed-ness towards Panis. For them Panis did not have any deeper mythological significance.\n\nFor them, they were a separate race, a race of traders and merchants. Meanwhile, Aryans were pastoralists and were at odds with them. Once, Harappan excavation was done, and it showed that India indeed had cities in the Indus valley. The successors of the first batch of Indologists, explained away the Harappans as Panis. \n\nThe Discovery of India, written by Jawaharlal Nehru, and televised by Shyam Benegal blatantly puts out this error. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPanis had a mythological significance. I had explained the metaphor of fortress in the Monday Mythology episode of Indra. In the pilot Mythology episode, I had mentioned that Sarama was a trickster figure, and there is a reason why she is represented as a dog. In a very similar light we have to heed that keepers of the metaphorical treasure (paN), are paNis. \n\n\n\n\n\n'<br />Author: 'decoder007'  id: 'aea0g3'<br />Score:31<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/aea0g3/streetside_linguistics_10_pan/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'The two sides of Below Poverty Line Cards, how the rich exploit it while some poor still fail to use it.'<br />Body: 'I somehow came in contact with a person who our family knows from a long time, this person lets call her Selvi. I will give a little intro on the person so we know more of her and later coming to the actual story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Selvi is aged around 60 now, she is unmarried and worked the whole life first along with her father and later alone in a factory. Like her name goes yes she is a Christian. Very strong believer in Jesus , probably I guess she is second or third generation Christian. \n\nHer father spoke good English and was a Goldsmith. I remember Selvi from my childhood days, when she worked as flower seller making garlands and selling it for Rs.2 - Rs.3 in those days. She always sat on those market areas where people sell fruits vegetables and flowers. She later on worked in different jobs since selling flowers were no longer earning her enough to maintain the house and look after sick father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I met her and asked her how she is doing, somehow I happened to ask her has she benefited with some of the schemes that the Modi Govt has given to the poor and to this her reply was I quote, "Ayo vanoo panale paa" meaning I have got nothing from the Modi Govt or they have done nothing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI later started explaining to her all those facilities that she could avail and asked her if she has done her income certificate and owns a BPL card. And to my surprise she said no. Well she did try to get the BPL card and one of our family friends had helped in getting the Income certificate and when she went in to make the BPL card she was denied since she has no family background and since her parents are dead, it somehow makes it complicated or tough to get a BPL card for a poor single women in the age of 60.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I didn\'t stop here, I later inquired a little more and told her she could get hold of some social worker aka political worker and get it done with his influence to which she said yes I have to try it this way and another family friend suggested her she could bribe or get her sister daughter to be her kid and kind of create a fake family and get it done. To which she said oh no this is illegal I have heard many people getting caught and I\'m afraid to do this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Rich Side of BPL Cards\n\nI was a little disappointed looking at her situation and thought how many like her are suffering because they are unaware of the schemes and also don\'t know where to go what to do, they are just helpless and are in a pretty hopeless situation. Who do we have to blame for these kind of the situation. The Govt ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I spoke about her to one of her family friends they offered help and said they will see what they can do. They knew someone in our locality who has helped many and even got Aadhar , Voter ID and BPL cards for people coming from Bangla (Not sure if they meant Bengal or Bangladesh since people tend to use Bangla for both).\n\nI later learnt of 3 people who have availed BPL cards, read on about their status.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1st Person:**\n\nWorks in a govt aided school is from a rural area owns 10 acres of land and has a BPL Card, I further learnt he even got his farm loans waived off with some help and bribing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2nd Person:**\n\nOwns a lot of land in Bengaluru , husband works as a Civil Engineer both have a two wheeler and a car pretty luxurious one. The icing is husband has used this BPL card to claim loan from BBMP for an amount of few  lakhs for the construction of house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3rd Person:**\n\nAgain owns a lot of land, got her daughter married off to a great wedding spending lakhs. Owns two wheeler , gets rent as a source of income and they are leading a pretty good lifestyle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Is our Society to blame for this ?\n\nRemember there are many people like Selvi who are down and struggling, instead of coming and helping out such people our society fails while bathing in greed and asking for more. What hurt me more was all the 3 persons come from the majority community. One shares pro Modi stuff and beats their chest saying such a great leader we have got, he also goes about doing stuff for Majority Social events etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAren\'t people like Selvi the ones who the Missionaries exploit, do we even have the rights to say that missionaries are exploiting poor people ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is a video of Ajit Doval\'s talk on North East India and North East Indians - [NSA Shri Ajit Doval speech on Northeast Indians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_Rht43ocTQ) . Here he clearly mentions on how foreign missionaries come to the remotest parts of India and exploit people, while the same North East people who come to different parts of India are treated bad and denied help.\n\nWe can go about complaining so many things about so many people , organizations, political parties etc etc but as long as each one of us and people around us don\'t change or opens up their eyes and heart we will continue to be living in the current situation facing the same issues, though I completely agree there has been tremendous change in the people coming out of poverty but still the rate could be so much faster if we all make a little more effort in changing the way we think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'ae9wip'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ae9wip/the_two_sides_of_below_poverty_line_cards_how_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Thread by @shwetankbhushan - The REAL Rafale Story'<br />Body: "Source: https://twitter.com/shwetankbhushan/status/1082557425054613504\n\nThere is a need to revisit some details about India’s effort to buy Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft since beginning to know how CONGRESS Party compromised the nation and was a backburner to the arms dealers. Please read the subsequent tweets:\n\n\nAfter the Kargil war, to strengthen the depleting squadrons of the Indian Air Force, the original proposal to buy MMRCA was first initiated during Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s NDA govt but they were moved out of power.\n\nYear-2005: A policy change [OFFSET POLICY] was brought in by the UPA Govt. by which it was mandatory for foreign firms bagging defense contracts in India valued at Rs 300 crore and above to bring back 30% of the contract value into India for procuring goods or services.\n\nA close associate of Robert Vadra, Sanjay Bhandari who was a car dealer, got into the offsets business and became a high-profile defense consultant, liaison services provider and executor of offsets obligations for foreign armament companies. Wow!\nYear-2007: The UPA government finally initiated the RFP (Request For Proposal) for 126 MMRCA fighter aircraft. Sanjay Bhandari set up his flagship company - Offset India Solutions (OIS) Group in 2008 with a paid up capital of Rs. 1 lakh.\n\nYear-2008: Bhandari's name first surfaced in connection with the deal to purchase Trainers Aircraft for the Indian Air Force, when Swiss firm Pilatus decided to engage Bhandari’s OIS, though, unofficially. \n\nYear-2009: Guess who joins Bhandari at Zurich? Our wheeler-dealer hero and newly minted Shiv Bhakt, Robert Vadra. Sanjay Bhandari got the tickets booked for Vadra to Zurich (Switzerland) for the Pilatus deal. \n\nAt the same time, a property worth Rs 19 crore was purchased in the name of Robert Vadra in London in 2009, which, reports claim, were funded by Sanjay Bhandari. \n\nYear-2010: Bhandari gets deals thrown at him like confetti. Even before the trials for Basic Trainer Aircrafts (BTA) in Sept-Oct 2010, Bhandari received one million Swiss francs from Pilatus. \n\n\nYear-2011: IAF in the meanwhile conducted technical evaluations and flight evaluations and in 2011, declared that #Rafale and #Eurofighter Typhoon had met its criteria. The Vadra-Bhandari duo was eying this whale of a deal.\n\nOn the other hand, in 2011, IAF, in a great hurry to buy new basic trainers chose #Pilatus PC-7 in a questionable selection process. The Korea Aerospace Industries had strongly protested the deal claiming Pilatus had submitted an incomplete bid demanding its disqualification.\n\nSouth Korea’s Defense minister personally contacted A.K. Antony, his Indian counterpart, requesting a “high-level review.” The #Pilatus deal was put on hold.\n\nYear-2012: The Bhandari-Vadra duo pressurized the UPA govt. Powered through top political establishment, the objections of Korean Aerospace were overruled, the deal was cleared by the CCS in May 2012 and Pilatus was awarded the Rs 4,000 crore ($1Bn) BTA contract.\n\nThe same year, #Rafale was declared L-1 and contract negotiations began with Dassault Aviation. The proposed deal on the table was to buy 18 aircraft in flyaway condition from France and 108 to be made locally by HAL.\n\nDassault starts signing offset agreements including RIL. RIL had formed a new company Reliance Aerospace Technologies Ltd for this purpose. The MOU was inked after Rafale emerged as the L-1. This was hurting the ambitious Vadra-Bhandari duo.\n\nYear-2013: Bhandari's company, OIS approached Dassault for a possible tie-up. French govt received 'STRONG' recommendations to consider OIS's bid in Rafael deal. This report states that “There was considerable pressure to tie up for a partnership.”\n\n\nBut Bhandari was under investigation for charges of wrongly influencing defense deals. When Dassault came to know this, they decided against partnering with his firm. UPA Govt totally withdrew from the negotiations. All these charges are under investigation by the ED &amp; CBI.\n\nThe FAMILY DECIDED TO BLOCK THE RAFALE DEAL and middleman #ChristianMichel was fielded to negotiate with #Eurofighter.\nAlso, a brazen attempt was also made to kill the HAL's program to develop 106 trainer aircraft in favor of additional Pilatus trainers through ACM NAK Browne.\n\n\nYear-2014: Bhandari’s shadow world would have remained hidden. But Mr. Modi's rule came, his company was probed by the IT, CBI, and ED and found that he was a kingpin of scandals, he was also importing cars by avoiding customs duty. Bhandari's business dealings were red-flagged.\n\n\nYear-2015: Def Min Parrikar himself found the #Pilatus Deal fishy and asked for an investigation. The case was taken up by CBI, a link to Bhandari was found and then later, his firm was barred from doing any business with MoD.\nIn a parallel development, the Indian Express reported this FRAUD: “components, part of an IAF proposal to pay Pilatus under the maintenance head were not calculated during the RFP stage before declaring it the lowest bidder.”\n\nYear-2016: The Modi Govt had ordered a probe into the #Pilatus deal and CBI had begun an investigation. \n\n\nBhandari's offices were raided by IT Dept. During the raids, confidential/secret defense ministry documents were found in his possession and he was booked under the Official Secrets Act by Delhi Police. But before he could be questioned further, he managed to escape to London.\n\nIn the documents recovered during these raids, agencies had also found email exchanges between #Bhandari and #RobertVadra. Emails and phone calls scrutinized by investigators also reveal that Bhandari was in regular contact with bureaucrats and politicians.\n\nYear-2017: On further investigation by ED, Robert Vadra's aide Bhandari was also booked under PMLA, and ED had seized assets worth 26.61 crores. \n\nYear-2018: The #Eurofighter is the real motive for Rahul's Rafale song and dance! Congress spokesperson openly started asking Govt, why did they not reconsider Eurofighter Typhoon? Haay Paisa!! \n\nAfter a decade of filtration, technical evaluation, tender Process, when Rafale was found to be the lowest bidder, Congress Government stopped it for reconsideration only because the Commission was not paid. The more #ChristianMichel sings, the more Rahul gonna dance. Just wait.

Ideally abroad, Journalists corroborate with sources - but In India, they don't.

      <li>Title::: 'TIL: In 1983 Tamil Nadu CM MGR stirred up controversy by announcing state Govt is considering proposal to extend concessions given to backward, SC castes to all poor people irrespective of caste, he was forced to go back on the move due to stiff opposition. He later increased quota from 31% to 50%'<br />Body: 'Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran has a flair for the  flamboyant political gesture. But this time he has stirred a hornet\'s  nest by announcing that the state Government is considering a proposal  to extend the concessions given to backward and scheduled castes to all  poor people irrespective of their caste.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Anywhere in the country such a  move would have caused a rumpus. In Tamil Nadu, where the Dravida  Kazhagam (DK) movement with its strong anti-Brahmin leanings is very  powerful, the move is positively daring.\n\nVery courageous\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Both the opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and MGR\'s own All  India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) are offspring of the  rationalist DK movement. And Tamil Nadu has always led the country in  the matter of reservations - there is a 50 per cent reservation in  educational institutions and for state government jobs. \n\nThe state also  has a staggering 174 castes which are listed as backward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Instant Opposition:  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;MGR\'s proposals were instantly denounced by both the DMK party chief M.  Karunanidhi and DK General Secretary K. Veeramani. Said Karunanidhi:  \n\n"The Constitution recognises only social and educational backwardness."\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;MGR and Veeramani: Crossing swords Veeramani,  who heads the backward castes movement in the state says he will fight  the battle in court if necessary. He is equally vehement about the  proposals and adds: \n\n"Singling out the poor of the forward communities  for favoured treatment is unconstitutional, because it offends the  principle of equality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The state Government can think up ameliorative  measures for the economically weaker sections in general irrespective of  the commmunity they belong to."  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The chief minister does not,  however, seem to be in a mood to be cowed down by such statements. \n\nHe  has stuck to his guns and insists that "all backwardness ultimately  **boils down to economic backwardness."**\n\nBeautiful point.\n\nHe is said to be strongly of  the view that all poor people should be eligible for the same  concessions irrespective of their caste. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Expounding on the possible  criteria which could be used to define poverty, the chief minister  recently suggested that everybody who is not eligible to pay income tax  could be classed as poor.\n\nThis suggestion met with an immediate  retort from Veeramani, who said\n\n, "only 3 per cent of the population pays  income tax so does MGR imply that 97 per cent of the populace is  economically backward and therefore eligible for concessions?"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt  is not certain whether it is by coincidence or not but the controversy  has blasted to the surface just after the first ever National Conference  of Backward Castes held in Madras on December 11 and 12. The largely  attended and impressive meet demanded that the B.P. Mandal Commission  Report of 1982 should be fully implemented.\n\nThe conference also  announced that it would be starting a five-week programme of rallies as a  prelude to a "mighty national movement" to see that the Mandal Report  is implemented. The major demand of the committee would not make much  difference in Tamil Nadu as the state is already reserving more than the  27 per cent recommended by the Mandal Committee.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Previous Attempt:  \n\nThis is not the first time that the actor-turned-politician has tried  to rake up the issue of reservations. In 1979 he had tried to specify an  annual income ceiling of Rs 9,000 for members of the backward classes  for them to be eligible for reservations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;MGR was, however, forced  to go back on the move in the wake of stiff opposition. In fact, he was  forced to step down \n\nIn a bid to placate the backward classes he  increased the reservation quota from 31 per cent to 50 per cent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe  questions of classification of backward classes and reservations have  assumed added importance now in view of the Tamil Nadu Government\'s  appointment of a backward classes commission to review the existing  system of enumeration and listing in response to a Supreme Court  directive.\n\nSome students have gone to court to challenge the state  Government\'s 1980 order, listing 174 castes as backward. And since the  backward castes constitute a large portion of the electorate it will be  interesting to see if MGR backs down this time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Source:***\n\n[*https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/indiascope/story/19830115-tamil-nadu-cm-mgr-stirs-a-hornets-nest-with-his-concessions-for-all-proposal-770344-2013-07-26*](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/indiascope/story/19830115-tamil-nadu-cm-mgr-stirs-a-hornets-nest-with-his-concessions-for-all-proposal-770344-2013-07-26)'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'ady6o1'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ady6o1/til_in_1983_tamil_nadu_cm_mgr_stirred_up/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Coudn't help notice some similarities between the life of indentured Indians during British rule and the US h1b/green card system"<br />Body: 'The other day, I was watching an American food show. They were showing the food culture of an island somewhere near Africa. I was surprised to see that most of their food were South Indian. They were all brought there by British as indentured servants.  So, I did some research and came upon a book titled "*Indian Indenture in the Danish West Indies, 1863-1873 by Lomarsh Roopnarine (2016)*". Given below are some text from the "introduction" chapter in this book. I couldn\'t help notice some similarities with the situation of an h1b Indian waiting for greencard. Its kind of amusing that some things haven\'t changed much between then and now.\n\n&gt;For about 80 years (1838–1917), the British, Danish, Dutch, and French governments brought about 500,000 indentured Indians from India to the Caribbean (see below). The arrival of these individuals was in response to (1) a labor shortage brought about because of the gradual withdrawal of Africans from plantation labor following slave abolition in various time periods in the mid-nineteenth century; and (2) the unsatisfying results of indentured labor from Europe, Africa, Java, Portugal, Madeira, China, and within the Caribbean. Of the 500,000 indentured Indians brought to the Caribbean region, an estimated 175,000 returned to their homeland when their contracts expired, while another 50,000 of those persons emigrated to the Caribbean for the second and even the third time. British Guiana and Trinidad received the bulk of the emigrants.\n\n&gt;**Indians were brought to the Caribbean on an indenture labour contract system that bound them essentially for five years on a sugar plantation with a fixed daily wage (about one shilling a day). At the end of the five years, indentured servants were given the option to re-indenture for another five years and qualify for industrial residence in the colonies as well as an entitlement to free repatriation. After 1873, indentured Indians were given the option to exchange their rights to a return passage back home for a parcel of land, normally about five acres.** A majority of Indians accepted the third option and stayed in the Caribbean, mainly in Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad, after their contracts expired. Life during indenture was harsh. On arrival, Indians were placed in vacant slave quarters that can only be described as subhuman conditions, and they were also isolated from the rest of the population. **Their labor contract was designed largely to benefit their employers. The worst aspect of their contracts was immobility and fixed wages coupled with a series of ordinances that governed the indentured servants’ daily lives.** The planters ensured that the indentured servants complied with the restrictive and one-sided terms of their contracts. Any deviation from this obligation resulted in hefty fines and punishment for the indentured. Arguably, the early post- emancipation labor relations were based on retaining a cheap labor supply, pruning costs, and reaping as much as profit as possible. **The planters certainly had the upper hand in this relationship. In spite of disadvantages, indentured Indians continued to arrive in the Caribbean because of bad socioeconomic conditions at home and opportunities to work and save from indentured contracts.**\n\nH1B is given for maximum 3 years at a time, and then allow you to renew for another 3 years. H1B restricts the person to that employer, and its not that easy to change (now with Trump, its extremely risky). This allows the employer to take advantage of the h1b, limit their salary/career growth. The wait for greencard/residency is insane. And Indians still put up with it because they feel life is better there than India.\n\n'<br />Author: 'vanillacobra'  id: 'adprum'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/adprum/coudnt_help_notice_some_similarities_between_the/</li>

On a trip back home in Delhi this month so I decided to ask my relatives two questions about topics I know are taboo in Indian culture.\n\nThe first question I asked was "if one of your kids turned out gay, how would you have reacted?" \n\nAmong the responses I got were:\n\n"Throw him out of the house"\n"Cut his head off"\n"Society won\'t accept it"\n"It\'s legal but it\'s madness" \n"It\'s not a marriage. It\'s not male and female. There is no conception so by Hinduism it is not a marriage but rather just a baseless attraction"\n"I will support my kid but I know the family and society won\'t" \n*One of my relatives said he did not want to discuss this with me and walked out of the room* \n\nThe second question I asked was "do you consider black people inferior to us?" The reason I asked this question was because one of my African American friends wanted me to join me on this trip to India but I had been hesitant and ultimately convinced him not to come because I knew that there is a lot of stigma around blacks in India and I did not want him to face any issues. \n\nThe answers I got from my relatives were:\n\n"They tend to be violent and druggies" \n"It is genetically in them to be violent and bad people"\n"They don\'t have a good reputation here" \n"They are so ugly. Don\'t dare marry one"\n"Negroes are ugly and they are gangsters. Stay away from them. Don\'t be friends with them" \n\nHonestly I was just incredibly shocked to hear these things from my own aunts, uncles, and grandparents. It seems like many of them had no clue what they were talking about asides from anecdotes. \n\nThey have likely never even interacted with an African American and yet they hate them beyond belief. They refused to believe me when I said that Hinduism and pre-British India contained many homosexually tolerant themes and concepts. \n\nLuckily my cousins who are all my age had far far far far more tolerant views, but it is still alarming to see just how horrible the viewpoints of the elder age groups of India are. \n\nMy family is upper middle class and well educated so hearing such things from THEM made it so much worse.

The Persian-origin term\xa0atesh\xa0(آتش) means\xa0fire, and is a loanword in\xa0Azerbaijani; it is etymologically related to the Vedic अथर्वन् atharvan.\xa0Gah\xa0(گاہ) derives from Middle Persian and means "throne" or "bed" and it is identical with\xa0Sanskrit\xa0"griha" गृह for house, which in popular usage becomes "gah".\n\nThe temple was a Hindu, Sikh,  Zoroastrian place of worship which was abandoned in the 19th century.\n\n2. Hindu diaspora of Fiji\n\n https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism_in_Fiji\n\nMost of these people arrived Fiji as labours during British Raj. They now reside as permanent residents there and continue to practice their faith. \n\n3. Angkor Wat\n\nAngkor Wat is one of largest temple complexes in the world. This humongous structure is located in Angkor, Siem Reap in Cambodia. The temple was initially dedicated to Lord Vishnu but was gradually turned into a buddhist place of worship. A Budhdha like looking statue of Lord Vishnu still stands in the southern tower. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat\n\n4. Mentions of kingdoms in hindu epics. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/HGcFWTt\n\nThe Mahabharata has mentions of kingdoms and tribes from as far as Turkmenistan, Kyrgistan (Caucasian territory) and Iran. \n\n5. Bodhidharma\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhidharma\n\nBodhidharma was a wandering monk who arrived China roughly in 5th century ce. Multiple sources suggest he was a Tamil prince who decided to lose his royal status and belongings to spend his life travelling to far off lands. He is credited with the inception of Chan Budhdhism (aka Zen Budhdhism) in China and subsequently Shaolin Kung Fu (disputed). \n\n6. Sun Wukong from ["Journey to the west"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West)\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Wukong\n\nSun Wukong (aka the Monkey King) is a character from the popular chinese classical novel Journey to the west. The novel and the characters carry hindu influence. \n\n&gt; Buddha seals him there using a paper talisman bearing the\xa0mantra\xa0Om Mani Padme Hum\xa0in gold letters. "Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ\xa0(Sanskrit:\xa0ॐ मणिपद्मे हूँ)". \n\n&gt; Throughout the epic novel\xa0Journey to the West, Sun Wukong faithfully helps Tang Sanzang on his journey to\xa0India.\n\n&gt; [The Hindu deity\xa0Hanuman\xa0from the\xa0Ramayana\xa0is also considered by some scholars to be one of the influences for Sun Wukong. ](http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp081_monkey_sun_wukong.pdf)\n\nI vaguely remember reading somewhere that the story and the characters are influenced by the Silk Route, hence the mention of Hindu kimgdoms. \n\nInteresting fact : The character Sun Wukong (The monkey king) was the basis of the cult classic anime character Goku from Dragon Ball Z. Son Goku (the actual name of Goku in the original manga)  is also the name of Sun Wukong in Japanese legends. Goku, like Wukong has a tail, a staff as a weapon and has superhuman strength and stamina. \n\n7.

      <li>Title::: 'Why NTA was a bad decision by Union after all'<br />Body: 'Hello Everyone,\n\nI am preparing for JEE Mains. And it is stressful. Especially this year.\n\nI think I need to share a light on what is the students\' perspective of the recent changes made by HRD of Indian Government to hold JEE Mains twice a year from now on.\n\nHere are some of my points as to why this was a bad decision after all, and how it defeats the purpose of holding twice itself.\n\n1. Ill-prepared Junior Colleges and Schools.\n\nWe have our State-board prelims from 9th of January, perfectly coinciding with the JEE January schedule (8th to 15th January). That means we have to juggle ourselves with coaching institutes, colleges and the self preparation altogether; which invariably has split up the students in two : Boards /CET and Mains.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Shorthand Notice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis decision, of forming a separate entity to administer JEE was taken on July 12th. Sure,6 months to prepare but with no clarity as to what are the changes related to the paper. Those were released in October. Till then majority of coaching centres were stuck to their formulaic plan=To teach Mains after January (i.e. After Boards preparation is done)\n\nThis resulted in lesser time to study for students, as we had our Practicals,Journals and a shitload of other things which take place before December Prelims.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.Type of Questions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStill, NTA has not clarified from where the questions will be derived. Since CBSE itself conduced JEE before, NCERT was enough for most of the content. But now, there is no framework for the questions to come, and that has benefited the devils itself. Label \'Crash Courses\' by the coaching institutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. Suicide.\n\nThe very reason (claimed,reason) for which NTA was formed. Their intuition was to held JEE twice so there will be lesser stress on students.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat were they thinking. With the \'75%\' minimum required for IITs; we needed time to prepare for Boards.Which is an entirely different ball-game altogether.\n\n19 students,one of whom I personally  knew commited suicide in December 2018 alone.\n\nSome say "It\'s too early" or "The reason cannot be JEE alone"\n\nWell then, what can it be? We are expected to sacrifice 2 years behind a notion, a dream which seems achievable but is the distant truth from the grim reality. \n\nIt isn\'t normal when students joke about suicide. (Yes they do, along with a nervous giggle that follows)\n\nWhat does the society expect from us? The Heavenly gates of IIT isn\'t achievable for everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter all, we aren\'t even old enough for a driving license. And you expect us to drive our future early on.\n\nPeace &lt;3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;'<br />Author: 'Sant268'  id: 'ad6j6s'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ad6j6s/why_nta_was_a_bad_decision_by_union_after_all/</li>

Back then, India were paired in a group consisting of favorites Australia and South Korea while Bahrain, a regular decent Asian side, also featured. India lost all three matches, with all three pretty much decided by halftime, but the fact that India participated was what mattered. This was India\'s first Asian Cup appearance in 27 years, since 1984.\n\n***1964 and 1984***\n\nIndia first participated in the AFC Asian Cup in 1964, the competitions 3rd edition. India qualified automatically after all other teams in the Western Zone of qualification withdrew. Despite that, India showed why they deserved to be in the competition by finishing as the tournament runners-up. They started with a 2-1 victory over South Korea, followed by 2-0 defeat by hosts Israel, and finally a 3-1 victory over Hong Kong. This would be India\'s best finish in the tournament.\n\nIndia would fail to qualify for the Asian Cup until 1984, when they finished 2nd in Group 3 during qualification. However, unlike 20 years earlier, India couldn\'t make it out of the group stage and ended last in Group B (consisting of China, Iran, United Arab Emirates, and Singapore).\n\n***Path to 2019***\n\nIndia\'s path to the 2019 AFC Asian Cup began in 2015 with the qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Despite being in a group consisting of Iran, Oman, Turkmenistan, and Guam, India finished in last place, with only 1 victory and 7 defeats. This meant that India didn\'t qualify for the World Cup and the Asian Cup automatically but instead had to go through another two rounds of qualification for the Asian Cup.\n\nIndia were drawn to play against Laos in the play-in round for Asian Cup qualification. Following a 1-0 victory in Leg 1, India managed to destroy their opposition in the second leg 6-1 (7-1 aggregate). India now had one more round of qualification to go through. They were placed in Group A consisting of Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan, and Macau. India managed to comfortably qualify after winning 4 of their matches, drawing once as well.\n\n---\n#[](#icon-news-big) Manager and Squad\n\n**Manager**: [**Stephen Constantine** (*England*)](https://d1u4oo4rb13yy8.cloudfront.net/article/64280-qzcegqpawx-1501232786.JPG) \n\n\n**Goalkeepers**: Gurpreet Singh Sandhu (*Bengaluru*) , Vishal Kaith (*Pune City*) , Amrinder Singh (*Mumbai City*)\n\n**Defenders**: Narayan Das (*Delhi Dynamos*) , Pritam Kotal (*Delhi Dynamos*) , Sandesh Jhingan (*Kerala Blasters*) , Anas Edathodika (*Kerala Blasters*) , Subhasish Bose (*Mumbai City*) , Salam Ranjan Singh (*East Bengal*) , Sarthak Golui (*Pune City*)\n\n**Midfielders**:  Rowllin Borges (*Northeast United*) , Halicharan Narzary (*Kerala Blasters*) , Jackichand Singh (*Goa*) , Pronay Halder (*ATK*) , Udanta Singh (*Bengaluru*) , Anirudh Thapa (*Chennaiyin*) , Ashique Kuruniyan (*Pune City*) , Germanpreet Singh (*Chennaiyin*) , Vinit Rai (*Delhi Dynamos*)\n\n\n**Forwards**: Sunil Chhetri (*Bengaluru*) , Jeje Lalpekhlua (*Chennaiyin*) , Balwant Singh (*ATK*) , Sumeet Passi (*Jamshedpur*)\n\n\n\n#[](#icon-whistle-big) [POTENTIAL STARTING XI](https://imgur.com/a/7fh2Hq0)\n\nAll the players here play in the Indian Super League and have been used extensively by head coach Stephan Constantine.\n\n\n---\n\n#[](#icon-info-big) Players to Watch\n\n[**Gurpreet Singh Sandhu**](http://blog.cpdfootball.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/20150228-gurpreet-singh-sandhu-1.jpg): The 26-year-old goalkeeper has 26 caps for India. A product of East Bengal, Sandhu moved to play in Europe in 2013 when he joined Norweigan side Staebek. He was the club\'s 2nd choice goalkeeper but played in the Europa League qualifiers with them before returning to India and joining Bengaluru. He played a massive part in Bengaluru finishing 1st in ISL last season and did well in the ISL Final. He is tall (6 ft, 4 inches), can stretch really well for saves,. and commands his defense well. Weakness is probably his agility but he makes up for it by making himself big in major moments.\n\n[**Sandesh Jhingan**](https://www.sportsindiashow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sandesh-jhingan.jpg): 25-year-old centerback with Kerala Blasters. Came out of nowhere after okay performances in the I-League. Joined the Blasters in 2014 and has now become captain. 6 foot 2 inches, he is a good reader of plays, isnt afraid to get stuck in and tackle, and good at heading the ball away or in on corners for India. Weakness can be that he tends to be rash and is a walking yellow card.\n\n[**Sunil Chhetri**](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201806/12_0_0.png?kU1RHdHlAjNbmryKAa9_dp1l6XcHieBL): India\'s main man and arguably best player EVER. 34 years old but despite that, has 65 goals in 103 games, a lot of them coming in the last 4 years! Has played abroad in the United States and Portugal, he is India\'s posterboy and still does well in the Indian Super League for Bengaluru. This season he has 5 goals in 11 matches. Physically very strong but agile as well. Technical ability is great and his finishing is out of this world\n\n[**Jeje Lalpekhlua**](https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/fiaa.jpg): Expected to be India\'s starting striker, the 27-year-old Mizo has done well since making his debut in 2011. Has 22 goals in 52 matches. Whether he will do well here is questioned right now as he isn\'t in the best form. This season for Chennaiyin in the Indian Super League, Lalpekhlua has not scored a single goal from 11 matches. Last season he managed 9 goals from 20 matches.\n\n[**Udanta Singh**](https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/06/udanta-759.jpg): The 22-year-old speedster is one of India\'s best young talents. Great dribbling skills, decent passer of the ball, and good off the ball, Udanta will be one to look out for at the Asian Cup. Will be relied upon for the counter. Weakness is his finishing.\n\n**Notable Mention**: Rowllin Borges and Anas Edathodika\n\n---\n\n#[](#icon-discuss-big) Points of Discussion\n\n- **The Coach: Stephen Constantine**: India\'s coach for the Asian Cup is Stephen Constantine. The Englishman will be coaching a side in the competition for the first time. He is credited with helping India improve drastically in the FIFA rankings. When he arrived, India were ranked 173. India is now 97. However, it can also be noted that he was India\'s coach during their horrendous World Cup qualification campaign, overseeing bad results such as a defeat to Guam. The players have also been reportedly vocal over their dislike of the coach, including Sunil Chhetri. Despite this, Constantine has helped India become a more cohesive unit and more organized than they were under the Dutchman, Wim Koevermans. He has also given opportunities to young players but has also be criticized for not selected all the best players and having favorites, many of which don\'t play for their club sides. Tactically, Constantine prefers either a 4-2-3-1 or 4-4-2. He has been noted of using route 1 football.\n\n- **Our Predictions**\n\n - /u/EnglishHooligan\n: Expected India to lose all 3 matches but hopefully not as badly as 2011. United Arab Emirates are tournament hosts and will be looking at this match as the match to go all out, at least in the first half. Thailand and Bahrain will also look for 3 points against us as the strategy will be whoever doesn\'t get 3 points against India would be knocked-out. Honestly, not upset if we lose all 3 games. Losing them would mean our coach would be sacked. Still won\'t be rooting for defeat.\n\n - /u/konoha_ka_ladka\n: We are the weakest team in the group no doubt. So expecting us to finish last. But luck has been on our side recently and good sides haven\'t been able to finish inspite of creating plenty of chances against us, case in point 0-0 draw with China. Hence a hoping for a positive result vs Thailand or Bahrain.\n\n - /u/nishitd\n: Feeling optimistic and expect India to pull off a draw against Bahrain and/or Thailand and somehow make it to that "best third-placed team"\n\n---'<br />Author: 'konoha_ka_ladka'  id: 'acu0tx'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/acu0tx/profile_of_the_indian_football_team_participating/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The deindustrialisation of India by the British and the myth of a stagnant pre Industrial society'<br />Body: 'Note - This is purely about history and understanding history better, do not attribute political motives to this post.\n\nI have oft seen observations (both on Reddit and on other forms of social media)  that the Industrial revolution flowed thusly,\n\n* There was this sudden period of enlightenment and scientific progress\n* The above resulted in spectacular advances in automation and mechanisation\n* This then enabled the colonial powers to produce products of outstanding quality, and most importantly volumes and thus overwhelmed the colonies in manufacturing.\n\n\nThis theory, while logical, is simplistic in the extreme and precludes a lot of factors, some of which I will touch upon in brief.\n\n* Technological Advancements - Despite what the narrative states, for nearly 2,000 years, the cotton producing countries, chief amongst these being India, were at the cutting edge of innovating and refining cotton growing, refining and production techniques. This tech from India flowed both East &amp; West (China and the Islamic countries) from whence on it flowed to Europe by the 16th century. Venice took a lot of the techniques from the Islamic Empires, and set up the first Cotton manufacturing units sometime in the 16th century. Yet, the demand for European cottons paled in front of the vastly more refined, superior quality Indian cottons and this was to be the case till the early 1800\'s. Quite a few key innovations, right from domesticating wild cotton to the Cotton Gin (discovered as early as 500 AD), though we attribute this almost entirely to Eli Whitney (he did mechanise the Gin) to horizontal looms which vastly increased the output of the loom all were invented in India and over time diffused around the world. It is important to note that you had centres of production in South America, West Africa and India running parallely (but isolated from one another), but the quality and quantity of Indian cotton exports was far ahead of the smaller production outputs of South American and African cotton.\n\n* What this meant was, for 2,000 years, Indian cotton exports dominated the global cotton trade, right from the Romans to Egyptians down to the 18th century European colonial powers (nascent colonial powers), they purchased Indian cotton at a great cost to their balance of payments.\n\nThings all started to change in the 17th century. What changed?\n\n* The colonial powers had by now gained access to cotton growing regions in the Americas. This enabled them to start procuring raw cotton and setting up their own nascent manufacturing industries.\n\n* The quality AND quantity of these industries paled in comparison to Indian cotton exports, and this new material, which was flooding European shores, also angered the Wool industry and this powerful force started to lobby to prevent the growing encroachment of Indian cotton.\n\n* This lead to some early protectionist barriers which range from the ludicrous (mandating by law that corpses needed to be wrapped in wool if being buried in the Church of England) to the funny (Scottish Kilts had to be made out of 13 yards of wool) to the outright ban on Indian Calico Imports by [1721](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_Acts). The outright ban was first preceeded by a softer ban which mandated that white cotton (unprinted) could be imported, but when the British Cotton industry still failed to match up to the volumes and quality of Indian imports, it lead to a full ban. The British were also by then able to open up markets (for both raw material and finished goods) in the Americas, and hence started the policy of Import and Export substitution.\n\n* Which brings us to the topic of Indian Imports into Europe and Britain- This is absolutely stark and belies the whole myth surrounding the benign and science driven "Industrial Revolution". In 1725, India exported 821,000 pieces of textiles to Britain and another 400,000 to Europe (mostly France). That is 1.2 Mn pieces of textile Imports. By 1820, the 1.2 Mn pieces of exports had fallen to 304 pieces. A decline of some 99.08%.  \n\n* This is made even starker when you compare the raw cotton consumed in Britain in the same time period. In 1730 Britain consumed 1.7 Million pounds of raw cotton, yet by 1840 it was consuming 540 Million pounds.\n\nThe policy of Import and Export substitution (reversing the process of importing finished goods to importing raw material at cheap rates thanks to controlling the sources of production and exporting finished products to a captive market - chiefly India) was now paying off.\n\nHow did the Colonial Powers, chiefly the British pull this off?\n\nSimple, through a process called War Capitalism, starting the 15th century and ending in the mid 17th century, these powers gained access to the three levers of production - Labour, Land and Credit.\n\nNow interestingly, the great "enlightenment" which was basically a society based on laws which is held as a cornerstone of the development of the modern European states was only for the "inside" - that is, only for the mother countries. Those on the "outside"- that is, the occupied powers, there was no rule of law and this is exemplified by how the slave trade worked.\n\nOne of the three pillars as I have mentioned was labour. Now, labour was exceedingly expensive in the Colonial countries, and hence they turned to slave labour to produce the raw cotton needed to churn the giant factories. The payment for the slaves was made in...Indian cotton, and at the height of the slave trade (when an estimated 3-4 million of slaves were being traded), it was not money, but Indian cotton exports into Europe that was acting as the global currency to procure said slaves, who were then shipped across to the Americas where they were then worked, quite literally to the death to increase cotton output to feed the factories back in the mother countries, who then used this competitive advantage (and the tariffs and regulatory system to choke Indian Cotton) to slowly overwhelm the native Indian system of manufacturing.\n\n* This also brought in great socio economic changes. The Indian producer, for millenia held great control on the levers of production (a Marxian dream), he decided who to sell to, at what rates and the volumes he sold. By 1800 though, British East India Company agents were overwhelming this system with brute force, including setting up of monitors in production centres (a loose slave labour type system) and took away the power of the Indian producer. By 1820, the Indian cotton centres, and consequently the earning potential of the labour had collapsed entirely.\n\nAs you can see above, the root of the "industrial revolution" and the great divergence lay not in some scientific superiority and human enlightenment, but on sheer repression - tariffs, gunboat diplomacy , cutting access to markets and creating artificial scarcity, slave labour that powered the giant cotton farms and finally outright colonial exploitation. Sure, great advances were made in the mid 1800\'s in manufacturing tech, but even till 1800 (when the "revolution" was supposedly well underway) the European nations could not even compete, nay even touch Indian Cotton production in any aspect and needed huge state intervention and slavery to even begin to compete.\n\nI would also wish to touch upon the hoary old "what about the railways" argument and prove that the railways were built at a prohibitive cost and were seen as a solid moneyspinner for investors from Britain.\n\nThis worked almost like a protection racket - the British Imperial Govt attracted capital by offering a fixed return of 5% (sometimes more) on the funds invested. Now, when the Govt fell short of funds to pay back the investors (as they often did), the money was still paid back, but from Indian taxes, not from the Railway companies. By 1870, a good 20% of the British bourses came from railway infra shares.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that the cost of the railway construction was twice that of what it cost to build them in Canada or Australia (given the same terrain).\n\n[It is interesting to note some of the observations](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=LxKUSZkEyoIC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=a+mile+of+indian+railway+constructed+by+the+british+cost+more+than+in+australia+or+canada&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l2lI54B1fq&amp;sig=gFcpGFCDjG8Y-2YLIygfqxbbq6g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiiv83ov6bLAhVDuxQKHa4ZBPgQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20mile%20of%20indian%20railway%20constructed%20by%20the%20british%20cost%20more%20than%20in%20australia%20or%20canada&amp;f=false) from that period,\n\n&gt;&gt; The guarantee system has not served any purpose whatsoever, the undertakers of the railway are deprived of one of the greatest inducements of to economy, **they know that whatever blunders they make, those blunders will not prevent their getting full interest on their expenditure**.\n\n* William Thornton.\n\n&gt;&gt; All the money came from British Capitalists and so long as he was guaranteed five percent of the revenues it was immaterial to him if the funds he lent were thrown into the Hoogly or converted into brick and mortar.\n\n* William Masey, Finance Minister of the Raj. He also was the one who felt that the costs were exorbitant and twice that of what it would cost to make elsewhere.\n\nA commission report submitted to the House of Commons in 1872 established the following costs per mile,\n\n* India 18,000 pounds per mile,\n* Australia 12,000 pounds per mile,\n* Canada 8,000 pounds per mile.\n\nNow throw in the fact that all the equipment was imported from Britain (at a ruinous cost) and really, one begins to wonder, was the one supposed benefit of British rule even a benefit or was it just outright robbery under the guise of legitimate investments.\n\nSome of my key sources are,\n\n* Steven Beckert\'s Empire of Cotton.\n* Eric Hobsbam\'s \'Age of" trilogy,\n* [http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/papers/broadberry-gupta.pdf](http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/papers/broadberry-gupta.pdf) for the data,\n* Traditional Industry in Colonial India by Tirthankar Roy,\n* Foreign Trade and Commerce in Ancient India by P C Prasad,\n\n'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'aclayv'<br />Score:52<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/aclayv/the_deindustrialisation_of_india_by_the_british/</li>

Please review your new Mod Candidates!'<br />Body: "\nWe would like to start by thanking all 19,000 of our subscribers for joining the community and bringing us to where we are today. This is a huge milestone for us, and we are grateful for the support and contributions of our users.\n\n\n\nWe recently posted an announcement that we'd be recruiting new mods. After a while, we had a google form up and to our surprise, a lot of you guys had applied. Usually, we get 3-4 applications, but this time we got over 20 legitimate applicants. We thank all the applicants for the enthusiasm and support.\n\n\n\nWe went through all the applications, reviewed user profiles, discussed and finalized a few people. In this round of recruitment, we would be having 3 Mod candidates (a.k.a Junior Mods) and 2 Interns (a.k.a Mod Interns). \n\n\n\nThe reason why we are expanding is that two of our mods recently retired, and two more will retire in the coming months. Amidst all this, we are going to expand the sub much further. All of this need more people to manage the activities and reach. Remember, modding is not their job, only a hobby. So, we can't ask for too much time.\n\n**Before we add them as mods, we want our community to review them.**\n\nIf selected,\n\n##Role:\n\nJunior Moderators (Total: 3)\n   - They would be having almost-full permissions, while having partial duties. Meaning, they would work along with existing mods in areas where the sub needs manpower in. \n\n  - They would be free to work on their own pet-projects for the sub and see how they go after review (We love intra-prenureship).\n\n  - Similar to existing mods, they'll pitch in to help with the ModQueue - but they will slowly ease into this.  \n\n  - Pick up updating of Wiki, Redesign, Schedules, Calendar, Outreach, etc. \n\n  - Co-operate with our CSS Team, Jury and Scheduled Discussions Team. \n\n2. Intern Moderators (Total: 2)\n\n - They would have limited permissions, but specific duties. \n\n - They would be trained, so that they become full mods after a while.\n\n - They too would learn the ropes of the ModQueue and community management. \n\n\n\nWhy this Split?\n\nAs mentioned above, we are looking at changes in our team, so we want things to go smoothly. While Interns have some notoriety, we feel they still need some sharpening at the edges. \n\nSecondly, having 5 new mods immediately would be difficult even for the existing mod team to divide tasks (Regular and new). So we want them to acclimatize in batches, while giving them ample time to do so. \n\n**Why this post?**\n\n**Here you can ask each of the 3 Mod candidates or all of them together questions on what you think is important as and for a mod.** \n\n\n\nOur Junior Mod Candidates:\n\n/u/Scype_crisis\n/u/deva_p\n/u/doors_1\nWe've two more interns who are relatively well-known users on Indiaverse, but would be introducing after an approx period of 2 weeks.\n\n\n\nRegards, \n\n/r/IndiaSpeaks Mod Team\n\n\n\n\n\n"<br />Author: 'Nervous_Wallaby'  id: 'acjzjy'<br />Score:27<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/acjzjy/namaste_everyone_please_review_your_new_mod/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Streetside Linguistics #9 dhR'<br />Body: '&gt; Word of the Day --&gt; Darius\n\nDarius, was an Iranian king, perhaps the most successful Iranian king ever. But Darius is a Greek pronounciation of Avestan name, Dara (दारा).\n\nDara (Darius) was the inspiration behind the namings of people like Dara Shikoh and Dara Singh. \n\nDara means "the one that holds", or just "holding ".\n\nDara as we mentioned above is an Avestan word, hence its Sanskrit counter-part is not so tough to guess, it is dhAra (धार). A word that is still popular in our languages. \n\nsutra-dhAra (सुत्रधार) --&gt; one who carries the thread (of story, play). \n\ngandeeva-dhArI (गाण्डीवधारी)--&gt; one who carries Gandeeva (the bow of Shiva) i.e. Arjuna.\n\nThe word dhAra, reminds us of its closer relative, dhara as in :\n\ndhanuH-dhara (धनुर्धर) --&gt; one who carries the bow (dhanu)  \n\n&gt; Root of the Day : dhR (धृ )\n\ndhR, basically, very basically, means to carry. \n\nHence, the verb dhara means to carry. I do not know why so many Kashmiri Pandits carry(dhara) the surname of dhara (धर). It is a possibility that the Islamic surname Dar (दार), was used as a proxy for dhara, just like Butt (बट), is used for Bhatt (भट्ट). Well that\'s the wrong turn of history.\n\nComing back to dhara. Dhara can mean a lot of things, because a lot of things indirectly "carry" something. \n\n* dhara (धर) --&gt; womb because it carries the child\n\n* dharA (धरा) --&gt; earth, well, because it carries everyone. It gives words like dharati and vasuMdhara. \n\n* dhara (धर ) --&gt; vein because it carries blood\n\n* dhArA  (धारा ) --&gt; a conduit, a stream. Stream could be of anything, it could be lineage, it could be of water, or sound. \n\n* dhara (धर) --&gt; to place it on something (Hindi). For ex : मै तेरे कान पे एक धर दूंगा (I will place one slap on your ear) \n\nAnd this is not all, much more complex and interesting words could come out of dhara. \n\n* dhAraNa (धारण)--&gt; to internalise something. In fact, dhAraNA (धारणा) is the second-last phase in ashtang Yoga, succeeded by the ultimate realization, i.e. samAdhi (समाधि)\n\nBut most interesting of all of these words is Dharma(धर्म ). Of course, there are countless meanings and interpretations of Dharma. \n\nBut basically, fundamentally, it means --&gt; something that you carry, something that you hold, as a human. \n\nSo, quite paradoxically, dharma is indeed personal and individualistic, but it means exactly the same for everyone. There could only be one dharma, the one dharma that is yours, at that moment, at that time. By virtue of being always in the moment, the dharma, is only one, and eternal. \n\nIn this way, I think that phrases like Sarva dharma (सर्व-धर्म), are oxymorons. And that the words like Sanatano dhammo, and Sanatan Dharma as Buddha and Krishna talked about are somewhat the only explanations of dharma, possible. \n\nDharma, hence, is one of the most astounding discoveries that human beings have ever made, perhaps the most important. \n\nIt is a pity that founders of our constituition used the word Dharma for religion, where they could have used saMpradAya, mata, pantha or darshana. Because, the traditional usage of the word religion, like dharma is somewhat that of different forms of worship and scriptural adherence, which dharma is clearly not. \n\nThe peak of this mis-translation was reached when secularism was translated as dharma-nirpeksha (धर्म-नि:पेक्ष), which means, indiffference to dharma. In this giant circus of nation-making, we managed to define a nation, indifferent to something which it cannot be indifferent to. And indeed, by propaganda and misguiding of thousand words, we were made proud of being dharma-nirpeksha. \nWe can definitely be proud of jaati-pantha-mata-smapradaya-nirpeksha, but dharma ?. What does that even mean ?\n\n&gt;Foreign words that come from the same root\n\nthronos --&gt; the Greek word for seat. It gave the way for the English word Throne. \n\nfirmus --&gt; the Latin word for steady. It gave the way for words like firm, firmament, confirm, farm, affirm. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nThanks for reading this episode. For more episodes check out the wiki. \n\nBecause a lot of friends have asked to elaborate on Indo-Iranian/European connections, I would make a meta post about it soon. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n'<br />Author: 'decoder007'  id: 'acgmmm'<br />Score:37<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/acgmmm/streetside_linguistics_9_dhr/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Two years of insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)'<br />Body: ' The Congress left behind the legacy of an anachronic system of resolving commercial insolvency. The Companies Act had a provision of winding up a company if it is unable to pay its debt. Additionally, the Congress Government had enacted the SICA in the decade of 1980s for rehabilitation of sick companies. This applied to companies whose net worth has become negative. The law proved to be an utter failure. Law carried out rehabilitation, several sick companies got a protective iron curtain against creditors. The Debt Recovery Tribunal was created to enable banks to recover every dues diligently. But these have not proved to be highly efficient mechanism for recovering debt. For non-corporate insolvencies the Provincial Insolvency Act was applicable. This was a rusted piece of legislation, ineffective and had faded away because of disuse.\n\n  \nThe NDA Government headed by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee has enacted the SARFAESI Law which proved to be much better than the earlier mechanism. In the year 2000, the NPAs had sky-rocketed into double digits. Both the SARFESI Law and the prudent interest rate management by the RBI helped in bringing the NPAs down. Subsequently, between 2008 to 2014, Banks lent indiscriminately. This lead to a very high percentage of NPAs which was highlighted by the Asset Quality Reviews of the RBI. This led to a prompt action by the Government. An Expert Committee was appointed, which submitted its Report in 2015 recommending the IBC. Immediately, a Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha and referred to a Joint Committee of Parliament. The Parliamentary Committee displayed its wisdom and submitted a report recommending some changes in the Legislation. The IBC was approved by both Houses of Parliament in May, 2016. This was the quickest Economic legislative change that I have seen being made by Parliament. The NCLT was immediately constituted, the Insolvency Bankruptcy Board of India was established and the regulations were framed. By the end of 2016 corporate insolvency cases were being received by the NCLT.\n\n# THE EXPERIENCE SO FAR\n\n  \nThe early harvest through the IBC process has been extremely satisfactory. It has changed the debtor - creditor relationship. The creditor no longer chases the debtor. In fact, it is otherwise. Upon constitution of the NCLT and the implementation of IBC its functionality had revealed the need for improvements in the law. Two legislative intervention since then have taken place.  \nThe NCLT has become a trusted forum of high credibility. Those who drive the companies to insolvency, exit from management. The selection of new management has been an honest and transparent process. There has been no political or Governmental interference in the cases. The recoveries of monies parked in insolvent companies has taken place through three methods : firstly, after the introduction of Section 29(A) such companies are paying up in anticipation of not crossing red line and being referred to NCLT. As a result, the banks have started receiving monies from the potential debtors who pay in anticipation of the default. The defaulters know well that once they get into IBC they will surely be out of management because of Section 29(A). Secondly, once a petition of the creditor is filed before the NCLT many debtors have been paying at the pre-admission stage so that the declaration of insolvency does not take place. Thirdly, many major insolvency cases have already been resolved and many are on the way of resolving. Those which cannot be resolved move towards liquidation and the banks are receiving the liquidation value.   \nThe functioning of NCLT and the Tribunal has led to a large number of cases being filed. The NCLT is over-crowded, its capacity is now being further enhanced. Realizing the urgency, the Supreme Court has pronounced several judgements expeditiously, laying down the Law on the new Legislative provisions. The law declared by the Supreme Court will go a long way in interpretation and clarifying the ambiguity, if any. This will expedite the process further in coming days.   \n\n\n# THE DATA\n\nSo far 1322 cases have been admitted by NCLT. 4452 cases have been disposed at pre-admission stage and 66 have been resolved after adjudication. 260 cases have been ordered for liquidation. In 66 resolution cases, realization by creditors was around Rs. 80,000 crores. As per NCLT database, in 4452 cases disposed at pre-admission stage, the amount apparently settled was around Rs 2.02 lakh crores. Some of the big 12 cases such as Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd. and Essar Steel India Ltd. are in advanced stages of resolution and are likely to be resolved in this financial year in which realization is expected to be around Rs 70,000 crores. Increase in conversion of NPAs into standard accounts and decline in new accounts falling in NPA category show a definite improvement in the lending and borrowing behaviour.'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'ac5bjz'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ac5bjz/two_years_of_insolvency_and_bankruptcy_code_ibc/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Streetside Linguistics #8 Svar'<br />Body: '&gt; Word of the Day - Algorithm\n\nAlgorithm, as we all know is a set of logical rules that are used to perform a task. It is a common word for people involved in scientific fields. The word Al-gorithm comes from the name of a 9th century polymath known as Al-Khwārizmī. Quite, interestingly, the most popular work of Al-Khwarizmi was attributed to Indians. His work translated to latin was, *Algoritmi de numero Indorum*, which meant "Algoritmi on the numbers of the Indians". In fact, a lot of his books attributed India (as Hind). \n\nOne could say that, Al Khwarizmi, the gifted polymath was single-handedly responsible for transferring mathematics and astronomy from east to west. Something, that later bloomed as renaissance. \n\nInterestingly, al Khwarizmi came from a region called Khwarezm ( aka Chorasmia in Greek). Generally, *Khvar* in Persian means sunshine or sun and *Zam* means land. Khwarezm is an oasis region to the south of Aral Sea. Some say it is a cradle of civilization just like Mesopotamia and Indus Valley. \n\n&gt; Root of the day - Svar (स्वर्)\n\nSvar means that which shines. The basic sense of this root is of light and sunshine. \n\nHowever, in Avestan, which is one of the oldest language of Aryans, Svar is pronounced as Hvar. \n\nIn Persian, Hvar is pronounced as Khwar or Khur.\n\nDid we notice the transition from sva --&gt; hva --&gt; khwa ? \n\nLet us understand these transitions from the table below :\n\nSanskrit | Avestan | Persian | Meaning\n:-: | :-: | :-: | :-:\nsva | hva | khwa | ----\n\nsvar | hvar | khur | shining light\n\n--- | hvar kshaeta | Khurshid | light ruling i.e Sun \n\nSusravas (a Rg Vedic sage) (सुश्रवस्)  | Husravah (an Iranian sage king) | Khosrow | su + sravas :: good + hearing aka famous\n\nsva-daH | x^va dha | Khuda  | (self-defined, self-given aka Ahura Mazda aka God ) \n\nsva (स्व) | x^va | khud | self\n\nThus from the same root comes the word, Khorasan (land of the rising Sun, or East). Terrorist groups based in Syria name eastern regions such as Iran as Khorasan. \n\n&gt; Indic words that come out of svar \n\n* surya (सूर्य) --&gt; sun \n\n* svarna (स्वर्ण ) --&gt;  gold\n\n* svarga (स्वर्ग) --&gt; going to light, heaven \n\n* svar (स्व:) --&gt; sky, where planets and constellations reside, it comes in the beginning of Gayatri Mantri as Om Bhu Bhuva **Svah**\n\n&gt; Foreign words that belong to the same root \n\n* sol --&gt; sun in Latin\n\n*sol family --&gt; solar, solstice, south, insolation\n\n* helios --&gt; sun in Greek\n\n* helios family --&gt; perihelion, apehelion, **helium**, \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext Episode  --&gt;  Sindhu (will elaborate on the famous "Sa" --&gt; "Ha" transition)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor previous episodes [check out the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/wiki/streetside_linguistics)\n\n\n\n\n '<br />Author: 'decoder007'  id: 'abv536'<br />Score:29<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/abv536/streetside_linguistics_8_svar/</li>

      <li>Title::: "[Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] New Year's Edition: How will the world change in 2019?"<br />Body: "Welcome to a special New Year's edition of the Geopolitics thread! Here, you can discuss the biggest issues affecting our world - from politics to films to sports - as well as the minor things that aren't really affecting anybody! The discussion can be from anywhere in the world and does *not* have to be related to India. For this special edition, I thought we'd trying looking ahead to what the top stories *could* be in 2019. Here's a sampling to get the discussion started:\n\n# Top stories from India's neighbourhood in 2019\n\n**1. What will the IMF do to CPEC?**\n\nAs Imran Khan's government continues to negotiate with the IMF, the future of CPEC hangs in the balance. In 2019, Pakistan is expected to [have an outflow of about $800 mn](https://tribune.com.pk/story/1874661/2-pakistan-pay-china-40-billion-20-years/) to China in the form of interest and dividend payments. The IMF has the power to compel Pakistan to curtail many projects in return for a bailout, but has in the past looked the other way as Pakistan reneged on many of its promises. Will things change in 2019, or will China ultimately bailout Pakistan... in return for something else?\n\n**2. Is democracy dead in Bangladesh?**\n\nSheikh Hasina's Awami League won a landslide election victory in the country's 11th general elections. The opposition alliance claims that the election was a farce and has demanded re-polling across the country under a neutral caretaker government. The opposition's most prominent face and former PM Khaleda Zia is languishing in jail, whole Hasina won such a landslide in her own constituency of Gopalganj that the other candidates hardly got a few hundred votes each! Many will ask - has Bangladesh effectively become a one-party state, going through the motions of elections but without any real opposition to Hasina's rule? In 2019, based on how her new government handles the country, we might just find out.\n\n**3. Will the Afghan War come to an end?**\n\nThe war in Afghanistan has been going on in fits and bursts for the better part of the last 40 years (starting with the Soviet invasion of that country). US President Donald Trump is becoming increasingly weary and wants to pull out, even as his country and others have started directly talking to the Taliban to negotiate some sort of arrangement. The Afghan War might very well come to an end in 2019 if US forces fully withdraw, most likely leaving a Taliban-dominated government in its place. The only countries that the Taliban refuses to do business with? The current Afghan government itself, and India. Events in 2019 could be a pivotal moment for the security situation in the northwestern part of the subcontinent.\n\n# Top stories from the world in 2019\n\n**1. To Brexit or not to Brexit?**\n\nBy March 2019, Britain will leave the European Union unless it withdraws its application to do so. The country is in turmoil as Prime Minister Theresa May is unable to harness the numbers needed to get parliamentary approval for a deal with the EU for a so-called soft Brexit, making it increasingly likely that a hard Brexit will take place, which would have serious consequences for the country. A hard Brexit may also be the beginning of the end of the United Kingdom itself, as Northern Ireland reels under border controls with the Irish Republic, and Scotland becomes even more disenchanted with England (but nobody cares about Wales). Could 2019 mark the beginning of a New Britain, or the beginning of the end of the United Kingdom?\n\n**2. Will Trump be impeached?**\n\nIn 2019, the opposition Democrats will take control of the US House of Representatives, presenting the most serious challenge to President Donald Trump so far. One faction of the Democrats is determined to investigate the hell out of Trump's business dealings, while a large part of the party hopes that Robert Muller's investigation of his supposed collusion with the Russians indicts the President. There is growing clamour to impeach Trump for a number of reasons. Because the Republicans still control the Senate, Trump will not be removed from office, as the US Constitution requires approval of both houses for that. But an impeachment motion that passes the House can seriously undermine Trump and may become the defining moment of his term. Will the Democrats have their way in 2019 as they begin lining up candidates to challenge Trump in 2020?\n\n**3. Will the world's economy fall into a recession?**\n\nThis might seem like an odd thing to ask, but the risks are real. Even as the US and China have called a temporary truce in their trade war, the threat of a relapse is very much alive. With the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates again in 2018, liquidity might begin to dry up in 2019. At the same time, OPEC is working tirelessly to raise oil prices, and as Prince Salman of Saudi Arabia continues to be increasingly isolated in the West, the Saudis will need more revenue to shore up their finances as well as to keep fighting the Yemen War if the US withdraws from it. If the world is hit by an El Nino next year, there could be a serious dent in economic growth. Which countries will be badly affected and which could survive?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from these, there are many other things to look forward to in 2019. Brazil's new right-wing President will take charge, and he has promised to shake up the country; Ukraine will become increasingly weary of Russia; the final battle against ISIS will determine the future of Syria; England will host the Cricket World Cup; and of course, the world's biggest election in history will decide the next Prime Minister of India.\n\nShare your predictions for 2019!\n\nवसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्"<br />Author: 'icecoolsushobhan'  id: 'abckvq'<br />Score:41<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/abckvq/biweekly_geopolitics_thread_new_years_edition_how/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Streetside Linguistics #7 Mega Episode'<br />Body: '&gt; I have almost completed 6 months on this sub. It was awesome. Thanks everyone for the interaction, Happy New Year. On this occasion, I would like to share a part of my original study.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&gt; Word of the Day - Zoroaster\n\nZoroaster is a Greek pronounciation of the Avestan name, Zarathustra. The same famed prophet, who found the religion Mazdayasnism, aka Zoroastrianism aka Parsi Dharma. His name Zarathustra, has many contending meanings and explanations. Not something new for people of such high importance. But the most convincing explanation of them is Zairit + Ushtra :: Golden Camel. Zarathustra may also mean, possessor of camels. \n\nUshtra (उष्ट्र) is the word for camel in both Sanskrit and Avestan. Right.\n\nZairit, however, means golden. \n\n&gt; Root of the Day - Hari (हरि)\n\nHarit (हरित) means green, right ? Hariyali (हरियाली) means greenery, Hara means green. These are common Hindi/Indian words. \n\nBut there is a twist to this story, Harit originally means yellow. In fact, turmeric, the popular spice, which is known for its absolute yellowness, was called Haridra (हरिद्रा), and is now called Haldi (हल्दी )\n\nSo, Harit also meant yellow. Ok, then.\n\nWait. There is another twist to this story. The word Hiranya, means golden. In fact, the moment one turns to Avestan ( an old Iranic language), Harit becomes Zarit, because the initiating sound "ha" is often pronounced as "zha" in Avestan. And Zairit means golden. \n\nAnd we all do in fact know that Zar means gold. Thanks to the Persian loan words in our culture.\n\nZareen means beautiful as gold. \n\nIn fact, the golden work on Indian Saris is called Zari work aka *Zari ka kaam* \n\nZariwala is the Gujarati word for Sunaar (gold merchant).\n\nSeeing these examples it is obvious that Harit, Hari and Hiranya are connected and could also means gold or golden. Ok, then.\n\nIn these series of twists, the final twist is that the word Hari, could also mean tawny brown. And the evidence for it is in many archaic words. The most popular of them being HariNa (हरिण ), which means deer, which we now call HiraNa (हिरण) \n\nHence, the conclusion of all the above mess is that somehow, the word Hari could mean yellow, green, tawny brown and gold, all of them. One word for all of them.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe above discovery is an interesting one, because it tells us that, in earlier times, we didn\'t have the luxury of infinite words as we have now. We didn\'t have hexcodes and rgba\'s to fetch a color out of the canvas of the world. All we had were very few words and the world, just too full of colors. \n\nFor red, there was no pink, magenta, rosy red, falana red, dhimkana red and so on. We just had red.\n\nFor blue, there was no navy blue, crystal blue, sky blue and dark blue. In fact for many cultures there was no blue. For India, somehow, they had a plant which they used to call "Neel" (and the European cultures, for their lack of words, used to call it "Indigo"). \n\nNow, it might come to some of us, that green, tawny, yellow obviously seem pretty different, why we had single word for these three colors ? \n\nThe answer to this is in the color wheel. In reality, these three colors are actually pretty close on the [color wheel](https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/). So, our ancestors, were simply optimizing. Passing off similar colors, by the same name. \n\nAnd this is not unique to these color sets, many cultures in the world, do not have separate words for blue and green. In fact, the concept and word of "blue" is absent for most of European history. And perhaps, even Arabic. Following, is an extract from a poem by Sufi poet, Hafez.\n\n&gt;I behold the green expanse of the sky and the sickle of the new moon: I was reminded both of my life\'s field and of the time of reaping. \n \n[Anthropologists have a very interesting perspective on this phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue%E2%80%93green_distinction_in_language). They say that rarity of blue in the natural world made most of the Arabic and European world to ignore blue for a long time, and for most of the time, they passed off saying blue as "green".\n\nBut some cultures, develop distinctness, to the level of shades, for example - Russians have two names for blue, light blue is "goluboy”, and dark blue is known as “siniy". \n\nWhat forces us to create separate words, and what causes us to optimize, is actually a quite tough question to answer. And the money is still out there to grab. \n\nOn one hand we have nature. Obviously, it is nature and the environment around us that guides our choices of words and colors. \n\nOn the other hand we have culture. Sometimes our culture causes us to increase or diminish the number of words. A very interesting example of this in not in colors, but in breeds of mangoes where in Northern India barely 4 decades back, people would often call the mango by the name of its breed. For us, it was Chausa, Langda and so on.\n\nEventually, words are like tools. And these tools are used to carve meaning out of the environment we live in, and the environment also manages to fashion these tools in the process.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&gt; More Indic words that come out of Hari\n\nHarit Kranti (हरित क्रान्ति )---&gt; Green revolution \n\nHiranyagarbha (हिरण्यगर्भ) ---&gt; Golden Womb ( the universal egg, from which everything arose )\n\n&gt; More Persian words that come out of Zairi\n\nZarparAn --&gt; zar + parAn means golden leaves aka Zafraan aka Saffron.\n\n&gt; Foreign words that come out of the same root \n\nZlatan ---&gt; golden in Swedish, also Ibahimovic. \n\nZoloto --&gt; golden in Russian, also Zoloto Valves.\n\nChlorine --&gt; From Greek Khloros, meaning yellow-green. \n\nKholos --&gt; Greek word for Bile, gives us the word Choleric, a kind of temperament in classics. Excess of Choleric is Cholera. Kholos also gives us cholestrol.\n\nGold --&gt; The basic word for Gold.\n\nGold family --&gt;  gild, glad, glance, glare, glass, glaze, glazier, gleam, glee, glib, glide, glimmer, glimpse, glint, glissade, glisten, glister, glitch, glitter, glitzy, gloaming, gloat, gloss \n\nYellow --&gt; The basic word for Yellow.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor previous episodes, [check out this wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/wiki/streetside_linguistics)\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'<br />Author: 'decoder007'  id: 'abbjgf'<br />Score:40<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/abbjgf/streetside_linguistics_7_mega_episode/</li>

And these madarchod doctors when asked still say it is not due to pranayam. Madarchod, toh kya pranayam karte hi chale jata hai automatically?\n\nFirst hand, I can say, pranayam has cured our auto-immune shit, my fathers asthma, BP and thyroid, other than that I wouldn't say if it would work definitely because I haven't tested it on diseases I don't have. But considering how it worked for what ramdev claimed, it should work for other problems as well since pranayam doesn't target any specific process.\n\nFeeling prod of patanjali and ancient indians.\n\nJai hind bc."<br />Author: 'iBuildMechaGame'  id: 'abasse'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/abasse/ramdev_should_be_given_bharat_ratna/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Notes on India's Nuclear Strategy"<br />Body: 'This was posted by Abhijan Rej, a military and foreign policy wonk at a think tank to [his Twitter timeline](https://twitter.com/AbhijnanRej/status/1079399321689219072). It\'s very illuminating, and I thought it would be worth sharing here.\n\n________\n\nFollowing @NarangVipin’s excellent ‘discovery’ of a new article by former SFC [Strategic Forces Command, the military component of India\'s Nuclear Command Authority] commander BS Nagal, I got myself a copy. This is the clearest manifesto by far for a new Indian nuclear startegy by a senior fmr official. Following is a thread on the key pts along with a few comments.\n\n* 1/ The article is in a new (2019) volume — “Military Strategy for India in the 21st Century” — published though the Centre for Land Warfare Studies (an MoD sponsored think-tank), ed. Lt. Gen. AK Singh And Nagal. All but two of the articles in that volume are by ex-mil people.\n\n* 2/ (p. 197) Assertion: credible min deterrence (CMD) “does not relate, or amount to” MAD. Implication: Is CMD more compatible with flexible response?\n\n* 3/ (p. 198 as well as p. 217) Asserts that ambiguity is “an important determinant of deterrence.” Recommends that IND does not state position on nuclear weapons use. This is eerily familiar. Fmr def min in the current gov also said this:\nManohar Parrikar on nuclear weapons: Why say we won’t use it first\n"People say India has not first used nuclear concept.I should say that I\'m a responsible nuclear power&amp;I\'ll not use it irresponsibly" Parrikar said.\nhttps://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/manohar-parrikar-on-nuclear-weapons-why-say-we-wont-use-it-first/443183/\n\n* 4/ (p. 201) India’s NFU posture is tied both to the size of the adversary’s arsenal as well as ability to absorb first use. Implication: posture will change as adversary (esp. PAK) arsenal size grows and/or perceived IND vulnerability to a nuke strike. First is already happening.\n\n* 5/ (p. 202) First strike (no pun intended): NFU prevents counterforce first strike. MUCH more about this later.\n\n* 6/ (p. 203) PRC is the main threat to India, and follows up with a long description of PRC capabilities. But the main argument (later) is that PAK will force a rethinking of IND nuke strat. Problem with having two distinct ‘effective’ doctrines (for PAK and PRC) not addresssed.\n\n* 7/ (p. 205) Complete disbelief in PRC NFU. Which is just as well given the amount of caveats Beijing insists on sticking to it. BUT, sentiments reciprocal, I am told by knowledgable folks.\n\n* 8/ (p. 207) PRC conventional precision strike capabilities against nuclear C2 and assets should be factored in Indian “countermeasures”. Again (by implication), anxiety about IND second-strike capabilities.\n\n* 9/ (p. 211) PAK nuke behaviour “irresponsible” and “symptomatic of brinksmanship”. While agreeing with the first, don’t see much evidence of “brinksmanship” (in the classical sense) — even during Kargil. Words have meaning, folks!\n\n* 10/ (p. 212) If PAK was to have an operational nuke-weapon capable sub, then its (sea-based, presumably) nukes cant remain demated. Q: What about IND and SSBN INS Arihant? Was the recent Arihant deterrence patrol with *mated* K15 missiles?\nINS Arihant returned yesterday from 20-day deterrent patrol\nA deterrent patrol is one where an SSBN with a full complement of nuclear-tipped missiles sails towards its intended area of deployment within range of an adversary\'s targets.\nhttps://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/ins-arihant-returned-yesterday-from-20-day-deterrent-patrol-1383188-2018-11-05\n\n* 11/ (p. 216) NFU may contribute to stability in peacetime crisis but not in war. Implication: different doctrines? Reminds me (imprecisely!) of a reexamination of Snyder’s det/def argument. So, NFU in peace but all bets off when kinetic action starts?\nCould India\'s Bold Nuclear War Plan Survive a Clash with Pakistan?\nMassive retaliation in India\'s nuclear doctrine fails to serve the objective of nuclear deterrence.\nhttps://nationalinterest.org/feature/could-indias-bold-nuclear-war-plan-survive-clash-pakistan-18625\n\n* 12/ (p. 217) An “ambiguity” posture includes NFU, preemption, LOW, LOL. I have argued that ambiguity is built into IND’s extant (NFU) doctrine — and is good:\nIndia is Not Changing its Policy on No First Use of Nuclear Weapons\nEverything you know about South Asian pink flamingos is false, a prominent nuclear-weapons expert has recently warned. Pakistan\'s expanding nuclear\nhttps://warontherocks.com/2017/03/india-is-not-changing-its-policy-on-no-first-use-of-nuclear-weapons/\nFor pushback, see\nThe Debate Over Indian Nuclear Strategy is Heating Up\nMost debates on South Asian security strategy tend to not attract much attention amongst U.S. policymakers except during the occasional crisis. Warnings\nhttps://warontherocks.com/2017/04/the-debate-over-indian-nuclear-strategy-is-heating-up/\n\n* 13/ (p. 217, contd.) Recommended IND first-use posture as a safeguard for IND strategic forces. Implication: Is Nagal worried about survivability of (retaliatory) IND nuke forces in event of adversary first-strike?\n\n* 14/ (p. 217, contd., imp page!) Need to change CMD to *credible deterrence*. Funny story, that: dhqxnzzajv69c.cloudfront.net/wp-content/upl… (pp. 20-24). Thanks, @shashj for writing this with me and @nktpnd for pointing this out in the first place. And then they say Twitter is useless :)\n\n* 15/ (p. 218) Piece-de-resistance (@NarangVipin’s tweet yesterday): NFU to CF posture dictated by an “unstable” and “unpredictable” enemy (also known as PAK). But, again, what about PRC and the dilemmas of *two* effective doctrines?\n\n* 16/ (pp. 218–219) Recommends ‘extended’ triad following an (old) US Nuclear Posture Review — which includes infrastructure in sensors, C2, comms, data processors, etc. Hmm... reminds me of the following piece:\nBehind a Mysterious Budget Increase, the National Security Need for \'Make-In-India\' Chips\nThe National Security Council Secretariat, headed by top spy Ajit Doval, may have received a staggering 311% increase in funds this year to tackle issues at the intersection of cybersecurity and nucl…\nhttps://thewire.in/security/nscs-doval-budget-increase\n\n* 17/ (p. 220) India should have MIRVs. This has broad resonance: see Basrur and Sankaran’s contribution to the 2016 Stimson report: stimson.org/sites/default/…\n\n* 18/ (p. 221) IND nuke strategy should have hypersonics. So how far *are* we from that? Some bragging...\nBrahMos missile will breach mach 7 barrier in next decade: Top official\nOver the years, the basic missile system has been modified in a such a way that it can be fitted on various platforms, including ships, submarines, the Sukhoi-30 aircraft as well as on land, for laun…\nhttps://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/brahmos-missile-will-breach-mach-7-barrier-in-next-decade-top-official/articleshow/63960670.cms\n\n* 19/ Thus ends Nagal’s paper.

But nearly all of these rather popular texts are in Sanskrit, likely due to the elevated linguistic interest of Sanskrit being Indo-European in origin in the 20th century.\n\nThe Sangam is the only part of Tamil literature I’m acquainted with, although vaguely. I understand that it’s not one text but a period in history where many texts were composed. Looking further, there’s Tirukurral, which I’m not sure how widespread it is, like the Veda or the Gita.\n\nI’d also like to ask whether Southerners, Tamils, in particular, consider the Vedas to be “their” holy text or not. It may seem like an absurd question but I’ve noticed a lot of criticism from many Tamils towards Sanskrit, not in person, but on online communities. I’d guess it depends upon caste too, since Tamil Brahmins are Sanskritized than their other counterparts.\n\n'<br />Author: 'SGautam64'  id: 'aajt3u'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/aajt3u/popular_south_indian_classical_literary_works/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Streetside Linguistics #6'<br />Body: '&gt;Word of the day - Boman\n\nBoman is a popular Parsi name (ref. Boman Irani). \n\nThe older version of Boman is Bahman. Bahman is name of a deity, one of the six divine angels of Zoroastrian religion. \n\nOne of the sultanates of the Deccan, declared themselves Bahmani, the descendants of Bahman. They were primarily Shiite, and did as much atrocities as the usual sultanates of the North did. \n\nThe oldest version of Bahman, however, is Vohu Manah. The same Vohu Manah when read in Sanskrit, becomes Vasu Manas ( वसु मानस) \n\nNow, Vohu Manah or Bahman, is often translated literally as "Good Memory". Because Vasu means good, and Manas means memory. \n\nVasu doesn\'t mean good directly, it actually means "dwelled" or "populated", because it carries the root vas, which means \'to dwell\'.\n\nVohu Manah was appended to one of the Persian Kings as a title, which the Greeks wrote as Mnemon (as in Mnemonics). \n\nGreek| Avestan | Sanskrit | Translation \n:-: | :-: | :-: | :-:\nArtaxerxes II Mnemon | Arta KshAya arsha II Vohu Manah |  Rta Kshaya Rsha II Vasu Manas (ऋत क्षय ऋष् द्वितीय वसु मानस)  | True Shah(king) among Men II Good Memory   \n\n\nPretty straightforward story right ? \n\nBut, here is a twist. Vasu-Manas is name of a very old Rig-Vedic King, just like Pratardana, Pururavas and Manu. Vasu-Manas is one of the most frequently referred personalities of Vedas. \n\nSo, is the Vohu Manah the Persian deity, just "good memory" or is it in the memory of a Rig-Vedic king ? \n\nAnd we are not stating this possibility just because the names are same. One of the other, six divine angels is Asha Vahishtha (Asha Vasishtha). So, the argument that Vasu-Manas, the king, have influenced the naming of six-angels of Zoroastrian religion is pretty significant. \n\nPlease tell if you want me to do more such Iranic-Indic crossovers.\n\n&gt; Root of the Day - man (मन्)\n\nman means to think and imagine, or to percieve and sense.\n\n&gt; Indic Words that come out of man \n\n* manasu (మనసు) --&gt; mind (telugu) \n\n* manadhil (மனதில்) --&gt; mind (tamil) [ mana mana mental manadhil ] \n\n* mana (मन) --&gt; mind \n\n* manas (मानस) --&gt;  memory  ( one of the four parts of the complete mental structure, **mano**-buddhi-ahankara-chitta  ) \n\n* mantra (मन्त्र) --&gt; device of the mind, something repeated in the mind.\n\n* manaska (मनस्क) --&gt; attention , shunya-manaska --&gt; zero attention \n\n* mata (मत) --&gt; opinion\n\n* mAna (मान) --&gt; respect\n\n* abhimAna (अभिमान) --&gt; arrogance\n\n* saM-mAna (सम्मान) --&gt; treating respectfully\n\n* anumAna (अनुमान)  --&gt; estimation \n\n* mAn-na (मानना ) --&gt;  to agree upon (मैने तुम्हारी बात मान ली )\n\n* ava-mAn-na (अवमानना) --&gt; to disagree, disobey [ official Hindi word for **contempt of court** ] \n\n* muni (मुनि) --&gt; seer\n\n* maun (मौन) --&gt; who keep silence, silence\n\n* manu (मनु) --&gt; one who thinks\n\n* mAnava (मानव) --&gt; who comes from manu, human\n\n&gt; Foreign words that come from the same root \n\n* The Ment family --&gt; mentor, memento, mental, dementors, dementia, mention, men\n\n* The mnes family --&gt; mnemonic, amnesty,\n\n* The mat/man family --&gt; automatic, mania, mandarin \n\n* The mus/mons family --&gt; demonstrate, museum, music\n\n* Meaning --&gt;  meaning \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n'<br />Author: 'decoder007'  id: 'aa92rq'<br />Score:50<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/aa92rq/streetside_linguistics_6/</li>

Now, when this lawsuit took place these brands like Micromax, Lava, Intex tried their best to block dissemination of this information in popular domain.\n\n If you go and search for "Standard Essential Patents" "Ericsson V. Micromax" you will find information enough for you to know the reason for the failure of these brands. Basically, these patents were based on EU Patent Laws (which has broader jurisdiction and application, even in India, as widened by our Supreme Court), for which one is obliged to get licence for certain Patents which are Standard and Essential for you to operate into that particular business. In the case of smartphones these patents were related to "Bandwidth Connection" and blah blah without which you can\'t even operate a normal mobile phone. Micromax, Lava and Intex found it too convenient to not get a license for these patents and kept running their business like dorks, eventually faced a lawsuit from Ericsson and conclusively lost it. \n\nThey had to pay heavy damages (compensation) and were ordered for Temporary injunction (where you have to shut your business down temporarily) by Supreme court of India. This led to drastic plunge in the share prices, and brought these companies on the verge of bankruptcy. Chinese Manufacturers like BBK Electronics (Parent Company of OnePlus, Oppo and Vivo) and Xiaomi took advantage of this opportunity by intense marketing and insurgence into the Indian markets. No doubt they are making better products and have better services, but back in late 2015 it was nearly impossible to beat these Indian brands and capture their markets. Those patent lawsuits made it a cake walk for Chinese Manufacturers.\ufeff\n\nhttps://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/ericsson-sues-micromax-for-patent-infringement-claims-about-rs-100-crore-in-damages/articleshow/19204307.cms\n[i found good copy pasta]'<br />Author: 'Son_Of_Earth'  id: 'a9r9fo'<br />Score:46<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a9r9fo/ever_wondered_what_happened_to_indian_phone/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Deglorifying the Aryans'<br />Body: 'The subject of Aryan Invasion of India is a Pandora’s box. The reason being the glorification of the Aryan tribes by the Europeans, who then used this to justify the British occupation of India. The idea was this, Africa and the Americas were full of savage tribes so the white man civilised them, the Middle East was being the Middle East, consumed by conflicts since Islam, so the white man came and civilized them, the Indians have rich literature, and lots of history that pre date the Indian European arrival to India, so the natural course of action was to somehow tie all those achievements to Europeans in a way that completely delegitimises India’s own claim over their history. Exploring ancient Indian texts, it is seen that many of these people addressed themselves with the honorific “Arya” or “Aryan”. With the similarities observed between Sanskrit and Latin, it is postulated that the languages have a common ancestor. So they concluded that all of Indian accomplishments were done by these Aryans who are supposedly the cousins of modern day Europeans, who mixed over time with the “inferior” Dravidians creating a mixed race that we see in India today. And that the purest of these “Aryans” are blue eyed blonde haired... Germans and Swedes. (which is funny because now from genetic data we know that Europeans also are mixed)\n\nAnd this is not me twisting their arguments this is literally what they said. I put forward three examples,\n\nH.P Lovecraft’s letter says the following, \n“Wherever superior races have absorbed large doses of inferior blood, the results have been tragic. Egypt is one case—&amp; India presents a still more loathsome extreme. The Aryans in India were too late in establishing their colour-based caste system, so that today the culture of the Hindoo is probably the most thoroughly repulsive on our planet.”\n\nThen we have the French anthropologist explaining us the racial history of India,\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-asian-studies/article/glory-of-ancient-india-stems-from-her-aryan-blood-french-anthropologists-construct-the-racial-history-of-india-for-the-world/6C87D9F50B387BDFDBBC28D15567FC64 \n“The Glory of Ancient India stems from her Aryan blood”\n\nAnd finally, “The Passing of the Great Race” — which theorises that all of the lands from India to Western Europe were inhabited by Nordics.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Passing_of_the_Great_Race\n\nBasically, “WE WUZ KANGZ N SHEIT — European version”.\n\nNow obviously the reaction in India at the time was of denial. The similarity between Sanskrit and Latin is not debateable, they are similar languages likely having a common ancestor. This is the reason why many Indian nationalists deny the existence of the Indo-Europeans, because when it was first proposed it was used to delegitmise the history of India and her people. Even today there’s some taboo associated with the word “Dravidian” in many Indian political circles.\n\nLet me not only illustrate that whatever India has accomplished was done by her mixed and not pure “Aryan” peoples, but also that her glory was not because of her Aryan blood, rather it was because of her Dravidian blood.\n\nFull disclosure, I’m not a Tamil or even a South Indian. But all of us have native South Asian ancestry, as far as Afghanistan.\n\nWe know that majority of Indian history occurs after 320 BCE, the Mauryan conquest of the Nanda Empire. Megasthenes, the Greek ambassador to India describes Chandragupta as dark, so it seems that the ruling elite of India was darker than the average Greek. And let’s not forget this predates the Golden Age of India, by nearly 700 years. Aryabhatta and Brahmagupta and Varamhira and many many Indian scholars, astronomers and mathematicians that came after that era clearly wouldn’t have been from some Proto-European race that disappeared in India from mixing.\n\nLet’s also talk about the fact that majority of the Hindu scriptures are likely Aryo-Dravidian in origin. Take the Mahabharata or the Gita, as an example, Krishna clearly does not represent an Aryan, he is described as having blue-black skin, yet not only was he Arya, but the incarnation of God himself, assuming we can interpret mythology, if Krishna existed, he was likely of Dravidian origin. And you can see when these texts are dated, much much later after the Aryan migration into India. Anyways, so basically this boils down to the fact that most Hindu texts are a mixture between Aryan culture and Dravidian culture. So any European claim can be neglected. Except one. The Vedas, which are the original Indo-European texts.\n\nBasically, the Indo-Europeans were barbarians. Like the Mongols, they did not have a high civilisation of their own. Instead, they conquered and pillaged, in an era where other cultures were in their stages of infancy. However, their military superiority was unmatchable at that point in history — due to their domestication of the horse, which allowed them to occupy vast lands thus spreading their culture and language.\n\nFirst, let’s talk about Sati, a brutal barbaric “Aryan” practice that was first opposed by the Mughals (ironically, the Muslims were the ones who were fighting for women’s rights here which is laughable), and condemned by the Sikh faith, well as Hindu reformers like Raja Ram Mohan Roy and later criminalized by both the British and the post-independence Indian government, likely has Indo-European origins. Then, let’s also talk about a practice called Ashvamedha, Sanskrit for “horse sacrifice”. Horses have a special place in Indian culture. The horse is seen as the symbol for the sun. Now, to the practice of Asvhamedha. Again it also has Indo-European origins. This seems to be a carryover from the Andronovo culture. Basically, a horse is summoned by a king and left to roam across the country for a year. Usually, the king’s ministers and princes would follow the horse as it roams around, crossing borders into another kingdom. If the King of the opposing kingdom attacked or killed the horse, then that would be considered as an act of declaring war on the king whose horse has been attacked. If the horse attacks or acts aggressive in another kingdom, the King would consider it a divine invitation from God to attack and annex that kingdom. After a year, the horse would be taken back to the king, if alive. He is tied then to a gilded chariot, and the verses from Rig Veda, and Yajur Veda (RV – 1.6.1,2, YV – 23.5.6) are recited. The horse is taken to the water to be cleaned. The Chief Queen is instructed to decorate the horse with jewellery and ghee (butter), the horse is then taken to a fire place, where it is put to a stake and then slaughtered, by strangling it to death as the priests chant the “Rudri Path” from the Rig Veda. The last practice of the Ashvamedha was carried out by the House of the Kachavas of Jaipur, by Emperor Jai Singh II in 1699. The practice thankfully faded away, much due to the condemnation it received both from more later scriptures. \n\nSo much for civilized, higher “Aryan” culture, strangling horses and burning wives! \n\nBut now the question is what is Dravidian culture anyway? The purest Dravidian culture we have today is of the Tamils. But what is the ancestor of the Tamil language? If we go without speculation, the ancestor of Tamil is Proto-Tamil whose ancestor is Proto-Dravidian, all of whom are localized to the Southern part of the Indian subcontinent. If you look at Tamil Hinduism today, it is not based off the Vedas, but rather various Tamil scriptures that were composed in the 4th century BCE, which are collectively called the Sangam, which include Thirukkural, Thevaram and the Divya Prabandham, sort of like their version of the Vedas. But that’s as far as we can get in history without speculation. But, there is a chance that Proto-Dravidian might have origins in what was perhaps once the greatest civilization in the world, destroyed into oblivion and now lingers in mystery, the Indus Valley.\n\nFirst, let’s start with the assumption that the Aryan Invasion (and not migration) Theory is true. This is confirmed by the Vedas themselves. Remember my point about the Vedas. The Vedas pre-date Aryo-Dravidian mixing. This is why there is no caste system in the Vedas. Instead of caste division we see the division between Aryans and Dasyus. Now, of course, it is likely that the “Aryans” weren’t a homogenous group but rather a combination of different races that got together with a common culture, but one thing is certain, all of them hated the Dasyus. The Vedas describe war between several Aryan tribes killing and fighting each other like seen in the saga of the Dasrajana Yuddha (Battle of the Ten Kings) that occurs in Rig Veda VII, 18, 33, and 83, but we see a unanimous contempt amongst all Aryan tribes against these Dasyus, who are likely the original inhabitants of the Indus Valley, let’s quote some verses!\n\n“Through fear of thee the dark-coloured inhabitants fled, not waiting for battle, when, O Agni (Goddess of Fire) burning brightly for Puru (an Aryan tribe), and destroying the cities, thou didst shine.” - RV, VII.5.3\n\nNote that Agni doesn’t mean some special fire Goddess. She is fire itself. The act refers to the Aryan tribe of Puru burning down the cities of these Dasyus. Also, cities? What cities did they mean? Oh, wait, let’s see another verse:\n\n“This one great power of thine our eyes have witnessed, wherewith thou slewest Varasikha\'s children,\nWhen by the force of thy descending thunder, at the mere solund, their boldest was demolished.\nIn aid of Abhyavartin Cayamana, Indra destroyed the seed of Varasikha.\nAt Hariyupiya he smote the vanguard of the Vrcivans, and the rear fled frighted.” - Rig Veda, 6, XXVIII, 4-7\n\nFirstly, the last verse makes it clear where the battle is being fought, Hariyupiya is the Vedic name for the Indus site of Harappa, a massive city complex that now lays in ruins. Also, we don’t exactly know who these Varasikha is supposed to be, but Vara in Sanskrit is another name for Asura, who are described as “dark skinned demons”. Sikha means head. So clearly this Varasikha of Hariyupiya wasn’t an Aryan. Indra slays the sons of the tribe of the Varasikha, obviously, Aryans wouldn’t call on their God to kill on of their own, especially somebody’s sons.\n\n“To him in might the Gods have ever yielded, to Indra in the tumult of the battle.\nWhen in his arms they laid the bolt, he slaughtered the Dasyus and cast down their forts of iron.” - Rig Veda, 2, XX, 8\n\nForts of Iron? This is the 14th century BC, there is no iron. India did not see the Iron Age until 400 BCE. Clearly they mean that these forts were very strong. If you’ve looked at Indus sites, you would notice that the one thing they did with perfection was building walls. The stone walls stand to this day.\n\n“Indra smote down, Agni consumed, O Indu, the Dasyus ere the noontide in the conflict.\nOf those who gladly sought a hard-won dwelling he cast down many a thousand with his arrow.” - Rig Veda, 4, XXVIII, 3\n\nI picked this verse, but there are many verses that mention that Indra slayed the Dasyus in the thousands. A thousand is too big for them to be just a bunch of cave dwellers. Indeed, the Indus settlements are said to have massive populations numbering around 40,000 in the case of Dholavira, an Indus site found in modern day Gujarat for example. \n\nLet’s quote one more text, but this is not the Vedas, but another Vedic-era text, the Taittirya Brahmana, which says: "The people to whom these ruined sites belonged, lacking posts, these many settlements, widely distributed, they, O Agni, having been expelled by thee, have emigrated to another land."\n\nSo, this text refers to ruined sites, which are widely distributed and many in number. Let’s not forget that one of the largest Indus sites is literally called Mohenjo-Daro, in Sindhi, an Indo-Aryan language, which literally translates to “Mound of the Dead”. Corpses have been found, in the middle of the city roads. The nature of death is uncertain, but it won’t be surprising if these people were killed by the invading Aryan tribes. Not all of them, of course. Some might have died by floods or natural causes. But we don’t exactly know. We will never know.\n\nI will quote Arthur Basham, an Indologist who wrote about the Indus Valley civilization,\n\n“The Indus cities fell to barbarians\nwho triumphed not only through\ngreater military prowess, but also be-\ncause they were equipped with better\nweapons, and had learnt to make full\nuse of the swift and terror-striking\nbeast of the steppes (i.e. the horse).”\n\nWhat is the point of all this? The point is that Aryans weren’t some sophisticated, ubermensch as they are portrayed. They didn’t have a civilization of their own, they were like the Mongols, nomads who destroyed whatever they came into contact with. Someone may ask, what about the Dravidians? Why didn’t they write their history of the Indus Valley? They didn’t because defeated people don’t write history. This is why the Indus script has been lost. Only after did they Proto-Dravidians forget their defeats through generations, were they able to start writing literature again, in their new language of Tamil. The Germans don’t write about the World Wars themselves, for the most part. Majority of WWII history we know is from the victors, the Americans and Russians. \n\nAryans were barbarians, the destroyer of a civilization that fell to them because it wasn’t as savage, not as experienced in warfare. The Indus people show no signs of war, they were a high civilisation for their time, they show literacy, trade, planning and urban construction but never war. \n\nMy post is not to defame the Aryans, but to see them as what they were — products of their time and location. Indeed, parts of our culture are inspired from them, and should be continued to do so provided they are free of harm to others. But, to say that were of a superior race who mixed with the inferior Dravidians is just nonsense. Majority of our history has been done by mixed peoples, who were our own ancestors, not some Proto-European race that decides to disappear at some convienient point in history. The decline of India was not a product of race mixing but rather of invasion, invasion from the armies of the Arabs, Turks, Persians and Mongols. We should view it as it is and ensure that the bloodshed inflicted upon our peoples during those times does not happen again.

      <li>Title::: "Delhi Can't Breathe: Why Do Indian City's Have the Most Polluted Air on the World?"<br />Body: " Every winter, the air of Delhi becomes an unbreathable morass. By some estimates, breathing one day of Delhi air when air quality is at it's worst is equivalent to smoking 44 cigarettes and the toxic air reduces life expectancy by approximately six years. The burden of air pollution falls especially hard on the elderly and infirm, and an entire generation is growing up breathing suffocating levels of pollution. According to the World Health Organization, Delhi is the most highly polluted megacity in the world, and three of the ten most polluted cities in the world are in the neighborhood of Delhi. In today's podcast episode, I discuss the agricultural origins of air pollution in Delhi, I discuss the non-agricultural sources of pollution, and the environmental Kuznets curve.\n\nIn a previous podcast episode, I discussed the [environmental ramifications](https://wealthofnationspodcast.com/the-rice-of-wrath-how-obscure-british-land-law-and-free-electricity-created-economic-stagnation-and-environmental-disaster-in-punjab/) of the green revolution.\xa0 One that I did not discuss was the air pollution created by the burning of rice stubble after the harvest. Modern mechanized harvesters leave a large amount of rice straw that needs to cleared before the planting of the winter wheat crop. The cheapest and fastest method to clear the fields is to burn to rice straw,\xa0 and more than 2 million farmers burn 23 million tons of rice residue over 80,000 sq km of farmland resulting in massive fires. As much as a third of the air pollution comes from these fires. Although the government has banned burning rice residue, the state governments have struggled to do so. For one thing, government policies such as [enforced sowing](https://www.pressreader.com/india/the-times-of-india-new-delhi-edition/20181020/281663960984871) times and large subsidies of mechanized harvesters only encourages more burning. The government has provided subsidies of 80% for the purchase of mulchers that process rice, but it is a slower process that costs 3 times more than burning the fields after subsidies are taken into account.\n\nMany of the sources of air pollution come much closer to the city of Delhi. India is a major importer of Petroleum Coke, a by-product of refining heavy oils such as those produced in Canadian tar sands and emits twice as much sulfur as coal making it one of the most polluting sources of energy. The Indian government has announced a partial ban on the import of [petcoke](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/why-is-pet-coke-still-being-used-in-city-asks-hc/articleshow/67169254.cms) for 2018, although certain industries are exempt. Similarly, the rapid growth of diesel car use has had a strongly negative impact on air quality. The number of cars in Delhi has more than tripled over the last 8 years.\xa0 Moreover, between 2004 and 2014 the percent of cars sold in India that used diesel went up from one quarter of all cars to one half.\xa0 In 2014, the government of India phased diesel subsidies out, and demand for diesel cars has collapsed. Only 23% of all cars sold in 2018 are expected to be diesel. Finally, coal, the only natural resource India has ample reserves of, is a major contributor to air pollution. There are over a dozen thermal coal power plants surrounding Delhi and the largest Badarpur, had long been falsifying records on emissions to pass standards. The Badarpur powerplant, and many others are being [phased out](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/badarpur-thermal-plant-shut-for-good/articleshow/66228551.cms) to help reduce levels of air pollution.\n\nOne of the most important ideas for understanding air pollution in Delhi is the environmental Kuznets curve. The idea of the Kuznets curve is that levels of air pollution are lowest in low and high income countries, but much higher in middle income countries. India's rapid economic growth means it is rapidly approaching middle economic status has resulted in a massive increase in pollution. Many cities in the developed word such as Pittsburgh and Manchester were once famous for being the types of places where a person could go to work in a white shirt and come back in a gray one. It is a process we have seen in Beijing, which for a long time was considered the most polluted city in the world. However [since 2013](https://www.who.int/airpollution/data/cities/en/), Beijing and the Chinese national government has placed draconian measures to curb pollution. Coal use was cut by one half since 2013, and major construction and steel projects mothballed. Levels of air pollution are down by 20% since 2013. The experience of Beijing shows that the Kuznets curve isn't a natural inevitability, but the result of sustained changes in policy.\n\nSources:\n\n[Economic growth and\xa0**environmental**\xa0degradation: the\xa0**environmental Kuznets curve**\xa0and sustainable development ; \xa0\xa0](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305750X96000320)David Stern, Michael Common, Edward Barbier\n\n[Off Target: Status of Thermal Power Plants in Delhi NCR ; Centre for Science and Environment](http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/files/file/Off-Target---Status-of-Power-Stations-Report.pdf)"<br />Author: 'gnikivar2'  id: 'a9d2pr'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a9d2pr/delhi_cant_breathe_why_do_indian_citys_have_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Mughal Civil Wars part 1 - Brothers against Brothers'<br />Body: 'The Mughal Civil Wars – Part 1, the War between the 4 brothers.\n\n\nBefore we begin, as always there needs to be a lot of context setting. First, we must understand the succession laws and types and why this had the initially deeply destabilising impact it did (on the Mughal empire), followed by long stable rules. The traditional succession type, the one we are most familiar with would be, \n\n\n**Primogeniture**- This is when the eldest legitimate heir to the throne inherited the…throne. As with all systems, this had its merits and demerits. The single biggest merit was post succession stability. Everyone, nobles, commoners, relatives, all knew that the eldest male son of the current ruler would inherit and that was that. In Christian nations, this also had religious authority behind it as the kings / emperors ruled by divine right and this right flowed through from father to the eldest son. The biggest demerit was that this system was the exact opposite of a meritocracy, you could be epileptic, or a raging tyrant with anger management issues, an imbecile and it didn’t matter, the divine right was enshrined and it passed from father to eldest legit son. This though caused massive instability (at times) post the son taking over as stronger and worthier claimants to the throne made their own power plays. Dharmic kings and emperors almost always followed the Primogeniture system without exception.\n\n\n**Co-parcenary Inheritance** - Aka the gigantic cluster fuck. If primogeniture was missionary sex, CPI was a massive orgy involving vegetables, fruits, birds, animals all set to a wailing crescendo of violins and organ music culminating in everyone getting beheaded or trampled on by elephants. In this, which was as you can guess, the system followed by the Mughals, all legit sons of a dead emperor had an equal claim to the throne. So how did you actually come to power? Simple, you declared war on your brothers, uncles, and even father, murdered the whole lot of them and then took power as the undisputed ruler. \n\n\nYou had other systems such as the *Rota system of the Kievan Rus* (power passed from brother to 4th brother and then eldest son of the eldest brother-complex? Yeah I know), *Agnatic Seniority* (followed in Saudi Arabia, Younger brother of the King inherits), *feudal electorate* (Mongols, where the tribes elected a leader) or whatever the ancient Gaelic and Viking system was where the strongest man was challenged by the second strongest man to a 1-1 combat, and the guy who survived became king) and many many more, but that is not the topic of discussion, so we shall leave it aside.\n\n\nThe War Between the 4 brothers –\n\n\n“Here I am, with my neck being slowly sawed off when a couple of months ago, I was the heir to the throne of Hindustan…..want to know how I got here”?\n\n\nCue Record scratch and we flashback in time to 4 decades back. Dara Shikoh was the eldest son of Shah Jahan, he had 3 brothers, Shah Sujah, Aurangazeb and Murad Baksh, and some 4 other sisters (who survived). In all Mumtaz Mahal delivered some 15 kids and the rest died at some point of time in their childhood. \n\n\nShah Jahan himself was the product of a rebellion. The third child of the emperor, his eldest brother, Khusrau himself rebelled against Jahangir, defeated, and forced to watch as all his followers were impaled (a sharp stick was run through their bowels), and he himself partially blinded. A non entity, he was handed over to the tender mercies of Prince Khurram (Shah Jahan – his brother) who had him strangled. The second brother Parviz, suffered from the ailment that plagued the Mughals, excessive alcoholism. He drunk himself to an early grave, thus depriving Khurram of the chance to murder him. Aurangazeb though later on accused Shah Jahan (his father) of poisoning Parviz so we don’t know. The 4th son (3rd was Shah Jahan remember) was Prince Sharyar who was placed as a puppet king on the throne and on the orders of Shah Jahan, was murdered (he was emperor for 2 months or so) along with the other short term emperor, Prince Dawar (grandson of Jahangir) and some 4 other close male heirs.\n\n\nCueing Orgies and violin orchestras!\n\n\nSo as you can see, this was an excessively messy affair, to summarise the body counts, Shah Jahan had to murder some 5 close male members of his family (and the 10’s of thousands who died in the civil wars), and spoiler alert, Aurangazeb would murder 3 brothers and imprison his father (and never meet him for a decade before Shah Jahan died from loneliness and age).\n\n\nBack to the story at hand, Shah Jahan had seen upfront how destabilising a civil war could be (during this war, various other enemies of the Mughal state from the Persians to leaders of various regions fished in troubled waters) and wanted to avoid it at all costs. He chose Dara as his successor and as a contemporary source noted, he was to be “groomed for greatness”. Dara was quickly moved up the ranks and given increasingly more powerful ranks and greater responsibilities. At the same time to ensure Dara wasn’t lead astray by power hungry nobles into launching a civil war against his own father (as Shah Jahan and Jahangir had done) as also to protect him from assassination attempts, Shah Jahan always had Dara in the imperial court next to the Emperor himself, and refusing to let him out of his sight. His other sons also continued to climb up the ranks, but none was as favoured as Dara was. Dara also was the near ideal Emperor, a polymath, he personally translated the Gita and Upanishads into Persian. He personally engaged Christian traders (Europeans) and mercenaries to teach him the gospels and Christian theology, he was close friends with many a Sikh guru, he was a Sufi Muslim by heart and spent all his time in the intellectual and artistic pursuits.\n\n\nHe had two fatal flaws though!\n\n•\tHe was terrible in battle and war\n•\tHe was seen as a heretic and apostate by the Sunni hardliners of the Mughal court.\n\n\nThe Mughal Safvid War and the Deccan Wars of Shah Jahan clearly exposed his flaws while burnishing the credentials of Aurangazeb as one of the best generals of the Mughal dynasty across their history. While Aurangazeb even turned around difficult campaigns (like in the Deccan) and despite being purposely handicapped by Shah Jahan (on orders from Dara), gave a tough fight like in the Mughal Safvid war of 1649-53.  Aurangazeb was everything Dara was not. A Sunni hardliner to the core, while he had also been trained as a Mughal prince was (languages, Islamic theology, maths, sciences, military arts, sword fighting, archery etc), his core interests were in Sunni theology and warfare. \n\n\nDara using his position and access for years stymied his brothers. Oh, Aurangazeb won the wars in the Deccan? Order his leading general to redeploy to Kandhar with 10,000 horsemen (thus weakening him considerably). Oh, Aurangazeb issued an edict in the Deccan (which was rightfully his province), get the emperor to countermand it. Aurangazeb rationalised the tax structure and improved agricultural output in the Deccan? Force the emperor to increase his contributions to the treasury…..you get the drift. This caused massive hatred amongst all the brothers towards Dara and they loosely formed a pact that they would unite to defeat him.\n\n\nThe War –\n\n\nAll Mughal emperors till Aurangazeb had this daily ritual of Darshan. They would appear before a window in the palace for the nobles and commoners alike to see. On Oct 15th 1657, Shah Jahan did not appear at the window and would not appear at the window for 7 days. He had fallen gravely ill (possibly complications from a severe Urinary tract infection) and while he mustered enough energy to run the affairs of his empire, he refused to officially give up power to his son. This absence fanned rumours that the emperor was dead and it soon reached Aurangazeb in the Deccan, Shah Suja in Bengal and Murad Baksh in Gujarat. Knowing that this was the end game and possessed of a massive army and the full and bottomless resources of the Mughal treasury, Dara was clearly at an advantage. Aurangazeb though possessed the greatest treasure in any medieval Empire, battle hardened veterans who had his complete loyalty and a brilliant officer corps refined through decades of the hardest war the Mughals ever faced, the wars against the Shiite Bahamani kingdoms in the South. All the 4 princes promptly declared themselves emperor and prepared their armies to go to war.\n\n\nDara struck first, he dispatched a massive army to the East to deal with the nearest foe, Shah Suja. This army was lead by his two ablest generals, his son Suleyman Shikoh and Raja Jai Singh, a Rajput King. At Bahadurpur (near Varanasi) the forces of Shah Suja and Dara met in battle. \n\n\nBattle of Bahadurpur –\n\n\nSuja though he had the larger army, made the same fatal mistake Dara would soon make, he chose to go on the defensive. He built a strong camp on the Ganga, bought his naval river flotilla into it and waited for Raja Jai Singh and Sulyeman to make their move. By Jan 25th, 1658 first contact was made and both sides got into an artillery duel which went on for a couple of days. Every day Raja Jai Singh would form his troops up for battle, but Shah Suja refused and didn’t give battle. This went on for 2 weeks. Sulayman then worked out a stratagem, he had his men make a lot of noise and through the spies of the enemy camp, gave the misinformation that they were retreating and were short of supplies, packed up, formed a column and started to evacuate their own camp. On 14th February 1658, the so called retreat began. Suja’s men dropped their guard and the forces of Sulman and Raja Jai Singh swung around and attacked the fortified but now weakly defended camp.\n\n\nIt was a total rout. Suja himself took to his war elephant, and punched a hole through enemy lines and fled for his life. He quickly reached his boats, ordered the majority sunk and took to the few he left standing and fled along with his family. \n\n\nAt this point Sulaman wrote back to his father, announcing his grand victory and was told to pursue the now defeated foe. \n\n\nThe militarily inexperienced Dara had made the biggest mistake of the war. He had sent his two strongest generals and his strongest veteran army on a wild goose chase when his mortal foe and the strongest of the other 3 brothers was watching from the Deccan while two of his foes slaughtered each other. Aurangazeb quickly wrote to Murad (in Gujarat) and told him, if he became emperor, Murad will retain all his current holdings and will also get the lucrative Bengal added to it and Murad foolishly agreed (spoiler alert, Aurangazeb was lying his head off and this won’t end well for Murad). Suja meanwhile retreated deep into Bihar, gathering men as he went and reached Munger city. Here he built a strong fortified camp. As Munger was on a fordable part of the Ganga, Sulaman was stumped, either he made a frontal assault on a strong position while crossing in boats (thus leaving him vulnerable) or he looked for an alternative place to cross and this is what he did. By now though it was May, and the strongest of Dara’s armies along with its best leader (Raja Jai Singh) had spent the time from 16th February to 3rd May chasing down a totally weak and retreating Suja.\n\n\nOn 5th May, alarming news reach Sulaman and Jai Singh’s camp. Aurangzeb had struck camp in his Deccan holdfasts and was rapidly moving towards Agra. Murad Baksh had made his alliance with Aurangazeb open and was also rushing his forces to join up and jointly take the capital of Agra. All this while, Shah Jahan was furiously writing to Aurangazeb telling him to stand down, but Aurangazeb continued to maintain the story that the emperor was dead and was poisoned by Dara, and thus Dara, being guilty of regicide was not fit to rule.\n\n\nBattle of Dharmat.\n\n\nAt this point, Dara still had a large reserve army of some 30,000 infantry and 5,000 Rajput cavalry under the able but reckless Maharaj Jaswant Singh (no, no relation to the BJP leader). Aurangazeb had roughly 35,000 infantry and 5,000 cavalry (Murad had linked up with him) and so the forces were evenly matched. Battle formed, Jaswant Singh, no Raja Hemu foolishly decided that a frontal charge on Aurangazeb’s centre would end the battle even before it began, formed up his cavalry. On command, the 5,000 heavily armoured horse charged into rebel lines, but Aurangazeb who was more than a match for Jaswant Singh stood his ground, and introduced his artillery which absolutely slaughtered the Rajput cavalry. Charge of the light Brigade saw some 700 cavalry charge into Russian lines and some 500 or so died. Now imagine 5,000 cavalry charging into enemy lines….and getting slaughtered to the man / last horse! The Maharaja survived and was pardoned by Aurangazeb and promoted to a higher rank.\n\n\nCarnage reigned.\n\n\nAurangazeb then personally lead the cavalry on a flanking manoeuvre that hit the Imperial infantry from the flanks and it was game over. The Imperial army lost all its cavalry and half the infantry and routed from the field.\n\n\nThe field to Agra and the Imperial throne was now open.\n\n\nDara though had money and as Cicero said, “Money, the sinews of war” and using his limitless treasury quickly mustered a massive force of 100,000 Rajput and Mughal cavalry, 20,000 infantry and some 100 cannon serviced by European mercenaries. The Imperial army then formed a strong camp on the Chambal river crossings (though they outnumbered the Rebels by a factor of 4, Dara refused to go on the offensive). He was waiting for the 40,000 Infantry and 10,000 cavalry of Sulaiman and Raja Jai Singh to come back, and combined, outnumbering Aurangazeb by 1:6, crush him.\n\n\nAurangazeb though was a man of ceaseless energy, kinetic to the end, he in the summer heat force marched his men to another crossing some 30 km upstream, crossed it and before Dara even knew about it, was behind his defense line. Aurangazeb had gathered more men after his victory in Dharmat, but he lost 5,000 from thirst and exhaustion from this forced double time march, but it didn’t matter to him. Only victory and the throne did.\n\n\nDara again, instead of seizing the advantage and attacking a weak and tired rebel army, inexplicably chose to retreat. He made his last stand at Samugarh (just outside of Agra), as Aurangazeb had caught up with him by then. The imperial army had left behind men to guard the Chambal river crossing, and had with  him 80,000 troops in all while Aurangazeb had 40,000 and Murad contributed 10,000 of the finest Mughal cavalry (the Mughal Sowars), totalling upto 50,000 in all. The difference though was the artillery. Dara had chained his artillery pieces and had them ranged on some specific sites – this improved accuracy but sacrificed mobility, while Aurangazeb’s crafty general, Mir Jumla dispersed his arty across the front.\n\n\nAurangazeb who preferred horseback, gave it up, took his matchlock rifle and mounted his elephant while Dara did the same. \n\n\nDara commanded the centre, Raja Chattrasal (Rajput again) had the right screen, right flank by the Deccan general, Rustam Khan, and his left which had his component of Sowars (elitest of the elite Mughal cavalry) under an Uzbek general named Khalulilah Khan. Aurangazeb drew the centre, his left screen (basically this was cavalry that was mobile and guarded the flanks of the army) was Murad Baksh and his Sowars, the right was Mir Jumla and the Arty was under Quli Khan (do you see any Rajputs here? No you don’t, that is Aurangazeb for you).\n\n\nThe trumpets blew and the battle was joined when…..Khaluliah Khan promptly took his men and retreated from the field of battle leaving not only his screen but his left flank with a gaping hole (some sources say that he refused to co-operate with an infidel, Raja Chattrasal but later sources suggest he was bribed by Aurangazeb and defected to him). On the right flank of the imperial army, Murad Baksh (left of the rebel lines), Murad lead a ferocious charge, and held up the Imperial cavalry. Fearing that his right would get decimated and allow Aurangazeb to “turn his flank”, Dara ordered Rustam Khan to charge the flanks of Murad Baksh, break through and attack him from the rear.\n\n\nBad move….again! Mir Jumla’s stratagem of placing arty with grapeshot (aimed to destroy massed formations) in between his infantry worked. The charge of Rustam Khan was halted dead in its tracks, and Dara’s elite cavalry butchered even before they got in fighting range. Rustam Khan himself died within minutes, in the meantime, Murad had shot out the head of Chattrasal’s most effective general and second in command of the Rajputs, Prince Rautela. Within minutes, Dara’s forces were deprived of senior commanders.  Dara, not used to the pressures of command (every single military command he had held till now was an unmitigated disaster), must have panicked and ordered his centre to support his right flank. \n\n\nBad idea AGAIN!\n\n\nWhile his forces tried to reinforce the now routed centre, they were raked by artillery fire all the while. Dara, at the worst moment possible decided to personally lead a cavalry charge (he was not a coward and was brave to the point of being foolhardy), so dismounted his elephant, took down his banner and mounted a war horse. His forces saw an empty houdah, no banner and assumed that their Prince was dead and either routed or surrendered enmasse. \n\n\nIt was game over for Dara and the Imperial army.\n\n\nDara fled to Agra, took what money he could, gathered a band of some 2,000 soldiers, took his family and fled. His idea was to go to Persia, appeal to the Shah, gather another army and strike back. Aurangazeb though was no fool, he knew his foe was vanquished, and he took his armies to Agra. Shah Jahan, still an uncanny general, laid a trap for his son, he ordered the garrison in, burnt the villages nearby (to deny food and shelter) and thought he will force his son, Aurangazeb to fight a bitter and bloody city battle. Aurangazeb though was too smart to fall for such a stratagem, a series of water channels carried water into Agra, he simply cut these off and waited for his father to surrender. Within a week, he caved, Aurangazeb marched in and declared himself Emperor of Hindustan. Shah Jahan tried to make peace by giving to Aurangazeb a family sword said to belong to Timurlane, ALAMGIR (world bringer). Aurangazeb took the sword and then said no deal.\n\n\nSecure on the throne, Aurangazeb had to now deal with his enemies one by one.\n\n\nHis father, he banished to a small prison overlooking the Taj Mahal, he allotted him a few maids and a Sunni preacher to guide him on Islamic philosophy and a wife. He would never again meet Shah Jahan, till his death a decade or so hence. He would though send angry letters very often, castigating his father for choosing Dara and depriving him (Aurangazeb) of love and affection. On how he had let Infidels into the heart of the throne and family (Shah Jahan though was no Akbar, but he did consult and engage in discussions with everyone from Jesuit priests to Brahmins and had many Hindu ministers and advisers).\n\n\nMurad Baksh, the brave soldier, the one whose skills in battle mostly decided the battle of Samugarh was drugged (right after the battle), taken to a secret prison and kept there. Aurangazeb then convened a trial, accused him of having murdered a Muslim Ali Naqi (he was Shah Jahan’s man in Gujarat and Murad had him murdered when he declared himself emperor), sentenced to death and then beheaded iirc (don’t remember his mode of death)\n\n\nDara Shikoh, the supreme ruler of Hindustan after his father moved to Punjab and had gathered an army by then, Aurangazeb first moved to the East to deal with Jai Singh and Sulaiman Shikoh. He bribed the formidable Jai Singh – Jai Singh had had been fighting as a general from the time he was 15, and was an experienced and brilliant commander. He had fought the Safvids, he had fought in the Deccan, he had fought tribal armies, and finally with Dara. He had himself served under Aurangazeb in his attempt to take Kandahar so was known to him. Aurangazeb bribed him with the position of a Mansabdar and Jai Singh promptly defected (Dara had previously illtreated him, preferring to promote as Maharaja, Jaswant Singh). Isolated, Sulaiman surrendered and was taken prisoner. Dara meanwhile continued his retreat towards Persia. Jai Singh would be sent after the Maratha Lion, Shivaji, after Shivaji had defeated Shaista Khan AND Afzal Khan. Jai Singh succeeded where the others failed, and forced Shivaji to come to terms under the treaty of Purandar. Shivaji went to Agra to serve in Aurangazeb’s court when Jai Singh’s son, Ram Singh helped Shivaji to escape, this angered Aurangazeb so much that he imposed massive fines on Jai Singh and most probably also had him poisoned…..thus ending his service.\n\n\nDara meanwhile had retreated into Rajasthan by now where the governor of Gujarat opened up his treasury to him, allowing him to raise yet more men, but this time, in the battle of Deorai (Ajmer), he was outnumbered and his green troops were no match for the hard veterans of Aurangazeb and they were routed. Point to be noted though is that it was at Deorai that Dara finally came into his own, this was arguably the best generalship he had ever displayed (maybe he needed time and experience to learn, something his father had always denied him). \n\n\nIn Deorai, to neutralise the advantages in numbers in cavalry Aurangazeb possessed, he had ordered a massive series of trenches built, positioned canons strategically and waited for Aurangazeb to attack. His rear was protected by a hillock, so only a frontal assault would work. Left with no choice, Aurangazeb attacked and his men were killed in droves, and they couldn’t even reach the front lines of Dara’s army. For 3 days, every morning and afternoon they would charge….be destroyed and they would retreat for the day. On the 4th day, Raja Rajrup (a Kashmiri Rajput, or rather a Rajput ruler from Kashmir) , figured out that the hill had a difficult ascent but a path could be carved out it, and this would put them right behind (and inside) Dara’s lines. As a distraction, on the 4th evening, Aurangazeb mounted a cavalry assault, and slipped in expert mountaineer infantry men behind to climb the hill. The small engagement exploded into a full blown battle, and Aurangazeb’s men, already weakened by 3 days of ceaseless assault were wavering and had to push into a deep system of trenches. It looked as though Aurangazeb was going to finally lose when Rajrup’s 1,000 infantry reached the hill which was well behind Dara’s rear. Jai Singh and his fresh reserves (he had joined Aurangazeb by now) charged at the exact time Rajrup’s men raised their banners in the rear. Seeing the enemy in all directions, Dara’s green but brave men finally gave up the fight and took to flight. Dara himself finally called it a day and retreated towards Gujarat and his original plan of making his way towards Persia.\n\n\nHe fled again and reached Sindh. Here he sought the assistance of an old friend, an Afghan by the name Junaid Khan. Shah Jahan had issued the death sentence on Junaid at least two times before and Dara had used his powers to get these rescinded both times, so he was sure he had a friend in Khan. Khan promptly betrayed Dara and handed him over to Aurangazeb. Dara was paraded on a dirty old elephant through the streets of Agra and imprisoned in the palace, awaiting his fate. Aurangazeb convened a trial, had his judges declare him an apostate (the ring with the word Prabhu inscribed on it, which was worn by Dara was physically burnished to show how Dara was an Infidel), sentenced him to death. Dara was playing Shatranj with his second son when 4 of Aurangazeb’s personal body guards went to his room, strangled him and his son to their deaths, his head beheaded and his body given a paupers burial in Humayun’s tomb.\n\n\n\nLeft in the field now was Shah Suja. He had retreated to Bengal and began arming himself for another campaign. Aurangazeb wrote him a letter that said, “Like a true brother I shall not refuse you anything you desire, be it land or money.” But know how he had treated Murad and Dara, fat chance of Shah Suja believing Aurangazeb. His navy, now rebuilt, he had with him all the wealth of Bengal behind his back and he created from scratch an army of 25,000 cavalry, 120 cannons operated by the finest European mercenaries money could buy and his trump card, a massive force (pun unintended) of some 103 war elephants, all heavily armoured and having small cannons or teams of matchlock operators on its backs. Against this, Aurangazeb had a force of some 90,0000 cavalry and 30,000 infantry – while he heavily outnumbered Shah Suja, he had to leave his arty mostly behind and the elephants were an extremely potent force multiplier. Some exaggerated sources say Suja had some 10,000 elephants but this was a fanciful concoction.\n\n\nHere, Shuja played his own game of thrones, he had bribed Maharaja Jaswant Singh (yep, the same guy who lead the frontal charge at Dharmat, who then switched sides to Aurangazeb) and Jaswant Singh, the night before the battle simply upped and left, while slaughtering any other imperial soldiers they found on the way. With 30,000 cavalrymen now gone, the planned front was in shambles. However, Suja who could have attacked at this juncture, still didn’t believe Maharaja Jaswant Singh had actually accepted this ploy. He thought that it was Aurangazeb playing a trick and he stayed put in his camp. Aurangazeb was known for his treacherous stratagems and Suja was convinced this was a trap.\n\n\nNext day dawned and it was 60,000 cavalry vs the 25k of Shah Suja’s. Suja had positioned his elephant corps (all armoured and armed with iron chains in its trunk) in his right and hidden in a reverse slope. \n\n\nBattle joined, cavalry armies crashed into each other, Suja’s son, Buland Akhtar was a ferocious warrior and though outnumbered was decimating Imperial ranks. When he was weakening, Suja introduced his trump card, the elephants. In a wild charge they utterly broke Aurangazeb’s left wing entirely. Aurangazeb (or one of his generals) figured out that attacking the elephants only enraged them further, ordered the men to shoot at the mahouts, without the mahouts, the elephants either just ran away or were taken control of by Imperial Mahouts. Advantage Aurangazeb, he now pressed his reserves, while his matchlock men started focussing on the soldiers in the howdahs. Suja realised the dangers of being on an elephant now, and like Dara, came down onto a horse, his men thought he was dead, panicked and it was game over.\n\n\nHe fled to Burma where some forest tribesmen killed him. The Ahoms sensing the power vaccum moved into Bengal and started occupying Mughal territory. Aurangazeb sent Mir Jumla 2 in an invasion of Assam and that ladies and gentlemen is another story entirely for another day.\n\n\nFor now, Aurangazeb was secure in the throne, and would begin his own reign of terror and relentless expansion that would see the Mughal empire reach its territorial peak, but so weakened it was by his wars that within 50 years after his death, it would completely collapse, paving the way eventually for the rise of the British.'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'a93v60'<br />Score:34<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a93v60/the_mughal_civil_wars_part_1_brothers_against/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Great battles of India. The second battle of Panipat'<br />Body: 'The Second Battle of Panipat is one of the more fascinating battles from a military tactics pov. It was fought between one of India’s best military minds (top 5 all time) Hemu Chandra and another very capable general, Bairam Khan. It was a constant battle of absorbing the enemies’ stratagem and devising new stratagem to counter it.\n\nThe battle that could have potentially changed the future of India no Mughals, very strong Hindu leader in Delhi as the emperor, a very strong Hindu south Indian dynasty – Vijayanagara was lost by Hemu thanks to a chance misfortune of war. One stray arrow changed the course of the battle and all Indian history to come.\n\nBackground\n\nNorth India (in this context, all of North India, Gujarat, Rajsthan, Bangladesh and Pakistan) was in turmoil, the Mughals under the weak Humayun had been thrown out by a Pashtun warlord named Sher Shah Suri. While Sher Shah was a dynamic ruler (and one of the more progressive secular rulers) his successors were a weak quibbling lot. After his death the dynasty collapsed in a fratricidal war. Without going into a lot of details (this is scope for an entire write up by itself), Jalal “Islam Shah” Suri who was the second in line of succession was chosen over his elder brother (and the heir presumptive) Mohd Adil Khan. Civil war ensued which Islam Shah won, but he in turn died very early into his regime. This left a power vacuum with a 12 year old Emperor holding power nominally but in reality the power was held by a coterie of his nobles. Into this vacuum stepped in Mohd Adil Shah (the nephew of Sher Shah himself), poisoned the child emperor and took over the reins of power. His rule was in turn challenged by his brother in law and the governor of Bengal who rose in rebellion. Mohd Adil Shah at this time appointed Hemu Chandra as his Army commander, Hemu destroyed all opposition and chased out Ibrahim to a non-descript town in Orissa. The Son of the Bengal governor then took up the mantle of the rebellion and in a battle killed Mohd Adil Shah.\n\nThe power vacuum was now a literal blackhole, into this stepped one of India’s greatest generals, Hemu Vikramaditya Chandra. According to Fazl’s Akbarnama, Hemu was undefeated in 20 battles, enemies would flee upon sighting his banner. The only battle he lost was one that he had almost won, but a chance arrow struck his eye and he fell unconscious and was captured. The only battle he lost was the battle in which he died. To paraphrase Fazl in his Akbarnama, “Hemu was so mighty that he achieved deeds which no other mortal could even think of”.\n\nHemu\n\nHis origins are very cloudy. The only thing that is clear is he belonged to a poor Brahmin family from Rajasthan. Akbarnama says that his father was involved in the Saltpetre (used in gunpowder) trade while other later sources say his father was a poor Brahmin priest. Again it gets murky after this, one source says that he offered his services to a local Modi (a person who supplied soldier to various armies – a Mercenary if you will). Somehow he came into contact with Islam Shah (the short lived emperor of the Suri dynasty) and impressed him with his abilities so much that Islam Shah made Hemu the head of his logistics ministry, he was then made the head of Islam Shahs Markets and Produce ministry (Sher Shah centralized all trade, and introduced standard measures) and quickly rose to become chief of his espionage services. In this time period he also convinced the Sultan to shift his capital to Gwalior as he felt Delhi was not defensible.\n\nIn the civil war that followed Islam Shahs death, Hemu chose the winning horse and offered his services to Adil Shah who on the threat of the Bengal Governor (Ibrahim Shah) made him chief of his army. Hemu won many quick victories against superior forces and established himself as the king maker upon whose authority Adil Shah was allowed to continue his reign. Upon Adil Shah’s death, Hemu crowned himself Emperor. Just when he was settling down, trouble brewed on his Western Frontiers. While he was busy putting down the rebellion in Bengal the Mughal forces, Humayun with the help of the Shah of Persia had reconquered Delhi and vast parts of North Western India, Humayun then promptly died- some say he was assassinated by Bairam Khan (ancient Indian conspiracy theory?), but the generally accepted theory is that he fell to his death after tripping on his robe.\n\nNow we have another 13 year old King – Jalal-ud-din Muhammad, also known as Akbar Shanshah in power, but this time around he had a very strong and loyal regent by the name of Bairam Khan. Bairam Khan quickly mobilized the nobles and marched on a Suri remnant in Gujarat by the name Sikandar Shah Suri leaving a general named Tardi Beg in charge of Delhi (and his empire while Akbar was away on campaign).\n\nHemu’s tactic &amp; Innovations\n\nHemu was a very visionary leader, he saw the value of a robust supply chain which allowed his army great mobility and ensured that the local populace was spared from robbery and depredation. He used a chain of supply depots (Forts held by garrisons) to feed his army. This ensured he could bring to the war a very strong army. According to Akbarnama, Delhi had a massive famine during this period, yet Hemu could comfortably feed his army which was very Elephant heavy using his supply base in Bengal. He like Napoleon later relied extensively on mobility and attacking the enemy when they least expected it in a place they least expected it. He also again very similar to Napoleon, relied on artillery. A keen student of past battles &amp; wars, he quickly must have realized that Babur won his victories only because of two factors, • Horse Archers • Superior Artillery Using Portugese traders and arms dealers he equipped his army with the latest European Artillery which outmatched the Persian artillery of the Mughal army. Horse archers he could not source as they came from the steppes and the Mughals dominated the trade in steppe mercenaries. He however to counter these came up with an innovation – Musket &amp; Bow armed war elephants. Using their superior height and armour, they could act as a spectacular armored tank.\n\nTactical Innovation\n\nHe innovated a new tactic which helped counter the increased mobility (via horse archers) of the Mughal armies – in a tactic eerily similar (though the tactically the opposite) to one used by Hannibal the Great in the Battle of Cannae, he had a very flexible flank which allowed him to separate the strong enemy centre from their flank protection. He would push in his strong Elephant army into the centre at just the right time to break the strong but isolated enemy centre.\n\nHemu Tactics 101\n\nAs explained in my previous great battles write up, the armies of that time lined up facing one other. The Centre was the strongest, and the battle was usually decided in the flanks. The objective of the army was to break the flanks and attack the army from 2 directions (frontally and from the side), to pressure the centre, surround it and attack it from 4 directions. In the battle of Cannae for instance, Hannibal kept bending his weak centre using a feigned retreat (of sorts), forcing the Roman centre to get lured into the Crescent and at the right time his strong flanks surrounded the Romans and destroyed them.\n\nHemu (very uniquely in the annals of military history) used a feigned and controlled retreat…on the FLANKS! He weakened his wings, and on the enemy assaulting it, he would slowly pull them back. This would mean that the enemy flanks would start overextending depriving the centre of its protection. At the right time, he himself would lead his Elephant army in a charge on the enemy centre shattering it completely. This was an unprecedented tactic as it needed close cooperation between units and a resounding faith in their commander.\n\nWhat was more intestesting is that it played into the Mughal classic tactic of Tauqama which was invented by Babur. Tauqama was the classic stratagem of enveloping the enemy flanks and destroying it from the sides.\n\nBattle of Delhi – Hemu 1, Akbar 0\n\nWith Bairam &amp; Akbar away in the East, Hemu as was his signature style chose to strike first. Moving fast, he attacked Delhi which was under the command of Tardi Beg. Using the tactics I described above, Hemu lured Tardi beg into over extending his flanks, and launched an unstoppable attack on Beg’s centre using some 5,000 Horses &amp; 500 war Elephants. His centre disintegrated, Beg fled the field and Hemu quickly occupied Delhi and crowned himself Emperor of India.\n\nOn hearing this news, the Mughal nobles wanted to flee to Kabul, Bairam however had a couple of them beheaded for cowardice, had Tardi Beg the Governor of Delhi tortured and then beheaded for his incompetence, rallied the army with an inspiring speech and marched on Delhi. After his coronation, Hemu moved towards Bairam and the stage was set for the grand denouncement. While Bairam used fear to drive his soldiers, Hemu showered largesse, granted promotions and land grants to his troops and motivated them with promise of greater rewards.\n\nFirst Mistake- Akbar finds his opening\n\nHemu made the first flaw in his career and this was almost fatal. As I had explained earlier, he liked to move very fast and his all cavalry + elephant army could indeed move very fast. To aid this, he had sent his artillery much ahead of his full army, he assigned only a small body of troops to guard this vital arm.\n\nThe Mughals, who used a long range recon patrol called the Harawal-I-Mankula (like the Brits created in WW2 – the LRDP) under Lal Khan who were ranging well ahead of the Mughal army looking to pick off the vanguard of Hemu’s army spotted the Artillery column. They pounced on this weak force and destroyed it taking large number of guns as a prize. A major blow, but given the balance of forces Hemu still held the upper hand and he decided to give battle outside Panipat.\n\nOut Hemu-Hemu, Bairam Khan’s tactical innovations\n\nBairam Khan, no mean leader himself had studied Hemu’s campaigns and planned his deployments in a unique way. Aside from the Vanguard (already seen under Lal Khan) a strong corps was placed between the centre and the Vanguard (so they had two centres). The flanks were strengthened by cavalry archers to maintain mobility (and rush back to aid the centre if needed) and a ditch was dug between the Centre and the advance centre unit to prevent Hemu’s Elephant Corps from striking the centre.\n\nThe Battle\n\nThe battle was on, Bairam Khan took to the offensive (though vastly outnumbered), his flanks tried the Tauqama tactic of using the flanks to rush Hemu’s centre, but his Elephants stood firm. He ordered his flanks to start their withdrawal, and into this gap the Mughal flanks followed, he had despite Bairam Khan’s counter planning managed to create a gap between the Mughal centre and it’s flanks. Into this gap, he pushed in his massively strong offensive corps…the ditch barely stopped them.\n\nReaching the Centre, the Elephant corps and the following Cavalry started to rout the Mughal centre, and the battle was won, India was his…after 350 years India would be united under a Hindu king…when at this point in time a stray arrow (could have even been a friendly fire incident) flew out of nowhere and struck him in his right eye. Hemu lost consciousness, and without his banner to rally under, Hemu’s forces meekly surrendered. Bairam Khan and Akbar had won only thanks to luck and not skill.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nBairam Khan went on a beheading spree under his Emperors name. He was said to have beheaded all Hindu soldiers (some 15,000) in Hemu’s army, beheaded all Afghan nobles and their families in Hemu’s court and is said to have created minarets of heads. Even Hemu’s father was tracked down, told to convert to Islam and when he refused…beheaded. Akbar took over from Bairam and spent 10 years conquering all of Hemu’s previously held lands all the way till Bengal. Mughal rule was solidified and would be deposed only by the Marathas some 3 centuries later.\n\nThanks for reading.

Iran had a near equal muslim majority and under the leadership of Khomeini were successful in toppling Shah's regime. Mind you, Iran was 5th most powerful country at that time and had a huge army. However, due to the sheer size of the population they couldn't do anything and let the country fall into Khomeini hands and we all know what happened after that.\n\nComing to the Indian scenarios, its even worse. As of now we have approx 20-30 cr muslims and in near future if they hit equal majority, be sure to see an Islamic revolution.  Our army wont be able to do anything. As of now we have 30 lakh soldiers which makes it one soldier for every 400 people.\n\nThe situation will get worse because we still dont have a government which is willing to take a strong stance against muslims like Shah.

The plant itself has a very high carbon dioxide assimilation ability; in 120 days of growing period, an acre of jute absorbs 6 MT of CO2 releases 4.4 MT of O2'<br />Body: '# History:\n\n The **jute trade** is centred mainly around India and the Indian State of West Bengal. The major producing country of jute  is India, due to its natural fertile soil. Bengal Jute was taken to  Europe early in the 17th century by the Dutch and the French and later  by the East India Company to Britain. \n\n Raw jute was  imported from Bengal  by the British East India Company. British Jute Barons grew rich  processing jute and selling manufactured products made from jute. Dundee  Jute Barons and the British East India Company  began to set up jute mills in Bengal and by 1895 jute industries in  Bengal overtook the Scottish jute trade. Many Scots emigrated to Bengal  to set up jute factories. \n\nMore than a billion jute sandbags were  exported from Bengal to the trenches during World War I and even more  during WWII and also exported to the Americas, especially the United  States southern region to bag cotton and coffee. It was used in the  fishing, construction, art and in the arms industry. \n\n India is one of the largest  importers of Jute in South Asia and also produces processed jute  products in the world, while Bangladesh is the largest producer and  exporter of raw jute. Therefore, the local price of raw jute in  Bangladesh is the international price. Ironically, the local price of  jute goods produced in India set their own price. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Contribution:\n\n Jute Textile Industry is one of the major Industries in the Eastern India, **particularly in West Bengal**.   \n\nIt is estimated that that the jute industry provides direct employment to 0.37 million workers in organized mills and in diversified units including tertiary sector and allied activities and supports the livelihood of around 4.0 million farm families. In addition there are a large number of persons engaged in the trade of jute. \n\nThe production process in the Jute Industry goes through a  variety of activities, which include cultivation of raw jute, processing  of jute fibres, spinning, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, finishing and  marketing of both, the raw jute and its finished products. *So, Jute  Industry is labour intensive and as such its labour-output ratio is also  high in spite of various difficulties being faced by the industry*.  Capacity utilization of the industry is around 75 per cent. Jute  industry contributes to the export earnings in the range of Rs. 1,000 to  Rs.1, 200 crore annually. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Jute the "Goldern" Fibre Plant:\n\nJute, the golden fibre, meets all the standards for safe‘ packaging in view of being a natural, renewable,  biodegradable  and  eco-friendly  product.  The  principal  varieties  of  jute  in  India  are  tossa (Corchorus Olitorious) and white jute (Corchorus Capsularis).  Though jute plant is known principally for its versatile fibre, every part of the plant has its use. The tender leaves are cooked and consumed as vegetables.  The  leaves  which  fall  off  the  plant  enrich  the  soil,  about  1  MT  of  dry  matter  is  put  back into the soil and about 3 MT of roots remain per acre of land. The stick which remains after jute fibre is extracted is used as a domestic fuel and also as a cheap building material. The plant itself has a very high carbon dioxide assimilation ability; in the 120 days of its growing period, an acre of jute absorbs about 6 MT of carbon dioxide form atmosphere and releases 4.4 MT of oxygen; several times higher than trees. Apart from the versatility of the jute plant, the plant compares very favourably in terms of its ecological footprint when compared with synthetic packaging materials.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Mills:\n\n As on date, there are 94composite jute mills out of which the state of West Bengal has 70jute mills with Andhra Pradesh having 10mills, Uttar Pradesh 3 mills, Bihar 3 mills, Orissa 3 mills, Assam 2  mills,  Chhattisgarh  2  mills  and  Tripura  1 Jute  Mill. As  on  31.08.2015,  26  mills  are  closed.  According  to  the  closure  notices  issued  by  the  managements,  the  principal  reasons  for  the  closure  of mills are labour indiscipline, absenteeism and trade unionism.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n# IMPORTS OF JUTE GOODS FROM NEPAL AND BANGLADESH\n\nIt  is  reported  that  there  is  large  scale  import  of  cheap  yarn,  B-Twill  fabric  and  sacking  from Bangladesh  and Nepal  which  is  seriously  distorting  the  Indian  market.    Bangladesh  provides  export incentives to its producer‘swhich along with other factors such  as  low  wages  and  power  cost  make their  products  significantly  cheaper  than  Indian  products  in  Indian  market.   Bangladesh  Government offers a 7.5% cash subsidy on the export of jute bags, which coupled with cheaper labour, cheap power and low capital cost makes imported jute bags from Bangladesh cheaper than bags manufactured in the country.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nCouldn\'t find much about the contributions , issues and other problems faced by this industry and how important it is and what can be done to encourage cultivation to other type of crops. If anyone has more info or know would nice to hear from them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Sources:***\n\n[***https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jute\\_trade***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jute_trade)\n\n[***https://outline.com/zCEWFX***](https://outline.com/zCEWFX)\n\n[***http://texmin.nic.in/sites/default/files/note\\_on\\_jute\\_sector\\_1.pdf***](http://texmin.nic.in/sites/default/files/note_on_jute_sector_1.pdf)'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'a8wo0w'<br />Score:21<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a8wo0w/jute_industry_more_than_a_billion_jute_sandbags/</li>

Go means cow and tra suffix is generally used for a place (eg yatra, tatra, ekatra)\n\nGo is a multifaceted word and could mean many things. Thus Gotra also means hurdle of people, group of people. It also means people of the same lineage (father, son, grandson and so on).\n\n&gt; Root of the Day - vas (वस्)\n\nvas means to wear, to dwell. To get inside something and own it. That\'s the whole sense of vas. \n\n&gt;Indic words derived from vas (वस्)\n\n* vasati --&gt; to stay, dwell\n\n* vastra  --&gt; clothes\n\n* AvAsa --&gt; house, dwelling place\n\n* basti --&gt; colony\n\n* basAvat --&gt; populated area\n\n* basna (verb) --&gt;  dwell, eg. tum mere dil mein basti ho.

One speaks them by curling the tongue to the palate and throwing out. \n\n* ट, ठ, ड, ढ, ण  all are spoken in this fashion. In fact, the curling is deepest in ट, and it gradually comes towards the upperrow of teeth as we progress from  ठ --&gt; ड --&gt; ढ --&gt; ण\n\n* Seeing this progression and convenience of curling, one can understand that it is natural to utter "na" (ण) sound of the same varga along with ट, ठ, ड, ढ . This is especially true for मूर्धन्य sounds because they involve curling. \n\n* That is why we have plethora of words like Pinda, Munda, Vakratunda, Soond. \n\n* The na ( न् ) in  इन्डिया is dental na. You have to touch the dental line to pronounce it.  As an exercise you can try pronouncing इन्डिया that way, it will be funny, as your tongue will unnecessarily move out of your mouth, along with some spit. \n\n* In the exercise of using ( न् ) you will be pronouncing द sound unintentionally. And it will happen because it is convenient to pronounce दन्त्य sound after न् .  Dantya (Dental) sounds are त, थ, द, ध, न .\n\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrevious Episodes : [#1](https://old.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a7pubd/streetside_linguistics_1_vrta/?st=jpznlhr2&amp;sh=520833c8) , [#2](https://old.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a8bjm4/streetside_linguistics_2/?st=jpznknq3&amp;sh=5492b0b3), [#3](https://old.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a8j3ra/streetside_linguistics_3/?st=jq0xtbxf&amp;sh=ac85c0bc)\n\nFor understanding the scheme of Sanskrit/Hindi letters used (transliteration) - [Harvard-Kyoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard-Kyoto)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'<br />Author: 'decoder007'  id: 'a8uqd1'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a8uqd1/streetside_linguistics_4/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Muzzling murderous, aggressive type humans and letting them run-free?'<br />Body: "Recently there was an article in the DailyMail about how pit-bull dogs were pouncing upon unsupecting dog walkers and killing their dogs. The solution is for the UK courts to kill the dog/put-it-down by force.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was wondering why we couldn't just muzzle the dog and let it run-free all the time: That way it could burn off its excess energy by running about and it could continue to interact somewhat normally, with small, cuddly-wuddly type dogs by smelling their bums and such.\n\nSo.. then it occurred to me, why not do this with humans? Instead of jailing them for petty theft, let them run-free in society, in a straight-jacket with a wifi-tag and such attached? They wouldn't be locked up in jail, instead they could hop about - down the street or make funny noises (because they'd be muzzled up to prevent biting). They could pay and buy stuff - same as anyone else by carrying a secure wallet that is operated at the shop.\n\nSome obvious downsides would be:\n\n1. cutting with an angle grinder - but this would mean you could arrest the accomplice who set the guy free.\n2. the prisoners 'chains' could be checked to see if he's been tampered with (obviously he wouldn't be in chains - more like a full dress suit [https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41d11IcPL%2BL.jpg](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41d11IcPL%2BL.jpg)\n\nWhy would this not be possible in India?\n\n&amp;#x200B;"<br />Author: 'veekm'  id: 'a8seb1'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a8seb1/muzzling_murderous_aggressive_type_humans_and/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'All questions regarding the RBI Fiasco answered'<br />Body: '**Who appointed Urjit Patel?**\n\nNarendra Modi.\n\n**Why did Raghu Ram Rajan step down?**\n\nBecause Narendra Modi and his government would not act against NPA companies. And also because draconian Demonetization was being planned.\n\n\n**Why did Deputy RBI Governor Viral Acharya raise the issue of Section 7 of RBI Act and warn the Government?**\n\nBecause Government wanted to step in and take over the Reserves of 10,00,000+ Crores lying with RBI and use them to plug NPA\'s.\n\n\n**Why does the Government want all this money?**\n\nBecause banks have been rendered empty and the 4,00,000 Crore windfall gain from Demonetization never happened.\n\n\n**Why companies are declaring NPA\'s?**\n\nBecause their business have failed due to a failing and failing economy.\n\n\n**But is the economy not doing very well under Narendra Modi?**\n\nIf that was the case, there was no need to take over RBI Reserves. The story about the economy doing well is a fake story like everything else told to you by Narendra Modi.\n\n\n**What triggered this take over bid of RBI Reserves?**\n\nBecause many companies were declaring NPA\'s and the biggest shock came when IL&amp;FS declared (officially) an NPA of 90,000 Crores. And none of the directors was arrested.\n\n\n**But why take over RBI Reserves when it had already paid a dividend of 58,000 Crores for the last fiscal?**\n\nBecause that was not enough to fill the holes created by businessmen who lost money hand over fist.\n\n\n**What will be the consequences for ordinary people when government prints more money?**\n\nPrices will rise across the board as more money will be chasing the same basket of goods and services.\n\n\n\n**Why Does Government of India require so much money and needs to print more?**\n\nIt is because GST has failed. From the expected collection of 1,30,000 Crores per month, it is only collecting 90,000 to 1,00,000 Crores with 30,000 Crores going back as refunds. Every month there has been a deficit of 30,000 Crores on an average.\n\n\n\n**Why GST Collection has fallen?**\n\nBecause it has been declared by IMF as the most complex form of taxation in the world and Indian businessmen have been smart to find out ways to avoid it, also the business volume has fallen as economy has failed.\n\n\n\n**Why Business Volume has fallen?**\n\nIf you withdraw 83% of blood of an economy for 2 months and then take 6 months to pump back that blood, you can\'t expect the person to get up and start running as if nothing had happened. Demonetization was such a blunder. It killed the economy and India lost 2% of GDP, which is approximately 3,00,000 Crores. And the losses continue. But Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar have both certified Demonetization as a brilliant move and they have also been endorsed by the likes of Aishwarya Rai and Paresh Rawal.\n\n\n\n**What is the immediate danger?**\n\nTelecom sector, that has seen mergers is now three players, Airtel, Vodafone Idea Limited and Jio and all three are bleeding. Telecom sector is sitting on 8,00,000 Crore possible NPA as estimated by SBI internal report which was later suppressed.\n\n\n**What about the GDP figures that show NDA-2 doing better than UPA-2?**\n\nFormer CEA has already spoken on this and informed how the Niti Aayog changed the figures and how to make NDA-2 look better they made UPA-2 look bad. They just drew a bigger line next to the UPA-2 Line.\n\n\n\n**Who is responsible for all this mess?**\nOf course Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru is responsible for all this mess and his family. They have not allowed Narendra Modi to do anything in the last 56 months. Had Sardar Patel been the First PM, none of this might have happened.\n\n**Who should resign?**\n\nThat\'s a stupid question!!! Of Course Sonia Gandhi should resign and Rahul Gandhi should resign as Congress President and Modi should be given a free hand with the 10,00,000 Crore RBI Reserves to do what he wants to do.\n\n\n**Who should you vote for in 2019?**\n\nOf course Narendra Modi, because he is the 11th Incarnation of Lord Vishnu. He is the savior of Hindus. He is the only person on the face of earth who can teach Muslims a lesson. He is the only person in India who can protect the cow. He is the only person in India who takes \'care\' of the poor, marginal, soldiers and veterans. He is the only person in India who can build the Ram Mandir. He is the only person on earth who has left behind his wife and family and even his mother and the only person who himself lives on 10 acres of prime property, protected by 5 layers of security while his 90+ year old mother stands in bank queues to withdraw 4000 Rupees as per demonetization rules along with a camera crew. Because he is the only PM who has traveled the world and done so many town-hall and rock-star type shows. Because he does Mann-Ki-Baat every month on Radio and it is broadcast on TV too. He is the only person who can buy 36 jets instead of 126 jets by paying the same price and convince you without giving you any data that 36 &gt; 126 and he has in fact saved money for the nation and yet managed to give 30,000 Crores to friend Anil Ambani.\n\nBecause there is no other person in the whole country who is more qualified than him with his MA in \'Entire Political Science\' and a missing BA.\n\nNow how dare you think of voting for anyone else?"\n'<br />Author: 'waahmudijiwaah'  id: 'a8qwt6'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a8qwt6/all_questions_regarding_the_rbi_fiasco_answered/</li>

I heard it was 90K back in 2015.\n\nIt\'s really organized and systematic you see. The dropout rate is almost negligible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, there\'s the indoctrination, which needs hate towards the existing patterns. Hence the converted are told how the Hindu devis and devtas are associates of satan; that all their superpowers are signs of witchcraft.\n\n"हनुमान इतना बड़ा कैसे हो सकता है ? यह तो काला जादू ही हुआ न। "\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut obviously, it\'s difficult to hate the deity you\'ve always loved, so they\'ll focus on ingraining cultural Christianity instead. So they make groups of 2-4 families, some new converts, some older ones for weekly prayer sessions at one of their homes, which the local priest presides over.\n\n\u200b\n\nIf somehow, you\'re feeling out-of-place, or incompatible with Christianity, you\'ll obviously try to move back to praying to your own deities and following your old customs and rituals. And that is what they expect. So they keep an eye out for such behavior. Once they get wind of anything of this sort going down, they send their local goons to scare you and threaten you. You\'re forced to abandon every sign of faith that is not Christian. You are warned against practicing any custom or tradition of your old religion.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn the end, you\'re left with the only choice to go through the motions mechanically without faith. But they know that. What they aim to achieve is faithful followers from the second and consecutive generations of your family, which they shall.\n\n\u200b\n\nSo...don\'t take their blood money. BTW, they don\'t pay if you\'re from rural Punjab or Haryana since they know they\'ll be outmaneuvered there. They tried in the initial years, just got duped into paying huge amounts, having farmers yell hallelujah en masse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh, and missionary nun Teresa was a human trafficker.

      <li>Title::: 'Teach Me Thursday - All About Sleep : Part 2 - 20 Dec, 2018'<br />Body: " \n\nHi! In this TMT we'll cover Circadian Rhythm, Factors Affecting Sleep and Sleep Disorders.\n\n**What is Circadian Rhythm?**\n\nCircadian Rhythm is basically your internal clock. It controls out 24-hr cycle that regulates our sleep and wakefulness. If you tend to feel sleepy at the same time everyday , it is due to your Circadian Rhythm. Sleep is not the only thing that the Circadian Rhythm affects. It also affects out eating habits, mood , metabolism and hormones. The Circadian Rhythm is responsible for reading environmental cues, and responding accordingly ( feeling drowsy when it's dark).\n\nMelatonin, a hormone which regulates wakefulness, the body temperature and cortisol (a stress hormone) are the factors which affect the Circadian Rhythm.\n\n**How does blue light affect our sleep?**\n\nBlue light, emitted from our laptop, phone or tablet screens disrupt sleep. Remember when you were so sleepy but you decided to browse your phone foe just a minute and now it's very late but you can't sleep? That's because the blue light emitted from your screen affected your melatonin levels. Melatonin is the hormone that helps us sleep, it is often given to people suffering from sleep disorders. Staring at the phone screen decreases your melatonin levels causing you to become more alert and therefore less sleepy. This is the reason we are often advised to lay off the electronics an hour before bedtime.\n\n**Why blue light?**\n\nWhile all wavelengths of light affect sleep, blue has the strongest effect because it it boosts alertness and attention. Simply put, blue light is most beneficial during the day and most disruptive to your sleep during nighttime. Read more about it [here.](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side)\n\nYou can reduce the effects of blue light by switching to dim red lights during nighttime. There are apps available for your phone and laptop to help with the same. [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) is a good one if you want to get started.\n\nCircadian Rhythms can be affected by a lot of factors like meal timings, exercise, hormones, body temperature etc.\n\n**Sleep disorders-**\n\nSleep disorders are classifies into 3 major categories- **Dyssomnias , Parasomnias** and **Circadian Rhythm disorders.**\n\n* **Dyssomnias** are characterized wither by excess sleep during the day (hypersomnia) or lack of sleep (insomnia).\n\nPeople with hypersomnia tend to fall asleep during the day, even after long periods of sleep. Hypersomnia could be dangerous as the person might fall asleep in the workplace or while driving, etc. Narcolepsy is disorder which causes sudden uncontrollable sleep attacks.\n\nInsomnia- It is either the inability to sleep or stay asleep ( waking up early). Acute insomnia is short term, might last a few days, could be triggered by anxiety or excitement. Chronic insomnia is often a side effect of drugs or other underlying conditions like asthma, mental disorders etc.\n\n* **Sleep Related Breathing Disorders**\n\nThese include snoring, sleep apnea ( in which a person might stop breathing for a few minutes or have bouts of shallow breathing while asleep).\n\n* **Circadian Rhythm disorders**\n\nAs the name suggests, these types of disorders are caused by disruption of the circadian rhythm.\n\nDelayed Sleep Wake is when people go to bed later and wake up later than usual, while Advanced Sleep Wake is when the bedtime shifts to a few hours earlier. Irregular sleep Wake is when there is no clear wake and sleep periods. Shift Work is when the person has unconventional work hours ( night shifts). This causes fatigue and inconsistency in sleep. Jet Lag- This is experienced by travelers who travel across time zones and have problems adjusting to their new schedule.\n\n* **Parasomnia**\n\nThese involve all the disorders characterized by abnormal sleep behavior. This includes nightmares, bed-wetting, sleep-walking, sleep paralysis or sleep talking."<br />Author: 'manhoosvyakti'  id: 'a80i1d'<br />Score:28<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a80i1d/teach_me_thursday_all_about_sleep_part_2_20_dec/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Streetside Linguistics #1 Vrta'<br />Body: 'Vrta means circle. \n\nLet us remember this, because this simple word is soon going to blow up and bleed into our languages in a few minutes. \n\nVritti means repetition, circling. Thus Vritti also means habits. As the first sutra of Patanjali says - Yogah chitta vritti nirodha (Yoga is cessation of circling done by mind).\n\nLike Vritti, we have Pravritti, (Pra + Vritti) which means inherent nature, habits that are (pra)pre-ordained by nature.\n\nTalking that goes to and fro is called Vaarta. Opening which is called Vartalaap. (Vaarta + Aalap --&gt; dialogue + invokation). Vaarta is the tatsam of the word, Baat in Hindi.\n\nLike Vaarta, Vritaant (vrita + ant) is a story, a completion of sorts. \n\nTo use something is called Vartana, even today in rural areas "Baratna" means using something.  Not just using, even utensils are called Bartana.\n\nAavartana means repetition, iteration. \n\nHence, Samaavartana (sam + aavartana ) means completion of Brahmacharya and schooling. \n\nVartika, which means part of a circle, is used to name a stalk, a paintbrush and wick of a lamp. The same wick of lap we now call Batti in Hindi.\n\nVrtra is someone who circles and engulfs. Vrtraghana is someone who slays or casts away the engulfer. [Indra], Vrtraghana was called Verethraghna in Old Persian (avestan to be precise), which became Bahram, the source of Bahram Khan\'s name. Irony.\n\nVrta actually carries the word root Ver, which is shared across many languages of the world, especially European.

[Interview]'<br />Body: '**Why did the BJP lose the Madhya Pradesh polls?** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; *We got more votes than the Congress but 109 seats. We are doing a  complete analysis. I did a lot of work as CM but I feel mujh mein hi  kahin kami reh gayi, poora nahin kar paaya (there was some shortcoming  in me that I could not complete the job). I also feel that the loan  waiver promise of the Congress worked to some extent on the ground, but  not full impact or we would have been completely wiped out. We won three  out of four seats in Mandsaur (lost one by just 300 votes) and all four  seats in Neemuch. The seat in Mandsaur, in which the unfortunate  incident of firing had happened in 2017, we won by about 10,000 votes.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why didn’t the BJP promise a similar farm loan waiver? BJP promised one in UP and won**   \n \n\n&gt;*My belief was that the farmer wants full worth of his sweat and that he  is not in favour of any khairat (dole). For that I started many schemes  and the amount of money I put in the accounts of farmers is  unparalleled in any other state. I believed our Mukhyamantri Krishak  Samridhi Yojana for small farmers was far more beneficial for them. The  total amount in loan waiver being promised by Congress now in one go – I  would have given the double of it to farmers over next five years  through various schemes. If Congress can now fulfil loan waiver promise,  that Kamal Nath ji should see.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How is the loss in the state polls likely to impact the BJP  in 2019 general election? Will you fight from your old seat, Vidisha?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;This loss will not impact the 2019 results in Madhya Pradesh.  Narendra Modi rules the hearts of the people and is a symbol of faith  for them. I have done an analysis of the present assembly results too  and by that, we have a lead on 17 out of the 29 Lok Sabha seats in MP –  we will better that by a long way. My aim is to win all 29 seats and if  not that, by all means repeat our performance of 2014 Lok Sabha election  when we won 27 out of the 29 seats. The issues will be completely  different in the 2019 election and based on the work done by Modi in the  last five years. I will devote myself fully to the 2019 campaign in MP  now and have no plans to move to the Centre. I need to remain among our  workers and the public in MP as I feel this will help the party here. As  for the Vidisha Lok Sabha seat on which Sushma Swaraj ji will not  contest now, the party will decide whom to field.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kamal Nath has said that your government left the state bankrupt…**  \n\n\n&gt;This is completely wrong to say. Khazana bhara hua hai,  bhandar bharpoor hai (the state exchequer is full of funds). I can  debate on this anywhere. MP is a revenue surplus state. In fact, our  economic condition is better than that of many other states. Never have  we gone into overdraft like some other states – we are in fact leaving a  surplus and not a deficit for the new government. On the point of loans  taken by our state government, these are very much within the limits of  percentage permitted to us by the Centre. The fiscal deficit limit was  given to us to the extent of 3.5% of gross state domestic product (GSDP)  given our good performance and we have always kept it below that level.  We have left money for various schemes of MP government – for  irrigation, roads, electricity and the new Sambhal Yojana started by us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Do you think the BJP’s personal attacks on Congress leaders including Kamal Nath backfired?**   \n \n\n&gt;This is an issue of analysis – many people are saying different things.  But you must look at the kind of words being used by Congress president  [Rahul Gandhi](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Rahul-Gandhi) for Prime Minister Modi – such kind of words have never been used by the BJP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUncluttered link - [https://outline.com/rWDNRf](https://outline.com/rWDNRf)'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'a7a0b8'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a7a0b8/shivraj_singh_chouhan_on_bjps_loss_in_mp_mujh/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Battle of Haldighati (my own repost)'<br />Body: 'Background History\n\nIn the year 1568, all of Rajasthan (and almost all of what we now know as Punjab, Pakistan, Central India all the way to Bengal) had been conquered by the Mughals lead by Akbar. It was either a direct conquest or vassals ruled on behalf of the Mughal court.\n\nIn Rajasthan almost all major kings / chieftains had accepted Mughal suzerainty except Udai Singh (our Maharana Pratap\'s father &amp; the founder of...you guessed it, Udaipur). Akbar who was a brilliant military commander himself was quite annoyed at this pesky little kingdom holding out against his forces. In terms of scale, think about the little Gaulish village of Asterix &amp; Obelix holding out against mighty Caesar.\n\nThere is another reason he wanted to crush this resistance movement. This Kingdom of Mewar had a history of producing great leaders (Rana Kumba, Rana Sangha, Udai Singh amongst others) who had a habit of holding out repeatedly against invasions, retreating into the hills and coming back stronger than before. Scottish war lords including Bruce &amp; William Wallace adopted pretty much the same tactics. Not Guerrilla warfare, but more trading space for time and allowing them to regroup.\n\nIn 1568, Akbar grew tired of his generals failing and lead his armies himself, crushed all opposition, sieged Chittorgarh. Akbar was giant in the league of Caesar or Napoleon when it came to military &amp; administrative skills, and when he took to the field, his opponents mostly fled...but not the Sisodia\'s of Mewar- the clan Maharana came from. They chose to make one last sally - every able man - against the numerically overwhelming Mughals while the women after exhorting the men to not return, jumped onto mass funeral pyres Sparta has nothing on the bravery of these Rajputs. To look at historical parallels, this is kind of similar to what some Gallic tribes did against Caesar, the Teutons and Cimbri took it to another level with the women killing any retreating soldier and in the end killing themselves.\n\nThe Rise of Maharana Pratap, bloody intrigue, brother betraying brother and a lot of drama\n\nAkbar went back to Delhi thinking there was peace in his Eastern territories...but nope, a greater leader than the previous Rajput leaders took charge. He was Maharana Pratap.\n\nHis ascension was not that easy as his elder half brother Jagmal Singh had been promised the throne, but in a coup Udai Singh\'s advisors removed him - he fled, with his army to Akbar where he was given a Jagir (title and land) and swore revenge on his brother.\n\nPeace offers &amp; War\n\nPratap Singh became Maharana Udai Singh and took charge of Mewar. Now once again, despite Akbar being painted as a blood thirsty Muslim...he was not. He did not want war, of course he did want Pratap Singh to become his vassal, and this was not acceptable to Pratap Singh. Akbar is said to have sent 8 messages of peace, in one (sketchy sources so can be wrong) he even offered to marry a woman from Pratap Singh\'s household and become relatives, this was common practice across all history and especially Akbar though.\n\nPratap Singh rejected them all...outright. Akbar STILL did not want war, so he sent what he thought was his trump card (bad miscalculation) and sent the leading Rajput in his court, Raja Man Singh. The Maharana was insulted, he saw Mansingh as an absolute traitor (and again, from his perspective...rightly so) and even refused to see him, and break bread with him (from what my wife tells me of Marwari traditions, this apparently is still considered to be an insult amongst the traditional Rajasthani\'s). All this while Maharana was not quiet. He used guerrilla tactics and hit Mughal supply columns or weaker Mughal outposts, and vanishing before reinforcements could arrive.\n\nChess moves before the war, pawns gained and pawns lost\n\nAkbar finally lost it and decided on war. Akbar used his strategic guile and using money, power and bribes got some of the Mewars leading allies to turn against the Maharana. He mobilised his troops and started marching on Mewar and Chitorgarh. Maharana struck back diplomatically by offering refuge to the kings (and their armies) who had been dispossessed by Akbar\'s conquests of Gujarat / Pakistan (what is now known as), so he lost allies, but gained allies as well.\n\nNow strategically, Chitorgarh is not very easily defensible (which is why Akbar took it rather easily), also based on different sources, his army was outnumbered by Man Singh\'s (Akbar still hadn\'t taken the field yet) by almost 1: 5, so he intuitively decided that a field battle or a siege battle would result in his annihilation so he abandoned it, and continued ruling from a strategically more defensible place called Gogunda - which was accessible only via the pass of Haldighati.\n\nInitial Moves\n\nAkbar\'s armies marched from Delhi while an advance army (of around 50k to 100k based on various sources) lead by Man Singh camped near Haldighati. The belief amongst the Mughals was that outnumbered, Maharana would prefer to play a defensive game like the previous rulers of Mewar. They were wrong.\n\nMaharana took to the field with between 15k to 30k men, and marched on Man Singh - this in hindsight was a very Napoleonic maneuver, if there are two strong forces marching on you, attack the weaker of the two (even if they outnumbered you), then use maneuver to get to the second force in a geographically weaker point and then destroy that also). Word of caution on the numbers, these numbers could still be inflated and might in reality have been around 10k Mewarians versus some 30k Mughals, but I will go with the larger numbers as it has more of an "epic feel" to it.\n\nThe Battle\n\nMan Singh got intel that Maharana might take to the attack, and he formed his ranks. He did this and sent an advance party uphill (he was camped on a plain) no sooner had he done this when the first wave of Mewar cavalry came crashing down on the Mughal vanguard and destroyed it. Round 1 to Mewar.\n\nTo picture this scene, think of the charge of the Rohiirim in Lord of the Rings. You had this massive army on a plain, a much smaller, but larger in heavy cavalry formed up in the heights of the Aravalis. The Maharana himself lead the charge. With their blood curling Rajput war cry (the Indian Rajput Regiment uses Bajrang Bali ki Jai, so it might still have been the same) they crashed onto the left flank of the Mughal army. For those not into battles and tactics, it might help to understand how battles in that era (and indeed from the first battle till gunpowder came to the scene) were fought.\n\nDigression into tactics 101\n\nBattles in the medieval era (and before that) were not the stylised 1-1 fights you see in Hollywood movies. Armies formed up in lines, typically they were massed 3-4 lines deep (to prevent the first line from crumbling and running). Once formed up, they pushed, jostled and slashed in a group against the opposition till they forced a gap. Once a gap was forced, troops would be forced into this opening to exploit it. If the line was exploited, it was game over. Most causalities happened during the chase or the slaughter after the gap was forced.\n\nNow, the centre was usually heavily reinforced, but they also usually had the newer units placed there while the thinner flanks had the more veteran units placed there. The objective of any army was to encircle the enemy (check battle of Cannae in the Roman eras for a classic encirclement battle. The Germans adopted this brilliantly to modern times in WW2) as any enemy army was most vulnerable in the rear. To this aid, most generals tried to "turn the flank" of the enemy. This meant destroying the units in the flanks and then turning on the harder centre. To counter this, the more advanced armies held reserves. Units they could use to plug a breach in the line.\n\nBack to the Battle\n\nThe initial line shattered, but the reserves held. Maharana\'s gambit had failed. HE NEEDED to break through the Mughal lines to create a gap to introduce his meagre war elephants into the rear of the Mughal lines. No matter, these Rajputs had balls the size of a mountain, so they did not lose heart, they pulled back, reformed and charged again. More cavalry men died, the Mughal line held. He now introduced his infantry.\n\nToe to Toe - Mughal numbers began to tell and the Mewar army started fighting a desperate battle. Man Singh (who was a brilliant military mind himself) introduced his cavalry archers at this moment - against these, the Mewar army had no defence.\n\nThe Battle was being lost, Rana lead his cavalry in YET another charge, this time against what he knew was overwhelming odds. No dice, the Mughal line held. He then threw his Elephants into the mix, Man Singh countered with his own Elephants. Elephants though were always a dicey deal and Mahouts had an iron spike to drive into an elephants brain if it went out of control. In battles in the Punic wars, Elephants were the bane of the Carthaginians as they would run amok and destroy allies and enemies without mercy.\n\nStalemate, but Mewar could hardly win a battle of attrition.\n\nAt this stage, sources again vary, but apparently the Maharana was either wounded badly OR his advisors persuaded him to flee the field and continue the fight (knowing what I know of Rajput History, guessing it is a combination of both as no self respecting Rajput warrior, let alone a leader of the stature of the Maharana would flee from the enemy)....anyways, Maharana retreated with a core group while a loyal general wore his cape and took the fight to the Mughals in the hope of distracting them.\n\nIt worked, the general died, Mahrana got away. Again mythologists will say that he was alone, chased by the entire Mughal army etc etc... but it was not that dramatic. The distraction followed by Man Singh\'s (correct?) guess that the narrow pass of Haldighati might hide an ambush decided to not give chase and retired for the night.\n\nAftermath\n\nHe retreated into the hills of the Aravali, and took his now famous vow of penury and penace, that till he retrieved Mewar he would eat from the floor (and not a plate / leaf), sleep on the floor, not shave or indulge in any pleasures of the body.\n\nAkbar once again (truly fair man that he was) sent embassies offering peace, and all territory BUT Maharana had to declare himself a vassal. No dice, Maharana now once again gathered his allies about him, his army which had been totally destroyed in the battle of Chittorgarh (his dad fought it) and Haldighati was rebuilt, and all this time he initiated guerrilla warfare against Mughal camps and supply trains and made their life an absolute misery.\n\nHe gathered enough troops and when Akbar and his army was busy in Punjab (which had risen in rebellion), he struck. Defeated a stronger Mughal army in the battle of Dewar, gained more allies and won back most of Mewar...the castle of Chitorgarh though forever remained Mughal.\n\nHe towards the end gave up the fight (as in the offensive battle) and took to governing his territories. Akbar, busy by now in what is Afghanistan (and I like to believe as a mark of generosity and respect which he was eminently capable of) backed off his campaigns in Mewar and the Maharana ruled in peace....till a fall from a horse on a hunting expedition (Robert Baratheon anyone?) killed him.\n\nHe, Shivaji, Akbar - Some of India\'s finest military minds.\n\nedited for formatting and added some content.\n\nedit : From a follow up comment in that thread,\n\nWhy didn\'t the Maharana simply surrender?"\n\nPurely academically integration into the Mughal empire UNDER Akbar was a solid positive. This is how it roughly worked. You retained your lands, the right to till them, tax them and administer them. You had to commit to a certain number of soldiers to be sent to the Mughal army if it was on a campaign and you paid a portion of the tax revenues (which under Akbar was very fair) to the central treasury.\n\nIn return you were guaranteed peace, you were not harassed for your religion which truly tyranical despots like Aurangazeb or even Babur did, and hey he would even call you into court and you could have debates on life, religion, philosophy, eat good meals and retire peacefully.\n\nHOWEVER, look at it from a Rajput perspective. They were losing their freedom, they had to call a Muslim an overlord, and this tested their martial nature to the max. It was not even a notion, but an absolute belief and a willingness to die in battle for that belief (or jump into a fire if you were a woman). I think we must respect them for that. They fought for what was right - their freedom. There is no question of honour trumps logic as honour and pride was the thing they held the dearest to them, to have them violated was highly illogical to them.\n\nThis made even more sense when you had Islamic despots like Aurangazeb who were literally out to destroy your entire way of life.'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'a78pqy'<br />Score:49<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a78pqy/battle_of_haldighati_my_own_repost/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Wickremesinghe returns as PM, UN migration pact leads to protests, and job openings at the White House!'<br />Body: 'Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Geopolitics thread! Here, you can discuss the latest happenings in the wild world of International politics, sports, culture, and much more. The discussion can be related to any place in the world, not just India, and need not be related to India either. To get the conversation started, here\'s the top news from around the world in the last two weeks:\n\n# Top 3 stories from India\'s neighbourhood\n\n1. [Ranil Wickremesinghe returns as PM of Sri Lanka](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-46583284)\n\nBringing to an end to about two months of strife in the island nation, Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in as the Prime Minister by President Sirisena, who had previously dismissed his government due to differences between the two. But this did not happen without a significant amount of drama: Sirisena appointed former President Rajapaksa (who Sirisena himself had defeated in the 2015 Presidential election) as PM, but he was promptly defeated in a motion of confidence in Parliament. Not satisfied, Sirisena ordered another vote of confidence, which saw violent clashes in Parliament but eventually led to another defeat. Then, in an unusual move, Parliament passed a motion in support of Wickremesinghe. In a final attempt, Sirisena attempted to dissolve Parliament and call for early elections, but the Supreme Court of the country declared it unconstitutional. Meanwhile, a lower court stayed Rajapaksa\'s appointment as PM, holding back his powers. The Supreme Court also refused to lift that stay. After all this, Sirisena eventually caved and reinstated Wickremesinghe as PM.\n\nA point of discussion here is that Sri Lanka, since 1978, has had a semi-presidential system with an executive President that has to work with a Prime Minister in his cabinet. But while the President is directly elected by the people, the PM has to enjoy the support of a majority of members in Parliament. Perhaps Sri Lanka should move to either a fully executive Presidential system, or a fully Parliamentary system to avoid such an ugly scene in the future?\n\n2. [Pak FM Asad Umar talks to the BBC](https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/12/15/happy-to-be-ashamed/)\n\nPakistani Finance Minister Asad Umar spoke to the BBC and answered a large swathe of questions. Three things stood out in the interview: a) Umar refused to "feel ashamed" (which is the question he was asked) of his country\'s relationship with Saudi Arabia in light of the murder of journalist  Jamal Khashoggi and the Yemen War. He pointed out that Donald Trump has also refused to break economic ties with the Saudis, and defended Pakistan\'s military presence there; b) He defended Chinese funding terms of CPEC and hit back at US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\'s declaration that IMF money should not go to China, while calling the US as China\'s biggest debtor; and c) He defended the government\'s handling of the appeal in the case of Asia Bibi, a Christian women who was found innocent of blasphemy charges but who is in mortal danger from fundamentalists, and pointed out that their government filed charges against all those who violently protested the Supreme Court\'s judgment.\n\n3. [US Carrier Group in the Arabian Sea in show of force against Iran](https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201812141070664623-us-iran-hormuz/)\n\nThe US Navy deployed a Carrier Group in the (western) Arabian Sea after Iranian President Rouhani repeated his country\'s threat to close the [Straits of Hormuz](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Hormuz) to all shipping if the US prevented Iran from selling oil to the rest of the world. The Straits form a key choke-point in international oil shipments, and any closure by Iran would have a significant effect on the global economy, particularly those of the Gulf nations that depend on oil for most of their exports, as well as major importers like China and India. The US has repeatedly warned Iran that it would hit back at any such blockade, and the war games in the Arabian Sea were to demonstrate just that.\n\n# Top 3 stories from the world\n\n1. [UN adopts Global Compact on Migrants, but many countries oppose it](http://www.sasknewsnow.com/united-nations-adopts-migration-policy-despite-australian-and-us-withdrawal-4334.html)\n\nThe United Nations, in a meeting in Marrakesh attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel among others, adopted the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration to manage the flow of migrants across the world. The pact, which is **not** binding on UN member states, aims to set out a list of standard procedures for countries to manage migrants (such as providing ID, ensuring access to basic services, and ensuring social cohesion) and while it differentiates between \'regular\' and \'irregular\' migration, it does not discuss the legality of either. Many countries, led by the US and Australia, refused to sign the Compact (in fact the US refused to participate in the process itself), calling it an infringement on the sovereign power of countries to control their borders. The government in Brussels fell over the pact, as over 5,000 people protested against it.\n\n2. [Trump struggles to hire a new Chief of Staff](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/421659-foxs-hume-trump-chief-of-staff-rejections-like-the-guy-who-couldnt-get-a-date)\n\nUS President Donald Trump is on the lookout for a new Chief of Staff, who acts somewhat like a Prime Minister in his cabinet, after the incumbent General (retd.) John Kelly said he would leave the position at the end of the year. According to media reports, several prominent candidates have refused to take up the job, leaving Trump in an odd situation. On his part, Trump has claimed that \'[many people](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1073737336935071744)\' wanted the position and he is still looking for the right candidate. In the meantime, Mick Mulvaney, who already holds a position in the cabinet, will be holding the position on an acting basis. Separately, Trump\'s Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke will also be leaving the administration.\n\n3.  [Theresa May wins confidence vote, calls for January Brexit vote](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/facing-opposition-theresa-may-will-bring-brexit-deal-back-parliament-n948826)\n\nBritish PM Theresa May was forced to withdraw a planned vote on the Brexit deal she had negotiated with the EU when it became clear that she did not have enough votes from both the opposition and her own minority government. This led to a motion of no confidence within her own party, which she won handsomely. May has now called for a Brexit vote in Parliament in mid January, hoping to gain some more assurances from the EU by then. On its part, the EU has said that they are sympathetic to May\'s political position but have refused to concede any more space to the UK. May has stressed that failure for Parliament to ratify the deal by March 29, 2019 would lead to a no-deal Brexit, which would be catastrophic. She also refused to call for a second Brexit referendum, saying it would be a betrayal to the people who had voted to leave (many of them supporters of her own party).\n\nEnjoy!\n\nवसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्'<br />Author: 'icecoolsushobhan'  id: 'a758l6'<br />Score:32<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a758l6/biweekly_geopolitics_thread_wickremesinghe/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Is One Country's Trash, Another Country's Treasure: What Happened When China Banned the Import of Waste Plastic?"<br />Body: " Since 1950, the word has produced 8.3 billion tons of plastic, and 322 million in 2015 alone. Plastic utensils and other waste is filling up our landfills and choking our oceans. Plastic can only be properly recycled after being sorted and graded, a labor intensive process that most wealthy consumers are unwilling to do. As a result, tens of millions of tons of plastic waste are exported to China where this plastic is recycled and re-purposed. The plastic recycling may have solved environmental problems in wealthy nations, but created new ones in China. The plastic imported\xa0 that could not be recycled was often dumped into China's streets and rivers, and between 10-15% of China's plastic waste originated in the developed world. Moreover, the acrid fumes and toxic by-products of plastic recycling damage the environment. Wen'an, the city at the center of China's plastic recycling industry, is one of the most polluted in China.\xa0To solve these problems, China effectively banned the import of plastic waste in 2017, creating a host of problems for the rest of the world.\n\nIt is estimated that 111 million tons of plastic worth $ 7 billion\xa0 need to be redirected to make up for the loss of Chinese markets, and over three quarters of world's plastic waste exports once went to China . Some of this plastic was redirected to other markets, although it is unlikely any set of countries can replace the central role placed by China. Imports of plastic waste to Indonesia have increased by 56%, doubled to Vietnam, and increased 10 fold in Thailand. Malaysia has emerged as the largest importer of plastic, importing an estimated 160 million tons of plastic waste, more than any other country in the world. However, the same environmental problems of recycling plastic has overwhelmed these countries. Malaysia and Thailand will ban the import of plastic by 2021, and it is likely over time other countries will follow suit. Much of the plastic once sent to China is accumulating in warehouses and recycling centers in wealthy nations, and no one knows what to do with it.\xa0\xa0\n\nThe Chinese government banned the import of waste paper in addition to waste plastic. The economics of paper recycling are similar to that of plastic. China once imported $5 billion worth of waste paper, roughly half of the world's total.\xa0 However, unlike with plastic, India is increasingly replacing China in waste paper imports. Indian imports of waste paper have doubled since 2007, and thanks to China's ban, are expected to more than double in 2018. Much of the labor intensive process of sorting and grading waste paper happens in the slums of Indian cities where wages are low, and environmental standards lower. The most famous slum based recycling center is that of Dharavi, made famous by the movie Slumdog Millionaire, but it is hardly the only such recycling hub in India. After grading and sorting, the paper is sent to paper mills where it is converted into newspapers and packaging. It is expected that by 2025, two thirds of all the paper mill feed-stock will come from recycled sources, much of this imported from abroad.\xa0\n\n**Selected Sources**  \n[The Chinese import ban and its impact on global plastic waste trade](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/6/eaat0131.full%EF%BB%BF)\n\n[www.wealthofnationspodcast.com](https://www.wealthofnationspodcast.com/)\n\n[http://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/India\\_-\\_Dharavi.mp3](http://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/India_-_Dharavi.mp3)"<br />Author: 'gnikivar2'  id: 'a6xhsx'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a6xhsx/is_one_countrys_trash_another_countrys_treasure/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Land Acquisition Bill 2013: The law that killed greenfield airport construction in India'<br />Body: "Do you remember the Land Acquisition Bill that was passed in 2013 with much fanfare by the UPA 2 government in the grip of a severe policy paralysis? The government promised that this law would simplify land acquisition and avoid lengthy project delays. But the law ended up having the opposite effect. \n\nBy laying down stringent conditions and highly inflated compensation amounts, it has made acquisition much more expensive and cumbersome. While this has affected projects across sectors, the biggest impact has been felt in the field of greenfield airports construction. Airports require large contiguous tracts land running into several hectares and they also need land that is located not too far from big cities. A combination of these two factors have made it nearly impossible to acquire land for new airports. \n\nSince the passage of the bill, **not a single greenfield airport project** has been able to complete  the process of land acquisition. All the news that hear about new airports and terminals being opened, were either notified before the passage of the bill, or required small land holdings adjacent to existing airports. The CM of TN is on record saying that under this law they cannot acquire land anywhere in a 50-70 km radius around Chennai for a new airport. The closest we have seen is the Jewar airport in UP where the state government had to move heaven and earth just to get consent. The compensation is still being discussed.\n\nSo, thank you EminentEconomist^TM MMSji.

      <li>Title::: 'The Rafale scam explained [P]'<br />Body: 'Original comment by u/thewebdev\n\nThe facts are as follows:\n\n    UPA government decides to buy 120+ Rafale jets 1.\n    It is a government to government deal. (Note: not exactly. Will update).\n\n    As per indian rules, for large defence deals, up to 30% of the deal amount 2 needs to be invested in India. They are encouraged to invest this 30% to manufacture parts or the whole product itself in India.\n\n    Since the Rafale deal is a very huge deal Dr. Manmohan Singh\'s government insisted in the contract that 50%, and not 30%, had to be invested in India 3.\n\n    The UPA government also insisted that Dassault should tie up with HAL 4 and most of the 50% investment should go to them.\n\n    The UPA government also insisted that Dassault will have to agree to a transfer of technology 5 of the Rafale Jet and its assembly line with HAL.\n\n    So it was agreed that India would buy 18 Rafale jets that was manufactured in France, and the rest would be assembled in India by HAL under Dassault\'s guidance.\n\n    The UPA deal meant that HAL would get new technology, learn better ways to build planes from Dassault, and could build the plane by themselves in the future if Dassault went bankrupt and closed or relationship with France soured.\n\n    After basic price negotiation was done, Dassault and HAL started to negotiate on the "workshare agreement" 6 of how to go about with the technology transfer, how to build and operate the assembly line, how to build the jets, what parts could be sourced from India and France or elsewhere, who would guarantee what, how to maintain the plane, warranty etc etc.\n\n    It was very complex 7, as HAL and Dassualt agreed or disagreed on many things, and often the French government or the Indian government had to get involved to break the deadlock.\n\n    As 2014 election came, and negotiations between Dassault and HAL were not concluded, the UPA government allowed them more time and said the next government can take the deal to its logical conclusion 8.\n\n    The Modi government came and it allowed the negotiations 9 between HAL and Dassault to continue.\n\n    In jumps our middleman, Mr. Anil Ambani 10, 10\'s of 1000\'s of crores in debt.\n\n    He promises Modi kaka new ₹15+ lakh suit-boots 11 if he kicks out HAL and diverts the offset investment to Reliance. 12\n\n    Unknown to both HAL and Dassault, Modi kaka agrees.\n\n    Dassault CEO announces that the deal is 97 95% complete 13 and the deal can be concluded by Modi kaka.\n\n    The indian defence minster had also said that the deal was about to be concluded. (Can\'t remember the source for this).\n\n    Anil Ambani accompanies Modi 14 kaka to France.\n\n    Just before the trip, he creates a new "defence" company. 15\n\n    Suddenly it is announced that Modi kaka has done a new deal 16 - and will be buying 36 Rafale jets outright from France. All the jets will be made in France.\n\n    The new jets are also to be bought reportedly at a 300% premium 17 to the price originally negotiated by the UPA.\n\n    Modi kaka further changes rules again to benefit Reliance and allows 49% (upto 100% with govt. approval) foreign direct investment in the defence sector 18. Three months later, the Reliance Defence-Dassault Aviation joint defence production venture is announced. 19 to fulfil part of the offset clause requirement.\n\n    So Reliance benefits to the tune of around ₹30,000+ ₹21,000+ crore 20 or so. (Obviously, Modi kaka as his Benami partner gets a secret bank account from Anil Ambani to update his wardrobe and to retire to a life of luxury.)\n\n    HAL? Who are they ...? Who cares ...? 21 Certainly not Modi kaka or anyone in the BJP\n\n    Modi kaka claimed in 2016 the UPA deal was "taking too long" and "going nowhere". And airforce urgently requires these fighter jets. But our airforce will still get only a few of the jets starting from 2019 to 2022 21.\n\n    Asked why HAL was kicked out, and Reliance bought in, Modi kaka says Dassault made that choice. The former President of France now claims that Modi kaka gave them no choice but to rope in Reliance. 23\n\n    Now everyone from the defence minister to the finance minister have to lie to the public to hide Modi kaka\'s corruption. But Satyamev Jayathe.\n\n(EDIT: Consider this a draft - has a few errors; I\'ll correct later).\n'<br />Author: 'smartdog99'  id: 'a6e5bi'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a6e5bi/the_rafale_scam_explained_p/</li>
      <li>Title::: "India's colonizers - Britain now lives in the fear that they are now colonized by the European Union. [The Brexit Paranoia explained from Indian perspective]"<br />Body: 'I had written a comment about it here, and someone had requested me to explain it in detail. So, here we go.\n\nThe United Kingdom(UK) is now facing its biggest problem since world war. For the past three years, the only thing discussed on the media is about a single event called Brexit. All the politicians of the country are focused in doing this single thing while ignoring hundreds of other important stuff. So, let\'s see what is going on.\n\nDisclaimer*: I am not an Expert on Brexit. I just know what I know from reading news. So, read it for fun and not for educational purposes.*\n\n# Introduction\n\nEuropean Union(EU): It is the largest bloc of countries in the world. It has the highest GDP, one of the biggest militaries, highest wealth, and highest levels of power. 28 European countries are part of this union. It is basically a "super-country" which is similar to how central government works in India along with states of India, with one key difference being, instead of states, these are countries.\n\nThe benefits of the European Union is that if these states were alone, then they would teeny tiny irrelevant countries in geopolitics, but if they come together, they are the most powerful force on Earth. The people in EU have the right to work, study, live, retire anywhere in EU without any restrictions. The people can do business anywhere in the EU freely without any customs border. People don\'t need visas to go to other countries within EU. The countries can afford expensive stuff like Scientific research, European Space Agency etc as all 28 countries are sharing the money.\n\nNow, UK was a "special" member of EU because they joined it earlier than other countries and thus they got special rights which other countries don\'t have, like UK still has their currency as "pound" while the recently joined countries have to change their currency to Euro etc. In every way, being in EU was super beneficial.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What happened?\n\nSome political party in the UK wanted to win elections by throwing tantrums around with ridiculous claims like they want a referendum(people\'s vote) to decide if people want to stay in the European Union or Not. I personally don\'t think they actually wanted to leave EU. This was just politics to make it seem like the current ruling government is not good in the minds of common people. It is similar to how "rafale deal controversy" happened in India despite of there being no evidence of any kind of scam. The only aim is to play dirty politics.\n\nDue to these party accusing the government for several years. The Prime minister of UK decided that "Enough is enough", let\'s silence these trolls by giving what they want and proving to everyone that they are trolls. So, he agreed to conduct a nationwide referendum where people can vote either "leave EU" or "Remain in EU". At that time it was obvious that the Remain will win. Almost all surveys of people also showed that Remain will win. \n\nBut, surprising everyone, about two years ago in this referendum, the "Leave won by 51%". If the remain had won, the next day would have gone as nothing changed, but now that Leave had won, it became a national crisis. Many people who wanted to remain regretted not going to vote as they thought British are not this stupid to vote leave. Many people had voted "leave" just as a prank so that people will wonder how leave got so many votes. \n\nMany people voted to leave because they were paranoid that UK is now a colony of EU. They feel that "European Empire" is conspiring against the British and is forcing them to the EU laws thus treating them as a colony.  [EUROPEAN EMPIRE: Powerless Britain to become mere COLONY if we don\'t quit Brussels](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/663846/EU-referendum-David-Cameron-Europe-UK-power-Roman-Governor-Brexit). So, the once colonizers of India are now living in fear that they themselves are being colonized.\n\nThis refrendum lead to Prime minister resigning for this blunder, and a new government was elected. That was the party which wanted this Brexit(Britain-Exiting-EU). I don\'t think they actually wanted to win, as they had made crazy promises which cannot be fulfilled. I think all they wanted was to rally up the support towards their party. Anyways, now they were faced with the mess of doing a Brexit. Most of the main leaders of the Brexit moment shied away from the Prime minister\'s post as no one wanted to deal with this. Ultimately, a lady named "May" was made the prime minister.\n\nMay invoked the withdrawal agreement of EU, and this means, two years from invoking, they will be out of the EU. This is a transition period to make any sort of trade deal with EU. For two countries to trade with each other, or if citiznes of one coutnry want to go to other country etc, there needs to be a "deal" between those two countries agreein to certain terms.\n\nNow, since Britain was part of EU since 1973, all of the deals with other countries was with EU. Like,  [India–European Union relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%E2%80%93European_Union_relations) was defined by 1994 EU-India Cooperation Agreement. So, suddenly. UK will have to make new deals with every country on the planet. \n\nAnd, they will also have to make a deal with EU if they want to interact with them. Making a deal is not an easy process as it accounts for everything. For example, the deal between Canada and EU took seven years to make. This is a shitty position for UK to be in.\n\n# CONSEQUENCES\n\nNow that UK is not that powerful, countries are not giving them as good deal as they already had. Like for example, India is basically ignoring their requests for deals in hopes that they will become desperate and offer a significantly better deal for us.  [Brexit: India \'not in a rush\' to sign trade deal with Britain, ambassador says](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-india-uk-trade-deal-britain-ambassador-yashvardhan-sinha-a8292091.html). India is not running out of time, but UK is, thus it puts them in a terrible negotiation position. Meanwhile the politicians who wanted to leave EU had claimed before the vote that every country will be so attracted to UK that they will beg UK to take their deals.\n\nTwo years ago, when UK made a law, that on 29 March 2019 UK will leave EU. That date is fast approaching and UK do not have any deals with EU yet. The current PM May had got a deal known as "may\'s deal" but that was a terrible deal which gave EU lot of power. And it also require UK to give over 40 Billion pounds of money as "Divorce settlement" for the projects UK had agreed before Brexit. These payments go on till 2064, and during these period, UK will have no voting rights in EU. And, this deal also lets EU to decide when UK will fully leave EU. Due to how shitty the deal was, it was strongly opposed by everyone.\n\nNow, UK is left with just three options and all of them lead towards catastrophic economic disaster - \n\n**LEAVE with a DEAL** \\--Now, if they leave with a deal, it would be far far worse than what they already had with EU. \n\n**LEAVE with NO DEAL** \\- Now, if they leave EU without any deal it would be like doing Economic Suicide. They will suddenly face horrible currency devaluation, businesses will leave UK, Investors will pull out the money, Banks will move to EU, job loss, riots, food shortages etc. Some 60% of the food in UK have to be imported, and this would mean suddenly they can\'t import food or medicine or essentials. \n\nUK\'s main source of income are services, like financial services. London is the headquarters of lot of banks and companies because of how stable it is and the easy access they get to Europe. But, now that is gone. A lot of these companies will move to Europe. Infact, many companies have already moved out.\n\nMany parts of UK which is not part of the mainland will suffer as even UK\'s planes can\'t fly due to lack of rights. The insurance companies in EU will not give insurance to any accidents happening in UK as there is no deal. The businesses in UK will not be able to trade with EU. There are tons of such problems. \n\nUntil recently, no one thought UK will reach a stage where NO DEAL is seriously considered as an option. But, if no other option is chosen, the default option is NO DEAL which will automatically kick in on that date.\n\n**REMAIN** \\- And, they can\'t "remain" in the EU because that would mean the politicians have to go against what people voted for in the referendum. If they do this, then there will be huge protests and riots in UK for going against democracy. It will rise to instability and lack of trust in government.\n\nThen there is the problems of "UK" itself disintegrating and getting divided into several countries. The people in the state of Scotland and Northern Ireland had voted to remain, yet they are now being forced to do this stupid stuff because England thought so. Scotland had previously had a referendum for Independence from UK few years ago. At that time, they chose to stay with UK because the same politicians had promised that leaving UK means leaving EU which would be terrible for Scotland. But, Now, UK itself is leaving EU and Scotland is one of the main beneficiaries of EU, thus causing them lot of trouble. So, they will likely ask for independence.\n\nNorthern Ireland is another part of UK which had gone through independence struggle a few decades ago. Ireland is a country which is an island similar to Srilanka. Northern Ireland is a part of that Island which is in British control. So, if the UK leaves EU, then there will literally be a border dividing this Island into two. This will be terrible for the people living there and they will likely want independence from UK and may want to join Ireland. There are already movements going on to do this.\n\nNow, there is a place called Gibralter which was an ancient colony of UK that is still in UK\'s control This location is in Spain. Think of this, 96% of people in Gibralter voted to remain in EU as they will be terribly affected by leaving EU(having nowhere to go), yet they are being forced to do so by Britan, do you think it will end well? I would imagine they would want to join with Spain.\n\nIn any case, this discussion of "Brexit" and its effects will dominate the media and the lives of their politicians for the next 20years, thus being unable to focus on more important stuff. It is like they shot themselves in the foot.\n\nAs you can see, all three options they have leads towards certain doom. Get your popcorns ready for the Brexit on April fools day boys...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tl;DR** \\- British shot themselves into their own foot. They are about to commit economic suicide on 29 March 2019. All options they have leads to certain disaster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;'<br />Author: 'Fdsn'  id: 'a6e1sr'<br />Score:79<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a6e1sr/indias_colonizers_britain_now_lives_in_the_fear/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How to write about Hindus with a left hand, a satirical essay by Hindol Sengupta'<br />Body: 'Always use the word “Hindu” as if you really meant to write “Hindoo” (colonial spelling\n\nused to suggest parody) but are too polite. Words like “dusk,” “soul,” “heterodox,”\n\n“bourgeois,” “traditional,” “Orientalist,” naturally, help. Subtitles may include\n\nthe words “ancient,” “plural,” “civilization,” “alternative,” “sex.” The last one\n\nis of the most vital significance. Without it, your book (article, essay) and Hinduism\n\nare doomed. Its soul will never be discovered.\n\nThe pictures you use along with the writing can never have kind, well-adjusted, pleasantly\n\nGod-fearing folk. They should have great matted hair. A bushy chest. A trident in\n\nthe hand really helps. They can’t wear too many clothes. It spoils the image of the\n\nwarrior sadhu—the monk doth protest too much is a powerful tool. Don’t treat it lightly. Or you\n\ncan have a bespectacled, grouchy old man holding a grammatically incorrect banner.\n\nLooking angry.\n\nMake them stand on the right side of the frame of your image. That explains the number\n\nof times you will be writing right-wing. If they are helpful, they can even lean a\n\nlittle to the right. Preferably using the trident (carried as a weapon by the god\n\nShiva, the Destroyer in the Hindu trinity; the other two are Brahma, the Creator,\n\nand Vishnu, the Preserver). Or the misspelled banner.\n\nIn your text, constantly refer to the vastness of Hinduism; use poly- a lot (it can\n\nbe theistic, even gamy); put heterogeneousness in every other sentence, but essentially treat Hindus as one slightly off-centre\n\nwhole. You will use the word monolith—it means one uniform entity. That’s how you should treat Hinduism. Though you must\n\nnot, ever, say so.\n\nAlways call Hinduism a “way of life.” It’s like saying “Open, Sesame.” “Way of life”\n\nis like the sari. It hides a multitude of sins. All the greedy excess and binge drinking\n\nneatly hidden behind its pleated folds. Once you declare “way of life” you are free\n\nto say anything.\n\nBegin by writing that you love all gods and goddesses. The Hindus have many of these.\n\nSo there are many books (articles, essays) to be written. But nowhere have you mentioned\n\nsnake charmers or elephants. So your work is not about hunting down the exotic. It\n\nis scholarship. Oh, sorry, you did mention an elephant god. You said his trunk is\n\nthe penis. Or his penis is the trunk. One can’t be entirely sure but there is some\n\ncock (and bull) there. It is, after all, a way of life.\n\nMove quickly to sex. Too much meditation and spirituality becomes boring. Or like\n\nyoga. And why would someone read you for that? Bikram does it better. George, you\n\nknow? Clooney? Him, and Madonna, and Lady Gaga—they all go there. One client for every\n\ngeneration.\n\nTaboo subjects—Hindus quietly praying. Hindus writing philosophy. Or theology. Hindus\n\ngoing about their daily lives; or Hindus not beating women, not raping women, not\n\nshowing penis, or breasts or vagina.\n\nOne of the biggest points of your book must always be that there are no rules in Hinduism.\n\nYou must profess great love for Hinduism at the beginning of the book. It could begin\n\nby talking about your mother showing you the colors of India. From your mother’s cheap\n\nbatik scarf to loving Hindu texts is a small distance—which your book can easily cover.\n\nDescribe in detail the colors of India. The colors of mud (on Hindus who are naked),\n\nthe colors of the trees (which are standing up, you know, like penises), the color\n\nof the sky (blue, like what the woman feels like after coitus sometimes), the color\n\nof the festivals (red, like menstrual blood)—say that you love all these colors. Especially\n\nif there are naked people in them. And that all those colors are colors of copulation\n\nfor the Hindus.\n\nAlways subtly hint that while you have read and mastered all Hindu texts, there is\n\nactually nothing called Hinduism. This must be the great consistent revelation of\n\nyour book. It is also great preparation just in case someone spots your errors and\n\ntakes you to court.\n\nThe more you write that you love the openness in Hinduism, the better it is for you.\n\nBecause if nothing exists, and there are no rules, no facts, no realities and no texts—if\n\nthere is no Hinduism—then you can write what you want. And anything you write will\n\nmake you a scholar.\n\nSo in this nothing-exists-ness, you can cleverly make everything into those three\n\nvital truths about the Hindus—naked, vagina, and penis.\n\nTry never to say anything good about any Hindu god or goddess (unless you are saying\n\nsomething about their penis or vagina or both). But always say that all the villains\n\nin Hindu stories were actually the good guys. Only misunderstood and misrepresented—like\n\nthe National Rifle Association, or the Taliban. Never talk about the penis or vagina\n\nof the villains. Never describe them as naked. But the heroes must always be sex crazy,\n\nlustful and raping. Only gods rape—demons don’t. That’s another great revelation you\n\nwill discover during your research.\n\nNever get your book reviewed by any practicing Hindu.\n\nYour book needs a cover where many gods and goddesses and people are naked or showing\n\ntheir vagina or penis or doing things with their vagina or penis. Never ever have\n\na cover showing someone meditating because everyone knows that meditation was discovered\n\nin America. And then exported to the rest of the world. As a global super brand.\n\nAlways end your book with Mahatma Gandhi saying something about Hinduism. Then quickly\n\nmention something about his sex life and use the words “naked young girls” in the\n\nsentence. Because you love Hinduism. And its openness.\n\nBecause you care.'<br />Author: 'DesiDaaruCo'  id: 'a6cgcq'<br />Score:31<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a6cgcq/how_to_write_about_hindus_with_a_left_hand_a/</li>

The distribution is 11 women &amp; 9 men. Now you look at historic data for that state/sea whatever. Let's say in the last elections (or more elections), 60% of the voters were men &amp; 40% were women. Which means out of 20 voters, 12 were men &amp; 8 were women.

      <li>Title::: 'Karnataka Ekikarna and Italian Reunification: Some Parallels'<br />Body: "In many ways the joining of together of these regions to form Karnataka reminds me of Italian reunification with many of the initial disparities between the regions, especially the wealthier, industrial North and the poorer, agrarian (also feudal) South (Mezzogiorno), persisting and in fact even widening. While considerable resources have been spent in bringing convergence between the regions from both the Italian government and the EU structural funds, there infact has been increasing divergence between the regions. A similar situation can even be seen with North Karnataka consistently lagging behind the rest of state (Hyderabad Karnataka especially which was notorious for it's feudal landholding system). It doesn't help that these regions are relatively arid (Karnataka in fact has the largest arid lands in the country after Rajasthan). Also it doesn't help that development in Karnataka, especially over the past 20 years, has been very Bangalore centric, meaning that even urban development in the state is very skewed, with Bangalore being pushed to the limit, with other cities being comparatively insignificant. This is unlike Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu which have alternative urban and industrial centres like Pune, Nashik, Nagpur and Coimbatore, Madurai respectively, even if Maharashtra also has considerable regional divides. Much like the situation with southern Italy, considerable sums have been spent in public projects in North Karnataka with nothing much to show in terms of results. Social indicators wise too the region lag behind other parts of the state, with Hyderabad Karnataka being the worst off. Interestingly while not being very industrialised the region that comes closest to Bangalore in terms of income are the coastal districts which also have social indicators that trump even Bangalore's. This may have something to do with the fact that like neighbouring Kerala, along with considerable advantages in terms of human capital, the old trade links with the gulf set off a remittance economy based on migration, bringing in relative prosperity. These patterns like pointed out by Acemoglu and Robinson are result of differing socio-political institutions, where extractive institutions may produce results in the short run, however these are disproportionately  cornered by elites who own resources such as land and capital, further increasing inequality and also resulting in a much smaller middle class who are key in bringing economic and political change. This could clearly be seen in the different landholding laws across the various regions with Mysore following a system that gave considerable rights to peasant proprietors (raitha in Kannada) leading to formation of relatively powerful agrarian groups such as the Vokkaligas and resulted in lesser instances of landlordism. This combined with combined with a modernised bureaucracy combined with some visionary leadership under the Mysore kings and administrators like Visweswaraiya, Seshadri Iyer and Mirza Ismail led to considerable industrialization in the kingdom with projects such as the Sivasamudram and Bhadravati hydroelectric projects, Mysore paper mills, Bhadravati steel plant, Mysore motorcycles etc. Also socioeconomic mobility among communities was relatively higher in Mysore with the kingdom being among the first in the country to introduce affirmative action for backward classes before independence. The sociologist MN Srinivas noted that the depressed classes ( scheduled castes) in the kingdom while lagging behind other communities within the kingdom, they were significantly better off than similar communities in the neighbouring Madras presidency, with some even being landholders themselves. This eased caste relations in the kingdom and for the most part in the future state of Karnataka resulting in relatively lesser caste conflict than neighbouring Tamil Nadu and the Telugu speaking states, though there's still competition between communities. However the landholding system in Hyderabad Karnataka region like the rest of the Nizam's domains was heavily feudalistic with landlords (Doras) exercising considerable influence over their tenants with them even having the right to extract bonded labour (Begar) from them. In the absence of good irrigation networks in this arid region, agrarian distress in this region was even harder. Bombay Karnataka suffered on account of being a peripheral region in a large presidency and was hence often neglected, resulting in lack of development in the region. The initial push and strongest support for Ekikarna (unification) was in this region, where many also felt that Kannada language and culture were at risk of being swamped by Marathi. One of the original proponents of the Ekikarna movement, Aluru Venkata Rao was from this region. The States Reorganisation Commission in its report noted these disparities and while supportive of unification was cautious about the strain on finances such a move would cause with the relatively developed regions having to subsidize the rest of the state. While there have been efforts to reduce this disparity through legislation, the latest being the 99th ( Article 371J) constitutional amendment granting special status to the Hyderabad Karnataka region, with there being affirmative action for domiciles of the region in state institutions along with other provisions meant for the development of the region. Whether this will work is unclear so far, though considering similar past efforts it seems highly doubtful.  Institutional advantages gained by regions accumulate over time, increasing pre-existing inequalities, though one does have to add a word of caution that even in areas with better institutions, institutional decay is a factor that one must guard against it as it undoes any advantage these regions have. And that's how things stand as of today. A distinct political and economic divide still persists. Party wise the BJP is strongest in the regions of Bombay Karnataka and the Coastal districts plus Bangalore city, while it's presence in the old Mysore region is weak (except for the hill districts, Malenadu, such as Chikmagalur and Shimoga). The JD(S) is essentially restricted to the old Mysore region, especially the Vokkaliga dominated regions. This leaves the Congress being the only truly pan Karnataka party.

However then someone PM's me with\n\n*from* [*sanman*](https://www.reddit.com/user/sanman)\n\n*What's your point about the carry trade? The carry trade with India  occurs due to its higher rates compared to other more developed  countries. Modi's govt has been in favour of lower rates. Your friend  'Rockstar' Rajan was obsessed with higher rates, which only aggravated  the carry trade.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy reply was this:\n\n*the rates are higher because we are risky (like Argentina or Turkey) -  my point is:* \n\n*1. RBI works in the environment politicians create: if the economy is  weak and we don't sell enough to cover oil imports, then FDI pays for  those imports and creates $ liquidity, which means attractive higher  rates for foreign investors.*  \n\n*2. Once you start offering higher rates, your banks are weakened because  there profit margin reduces and they come under pressure to find  investments. The whole system becomes exploitative - with farmer  suicides (because we are an agrarian economy).* \n\n*3. Bank managers indulge in corruption because they realize this system  of governance is bound to fail.* \n\n*4. The common/middle-class is punished as a result - it's our savings  that will be destroyed when the carry trade corrects.*\n\n *5. Why does all this happen: because poor people ASK FOR JOBS - they  don't ask for an opportunity to study and create jobs. This forces the  politician (who has no magical powers to create jobs) to ask industry to  create jobs. Industry needs R&amp;D for job creation therefore who has  R&amp;D - America/foreign-money.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nf*rom* [*sanman*](https://www.reddit.com/user/sanman) *sent an hour ago*\n\n*No,  the rates are higher because RBI use that to counteract inflation and  mitigate price increases. But there are other ways to counter inflation -  such as* ***Supply Side Economics.***\n\n*Keeping rates so high amounts to saying that Indians have too much  money and that they're spending too much. The reality is the opposite -  it's not that Indians on average have too much money, it's that* ***there  are too few goods produced in the country - that's what makes the prices  too high.***\n\n*So what's needed to remedy that is Supply Side Economics, whereby*  ***more production is encouraged.*** *This means lowering rates to encourage  more borrowing and capital flow to producers of goods and services.*\n\n*But l****enders are already saddled with so many bad debts*** *that there's a*  ***death of capital to lend out to legitimate borrowers****. That requires a  TARP program to separate bad debts from good ones. This will free up  lending for good borrowers, to help economic growth. But to do TARP  requires political capital. Supporters of RBI autonomy need to  understand this. They need to understand that economic reform requires a  steady hand, and not changing political horses mid-stream. Otherwise,  that throws the wider reform progress into jeopardy.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy reply is this:\n\n'*there  are too few goods produced in the country - that's what makes the prices  too high.'*\n\n1. There are plenty of goods being produced in China - we operate in a global market. The govt controls imports into India by customs checks and this allows Indian/domestic manufacturing to compete locally, out-pricing the Chinese goods. \n2. However this strategy cannot work for ever - why? In a recession, when Trump blocks Chinese exports to the US, Chinese manufacturing will have to cut prices even further - the Chinese are sensible and have setup many controls to prevent cannibalization - they won't destructively fight with each other but they will continue to export to Asia **to preserve their manufacturing base.** Why? Because they need this manufacturing base to protect against war with America.\n3. Therefore Indian traders will now start smuggling goods across the border in a controlled fashion because China will try to control the exports to India to prevent it from **suddenly destroying** our manufacturing. However the direction is very clear: our manufacturing cannot compete directly with China once USA levies tariffs!!\n4. **Which means, we HAVE TO sell our companies to western governments or we patch up with China and cut a deal with them.**\n\n'*more production is encouraged' 'derth of capital'* \n\n1. Production cannot take place without resources (coal, iron ore, etc). If our industries could not compete during the good times, they will not be able to compete during horrible times. Meaning that, you are competing with China, Russia for commodities - those contracts are usually long term. China has a huge lead in terms of efficiency and production and they will have locked in major suppliers of resources (Australia, Africa, Brazil etc)  - you/our-industries cannot decide to compete one fine day and renegotiate those contracts **in a cost effective manner.**\n2. Capitalization is a problem BUT the trouble is we don't have technology to create a killer product.\n\nWhat has all this to do with the carry trade? The carry trade is where, foreigners lend Indian companies $ at a higher than US interest rate. If US rates are 3%, they come here and lend $ to our companies at 4%. If US rates rise, either the money flows out, back to the US, or our banks have to raise rates to 5%. This eats away the bank-profit-margin."<br />Author: 'veekm'  id: 'a53vq5'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a53vq5/the_dangerous_indian_carry_trade_and_its/</li>

Many such languages are created, keeping in mind the comfort of the programmer. Such languages fulfill the computational needs of the world and serve their purpose. Somewhere in the midst of all this, the “fun” side of programming is lost. &lt;br/&gt;\nOur project, “Modi Script” is one such esoteric language created with the sole intention of making use of quotes by our beloved PM Narendra Modi. The star feature of this language is that the language consists entirely of remarkable statements made by the PM. The language is  dynamically typed and  turing complete, sprinkled with words of wisdom by our PM! &lt;br/&gt;\n\n## Features\nThis scripting languague includes some "ideas" of Shri Narendra Modi. &lt;br/&gt;\n* No import of codes allowed, we have to support him in Make in India.&lt;br/&gt;\n* No comments allowed in code, everything should be clean as per Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan. &lt;br/&gt;\n* No redundant variables allowed, less government more governance. &lt;br/&gt;\n* Like his speeches, all codes should start with &lt;strong&gt;mitrooon&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;\n* All codes should end with &lt;strong&gt;acche din aa gaye&lt;/strong&gt;, otherwise it\'s congress rule error.&lt;br/&gt;\n* The programming language is totally case insensitive, because we should not believe discrimination based on higher or lower castes/cases. &lt;br/&gt;\n* No floating point numbers allowed, you can either be right front or left front, there is no mid-way.&lt;br/&gt;\n* you can provide --help flag for very discreet help.\n\n\n## Installation\nTo install, download the repo using: &lt;br/&gt;\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/VPanjeta/ModiScript\n```\nThen add ModiScript to your PATH as:&lt;br/&gt;\n1.

      <li>Title::: "A woman's view of RW trolls and rabid minority hate on /r/indiaspeaks"<br />Body: ' \n\nApart from the high volume and the very skewed noise-content ratio, \n\nI found /r/indiaspeaks to be extremely incongenial to women audience and posters\n\nin general, despite occasional discussions on women\'s issues which \n\nare serious and responsible in nature. I started posting to /r/indiaspeaks within\n\nthe first week of reading /r/indiaspeaks, because I couldn\'t tolerate the \n\nsexist atomosphere, which was a turn-off for me, but it made it all\n\nthe more important to me that one more female voice be heard. (The\n\nnumber of women posters was, and is, quite low.) I personally think\n\na more visible, less passive participation from women is required.\n\nBut the task of electronically interacting with the large population\n\nof /r/indiaspeaks \\-- which, save for a small number of posters, doesn\'t exhibit \n\nany signs of thinking -- \xa0requires energy, time and an ability to \n\nbe amused by mass stupidity.\n\nThe things about /r/indiaspeaks posts that I find offensive to me as a woman are:\n\n\\-- the immature attitude towards women (who are often referred to\n\nas babes, girls, females, etc.) and an adolescent obsession with\n\nwomen and their anatomy; sexist jokes, g.i.f.s of actresses and \n\nmodels are commonplace on /r/indiaspeaks.\n\n\\-- most posts are written from a male perspective, as if the literate/\n\ncorporate/academic world is all-male. \n\n\\-- stereotypical assmptions/statements about women\n\n\\-- the racism that occasionally spurts out towards other minorities --\n\nracist terms like "kallu" used in posts; the assumption that the \n\nwhite mainstream is the desirable (jokes about getting a white \n\nwoman to sleep with or Indian "girls" going out with "americans";\n\n"american", btw, is used as if it meant "white")\n\n \n\nThe women posters on /r/indiaspeaks each has her own style of counteracting\n\nthese attitudes, when she chooses to. My own style has been very\n\nstrident and contemptuous, and I believe it\'s warranted, and given\n\nmy personality, I can\'t manage a friendlier or more composed or\n\nless confrontational style, even though in original posts (not responses\n\nto offensive posts), I\'ve tried to make my points politely. The\n\nresponses to my posts that are feminist in nature ("feminist" is a \n\nbaaaa...d thing to be on /r/indiaspeaks, no matter what its definition) often\n\nfall into one of the following categories:\n\n\\-- I must be anti-Indian, ashamed of being Indian, pro-American,\n\nliberal, "westernized", traitor, etc. etc. A stance against\n\narranged marriage as a social system, sexual harassment (or\n\n"eve-teasing" as it is so innocently termed) in India as opposed\n\nto other countries like the US, the treatment of women in Indian\n\nculture, are often interpreted as disowning one\'s identity\n\nas an Indian.\n\n\\-- women in India are not as unhappy as "feminists" think, how\n\ndo we know that women are not happy to be homemakers, or have\n\ntheir marriages arranged by their families? All efforts on my\n\npart to clarify that this is not about women who\'ve \\*chosen\\* to\n\nbe homemakers, or have arragned marriages ,but about the social\n\nstrucutre that often forces it on many women who \\*don\'t\\* want it,\n\nare often ignored.\n\n\\-- "feminists" complain too much; discrimination, if it exists at\n\nall, it isn\'t as severe. After all, women can get an education, have\n\nteh same opportunities as men, so if they don\'t accomplish as\n\nmuch, it must be an indication of their abilities or commitment,\n\nor both.\n\n\\-- women are at an advantage because of affirmative action policies,\n\netc. Women get preferential treatment, men have to achieve more in \n\norder to get where a woman can get. This is not fair, not fair \n\nat all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n\\-- Things are changing, things are improving. Can\'t you see? \n\n\\-- Women have achieved equality. No need to fight anymore. Cool down.\n\n\\-- So what if women are exploited? Men are too. Look around, men\n\nhave to pay for dinners, hold doors for women, give up their seat in\n\na bus. You can\'t have your cake and eat it too. \n\n\\-- Jesus, can\'t this girl talk about anything else? \n\nI\'ve been left with the feeling that most people aren\'t aware ofthe\n\nbasics of the social dynamics of discrimination, be it against women\n\nor any other minority. Or, if they are, they don\'t want to admit it, \n\nsince their interests are at stake, and these are the status quoists.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n On a lighter note, I have to say that I have had my share of \n\nfun taunting the Indian male psyche on /r/indiaspeaks though I\'ve written\n\non /r/indiaspeaks for a relatively short period (9 months?). I very soon\n\nsensed that an independent, assertive woman instills insecurity and \n\nfright in many Indian men, who have to conjure up images of a \n\ncheap slut, a "westernized traitor" or a lonely, frustrated,\n\nplain, neurotic "oldmaid", in order to pacify themselves and\n\ncontinue to maintain their image of womankind -- virtuous and\n\npassive. Responses which have personal attacks and no substantive\n\ndiscussion are often used to intimidate women. It once happened\n\nthat half of /r/indiaspeaks was drooling over one imaginary Sonia\'s breast size\n\nwhich was accompanied by a comsuming concern over whether \n\nIndian men have larger-or-smaller-than-average-size penis (don\'t\n\nask me how this came about). After one week of witnessing a\n\nmindless orgy of discussions of women as just body parts and\n\na vain attempt to prove that Indian men are not poorly endowed,\n\nI posted a very angry post asking what seemed to me to be very \n\nvalid questions like why /r/indiaspeaks is more concerned with the size of\n\nIndian penis than discrimination, and how /r/indiaspeaks would like it if\n\nthe women showed enormous concern over their dimensions. The next \n\nthing you know, indignant guards of culture and decency are asking\n\nme to take my lewd posts to [alt.sex](https://alt.sex)! And I got one personal email that \n\nsaid "get a vibrator, you woman". And another person who till\n\nthen considered me respectable said bemoaningly that he had\n\nto change his opinion about another decent poster. I had known\n\nall along that women are put in their place by derogatory terms\n\nand attacks on their "character" and morality -- but I couldn\'t\n\nbelieve that after one week of thousands of men publicizing their\n\nmost puerile fantacies about women, \\*my\\* post was considered indecent! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nI had to amuse myself by posting a story about my cat which attacks\n\nme bodily when he knows he can\'t win the game we play by any\n\nfair means (this is actually true -- my pretty little Felix is\n\nas dumb and irrational as the average /r/indiaspeaksan). Then there are \n\nposters who post "jokes" like "why did god create womyn? coz sheep\n\ncan\'t clean up" and the only thing I could think of was the \n\nfollowup "but apparently, sheep can post messages". \n\nSometimes, some men on /r/indiaspeaks playfully shower all their attention\n\non the women posters all without malice and in good spirit and\n\nare not attacked by all the net guards of morality and decency. \n\nAnd, there is no reason to, if it\'s obvious that it was all done\n\nin a congenial way. But I decided to test how /r/indiaspeaks would react if\n\nthe tables were turned and wrote a playfully flirtatious response\n\nto some bloke who I decided was ok on women\'s issues. Sure enough, \n\nsome guy who was posting malicious and irrelevant responses to all \n\nmy posts got all hot and bothered by this moral laxness on my part,\n\nand it was just the reaction I expected, whereas the men usually get\n\naway with good-natured or not-so-good-natured harassment of women\n\non the net.\n\nIt seems to me that /r/indiaspeaks employs the same devices to intimidate \n\nwomen and keep up a male-dominated atmosphere as socieites and\n\ncultures do. If one understands this, it seems to me that the \n\nploys used against a woman poster won\'t have the intended effect \n\nof humiliating her and silencing her. Of course, it\'s not clear\n\nif it\'s worth one\'s time and efforts to try to change the nature\n\nof /r/indiaspeaks with a more vocal, more visible female membership. But I\n\nthink a sizeable number of women posters can keep the blatantly\n\nsexist atmosphere under check and after all, as a forum for \n\nIndians, it\'s a forum for Indian women too, and shouldn\'t have\n\nto be relinquished by women. Having said all this, I still have\n\nto admit that SAWNET is so satisfying to me that I have lost my\n\nmissionary zeal to attack /r/indiaspeaks with my feminist diatribe. \xa0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nOn a more positive note, I\'ve seen as good and as serious discussions\n\non women\'s issues on /r/indiaspeaks as on SAWNET, by both men and women; and I\n\nhave made many friends. I have to say that I enjoyed interacting\n\nwith like-minded Indians on the net after many years of defensive \n\nreserve and indifference to the Indian community at large. And\n\nwhen I have more time, I\'d like to continue to participate in\n\nthe discussions on /r/indiaspeaks.\n\nAs I said earlier, this is not intended to influence anyone\'s\n\nopinions about posting on /r/indiaspeaks, but just my thoughts on how\n\n/r/indiaspeaks in general deals with women, since this topic came up\n\non both /r/indiaspeaks and SAWNET with respect to cross-posting. And\n\nof course, my opinions are not necessarily shared by other\n\nwomen on /r/indiaspeaks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'<br />Author: 'eknath_ranade'  id: 'a4nacm'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a4nacm/a_womans_view_of_rw_trolls_and_rabid_minority/</li>

At some point both people are seen poorly supporting their arguments but they are not factually incorrect. It has become quite common in public exchanges and social media to offer a sleazy counter argument, incorrectly proving yourself to be factually right when the discussion was not ***primarily*** based on facts.\n\nIn this video the BJP supporter is seen quoting his opinions and being arrogant - *rashtrapita honge lekin unn ne desh ke liye kuch nahi kiya ... humein toh modi ko hi vote dena chahiye kyonki unhone sardar patel ki sabse unchi...aur woh \\[Patel\\] vakil the.* Now, whatever. If he thinks that, the statue thing is enough for him to vote for BJP so be it. It\'s his vote afterall. But then it\'s the factual journalist\'s turn, so the facts are - *par vakil toh Nehru bhi the!* So? Is there a statue of Nehru? Maybe this person respects Patel more than Nehru. What has this **fact** got to do with anything?\n\nIn another exchange the reporter says that Patel passed away in 1950 and the first elections were held in 1951-52, so it wasn\'t possible for Patel to be the Prime minister of India, at which point the BJP supporter can\'t say anything. Again, the journalist is factually correct but what most people mean by when they say Patel deserved to be the PM is that he should have been the first PM of the Interim Government of India which was in place *before* 1951. \n\nIMO there\'s not anything to argue about here, from Patel\'s POV (my guess) - he wanted to do what he could with what he had. He respected Gandhi and Nehru as well. Nehru was more of a politician, while Patel was not. But that is not the point of this post....\n\nWhat I want to convey is that videos like these make out common public look like fools, whereas they are just acting on the information they know and what they think matters to them. This video and Rathee\'s "Who to vote" among many other indirectly or directly show that the masses don\'t know what they are doing. And just like politicians, they think like we are like sheep to rally behind their advice.\n\nI think these people perfectly know that people have wildly differing opinion and expectations but choose to show/broadcast these things as this is their sole source of livelihood. Regarding facts and Whatsapp University, the common man doesn\'t have the luxury to spew BS and hide behind a veil of comedy like Kamra. \n\n&amp;#x200B;'<br />Author: 'imaandar'  id: 'a488pc'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a488pc/kunal_kamra_on_twitter_distinguishing_between/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[OC] [Indian Company Acheivements] - Indigo Airlines is one of the best airlines in the world. Today it became the first Indian carrier to have a fleet of 200 aircraft. Few amazing facts'<br />Body: 'I think we should have regular threads about achievements of Indian companies. I will start with this one.\n\nI had recently read a post making fun of Indigo Airlines, and so I thought of mentioning few cool stuff they do.\n\n1. Indigo airlines is a low-cost budget airline which used to only operate domestic flights in India due to a DGCA law, but now they have started operating international flights as well. The main idea of this airline is to give the cheapest flight fares.\n2. Indigo airlines **always try to be on time** even if it means not letting late-comers in, while other airlines will delay the entire plane for some time. In fact, they are the [FOURTH most punctual airlines](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-indigo-among-the-worlds-most-punctual-mega-airlines/articleshow/65027064.cms) in the world. It could have been number one if it weren\'t for the ATC problems in India. The top two are Japanese airlines and Indigo is the only Indian airlines to have featured in such a punctuality list. Being punctual also save money as airlines have to pay airport fee, landing fee etc which are based on a time schedule.\n3. Indigo **only buys the same model** of the plane only. So, unlike several other airlines which has a variety of planes from different manufacturers, Indigo has only has a single type of plane, which is Airbus A320. \\[Not counting the short distance ATR planes(the ones with propeller outside the engine) which Indigo has recently started to buy\\]\n4. ALL of the planes used by Indigo are **BRAND NEW**. Indigo never uses a plane which is more than 7 years old. That is like an unsaid-company rule. If an airline approaches 7 years of life, they retire that plane to the leasing company and buy a new one. For comparison, Delta airlines fleet have an average age of 17 years, United Airlines, Air Canada etc have 14years. British Airways, Air France etc have 13years. Meanwhile Indigo\'s is 5.8years.\n5. Due to this strange policy, Indigo is the **BIGGEST single-order purchaser of planes** in the world. For example, in 2005, Indigo went to an airshow and ordered 100 Airbus A320s, thus surprising everyone. In 2011, in another airshow, they walked in and ordered 180 Airbus A320s. In 2015 Indigo ordered 250 A320s. All of these were the largest single order for planes in the aviation history of the world. No one just goes into the market and say "huh, I am buying 250 planes". As of now, Indigo has ordered 550 Airbus A320s and 50 ATR planes.\n6. Unlike other airlines which have several classes like First class, Business class etc, **Indigo just have one class** \\- Economy class. Since they do not have other classes, they save on not having to carry four flight attendants per plane. And also, they don\'t need to carry specialized food and stuff for first class passengers, plus no need for luxury lounges at airports. This also means that all of their planes look the same and thus can be repurposed for any route.\n7. Indigo is the fastest growing airline in the world(ignoring small airlines with less than 100planes). \n\nThe airline business is very complicated. It is extremely difficult to survive. The margin of profit is razer thin. Can you imagine selling airline tickets for a profit of Rs50 or sometimes at loss? Then there is the problem of bureaucracy as the aviation laws are extremely strict. For example, to prevent Indian companies from competing with Air India, there was a law saying that Airlines registered in India can only operate international flights after operating domestic flights for five years and owning 20 aircraft. The issue is that most profitable routes are international flights. \n\nThen there is the risk of some unforeseeable event happening like oil prices suddenly going up or some plane crashing or flights being grounded due to weather or flights being grounded due to mechanical issues etc. Recently, there was some issue found with the new engines used in Airbus A320s and this meant grounding of all airplanes with that engine, and [Indigo had to ground](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/indigo-planes-grounded-non-availability-of-spares-blamed/articleshow/65518491.cms) 14 of its new planes thus causing a huge loss. \n\nSo, as you can see Airline business is kinda destined to fail, yet, Indigo airlines managed to thrive in the Indian market. I hope one-day indigo grow big enough to become a true world-wide carrier.'<br />Author: 'Fdsn'  id: 'a4233m'<br />Score:77<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a4233m/oc_indian_company_acheivements_indigo_airlines_is/</li>

      <li>Title::: "A hardcore secularist explains the Congress party's problems - how can the congress win hindu votes?"<br />Body: 'Not many sane congressis left, but this one seems to know exactly what\'s going on:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Rahul Gandhi, the president of the  Congress party, needs to understand that an ultra-Left ideology — as  espoused by several of its leaders from time to time — cannot win in a  Hindu-majority country.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When anonymous Modi supporters use foul language against sane voices,  the Congress immediately claims the BJP leadership \'endorses\' it. So  when prominent Congress supporters trash Hindu festivals or rituals, how  does the party expect that the BJP will not pin such behaviour on the  Congress as a whole?\n\n \n\n&gt;The idea of “secularism” in the Indian  context has to be different from the way it is practised in the West.  But the ultra-Left in India — many of whom are aligned with the Congress  — **took even the West’s idea one step ahead, totally distorting  “secularism” to mean insulting the majority community’s rituals,  questioning them, mocking them.** They might believe that such idiocy  helps present themselves as great activists fighting for the society’s  progress. But they also cost the Congress hugely in terms of votes, and  even credibility.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For example, even as Rahul Gandhi visits temples and local Congress  leaders work hard to win people’s trust and make them understand that  Congress is their party too, suddenly, we find an article criticising  Hindu scriptures circulating on social media from *National Herald*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.dailyo.in/voices/congress-bjp-hindutva-pro-muslim-party-leftists-rahul-gandhi-s-gotra/story/1/28168.html](https://www.dailyo.in/voices/congress-bjp-hindutva-pro-muslim-party-leftists-rahul-gandhi-s-gotra/story/1/28168.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis could have easily been written by a BJP supporter, or any neutral observer.

Whether the wannabe westerners like it or not, india is very much a hindu country. Even the most hindu hating secularist can admit that. \n\nI think the only way back for congress is to destroy hinduism. Their credibility with the hindu population is finished; everyone knows their secularism is a joke. The BJP has locked down hinduism for the forseeable future, so what option does the congress party have? They have to attack brahmins, push for conversion by christians and muslims, distort the history of pre-mughal india, and create a civil war along caste lines. Barkha dutt has the right idea. It seems like the only practical solution. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do the congressis here think? Can the congress win back the hindu votes, and if so, how?

We are a union of hundreds of countries and people coming from thousands of different cultures thriving together through a single identity uniting all them. And we want to celebrate the unity of the nation, its culture and values. \nWe want the sub to flow towards the direction where we embrace and appreciate the true essence of our society and celebrate the beauty our traditions and beliefs, at the same time, be open to contemporary ideas and accomplish some positive, impacting changes in the perception of our users.\n\nPolitically we aim to be a neutral hub for people to get different insights so they can judge things better, and direct the sub towards a politically neutral place with the freedom to say what you want, free from shaming and slandering, for your political beliefs; we want to encourage diversity in thought, rather than in diversity of inherited attributes. \nBecause the real threat to a democracy is indifference in thought, not radical doctrines.\n\n \n______________________________________________________________\n\n###And now talking about the sub, we asked for your thoughts and criticism of the sub and how we can fix it.

This is going to be the de facto subreddit for India in a short time and we need much more content than politics.\n\nWe are constantly working on new ideas to encourage users to post more non-political content like the Deepavali Picture [Contest](https://old.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9u5axe/deepavali_picture_contest_prizes_to_be_won/)   and [Satire Saturdays](https://old.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9xzerv/satire_saturdays_battle_of_the_breakfasts/) , The [Debate](https://old.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9xm5pm/rindiaspeaks_debate_defense_and_foreign_policy/) , Historical and cultural Series like [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a2rq3g/series2_princes_maharajas_nizams_of_british/)\n,[RDDs and Bi-weekly Entertainment threads] (https://old.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9wd6wj/biweekly_moviestvshowsanimedocumentariespodcasts/) etc.\n\n We are doing all we can to encourage more and more non-political content, but there is a limit to what we can do, the rest is dependent on the users, at the end of the day the users are the ones that run the sub, and the direction of the sub flows towards what the users are collectively submitting and upvoting.\n\n\n&gt;Proper headlines for news, it\'s always edited to sensationalize. Also, control on unverified tweets.\n\nWe don\'t allow editorialized link titles and we immediately lock threads with edited titles. Please report if you find anything the breaks the rules. \nAlso, regarding unverified twitter accounts, we immediately lock such threads to avoid the spread of false information and unnecessary sensationalism. Please report if you find anything like that.\n\n&gt;Some regulars on this sub are far more intimidating than people on r/India; highly confrontational and too edgy to even entertain a dissenting/critical argument. If you come pounding on people, not many would want to revisit this sub.\n\nWe are aware of the fact that we have some edgy users, but being edgy isn\'t a violation of any rule, we cannot just go around banning them.\nIt\'s best to just downvote, ignore and move on.\nWe do remove comments that violate the sitewide rules and our subreddit rules and give out warnings to users who are excessively abusive but beyond that, we cannot censor anyone for being offensive. \n\n&gt; I came to this sub to find a neutral ground, unlike R/INDIA where it was a left-wing echo chamber fueled by snowflake pc culture and censorship.\nbut here its just posts related to Hinduism and Hindu victimhood that are promoted and everything else gets downvoted. any question or comment against bjp or Hindus or cow-politics gets downvoted and you all just get triggered. this shows that you are no different and just the other side of the same filthy coin, seems like most comments here corroborate what I say\noh also I have to wait 9 minutes to make a new comment\n\nAs of now, the sub is not politically neutral, and we have never claimed to be so however as moderators, we have always been and will be politically neutral when it comes to enforcing rules. \n\n A considerable portion of our users are right-wingers, So such things are expected. What you can do is, correct them and refute their arguments, or downvote and move on. We can not tell people what\'s right and what\'s wrong. Things like this are a numbers game, our sub is relatively small compared to mainstream subreddits, hence there is a noticeable bias, once we grow to about 40-50 thousand subscribers, things will move more towards the centre. Which is what we are aiming for.\n\nRegarding the commenting, It\'s not under our control. Those are some things imposed by Reddit.\n\n&gt;We cannot be toxic like r/India. Very few people with opposing political views talk here and do not engage for long because they get bombarded with too many replies and rebuttals.\nWould be good if we could get more people who already don’t align themselves at pro-Hindutva.\nI would also like a few basic introductions of the why this sub exists and it to be a forever argument.\n\nAgain, It\'s a numbers game, and it will get better with a higher number of users. We are doing what we can to drive users towards the sub, and we are letting the sub grow organically. Also, There is something you guys can do:\nThe best way you can contribute to the growth of the sub is to honestly endorse us in other subreddits, And give us a shoutout. That will encourage users to check out the sub and will greatly help us. \nAnd the rest of your queries are addressed above\n\n&gt;if the mention of r/India is not allowed, don\'t allow crossposts from there. if people want they can see other discussions.\n\nThe reason why don\'t allow it is, It always causes unnecessary drama.\nWhenever its mentioned people don\'t miss a chance to throw in baits to stir up things and derail the topic at hand. We don\'t want that at any cost. That\'s it.\n\nOther than that we allow cross posts from any sub, as long as they are relevant. And usually, crossposts from this particular sub are from users seeking help, and its sensible extend help, feel free to do it.\n\n&gt; har agle thread main likha hota hai locked\n\nReasons why lock threads:\n\n1. Editorialised title\nWhen you are submitting links, Please type in the exact title mentioned by the publication. If you want to submit it with a different title or with a comment, Submit it as a self-post with some text/comments.\n    \n2. Repost\nIf the link is already submitted, We lock to avoid duplicates.\nWhen we do this we always provide the link to the main post in the comments. \n\n3. High Number Rule 1 Violations\nThis one is quite rare, but yeah. Sometimes we have to lock threads when things get heated.\n\n\n&gt;This sub, when it was started was supposed to be a minimally moderated sub where the community decided what sort of content they want to see. I\'m slowly starting to see more and more rules being made which will slowly make it another r/India clone.\n\nThings change with scale, people change with scale, cultures change with scale. The keyword here is \'Scale\'.\nAnytime a large number of people gather at a place, the number of things that can go wrong exponentially goes up. Back when humans lived as nomads, there were no rules and everyone was an anarchist.\nOnce people gathered together and forming societies laws, rules and regulations were introduced to avoid turmoil. And that is exactly what\'s happening here. We didn\'t have many users in the beginning and everyone in the sub knew each other, and people were nice, things were easier to manage, and that has changed and will change even more in the future, with the inflow of more users there will be more clashes of opinions, giving the opportunity to more chaos. \n\nAnd as moderators, we are trying our best to keep this sub as open as possible to a diverse set of people and beliefs at the same time keep the balance. In fact, we are very strict with each other and try to keep each other accountable for our actions as mods.\n\nAnd we believe our job is to review the content and ensure things are in order, not curate it to fit our individual tastes; as it is community subject.\n\n The state of the sub is dependent on users and their contributions i.e What you guys post, comment, upvote and downvote.\nDo your bit. It greatly helps.\n\n\n\n&gt;The sub is going good just make people participate in good faith i.e ask users here to be less confrontational &amp; edgy.\n\n&gt; Secondly more NP and Economy.\n\n&gt; Thirdly, that lock post rule is more stupid than RaGa so do something about it. Like repost is allowed if the Submission doesn\'t reach the front page. Or if the link has been posted in the night and therefore there hasn\'t been any discussion so it should be allowed to be posted again.\n\nWe do encourage users to participate in good faith, but not everybody does.\nSo again, downvote trolls and abusive comments. With enough people,  we can easily fix it.\n\nWe usually Lock posts that have less engagement and allow posts with higher engagement although it\'s posted later.\n\n&gt;Add some tl;dr bot for news links. The sub is growing. Most people are falling for the click-bait headline that news sources rely on\n\nThat\'s a good suggestion. We will keep this in mind.\n\n&gt;I think there should be regulations on Twitter links submissions. Like some links are allowed by some unverified accounts just because users of this sub agrees with. Its like if the majority are ok with it then its allowed if not then not ok. Why make it agreeable only to the majority? Why not to everyone. Accounts like @squintneon are allowed. Its neither a journalist nor a personal account or any group seems like a fake account. Most of its tweets are just trolling but it is allowed just because users agree with it.\n\n\n\n\nWe do have strong [twitter rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/indiaspeaks/wiki/rules#wiki_twitter_policy). And allow only verified personalities, and have an exception for a select few that are trusted sources. If you have any complaints about this, please let us know in the MMDs, in the sidebar.\n\nAlso, if you have any twitter personality who posts useful content but not verified, feel free to suggest, backed with some strong reasons. We will add them.\n\n\n&gt;R@ndia for all its faults has good tech discussions, Flipkart and Amazon sale threads. Why can\'t we have more such things here?\n\nWe are actively trying new non-political topics and ideas. Will surely do this. \n\n&gt;My suggestions are\n\n&gt;1. Maybe reprimand users who stoop to insults like \'liberal retards\' etc. It\n\n&gt;2. Some publications and websites only support one type of views and rarely unbiased. They push a single agenda. That can\'t be good for balance.\n\n\n1. We cannot. Already addressed why above.\n2. We understand, But again, We review the content, we can not curate it.\nIts dependent on the users. It will evolve once we are big enough.\n\n\n&gt;1. Enforce "No-politics" day at least once a week. Too much shitty politics discussion that too on westernised shit like \'left vs right\'.\n2. Zero tolerance policy towards "science" related discussions. Don\'t encourage any posts which have a tone of \'boastful\' superiority of ancient Indian scientific discoveries. The aim here is, ancient Indian science should be discussed more as a \'history\' rather than current day \'science\' subject.\n3. Don\'t allow crime news on the sub. This will end up in rabbit-hole of gross generalizations of identities of actors involved in the sad news.\n\n\n1. We can try that. Will keep in mind.\n2. That\'s quite rare. But we do remove submissions from non-trusted sources.\n3. Here\'s what you guys can do.\n\n      a. Start submitting more positive news to turn attention from the negativity.\n\n b. Ignore crime related new if you are not interested, urge others to do the same. \n\n c. Focus and engage more in Non-political, Positive submissions.\n\n&gt;If you lock a post, citing duplicates, please link the other. Follow a consistent policy that you will always lock either a) the one with lesser votes or b) the earlier/older one. Can\'t argue either way.\n\n&gt;I may be wrong, but I see a larger number of posts - locked. And at times, the topics seem sensitive that it seems the mods are taking a very preventive approach before things flare up. The sad part is you see this locked even barely with 1-2 comments. Instead, I feel, this can be handled in better ways. For e.g. you can create a new flair like "ModConcernForXX"  (whatever you feel XX might be) and let is serve as a warning that if this discussion goes in the bad direction, you will lock it after Y number of posts.\n\nAddressed above.\n\n&gt;Creation of dynamic flairs (short-lived 1-2 weeks). The mods can decide what the trending topics are (for e.g. meToo in recent times, create such a flair and use it for that period). The mods here already show a lot of self-discipline, so I am sure they can follow some rules that max of 2 such dynamic flairs per week. The idea is that we can just see or not see them.\n\nThat\'s a good suggestion. We will surely consider it.\n\n&gt;Talking about mod self-discipline ( this is huge one so bear with me) I would love to see some statistics on how many you ban etc per week. (I wish Reddit itself did it on a per sub basis, but that will hurt advertising so...) Whatever, some stats on new subs/month, bans/month would be good\n\n- As of now, we have five users that are temporarily banned, for multiple rule violations.\n- The longest ban we\'ve given out is 180 days. \n\n- Only two users till date have been perma-banned, for Reddit sitewide rule violations. i.e Multiple counts of threats and calling for violence etc.\n\n- [ Here\'s the link to our mod logs.](https://r.go1dfish.me/r/IndiaSpeaks/about/log#?theme=IndiaSpeaks)\n \n We\'ve made it public, as we are committed to transparency.\n\n- [Here\'s the list of bans and warnings](https://old.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/wiki/safeguard_policy).\n\n\n- [Here\'s the list of posts we\'ve approved](https://old.reddit.com/r/uncensorship/search?sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;q=flair%3Aapprovelink%40IndiaSpeaks):\n\n \n\n- [Here\'s the list of posts we\'ve removed\n](https://old.reddit.com/r/uncensorship/search?sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;q=flair%3Aremovelink%40IndiaSpeaks)\n \n\n\n&gt;Regarding the point of mentioning r/India - I know the mods don\'t want this to be a meta-sub. But, the point is that sub will almost always have a higher number of posts (for whatever reasons) and there are many of us who are banned there and don\'t really want to create new ids, so it should be ok to continue the discussion on that topic here.\n\nIt is. Please feel free to crosspost and discuss. We encourage it as long as users are following the guidelines. \n________________________________________________________\n\n\n###And now a few more things we want to address:\n\n1.**Be Welcoming To New Users.**\n\nThe sub is growing and more newbies are actively trying to participate, don\'t be harsh on anyone if they are wrong or says something you disagree with, correct them and move on. \nJust because someone has different political views doesn\'t mean they are trolls from another sub. Share your disagreements or downvote or report if necessary.\n\nIf you see another user abusing or harassing someone, downvote and report. We will take it from there.\n\n2.**Follow The Rules.**\n\nThe point of having rules is to ensure things are in order. They aren\'t there to dictate people about what they should do, they merely exist as guidelines we expect users to understand.\n\nBasically, the Tl;dr of our subreddit rules are:\n\na. [Don\'t spread hate or call for violence.](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)\n\nb. Don\'t edit the titles of links you submit. \n\nc. No meta-discussion about other subs.\n\n   i.e don\'t make comments on the mods or users of other subs.\n\nd. Meta discussion about our sub is only allowed in MMD, which is always posted in the sidebar.\n\n\nThat\'s it.\n________________________________\n\n\nThank you for reading till the end.\nPlease feel free to comment below if you have any questions.\n'<br />Author: 'Nervous_Wallaby'  id: 'a3orj9'<br />Score:81<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a3orj9/le_indiaspeaks_manifesto/</li>

From then to Feb 2013 barmaid sat on it. On 12th Feb 2013 the game was up when the Finnmecanica(sp?) CEO himself was arrested and then "honest" Anthony ordered the probe. \n\nOnly in Jan 2014, after the trial began in Milan did Barmaid cancel the deal. \n\nThis lying article alleges that Christian Michel is innocent and Mudiji is forcing him to confess. \n\nYeah, except Honest Anthony himself declared there was a scam. In Sept 2014 the CBI announced that Michel had recvd eur 30 mn to facilitate the bid. So Barmaid is contradicting herself now?\n\nAlso [here are the list of firms blacklisted by the MOD](https://mod.gov.in/sites/default/files/firmshold.pdf),\n\nBarmaid only blacklisted Agustawestland and Leonardo SPA. The parent company, Finmeccania was never blacklisted by Barmaid. \n\nIt is interesting that the dates for blacklisting are 3rd July 2014 &amp; 22 Aug 2014. So it appears as though Barmaid never even blacklisted Agustawestland it was the Modi govt that did it. The company bidding now is Finnmecanica. \n\n\nEdit.

      <li>Title::: "[Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Trump buys peace with IK, Bangladesh elections, and you'll never guess who built a bullet train before us!"<br />Body: 'Welcome to a new edition of the Biweekly Geopolitics Thread! This thread is meant to discuss International issues from around the world. You can discuss war, diplomacy, trade deals, sporting events, security conferences, etc. The discussion does ***not*** have to be related to India.\n\nHere are some topics of interest to get the discussion started, which have not been widely discussed so far in the sub. Feel free to bring up anything else!\n\n# Three stories from India\'s neighborhood\n\n1. [Trump asks Pakistan to help the US fight the Taliban in Afghanistan](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/03/politics/trump-khan-letter/index.html)\n\nAs US Special Representative for AfPak Zalmay Khalilzad headed to Islamabad to talk peace in Afghanistan, the State Department revealed that President Trump sent a letter to Imran Khan, asking for his full supporting to ending the sanctuary that the Taliban and Al Qaeda receive in Pakistan. This comes just weeks after a bitter war of tweets between the two leaders. The US depends exclusively on Pakistan to transport supplies and weapons to its troops in Afghanistan.\n\n2. [Nepal passes tough new tax law on gambling](https://calvinayre.com/2018/12/04/casino/nepal-legislation-casino-tax-scofflaws/)\n\nUnknown to many of us in India, gambling is legal across Nepal *for tourists*, and casinos usually operate with licenses in 5-star hotels. While the casinos have to pay a tax, many (perhaps most) of them do not, and the government finds it difficult to catch the defaulters. The new law makes the hotel, and not the casino operator, liable for paying the tax, and failure to do so gives the government the power to essentially stop the hotel\'s functioning. \n\n3. [Khaleda Zia\'s nomination papers for Bangladesh elections rejected](https://www.foxnews.com/world/bangladesh-govt-opposition-leader-zia-cant-contest-polls)\n\nBangladesh is holding a national election on Dec. 30, and campaigning is on full swing... except for the leader of the country\'s largest opposition party, the BNP. Khaleda Zia, former three-time PM of the country, is cooling her heels in jail, having been convicted for two corruption cases carrying terms of 10 and 7 years. She filed her papers to run for three constituencies, but those have been rejected because the country\'s constitution bars anyone sentenced to jail for longer than 2 years from contesting elections until 5 years after their release. The previous election was boycotted by the opposition, which led to European observers questioning the results. Now, the BNP alleges that the election is becoming a sham with their leader not being allowed to contest on what it claims are politically trumped up charges. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Three stories from the world\n\n1. [Mexico\'s new President vows to use army for fighting street crime](http://time.com/5469025/mexico-crime-army-violence-murder/)\n\nMexico\'s new President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador assumed office earlier this week, and one of the first things he did was to make a U-turn on deploying the military to fight rising crime in Mexico, largely fueled by drug cartels that traffic narcotics and people through Mexico and into the US. Obrador criticized military deployments within the country while campaigning, but now says that the scale of corruption within civilian law enforcement is so great that the army must be brought in. The move will require a Constitutional Amendment, and his party is just short of having the necessary numbers in the legislature. \n\n2. [France suspends fuel tax hike after violent Paris riots](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/12/04/france-yellow-jacket-tax-protests/2200073002/)\n\nMassive riots that injured over 100 people roiled Paris earlier this week. The protesters, called the "yellow jacket" movement after the reflective vests that they wear, are protesting against increases in fuel and electricity taxes imposed by pro-business President Macron as part of his plan to cut the country\'s carbon emissions. But the protesters have also directed their ire at Macron in general, who is seen as a darling of the global elite and totally out of touch with common people. His approval rating stands at just 26%. President Trump also waded in to the matter, emphasizing the importance of keeping fuel prices low for economic growth and once again criticizing the Paris Climate Agreement. \n\n3. [Africa gets its first high speed rail](https://www.railwaygazette.com/news/news/africa/single-view/view/africas-first-high-speed-line-inaugurated.html) (yes, before India)\n\nThe western African country of Morocco inaugurated Africa\'s first high speed train, running at a speed of 320 kmph and more than halving the travel time between its major cities. Funded in part by loans from France, the African Development Bank, and an Arab fund, the rail line is about 180 km long and involved the construction of new viaducts as well as upgrading of existing rail sections. The initial agreement for the project was signed between France and Morocco in 2007, and it has now come to fruition. The rolling stock comes from France\'s Alstom. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnjoy!\n\nवसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्'<br />Author: 'icecoolsushobhan'  id: 'a3kn7y'<br />Score:55<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a3kn7y/biweekly_geopolitics_thread_trump_buys_peace_with/</li>

A council of Regency conducted the administration until 1894, when the Maharaja obtained powers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Madho Rao Sindhia\'s Craze for Chandelier:***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaharaja of Gwalior decided before the turn of the century to ornament his palace with a chandelier carefully calculated to **surpass in dimension the largest chandelier in Buckingham Palace**. Once he\'d ordered it in Venice, however, someone pointed out to the Maharaja that the roof of his palace might not support its weight. \n\nHe resolved the problem by **having his heaviest pachyderm hoisted to the palace roof with a specially constructed crane.** When the roof failed to collapse under the animal\'s weight, the Maharaja announced correctly, it would turn out - that it would support his new chandelier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Madho Rao Sindhia\'s Craze for Electric Trains:***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe passion of the Maharaja of Gwalior, who ruled over one of the best run states in India, was electric trains. Even in his wildest Pre-Christmas fantasies, a young boy could not conjure up in electric train set to rival the Maharaja\'s. \n\nIt was laid out out of **250 feet of solid silver rails** set on a mammoth iron table at the centre of the palace banquet hall. Special tunnels cut in the palace walls prolonged the tracks  into the royal kitchen. \n\nThe Maharaja\'s guests were placed around the table and the ruler sat at its head, presiding over a mammoth control panel that bristled with levers, accelerators\' switches and alarm signals. These controlled the trains that delivered dinner to the prince\'s guests. By manipulating his control panel, the prince could pass the vegetables, send the potatoes shuttling through the banquet hall, or order an express to the kitchens for a second helping for a hungry guest.\n\n***He could also, with the flick of a switch, deprive a guest of his dessert by sending the dessert trains speeding past his waiting plate.***\n\nOne evening, in the midst of a formal banquet in honor of the Viceroy, the prince\'s control panel short-circuited. While their Excellencies looked on aghast, his electric trains ran amok, racing from one end of the banquet hall to the other, indifferently sloshing gravy roast beef and a puree of peas over the Maharaja\'s guests. It was a catastrophe without parallel in the annals of the railway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Maharaja of Gwalior killed over **1400 tigers** in his life time. and was the author of a work destined for-a limited audience, A Guide to Tiger Shooting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Loyalty to the British:***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGwalior sent the beleaguered British three battalions of infantry and a hospital ship in 1917. All those forces were raised, equipped, paid for and maintained by the rulers themselves, not the government of India.\n\nThe grateful British acknowledged their debt to their faithful and generous vassals\' by showering them with honours and the baubles they loved best of all, iewel-studded decorations. Gwalior, Cooch Behar and Patiala were accorded the honour of riding as honorary ADCs beside the royal carriage of Edward VII at his coronation. Oxford and Cambridge conferred their degrees, honorary and earned, rulers and their progeny.\n\nFive rulers - Hyderabad, Gwalior, Kashmir, Mysore and Baroda - were entitled to the supreme accolade, 21 guns. \n\nThe Maharaja of Gwalior married a commoner the brilliant daughter of a civil servant, and moved out of his father\'s vast palace. Unhappily for those men and many others like them who ruled their states responsibly and ably, the public would always associate the maharajas of India with the excess and extravagances of a handful among them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Post 1947 what was formed as "Madhya Bharat" became Madhya Pradesh***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGeorge Jivajirao Sindhia  (1925–1948) ruled the state of Gwalior as absolute monarch until shortly after India\'s independence on 15 August 1947. The rulers of Indian princely states had the choice of acceding to either of the two dominions (India and Pakistan) created by the India Independence Act 1947 or remaining outside them. Jivajirao signed a covenant with the rulers of the adjoining princely states that united their several states to form a new state within the union of India known as Madhya Bharat. This new covenanted state was to be governed by a council headed by a ruler to be known as the Rajpramukh. Madhya Bharat signed a fresh Instrument of Accession with the Indian dominion effective from 15 June 1948. Jivajirao became the first rajpramukh, or appointed governor, of the state on 28 May 1948. He served as Rajpramukh until 31 October 1956, when the state was merged into Madhya Pradesh. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Source***:\n\n**Freedom at Midnight** , *Dominique Lapiene and Larry Collins*\n\n**Wikipedia**'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'a2rq3g'<br />Score:46<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a2rq3g/series2_princes_maharajas_nizams_of_british/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The largest Combined Arms operation began today. You know it as the 1971 East Pakistan war. A blow by blow account of this operation'<br />Body: "The Indian victory against Pakistan in 1971 was one of the greatest examples of operational art and the largest combined arms operation after World War 2. It was a masterpiece of Political objective, Strategic vision, operational planning and tactical execution.\n\nIt is important to understand why it was seen as such a great victory. Warfare is usually divided into Positional attrition warfare (think World War 1, Iran-Iraq war or even the India-China war / India-Pakistan war of 1965) or maneuver driven situational warfare. The concept of maneuver warfare was propounded (at around the same time) by various European warfare experts, B.H.Liddel Hart (England) and Mikail Tucahavesky (shot dead by Stalin, and one of THE finest military minds the world has ever seen) was it’s greatest exponent. His theory was,\n\nAttack on a broad front &gt; use air superiority and arty to make holes in the enemy line &gt; Use this penetration to feed in highly mobile troops who would use maneuver to keep the enemy off balance. The Positional warfare suggests that you can win a war only by crushing the enemies main point of defense (mostly frontally – the British were a firm believer in this theory) while indirect / maneuver warfare suggests that you avoid the strong points, and hit the vulnerable rear of the enemy, keep him off balance, deny him his CCI structure and win the war by using terrain and encirclement (read up on Cannae or Kharkov / Smolensk for examples of encirclement warfare) .\n\nIndia which had favoured the first theory in all it’s wars till then used the second theory to great effect.\n\nThe Planning:\n\nIn March 1971, Indira Gandhi came back to power with a resounding mandate, and was faced with an immediate crisis! The Bangladeshi refugee problem. A genocide in East Pakistan (estimated deaths vary from 3 million to 4 million) was pushing a massive amount of refugees into India. Her cabinet (especially Defence minister Jagjivan Ram) favoured immediate invasion to settle this crisis and to discuss this, she summoned the CoAS – Sam ‘Bahadur’ Manekshaw. In a very interesting and stormy meeting, she told him to prepare for an invasion of East Pakistan. Sam Bahadur point blank refused to entertain this and offered to resign straight away. Indira who was used to getting her way, did not like this resistance but asked her advisors to leave the room and had Manekshaw speak his mind freely. He laid down three reasons why he preferred an invasion in the closing months of the year. In this he was going against both Jagjivan Ram and Indira Gandhi and he was aware of this, but he refused to be a party to a botched up invasion.\n\n• The Passes with China would be closed because of snow, making it difficult for the Chinese to intervene. In June (when Indira was asking him to invade) the passes would be clear and would need a diversion of efforts to defend these.\n\n• Monsoon (in this he was proven very right) and the resulting quagmire. The Russian word for it was called “Raptistuta” and means a sea of mud! Mud is the worst enemy for movement (even hard snow can be managed) as it stalls movement to a very low speed. Monsoon would also mean rivers would be in spate so bridging &amp; fording them would be eminently more challenging. August that year saw the worst tropical storm on record till date. It inundated whole parts of Bangladesh and killed half a million Bangladeshi’s.\n\n• The last was building up a strong and valid cassus belli (cause for war). If India was seen as the aggressor, sanctions would cripple an already crippled economy. It needed to make a case for itself. In the mean time it could use the Bangladeshi govt in exile (based in Calcutta) and the newly created Mutki Bahini to drum up support for itself.\n\nIndira Gandhi agreed to his conditions and set about on a whirlwind tour of diplomacy. She went to Moscow, US, UK &amp; France. She told the governments there that the situation was untenable, but Pakistan was a strong member of the SEATO and CENTO so the western democracies (in a blatant case of hypocrisy) stood by idly while a massive genocide was being perpetrated. Only the USSR recognized the problem, and shipped arms &amp; ammunitions to India to build up her stockpile. India also signed a 20 year treaty of friendship and mutual assistance (this was to prevent any actions by the NATO / US / China)\n\nMankeshaw then went to work. He created a JIC (IB+RAW+Military intelligence) and a Joint Planning Command (India did not and still does not have a Combined Chief of Staffs like other nations do) to bring the civilians, army, navy and airforce together in the planning. Overall command was given to Lt Gen J.S.Arora who was CiC of the Eastern Command.\n\nOrder Of Battle\n\nThe OOB was as follows, Eastern Command &gt; 3 Army Corps (2nd, 33rd and 4th) &gt; 5 Infantry divisions + 2 Mountain that were on defensive mode. Attached to the infantry divs we had the equivalent of 1 armored division (broken up into regiments). Pakistan had roughly 3 Infantry divs and 2 divisions worth of paramilitary and a brigade of armour.\n\nThe odds were roughly 2:1 favouring India (conventionally 4:1 was recommended, 3:1 was the bare minimum). In the air India had total supremacy in the east(which was vital) and marginal superiority in the west.\n\nThe Mukti Bahini had roughly 60,000 numbers of irregulars. They played the exact same role the French partisans played in WW2 after Normandy. During the war, the Mukti Bahini contributed to the speed of advance of the Indians by providing ready labor and intelligence on the deployment of Pakistani forces. The MB sabotaged Pakistani lines of communication, they struck at weak points (in the rear) with brigade sized forces and caused the Pakistani defence to spread itself thin.\n\nThe Indian Plan\n\nIt was multi layered in it’s approach. Attack in depth to force the Pakistanis to thin themselves out, Cutoff river crossings (to prevent reinforcements and retreat from reaching the Pakistani troops) and finally capture the two key ports in Bangladesh.\n\nThere was one major element of genius provided by J.S.Arora. He changed the Schwerpunkt from the logical south to the more difficult east. The South had it’s base in Bengal, had access to major railway lines and depots and Lt Gen Niazi (Pakistani commander) anticipated the main focus (Schwerpunkt) to be in this sector and aligned his defences accordingly. The East had everything going against it. The main base was inn Tripura, supply / logistics chains had immense difficulties but it was also the closest route to Dhaka.\n\nJ.S Arora allocated the strongest force to the East and the weakest force to the South (the exact opposite of the Pakistani defensive alignment). This has it’s roots in classical warfare including WW2 and the battle of Cannae (which was positional warfare for it’s time). Operation Barbarossa focused it’s Schwerpunkt in the Centre and North while Stavka (Soviet high command aka Stalin) anticipated the key thrust in the South. The German approach to indirect warfare surprised the Russians and caused them a massive loss in men, space and equipment.\n\nThe Pakistani Plan\n\nCounter offensive in the West and a tiered defense in the East using river lines and cities as strong points (very similar in concept to the Russian defense in WW2 – use river lines and force attritional warfare on the invader. Retreat to city holdfasts and engage troops in urban warfare. Hold out and delay the offensive till such time the UN forced a cease fire (like it had done in the Israeli wars).\n\nIn Bangladesh, Niazi proposed retreating to just outside Dhaka and holding a region around Dhaka (using river lines and Dhaka as a central pivot). The Pakistani establishment rejected this. Once again we have parallels in World War 2. Poland had the option to withdraw it’s forces to the Vistula line, use Warsaw as a pivot and defend a limited area, both these sound ideas were rejected because…”Nationalism”! Not one inch of land would be surrendered etc etc. Niazi went for (as the Indian side had hoped) the WW2 Russian strategy of defending some fortified towns (or as Hitler called them – Festungs) and river lines (bridges).\n\nThe idea was to cut down on the Indian freedom of movement by forcing them to engage in urban warfare. They did make a fatal flaw in their planning. They assumed that India would fight 10 different “Stalingrads”, and never reach Dhaka so they never allocated troops to defend Dhaka (the same mistake Hitler made in WW2 with respect to the defence of Berlin)\n\nThe War\n\n• 3rd December, Operation Chingis goes in. Pakistan launches a preemptive strike on Indian airfields (in the West). The IAF fights a holding campaign before launching a massive bombardment operation the next morning. In the East, elements of 33 Corps go into action, their objective is to take a vital railway junction. Hilli however was one of the first echelons of Pakistan’s defenses and was very well prepared and supplied. The battle quickly became a battle of attritional warfare, however 340 Brigade spotted an opening in the flank and in a very German Blitzkrieg type of operation, formed combat groups (on the spot) of tanks and infantry and exploited the gap, and these combat groups raced to the river lines that Pakistan had intended to use as defensive strongpoints. Faced with Indians in the rear and forward of them, the resistance quickly collapsed.\n\n• In the South, using maneuver warfare (as against to positional warfare used by 33 Corp) 2 Corps makes rapid progress, 2 Corps launches a pincer attack using two infantry divisions to envelop Pakistani defences. They keep pushing on towards their target without giving the defenders time to rest and redraw their defensive lines. 2 Corps used the classic maneuver tactics used by Germany in WW2, Israel in the Sinai. They ignored strong points while rushing the rear of the enemy lines (the OMG of Russian doctrine came into play). The infantry pushed on into Pakistani frontline positions who attempted to withdraw to prepared lines only to find them occupied by Indian troops. Defense spectacularly collapsed in this sector.\n\n• In the East, 4 Corps (the largest Indian grouping with 3 divisions) and a bold leader pretty much repeated what 2 Corps did. The CO (Lt Gen Sagat Singh) used the Russian concept of Maskirovka and set up a feint attack towards Chittagong, this drew Pakistani defenders (already facing 3:1 odds) to Chittagong weakening their centre. Here we come across a massive feat of arms – Airlifting of 2 entire combat equipped brigades. Rather than contest the Meghna river bridges, Singh sidestepped the exceedingly strong Pakistani defences by getting 2 brigades airlifted and dropped across the river (right into Pakistani lines). The eastern sector was decided as the Schwerpunkt (the focus point of the offensive) and it showed. The Indian troops rapidly outflanked prepared Pakistani positions, artillery was used to bombard these pockets into submission, the IAF flew CAS (Combat Air Support) / Interdiction missions all of which freed the infantry and armour to keep moving. This was classic Blitzkrieg minus only the Stuka sirens.\n\nThe Pakistani forces were in headlong retreat towards Dhaka and this posed a big problem. If they gained the Dhaka region, they could organize a very stubborn defense which would cost 1000’s of Indian lives to capture. To prevent this, 2 Para was dropped BEHIND enemy lines into the region of Tangail. They were very less in number, and if the Pakistanis had grouped up and attempted to fight their way through, 4 Para could have been decimated, but thanks to the Indian Blitzkrieg tactic, the Pakistani C&amp;C set up was decimated and they could not mount a cohesive response. After the drop, the demoralization (and destruction) of organized resistance was complete.\n\nPsycops\n\nThe Pakistani resistance still numbered in the 1,00,000 and pockets could take a lot of Indian lives to break, so India went on a pysop campaign. Pakistani wirless networks were spammed with “surrender and live” messages (India had cracked the cipher used in East Pakistan before the war itself), Sam Bahadur himself went on air and told Pakistanis that if they surrendered they would be treated honourably, and this cracked any vestige of resistance. Pakistani soldiers began surrendering to the Indian army in droves. Niazi signed the instrument of surrender (a bitter man) on 16th December and went into captivity, along with him 91,000 Pakistani troops also went into captivity.\n\nSources\n\n• Maj Gen D.K Palit's Lightning Campaign.

      <li>Title::: 'Saturday Satire: "Pakistan concedes Kashmir after its Goat Army lost to Indian Cow Army. Imran Khan "Now we only await for our share of Biryani"'<br />Body: '&gt;**Namaste friends,**\n\n&gt;Welcome to the Saturday Satire: Article Day. \n\n&gt;Today we discuss a Satire article &amp; Ramifications of the news piece. \n\n\n\n##Beasts of Burden\n\n------\n\nAfter much thought and to preserve the precious life of humans, India and Pakistan accepted to have a "One-War-to-Win-\'em-All" with the beast of of choice.\n\nIndian 100 strong holy cow Battalion was faced with 300 strong Battalions of the Goat army. They carried a huge burden, of resolving the long dispute.\n\nIt was a fierce battle, after hours of staring at each other and eating up all the grass at the battle area. Our reporters are currently not informed by the spokesperson the details, but the Pakistani Bakre were routed. \n\nWhen asked for a statement from the Indian battalion, they had this to say, \n&gt;**"Moo"**\n\nThe vanquished goat army commander responded with, \n&gt;**"Baa"**\n\nThe Neutral Norwegian  observer observed, \n&gt;"This carnage can only bring dinner to the table for both warring nations. The world is glad that this is now resolved. It was a bizarre and thought provoking decision from the governments of both nations to decide to resolve the conflict using their their holy animals. Kashmir was a religious battle as much as it was Political. Who better to resolve them than the symbols of these religions." \n\n#Pakistan disappointed\n-----\n\nPM Imran khan  at a press conference has said, \n&gt;"This is indeed a great loss for us. We will request for Biryani as a compensation from the neutral observers and India."\n\nThere are reports which suggest some goats may have been violated en route to the battle field. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Qureshi made a statement, \n&gt;"We shall investigate the accusation of patloon ka nada dheeli."\n\nWhen our reporters further pressed for more information, Mr Qureshi said, \n&gt;**"Champions Trophy Yaad hai?"**\n\n\n\n#India Rejoices\n---\n\nThere are celebrations. Peace is finally achieved by animals. Some call it poetic justice while others call it obvious. The irony that a group of farm animals have solved the problem that has plagued the subcontinent for decades is not lost on anyone. \n\nThere are some who complain though. PETA has written letters to the governments of both nations. Their spokesperson said, \n\n&gt; This is the epitome of animal rights abuse. Forcing them into wars of humans? Since it is not under Amenesty internatinal\'s jurisdriction, we are going to write a report to the UN even. And all this talk about Biryani? How dare they! The only biryani that is to be served should be vegetable biryani.\n\nOur correspondent attempted to correct PETA representative that there is no such thing as a vegetable biryani, upon which she was kicked out of the press conference. \n\nChief Minister Yogi Adityanath (UP) conveyed his joy, \n\n&gt; Gau mata ki Jai. \n\nPM Modi was unavialble to comment as he is currently in a foreign trip. This section would be updated as soon as we get a tweet from the PM.\n\n#Claims of ownership from UP\n\n----\n\nThe wakf boards have insisted that, since the semen doner for birthing the cows that went to battle was a bull named Abdul Ali Hussain, they claim the victory is an army of the Ummah and by god\'s intervention it needs to be govered as per sharia law. \n\nAlthough there is some internal contoversy between the boards if Abdul was a Shia or Sunni. Its not always sunny in Uttar Pradesh. \n\n#Feminist rejoice\n\n----\n\nFeminist activists have put up statements saying this is indeed a joy to all women accross the world that the war of men was solved by women (Cows). They are claiming inheritance and ruling rights over Kashmir, and also a quota as this is only fair.\n\nThey also suggest the cow be allowed to stand for state elections. \n\n#Troubles are not over yet\n\n---\n\nRSS and other competing organizations are claiming victory for this as now Cow is the symbol of their own organisation. It is to be seen what kind of a governing formula would be implemented or would it be governed as a union territory by the pigs from delhi. \n\n#Aftermath\n\n----\n\nThe Supreme court has asked for people\'s opinion on what are the ramifications of this victory. How things are perceived to change. While the supreme court asks for consultation, we have been informed that it will do whatever it wants, and those who complain will be put in Jail for contemt. Those who dont give serious responses will also be put in jail for contempt. Those who are sarcastic will also be put in jail for contept. Those who are not responding, will not be discriminated against. Jail. Contempt.\n\nThe Parliament may pass a bill in the near future that India will now considered a Jail. It is easier to call the country a Jail, rather than put majority of them in a Jail. This bill is still being drafted. \n\n- /r/IndiaSpeaks Press Correspondent'<br />Author: 'metaltemujin'  id: 'a28iy0'<br />Score:21<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a28iy0/saturday_satire_pakistan_concedes_kashmir_after/</li>

The state officials apparently kept the rulers from knowing the conditions of the Muslim peasantry in the Valley\n\nLawrence in particular criticised the state officials who belonged to the Kashmiri Pandit community.[19] Lawrence provided evidence that while many of the Kashmiri Pandit officials may have been ''individually gentle and intelligent, as a body they were cruel and oppressive.'' Scholar Ayesha Jalal states that the Maharajahs nurtured ties with Kashmiri Pandits and their Dogra kinsfolk in Jammu to trample on the rights of their subjects.[20] Christopher Snedden also states that the Kashmiri Muslims were often exploited by the Kashmiri Pandit officials.[21]\n\nGawasha Nath Kaul described the poor conditions of the Valley's Muslim population in his book Kashmir Then And Now and in it he wrote that 90 percent of Muslim households were mortgaged to Hindu moneylenders.[23] Muslims were non-existent in the State's civil administration and were barred from officer positions in the military.[23]\n\nPrem Nath Bazaz, one of the few Kashmiri Pandits who joined the movement for change, described the poor conditions of the Valley's Muslim population as such:[23]\n\n    The poverty of the Muslim masses is appalling. Dressed in rags and barefoot, a Muslim peasant presents the appearance of a starved beggar...Most are landless laborers, working as serfs for absentee landlords.\n\nThere was a famine in Kashmir between 1877-9 and the death toll from this famine was overwhelming by any standards. Some authorities suggested that the population of Srinagar had been reduced by half while others estimated a diminution by three-fifths of the entire population of the Valley.[24] During the famine of 1877-9 not a single Pandit died of starvation during these annihilative years for the Muslim cultivators, according to reports received by Lawrence.\n\nDuring the famine the office of Prime Minister was held by a Kashmiri Pandit, Wazir Punnu, who is said to have declared that there ''was no real distress and that he wished that no Musulman might be left alive from Srinagar to Rambhan (in Jammu).''[25]\n\n\nWhen lands fell fallow temporarily during the famine, Pandits took over substantial tracts of them claiming that they were uncultivated waste. Numerous Kashmiri Muslim cultivators who had left the Valley for Punjab to escape the devastation of those years found upon their return that they had been ousted from lands that they had cultivated over generations.[26]\n\n\n*:Debate me On Sources:*"<br />Author: 'Cazzidy007'  id: 'a1fpzq'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a1fpzq/til_some_things_i_learned_today/</li>

Granted I am guilty of this too with frequently calling people Chutiya, but then there are those who liberally disperse katua, ricebag &amp; other more advanced epithets like Bhosdike aur Madarchod to show how tough they are (pro-tip :- If you need to show toughness on internet, you are already pathetic)\n\nI propose that we either tighten up the rules or start being civil.\n\nNote:- Do not upvote. I made this post for the sake of discussion\n\nNote to mods:- Please do not lock this thread &amp; if you do create a seperate thread for the same discussion as it is an issue that we should address.'<br />Author: 'Sikander-i-Sani'  id: 'a1eu08'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a1eu08/meta_we_need_to_do_something_about_the_quality_of/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'A few questions on your experience with the law in India'<br />Body: "Hey, so this is partly for my work with Nyaaya and partly out of my own curiosity. Had a few questions on how people generally interact with the law.\n\n1) Have you ever had to talk to a lawyer or interact with the legal system for anything? How do you feel about interacting with the law? What's the first word that comes to mind\n\n2)The Law gives all of us a lot of rights and duties. Do you guys have a sense of when your rights are being violated? Or you are not performing a legal duty? For example, in a tenant-landlord relationship, the law gives tenants certain rights. In case the landlord is in violation of that, would you know?\n\n3) I see a lot of whatsapp forwards on my family whatsapp groups giving wrong information and sometimes journos on social media as well. Where do you guys get your legal info from\n\n4) What about certain simpler things that affect your daily life? Like the previous landlord-tenant example. If you want to just inform yourself about where you stand in this relationship. Is that something you would look up online, or would you approach a lawyer for that as well?\n\n5)Have you ever seen something happening on the road and intervened? Or tried to take action based on the law in any way?\n\n6)How receptive would be if you were getting legal info on social media, or whatsapp or instagram, or generally in non text formats? Would you see it as having the same authority?\n\n7)What are the areas of law most relevant to you all?\n\nThanks in advance to everyone who answers!"<br />Author: 'Radagast1402'  id: 'a156cg'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/a156cg/a_few_questions_on_your_experience_with_the_law/</li>
