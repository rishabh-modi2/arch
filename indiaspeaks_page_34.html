When 2 brothers are fighting over land , then Krishna came and gave us the Geeta and told why it's important to perform your duties and that I am the true God and whoever don't understand this or deny this is a fool.\n\nBut not any single God is came aur teach humans about their divine knowledge, after more and more people are educated can read or write, there's better preservation system, better system of communication, the message and knowledge can easily distributed, new technology like Video, Photos, live streaming etc are there.\n\nViolent crimes are happening all over the world, Nuclear Bombs are used, human is reached to the Moon, Human tech is reached beyond our solar system, we can look at different planets, more people died during 1900-1950 then the entire population thousands of years ago.\n\nBut no God from any religion is taking Avatar and spreading the knowledge of divine.\n\nWhat's your opinion??"<br />Author: 'RandomCitizenOfMars'  id: 'hc5xrp'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hc5xrp/why_are_theres_no_god_today/</li>

The Olympic Torch was to be relayed across just about *two kilometres*—from Vijay Chowk to India Gate. The government stationed over ***twenty thousand***  ***troops, paramilitary personnel, policemen and plainclothes men in and  around that short stretch***.\n\nTibetan refugees were beaten and sequestered.  Government offices were closed. Roads were blocked. The Metro was shut  down.

It will take a little time to analyse.’\n\n*It is not helpful at this stage to apportion blame  between them and us’—so statesmanlike as to be completely neutral  between the arsonist and the fire-fighter!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q. Has China  given any assurances that such intrusions will not occur in the future?**\n\n*‘I don’t think it is fair to ask for assurances… We already have  agreement to address this kind of issues.’  ‘There was appreciation of the manner in which India responded,’*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was the UPA government\'s reaction then , what was its action, it was minimize what China had done, to call out the incident had a one off and isolated one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q.

      <li>Title::: "Send your son to the army, get him killed and (don't) even get a pump in return."<br />Body: 'As we ponder over the death of 20 of our soldiers killed in action with the Chinese, the response or lack thereof, we have to first remember the treatment we meted out to the parents of Captain Anuj Nayyar.  \n\nArticle below:\n\n*It was a feat only few could have accomplished. Braving all odds—an invisible enemy and a hostile terrain—Capt Anuj Nayyar of 17 Jat was aware of only one thing. The eviction of Pakistani regulars from Pt 4875 in Kargil was crucial if Tiger Hill had to be recaptured. But the task was nothing short of impossible.*  \n\n\n*Despite heavy firing and shelling, Anuj and Hawaldar Hari Om charged up the steep slope, shouting "Jat Balwan, Jai Bhagwan". They destroyed the first bunker and charged for the next. Hari Om fell to enemy fire but Anuj continued to the third and succumbed after a rocket hit him on the head. Enraged by the death of their officer, the remaining soldiers accompanying their captain pressed on and accomplished the mission. Anuj was awarded the Mahavir Chakra for his supreme sacrifice.*  \n\n\n*But two years after the war, words like "bravery" and "supreme sacrifice" seem like mere phrases written on commendations and citations. Mere words, indeed, that pepper politicians\' speeches. Every year, platitudes are mouthed in July-end when it\'s time to commemorate Vijay Diwas and again on August 15. This year too it was the same story. Prime Minister Vajpayee started his Independence Day speech from Red Fort by paying his respects to those who had laid down their lives for the nation.*  \n\n\n*This year, however, the celebrations were slightly different. Prof S.K. Nayyar, Capt Anuj Nayyar\'s father, went up to the PM and said: "I gave my son to the country in its war against Pakistan but now I am fighting a war against your bureaucracy." This is how families of most of Kargil\'s martyrs feel now—betrayed and let down.*  \n\n\n*Two years ago, the Vajpayee government, still flush with victory, had offered petrol pumps and gas agencies to all such families. Now, Prof Nayyar, proud to be a Mahavir Chakra awardee\'s father, risks becoming a mere statistic tucked away in government files. So have all the others. Of the 446 families that applied for retail outlets for either petrol pumps or lpg agencies, only 308 letters of intent have been issued, and of these only 113 are operational.*  \n\n\n*The bureaucracy—be it in the office of the dcp Licensing, the water department or the electricity department—has spared no family, it seems. Prof Nayyar\'s application for an noc gathered dust in the dcp Licencing\'s office and all pleas came to nought till he wrote to home minister L.K. Advani. He had to, for petrol being an \'explosive\' item, an noc is the first step in the many to follow before the pump becomes a reality. Nayyar got his noc within two hours of Advani reading his letter, but as he says: "How are wives of jawans living in remote villages ever going to access the home minister and why do we need to approach the highest authority for something that the government itself promised us?"*  \n\n\n*Ask Nirmala Devi, wife of Hawaldar Hari Om, who lives in Khungai village in Haryana\'s Jhajjar district. It may be only a two-hour journey from New Delhi, but Nirmala cannot leave her home to chase bureaucrats. She did what she could through the district sainik board—file an application for a petrol pump. But two years have passed and the state government hasn\'t even earmarked the piece of land on which her pump is to be constructed. Of course, chief minister Om Prakash Chautala showed up twice—once for her husband\'s funeral when he placed his hand on her head and said: "You are a desh bhakt\'s wife" and again a few months ago when she constructed a samadhi for her husband in the village.*  \n\n\n*She reminded him then of the promised land and has done so again through her brother, the only family member willing to lend her a helping hand. Her in-laws—residents of the same village—have stopped talking to her except when trying to persuade her to transfer the letter of intent—a document that testifies to her being the owner of a pump. She does what gives her a sense of peace—praying at her husband\'s samadhi, where he stands statue-like, his chest proudly displaying the sena medal he won posthumously. But for the statue in olive-green which heralds your entry into Khungai and the garlanded pictures of Hari Om in the one-room home where Nirmala now lives, there is no trace of it being a martyr\'s village. The sarpanch, in fact, even asked the "brave soldier\'s" widow to pay up Rs 200 for the sand he got thrown outside the samadhi after the rains.*  \n\n\n*Take, for instance, Satya Devi, mother of grenadier Naresh Kumar (18 Grenadiers). She was allotted a retail outlet by the Indian Oil Corporation in Chandigarh (Letter no GM/PSO/OP Vijay/Mandi, dated June 1, 2000), but that\'s all she has to show—though Indian Oil has identified a piece of land which belongs to the state transport department, the government is unwilling to part with it. Satya Devi has written to the PM thrice but has not even got an acknowledgement in return. "Himachal has a bjp government and still there\'s no help. I think desh bhakti is a sentiment only amongst the uniformed people. Nobody seems to be bothered that my son died for the nation."*  \n\n\n*The only help she is getting is from 18 Grenadiers itself. Its commanding officer recently wrote a letter to the state CM requesting him for his personal intervention, saying the "late Grenadier Naresh Kumar, number 2690380, sacrificed his life for the nation... and the parents of the martyr are now running from pillar to post but to no avail."*  \n\n\n*In UP\'s Surana village, a few kms from Modinagar, sepoy Surinder Pal\'s parents are similarly disillusioned. Says Bhim Sen, Surinderpal\'s grandfather, stroking his picture: "I used to tell myself that my grandson (1, Naga regiment) died for a cause. But having hit our heads against bureaucratic walls, I am wondering why he ever joined the fauj."*  \n\n\n*Streets choking with mourners at the arrival of body bags and the entire village promising to be like a family are all things of the past. Forget empathy or even sympathy, the widows and parents of Kargil casualties are struggling to get what is rightfully theirs and what was promised to them.*  \n\n\n*After applying for his pump in July 1999, Prof Nayyar slated its inauguration for January 2001 but had to postpone it because senior officials in the Delhi Vidyut Board were quite blunt. "The normal cost of an electricity connection is Rs 3 to 4 lakh," he was told and when he protested saying it was a Kargil case, he was horrified with the pat reply: "Ok, since it\'s a Kargil case, we will give you a discount. Pay up Rs 1.5 lakh."*  \n\n\n*Says Nayyar: "Everybody wanted a piece of the cake. Some wanted a small piece while others wanted a bigger one. I live by certain principles even though I end up suffering." Suffer he did, for when he tried to tell the dvb officials that he would complain about them, they said: "If you tell the PM, we will cut off his connection and if you complain to the president, we will even cut his connection." Dejected, Nayyar decided to spend Rs 3 lakh on a generator instead of paying it as a bribe.His pump in Vasundhara Enclave in Delhi—called Kargil Heights—has been running on a generator since March this year. He decided finally to write to the PM and defence minister Jaswant Singh. Eventually, the dvb\'s vigilance department ordered an enquiry and suspended three officials, but he\'s still awaiting his electricity connection.*  \n\n\n*Hamra, wife of Lance Naik Ahmed Ali, has learnt to be strong after her husband\'s death but her problems are unending. If it isn\'t the police asking for free petrol, it\'s the rich men in Haryana\'s Tauru sub-division who harass her so that she sells the pump to them. Words like "widow" and "Muslim" are repeatedly flung at her but she\'s been strong. Says she: "I will not let my husband\'s sacrifice go in vain. I will continue fighting. But what saddens me is that while my husband fought an enemy country, I am fighting my own people."*  \n\n\n*She went to the Tauru police station after one of the seths—she refers to him as a big man and refuses to name him for fear of reprisal—started a fight at the pump when he wanted to drive away without paying for the petrol. Even the cops weren\'t of much help—they took Rs 1,000 just to lodge a complaint. Not that it stopped the seth. When he again refused to pay up, she had to approach the district police chief. The seth has stopped visiting the pump, but now there\'s another problem: she still gets messages from him, urging her to sell the pump.*  \n\n\n*Like Nayyar, she too had problems getting an electricity connection but unlike Nayyar, she had to pay for her \'piece of the cake\'. She cannot leave her five daughters and two sons—the youngest was only 20 days old when her husband\'s body was brought home—to make constant trips to Chandigarh. And even when she does, she\'s not too hopeful of getting an audience or help from the top. She still pays a monthly sum of Rs 3,000 to the foreman to ensure that she is not troubled with constant power cuts. This, in spite of paying a bribe to get the connection.*  \n\n\n*Nayyar, Nirmala and Hamra are not the only ones who have stories to tell. Stories that speak of apathy and reek of corruption are rampant through various villages and towns that only two years ago were alit with patriotic fervour. Like most of the 446 families who applied for their connections, Anita, widow of Naik Rampal of 9, Mahar regiment, and a mother of three, is struggling in Soldha, a remote village in Haryana while many miles away in Uttar Pradesh, Surinder Pal\'s family still mourns the death of their 21-year-old. So far, all that Surinder\'s family has is his last letter which they received a week before his death.*  \n\n\n*The families continue to survive but only just. Ask Prof Nayyar and he can\'t wipe from his memory the face of the men who looked at Anuj\'s picture put up at the pump and said: "Oh this is a good business. Send your son to the army, get him killed and get a pump in return."*  \n\n\n*Except for the next of kin, the brave men who made the supreme sacrifice have truly been forgotten. They are mere words and phrases—written on commendations and spoken of in politician\'s speeches.*\n\nFrom: [https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/the-betrayal-part-ii/213116](https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/the-betrayal-part-ii/213116)\n\nWe Indians have probably have a huge bunch of karma lying with us from the ancient time. We all become Twitter warriors wanting to boycott Chinese products, our Minister says "Boycott Chinese Food", all of which will be forgotten in 1 month. OnePlus sold out today in a few minutes. Mi Notebooks saw the same response.\n\nAfter Kargil, we went ahead and got Pakistani actors to act in our movies. Even after 2008, we invited Pakistani actors to star in our movies as they are "cultural ties" and "art should be away from politics".\n\nI hope for my sake and yours that Colonel Babus wife and children do not have to run pillar to post to get their share of Government funds and compensation. Our Babus will entangle these families in such a complex maze of paperwork that they will curse defending this country. And the same Babu will join a corporation as a "consultant" on some firms payroll to ensure that all processes happen "smoothly" for a price.\n\nFrom 2008 till recently, I had this nagging feeling that I kept pushing away. I could not accept it. But today, as we mourn the loss of the 20 Indian Soldiers KIA, I cannot help but feel like anyone can walk over us all while we preach about "restraint, ahimsa, ganga jamuni tehzeeb".\n\nOur babus will not grant any approval for business, our "activists" will singlehandedly shut down plants employing thousands of people, our top IT company cannot make a functional GST portal 3 years after launch.\n\nWe already see a lot of brain drain- people like Nadella, Pichai and countless others leaving this country to go to EU, US to make it big. \n\nSomeday, this country will run out of parents like Colonel Babus or Captain Nayyars.  And that day, there will be no India which could boycott China.'<br />Author: 'JainBeef'  id: 'hc087b'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hc087b/send_your_son_to_the_army_get_him_killed_and_dont/</li>

They are a problem.\n\nFirst, it takes away any time that you might spend elsewhere such as reading a book, talking to a friend or even just plain thinking. Or even talking to yourselves. There are lot of intelligent people here who can describe in detail what are its consequences. My 2 annas is - unable to realize how important you are to yourselves by always relying on what others tells you that you are important. Be it an opinion(upvotes), looks (likes) etc.\n\nSecond, its quite dangerous. I developed some nasty software for some shady company when I was in dire need of money. I stopped the moment when my situation improved. But there are a many that are invested into this as a business and as a profession. There is no telling how your personal data will be used. If you think &lt;this bad thing&gt; could happen, I am afraid it could happen.\n\nThird, you really don't need it. There is no reason why you should be online 24x7. There is no reason why politics have to be discussed 24x7. There is no reason why one can't read news once a day, like they used to and get on with our lives. No amount of political discussions on internet is going to change political calculus - except we are fighting among ourselves and end up hating each others. Remember we, the people are supposed to be incharge and politicans are supposed to dance to our tune - instead  we are fighting on behalf of their flags. \n\nSocial media can be used for good too but I am not sure we are using it that way. On the face of it, it should have bought us all together. Like , meet each other more, make more friends, have more parties, have more support ... and so on.  I believe this should happen. This will bridge our social differences. This will improve trust among ourselves. We'll together be more like to help and receive help. We don't need support from politicians for this right? It's bizarre that it seems we have become more isolated.\n\n\nMy recommendation is \n\n1. Ditch Smartphones all together. Use yesteryear's feature phones. I do that.\n2. Buy a separate music player.\n3. Have more meetups. Just make sure that you exchange your contact numbers over something like nohistory.chat and not over reddit.\n4. Also, you don't need the latest phone on the market. A 5 year old phone still works just fine.\n\nI am sure you all can come up much better suggestions/recommendations.

Nor am I in want of anything, nor have I need to obtain anything-and yet I am engaged in work.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead is described in the Vedic literatures as follows:\n\ntam īśvarāṇāṁ paramaṁ maheśvaraṁ\n\ntaṁ devatānāṁ paramaṁ ca daivatam\n\npatiṁ patīnāṁ paramaṁ parastād\n\nvidāma devaṁ bhuvaneśam īḍyam\n\nna tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate\n\nna tat-samaś cābhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate\n\nparāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate\n\nsvā-bhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca.\n\n"The Supreme Lord is the controller of all other controllers, and He is the greatest of all the diverse planetary leaders. Everyone is under His control. All entities are delegated with particular power only by the Supreme Lord; they are not supreme themselves. He is also worshipable by all demigods and is the supreme director of all directors. Therefore, He is transcendental to all kinds of material leaders and controllers and is worshipable by all. There is no one greater than Him, and He is the supreme cause of all causes.\n\n"He does not possess bodily form like that of an ordinary living entity. There is no difference between His body and His soul. He is absolute. All His senses are transcendental. Any one of His senses can perform the action of any other sense. Therefore, no one is greater than Him or equal to Him. His potencies are multifarious, and thus His deeds are automatically performed as a natural sequence." (Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.7-8)\n\nSince everything is in full opulence in the Personality of Godhead and is existing in full truth, there is no duty for the Supreme Personality of Godhead to perform. One who must receive the results of work has some designated duty, but one who has nothing to achieve within the three planetary systems certainly has no duty. And yet Lord Kṛṣṇa is engaged on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra as the leader of the kṣatriyas because the kṣatriyas are duty-bound to give protection to the distressed.

Our populace is not well trained and the [variation in skills and knowledge](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2705545/#!po=4.71698) is not enough (yet) for us to become a truly self sufficient nation (manufacturing-wise). \nIn a society which pushes a select few careers to its children, namely - engineering, medicine and civil services - that too with a laser focus on how much money you can earn rather than a more broad emphasis on life satisfaction, love for the craft and knowledge; has a long way to go before going to war with anyone. \n\n**Regarding going to war:**\nWe have more than enough on our plate to deal with. Our economic development started in the 90s and it\'s been just 30 years since we started. We cant afford to endanger all of that. \nAlso, a nation where people from different regions of the country, even of the same religion and race seem to despise each other, are we really ready to take on a huge, largely homogenous enemy like China? I dont think so. \n\n**On why people calling for industrial  independence and war are hypocrites:**\nSoldiers died and people all over the country are expressing their remorse and anger by demanding more soldiers die? \nI understand how war works. I understand that we can\'t keep getting bullied. \nBut bravery does not have to start at the border. \nBravery has to start with all of us. Dont like how things are? Study hard, work hard, go establish industries, become skilled enough to make amazing technology, become the craftsman people all over the world would be jealous of. All of us who are experienced enough know that to become these things is to be brave. It takes a lot of courage to do what you want and then to become good at it. And a lot of patience. \n\n\nFinally related to history and culture,\nThe first step is to understand your history and what went wrong in the past. \nThe second is to realise, that what we do today and every day after that, is what will become "indian culture" in the future. \nDo we want indian culture to be one which always takes the easier path of public outrage and effigy burning?\nOr one of hard work and discipline?\n\nAnyway these are my opinions.

You can visit my profile or connect with me on twitter.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA collar strategy aims to reduce the premium paid for insurance of stocks to very low while keeping the opportunity for profits(limited).\n\nCollar strategy in technical terms, we will follow it up with a no jargon explanation:\n\nA collar strategy is selling a call and buying a put on an underlying  asset to protect value while paying/recieveing a small amount.\n\nThat is way too complicated for me. I understand this simply as:\n\nIf you own a house and want to protect your investmentyou can buy  house insurance. As with all insurance you need to pay a premium.  Detailed explanation in part 1 linked at the top.\n\nAt the same time, you can also earn rent from your house. Detailed explanation: [click here](http://thestockmarketinvestor.com/?page_id=759&amp;preview=true)\n\nEarning rent from the house is a strategy where we agree to give our  shares to a buyer at an agreed price(Strike Price) till a certain  date(expiry date). If on the agreed date the share price is higher than  the agreed price.\n\nThe buyer give us a rent(premium)    to have the opportunity of  owning the stock at the agreed price if price goes above the agreed  price on the agreed date.\n\nIf you take rent and pay insurance premium, then there is a chance  that the premium can be paid partially or fully by the rent.    **The appreciation in house value will go to you but partially.**\n\nSubsitute stock/share in the statements above and that is a collar strategy.\n\nThe insurance is called buying a PUT option.\n\nThe rent is called writing/selling a CALL option.\n\nYou are not allowed to rent or insure a room in the house. You can  only insure or rent the entire house.    The house in case of stocks is  called a lot. Which is a set number of shares that can be either insured  or rented.\n\nLets take a look at what can happen over a few months:\n\nMonth 1:\n\nInvestment:\n\nOpening stock price/Purchase price: 1,000\n\nLot: 200 Shares\n\nInvested Amount: 1,000 x 200 = 200,000\n\nInsurance:(Buy Put)\n\nStrike Price: 80  \n(If price of share is below 80 at the end of the month we will get (80 – end of month share price) \\* lot)\n\nAmount Invested: 1,000 x 200 = 200,000\n\nInsured amount: 80% of stock value i.e. 1000 x 200 x 80/100 = 160,000\n\nInsurance premium paid: 1% i.e. 1,000 x 200 x 1/100 = 2000\n\nOur insurance expires at the end of the month.\n\nRent:(Sell Call aka Write Call)&lt;\n\nAgreed price(Strike Price): 110\n\nThis is the price at which the person paying rent will buy the shares, if price at the end of the month is above 110.\n\nRent received: 2% of stock value i.e. 1,000 x 200 x 2/100 = 4000\n\nWe keep the rent and shares if price is below 110 at end of the month.\n\nWhat happens at the end of the month:\n\nCase 1:\n\nShare price remains same as start of the month\n\nInvestment value: Same as starting i.e. 200,000\n\nOther amount: Rent recieved – Insurance premium paid = 4000-2000 = +2000\n\nPrice is below 110 (Strike price) so we keep the rent and the price  is above our    insurance point so Insurance company keeps the premium.\n\nCase 2: Price is between 100 and 110, let us assume 105.\n\nInvestment value: Increased by (Current Price – Purchase Price) x number of shares = (105-100) x 200 = +1000\n\nOther amount: Rent recieved – Insurance premium paid = 4000-2000 = +2000\n\nPrice is below 110 (Strike price) so we keep the rent and the price  is above our    insurance point so Insurance company keeps the premium.\n\nCase 3: Price is above 110, let us assume 140.\n\nInvestment value: Increased by (Rent Strike Price – Purchase Price) x number of shares = (110-100) x 200 = +2000\n\nWe have to sell/give our shares to the person who paid us rent as the  agreed strike price is crossed. So our    selling price is 110.\n\nOther amount: Rent recieved – Insurance premium paid = 4000-2000 = +2000\n\nCase 4: Price is below 80, let us assume 50.\n\nInvestment value: Decreased by (Current Price – Purchase Price) x number of shares = (50-100) x 200 = -10000\n\nWe insured our investment at 80 strike price. Now that the price is below 80 the insurance company will have to pay us.\n\nInsurance pays us: (Insurance Strike Price – Current Price) x number of shares = (80-50) x 200 = +6000\n\nOther amount: Rent recieved – Insurance premium paid = 4000-2000 = +2000\n\nPrice is below 110 (Strike price) so we keep the rent.\n\nTotal in Case 4 = Investment value decrease + Insurance payment received + Other amount = -10,000 + 6000 + 2000 = -2000\n\n\\-2000 is a 20% loss.\n\nWhat happens if we didn’t have insurance and rent? (Current Price –  Purchase Price) x number of shares =    (50 – 100) x 200 = -5000 that is  a 50% loss\n\nEven though our investment pick was wrong we are still in a much  better position with the collar strategy. If the case 1, 2    had been  true for even 2-3 months before the loss in case 4, we would be net  positive.\n\nNote: chances of getting trades such as the ones used in the example  are low/non-existant.    We merely want to get clear on the concept.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow this series will expand the strategies after concept explanations like above:\n\n1- When to use the strategies?

We cannot have same thought otherwise it will be unnatural for some societies and eventually all the societies in India. Nationalism has importance in certain space and time. So the emotion of nationalism should be invoked judiciously when it's required , in that way we will truly give proper respect for the idea of India. We should cherish diversity ,like tropical green forest which has complex ecosystem and are most sustainable. \n\n Patriotism is more realistic.

Most people do not know how to react (appropriately) when someone is talking about their mental health. Even I get uncomfortable when someone speaks about their mental health because it\'s scary for me; I don\'t want to do or say anything wrong even when I have all the academic information I need. (I have a masters in IO psychology)\n\nFriends and family can be your support system, but they are not as well equipped to provide you with a solution that a Therapist or Psychiatrist can.\n\nResearch shows\xa0untrained people can do more harm to someone\'s mental health by giving incorrect uninformed advice. A bit risky to just rely on internet searches as well.\n\nMy point is - It’s unfair to use your friends and family as a dumping ground for your emotional baggage. Mental illness isn’t something you should be ashamed of, nor is it something you need to hide from the friends you trust. Maintain a good balance between friendships and therapy.\n\nSome people in comments on the other thread have made an excellent point that it is a battle in itself for people whose friends and family are suffering from mental illness and how draining it can be to constantly be worried about your loved ones.\n\nYes, therapy can be expensive, but your life is priceless.'<br />Author: 'bombaysparkle'  id: 'hbhhar'<br />Score:38<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hbhhar/your_friend_is_not_your_therapist/</li>

First it was Muslim invders, then the British and now Indian politicians. Several big temples are under State control. None of the Churches or Mosques or religious institutions of any other religious groups are under State control. \n\n#A secular government wants to control temples\n\nA secular State by definition is one that does not control religious institutions but in India the State that claims to be secular usurps Hindu religious institutions and places of worship. How come this secular Indian state always wants “better management” only for Hindu temples and religious institutes? Is it a co-incidence that big, rich Hindu temples, like Vaishno devi to Tirupati Balaji with lot of lands are under State control? How come Golden Temple in Amritsar does not need better management? Are Hindus not capable of looking after their temples and managing their own affairs? Of course they can but they are too rich to be left alone by babus and politicians of India be it from Congress or BJP. \n\n#Government controlling temples is illegal and unconstitutional\n\nConstitutional law is clear in this regard.Government take over religious institutions or places of worship of any religion is illegal and unconstitutional. The devotees and the community concerned has constitutional right to take care of its religious affairs and places of worship. This rule has been violated brazenly by various state govt and hence many Hindu temples have fallen in hands of the govt which then dispose of temple lands, [appoint non-hindu members](https://archive.vn/C806A ) in management board and pocket huge amounts of money Hindus donate to their temples. \n\n[Supreme Court’s legal]( https://archive.is/glicO) view on this matter is clear: Temples should be managed by devotees, not governments. \n\n\n#How Government loot and destroy temples\n\nLoot: Temples are looted in broad daylight by government with impunity. There are several ways to do it. Apart from illegal ways like stealing artifacts, antiques and donated money temples are looted systematically for example the Srirangam Ranganathar Temple [paid the government](https://web.archive.org/web/20200613103600/https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/freeing-temples-from-state-control/article5594132.ece) a (yearly) fee of Rs. 18.56 crore (2010-11) for ‘administering the temple’. Temple are made to finance their own loot and destriction. \n\nAt Nelliappar Temple in Tirunelveli priests performing daily pujas are paid salaries ranging from [Rs. 55-Rs. 72 a mounth!](https://web.archive.org/web/20200613103600/https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/freeing-temples-from-state-control/article5594132.ece) (and this is during 2010-11). \n\nIn addition to controlling and mismanaging money that Hindus give to their temples Indian State has also [inserted non-Hindu members](https://web.archive.org/web/20180617014728/https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/news/india/andhra-cm-n-chandrababu-naidu-faces-devotees-ire-for-appointing-christian-member-in-tirumala-temple-board/articleshow/63871273.cms ) in these temple boards in the past and many of the discriminatory practices like different ques for people depending how much they have paid for darshan where the more you pay the faster you can get darshan are instituted by the govt which discriminate devotees and makes Hindus look bad. \n\nDestruction of Temple structures: Here is an excepert from [Dr.Subramanian Swamy’s article](https://web.archive.org/web/20200613103600/https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/freeing-temples-from-state-control/article5594132.ece) which says it all,\n\n“The third ‘contribution’ of the government is the mindless destruction of priceless architectural heritage of our temples.\nThere are several instances of sand blasting of temple walls resulting in loss of historical inscriptions; wholesale demolition of temple structures and their replacement by concrete monstrosities; in a temple in Nasiyanur near Salem, an entire temple mandapam disappeared, leaving behind a deep hole in the ground, literally.\nRecently the government started covering the floor of Tiruvotriyur temple with marble, a stone never used in south Indian temples. The original floor was of ancient granite slabs with historical inscriptions. There are several initiatives for ‘renovation’ of temples — the bureaucrats rarely consult archaeologists or heritage experts. Without knowledge, experience, competence or appreciation and with great insensitivity they use inappropriate chemicals on ancient murals, insert concrete/cement structures, use ceramic tiles to ‘embellish’ sanctum sanctorum and construct ‘offices’ within temple premises.

Especially, with the #BlackLivesMatter suffrage going on at the moment. But there are multiple instances that you may not have heard of, as the religion that suffered in these isn’t the one that has stayed in power for generations, yes, it is the Hindu Religion, or what the liberals call “the religion born with the victim card”. But what are these sufferings?\n\nThese sufferings have been going on since the Islamic invasions into India, and was continued in the British Rule.\n\nThe biggest difference between the Hindu sufferings and for example the Jewish sufferings is the period of time that they went on for, the holocaust for comparison was for 6 years, however the Hindu sufferings went on for 800 god damning years.\n\nBut, you liberals may ask, didn’t advancement happen under the Muslims?\n\nWell if you call killing 280 million Hindus, converting god knows how many, making mountains of skulls of the Hindus killed by their hands, and destroying Hindu architecture and writings, so if you call that development, then Soviet Union was the greatest state right?\n\nThis shows that post-independence India, should have focused both on the economy and Hindu Nationalism, as they were denied that for 800 years. But no, the reason nobody talks or supports Hindu Nationalism except of a few exceptions, is because Hindus were all kicked out of everywhere between Afghanistan, South China(Tibet) and Vietnam only leaving them out in India and Nepal.\n\nOne more thing that shows we were cheated by the government in power post-independence and the constituent assembly before it, is the Sindh River, Lavapuri(Lahore) and Kushavati(Kasur), you may know about Lahore and Kasur as they were cities of Ram’s twin sons, Luv and Kush.

And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.**  \n**PURPORT**  \nPeople in general always require a leader who can teach the public by practical behavior. A leader cannot teach the public to stop smoking if he himself smokes. Lord Caitanya said that a teacher should behave properly even before he begins teaching. One who teaches in that way is called ācārya, or the ideal teacher. Therefore, a teacher must follow the principles of śāśtra (scripture) to reach the common man. The teacher cannot manufacture rules against the principles of revealed scriptures. The revealed scriptures, like Manu-saṁhitā and similar others, are considered the standard books to be followed by human society. Thus the leader's teaching should be based on the principles of the standard rules as they are practiced by the great teachers. The Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam also affirms that one should follow in the footsteps of great devotees, and that is the way of progress on the path of spiritual realization. The king or the executive head of a state, the father and the school teacher are all considered to be natural leaders of the innocent people in general. All such natural leaders have a great responsibility to their dependants; therefore they must be conversant with standard books of moral and spiritual codes.  \n**Question 1 : What are the characteristics of an ideal teacher/leader ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2ao52ruyl551.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e5d71f2d3ca05bce944d356b70f1c30870c09ec\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'hb8sz1'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hb8sz1/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is321/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'An advocate on twitter enlists reasons why he feels from the death photographs of Susant Rajput circulating online that his is not a case of suicide, but murder.'<br />Body: 'https://twitter.com/Gujarati_Weaver/status/1273307029126262784/photo/2\n\nAdditionally, some discrepancies are enlisted below by a common person, so take them with some grains of salt. \n\nPictures of Sushant Singh Rajput\'s dead body were released on social media. I am not posting those here but you can search on Google. The images clearly show that his neck was intact and just carried a mark. But in case of suicide or death by hanging, the person\'s neck "elongate" due to stretching. While Sushant\'s neck looked intact. This raises doubt. There are also no other visible signs of injury or stress to the neck and face (e.g. mouth, tongue, eyes) due to hanging from ceiling for long duration. Was he strangulated first and hanging was "staged" just to show it as suicide? \n\nAs per news, he was found hanging with help of a "curtain". But the mark on his neck is too thin for a "curtain". The mark looks like a "rope\'s mark"! Was he killed by someone with a plastic rope? This also explains the "V shape" mark - since the killer would have dragged his neck with a rope from behind him, the "v shape" mark would have formed which normally forms in deaths due to hanging. \n\nAll articles in the room look at their right place. It is unlikely, unless if someone arranged the articles after killing him, so that no doubt could be raised. \n\nThe bed sheet looks fresh and perhaps it was changed the same day. The room and surrounding does not give any sign of depressed or disturbed mental state behavior by Sushant. \nMost actors and celebrities are already fighting depression. The fact that Sushant was getting treated for depression is not too serious because of this reason. \n\nIn his last movie, Sushant Singh Rajput had played a role where he was preaching youngsters against the tendency of suicides. It is difficult to believe that he would himself so quickly fall into the same behavior. \nNo suicide note was found. Sushant was an educated person and he knew his responsibilities. If he were to commit suicide, he would have definitely left a suicide note. \n\nSushant was youngest member of his family. He had no brother and only 4 sisters. It is natural that he would be most loved as the youngest in his family. He had talked to one of his sisters yesterday morning on mobile too. Since he was in talking terms with his family and he was loved by his family, he would never commit suicide without talking to anyone about his problems, if he had any. \n\nHis sister revealed that Sushant had no financial problems. Still, one of his servants mention that Sushant talked to him and told him that he was not sure if he would be able to pay for the servant\'s salary in future or not. This is too silly a statement. If he had money-problems, he was well connected with friends and family and he would have managed it. \nSushant was scheduled to marry in November this year. His family was planning to travel to Delhi to attend it, indicating preparations were being made. Why would he commit suicide without telling anyone? \n\nIt is said that Sushant was taking medication for depression for last 6 months. 4 out of last 6 months were impacted by Lockdown. If Sushant had committed suicide during Lockdown period, we could still understand some depression angle. But now that \'Unlock\' has happened and flights and trains are running, if Sushant felt depressed, he could have gone to meet his family in Patna. Why was Sushant still locked in his Mumbai flat when flights were already running? From the reaction of his family (father fainted after hearing news; maternal uncle asked for CBI probe), it is clear that his family had no clue that anything like this could have happened. But it is common sense that if Sushant was really sad and depressed by anything, he would at least make one trip to his hometown before taking this drastic step. \n\nAs per the pattern seen in suicidal people, they ponder over the idea for long time. They make plans, change plans and give up plans too. They try to talk to someone about it as well. Sushant\'s death, if it is a suicide, is totally peculiar since there is no clue and the death was abrupt. Even the events since morning of yesterday, everything looked normal - as per media reports, he woke up in the morning, drank fruit juice, talked to his sister over phone, called up his old friend who did not pick up the phone, and then locked himself in his room and died? It does not make any sense. \n\nhttps://onrightpolitics.blogspot.com/2020/06/reasons-why-sushant-singh-rajputs-death.html'<br />Author: 'Sea_Shrimps'  id: 'hb50zn'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hb50zn/an_advocate_on_twitter_enlists_reasons_why_he/</li>

      <li>Title::: "[2003 article by Brahma Chellaney] India's Betrayal of Tibet"<br />Body: 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB105934174617047500\n\nSeeking to placate China, its longtime-rival, India has subtly shifted its stand on Tibet to recognize the Chinese annexation. This has delighted Beijing but raises questions about New Delhi\'s diplomatic game plan and has spurred concern among Tibetan exiles.\n\nPrime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, having struck one-sided bargains in Beijing, returned to India vowing that communist China now "fully reciprocates our desire for mutual goodwill." The Chinese leadership exploited Mr. Vajpayee\'s yearning for a successful visit to extract concessions that present India as willing to accept a secondary role in a China-dominated Asia. While reciting the virtues of a multipolar world, China defines multipolarity in a way to make itself the sole power in Asia, so that it is free to limit U.S. influence, contain India, bully Taiwan, shame Japan, divide the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and make use of semifailed states that serve as its clients -- Pakistan and Burma against India, and North Korea against Japan. Yet Mr. Vajpayee would say at the conclusion of his visit that "cooperative relations between India and China would be a positive force in the search for a multipolar world order."\n\nIn Beijing, Mr. Vajpayee appeared less the leader of a nuclear-weapons state determined to engage China on equal terms and more like a tribute-payer to the Middle Kingdom. While effusive statements and concessions came from the Indian side, the Chinese gave no ground.\n\nMr. Vajpayee\'s trip will be remembered for his gratuitous concession on Tibet, a large historical buffer between the Indian and Chinese civilizations that the communists annexed in 1950. Mr. Vajpayee has tried unsuccessfully to douse the controversy. But he can\'t conceal the fact that this is the first time India has used the legal term "recognize" -- in a joint document signed by the heads of the two countries -- to accept what China calls the Tibet Autonomous Region as "part of the territory of the People\'s Republic of China."\n\nInsecure about its hold and unsure of the validity of its claim on a territory that was mostly independent in history, China sees New Delhi as the key to its continued control of Tibet, whose traditional cultural and trade links were southward to India. By handing Beijing the formulation it wanted, India has opened itself to more Chinese pressure, especially because it is home to the Dalai Lama and more than 100,000 of his followers. China could in the future demand that New Delhi live up to the new formulation and disband the Tibetan government-in-exile headquartered in Dharamsala, or at least outlaw the publications of the Tibetan "splittists."\n\nThe Indian recognition continues a pattern of self-damaging Indian betrayal of Tibet that began under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who gave up the extraterritorial rights India inherited in Tibet from the British and signed a trade agreement with Beijing in 1954 acknowledging the "Tibet region of China." Nehru traded an explicit concession for a self-perceived implicit gain, sacrificing Tibet so that "our northern frontier should be considered a firm and definite one." Instead it brought war. The 1954 accord expired in 1962, the year China invaded India. All subsequent Indian governments, seeking to correct Nehru\'s mistake, had maintained that Tibet was an autonomous region within China, not a part of China.\n\nMr. Vajpayee now has unequivocally recognized as part of China the area officially known as TAR, the central plateau where less than half of all ethnic Tibetans live. And by narrowing Tibet to just TAR, Mr. Vajpayee has implicitly conceded the forcible incorporation of Tibet\'s large outer territories into the Chinese provinces of Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu and Yunnan. China has rejoiced over its twofold success in extracting a new formulation that it calls New Delhi\'s "first explicit acceptance" of its absorption of Tibet and in making Mr. Vajpayee agree to open trade with Tibet from an Indian state -- Sikkim -- where Beijing does not recognize India\'s legal presence. China has long plowed a lonely international furrow on Sikkim, refusing to accept the 1975 change in status of the tiny Himalayan territory from an Indian protectorate to part of the Indian union.\n\nIn a classic example of how India relives history, New Delhi\'s claim concerning the Sikkim-Tibet trade accord mirrors the assertion it made following a 1954 agreement with China. In that agreement, India deluded itself by interpreting the mention of border-trade posts as de facto Chinese recognition of the Indian-Tibetan frontier. With the new accord, it rushed to similarly advertise the ill-defined reference to a "pass on the India-China border" as implicit Chinese recognition of Sikkim\'s status as an Indian state. Beijing immediately repudiated this claim, to the embarrassment of Mr. Vajpayee.\n\nBartering concrete concessions for fond hopes, Mr. Vajpayee gave away New Delhi\'s remaining leverage. While India turned its back on Tibet, China did not yield on Sikkim. Similarly, China values the still-undefined line of control with India as a powerful lever that pins down large numbers of Indian troops along the Himalayas and ensures that New Delhi does not gain a decisive military edge against China\'s "all-weather friend," Pakistan.\n\nMr. Vajpayee\'s visit contributed to an unflattering linkage between troubled Tibet, a major international issue that refuses to fade away, and peaceful Sikkim, a nonissue, with the people of Sikkim (and the rest of the world) having accepted its union with India. His concession on Tibet does not mean that India is preparing to abandon the Dalai Lama. Like Nehru, Mr. Vajpayee will continue a dual-track policy of calming Chinese concerns over Tibet while assisting the Dalai Lama\'s international movements and his government-in-exile. But Mr. Vajpayee has neither learned from Nehru\'s mistakes nor is willing to play India\'s biggest card against China -- Tibet.\n\nIt also raises a larger question: Why negotiate from a position of weakness and further undermine one\'s bargaining capacity? India should be buying time. Another decade of strong economic reforms and cooperation with the U.S. could give India the leverage and self-confidence to deal with China. Given the unsustainable contradiction between China\'s communist autocracy and market capitalism, time is on India\'s side.\n\nMr. Chellaney is professor of strategic studies at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi.'<br />Author: 'fartak11'  id: 'hayab2'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hayab2/2003_article_by_brahma_chellaney_indias_betrayal/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Keezhadi excavation obstacles: Archaeology being manipulated to manufacture history, accuses scientist'<br />Body: '\nA scientific research paper authored by Dr B S Harishankar, internationally known archaeologist and member, academic committee, Indian Institute of Advanced Studies, Shimla and which was published in the ideological weekly ‘Kesari’ has stirred a hornet’s nest in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.\n\nThe archaeologist, through meticulous analysis and documentary evidence substantiated by scientific findings has charged that the Archaeological Survey of India’s excavation at Keezhadi in Tamil Nadu’s Sivaganga district is with ulterior motives and for manufacturing history by hook or crook. Kanimozhi, MP and daughter of late M K Karunanidhi, has been described as a person trying to manipulate and meddle with the excavation.\n\n“All norms associated with excavation of a spot have been violated by the self styled archaeologists who are digging at Keezhadi. The whole process was shrouded in mystery and they did not allow even a former director of the ASI to examine their findings. What is the need for such a secret operation while the entire excavations carried out in other places of the country were open books,” Harishankar who is credited with two post-doctoral researches, asks in his paper.\n\nThe paper “Global Interventions in Keezhadi Excavations” charges that the persons behind the project are out to prove that there existed a separate civilization in Keezhadi/South India independent of the civilization that existed in North India. “It is a welcome move but they should have done it in a transparent manner. While archaeologists like Dr T Satyamurthy, former director, ASI were kept away from the site, the materials they dug out were taken to a laboratory in the USA to find their antiquity. Though there are enough facilities in India itself to test the materials, they would not give the result what they expect. They want a separate DNA result to establish a Dravidian race to raise separatist agitation,” said Prof Harishanker.\n\nDr Satyamurthy said that Harishankar has raised important reservations against the Keezhadi excavations. “They failed to publish at least one in situ picture of the excavated materials. Whatever has happened in Keezhadi under the pretext of archaeological excavation is dubious and need thorough probe. We should not allow anyone to assemble or manufacture history by fame means,” Sathyamurthy told The Pioneer.\n\nThe first persons to reach Keezhadi once the excavators announced to the outside world that they have come across startling proofs were M K Kanimozhi MP and her long time associate Jegath Gasper Raj , a Catholic priest who was closely associated with the LTTE, the Tamil terrorist organisation banned in India. Kanimozhi even approached Madras High Court pleading for an order staying the ASI from taking the samples of Keezhadi to laboratories which are under its jurisdiction.\n\nThough the court had obliged by issuing an interim stay, it vacated the stay when ASI furnished the relevant details. But a  number of Christian theologists entered the scene and this vitiated the atmosphere. “The NGO headed by Gasper Raj who was receiving foreign donations was trying to launch a secessionist movement in Tamil Nadu aided by the so called Keezhadi  finsings,” said an intelligence official tracking the flow of foreign funds to the NGOs actively engaged in Keezhadi.\n\nPattanam, an excavation site in Kerala too is a site created by a section of modern historians to subvert the history of South India, said Harishankar and   Prof C I Issac, member, Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR). “Once they succeed in establishing that Pattanam and Keezhadi  were connected through common bondage and linked to Rome, the entire landscape could be manipulated,” Prof Issac told this newspaper.\n\nTamil Nadu Government’s recent decision to set up a modern museum to display the artifacts from Keezhadi is a major win for DMK’s Dravidian Nadu project, said Prof Issac.\n\n\nSource https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/archaeology-being-manipulated-to-manufacture-history--accuses-scientist.html'<br />Author: 'yadukulakambhoji'  id: 'harjhv'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/harjhv/keezhadi_excavation_obstacles_archaeology_being/</li>

Nonetheless they performed all prescribed activities just to set examples for the people in general. Janaka was the father of Sītā, and father-in-law of Lord Śrī Rāma. Being a great devotee of the Lord, he was transcendentally situated, but because he was the King of Mithila (a subdivision of Behar province in India), he had to teach his subjects how to fight righteously in battle. He and his subjects fought to teach people in general that violence is also necessary in a situation where good arguments fail. Before the Battle of Kurukṣetra, every effort was made to avoid the war, even by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the other party was determined to fight. So for such a right cause, there is a necessity for fighting. Although one who is situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness may not have any interest in the world, he still works to teach the public how to live and how to act. Experienced persons in Kṛṣṇa consciousness can act in such a way that others will follow, and this is explained in the following verse.\n\n**Question 1 : Who was King Janaka ? What teaching we get from the lives of great Kings like Janaka ?** \n\n**Question 2 : Why it became a necessity for the Pandavas to fight the Battle of Kurukṣetra ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s54a4tg1ue551.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=258803696d03fc2b3abb1303ad1ab2d65e376829\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual\u200b](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'halcpw'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/halcpw/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_320/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Please Stop Using RIP for the deceased ones'<br />Body: ' \n\nR.I.P means Rest in Peace-\n\nIn Christianity, this short epitaph signifies wishing rest and peace to someone who has died. Christians bury the dead ones and the soul rests in peace in that grave until the judgment day arrives. On the Judgment day, the Lord will decide who goes where- Heaven or Hell. They believe that on the Judgment day the dead will rise again. Until that time, the soul has to remain inside that coffin. Hence the blessing Rest In Peace (until the judgement day)\n\nNow, Hinduism does not have any concept such as that of rising of dead ones. Hinduism believes in reincarnation. It says that the cycle of birth and death are governed by the Karma of individuals. The deceased individual would take another birth based upon the Karma of this life. So there is no rest and hence, the concept of RIP is not valid in Hinduism. Hinduism believes in Moksha that is liberation- Liberation from the endless cycles of birth and death. That’s why instead of using RIP we should say, “Om Shanti” or “Aatma Ko Sadgati Prapt Ho (May Soul attain Moksha)” or simply "Om Sadgati". Sadgati means salvation or liberation. We always pray that may the soul get liberated from the cycle of life and death.\n\nIn fact, the concept of RIP would remotely come close to the concept of Preta (Evil, hungry ghosts) which is basically a curse in the Hindu way of life. An individual after leaving his/her body becomes Preta. When we say RIP , we are praying for the soul to remain locked into a standstill on Earth as it becomes Preta for eternity. That’s why in Hindu way of life there is a concept of Terahvin (13 days). For 13 days family members of deceased persuade the Pretas every day with various invocations and offerings requesting them to leave this earth and move on to their next destination which could be either incarnation or salvation (moksha). By saying Om Sadgati we prompt the soul to move on and not remain in \'peace\' here..'<br />Author: 'Dhruv_Colossus'  id: 'haabcu'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/haabcu/please_stop_using_rip_for_the_deceased_ones/</li>

Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, news channels, Netflix everyone is just posting the trending death. How immoral is that to gain from someone's death. Every influencer, instagram pages, bloggers, vlogs start bearing the flag of righteousness about the person and shitting about it.

A person, therefore, acting for Kṛṣṇa, or in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, under proper guidance and without attachment to the result of the work, is certainly making progress toward the supreme goal of life. Arjuna is told that he should fight in the Battle of Kurukṣetra for the interest of Kṛṣṇa because Kṛṣṇa wanted him to fight. To be a good man or a nonviolent man is a personal attachment, but to act on behalf of the Supreme is to act without attachment for the result. That is perfect action of the highest degree, recommended by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Vedic rituals, like prescribed sacrifices, are performed for purification of impious activities that were performed in the field of sense gratification. But action in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is transcendental to the reactions of good or evil work. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person has no attachment for the result but acts on behalf of Kṛṣṇa alone. He engages in all kinds of activities, but is completely nonattached.\n\n**Question 1 : Why Krishna consciousness is said to be the perfect action of the Highest degree ? Why it surpasses all Vedic rituals ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ich3ppjcu7551.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16ea6c91f624b0100a45248f08e60a608b7a1f71\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'h9y8d0'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/h9y8d0/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_319/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Yet another post about depression, slightly different pov'<br />Body: 'Woke junta has already flooded every social media space about how we should be treating people with depression better. This post might sound a bit insensitive, you\'ve been warned, if you\'re depressed but can\'t take constructive criticism, you shouldn\'t read further. Every post that I\'ve seen has called out for compassion and a judgement free listening ear. But what they fail to take into account is that depressed people themselves are not very rational. And they\'re extremely pessimistic if not completely paranoid. If the only thing you\'re doing is providing a listening ear, that generally works for them. But nope, you can\'t offer solutions otherwise you hurt their fragile self-esteem. You can\'t even insinuate to the existence of an obvious solution or they think that they\'re being labelled as lazy or incompetent. So, you might as well continue listening but the question is, for how long? It\'s rare for people to recover in a span of a few months, if not years. And it will eventually become cumbersome to the sympathetic listener to listen to the same tirade over and over again. There\'s no guarantee either that it doesn\'t get worse and lead to self-harm or worse. So, I don\'t see any point in lending a sympathetic ear without being allowed to offer any solutions. \n\n\nSecondly, they might be working and it is likely to affect their performance but they\'re not capable of taking constructive criticism. They usually view it as veiled humiliation. Imo, it\'s incredibly stupid to believe that we can create a rosy world for depressed people. There are going to be those interested in constructive criticism and there are going to be bullies who intentionally want to hurt people. And it\'s no consolation that depressed people can take a radically different interpretation to your well meaning statements. The truth is, there are people who had a close family member with depression and did everything right, yet that person went on to commit suicide anyway. So, when you pin the blame on everyone but the individual, that\'s unfair. I\'m not calling for victim shaming, what I mean is that ultimately, people are responsible for their own actions. Life isn\'t fair, there are people with easier and tougher lives than any of us, that\'s not an excuse. If you believe that anybody has a valid reason for committing suicide, then I don\'t think you respect them enough. I don\'t think you think they have what it takes to persevere no matter what. \n\n\nAnd that doesn\'t mean that we don\'t criticize or work on the issues that could be exacerbating these issues. But, yeah, it\'s not totally the rest of the world either. Victim mentality is real, there are people who know that they are depressed and they\'d rather blame the entirety of their circumstances rather than working on their issues. And tbh, you can\'t help them no matter how kind you\'re determined to be. This "the world needs to be nicer" meme tier logic of woke junta is toxic and legitimizing those people who have actually developed victim mentality.'<br />Author: 'KaunJamaatHo'  id: 'h9idyf'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/h9idyf/yet_another_post_about_depression_slightly/</li>

But, the good part is that, there is no official announcement from UAE govt yet. As I have been eyeing keen about the repatriate news everyday, I know how UAE is making efforts continually to repatriate each and every expats living in the Nation to their homeland. With such instance this particular news about the suspension of visas belonging to Nepal and few other countries left me in a shook. The immediate question that raised inside me was,"UAE is making tremendous efforts to fly the stranded expats back to their motherland, then why such a speculation comes in-between?"\n\nThough the article I read was written based on the information from unofficial sources, it managed to console myself \'Why UAE might take such a decision?\'. I understood that if a such a decision is announced by UAE in forthcoming days, it solely depends on the delay showed by the governments of other countries such as Nepal,Bangladesh and Nigeria.\n\nAs we know that, UAE have flied back most of the expats and migrants living in their Nation to their motherland in this short-span with the good co-operation given by respective counterpart officials. Like requests made to every nation from their side, UAE had requested the Govts of Nepal, Bangladesh, and Nigeria for several times it seems. But, the respective Govts failed to be responsivee to UAE\'s requests and showed no interest in the repatriation of their stranded people.\n\nI could also find that Nepali Govt is the one who lacks the thought of bringing back their Nationals the most. Around 17,000 Nepalese passport holders want to return but the fact is that, it is still unknown when the Nepal Govt will take back their nationals. This delaying in decision have caused Nepali migrants to protest outside Nepalese Embassy in Abu Dhabi after which the UAE official dispersed them.\n\nAs it is unclear how many migrants are stuck in UAE, it is evident that a lot of Indian migrants have been also stuck there at large number.

They achieve this by making interviews unreasonably hard for the north-Indians. They create a question bank for the South Indians and when their people are interviewed from those seemingly hard questions which have already been shared, they fare well.\n\nNot only in recruitment, South Indians gang-up in the companies too, eat with their own and support their own. Although, in general they help their own sub-group the most, they make sure the next preference is given to someone from their neighboring states. I have faced this situation, and I have seen my north-Indians friends face this too. Many a times despite performing well I have seen my friends get passed over for a under-performing South Indian. Have you ever faced the same kind of discrimination?\n\nI know it is not politically correct to speak about these issues openly because you get censored by the same people. However, I decided to speak up against this atrocity. You can't expect people to be nationalists when the people of your own country discriminate against you. I really wish India was more like EU, where the country was separated into regional autonomous regions, so that people from some regions would not take advantage of the nationality tag by ganging up together.\n\nI refuse to sell my kidneys to the south Indians for the benefit of the nation.

India is the 6th most depressed country in the world says WHO report in the year 2018. There are several other sites putting out reports about India being a centre for depressed human.\xa0\n\n\nWhy is this happening? Have we stop and thought once? Have we reached out to a person facing depression? Actually, how will we reach someone, when we don\'t know, is anybody suffering from such issue.\xa0\n\n\nDepression is a state of mind. It\'s a phase where the person suffering it has been filled with negative &amp; depressing thoughts. We can\'t spot a depressed person as there are no bodily symptoms.\xa0\n\n\nDepression sounds very underrated ted in our country. We tend to a judgemental mindset which blocks others to reach us out for help. The person feels insecure about sharing his thoughts.\xa0 The fear of what will others think pushes them in a dark world. They will create a mind space which resists them to come out.\xa0 Every comment on them affects them deeply. All the pain, hurt, pressure, stress sums up into a mental strain causing depression. Depression is not a sudden state but builds up of rejection, failure, fear, loneliness and other factors.\xa0\n\n\nPeople are so involved in their lives that they hardly care what\'s happening in other\'s life. We as humans are losing courtesy. One of the traits of humans is humanity which is lost in the world of a material thing.\xa0\n\n\nThe other day I was talking on a call with my friend. She wanted me to listen about what\'s going on with her. She was exhausted with the constant rush. Instead of hearing her out, I kept blabbering about my day, myself. In one word, I was being a \'self - centred\'. She gradually stopped saying. After talking enough and getting no response I asked her. She replied, "I called you because I thought you\'d listen". That moment it hit me hard, right in my head. I felt like a gunshot. She wanted me to listen. I realised how obnoxious I\'ve behaved. My friend needed someone to hear but I stole her spot pushing her aside and making myself the hero. It made me wonder not always we have to speak. Sometimes it\'s important to listen. And if someone shares their problems we flood them with solutions, suggestion, mean comments making them feel inferior. We desperately want to be the " correct one " so we directly rush to the conclusion sidelining the depressed person. They gradually cut off from us, as in their mind they think, "no one needs me", " no one wants to hear me" and many such negative thoughts.\xa0\n\n\nThe point here is we should we a little more welcoming towards issues like depression, anxiety and panic attacks. Not everything can be cured by "Haldi Dudh".\n\n\nDepression has to be dealt with care and attention. We should be kind a little more. We should be sweet and empathetic slightly more. Creating an environment for the person to open up and put their guards down. If handled with care and affection depression can be solved. Listen to what the person has to say.\xa0\n\n\nA person fighting and shouting is better than a person staying in a cacoon. I pray for a more friendly and helpful environment. I pray that India treats depression a little seriously.

That great archer the King of Kāśī, the great fighter Śikhaṇḍī, Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Virāṭa, the unconquerable Sātyaki, Drupada, the sons of Draupadī, and others, O King, such as the mighty-armed son of Subhadrā, all blew their respective conchshells.  The blowing of these different conchshells became uproarious. Vibrating both in the sky and on the earth, it shattered the hearts of the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra.* \n\nHere, it is specifically mentioned that the Kauravas' hearts were shattered after hearing the conchshells of the pandavas. But, nothing like this is mentioned on the part of Pandavas even when the grandfather Bhishma sounded his conchshell. We can note here that the Pandavas had fully surrendered to the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna. So, they were fearless even in front of the greatest obstacle. But as the Kauravas did not take the shelter of the Lord, they were fearful of the Pandavas even though they had warriors which had never lost a battle (as mentioned by Duryodhana to grandfather Bhishma in the earlier part).\n\nFrom this, we should realize that if we surrender to the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna and always keep him in our heart while doing anything, there is nothing to fear in our life as he will help us with the obstacles. But without surrendering to the Lord, however great we may become in terms of money, wealth, power, etc, we would always be fearful in life. And the primary fear plaguing the society is the fear of death. Even though everybody knows that death is the only certain thing in life, we make plans and amass money as if we will live forever. But, nobody has found the cure to death and it will certainly happen. Even a little surrender to Lord Krishna helps us not to fear death.\n\n**How can you help me:**\n\nThis will be my primary project. I want it to reach as many people as possible. Apart from this, I can also cover topics related to history, sciences, economy, society, etc (on a one off basis). Please suggest if you would want to have any of these also to be included and in what way I can do it better. Constructive feedback is always appreciated. Also, you can ask me anything related to this. Will be more than happy to help.

Why did it start bothering you after a celebrity has died. Why does your pro mental health mindset not say anything when students in India die of depression, of feeling inadequate.\n\nWhy were you anti harassment for only as long as the boys locker room issue was trending? Why is it that you were also the ones crying about animal cruelty when the elephant died and then forgot about it the next day to post about whatever else was trending. Why did migrant and black lives suddenly become important to you once it was on the mainstream media.\n\nI am not disregarding these issues, I'm not implying that we do not need to take action. These are all issues involving social reform. Your awareness is well appreciated, but I don't want your opinion just because its the hip thing right now. Acknowledge and understand that you may not be the right person to opine on every issue. If something is very near and dear to you, I understand. If it is something you or your close ones have been through, I understand. But if you're blatantly posting everything as a 'woke Indian netizen', I loathe your mentality.\n\nWhile I appreciate you giving solutions to every issue, they're mostly impractical since you're not in the know- how of the issue and it's current status in the society. You're generating fluff and overshadowing the opinions that really matter.\n\n I would rather see my feed have 5 opinions from people who are related to the issue/ well educated about it than see 150 of your reposted and screenshotted stories which you very well know are redundant and are bringing zero benefit to your followers or the society."<br />Author: 'BoozeyDoc'  id: 'h8sn6b'<br />Score:77<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/h8sn6b/unpopular_opinion_posting_about_mental_health/</li>

      <li>Title::: "China's &amp; UAE romance with US universities. It is revealed China &amp; UAE have transferred at least 6.5 billion dollars to Harvard &amp; Yale alone over the last few years."<br />Body: "&gt;Today I will write about the intimate ties that Harvard University shares with China which has doled out billions of dollars for the University.\nWe will also look at why Harvard has emerged as the world's leading higher education hub for the Chinese Communist order.\n\n&gt;Harvard University is the favourite and go-to University for Chinese President Xi Jinping. Let's understand why.\nThis is Xi Mingzhe. She is the only daughter of Jinping and lovingly referred to as the Princess of China.\nWhich university did she go to?\nYes, Harvard University.\n\n&gt;Xi Mingzhe was enrolled at Harvard University under a pseudonym and was protected by bodyguards at all times.\nShe did her undergraduate degree and then returned to complete her post graduate degree.\nMingzhe was the reason why Xinping started a romance with Harvard University\n\n&gt;What does China do when the daughter of its most powerful political figure is in love with her lifestyle in the US? Surely a few bodyguards isn't enough to protect their President's only daughter.\nSo, China does what it does best.\nIt starts flushing money into Harvard University.\n\n&gt; Thanks to his daughter, Chinese President Xi started frequenting the University. Sometimes the visits were private but sometimes it was an official affair.\nHe became close connected with Harvard University President Lawrence Bacow &amp; his wife, Adele Fleet Bacow.\n\n&gt;This picture shows Harvard University President Lawrence Bacow and his wife, Adele Fleet Bacow being received by the Chinese President at The Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 20, 2019.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Soumyadipta/status/1272008245146599424\n\n&gt;Trivia: Both Bacow and his wife tested positive for #COVID19 as early as March 24.\n\n&gt;Soon after his daughter's enrolment, Xinping starts pumping money into Harvard. Another Ivy-league University Yale too starts receiving grants and gifts. Many top Chinese leaders enrolled their children into Yale.\nHow much money do you think Harvard received from China?\n\n&gt;A BILLION DOLLARS! @business\n reported that Harvard University was the biggest benefactor of grants &amp; gifts from China. They declared 93.7 Million Dollars.\nIt was understood that casual gifts routed through family members and daughter weren't accounted for.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Soumyadipta/status/1272015167652425729\n\n&gt; USA was caught napping till the sheer volume of money started leaving trails everywhere. When the aid to Harvard crossed the amount of foreign aid USA doles out to countries like Pakistan, it alarmed them.\nState education department flagged the transactions at Harvard University.\n\n&gt; In February 2020, USA declared that they are launching an investigation specifically into Harvard and Yale, as they have received...\nWait for it...deep breath...hold on...\n6.5 BILLION DOLLARS FROM CHINA  &amp; UAE.\nYes, the Saudis entered into the picture too!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Soumyadipta/status/1272021417861627905\n\n&gt; Do you think China is so foolish that it will gift billions to Harvard and Yale without any collateral? As it turns out, China had realised that the world's most brilliant minds teach there.\nIt started approaching senior faculties and again, kept millions of dollars on the table.\n\n&gt; China started a secret recruitment programme at Harvard. They bribed &amp; recruited senior faculty members.\nWith millions of dollars, it started outsourcing research topics to the faculties.\nThe lab and brains were from the US but they were essentially working for Chinese interests.\n\n&gt; An unfortunate victims was Charles Lieber, the chair professor of the department of chemistry and chemical biology. He was accused of hiding his involvement in China's Thousand Talents Plan, a secret communist programme.\nLieber was arrested by the FBI\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Soumyadipta/status/1272025289615216640\n\n&gt; Prof. Lieber has been sacked from Harvard University. He has been indicted by the court for lying about getting bribed by China and taking part in a Communist programme.\nIn his defence, Lieber has claimed that he is a victim and not a perpetrator\n\n&gt; China has set up its academic base at Harvard University right under the nose of \n@USAGov. Today, Harvard University and China are partnering on several research programmes, including a vaccine against Covid19\n\n&gt; Imagine! The scientists are US nationals, the labs and equipments are located at Harvard University.\nBUT the research directly benefits China.\nHere's the Harvard Gazette claiming that China has donated $115 million to Harvard for research on #COVID19\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Soumyadipta/status/1272043160919658498\n\n&gt; To know how Harvard is being used by China for its own benefit, take a look at this research project.\nThis is the Harvard-China project where China's Tsinghua University (known as the Harvard of China) is directly involved with several schools at Harvard.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Soumyadipta/status/1272044574739849219\n\n&gt; Did China stop after setting up a higher education hub at Harvard? Or bribing professors to do research for them? Or setting up research projects to further its communist agendas?\nWe are talking about China here. Here comes the most sinister activity that has unnerved even the US\n\n&gt; China has set up a SPY RING at Harvard. It sends its spies disguised as students. These spies are specifically trained to steal intellectual property and research documents from the university labs and then send them back to China.\nHere is a Reuters report, scientists from across Ivy league universities in the USA are under surveillance for spying for China and stealing of intellectual property.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Soumyadipta/status/1272049501587468288\n\n&gt;Today, scientists from across Ivy league universities in the USA are under surveillance for spying for China and stealing of intellectual property.\nHere's an article about a nationwide programme launched by the Justice Department to stop this spy ring\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Soumyadipta/status/1272052228296110080\n\n&gt;USA has come down hard on China for theft of intellectual property. USA terms this as a theft to the tune of billions of dollars. Here's former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo explaining how much USA is rattled.\nDon't forget Pompeo was head of CIA till 2018\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Soumyadipta/status/1272055918117576705\n\n&gt;Now, this is my favourite part.\nThis is the part where Indian communists step in.\nWe all know that some Indian Communists are unbelievably sympathetic towards China.\nSeveral such names have come to the fore during the war of narratives of the pandemic and the border conflict\n\n&gt;China has increased its PR activity in foreign media, getting its way through high value advertisements and under-the-table bribes to journalists to write in favour of them.\nBUT not many know that China has instituted a global journalism training programme\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Soumyadipta/status/1272058895104479233\n\n&gt;Bribery and inducing corrupt practices is a standard practice in China. Scores of PR managers are used to bribe journalists. Here's a blog of a young PR person about how that works inside China.\nProblem is: These same methods won't work outside China. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/Soumyadipta/status/1272060089134800901"<br />Author: 'brackenlassie'  id: 'h8ouyu'<br />Score:45<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/h8ouyu/chinas_uae_romance_with_us_universities_it_is/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Job hopping is good, contrary to what recruiters, companies and start-ups want you to believe'<br />Body: 'I’ve seen quite a few start up founders react badly to their employee leaving companies. They take it on their ego. I’ve seen some of them publicly shame their ex-employees etc. Following are some reasons I believe you shouldn’t stick around in your current job if there’s mental agony or you aren’t getting your due or if there’s a clearly better opportunity elsewhere:\n\n1. The same companies wouldn’t care two hoots when they wish to go through layoffs. Eg. Zomato, Swiggy, Sharechat etc let 25% of their employees go despite the fact that they have hundreds of millions of dollars in funds. And they laid off their employees at a time they are unlikely to find another job. Imagine how many of them would have seen their long term future with the company and how many of them would have let other opportunities go to show their “loyalty”.\n\n2. I’ve had recruiters reach out to me in my 2nd month of new job to poach me..and ironically, asking “why did you change your last job within 2 years”...recruiters and companies want you to ditch your current companies as soon as they need you, but don’t want you to leave forever\n\n3. Days of bonded labour are over..but by terming people as “job hoppers” or calling them out for leaving your company, a social pressure is being artificially created to achieve the same effect\n\n 5. Working in multiple companies gives you a much broader perspective of business, organisational behaviour and develops you in a broader way. You can easily figure this when you speak to people who’ve spent last 15-20 years in the same company.\n\n5. Companies often take their “loyal” employees for granted and the new recruits are almost always able to negotiate better salaries and titles with a similar experience. When you are inside the company, your career and salary grows in a linear way, and this is why companies love long lasting employees. \n\n6. The same founders who love “long term players” sell their companies at the first opportunity.\n\nIf you believe in yourself, you should never be worried about switching your job if you feel you are being taken for granted or aren’t enjoying your life working at your current company.\n\nHaving said this, In the current times, I would recommend keeping your job because the opportunities are limited and economy is uncertain..'<br />Author: 'CoolGuess'  id: 'h831y0'<br />Score:32<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/h831y0/job_hopping_is_good_contrary_to_what_recruiters/</li>

Therefore, for those who want to enjoy this material world, the above-mentioned cycle of performing yajñas is absolutely necessary. One who does not follow such regulations is living a very risky life, being condemned more and more. By nature's law, this human form of life is specifically meant for self-realization, in either of the three ways-namely karma-yoga, jñāna-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. There is no necessity of rigidly following the performances of the prescribed yajñas for the transcendentalists who are above vice and virtue; but those who are engaged in sense gratification require purification by the above-mentioned cycle of yajña performances. There are different kinds of activities. Those who are not Kṛṣṇa conscious are certainly engaged in sensory consciousness; therefore they need to execute pious work. The yajña system is planned in such a way that sensory conscious persons may satisfy their desires without becoming entangled in the reaction of sense-gratificatory work. The prosperity of the world depends not on our own efforts but on the background arrangement of the Supreme Lord, directly carried out by the demigods. Therefore, the yajñas are directly aimed at the particular demigod mentioned in the Vedas. Indirectly, it is the practice of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, because when one masters the performance of yajñas, one is sure to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. But if by performing yajñas one does not become Kṛṣṇa conscious, such principles are counted as only moral codes. One should not, therefore, limit his progress only to the point of moral codes, but should transcend them, to attain Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n**Question 1 : Why it is necessary for a person to perform yajñas ?**\n\n**Question 2 : FITB :** a).But if by performing yajñas \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ such principles are counted as only moral codes.\n\nb).

This is shown every where from movies to shows, newspaper to social media.\nPeople find it cool to make fun of "this" religion, and if you follow "this" religion you\'re a low iq , low mentality, narrow minded person. People will encourage you , lecture you to become atheist if you follow "this" religion. Also it is seen as really open minded person if you say bad about "particular caste" , blame everything wrong with the society on "particular caste", thinks like "particular caste" go back, smash "particular caste" patriarchy, "particular caste" must die and "particular caste" = Castiest person. But when a terrorist activity happens , and people associate this "other" religion to it, same people will protest against it that you can\'t target a particular religion like this, which is a right thing to do ( IMO) but they do the opposite thing with "particular caste" and also promote things like this.\n\nI can go on there\'s thousands of things to say bad about "this" religion and "particular caste", but these aren\'t the only Evil religion/caste.

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 3.14'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : Why one must first offer food to Lord Kṛṣṇa before eating ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "When Lord Kṛṣṇa is worshiped, the demigods, who are different limbs of the Lord, are also automatically worshiped; therefore there is no separate need to worship the demigods. For this reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, offer food to Kṛṣṇa and then eat-a process which nourishes the body spiritually. By such action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature. When there is an epidemic disease, an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic. Similarly, food offered to Lord Viṣṇu and then taken by us makes us sufficiently resistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, who eats only food offered to Kṛṣṇa, can counteract all reactions of past material infections, which are impediments to the progress of self-realization. On the other hand, one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful action, and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins. The material world is full of contaminations, and one who is immunized by accepting prasādam of the Lord (food offered to Viṣṇu) is saved from the attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination."\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n**Question 2 : What is the reason for the scarcity of food ? How it can be counteracted ?**\n\n**Answer 2 :** "The field production is due to sufficient rain from the sky, and such rains are controlled by demigods like Indra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all servants of the Lord. The Lord can be satisfied by sacrifices; therefore, one who cannot perform them will find himself in scarcity-that is the law of nature. Yajña, specifically the saṅkīrtana-yajña prescribed for this age, must therefore be performed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 3.14, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jxnb6edhai451.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59d915a59b76c71f64ae6564fd013f4a8e2048c0\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

Consequentially the all-pervading Transcendence is eternally situated in acts of sacrifice.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nYajñārtha karma, or the necessity of work for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa only, is more expressly stated in this verse. If we have to work for the satisfaction of the yajña-puruṣa, Viṣṇu, then we must find out the direction of work in Brahman, or the transcendental Vedas. The Vedas are therefore codes of working directions. Anything performed without the direction of the Vedas is called vikarma, or unauthorized or sinful work. Therefore, one should always take direction from the Vedas to be saved from the reaction of work. As one has to work in ordinary life by the direction of the state, similarly, one has to work under direction of the supreme state of the Lord. Such directions in the Vedas are directly manifested from the breathing of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said: asya mahato bhūtasya naśvasitam etad yad ṛg-vedo yajur-vedaḥ sāma-vedo \'tharvāṅ girasaḥ. "The four Vedas-namely the Ṛg-veda, Yajur-veda, Sāma-veda and Atharva-veda-are all emanations from the breathing of the great Personality of Godhead." The Lord, being omnipotent, can speak by breathing air, as it is confirmed in the Brahma-saṁhitā, for the Lord has the omnipotence to perform through each of His senses the actions of all other senses. In other words, the Lord can speak through His breathing, and He can impregnate by His eyes. In fact, it is said that He glanced over material nature and thus fathered all living entities. After creating or impregnating the conditioned souls into the womb of material nature, He gave His directions in the Vedic wisdom as to how such conditioned souls can return home, back to Godhead. We should always remember that the conditioned souls in material nature are all eager for material enjoyment. But the Vedic directions are so made that one can satisfy one\'s perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having finished his so-called enjoyment. It is a chance for the conditioned souls to attain liberation; therefore the conditioned souls must try to follow the process of yajña by becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious. Even those who cannot follow the Vedic injunctions may adopt the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and that will take the place of performance of Vedic yajñas, or karmas.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the four kinds of Vedas ?

      <li>Title::: '45 years since the Emergency: How the electoral practices case against Indira Gandhi progressed in the courts. How Justice AN Ray was rewarded and became Chief Justice of India. How Emergency was introduced the very next day after Indira Gandhi got a stay from a vacation judge in Supreme Court'<br />Body: 'June 1975 depicts the darkest month in the history of independent India. The Allahabad High Court held then Prime Minister **Indira Gandhi**  to be guilty of corrupt electoral practices and disqualified her from  contesting elections for 6 years. After she was not granted a total stay  by the Supreme Court, Gandhi imposed national Emergency upon the  country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Indira Gandhi was trying hard to craft a ‘committed judiciary’ of judges favouring the government. \n\n**Three judgments delivered by the Supreme Court unsettled Indira Gandhi.** \n\n1. In [*Golaknath*](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/120358/) (1967),  the Supreme Court held that the amending power does not enable  Parliament to override all express or implied limitations on that power  and it could not amend Part III of the Constitution. \n2. In February 1970, in [*RC Cooper*](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/513801/)  (bank nationalization case), the Supreme Court dealt with a law which  nationalized 14 banks. Although the Court laid down that Parliament had  the legislative competence to do so, it struck down the law for want of  sufficient compensation. The law had to be passed again with higher  compensation. \n3. The third case was related to [privy purses](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/660275/)  given to the erstwhile rulers. Privy purses were constitutionally  guaranteed and were charged on the Consolidated Fund of India. In 1967,  many princely rulers joined the Swatantra Party led by C Rajagopalachari  and emerged victorious. Indira Gandhi, in an attempt to control the  same, introduced the 24th Constitution Amendment Bill. Although passed in the Lok Sabha, this Bill failed in the Rajya Sabha. \n\nGandhi  therefore used another way. She advised the President to use powers  under Article 366(22) and derecognize the rulers. The President acted on  the advice and issued various notifications. The move was challenged  before the Supreme Court, which held it to be unconstitutional (Justice **AN Ray** dissented and ruled in favour of Indira Gandhi).\n\n \n\n **Lok Sabha dissolved after 9 days after the Judgement**\n\nNine  days after this judgment, Gandhi advised the President to dissolve the  Lok Sabha. After this advice was accepted, elections were called in  early March 1971. In January 1971, the Election Commission allotted  symbol of a cow and a calf to Indira Gandhi’s Congress and she appointed  Yashpal Kapoor, who had recently resigned as a gazetted officer, as her  election agent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l51zi0yipf451.png?width=942&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cb798fceaa18b10ca164c2e91d01a6fef0457ea\n\n \n\nRaj  Narain, who was backed by all the opposition parties, was the main  opponent against Indira Gandhi in Rae Bareily (Uttar Pradesh). The only  other opponent was Swami Adwaitanand, who contested as an independent  candidate. The election was conducted on March 7, 1971. The next day,  Raj Narain, confident of winning, took out a victory procession.  Counting started on March 9, and the result was announced on March 10.  Indira Gandhi won the election by over 1,10,000 votes.\n\n \n\n**Raj Narain files a case in April 1971**\n\nRaj  Narain, influenced by the rumour about chemical treatment of ballot  papers amongst other grounds of corrupt electoral practices, filed an  election petition in April 1971 through advocate **Ramesh Chandra Shrivastava** before the Allahabad High Court. He engaged Senior advocate **Shanti Bhushan** \\[then a member of INC (O)\\] to represent him. \n\nThe grounds,\n\n* Allegations against Yashpal Kapoor of bribery to Swami  Adwaitanand, distribution of quilts, blankets etc\n* Providing conveyance  to voters to and from polling booths, exceeding the expenditure limit\n* Using Yashpal Kapoor while he still was a gazetted officer with the  government alongwith other such officers\n* Using police force for  furthering prospects of her election by erecting barricades\n* Using the  Armed Forces to further her election by flying in Air Force planes\n* Her election symbol (cow and calf) was a religious symbol. Indira  Gandhi engaged **SC Khare** to represent her.\n\n Interrogatories filed by RC  Srivasatava were objected to by Khare, but allowed by Justice Broome of  the High Court. The matter reached the Supreme Court, before Justices **CA Vaidyalingam, KS Hegde** and **HR Khanna**, but the SLP was dismissed as withdrawn.\n\nRaj  Narain sought to amend his petition qua the date on which Gandhi became  a candidate. This was rejected by the High Court. The matter reached  the Supreme Court again, and a Bench of Justices Hegde, **PJ Reddy** and **KK Mathew**, vide a unanimous decision, allowed Raj Narain to amend the petition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How Justice AN Ray was rewarded and became Chief Justice of India**\n\n During pendency of the election petition by Raj Narain, in April 1973, the judgment in [*Kesavananda Bharati*](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/257876/)[ ](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/257876/)was  pronounced and Justice Hegde again decided against the Indira Gandhi  government. Gandhi swiftly responded and Justices Shelat, Grover and  Hegde were superseded in the line of seniority by making a  **pro-government judge - Justice AN Ray - Chief Justice of India.** \n\n(Justice **AN Ray** dissented and ruled in favour of Indira Gandhi)\n\n \n\nConsequent to the amendments made, the Allahabad High Court, now through Justice **KN Srivastava**  framed three additional issues. Thereafter, oral examination of  petitioner’s witnesses commenced. SS Saxena, then an under secretary  with the Confidential department, Uttar Pradesh appeared as a  petitioner’s witness but refused to produce few documents on the ground  of ‘state privilege’. \n\nThe High Court rejected the claim of  privilege and the matter reached the Supreme Court again. The  proceedings before the High Court were adjourned till the Supreme Court  decided the issue. After the retirement of Justice Srivastava, the  matter came to the court of Justice **Jagmohan Lal Sinha**, who directed to produce evidence on other issues in the meanwhile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*The Supreme Court through 5 judges – CJI* ***AN Ray, KK Mathew, NL Untwalia, RS Sarkaria*** *and* ***A Alagiriswami*** *JJ heard the appeal against refusal of state privilege and* [*allowed the same in January 1975*](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/438670/)*.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **Indira Gandhi also went to the court to testify, the first for a sitting  Prime Minister of the country**\n\nOral  evidence of the respondent started in February 1975. Amongst others,  Indira Gandhi also went to the court to testify, the first for a sitting  Prime Minister of the country. She was cross examined by Shanti  Bhushan. Before the commencement of final arguments, Raj Narain also  challenged an amendment to the election law on expenses by a candidate,  which was introduced by the government to nullify a hostile decision in [*Chawla’*](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/680015/)[s case](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/680015/).\n\n \n\n**Threats and offers to the Judges**\n\nOn  May 23, 1975, the last day before the summer break, arguments were  concluded by the parties. \n\n* Amongst rumours of offer of elevation to the  Supreme Court to Justice Sinha \n* Reports of threats to the secretary  of Justice Sinha to leak the operative part of the judgment\n\nThe  judgment was pronounced on  June 12, 1975. Indira Gandhi was found to  have indulged in corrupt practices on account of rostrums constructed by  government officers and that her election agent Yashpal Kapoor worked  at her instance in the election while being a gazetted officer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ekn5hagwrf451.png?width=981&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=370b9bab2bd601ac97d15257e9367e2a94ef6463\n\n **Justice Sinha stays the operation of the judgment  unconditionally for 20 days**\n\nImmediately  after the judgment, SC Khare filed an application for stay of operation  of the judgment. Interestingly, immediately thereafter, on an  application by Gandhi’s lawyers, an *ex parte* stay order came to  be passed by Justice Sinha, staying the operation of the judgment  unconditionally for 20 days. When RC Srivastava came to know about it,  he preferred a review application against this *ex parte* order, which came up for hearing only a few days late before the vacation judge and had become useless by then.\n\n \n\n**Indira Gandhi appeals in SC for stay**\n\nGandhi  appealed before the Supreme Court. As summer vacations were running,  the appeal came to be presented before the vacation judge – Justice **VR Krishna Iyer**.  At that time, the vacation judge, unlike today, sat only on Tuesdays  and Fridays. On June 20, the Advocate-on-Record for Gandhi, **JB Dadachandji**, mentioned the matter for an early date. The date of hearing was fixed on the coming Monday i.e. June 23. \n\nAfter  hearing the arguments on stay application, Justice Krishna Iyer  reserved judgment and pronounced the same on the next day, June 24, at  3:45pm. After hearing Shanti Bhushan and **Nani Palkhivala** (for Gandhi), a [conditional stay was granted](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1240174/), but it was clarified that there was no legal embargo on Indira Gandhi continuing as the Prime Minister.\n\n# The next day after Indira Gandhi got stay from a vacation Judge. President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed had declared national Emergency.  \n\n June 24, 1975, at midnight, political leaders of the opposition  including Jai Prakash Narayan, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, LK Advani, Morarji  Desai, and Charan Singh were picked up and lodged in jails and at 10 AM,   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**38th  Amendment to the Constitution was passed by the government,**\n\nIn July, the 38th  Amendment to the Constitution was passed by the government,\n\n*  Making the  Emergency non-justiciable. In August\n* The government introduced the *Election Laws (Amendment) Bill*, which sought to amend retrospectively all the corrupt practices on which her election had been challenged. \n\n*Another  Bill was introduced by the law minister HR Gokhale, holding that any  dispute arising out of election of the President, Vice President,  Speaker and the Prime Minister will only be gone into by a forum  constituted under a special law by Parliament.* \n\nThere was a special  provision for elections already in place which would have declared the  election of Indira Gandhi valid and the High Court judgment as void. The  39th Constitutional Amendment was thus passed, and **Article 329A** was introduced.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Supreme Court, through Chief Justice AN Ray and the other senior most judges – Justices Khanna, **MH Beg**, KK Mathew, and **YV Chandrachud**,  started hearing the appeal from August 1975. Incidentally, these were  the last 5 judges left in the Supreme Court who had decided the *Kesavananda Bharati* judgment. All of these except Khanna J (who wrote the majority) had rendered separate dissenting opinions. \n\nAfter Palkhivala withdrew from the case due to imposition of Emergency, Gandhi retained **Jagannath Kaushal** and **Ashok Sen** to argue the case. Raj Narain (also lodged in jail) challenged the 39th  Constitutional Amendment before the Court in the same proceedings.  After a detailed hearing for around 30 days, the arguments by both sides  concluded on October 9, 1975 and the Court retired for the Dussehra  break.\n\n \n\n**The Judgement order**\n\nOn November 7, the Supreme Court [pronounced its judgment](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/936707/).  All five judges wrote separate opinions. CJI Ray, Khanna, Mathew and  Chandrachud JJ declared the constitutional amendment invalid but  declared the election amendment law valid, and thereby reversed the  Allahabad High Court’s judgment and declared Indira Gandhi’s election  valid. \n\nMH Beg J did not decide the validity of the constitutional  amendment, but declared the election law amendment valid. Importantly,  it was also laid down that the basic structure doctrine does not apply  to ordinary legislation, but only to constitutional amendments.\n\nA review petition was preferred against the judgment of MH Beg J by Raj Narain, but the same was dismissed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h86oe2p6uf451.png?width=1002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d58fb4567d0e8cd80a32917813edea5c5f928a42\n\n  **Justice Khanna dissented , he was superseded and Indira Gandhi made Justice Beg as CJI after loyalist AN Ray retired as CJI**\n\nFive months later, the Supreme Court pronounced its decision in [*ADM Jabalpur v. SS Shukla*](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1735815/).  Justice Khanna dissented and he was superseded from becoming the CJI by  the government, with the appointment of Justice Beg as CJI after  Justice Ray retired a few months later. As a result, Justice Khanna  resigned. \n\n#  The Emergency was revoked in 1977 \n\n The  Emergency was revoked in 1977 and general elections were conducted.  Indira Gandhi lost the election and the Janata Party rose to power. Raj  Narain emerged victorious. He was made the health minister in the Janata  Party government. Shanti Bhushan was made a member of the Rajya Sabha  (1977-1980) and held the office of Union Law Minister in the Morarji  Desai government from 1977 to 1979.\n\nShanti Bhushan was the same advocate who cross examined Indira Gandhi in  February 1975, he was also the member of  INC (O) .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Course of the 5 judges**\n\n**Hans Raj Khanna (Justice Khanna)**\n\n* Khanna J, after resignation was offered by the Janata  Party to head the Maruti Commission of Inquiry.

      <li>Title::: "How the Northeast was converted to Christianity by a pervert missionary with Nehru's explicit approval. No wonder Guha wrote a book to whitewash this man."<br />Body: 'The Army Chief General (later Field Marshall) Cariappa [advised] Nehru that the northeast should be developed to bring its population into the national fold. But a British missionary called Verrier Elwin advised Nehru that the region that had many tribal communities should not be interfered with to preserve their pristine character. This left the field open for foreign Christian missionaries who went on to dominate the area. […] …the Nehruvian author Ramachandra Guha in his compilation Makers of Modern India…[B]linded by Nehru worship while devoting many pages to his own hero Verrier Elwin! Who was this Verrier Elwin by the way? Elwin was a British missionary who exploited tribal girls, sometimes under-aged, in the guise of being an anthropologist. When he was 40 Elwin married a 13 year-old tribal girl Kosi who was his student. He treated her like a guinea pig, the subject of his anthropological studies including publishing intimate sexual details in what is called participant observation. After nearly nine years of marriage, Elwin left her and married Leela, a tribal girl in NEFA (Arunachal Pradesh) leaving Kosi in dire poverty. In the process it undermined national security by creating a vulnerable northeast.\n\nThis diabolical pervert managed to seduce Nehru to such an extent that he appointed Elwin as the Anthropological Adviser to the Government of NEFA (today: Arunachal Pradesh). The missionary inside Elwin remained unsleeping. Behind his sugary insistence on preserving tribal identities, customs, etc worked the same colonial chicanery that held that India was never a nation of one people with a shared heritage, and that the tribals were the “original aborigine inhabitants.”\n\nThe result?\n\nA near-total segregation of almost the entire North East for over fifty years. Elwin’s preservation policy left a devastating trail of Churches, inter and intra community hostilities and the “separate” Christian State of Nagaland. Dams, highways, heavy industries, universities, and hospitals for the rest of India. Bibles and Churches and Communism and guns for the North East.\n \nSource: Dharma Dispatch  https://www.dharmadispatch.in/history/how-nehrus-fascination-for-verrier-elwin-helped-christianise-indias-north-east'<br />Author: 'yadukulakambhoji'  id: 'h7gey1'<br />Score:55<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/h7gey1/how_the_northeast_was_converted_to_christianity/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How the demography of Gilgit Baltistan was changed. After the Sino-Pak agreement of 1963 China is occupying nearly 19 per cent of the territory of J&amp;K which includes some vital territory of Northern Area.'<br />Body: '**Agreement of 2 March 1963**\n\nPakistan  transfers or cedes areas to China in 1963, south of the Mintaka Pass,  belonged to Hunza. Border Agreement of 2 March 1963 changed the  alignment of the boundary line between the Sinkiang province of China  and the contiguous area under the actual control of Pakistan.\n\n&gt;India  protested to both Pakistan and China about this agreement. Ceding  territory to China was not even discussed in Gilgit-Baltistan as it did  not have any elected assembly of its own. Articles I, II and VI of the  1963 Sino-Pakistan Agreement, accepted that the area covered by the  Agreement was disputed.\n\nIf  you look at the Article VI, China concedes that the area is not under  the sovereign control of Pakistan, a fact that becomes important when  seen in the context of the CPEC. Both history and sovereignty issues do  not favour Chinese arguments here. They are, therefore, using commercial  arguments for their political and strategic investments in Pakistan for  transiting through POK\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe  location of Giligit Baltistan is unique. In addition to India and  Pakistan it has borders with Afghanistan and China. India’s stand about  GB being a part of the Indian State Jammu &amp; Kashmir has been  consistent.\n\nPakistan has shown  greater concern for the territory of Jammu and Kashmir it occupied than  for the people living there. It is quite evident the way Pakistani  governments handled the issue. None of the governments at the helm have  ever shown any genuine interest to address the issues pertaining to the  economic and the political interests of the people of the area.\n\n**How Demography was changed**\n\nThe  demography of the area has been changed. Outsiders were settled in this  area to achieve this objective. In 1948, Shias and Ismailis constituted  85 per cent of the population of the area. Today it is around 50 per  cent. Shias, Ismailis and Sunnis—lived peacefully in communal harmony  till the 1970s in the Kashmiri tradition prevalent before 1947.  Differences started to emerge from 1975 onwards.\n\nSkardu has a predominantly Shia population. The Sunnis have lived mostly in Diamir, and the Ismailis in Hunza. **The first sectarian clash occurred in 1975 when a Shia Muharrum procession was fired at from a Sunni mosque in Gilgit**.  The next major clash was in 1998 over the sighting of the moon to mark  the end of Ramadan. By this time, sectarian violence had become a common  occurrence, and manifested itself even more after the killing of  foreign mountaineers in 2014.\n\nNow the Shias and Sunnis have started living in separate areas and this has adversely affected cohesion\n\nThe  Karakoram Highway (KKH) linking Pakistan with Gilgit-Baltistan has  resulted in the influx of weapons and drugs and attacks by religious  militia into the region, leading to a change in demography. The  non-violent Ismaili community also started becoming targets of attack.\n\n&gt;***The desire of the people of Giligit-Baltistan to be connected with India has always been prevented and suppressed by Pakistan.***\n\nTwo  land routes—Kargil and Leh on the Indian side of the LoC connect with  Skardu and Khaplu (PoK side) but Pakistan has not permitted interaction  on these routes.\n\nNorthern Areas were separated from rest of PoK to ensure greater Federal Control. There has been pandering to China’s concerns.\n\n&gt;***China  since 1962 and after the Sino-Pak agreement of 1963 is occupying nearly  19 per cent of the territory of J&amp;K which includes some vital  territory of Northern Area.***\n\nChina and Pakistan have been using the territory of the area to the determent of Indian interest.\n\nThe  area and suffering of the people of GB has been completely neglected  just like how the international community  closed their eyes to the  genocide of Kashmiri Hindus. It is high time they took note of the  sufferings faced by the people of Gilgit-Baltistan and the people of  Pakistan Occupied Kashmir , including the Northern Areas which was once  part of the state of Jammu&amp;Kashmir.\n\n***Sources:***\n\n***Based  on a speech delivered by the author at the Annamalai University on 9th  August 2018.

      <li>Title::: 'Why do I go after broken people?'<br />Body: "This is not the sub for such things..but still;it's something I need to get off my heart.\n\nFrom the tilte,I guess you hv an idea what this post is about..Love..good old fashioned love..I remember the first time I fell in love..it was 2016..I was still using Facebook and just gave my 10th exams.While scrolling;I saw her pic.she had a sweet smile and big eyes..really beautiful..i never really talked to someone unless I knew them but..idk what took over me..I msgd her..she msgd back..we talked about things..so many common ideas..slowly we became friends..then best frnds..and that's where the trouble began..I started to feel something which I wasn't able to understand..I just felt happy everytym I talked to her;heard her voice..it was first love..so I gathered courage and told her about it..She said that she wasn't sure and asked me if I could give her some time..I agreed..fast forward 6 months..we talked in between but this thought was always back in my head that she didn't accept my proposal..so I asked her and she told me that she used to love someone else and got her heart broken..I didn't know about that..so I just asked her to atleast give me a chance..she didn't..we talked for 1½ years..all that while I was trying for her to give me a chance but she couldn't/didn't.!

Rains are produced by performance of yajna \\[sacrifice\\], and yajna is born of prescribed duties.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nŚrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa, a great commentator on the Bhagavad-gītā, writes as follows: ye indrādy-aṅga-tayāvasthitaṁ yajñaṁ sarveśvaraṁ viṣṇum abhyarccya taccheṣam aśnanti tena taddeha-yāntrāṁ sampādayanti te santaḥ sarveśvarasya bhaktāḥ sarva-kilviṣair anādi-kāla-vivṛddhair ātmānubhava- pratibandhakair nikhilaiḥ pāpair vimucyante. The Supreme Lord, who is known as the yajña-puruṣaḥ, or the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices, is the master of all demigods who serve Him as the different limbs of the body serve the whole. Demigods like Indra, Candra, Varuṇa, etc., are appointed officers who manage material affairs, and the Vedas direct sacrifices to satisfy these demigods so that they may be pleased to supply air, light and water sufficiently to produce food grains. When Lord Kṛṣṇa is worshiped, the demigods, who are different limbs of the Lord, are also automatically worshiped; therefore there is no separate need to worship the demigods. For this reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, offer food to Kṛṣṇa and then eat-a process which nourishes the body spiritually. By such action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature. When there is an epidemic disease, an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic. Similarly, food offered to Lord Viṣṇu and then taken by us makes us sufficiently resistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, who eats only food offered to Kṛṣṇa, can counteract all reactions of past material infections, which are impediments to the progress of self-realization. On the other hand, one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful action, and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins. The material world is full of contaminations, and one who is immunized by accepting prasādam of the Lord (food offered to Viṣṇu) is saved from the attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination.\n\nFood grains or vegetables are factually eatables. The human being eats different kinds of food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the animals eat the refuse of the food grains and vegetables, grass, plants, etc. Human beings who are accustomed to eating meat and flesh must also depend on the production of vegetation in order to eat the animals. Therefore, ultimately, we have to depend on the production of the field and not on the production of big factories. The field production is due to sufficient rain from the sky, and such rains are controlled by demigods like Indra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all servants of the Lord. The Lord can be satisfied by sacrifices; therefore, one who cannot perform them will find himself in scarcity-that is the law of nature. Yajña, specifically the saṅkīrtana-yajña prescribed for this age, must therefore be performed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply.\n\n**Question 1 : Why one must first offer food to Lord Kṛṣṇa before eating ?**\n\n**Question 2 : What is the reason for the scarcity of food ? How it can be counteracted ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8bvn1gxq28451.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28da77d7db64f1b5c302f17482f7c989750b7bd1\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual\u200b](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'h0tfit'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/h0tfit/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_314/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'India is being targeted by other countries that have no basis in secularism.'<br />Body: 'There is a lot of noise being created about India losing itself - losing it’s secular nature, democracy and federal unity. I have little to no sympathy with the current government or any party in the current political landscape - however, this needs to be called out for what it is....targeted propaganda from anti-Indian lobbies.\n\nIndia carries the heavy burden of being a “secular nation” amongst the nations that are at varying level of state faith countries. Islamic Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, UAE, Saudi Arabia along with most of the Middle East. Buddhist Japan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and other countries in SEA. Christian countries in Europe, North America, Latin America.\n\nSecularism is exceptionally hard to achieve and is rarely seen.\n\t\n\tIn Christian countries, the state and church separation exists to some extent. However, in most \tcases there are very little to no liberties available to other religions. Majority of the population \tis Christian in these countries and the culture is largely Judea-Christian based, with the \tminorities living under protective terms and conditions.\n\n\tIn Islamic countries this pretense is dropped and the state / religion merger is complete. The \tminorities have very limited rights and only within the context of the Islamic Shariah fabric. \tThere is no attempt to curtail the Islamic religious over-reach into all aspects of the society \tand population regardless of minorities faith.\n\nThere are unreasonable demands being placed on India - \n\t\n\tIn none of these countries, any of the demands that are made by the minorities in India, would \tbe entertained. In none of these countries, secessionist protests, support for terrorists, \tsupport for enemy nation under the name of free speech would be tolerated. \n\n\tThe secular environment where all social and religious norms of minorities can be \taccommodated while completely separating the religion from the state, providing each \treligion the full extent of their religious freedoms - doesn’t exist. \n\nThere is an exaggerated set of demands being placed by one particular sect -\n\t\n\tAll western nations co-exist with minorities because Christianity has evolved to become an \tinclusive religion.

      <li>Title::: 'Why are lyrics of Indian songs always written in English alphabet? Why not in the script in which the songs are originally composed?'<br />Body: 'Be it any where on the internet, like Youtube, music apps (such as Gaana, Apple Music etc.) almost every time I have come across lyrics written in English for Indian songs, be in Hindi or Marathi. (May be the same for other languages too, I guess.) Rarely have I seen lyrics written in their original script.\n\nQuestion is why? And do you think this is okay?\n\nI want to put forth some points as to why I think this is NOT ok.\n\n* We (the young and working age people) are already used to so much English around us in daily life, that many a times we don\'t even feel the need of a second language to get us our work done. Lesser dependence on a language means lesser usage, which also means lesser need to learn it. This will eventually snowball into a state where people will no longer need this "second" language, (which actually happens to be our mother-tongue) and everything will be done in English only. This is scary. I guess Sanskrit too has gone on a similar path.\n* Also, the youth which is highly influenced by movies and songs etc., have pretty much become habituated to reading lyrics of Hindi songs in English, or for that matter even sending messages, chatting/whatsapp etc. which are in their mother-tongue but written using the English alphabet. \n* I am already seeing the impact of this on myself and fear what will happen to the future generations. I did my education from a convent school. Despite having Marathi and Hindi as language subjects from class 2 &amp; 5 respectively, I never really relied on them. I must have written in devenagari script the last time some 15 years ago when I gave the SSC exams. Plus I hardly read any Hindi/Marathi as all my needs are sufficed by knowing English. I don\'t want my kid to go on this path.\n\nPlease note, I am not saying we should not use English as a language, or that I do not like English. My point is use English where English is suited (like I did in this post). But if a song is in Hindi, using a Hindi script (devnagari) is a no-brainer.\n\nWhat I am I doing, on my part, for this issue - \n\n* In various music apps, I have already given this as a feedback and requested for lyrics to be written in the original script. Probably to get this to work, these apps will need to get lot of similar feedback from a large amount of people.\n* In whatsapp etc. I have started typing in Devanagari when chatting with my Hindi/Marathi speaking friends/relatives. It took some effort initially but now it is smooth.\n* To help with my vocab I have also started reading Hindi poems nowadays.\n\nAlso please don\'t say that this is a trivial non-issue, because it is not. Our language is part of our identity. Imagine if entire India tomorrow starts speaking only English. How weird and out-of-place would we feel?\n\nAnyone else has similar thoughts? Or wants to say anything?'<br />Author: 'zvckp'  id: 'h09l4e'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/h09l4e/why_are_lyrics_of_indian_songs_always_written_in/</li>

Adding to the fuel of conventional BJP trolls and media, Pawan Kalyan also joined BJP and the attack has been from all the corners. But, we really need to take a look at the way things have been going around in **TTD (Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam)** to understand how the entire narrative is just false propaganda, keeping in light the faith of CM YS Jagan is Christianity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, it all began when TDP and BJP attacked on the issue of appointment of YV Subbareddy as the TTD board member. Siting he is a Christian but the bubble burst in a moment when Subramaniam Swami released a statement on YV Subbareddy's legitimate Hindu faith\n\n[https://twitter.com/swamy39/status/1136863686532902912?lang=en](https://twitter.com/swamy39/status/1136863686532902912?lang=en)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icJWDdab5qQ&amp;list=UUZ9m4KOh8Ei60428xeGYDCQ&amp;index=119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icJWDdab5qQ&amp;list=UUZ9m4KOh8Ei60428xeGYDCQ&amp;index=119)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter this, there was an attack on the recent decision by TTD board to auction some of the Temple owned lands in Tamilnadu. After an outcry from BJP and media, YS Jagan asked the TTD officials to stop the auction. The whole case is, TTD was used to monetize donated non-performing assets for decades to avoid encroachment. It is not a government issue at all. But anyhow, there was an outrage and keeping in mind the faith of devotees, YS Jagan interfered on the issue and ask the officials to stop the auction immediately.\n\nHere is a mouthpiece of BJP explaining the issue but with as much mud-sliding they can do:  [https://www.opindia.com/2020/05/andhra-government-stalls-the-auction-of-50-properties-owned-by-tirupati-tirumala-temple-board/](https://www.opindia.com/2020/05/andhra-government-stalls-the-auction-of-50-properties-owned-by-tirupati-tirumala-temple-board/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gau-Mata Temple**\n\nNow there is another order, from TTD to build a temple for Gau Mata under the hills of Tirumala for devotees to start their journey from. Now, this is a remarkable decision, but No BJP mouthpieces has hailed the decision so far.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Salaries of Temple priests**\n\nTemple priests of Andhra Pradesh gets a salary of 18000 to 35000 depending upon their seniority and work. This benefits more than 30000 priests. Andhra Pradesh is the only state that is providing such high salaries to Hindu priests. Even the priest of Ayodhya Ram mandir is getting a mere 13000 per month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lockdown Support**\n\nDuring lockdown induced by COVID19, when all places of worship were closed, Andhra Pradesh is the only state that provided Rs.5000 to Temple Priests twice. This supported more than 31000 temple priests.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Nayee Brahmins**\n\nA community that has always been in shadows in Hindu culture is Nayee Brahmins (Barbers). This community is a big part of any Hindu ritual but rarely gets any acknowledgment from any Government. YS Jagan led AP Government floated a scheme called  [JaganannaChedhodu](https://twitter.com/hashtag/JaganannaChedhodu?src=hashtag_click) under which, Government provides Rs.10000 to barbers, tailers, and more than 82000 Rajaka hindus. this scheme benefits more than 38000 barbers and more than 125000 tailors.\n\n[https://twitter.com/sindhubarghavi/status/1270632606623621120?s=20](https://twitter.com/sindhubarghavi/status/1270632606623621120?s=20)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlong with all these path-breaking schemes, YS Jagan has released more than 60 big schemes in the first year of operation that benefits people of Andhra Pradesh regardless of their faith and political alignments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCompared to BJP-TDP Government which won in 2014 but failed to fulfil a single poll promise in 5 years, YS Jagan has fulfilled 90% promises in one year only. Along with this Andhra Pradesh is doing a phenomenal job in handling COVID19 situation, which is scaring the entire opposition parties. This is the only reason, why there is so much hate on media and social media for YS Jagan.\n\nBut YS Jagan is the leader of people with more than 85% majority in the assembly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am working on a separate thread on education, the priority of YS jagan.

The santas, being always in a compact of love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda (the giver of all pleasures), or Mukunda (the giver of liberation), or Kṛṣṇa (the all-attractive person), cannot accept anything without first offering it to the Supreme Person. Therefore, such devotees always perform yajñas in different modes of devotional service, such as śravaṇam, kīrtanam, smaraṇam, arcanam, etc., and these performances of yajñas keep them always aloof from all kinds of contamination of sinful association in the material world. Others, who prepare food for self or sense gratification, are not only thieves, but are also the eaters of all kinds of sins. How can a person be happy if he is both a thief and sinful? It is not possible. Therefore, in order for people to become happy in all respects, they must be taught to perform the easy process of saṅkīrtana-yajña, in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

But he didn't want others to feel sidelined or neglected. So, in his usual diplomatic way, he indicated that Bhisma was now an old man and would need the support of the others in the army. This way he did not want anybody to feel neglected.\n\nIt was also important that grandfather Bhisma was protected (as he is the commander) and thus this verse is important. If he is busy fighting on one side and the enemy takes advantage and attacks from other direction, it would be disastrous. So, it was important that the warriors support him and not break phalanx. Duryodhana strongly felt that the victory of Kurus highly depended on the presence of Bhismadeva.\n\nHe was confident of the full support of Bhīṣmadeva and Droṇācārya in the battle because he well knew that they did not even speak a word when Arjuna’s wife Draupadī, in her helpless condition, had appealed to them for justice while she was being forced to appear naked in the presence of all the great generals in the assembly. Although he knew that the two generals had some sort of affection for the Pāṇḍavas, he hoped that these generals would now completely give it up, as they had done during the gambling performances. \n\nBhisma understood what Duryodhana was feeling and that he was actually a bit scared on seeing the Pandava army. So, to comfort him, he blew his conchshell very loudly, befitting his position as a lion. Even though he knew that there is no chance of their victory, because the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna was on the other side. But still, it was his duty to fight and conduct himself accordingly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **How can you help me:**\n\nThis will be my primary project. I want it to reach as many people as possible.

Also, raising animals for slaughter consumes a huge amount of agricultural land and water, and causes tremendous pollution.\n\n2. This Christmas, don't keep a tree in your house or your church.

      <li>Title::: "KALI 5000 weapon &amp; Surya Missile- India's top secret weapon &amp; India's most lethal missile."<br />Body: '#Kali 5000 weapon\n\nKALI 5000 is India’s warfare weapon under development which can stop missiles, air crafts, enemy satellites anything with an electric circuit inside it.KALI stands for Kilo Ampere Linear Injector. It is a linear electron accelerator being developed by DRDO( Defence Research and Development Organisation ) and BARC (Bhaba Atomic Research Centre ). KALI was developed by keeping an industrial mindset but later when the developers understood the great potential of KALI as a weapon, they researched further into the subject and now they are working towards fulfilling it.\n\nIt is designed to work in such a way that if a missile is launched in India’s direction, it will quickly emit powerful pulses of Relativistic Electrons Beams (REB).\n\n**Applications**:\n\n1.The KALI has been put to various uses by the DRDO. The DRDO was involved in configuring the KALI for their use.It can be utilized as an Anti-satellite weapon by making it perfect with some medium range rocket and it very well might be an exact response to the Chinese hostile to satellite rocket.\n\n2. It has also helped in designing electrostatic shields to “harden” the LCA and missiles from microwave attack by the enemy as well as protecting satellites against deadly Electromagnetic Impulses (EMI) generated by nuclear weapons and other cosmic disturbances, which “fry” and destroy electronic circuits. Electronic components currently used in missiles can withstand fields of approx. 300 V/cm, while the fields in case of EMI attack reach thousands of V/cm.\n\n**There have been reports of placing the weaponized KALI in an IL-76 aircraft as an airborne defense system. Government of India has denied to give any information on this project due to its sensitiveness for national security.**\n\n#Surya Missile \n\nSurya Missile is an intercontinental ballistic missile under development by the DRDO for the use of the Indian Armed Forces. Surya Missile will be a four-stage intercontinental ballistic missile. Surya Missile will carry a massive three-tonne warhead, thrice the weight of the one-tonne warhead that Agni missiles have carried so far. This will allow each missile to launch several nuclear warheads -Multiple Independently Targetable Re-entry Warheads (MIRVs) – with each warhead striking a different target. Each warhead – called Maneuverable Reentry Vehicle (MARV) – performs evasive maneuvers while hurtling down towards its target, confusing enemy air defence missiles that are trying to destroy them mid-air. And these maneuverable warheads will give Agni VI an extended range exact figure of which is currently classified. It will be taller than its predecessor Agni V, and is expected to be flight tested by 2017. Agni-VI missile is likely to carry up to 10 MIRV warheads and will have a strike range of 8,000 km to 12,000 km.\n\n**Capabilities**: \n\n1. The range of missile might go up to the range of 10,000 kms as stated in the appointment letter of Dr Avinash Chander, the capability would for the first time can engage any target based even at Europe and many of US strategic assets situated worldwide. The entire Chinese landmass would be covered by this forthcoming ICBM, supposedly to be named as Surya, the exact nomenclature has long been denied by MoD and the DRDO officials.\n\n2. The Surya missile would thus give India a Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) capability and bring some kind of strategic parity with China in a very asymmetric ICBM capability. China is reported to possess more than 400 ICBMs and is deployed in various directions, whereas, India’s strategic missile program is directed mainly towards China with which India has long standing border and territorial dispute and in the environment of asymmetric unconventional warfare, theSurya Missile would give a moral strength to Indian armed forces and can dare to challenge the Chinese forces on the 4000 kms long Line Of Actual Control.\n\n3. But in real sense the Surya Missile with range of 12000 Km will herald India in the super power league of countries possessing the very long range Inter continental Ballistic Missile with multiple warheads and will definitely act as a deterrent to any power on earth, however mighty that power may be.\n\n**In the context of India facing the prospect of fighting a two front war, there is an imminent need to accelerate development of a full fledged ICBM. Moreover, a well proven ICBM capability is crucially vital for India to be recognised as a global super power. Of course, both Agni-V and Agni-VI are being looked on as ICBMs. But then in the conventional strategic thinking, only a missile with a range of 10,000-km plus is counted as a full fledged ICBM. And India should not vacillate in taking up the challenge of developing a family of ICBMs with 10,000-km plus range.**\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Source for KALI5000](https://defenceupdate.in/kali-5000-indias-top-secret-weapon-pakistan-china-fears/) , [Source for Surya Missile](https://defenceupdate.in/surya-indias-most-lethal-missile-update/)'<br />Author: 'OnlysliMs'  id: 'gzpnzt'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gzpnzt/kali_5000_weapon_surya_missile_indias_top_secret/</li>

Athar is alleged to have brought the protesters who were carrying guns, sickles, etc. \n\nHowever, yesterday, when the chargesheet of murder of Ratan Lal was released, there was no Mohammad Athar in the chargesheet. Now maybe because it\'s because Athar is innocent &amp; locals were wrong.\n\nBut let\'s also remember that Inspector Vishal isn\'t the first police officer who was involved with investigating Delhi riots investigators to ~~be murdered~~ died under mysterious circumstances. Even IB officer Ankit Sharma who was performing duty incognito in Tahir Hussain\'s locality was the first to be not just murdered, but brutally murdered, stabbed 51 times &amp; then thrown into the drain as a targeted killing of the IB/police force. What nexus had Ankit Sharma uncovered that he was tortured so much before death?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gy62q2/a_police_officer_who_was_part_of_delhi_police/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gvpvdg/big_delhi_police_chargesheet_says_ib_official/\n\nLet\'s also remember that up till 2 days before ~~murder~~mysterious death of Inspector Vishal, Kejriwal government was fighting a legal battle to let AAP lawyers represent Delhi police force in prosecution cases against ex-AAP MLA Tahir Hussain &amp; other Delhi case riots. \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gtxeo9/these_articles_explain_why_inspite_of_delhi/\n\nAmanatullah Khan even today is trying to save Tahir Hussain saying the only reason Tahir Hussain has been charged by Delhi police is because he is a Muslim. [Just before the riots, Tahir Hussain had called Amanatullah 56 times, Sisodiya 18 times &amp; Kejriwal 3 times.](https://www.organiser.org/Encyc/2020/3/3/Tahir-Hussain-trail-leads-to-Arvind-Kejriwal-and-Manish-Sisodia.amp.html) Yet even today, even with multiple AAP leaders being named by locals in bringing the riot mobs, Tahir Hussain is painted by the media to be the sole mastermind of riots. Maybe a plain corporator indeed is the sole mastermind of the riots planned the exact days current PM was in global spotlight, maybe no other PM aspirants were involved in/had knowledge of these riots.\n\nAfter Epstein **killed himself**, all the pedo-ring investigations in US went cold. Given now even police officers investigating the case are being murdered, would the big names, the real names behind the riots be charged?'<br />Author: 'brackenlassie'  id: 'gzpgtp'<br />Score:30<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gzpgtp/since_the_police_inspector_investigating_delhi/</li>

I know it sounds too much but since I don't have to go out so I am overdoing it.\n\nI have seen people who don't use oil or use non sticky.\n\nI researched a little bit and everywhere people suggested to use pure oil. It doesn't matter whether mustard or coconut or sth else but prefer pure oil. Avoid non sticky oils, Infact they are worst. They mix it with some Petroleum product which is odourless and colourless. It is certainly not good for hairs.\n\nAnother suggestion, to use green tea on hairs. Use green tea water, and you can add more ingredients like tulsi or whatever you think might add more nutrition.\n\nI just wanted to know if anyone here oil their hair daily. What do you use..? I use Patanjali mustard oil and coconut oil. They claim to be 100% pure and seem to work fine for me. Any improvement I noticed, my hairs are growing faster. I am using oil from past 2 months daily, I think they are growing faster than before. I don't have any way to confirm, it just what I felt.

But one who enjoys these gifts, without offering them to the demigods in return, is certainly a thief.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe demigods are authorized supplying agents on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu. Therefore, they must be satisfied by the performance of prescribed yajñas. In the Vedas, there are different kinds of yajñas prescribed for different kinds of demigods, but all are ultimately offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For one who cannot understand what the Personality of Godhead is, sacrifice to the demigods is recommended. According to the different material qualities of the persons concerned, different types of yajñas are recommended in the Vedas. Worship of different demigods is also on the same basis-namely, according to different qualities. For example, the meat-eaters are recommended to worship the goddess Kālī, the ghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess the sacrifice of animals is recommended. But for those who are in the mode of goodness, the transcendental worship of Viṣṇu is recommended. But ultimately, all yajñas are meant for gradual promotion to the transcendental position. For ordinary men, at least five yajñas, known as pañca-mahāyajña, are necessary.\n\nOne should know, however, that all the necessities of life that the human society requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one can manufacture anything. Take, for example, all the eatables of human society. These eatables include grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar, etc., for the persons in the mode of goodness, and also eatables for the nonvegetarians, like meats, etc., none of which can be manufactured by men. Then again, take for example heat, light, water, air, etc., which are also necessities of life-none of them can be manufactured by the human society. Without the Supreme Lord, there can be no profuse sunlight, moonlight, rainfall, breeze, etc., without which no one can live. Obviously, our life is dependant on supplies from the Lord. Even for our manufacturing enterprises, we require so many raw materials like metal, sulphur, mercury, manganese, and so many essentials-all of which are supplied by the agents of the Lord, with the purpose that we should make proper use of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the purpose of self-realization, leading to the ultimate goal of life, namely, liberation from the material struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained by performance of yajñas. If we forget the purpose of human life and simply take supplies from the agents of the Lord for sense gratification and become more and more entangled in material existence, which is not the purpose of creation, certainly we become thieves, and therefore we are punished by the laws of material nature. A society of thieves can never be happy because they have no aim in life. The gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life. They are simply directed to sense gratification; nor do they have knowledge of how to perform yajñas. Lord Caitanya, however, inaugurated the easiest performance of yajña, namely the saṅkīrtana-yajña, which can be performed by anyone in the world who accepts the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n**Question 1 : Why Vedas recommend different types of sacrifices (yajñas) and different types of demigod worship ? What is the ultimate aim of all these yajñas ?**\n\n**Question 2 : What are the consequences of using necessities of life and essentials supplied by the supreme lord for our own sense-gratification without performing yajñas ?**\n\n**Question 3 : FITB : Lord Caitanya, however, inaugurated the easiest performance of yajña, namely \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a2zt23rect351.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9e2423061afec3a2ee80f1593a7ba756514435c\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'gzg0gk'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gzg0gk/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_312/</li>

Tribals were assaulted and killed if they didn\'t pay their annual "tax" or if they were suspected to be informers.\nBuddhist and Hindu temples were ransacked and set afire. Advisories were issued by the insurgents against attending Durga Puja and other festivals. Tens of thousands of tribals were forcibly converted to Christianity. Leading tribal priests like Shanti Kali were killed and the womenfolk raped by the NLFT.\n\n\nThings got so bad that the state government had to initiate a move to change the succession laws because many families were not in a position to run their businesses after the head of the family had been abducted. Since the head would normally be the superintending authority of the business and since he could not be declared dead until the body was recovered, banks and financial institutions would not accept the legal authority of the successors.\n\n\nManik Sarkar early on realized that a policy of appeasement was certainly not going to deal either with insurgency or bring about confidence among the dominant Bengali Hindu population or the tribal minority.\n\n\nHe decided to design his own external security policy, with the police, intelligence officials and the army to take out insurgent elements, **with minimal contact with New Delhi.**\n\n\nTripura State Rifles were better equipped and re-trained to live off the lands in the hilly interiors. So that they could dominate the area as they went after the insurgents. Insurgents who wanted to leave were given lucrative sums of money to attack their colleagues before surrendering. Bangladeshi gangs and thugs were paid off to do the same. Deniability was maintained with Delhi to avoid interference.\n\n\nCross border raids into insurgent camps in Bangladesh were launched **without informing Dhaka (or even Delhi !)**. Around twenty attacks were launched on militants based across the border in Bangladesh between 2003–2006. \n\n\nThe situation improved so dramatically that Manik Sarkar **lifted the application of the draconian AFSPA in 2015.** (after security forces exhaustively reviewed the law and order situation in the state.) Something that is unprecedented for this part of India. Where despite significant social and political pressure, AFSPA continues to be applied, many places for over 60 years.'<br />Author: 'LichchaviPrincess'  id: 'gzf9ix'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gzf9ix/the_brutal_insurgency_in_tripura_and_how_manik/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Story of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin's hatred for Indians"<br />Body: '**Context:**\n\nIndians in Uganda were known to be the most successful of communities in the country. They controlled all the big businesses, bars and lived in gated communities away from the local African population. Indians lived rather lavishly, at the time they were not more than 2-3% of the total population, but owned 90% of the businesses and made for 90% of the tax revenues. Even today after all the expulsion, they are 1% of the population yet contribute to roughly 2/3 of the tax revenues.\n\nAfricans were usually employed under them as servants or lower rank officers. Their conditions in comparison were substandard, leading to resentment for their Indian bosses. \n\nThough \'Africanisation\' and Indophobia had been in policy since President Milton Obote, it was Idi Amin who put the policy of expulsion into effect. \n\n**Story begins** in 1972 at an Asian community function in a gated community in the capital, Kampala where rich businessmen and powerful politicians were invited. Idi Amin, who had seized power the prior year through a military coup after his rift with Obote, was among the guests. At the party, he saw a beautiful girl. She was the daughter of Sherali Bandari Jaffer, who was the owner the Fairway Hotel in Kampala. But there was a catch: she was already married to an Indian man.\n\n**Fun fact:** Only roughly 2 years ago, Sherali Bandari Jaffer\'s son Aneeze Sherali Bandari Jaffer died at 63 of mysterious causes while visiting Canada for his son\'s wedding. His father who was at the party died at 90 years and was buried in Uganda as per his wishes.\n\nAnyways, Idi Amin was known to be very attracted to women. In the past, when working for the British to quell rebellions in Kenya, he is known to have fathered many children there. He would 7 wives throughout his life, 3 of which he divorced. He was also a satyromaniac - a woman turning his advances for sex would turn him livid. From his 7 officially recognised wives, he had 40 children.\n\nAt the time, Amin intended to marry Jaffer\'s daughter. He was willing to go as per the Muslim tradition (as they were both Muslim) and officially divorce one of his 4 wives. Consequently, he requested Jaffer to give his daughter\'s hand in marriage. \n\nJaffer knew of this and understood that, with his political power, Amin could essentially force him to give his daughter through threats and blackmailing and that \'no\' was not an acceptable answer. Jaffer was terrified. At first, he politely told him that he would consult with the family but would respond soon.\n\nBut the following day, under the cover of darkness, he arranged for a car to smuggle his family out of the country to first Nairobi and later India. Jaffer had investments in the country, so he would stay back and take care of the business in Uganda.\n\nAmin, the next day was upbeat thinking he was going to get his beautiful daughter, but upon hearing Jaffer\'s lame excuse that she had left the country and the community did not allow, Amin was furious. In the next day itself, out of revenge for what he considered racial discrimination against him, he put out the order for non-citizen "Asians" to be leave the country within 90 days. \n\nSources:\n\n[The Guardian Angel, by Arnold Spero Bisase - p. 203-207](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Guardian_Angel/4nocbzSqRC8C?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1)\n\n[This Man I Call Father’ BY JUSTIN ROHRLICH](https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/04/07/this-man-i-call-father/)\n\n[Idi Amin\'s Asian Expulsion](https://youtu.be/p-i0JVip9N4)'<br />Author: 'KingfisherPlayboy'  id: 'gzbydg'<br />Score:44<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gzbydg/story_of_ugandan_dictator_idi_amins_hatred_for/</li>

Then after finishing the present material body, they can enter into the kingdom of God. That is the whole program for the conditioned soul. "\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n**Question 2 : What are the benefits of performing yajñas (sacrifice) ? What kind of yajña is recommended for this age of Kali and Why ?**\n\n**Answer 2 :** "By performance of yajña, the conditioned souls gradually become Kṛṣṇa conscious and become godly in all respects. In this age of Kali, the saṅkīrtana-yajña (the chanting of the names of God) is recommended by the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was introduced by Lord Caitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age. Saṅkīrtana-yajña and Kṛṣṇa consciousness go well together. Lord Kṛṣṇa in His devotional form (as Lord Caitanya) is mentioned in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam as follows, with special reference to the saṅkīrtana-yajña:kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇāṁ sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadamyajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ"In this age of Kali, people who are endowed with sufficient intelligence will worship the Lord, who is accompanied by His associates, by performance of saṅkīrtana-yajña." (Bhāg. 11.5.29) Other yajñas prescribed in the Vedic literatures are not easy to perform in this age of Kali, but the saṅkīrtana-yajña is easy and sublime for all purposes."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 3.10, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

Now we cannot access our land and the neighbour has exclusive right to certain part of our land. \n\nWe have taken up the issue with out neighbour and are in talks with him. Our enighbour has been gathering people on his side. Seems like he want to settle this by force. We have started doing the same but he is sitting on our land and until he vacate it he is a winner already. \n\nI want our land back. Media got interested in this whole affair. To my surprise when media asked my kaka, who is head of our family, what he will do about someone else sitting on his land he said no one has trespassed on our land, he said the land is disputed and the tent is not actually on our land but on disputed land. Many elders on our side voiced the same opinion. They said its a matter of perception. \n\nWhen the media asked the neighbor and his family they said they are on their land and will not vacate it.\n\nI was furious at kaka’s stupidity who called our own land disputed while the neighbour called it his own land without hesitation and is now sitting on it. If we say no one has entered our land what right do we have to ask him to move out? \n\nIf you come across two people fighting for land, one of them says the land belong to him and other one says the land is disputed thereby admitting the claim of a second person to it who sounds more sure of himself and who do you think the land belong to? \n\nI wanted to confront kaka but my cousins said kaka knows better and that I should not talk to him like that. That i am saying all this cause I hate kaka. \n\nThey tried to paint me as guilty and kaka a saint without uttering a word about how we will get our land and how can we drive neighbour out when we are not even willing to accept the neighbour’s tent is on our land.'<br />Author: 'l6_6l'  id: 'gyx372'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gyx372/when_the_neighbor_came_in_and_built_a_tent_on_our/</li>
