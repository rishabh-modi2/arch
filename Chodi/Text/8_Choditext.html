With the passing of General Rawat, spotlight will be again on the maintenance schedules of the helicopters and the pilot error and whose government put in the requisition of the helicopter and all that, but the point remains that General Rawat is just another body on a pile of corpses that have bit the dust for serving Bharat. \n\n\n##A whopping 1733 staff and scientists and armed forces personnel have died under mysterious conditions in just the past 20 years – \n\n**680 scientists and allied staff from Bhabha Atomic Research Centre** have died of mysterious causes in the past. Most of these have been suicides. \n\n\n**10 scientists of Department of Atomic Energy** have died due to murders and other unnatural causes that include mysterious fires.\n\n\n**684 personnel of ISRO** have died of unnatural causes in the last 20 years. This includes 387 dead in the associate units of ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Centre, Space Applications Centre, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre.\n\n\n297 high level administrators have died working in the ISRO Headquarters itself.\n\n\nThe death toll may be way higher since the related organizations never reveal their staff who die of mysterious deaths.\n\n\nEven their death certificates do not specify the cause of death for security reasons.\n\n\n\n##Many of the causes of these strange deaths are disturbing and seem to be lifted from a cheap spy movie – \n\nTwo Naval officers assigned as engineers to the freshly inaugurated nuclear submarine INS Arihant were found dead on railway tracks, run over by a train.\n\n\nMore than 100 staff and scientists of Kaiga Atomic Power Station at Karwar, Karnataka died and were hospitalised after drinking poisoned water from a water cooler in their office. Coincidentally Karwar also houses one of Indian Navy’s most expensive Naval Stations and also the most secretive one.\n\n\nL Mahalingam, a senior scientist from the same nuclear station went for a morning walk and never returned.\n\n\nMahadevan Padmanabhan Iyer, an engineer at BARC was found dead and heart attack was declared the cause of. But the autopsy later confirmed murder. He was allegedly a victim of a dreaded assassination experiment that caused a brain hemorrhage.\n\n\nOne such senior scientist has even survived a poisoning attempt when his dosa dish was laced. Fortunately the scientist working for the ISRO survived.\n\n\n##India has a history of losing important people to sabotage - \n\nAnd with regards to the government response, it seems that none of the governments want to reveal any foul play it seems. But this is not new. We know for a fact that Subhas Chandra Bose’s death was not natural and the government itself had admitted that declassifying that information would be detrimental to foreign relations with major “allies”. He is reported to have died in a plane “crash” too.\n\n\nThen comes the deaths of Dr. Homi Bhabha and Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, who died of mysterious circumstances when away from the country. No government has attempted to declassify the investigations behind their deaths either. \n\n\nA few years after Homi Bhabha’s death, Vikram Sarabhai, the father of the Indian Space program was found dead in his hotel room.\n\n\nIt is to be noted that both Shastri and Bhabha died discussing the possibility of India’s first underground nuclear test. \n\n\n**It is to be also noted that Jawaharlal Nehru and M K Gandhi were both vehemently against the nuclear bomb and hence India never pursued it.** It was Shastri who wanted India to develop one after 1965 war. And when he flew to Tashkent to sign the armistice with General Ayub Khan of Pakistan, he was dead a day after the signing of the peace treaty.\n\n\nIt does not seem a surprise that a sitting prime minister has been betrayed by the Pakistani counterpart after signing a peace treaty. Vajpayee suffered the same result after coming from Lahore and then there was the Kargil War. Here too a General of the Pakistani Army backstabbed.\n\n\nThere is no question that a foreign hand is at play in the deaths of these esteemed individuals. The motive is simple – to limit the capabilities of India as a space and nuclear power. The trend is very simple - kill the people who want India to progress forward, be it the leaders or the scientists taking the responsibility in themselves to further India's Nuclear and Space research.\n\n\n**There are multiple reports where foreign entities have meddled with India's capability to develop a cryogenic engine for itself, making deep space missions possible.** A report claims that Indian Space Program was set back by a whopping 20 years because of this sabotage. We are still working on perfecting the cryogenic engine.\n\n\nThe Indian Government must make sure that these sleeper agents trying to sabotage India’s sovereignty by assassinating key personnel must be apprehended and caught and dealt with a critical hand. \n\n\nWe cannot take this lightly anymore.\n\n\n*Aum Shanti Shanti Shantihi.*\n\n\n\nSources – \n\n24 scientists and allied nuclear staff die due to mysterious circumstances - \n\nhttps://www.theweek.in/news/india/2021/01/06/from-the-archives-when-several-indian-nuclear-scientists-died-mysteriously.html\n\n11 top nuclear scientists died between 2009 to 2013, as per government data -\n\nhttps://www.ndtv.com/india-news/11-indian-nuclear-scientists-died-unnatural-deaths-in-4-years-1229793\n\n684 ISRO staff died in 15 years in this story filed in 2011 –\n\nhttps://www.rediff.com/news/report/isro-mum-on-how-684-of-its-staff-died/20110113.htm\n\nA whopping 680 unnatural deaths at BARC - \n\nhttps://asiatimes.com/2019/07/indias-vanishing-nuclear-scientists/\n\nGregory Douglas, a journalist claims CIA hand - \n\nhttps://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/unnatural-deaths-1502589589.html\n\nSabotaging Indian Space Program's development of a cryogenic engine - \n\nhttps://www.rediff.com/news/column/who-killed-the-isros-cryogenic-engine/20131118.htm\n\nSenior ISRO scientist claims to be poisoned -\n\nhttps://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/someone-definitely-wanted-to-harm-isro-scientist-on-claim-of-being-poisoned/story-lcT2c9N3q7beGgWgeDQqKP.html\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0"<br />Author: 'Critavarma'<br />id: 'rbrgco'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'RIP CDS General Bipin Rawat PVSM UYSM AVSM YSM SM VSM ADC'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'CursedTombstone'<br />id: 'rbrbxl'<br />Flair :News 📰</li><li>Title: 'Update bhratas- Our Beloved son of the country General Bipin Rawat ji lost his life in the unexpected tragic accident of the helicopter along with his wife and other 12 people May his soul rest in peace Om Shanti.'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'rbraro'<br />Flair :News 📰</li><li>Title: 'CDS BIPIN RAWAT'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Sundar_lal'<br />id: 'rbr0p6'<br />Flair :News 📰</li><li>Title: 'Om Shanti'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'rbqgvc'<br />Flair :News 📰</li><li>Title: 'Guys...'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'trander6face'<br />id: 'rbprzp'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihaad_Halal Certified</li><li>Title: 'meanwhile randia'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Noob_Difficulty'<br />id: 'rbpp6t'<br />Flair ::HighIQ: Randia Simulation</li><li>Title: "Please ignore Pakistanis today.

Man does not live by bread alone. It is unwise to attribute all human behaviour to economic factors alone.\n2. The industrial age should be welcomed. Although handicrafts have their role in national economy and should be encouraged, machines should do national production on a large scale.\n3. Peasants and workers are the backbone of the society and should get reasonable share of national income, so that they can lead an average life, free from wants. Their villages need to be invigorated. Since they are part and parcel of the nation they should share the common duties and obligations.\n4. The interest of both the Capital and the Labour should be subordinated to the interests of the Nation as a whole\n5. The State would take every step to protect national industries from foreign competition.\n6. Key industries, manufactures and such other items should be nationalized if the National Government can afford to do so and conduct them more efficiently than private enterprise. The same principle applies to agriculture.\n7. All strikes and lockouts, which undermine and cripple national industries or production should be referred to State arbitration and settled or quelled if serious.\n8. Private property, in general, should not be violated. In no case, the State should appropriate private property without reasonable recompense. Savarkar was totally against landlordism."<br />Author: 'PeanutOk3759'<br />id: 'r9liiu'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'neckbeards incels (omega males) explained in bhagwat gita.'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Horror_bot12'<br />id: 'r9ki2z'<br />Flair ::HighIQ: Randia Simulation</li><li>Title: "India's political spectrum"<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'yuyutsu_ho_'<br />id: 'r9jlha'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Sorry State of Hindi in the story of Bharat'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'udupa82'<br />id: 'r9ja7c'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Sigma Army Rules'<br />Body: '[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKN2Efogmz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKN2Efogmz8)'<br />Author: 'shadowarrrior69'<br />id: 'r9gmp2'<br />Flair :PKMKB_Boys played well 🇵🇰</li><li>Title: 'Add some more flairs'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'shashroy'<br />id: 'r9fvzh'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Another spitter on food caught on camera: Meerut Police arrest Naushad for spitting on dough while making roti at a party'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'shashroy'<br />id: 'r9fobl'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihaad_Halal Certified</li><li>Title: 'Maharashtra: Shyam Rathod (22) brutally murdered with swords &amp; knives in the Daulat Khan town of Yavatmal.

There are 8 levels of recognition in the United Nations for any country, The topmost recognition is held by 5 countries only - the US, China, UK, France, Russia; Even India is not on this list. KAILASA has the PRELIMINARY nation recognition at the United Nations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nH.E. Sri Nithya Mokshapriyananda, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, Permanent Representative of Kailasa Nation to the United Nations representing the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism (SPH) Jagat Guru Mahasannidhanam (JGM) His Divine Holiness (HDH) Bhagavan Sri Nithyananda Paramashivam and the Permanent Mission of Kailasa Nation to the United Nations, is addressing the United Nations live.\n\nVideo link to the full LIVE video from the official UN website ( From 1 hr 24 min to 1 hr 26 min 20 sec ) :\n\n[https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1n/k1nlz2keec](https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1n/k1nlz2keec)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn behalf of all 2 billion Hindus, the KAILASA Nation presented to the United Nations about the persecution of Hindu Sampradayas in India during the 14th Session of the OHCRC\'s Forum on Minority Issues, Geneva, 2 and 3, December 2021.  The United Nations accepted the  KAILASA Nation and allowed KAILASA to present its case after the presentation from the Permanent Mission from India to the UN which focused on how Islamic and Christian minorities are safeguarded by the Indian Government.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Transcript of the presentation:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRespected Chairperson, esteemed delegates, and colleagues\n\nI represent the KAILASA Nation led by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism Sri Nithyananda Paramashivam which speaks on behalf of 2 billion practicing Hindus around the world who do not have a voice representing them in these International Forums.\n\nI want to specifically bring to light the attack on minority Hindu traditions inside India. Hinduism is not a monolithic religion but a collection of thousands of unique, enlightenment ecosystems called Sampradayas. In recent times many Hindu Gurus, Hindu minority traditions, and Temples have come under attack by majority ideologies and a large number of traditions have virtually disappeared.\n\nThere has been no recognition of the attacks in the first place by International Human Rights groups as in these cases it is difficult for outsiders to distinguish the attackers from the attacked.\n\nFor the past 10 years the KAILASA Nation and SPH Sri Nithyananda Paramashivam, have been attacked and silenced in India as a religious minority and a linguistic minority and because extremist elements are opposed to KAILASA’s stance when it comes to the rights of women, including otherwise marginalized Dalit women, and the rights of members of the LGBTQ+ and transgendered communities.\n\nIn 2019 KAILASA approached the OHCHR presenting the case of persecution. When this document reached the Indian media a well-funded defamation campaign was started by news sources supportive of the union government alleging treason and sedition on the part of Kailasa Nation. Again, a number of false cases were subsequently registered against the SPH and other KAILASA leaders, and one of our university campuses for women in the state of Gujarat was razed to the ground in a matter of days by mobs with the support of the Local Government.\n\nKAILASA has since submitted a number of reports on the persecution to various forums available within the UN but without much action taken.\n\nIn June 2021 KAILASA made a submission on the attacks on the ASMT women in the session by the UN Committee on Elimination of Discrimination against Women on the rights of indigenous women and further submitted reports on the steps to end Femicide and on Gender Justice. Later, in September,  KAILASA’s report, “Media Disinformation in India” was accepted by the Special Rapporteur for the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the report on  the effect of COVID on minorities and the multilateral solution to the COVID crisis was accepted by  the UN Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order\n\nAttacks on minorities span multiple dimensions and early identification of these attacks is critical. We present the following recommendations based on our experience as a persecuted minority tradition.\n\n1. The UN needs to pay special attention to attacks on Hindu Religious Minorities and other sub-traditions which can be difficult to distinguish from the majority groups but experience the same problems of persecution as other recognized minorities\n2. Indian Media’s unchecked hate speech against Hindu Gurus and Hindu customs needs to be curtailed – what is commonly referred to as trial by media.\n3. The tendency of Indian Judges to overreach into the rights of minority sub-traditions in the name of reform or play to public opinion created by the media hype needs to be stopped.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*Previous Submissions to the UN by KAILASA:\\*\\***\n\n**MEDIA DISINFORMATION IN INDIA**\n\nfor the UN Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Opinion and Expression\n\n[https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Expression/disinformation/2-Civil-society-organisations/Nithyanandeshwara-Hindu-Temple.pdf](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Expression/disinformation/2-Civil-society-organisations/Nithyanandeshwara-Hindu-Temple.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PREVENTION OF FEMICIDE**\n\nA REPORT BY THE ASMT HINDU COMMUNITY\n\nAPRIL 2021\n\n[https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/SR/Femicide/2021-submissions/CSOs/india-kailash-union.pdf](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/SR/Femicide/2021-submissions/CSOs/india-kailash-union.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GENDER JUSTICE AND THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF OPINION AND EXPRESSION**\n\nA REPORT BY THE ADI SHAIVITE MINORITY TRADITION (ASMT) HINDU COMMUNITY\n\nJUNE 2021\n\n[https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Expression/GenderJustice/2.%20CSOs/Kailash-Union.pdf](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Expression/GenderJustice/2.%20CSOs/Kailash-Union.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RIGHT OF INDIGENOUS WOMEN**\n\nA REPORT BY THE ADI SHAIVITE MINORITY TRADITION (ASMT) HINDU COMMUNITY (JUNE 2021)\n\n[https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/CEDAW/DGD24June2021/51.docx](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/CEDAW/DGD24June2021/51.docx)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COVID-19 AND MULTILATERALISM**\n\nA REPORT BY THE ADI SHAIVITE MINORITY TRADITION (ASMT) HINDU COMMUNITY KAILASH UNION (JUNE 2021)\n\n[https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/IntOrder/Multilateralism/AdiShaiviteMinorityTradition.pdf](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/IntOrder/Multilateralism/AdiShaiviteMinorityTradition.pdf)'<br />Author: 'ivanvelikanov'<br />id: 'r8heq1'<br />Flair :News 📰</li><li>Title: 'कूड़ा-न पढ़ोगे तो कूड़ा ही बनोगे!'<br />Body: '#कूड़ा-न पढ़ोगे तो कूड़ा ही बनोगे!'<br />Author: 'YellowHueHumour'<br />id: 'r8h9hm'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: 'Cleanliness in Hindu Temples'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Realistic_Oil9604'<br />id: 'r8gfa3'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: 'India should exploit current Pakistani situation in their own favour instead of loosing a golden opportunity on moral ground'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'yesibangedyamom'<br />id: 'r83hgg'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: "hate it or love it .trump may be a piece of the shit narcissist and a total jerk but he's way better, efficient, and effective than Joe Biden"<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'yesibangedyamom'<br />id: 'r8396l'<br />Flair :Wholesome Bakchodi :danklaugh:</li><li>Title: 'Is jai bhim a good movie to watch.'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Cherry-Kami'<br />id: 'r832hj'<br />Flair :DawoodWood (Entertainment) 🎥</li><li>Title: '🙏 🙏'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'r82sw3'<br />Flair :Wholesome Bakchodi :danklaugh:</li><li>Title: 'He might be sigma who knows'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'maxsean100'<br />id: 'r809kk'<br />Flair :Wholesome Bakchodi :danklaugh:</li><li>Title: 'Peacefully killed KAAFIR'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'skyrocketisphony'<br />id: 'r7ytub'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihaad_Halal Certified</li><li>Title: 'Toba toba ka maqam in Serbian embassy of Pakistan'<br />Body: 'Beda garak ho Endian hackers kay'<br />Author: 'ranjan_zehereela2014'<br />id: 'r7xh9y'<br />Flair :PKMKB_Boys played well 🇵🇰</li><li>Title: 'United nations in a nut shell'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'AdProper7454'<br />id: 'r7w52t'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'If you watch Cricket, How do you justify cricket balls made using cow leather?'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'whatadreamynight'<br />id: 'r7v5pp'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Srilankan man burnt alive in Pakistan!'<br />Body: "He was accused of Blasphemy!\n\n*Processing video gvuha6jnia381...*\n\nYou can see the body and the chants clearly!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing video 74goc7ppia381...*\n\nThis is the guy's Linkedin\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 8z2azr4uia381...*"<br />Author: 'K2aMadCho'<br />id: 'r7unyh'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihaad_Halal Certified</li><li>Title: 'Corporal Punishment in India, a sad reality.'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Accomplished-Win-626'<br />id: 'r7tbxj'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: "Why can't we see any right wing comedians, is there a relation between art and liberalism?"<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Vast-Ad9183'<br />id: 'r7t5e2'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: 'KAILASA nation -

We literally have female gods that are the centrepiece of Hinduism. This is the history of India up until very recently ~1608\n\n- Not sure of the statistics but the British took some trillions of dollars (adjusted for today) worth of jewels and resources\n\nNot only did they subject the innocent population of the nation to famines, extreme poverty, torture, slavery but they took away our advanced education systems, burnt our libraries and even threw in the occasional massacre.  \n\nSo such a drastic and traumatic event would obviously have caused generational trauma beyond calculation. \n\nOn top of all that they split the Hindus and Muslims into seperate nations before they left. Smart play because if they actually stopped fighting they could easily be the superpower but I digress \n\nI agree that this type of mentality is disgusting and needs to be addressed but what can you expect when most of these mfs can’t feed their kids let alone have the time to think about the rights of others and what they can wear \n\nI think the reason why videos like this hit us is because we live in a western first world bubble. We deal with people who are mostly politically correct and our issues are completely different. \n\nIt will take ages just how it has taken ages of negativity for it to get to this point but awareness should definitely be spread. Personally I think it starts with the education system but that’s a whole different topic. \n\nI also think these mentalities exist everywhere that there is poverty and ignorance but they are highlighted when it comes to India because of the sheer population and the negative filter of western media. I mean if you look at per capita stats India isn’t even top 30 and all of these so called developed nations have a higher rate.”\n\nI got bits and pieces of information from this sub over the months so just wanted to share this and say thanks for the inspiration. Honestly as a young expat, subs like these help bring me and I’m sure many others like me closer to our heritage.'<br />Author: 'skoobydoo_99'<br />id: 'r79ugj'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li><li>Title: 'formula nahi mantr bolenge'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Amartyanjan-K-2611'<br />id: 'r79lct'<br />Flair ::oc-: OC है BC!💡</li><li>Title: 'My time has come'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'skoobydoo_99'<br />id: 'r79efg'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li><li>Title: 'Vishnu Dharma Sutra 25 14'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'kishou_arima_'<br />id: 'r78h98'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: "IRSO - Italian Raul's Sevak Organization"<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'r74g5n'<br />Flair ::HighIQ: Randia Simulation</li><li>Title: 'First year experience at IIT.'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Uchiha-SHINO'<br />id: 'r733gj'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: "My wife's sister in law is hot and I always see her huge tits and fap.
