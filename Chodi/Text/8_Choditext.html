The Israelis and Arabs realized that, if they continued fighting, they would someday end up destroying the whole world. So they decided to settle their dispute with an ancient practice: a duel of two, like David and Goliath. This "duel" would be a dog fight. The negotiators agreed each side would take 5 years to develop the best fighting dog they could. The dog that won the fight would earn its people the right to rule the disputed areas. The losing side would have to lay down its arms for good.\n\n The Arabs found the biggest, meanest Dobermans and Rottweilers in the world. They bred them together and then crossed their offspring with the meanest Siberian wolves. They selected only the biggest, strongest puppy of each litter, fed it the best food and killed all the other puppies. \nThey used steroids and trainers in their quest for the perfect killing machine. When the 5 years were up, they had a dog that needed steel prison bars on its cage. Only expert trainers could handle this incredibly nasty and ferocious beast. \n\nWhen the day of the big dog-fight finally arrived, the Israelis showed up with a very strange-looking animal, a Dachshund that was 10 feet long! Everyone at the dogfight arena felt sorry for the Israelis. No one there seriously thought this weird, odd-looking animal stood any chance against the growling Arab beast. \n\nAll the bookies took one look and predicted that the Arab dog would win in less than a minute. \n\nAs the cages were opened, the Dachshund slowly waddled toward the center of the ring, watching the Arab dog. The Arab dog leaped from its cage and charged the giant wiener-dog. As he got to within an inch of the Israeli dog, the Dachshund opened its jaws wide and swallowed the Arab beast whole in one go! There was nothing left but a small puff of fur from the Arab killer dog\'s tail floating to the ground. \n\nThe stunned crowd of international observers, bookies and media personnel let out a collective gasp of disbelief and surprise. \n\nEventually, the Arabs along with the press approached the Israelis, muttering and shaking their heads in disbelief. "We do not understand," said the Arabs\' leader, "Our top scientists and breeders worked for 5 long years with the meanest, biggest Dobermans, Rottweilers and Siberian wolves, and they developed an incredible killing machine of a dog! What did you do?"\n\n \n*\n \n*\nThe Israelis replied. "We gave a team of our Plastic surgeons 5 years to make a Crocodile look like a Dog."😜😜😀'<br />Author: 'mainhoonmadrasi'<br />id: 'ng5pfc'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihaad_Halal Certified</li>

Went on to destroy relationship with countries helping India and lied on national TV. Additionally, Mamata too has unleashed Gunda raj &amp; genocide'<br />Body: 'Repeatedly Arvind Kejriwal has committed acts that were detremental and he has not been punished. He has repeatedly pulled shit that has caused great harm to India and he has been allowed to continue without facing any flak. Delhi oxygen hoarding and supply the blame went on center when in reality his party was the one hoarding oxygen cylinder and oxygen supply. He repeatedly flouts protocol eg airing CM, PM meet on live TV. Now creating a diplomatic crises and he seemingly once again got away. \n\nThese guys are going after countries that are actively helping India Ina bid to sabotage our covid response. This is a national security threat and the chill nature of Modi is allowing them to flourish. Similarly Mamata Banerjee unleashing a genocide against Hindus in West Bengal and launching a state sponsored Gunda raj and getting away with it is more worrying. If " MEDIA" the so called 4 th pillar of democracy ignored this than the central govt has everyright to go after these media houses.\n\nAdditionally, the tool.kit by Congress and it\'s unseen consequence on our national image, narrative and security is something to seriously think about. \n\nThese guys are not going opposition work no country has opposition like these. These guys are literally destroying are country and the one body with sole authority is letting them get away. If they\'re not taught a lesson now they will continue with more clandestine and brazen acts which will have far more issues in future.'<br />Author: 'Legionoo7'<br />id: 'ng4iti'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
<li>Title: 'You Realize Many are Calling for Abolishing the Constitution. How can I support that?'<br />Body: 'People use "anti-national" as a slur: well, being anti-constitution is the most anti-national thing anyone can be by default. \n\nIndian Govt. office holders swear to uphold only 3 things while doing their duty. SOVEREIGNTY, INTEGRITY and The constitution. \n\nHere, people seek to destroy this flawed book, but replace it with what? This heavy 10kg bullshit book has kept the country together much better than Pakistan, Nepal, or Bangladesh.. \n\nIt is our heritage, and it is our fountain of rights.\n\nIt is the ponderous glue to our sovereignty, and it has held this country together in a world where a country like ours would have long fallen apart in two, like Pakistan say. \n\nI don\'t want to see our semi functional system replaced with absolutely religious tyranny. All religions, including our dharma can and have fallen to tyranny of mind at different times. \n\nWell, Hinduism thankfully is an Individual\'s Dharma. Dharma is not religion, it is DUTY, my dharma here is preserve my AKHAND bharat, which is India for now, and it\'s constitution. \n\nI remain a Hindu by default but I have my own spiritual views, and I will support Hinduism but not Political religious radicalism. Education and compassion is my way. \n\nAlso many here are driven solely by Muslim hate which is stupid, I have seen casual Hindus become radical due to Muslim hate and then become atheist.. \n\nMy God given conscience can\'t allow genocide which is something else some people want. Muslims are People too. Strength demands peace by force, not eradication. \n\nI cannot condone actions which would break India\'s Integrity, and divide us into sectarian war. \n\nI\'m banned from r/andia, and I don\'t mind being banned from this place either. \n\nAlso Modi....he is nothing special. Just another eloquent strong man, charming the masses. The Sanatani follows his own way.'<br />Author: 'UwUniversalist'<br />id: 'ng3rcc'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

The media Indian and Western ones really like to make article about this particular subject. They know it will shared and all. I always taught it was just some uneducated and extremely religious/superstitious people who were doing this things. \n\nWith the Covid I saw a big amount of articles about this. So much that it’s like all of India is doing that. So can someone tell if it’s that prevalent? \n\nEven if I’m not Hindu I always respected the religion, but I have to say that some practice are weird/backwards and it should be reformed for modern times. Because it’s used against us Indians to mock us and they don’t care about what religion you are (like I am Christian and don’t practice that) for them we all do that, they see that as more of a cultural practice than a religious one. That don’t help our international image. \n\nLike I was saying I’m not Hindu but always respected it and I see it as part of my history. And it’s hard for me to go in the comment section of the articles that talks about cow dung/piss, most of them is filled with racist comments and all. So I want know what most of the Hindus think about this issue? Is it possible to stop it and reform this practice? \n\nIt really destroy our international image and seriously in 2021 all this cow dung/piss things is really backward.'<br />Author: 'Robin_T91'<br />id: 'nfh4ix'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Whatever, Israel vs. Palestine is still a Abrahamist vs. Abrahamist thing. We got no skin in the game, so stop sucking Israel ¢o¢k.'<br />Body: "Judaism, Xtianity, Islam are Abrahamic religions, in that they follow the same god, believing in His unitariness and solitariness. Consequently, their understanding of divinity is quite different from our Vedic view. We, the followers of the Vedas, have follow a different concept entirely, in that we believe in the omniscience of god, and see him inside everyone and everywhere.\n\nI know that this is a territorial dispute between them with origins in history/mythology, and you may ask how is this relevant in the present context. Well, you must know, because it matters, that Abrahamic religions, by default, are intolerant of non-believers and idol-worshippers (which includes Paganism); they are intolerant, because it is so mandated, towards other faiths, chief among them Vedic faith, for reasons already stated - there is no god except God. It's only because they're on the backfoot, due to various reasons, that the Jews are unable to follow the teachings of the Torah to the T, else they would not be any different than the Peacefuls if they set out to spread their faith.\n\nIsrael-India friendship is a marriage of convenience. Period. But, as people with morals, we must acknowledge their past favors and try to support them whenever we can possibly, but we should be wary of them for you never know what the future holds; we might want to accommodate them and pursue a peaceful course, but may not see the favor returned.\n\nThere's no need to fall all over ourselves to convey our support to the Jews. They're incomparably better than us, and can take care of their own shit; which means staying silent won't be that bad an idea. It's Abrahamist vs. Abrahamist at the end of the day.\n\n---\n\nवसुदेवसुतं देवं कंसचाणूरमर्दनम् | देवकीपरमानन्दं कृष्णं वंदे जगद्गुरुम् ||"<br />Author: 'ProfessorSW'<br />id: 'nf02ad'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Do we really need to dig back to 500 years to prove that Islam is violent theocracy? \nDo we really need to dig back to 200 years to prove the Whites are racist motherfuckers?\nJust look at recent past. Look at the radical Islamic terrorism. Look at the racial discrimination in the west. \nLet's live in the present.  We don't need to think back. Let's look around and understand the world for what it truly is. Our ancestors were weak and pathetic. They let their children killed, women raped, chose conversion over death. Took whips of the white man and spend their life in servitude. Not all of them, but most of them did, until someone lead them to fight oppression. Let's not forget that they were weak nonetheless. Not accepting that gives us bad attitude towards present. We can't face the present day threats against our race and religion if we keep living in the past. \nLet's follow dharma, let's not be weak and aim for india to be a Supreme global power and fight the radical Islamic filth and the white man's pseudo supremacy."<br />Author: 'maniteja7'<br />id: 'netk7o'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

The Guru is the dispeller of the darkness of ignorance. There can be no greater good than the removal of ignorance.

He secured the fort of his state and made it strong. This made the old king upset as his time seems to be over &amp; majority of people in state were not listening to him and he stands exposed\n\nThe state goes in an election every 5 years &amp; new elections were knocking on the door. The old king knew that without engineering a divide in majority, he can’t come back to power. To regain power the old king along with his key partner in-country hatched an idea to break the majority community\n\nHe sends in a Trojan Horse, his old untrained soldier into majority community. This soldier starts talking in favor of the majority community by abusing the minority community in worse language.\n\nThe majority community welcomed him with open arms and he touched the nerve center\n\nThis Trojan Horse lives in an area surrounded by a minority. While he abused the minority community openly, none in the minority community spoke against him or posed any harm to him. Even the minority supportive media who jump never miss a chance to abuse and insult the majority community stays silent. just no words from them\n\nBut one intelligent guy inside that fort from the majority community was closely watching this trojan horse. He exposed him to the majority community. Slowly the mature people start understanding the game of this trojan horse and understood that he is placed inside the majority community to break it from inside\n\nThis made the old king and his partners insecure and worried as the pack of cards had started falling. So they hatched a new plan. This time they send another one but from a minority community (The kind of supari killer available on rent). His task was not to kill the Trojan Horse but to pose as if he came to kill him and get arrested by fort guards. As planned the Guard arrested this guy with a local weapon and the news flashed inside the fort and the majority community.

He is even believed to be close to Modi. He recently filed a case to cancel Jagan's bail in corruption case. He is very vocal on YouTube. He was even granted Y security quoting threat to his life from his own party members.\n\nIn a cinematic fashion, 30 CID officers from Andhra Pradesh entered Telangana, entered MP's house , took him from the CRPF protection overnight, transported him to AP. MP was rejected bail but he accused 5 masked people entered his cell and assaulted him. He said, they kept on hitting his insoles repeatedly asking him in between to walk and hitting him again until he couldn't walk. His feet turned purple in the pics released by media. Government countered the argument that MP has Psoriasis hence his feet turned purple. Jagan's government didn't even care court's verdict of keeping MP in the hospital. He was transferred to jail. \n\nAlong with him, two tv channels were accused of the conspiracy to destabilize the government and were included in the affidavit. Now his family filed a bail petition in supreme court, fearing for his life. Imagine if a MP can be almost dragged /kidnapped from his house in broad daylight, and assaulted in the cell, what will be the state of a common man? Supreme court ordered to transfer him to army hospital for medical examination to determine the assault on him. \n\nNot much discussion in national media or here, hence posting."<br />Author: 'CoolCabinetMinister'<br />id: 'nedajj'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

We haven\'t been able to counter "Bhakt spotted" or "Andh-Bhakt" in a concise manner so far. This word gives us replies like "Virodhi spotted" or "Andh-Virodhi". Short and on point.\n3. Rooted in hindi, it will allow us to not touch sickularism, while putting our point forward. Silent RW can also use it without hesitation from their real IDs.\n4. Real world uses show that the liberandus don\'t have a proper counter/come- back for it as of now. because it...\n5. Brings out the true nature of Liberandus. Folks with half-assed knowledge who who blindly believe everything and start protesting.\n\n\\*\\*Disadvantages:\\*\\*\n\n1. Compared to Namzi, this isn\'t as polarizing.

However there are couple of disadvantages as he mentioned on the word "NAMAZI".\n\nI\'ll reiterate them shortly:\n\n1. Namazi is not the correct translation for Bhakt.

Rooted in hindi, it will allow us to not touch sickularism, while putting our point forward. Silent RW can also use it without hesitation from their real IDs.\n4. Real world uses show that the liberandus don\'t have a proper counter/come- back for it as of now. because it... \n5. Brings out the true nature of Liberandus.

<li>Title: "Hard Truth : Center's job is to protect constitution, not the people of Bharat"<br />Body: 'A lot of us right wingers are blaming Modi govt (and rightly so) for NOT protecting the killings / exodus / r@pes of bengali Hindus.   \n\n\nBut we must not forget that all the center could do is enable president\'s rule in bengal. That wouldn\'t change anything.  \n\n\nJust like mamta didi mentioned that what will you do when CRPF goes back ? who will protect you ? (openly in one of her rallies). she isn\'t wrong.  \n\n\n**99% of middle class aadarsh Hindu baalak (good boy) have been taught WRONG by our parents, teachers and NCERT books.**   \n\n\nHindus should NOT depend on center / state / UN for our safety.  \n\n\nIts the job of police / Army to follow orders. They followed orders (did nothing) in 1991 kashmir exodus and did nothing in 2021 bongol killings.   \n\n\nDharma / Rightousness is different. Just like during british times, a signboard read "dogs and Indians not allowed" was legal (but immoral), so is Indian govt just watching the killings of Hindus in cold blood.  \n\n\nA follower of Dharma would call out injustice even if he stood to benefit from it (imagine a muslim refusing to take minority scholarship  or christian americans acknowledging the role of church in slavery). Legal status is secondary, **morality** (what you think is right, treat others how you want to be treated) **is first.**  \n\n\n[https://captajitvadakayil.in/2021/01/04/sanatana-dharma-hinduism-exhumed-and-resurrected-capt-ajit-vadakayil/](https://captajitvadakayil.in/2021/01/04/sanatana-dharma-hinduism-exhumed-and-resurrected-capt-ajit-vadakayil/)  \n\n\n(its a long series on Dharma. try reading as many parts as you can and write in comment below how many parts you read out of 138)\n\n  \nSo what can Hindu Indians like us to make sure the followers of popat mohamed (PUBG) don\'t burn down our house at midnight and r@pe our women ? Rely on Indian police ? lol.  \n\n\nONE : Its the moral right of every creature to live freely. Hindus eat only plants because we need food to survive and because plants have lower frequency of conciousness compared to animals (humans have highest).   \n\n\nThis means that right to live of all Humans is paramount. Including you.   \n\n\n**Your survival is the topmost priority**. Not the headlines of NYT or following copy paste Indian constitution.  \n\n\nIts well within Dharma (righteousness) to adopt legal as well as illegal means to ensure your family\'s survival.  \n\n\nkilling someone who wants to fatally hurt you or your family is called \'Vadh\' in Sanskrit (its your dharma to protect your family).  \n\n\nTWO :  Its the moral duty of Hindus to finish the war which was thrust upon us for a thousand years. Take back every temple which is occupied (or destroyed). Correct the wrongs. Take back control of our nation (from foreign media, children of invaders, flawed Indian constitution).  \n\n\nThere is a reason why Nostradamus predicted Hindu Rashtra after WW3. There is a reason why Veer Savarkar was the most feared Patriot by the british. They knew it.  \n\n\nMecca was a 12000 year old Hindu temple taken over by mohamed by deceit. Mandir wahan bhi banana hai.  \n\n\n[https://ramanisblog.in/2016/05/06/vedic-practices-in-kaaba-islam/](https://ramanisblog.in/2016/05/06/vedic-practices-in-kaaba-islam/)  \n\n\nRigveda said not to leave these 4 things unfinished : disease, enemy, fire and debt. There was a reason why Pandavas killed every single enemy. It is written in Mahabharata that 138Cr Warriors died during that tragic war.  \n\n\nThere simply is no other way.  \n\n\n  \nNote : this post doesnt advocate violence but self defense.

<li>Title: 'Review of the book “Sanghi who never went to a Shakha”'<br />Body: 'This book is an ideological journey of the author. Author recounts contemporary political history of India with the help of his personal life journey. He analyses some seemingly interesting questions like “Why Hindutva as an ideology is no longer anathema and what brought about this change?” and “For what reason did a country that was governed for quite a long time by individuals embracing Nehruvian secularism unexpectedly started to line up with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)?”\n\nIn the first two chapters, he describes  his childhood and explains how his family brought him up as a Congressi Hindu, i.e. Congress supporters who were not very assertive about their identity as Hindus. He explains why most of the Hindus preferred the Congress party after Independence. The Congress party was able to send different messages to different communities without sounding incoherent. However, such a strategy included encouragement of anti-Hindu leftist intelligentsia in academic circles and media. So a Congressi Hindus lived a blissful life while their cultural heritage was being silently annihilated in significant spaces like media and the academicia.\n\nIn later chapters, the author being journalist also talks about the bias in the mainstream news media of India. He explains how the mainstream media shamelessly make things up for sensational headlines, resorts to outright lying to make a more dramatic story and finds no dishonour in publishing a partially and/or misreported narrative and labels it as “responsible journalism”. This shows how mainstream media is biased not just on political leanings but going so far as partially report of misreport news. \n\nMany may relate to this title of book even without even reading this book and I am one such person. It is without a doubt the journey of numerous Indians transformation into a vocal Hindu, with the activities of common Indian state, pseudo-liberal media and the colonized establishment giving the catalytic impact. I have been called a “Sanghi”, for simply voicing my support for a party that I truly believe has done some good work. At first I got offended, but eventually when I found out that left keeps labeling people to avoid debates and to claim moral superiority I have started accepting those labels as badges of honour. So if I am a “Sanghi who never went to a shakha” today it is because of liberals, it is because of their fragmented liberalism that has no room for anyone who doesn’t have exactly the same views, it is because of their cancel culture, which paints every BJP voter and Modi fan as a bigot. Though the foundation and timeline may vary, but the destination is same.'<br />Author: 'Im_impossible'<br />id: 'ndont4'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

I find it extremely hard to redpill them.

Now during this whole Israel-Palestine conflict they have gone full bonkers, like posting useless stories on SM, sharing shitty articles, standwithPalestine hashtags and all that BS.

<li>Title: 'Real World Talk Part 1 (Hindutva and Nationalism)'<br />Body: " I have not been on reddit much, but from what I have seen so far, I have the urge to present my points as well. I am probably going to hurt a lot of feelings, but I recommend you at least give it a read and we can have a healthy debate as no one is absolutely right. I also plan to continue this format as I find more topics to talk about.  \nBefore I start, I will tell people not to stop their resistances just because my arguments are logical, as you never truly know what the future will be like so never stop doing what is better for yourself and your community. Logic does not equal to being correct, this is a common pitfall RW people usually fall into when debating with LW. Leftist ideologies like Marxism, Communism, and Socialism usually make perfect logical sense but they have proven to be complete failures in practice. Another darker example would be incest, “incest is wrong because the offspring will be genetically twisted and will live a painful life, but if you use contraceptives, then there is no such problem.” Although this entire statement makes perfect logical sense, we all know it is morally wrong and probably cringed a little inside.\n\nAlso I am not some prediction engine or some sort of prophet. I may turn out to be incredibly wrong, but history has a tendency to repeat itself and humans have a tendency to be very emotional so I am pretty confident in my predictions.\n\nToday’s topic is about Hindutva and/or Hinduism, whatever you may prefer to call it, being on the verge of extinction, and that the only way to save it is via Hindu nationalism. This holds some truth, but not in the way people think right now and even then something must go horrendously wrong for Hindutva to go extinct. People see the surface and immediately assume it’s Islam that is going to be the end of Santana Dharma, this just isn’t feasible, even if, God forbid, India as a nation ends up breaking. Human psychology is the reason. I will borrow an example to explain. You know how some colonies have a single street food vendor who only sells one item, but people have to go there, because if you go to the other colony, you are a traitor; this is Islam. Whereas Hindutva is like an all you can eat buffet, where once you look at the menu you start to wonder how can the restaurant even have this many dishes. Point being, Hindutva can fit any kind of person with any kind of ideology into itself and still be cohesive with itself. While other religions need coercion or force to convert people, Hindutva is a self driving force, especially as there is an ideological vacuum forming in South East Asia. It is also the least repressive of the religions. People may talk about caste based discrimination, but they ignore the fact that it is in fact not supported by any sacred texts and even Ramayana tells the inspiring tale of not dwelling in caste and treating everyone equally. Now the caste system has been largely ignored in the modern India and is only surviving because of reservations, this isn’t just an irony bomb, it’s an entire nuke.\n\nPeople might say, what happened in Kashmir, Kerala and now in WB is proof that I am wrong. But you have to understand, this just isn’t sustainable in the long run. Either we will go through riots or worse a civil war if Muslims really start testing Hindus, and no amount of media whitewashing will stop this from coming down. The other more likely scenario is that India will see an economic boom before that period of brutal civil unrest begins and the whole of Indian Subcontinent, that being India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Burma will just get sucked into India’s mammoth political and economical orbit. The situation will most likely turn into how USA and Canada were bitter enemies but now have the biggest unguarded border between them. This won’t be the ever elusive ‘Akhand Bharat’ that some people hope for, but it will be a close second. This point is largely ignored by both the defenders of Islam and people who are angry at them. People don’t realize that most Muslim pushback against India and Hindus in the world is just information warfare from Pakistan’s side and they’ve been at it since 47, they have always painted Hindus as some sort of fascistic religion hell bent on killing Muslims. This mainly stems from the Army having control over their economy and not wanting to let go. If they have no ‘bad guy’ they can’t justify siphoning state funds for Army and also militant groups. This is why they fund separatists of India, export their ‘intellectuals’ to the developed world to gain influence. This however is also not sustainable. Indian growth would mean less and less people would want to separate. Imagine a Khalistan completely land locked, with all its rivers flowing in from India, it would be an economical suicide. And as big daddy China’s growth is halting and Pakistan has distanced itself more and more from USA, there really isn’t anyone that can bolster it against India which has all the moral and legal high-ground, as recent surveys have shown that perception of India is only becoming better in the developed world. India has seen democratic rule since independence while Pakistan is often taken over by Army. I expect Pakistan to just off itself like the collapse of the USSR in the next few decades, or reform heavily in favor of democracy. Then there will be a significant portion of Indian haters inside India suddenly left with a hard choice; accept the truth as a guest in your house, or ignore its existence and watch it burn the whole place down. There is a darker ending to this, which I may talk about at a later date.  \nHowever there is another side to this, corrupting Hindutva from inside to the point it can't be recognized anymore where even if people identify themselves as Hindu, they really aren’t. It is not the external threat, it is the rats that we ourselves let in.  \nCults like Radha Soami, these are in essence, people that have managed to convince a handful of people that they are messengers of God or something. This group claims that Ganga is not a holy river, it is just any river. There is no backlash against it as they do not allow recordings of any kind as such only brainwashed individuals have heard most of it, their preachers can just keep making up whatever they want. This cult only came into existence in the 19th century.\n\nAnother cult is Brahma Kumaris, this one is even more outrageous as it’s founder only founded this in 1936, and there are pictures of him in western style suit, far from any spiritual person. This cult claims that Ramayana is fake and Ram is fictional.\n\nIn fact this is essentially how Sai was forced into Hindu Religion. This is basically guerilla warfare on an entire religion.  \nThis argument however does disservice to people asking and working for strengthened nationalism on the back of a common ideology, in this case Hindu Nationalism. Depending on how you think, you might or might not like my take. Hindu Nationalism will slowly die down, whereas Indian nationalism will rise, again, similar to how pre civil war era USA was very divided in ideologies but later assumed a common patriotism to USA even if they disagreed on ideologies. I just hope our economic stability comes early and we do not require a civil war for the Indian nationalism to manifest.\n\nI want to end it by saying it again, no predictions are correct, people far more qualified than me have made predictions that have gone horribly wrong. All of European powers prior to World War 1 thought they would win the war in a matter of months. As such I will still encourage people to keep doing what they are doing, everyone has the right to fight for their ideology, all India needs is self sufficiency and a little bit of time to become the undisputed hegemon of this part of the continent."<br />Author: 'IISCP4999II'<br />id: 'ndmkah'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

If u meet any such person just send this to them. \n\n\n\n Eliminating officials one by one isn't a possibility at all because\n1) it will take too long. Pinpointing locations of those who are masterminds is a difficult task. Eliminating them is even more difficult as none of them will actually be in israel. All of them will be inside muslim countries \n2) movements of mossad will be very much predictable. There's no chance of any ariel or navy support while eliminating the masterminds of hamas. Mossad agents will be stuck in enemy land with no chance of reinforcement. There are very high chances that agents will be ambushed due to the predictability issues\n3) terror outfits aren't like nuclear programmes. Eliminating one of the top scientists will halt the nuclear programme buying enough time but eliminating top leaders of terror outfit won't do so because there are thousands of people in islamic nations who can fill the place of terrorist outfit leaders however only a few can fit the place of scientists\n4) the moment any of the top leaders of hamas is eliminated, hamas will increase the rate of firing of missiles on Israel in order to pressurise them. Even the iron dome isn't 100% effective. More civillians will die. Also using iron dome is very costly. A single shot fired to neutralize enemy missiles costs $40,000 and its battery that has to be replaced after regular interval of time costs $2,00,000\n5)eliminating top leaders of hamas won't put a stop to ground level violence. The only ways to stop ground level violence is by either eliminating ground level millitants,striking fear in ground level militants or by destroying theor weapons and sources of funding"<br />Author: 'chacha420op'<br />id: 'nd2qg7'<br />Flair :Indo-International 📰</li>

They were skilled archers and sharp-handed. They **would not** pierce with arrows, solitary persons, persons without defence, fleeing foes who could be tracked down through hints from sound.

<li>Title: 'The Greatest Heist in Indian History. PART 2: THE REAL STORY OF THE ISLAMIC RULE THAT WE WERE NEVER TOLD'<br />Body: 'Imagine a country called X, a country with a\xa0continuous lineage of 5000 years. And it was filthy rich. In fact it was richer than the rest of the world, at that time, put together. And everyone knew that. For the ancient non X, earth dwellers who were not cavemen, X was not a country but an entire freakin continent. And their papyrus scrolls showed it that way.\n\n[ Rest of Asia, You are not worthy to be on our precious papyrus](https://preview.redd.it/b47x1x8qi8z61.png?width=1613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2bfb040710ca959a6b7e9587add0345a98a78ad)\n\n \n\nAnyways, as what happens to a rich house in a poor locality, all the have-nots in the world, realizing how much wealth was there for the taking, converged onto X. They came in droves, time after time, \xa0to help themselves to the\xa0unlimited\xa0booty on offer. And after a while (seventeen times), someone just said ‘screw it, let’s settle down in India once and for all’. And in the process they claimed X theirs, by birth.\n\nIt was as if a huge guy walked into a house, sat on its sofa, took out a cigar, and said the house belongs to not only him, but his ancestors as well. Without even as much as looking at the original inhabitants. What would or could the poor souls do?\n\n[ This is my house now amigo...](https://preview.redd.it/5uztv77cj8z61.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70d716576eb491489a43dfd03da1062500251e46)\n\nWhatever they did, it will still be better than what our historians have done.\n\nIf you haven’t guessed it by now, Country X is India and the huge guy is an allegory for the various Islamic hordes from regions as far as Mongolia to modern day Kazakhstan. So instead of telling our children who this guy really was and what he really did, we have deified and honoured this invading band of tribes. In fact most of our medieval history is dedicated to these bunch of rear-cracks, for reasons I don’t know. And as our historians lack ’round objects below the abdomen’ to present the true picture of the Islamic rule, let me do the job for them.\n\nIndia’s first encounter with an Islamic ruler started when a douchebag named Mahmud Of Ghazni landed here in 1004 AD. You might have come across this guy in your textbook as the dude who raided the Somnath Temple, a little over 17 times. However, what our historians have neglected to mention is that this guy did not just raid the Somnath temple, he demolished it every time he came. In fact at one point of time he was so pissed off by our\xa0resilience, he massacred about 50,000 Somnath inhabitants, razed the temple to the ground again, smashed the ShivLing made from solid gold into tiny little pieces and then embedded them in the steps of the Jama Masjid back in his home town of Ghazni, so that the people could step on it while [going to pray.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_of_Ghazni#Destruction_of_Somnath_Temple)\n\nHad there been a thesaurus.com in the 1st century AD, the first entry for the words evil, horror, despicable and other similar words, would have been Mahmud Of Ghazni.\n\n[ If evil had a face, This had to be it](https://preview.redd.it/y6jbu42mj8z61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae216f081b4e7fcbb9b336adead3855f281dc0c9)\n\nAnd if\xa0obliterating\xa0one temple was not enough, he also destroyed the temples in Ujjain and Dwarka and sacked them. In fact, in all his invasions he never tried to consolidate his rule in India. All he wanted to do was loot and kill. To sum it up, He came, he saw, he destroyed, he looted, unleashed an evil laugh and went back. In Fact he was so evil and caused so much damage to our country, that our friends in Pakistan named a freakin missile after him, just to harness his India destruction potential.\n\n And that he was evil is not something that is being made up. This was what his own biographer had to say\n\n&gt;“In the interest of his successors he constructed, in order to weaken the Indian frontier, those roads on which afterwards his son Mahmud marched into India during a period of thirty years and more. God be merciful to both father and son! Mahmud utterly ruined the prosperity of the country, and performed there wonderful exploits, by which the Hindus became like atoms of dust scattered in all directions, and like a tale of old in the mouth of the people. Their scattered remains cherish, of course, the most inveterate aversion towards all Muslims. This is the reason, too, why Hindu sciences have retired far away from those parts of the country conquered by us, and have fled to places which our hand cannot yet reach, to Kashmir, Benares, and other places. And there the antagonism between them and all foreigners receives more and more nourishment both from political and religious sources.” \xa0[Source.](http://books.google.com/books?id=9-yUPk_Q5VsC&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) \n\nThe biographer was executed.\n\nThis guy, who will be right up there, in any ‘top 10 evil men of the century’ list, should have been\xa0portrayed\xa0as the evil version of \xa0the evil Gabbar Singh, a bandit and a mass murderer. Instead our historians admire his\xa0persistence and\xa0perseverance. And then, we also name a freakin movie after him.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jb1fgu18l8z61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3f59c717304c57d1695bfeae09b2c27780c0bc8\n\nIt is like an MBA book, citing the Nazi holocaust as a case study for logistics management.\xa0Perseverance, you must be kidding me.\n\nSacking and razing the great Indian temples was not the only contribution made by Mahmud of Ghazni to our history. He was the guy, who basically showed the desolate regions in central Asia that the unlimited Indian wealth was there for the taking and you just had to turn up. He was the guy who laid the foundation of Islamic rule in India for the next 700 odd years.\n\nAnd we admire his\xa0perseverance.\n\nAfter Mahmud of Ghazni, all the emperors in the central Asian wilderness were itching to go to India for its limitless wealth. But it took them a 100 years to actually gather up enough men and material to mount another invasion, simultaneously giving Indians time to replenish their treasure stocks. While we were coming back to terms with life, Mahumd Of Ghazni married 9 wives, sired 56 legitimate children and got bitten by a female anophles mosquito and died of Malaria (Never underestimate an angry mosquito). After long years of internal squabbling, Mohammad Ghori (Ghauri) finally ascended the throne of Ghazni in A.D 1178. And promptly attacked India in A.D 1191.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/gwgrtwunl8z61.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=836ab3cc74bfe67e78f35b5d349813ba28a908ca)\n\nOpposing him this time was the Rajput king, Prithviraj Chauhan, who famously [eloped with Princess Samyukta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samyukta), right under the nose of her father, Raja Jaichand of Kanauj. \xa0Mohammad Ghauri, thanks to the lessons learnt from ~~Aamir Khan~~ Mahmud of Ghazni, was so overconfident about his impending victory that he was already planning the after victory pillage party when he came face to face with ‘My profession, hobby, passion and happiness is war’ Prithviraj Chauhan, at Tarain, some 150 Kms from New Delhi.\n\nHe got his ass kicked.\n\nHe was not just defeated, he was totally routed. In fact, he got his backside kicked so badly, that he was captured by Prithviraj Chauhan whom he begged for mercy. And much to the consternation and objections of his courtiers, (who wanted to chop Ghori’s head off), Chauhan magnanimously spared Ghori’s life and let him return back to Ghazni with his head on his shoulders.\n\nBut Ghori, like all other ungrateful wretches, attacked Chauhan again in A.D 1194.\n\nUsing some\xa0skulduggery\xa0and deceit, he somehow managed to defeat Chauhan and his army and captured him alive. He promptly entered Delhi and massacred some 100,000 people combining it with some general pillage and loot thrown in. He then went back to Ghazni, where he executed the man who spared his life three years before. Chauhan was killed with the full knowledge that he had signed his own death warrant.\n\nSo according to our Historians\n\nPrithviraj Chauhan, a merciful king, who in a total departure from the general rules of warfare, spares the life of his adversary and under whose aegis, the famous sufi saint Shaikh Salim Chisti was able to establish the famous Ajmer Dargah, is not worthy enough to be mentioned.\n\nWhile, Mohammad Ghori, an ungrateful wretch, killer of a man who spared his life and 100,000 more, gets more space than [Emperor Harsha and Palas ](https://kaipullai.com/2011/09/12/the-greatest-heist-in-indian-history-how-our-history-was-changed-and-we-didnt-even-notice-part-1the-lost-eon-6th-century-b-c-to-1174-a-d/)put together. You think this is travesty, well it only gets worse from here. And yes, Pakistan named another missile after this guy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x03c41tam8z61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbc3e1d959e5a59a1b6fa4b4c844b9eeada226d6\n\nMohammad Ghori, did not have any heir, so he basically carved up his empire among his different Turkish Slaves, with Qutub-ud-Din aibak given the kingdom of India or Hindustan as it was known then. And that started the Delhi Sultanate. Here is a list of the other Delhi Sultanate Rulers\n\nQutub-Ud-Din Aibak: 1206-1210\n\nIltutmish: 1210-1236\n\nRazia Sultana: 1236-1240 (Murdered in 1240 because she refused to wear a veil, was secular, tried to appoint a Hindu to an important position and had a relationship with an Abyssinian slave. Resurrected and murdered again by Hema Malini in 1983)\n\nBalban: 1246-1290\n\n**—————————--End of the Slave Dynasty——————————-**\n\n1290-1320 Alauddin Khilji : Was probably the best of the Sultanate kings. No religious porgorms were reported, and there were no widespread massacres in the name of religion. He was also known to restore a defeated king to kingship in exchange for tribute and gold.\n\nHowever, his general, a eunuch named Malik Kafur, a Rajput who converted to Islam, marched upto Tanjore in the south for some plunder. He negotiated in such a way that he did not have to fight a single battle till he reached his destination. He/She went south as far as Tanjore, desecrating and sacking temples in Srirangam, Madurai and Chidambaram and taking their solid gold idols away, which was his intention. However, it must be said that unlike the Mahmud of Ghazni, nothing was demolished and all the looting happened without the usual accompanying massacres.\n\nIt is said that when Kafur returned to New Delhi, he/she returned with 612 Elephants, Twenty Thousand Horses, 96,000 Thousand Nams (Approximately 241 Tonnes) of Gold and the usual countless boxes of jewels and pearls.\n\nAnd an eunuch in Delhi was never insulted after that.\n\nThis was about the last time, there was a sort-of benevolent\xa0Delhi Sultan, as most of the time, the term benovelent Delhi Sultan was an oxymoron.

The rest were almost similar in nature and evilness. To know more about the others, Please read Mahmud Of Ghazni, do a Ctrl C and a Ctrl V)\n\nWith all these crackpots, (yes Mohammad Tughlugh included) the Delhi sultanate lumbered along for 300 years, with different kings coming, killing and naming different areas in today’s Delhi (Ferozshah Kotla and Tughlaghabad, after Feroz Shah Tughlagh, Lodi Gardens after Ibrahim Lodi and so on) after them and then mostly, getting killed.\n\nI can go on and on about the not-so-nice details that our historians have skipped in this era, for reasons best known to them, but won’t for reasons of brevity. Please read [this book](http://www.flipkart.com/books/0007307756?pid=5kw3ffzwme&amp;_l=CJHVEqJO3veuHytbACc9dw--&amp;_r=QSau5TU7Qg0WHZW0EK5Z_Q--&amp;ref=f8e862a4-e58a-4f37-a249-661718067d0f)\xa0or [visit this website](http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/articles/irin/genocide.html), if you want to know more about this period. \xa0However, I will point some of the really big omissions.\n\nQutub-Ud-Din Aibak is described by the Indian historians as a slave who worked up to be the king. However, he is famous because of of the eponymous ‘Qutub Minar’ in New Delhi. Our historians lavish some\xa0unnecessary\xa0praise for what is at best a tall building, shaped like a particular part of the male anatomy.\n\n[ Big Deal](https://preview.redd.it/yahq8cn3n8z61.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a59fd65e592db996cb1d476665020372dab2bac0)\n\nThis is what the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) plate at the minar says about this totally pointless tower.\n\n&gt;‘It is the perfect example of \xa0a minar known to exist anywhere in the world. The [variegated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variegation) plan of its three lower stories the projecting balconies with stalactite pendentive brackets and some more mumbo jumbo.’\xa0\n\nHowever, what our eminent historians have apparently forgotten to mention or deliberately ignored is, that[ 27 temples were utterly destroyed](http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/modern/kutub_oak.html) and the stones from those very temples were used to build this tower. \xa0And the builders were bloody proud of this fact.\xa0So proud, that Aibak and his successors had the gall to inscribe it on the eastern gate of the Qutub complex.\n\n27 temples destroyed for building this ‘thing’ and all our historians do is praise its variegated, pendentic brackets.  \n\n\n&gt;Just another thought, isn’t it ironic that most of the areas in our national capital are named after invaders, temple destroyers and who imposed taxes on poor innocents who just happened to be non-Muslims? I doubt any other nation on this planet honours their destroyers in this manner. (America even changed it’s metric system to wash itself off the British influence). Most importantly, nothing is named after the ones who actually did a lot of good for our country.\n\nThe Delhi Sultanate, with the exception of Razia Sultana, Balban and Alauddin Khilji, \xa0actually was nothing more than a bunch religious fanatics, who rose to power almost miraculously and then somehow sustained it. However, whatever they did pales in comparison to who followed them, The Mughals.\n\nThe name Mughal itself is quite an accident. Genghis Khan, in his many conquests across the length of world, had some fun when he was doing his stuff in Central Asia. The result was a awkward hybrid between Mongol and Persian, which resulted in the name Moghul, which became Mughal. Genghis Khan, gave these guys the right to rule as long as they recognized the superiority of the Khan. All was well, until Genghis Khan died.\n\nKingdoms those days, especially the central asian ones, were not entirely unlike a bunch of kids in the first standard. Totally quiet till you have a teacher in a class, only to explode the moment teacher leaves. The only difference was, these guys had swords, spears and cannons to settle their disputes.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/954q5mgvn8z61.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2936f63735ee8bf1e9b526323c26a07a169ce74)\n\nSo amid all the bloodshed and anarchy, there rose a warrior who united them all. And he was lame and he looked like the illegitimate child of the ugliest ogre.\n\n[ This was apparently his best pic](https://preview.redd.it/t4hit5d6o8z61.png?width=590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78b264fcdd56680acf9d26352b2ad122a18b8998)\n\nSo lame guy, kills everyone else, captures the capital city of Samarkand and declares himself king. And then attacks, you guessed it right, India.\n\nAttacking and plundering India was like a high point in a Mongol’s life, something you had to do to prove to rest of the world that you were a man. Mongols, before Timur, \xa0repeatedly attacked India, and once almost defeated the then emperor Alauddin Khilji. Which was when Khilji decided that shit had really hit the fan. So the next time Mongols came, he sent the now legendary Malik Kafur after them, who annihilated them in open battle. And just to drive home the message, Khilji had all the prisoners (some 10,000 dudes) trampled by elephants, their heads cut off and displayed as scarecrows outside his fort in Siri.\n\nThe Mongols did not come back.\n\nTill Timur the Lame.\n\nWhen Timur the lame, attacked India in A.D 1398, the Delhi Sultanate was in a total state of anarchy. So he basically had a free pass. Brushing aside whatever little resistance he faced, he got busy doing what was considered his dynasty’s expertise.\n\n[ There are a 100,000 people in this stadium](https://preview.redd.it/h067j9v3p8z61.png?width=3000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=515485c316fba7f0f20b958cb77c0a3e88413228)\n\nJust imagine, every single human in this crowd, speared through the chest, decapacitated and their heads stacked up in a Jenga like formation outside a city. Which was exactly what Timur the lame did.\n\nTo discourage resistance or mebbe he just got a kick out of it, Timur killed 100,000 ‘non Musulmáns’, cut their heads off and built a[ skull-wall outside Delhi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur#Indian_campaign). When the terrified Dilliwallahs capitulated, he walked in and killed the rest to the last man, woman and child, excepting the quarter which had ‘saiyids, the ‘ulamá, and other Musulmán’ and went back with another trove of cash, gold and jewels. He also apparently sent out an order that, every soldier in his looting column had to return with at least two severed human heads to show him.\n\nAnd, how did Timur justify these dastardly acts of violence: ‘Muslim Delhi Sultanate was too tolerant toward its\xa0Hindu\xa0subjects’. Yes, too tolerant.\n\n[ Built entirely using Indian money](https://preview.redd.it/833e6uw3q8z61.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=520a31d16b7b5264708978643f57a97bca470268)\n\nAnd the first emperor of the much celebrated by our historians, Mughal Dynasty, Emperor Ẓahīr ad-Dīn Muḥammad Babar was the great great grandson of this murdering wretch. Yes, a direct\xa0descendant.\n\nSo now you know why the ancestry of the great Mughal empire has been\xa0conveniently\xa0hidden from us for so long. You don’t want to tell the people that the empire we celebrate the most, and dedicate the maximum space in out history books to, is directly responsible for the most destructive religious and ethnic cleansing ever in Indian history. And as portrayed in our textbooks, Babar did not land in India because he was a great visionary or an emperor. He came here simply because he had nowhere else to go.\n\nHe tried to capture Samarkand, in modern day Uzbekistan where he got his ass kicked by the Uzbek king Shaibani Khan. Reduced to a wandering nomad but with the support from the then Persian king, he landed at the gates of India, where to his luck the Lodi’s were in strife. And before you know it, he was the ruler of India. And he had the temerity to claim the throne of India, ‘as his right’.\n\n*Processing img ec6w4b2kq8z61...*\n\nBabur set about expanding his kingdom, defeating the Rajputs, capturing the fort of Chittor and also is credited with the world’s first execution by firing squad, when he ordered his musketmen to kill the 100000 prisoners of war. His rule was in no way better than the others, as Indian historians potray. He defaced Jain temples in Rajashtan, simply because he could not stand them. And of course he demolished the most famous temple of all, the [temple at Ayodhya](http://web.archive.org/web/20050323101829/http://www.the-week.com/23sep07/events1.htm)\xa0to build the \xa0eponymous mosque, the Babri Masjid. So Babar is directly responsible for the communal tension in our country today. And our historians, lead by the esteemed Ms Romila Thapar continue to deny this, in face of clear evidence, and as a result we are kept completely in the dark.\n\n&gt;On a related note, it is deeply distressing that the most comprehensive work detailing the wanton destruction of temples and massacres perpetrated by the sultanate and their successors comes from a Belgian Historian, [Koenraad Elst.](http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/index.html)\xa0Yes a Belgian\n\nThe next part \xa0will delve further into the excesses and the occassional benovelence of the Mughals.\n\nPersonally, I want these not-so-good things to be expunged from our History for obvious reasons. But when I read successive chapters in Indian history textbooks dedicated to the glorification of these very emperors, I felt I had to bring out the real story. I apologize if I hurt some sentiments, It is not my intention. But I ask\n\n1. Why glorify the Mughal rule, when it was their ancestor who was the architect of one of the most destructive religious pogroms?\n2. If you are mentioning Ghazni’s 17 incursions and describe him as persistent, why not tell what he actually did those 17 times?\n3. When you credit the Delhi Sultanate for bringing stability to India, why hide their less glorious stuff like forced conversions, wanton looting and *‘jiziya’*?\n4. Most importantly, Why do you think our countrymen cannot handle the truth?\n\nRest in the next post.'<br />Author: 'SHIVANSH_RTX'<br />id: 'nctncf'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>

<li>Title: 'Really long paragraph written by a scholar explaining what truly the west have done to supress true Indology, quite a long read but worth it. (None of these are by me)'<br />Body: '"(ps- This post is only an ideological debate and nothing personal).     \nNamaste Bhagini\nThanks for expressing your view points frankly. You have honestly represented what is being taught at the modern schools and college courses and popular discourses. However, here are some pertinent points to be considered- \nLet us understand that discrediting the ageold religious heritage for its unparallelled nourishment and promotion of various knowledge systems including the sciences, architecture and fine arts at all times, is like discrediting our parents or foster parents for our very existence. But we are misled to do so. \nThere are lots of literary, monumental, numismatic evidences and numerous living traditions which speak loud facts and explain the symbolisms and concepts behind our structures. But they have no representation at all in Indian education. They are either kept concealed or trivialized as primitive and irrelevant or else shown as ‘nothing to do with’ our religion or culture. It is not surprising therefore that we are made to believe that architectural structures have ‘nothing to do with our culture’, while actually our architectural structures are the very personifications of our rich religio-cultural symbolisms! No single treatise shastra begins without acknowledging the deity, rishi and parampara that first conceived it. Every shastra or knowledge tradition of India has survived for ages, because they were nourished, patronized and preserved by the great temples, monasteries and Kingships with utmost love and care and even through sacrifices.  \nThe architecture courses offered today in India are completely borrowed from the western modules. It is too well known how the western racist scholarship, out of contempt, has always dismissed everything good and worthwhile about non Abrahamic native cultures. Not surprising that only ills like dowry, caste and discrimination, shaiva-vaishnava conflicts are cherry picked from Indian society to be ‘taught’ in our syllabi and never any worthwhile data about the glorious scientific architectural knowledge systems! \nLet us understand that the infights of our kings and kingdoms were more about political power monging and not about temple destructions and genocide. But the textbooks effectively whitewash the Abrahamic onslaughts as just like ‘any other’ Indian infights, cleverly concealing the fact that while shaivas-vaishnava conflicts were mostly ideological differences and community clashes and not ghastly wars and bloodshed. But the misleading narratives cleverly equate these to the Islamic and Christian genocides in India that claimed millions of lives, destroyed thousands of temples, lakhs of gurukulas, devastated countless prosperous trades, occupations and local markets, uprooted well established societal models, looted, raped, enslaved, killed, converted and impoverished in unimaginable measures, that too for centuries at a stretch! Comparing a wound to a cancerous tumour is what is done so convincingly in our ‘textbooks’! \nIn the colonial age western ‘scholarship’ dismissed off every Indian (hindu, buddhist, jaina or tribal etc) cultural, academic, religious, economic feature as ‘primitive and outdated’ without caring to explain why. They wrote loads of ‘opinions’ calling them ‘objective analysis’ and filled them in the libraries across the world. But when the stunningly marvelous architectural monuments, made some native thinkers question these narratives, counter narratives were quickly weaved to explain how Hindu ethos had ‘nothing to do with’ its world class contributions like yoga, architecture, Ayurveda, arthashastra, art, literature, etc.,! But the same narratives nevertheless keep silent when churchist claim the credit for economic progress in the west, while in reality they were the biggest blocks in the path of renaissance! \nUnfortunately our university Engineering, technical, management courses teach only about western books on architecture and not a line from our great treatises on building, sculpture, sciences arthashastra etc,. how much so ever relevant and substantial! If only we glance through our treatises and living traditions, the first thing they will notice is the beautiful connection between religion-cultural heritage and these sciences &amp; arts. Unlike in the west, where religion has been against sciences, in the Indian ethos, sciences and arts and every aspect of life has revolved around dharma. Everything here, material or spiritual, sceintifc or artistic, is indeed a form of contemplation of satya(truth) and sundara(divine beauty). But this original perspective is hardly comprehended by the newer generations because of the very big disconnect between the modern main stream academia and Indian knowledge traditions. Any defense for native explanations is instantly snubbed as irrational and communal, because ‘rationality is the birth right of the west only’!\nSwami Vivekananda warned long ago to ‘first Indianize the Indian education’. But unfortunately our education only got more and more enslaved in western narratives, post independence. We are made to feel secular and objective by simply endorsing the west.

<li>Title: 'Ultra Conservative Educated / Qualified Islamists or those Islamists who are the absolute best in their respective fields are the most disciplined folks I have ever seen.'<br />Body: "I mean...a lot of them ( Muslims ) has been really nice towards me,and as long as we don't discuss about religion ( which we rarely do ) they were cool. I realised that they ( the moderates ) turn into somethin despicable the moment you criticize their religion and the oly kitab ,for instance after I said that quran endorses killing of kaffirs straight to their face, one of them started shuddering and shivering and his face became red and shit..\n\nBut the ultra conservative faction ,not the uneducated economically disadvantaged folks ( who often commit atrocities ) but the educated and qualified or the sucessfull ( in different fields of their respective interests like cricket, boxing ,mma etc) yet ultra conservative folks , most of them are like...the epitome of discipline and mutual respect,and are respectful towards women particularly... \n\nRecently I was watching an interview of Moen Ali, the interviewer was a women and he didn't even make eye contact with that women, he maintained distance and spoke very respectfully.  This isn't something that I have observed in the behaviour of other sportspersons coming from non islamic religious background. Another total badass yet admirable character is of the UFC goat - Khabib Nurmagomedov's . Hasn't lost any matches , his wins against loss is ( 29-0) and have seen many of his fans repeatedly asserting that it's the islamic culture and the kind of traditions which influenzed him to be one among the may reasons for why he hasn't yet lost.\n\n Another coincidence is ,all of the goats of boxing and mma ( Khabib , Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson ) are muslims ( Tyson converted when he was in jail )...but then again during podcasts I have seen them sayin that this religion influenzed their attitude , and their approach towards opponents , and made them more disciplined. I have only seen one ultra conservative muslim in my entire life , he was born and brought up in Saudi , hasn't seen the guy hurt slightly or even cuss others , doesn't watch any movies and is puritanical. \n\nI am pretty convinced that ultra conservative Islamists as opposed to the western  (people who believe in this concept ie enjoyment translates to- drugs, alcohol, sex)  are far better in terms of decency and discipline. \n\nI am not an Islamist or an jihadi sympathiser.

<li>Title: 'When will we take responsibility?'<br />Body: 'I am tired of hearing the Sanatanis saying that Santana Dharma is in danger. Well if it is in danger, who is stopping you from travelling the whole world and preaching the message of love and devotion towards the Supreme? Who is stopping you from preaching the path of Yoga, the principles of Dharma, and the philosophy of Upanishads to the ignorant? Somebody preached that is why you are a Hindu. It could be your parents, your teacher or anybody. On one hand, you would neither follow your Dharma nor will you preach and revert the masses to Sanatana Dharma, and on the other hand, you would keep crying about why the percentage of Sanatanis is decreasing. Imagine being a doctor who has medicine that can cure your diseases and make you free. Would it be wise to keep it to yourself? Wouldn\'t you share it with others? Similarly, if you truly are a Sanatani belonging to the most ancient religion of the world, you would never feel ashamed in spreading its eternal message to the masses. Hardly any Sanatani strives to spread his Dharma to other lands. Instead, he forgets his Dharma in the name of assimilation and integration with western cults. There is no urgency, there is no passion to save the others from the cycle of birth and death.\n\nThere was a pastor who tried to convert me. He told me that Jesus died for my sins and I should accept him as my Lord and Saviour.\n\nI gave some simple logical arguments and he had no answer for it.\n\n&gt;"How can I convert to a religion that says my beloved mother, who kept me 9 months in her womb, nourished me, loved me is going to hell just because she is a Hindu. How can I accept a guy whose bible says that my late father is in hell for the crime of not accepting this so-called "merciful" saviour? Talking about my sins, why didn\'t he die for the sins of Aristotle? Why didn\'t he die for the sins of Julius Caesar? Oh wait, he didn\'t even exist. Why didn\'t he die for the sins of billions of people who took birth and died before his arrival? Mankind is not 2000 or 7000 years old. And talking about Jesus\' suffering, well the soldiers of my country have suffered more to protect me than your Jesus could ever do in his 100 lifetimes. And please don\'t tell me the story of Adam and Eve. Suppose they had 10000 children. Now, are those biological brothers and sisters going to mate with each other to produce more? Do you want to tell me that we are the products of incest? How can you call your God of Abraham kind and merciful when he has no problem sending innocent people to hell, not for a day or year, but eternity?"\n\nSee, this is how you engage in a debate. This is how you argue. The fundamental philosophies of Abrahamic religions are full of loopholes and contradictions. **If the Sanatanis had not been so lazy, Sanatana Dharma would have been prospering in so many countries.** **Apart from ISKCON, I hardly see any enthusiasm in other organizations in preaching the truth and reverting people to Sanatana Dharma**. Don\'t call human Gurus and Babas as God. You would simply make a fool of yourself. Worship the one Supreme God. As a Vaishnav, I worship no one but the Supreme Lord Shri Krishna. Try to assimilate and bring all the philosophies together and present Sanatana Dharma as a unified Religion to the people. Read Bhagavad-Gita, analyze the texts of important Upanishads in your free time, and always do a comparative study of Dharma with Abrahamic cults to save people from nescience and guide them towards the Truth. Chant every day, live a disciplined life. By looking at your devotion, they would also one day express their interest in Dharma.\n\nHare Krishna!'<br />Author: 'vacationinParadis'<br />id: 'nc148c'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm 🕉️</li>

For eg. if there is a Hindu Dharmik Discussion group for an Apartment with the name XYZ the name of the group could be "Dharm Charcha- XYZ". A Hindu person could belong to atleast 2 groups like a group for where he/she lives and a Hindu Dharmik discussion group among st relatives,etc\n\nPlease suggest your views!'<br />Author: 'NirbharIndian'<br />id: 'nc0vig'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm 🕉️</li>

<li>Title: 'We are on our own....the sooner we realize it, the better'<br />Body: "I have been listening, reading, reflecting a lot over the past few months.....like most of us (except the librandu randians on this sub), I was very happy when Modi won and then got re-elected......I did not expect him to be biased towards Hindus but did want him to make sure we were treated as equals and the community was given back it's pride and honour....over the past 12 months, I have changed my mind.\n\nThis is NOT a Hindu/Hindu Friendly/Hindu supportive sarkaar. This is a sarkaar which of only uses Hindu votes to retain power by making false and misleading promises.\n\nInitially when they came to power, I was hoping they would take action against the corrupt leaders (remember that India voted against the massive scams in 2014)..... NOTHING happened to anyone who did the scams....nothing....lots of cases were filed but if you look at actual progress, nothing.\n\n When the opposition claims that the Govt uses CBI, ED etc for political purposes, you have to accept there is merit. After all, we see a lot of action just ahead of elections and then nothing happens. What happened to the DLF scam, or Sardha Scam, or 2G scam, or Coal scam......all progress has been done by the courts.....the govt does not care....and worse still, they use these agencies to make politicians from other parties join the BJP and lo behold, the same people who bled the country dry, become clean and pure.\n\nLet's take another example. Delhi. We know AK is an imbecile who has blood on his hands. What prevents the Govt from saying Delhi will become a UT because you cannot have a megalomaniac incharge of the capital. How drama on Delhi Police during Farmer Protests was shocking but BJP still did nothing. For a simple reason. They don't want better governance in Delhi, they want a BJP CM in Delhi. This is not a party which is thinking about national interests. This is a party focussed on winning seats.\n\nAsk yourself, why are our temples still controlled by the Govt. Why have MORE temples come under Govt control? Why does the Govt not leave the temples alone. And the reason is simple. Santa Gobi needs the funds from the temples to fund his grand schemes and he does not have the courage to go after the institutions of other faiths. Hindus are easy game. He takes funds from our temples and uses them to fund minority welfare schemes and does not have the courage to use funds from the other religious organisations to fund their community causes.\n\nNo action on corruption.\nNo action on the Parivaar.\nThey keep inducting tainted leaders from other parties into BJP but somehow expect us to believe that these crooks will be more honest.\n\nThey have no hesitation in tying up with anti India parties like PDP, NCP, SS in pursuit of power. They have very cute explanations like we are being strategic and we are playing 4D chess but it is simple a naked play for power. Even today, if NCP decides to tie up with BJP, BJP will happily do that. Or is SS decides, they will be fine. This lot pretends to be moral bit at the end of the day, they are the same as all others.\n\nLook at the crisis with China. First Gobi believed that Xi would love him because he called him over for 02 summits. Then their idiocy led to 20 brave Indian men being killed in cold blood. And now we have given up the heights we controlled even though China refuses to pull back. Markmy words, Modi will not do anything to push China back because under pressure, he looks for face savers and not resolute action. In another 2-3 years, the chinese occupation of our lands will become the defacto border and these same cowards will explain how this is a masterstroke to buy peace with the Chinese....I hope I am wrong but I don't think I will be.\n\nCase in point CAA protects, Delhi Riots, 26 Jan riots, Farmers Protests and now Corona.....complete mis-governance...... repeatedly....and what is the point of blaming the opposition......either you have the courage to push change through or you shut your trap and sit quiet.....they have made a habit of becoming half pregnant and then not knowing what to do.....and when they lose their nerve, then the start blaming everyone.....the opposition, the courts, the media.....who said change was easy....either you have the courage to do it and follow through or you shut up and stop pretending......\n\nFinal point, people have lost their loved ones in 2nd wave. People will not forget. BJP thinks they will. I don't think so. BJP will be blamed and yes a lot of it is politics but a lot of it is also fair blame. You can't run a presidential system and then pretend you want parliamentary democracy. They want to run the country in the name of Modi then be prepared for the blame as well. \n\nAnd I can assure you that NOT A SINGLE babu or neta will be held accountable for the Covid lapses. Wait and watch. There will be lots and lots of noise but very little accountability. \n\nThat has been the case since Modi came to power. He is so enamoured with the babudom that he will not hold anyone accountable. He will say all the right things but judge him by his actions and you will see that he is more nehruvian than you would like to admit.\n\nI see a lot of people here talk about how this sarkaar is the last resort for Hindus. I say BS. Our dharma has survived Mongols and Britishers. Even an Italian queen. \n\nWe can survive. The real issue is the false sense of security that we have allowed ourselves to have. We think this is our govt. That is BS. By all yardsticks, this govt does not care about Hindu samaj. They have no interest in the community beyond making it a captive votebank and scaring us to keep us compliant. Our biggest mistake is that we think sarkaar will change things for us. Only we can change things for ourselves. \n\nNo sarkaar will change things for us. So let's wake up and stop being treated like a captive votebank by a bunch of arrogant and egotistical leaders who pretend to care about us and our causes but do everything to belittle our agenda.\n\nMany on this sub will not like what I have written.\nI am sure many more will downvote me.\nSome will call me Randian and Librandu.\n\nI don't mind it. Because if I can help even one patriot see the scam that is happening in the name of our dharma, then it is worth it. This lot does not deserve to represent us. It may be the least worst option but we deserve better. And if that means we have to get rid of this lot and suffer a few more terms of UPA etc, so be it\n\n At least that will remind RSS and BJP that they are because of us and not the other way around.

<li>Title: "This is extremely long but I request you to remove 15 minutes and read it. It's regarding the Nehru/Gandhi Family. Things you and I weren't aware. Please share this."<br />Body: 'What are some of the best kept secrets about the Nehru/Gandhi family?\n\nIndira Gandhi: Intellectual Indira was admitted in Oxford University but driven out from there for non-performance. She was then admitted to Shantiniketan University but, Guru Dev Rabindranath Tagore chased her out for bad conduct. After driven out of Shantiniketan, Indira became lonely as father was busy with politics and mother was dieing of tuberculosis in Switzerland. Playing with her loneliness, Feroze Khan, son of a grocer named Nawab Khan who supplied wines etc to Motilal Nehru’s household in Allahabad, was able to draw close to her. The then Governor of Maharashtra, Dr. Shriprakash warned Nehru, that Indira was having an illicit relation with Feroze Khan. Feroze Khan was then in England and he was quite sympathetic to Indira. Soon enough she changed her religion, became a Muslim woman and married Feroze Khan in a London mosque. Indira Priyadarshini Nehru changed her name to Maimuna Begum. Her mother Kamala Nehru was totally against that marriage. Nehru was not happy as conversion to Muslim will jeopardize her prospect of becoming Prime Minister. \n\nSo, Nehru asked the young man Feroze Khan to change his surname from Khan to Gandhi. It had nothing to do with change of religion from Islam to Hinduism. It was just a case of a change of name by an affidavit. \n\nAnd so Feroze Khan became Feroze Gandhi, though it is an inconsistent name like Bismillah Sarma. Both changed their names to fool the public of India. When they returned to India, a mock vedic marriage was instituted for public consumption. Thus, Indira and her descendants got the fancy name Gandhi. Both Nehru and Gandhi are fancy names. As a chameleon changes its colour, this dynasty have been changing its name to hide its real identity. \n\nIndira Gandhi had two sons namely Rajiv Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi. Sanjay was originally named as Sanjiv that rhymed with Rajiv, his elder brother’s name. Sanjiv was arrested by the British police for a car theft in the UK and his passport was seized. On Indira Gandhi’s direction, the then Indian Ambassador to UK, Krishna Menon misusing his power, changed his name to Sanjay and procured a new passport. Thus Sanjiv Gandhi came to be known as Sanjay Gandhi.\n\nIt is a known fact that after Rajiv’s birth, Indira Gandhi and Feroze Gandhi lived separately, but they were not divorced.\n\nThe book “The Nehru Dynasty” (ISBN 10:8186092005) by K. N. Rao states that the second son of Indira (or Mrs. Feroze Khan) known as Sanjay Gandhi was not the son of Feroze Gandhi. He was the son of another Muslim gentleman named Mohammad Yunus.\n\nInterestingly Sanjay Gandhi’s marriage with the Sikh girl Menaka took place in Mohammad Yunus’ house in New Delhi. Apparently Yunus was unhappy with the marriage as he wanted to get him married with a Muslim girl of his choice. It was Mohammad Yunus who cried the most when Sanjay Gandhi died in plane crash. In Yunus’ book, “Persons, Passions &amp; Politics” (ISBN-10: 0706910176) one can discover that baby Sanjay was circumcised following Islamic custom.\n \nIt is a fact that Sanjay Gandhi used to constantly blackmail his mother Indira Gandhi, with the secret of who his real father is. Sanjay exercised a deep emotional control over his mother, which he often misused. Indira Gandhi chose to ignore his misdeeds and he was indirectly controlling the Government. When the news of Sanjay Gandhi’s death reached Indira Gandhi, her first question was “Where are his keys and his wrist watch?”. Some deep secrets about the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty seems to be hidden in those objects.The plane accident was also mysterious. It was a new plane that nosedive to a crash and yet the plane did not explode upon impact. It happens when there is no fuel. But the flight register shows that the fuel tank was made full before take-off. Indira Gandhi using undue influence of PM’s office prohibited any inquiry from taking place. So, who is the suspect?\n\nThe book “The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi” (ISBN: 9780007259304) by Katherine Frank sheds light on some of Indira Gandhi’s other love affairs. It is written that Indira’s first love was with her German teacher at Shantiniketan. Later she had affair with M. O. Mathai (father’s secretary), then Dhirendra Brahmachari (her yoga teacher) and at last with Dinesh Singh (Foreign Minister).\n\nFormer Foreign Minister K Natwar Singh made an interesting revelation about Indira Gandhi’s affinity to the Mughals in his book “Profile and Letters” (ISBN: 8129102358). It states that- In 1968 Indira Gandhi as the Prime Minister of India went on an official visit to Afghanistan. Natwar Sing accompanied her as an IFS officer in duty. After having completed the day’s long engagements, Indira Gandhi wanted to go out for a ride in the evening. After going a long distance in the car, Indira Gandhi wanted to visit Babur’s burial place, though this was not included in the itinerary. The Afghan security officials tried to dissuade her, but she was adamant. In the end she went to that burial place. It was a deserted place. She went before Babur’s grave, stood there for a few minutes with head bent down in reverence. Natwar Singh stood behind her. When Indira had finished her prayers, she turned back and told Singh “Today we have had our brush with history.” Worth to mention that Babur was the founder of Mughal rule in India, from which the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty have descended.\n\nIt is difficult to count how many institutes of higher education are named after Rajiv Gandhi but, Rajiv Gandhi himself was a person of low calibre. From 1962 to 1965, he was enrolled for a Mechanical Engineering course at Trinity College, Cambridge. But, he left Cambridge without a degree because, he could not pass exams. Next year in 1966, he joined Imperial College, London but, again left it without a degree.\n\nK. N. Rao in the above said book alleges that Rajiv Gandhi became a Catholic to marry Sania Maino. Rajiv became Roberto. His son’s name is Raul and daughter’ name is Bianca. Quite cleverly the same names are presented to the people of India as Rahul and Priyanka.\n\nIn personal conduct Rajiv was very much a Mughal. On 15th August 1988 he thundered from the ramparts of the Red Fort: “Our endeavor should be to take the country to heights to which it belonged about 250-300 years ago. It was then the reign of Aurangzeb, the ‘jeziya’ master and number one temple destroyer.” The press conference that Rajiv Gandhi gave in London after taking over as prime minister of India was very informative. In this press conference, Rajiv boasted that he is not a Hindu but a Parsi. Feroze Khan’s father and Rajiv Gandhi’s paternal grandfather was a Muslim gentleman from the Junagadh area of Gujarat. This Muslim grocer by the name of Nawab Khan had married a Parsi woman after converting her to Islam. This is the source where from the myth of Rajiv being a Parsi was derived. Mind that he had no Parsi ancestor at all. His paternal grandmother had turned Muslim after having abandoned the Parsi religion to marry Nawab Khan. Surprisingly, Parsi Rajiv Gandhi was cremated as per Vedic rites in full view of Indian public. \n\nDr. Subramanian Swamy writes that Sonia Gandhi’s name was Antonia Maino. Her father was a mason. He was an activist of the notorious fascist regime of Italy and he served five years imprisonment in Russia. Sonia Gandhi have not studied beyond high school. She learnt some English from a English teaching shop named Lennox School at the Cambridge University campus. From this fact she boasts of having studied at the prestigious Cambridge University. After learning some English, she was a waitress at a restaurant in Cambridge town.\n\nSonia Gandhi had intense friendship with Madhavrao Scindia in the UK, which continued even after her marriage. One night at 2 AM in 1982, Madhavrao Scindia and Sonia Gandhi were caught alone together when their car met an accident near IIT Delhi main gate.\n\nWhen Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi were Prime Ministers, PM’s security used to go to New Delhi and Chennai international airports to send crates of Indian treasures like temple sculptures, antiques, paintings etc to Rome. Arjun Singh as CM and later as Union Minister in charge of Culture used to organize the plunder. Unchecked by customs, they were transported to Italy to be sold in two shops named Etnica &amp; Ganpati, owned by Sonia Gandhi’s sister Alessandra Maino Vinci.\n\nIndira Gandhi died not because her heart or brain were pierced by bullets, but she died of loss of blood. After Indira Gandhi was fired upon, Sonia Gandhi strangely insisted that bleeding Indira Gandhi should be taken to Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, in opposite direction to AIIMS which had a contingency protocol to precisely deal with such events. After reaching Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Sonia Gandhi changed her mind and demand that Indira Gandhi should be taken to AIIMS, thus wasting 24 valuable minutes. It is doubtful whether it was immaturity of Sonia Gandhi or a trick to speedily bring her husband to power.\n\nRajesh Pilot and Madhav Rao Scindia were strong contenders to the Prime Minister’s post and they were road blocks in Sonia Gandhi’s way to power. Both of them died in mysterious accidents.\n\nThere are circumstantial evidences pointing to the prima facie possibility that the Maino family have contracted LTTE to kill Rajiv Gandhi. Nowadays, Sonia Gandhi is quite unabashed in having political alliance with those like MDMK, PMK and DMK who praise Rajiv Gandhi’s killers. No Indian widow would ever do that. Such circumstances are many, and raise a doubt. An investigation into Sonia’s involvement in Rajiv’s assassination is necessary.\n\nYou may read Dr. Subramanian Swamy’s book “Assassination Of Rajiv Gandhi — Unasked Questions and Unanswered Queries” (ISBN : 81-220-0591-8). It contains indications of such conspiracy. In 1992, Sonia Gandhi revived her citizenship of Italy under Article 17 of the Italian Citizenship Law. Under Italian law, Rahul and Priyanka are Italian citizens because Sonia was an Italian citizen when she gave birth to them. Rahul Gandhi’s Italian is better than his Hindi. Rahul Gandhi is an Italian citizen is relevant from the fact that on 27th September 2001 he was detained by the FBI at Boston airport, USA for traveling on an Italian passport. If a law is made in India that important posts like that of President and Prime Minister should not be held by a person of foreign origin, then Rahul Gandhi automatically disqualifies to contend for the post of Prime Minister.\n\nAfter finishing school education, Rahul Gandhi got admission at the St. Stephens College in New Delhi, not on merit basis but on sports quota of rifle shooting. After a brief stay there in 1989-90, he did his BA from Rollins College, Florida in 1994. Just for doing BA one need not go to the US. The very next year, in 1995 he got M.Phil. degree from Trinity College, Cambridge. The genuineness of this degree is questioned as he has done M.Phil. without doing MA. Amaratya Sen’s helping hand is thought to be behind. \n\nIn 2008 Rahul Gandhi was prevented from using an auditorium of the Chandra Shekhar Azad University in Kanpur for a students’ rally. Subsequently, the Vice-Chancellor of the university, V.K. Suri, was ousted by the UP Governor. During 26/11 when the whole country was tense about how to tackle the Mumbai terror, Rahul Gandhi was lavishly partying with his friends till 5 AM. Rahul Gandhi advises austerity for all Congress members. He says it is the duty of all politicians to be austere.\n\nOn the other hand he has a ministerial bungalow with a fully equipped gym. He is a regular member of at least two of the Delhi’s poshest gyms, one of which is 5-star rated. Rahul Gandhi’s trip to Chennai in 2009 to campaign for austerity cost the party more than Rs 1 Crore. Such inconsistencies show that initiatives taken by Rahul Gandhi are not his own but, workout of his party men only.\n\nDuring the 2007 election campaign in Uttar Pradesh, Rahul Gandhi said that “if anyone from the Nehru-Gandhi family had been active in politics then, the Babri Masjid would not have fallen”. It doubtlessly shows his Mohammedan affiliation as a loyalty to his ancestors.\n\nOn Dec 31, 2004, John M. Itty, a retired college professor in Alappuzha district of Kerala, contended that action should be taken against Rahul Gandhi and his girlfriend Juvenitta alias Veronica for staying together for three days at a resort in Kerela. It is a criminal offense under Immoral Trafficking Act as they are not married. Anyway, one more foreigner daughter-in-law is waiting to rule the tolerant Indians.'<br />Author: 'Paarth_r'<br />id: 'nbkbuz'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
