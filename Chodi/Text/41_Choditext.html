Lets call him Syed. My friend were already Viraat, but Syed was very leftist. He supported the Azaadi gang, thought Modi was a Nazi, supported communism and thought Muslims were being oppressed in India. When we go to know about this, my friend and I started showing him the real picture. We told about how the Azadi Gang was fucking Kashmir over, how Muslims have a far better life in India then in most countries, how Modi was the best ( 2nd best in mu opinion after Atal Behari Vaajpayee) we have had.\n\nHe became Viraat very quickly. He became an atheist and started supporting Modi and capitalism. In 9th standard he refused to say Bharat Mata Ki Jai. He is giving the NDA exam with me this year now. \n\nStay Viraat bhraatas\n\nJAI HIND!'<br />Author: 'shredded101'<br />id: 'fwz0b7'<br />Flair :MyBhagwaPillStory</li>

<li>Title: '(Help) After posting virat memes my YouTube Channel views decreased.'<br />Body: "Hello Bhratas &amp; Bhaginis.\n\nI run a YouTube channel where I review books in Hindi &amp; Marathi. My circle is filled with liberals and centrists. I started my channel in January and I used to get 150-200 views on my videos. Also the the sub count kept increasing like 5 new subs per video. Now it is 187.\n\nDuring CAA kaand I used to post virat memes and critical stuff on my WhatsApp status. Since then my sub count has reduced drastically. Many liberal friends stopped talking with me and the views I get now per video are around 50-60. My recent video only got 29. I don't know if my  content quality is not upto the mark or my critical views on Islam hurt my circle. I lost three subs recently and I'm sure that's because of my centrist stand. I never brought politics in my videos.\n\nI really feel sad that people judge me not on my content quality but on what are my political opinions are. Like really. \n\nI'd like to know some tips to gain subs and increase view counts from new audience."<br />Author: 'AmitBhalerao'<br />id: 'fwqpm5'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li>
<li>Title: 'The definition of, distinction between, and psychology behind VIRAT and RANDIAN (Part One)―two terms which are embedded in the very cultural fabric/jargon of Indiaverse (especially RW) subs.'<br />Body: 'Virat and Randian are two terms which are so frequently used by people on this sub that many oldfags take it given that everybody knows their meanings; when apparently, the ever increasing newfags don\'t. Forget newfags, even some oldfags  tend to use "Virat" for anybody; from bollywood actresses holding a copy of *bhāgavad gitā* to some random westerner wearing ॐ kurtas.\n\nVirat, when translated literally from Sanskrit, means "majestic". Contrary to popular belief, a Virat doesn\'t have to be from one of the *Dhārmic* faiths. Though certainly not as common; Christians and even Muslims can be Virat. \n\nA Virat Hindu/Sikh/Jain is somebody who takes immense pride in his *Dhārmic* heritage. This pride stems from a realisation of belonging to the oldest surviving civilization and is also, in part, reactionary; centuries of being conquered, invaded and losing all your glory is going to do that to you. It manifests itself in things as simple as an open appreciation of the indigenous culture; like wearing a *Kada*/*Kalava*/*Rudraksh* in circles where it\'s considered "uncool" to something as brave as refusing to cite the *shahada* even in the face of death.\n\nFor the Muslim and the Christian, Viratness expresses itself as an unwavering allegiance to India and the Indic culture. Unlike (Indian) followers of the Dhārmic faiths whose religion was formulated in the very land they live in and is thus inseparable from it\'s culture, Muslims and Christians follow an "imported" religion; that too one which was brought over by invaders. This creates a dichotomy in their mind wherein they are often put in situations where they have to choose between the two (Nation and Religion). The Virat Christian/Muslim will always choose the nation, even if it means being branded as a "traitor" to their (religious) brethren. Think Mohammed Kaif celebrating the Triple Talaq verdict even in the face of death threats from Islamic trolls, or Tom Alter/Ruskin Bond refusing to call themselves as anything other than Indians despite them being looked at as "outsiders" because of their "firangi heritage".\n\nVirats of all heritages will never LARP as Aryans(Hindus)/Anglos (Christians)/Arabs(Muslims), because to them, it\'s not a compliment, it\'s an insult.'<br />Author: 'TerryMcGinnis1999'<br />id: 'fwpe8g'<br />Flair :Research</li>

How dare they claim they care about their nation and it isn\'t a publicity stunt when their attitudes are such , these bollywood people barely have any education and have the knowledge of nincompoop and yet they\'d call right wingers with an honest mean of earning and people who pay proper taxes and commit hardwork as jahil and gawar and claim themselves to be INtellEcTuaL and woke ? I mean how dare they , Ms dhoni\'s net worth is around 700 million but how much did he contribute to the pm care fund ? 1 lakh rupees fucking 1 lakh is it like a formaly for him , my father who\'s just a doctor who owns a small clinic contributed more than him , are these our idols ? Is this what we follow and idolize , do these people deserve the respect that\'s bestowed upon them , are we that gullible ?  Why do we pay attention to their opinions and form opinions based on theirs too how do we allow them to influence us and dwindle our own mindset ?

I totally agree with this but there is a specific ministry, particularly for this i.e. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and they are regularly holding a press conference headed by joint secretary Lav Agarwal @ [https://www.youtube.com/user/pibindia/videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/pibindia/videos). The information is literally a click away. Personally I think Modi Ji should have mentioned the abuse on doctors.\n\n2) A Blackout Possibility. About this Ministry of Power has released a statement and advisory that they will be able to handle it([https://pib.gov.in/newsite/pmreleases.aspx?mincode=52](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/pmreleases.aspx?mincode=52)). But the criticism is also valid because we have seen a blackout in 2012(unrelated but still). We should not underestimate it and there is a worst-case scenario.\n\nEveryone has their own opinions on whether to do this or not and I respect that. ***The request I want to make is that please don't pray that our country sees the worst-case scenario today.*** Taali/Thaali bajao was a highly successful event except for some dumbfucks who came on the roads but people from the richest to the poorest had that smile that we are in this together and we will fight it. \n\nThis request is coming from an incident where my friend who is a proper Anti-Modi literally prayed while we were on a conference call that worst-case should happen. Whatever fraction you belong to please don't pray or wish this, Indian lives will be lost from this and we have already lost 104 lives and 3332 are still fighting. I still back this idea because lives are tough right now and unity gives us the strength to fight. \n\nThank You, Please Stay Home and Stay Safe.\n\nJai Hind."<br />Author: 'UselessSadistic'<br />id: 'fvaipu'<br />Flair :Rant</li>

Then became a cynical, nihilistic atheist as I grew older and read science. Till the age of.....I guess 14-15, really hated Muslims and thought all Muslims were terrorists. But ever since modi came to power and all the shit broke loose ( mob lynching, hate crime, asifa case, hate speech, demonetization, rise in corruption) I started going from seeing all Muslims as terrorists to seeing them as humble, poor, innocent victims. I was like, " Hey! Right wingers are so evil. Why are they targeting Muslims? Surely not all Muslims are bad. " I began sympathizing with mob lynching and rape victims (asifa) and started leaning more and more towards AAP like parties. It should be noted that before modi I actually hated Muslims. Only after modi, I started feeling sorry for Muslims. \n\nRecently an actress had said that BJP politicians are hypocrites for viewing porn in Parliament themselves but asking others to watch ramayan. And all you bhakts started accusing her of comparing ramayan to porn. Like seriously.... Wtf... Lol. Whatever. Because of this corona virus shit now that Muslims are showing their true colors, the dormant hatred for Muslims inside me has started to get awakened again. \n\nI am going through such a dilemma. Accepting that I hate Muslims would mean accepting defeat in front of bhakts like you. All these years I fought you with my moral authority, code of conduct and this holier than thou attitude. All that would go to waste. I never really identified with liberals, feminists and shit. I always saw myself as somebody who is above all( both leftists and righties). I hated feminists/liberals just as much as I hated fake and evil dhongi bhakts who in the name of religion spread so much bullshit. I am still gonna have that sense of moral superiority over you. That my hatred is pure. Where as yours comes with a pricetag. You do it for money.

I’m not sure if i had read this somewhere in an article online or on a sub where someone had posted it. I was looking for the post where, in case, it had been posted but couldn’t find it and thought i’d post it here if anyone is interested or like me, has been trying to find this. This is not mine and i do not take any credit for it. What i do know is that this study was done by an American researcher. I have no knowledge about this so please do enlighten me incase you know anything about this. It’s an interesting read.\n\n\n\nWhen the Muslim population remains under 2% in a country, they will be seen primarily as a peace-loving minority and not as a threat to other citizens. This is the current situation in:\n\nUnited States — Muslim 0.6%\n\nAustralia — Muslim 1.5%\n\nCanada — Muslim 1.9%\n\nChina — Muslim 1.8%\n\nItaly — Muslim 1.5%\n\nNorway — Muslim 1.8%\n\nAs the Muslim population reaches 2% to 5%, they begin to recruit from ethnic minorities and disaffected groups, within prisons and street gangs. This is happening in:\n\nDenmark — Muslim 2%\n\nGermany — Muslim 3.7%\n\nUnited Kingdom — Muslim 2.7%\n\nSpain — Muslim 4%\n\nThailand — Muslim 4.6%\n\n“From 5% on, they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population,” Dr. Hammond notes. “For example, they will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic standards) food” and increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature such food on their shelves — along with threats for failure to comply. This is happening in:\n\nFrance — Muslim 8%\n\nPhilippines — 5%\n\nSweden — Muslim 5%\n\nSwitzerland — Muslim 4.3%\n\nThe Netherlands — Muslim 5.5%\n\nTrinidad &amp; Tobago — Muslim 5.8%\n\nSoon they begin to apply pressure to allow Sharia law within their own communities (sometimes ghettos).\n\n“When Muslims approach 10% of the population, they tend to increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions,” Dr. Hammond notes. “In Paris, we are already seeing car-burnings. Any non-Muslim action offends Islam, and results in uprisings and threats, such as in Amsterdam, with opposition to Mohammed cartoons and films about Islam.” These tensions are seen on a regular basis in:\n\nGuyana — Muslim 10%\n\nIndia — Muslim 13.4%\n\nIsrael — Muslim 16%\n\nKenya — Muslim 10%\n\nRussia — Muslim 15%\n\nThe violence increases when the Muslim population reaches 20%. “After reaching 20%, nations can expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations, sporadic killings, and the burnings of Christian churches and Jewish synagogues,” such as in:\n\nEthiopia — Muslim 32.8%\n\nAt 40%, nations experience widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks, and ongoing militia warfare,” such as in:\n\nBosnia — Muslim 40%\n\nChad — Muslim 53.1%\n\nLebanon — Muslim 59.7%\n\nFrom 60%, persecution of non-believing “infidels” rises significantly, including sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia law as a weapon, and Jizya, a tax placed on infidels, such as in:\n\nAlbania — Muslim 70%\n\nMalaysia — Muslim 60.4%\n\nQatar — Muslim 77.5%\n\nSudan — Muslim 70%\n\nAfter 80%, expect daily intimidation and violent jihad, some State-run ethnic cleansing, and even some genocide, as these nations drive out “infidels,” and move toward a 100% Muslim society, which has been experienced to some degree in:\n\nBangladesh — Muslim 83%\n\nEgypt — Muslim 90%\n\nGaza — Muslim 98.7%\n\nIndonesia — Muslim 86.1%\n\nIran — Muslim 98%\n\nIraq — Muslim 97%\n\nJordan — Muslim 92%\n\nMorocco — Muslim 98.7%\n\nPakistan — Muslim 97%\n\nPalestine — Muslim 99%\n\nSyria — Muslim 90%\n\nTajikistan — Muslim 90%\n\nTurkey — Muslim 99.8%\n\nUnited Arab Emirates — Muslim 96%\n\nA 100% Muslim society will theoretically usher in their version of peace — the peace of ‘Dar-es-Salaam’ — the Islamic House of Peace. “Here there’s supposed to be peace, because everybody is a Muslim, the Madrassas are the only schools, and the Koran is the only word,” such as in:\n\nAfghanistan — Muslim 100%\n\nSaudi Arabia — Muslim 100%\n\nSomalia — Muslim 100%\n\nYemen — Muslim 100%\n\n“Unfortunately, peace is never achieved, as in these 100% states the most radical Muslims intimidate and spew hatred &amp; satisfy their blood lust by killing less radical Muslims, for a variety of reasons.”'<br />Author: 'thatlankyfellow'<br />id: 'fv08ib'<br />Flair :Research</li>

I am not downplaying the threat that Pakistan is to India, but we are seriously ignoring a much severe threat that is expanding ambitions of China. We all know Pakistan is nothing compared to India, in all fields, sports, arms and armies, economy, growth, intellect, etc. but to feel supirior we always focus on Pakistan, and China is using our obsession, they are building belt &amp; road initiative, strings of pearls, etc. to strip India of the control and power that we still have in the region. China has infiltrated our markets to deep extent (how many of you are reading this on a chinese phone?). They are not only becoming more powerful but also stripping India of it's existing power. And we are not even aware of it. We are constantly comparing ourselves with Pakistan (even in the time of this pandemic crisis), but why? To feel supirior. China is much more powerful than us in economics and world influence (no offense), and slowly we are even loosing our current influence. In some recent years influence of India has surely increased, but still we have a long way to go. For every news channels, youtubers, media outlets they publish almost 20 sources which bashed Pakistan to one against China. Seriously we need to take china seriously or else we will become just another nation on the globe. Even USA which is arguably most influential nation in world is taking China seriously, but we, who share a boundary with China are not. We all know the expanding ambitions that china has, it did invade Tibet and destroyes their culture and their people. I have complete faith in our Indian armed forces but still if we continue to ignore China, we will loose Arunachal Pradesh to them(China claims Arunachal as South Tibet and has ambitions to invade it just like Tibet). China invaded Tibet when China was not even a super power, and still world didn't retaliated, what makes you think that the world whould now retaliate now given now China is indeed a super power. There is a serious need for us to realise the real threat is to the sovereignty of India. We lost Aksai Chin and no one came to help india, but we still are obsessed with POK. If there was no China threat, POK can be taken back within a weak( I know Pakistan has nukes, but still we have defence mechanisms and mostly our intelligence knows the location of these nukes in Pakistan, we can quickly neutralize them. Pakistan doesn't have nuclear submarines or aircraft carriers. They only have stationary nukes, which can be dealt with). The only threat that India has while attacking POK is China, as we cannot handle both Pakistan and China simultaneously. Our aim should be either to weaken China or form good relations with them(like USA-Canada), so that if we try to fight Pakistan,  China should not intervene. What do you think is greater threat to India's sovereignty, Pakistan or China?"<br />Author: 'dev_me1'<br />id: 'fujnkh'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li>

<li>Title: 'In defence of श्री Rāma―The मर्यादापुरुषोत्तम'<br />Body: 'Today marks Rāmanavamī, Lord Rām\'s birthday. The same Lord Rāma who, on the one hand, is upheld as the very embodiment of justice and righteousness by Hindus (especially Vaishnav\'s) and yet, is reviled as a misogynist and a "custodian of patriarchy" by the dominant Marxist intelligentsia on the other. Who exactly is right, then???\n\nIn Vaishnava theology, the all pervading Godhead, *Narāyana* which encompasses everything and yet is beyond is said to take birth from time to time amongst various sentient beings as an act of *Lilā* —Divine Play. As a part of this divine play, the Lord sets aside His "glory" and "forgets" Himself upon entering this world. He is then limited and conditioned by the same three *gunās* of our world—Sattva (mode of purity, calmness), Rajas (mode of passion, activity) and Tamas (mode of ignorance, lethargy).\n\nIn the Scion of Ikshvākū, we see the very embodiment of one of these gunās, Sattva. Rāma is Narāyana incarnate, but He doesn\'t *know*; and frankly, couldn\'t care less. He has not a moment\'s hesitation before giving up the entire kingdom despite being raised His entire life believing that He would be it\'s rightful inheritor. Indeed, Rāma proceeds to take the blessings of the very "mother" who had separated Him from His father before leaving for His exile. Because in Rām\'s worldview, there is no place for hatred or revenge, especially not towards his elders, howsoever wrong they may be.\n\nRāma takes no time to adjust to the simple life of the forests because he has always been a renunciate, totally detached from worldly pleasures. He refuses the advances of Sūrpanakhā in the guise of a beautiful woman despite her subtle taunts about His masculinity and it being in vogue for men (especially royal ones) to have multiple wives. For Rāma, masculinity is not about having multiple wives with unending sexual virility, but doing the right thing without expectations for fame and glory. For Rāma (who otherwise is an ocean of compassion and love), there is but one space in his heart when it comes to love of the romantic kind, and it has already been occupied by Jānakī.\n\nAfter the Sitā Haran, we get to see Rāma in his full glory—human as well as divine. We feel His *vyākultā* while searching for Bhūmī Sūtā. We see the Prince of Ayodhya willing to ask help from anybody and everybody who can help Him be united with His *ardhangini*. And yet, we also see Rāma not wavering from His Dharmā, even in these testing times. We see Him being steadfast and *sanyamit* even when Sūgriva forgets his promise of helping Him find Sitā. We see Him eating the jūthan of Shabrī with elation, as if He has never eaten a more delicious meal in His life. For Rāma, *karunā* and *dharma* are second nature. It\'s not a façade put on to gain "popularity". It\'s ingrained in His very *core*. There is no Rāma without *karunā* and *dharmā*.\n\nFor Ramā, Dharmā is *sarvoparī* and people could take all His credit for it\'s upholding whilst simultaneously casting aspersions on His character, and He wouldn\'t care one bit. As long as Dharmā is being upheld, our Rāma would gracefully accept all the criticisms hurled at Him.\n\nSuch is *Siyāvar* Rāma. Such is our Maryādā Purūshottam🙏🏻.'<br />Author: 'TerryMcGinnis1999'<br />id: 'ftl71d'<br />Flair :Research</li>

<li>Title: "Telegraph Article about China's Reckoning (We must treat China like a hostile state)"<br />Body: "Link: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/04/01/coronavirus-means-must-now-treat-china-like-hostile-state/\n\n(Full text here because it's paid site)\n\nWhen the Government says that there needs to be a “reckoning” with China once the coronavirus emergency is over, its focus must be much broader than simply examining Beijing’s culpability in creating the pandemic.\n\nThe deliberate lack of transparency and cooperation that has characterised the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) response to the outbreak since the virus was first identified in Wuhan constitutes nothing less than a fundamental breach of trust between China and the rest of the world.\n\nDespite Beijing’s attempts to cover up the true scale of the outbreak in China, British scientists are now warning Downing Street that the CCP has probably downplayed the number of cases by a factor of 15 to 40.\n\nTo make matters worse, Beijing has compounded its reprehensible behaviour by launching a disinformation campaign that seeks to portray China as the victim, rather than being the instigator of a global health crisis that has so far claimed almost 40,000 lives worldwide, and caused the greatest slump in global economic activity since the Second World War.\n\nChina’s attempts to blame the initial outbreak on an American military delegation that visited Wuhan last October have received short shrift in Washington, while British ministers have privately expressed their disgust at Beijing’s attempts to exploit the pandemic for economic gain with what they call “predatory” offers of help for affected countries.\n\nNor, as Beijing declares “victory” in its own campaign against the virus, is there any evidence that China has learnt its lesson. The reopening of live animal markets, where bats and scorpions are offered as traditional medicine, suggests China’s rulers have no intention of fulfilling their pledge to close the markets, which is where the virus is believed to have originated.\n\nAt every level, the CCP’s response to the coronavirus challenge has been contemptible, to the extent that, once the present crisis is over, there needs to be a radical rethink in Britain and other Western countries about our future dealings with Beijing.\n\nCertainly, the idea that it will be business as normal so far as our trade ties with Beijing are concerned will be totally unacceptable to the vast majority of the British public.\n\nThere is a deepening resentment among ordinary citizens that China is ultimately to blame for the disruption the pandemic has inflicted on their daily lives, for causing the greatest assault on their personal freedoms in peacetime, for millions of workers losing their jobs or taking pay cuts, and for victims of the coronavirus ending their days alone and isolated from their loved ones.\n\nChina’s appalling conduct from the outset has led ministers to warn that the country risks becoming a “pariah state”, and this assessment must be at the heart of how Britain shapes its future relationship with the CCP.\n\nThe first, and most obvious, casualty of Britain adopting a more robust approach to Beijing should be Boris Johnson’s questionable decision to allow the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei access to Britain’s new 5G telecoms network. Even if Mr Johnson persists with the flawed assessment that Huawei can maintain its involvement without jeopardising national security, the Prime Minister will face renewed Cabinet pressure to terminate the arrangement.\n\nSerious consideration must also be given to Britain’s broader trade links with China, which are currently worth around $25 billion a year. For too long British politicians and business leaders have kow-towed to Beijing and ignored the CCP’s repressive rule in the hope of landing lucrative contracts. This has resulted in important sectors of the British economy being out-sourced to the Chinese, from the manufacture of car components to vital pharmaceuticals.\n\nChampions of these profitable trade ties, such as former chancellor George Osborne, who once enthused about a “golden era” in Sino-British relations, worked on the assumption that Beijing did not pose a threat to British interests.\n\nThe naivety of this approach has been exposed through China’s response to the coronavirus, with the CCP at one point threatening to withhold the export of key medicinal supplies. If China can no longer be trusted to honour existing trading arrangements in our hour of need, then industry leaders must give serious consideration to relocating key manufacturing back to Britain.\n\nThe Government’s forthcoming integrated defence and security review is another area where we need to take heed of the threat China poses to our well-being. The last defence review, in 2015, worked on the assumption that Russia was the state that posed the biggest threat to our security.\n\nThis assessment will need to be reviewed in the light of the immense damage Beijing has inflicted on the nation’s economy and health. In future, we will need to focus our attention as much on the inner workings of the CCP’s Central Politburo as we do the Kremlin.\n\nThe era when gullible politicians in the West could give China’s motives the benefit of the doubt is well and truly over."<br />Author: 'brohan28'<br />id: 'ft8y5p'<br />Flair :Bakchod News</li>

<li>Title: 'Lachit Borpukhan – The Hero of Assam and Pride of India #1 (Not a meme post)'<br />Body: " Background – The mighty **Ahom Kingdom of Assam**\n\nSince their beginning in the year of 1228 AD, The Ahom kingdom (in Assam) had defeated all the attacks from various Islamic Dynasties. **Whether it was Khilji Sultanate, Tughlaq Sultanate, Ilyas Sultanate or Lodhi Sultanate, none was able to defeat the valour of the Ahom kingdom**. However, in the year 1661 AD Aurangzeb, the warlord of the biggest army in India, the Mughals sent his army in the leadership of two of his most trusted generals Mir Jumla and Diler Khan to conquer Assam and Bengal. Mir Jumla led a naval invasion of Ahom Kingdom. During this period, the Ahom Kingdom had lost many great men and the unity that resisted all the previous Invasions. The Mughals' campaign was successful; they won many forts without even a fight from the Ahom Kingdom. The King of Ahom Kingdom, Jaydhwaj Singha ji fought the invasion bravely but he had to retread and even lost a significant portion of the territory in the battle.\n\nThe battle was lost and the King had to agree to a humiliating treaty to save the life of his compatriots. In this treaty, he gave up his land, money, his elephants, a significant portion of the Calvary and weapons. Nevertheless, gaining territory was not enough for the Mughal Aurangzeb; the Mughals also took the King’s six-year daughter to Mughal Harem. **King Jaydhwaj Singha could not bear this pain and passed away**. In the wake of King’s death, Chakradhwaj Singha ji became the new king.\n\n**Lachit Borpukhan** – A brief introduction to the gallant warrior\n\n**Lachit Borpukhan ji** was born around 1620 AD, his father **Momai Tamuli Barbarua ji** was a senior officer in the Kingdom. Lachit ji had a keen interest in the Royal affairs and always wanted to show his love for his Kingdom. With his ability and courage, he achieved a senior position in the king’s administration.\n\nIn the year 1665 AD, the army needed a new Borpukhan. *In Ahom Army, the Borpukhan is the Army Cheif or the Commander who controls the entire army*. After discussing the matter with his ministers, the King Cakradhwaj Singh ji agreed that there could not be anyone more capable for the position of Borpukhan than the Lachit ji. **Therefore, Lachit ji was named the Borpukhan of the Army**. It was a very difficult time for the Ahoms. Their Army had become disjointed and dejected; they did not even possess the proper weapons and arms to fight with the enemy. Therefore, Lachit ji spent the next four years organizing the army. They recruited and trained the soldiers, built weapons and boats for the navy, strengthened the fort and improved the army infrastructure.\n\nThey were successfully able to keep the rebuilding of the Army a secret from the Enemy. In the year 1667 AD Firoz Khan had been named the head of the Ghuwati fort. Firoz Khan was a cruel and hedonistic person. Driven by his pursuit of pleasure he demanded that the King Chakradhwaj Singha ji must present him Assamese Girls whenever he wished. This was the final straw for the Ahom Kingdom who had remained silent for a long time. This incident enraged the people and the King equally; they wanted to end the Mughal rule on their land at once. Lachit Borpukhan ji decided to take back the Ghuwati Fort from the Mughals. With the years of preparation, Lachit ji had changed the disjointed and disinvested army to the fiercest warriors in India. But no matter the might of the Ahoms and how well-trained the army was, they were lacking in the numbers, especially in the calvary. Their biggest challenge was going to be the fort of Itakuli. Itakuli was the frontier which defended Ghuwati. If the Ahom Army was successful in capturing the Itakuli fort, they would have taken the Ghuwati back but the task was going to be onerous. **With determination in their hearts, they led the siege to the Itakuli.**\n\nSubscribe to - HindutvaRises subreddit for more\n\nPlease feel free to correct me in the comments below if any mistake is found.

I was born into a middle class family, i am an introvert and you can say i am a "seedha-saadha" baccha or so my relatives and teachers said when i was in high school and college. This made me to behave like an adult and not like a child or a teenager. Result, no social aptness, no good stories to tell and a 22 year old kissless virgin.\n\nThough i got a job right after i graduated, i still dont have any social skills, i am learning though. During one of my research sessions i stumbled upon the redpill, mgtow and asktrp scene, it changed my perception about women and overall about people. I got into nofap too, and realised that my problems can be solved by not fapping.\n\nI didnt know i was that addicted to pmo until i tried nofap. Even though I started fapping very late like when i was 18, that habit has caused my life more damage than anything else. I battled with anxiety, depression and self sabotaging and still am fighting with it.\n\nI tried leaving fapping cold turkey and made it to 20 days. It felt great but the constant exposure from reddit,even only the sfw posts made me relapse.\n\nI have become a shell of myself,and had watched lots of legal questionable porn, my mind is fucked up. Even though i am a functional human being, i am always angry at myself, constantly anxious about nothing and not being able to concentrate for more than 30 minutes.\n\nI too have a dream to visit Ram Mandir with my future wife and parents.

Dasharatha is reluctant at first but upon being insisted by Vashistha, decides to send Ram and Lakshman with Vishwamitra. They fight Tadaka in the forest. \n\n* Mahabharata : Devavrata, the son of Ganga and Shantanu, is starting out on his princely adventures in the prosperous land of Hastinapura. He encounters a foreign force at the frontiers of Hastinapura, whom he tries taking down on his own.\n\n*And now, on to the next episodes...*\n\nTelecast details :\n\nRamayana : IST 9am and 9pm (DD National)\nMahabharata : IST 12 noon and 7pm (DD Bharati)'<br />Author: 'Catappa_mama'<br />id: 'fqys4q'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>

<li>Title: 'I have to laud them for their tactics.'<br />Body: "#Make no mistake comrades.\n\nThe coronavirus fiasco can deceive the general populace. \nBut not us, \n\nHere are a list of ways that the fascist govt. has used the coronavirus to its advantage.\n\n\n\n1. *They've deliberately spread the virus* .Hear me out, when Shri Rahul Gandhi was emphasising the need to take harsh measures against the coronavirus, Mudi kaka was busy eating bati chokha. They literally took no measures to stop the spread of covid 19 and here we are. \n\n\n\n2. *Coronavirus was used to evacuate Shaheen Bagh*. Ever since they'd come to power, nothing had rattled their seats like the Shaheen Bagh Shernis did. They had to get rid of that anyhow and hence they released the Virus.\n\n\n\n3.* Islamophobia* : Mosque gathering has been banned. How will my muslim brethren pray to the almighty Allah now. This is ab attempt to supress Islam and it cannot get any more blatant than that. \n\n\n\n4. *This will help them blame the virus for the state of economy*. As we all know, Mudi kaka had butchered the economy of our country and just when the people started to realise that, BOOM,  covid 19 is here.  You'll know math, I'll leave the 2+2 to you. I can't believe that they can do this to their citizens just to escape responsibility. \n\n\n5.* Thali banging and clapping*: After imposing curfew, this fascist notoriously asked his bhakts to bang plates and clap. Make no mistake, it wasn't an appreciation gesture.  It was a means to tease those of us fighting for the cause. \n\n\n6. This lockdown is just these fascists exercising their fetish for authoritarian practices. There was no need of lockdown.\nWhat we needed was mass testing just like South Korea and Taiwan.  Trust me guys the true numbers are over a hundred thousand in India,  a doctor sitting in Germany has told me that the Indian government is hiding the true numbers. \n\n\n\n\nThanks to covid 19 I cannot even emigrate to first world countries now."<br />Author: 'Insanibhedia'<br />id: 'fqhew6'<br />Flair :Randia Simulation</li>
