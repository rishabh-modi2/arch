Madan singh Rathore was weapon teacher of Guru har gobind and fought against mughals for him .Sardar Mandan singh Rathore saved guru hargobind singh at the battle of rohilla and  taught \'shastarvidya to Sikhs \' and militarised them.\n\n2. Bajjar singh Rathore was the teacher of Guru Gobind singh ji maharaj.\n\n3.Alam singh chauhan was the teacher of sahibzadas(sons of guru gobind singh ji maharaj).\n\n4. Mirza raja jai singh kachwaha of jaipur was a devotee of sikh gurus.He saved guru tegh bahadur sahib ji when he was arrested first time while travelling towards bihar,bengal and assam.jai singh went against the order of Aurangzeb and relesed guru sahib.\n\n5. Banda singh bahadur was a minhas rajput.He became the leader of sikhs after the death of guru gobind singh ji.He captured the mughal state of sirhind and took revenge from wazir khan who killed innocent sons of gurupita gobind singh ji and also gave zamindari rights to petty peasant\'s in punjab.\n\n6.Gurudwara bangla sahib actually belongs to mirza raja jai singh kachwaha of jaipur.He donoted his personal bungalow to sikh gurus.\n\n7 .The concept of keeping kirpan comes from Rajputana culture .\n\n8.The 1st governer of khalsa raj was a sikh rajput.\n\n9. Elder son from hindu family was given to Gurus to save Dharma.\n\n10. Mati Das , Dayal Das , Sati Das were Hindus who sacrificed their Life but didn\'t accept Islam just like Guru Teg Bahadur. \n\n11.  Sardar gulab Singh Rathore was the founder of \'dallewalia misl\'.\n\n12. Rai bular bhatti gave guru nanak 18000 acres of land...\n\nBHAI BACHITTAR SINGH  and many more....\n\nBut, Nothing can enter into radical misguided Sikhs\' mind now, they are brainwashed completely with distorted history + manipulated events and radicalized with hatred against BJP and superiority complex over Hindus till their core.\n\n--------------- What Sikhs will never talk about ---------\n\n1. Britishers preferred  Sikhs in their army because they were least hesitant to kill and fire at people when ordered by Britishers. Especially after the mutiny of 1857 where everyone had revolted except Sikhs. Britishers found it hard to have complete faith on solders from rest of India after having tasted mutiny from them in 1857.\n\n2. Sikh regiment was also a  part of Jalianwala bagh Massacre who had fired at people on General\'s orders.\n https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jallianwala_Bagh_massacre \n\nWhereas, Entire battalion of Garhwal Rifles was sentenced to kala pani  by Britishers when they had refused to shoot at protestors in Peshawar. It\'s also called Qissa Khwani Massacre.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qissa_Khwani_massacre\n\nBritish civil servant wrote later that "hardly any regiment of the Indian Army won greater glory in the Great War (World War I) than the Garhwal Rifles, and the defection of part of the regiment sent shock waves through India, of apprehension to some, of exultation to others." \n\nThe NCOs of the two platoons, including one led by Hawaldar Major Chandra Singh Garhwali, involved were sentenced to terms of up to eight years imprisonment"\n\n3. Maharaja Ala Singh , A sikh was the Founder of Patiala Kingdom and  was a boot licker of Abdali.The Wadda Ghallughara happened during February 1762, where about 40,000 Sikhs were killed by Abdali. Due to Ala Singh‚Äôs loyalty to Ahmed Shah Abdali, he was given land, elephants, horses, camels, cannons, jewelery, and plenty of cash. Due to the support from Abdali, Ala Singh conquered lands of Samana, Barnala, and founded Longowal. \n\n4. Maharaja of Patiala Bhupendra Singh\n\nBhupinder Singh‚Äôs governorship of Punjab included extreme brutality by the police and he later refused to condemn the Jallianwala Massacre of April 1919. \n\nBhupinder Singh in a telegram told Dyer ‚ÄúYour action is correct and the Lieutenant Governor approves.‚Äù Instead, he was very friendly with General O‚ÄôDwyer in London.\n\n5. Jathedar Arur Singh \n\nJathedar of Akal Takht Sahib Giani Arur Singh had presented General Michael O‚ÄôDwyer with a siropa at Sri Akal Takht Sahib, the man responsible for Jallianwala Bagh on April 13, 1919. The traiter Giani Arur Singh not only presented the butcher of Sikhs a Siropa, but also gave a turban and a kirpan. \n\nThe Jathedar went so far that he declared General O‚ÄôDwyer a Sikh and stated it‚Äôs alright despite the fact he smoked cigarettes.\n\n6. Those who have problem with people saying gurus were hindus..because according to them Gurus had stopped following karm kaand and believing in Avatars. \n\nThen Why do they call Bhagat Singh a Sikh, when Bhagat Singh had become an atheist ( Nastik) ? Bhagat Singh even wrote a book " Why I am an Atheist". \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_I_Am_an_Atheist#:~:text=Why%20I%20am%20an%20Atheist%20is%20an%20essay%20written%20by,atheist%20because%20of%20his%20vanity.\n\nStupid Hypocrites !!'<br />Author: 'getbangedchatshit'<br />id: 'lpldhu'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li><li>Title: 'Add a flair for "Biased Media"'<br />Body: 'The mods of this Subreddit should add a flair for "Biased Media" so it becomes easy to find such posts.

And for that revolution violence is necessary, they will make you feel like it\'s for the greater good. Promise you a lot of freedom and liberty and all that crap and pretend to be the righteous underdog and make everyone feel like a main character in a story relvotion webdrama. And justify everything their people do as long as it will take down the govt. üòÄ\n\nSecond they come to power they kind of act good for the first 3 terms and tries their best to stay in power by appeasing.üôÇ\n\nThen they crack and go full on fascist (this word is so overused its losing it value) making it extremely difficult for another party to survive. Glorify violence especially with their sickle throught propaganda and people in their lower circles almost working like a cartel. The top ones stay rich and their dogs in the lowest tier do their dirty work and thses guys are poor af and always...always on drugs or drunk our of their lights so obviously they can see the big picture and will put their lives in the line for their masters. Their jobs include killing anyone who opposes the CPIM or at least sending a message by intimidation.üòê\n\nFinally when the face a money crisis due to the result of their stupid ideology the steal or make deals. But to them their image is important so the cover this up and anyone who possibly could let this out will be silenced. Their image is something that is of utmost importance to them. Inside ea communist state people may be suffering but everyone outside will only hear good things about. The people inside will also be a little brainwashed and think their state is the best especially the young folk only the boomers come out of this condition and realize what\'s actually happening. But the boomers will support the govt for the small help they provide  because if they dont appease the govt they can face economic boycott or straight up attacks. Drug cartels, traffickers, gold smugglers, alcohol abuse etc are the way the sustain and grow their network. And people are very hopeless here that the vote them or the popular opponent who is also shitty btw and dont supportnew comers ,hence the newcomer parties die off slowly and cant stand the violence sent their way, many youth dies in this process. Many support the even if they know they are corrupt for the freebies. Also these people make alliances with foreign countries instead of its neighboring states and some shady shit happens and then they get money from them.üò∂\n\nThis govt collect soooo much dept but somehow has money to do things they want to do. They occasionally do scams with their own people and get caught but still remain credible to their followers because when people see so much violence they it ends up becoming a normal thing. Like a random stray dog fight on the street. And finally they are proud of themselves and anyone who supports them are made to feel like a warrior of justice. Anyone who is against them is a shameless disgrace and should be eliminated. These guys are ruthless to anyone with a different opinion and want everyone to celebrate communism.ü§ê\n\nHacks to live in a communist wonderland \n\nüö©If ya wanna live here happily just pretend to be a proud communist, laal salaam, red is my favorite color I love our leader he is a philanthropist genius. \n\nüö©Never speak about any good about the  opposition but if you curse the opposition you get points. Starting a shop or buisness? Call a commi leader to inaugurate it it will bloom, if you invite someone else or not at all worst case scenario is sabotage. \n\nüö©Always praise those leaders in front of hard core commis , then they will love you a lot and be your best friends and will die for you.\n\n üö©Have trouble getting govt documents best way to accelerate the process call your closest commi relative (every family must have one they are like a free shopping gift card) and ask them to talk to the govt employee,  if your relatives in a good position then your good.\n\n üö©Got caught for an illegal act or have issues getting into an institution or hospital or anything?

I am a game developer and I just want to do something ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù in my life. Now lets get on the topic.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt traces back to Sushant Singh case. Lock-down was going on and I got enough time to give a peek on T.V news (Usually I don‚Äôt watch T.V). And I was simply shocked by the manner in which news channel covered the topic. Whether the related party got deserving justice is something which can be debated later on, but the way with which news was covered was completely disastrous. More time was spent on shouting rather than on facts. It was more like:- ‚Äúthe louder you shout, more correct your fact will become‚Äù. Immediately I decided that I will surely do something regarding it. The cool thing:- I will use my game development skills for the same\r\n\r\n(Mid-point stopper:- If my opinion regarding news channel offended you then I am really sorry from the core of my heart. It was just my opinion. I mean whole experience could have been made much better)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd there was another reason. I noticed that all news sources:- whether news channel, website based news outlets, YouTube channels etc ONLY cover one side of the news. Also they cater to left/right or to a particular community and hence the viewer does not get the whole concept at the same time. And worse, some groups in our society do not even get opportunity to communicate to the masses (infinite reasons are there).In short, no one is neutral. I want to create a platform which will belong and cater to all:-different castes, left, right, different religions, different states, EVERYONE (We will come back here later on).I want a total neutral platform\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I spend approx 6 months in creating a graphics engine which automatically combines audio, videos, images, text etc into a beautiful video. Infact it is brilliant enough to convert text into speech (I don‚Äôt have to narrate anything, computer automatically does that). In this way it would be easy for me to create professional quality videos in less time (whole process is automatic hence saves a lot of time). Some Examples:-\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/kXC9aZ9hn2U\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/1rht37nV7P0\r\n\r\n\r\nPlan of the platform which I was talking about:-I will create a YouTube channel where I will upload videos of 4 types:-\r\n\r\n1.) Top Headlines News(around 30-40 headlines will be covered in a video).\r\n\r\n2.) Quotes. (20 quotes will be there in a video).\r\n\r\n3.) News videos which will target single topics (e.g. ‚ÄúCurrent status of farmers protest in India‚Äù)\r\n\r\n4.) ‚ÄúCascade Unedited‚Äù, for which you are currently reading this LONG MESSAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn ‚ÄúCascade Unedited‚Äù, other contributors (maybe you in the future) belonging from different communities and groups of the society will give content for the video. I will feed the contents into the engine and then upload on YouTube. It has multiple advantages:-\r\n\r\n1.) It will give opportunity to represent your ideas. Imagine your voice getting amplified to whole nation. And the best part:- the content will be viewed by all sections of the society which itself is the most important (and awesome) part of this point\r\n\r\n2.) It is a brilliant way to get a taste of journalism. Everyone can‚Äôt just start the journey of journalism. And obviously the credit of the video will be given to the contributor, and hence it can be used to enhance his/her resume. And even group-contribution can do wonders and I will surely plan on that too.\r\n\r\n3.) A brilliant way to group together. Example:- at the end of the video, a message can be added like ‚Äúcome to this community in Reddit/anywhere where like-minded can spend time together and exchange ideas‚Äù or ‚Äúwe are conducting a twitter storm. Surely give a participation‚Äù.\r\n\r\n4.) It will give voice to your community to whom you/your group will represent.\r\n\r\n5.) Everything will be professional. I will work very hard to make the whole concept work flawlessly\r\n\r\n6.) Overall the whole concept is neutral.\r\n\r\n7.) The contributors will absolutely not have to work hard to contribute something. Just text and few related images are required to make a cool video.\r\n\r\n8.) The contributor will decide whether the video will be monetised or not. It will solely be their decision\r\n\r\n9.) Overall my news channel will cover content from all different parts of society(left, right, different castes and classes etc). In this way channel will remain neutral and will cater to whole India. And strategically I will always remain one step ahead of other YouTube rivals. And I guess that no one has done this before.\r\n\r\n(Later on I will provide the engine to others so that the whole process becomes much easy)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are your opinions about my idea? Any advise, criticism, ideas regarding the whole concept? How well my graphics engine works? PLEASE surely provide the feedback. And sorry in advance for grammatical mistakes\r\n\r\nThanks for reading till here. It matters a lot to me.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don‚Äôt know much about Reddit and different communities. If there is a community where I should post this message then please tell that too. I will also post the message there'<br />Author: 'Cascade_Video_Game'<br />id: 'loxh06'<br />Flair :Atmanirbhar Bharat :modi:</li><li>Title: 'This subreddit should have more followers than that "India" waala....'<br />Body: 'bc block kar dete agar sachhai batayein unko to :('<br />Author: 'LostArchives'<br />id: 'lox4js'<br />Flair ::oc-: OC ‡§π‡•à BC!üí°</li><li>Title: 'German shepherd conspiracy EXPOSED'<br />Body: 'Hitler = Vegetarian.

His name is now in Indian mainstream headlines because of his connection to Disha Ravi. Lets take a closer look at Pieter Friedrich and his organization.'<br />Body: 'OFMI (Organization for Minorities of India) was founded in 2006 by Bhajan Singh Bhinder.\n\nPieter Friedrich and Bhajan Singh Bhinder are the two individuals who are most frequently quoted as speaking on behalf of OFMI.\n\nThe group has been involved in procuring arms for the Khalistan separatist movement: [The founder, Bhajan Singh Bhinder, was the subject of an undercover United States Customs Service investigation for trying to purchase C-4 plastic explosives, M-16s, AK-47s, grenade and rocket launchers, and Stinger missiles in support of the Khalistan movement in India.](https://archive.is/LinPj)\n\nBhinder has also served as a spokesperson for Sikh Youth of America, a radical organization that glorifies Sikh terrorists and has ties with the International Sikh Youth Federation, a US Department of State designated terrorist organization.\n\nSo who is Pieter James Friedrich? In his own words, Pieter Friedrich proclaims:\n\n&gt;"I\'m a Christian, foremost [...] but ultimately, I believe in constitutional republican Christian theocracy"\n\nInterestingly, he consistently promotes Fr. Joshua Lickter, a Christian priest as an effort to "collaborate" across Sikhism and Christianity. According to his LinkedIn job description he says:\n\n&gt;"I have over ten years of ministry experience in various areas, though mostly it seems I have been called to reach people on the "fringe" who would not normally go to church. I would like to continue utilizing those gifts by planting churches and ministries interested in reaching folks who normally avoid church."\n\nPieter Friedrich also maintains an organization called "Singh of Judah". Interestingly in its official Facebook page cover displays the quote, " And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. - Luke 2:10," and the page prominently features similar Christian priests (even though it is portrayed as Sikh organization).\n\n\nSources:\n\n[The curious case of the resurgence of Khalistani groups and their ally Evangelical theocrat Pieter Friedrich](https://archive.is/pbikN)\n\n[Singh vs. Singh: The Sikhs behind one faction at Fremont\'s Gurdwara are linked to violence and drugs.

The reason is also correct as Hindus themselves have zero contribution to any modern technological stuffs that they use . So, getting approval of white people for them is a must to cope with their failure.\n\nAnother primary reason is Hinduism is primarily based on racism where light coloured people where given high caste rank while dark sinned and short people where given low caste rank in social hierachy .\n\nSo, Modern right Hindus in order to get approval of people who are whiter than them i.e white people try to imitate them to get their approval. Thus they support degenerate things like - democracy , gay sex , premarital sex , women education , late marriage and other such stuffs.'<br />Author: 'GreenAssistant1'<br />id: 'lo4k9z'<br />Flair ::oc-: OC ‡§π‡•à BC!üí°</li><li>Title: 'Reservations'<br />Body: 'How come BJP never brought this issue of Reservation reforms??\n\nI had high hopes that if its anyone it going to be Modi who does anything about it.\n\n\nEspecially when he won the second time with absolute majority.\n\nIf he didnt bring this up who ever will?

I am American born so this may be a post from a western diaspora perspective. Here it is:\n\n I  admit its kind of weird coming from this sub where we constantly  complain about the racism south asian males face. I personally am more  upset with the double standard of how you cannot even provide cordial  criticism of certain groups but its open season to be racist to asian  men. Im concerned that we attribute certain negative  behaviors to south  asians even tho they are more prevalent in other groups from a  statistical and anecdotal viewpoint, however you are not allowed to call  out the other groups. Every other group has some sort of protection  from racism in this day and age even white people are now bandwagoning  behind the concept of \'reverse- racism\'.  Yet when anyone cries out  about racism against asian men it is brushed off, even asian women and a  large minority of asian men dismiss it.\n\nNow  before some of you leftists get mad at me. Let me define my  characterization of the phrase , leftist SJW pansy, for the purpose of  this post. If you support some policy like a social safety net for poor  children, some environmental protection laws, etc. I am **not**  labeling you as a leftist SJW pansy. For the purpose of this post I am  discussing the modern SJW movement that affiliates with the cultural  left. I appreciate the right wing because they are somewhat consistent.  The racist right wing hates us equally  or almost as much they hate some  hispanic immigrant. The left wing loves all minority women, then white  women, then black/hispanic men, has a strange love/hate relationship  with white men, and then absolutely loathes us and wants us removed from  existence or to be used as servant punching bags with no dignity.\n\nSo  Why is it that south asians have such an affinity to SJW Politics? I  really have no theories behind this and I dont get it since SJW politics  is not inclusive of asian men.\n\nI  found this comment from peddakondappa2 on another sub talking about  Brahmins in the SJW movement. Brahmins do account for the largest  plurality demographic among Hindu Indian-Americans Here is what he said\n\n*"I  have observed similar tendencies  within my family\'s social circles.  Brahmins are pretty much the Jews of  India. They have a significantly  higher verbal IQ than other Indian  castes, and also have a reputation  for snobbishness and extreme nepotism  (though the latter is pretty  common among Indians as a whole). In  modern times, brahmins and other  upper-caste Hindus seem to have an  innate attraction towards Liberalism  and Marxism, similar to how Jews  have had an innate attraction towards  Liberalism and Marxism ever since  those ideologies first appeared. A  common cope in Hindu nationalist  circles (which I once frequented) is  that "Soviet KGB agents" are  responsible for spreading these Marxist  ideals in India. This is similar  to the retarded boomer cope seen in  the West regarding the supposed KGB  involvement in disseminating  "Cultural Marxism" with the goal of  subverting Western society, as  described by Yuri Bezmenov.*\n\n*Although   these theories may have some truth to them, they beg the question how   these ideas could attain such currency in the West without any support   from Westerners themselves, or at least a significant and influential   portion of them. That\'s where Jews (and many Anglos as well) come into   the picture in the West, and brahmins and other upper-caste Hindus come   into the picture in India. These people don\'t need to be "brainwashed"   by some Soviet agents to adopt these radical beliefs; many will adopt   them naturally once exposed, and we can see this unfold ever since the   introduction of modern Western education in India during the British Raj   (which is when Indian communist organizations had their beginning, not   after Independence or during the Cold War). If we look at the history  of  Communism in India, we will see that despite the avowed Communist   commitment to "abolishing the caste system" and "upholding the equality   of all people," virtually all leaders of the Indian Communist parties   since their inception have been Brahmins or other upper-caste Hindus.   The current General Secretary of the CPM, the largest Marxist party in   India, is a Telugu Brahmin named Sitaram Yechury. In stark contrast, the   Hindu populist party BJP has had many lower-caste Hindus in higher   positions, including Narendra Modi (who belongs to a caste categorized   as "OBC", or "Other Backward Class")."*\n\nIn  Canada Khalistani Sikhs have also identified with furthest left wing  NDP Which is something I dont understand. While In the UK the Sikhs are  pretty right wing. Muslims have also allied with the left in western  countries, which is built on shaky ground in my opinion, but I can  understand thru the \'enemy of my enemy is my friend\' lense since Muslims  are the right wings favorite boogyman.\n\nI  personally think SJW leftists of all groups have a strong inferiority  complex and want to mask their perceived inferiority by jumping into the  SJW movement. They are fixated more so on white people than the  treatment they face. I believe a lot of SJWS truly wish they were white.  I on the other hand just want the same luxary the white man has , to be  treated as an individual, while wearing my own brown skin.\n\nTLDR: What are your thoughts on why south asians gravitate to SJW behavior?'<br />Author: 'ginobili6'<br />id: 'lmroif'<br />Flair :Indo-International üì∞</li><li>Title: '‡§∞‡§æ‡§π ‡§ï‡•å‡§®-‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§æ‡§ä‡§Å ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç? ‡§Ö‡§ü‡§≤ ‡§¨‡§ø‡§π‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§µ‡§æ‡§ú‡§™‡•á‡§Ø‡•Ä'<br />Body: '‡§ö‡•å‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡•á ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§≤‡•Å‡§ü‡§§‡§æ ‡§ö‡•Ä‡§∞, \n\n‡§™‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§¶‡•á ‡§∏‡•á ‡§™‡§ø‡§ü ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§µ‡•õ‡•Ä‡§∞, \n\n‡§ö‡§≤‡•Ç‡§Å ‡§Ü‡•ô‡§ø‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ö‡§æ‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§¨‡§æ‡•õ‡•Ä ‡§õ‡•ã‡§°‡§º ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∞‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§ø ‡§∞‡§ö‡§æ‡§ä‡§Å ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç? \n\n‡§∞‡§æ‡§π ‡§ï‡•å‡§®-‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§æ‡§ä‡§Å ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç? \n\n‡§∏‡§™‡§®‡§æ ‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡§∞ ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ, \n\n‡§Æ‡§ß‡•Å ‡§ã‡§§‡•Å ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§æ‡•ö ‡§ù‡§∞ ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ, \n\n‡§§‡§ø‡§®‡§ï‡•á ‡§ü‡•Ç‡§ü‡•á ‡§π‡•Å‡§è ‡§¨‡§ü‡•ã‡§∞‡•Ç‡§Å ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§®‡§µ‡§∏‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§ø ‡§∏‡§ú‡§æ‡§ä‡§Å ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç? \n\n‡§∞‡§æ‡§π ‡§ï‡•å‡§®-‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§æ‡§ä‡§Å ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç? \n\n‡§¶‡•ã ‡§¶‡§ø‡§® ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡•á ‡§â‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç \n\n‡§ò‡§æ‡§ü‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•á ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§™‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç \n\n‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§£-‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§£ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§π‡§ø‡§∏‡§æ‡§¨ ‡§≤‡•Ç‡§Å ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§®‡§ø‡§ß‡§ø ‡§∂‡•á‡§∑ ‡§≤‡•Å‡§ü‡§æ‡§ä‡§Å ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç? \n\n‡§∞‡§æ‡§π ‡§ï‡•å‡§®-‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§æ‡§ä‡§Å ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç?'<br />Author: 'Vikramaditya_Shakari'<br />id: 'lmo9j0'<br />Flair :DawoodWood (Entertainment) üé•</li><li>Title: 'How do I get this girl ?'<br />Body: 'So I recently  started college and there is this girls who I am interested in the only problem is I have no experience  with this shit and there are probably 10 other guys who also like her any advice?

As you know, the leftists and peacefuls have a complete and total alliance.  Their first target are Aryas and Sanatana Dharma.  One such Islamofacist leftie is Audrey Truschke/Trashcan.  She is an open anti-Hindu and is in charge of South Asian studies in Rutgers.  She claims to know Samskrtam but if you hear her pronounciation, you will know this is false.  She also is very active online and in several protests.  \n\nHere are a few pieces of evidence of her hatred of our beloved religion.\n\n* Trashcan authored a book on Aurangzeb being a misunderstood ruler who was actually very tolerant of Hindus.  She claims that any Hindu that disagrees is a Hindu extremist. This is despite the fact that this veshyAputra goat-lover murdered 4.6 million of our coreligionists and his other peaceful invader colleagues slaughtered/raped/enslaved tens of millions more.  For the  few Sikhs on here, she claims Guru Gobind Singh sung praises about this peaceful veshyAputra who slaughtered Guru Govind Singh's father and four brothers and several other of your ancestors.  She hates your guts too.  Share this news with all your Sikh friends and family; far too many are blaming the crimes of Khangressi ex-Hindonts on actual Aryas who have been against pogroms against you by lefties.  Aryas despise the Nehru/Gandi family since we are their biggest enemy; why would we attack the community of those who opposed them?\n* Her husband and father-in-law are missionaries in Bharata\n* Trashcan is also a part of this anti-Hindu organization called SAHI (Students Against Hindutva Ideology).  All of the other board members are peacefuls with known ties to peaceful extremists.  They have started a movement called Holi Against Hindutva.  Their page and board members have insulted Sanatana Dharma directly multiple times yet claim to not be against the religion, just Hindutva (which means the essence of being a Hindu in Samskrtam).  One of its peaceful/leftist founders Ajit Sahi said that sacred cows make for the best burgers.  Their twitter page claims Raksha Bandhana is sexist but wishes Happy Eid.\n* **Trashcan claims that Goddess Sita told Lord Rama that he was a pimp that loaned her out to other men.  This should INFURIATE you as a believer.  Make no mistake, this veshyA despises us.  She purposely used an incorrect translation of a word to imply this as proven by this video:** \n   * [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BMXVgqrMJY&amp;ab\\_channel=RajivMalhotraOfficial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BMXVgqrMJY&amp;ab_channel=RajivMalhotraOfficial)\n\nThere are several other pieces of evidence against this leftist scumbag.  I implore all of you to not watch her videos or view her articles (or those of other leftists/leftist orgs), and definitely don't buy her books as all of this provides money to her.  If you want to know more about her, read articles and watch videos by fellow Aryas like Sham Sharma and others.\n\nHere are a few articles/videos I suggest you go through.\n\n* [https://haribhakt.com/terrorist-aurangzeb-was-curse-on-humanity-killer-of-4-6-million-hindus/](https://haribhakt.com/terrorist-aurangzeb-was-curse-on-humanity-killer-of-4-6-million-hindus/)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px16p6ag-ug&amp;ab\\_channel=TheShamSharmaShow-Global](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px16p6ag-ug&amp;ab_channel=TheShamSharmaShow-Global)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTi7tenXmhQ&amp;ab\\_channel=OpIndiaHindi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTi7tenXmhQ&amp;ab_channel=OpIndiaHindi)\n\nThere was also another post in Reddit with links to several emails of individuals in leftist institutions that support SAHI in their war against Dharma.

Let‚Äôs be clear, Hindus have always been secular, our religion itself allows for so much freedom. We freely visit Masjids, Churches, Gurudwaras. We celebrate festivals like Christmas. We have no problems if a Muslim or Christian practices their religion privately.  \n\nOur issue is that these Abrahamic religions are the intolerant ones who attack our culture, our identity. They call us Kaffirs, cow worshippers, demonic cults. They freely mock our gods, but one word against their Prophet and they will burn a neighbourhood. They blast their Azaan freely, but one Jai Shree Ram near their houses and they will lynch or stone us. They spend billions converting the poorest Hindus to increase their numbers, and then when they become majority, they commit Genocides to literally murder us and drive us out of our homes (Kashmir). Then they say that we are communal and fascist, and they are peaceful LOL. Just look at any Islamic country in the world, are they secular? Can you freely practice Hinduism there and not live in fear everyday?  \n\nSo the truth is that Islam in fact is not secular and is incredibly intolerant, and the ‚ÄòRW‚Äô Hindu movement is in PROTEST of their intolerance. If THEY were secular, then there would be absolutely no issues. Why are there no issues between Hindus and Jains/Buddhists/Parsis? Because we are all tolerant faiths that respect everyone.  \n\nWe have always been on the secular side, but no longer can we tolerate their intolerance. Don‚Äôt let their academics and intellectuals shame us by saying that we are not secular, point out the hypocrisy. They expect us to be secular and weak while these Abrahamic religions remain intolerant. That‚Äôs not how it works, for secularism to work EVERYONE has to be secular and tolerant. Why don‚Äôt they ever question Islam‚Äôs lack of secularism? Because if they do, they will get beheaded, and that is the crux of the REAL issue. We are the ones actually fighting so that India can remain secular.'<br />Author: 'itiswhatitis2323'<br />id: 'lmenzu'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: 'What is your opinion on compulsory sex education at school?'<br />Body: 'Keep the discussion irreligious, since each community is plagued by these problems.'<br />Author: 'Vermakimkc'<br />id: 'lmdujf'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Vodka is like Mahatma Gandhi'<br />Body: 'Three shots are enough.'<br />Author: 'guy_at_IIT'<br />id: 'lmdsg9'<br />Flair ::bait: Bait ‡§π‡•à BC</li><li>Title: 'How India Plans to Vaccinate 3.6 Billion People Globally from Covid-19 | Largest Vaccination Drive'<br />Body: 'India on verge to supply vaccines to a record 3.6 billion people globally -&gt;[https://youtu.be/Eeot1t5FL7I](https://youtu.be/Eeot1t5FL7I).

I know this because I have also stopped looking at posts from here because of it, many times. I do end up coming back from time to time, because where else can I go (lol)? Being a woman is not easy and you‚Äôre literally a target because of the body parts you have. If you guys do care about the women of our country and want us all to feel safe, please try to make every space safe for us, including this one. I do agree with most of what this subreddit stands for but it‚Äôs hard to join you completely when you‚Äôre going against one of the issues that are most important and close to my heart. I can‚Äôt speak for all women, but this is how I feel. \n\n(TLDR also became too long sorry lol) \n\nI‚Äôm not sure if anyone will read this or even think about it for more than a second, but I have to try. I hope that you will read the entire post and try to understand where I‚Äôm coming from. I would love to have a healthy discussion as well! \n\nI am a woman who loves and supports India as much as all of you do. I am also a feminist. I‚Äôm sure some of you may have written me off by seeing that word but please, read until the end. \n\nBefore I get to the point, let‚Äôs get a few things cleared up. \n\nWho is a feminist? Someone who believes in political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes. \n\nWhy do women need reservations and special considerations if they want to be equal then? Because women are oppressed in this day and age. We don‚Äôt get the same opportunities, same pay, same respect as men do. We need a leg up to bridge this gap that has been there for hundreds of years. \n\nWith that said, it is wrong when women abuse these systems for their own gain. This hurts other women more than anyone else, and honestly it‚Äôs extremely frustrating and disappointing when this happens. \n\nI understand that most of reddit is filled with men, including this subreddit and it shows. It‚Äôs another place in the world where I would love to see more women speaking up and occupying the space. It‚Äôs sometimes hard to speak up because of the way we get shut down. A lot of times, it‚Äôs easier to just talk to people who already understand your problems and views, than to change someone else‚Äôs mind. This might drive women away to other subreddits where they feel safer, among people who share their ideologies and I‚Äôm sure none of us want that to happen. \n\nWhat triggered me to write this was the post of Pratap Simha‚Äôs tweet, where he replied to Taapsee Pannu. Most of the tweet was fair but he also wrote, ‚ÄúYou broke your marriage coz of one Thappad‚Äù, in reference to her movie. Is he saying that women should stay with men who hit their wives? Are we just supposed to stay silent and not do anything? How would you feel if you were slapped by your wife? How would you feel if your sister, daughter, mother, friends were hit by their husbands? Are you condoning the abuse? \n\nPratap Simha could have chosen to address just the issue at hand and not bring something completely irrelevant into this argument. Or, the user who shared this could have said, I agree with most of the post but not this sentence. But neither of them happened and that‚Äôs disappointing. It may seem like it‚Äôs not a big deal to you but it is to me, and I‚Äôm sure to many other women. \n\nI did see some comments that did not agree with what he said either and I was happy to see that! But I had scroll down to find these comments and some of the replies to these comments weren‚Äôt very pretty. \n\nThere are so many examples of such posts and pictures in this sub. It makes me question how exactly I want to identify myself. \n\nI understand that everyone won‚Äôt see things the way I see it and it‚Äôs impossible to change everyone‚Äôs mind, but even if I can get through to one person with this post, I‚Äôll be happy. \n\nI obviously don‚Äôt have all the answers but I would appreciate it if we could at least start a discussion to make this place inclusive to everyone. \n\n(I do remember seeing a wholesome post a while back where you guys were extremely supportive of a gay person and I loved it.)\n\nThanks for reading!'<br />Author: 'masaladosebeku'<br />id: 'lkk7m2'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Paid Soros Actor Dhruv Rathee responds to String expose'<br />Body: '[https://www.youtube.com/watch?fbclid=IwAR2mQUmZ5OYJqz\\_R7iXyRM3u4wmvr5\\_89gSQtqmqTa39b-R31QBcqi3x3Yg&amp;v=vSWjn-3JWQs&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?fbclid=IwAR2mQUmZ5OYJqz_R7iXyRM3u4wmvr5_89gSQtqmqTa39b-R31QBcqi3x3Yg&amp;v=vSWjn-3JWQs&amp;feature=youtu.be)'<br />Author: 'dochack'<br />id: 'lkk51p'<br />Flair :Laal Salaam :commiehand:</li><li>Title: 'Daily discussion, screenshots, randirona, and rant post here'<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\nDaily discussion, screenshots, randirona, and rant post here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNew users introduce yourselves here.

It can get removed because it goes against the popular perception. So I am posting my response here:\n\n" This kind of feel good mindset arises from ignorance. This poster probably is not on the receiving end of hatred. As a result he thinks it is absent in TN. Hatred is very much present in TN, like everywhere else. It is just that it is not focused in the same direction as that in North India. The poster does not realize that North India is not a homogenous entity either, which arises from ignorance. Based on what he writes and that of others in the state, for them North means an Aryan dominated, Hindu state that is arrogant and wants everyone to speak in Hindi, their mother tongue. They have been fed this simplistic world view by decades old Dravidian ideology which was created on the basis of hatred. Before I go further, let me say clearly that I am not a Brahmin. I am an educated Tamil who has lived in other parts of India a lot and abroad and have spent time learning the truth for myself. That truth has convinced me that the Dravidian parties have created a population of ignorant and braindead population that thinks all root cause of evil in the state was due to Brahmins and that Brahmins are Aryans who came from the North, therefore all Hindus in the North are Brahmin supporting Hindus, to which the BJP and RSS belong, and they impose Hindi on Tamils and try to dominate them. With this simplistic logic the Dravidian parties have managed to fool these people into hating Brahmins, hating North Indians (mind you they cannot tell the difference between the Punjabi or Marathi or Bengali or Bihari) and hating Hindi and as a culmination of all this, hating the BJP. Hatred is absent in TN? Who says that?\n\nIf one wonders how all this came about, one has to look into history carefully and they will realize that all this suspicion of others and fear of Tamil being destroyed and the evil Brahmin conspiracy is a concoction developed by Christian missionaries who have worked meticulously over 150 years to create divide and widen them in various ways. The missionaries realized that Brahmins were the root of Hindu community and so long as they are there, their conversion of the locals to their faith is going to be hard. Even the lowest caste man refused to convert and he was willing to do so if the scholarly Brahmin did the same. And the Brahmins were preferred community for government jobs under the British administration due to their merit and focus on education. Other communities focused on wealth building and the Brahmins focused on education since that was the only asset they are expected to have. The missionaries sensed a lot of seeping hatred among the educated elite of the other upper castes in the state against the Brahmins. These upper castes were mostly wealthy landlords who had migrated into the state during the Vijaya Nagar empire. They knew that the anger and feelings of vengeance for dominance would come against them from the local Tamils over time. So they worked towards focusing their efforts to divert all that anger/vengeance towards the Brahmins. Justice Party was born. This later turned into a Dravidian party, whose main principle was Brahmin hatred. They projected all Tamils (including themselves along with others) to be cheated, deceived, controlled and dominated by Brahmins since time immemorial. The missionaries found their goals aligning with those of the non Tamil descendant Dravidian leaders and the party grew by leaps and bounds. They took over the media outlets and movie industry and used them as propaganda channels to create an image of Aryan dominance through the Brahmins. Then they broke apart. The DMK was born. Now the DMK needed another hatred based theme to strengthen its claims. So anti-Hindi agitation became that weapon. It is not that Tamils hate Hindi. Such has been the projection by the DMK which resorted to violence (much like the so called farmers protest today) forcing the central government to yield. Secessionist ideals were prevalent in those days. Now they got into positions of power. Unfortunately this is where they lost their track and went in a different direction - corruption. They saw opportunity to swindle the state dry and went to work systematically.\n\nAll the infrastructure for primary education, industrial growth were set up by dedicated leaders in the state that ruled prior to the arrival of the Dravidian parties to state power. No one knows about Kamaraj or Kakkan, Bhaktavatsalam, R Venkatraman, C Subramaniam in TN today. These leaders set up industrial estates across the state brining in investment on a massive scale. C Subramaniam is also one of the architects of the Green revolution in India that made our country self sufficient in food needs. R Venkatraman became a President of India. All the industrial and GDP growth in the state is the result of what these great men had done. The Dravidian leaders engaged in swindling the state and are famous for introducing the liquor industry. In fact this is one of the most profitable industries in the state today, all owned by Dravidian barons. Rivers are polluted. Water table is sucked dry. They destroyed all the ancient water storage systems across the state. Lake beds got sold for construction. Educational standard is diluted. Those who seek quality education have shifted to private institutions, all owned mostly by Dravidian party leaders and their family members. And they teach Hindi and not Tamil in those schools. IT industry growth has helped the state flourish economically.\n\nYet they are still persisting with Brahmin hatred as the means to keep their political agenda alive today. The Muslims and Christians in the state always fear the Hindus and their population. As a result they stand against the BJP coming into the state. This also curtails all the hard work done by the missionaries in the state. If BJP cuts inroads, they could revive Hindu ideals and slow down conversion. The BJP already cut the wings of the NGOs which brought in plenty of money and fed the local political parties into spewing venom across the state against Hindus and North Indians. Now they have come to the stage of saying they are not Hindus. Now there are Tamil Gods and Hindu Gods. Division has taken another step. Tamil Gods are slowly getting Christianized. The famous Thirukkural is being projected as an influence by St Thomas and is based on Bibilical ideals. Christian preachers are openly calling Hindu temples as Devil worship and Satan\'s abode. The Dravidian leader Periyar\'s statue is carefully placed in front of famous Hindu temples only (not in front of mosques or churches). There is a caption under the statue that reads, "There is no God. One who believes in God is an Idiot". Guess which God it is referring to.\n\nNow the missionaries use the various tentacles that they have across the state, in the form of a myriad of parties that oppose anything the central government tries to bring to the state as a part of the overall national development. They have NGOs that would beat the drum at home and abroad about pollution, environmental damage etc. to subdue the efforts. Natural gas pipelines, free way networks, nuclear power plants for energy needs, port upgrades, neutrino research etc. have been successfully stalled through systematic protests and resistance. A copper smelting plant in Tuticorin was successfully shut down by the missionaries (it is a majority Christian town) citing cancer induced by pollution. India lost 35% of its copper needs. We are now forced to import from China. With time, they will do what the communists did in Kerala, prevent progress and bring in backwardness and control the situation. Kerala boasts the best literacy, equality, rights, health indices, but not one industry will survive there. Most Malayalees work outside their state and the money they remit helps the state\'s economy. TN does not have the natural resources that Kerala is blessed with. But the Dravidian/Christian cartel is reducing the state\'s potential for future growth, discouraging investment in the state and flight of capital in the coming decades. With water shortage a ticking time bomb, TN will become an arid/desert state relying on remittances by Tamils working outside. Companies will close shop due to water and electricity shortage. Right now the going is good and fellows like the one who claims there is no hatred in the state are basking in ignorance. In a couple of decades the dry state will face issues and the wolves will use that to create secession from Indian union and convert the heathens to a true desert religion.\n\nI know there will be many Dravidian key board warriors coming out of the wood work after reading this. But one cannot fool those who are already foolish. I have said the truth. I feel sad to see my state being eaten alive by selfish goons and religious missionaries. You only have to look at Africa to see what they have done to that continent. TN is heading the way of Zimbabwe."'<br />Author: 'Seeker_00860'<br />id: 'lkfo3m'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm üïâÔ∏è</li><li>Title: '‡§Ø‡§π ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö‡§æ‡§à ‡§π‡•à'<br />Body: '‡§π‡§∞ ‡§≤‡•á‡§´‡•ç‡§ü ‡§µ‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§è‡§ï‡•ç‡§ü‡§ø‡§µ‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∂‡§ï‡•ç‡§≤ ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§Ç‡§°‡•Ä ‡§π‡•ã‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à'<br />Author: 'papapapappppfhao'<br />id: 'lkfkpq'<br />Flair :Laal Salaam :commiehand:</li></ol>
