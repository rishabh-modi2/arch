Mahashivratri is a festival to remember and to take our awareness to the basis of our existence: Shiva.\n\nBut, why is Shivratri celebrated? There is more than one Mahashivaratri story surrounding this occasion. Here are a few:\n\n‚Ä¢One is that Lord Shiva married Parvati on this day. So, it is a celebration of this sacred union.\n\n‚Ä¢Another is that when the Gods and demons churned the ocean together to obtain ambrosia that lay in its depths, a pot of poison emerged. Lord Shiva consumed this poison, saving both the Gods and mankind. The poison lodged in the Lord‚Äôs throat, turning him blue. To honor the savior of the world, Shivratri is celebrated.\n\n‚Ä¢One more legend is that as Goddess Ganga descended from heaven in full force, Lord Shiva caught her in his matted locks, and released her on to Earth as several streams. This prevented destruction on Earth. As a tribute to Him, the Shivalinga is bathed on this auspicious night.\n\n‚Ä¢Also, it is believed that the formless God Sadashiv appeared in the form of a Lingodhbhav Moorthi at midnight. Hence, people stay awake all night, offering prayers to the God.\nThese are some of the stories that can possibly answer why we celebrate Shivratri. But, what do we do during Shivratri?\n\n \n#WHAT TO DO ON MAHASHIVRATRI?\n\nMahashivratri is the day to honor and celebrate Lord Shiva‚Äîhonor life and celebrate existence. Most people spend the day of Mahashivratri in prayer, meditation and celebration. Here is a list of what to do on Mahashivratri:\n\n\n(1) *Observe fasting* \nOn the day of Mahashivratri\nFasting detoxifies the body and curtails the restlessness of the mind. A mind that is not restless slips into meditation easily. Therefore, fasting on Mahashivratri serves to detoxify the body and aid meditation. It is recommended to fast with fruits or foods that are easily digestible. Learn more about Mahashivratri fasting guidelines.\n\n(2) *Meditate on Mahashivratri*\nThe position of the constellations on the night of Mahashivratri is considered very auspicious for meditation. So, it is advisable for people to keep awake and meditate on Shivaratri.\nIn ancient times, people used to say, 'If you cannot meditate every day, do so for at least one day in a year - on Shivratri day - keep awake and do meditation'.\n\n(3) *Chant Om Namah Shivaya*\n‚ÄòOm Namah Shivaya‚Äô is the perfect mantra to chant on Mahashivratri, as it immediately elevates your energy.\n‚ÄòOm‚Äô, in the mantra, refers to the sound of the universe. It means peace and love. The five letters, ‚ÄòNa‚Äô, ‚ÄòMa‚Äô, ‚ÄòShi‚Äô, ‚ÄòVa‚Äô, ‚ÄòYa‚Äô in ‚ÄòNamah Shivaya‚Äô indicate the five elements - Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Ether.\nChanting ‚ÄòOm Namah Shivaya‚Äô harmonizes the five elements of the universe. When there is peace, love and harmony in all the five elements, then there is bliss and joy.\nAlong with OM Namah Shivay Chanting you can chant - Shiv Tandav Stotram and Kaal Bhairav Ashtakam\n\n(4) *Attend Mahashivratri Puja or Rudra Puja*\nRudra Puja or Mahashivratri Puja is a special ceremony performed to honor Lord Shiva. It involves singing special Vedic mantras accompanied by certain rituals. Rudra Puja brings positivity and purity to the environment and transforms negative emotions. Participating in the Puja and listening to the chants helps the mind slip into meditation effortlessly.\nMeditate to the chants of the auspicious Mahashivratri Puja at The Art of Living International Center, Bengaluru.\n\n(5) *Worship the Shivalinga*\nThe Shivalinga is a symbolic representation of the formless Shiva. Worshipping the Shivalinga includes offering ‚ÄòBel Patra‚Äô (leaves of the bel tree) to it. Offering ‚ÄòBel Patra‚Äô represents offering three aspects of your being - rajas (the aspect of you that is responsible for activity), tamas (the aspect of you that brings inertia) and sattva (the aspect of you that brings positivity, peace, and creativity). These three aspects affect your mind and actions. Surrendering the three to the Divine brings peace and freedom."<br />Author: 'Masulipatanam'<br />id: 't3nqgi'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm üïâÔ∏è</li><li>Title: 'about balakot strikes'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'logically_dumbguy'<br />id: 't3npc4'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Blocked by shiv aroor (toi journalist)'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'sahastreshvar'<br />id: 't3mt28'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: "Here's why I support the Russian invasion.

My neighbors are Muslim and it confuses me.\n\nThe father looks like a typical minthu with his beard while the mothers looks normal. I saw that they have two daughters and while the mother and one daughter do not have hijab on, the other daughter is hijabi. The thing is they all look happy and i dont see that anything  bad is happening to the daughters.\n\nThey invited me to dinner and it all looks like a normal house. Even though I was scared they might trey to convert, I went as I didn't want to offend. Honestly, it seems less formal than the hindu house I grew  up in. Again recently they had a function in this s house and I saw that the hijabi daughter had brought a friend that looked like a transgender or some LGBT.\n\nEven though I am a single Hindu woman living far away from my small village, they haven't tried to convert me or do anything like that. I don't understand. I know that they pray, but they haven't tried to convert me.\n\nNormally, Muslim men here pray on Hindu girls so they can increase the Muslim population and genocide hindus, like what is happening in Europe where Muslims try genocide and replace european people. however, they have no son, so I'm thinking whether the father will always try convert me, but they don't. They never tried to convert.\n\nI don't understand, doesn't their religion ask them to convert everyone. By not trying to convert me, are they not committing sin? Doesn't that religion want to convert everybody?\n\nI really don't understand As they look like normal people, but how can they be normal people when they are following that religion. Also, the daughters look happy, soo I don't know what is happening. Why one girl wear hijab and other doesn't? Isn't hijab mandatory? if so, why isn't the father making the wife and both girl wear hijab?\n\nAre the not following their religion and therefore living is sin as the father does not make both the daughters wear hijab, also because the hijab daughters has a friend who is an lgbt and also because they have not tried to convert me?\n\nOr are they playing the long game, acting like normal people and then convert me?"<br />Author: 'Lucky_Celery5780'<br />id: 'sw9yqr'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'What are the top 5 things that you think NDA and UPA did during their government?'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'name-funny'<br />id: 'sw98x7'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Hindu Worker, Muslim Owner'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Usenamenotfound404'<br />id: 'sw7uy9'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Is UCC good for Hindus?'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'vaibhawc'<br />id: 'sw7np5'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'we should learn Democracy from west bro!! trust their democracy report bro bcz GOri chamdi ( white skin)'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Hunter_Sorry'<br />id: 'sw4ocn'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'What do you feel is the future of stand up comedy in India?
