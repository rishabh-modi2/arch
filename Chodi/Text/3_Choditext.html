<li>Title: 'Brilliant article in OpIndia on Stan Swamy by Mita Nath Bora:his pro-Nazi turned Maoist mentor who preached violence for regime change-Liberation Theology &amp; his anti-Hindu violence espousing letters "come up with militant sections of Dalits &amp; Muslims against Hindutva",which get brushed under by MSM'<br />Body: 'Stan Swamy. Real name Stanislaus Lourduswamy. Many say real surname was Samy but strategically written as Swamy to show more closeness to Hindu in a Hindu majority country and a long term goal to convert Hindus.\n\nHe believed and followed the ideology/principle of the ‚ÄòLiberation theology‚Äô which talks about marxism and historical materialism in theology. Liberation theology believes in the involvement of the revolutionary political process and says ‚Äòonly eliminating private property of the wealth created by human work will we be able to lay down the bases for a more just society.‚Äô  Which, all in all means that the wealth created by hard working people should be taken over even if it means using revolutionary process and tactics.\n\nStan Swamy worked in Philippines, Brazil, ISI-Bangalore before moving to the tribal belt of Jharkhand. His activities varied from conducting protests, demonstrations, liberation theology to Maoism!\n\n**Human rights activist Xavier Dias said that when Swamy studied in the Philippines, there he was acquainted with a series of protests and demonstrations against the administration in the 1970s. He said Swamy, during further studies in Brussels made friends with Brazilian Catholic Archbishop Helder Camara a militant pro Nazi right. Stan Swamy befriended him and got his preaching and induction from Helder Camara ‚Äì**\n\n\nIn 1965, Swamy joined the St Xavier‚Äôs High School Lupungutu, Chaibasa, West Singhbhum in present-day Jharkhand for his regency. Regency is the stage at which trainee Jesuits (Society of Jesus) order undergo in the 3rd-4th year. Jesuit formation, or the training of Jesuits, is slightly different from catholic study. Swamy spent two years taking up one or two works of the order. In the 1970s, he went to Philippines to study theology and Masters in Sociology.\n\n**On his return to Jesuit Jamshedpur Province in 1971, Swamy became director of the Catholic Relief Services charity for the area. He was also the Director of the Jesuit-run Indian Social Institute (ISI), Bangalore from 1975 to 1986. Several publications and books written during his tenure as Director ISI reflect unjustified biased projection of the country and were directed against India. Also a banned outfit like PFI, termed an extremist Islamic organisation, is allowed to hold events and conferences in ISI campus.**\n\nIn Jan 2011, Kerala Police filed a charge sheet against alleged PFI activists in conjunction with an incident in which they severed the hand of a Kerala professor, T. J. Joseph on mere religious differences. It was reported that the attack resulted from the ruling from one of the ‚ÄúTaliban-model‚Äù courts (Darul Khada) operating in Kerala.\n\nIn July 2010, the Kerala Police seized country-made bombs, weapons, CDs and several documents containing Taliban and Al-Qaeda propaganda, from PFI activists.\n\nIn 2012, the Kerala government informed the Kerala High Court, in an affidavit, that Popular Front of India had active involvement in 27 murder cases and that the activities of the Popular Front are inimical to the safety of the country and that it is ‚Äúnothing but a resurrection of the banned outfit Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) in another form‚Äù. The High Court upheld the ban imposed by the State Government\n\nAnd yet in 2019, Indian Social Institute allowed PFI to operate events from its space.\n\nOn 12th October 2019, PFI was allowed to host the ‚ÄúDalit-Muslim Dialogue‚Äù at Indian Social Institute, Bangalore. The programme was attended by the leaders of Popular Front Mohammed Ali Jinnah general secretary, Popular Front, Anis Ahmed, Secretary Popular Front and many more. PFI was allowed to moderate the discussion.\n\n**140 emails were found from Stan Swamy‚Äôs id that brought forth his links with urban naxals. Swamy proposed recruiting people and giving them armed training**\n\n#As per NIA chargesheet, one of the letters written by Stan Swamy himself said, ‚ÄúAn all-India front will not be effective. It shouldn‚Äôt just be used for propaganda against fascist forces on the ground level as it unleashed a major blitzkrieg of offensive campaigns against fascist forces. The front has to come up at village level, small town and cities, neighbourhood level in urban areas with militant sections of people being organised.‚Äù\n\n#‚ÄúFrom the very beginning we should bring together most dalit and muslim forces that are already taking shape in some parts of country. For example, such dalit forces are taking shapre in south ‚Äì Tamil Nadu and Gujrat and muslim minority forces in Kerala, Karnataka and Maharashtra are giving militant and armed attacks on Dalit and religious minority people by the organised Hindutva. They want to take training by going into revolutionary.‚Äù\n\n#The court rejected his bail plea after studying all documents and said ‚Äì The court discarded the plea of his old age observing, ‚ÄúThe collective interest of the community would outweigh the right of personal liberty of the applicant and as such the old age and/or alleged sickness of the applicant would not go in his favour, so that the discretion to release the applicant can be exercised in his favour.‚Äù\n\n#Special judge DE Kothalikar said while rejecting the bail -‚ÄúThe material placed on record thus prima facie denotes that the applicant was not only the member of banned organisation Communist Party of India (Maoist) but he was carrying out activities further in the objective of the organisation which is nothing but to overthrow the democracy of the nation.‚Äù \n\nThe evidences gathered against him point out that Stan Swamy was on a mission not only to convert indigenous Hindu tribals of India to Christianity but in a more dangerous conversion, that off converting this blessed Hindu land into a militant land. Helping and fighting for the tribal was just an overt show, a show set to conduct dangerous operations covertly, behind the visibility of normal common citizen.\n\n#Agenda 1 ‚ÄìOvert Agenda‚Äì Convert tribals to Christianity during his stay in Jharkhand. Set up Churches in tribal areas.\n\n#Agenda 2- Covert Agenda ‚Äì To recruit tribals for maoist terrorism and to keep the land of Hindus always in turmoil, in war state.\n\n#Agenda 3 ‚Äì To dethrone any govt of India that does not tow the line of the Church, Christian, and Communist thinking.\n\nAs per NIA report Stan Swamy was a member of banned organisation Communist Party of India (Maoist) and he was carrying out activities further in the objective of the organisation which has been trying and carrying out activities to overthrow the democracy of the nation. His organisation ‚Äúhatched a serious conspiracy to create unrest in the entire country and to overpower the government.‚Äù\n\nThe NIA charge-sheet named Stan Swamy as a member of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) and was involved in a conspiracy to instigate caste violence in the Bhima Koregaon incident on January 1, 2018.\n\n**In 2018, the Bombay High Court has said that the Elgar Parishad-Koregaon Bhima violence was a ‚Äúdeep-rooted‚Äù conspiracy which had ‚Äúextremely serious repercussions‚Äù. The observation was made by a division bench of Justices B P Dharmadhikari and S V Kotwal. These were based on the sufficient material evidences found against the accused.**\n\n**Stan Swamy was in communication with CPI-Maoist cadre Comrade Arun. He communicated that after the arrest of urban CPI-Maoist cadres from different parts of the country, particularly Maharashtra, a huge irrevocable damage has been caused to the party.**\n\n**Stan Swamy received Rs 8 lakh through one Comrade Mohan for furtherance of the CPI-Maoist activities. He is the convener of Persecuted Prisoners Solidarity Committee (PPSC) frontal organisation of the CPI-Maoists.**\n\nStan Swamy planned to prepare a front to take on the Modi government through the means of armed militia.\n\n**The documents recovered from Stan Swamy are related to the literature of 50 years of Naxalbari, CPI-Maoist press releases, circular issued by the central committee (CC), literature on how to smuggle things (sneak it through smuggling made easier), letter to Stan Swamy from one Prashant, letter to Vijayan Dada from Stan Swamy regarding mobilising of Adivasi and regarding concerns raised by CC, guide of encrypted data communication on GSM network, message on the celebration of the 13th anniversary of CPI-Maoist, an essential underground handbook, letter between comrades for using encryption, mini-manual of urban guerilla, the Constitution of CPI-Maoist, documents related to the status of PLGA in excel sheet, document on strategy and tactics of Indian revolution.**\n\n**The letter instructed that all SC leaders to work with ‚Äúthe principle of no rest, no negligence and no mercy‚Äù and to do everything possible to ‚Äúdisrupt the fake development propaganda disseminated by star campaigners of BJP-RSS corporate friendly family‚Äù. ‚ÄúOur aim should be to stop them from making inroads into tribal masses and lower middle-class population.‚Äù** \n\n**On international front in the absence of Rona Wilson and Sai Baba, there has been major disruption in communicating with international Maoist parties. It said Sri Lanka and Nepal operations are also impacted. ‚ÄúKeeping all these necessities in view the Central committee has directed one comrade to assume the responsibility of international coordination of solidarity programmes and making arrangements for bilateral delegations.**But please ensure both are sufficiently trained in order to understand sensitive aspects of technical security.‚Äù\n\n**There is also discussion about avoiding the name of the ‚Äúanti-fascist‚Äù front as it would turn negative appeal to public. The NIA says there is a clear mention about giving such responsibility to accused Sudhir Dhawale along with monetary support is found mentioned in a letter from Com M (wanted accused Milind Teltumbde) to accused Ron Wilson.**\n\nKnow the mentor of Stan Swamy: Helder Camara\n\n#Mentor Helder Camara- In one his document its clearly written ‚Äì  If by chance it were not possible to accomplish this subversive plan through normal means, the professor from the Seminary in Recife considered the recourse to arms  legitimate, in order to establish manu military, the regime he had theorised.\n\nIn the Corrispondenza Romana it is written such ‚Äì **there are few who know this, but Helder Camara began his public life as a militant in the pro-Nazi right. He was in fact, a party official of the Acao Integralista Brasileira (AIB), the pro-Nazi movement founded by Plinio Salgado. In 1934, the then Father Camara became part of the Supreme Council of the AIB. Two years later he was Salgado‚Äôs personal secretary, and thus the national Secretary of the AIB, a leading figure who took part in meetings and paramilitary  marches that aped the Nazis in Germany. His pro-Nazi convictions were so deep that he was ordained a priest wearing the integralist militia‚Äôs uniform under his cassock ‚Äì the ill-famed ‚Äúgreen shirt‚Äù.**\n\n**In 1968 when the Brazilian writer Otto Engel wrote a biography about Helder Camara, he received ‚Äúsummary orders‚Äù from the Olinda-Recife Curia which warned him not to publish it. The Archbishop didn‚Äôt want his pro-Nazi past being made known.**\n\n**Helder Camara moved onto hailing Mao Tse-Tung‚Äôs China, at that time in full ‚Äúcultural revolution‚Äù, causing the death of millions. The Red Archbishop formally requested the admission of Communist China to the United Nations with the consequent expulsion of Taiwan. He finished his intervention with an appeal in favour of the Cuban Dictator, Fidel Castro, at that time busy sustaining bloody guerrilla warfare in Latin America.** He also asked for Cuba to be re-admitted to the OEA (the Organization of the American States) from which it had been expelled in 1962.\n\nHowever, perhaps the episode that aroused the most astonishment was the so-called ‚ÄúComblin affair‚Äù.\n\n**In June 1968 a bomb of a document was leaked out to the Brazilian newspapers, prepared under the auspices of Archbishop Helder Camara, by the Belgian priest Joseph Comblin, professor at the Theological Institute (Seminary) of Recife. The document proposed, without veils, a subversive plan to dismantle the State and establish a ‚Äúdictatorship of the people‚Äù of a Communist matrix.**\n\n**He sang praises of some of the bloodiest dictatorships that constellated  the 20th century; first Nazism, and then Communism in all of its variants: Soviet, Cuban, Chinese.**\n\n**In his famous interview with Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci, he also stated that, despite his support for non-violence, he didn‚Äôt oppose violent tactics: ‚ÄúAnd I respect a lot of priests with rifles on their shoulders; I never said that to use weapons against an oppressor is immoral or anti-Christian.** But that‚Äôs not my choice, not my road, not my way to apply the Gospels‚Äù.\n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2021/08/who-was-stan-swamy-man-on-a-mission-to-endanger-india/'<br />Author: 'StarsAtLadakh'<br />id: 'ovwzfn'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

And what embarassment? Why do u care what the west even thinks? Who gives a shit if Americans think we are vegetarian go mutra drinking idiots, whilst ISIS proudly flaunt their hijab? \n\nEven sabarimalai incident, seculars got triggered cus women weren\'t allowed, but they never question the fact that a woman can never become a pope or priest (only nun as assistants to the male father) or women aren\'t allowed inside mosques.\n\nSecular Hindus are cancer. I know Muslims and Christians who follow their religion and accept it\'s sexist. Meanwhile these seculars are getting embarrassed about what the west might think.'<br />Author: 'saddropoutthrowaway'<br />id: 'ov97n3'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

<li>Title: '[Freebie] A free potted indoor plant (Goodluck Jade aka elephant bush)'<br />Body: "Let me just preface this post by telling you that this is **not** an advertisement, clickbait, or affiliate marketing, or a money-making scheme of any sort. This is an genuine post for those who love having potted indoor plants such as myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What is this about?** \n\nA nursery website based off in India called Nurserylive is giving out 5 free potted indoor plants (3 flowering and  2 non-flowering). I believe this is a marketing strategy of theirs to get more traffic on to their website\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What is the catch?**\n\nOf course, nothing is free. Here's the catch I could find:\n\n1) You get **ONE** free plant (Goodluck Jade) **upon signing up to their website**. After signing up you are given a referral link. The more referrals you get (max req is 10) the more plants you get (max 5 plants).\n\n2) Only the plant is free. The shipment has to be paid. The shipment cost is around 70 Rs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to avail the offer?** \n\n**Note: Today (31/7/21) is the last day**\n\nYou can do this by directly visiting their website or consider using my referral link: [https://rfer.al/qPksS\\_hxqPsmQ](https://rfer.al/qPksS_hxqPsmQ)\n\nNote: **The link above is a shameless plug.** It is **not** necessary to use the link. Visit the website directly, you can still get the offer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI personally feel this is a good deal for someone with a green thumb. Also, the community can help each other get more plants. With everyone working from home it would be good to have plants around you in your work environment."<br />Author: 'Nikolus_Hill'<br />id: 'ov6wyd'<br />Flair :Wholesome Bakchodi :danklaugh:</li>

Moreover, Varadarajan is also a member of the core group of South Asia Media Defenders Network (SAMDEN), which is a part of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative.\n\n&gt;CHRI had received Rs. 2,29,500 on the 20th of September, 2019 from the United States‚Äô Department of State for the purpose of ‚ÄúAdvocacy and Outreach Programme for Detainees in the North Eastern States of India‚Äù. The CHRI has also received huge amounts of money from the Oak Foundation, a shady globalist organization, among others.\n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2021/07/why-left-media-and-their-hitjobs-against-india-are-a-part-of-a-global-conspiracy/\n\nWikileaks exposes in 2011 the US cables talking of US govt "should continue to cultivate" Mamata.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/nyv0ru/old_news_but_thought_to_replug_anyways_wikileaks/\n\nForbidden Stories, Amnesty, Citizens\'s Labs &amp; their respective fundings by Soros &amp; Omidyar (who also fund Wire/Scroll. etc)\n\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/vijaygajera/status/1418574474119565313\n\nFirst we come to Forbidden Stories. FS was launched by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and Freedom Voices Network. RSF the organisation behind primary index for deciding press freedom in each country is primarily funded by US,EU &amp; Soros,Omidyar-(also funding AltNews/Wire). Accused of propaganda for US-led regime change in LatAm &amp; Middle-East &amp; whitewashing censorings by US-approved regimes. Last they were in news in India for speaking against FIR on Zubair Mohammed of AltNews for spreading fake news with intent to provoke communal tension- in the case where a Muslim was beaten by other Muslims &amp; Zubair had claimed he was beaten because he refused to say Jai Shri Ram.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/offzxu/rsforg_behind_primary_index_for_deciding_press/\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/o3h8h0/how_the_world_press_freedom_index_was_politicized/\n\nIn the past, the RSF has funded media organisations that produce regime change propaganda against Syria and its president Bashar al-Assad. RSF itself receives funding from the US Government.\n\n&gt;Another donor of FS is Limelight Foundation (LF). The LF funds numerous organisations. One of the prominent among them is Bellingcat, a media initiative that produces propaganda that seeks to legitimize the West‚Äôs illegal war against Syria.\n\n&gt;Bellingcat has extensive ties to NATO, as reported by The Grayzone, and has cooperated with United Kingdom‚Äôs efforts to ‚Äúweaken Russia‚Äù. In addition, it also receives grants from the National Endowment for Democracy, which in turn is a US Government funded project.\n\n&gt;Omidyar channels its donations to FS via Luminate which is a bigger umbrella of NGO funding for furthering US strategic goals than even OSF of Soros. For example: Luminate donated to the Sundance Institute for producing films ‚Äúused strategically to articulate pressing public issues and movement-building campaigns.‚Äù The Grayzone report states, ‚ÄúAmong the films cited by Omidyar‚Äôs Luminate as a strategic success was The Last Men in Aleppo, an Oscar-nominated propaganda vehicle for the Syrian White Helmets that was produced by the Sundance Institute.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe White Helmets are a Syrian insurgent-aligned ‚Äúcivil rescue‚Äù group founded in Turkey by a British former military intelligence officer. Operating exclusively in rebel-held territory, including in the al Qaeda-controlled Idlib province, the White Helmets have been funded by USAID, the U.K. Foreign Office and the Qatari monarchy.‚Äù \n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2021/07/project-pegasus-snoopgate-explained-wire-guardian-soros-us-government/\n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2021/07/forbidden-stories-pegasus-links-us-regime-change-propaganda-luminate-george-soros-omidyar/\n\n\nFurthermore, Luminate was run by Ben Scott, an Obama Administration official who has also worked in Hillary Clinton‚Äôs State Department. Speaking of Hilary &amp; NGOs &amp; Hilary\'s NGOs in civil war torn areas, this essay by Julian Assagne is a must read.\n\nhttps://wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems/\n\nOmidyar also funds in India in Scroll, Caravan and the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN)\n\n&gt;FS also proudly displayed the endorsement by Mediapart‚Äôs Head of Investigations Fabrice Afri on its website until recently. Mediapart is the same leftist French organisation that has been peddling propaganda over the Rafale deal. \n\nAmnesty International\n\n&gt;Amnesty is known to have links to the British Government and was accused of having links to the Taliban. In 2020, Amnesty was forced to shut shop in India after its accounts were frozen by the Indian Government.\n\nAmnesty again gets funds from Soros, Omidyar, Ford &amp; Rockefeller foundations-last two confirmed to be functioning as foreign policy arms of CIA since cold war era. \n\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/vijaygajera/status/1418574523150966787\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/op8nmj/antimodi_article_in_mit_fechnology_review_by/\n\n*If you have time to read even a single link, I would urge you to read the link above. It eluciates how from the era of 1930s, how US came to be a nation whose policies, particularly foreign policies, were determined by the plutocrats, for the plutocrats. And the means of determination would come to be the plutocratic &amp; corporate funds featuring swivelling doors with CIA with CIA donating its officials for these megafunds and the megafunds donating money and a respectable, non-hostile channel for achieving CIA\'s foreign policy objectives.*\n\nIn words of the most acclaimed book globally on ColdWar "Cultural Cold War":\n\n&gt;The use of philanthropic foundations was the most convenient way to pass large sums of money to Agency projects without alerting the recipients to their source. 1952 Congress committee appointed to investigate US foundations concluded that ‚ÄòAn unparalleled amount of power is concentrated increasingly in the hands of an interlocking and self-perpetuating group. Unlike the power of corporate management, it is unchecked by stockholders; unlike the power of government, it is unchecked by the people; unlike the power of the churches, it is unchecked by any firmly established canons of value.‚Äô\n\n&gt;**‚ÄòBona fide‚Äô foundations such as Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie were considered ‚Äòthe best and most plausible kind of funding cover‚Äô. A CIA study of 1966 argued that this technique was ‚Äòparticularly effective for democratically run membership organizations,** which need to assure their own unwitting members and collaborators, as well as their hostile critics, that they have genuine, respectable, private sources of income‚Äô. Certainly, it allowed the CIA to fund ‚Äòa seemingly limitless range of covert action programs affecting youth groups, labor unions, universities, publishing houses, and other private institutions‚Äô from the early 1950s.\n\n&gt;The system of private patronage was the pre-eminent model of how small, homogenous groups came to defend America‚Äôs ‚Äì and, by definition, their own ‚Äìinterests. Serving at the top of the pile was every self-respecting WASP‚Äôs ambition. The prize was a trusteeship on either the Ford Foundation or the Rockefeller Foundation, both of which were conscious instruments of covert US foreign policy, with directors and officers who were closely connected to, or even members of American intelligence.\n\nComing back  to third collaborator of Pegasus controversy:\n\n&gt;Citizens Lab is a project by the Canadian government. Citizen Lab is a research lab based in Munk School, which, is based in the University of Toronto. Open Society Foundation (George Soros), International Development Research Centre (government of Canada- same Canadian govt which is also backing Khalistanis- is heavily invested in IRDC and in turn, in Citizens Lab), HIVOS (This organization is intricately linked to George Soros‚Äô Open Society Foundation and receives funds from various international governments) and many more organisations were seen involved in Citizens Lab.\n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2021/07/project-pegasus-snoopgate-explained-wire-guardian-soros-us-government/\n\nThis thread by Vijay Patel encapsulates how Soros &amp; Omidyar have their fingers in the pie of the "truth to power" Indian media.\n\n&gt;Scroll: it is registered in the USA. Gets Funds directly from Omidyar group and indirectly from Soros and Omidyar via another NGO MDIF. MDIF is funded by Soros and Omidyar network(Luminate) \n\n&gt;MDIF also funds The News Minute and Boom Live in India. So they are getting indirect funds from Soros and Omidyar.This MDIF and OFS are banned in Russia for this type of funding to propaganda makers.\n\n&gt;Newslaundry: They have a direct investment of Omidyar group via their Mauritius branch ON Mauritius.Founder of Newslaundry Shekri was also Founder of NGO PCRF in which Kejriwal and Sisodia were also partners. \n\n&gt;PCRF received its first fund by Kejariwals price money of Magsaysay Award. Magsaysay award is created and funded by the same Rockefeller brothers fund- as mentioned earlier foreign policy arm of CIA &amp; also funds Amnesty. In 2005 and 2008 another NGO of Kejriwal and Sisodia \'Kabir\' had received funds from Ford Foundation.In 1994 there was an NGO \'FDL-AP\'. This NGO has one goal \' Free Kashmir\' with some other Asian goals.This NGO was Funded by the same Soros. But the most shocking fact was that Sonia Gandhi was Co-President of this NGO\n\nhttps://threader.app/thread/1418574474119565313\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/137AqSIsVl18y8Qq05wl3rSfvqyHpAxzh/view\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20210726125022/https://threader.app/thread/1418574474119565313\n\n#In short- the "snooping" was claimed by orgs funded by Soros, Omidyar &amp; US &amp; Canada govts.

Rise of Low Quality Posts: There used to be time when we had high quality  and well researched posts on dharmic and political topics which helped others widen their grasp on the current state of things in Bharat.  \nHowever, with time the quality has gone down and OC\'s are not appreciated the way they should be. All you\'ll see is twitter screenshots, so in short another WhatsApp.   \n\n2. Advent of Raitas: Now in no way I\'m shitting on so called raitas but the lack of knowledge of your own scriptures and what they preach is showing. You seek validation from west and goras, Pathetic.  \nAnything that they don\'t like about Hinduism be it ICM or Varna Vyvastha is either called regressive or a distortion by Brits.   \nWake the fuck up, not everything that doesn\'t meets today\'s societal standards is a distortion.  \n\n3. Ultra Trads and Hyper Hindus: Whatever number of "TRADS" we have here either just shit on people or hate on the current political system without being helpful to others. It looks like as if all they do is shit on people. Make use of Knowledge, write informative posts about dharma and help others in their dharmic endeavors.\n4. Hero Worship and Obvious Ignorance of many Failures of Modi and his govt: This man got 303 seats from us and even then he chimps out, the frequency of which has only gone up. His own workers are getting killed, his voter base is being shot at in the states you rule and what you do? You go on Dharna.  \nModi did good work, helped in the rise of Hindu narrative and everything but his failures should be acknowledge and critiqued just the way he is praised.   \n\n\nThese are some random thoughts I have tried put together, feel free to call out if I\'m wrong somewhere.   \nThanks.'<br />Author: '24x7redt'<br />id: 'ortv1l'<br />Flair :Magga Balti Vichar :Shwr:</li>

<li>Title: 'How to Support Gita Press: Gift Gita Press Books to Relatives'<br />Body: "Gita Press is the world's largest publisher of Hindu religious texts running from 1923. Since its establishment, the Gita Press has published approximately 410 million copies of the Gita (in different editions) and 70.0 million copies of the Ramcharitamanas, at subsidized prices. For some years, it has been facing financial issues. \n\nI guess we can help Gita Press at personal level. What I suggest is that whenever we visit our relatives who are of older age, we should gift them Gita Press Books. Gita Press stalls are available in Railway Stations and also in city areas everywhere. They wrap the book beautifully in a decorative cloth also. \n\nI recently bought five Gita Press Books  - Shiv Puran and Bhagwat Gita and my parents will gift them to various relatives. This is the least we can do to make our uncles, aunts and even older relatives feel special and also help Gita Press."<br />Author: 'ranjan_zehereela2014'<br />id: 'or8426'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm üïâÔ∏è</li>

<li>Title: 'The UP population control is disaster. I hope better sense prevails and Yogiji trashes the bill in the bin'<br />Body: "1. Election is next year and bringing such a controversial bill months before the election makes no sense.\n\n2. The bill is based on the paradigm of incentivizing fewer children by no govt sops for families with larger children- like no govt jobs and no right to contest elections. Well, this is only going to affect Hindus because the community-legal-NGO network power of minorities is so strong that not only they managed to settle lakhs of Rohingyas in Jammu, where even other Indians can't settle, but the Rohingyas are actually flourishing there. Not to mention the network for settling lakhs of Bangladeshi immigrants in India, the network not only successfully trafficked and settled them but also provides them with fake Aadhar card and other ID cards to ensure they get all government benefits. Not just mosques and groups like Dawat e Islami are involved in this fake certification, but even NGOs like that of Teesta Setalvad who were caught creating fake certificates for Bangladeshi Muslims during Assam NRC. And this network is carrying on its activities across India-from Delhi to Mumbai to Dehradun to Bangalore to Hyderabad to Kerala. Swati Goel of Swarajya has highlighted multiple non Hindu individuals using fake documents to contest elections from scheduled caste reserved seats. In most such cases, when the activist informs the local police and legal authorities of the deception, they refuse to act because of strong community clout of the minority groups and the informal network of minority religious leaders and law authorities via politicians and mafia. In many cases even judges have stalled on scrapping scheduled caste certificate of the non Hindu people and scrapping the election results contested with forged documents. In one recent case in UP, the police and judge kept demanding more proof of the previously scheduled caste woman having converted, even after being presented her nikahnama, multiple testimonies of people and her election campaign in burkha. If the minority groups actually have enough clout to openly encroach on rights of scheduled castes via fake certificates, openly take govt amenities for non Infians from Bangladesh via fake IDs, how much hindrance will this bill actually pose to non Hindu families with dozens of children from getting govt benefits? The only population that will be impacted and further neutered will be Hindus.\n\n3. It pushes for single children by special sops for families with single children. We saw what a disaster single child policy was in China. Moreover it also incentivizes single children in well-to-do families by promising government jobs.

They seem to be benefitting more and trying to trap him.\n\nHis movies are amazing, see Lagaan, Mangal Panday, Rand de basanti where you are how the separatist behaviour of muslims are also criticised while showing how patriotic the so called radical hindu is.\n\nI think we are doing a mistake by treating him like this. He as a professional movie maker has done more towards promotion of hindu and indian culture than 90% of the Hindu movie makers ."<br />Author: 'throwRA_SheIsBack'<br />id: 'odphjh'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Help my Mom fight Ovarian Cancer'<br />Body: "Hello everyone, I'm writing this post with a heavy heart. A week back my Mom was diagnosed with Ovarian cancer.\xa0 My Mom is the strongest woman know, who has faced numerous hardships in her life, but watching her go through such pain now is gut wrenching. \n\nMy Mom is a educator, she has devoted 38 years of her life to teach the young. She always told me that her job saved her life, when I was young I didn't think much of it. As I gained life experience, I understood what she actually meant by it. \n\nMy parents separated when I was in the 4th grade, my sister was away in boarding school for the pyshically challenged. Mom was burdened with our care. With house chores, her job and taking care of my short comings she never got the time to take care of herself.\xa0 My father was a normal man, abusive towards my Mom, sister and me, whenever he had alot on his mind. He would never share what's going on with him. I don't blame him though, even he has suffered alot in his life and still does. \n\nThe silver lining of this situation was our Mom's and Dad's side of the family, with whom we had minimum contact. They came together to express emotional and financial support. But, the resources they were able to pool together was not enough to complete the required treatment. To help my Mom, I've created a fundraiser through Ketto. \n\nI kindly request all of you to help as much as you can, Please share this among your friends and family. \n\nThank you.\n\nLink for the fundraiser: https://www.ketto.org/fundraiser/my-mother-is-fighting-for-her-life-and-we-need-your-support-to-save-her-447172?utm_source=external_ct&amp;utm_medium=whatsapp&amp;utm_Campaign=sm_campaigner_sac_w4"<br />Author: 'PantsyrSAM'<br />id: 'ocu4kc'<br />Flair ::oc-: OC ‡§π‡•à BC!üí°</li>

What if all these years the things they told us about what our Tricolour represents was all wrong.\n\n  \nYou know how they denote Saffron stands for sacrifice/strength, White stands for peace, and Green stands for fertile lands. We can skip the Ashoka Chakra's significance for this context.  \n\n\nWhat if Saffron stood for Hindus, White stood for Rice Bags and Green stood for the globally-hated-self-proclaiming-peacefool-cult. I believe they twisted the fact about the tricolour all these years. They wanted to show that India belongs to these 3 religions, which is an unfair depiction in my opinion, because India was the land of Hindus before these 2 religions entered the land. But since they couldn't outright tell that the land belongs to 3 religious groups they came up with the notion of Strength, Peace and Fertile lands.  \n\n\nThis is just something the voice inside me pointed out.

<li>Title: "I saw a documentary about rapes in Islamic nations like Bangladesh. Man women in India live with dignity and have it safe and it's up to Hindus and Hindu women to defend this freedom because some of the stuff I heard from Muslim men and Imams in this documentary is beyond messed up"<br />Body: "I am convinced that these people are brain washed beyond any hope. The Imams says it's women's fault for getting raped. He says that a women needs to cover herself if she doesn't want to get raped. The dude goes on to say that if a women is not covered up and then a man will catch her eyes and than do nasty things with her because he can't control his desire. Like WTF.\n\nWhat is more messed up is that males don't feel guilty and the police are brainwashed too and conditioned that way. I see such behaviour in Muslim dominated areas in India too. They feel embolden in raping girls and then forcefully concert them to protect their dignity. Women are literally thought of as objects of pleasure and it just gave me chills that there are people like that. \n\nLink to the documentary. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/XY7QOlqirns"<br />Author: 'Legionoo7'<br />id: 'oaa8fg'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Our overconfidence did failed us in bengal and we got miserably beaten and are still oppressed even today.\n\nLooking at kishor\'s track record he definetely has firm grips in strategy making. These people are onboarding him and hes delivering the results (bihar , MH, WB).\n\nSharad pawar was debarred from becoming PM by sonia so now this is his chance to go no holds barred and lifetime dream with or without congress by his side, even if he loses. His time is pretty much over and hes lived his life so he doesnt care much. Its all fun and game ...kinda another trophy for him. Even other members like mamta , tamilans etc will agree for him being the pm candidate as he has developed the relations from long time with them.\n\nI wonder what BJP and mota bhai will bring to the table. Somewhere around mota bhai has got overrated , hes a man of action definetely but recently in strategy making hes missing out unfortunaltely. Though BJP has a big election machinery with them public sentiments are very against them currently.\n\nI think BJP is changing its gears and being result oriented (atleast as of now)  rather than defence oriented to opposition ( recent vaccine policy and the vaccine drive throttling ). They really need to put up big things on table with crystal clarity (not like CAA where things were lost in smoke and opp took the chance of false information spread). \n\nLast not least, after asking a lot of contacts and known peoples ( a small survey üòâ ). At core People do believe that modi is best for a secure nation but  are angry,dissapointed and looking for options for "if not him" , which they dont see anyone anywhere close yet coz of their daily lives has been impacted greatly... Petrol , cooking oil , gst and lack of money.

By thy speech I infer thee to be highly intelligent.\n\nYudhishthira said, \n\n&gt;\'O foremost of serpents, he, it is asserted by the wise, in whom are seen truth, charity, forgiveness, good conduct, benevolence, observance of the rites of his order and mercy is a Brahmana. And, O serpent, that which should be known is even the supreme Brahma, in which is neither happiness nor misery--and attaining which beings are not affected with misery; what is thy opinion?\'"\n\nThe serpent said, \n\n&gt;\'O Yudhishthira, truth, charity, forgiveness, benevolence, benignity, kindness and the Veda which worketh the benefit of the four orders, which is the authority in matters of religion and which is true, are seen even in the Sudra. As regards the object to be known and which thou allegest is without both happiness and misery, I do not see any such that is devoid of these.\'\n\nYudhishthira said, \n\n&gt;Those characteristics that are present in a Sudra, do not exist in a Brahmana; nor do those that are in a Brahmana exist in a Sudra. And a Sudra is not a Sudra by birth alone--nor a Brahmana is Brahmana by birth alone. He, it is said by the wise, in whom are seen those virtues is a Brahmana. And people term him a Sudra in whom those qualities do not exist, even though he be a Brahmana by birth. And again, as for thy assertion that the object to be known (as asserted by me) doth not exist, because nothing exists that is devoid of both (happiness and misery), such indeed is the opinion, O serpent, that nothing exists that is without (them) both. But as in cold, heat doth not exist, nor in heat, cold, so there cannot exist an object in which both (happiness and misery) cannot exist?\n\nThe serpent said, \n\n&gt;\'O king, if thou recognise him as a Brahmana by characteristics, then, O long-lived one, the distinction of caste becometh futile as long as conduct doth not come into play.\'"\n\nYudhishthira said, \n\n&gt;\'In human society, O mighty and highly intelligent serpent, it is difficult to ascertain one\'s caste, because of promiscuous intercourse among the four orders. This is my opinion.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Men belonging to all orders (promiscuously) beget offspring upon women of all the orders. And of men, speech, sexual intercourse, birth and death are common. And to this the Rishis have borne testimony by using as the beginning of a sacrifice such expressions as--of what caste so ever we may be, we celebrate the sacrifice.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Therefore, those that are wise have asserted that character is the chief essential requisite. The natal ceremony of a person is performed before division of the umbilical cord. His mother then acts as its Savitri and his father officiates as priest. He is considered as a Sudra as long as he is not initiated in the Vedas.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Doubts having arisen on this point, O prince; of serpents, Swayambhuba Manu has declared, that the mixed castes are to be regarded as better than the (other) classes, if having gone through the ceremonies of purification, the latter do not conform to the rules of good conduct, O excellent snake! Whosoever now conforms to the rules of pure and virtuous conduct, him have I, ere now, designated as a Brahmana."\n\nTo this Nahusha is impressed and replies,\n\n&gt;"The serpent replied, \'O Yudhishthira, thou art acquainted with all that is fit to be known"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now that you\'ve all read that, can we stop with this pointless, archaic concept already? It was already obsolete during Yudhishtira\'s time. It\'s been thousands of years since then. \n\nDoes anybody have any clue or way we can oppose this birth-based system of determining varna?

Which is being made bigger by opposition and the ruling govt."<br />Body: "Let's be honest we're still overly depended on China. Add to that our country is still an argarian society and when Modi tried to corporatatize the farming sector you see what happened.\n\nRecently the shipping prices have literally Mooned. It used to cost $2300 to book a standard TEU container. Now it cost $10000-$12000 dollar that is an insane price jump. All of this adds to the pricing of goods and companies usually like to pass these on to customers. In India it's worst because not only do we not have subsidies for industries. There is crazy taxing schemes for everything. Now comes the part where the ruling party and even the opposition do stupid shit which just ends up destroying everything. Ruling party in a bid to stay in power artificially tries to lower prices of goods by reducing taxes or letting go of taxes. But this just doesn't solve it so what do they do start giving out freebies. From loans to homes to what not. Opposition in its bid also tries to make the already fucked up situation more worst by staging protest and dharna telling people how inflation is sky rocketing and the govt doesn't care. When the problem is not even govt. Control.\n\n\nNow comes the more scary aspect especially in Indian context. With Raw materials prices going up, inefficient labour and sky high labour cost most MSME can't survive. Example I can relate to is my uncle. He runs a small factory that mfg. Injections for vaccines and plastic container. The cost of raw materials is high, labour cost for him per day is 500 rupee per person + food. Additionally the labour workers are inefficient as they keep taking frequent breaks leading to low output. Which just puts more burden on the overall operating cost. So, my uncle has to charge more money to even make 1-2% profit. This just makes him uncompetitive in front of chinese goodz which have a high output and low cost of goods. Multiply this with all industry and we have a fucking problem.\n\nThe problem gets more messed up as labourers don't even care because they get free ration, free accommodation and they just threaten to vote for opposite party if they are not given what they want. Which is free money without any work.  In my uncle's case the labourers just blow the money on booze and sometimes don't even show up to work. But with shortage of labour workers it extremely hard to.remain in business. \n\n\nSo, we're heading for a massive economic chutiyapa if something is not done ASAP. Both opposition and ruling govt need to make rules clear. Efficiency, productivity is the only way forward for prosperity or else we're fucked."<br />Author: 'Legionoo7'<br />id: 'o483pu'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: '[SPOILERS AHEAD IF YOU WATCH MARATHI MOVIES]'<br />Body: 'Yesterday I was watching a movie called Anandi Gopal which is based on the life of Anandi Gopal, the first Indian female doctor. A sequence of that movie really shook me.\n\nThe story is set in 1878. The premise of the movie is that there is a young girl called Anandi Gopal who is married to a man called Gopalrao at the age of 14 years. Gopalrao is an educated person and he wants his wife to be a doctor at any cost. Anandi is a very talented girl she reads a lots of books and without any formal primary eduation, she is far more wise than any other girl in her village. Her husband manages to get her admitted in a missionary school run by the britishers. She is not treated very well in that college, the British girls there teas her for her appearance and skin colour but she still manages to make an identity of her in the school due to her knowledge. Further the villagers and the panchayat boycott Gopalrao and his wife saying that the hindu religion does not allow the women to be educated and that Gopalrao is committing a shameful sin by making his wife to go to a christian college. Gopalrao initially ignores people boycotting her but later when the tensions intensify, he decides to send his wife to America for her further studies. A consultant of him advices that in order ro go to America he needs to change his religion and Accept christianity. Gopalrao, a brahmin agrees to accept christianity and takes his wife to a church.\n\nThis was the moment I thought that the movie is yet another liberal product that tells people that Hindu religion must be given up to be a successful person in life but here comes the twist, when the father tells Anandi to remove her mangalsutra, she refuses and run away from the Church saying that the only thing that  has made her capable of being what she is today is her religion, she\'d never give up her religion at any cost. She says, "Jis desh ko mera dharm manya nahi, voh desh mujhe manya nahi." However later Anandi Gopal goes to America and ends up being a doctor without changing a religion.\n\nI mentioned this movie especially because what bollywood is showing is today in the name of feminism is "Veere di Wedding" and "Four more shots please" movies that say that only way a women can express the feminism inside her is by drinking beer and swearing men. In this era, Anandi Gopal is a masterpiece movie that promotes the true sense of Feminism without disrespecting our culture and religion.\n\nHighly recommended...'<br />Author: '_its_krits_'<br />id: 'o3v036'<br />Flair :DawoodWood (Entertainment) üé•</li>
