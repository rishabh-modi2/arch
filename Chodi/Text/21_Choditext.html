<li>Title: "It's very difficult to convert a liberal/secular to nationalism."<br />Body: 'Tried converting a communist supporter from Kerala by having some conversation. Here are some highlights.\n\n* She defended the KP genocide by saying it was the fault of the government and not that of Kashmiri Muslims.\n* When I showed her GemsofBollywood Twitter handle, she said what the Muslims did was justified because they constitute the majority in the industry. She said anti-Hindu content is justified because it is the fault of the Hindus that they did not get involved in the industry on a large scale.\n* She said I was brainwashed when I brought her attention to things that are happening in coastal Andhra and Nooh, Haryana. As per her, Hindus have never been under threat for the last 70 years. She denied that even after I presented her with evidence of Muslim riots against Hindus.\n* As per her, there has been no communal violence in Kerala to date, she is silent when I showed her instances when Muslims had in fact attacked Hindus in Kerala.\n\nHence, converting a secular is a difficult and near impossible process. To the randians who are reading this and laughing. Laugh all you want, but I am not going to give up. \n\nI am gonna keep trying till I succeed. Secularism is a drug and getting saffronpilled is the rehab.

<li>Title: 'Reincarnation in Hinduism [My Thoughts]'<br />Body: 'One of the most popular theory in Hinduism is Reincarnation of Soul and it\'s so much popular that even non Hindus believe it\n25% of Americans believe in Reincarnation even though bible doesn\'t have any concept of it.\n\nWhen i start reading Upanishads i always thought how is it even possible mainly because in most of the Hindu sacred texts it\'s clearly written that there is no individual soul like in Christianity and Islam\nIn Hinduism there is a single cosmic soul called Atman.\n\nThere are multiple verses in multiple Upanishads here are some examples\n\n&gt;The wise man beholds all beings in the self and the self in all beings; for that reason, he does not hate anyone. ‚Äì Isha Upanishad\n\n&gt;He who perceives all beings in the self alone, and the self in all beings, does not entertain any hatred on account of that perception. ‚Äì Ishavasya Upanishad\n\n&gt;That which is consciousness alone which is all-pervading, which is eternal, which is all-full, which is of the form of bliss and which is indestructible, is the only true brahman (infinite consciousness). ‚Äì Varaha Upanishad\n\n&gt;These (sixteen names) destroy the Avarana (or the centripetal force which produces the sense of individuality) of Jiva surrounded by the sixteen Kalas (rays).  - Kali-Santarana Upanishad\n\n&gt;By mistaking the self to be the individual soul,\nas a rope for a serpent, one is subject to fear.\nBut if he realises, "I am not the individual soul,\nbut the Supreme Self," then he is free from fear. - Atmabodha\n\nThe Kali Santarana Upanishad literally tell us to break the thought of individuality \n\nIn Bhagwad Gita Shree Krishna said it doesn\'t even matter if you think soul exist or not (individual soul lives forever or die)\n\n&gt;BG 2:26 - If, however, you think that the soul is perpetually born and always dies, still you have no reason to lament, O mighty-armed arjuna.\n\nSo one thing is clear that there is no individual soul but a single cosmic soul.\n\nSo how is it possible for reincarnation?\n\nIn Abrahamic Religion people bury the Dead because they believe that one day there will be a judgement of God and everyone will wake up from the coffin\nthatswhy they protect the body and bury it \n\nHowever in Hinduism we cremate the body because we want the body to be fully decompose and spread to the environment because the ashes of the body will get mixed with soil where trees, bacteria, food grow and technical you became that tree or bacteria or that food which others will eat and you become part of them the water in your body will be evaporated and get mixed in atmosphere which get back in form of rain and the cycle continues\n\n\n&gt;Arvin Ash has made a video on that \nhttps://youtu.be/nTH1t-ZuRjs\n\nAnd yeah technically you get reborn again as different creatures and after million of years that part of you can again become a complex creature maybe even human (Thatswhy it\'s Written in many purans that human life is very hard and rare)\n\nThere is no individual soul which is going to transfer from one body to another your whole body is going to transform.\n\nSo what about the Theory of Karma?\n\nDoes it means our actions doesn\'t affect our next life? \n\nIf you think karma affect next life or you are facing bad things because of bad karma in your past life i think you have not understood the doctrine of karma properly.\n\nRead my Article on Casteism -\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/ev1ek8/casteism_in_hinduism_important/'<br />Author: 'fringehindu'<br />id: 'l0dz9w'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm üïâÔ∏è</li>

I believe that we should alienate art from sentiments and divorce it from the artist to allow creative freedom and genuine appreciation of good ideas. I would like to hear dissenting opinions by this community as to why it is bad to ridicule Hindu deities.  \nFrom what I've understood, in the sanatan culture. criticism and ridicule were always accepted even in ancient India. Apparently the carvakas were known to ridicule and insult the vedas and adopt a materialistic approach to the world and this was accepted as intellectual diversity has always been welcomed in the sanatan culture. As for insults, there have been multiple instances in our religious scriptures and books where the mere men as well as kings have insulted the gods and even fought with them sometimes even claiming victory so if the gods themselves are not immune to such disrespect then why is it that we have to take offence on their behalf ?  \nThis is not a criticism aimed at people who get offended but rather a genuine introspection as to why any such disrespect is offensive"<br />Author: 'FightPatriotFight'<br />id: 'l0bcly'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: "I really don't think i want Akhand Bharat. And i don't see why anyone else should."<br />Body: "Before you downvote, let me establish the fact that i do, with all my heart, want the reunification of Bharat. I want Indians to have _Indus_ otherwise whats the point. I want the Afghan mountains to mark our boundries once more. I want all of the lands watered by Ganga and Brahmaputra to be Indian again. I do want the whole Ram Setu from that end to ours. I do want Lanka, the land where God himself walked and battled King Ravana. So don't downvote thinking me as a Librandu or troll. Infact do upvote so more people can contribute.\n\nNow i am sure most of you all want the same things that i reiterated above. But theres one problem, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh are not mere lands..they _inhabited_ lands. Inhabited by the same people who found it all too easy to mutilate their own motherland in 1947. If such circumstances were to present themselves that we had the possibility of Akhand Bharat, that would mean addition of their mostly muslim population with ours. That would make India a country of over 600 millions. That is upwards of 60 crores. That'd put their population at around 43% of total population.\n\nWith less than 20 crores we have such many problems right now. Only this much are enough to plague us in our every step. Imagine what havoc that number three times over would raise. Also if by some miracle we managed to keep the country a democracy, We'd still be in troubling waters because Hindus are shit at uniting. As we all can see clearly. But muslims are radicalized and united in an instant. We can be sure that out of those 43% atleast 35%-37% will vote as a single block. With this much and a divided Hindu population (between centrists and others as we always are) it won't be long before an all muslim party comes in centre. How long do you think will it be before they go full islamic? Hindus are already sidelined and silenced, in this universe our situation would deteriorate a milliom times faster. Also with the breeding habits of the desert cult it will only be a few decades before they overpopulate us and the land of Chattrapati Shivaji, Rana Pratap and Guru Gobind would be proclaimed a Islamic nation. Aryavrat will be ruled by the wet dreams of desert Mlecchas.\n\nTo say it in short, Akhand Bharat, although  glorious and beautiful is not practical for the sustenance of Dharma. Atleast in the state Hindus are now. So untill we can think of either converting or shifting atleast 60% of their populations in the case of Akhand Bharat, it won't work. Would love to hear your opinions. And would love even more to be proven wrong here.\n\n_Tldr;_ Akhand Bharat has too many problems if implemented."<br />Author: 'ssc11'<br />id: 'kzb6on'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

I can't tell you how much these movies/shows have helped me realize that since I have been politically aware. A youtuber *Tried and Refused Productions* who is a leftist himself is now admitting in his reviews that the leftist agenda is becoming a little too much.\n\nSecondly, it provides us with endless ammunition to throw at our political opponents. Since they never question anything Islamic and only point against Hindus as some backwards barbarians, it becomes fundamentally clear that they are motivated by their hatred for us rather that anything else. Gems of Bollywood is getting really popular just for pointing things out.\n\nThirdly, the SSR fiasco has turned an incredible amount of normies against BollyDawood.

Initially, I could not believe it because of such fake job offers on market, but there was an email from realharvardjobs@matmaanmaachuda.com in my inbox. So obviously, I had to believe it. On opening the email, I found that I have been offered the position of Associate Professor of Bakchodi at Harvard University, UK. Although, I know that neither Harvard has a Department of Bakchodi not Harvard is in UK, but the email id seemed so legit that I wholeheartedly beleived it to be true. \n\n\nThe faculty relations department at Harvard, UK has asked for 1 lakh rupees to process my Visa. I immediately used Google Pay to transfer the amount as they were kind enough to provide me their UPI ID for their Indian Bank account. \n\n\nThereafter, I received a call on Whatsapp where a lady asked me share an OTP (this was for verification of my phone number). I was suspicious of the Whatsapp call, but the lady on the call explained that as International calls are expensive, they have resorted to free Whatsapp calling. Another thing that made me suspicious was that the Whatsapp call was from an Indian number but the Australian accent of the lady totally assuaged my suspicions. Thereafter, I used my investigative bakchodi skills and found that the the DP was of a White girl. Now, I am totally convinced of the genuiness of the job process. \n\n\nI am so happy right now. I will be finally emigrating to a White majority country where I will have freedom to listen racial abuses, which has been my long time dream. \n\n\nPS: I have received multiple SMS from my bank showing large debits.

<li>Title: '‚ÄúI Could Not Be Hindu: The Story Of A Dalit In The RSS‚Äù'<br />Body: 'The summary of the book \n\nAt the age of 13, Bhanwar Maghwanshi joined RSS. Instead of playing, learning and exploring, he opted to do something ‚Äòbigger‚Äô in his life. But, unfortunately, he was shocked to learn how RSS practices casteism without using the term ‚ÄòDalit‚Äô in its shakhas.\n\nHe was active with RSS, as a sevak, during the so-called Janmbhoomi movement of Ayodhya in the late 1980s. In his panchayat in Rajasthan, he never listened to azan or interacted with any Muslim ‚Äì in person, but developed strong abhorrence for the Muslims when he was learning ‚Äòskills‚Äô in RSS.\n\nHis dad was a Congress activist and discouraged him to join RSS (because, for him, RSS would never want ‚Äòbrahmin‚Äô sevaks to sacrifice their lives) but Bhanwar Meghwanshi ‚Äì on a positive note ‚Äì entered RSS.\n\nBhanwar‚Äôs ethnographic encounter in his book ‚ÄúI could not be Hindu ‚Äì the story of a Dalit in the RSS‚Äù is essential to refute the pseudo-science of RSS or Hindutva trollers on the subjects of Islam, untouchability and other narratives. The book sheds a detailed light on what RSS is, casteism in the RSS, and how RSS makes its ground in the society.\n\nNavayana Publishing House mustered the courage to publish the book, unlike other ‚Äòpopular‚Äô publishing houses, according to Bhanwar. He dreamt of becoming a ‚Äòpracharak‚Äô but was stopped to become a ‚Äòvistarak‚Äô because of his ‚Äòcaste‚Äô and this is where he learned that he is a lesser Hindu than other Hindus in RSS.\n\nHe left RSS after a very bitter experience. He writes, ‚ÄúWe had organised an event of Sangh in my hometown, I was heading the event as I was the most active and passionate worker in my area. I had planned to make food at my home only for the senior guests and the priests who would join the event. My father strongly opposed and said that they would never eat food cooked by us. I did not listen to him. I cooked good Rajasthani food with pure ghee and invited them. They did not come home but said that ‚Äòyou just pack the food we will eat it in the next village, as we are running out of time‚Äô. I packed the food for them, I later learned that they did not have my food but threw it in a naala (gutter). As the district chief, I got angry with them and asked the reason, but did not get satisfactory answers. I was reminded of my father‚Äôs words that ‚Äòpeople like us did not own any place in the Sangh‚Äô, it solely belongs to the upper castes.‚Äù\n\nThe book smashes the rosy picture of RSS and explains that the Dalits‚Äô role in RSS is mere foot soldiers for the communal polarisation and Hindutva activities. In an interview to Caravan magazine (14th March 2020), Bhanwar Meghwanshi made it clear that\xa0‚ÄúIn the eyes of the Sangh, the Hindu Rashtra is a Brahmin nation with the varna system, the four vedas and the Manusmriti. The Sangh wants to run the nation on this very base. I feel that in the Sangh‚Äôs Hindu Rashtra, shudras or untouchables will be slaves, and Muslims, heretics or foreigners, will be given a second-class status.‚Äù\n\nIn this memoir, Bhanwar also writes that in his village, low caste people joined the RSS in large numbers: ‚ÄúOf the fifty or so children who attended the shakha in my village, most were OBCs‚ÄîKumhar, Jat, Gurjar, Mali and so on.‚Äù\xa0They joined because of the Sanskritization processes and because of the games they played in the\xa0shakha, but they resided for ideological reasons too as, slowly, they learnt that ‚Äúhindu khatre main hai‚Äù (Hindus are in danger) because of Muslims and Christians. He also recalls that, while in the Sangh, he ‚Äúheard a lot about weapons being stored in the basements of mosques‚Äù and that getting rid of the Babri Masjid was like ‚Äúa second battle for independence‚Äù.\n\n\nBhanwar is not new in this race. A sarcastic letter authored by a Dalit activist P.D. Shelare, on 13/1/1934, published in ‚ÄòJanata‚Äô divulged about casteism or caste segregation practices in some\xa0shakhas\xa0of RSS. Shelare ratiocinated that RSS was aware of the practices but it did not react.\n\nI Left Hinduism In 2018\n\nIt‚Äôs obvious to learn that Hinduism is incomplete without\xa0casteism. The caste practices made me leave Hinduism too, on 30th December 2018. I\xa0adopted\xa0Buddhism, on par with Dr Ambedkar‚Äôs\xa0teachings. While reading the book, I could resonate my experiences too. In the current landscape, interactions and social relations have changed a lot. Caste dynamics too.\n\nTo add to the woes, love jihad law will further strengthen more endogamy and discourage intercaste marriages. Dining with Dalits alone would not bring about social changes. The ‚Äòsafe space‚Äô for the dissents and Dalits is diminishing, whereas love for hatred is openly normalized.\n\n\nIf this is true , how an OBC leader Modi became prime minister of India ?'<br />Author: 'lucifersci'<br />id: 'ky8q3j'<br />Flair ::oc-: OC ‡§π‡•à BC!üí°</li>

The takeaway, the lesson, let\'s recount it together. But some history first-\n\n*The year is 1818*\n\nA Christian priest,  British Baptist minister, missionary, abolitionist and Harvard professor named William Adam, after taking his inspiration from churchman Thomas Chalmer  decided to venture into India.\n\n With the help of American friends, Adam sent his family and left himself years later in 1838. There he met abolitionists and his background qualified him to be sent by the Americans as their representative to the anti-slavery meeting in London of the [British India Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_India_Society&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1).\n\nBoston East Indian merchants were so impressed by his linguistic skills that they arranged for his to be made a Professor of Oriental Linguistics at [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University), but by 1840 he was publishing public letters to [Thomas Fowell Buxton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fowell_Buxton) warning of British complacency of assuming that because the West Indies no longer had slavery it did not mean that the British Empire had renounced slavery whilst India was unchanged.\n\n In 1840, Adam was sent with a large number of other Americans to the [World\'s Anti-Slavery Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_Anti-Slavery_Convention) in London, where he presented a paper about India. After the convention was completed the more notable people were recorded in a large painting for the [Anti-Slavery Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Slavery_International)  .\n\n Reputedly they had been voted from the floor by clergyman who were generally not from the Church of England. In protest the four men took up seats with the sidelined women delegates. Adam said at the convention "If women had no right there, he had none, his credentials were from the same persons and the same society." \n\n Later after many discussions on Christianity and Indian thoughts on God, he found himself unable to resolve the doubts on Jesus Doctrines and logically felt defeated. (The life and letters of Raja Rammohun Roy by Collet, Sophia Dobson, 1822-1894, Page-68)\n\nAdam lost interest in the Baptist Mission, but not India, and with Roy and a mix of locals and Europeans formed the Calcutta Unitarian Society. The society ended in an unusual way when the Hindu membership became interested in the emerging ideas of [Brahmo Somaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmo_Somaj). In 1830,Adams was appointed by the colonial government of Bengal to carry out a census and analysis of native education in Bengal.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Adam_(minister)#cite_note-2)\n\nAnd it is this venture of his into India, while carrying out the analysis and census is what we\'re going to talk about-\n\n Following his investigations that lasted over two years (1836-8), William Adam submitted three reports which ‚Äúremain to this day an extremely important source of information regarding the state of indigenous education in early nineteenth century Bengal. \\[2\\] Four editions of [Adam‚Äôs work,](https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.135582/2015.135582.Reports-On-The-State-Of-Education-In-Bengal1835-38_djvu.txt) including the original reports that were submitted to the government from 1835-38, have been published at various junctures of time. \n\n Adam‚Äôs first report was based on a preliminary investigation and a review of pre-existing materials. It is the second and third reports of Adam that contain the results of his fieldwork and reveal a great deal of information. In his second report (which pertains to the district of Rajshahi in Bengal), Adam reveals that every native school has but one teacher. Adam‚Äôs second report also informs us about the number of pupils, the usual age of admission as well as of leaving school, the medium of instruction, the curriculum, the school building and the remuneration of the teacher as well as the teacher‚Äôs name, caste and age.\\[4\\] Adam‚Äôs third report pertained to three districts of Bengal (Burdwan, Beerbhoom and Moorshedabad) and two districts of Bihar (Tirhoot and South Bihar). This report reveals for each district, the number of schools categorised according to the medium of instruction. \\[5\\] It is beyond the scope of this article to list all of the statistics compiled by Adam. So, we will only highlight the most noteworthy points that will help us get a fair idea of the state of education in those days. \n\n Let us look at some numbers to begin with. **In his first report, Adam observed that almost every village had a school. So, there were more than 100,000 village schools in Bengal and Bihar and there was a village school for every 400 persons. \\[6\\]**\xa0Adam‚Äôs subsequent investigations looked at different kinds of schools in specific districts. For instance, his second report reveals that the district of South Bihar had a total of 286 Hindi schools in which 3,090 scholars received instruction. \\[7\\] \n\n(Let that sink in for a second, a 100,000 rural Gurukuls in the two states combined, let that sink in, because the same two states today lag behind and have less than that much no. of rural education institutions today, about 15%(or more) of rural areas in these 2 states till date still lack proper schooling facilities as per MHRD and RMD data from 2018) Moving on....\n\n**William Adam and "*****Brahminical Hegemony"*** **in the past**\n\n Adam‚Äôs reports also give information about the social composition of students and teachers of indigenous elementary schools.It is interesting to note that these reports contradict the modern notion of Brahminical hegemony. \n\n Much ink has been spilled on the hegemony of Brahmins in indigenous institutions and the inaccessibility of education for the socially backward classes. \\[8\\] But Adam (like his counterparts in the Madras Presidency) found that a significant percentage of students belonged to low castes such as *Malo, Chandal, Kahar, Luniar, Dhoba* and *Kalu*.  \n\n \\[9\\] These castes were also found to be well represented amongst the teachers of elementary schools, the majority of whom were non-Brahmins. For instance, Adam observed that in the district of South Bihar vernacular instruction was *‚Äúalmost wholly in the hands of the Kayastha or writer caste, and that the institutions of the country are still in this respect in almost unabated force. There are no brahman-teachers.‚Äù* \n\n \\[10\\]\xa0**There is now a vast body of evidence in the form of colonial surveys indicating that nearly all sections of pre-colonial Indian society enjoyed comfortable access to mass elementary education.** \n\nSo much for the "Brahminical Patriarchy down-down",right?\n\nQualitative aspect-\n\n Adam found that a scholar typically went through four stages of instruction during the course of his studies in a Bengali *patshala*.\\[12\\] Amongst the textbooks taught in Bengali schools, the *Subhankar* was found by Adam to be commonly used for basic arithmetic. Elementary grammar was taught through books such as *Sabda Subanta* and *Ashta Sabdi.* In addition, the Sanskrit verses of *Chanakya* (a book on statecraft and general principles by the ancient philosopher named Chanakya who lived between 371 and 283 B.C.) containing pithy maxims and general precepts of morality were read and memorized. Other general instruction included compositions in praise of various gods and goddesses such as *Data Karna* (on the altruistic nature of Karna, a hero in the *Mahabharata*), *Ram Janma* (on the birth of Lord Ram), *Ganga Bandana* (on the qualities of the river Ganges) etc. as well as extracts from religious epics such as the *Sundar Kand* of the *Ramayana,* or the *Adi Parva* of the *Mahabharata* etc. \\[13\\] \n\nHence it will not be wrong to conclude that the Gurukul system was what kept Pre-colonial India well rooted for its culture and the youth was not left astray.\n\nAs a matter of fact, contradicting the "Brahminical hegemonical" narrative that the left/liberals like to spit out like air everywhere, in all of the provinces that Adam surveyed, the lower caste students in Gurukuls, outnumbered the "upper-castes" by a ratio of almost 2:1 and even greater than 3:1 in some provinces.\n\nAll this while, Adam, while on his survey didn\'t encounter a single child who wasn\'t familiar with basic arithmetic, not a single person who he could call iliterate.\n\nEventually the same Gurukul system that kept us well connected to our roots and united as a society was chopped down by the English Education Act, 1835 but that\'s a story for another time.\n\nTherefore, after understanding the takeaways from the history we just dwelled into, I would like you all to come back to the first two *slokas* that I cited at the beginning, both verses are from the Manusmriti, the same code of law that haunts the left/liberal brigade like their worst nightmare, they keep quoting one single verse to try and establish the text as casteist, but the fact remains that all they can do is nitpick, because the slokas I cited indicate otherwise  hence demolishing their narrative of the solid nature of caste, I assert, again here that caste was not something solid, birth based, it only became so after the EEA,\'35 was passed and everyone was told to get their castes put down on paper and the same narrative and law continues till date in the form of colonial hangover because many other colonial surveys like Adam and Monroe clearly establish the difference between the caste and the Varna system.\n\nFurthermore, if a 3000 year old code of law/jurisprudence (dated as assigned by  Sir William Jones and Karl Wilhelm, Friedrich Schlegel)  indicates that the Varna system was fluid and it was possible for a *Sudra* to turn into a *Brahmin* by being learned and then carrying on the family legacy as a *Brahmin* itself then no modern narrative or bashing is enough to break this hard truth down. Yes, there were and have always been once-in-a-blue-moon precedences of discrimination, but most of the evidences,foreign accounts of India and surveys indicate otherwise, and the fact that Ancient India as a society lacked caste discrimination seems clear, no matter how many Guhas and Thapars keep shouting, the truth won\'t change this solid fact.\n\nWhat\'s to be noted here is that endogamy among Varna lines and Exogamy among Gotra lines was still persistent since the last 2000 years and should be excluded from what I stated above, in addition, Marriage restrictions across communities are something debatable and I see Varna endogamy (&amp; Gotra based exogamy, because Hinduism prohibits inbreeding) as purely a means established to maintain the stability of our gene pool intact as a community over time.\n\nSo on a concluding note, I would say, that it\'s a plot of the left/liberals to make us demolish our Varna identity with our own hands, [the first stage of subversion has already set in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9TviIuXPSE), and many Hindus have fallen prey to it, don\'t let them tell you otherwise because on their face is a smile, on their lips is a slogan but in their hearts is pure hatred for you and your identity, because when they couldn\'t win, they found their punching bags in the Brahmins/Kshtriya community and invented a hegemonical oppression narrative. Because then again, what is the left without the word "Oppression" in their dictionary and a victim card instead of an Aadhar?\n\nWhat I would like to end with is, let\'s unite as one, as Hindus,but also embrace our glorious past, and do not let go of your identity, if you\'re a Brahmin, say Jai Parshuram proudly, if you\'re a Kshtriya, hail Pratap, Vaishyas,your money still controls most of the modern world today,because what would we be without businessmen? And my *Sudra* mates,remember, the father of our constitution was one of you, a man who, by the way was also an unapologetic Hindu,a very proud one indeed and so is our President today.\n\nEmbrace your identities, embrace the blood of your ancestors and we shall emerge brighter, and don\'t let anyone tell you otherwise and that your identity is regressive, because they aren\'t anything but a wolf in sheep\'s clothing waiting to pounce on you and your ideals, because once you and I, my Hindu Friend let go of our identity and pride for our bloodline, we will not have a shield, a sense of belongingness and commune for each other anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*May Dharma prevail for eternity!*\n\n*Hare Krishna!*\n\n*Jai Parshuram!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources and References**\n\n1.

A caste-wise distribution of all Hindu students of the aforementioned districts of Bengal and Bihar is displayed from pages. 24-30 of Adam‚Äôs third report. Surprised to find an overwhelming number of low caste students in all of the five surveyed districts, Adam makes the following remarks: ‚ÄúThe number of scholars of low caste is so considerable that without explanation it might be supposed that they were chiefly found in the Missionary schools \\[‚Ä¶\\] the fact, however, is otherwise, for the number of scholars belonging to sixteen of the lowest castes amounts to 760, of whom only 86 are found in the Missionary schools, and the remaining number in native schools.‚Äù ibid. 30.\n10.

The sand-board is not used in this district, probably to save expense. The second period extending from two and a half to four years according to the capacity of the scholar, is distinguished by the use of the palm leaf as the material on which writing is performed \\[‚Ä¶\\] the scholar is then taught to write and read, and by frequent repetition he commits to memory, the Cowrie Table, the Numeration Table as far as 100, the Katha Table (a land measure table) and the Ser Table (a dry-measure table). The third stage of instruction extends from two to three years which are employed in writing on the plaintain-leaf \\[‚Ä¶\\] the fourth and final stage of instruction generally includes a period of two years, often less and seldom more. The accounts briefly and superficially taught in the preceeding stages are now taught more thoroughly and at a greater length, and this is accompanied by the compostion of business-letters, petitioners, grants, leases.‚Äù See Adam, *Second Report*, 18-19.\n13.

<li>Title: 'A really important message to the youth of India for protecting democracy.'<br />Body: 'History always repeats itself. Studying history is one way to predict the future accurately. I have studied the fall of the Soviet Union really well. Currently, the USA is on its way to becoming a communist state. How do I know this? The majority of the youth in the USA are communists now. It won\'t happen overnight but it will happen eventually, it may take some years if not decades. Free speech is the mechanism by which we keep our society functioning. We have to be able to say what we have to say badly. I have studied totalitarianism for a long time and I know how it starts, it always starts with restrictions on freedom of speech. We can already see these restrictions being implemented in the USA. You can\'t even lift the national flag of your country in public anymore in America without being called a Nazi, white supremacist, etc.\n\nIt\'s best to learn from others\' failures then fail and see them for yourself. That is why I am taking the example of the USA and relating it to our country so we can avoid the same mistake they made.\n\nHow did a superpower like the USA, which made the world safe for democracy ended up like this? I don\'t have any proof to say this but I think some communist countries planned the implosion of the USA by corrupting the youth. Universities in America are very left-leaning. I watched a video of this American dude, who studied in an Ivy League college talked about how all the universities would be teaching crazy politically biased stuff, all of it anti-American, and students believed them and followed their professor\'s knowledge blindly. Barely anyone opposed what was being taught. People who agreed with what was being taught were very vocal and eventually, they became the majority because conservatives never opened their mouths because they risked being hated for what they believe in. Some years later, Free speech in universities was dead. You\'d be labelled something you are not if you didn\'t have the same opinion as them. Now, free speech in the entire country is dying. Finally, these conservatives realized that they need to say something but it was too late. I don\'t want my country to land in the same situation in the future.\n\n"Who controls the media, controls the masses." We can see a live example of this:- Facebook, Twitter, Google, Amazon erasing Parker app from the internet because it promoted freedom of speech. See how the "India" subreddit literally bans anybody with opposing beliefs. That is exactly what we want to avoid. I won\'t be surprised if some non-Indian is running that sub. I really don\'t want my country to land in the same situation as the USA.\n\nSo what do I suggest? Be vocal about what you believe in. Express your opinions whenever required. Also, let people with opposing views talk. Don\'t hate on them for having that belief, I say respect them for having that opinion. Hear them out and tell them what you think, that\'s how one can reach a final conclusion. EVERYBODY TALK. Don\'t be ashamed to tell your friends if you support Modi or Rahul and state your reasons for that. Don\'t be afraid to be called a Hindi nationalist or liberandu. That way, at least you wouldn\'t be called a coward.\n\nOur right for freedom is speech is what makes Democracy amazing.

I have been getting a lot of letters from aware daughters from across the country asking for an early decision on the matter. They ask why has the committee‚Äôs report not come yet. I assure all those daughters that very soon the report will come and as soon as that happens, the government will study it and work on its recommendations,‚Äù he said.\n\nCommittee led by Jaya Jaitly giving final touches to report\n\nThe PM‚Äôs remarks came during his speech at the release of a commemorative coin to mark 75 years of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, where he spoke on the government adopting an ‚Äúintegrated and multidimensional approach‚Äù to tackle the problem of malnutrition. TOI has learnt that the committee headed by Jaya Jaitly is giving final touches to the report. The task force constituted in June was to originally give its report by July 31. The committee was formed after an announcement by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Union budget for 2020-21.\n\nhttps://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-45522,msid-78714734/78714734.jpg\n\n\nThe task force has the mandate to examine matters pertaining to age of motherhood, imperatives of lowering maternal mortality rate, improvement of nutritional levels and related issues. It will also suggest suitable legislations or amendments in existing laws and a detailed rollout plan with timelines to implement these recommendations.\nOn August 15, in his speech from the Red Fort, the PM said a decision on ‚Äúwhat should be the right age of marriage for girls‚Äù would be taken as soon as a committee set up to study the issue gave its report. As of now, the legal age of marriage is 18 years for girls and 21 years for boys. The age of marriage has been a point of debate for long with some civil society organisations opposing the move to raise the age of marriage.'<br />Author: 'CholiMein'<br />id: 'kx0yj9'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'We all know what is happening in the Mewat region to the minority Hindus. I found a really interesting article about it which I would like to share with you all. Sharing the original article too in the comments. Please do read this article. It explains why these things are happening in Mewat'<br />Body: '\xa0Nuh is different from the rest of Haryana because of its religious demography. While Muslims constitute 7.06 per cent of the State‚Äôs population (as per Census, 2011), they constitute 75 per cent of the district. As per the 1971 census, the Muslims constituted 62 per cent of the population in the five tehsils that now form Nuh. This reversal of the majority-minority relationship has had its consequences, particularly in the polarised context prevailing in the rest of the country. That‚Äôs why Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar declared that his Government would bring a law against forced conversions and set up a board to protect Hindu properties.\n\nThe Mewat district was renamed as Nuh in 2016. Earlier in 2001, Mewat (1,507 sq km) was carved out from Gurgaon district. Nuh has been in the news for the wrong reasons. Mewati gangs are notorious for **cattle smuggling, automobile thefts and highway robberies**. Jails in Gurugram and Faridabad districts have a disproportionate number of Mewati inmates. **Terror suspects have been arrested from Nuh**. There have been reports of communal disturbances.\n\nYet things need not have played out like this. The Meo Muslims were a different lot; they were more or less Hindu in custom and culture until the beginning of the 20th century. Their syncretism could have been an example for the rest of the Muslims of the subcontinent. Major Percy William Powlett wrote about the Meos of Alwar (then a princely State) in Alwar Gazetteer (1878). He said: ‚ÄúThe Meos are half-Hindu by their habits. Mosques are rarely to be seen in their villages. There are only eight mosques in the 50 villages of the tehsil of Tijarah. Leaving aside the temples, the places of worship of the Meos are very much similar to those of Hindu neighbours. They are known, for instance, as Paanch Peera, Baisa and Chahand.‚Äù\n\nMewat, as a historical region, extends into Alwar and Bharatpur districts of Rajasthan and Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh beyond its heartland, that is Nuh. One has to cross the region while going to either Agra or Jaipur from Delhi. It lies at the heart of the ‚Äúgolden triangle‚Äù tourist circuit comprising Delhi, Agra and Jaipur.\n\nIt is barely known to the outsiders how this region, merely 70-80 km away from Delhi, acted as the laboratory of Islamic alienation over the last century. Maulana Mohammad Ilyas (1885-1944), who started the itinerant Tabligh movement (Tablighi Jama‚Äôat), chose Mewat as its nursery in the 1920s. The movement has been run from its headquarters in the Banglewali Masjid in the Nizamuddin area of Delhi. Since Maulana Ilyas was a product of Dar-ul-Uloom at Deoband (in fact, a pet student of its co-founder Ahmed Rashid Gangohi), the imprint of its orthodoxy is evident in the Tabligh movement.\n\nTabligh is an outreach movement by Muslim missionaries to take authentic Islam to the doorsteps of the believers. It encourages nominal Muslims (Momin) to become true Muslims (Ihsaan/Muhsin). The process involves disavowal of all ‚ÄúKafiresque‚Äù (that is not sanctioned by Islam) practices, which might be the legacy of the pre-Islamic past. The recital of six Kalimas (six verses of Quran) and performing namaaz form the foundation of Tablighi practices. The six Kalimas are avowals that there is ‚Äúno God but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.‚Äù The sixth Kalima is especially a rejection of disbelief and polytheism. The Kalimas constitute disavowal of associating Allah with any other divine authority. Naturally, syncretism is not merely out of place, but sinful, to be practised alongside Islam.\n\nWay back in 1970, Hashim Amir Ali, Director, Rural Institute, Jamia Millia Islamia, had, by examining the features of the movement, stated that the ‚Äúinstitution of Tabligh has begun to blow a wind of change for the worse in the hitherto tranquil and uniquely syncretic culture of the Meos‚Äù (The Meos of Mewat: Old Neighbours of New Delhi, P.41). Ali feared that orthodoxy, championed by Tabligh, would be ruinous for the economic life of the Meos. The religious injunction against interest might discourage them from accepting loans from banks, opening bank accounts or even joining cooperative societies. It might be remembered that Dar-ul-Uloom at Deoband has pronounced several fatwas against any kind of borrowing/lending which involves payment of interest. It is high time that fresh sociological studies are undertaken to ascertain how far the Islamic prohibitions on certain issues (like interest on lending/borrowing and family planning methods) have kept the Muslim community backward and impoverished.\n\nThe result of the Tabligh movement manifested during the tumultuous times of 1946-47 when a popular demand for a **separate ‚ÄúMeostan‚Äù was raised**. Interestingly, it was pitched by the **Communist leader Kunwar Mohammed Ashraf**. Its boundaries were envisaged as extending from Mehrauli in Delhi to Bandikui in Dausa district of Rajasthan. The Meos of Alwar and Bharatpur had formed the Rajputana Muslim League. One of its sections was determined to achieve Meostan, envisaged as adjacent to Pakistan, by the power of guns. This naturally culminated in a riotous situation where Meos suffered heavy losses due to the Hindu backlash. Narayan Bhaskar Khare, the Congressman who was then the Dewan of the Alwar State, had described the situation in detail in his memoirs (My Political Memoirs or Autobiography, 1959).\n\nHowever, Lord Mountbatten‚Äôs Partition declaration, dated June 3, 1947, which stipulated the division of both Punjab and Bengal, knocked out the plan for a Meostan. **Beleaguered, a large number of Meos fled to Pakistan but only to be invited back to India by the Jawaharlal Nehru Government**. **Stopping them from migrating to Pakistan also became an article of faith for Mahatma Gandhi**. Khare, therefore, was not certain that permanent peace had returned to Mewat. He was apprehensive that communalism could still rear its ugly head. Time has vindicated Khare as the discontent continues to simmer.'<br />Author: 'Meet_Me_In_Heaven'<br />id: 'kwztk1'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Generally, it refers to Jews or Christians living in Muslim-majority countries. They are given choice of death or Islam. However, if they pay tax "(called jizya, they can live). In India, it was extended to Hindus/Jains/Buddhists as well.\n\nIt is not just about the tax but certain restrictions that come with it. For e.g.\n\nan integral aspect of the dhimma was that, being an infidel, he had to openly acknowledge the superiority of the true believer--the Muslim.\n\nThe "tribute" (or jizya), paid as a yearly poll tax, symbolized the subordination of the dhimmi. Later, the inferior status of Dhimmis was reinforced through a series of regulations that governed the behavior. Dhimmis, on pain of death, were forbidden to mock or criticize the Koran, Islam or Muhammad, to proselytize among Muslims or to touch a Muslim woman (though a Muslim man could take a non\xadMuslim as a wife).\n\nDhimmis were excluded from public office and armed service, and were forbidden to bear arms. \n\nThey were not allowed to ride horses or camels, to build synagogues or churches taller than mosques, to construct houses higher than those of Muslims or to drink wine in public. \n\nThey were not allowed to pray or mourn in loud voices-as that might offend the Muslims. \n\nThe dhimmi had to show public deference toward Muslims-always yielding them the center of the road. \n\nThe dhimmi was not allowed to give evidence in court against a Muslim, and his oath was unacceptable in an Islamic court. To defend himself, the dhimmi would have to purchase Muslim witnesses at great expense. This left the dhimmi with little legal recourse when harmed by a Muslim.\n\nDhimmis were also forced to wear distinctive clothing. In the ninth century, for example, Baghdad\'s Caliph al-Mutawakkil designated a yellow badge for Jews, setting a precedent that would be followed centuries later in Nazi Germany.'<br />Author: 'pyaarkiaag'<br />id: 'kwefno'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>

Judicial review is one of the checks and balances in the separation of powers: the power of the judiciary to supervise the legislative and executive branches when the latter exceed their authority. The doctrine varies between jurisdictions, so the procedure and scope of judicial review may differ between the countries.

<li>Title: '"It is for YOU to thank ME" - Swami Vivekananda, after John D. Rockefeller\'s large public donation on his suggestion'<br />Body: 'John D. Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil, and legendary miser, turned into one of the world\'s biggest philanthropist later in his life. His first meeting with Swami Vivekananda in 1894 (Swamiji\'s Chicago speech was in Sept. 1893) went as follows:\n\nhttps://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_9/Conversations_and_Interviews\n\n----\n\nFIRST MEETING WITH JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER\n(An excerpt from Madame Verdier‚Äôs journal quoted in the New Discoveries, Vol. 1, pp. 487-88.)\n\n[As told by Madame Emma Calv√©‚Äö to Madame Drinette Verdier]\n\nMr. X, in whose home Swamiji was staying in Chicago, was a partner or an associate in some business with John D. Rockefeller. Many times John D. heard his friends talking about this extraordinary and wonderful Hindu monk who was staying with them, and many times he had been invited to meet Swamiji but, for one reason or another, always refused. At that time Rockefeller was not yet at the peak of his fortune, but was already powerful and strong-willed, very difficult to handle and a hard man to advise.\n\nBut one day, although he did not want to meet Swamiji, he was pushed to it by an impulse and went directly to the house of his friends, brushing aside the butler who opened the door and saying that he wanted to see the Hindu monk.\n\nThe butler ushered him into the living room, and, not waiting to be announced, Rockefeller entered into Swamiji\'s adjoining study and was much surprised, I presume, to see Swamiji behind his writing table not even lifting his eyes to see who had entered.\n\nAfter a while, as with Calv√©, Swamiji told Rockefeller much of his past that was not known to any but himself, and made him understand that the money he had already accumulated was not his, that he was only a channel and that his duty was to do good to the world ‚Äî that God had given him all his wealth in order that he might have an opportunity to help and do good to people.\n\nRockefeller was annoyed that anyone dared to talk to him that way and tell him what to do. He left the room in irritation, not even saying goodbye. But about a week after, again without being announced, he entered Swamiji\'s study and, finding him the same as before, threw on his desk a paper which told of his plans to donate an enormous sum of money toward the financing of a public institution.\n\n"Well, there you are", he said. "You must be satisfied now, and you can thank me for it."\n\nSwamiji didn\'t even lift his eyes, did not move. Then taking the paper, he quietly read it, saying: **"It is for you to thank me"**. That was all. This was Rockefeller\'s first large donation to the public welfare. \n\n----'<br />Author: 'Librandu_Lefticle'<br />id: 'kw4kgb'<br />Flair :Viraat Sanataniüö©</li>

<li>Title: 'An accident of history:'<br />Body: 'In the year 1920, two books were distributed from all the mosques of India. One book was named "Krishna Teri Geeta Jalani Padegi" &amp; the second book was titled "Nineteenth-Century Lustful Maharishi" \n\nBoth books were "anonymous" There was no author or publisher\'s name, and both these books r very vulgar, extremely abusive things were written on Lord Shri Krishna, Hinduism, etc. And in these books very obscene sketches of various deities were also made. \n\nAnd slowly, both these books started being distributed from every mosque in India. When this matter reached Gandhi, Gandhi made it secondary by saying that "freedom of expression", and said that everyone in India has the right to speak.  \n\nBut with both of these books, India\'s public was boiling a lot. Then in 1923, "Mahasaya Rajpal Ji", the owner of Lahore-based "Rajpal Publishers", published a book called "Rangeela Rasool"The author of that book was named a secret and in place of the author it was written "milk of milk, and water of water"  Although the real author of that book was Pandit Champupati, a well-known scholar of Islam. And the best part was that there was no lie in that book.  \n\nBut with all the evidence, many things were written, giving the rectangle number, hadith number, etc.  "Rangeela Rasool" was sold all over India for one and a half years!  Somewhere, there is no ruckus. But one day suddenly on 24 May 1924.  \n\nGandhi, in his newspaper "Young India", by writing a long article, strongly condemned the book "Rangeela Rasool", and finally wrote 03 lines like this:  "Muslims should punish those who write such books themselves..! \n\nBy reading this article of Gandhi, Mu$l!ms from all over India were agitated. And the owner of "Rajpal Publishers", Mahashiya Rajpal Ji was attacked 05 times in 03 years, but Gandhi did not condemn the attack even once... \n\nInterestingly, some Mu$l!m scholars filed the case of that book "Rangeela Rasool" in the Lahore High Court.  High Court standing four I$lam!c scholars in court, asked them which line of this book is not correct, you tell that. \n\nAll four Islamic scholars agreed that there was nothing wrong with this book. Then the Lahore High Court dismissed the case against Mahashah Rajpal Ji &amp; acquitted them of the crime. Then after that, on 03 Aug 1924, Gandhi wrote another provocative article in the "Young India"  newspaper, and in this article, he wrote in the gestures that "when a person does not get justice from the courts, he should try himself must be judged.\n\n After that, there were two more assaults on Mahashiya Rajpal Ji, and finally the attack of 06 April 1929 proved fatal in which a young man named Mohammad Ilm Din made several attacks against Maasya Rajpal Ji from whom he was attacked. Lost my life. Gandhi was in Lahore 7 days after the day he was assassinated, but Gandhi did not go to the house of Mahashiya Rajpal Ji to condole. \n\nNor is any of his editorials condemned the murder of Mahashiya Rajpal Ji. After that, the British prosecuted and sentenced Ilm Din, the murderer of Mahashah Rajpal Ji, to death in just 6 months.  And that is also because the whole Hindu society in this country was boiled. \n\nAnd the British felt that if they did not hang fast, then the British rule could also be threatened. After that, on June 4, 1929, Gandhi wrote a letter to the British Viceroy and requested to forgive the execution sentence of the murderer of Mahashah Rajpal Ji. \n\nAnd the next day, an article was written in his newspaper "Young India", in which Gandhi tried to prove that this murderer was innocent, immature, because he did not tolerate an insult to his religion, and he got angry and decided to commit this murder. \n\nOn the other hand, the then renowned barrister Mohammad Ali Jinnah, in the Lahore High Court, as a barrister, while appearing in the case, had said that the culprit is only a boy of 19 years, but he has committed a heinous crime. \n\nHave done its crime cannot be underestimated, but looking at its age, its hanging sentence should be changed to life imprisonment or he should be sent to the Black Water Jail.  But the British executed Mohammed Ilm Din, the murderer of Mahashah Rajpal Ji, in Lahore jail on 31 October 1929.  On 02 November 1929, Gandhi wrote the black day of history to hang Ilm Din in "Young India"!

As per the scriptures, along with Gou-Hatya = Cow slaughter and Brahmana-Hatya = killing knowledge keepers, Bhruna-Hatya = feotocide, infanticode and abortion is also a Maha Papa = Major sin. Yet, why is abortion a non-issue in Hindu society ? Why do we worship dung ? Why do we allow cows to walk in the middle of the roads, disrupt traffic and relieve themselves making such a mess ?

<li>Title: "Farce in Supreme Court over farm reforms shows how Lutyens' arm-twists judiciary"<br />Body: '&gt;The AG clarified that the laws were made on the basis of recommendations of several expert committees which wanted removal of restrictions in the APMC system and to allow direct marketing, among other reforms. He also reminded that court cannot stay a legislation unless the court finds that (1) law is passed without legislative competence (2) law violates fundamental rights (3) law violates other provisions of constitution.\n\n&gt;However, the CJI said he was not interested in discussing Constitutionality of the laws, but was concerned about lack of progress in negotiations at this time. If one reads the transcript of what transpired in court today as live-tweeted by legal site LiveLaw, one cannot escape the conclusion that the SC bench‚Äôs overriding concern was how the Court‚Äôs role would be perceived by protestors, and how to prevent any blame falling on SC if the protests turn violent.\n\n&gt;CJI also seemed worried with media reports about parties placing onus on courts to decide on the new farm laws. This should be seen in context of the Agriculture Minister‚Äôs request to protestors to ‚Äòwait for the court‚Äôs decision‚Äô, after being repeatedly frustrated by the unions‚Äô intransigence and adamant demand to completely repeal the 3 laws. The CJI also took offence to another newspaper article which reportedly mentioned one political party‚Äôs (BJP?) stance that ‚ÄòSupreme Court should not decide on the policy of the law‚Äô.\n\n&gt;In today‚Äôs hearing, the CJI kept going back to his preferred ‚Äòsolution‚Äô: appoint a ‚Äòneutral‚Äô committee to discuss with farmers and then submit a report to SC, and the laws to be withheld till then. Of course, the choice of committee members suggested in December by CJI like veteran The Hindu journalist and known Modi-baiter like P Sainath really bring into question the judiciary‚Äôs understanding of ‚Äòneutrality‚Äô.\n\n&gt;When the SG tried to intervene, the CJI remarked, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know if you are part of the problem or solution.‚Äù When the SG told the court that many farmers organizations are telling the government that the laws are progressive and good, the CJI said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have any single petition before us saying that the laws are good.‚Äù\n\n&gt;The SG reminded the court that just to appease a minority group of vocal protesters, it cannot stall laws which are beneficial to the majority.\n\n&gt;While the CJI was dismissive of the government lawyers, he was very deferential to senior Lutyens‚Äô advocates like Dushyant Dave, Colin Gonsalves, HS Phoolka and Vivek Tankha appearing for protesting farmers groups. Addressing them, the CJI requested them to move protest site once the laws were stayed, stating ‚ÄúWe are not against protests. Don‚Äôt understand that the Court is stifling protests. But we ask. If after the laws are stayed, will you move the site of protests to accommodate people‚Äôs concerns?‚Äù\n\n&gt;The threat of violence was clearly uppermost on the CJI‚Äôs mind, when he stated, ‚ÄúEach one of us will be responsible if something goes wrong‚Ä¶.We don‚Äôt want anybody‚Äôs blood on our hands.‚Äù The court seemed to have forgotten its own ruling after the protracted and illegal Shaheen Bagh sit-in protest culminated with the anti-Hindu Delhi riots, where it said ‚Äì ‚Äúpublic places cannot be allowed for indefinite protests which must take place at designated sites. In a parliamentary democracy, there is an avenue of debate.‚Äù\n\n&gt;For that matter, protests are not new in Bharatiya public life ‚Äì Jat, Maratha and Gurjar protests for  reservation benefits comes to mind in recent times. Some resulted in violence, while others were resolved through negotiations with government or by approaching courts. But no where did one see this kind of blackmail of the entire state machinery, and bypassing the legislative entirely to set up court-appointed Committees to decide on laws.\n\n&gt;When senior advocate PS Narasimha, appearing for an intervenor, argued that there are many other farmers organizations which see the laws as beneficial, and the court did not have their perspective, the CJI said, ‚ÄúMr.Narasimha, even if your argument is valid, it does not help the situation which is on ground now.‚Äù\n\n&gt;Pleas by others like Adv. MP Devnath, appearing for Confederation of All India Traders, who demanded the implementation of laws, or another counsel appearing for Consortium of South India Consumers who also urged courts not to stay implementation of laws, were dismissed by the CJI, stating, ‚ÄúCan you persuade the Punjab farmers who have been protesting for two months? No, right? Let the committee look into it‚Ä¶..We are staying the implementation only to facilitate the talks before the Committee.‚Äù\n\n&gt;When the AG remarked whether farmers would show the same adamance and churlishness in front of the Committee that they have displayed in multiple rounds of talks with the government, and questioned the utility of the Committee unless protestors revealed their exact grievances (which they have refused to divulge to the Government), the CJI said, ‚ÄúWe trust senior advocates like Prashant Bhushan, Dave, Phoolka, Gonsalves etc will tell the farmers about the real purpose of the Committee. We are not creating an alternative forum.‚Äù\n\n&gt;In essence, the CJI is trusting one of the same lawyers (Prashant Bhushan) who the SC itself had found guilty of contempt of court a mere 4 months back!\n\n&gt;CJI then asked for suggestions for a previous CJI to be part of the Committee, to which Dushyant Dave suggested former CJI RM Lodha‚Äôs name. Lodha, who was CJI from April to Sept 2014, had clashed with the Modi government during his brief stint over the NDA government‚Äôs rejection of UPA-era Solicitor General Gopal Subramanium‚Äôs candidature as SC judge. Post retirement he has also been critical of the signature CAA law passed by the Modi government.\n\nhttps://www.hindupost.in/featured/farce-in-supreme-court-over-farm-reforms-shows-how-lutyens-arm-twists-judiciary/'<br />Author: 'BalHanumanJi'<br />id: 'kv8w3s'<br />Flair :National üì∞</li>
<li>Title: 'If you think the victim card has been recently invented then you are very wrong!

He also wanted a section on the fixing scandal which happened. Now I am just a normal content writer nothing fancy so I started to research things and guess what, I made some really crazy discoveries which I would like to share with ya all.\n\n* Hansie Cronje had 70 offshore bank accounts in the Cayman Islands! (Imagine the extent of fixing which he must have carried out)\n* He **cried while pleading guilty** and named Azhar Babu to be the person who introduced him to the bookies.\n* Cronje freaking dies in an air crash in 2002. The whole case against him closed by the SA authorities.\n* In the CBI inquiry that followed, Azhar was found guilty and thus was banned by the BCCI.\n* Now when Azhar was asked why he was being named by Cronje, here was his answer "**Because I am from a minority community"**\n* Further twist, Hyderabad court in 2012 decides that the ban was \'hastily implemented\' and overturns BCCI\'s decision.\n* Azhar Babu currently the President of the Hyderabad Cricket Association.\n* Azhar also won the 2009 Lok Sabha elections!\n\nAnother interesting point, all the websites all throughout the internet are defending him on the basis of the 2012 judgment but no one has dared to look at that CBI report. I suggested to my client that we write an entire well-written article on that freaking report!

<li>Title: 'Excerpts from last chapter of Anandamath by Rishi Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay: His take on British rule and resurgence of Sanatan Dharma.'<br />Body: 'Rishi Bankimchandra is one of the prominent Hindutvavadi writers. His view was British rule was necessary to keep Islamic rule out of its way. And the time was not right to fight war against British, that time would come. And after so many years the British rule (and the residual of British rule) the Hindu renaissance is finally happening. Lets just do our part. Read and train your mind, train your body, Earn more. Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha.\n\nIf you can read bengali, read [this](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.298361/page/n783/mode/2up). Else, here is English Translation.\n\n&gt;SATYANANDA Thakur left the battle-field without telling anything to anybody and came to Anandamath. There on the Vishnumandap at dead of night he sat in deep meditation. Just then that doctor made his appearance there. Seeing him Satyananda got up and made his obeisance to him.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The doctor said, ‚ÄúSatyananda, today is Maghi-Purnima.‚Äù  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Satyananda: Let us go, I am ready. But He Mahatman! deign to remove a certain doubt from my mind. At the very moment when I have succeeded in making the Santan dharma safe through war, why do you come and recall me?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He who had come said, ‚ÄúYour work is accomplished, the Mussulman kingdom is destroyed. You have no other work now. Further slaughter of living beings is useless.‚Äù  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Satyananda: The Mussulman Rajya is done away with but no Hindu Rajya has yet been established. The English are strong in Kalikata (Kolkata) now.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He said, ‚ÄúThe Hindu Rajya is not destined yet to be established. Your presence here will mean useless loss of human life. So come away with me.‚Äù  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hearing this Satyananda felt acutely distressed. He said, ‚ÄúHe Prabhu! If the Hindu Rajya is not established, then who will rule here? Will the Mussulman again get the upper hand?‚Äù  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He said, ‚ÄúNo, the English will rule India now.‚Äù  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Tears flowed from both of Satyananda‚Äôs eyes. Turning towards the pratima of Matrirupa Janmabhumi, he began saying in tear-choked voice with joined plams, ‚ÄúHai Ma! I have failed to rescue you, you will again fall into the clutches of the Mlechhas. Do condone the failing of your Santan. Why did I not die in the battle-field today?‚Äù  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The doctor said, ‚ÄúSatyananda, don‚Äôt be broken-hearted. Due to your error of judgment you gathered money through robbery and thus won the war. Out of sin does not come pure achievement. So you will necessarily fail to rescue your country. Moreover, whatever will happen will be for the best. Unless the English rule this land, there is no chance of the renaissance of the Sanatan dharma. Listen patiently. I shall explain to you as it has been seen and understood by the Mahapurushes. *The worship of Thirty Three Koti Devatas is not the Sanatan dharma; that is a Loukik Apakrishta Dharma. Under its influence, the true Sanatan Dharma, as the Mlechhas call it Hindu dharma, is lost. The true Hindu dharma is Knowledge(Gnyan) based, not Karma based. That Gnyan is of two kinds: ‚Äî secular or external and spiritual or internal. The inner spiritual knowledge is the chief part of real dharma. But unless secular knowledge about the outside world comes, the other knowledge about the inner world cannot grow. Unless one knows what the Sthula, one cannot arrive at the Sukshma. For a long time this Sthula knowledge has been lost in this country ‚Äî so the true Sanatan dharma is also lost. In order to restore the Sanatan dharma, at the outset knowledge of the material world must be preached. There is not much material knowledge in the country now, there is none capable of teaching it. We are not adepts in spreading popular education. So the necessary knowledge has got to be brought and introduced from other countries. The English are past masters in the knowledge pertaining to the material world. They are adepts in the art of teaching. So we shall make the British our rulers. Through English education our people attaining knowledge of the material world will also be made capable of understanding inner knowledge. There will then be no obstacle against preaching the true eternal dharma. True dharma will, under the circumstances, grow spontaneously. So long as that does not happen, so long as the Hindus do not become wise, worthy and strong, British rule will endure. The subjects will be happy under the British control. They will pursue their religious life without hindrance. So, wise one! Desist from fighting the British and follow me.‚Äù*'<br />Author: 'Straight_Razor007'<br />id: 'kv2uza'<br />Flair :Viraat Sanataniüö©</li>

<li>Title: 'Unpopular opinion : We should thank BJP for increasing petrol prices which could be useful for our environment.'<br />Body: "A lot of young men and women have motorcycles/cars and never use public transports like the average middle class. The government has already connected 100 percent of villages and cities through roads and provided a decent public transport along with metros. By increasing petrol prices, we can force other people to use more and more public transport. The introduction of BS6 engines has increased the cost of vehicles and private ownership will decrease which would significantly reduce carbon monoxide levels. I wish modi could increase the petrol prices by atleast Rs.500 per litre (only for private vehicles) and within a year, we could be like Netherlands where people would start preferring cycles/public transportation. By the end of 2030, only electric vehicles should be allowed imo and people should pay pollution tax for owning a vehicle. This will help us fighting climate change for the long run.

<li>Title: 'Why you should never trust an Indian Ex Muslim to ever be against Islamic terrorism'<br />Body: 'This is what I found on a post on Indian Apostates. \n\n&gt;These are my thoughts on this subject - \n\n&gt;1.) India is a very collectivist society. We are huge on maintaining the status quo, there is a strong focus on respecting the elders , obeying them and so on. This naturally means as a society we don\'t create a conducive environment for anything that challenges the status quo to take root. \n\n&gt;2.) Educational institutions and the campus culture in India. You\'d be surprised to learn that most institutions of higher learning in india are just an extension of school life. There\'s no culture of part time work , kids are dependent on their parents well until they graduate and get a job. 90% of colleges in my city have extremely regressive policies like no participation in political activites. (I had to sign a declaration that I will not engage in political activism while in university) , no free mixing of the sexes, strict curfew in hostels ( women had to be back in their hostels before 8 p.m in my college). There is an enormous focus on academics and every other activity takes a back seat.\n\n&gt;3.) The social cost of being an exmuslim. You will always be a Muslim to the Hindus and Christians , you will never be Muslim enough for the muslims. Religion is an Identity in India, it\'s something you inherit from your parents. No matter how much you want to say you are not a Muslim , you are one riot away from running to the arms of muslims for safety. I\'ve faced this myself - at the end of the day this is the only community I have, and in a collectivist society where people ask your family name and caste before asking your name - you can\'t give up your identity so easily. I still have to hide my apostasy from everyone because it will affect even my brother\'s life if I were to bring "dishonor" to my family through my actions , so I stay in the shadows and it\'s not like I\'m gonna face any issues for being an openly non-practising muslim or a cultural muslim so most people just choose the easy way out and stay cultural muslims. We drink, we fuck , get into all sorts of haraam activities and we maintain our identity as muslims. \n\n\n\n3rd point is important. While an Ex Hindu or an Ex Christian literally shits on his people. In America, SJWs shit on Whites like hell. Idhar ki Ex Hindu sub ko dekhoge toh exactly edgy atheist subs ke tarah lagega. It is expected. They left their religions. They will be critical. \n\nThen come the hypocritical Ex Muslims of India. They openly say that they will never leave their community. These Ex Muslims often say that they are considered Muslims by Non Muslims even though they are Apostates but prove us right just in the next line when they say that they run back to the Muslim community. These guys would even side outright with Al Qaeda and give the same reason. Ex Muslims won\'t condemn Islamic attacks and supremacism because they VOLUNTARILY ALLY WITH THE MUSLIMS.'<br />Author: 'gaybabe5789'<br />id: 'kui42x'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihaad_Halal Certified</li>
