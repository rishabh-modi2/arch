It‚Äôs a debut novel and she or the book is not much known, hence I won‚Äôt name either of them so that I don‚Äôt advertise for them .\n\nWhile the book arrived I scanned her social media  profile and she seems a devout Hindu with all festivities celebrated, fasting rituals photos, Temple visit photos etc\n\n\nNow in her book she re imagines the story of Sita and draws parallels with modern day.\n\n1) Rama is a misogynist\n\n2) Sita fell in love with Ravana during Swayamvar but had to reject him due to political pressure \n\n3) Lakshman tried to rape Shurpanakha and when she resisted he chopped her nose off\n\n4) Ravana is a big feminist and Rama was spiteful to go on exile and he wanted to rule\n\nThere are many more. While such incidents are aplenty and don‚Äôt follow source material(Ravana was a Taoist who raped his brother‚Äôs daughter in law in vengeance), it‚Äôs the modern day story which is as troublesome \n\n\nProtagonist is Hindu whose devout Hindu in law family abuses and beats her. Other protagonist is a Christian cop. Another good character is a Christian stand up whose sister is disabled. Why? She married a Hindu who beat her to disability. All evil Hindu characters are fans of Sri Rama.\n\n\nSo my question is the same. Why are even the most devout of Keralites so self hating? Or rather so hating of their own identity?

And I heard a rumor that narsinghanand videos were viraled in peaceful communities can't confirm that. \n\nAnd the most amazing part is she has such a big ego that even after loosing the election herself she doesn't rethink how politics in Bengal should look like, its same as before, people dying bombing, no law and order. \n\nAnyways coming to the point, (and snowflakes don't read too much into this, I am going to vote BJP if for nothing else, just to keep pappu and friends at bay) BJP has become complacent in  recent times, their IT strategy is non existent it seems, when they were the dominant player in social media at one point. They have failed to dominate the narrative landscape be it the Farm law or CAA and some decisions i do not agree with at all, recent example being and there has been no decision but giving indemnity to Moderna and Phizer is a stupid idea in my view. \n\nSo WB was needed to wake the sleeping giants of BJP. With the darpok tmc chamchas going back to didi, it should force BJP to reevaluate how they conduct elections and who to let into the party. Not all are Rita Bahuguna Joshi. Now the best part of people going back is that didi will become overconfident and go crazy till 24 and then like keju will try to go full national in 2024 not realizing India is different khela than WB, har jagah bam nahin chalte. While on the other hand this served as another reminder to BJP that don't expect things to go smooth for 2024 and in no way shape or form let your guard down.\n\nIf they heard and will reevaluate, we have a good shot at 2024, If not god help us all, PM milega ya to bam banane waala ya aalo se sona banane wala, Tikait ji honge Krishi mantri, God knows who keju will blame then, but I have faith in him, he will find someone. \n\nDo share your inputs and thoughts if you have read so far."<br />Author: 'agumeis'<br />id: 'nxxp9j'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Maulan√† secular Modi what are you doing?'<br />Body: "I will not vote for Modi of he approves Pfizer and Moderna. \n\nThere are many reports saying Pfizer and Moderna will be approved before July. \n\nWhat the f√∫ck Modi?

In Sraddhas, however, that are performed in honour of the Pitris, persons for their own good should make offerings of diverse kinds of meat.\n\nSo there is no verse in the form that is spread on the Internet. It is Ahimsa Paramo Dharmah only. And this makes sense. Because it is non-violence only that is preached throughout all the Shastras and Bhagavan says in Gita that non-violence is one of the divine qualities. \n\nHOWEVER,\n\nThere is a similar idea but expressed differently. It appears in Ishvara Gita, which is part of Kurma Purana. \n\nAhinsaayaH paro dharmo naastyhinsaa param sukham |\n\nvidhinaa yaa bhaveddhinsaa tvahinsaiv prakirtitaa ||\n\nThere is no other virtue better than Non-Violence, nor is there any other comfort better than the same. The Violence, which is performed as per the provisions of the Scripture(as last resort for dealing with extreme injustice, and not for own personal ego or perpetrating injustice) - is also considered as Non-Violence.\n\n- Ishvara Gita 11.5\n\nOne can see the difference. It doesn\'t say "Hinsa is allowed for Dharma", which is a vague statement and can include all types of violence. Rather it says "Hinsa as performed per the provisions of Scripture" is allowed which is much more sensible. Otherwise someone can be arbitrarily cruel with their enemies and say it is for Dharma, which is a dangerous implication. Scripture would never be vague about something so important, hence why the Ishvara Gita verse is much more sensible. \n\nMoreover it says "violence as per scriptures is non-violence" hence this is considered Ahimsa only. One can understand why this is the case - if you let an evil tyrant do whatever they want, then sitting silent is not non-violent it is actually violent because you are allowing that person to hurt others. \n\nWhat are scriptural injunctions then? There is one powerful one - \n\n‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡•á‡§∑‡•Å ‡§ï‡§æ‡§≤‡•á‡§∑‡•Å ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Æ‡§®‡•Å‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§∞ ‡§Ø‡•Å‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§ö |\n\n‡§Æ‡§Ø‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§™‡§ø‡§§‡§Æ‡§®‡•ã‡§¨‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Æ‡•á‡§µ‡•à‡§∑‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∂‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç || 7||\n\nBG 8.7:\xa0Therefore, always remember Me and also do your duty of fighting the war. With mind and intellect surrendered to Me, you will definitely attain Me; of this, there is no doubt.\n\n- [Bhagavad Gita 8.7](https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/8/verse/7)\n\nSo meditating on Bhagavan Vasudeva as explained by the Sruti, Smriti, and Guru in a pure state of mind, is not an act of violence and as Arjuna did it is Yoga. \n\nSo when quoting the verse, quote the Ishvara Gita one rather than the popular one for the latter does not exist in the scripture and the former is more sensible and clear. \n\nJai Sita Rama!'<br />Author: 'jai_sri_ram108'<br />id: 'nxfo82'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm üïâÔ∏è</li><li>Title: 'Need some help.'<br />Body: 'I really have some free time now and am really intrested in learning sanskrit.

There were around 150 people in just my batch and I think there were 3-4 batches ig, all of our vaccinations were updated on CoWIN by the hospital immediately after we took the vaccine. I did have fever the day I got the vaccine and yesterday, but today I am all well and good after taking paracetamol. No serious side effects at all, most of the people who took the vaccine were well and good or they had mild fever like me, so fear-mongering by anti-vaxxer libbus was false.  \n\n\nAnother interesting part about this vaccination drive was that the hospital (pretty big and reputed in Bengaluru) were ready to vaccinate people in huge apartment complexes rather than put vaccines in their own hospital, they had probably reserved many vaccines for all of us, how do I know this? Because when my parents used to call this hospital, they were giving vaccination dates that didn‚Äôt coincide with our vaccination drives. From what I‚Äôve heard, many private hospitals in Bengaluru are doing similar thing in many other places around the city, many of them even going to the poor/slum areas also.\n\nWhich made me think how things in rural areas going on‚Ä¶ Are hospitals doing the same thing there? How feasible are such kind of community wise vaccination type in rural areas as of now considering the vaccine shortage? I personally think hospitals should go from house to house and try their best to vaccinate people like the pulse polio drive instead of expecting people from the rural areas to take their time to book appointments on CoWin app, which I‚Äôm bet half of them don‚Äôt understand how it works with all the OTP and stuff.\n\nTell me your vaccine experiences and how do you feel should vaccination drives be carried out, community wise or people coming to the hospital and getting it done?'<br />Author: 'oatskheer'<br />id: 'nwdmhi'<br />Flair :Vikasine Nahi Lagayenge :inj:</li><li>Title: "Greedy government officers take to politics for exploitation, to become minister and exploit, that's all.

This might be because the lyrics were changed after the release and the the Times channel forgot to reupload the edited one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConclusion (acc. to me) --&gt; I think lyricist was forced to change the lyrics of the song to make it sh@r!a compliant by someone from the top because it is h@r@m in Izl@m to leave the religion. Murtad or mulhid or kufr is considered punishable by de@th, and this lyrics was maybe seen as promoting apostasy in Iz!@m. So it was made sharia compliant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think guys?

She is a home maker herself and says that she never felt like it has been forced on her and many women are okay with being housewives.

That, in itself, is a clue. But it‚Äôs not the whole story.    \nMore importantly, hundreds of Indian soldiers have died fighting well-armed terrorists, but have never ever slipped into raising levels of force. Civilians have little idea of the sheer grit needed to ensure peace in Kashmir for those who really want it. Notice also that while Kashmiri Pandits were forced out, there are no Muslim Kashmiri refugees anywhere, unlike the [5.7 million](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/11/1077332) Palestinians outside of their land. That counts for something. In an ideal world, neither conflict should exist. But as this account indicates, there are those who work tirelessly to ensure that peace doesn‚Äôt return to Kashmir. There‚Äôs money in it for some, prestige for others, and sometimes a whole career in academics. That‚Äôs the simple, ugly truth. It‚Äôs all about money. Just follow that trail. There‚Äôs a lot more here than just a Pakistani spending spree.'<br />Author: 'mini2mimi2'<br />id: 'nv3nr7'<br />Flair :National üì∞</li></ol>
