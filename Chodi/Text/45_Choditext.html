<li>Title: 'Violent Outbursts of Hindus'<br />Body: 'I saw a lot of my brothers/sisters(hopefully) expressing their paranoia about Hindus not being United and how this could lead to eventual doom, the fact of the matter is that our philosophy has taught us not hit until we are hit. If you see the history of communal riots in India (Only talking about Hindu Muslim Riots), most of the times Hindus had no option but to fight for themselves from a ravenous frenzy that was being cooked in the so called "ghettos". \n\nIt\'s very important for us to understand that most of the riots that took place in India happened when BJP wasn\'t in power, except for Gujrat. Most of these riots had overwhelming amounts of Muslim deaths and most of these riots were triggered by Muslims, that\'s a fact which only the left/Marxist/Islamists will deny. Think about this , even then Muslims talked about Umma, even now they talk about Umma, such braggadocios attitude has always bit the community really hard. Now I\'m trying to show you a perspective, we have put in centre a guy who is the guy people accuse of doing Gujrat. Now think about this, if something major that happens in terms of provocation against the Hindus, you can\'t imagine the backlash that would be unleashed, it\'s unimaginable. Radical Muslims are living in Fool\'s paradise if they think that this is the 14-15th century. If BJP is in Centre Hindu feels more secure and that\'s why there isn\'t muscle flexing, one should never reveal our strengths to the enemy, but, remember if BJP goes out of power and if again there is mischief, Hindus will come in swarms to wreak havoc, Islamists know this and that\'s why they try to divide us, but fortunately they don\'t affect the demographic that actually matters. \n\nDon\'t get distressed. We are on the right track, do your bit, argue with the people who try to pull your identity down, do your bit. We shall see a Hindu Rashtra in our lifetime with a ram mandir.\n\nToday\'s Read : Meerut Riots 1987\n\nJai Shri Ram. \n\nGood Night.'<br />Author: 'Resurgence28'<br />id: 'f0wcfm'<br />Flair :High IQ</li>

She thought, she\'s learning something new and still continued.\n\nI sensed something was fishy.\n\nThen later on she saw my mother isn\'t resisting her "preaching" so she went a step further.\n\nShe started insulting hindu gods right before my mother.\nShe pointed at my mother said things like "your gods are all fake. They are devils"\n\nAll of her "preachings" were coming to me through my mother.\n\nSo I sat down and explained WHAT is hinduism and what\'s yoga, that hinduism is not a religion, that Krishna and Rama were mystics and yogis who worked towards enhancing the consciousness of the people around them.\n\nAny being who transcended the physical and became enlightened was considered a \'deva\'. There\'s no such thing as GOD in this divine culture.\n\nAll of this was new to her. She used to think ALL the religions r same. She did not knew how open minded, tolerant and scientific is hinduism and how it\'s completely different from rice bags and pissfuls.\n\nShe talked about these scientific aspects of hinduism that I told here to the tutor.\n\nThe tutor was triggered and tried to explain how Jesus was above everyone and she wanted to talk to ME to \'save me from ignorance\'.\n\nNow this is funny,\n\nWhen I met her, she was in the debate mode. I was chilled because I had facts and logic.\n\nShe initially talked for a while explaining how I\'m on the wrong path. I listened carefully.\n\nThen I did something virat.\n\nI asked, "Do you think Bible is inaccurate and distorted even after thousands of years?"\n\nShe replied, "Impossible. This is the word of God. The one and only"\n\nThen I asked, "So how old is this creation that we call as earth according to Bible?"\n\nShe thought for a moment and the  replied, 10,000 years ago God created the world in 7 days.\n\nI pulled out my phone and showed her... \n\nThe image of sanskrit carved coins which are about 12,000 years old.\n\nThe image of a shiva idol that is about 28,450 years old.\n\nImage of excavations of an ancient Hindu civilization Dwarka which is about 32,000 years old.\n\nShe was done.\n\nThen she argued by saying this is all fake. It\'s not possible. This is propaganda to defame Christianity, blah blah blah... \n\nI knew she was done and had no arguments left and was pouring out the frustration... \n\nWhen she became quite, I did something more virat.\n\nI said, "calm down. Take the inner engineering yoga program by Sadhguru. That will take away all your frustrations"\n\nShe became mad and I left.\n\nThankfully my mother was not there to watch this.\n\nMy mother had already left the class before this happened.'<br />Author: 'johnkarter767612'<br />id: 'f0uak8'<br />Flair :Rice Bag</li>

Me very liberandu, dissing Hinduism and Indian culture because me heavily influenced by Bollywood and Western culture. But me going to mosque and church to show my secularism. My dad warn me not to go to church coz they\'d convert me to Christianity. My elder bro warn me not to trust any k2a and stay away from them. But me no care. Me believe in muh peace.... muh secularism. \n\nMe join PU college (Higher Secondary education for State Board). Me become best friend with a k2a. K2a very friendly with me. Me and k2a always sit together in class. Me enter 12th grade. New girl join our college. Girl very innocent, very quite, very humble and studious. Me instantly like her on first day first sight. But me very shy. Me no tell her. Me talk to my k2a best friend. K2a tell me he ready to help me get the girl. Me very innocent so trusted the k2a friend. Me got busy with my studies and life. Few months later me find out my k2a friend proposed the girl and is in relationship and he no tell me. Me ask him why you no tell me? He reply with the most cliche dialogue, "I didn\'t want to ruin our friendship". Me not angry on him but me decided not to speak with him again. Me graduated 12th. By now she know I like her.\n\nMe and the girl got seat in the same college. K2a got seat in a different college. K2a cheat the girl and in relationship with another girl. Girl heart broken and in pain. But I stay away from them coz I no want to hurt her more (me realise later this was a big mistake). But k2a doesn\'t stop. K2a comes back in her life again and breaks her heart again. K2a completely sucks the life out of her. It was monday and me decide to talk to her. But me had 1 week off from college. Me had to wait for next monday to talk to her in coll. Next day, in the evening, me suddenly start feeling my stomach churn and getting very bad vibes. Me call my parents and ask about their health. Me friend ask me, "What\'s wrong? Why so dull and sad looking?". Me tell him me have no idea. Me just getting very bad vibes since evening. Me receive call from female friend at 10 PM, she say the girl no more! The girl fell from 3rd floor and die on spot at evening. Police tell it was accident. But me and friends know it was no accident. Me and K2a attend her funeral. K2a blames others for her death. Me keep my calm and let go of him. I cry for days. \n\nMe realise k2a no mercy, no shame, no guilt, no loyalty and no trustworthy.\n\nMe now graduated with a degree. K2a moved on with his life but me still love her. Me decided me no want relationship with other girls. Now me just cherishing her memories!\n\nPS 1: Me advice to bakchods, no hide your feelings. If you like a girl, tell her before it\'s too late.\n\nPS 2: Me no want to politicise this topic and hence me no reply to any comment.'<br />Author: 'code_god'<br />id: 'f0rra7'<br />Flair :Rant</li>

Some of them ABSOLUTELY PROVE other religions wrong.\n\nRecently discovered Dwarka civilization is said to be around 32,000 years old(some say it's 13,000).\n\nA shiva idol is found which is 28,450 years old.\n\nSanskrit carved coins are being discovered that are about 12,000 years old.\n\nThis clearly is against the beliefs of Islam and Christianity which say that the entire creation is only like 10,000 years old and their was no evolution.\n\nPlus people like Praveen Mohan have clearly proved that those ancient people in this land had high tech gadgets. He clearly proves they used advanced technology.\n\nThe Christians and Muslims knew that someday the rich advanced ancient hindu culture will be revealed and the world will know about it and in no time their entire religion will collapse due to this.\n\nThus, they already planned everything ahead of time. They planned how to defame the hindu culture by showing our gods as evil. They have also connected the dots by showing the city 'high tech' in the game.\n\nEnough of this bullshit.\n\nIf there can be undercover jihadis, urban naxals and missionaries, then there can be undercover yogis too.\n\nThey will attack undercover, we will protect undercover.\n\nSPREAD THE INDIAN CULTURE LIKE FIRE! Show everyone how scientific was the hindu culture. Promote people like Praveen Mohan.\n\nWhen the world was busy conquering and killing people, we were discovering yoga, Ayurveda and striving towards enlightenment/mukti.\n\nJust fuking spread it!!!"<br />Author: 'johnkarter767612'<br />id: 'eysdu9'<br />Flair :Jihad</li>

But because I belong to a retinue of people who like to jerk off their pay masters, I'd go to any extent to project a culture as violent and intolerant, that very culture or identity which gave your ancestors, Zoroastrians, refuge.

<li>Title: "Next time some Librandu talks about removing CAA, remind them they're talking about repealing citizenship of 60,000+ people who fled their homes leaving everything behind to escape Islamic persecution."<br />Body: 'Next time some Librandu talks about Muslim inclusion in CAA remind them how equality can only be of equals and Muslim refugees from Islamic countries are not equal to Non Muslim refugees from Islamic Countries.\n\nNext time some Librandu tries to equate Ahmedis and Shias with Hindu Refugees, ask him about where are the Muslim Refugees from Pakistan? You can see Hindu Refugees all around Delhi and Rajasthan but I don\'t see a single Muslim Refuge family. That speaks for the differences in levels of persecution they face, and why they can\'t be equated.\n\nNext time some Librandu says what\'s to make sure Hindu refugees underwent persecution, remind them no SC/ST is asked if their ancestors underwent persecution before being given reservation. It is preassumed they did, based upon research, facts and generalization. Same is the case with the said communities from the neighboring Islamic countries.\n\nNext time some Librandu says India has nothing to do with other country\'s minorities remind them that stated communities of Pakistan never voted for Pakistan. We alienated them, we owe a moral responsibility towards their well being, that\'s what Gandhi believed as well.\n\nNext time some Librandu says India cannot discriminate based upon religion remind that about all the reservation, schemes and benefits that so called "religious minorities" get.\n\nThe fact is none of the above stated issues are their actual issue with CAA.\n\nWe need to look at the bigger picture to recognize what their problem is. Abrogation of 370, Ram Mandir, CAA and upcoming UCC, NRC and PCB have created a pro Hindutva image in the shallow minds. But it\'s stupid, because honestly, all these steps are very much needed and have little to do with anti Muslim sentiments. If anything, most of them are pro Muslim because they help their community to disconnect from the chains of orthodox Islam.\n\nWhat we need to do is not spread the idea that Modi Govt is pro Hindu and anti Muslim, because by that we are always gonna be on the "evil" side in a shallow typical Indian\'s mind.\n\nWhat we need to do is paint a Pro Humanitarian image of the Govt that\'s actually helping it\'s people irrespective of community to move on, break the chains, and develop.\n\nYou know why Libbies rule twitter and Tumblr? Because they always make their opposition into an evil guy and take the moral high ground. We need to do the same.\n\nEnde.'<br />Author: 'Tatti_Dude'<br />id: 'eynfrh'<br />Flair :Rant</li>

So we must appease them and worship them by all means so that they do not kill us. \n\nI used to hear this theory a lot in my childhood. My grandfather said that Gandhi was the father of this theory (though I am not sure about that).\n\nDo you think saying good things to them prevents anything? We kept our mouth shut and offered them love and compassion even after tragedies like 9/11, 26/11, Parlament attacks, showimg love for Afzal Guru and Yakub Menon, Charlie Jebdo and what not. After every terrorist attack, in at least 1 column of librandu newspapers, you would always find sympathy for them. Some sympathised even for the terrorists telling that how they were brainwashed and how they are not to blame for this mess. So are they that much volatile and mentally weak that one round of Jihadi brainwashing and Friday prayers make them this violent? And what about those who willingly join terror outfits? Who made them love terrorist ideals so mucb that they would leave everything and join these outfits? Malala Yusufazai also told something similar if I remember correctly, "The more we talk about them, the more they will cause harm to us..." So these assholes will do whatever they want, even if we criticize them a little then they will become suicide bombers in 2 seconds and kill everyone else. And we will still offer them sympathy. There was a half deaf french Mulla in the police force who attacked policemen because he was told to behave well with women. Who radicalised him in that incident? Al Queda? LeT? Zakir Naik? These cunts needs some swrious amounts of EQ testing before they set their feet on amy civilized nation.Consider the amoumt of shit we and also other religions have faced without reacting. Did Jews become suicide bombers after they were liberated from Nazi camps? Did Americans start goimg to Middle East or Pakistan and blowing themsleves up after 9/11? Did we do a terrorist attack on Pakistan after the enormous shit they have done to us? And has love, compassion and sympathy ever really worked against them? So why can\'t we ever speak the truth? And still some librandus love their dick. My mind is rattled after hearing these arguments from r/Indiaspeaks. It is as if the libtards had understood they can\'t win and are giving the most baseless answer ever. \n\nI am fucking angry now.

I am not for exporting arms but ateast we can make good weapons under Make in India. Further we have a bigass budget for defense ( obviously we live between Golden Crescent and Triangle), still it can be reduced if we start making them in india.

Whenever they loose war on one front, they attack through amother front to save their face and then start prepeating this protests. Can you see how the face  of the protests is changing so frequently? Kunal Kamra has actually given some much needed ground to them. As Arnab was pretty much hated so some people might support them.

But it has been simplified and stereotyped to be just “karma” in English.\n\nBasically, it gives favourable/unfavourable/neutral reactions to previously committed actions, whether of this life or of a previous life(body).\n\nIt selects 2 types of living entities for giving any reaction –\n\n1. The one(s) who has to be given a favourable/unfavourable/neutral reaction, as per their previous action.\n2. And another one(s) who has a personal desire to perform such an act to someone.\n\nNow for example: If someone as per his previous actions, needs to die by a head wound, then his karmic reaction will make him meet another being, such as a gangster who has a personal desire to bash someone’s head. So as per the karmic destiny when they both meet, the gangster bashes the victim’s head. In this way karma achieves two goals at once. It makes someone get what they deserve and makes another achieve their desire.\n\nEventually in the same manner the gangster will also face a negative reaction for killing someone in such a manner. Similarly, there would be a favourable reaction if instead of bashing someone’s head he gives in charity.\n\nAnd in this way the cycle goes on, of good/bad/neutral actions and favourable/unfavourable/neutral reactions of those actions, getting out of this cycle is a major goal.\n\nReactions are received through 3 ways -\n\n1. Reactions from one’s own body and mind (Eg. Obesity, depression, born with unfavourable, ugly features or joy, peace, beauty etc.)\n2. Reactions from other living entities (Eg. A dog bite, malaria, humiliation, crime, terrorism or an unexpected favour from someone, sudden fame etc.)\n3. Reactions from nature (Earthquake, heat waves, tornadoes, hurricanes or a soothing rain, pleasant winds etc.)\n\nIn this philosophy, even a foetus is not innocent, and if that living entity(in the foetus) murdered someone in the past, he may also be murdered(aborted) in a similar manner in the womb itself. Of course, the mother, doctor etc. would still be criminals as explained above, and would similarly face negative reactions, like being born as a chicken and crushed to death.\n\nIn this philosophy, all situations, including you reading this text, is a reaction of your previous actions. Just like one has a bank balance, the currency for good reactions in this philosophy is piety. If one has a huge balance of piety from the previous life, they may be able to commit a lot of crimes and would still not be caught for a long time. Similarly someone who has a huge negative balance or someone who has sinned a lot, will continue suffering even if he performs small pious actions, until his negative balance is nullified. Similarly, a person with a huge balance of piety receives favourable birth, senses, bodily features, parents, family, teachers, friends, relationships etc. However how he reacts to such “gifts” is not decided by karma, but by him, this is how he manufactures new reactions while continuously acting in this world, and he gets one type of body after another. Once the balance of piety is finished he will fall down immediately from his superior position, which can happen in this life or the next depending upon his balance. A person due to past actions may receive a beautiful body and attract a lot of women, but by abusing his body, his piety will be rapidly lost, and once it’s lost, he will face hellish conditions. Hence, no matter who it is, there position is impermanent unless they keep doing piety and not misuse the favours they receive, which most don’t do, as most people abuse and misuse their position in life deluded by the promise of sense pleasures.\n\nRelated extra info:\n\nLet’s look at how birth and death are defined in the Vedic Scriptures: “When the eyes lose their power to see colour or form due to morbid affliction of the optic nerve, the sense of sight becomes deadened. The living entity, who is the seer of both the eyes and the sight, loses his power of vision. In the same way, when the physical body, the place where perception of material objects occurs, is rendered incapable of perceiving, that is known as death. When one begins to falsely view the physical body as one’s very self, that is called birth.\n\nIn this way the living entity(soul) gets a new suitable body with a material mind and senses, according to his past fruitive activities(karma). When the reaction of his activities performed in the previous body(ies) comes to an end, that end is called death, and when a chain of reactions to past material actions begins, that beginning is called birth.”\n\nThere are 3 shells of each being’s material existence -\n\n1. Hardware:  The macro(sthuːl) body(shəriːr), the commonly visible body with limbs and various organs, including the brain.\n\n2. Software : The subtle(suːkSm) body(shəriːr), a highly complex &amp; subtle, but still material body, which acts as a connecting interface, which makes the macro body act. Consisting mainly of the element of mind(different from brain), and an element of “I”. When one dreams one acts inside the subtle body itself. Sometimes seen as a ghost or apparition.\n\n3. User: Soul(aːtm or the self), the actual you, who remains as a witness of the macro body, and activities of the subtle body and also of absence of both such as in deep dreamless sleep, where he forgets all such material concepts.\n\nDue to ignorance (the cause of which is a completely different topic) the soul falsely identifies with the subtle body, and then the macro body, and performs material actions. By each act, a set of sense perceptions such as visions, sounds, touch, smells, etc. form impressions on the subtle body, and the subtle body is “coloured” with fruitive activity. When death occurs, the subtle body is still there to enjoy or suffer.\n\nSometimes when someone commits suicide they destroy the macro body before its scheduled time and thus they neither get a new macro body nor is their old macro body available to be enjoyed. Thus, they have to pass their time only in the subtle body as some ghost or apparition. Where their desires remain as it as, but there is no way to fulfill them, which is why sometimes these subtle bodies as ghosts desperately try to enter the macro bodies of other’s to fulfill their desires. Because animals and other lower beings don’t have a greater intelligence, there activities are forced only by instinct to never destroy their own macro bodies before their time. That is to say, they are unable to transcend any such natural laws, that is something which only humans can do. Thus, animal ghosts, apparitions are rarely seen.\n\nAn example of a complex karmic reaction: Dhritra-rashtra asked Krishna, “I had 100 sons. All of them were killed. Why?”\n\nKrishna replied, “50 lifetimes ago, you were a hunter. While hunting, you tried to shoot a male bird. It flew away. In anger, you ruthlessly slaughtered the 100 baby birds in the nest.\n\nFather-bird had to watch in helpless agony. Because you caused that father-bird the pain of seeing the death of his 100 sons, you too had to bear the pain of your 100 sons dying.\n\nDhritarastra said, but why did I have to wait for fifty lifetimes?” Krishna answered, “You were accumulating \' Punya\'(Piety) during the last fifty lifetimes to get 100 sons - Because that requires a lot of Punya. Then you got the reaction for the \'Paap\' (sin) that you have done fifty lifetimes ago.”*\n\nRelated verses:\n\n“While acting in a particular macro body the living entity labours under the bodily conception of “I am this, I am that.  My duty is this, and therefore I shall do it.” These are all mental impressions, and all these activities are temporary; nonetheless, God again and again gives the living entity chances to execute all his material concoctions. Thus, he is provided a new macro body.”\n\nWhile acting in this material macro body you’re not only suffering or enjoying the results of past fruitive activities but you’re also manufacturing new reactions by reacting to these achieved situations. Thus, you’re manufacturing for yourself a particular type of life and situations to be experienced in the next body.\n\n“One can understand the mental or conscious position of a living entity by the activities of two kinds of senses — the knowledge-acquiring senses and the executive senses. Similarly, by the mental condition or consciousness of a person, one can understand his position in the previous life."\n\nHence, birth by birth, the living entity evolves or devolves his mind unless he is ready for liberation.\n\n“Sometimes we suddenly experience something that was never experienced in the present body by sight or hearing. Sometimes we see such things suddenly in dreams. The living entity, who has a subtle mental covering, develops all kinds of thoughts and images because of his previous body. Take this from me as certain. There is no possibility of concocting anything mentally without having perceived it in the previous body."\n\n"The mind is the cause of the living entity’s attaining a certain type of body in accordance with his association with material nature. According to one’s mental composition, one can understand what the living entity was in his past life as well as what kind of body he will have in the future. Thus, the mind indicates the past and future bodies.”\n\n“Sometimes in a dream we see something never experienced or heard of in this life, but all these incidents have been experienced at different times, in different places and in different conditions.”\n\n"The mind of the living entity continues to exist in various gross(macro) bodies, and according to one’s desires for sense gratification, the mind records different thoughts. In the mind these appear together in different combinations; therefore, these images sometimes appear as things never seen or never heard before.”\n\n"When the living entity is in deep sleep, when he faints, when there is some great shock on account of severe loss, at the time of death, or when the body temperature is very high, the movement of the life air is arrested. At that time the living entity loses knowledge of identifying the body with the self.”\n\n“By virtue of the processes of the subtle body, the living entity develops and gives up gross bodies. This is known as the transmigration of the soul. Thus, the soul becomes subjected to different types of so-called enjoyment, lamentation, fear, happiness and unhappiness. As long as we desire to enjoy sense gratification, we create material activities. When the living entity acts in the material field, he enjoys the senses, and while enjoying the senses, he creates another series of material activities. In this way the living entity becomes entrapped as a conditioned soul.”*\n\n“Whatever state of being, one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail.”\n\n“The living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions of life from one body to another, as the air carries aromas.” For example, men attached to their wives, or other women become women themselves in their next birth. Most present women were men too attached to sex in their past lives, as per this philosophy. This is why women sometimes are considered spiritually fallen beings in this philosophy, who destroy their chance of liberation for better sex pleasure as women.\n\n“Physical Effects of Unexpiated Offences committed in Previous Lives: Evil-minded men suffer disfigurement,—some from evil deeds committed during the present life and others from those committed in former lives. The stealer of gold has disfigured nails; the drinker of wine, black teeth; the slayer of a Brāhmaṇa, consumption; and the violator of his preceptor’s bed, a disfigured skin;—(49) the informer, a foul-smelling nose; the false caluminator, a foul-smelling mouth; the stealer of grains, a deficiency of limbs; and the adulterator, an excess of limbs;—(50) the stealer of food, dyspepsia; the stealer of words, dumbness; the stealer of clothes, leucoderma; and the stealer of horse, lameness.—(51) It is thus that idiots, the dumb, the blind, the deaf and deformed men, despised by righteous men, are born, on account of particular acts.—(52)”*  The list is endless...\n\nOf-course, the knowledge in these scriptures is very vast, and I have not covered even a fraction of it. But I hope this all will be useful to those genuinely fortunate. Thank you.'<br />Author: 'NNNNNY'<br />id: 'evzs64'<br />Flair :Research</li>

<li>Title: 'Casteism in Hinduism (Important)'<br />Body: "Some people believe Casteism is part of Hinduism and bharaman, kshatriya, sudra, vasiya are caste but they are not\nThey are qualities (Gunas)\nIt doesn't have anything to do with birth\nAnyone can become any of them\nI am giving Verses of Bhagwad Gita (As it is one of the most authentic Text of Hindus and It's widely accepted)\n\nGunas are mentioned in bhagwad Gita\n\nBhagvad Gita 18.41:\xa0The duties of the Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras—are distributed according to their qualities, in accordance with their\xa0guṇas\xa0(and not by birth).\nhttps://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/18/verse/41\nBhagvad Gita 18.42:\xa0Tranquility, restraint, austerity, purity, patience, integrity, knowledge, wisdom, and belief in a hereafter—these are the intrinsic qualities of work for Brahmins.\nhttps://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/18/verse/42\nBhagvad Gita 18.43:\xa0Valor, strength, fortitude, skill in weaponry, resolve never to retreat from battle, large-heartedness in charity, and leadership abilities, these are the natural qualities of work for Kshatriyas.\nhttps://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/18/verse/43\nBhagvad Gita 18.44:\xa0Agriculture, dairy farming, and commerce are the natural works for those with the qualities of Vaishyas. Serving through work is the natural duty for those with the qualities of Shudras.\nhttps://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/18/verse/44\n\nIf you are a seeker teacher or guru you are bharaman \nIf you are solder, diplomat, government official you are a shatria\nIf you are business man, farmer you are a vaiya\nIf you are a labour you are a shudra\nIt doesn't mean you can only have same quality\nYou can change your Profession anytime\n\nTheir are some historical examples like Parshurama cursed Karna because he was a kshatriya (warrior) and lied that he is a bharaman (Teacher) but Parshurama only give bharamastra teachings to bharaman (Teacher, Guru) so it can't be misused in War.\nThe important thing to note here is Karna was born in a Shudra family (I know he is son of surya) But according to People he is shudra because no body knows he is son of Kunti \nStill Parshurama gave him Curse for being kshatriya (Because he have warrior qualities) not because he was born in a Shudra family.\nAlso some people say Dronacharya is casteist because of wrong teaching of Mahabharat\n\nKarna was a student of Drona and was taught with others. Only Drona did not teach him Brahmastra. That he gave to Arjuna when he passed the crocodile test. Seeing Arjuna topper in his class Karna who was also friend of Duryodhana went to Drona and directly asked it to compete with Arjuna. Now just as it is Institute decision to bestow scholarship on worthy student , similarly it is Guru decision to give such weapons. He wanted to protect Arjuna as he was to some extent aware of Duryodhana intentions and his friendship with karna. Drona then tells that only who has observed vows of Brahmin(compassion, truth, austerities) and qualities of kshtriya(protecting weaker people and honor) can use such weapons. People take this criteria as related to caste but what he meant was qualities. Karna then left him and went to Parshurama.\nProof of this relationship is in MB Adi Parva, Vana parva where Karna states Drona as his mentor with Parshurama and Shanti Parva too.\n\nSome people believe Manu Smriti is casteist\n\nNowhere in Manu Smriti it's mentioned that only you will be bharaman if you born in a bharaman family\nIn manu smriti Steps are given to goverment so they can manage civilisations not restrict anyone to change quality\n\nAlso Manu Smriti even allow interquality marriages\nBharaman can even marry shudra according to manu smriti\n\n\nAlso The original Manu Smriti which is lost contains which contains 1lakh verses\nWhich was reduced to 8k and now only 4k verses are available\nSo current version is not even summary of original.\n\nNow some people claim that if it's not part of Hinduism then why people do that?\n\nAnswer) Because people are corrupted after 1000 years of Islamic rule and casteism does exist in Islam\n\nCasteism started in India after 1000AD\n\nIts just a social problem and can very easily be resolved just if you give clearity to people that Our sacred text say somthing else.\nI did it with my whole friend section my family my relatives\n\nIf any of you disagree with me Comment section is open ask anything i will answer\n\n\nReplying to some idiots who belive its Hinduism philosophy\nPlease upvote my comment here and downvote the thread\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/EXHINDU/comments/eturpb/discrimination_on_the_basis_of_caste/"<br />Author: 'fringehindu'<br />id: 'ev1ek8'<br />Flair :Research</li>

In any case his birth, if not disreputable in its origin, is certainly unnatural.”\n\n“This murder of Vali is the greatest blot on the character of Rama. It was a crime which was thoroughly unprovoked, for Vali had no quarrel with Rama. It was a most cowardly act, for Vali was unarmed. It was a planned and premeditated murder.”\n\nAmbedkar on Ravana:\n“Ravana was a Buddhist and considered by Dalits as a great hero. He did so much for Sita, who herself had praised Ravana. But the Hindu scriptures have called him a Rakshasa attributing all evils to him.”\n\nAnd there is much more. The names that bhadwa calls Bhagwan Rama boil my blood. I refuse to quote them here. People who doubt me can read “Riddles in Hinduism”. \n\nAny Hindu who defends ambedkar is a qtiya of the highest order.

<li>Title: 'Balwant of Gujranwalla, and his 7 daughters ..... 1947'<br />Body: 'Link to article :  [https://vashisharma.com/father-well-and-7-daughters-why-india-needs-caa-1/](https://vashisharma.com/father-well-and-7-daughters-why-india-needs-caa-1/) \n\n \n\n&gt;During semester end at IIT, I picked fight with a senior. He was a *Malang* (didn’t care about world). I said – “money is everything”. He replied – “Didn’t you have it in Gujranwala? Why did you run away from there? And what’s the guaranty that you won’t run away from Amritsar 40 years later?” I was furious. I had no idea what he was saying.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Next week, I had a train to Amritsar in night. I was going home in semester break. The Malang came to see me off to station. “You got everything in life. But.. Ask your grandfather. Could money save his family?”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Train arrived. Malang returned. But I was stunned. What did he know about my grandfather that I didn’t? The train started moving.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I was home next day. Big beautiful house. Loving parents, but always under stress of business. I am going to meet Nanaji tomorrow, I told Mom. “What happened? Stay with us for some days. Will go together to meet Nanaji. He is ill”, she told.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I was in Jalandhar next day.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I : Nanaji, what happened in 1947? \xa0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Grandfather : Nothing, Puttar (son). What happened?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I : Where are your siblings currently?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;G: I don’t have any. I was lone child of my parents.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I : How come? In your times, parents used to have 10-12 kids on an average. Why didn’t your parents have more?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;G : Haha! They were great planners! Take rest now.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Next day, I was playing video game in my room. Nanaji came, sat besides me.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Grandfather : Playing Contra?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I : Yes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;G: Have you seen 7 colours of sun-rays ever?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I : No.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;G : Let me show you, come to terrace.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We both went up. Beautiful sunshine. Sun was about to set.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;G : Do you see the saffron?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I : Yes, whole sky is saffron!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;G : There are 7 colours in this saffron. But they will be gone soon. There will be darkness all over.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I : That’s natural. It happens every evening.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;G : Hmm. It happens once in centuries too. Do you know I have named 7 rays of sun as – Lajjo, Rajjo, Bhaggo, Paro, Gayo, Isho, and Urmi?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I : Why?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;G : There was a Balwant Khatri in Gujranwala, a rich landlord. Big Haveli was among largest in Gujranwala. He had 7 daughters and a son from wife Prabhavati Devi.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Baldev (son) – 20  \nLajwanti – 19  \nRajwati – 17  \nBhagvati – 16  \nParvati – 15  \nGayatri – 13  \nIshvari – 11  \nUrmila – 9  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Theirs was a beautiful family. A rich Punjabi Hindu Khatri family. They were looking for suitable grooms for Lajjo and Rajjo. However, something was not right in Punjab. \xa0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Barrister Jinnah had declared Direct Action Day for Pakistan. Hindu-Sikhs knew that Gandhi Ji’s ideals can’t be defeated by some miscreants. After all Hindu-Sikhs sang\xa0*Avval Allah Noor upaayaa*. Hindu-Sikhs used to sing Baba Bulleh Shah, Baba Farid’s poetry and visit Sufi Mazars. After all Gujranwala was full of Jatt, Gujjar and Rajput Muslims. How could they – the blood brothers – harm their own blood?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Soon, the news of massacre of hundreds of Hindu-Sikhs started coming from nearby places. Mobs chanting\xa0*Allahu Akbar*\xa0and\xa0*Pakistan ka matlab kya La ilaah illillah*\xa0were heard shouting – “no woman of Kafir will go to India, we will take them”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It was morning of 18th Sep, 1947. A Sikh postman almost barged into the Haveli shouting – “Lala Ji, leave the place. They are coming for your daughters. Lajjo will be Salim’s. Sheikh Muhammad will take Rajwati. Bhagwati will go to…” Lala Balwant slapped him hard. What rubbish? Salim is Mukhtar Bhai’s son. Mukhtar Bhai is like our family.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“Mukhtar Bhai only is leading the mob, Lala Ji. All Hindu-Sikhs are fleeing to India. Will go in lots of 300-400 people in an hour. Get family to city Gurudwara fast”, the Sikh shouted and fled.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lala Ji rushed to Prabhavati who was 7 months pregnant. She was in tears already. She overheard everything.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Prabhavati : We need to go, Lala Ji.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant : We are going nowhere. Sardar is lying. Mukhtar Bhai can’t do that. Ideas of Gandhi Ji can’t be defeated.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Prabhavati : It’s not time to discuss ideas. We must go. I have asked daughters to pack jewellery and papers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant : But Mukhtar Bhai… I have to talk to him.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Prabhavati : He came last month when you were not home. He told Salim likes Lajjo and wanted to do Nikah with her. Lajjo told that Salim eve-teases her with his friends. She has stopped going out because of him.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant : Why didn’t you tell this earlier? I could have talked to Mukhtar Bhai.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Prabhavati : You are too naive. He himself wanted to take Lajjo for Salim. Now he is coming to take her by force. Let’s leave.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;City Gurudwara was full of Hindu-Sikhs. Men with swords and spears were guarding Gurudwara boundaries. Gujranwala, known for wrestlers, had Akhadas in many temples and Gurudwaras. Well built Hindu-Sikh men were deployed at the main entrance. Many were guarding the terrace. Many were sharpening swords on the stone near the well. Women, girls, and children were terrified. Mothers had pulled Infants/kids close to them.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Suddenly, a huge cry broke the silence. It came from the Badi Masjid from across the road. A mob of thousands was shouting slogans-  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Pakistan ka matlab kya la ilah illillah*\xa0(Pakistan means there is no god but Allah)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Hass ke litta vai Pakistan, khoon naal lavaange Hindustan*\xa0(we took Pakistan with smile, will take India with blood)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Kaafron, kattna asi dikhaavange*\xa0(Kafirs, see how we butcher you)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Kise mandir vich ghanti nahi vajjugi hun*\xa0(no temple will remain, no bell will ring in temples)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Hindu di janaani bistar vich, te aadmi shamshaan vich*\xa0(Hindu women belong to our bed, men to crematorium)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Prabhavati was sitting near window surrounded by 7 daughters. Her only son was guarding the main gate outside. Suddenly the mob from the mosque across had turned silent for some reason. In a minute, the screams of\xa0*La ilah illillah*\xa0started again. And this time, the volume kept going louder.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The mob with swords, daggers, spears and chains was approaching the Gurudwara. Prabhavati was first to witness from the window. She shouted – “They are coming” and held all her kids tightly in fear.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Gates of Gurudwara were locked from inside. All men took positions inside near walls and gates. All Hindu-Sikh men were asked to listen the announcement. Sukhdev Sharma, a wrestler and priest, stood up and said –  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“They are coming for our mothers, sisters, wives and daughters. Their swords are for our necks. They will ask us to convert to their faith and surrender. I have decided. I won’t surrender. I won’t convert. Neither shall I allow them to touch our women.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There was a pin drop silence for 3 seconds. And the Hindu-Sikhs roared  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“J*o bole so nihaal sat Shri Akaal! Wahe Guru Ji da Khalsa waahe Guru Ji di fateh!*\xa0No one will leave Dharma of our ancestors. Let them taste our swords”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mob had entered the Gurudwara. The first lot of 50-60 attackers was slaughtered in no time. People inside Gurudwara were prepared and in better position for small mob. There was hardly any casualty on this side. Hall of women &amp; children was locked from inside.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The mob of hundreds chanting religious slogans stood at 50 meters distance from the Gurudwara for 30 minutes. They were waiting for something. Soon the reinforcement came. This time, they were in thousands. Hindu-Sikhs inside Gurudwara were hardly 400. Men were 50-60. Rest were old, women and children.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This had to be the final battle. The mob had displayed a Sikh woman they abducted from her home being dragged in front of everyone. Her clothes had been torn. She was being paraded naked while the men were cheering assaulting her sensitive organs. She fell unconscious. But many vultures from mob kept playing with her body. Finally, someone cut off her breasts and threw them towards Gurudwara.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hindu-Sikhs of Gujranwala had heard about this barbarism in news. They were seeing it for first time. Suddenly, everyone started thinking about their women. What if our women fall in their hands after we die? This was the moment when even death was looking easy. Something else was scarier.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mob had started breaking the gates.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lajjo :\xa0*Tusi katto bapuji, Main Musalmaanani nahi banugi* (go ahead father, I won’t go to a Muslim)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant : (crying, not able to speak)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lajjo :\xa0*Karo bapuji, te bhajjo jaldi etho*\xa0(do it father, and run)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant : (crying more, it was gut-wrenching) I can’t, my daughter. How can I?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lajjo : If you don’t, they will cut my breas…(thak, the sword struck Lajjo’s neck)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lajjo’s head rolled down the well. Balwant’s strike of sword was accurate. Her headless body was pushed down the well too. Now the mob could not touch her clothes. Nobody could cut her…. She was liberated.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It was Rajjo’s turn next.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Then Bhaggo’s.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Then Paro’s.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Then Gayo’s.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Then Isho’s.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;and finally, Urmi’s.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The father would kiss forehead of each and take the head next.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant liberated his seven daughters on 18th Sep 1947. The mobs chanting religious slogans were so close to the 7 sisters. But their father could manage to save them. What if the cost he paid was their lives? At least their breasts were intact. Their honour was intact. Their freedom was intact.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Even the remaining bodies were fed to the well because even the dead bodies of girls were not safe.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Gates of the Gurudwara had been broken. Swords of Hindu-Sikhs were chopping rioters left, right, and centre. Heavily outnumbered, the Hindu-Sikhs killed many times more. A great resistance was put up. The natives of Gujranwala showed for the last time that this land still belonged to Sardar Hari Singh Nalwa and Ram. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant : Prabhavati, Lala Jagjeevan’s Tangas are waiting at the back gate of Gurudwara. He has just messaged me to escort as many women and children as we could. Take all women and children there. Baldev! You will go with mother.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Baldev : (silently nodded his head)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Prabhavati : But you? I wont go without you (was crying)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant : You have to live. For the unborn. Baldev and you must reach India. I will come too.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Prabhavati : Why won’t you come with us? \xa0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant : You are going with Baldev and the unborn. I will come in next lot. Lalaji and few men are taking you to station.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant kissed her forehead, hugged Baldev and gently caressed the unborn. “Hurry up”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Tanga of Prabhavati and Baldev had left for station.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant had lost sanity. He was perhaps the only father to have killed seven of own children in order to protect them from something more gruesome. With trembling legs, he went to the well and shouted – “Two kids have their mother with them. 7 kids here must have their father. Jai Shri Krishna..”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant had stabbed himself and jumped into the well. This man gave 7 Padminis to the society.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nanaji’s tears couldn’t stop. Neither could mine.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I : How do you know all this?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Grandfather : Baldev was my friend in college.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I : Where is he now? I want to meet him.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Grandfather : He died.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I cried a lot that night. But suddenly, I recalled my senior’s words – “ask your grandfather, could money save his family?”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I went straight to Nanaji’s personal room where his documents and belongings were kept. I slowly and quietly unlocked the locker.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There was a photograph of his teenage. With his parents sitting in middle while he stood at their backside. And there were seven smiling sisters. Like the seven rays of sun…  \n&gt;  \n&gt;—————-  \n&gt;  \n&gt;PS : We lost 28 family members in creation of Pakistan. My great grandfather, his brothers, sisters and their families were killed. All hailed from Gujranwala, Pakistan. All in the name of\xa0*La ilah illillah – there is no god but Allah*.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Protesters of Shaheen Bag, Delhi are no victims. I am the victim. There are millions more trapped in fanatic lands of Af-Pak-Ban who have been subject to worst religious persecution are the victims and need to be rescued.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We have moved on. But Pak-lovers in India haven’t. And now I believe unilateral moving on from history is dangerous. It can make culprits victims and vice versa. So no moving on from now on until all don’t move on.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Please keep my story in mind when you read my next article on why CAA-NRC is must for India and its survival.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Wrote this on insistence of my close friend, a scientist in US.

<li>Title: 'If cucks from all communities in India got together, the biggest cucks amongst those would be Kashmiri Pandits'<br />Body: "Let me start this by saying that most Kashmiri Pandits are viraat people. Given what happened to the community, they take cognisance of the threats of Islamic fundamentalism, and for the same reason, root for an actually secular (read UCC) to a Hindu State depending from person to person. One of my favorite intellectual, Ashish Dhar (Follow Upword right now!) is a KP and I'm a fan of Sushil Pandit too.\n\nBut like all communities, they got their fare share of cucks, from absolute whores like Nidhi Razdan who'd climb into bed with someone like Omar Abdullah, the guy who's very father sat on his ass while Exodus happened under his premiership, to virtue signalling chuttads like Rahul Pandita and Aditya Raj Kaul, to woke people like a few of my college mates, whose think trending #HumWapasAayenge is going to actually return them to their homelands.\n\n**#HUMWAAPISAAYENGE**\n\nLet me put it out for you.\n\nLAWDA NAHI WAPAS JAA PAAOGE\n\nThe amount of virtue signalling amongst these cucks is unbelievable. Rahul Pandita tweeted recently to the tune that CAA is like Gau Raksha for stray cows while the ones in Gaushalas suffered. Valid point, but speaking against amnesty to people who are suffering at hands of Islamic Intolerance. The same reason Kashmiri Pandits are nowhere to be found in Kashmir?\n\nNidhi Razdan is, well, dating Omar Abdullah. Who is father of Omar Abdullah? Farooq Abdullah! Who was the CM of J and K when exodus happened, under whose jurisdiction was law and order when Jihadi mobs ran amok? Farooq Abdullah. I'd find hard to talk to such people. Madam decided it's totally okay to fuck them.\n\n**DONT POLITICISE OUR STRUGGLE**\n\nAditya Raj Kaul objects to Harshvardhan politicising the issue by lauding government to abrogate 370. Arrey madarchod why don't you want to politicise the issue? The only reason any government will take concrete steps is if their is political gains behind this issue. Look at muslims, any demand regarding their community gets politicised and that's why there are so many parties in India parroting their cause. All these 30 years, one party, stood for Hindu causes, and all you got for us is virtue signalling?\n\nWhat cause in India gets accomplished without political patronage. Ram Mandir? Mandal Commission? Shah Bano? It's amazing to think KP's have the history being some of the most scholarly communities in India and yet some of their intellectuals are this stupid.\n\n**THEY REMOVED 370. BUT WHAT HAVE THEY DONE FOR KASHMIRI PANDITS?**\n\nOk. Let's send Kashmiri Pandits back. Infact, no one has stopped them right? Why don't they go back? We all know why they don't. Ashish Dhar in his wonderful video about Kashmiri Pandit exodus says that Hindus of India should not expect Kashmiri Pandits to go back because even with 370 gone, the conditions that lead to ouster of KPs still exist, and people should put pressure on the government to make sure they are safe.\n\nHow the fuck is government supposed to ensure their safety when law and order is in hands of Jihadists like the Abdullahs and Muftis? The same people under whose nose exodus happened? To make Kashmir safe for KPs again, the first thing that needs to be done right is law and order, and 370 abrogation is the first step in that. For 30 years, nothing concrete got done, and now when 370 is abrogated you are sad things are not moving quickly enough?\n\n**And finally, to my Viraat Pandit Hindu Bretheren**\n\nI apologise if I may have hurt any of your feelings in this post. This post has been totally directed to cucks like people who I mentioned above. In my life, I know KPs who I look up to in many ways. But their is a huge problem that these people might alienate Virat KPs and desensitise non-KP Hindus towards their cause. by their virtue signalling. The fight against Abrahamic tolerance goes through the valley of political consolidation, and all of Hindus need to politically consolidate behind this cause.\n\nHAR HAR MAHADEV."<br />Author: 'stolenrhymes'<br />id: 'eqv5ud'<br />Flair :Rant</li>

In India, the legal limit of transmission power in CBs is 5W. So puck any one off from Amazon or Flipkart that you like. \n* **Linear Amplifier** : This is a simple to obtain device, which can be connected to your CB and that will amplify your transmission power many times. \n* **Antenna** : You’ll need a simple antenna, which is also available on amazon. It would be better to ground it, or connect it to a big metal object which is in contact with ground. It would be better if you plant the antenna on your roof, and if you live in an apartment/high rise building, you can mount it on your window. Make sure the speaker in  question is in visible range. \n\nNow comes the setup process. You must charge your CB, plug it in the amplifier, and then plug your antenna in your amplifier. Now start the transmission on any channel whenever the रंडी रोना स्पीकर turns on. You’ll need to set your transmission on full power, and you’ll need to keep changing the channels(frequencies) to find out when the target speaker gets destroyed. You can also completely destroy that speaker and fry it upto no use, so make sure to shut off all your speakers beforehand and put your phones to silent, because the radio will mess them up too if they interfere with the signal. Also, don’t do it if your दादा-दादी have hearing aids. \n\n(2). **The Perfect and Pricey Way** : This way, I can guarantee you can fry up every active speaker in your area to ash or play anything on दैट मच्चजिद speaker( absolutely not including porn). The items will be these:\n\n* **HAM Radio** : Consider this a बाप of CB radio. It is way more powerful than CB radio. \n* **Linear Amplifier** : Similar one to the first. \n* **Antenna** : Similar one to the first. \n\nThis pricey type setup will be very easy to setup. You’ll just have to plug wires between *radio-amplifier-antenna* and you’ll be good to go. This type can transmit interference signals to a wide area, and will surely destroy the target speaker. \n\nIf you wonder how this will work, let me explain. The radio will transmit frequencies(make sure you have the receiver on if it’s a CB, or some music from your phone plugged in if it’s a HAM. Don’t worry, some CBs allow external audio input too). \n\nOnce you start the transmission, you’ll have to start flipping the channels(hence frequencies) of the signal. \n\nOn the other side of the field, the speaker with be blaring रंडी रोना in its internal amplifier on a certain frequency. Most Muchhjids use those annoying low quality Megaphone type speakers (commonly called भोंपू , conical in shape) and that type doesn’t have interference protection shield.\n\nSo when you, my bakchod, after continuously changing the frequencies of your radio will match the frequency of that भोंपू, its amplifier/transducer will face heavy interference and audio signals will be distorted, destroyed, muted and eventually the speaker will get fried. \n\nThe cliché here is, if you want to get success with a CB radio, you’ll need to be close to the speaker, 100-150 feet if the speaker is not clearly visible in line of sight. But otherwise, if you have a clear view of the speaker(like on your roof), it can work from even 400-500 feet.\n\nThat’s where the only benefit of HAM radio comes in handy, you can turn it on and it will destroy a speaker even if it’s shoved high up in the ass of someone 1km away. \n\nNow, after you have successfully destroyed a K2Speaker(which I doubt) they’ll try to repair it. They won’t be successful. They’ll buy new भोंपूs then, and you’ll destroy them too. So you, single handedly will revive the economy and povertise the भोंपू का मालिक। After weeks of trying, they’ll eventually abandon the speaker system, and WALLAH! STONKS💹! You can now sleep in peace in your early mornings! \n\nSide benefits of doing this are, you’ll have a CB walkie-talkie in case of a communication blockout like emergency or Section 144, on which you can hear the conversations of police and also use them when someone in your family goes out for some urgent task. And if you buy the second option, a HAM radio, you can communicate with anyone over the **ENTIRE WORLD** (Yes! Truly!). It will be very useful in emergency situations. \n Like I said, the possibilities are endless. Your area may face a flood, earthquake, communication blackout, Section 144, terror attack, National Emergency, you’ll have a communication system at all times. \n\nNow who I am and why I’m writing this? I’m salesman for a radio company. \n\nNo seriously though, I’m an amateur guy who loves innovation but sadly couldn’t get in IIT, so I keep making my life easy by DIY projects. There is no 100% guarantee that this will work, because maybe they have expensive speakers with an interference shield, maybe you got an audio amplifier instead of a radio amplifier, maybe the range is too long, or maybe you’re just fucking dumb and could not connect the setup properly. \n\nI wrote this article because some of our members have said their mood is fucked 5 times in a day, daily. Hum bakchod hain, par usse pehle bhrata hain. \n\nAlso, engineers of r/chodi, correct my technical details if I’m wrong. I’ll edit the post. \n\nPS: I’ll link and add specific items on  soon, along with some proofing. ;)'<br />Author: 'a-wednesday-vendetta'<br />id: 'eqtf0c'<br />Flair :Research</li>

महाराज नागभट्ट अपनी शेष सेना के साथ उधर तैयार खड़े थे। दोपहर होते होते समूची अरब सेना काट डाली गयी। अपनी बर्बरता के बल पर विश्वविजय का स्वप्न देखने वाले आतंकियों को पहली बार किसी ने ऐसा उत्तर दिया था। \n\nविजय के बाद महाराज ने अपने सभी सेनानायकों की ओर देखा, उनमे तक्षक का कहीं पता नही था।सैनिकों ने युद्धभूमि में तक्षक की खोज प्रारंभ की तो देखा-लगभग हजार अरब सैनिकों के शव के बीच तक्षक की मृत देह दमक रही थी। उसे शीघ्र उठा कर महाराज के पास लाया गया। कुछ क्षण तक इस अद्भुत योद्धा की ओर चुपचाप देखने के पश्चात महाराज नागभट्ट आगे बढ़े और तक्षक के चरणों में अपनी तलवार रख कर उसकी मृत देह को प्रणाम किया। युद्ध के पश्चात युद्धभूमि में पसरी नीरवता में भारत का वह महान सम्राट गरज उठा- \n\n"आप आर्यावर्त की वीरता के शिखर थे तक्षक.... भारत ने अबतक मातृभूमि की रक्षा में प्राण न्योछावर करना सीखा था, आप ने मातृभूमि के लिए प्राण लेना सिखा दिया। भारत युगों युगों तक आपका आभारी रहेगा।"\n\n *इतिहास साक्षी है, इस युद्ध के बाद अगले तीन शताब्दियों तक अरबों कीें भारत की तरफ आँख उठा कर देखने की हिम्मत नही हुई।* \n*तक्षक ने सिखाया कि मातृभूमि की रक्षा के लिए प्राण दिए ही नही, लिए भी जाते है, साथ ही ये भी सिखाया कि दुष्ट सिर्फ दुष्टता की ही भाषा जानता है, इसलिए उसके दुष्टतापूर्ण कुकृत्यों का प्रत्युत्तर उसे उसकी ही भाषा में देना चाहिए अन्यथा वो आपको कमजोर ही समझता रहेगा । *\n\nयह पोस्ट किसी की मोहताज नही है। भारत के इतिहास की यह गौरवशाली उच्च कोटि की गाथा है'<br />Author: 'ankit19900'<br />id: 'eqh270'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>

At least he seems to stand up for modern liberal values, has empathy, is willing to engage and listen to others, does not seem to think too highly of himself, is willing to take and answer tough questions, has the courage and conviction to fight on against a ridiculous personal smear campaign by IT cell. Modi is a narcissistic, vindictive, egomaniac who specializes in monologues without any accountability. It's unbelievable how brainwashed the people of the country is to believe Modi's capability as administrator even after he has destroyed the economy, destroyed the credibility of every single institution, destroyed the social fabric of the country and turned it into a civil war like situation in just 6 years. On top of this, the dude is not even intelligent. He is a complete moron who fucks up simple scripted interviews forget about actual press conferences. The image of Modi's capabilities created in public's eye is as artificial as Rahul Gandhi's stupidity. BJP continues to reap the rewards of a PR and Marketing blitz."<br />Author: 'abdul_786'<br />id: 'eqe30x'<br />Flair :Randia Simulation</li>
