Such crowds don't appear out of no where unless there is massive planning and money. The protest didn't start still up until after 5 months of the bill being passed. You can see when the procurement happened in November lot of people lost their black money income. No more corruption in grain procurement either.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Vikram_Sood/status/1356485725156384768?s=19\n\n\nHere is the article show casing how they're planning to uproot the govt forcefully because they have run out of source or ways to steal people's money.

It's time for us to start educating people around you why these so called protestors are protesting. They don't want to pay taxes on grains they sell. Here is the one line in the bill which has rattled these guys and that's why they're protesting. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/Aryan_warlord/status/1355578147689832449?s=19\n\nModi govt agreed to the MSP procurement and the bill gives provisions to continue with the old system so there is fundamentally nothing evil or anti farmer in the bill. It's just anti middle man as they will now be subject to taxation. The constant propaganda by NRIs not living in India needs to be answered. They don't live in India they have zero say as to what happens in India. People likes us deal with the consequences day in day out. Start to go out there and educate each and every farmer you guys come in contact with. The bill takes 20 minutes to read and.if you find any flaws point it out but I have read it have not found anything wrong. \n\nThis is our battle against these western NRIs who come to India for a month once every 3 years or so and can say what is right and wrong screw them. I have started to talk back to these  Indian NRI's cause screw them. They don't live here or pay taxes here so they have zero right over what we do and say. Time to support Modi and the Bill enough of waiting for govt to do something it's our battle for our future. What happens when they target our companies we loose our jobs not them. What happens when they start spreading communal disharmony we get affected not them. So, screw them and start speaking up for what is right.

There was once an episode in his life where he had lived in the woods for many years and then came back to his town. For six years Thoreau did not pay his taxes. He asks, “When I meet a government which says to me, ‘Your money or your life,’ why should I be in haste to give it my money?” And so he went to jail — for a single night. “For someone” — probably his aunt — “interfered, and paid that tax.” This anecdote sets the tone for the rest of my article.\n\nI had been contemplating writing a piece on this touchy subject, but I had some time so here it goes.\n\nThe Income Tax Brackets(for salaried people) are computed largely on the basis of the Whole Sale price index and a multitude of other metrics and are rooted in a stupid principle called the broadest shoulders should bear the greatest burden.\n\nI know that Income Tax helps pay for the Defence needs, Subsidies to farmers etc but there has to be a change in the way these laws are formulated. Btw this is not my personal idea, it was put forward by Dr Subramanian Swamy on multiple occasions.\n\nThe govt should stop squeezing salaried people less. Just because my salary is a fixed number doesn\'t mean you get to take my money and if its a variable number they can hide in a multitude of ways.\n\nThe Whole Sale Price Index-based computation provides justification that since these are prices of the commodities and this is my salary, I can afford to pay x amount of my income as tax. I mean what kind of stupid logic is that. Who are you to decide what my standard of living should be and how much is enough for me?\n\nThe govt should modify these unrealistic tax brackets and revamp the whole tax structure which many intellectuals have been proposing for years together and this makes much more sense in the backdrop of COVID where prices keep increasing day by day.\n\nThe RBI changes the interest rates based on the inflation, why can\'t the govt change tax slabs to be variable as well. When the times are good and there is less inflation and overhead costs we can pay more and when there\'s inflation and added expenses it makes senses to pay less.\n\nThe kicker in the whole tax system is that I have to either stop spending to save money or spend even more (even if I don\'t want to) by taking out loans to save money which is bizarre and outright stupid.\n\nYou may think that are you the only person who thought of this, many before you have thought of this issue. The thing is if you stop asking pertinent questions issues like this become cold and people get accustomed to this and say "arey yaar ye sab chalta hai". My question is why is it acceptable.\n\nThis nonsensical system can be attributed to a lot of Indian legislature and laws being directly imported from the Raj days. And No subsequent government have made any inroads into this issue or at least try to address that this issue is a one worth discussing.\n\nQuite a few businesses can easily escape from the tax chopping block as they have multiple avenues to hide their revenue and launder it, make it harder for them to do that, don\'t give out bad loans only to watch them become bad debt and being written off.\n\nPlease change this obsolete system and replace it with a system that is rooted in reality and that takes the bigger picture into consideration and is more robust.'<br />Author: 'sprx7767'<br />id: 'l9xvs0'<br />Flair :Atmanirbhar Bharat :modi:</li><li>Title: 'Ram mandir rally in spain'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'l9xh7h'<br />Flair ::news: Unverified</li><li>Title: 'Joke of the day on the Times Now livestream'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'l9xaas'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihaad_Halal Certified</li><li>Title: 'r(ignore/ignore)India and r(ignore/ignore)IndianGaming and worst subs'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'l9x1zn'<br />Flair :Removed-05-noMeta:stop:</li><li>Title: 'r/India and r/IndiaGaming are the worst subs'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'l9x02e'<br />Flair ::HighIQ: Randia Simulation</li><li>Title: 'Statement : jobs are enough , population is in excess.

Can we start fining people for throwing trash or spitting gutka where they think is alright. I believe there should be a legislation where people are fined for throwing trash in public places (if you catch some throwing trash click their picture and report them. After x amounts of reporting you get tax break or money or access to cheaper fuel for one day). Can we come with a better policy where plastic is easy to recycle, eg. Eliminating the stupid plastic cover on Coco cola, Pepsi, sprite and regular water bottle. Makes recycling 10x easier. Make the plastic potato chips bag into a paper one. Out right ban plastic bags and instead replace them with organic biodegradable ones. Encourages food stalls to use only wood and paper plates instead of single use plastic.

They will shit bricks in an instant the amount of bs they have to deal with day in day out with out any human rights organization or activist being on their side. Yes start equating a guy who literally hacked a police officer with George Floyd. Krishna was right in Bhagavad Gita people will become dumber day by day. \n\nThe guy they're trying to equate to George Floyd \n\nhttps://twitter.com/TanDhesi/status/1355338012654243842?s=19\n\nThe reality he literally attacked the unarmed officer with a sword and even hacked his arm.\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SuhasPa14357194/status/1355387057196027904?s=19\n\n\nEdit #1: [ call out bs for what it is if the protestors did horrendous shit then stop labelling them as peaceful and call them out. If the police did some fucked up shit call them out. But view the entire story cause police are always target of confirmation bias like the case above. Also if the BJP govt was facist then there would be no protest in first place and no news about it would be out there cause that's how facism works. Complete silence and censorship learn the difference before jumping to conclusions. So if any Punjabi or NRI Sikh stumbles upon this post change your freaking double standards or stick with US politics]\n\nThe fact that these guys have the audacity to say Indian govt is taking away their rights. Like in which country do they let a group of people block highways for months without facing any consequences? Which country do they call people attacking police officer with swords and driving Tractor over them as peaceful. Which country do they call people literally storming a national monument and hosting their racist and facist khalistani ideology flag as peaceful. Fuck Modi govt and fuck these opposition parties and fuck these Punjab NRIs who have started spreading hinduphobia and hate everywhere."<br />Author: 'Legionoo7'<br />id: 'l9jsq9'<br />Flair :Laal Salaam :commiehand:</li><li>Title: 'In a Nutshell'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'l9hyd1'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihaad_Halal Certified</li><li>Title: 'Vichtitra dharm sankat'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Himalayan-Pagan69'<br />id: 'l9hwkz'<br />Flair ::cshivajim: VirArt</li><li>Title: 'The Birth of Durga Devi and The Slaying of Mahishasura'<br />Body: 'To understand the birth of Durga-devi, first we should know why Durga-devi had to emerge in the first place.  \n\nThere were two asura siblings Rambha and Karambh, who were the grandsons of Brahmarshi Kashyapa. They craved power more than anything, and upon their mother Danu’s instructions, they performed tapasya(penance) so that they might obtain a boon from the devas.\n\nKarambh was unfortunately unsuccessful, and he was killed by Lord Indra.  \n\nHowever, Rambha was successful, and received a boon from Lord Agni. Lord Agni granted Rambha the boon of having a powerful son. One powerful enough to rule the three realms.  \n\nSoon after, Rambha fell in love with a she-buffalo asura named Mahishi and he married her. A male buffalo asura named Mahish burned with jealousy. He loved Mahishi, but Rambha taken her. So he tried to kidnap Mahishi.  \n\nRambha and Mahish fought a long and exhausting battle, but at the end, Rambha proved to be weaker than Mahish, and he was killed. Unfortunately for Mahish, he had been severely weakened due to the intense battle, and he was promptly killed by Rambha’s soldiers.  \n\nLater, when Rambha is being cremated, overcome with grief, the pregnant Mahishi jumps into the flames and prevents Lord Yama from taking Rambha with him.  \n\nFrom the flames emerged two asuras of immense power. Raktabeeja, who was Rambha reborn. And Mahishasura, the child of Rambha.\n\nMahishasura waged war on all of the asuras, and displaying his immense powers, he became the king of the asuras.  \n\nHowever, Mahishasura was too ambitious. He not only wanted be the king of the asuras, but the king of all the three realms. But he was not strong enough. His uncle Karambh had been very powerful as well, but Lord Indra killed him with a single stroke. As he was now, Mahishasura stood no chance against the devas.  \n\nRetiring to the mountains of Patala, Mahishasura performed a rigorous and hellish tapasya, praying to the Creator, Lord Brahma.  \n\nA great number of years would pass before Lord Brahma finally appeared before the asura.  \n\nHe said “Child! Your prayers have pleased me. Ask of me that which your heart desires.”\n\nMahishasura promptly said, “Lord, let me become immortal. May I have no fear from death!”\n\nLord Brahma smiled and said, “It is not possible. All creation must have an end. Immortality is not in my power to grant. Anything else, other than this impractical request, ask, and it shall be yours.”\n\nMahishasura said, “Since it is not possible for me to be immortal, may I not die at the hands of men. May I not die at the hands of my foes, the Devas. May I not die at the hands of the great Trinity. If death has to approach me, may it approach me only through a woman. Woman is weak, woman is powerless. How can a woman kill me, the all powerful Mahisha? If you grant me this boon, I shall be as good as immortal.”\n\nThe Lord said, “O best among the Asuras. You shall become all powerful among men and Devas. You shall lead a long life, but it shall come to an end, through the means of a woman. There is no escaping fate. You shall not die, except at the hands of a woman.”\n\nAfter the Creator disappeared, Mahishasura looked to the skies and roared with evil laughter that rang through the earth.  \n\nGathering his armies, the terrible asura launched an assault on the Earth. After conquering the whole Earth, the insatiable Mahishasura set his sights on the heavens. He attacked Amaravati, the abode of Lord Indra.  \n\nThe war between devas and asuras lasted a hundred years, but Mahishasura had been blessed by Lord Brahma that no deity would be able to defeat him. Even Lord Indra’s mighty thunderbolt proved useless. This thunderbolt that slew the mighty serpent Vritra. This thunderbolt that destroyed half of the Himalayas in a single shot. This thunderbolt barely tickled Mahishasura.  \n\nThe Devas had lost, and with no other choice, they approached Lord Brahma, who took them to Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva.  \n\nThey explained how Mahishasura had snatched the rights of the Surya, Indra, Agni, Vayu, Somnath, Yama, Varuna and other devas, and has made the heavens his new home.\n\nNow, the homeless devas roamed on earth like ordinary humans as they had nowhere to go. The devas spoke of how they were now counting on the Holy Trinity to save them from this misery.  \n\nBut due to Lord Brahma’s boon, even Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva would not be able to defeat Mahishasura. It had to be done by a woman.  \n\n“But there is no such woman!”, Indra said.  \n\nLord Vishnu smiled. “Then we shall make one.”\n\nFrom Lord Vishnu, a divine beam of light emitted. Following suit, Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva also emitted blindingly divine light.  \n\nSuddenly understanding what to do, Indra and the other devas followed suit and emitted divine light of their own.  \n\nThe divine light from the Trinity and the devas converged into a blazing star that lit up all the three worlds. Unmatchable, immense, immeasurably powerful energy spewed out of the star in all four directions.  \n\nThe Devas were amazed by this exceedingly massive, infinite power that dwarfed anything the universe had ever seen.  \n\nThis infinitely powerful energy condensed into the form of a woman.  \n\nThe light of Shiva formed her face.    \nThe light of Yama gave her long, lustrous hair.    \nThe light of Vishnu gave her ten powerful arms.    \nThe light of Somnath formed her breasts.    \nThe light of Varuna formed her thighs and calves.    \nThe light of the Bhudevi(Earth) formed her hips and behind.  \nThe light of Brahma formed her feet.  \nThe light of Surya formed her toes.    \nThe light of the Vasus(children of Ganga-devi) formed her fingers.  \nThe light of Kubera formed her nose.    \nThe light of Prajapati formed her teeth.    \nThe light of Vayu formed her ears.  \nThe light of the Sandhyas(Devas of sunrise and sunset) formed her two eyebrows.    \nThe light of Agni formed her three eyes.  \n\nFrom the light of these devas, as well as countless others, the Great Durga Devi was born.  \n\nThe gods then gifted the goddess with their weapons and other divine objects to help her in her battle with the demon, Mahishasura. Lord Shiva gave her a copy of his Trishula while Lord Vishnu gave her a copy of his Sudarshana Chakra.  \n\nVaruna, gave her a conch and noose, and Agni gave her a spear. From Vayu, she received arrows. Indra, gave her a thunderbolt, and the gift of his white-skinned elephant Airavata was a bell. From Yama, she received a sword and shield and from Vishwakarma (god of Architecture), an axe and armor.  \n\nThe god of mountains, Himavat gifted her with jewels and a lion to ride on. Durga was also given many other precious and magical gifts, new clothing, and a garland of immortal lotuses for her head and breasts.\n\nThe beautiful Durga, bedecked in jewels and golden armor and equipped with the fearsome weaponry of the gods, was ready to engage in battle with the fierce and cruel Mahishasura. Her lion\'s thunderous roars shook the three worlds. Oceans boiled and surf poured overland. Continents were torn at their granite foundations as whole new chains of mountains rose, while older ranges crumbled, cracked, and gave way to dust in a thousand landslides. Mahishasura and his demon allies found their attention drawn from heaven to Earth, as Durga\'s power moved its way towards heaven. Though confident of their power and control in heaven, the demons could not help being awestruck.\n\nAs Mahishasura\'s armies were struck down effortlessly by Durga, it became obvious to him that he was not as secure in heaven as he had thought. No demon could fight her and win. Her breath would replenish her armies – bringing back to life all of her soldiers who fell. From Airavata\'s gift, the bell, came a confusing clamor. The demons were in chaos and were easily defeated and captured. The ground was left littered with the broken limbs and body parts of the defeated demon army.\n\nMahishasura was shocked and enraged by the disastrous events on the battlefield. He took on the form of a demonic buffalo, and charged at the divine soldiers of Durga, goring and killing many and lashing out with his whip-like tail. Durga\'s lion pounced on the demon-buffalo and engaged him in a battle. While he was thus engaged, Durga threw her noose around his neck.\n\nMahishasura then assumed the form of a lion and when Durga beheaded the lion, Mahishasura escaped in the form of a man who was immediately face to face with a volley of arrows from Durga. The demon escaped yet again and then having assumed the form of a huge elephant, battered Durga\'s lion with a tusk. With her sword Durga hacked the tusk into pieces.\n\nThe demon reverted once more to the form of the wild buffalo. He hid himself in the mountains from where he hurled boulders at Durga with his horns. Durga drank the divine nectar, the gift of Kubera. She then pounced on Mahishasura, pushing him to the ground with her left leg. She grasped his head in one hand, pierced him with her sharp trident held in another, and with yet another of her ten hands she wielded her bright sword, beheading him. At last he fell dead, and the scattered surviving remnants of his once invincible army fled in terror.\n\nThe Gods bowed to the goddess and showered their praises on the goddess following her victory:\n\n"Mother, you have created this universe. You are the strength of all. Devatas (Gods), Rishis (sages), Yakshas (demi-gods), Kinnaras (heavenly musicians with human bodies and heads of horses) all bow to you. Even Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwar (Lord Shiva) do not know you fully. For the Dharmik (righteous) you are Lakshmi (Goddess of wealth), for the adharmiks (evil) you are Alakshmi (she who brings misfortune). You are buddhi (knowledge), you are lajja (modesty), you are shraddha (respect). You were there always and will be there forever. You are the adhar (source) for all, You are Prakriti (nature). You saved the universe by killing the numerous asuras (demons)."'<br />Author: 'Darkstorm999'<br />id: 'l9hg13'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm 🕉️</li><li>Title: 'To irrational people of randia who are justifying the attack.'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'l9h108'<br />Flair :Removed-11-Repost:stop:</li><li>Title: 'Oh great!
