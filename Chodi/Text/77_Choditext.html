Cows need to be pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk. First, they‚Äôre impregnated through artificial insemination, then after the delivery, newborn calves are separated from their mothers immediately after birth so the cows can be milked. *Then Male calves are starved to death because hypocrite nazi Gau-Rakshaks banned cow slaughter in many states.* \n\nIf you think chickens have it worse, then think again, cows are subjected to much more cruelty in the dairy industry. At least chickens have to suffer for few weeks, but cows have to suffer for years before they stop producing milk. In the wild, cattle may live up to 20 years. But since they‚Äôre artificially impregnated every year, it cause their bodies to deteriorate at the age of just four years.\n\nA lot of people think cows are holy in this fascist india and are treated like deities. But they don‚Äôt have a revered godly status because we librandus eat them, they are referred to as "gau mata", which came about because we wanted to justify taking milk from cows and wanted to appear good doing so. Calling the cow mother makes it seem like we are respecting the cow and that the cow is giving us the milk by her own will, just like a mother. \n\nMost vegetarian Hindus are fascistly delusional enough to believe that litres of milk they‚Äôre wasting in temples doesn‚Äôt come from exploitation. In fact we‚Äôre running the biggest cattle exploitation industry on the planet and feel superior while doing so. Chaddis are amazingly asshole.\n\nI‚Äôm a meat eater, yay right I will blame vegetarians while I eat halal meat, so I‚Äôm not the one to say but ‚Äúreligious‚Äù fascist vegetarians are the biggest hypocrites Modi bhakts'<br />Author: 'xxiwisk'<br />id: 'gtz2x3'<br />Flair :Randia Simulation</li><li>Title: "Why can't we spread Hinduism in arab countries?"<br />Body: 'Prophet Muhammad said, no disease or plague can enter Medina because it is protected by Angels.\n\nNow Coronavirus has entered Medina affecting 100s.

In its fullest form, it is a complete, total, 100% system of life,‚Äù Dr. Hammond notes in his book. ‚ÄúIslam has religious, legal, political, economic, social, and military components. The religious component is a beard for all of the other components.‚Äù\n\nTheir takeover of a country, what Dr. Hammond refers to as ‚ÄúIslamization,‚Äù begins when the population of Muslims reaches a critical mass, and they being to agitate for various privileges.\n\nOpen, free, democratic societies are particularly vulnerable. ‚ÄúWhen politically correct, tolerant, and culturally diverse societies agree to Muslim demands for their religious privileges, some of the other components tend to creep in as well,‚Äù he notes.\nWhen the Muslim population remains under 2% in a country, they will be seen primarily as a peace-loving minority and not as a threat to other citizens. \n\nUnited States ‚Äî Muslim 0.6%\n\nAustralia ‚Äî Muslim 1.5%\n\nCanada ‚Äî Muslim 1.9%\n\nAs the Muslim population reaches 2% to 5%, they begin to recruit from ethnic minorities and disaffected groups, within prisons and street gangs. \n\nUnited Kingdom ‚Äî Muslim 2.7%\n\nSpain ‚Äî Muslim 4%\n\nThailand ‚Äî Muslim 4.6%\n\nFrom 5% on, they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population,‚Äù Dr. Hammond notes. ‚ÄúFor example, they will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic standards) food‚Äù and increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature such food on their shelves ‚Äî along with threats for failure to comply.\n\nFrance ‚Äî Muslim 8%\n\nPhilippines ‚Äî 5%\n\nSweden ‚Äî Muslim 5%\n\nSwitzerland ‚Äî Muslim 4.3%\n\n\nSoon they begin to apply pressure to allow Sharia law within their own communities (sometimes ghettos).\n\n‚ÄúWhen Muslims approach 10% of the population, they tend to increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions,‚Äù Dr. Hammond notes. ‚ÄúIn Paris, we are already seeing car-burnings. Any non-Muslim action offends Islam, and results in uprisings and threats, such as in Amsterdam, with opposition to Mohammed cartoons and films about Islam.‚Äù \n\nIndia ‚Äî Muslim 13.4% (riots, separatism)\n\nIsrael ‚Äî Muslim 16% (Palestine)\n\nKenya ‚Äî Muslim 10% (Boko Haram)\n\nRussia ‚Äî Muslim 15% (Chechen extremists) \n\n\nThe violence increases when the Muslim population reaches 20%. ‚ÄúAfter reaching 20%, nations can expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations, sporadic killings, and the burnings of Christian churches and Jewish synagogues,\n\n\nAt 40%, nations experience widespread massacres, chronic terror\xa0attacks, and ongoing militia warfare,‚Äù such as in:\n\nBosnia ‚Äî Muslim 40%\n\nChad ‚Äî Muslim 53.1%\n\nLebanon ‚Äî Muslim 59.7% \n\n\nFrom 60%, persecution of non-believing ‚Äúinfidels‚Äù rises significantly, including sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia law as a weapon,\xa0and Jizya, a tax placed on infidels, such as in:\n\nAlbania ‚Äî Muslim 70%\n\nMalaysia ‚Äî Muslim 60.4%\n\n\nAfter 80%, expect daily intimidation and violent jihad, some State-run ethnic cleansing, and even some genocide, as these nations drive out ‚Äúinfidels,‚Äù and move toward a 100% Muslim society, which has been experienced to some degree in:\n\nBangladesh ‚Äî Muslim 83%\n\nEgypt ‚Äî Muslim 90%\n\nGaza ‚Äî Muslim 98.7%\n\nIndonesia ‚Äî Muslim 86.1%\n\nIran ‚Äî Muslim 98%\n\nPakistan ‚Äî Muslim 97%\n\nPalestine ‚Äî Muslim 99%\n\nSyria ‚Äî Muslim 90%\n\nA 100% Muslim society will theoretically usher in their version of peace ‚Äî the peace of ‚ÄòDar-es-Salaam‚Äô ‚Äî the Islamic House of Peace. ‚ÄúHere there‚Äôs supposed to be peace, because everybody is a Muslim, the Madrassas are the only schools, and the Koran is the only word,‚Äù such as in:\n\nAfghanistan ‚Äî Muslim 100%\n\nSaudi Arabia ‚Äî Muslim 100%\n\nSomalia ‚Äî Muslim 100%\n\nYemen ‚Äî Muslim 100%\n\n\nMore dangerous are the demographic trends. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs 1.5 billion Muslims make up 22% of the world‚Äôs population,‚Äù he observes. ‚ÄúBut their birth rates dwarf the birth rates of Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews, and all other believers.\xa0Muslims will exceed 50% of the world‚Äôs population by the end of this century."\n\nThanks to Erwinlives.'<br />Author: 'RLR_1'<br />id: 'gtc2v9'<br />Flair :HQ Text Bakchodi</li><li>Title: 'Wow'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'RLR_1'<br />id: 'gtc1gb'<br />Flair :Research</li><li>Title: 'I wrote any article on how "Freedom of speech" has affected india.

His daughter is married to a leading Communist labor leader. \n* Chinese aggression commenced within three months after the signing of the 1954 Indo-Chinese Treaty \n*  The Army favored resistance, but was overruled by Menon (defense minister)\n   * **supplies deliberately withheld** from Indian troops in the affected areas \n   * ordered **not to retaliate**. \n   * considerable unhappiness about this in the Army \n* Army is confident that it could stop the Chinese if it were ordered to do so, but they have received **no special training or equipment** for mountain warfare \n* Helicopters were purchased from Russia, but were found to be unsuitable for high altitudes \n* Chinese are training Indian guerrillas in Tibet, but no similar action has been taken by the Indians.\n\nThe author also quotes from a book *The Chinese Aggression* by a Dr. Satyanarayan Sinha:\n\n* China planned to attack India in 1960\n* in March 1960, a large number of revolts against the Chinese occupying forces flared up in several parts of Sinkiang \n* these were instigated and supported by Russian men and weapons \n\nQuoting a Russian Kazakh from the book:\n\n* Central Asian Soviet Intelligence was the only outside agency which understood the international gravity and the consequent results of the war moves of the Chinese \n*  It was by coincidence that the Soviet Union in its own interests realised the urgency and took measures to stop the Chinese advance, planned to cut deep into the Indian borders \n* Provoking successful revolts in Sinkiang may not prove enough to stop their onward march. Ultimately we shall have to think of stumping their spearhead \n* It would have been much simpler had India helped us in our efforts to smash the war-craze of the Chinese."<br />Author: 'space_diplomat'<br />id: 'gtakpo'<br />Flair :Research</li><li>Title: 'Frands, I have a question'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'THELORDREGENT'<br />id: 'gta3oq'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'Stop criticising Modi...!!'<br />Body: "Economy, education sector and Hinduism. These three are major areas where every right wing supporter has problem with Modi govt. \n\nI don't understand what kind of magic do people expect from govt. Do you realise that even if Modi doesn't change anything in education policy and simply tries to discipline the primary schools already existing. Let the conversions and everything anti Hindu going on in country to continue for next 5 years and let economy with its imperfect policies take whatever shape in due course of time (ofcourse it will not run into ground), still this govt is the only option you have. \n\nMy opinion : This term govt will only focus on Water supply, Indian penal code changes, Uniform civil code, population control bill and anti conversion laws. Obviously many more changes will be brought but these are the major ones. Just these and add 370 abrogation and Ram mandir decision. If these planned changes are actually brought, these 5 years will be remembered as revolutionary in India political history.\n\nThere are many things that needs to be done before Modi govt can even think about issues of religious conversion and communist text books. \n\nBe assured that no changes in school syllabus or text books will come before 24, Temples will remain under govt, communist will cause bloodbath under the veil of free speech and democracy in coming elections. Ridiculously high amounts will be offered as freebies, all media will be sold out, azadi slogans along with hanuman chalisa will be part of campaigns. \n\nYour rant and demand of everything at once will only cause fault lines which leftist are only going to exploit. I see these impatient young people who start to abuse BJP for everything wrong with country. Guys keep patience, except few people in cabinet every other political leader is willing to sell anything for votes. Just imagine if these communist ever got in power again, what havoc they will bring upon whole country.\n\nInfact, bust them with facts. Support right wing social media persons. And please watch this video, it shows you mirror for a while, [harsh truth of patriotic Indians](https://youtu.be/LANe_3CZgVk).

What does that mean? I help people improve their mental health so that they can prevent/avoid mental health issues. Think of it this way - a trainer and nutritionist can help you get healthy and fit so you're less vulnerable to illness and common injury. But that doesn't mean you won't get hurt, or won't fall sick occasionally, in which case, you will then go to a doctor to help you out. I am that trainer - but for mental health.\n\nThis Sunday, May 31, I will be hosting another session of Happiness for Millennials. This session will be free and open for anyone who would like to participate. [RSVP here](https://forms.gle/AUhsvP2xQUoLJpQM9) by Saturday noon.\n\n**Why should you join this one?**\n\nFor the last couple of months, we've covered two Life Skills modules in our discussions. This Sunday, I will be hosting a special session that will tie together the two modules till now. For anyone who hasn't yet attended a session, **this would be an excellent introduction** to what we've been discussing so far and how it has helped others who have been joining in. For those who have been attending the sessions regularly, it will be an opportunity to put together all our discussions, and see for yourself how far you've come.\n\nUnlike our regular sessions, this one will involve live activities, and give you ideas of how you can actively work on improving your mental health in your daily life.\n\n**How can you make it better?**\n\nGet your friends from wherever in the world to join! If you're staying with family, join in with your family. If you have flatmates/roommates, get them to join! If you're doing Zoom meetings with your colleagues, tell them about this and get them to join! If you have friends/family in other cities, get them to join!\n\nBASICALLY, this series is not for the mentally ill only. These sessions are not a replacement for therapy. These sessions are not only for the unhappy.\n\nNo one really knows what happiness is. So come and let's figure it out together. \n\n[**Here**](https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2020/mar/17/decoding-happiness-2117479.html) is a news article about the webinar series.\n\n[**FAQ here**](https://np.reddit.com/user/monkeyshantiorg/comments/fteb5p/faq_about_happiness_for_millennials/)**.** Pls read before posting your questions.\n\nIf you're interested, pls [RSVP here](https://forms.gle/AUhsvP2xQUoLJpQM9) so I can set up the meet accordingly."<br />Author: 'monkeyshantiorg'<br />id: 'gs08aq'<br />Flair :High IQ</li><li>Title: 'Book recommendations'<br />Body: 'Can someone recommend me books or documentaries where I can understand and learn about actual history of India(not the whitewashed one) ?'<br />Author: '6varshitsingh666'<br />id: 'grzws5'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'can someone give me raw data on Vasundhara Raje and Lalit Modi - what is this new controversy which this satyamahajan Ravish is into....'<br />Body: 'did a quick search could not find much..

So i asked her wheather she has kept Roza or not. She replied no and then asked my name .So i  said my name was Rizwan( i was playing with her i am a hindu) and then she said we started talking . I thought she would realise that i am not muslim but she did not. so after 10 minutes i told her myself and then she was laughing and said it was funny and all. Then i came to know she was also from Bangalore and we started talking and then she said that i sounded depressed and  frustrated  (which was true ) and then she told everything will be okay and all. Then she started talking about herself that she has also seen bad days, she was molested by her uncle when he was child and some other stuff. She was pretty open and we talked for about 4 hours in Pubg lobby. Then i asked for her number and she gave it to me. I dont know why but it was like she knows me very well( i forgot to mention she wanted to pursue psychology but could not) and i felt a very strong connection toward her. then 2 days back i called her and started to ask more about her family . She told she is not very close to her father and her father and mother dont sleep in same room. IDK  why did she tell me all that personal stuff but she did. And everytime  i texted or called her it was like she was spying on me, she just knew very much about me.This was driving me crazy, i would just think about her all the time and could not concentrate elsewhere . So then i did what we can call a dick move, i called her yesterday and confessed i was found of her and she was like its cute and funny and she just kept laughing. She said it was Brothers day but i didnt say you anything and i am not even friendzoning you , and said it was just attraction that i had for her.And then .... And now i miss her even more.idk WTF did just happen but idk why it hurts.Sorry for any  grammatical errors.'<br />Author: 'oddgamer1'<br />id: 'gq3hhq'<br />Flair :Shitpost</li><li>Title: 'How about a pinned post of interesting youtube channels?

So what can you do :\n\n1.People over centuries tries to destroy our civilization - the thing that saved dharma and tradition of this culture was "Guru-Shishya Parmapara". The knowledge was passed on from parents/Gurus to children so if you wan\'t to defend the dharma starts learning about it -as much as you can - do you know how to read hindu calender - hindu tithis - what are the month of hindu calendar? - if you learn it and pass it to your kids - it cannot be lost. ..what if you are a engineer .. why don\'t you create  amazing Github Libraries to easily implement hindu calender in any application.. yeah we need to pass it on to upcoming generation. Did you learn some important Sanskrit slokas/strotum/aartis etc - give it a try.\n\n2.The state of Temples in India : we know our temples are slowly losing importance in life of new generations. When did you last time visited a temple - did you made a small donation. When did you made a plan with some of your friends to visit a temple. Yes we need to do this. \n\nOur temples are now not as rich as before they cannot feed all the hungry and underprivileged people today - in some states temples are under strict supervision and control - but can government stop you from feeding poor and hungry on the name of your dharma.. NO! Get some friends - make small fund - starts feeding poor near your house or temple - yeah call it "prasadam" - tell them it\'s the temple and god feeding them. Feed one.. two.. hundred ..do as much as you can. Give up selfish interest and do it on the behalf of temples.\n\nRemember the need of a poor and hungry is - food - not dharma. If we don\'t do this as individuals - some other religion will try to feed and capture their soul.\n\n3.Start learning regional languages : people will try to divide us on basis of languages . So if you are hindi speaker - starts learning languages close to hindi - try Gujarati ,Rajasthani ,Punjabi. Make sanskrit words part of you vocabulary.\n\nIf we live in north of India - try to at least learn a language from south - kannada , tamil, malayalam, Telugu. And if you are from south - try learning bengali , hindi, Gujarati ..anyone that you like.The best way to destroy this division - is to prove to the world that north indian can speak a south indian language fluently and vice a versa..  learn some songs in new regional languages..learn some basics of different languages of india... The key to a civilization is its languages.\n\n4.Celebrate the festivals (Find time in your busy scheduled for this) : So if it\'s Krishna Janmastami - don\'t just do puja at home - get some friends - organize some games - destroy some danhi handi --&gt; tell friends on instagram and whatsapp - how much fun you had. What about a Makhaan Heist - kid will have some much fun isn\'t it. A deep curiosity build up in childrens\' mind. A night out on Shiva Ratri - may be. We need to create some new way to celebrate - which appeals to young generation but keeping the core based on ancient traditions.\n\nWhat I see know a days - we are moving away from celebrating festivals as a SOCIETY - we are becoming more self centered even in times of celebration.\n\nNamaskar!'<br />Author: 'sharma_pratik'<br />id: 'gpmth8'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'Future of hinduism ,bharat and bjp ?'<br />Body: 'What do you think will happen after 20 years , kya hum cucks ke hatho chutiya bn rahe honge , ya sab sahi hojayega ?'<br />Author: 'chaarbotalv'<br />id: 'gpm6vu'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'Liberandu once said : Modi has risen tensions between Hindus and Muslims'<br />Body: 'I replied, "You\'re not wrong.

It should be mandatory to have a cyber security consultant/team for any and every website/comapny that collects user data and provides logins. Am I making sense? Let me know in your responses.
