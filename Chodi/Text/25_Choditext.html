From the secret cash transactions to Iran, it just becomes obvious. Worst part is literally noone knows this. They have took over USA and we all are just watching it. Iran and Turkey literally get too many benefits and you know the worst part? Iran and Turkey literally had 24 million population EACH in 1960 and now they are both\n\nhave a population of 80 million, thats LITERALLY 4x!!!! . Germany including east and west had a population of 80 million in 1960 and its STILL 80 million. Turkey is literally in the NATO AND at the same time deals with Russia LIKE WTF? I mean Turkey and Iran have literally gotten extremely strong in the last 20 years like its incomparable. Not to mention that Irans economy recovered in 6 months from sanctions completely. US literally fought all of Iran's wars, none of US wars benefitted Israel. Israel already has had peace treaties signed by arab countries in the 90s like lmfao. I mean Barack Hussain Obama got elected ffs. Go search up US aid to countries and ITS ALL MUSLIMS COUNTRIES like how, how, the only one which is not is Israel. I mean its obvious at this point. US is in debt and it literally gives out foreign aid like candy lmao. I mean ive heard that the only reason Pakistan hasnt collapsed is due to US aid, which is understandable and not to mention the aid US gave in dollars was worth more before. oh god, I used to think US was secular and my muslim friends still don't like the US. I can already tell there will be a massive wealth transfer from Europe to the Middle East, Middle East is being set up to become a Europe at this point, all MNCs and companies are doing mass construction like never before, and every company from i know is opening offices in Saudi Arabia. This Iran-Saudi-Israeli stuff is all a nataunki money laundering scheme to loot the US. I mean the debt US has too high, how will they repay this wth. Its really messed up, i used to think the US was some good country but turns out its actually run by Islamists. Muslims still think US will make a greater israel like they still cry after all this special treatment."<br />Author: '0192Nesase'<br />id: 'nued7p'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Covid Updates from past week'<br />Body: "Bangladesh extends COVID restrictions till June 16\n\nBangladesh approves fifth Corona vaccine for emergency use\n\nCSIR India and Laxai LifeSciences initiated clinical trials of promising repurposed drug Niclosamide for treatment of Covid-19 after receiving regulatory approval from DCGI\n\nBangladesh records highest single day COVID death since May 9, positivity rate crosses 11 percent\n\nUnion Labour Minister reiterates India's committment towards countering the impact of Covid-19 pandemic; addresses the 109th Session of ILC\n\nMore than 24 crore vaccine doses provided to States/UTs\n\nControversy over disclosure of Chinese COVID vaccine pricing in Bangladesh\n\nNational recovery rate stands at 93.38% today | COVID-19 updates\n\nDIAL launches COVID-19 vaccination centre for airport staff at T3\n\nBangladesh allocates Tk 10,000 crore for COVID 19 emergency requirements\n\nGovt has created awareness through various instrumentalities and media platforms for creating awareness on COVID treatment protocol\n\n\n\nAll news courtesy http://ddnews.gov.in/ \n\nTrack latest covid data for India here: https://www.covid19india.org/"<br />Author: 'chodibot'<br />id: 'nud6l7'<br />Flair :National 📰</li><li>Title: 'A satire short film plot of a chutney'<br />Body: "Any filmmaker here, I would be glad if this plot turns into a real mainstream shortfilm something like the below \n\nhttps://youtu.be/vlZiatc5Ugc\n\nPlot :\n\nA girl( let's call her chutney ) in her mid twenties is having a peaceful happy life in a tier 2 city living with her in-laws and husband ,she is a teacher in a private school while her husband is an government employee.\n\nEverything was going fine until she started reading feminist crap literature on Facebook,reddit, Quora and watching Netflix series and Hindi feminist movies.

With the recent increased use of tubeless tires and development of roads and highways, the Sanghi government is selectively snatching away the minority community's livelihood. According to the latest scientific research by Dhruv Rathi, as many as 18% of the victims of road accidents belong to the minority communities. India's minorities can't even travel safely.\n\nThe Sanghi agenda of the fascist Hindu nationalist Modi government has seeped deep into the secular fabric of our country.

Here's how."<br />Body: "I guess we all know by now how giants like Facebook and Twitter are becoming rogue. It won't be far fetched to say if they were to create a country, it will be much like China where democracy is just a name.\n\nFor young people reading this, they may find it hard to understand how these tech giants are going to affect the foreseeable future.\n\nTo put this into perspective, they can destroy any individual or even a country if they don't like them. Fake news won't be moderated equally which will cause the society to collapse. People will be denied equality and basic rights. Propaganda will be in its peak, no one will be sane enough to actually understand anything outside this virtual space.\n\nThey will be so powerful that even government can't do anything to put them in place. Basically, they will become East India Company. East India Company came as a business but soon became colonizers. We know about those stories of horrific incidents from the colonial period but the scale at which tech giants are going to control you can be much more terrifying.\n\nRemembering the past, we should make sure such self-centered abominations never emerge again.\n\nLet's understand\n\nNobody is unknown to Facebook's privacy. They have a vast presence in the internet much like Google. That means, even if you don't use any Facebook product, you are still not safe from their data collection. If you have any electronics with internet, you are being tracked at all times. Twitter's APIs are used in many websites (especially digital news sites) so you indirectly access Twitter too.\n\nBut there is a way to COMPLETELY block them.\nFacebook domains and services can be easily blocked. For starters, uninstall/disable any facebook apps and services that come as bloatwares from the settings of your phone. To block Facebook and Twitter domains, use these apps\n1. [Blokada 5](https://f-droid.org/app/org.blokada.fem.fdroid) or [Blokada](https://f-droid.org/app/org.blokada.alarm) (older iteration)\n2. [RethinkDNS](https://f-droid.org/app/com.celzero.bravedns)\n3. [personalDNSfilter](https://f-droid.org/app/dnsfilter.android) (for advanced users)\n\nThese apps will give you control over the domains that your phone can access, they run over your phone's VPN profile to capture the domains.\n\nAmong these, Blokada is easiest to use. It has blocklists for facebook blocking among others. Domains can also be blocked manually.\n\nFor PCs, using a firewall is a must to block out tech giants in your device.\n\n\nCrosspost to spread the message."<br />Author: 'MeWithNoEyes'<br />id: 'ntir0j'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Thodi awareness ayi lekin abhi aur jaruri hai ye copypasta maine taiyar kiya hai TITLE-Abbe bose dk weebs chutiye ho kya .

I wonder how many of you rooted for Armin Navabi in that twitter controversy. Wasn\'t that also a "representation"?\n\nLeave how a fictional sumo wrestler "Raiden" ripped off 3 arms of the "strongest hindu god"(words of the manga, not mine) for now, and look at this;\n\nhttps://record-of-ragnarok.fandom.com/wiki/Special:MobileVisualEditor?page=Parvati\n\nAnd tell me if this "representation" is any different from what Armin Navabi did.\nThe author went even a step further and made Mata Adishakti into 3 milfs *beautiful woman with a voluptous body* as stated in the Fandom. And don\'t even get me started what those lowlife Japanese people and the weeabo audience are into(rule34 etc), just see their comments about the character *inspired* from Mata Parvati in their official sub ShuumatsuNoValkyrie what kind of sex-depraved desperate lowlifes they are to jack off to 2d drawings. Whole representation of women is fuvked up in Anime. A female character in an anime means she must be hypersexualized to attract the weeabos. There\'s no concept of **Mother Goddess** for them, the term *goddess* for them means peak sensual female, **absolutely fuvkable** in simpler words.\n\nPlease don\'t tell me that even this is not offensive for you. How would it sound if I say, "let\'s draw your mom dropping her huge titties?". It\'d be rude right? On top of that I\'ll be given titles like misogynistic, sexist, patriarchal supremacist and 75 other titles like this.\n\nThe argument that there are Greek and Norse gods too is irrelevant here as Greek and Norse are dead religions with 0 community worshipping them. No one will be offended doesn\'t matter how you interpret their mythology. There\'s a whole franchise on killing the Greek Gods brutally and the west loves it.\n\nAnd for the Major religions, there\'s no representation from Islam, 0 literally. They didn\'t show the God or prophet of either Christianity, Islam or Judaism.\n\nThey showed Adam and Eve and even went to show Adam as the **most powerful being** that even Zeus is afraid of fighting. \n\nSo much glory for just the first man of Abrahmic religions while no respect for the GOD of 3rd major religion of the world. Because they know Hindus aren\'t brave enough to actually do any harm. While they know that there\'d be heads flying if they portrayed Allah or Muhammad.\n\nIf anyone can trivialize Hinduism just like that even after having a billion strong followers then there\'s no reason to boast "1 billion hindus". \n\nAfter the liberal left took over Hollywood, jokes on Jesus and Christian God became so common that no one takes christianity seriously in US. Jesus and his God has been trivialized to hell. Same fate Hinduism will have. The Puranas and its Gods will become trivial fictional characters one day if things keep going this way.\n\nWe could overwhelm Netflix with our numbers alone if united. With enough people opposing them, we could get it removed or atleast the parts with Hindu gods removed in it. Remember Tandav? It didn\'t have even a bit of blasphemy compared to this anime yet all hindus stood united against it just for a few minutes sequence.\n\nWe are not beheading or lynching anyone. Just protecting our integrity by legal means. Artistic liberty within boundaries of mutual respect is still allowed. Look at the video game that got released last year "Raji the ancient epic", or depiction of chakras or inspiration from Devas vs Asuras in Naruto, or inspiration from Pranayama(breathing techniques) in Demon Slayer. Those are called good inspirations.\n\nAnd while this won\'t be the only time someone is trivializing Hindu gods, we can\'t go all guns blazing everytime, we need to find fullproof system that ensures such inappropriate depictions are taken down immediately without giving them such publicity and attention they get after such controversies. And this will never happen when half of the community is busy in justifying how it\'s a fiction based on different universe so I should join them in drawing the R34s'<br />Author: 'Jaegerbomb135'<br />id: 'nsrd1j'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: 'Give me the list of anti-nationalists in India'<br />Body: 'Please mention their names.'<br />Author: 'ghosh30'<br />id: 'nsqusa'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Do it here.'<br />Body: '[https://twitter.com/i/events/1400867733730779137](https://twitter.com/i/events/1400867733730779137)'<br />Author: 'Xebrasaur'<br />id: 'nspud6'<br />Flair :Indo-International 📰</li><li>Title: 'tiananmen square'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'space_diplomat'<br />id: 'nspig3'<br />Flair :CKMKB_❤️ day ka Democracy 🇨🇳</li><li>Title: 'Weird'<br />Body: 'Why are Sikhs turning against Hindus (sometimes even supporting Muslims over Hindus)??\n\nPlease explain'<br />Author: 'HameerKhan'<br />id: 'nsp0p4'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Twitter’s obvious bias in meddling with democracies continues.

If you use Google translate to translate Polytheism, it says BAHUDEVA-VAAD (बहुदेववाद). Be careful, here\'s a dangerous turn, make no mistake. Meaning of polytheism is an ideology which worships multiple deities,( Devi-Devata) and it\'s not the worship of multiple ultimate entities, because if an entity has to be ultimate, it can only be one and not many, that is why we the Hindus, use the terms like paramatma (परमात्मा), the ultimate soul. So, if the term polytheism means worship of multiple deities, i.e. Devi and Devatas, how can the term Monotheism mean workship of one single ultimate entity and not one single deity, while the basis of this classification of religions is the number of entities worshipped. This is the sole reason why Christianity Christianity and Islam are monotheistic and not monistic. Again the question arises that why do I need to mention this? This is because we the Hindus, and many others like us, tend to think or assume that God or Allah are general terms for the ultimate entity, or say we tend to assume that there two words are English/Arabic terms for paramatma(परमात्मा)\xa0 or Ishwar (ईश्वर). The term God comes from the \xa0Proto-Germanic\xa0\xa0 ǥuđan. The Germanic word in its originality was gender neutral. But when it was appropriated by English language, it because synonymous to one male entity named Jehovah, the Christian creator. This creator, is not a source of the universe but actually a real walking being who created everything as if a carpenter created furniture. Worship of God or in other words Jehovah is not the worship or invoking of the ultimate source of the world, but it\'s submission of Christian version of a deity who is supposedly the creator of the world in their version of creation. Then comes Allah, (Arabic:\xa0الله). If you read what is written on the flag of Saudi Arabia over a sword, it says, "None deserves worship except Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. (Arabic: La ilaha illallah\nMuhammadun rasulu\'llah) This particular phrase is called shahada, or oath, which one takes while converting to Islam. Note that here, it\'s mentioned "Worship". Logic says, that the term worship can only be used with a walking being and not with a shapeless formless entity. The God (or Jehovah) of Christianity and the Allah of Islam are the names of their version of creator contrary to popular perception that assumes them to be the general term for ultimate supreme source of existence. While Hindu version is that Paramatma, the ultimate soul is one and can be known by different names by different wise people and sages of the world, the Islamic version says that the only creator of everything is Allah and only Allah, and he can\'t be known as any other name except Allah or the names prescribed in the Quran, and same goes with Christianity with respect to the God(Or Jehovah). While a Hindu or Hindu scriptures on one hand, thinks that, Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma, Kartikeya, Durga etc are nothing but manifestation of one supreme source of the universe, the Muslims and Islamic theology thinks that Allah is the only worship worthy entity, and all the other entities, from Shiva to Jehovah are false gods, symbols of infidelity, act of Satan (devil), mere imagination of fools, and so on. Islam or Christianity simply denies existence of any other entity except Allah or God and tends to falsify them. Let\'s try to understand this with one final example. For a Hindu, the ultimate soul or Paramatma or Ishwar, is an ocean. All the Devi and Devatas and other versions of the creator or deities which are worshipped, are the rivers which will ultimately fall into the ocean. While for a Muslim or a Christian, Allah or God are the only isolated ponds, and for them, there are no other water resource in existence and no stream of water anywhere remotely connecting with their pond and any other water source mentioned out of their theology is non existent or false water resource.\nThis entire theory is to explain that the unity of God (loosely speaking) in Abrahamic religions, Islam or Christianity, isn\'t the underlying unity of all worshipped entities, but it is the only singularity in existence which is supposed to be worshipped clearly explaining why they are Monotheistic and not monistic. This also breaks down the narrative that all religions do not propagate the same thought and thus all religions, contrary to popular perception among liberals, aren\'t the same.\n[link for blog](http://raktcharitra009.blogspot.com/2021/06/truths-which-we-ignore-about-abrahamic.html)\nShare with others'<br />Author: 'Raktcharitra'<br />id: 'ns9b3i'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Im forced to take my 2nd PU exams again while others get a pass!'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'wagecuckdoomer'<br />id: 'ns99tj'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: 'Where can download good quality old hindi movies.'<br />Body: 'I have tried many torrents and sites either they are dead or extremely slow.

The only reason that India is not an Islamic nation is because of the mercy of the Mughals as they did not seek to convert everyone. They site all the previous Muslim conquest countries by saying that they converted all the people that lived there. Here is a poem written by Bulleh Shah (A MUSLIM) who was alive in Punjab during the time of Guru Gobind Singh. It clearly shows that had Guru Gobind Singh and his Sikhs not stood up for the Hindus they would have been all converted or killed. \n\n\nNah\xa0Karoon Ab Kee,\nNah Karoon\xa0Baat Tab Kee.\nGar Na Hotey Guru\xa0Gobind Singh,\nSunat Hoti Sab Kee.\nI talk about neither\xa0yesterday nor tomorrow;\nI talk about today.\nHad Gobind Singh not been there,\nThey would all be under Islamic\xa0sway.\n\n\nThis shows that it was not the mercy of the Mughals that kept the existence of all religions intact but the rebellions of Indians. Such as the Marathas down in the south stopping the Mughals from spreading, and the Sikhs in the North doing the same. That is why our Country still has many different faiths alive- Hinduism, Buddhisim, Sikhisim, Jainism and even Islam. The funny thing is even after the Mughals were defeated and the Marathas took a majority of India. The Marathas did not apply some sort of tax or Jiziya to the Muslims or try to kill them as revenge, but treated them with respect and dignity. The same can be said of the Sikhs who took a majority of Pakistan. Neither did they retaliate or took revenge on Muslims for what they did to them. I think these rebellions and the Kingdoms of the Marathas and Sikhs should be given much more prominence in schools and in Bollywood. When I was young I was led to beleive that before the British there was only the Mughals. Whereas the Mughals were defeated long before the British came.'<br />Author: 'PatelGang'<br />id: 'ns3ts3'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li><li>Title: 'discussion'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'nejja2332'<br />id: 'ns3sbi'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: "Response to people saying the Mughals didn't try to convert everyone to Islam"<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'PatelGang'<br />id: 'ns3n3h'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li><li>Title: 'The population in Kerala.

So based on it, I've observed some not-so-innocent patterns in Indian Television industry. So the first part of this is dedicated to the youth-favourite TV show which has acquired a cult status as soon as it was telecasted. \n\nSo Left Right Left(from here on we call it LRL) has five POV characters- Captain Rajveer Shekhawat, Cadet Naina Singh Ahluwalia, Cadet Amardeep Huda, Cafet Alekh Sharma, Cadet Ali Baig, Cadet Pooja Ghai and Cadet Yaduwansh Sahani aka Yudi. \n\nAll cool and it's entirely coincidentally, Cadet Ali Baig was played by the most handsome male of the cast Mr. Harshad Chopra. Out of all the cadets, Ali is the only one who has come to Kanchenjunga Military Academy to serve his nation and he got this patriotism from his father who was also in Indian army. He is taunted by a 'bigot' soldier having the surname Pandey who makes derogatory remarks for his belonging to a specific community. Also, our cadet Ali is romantically involved with cadet Pooja who comes after him even after him declining to pursue a relationship. The gang except Ali of course breaks every rule of discipline in the name of young blood.\n\nThere's also a parallel plot of Naina's brother being accused a traitor and Naina's sole aim to clear his name. It is later revealed the traitor is Dr. Ritu Mishra(Note the surname- in the characters most of whom are from Punjab and Haryana, Mishra surname is selected exclusively for the traitor) who sets honey trap for army captains, seduces them and acquires secrets of country's defence. Our protagonist Naina is full of hate, anger and disgust for the system in Indian Army and is a revolutionary. The other traitor is Major Bhargav.
