The Farmers protest is following the same sequence of event like Anti CAA protest. Protest in the month of December to January. During Republic Day they will do all stunts to embarrass us in international stage.\n2. Government failure in intelligence is such a shame. A single time incident will be passable  but if it continues then people get frustrated for their lack of action. Just imagine the economic loss for NCR region during last one year.\n3. Lack of communication from GOI is such a bonkers. Every Media channels twisting their own stories.  At least  Government should employ some representative for each state to talk about various policies they are implementing.\n4. The wistron incident damped their further expansion in Karnataka. Any issue can be rectified in a peaceful manner but the so called 'workers' just throw mud on their own head.\n5. Need to do something against the so called voices of free speech from Foreign land who get their food from corporate farming, vehicle from capitalist manufacturers, Million dollar houses from Land Reforms. But telling us to be a 3rd world country.  Time to deploy RA&amp;W to shut down this idiots.\n6. We need to kick all the IAS babus sitting in ministries who doesn't know anything about various sectors like power, automobile, defense, oil &amp; gas. How a IAS officer who has a degree in literature can understand the oil industry or automobile industry. Most of the time they are simply announcing crazy rules and regulations which is simply dumb.\n7. Judiciary and police reforms is now critical."<br />Author: 'narendran13011999'<br />id: 'kdpo3j'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: "[Very Long] New user, trying to understand this sub because... it's a bit confusing"<br />Body: 'All the mod posts and descriptions say this is a sub for all races, nationalities, genders, religions, etc. And hate speech will not be allowed. I suppose you can see where I\'m going with this. Because most things posted here are kind of hateful towards some community that\'s not religiously Hindu.\n\nI, too, am someone whom most here might call a "librandu" or some other derogatory name although I don\'t consider myself a liberal at all. I am hindu, but mostly because I am a citizen of Hindustan. I think Indian history, philosophy, and the expertise in math is fascinating. I also think Islam is a book of bad ideas, Christianity too has its fair share of horrible ideas. I\'m just saying all of that to give you a background, because I\'m not the typical user I mostly see on this sub. I\'m also not someone who ignores that Islam is dangerous and says all religions are equal because they\'re clearly not.\n\nI like it when Krishn says I accept worship in any way or in any form devotees offer it to me. I do not like when Christ says I am the only door to god. So in that way I am secular because the most incredible book of knowledge produced in my country says so. And it\'s also practical, it avoids holy wars.\n\nBut coming to why I made this post. The sub says no hate but there\'s a lot of hate. Against liberals, Christians, Muslims, and apparently even Sikhs because they were seen feeding Muslims. And I understand there are some very valid criticisms, but I do not understand the hate. I understand people are angry, rightly so because our liberal leaders of the past have done a great amount of dis-service. Over all, I\'m confused, is this a political sub that respects all or is it just a sub for doing what you can\'t on the other sub (you know which).\n\nAnd if it is really a sub for all, might I request that we criticize ideas, rather than people by calling names like liberandu, rice bags, or something else. If it\'s not I probably am about to lose all the karma I have. But oh well.'<br />Author: 'vivektwr23'<br />id: 'kdnp5l'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li>

Irrespective of religion, Indian culture, civilisation and nationalism would be taught in these converted educational institutions making Assam the first Indian state to teach on these themes**," the state Education Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told the media.  \n\n\nHe said that the Assam cabinet in its meeting chaired by the CM on Sunday, and a **bill in this regard would be moved during the winter session of the state Assembly.**  \n\n\nMadrassas run by private organisations in Assam would not be shut down. On the other hand, **Sarma** had earlier **said** that **the state government had been spending Rs 260 crore annually for running the madrassas and "the government cannot spend public money for religious teaching".**  \n\n\n"In order to bring uniformity, teaching the **Quran at the cost of government exchequer could not be allowed to continue**," he had said.  \n\n\nHe said that currently there are four Arabic colleges also under the State Madrassa Board and in these colleges and madrassas had two syllabus, one is purely theological subject on Islam, and the other is general syllabus prescribed by higher secondary education council.  \n\n\nHe claimed that besides the guardians and parents, most of the students enrolled in the madrassas, want to become doctors and engineers and are not aware of the fact that these are not regular schools.  \n\n\nA survey conducted by a Guwahati University professor, who happens to be a Muslim, found that the parents and guardians of most of the students of the madrasas are not aware of the fact that their children are not taught the regular subjects but are imparted lessons mostly in theology.  \n\n\nHe claimed that, most Islamic scholars are also not in favour of madrassas being run under the government and added that the madrassas were set up in the pre-Independence era and are a legacy of the Muslim League. \n\n[http://ianslive.in/index.php?param=news/Assam\\_to\\_be\\_Indias\\_1st\\_state\\_to\\_teach\\_Indian\\_civilisation-745276/NATION/1](http://ianslive.in/index.php?param=news/Assam_to_be_Indias_1st_state_to_teach_Indian_civilisation-745276/NATION/1)'<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'kdmhnl'<br />Flair :Bakchod News :news:</li>

I hope you guys love this one as well and stay tuned for more. Cheers)\n\n\n\n\nThe Brahmins and Kshatriyas had since the days of King Sudas and Guru Vashishta, defended the borders of Aryavarta, with iron and blood. Yet, after 500 years of resistance against the Arab Caliphate, between 700AD to 1200AD, the Brahmin domains of Sindh and Kabul had withered away. It now fell upon the Rajputs, to struggle and sacrifice in service of nation and religion. For the next 700 years, the Rajputs stood as the bulwark for the Hindu nation in the face of absolute subjection, displaying standards of chivalry and morality, which have never been surpassed by any other race in any other country.\n\n\n\n\nYet, when the Marathas rose to prominence, the Rajput character had changed. Just as a sword dulls with age and iron rusts with time, so did the nobility and chivalry of the Rajputs suffer the ravages of jealousy, clan rivalry and centuries of war. Emperor Aurangzeb, given his suspicion of non-Muslims, distanced himself from the Rajputs who had served the Mughals since the days of Akbar, as renowned generals and administrators. Hence, they were robbed of court prestige and overseas posts which filled their coffers. The age wasn\'t conducive to the Rajput way of war anymore either. Gone were the days when the sword and the Lance could carry the day, it was the age of muskets and cannons that made so much fodder out of massed cavalry charges. Hence, to prosper, the Rajputs needed to acquire rich lands, outside their barren and poor homelands.\n\n\n\n\nIt was this internal rivalry and constant strife among the great houses of Rajputana, that gave the Marathas an opportunity for expanding their influence. It\'s questionable, whether Maratha policy in Rajputana was a well thought out strategy or, simply fortuitous pragmatism, but what is certain is that the Marathas who were employed by the Rajputs as mercenaries and confederates, in the end reigned supreme.\n\n\n\nThrough their constant interference and employment in Rajput affairs and civil wars, Peshwa Bajirao, his son and Peshwa, Nana Saheb as well as Malharrao Holkar, Ranoji Scindia and Jayappa Scindia managed to extract huge sums our of the Rajput coffers, as legitimate payments, as war indemnity and as plunder out of their lands.\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the best example of the chaos of this period can best be understood from the example of Raja Madho Singh of Jaipur, and the War of Succession for the Throne of Jaipur (1743-1750).\n\n\nMaharaja Jagat Singh of Udaipur, married off his sister to Sawai Jai Singh of Jaipur on the condition that their son would take the throne of Jaipur, even if he had elder siblings from Jai Singh\'s other wives. \nThis son, was Madho Singh.\n\n\n\nSawai Jai Singh died in 1743, and when Madho Singh demanded part of the patrimony, Ishwari Singh declined which led to civil war. Ishwari Singh secured the support of Ranoji Scindia. Madho Singh secured the support of Jayappa Scindia and Malharrao Holkar for a sum of twenty lakhs. The following battles resulted in the two Maratha chiefs getting richer and the two brothers bleeding each other dry. Eventually the Peshwa intervened and after Madho Singh promised him 15 lakhs, Peshwa Balajirao "Nana Saheb" of which he received 10 lakhs when he arrived in person to confirm upon Madho Singh four districts. Ishwari refused the proposal and after being defeated in the subsequent battle that followed, committed suicide in 1750.\n\n\n\nTherefore, Madho Singh became Raja. He proposed to pay 10 lakhs in tribute on top of the 5 lakhs already promised to the Peshwa. But here too, the Maratha appetite for gold, showed its ugly face. The Marathas now demanded cession of at least 1/4th of his country. This was resented by Madho Singh, his nobles and his people.\n\n\n\nTherefore, to escape such unjust demands, Madho Singh plotted and murdered 4000 Marathas in Jaipur, through deceit, including generals and their families.\n\n\nIn response, Raghunath Rao, who was already in the North, settling arrears, proceeded to Jaipur. After a brief war, in 1758, a total sum of Rs. 55,14,962 was imposed on Madho Singh of which he paid only 6 lakhs to Raghunath, promising the rest in installments.\n\n\n\nIn 1759, Malharrao arrived to collect the arrears, but by now, Madho Singh knew, through regular communication with Durrani, that the Afghans would invade and Holkar would have to leave. He therefore held out and paid nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, greed, rivalry, lust for power, land and plunder was what made tha Marathas and the Rajputs into bitter rivals. Though, one must not consider this to characterise the relationship between these two power throughout their history, but certainly this was the picture, before the Third Battle of Panipat.\n\n\n\n\nSources : "Marathas and Panipat" by Hari Ram Gupta\n\n\n\n"Military History of India" by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n\n\n"Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan" by Lt.

They will manipulate, blackmail for conversion \n- 10% of tithe (church tax) from your income is compulsory \n- are very strict when it comes to inter religious marriage etc. \n- They have hindu names, or weird names like Rohit John, and if you get their ancestors name you will find their real hindu names just by going 2 generations back.\n- you will find them across India with no primary place \n- will not have Christmas tree / shack or even decorations for Christmas \n-will have hindu /past religion documents like caste certificate etc\n\n\nROMAN CATHOLIC \n\n- small population, concentrated in few cities and places like Mumbai, goa, little northeast, diu Daman, Puducherry etc\n- these are extremely loose true or old European Christian.\n- they will never ever try conversion \n- will be open to Prasad, temple Visits\n-they kiss during weddings like western Christian's (is not done by ricebag/orthodox ) \n- they mostly speak English at home or Konkani (mix of Portuguese and Marathi) \n- loose church rules, they go if they feel no compulsion \n- they have true English, Portuguese, French surnames for generations like Rodriguez, Francis, Paul etc with first names being English as well \n- These are people can be located to some concentrated places in India and will still have relatives and ancestral homes mostly goa, Puducherry, diu daman etc. And don't pop out of nowhere like rice bags. \n- these are the Christians you see in bollywood, in elegant churches and having mass on Sundays etc\n- also this is the group that runs convent schools.

<li>Title: 'The House of Awadh, a history of Maratha diplomatic failure'<br />Body: 'Note : This is the second in a collection of posts I had planned related to the Battle of Panipat, and the Battle itself I\'ll cover separately.\n\n\n\nThe History of the Royal House of Awadh, stretches back to Saadat Khan Burhan-ul-Mulk, who was a son of Iran by descent, and had made India his new home during the decline of the Safavid Dynasty. His inherent military talent and his ability for diplomacy and sound administration, meant that he rose from being the commander under a Faujdar, all the way to being the Governor of Awadh ( Oudh) and Agra.\n\n\n\n\nWhen he held the Subehdaari (Governorship) of both Agra and Oudh, he was also appointed the Mir Bakshi and Mir-e-Atish, and he was at the zenith of his career. He was a loyal noble, one of the last servants of the Mughals who was loyal to his salt and soil. Above all, he wished for his Subahs to be rich, prosperous and protected. He viewed the Marathas as invaders from the South and adopted a policy of armed resistance against them. Throughout the remainder of his career, he remained loyal to his family, his only wife, to the Mughal Empire and above all to Awadh. He was a veteran of Karnal, being the only Mughal noble to actually inflict any casualties upon the Persians under Nadir Shah. After his death, his son, Safdar Jung, inherited his father\'s titles. \n\n\n\n\nUnlike his father, Safdar Jung, was disillusioned by the Mughal Emperor. He knew, that the only way to secure the peace and prosperity of the realm was for him to become Wazir, he had to ensure that loyal and dilligent Indians were placed in the highest posts of the beaurocracy and the Turanis had to be expelled from the court. He also had to contend with the resurgent Afghan power in Rohillkhand, as well as the Jats, the Sikhs and the invaders from beyond the frontiers. He therefore, wished for the Peshwa Balajirao to be an ally and protector of the realm. \n\n\n\nTo him, being a Shia, he found Hindus to be much better allies as compared to Sunnis. He always made Brahmins his Dewan and Senapati. A practice followed by his father, and all his successors. \n\n\n\nSafdar Jung allied with the Marathas and the Jats, both of whom he brought to his side in return for daily cash payments and with Dattaji Scindia, inflicted heavy defeats upon the Bangash Afghans. By March 1752, the Afghan had lost nearly 20,000 men and were forced into retreat from Awadh. In March of the same year, Durrani captured Lahore. Safdar Jung convinced his Maratha allies with the following treaty :\n\n\n\n1) The Peshwa would defend the Empire against Durrani or any other external threat and internal threats such as the Afghans for a total Rs. 50 lakh\n\n\n\n2) To meet military expenditure, the Peshwa would be granted the Chauth of Sind, Punjab, and a few districts of Upper Ganga Doab.\n\n\n\n3) The Peshwa would be made Governor of Agra, Mathura, Narnaul and Ajmer, though he would not disturb the existing system of administration. Plus, his generals would wait upon the Emperor like other nobles.\n\n\n\nThis pact, was among Safdar Jung\'s greatest national services to date. Sadly, the Mughal Emperor had already formally ceded Punjab to Durrani, and in his hollow confidence, rejected Safdar Jung\'s proposal for the Treaty. The Marathas now demanded Rs.50 lakhs as payment and began plundering. At the same time, their attempt to have a friendly ruler established in the Deccan fell through.\n\n\n\n\nAt this point in 1753, Imad-ul-Mulk, the successor of the arch nemesis of the house of Awadh and leader of the Turanis prevailed upon the Peshwa, through the Emperor, with an offer of Rs. 2 crore and the Provinces of Safdar Jung (Awadh and Allahabad). The Peshwa, took back any support from Safdar Jung, who was attacked by the Mughals as well as the 4000 Marathas in Delhi under Antaji Mankeshwar. Safdar Jung was defeated and was forced to part with his post of Wazir and Mir Bakshi, spoils of the Victors. The former Wazir and perhaps the last patriotic noble in the Mughal Empire died a betrayed and broken hearted man. \n\n\n\nWith this betrayal of trust, the Marathas had turned against them the House of Awadh. The most powerful house in the North which was loyal to its soil. \n\n\n\nShuja-ud-Daulah, was nowhere near as noble as his father Safdar Jung, to speak nothing of his grandfather. He was a man of vice, and average competence. But when he was presented an opportunity to fight against the Marathas, he took it. Not only to avenge the depredations against his father, but to fulfill the mission of his grandfather, who wished to push back the Southern invaders.\n\n\n\nOne wonders what might the situation have been, had the Marathas seen the bigger picture, had they not betrayed the noble Wazir, had they thought of the future and had they seen beyond their immediate need for money.\n\n\n\n\nSources : "Marathas and Panipat" by Hari Ram Gupta\n\n\n"Military History of India" by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n\n"The First two Nawabs of Awadh" by Ashirbadi Lal Srivastav\n\n\n\n"Shuja-ud-Daulah" by Ashirbadi Lal Srivastav'<br />Author: 'PushyamitraShunga1st'<br />id: 'kbn8c6'<br />Flair :इतिहास :H:</li>

I vividly remember holding my hand to my mouth while the composition, which was composed by Ramadasu, that seemingly was insulting Lord Rama was sung.\n\nFor instance, one line in the composition goes  \n“*Neevu kulukucu tirigevu evarabba sommani Ramachandra*”\n\nwhich basically means\n\n“With whose father’s wealth do you think you are shamelessly enjoying and traveling?”\n\nBlasphemous, I thought!\n\nThe next lines went further:  \n“*Mee tandri Dasharatha Maharaju pettena Ramachandra?*\n\n*Leka mee Mama Janaka Maharaju Pampena Ramachandra?*”\n\nHere, Ramadasu was asking Lord Rama if the wealth and jewels Rama was adorned with in Bhadrachalam were paid for by Dasharatha Maharaja or sent by his father-in-law Janaka Maharaja.\n\nMy initial shock transitioned into pondering; I wondered why a devotee that sacrificed freedom to build a Rama temple in Bhadrachalam was questioning the very same divine being.\n\nI didn’t have to think long because I began to understand what I was listening to when the last line from the composition was sung:\n\n“*Bhaktu landarini paripalincedi Sri Ramachandra. Neevu kshemamuga Sri Ramadasuni elumu Ramachandra*”\n\nMeaning?\n\n“You are the one who rules and looks after your devotees, O’ Lord Rama. So please ensure that your very own Ramadasu is also safe and protected, O’ Lord Rama.”\n\nWelcome to Ninda Stutis\n\n **First, what are Ninda Stutis?**\n\nNinda Stuti essentially translates into praising (Stuti) through blame or abuse (Ninda). Confusing? What I also thought. In Ninda Stuti pieces, you question the Divine. Sometimes you scold them or make unflattering comparisons, such as how Sant Tukaram compares Lord Vitthala to a Bhoota (Ghost) in *Pandhariche Bhoota Mothe*.\n\nHowever one chooses to approach Ninda Stutis, one thing is for certain: it always is done out of love. Love for the Divine.\n\nSo evident is this that Purandara Dāsa, who is known as the father of Carnatic Music and for his loving praises to Lord Krishna, composed several Ninda Stutis to express his love in a different, unique manner. Even the great Sadhguru Sri Tyagaraja composed Ninda Stutis, such as *Abhimaanamu Ledemi* in Andhaali Raga. While they may superficially seem like abusive rants, Ninda Stutis are a unique way for great devotees of the Divine to praise them and show their love for them.\n\nIn a world so sensitive to so many topics relating to blasphemy in religious matters, it speaks well of Hindus, Hinduism and Hindu deities that Ninda Stutis have found a notable place in Indian Classical Music, particularly in Carnatic Music and the Varkari Genre. When I asked my guru why Ninda Stutis have not been shunned, she relayed that the deities are not so weak that they get offended when their dear and beloved devotees choose to express their love creatively.\n\nAt the same time, she rightly stated that Ninda Stutis are not a license to insult with malignant intentions. Let me say that again: they are not licenses to insult Hindu deities with malignant intentions. Those who think so miss the point of Ninda Stutis entirely. Ninda Stutis are simply praises of love and admiration composed and performed in the quest to seek unity with Brahman, which is the ultimate divine reality for Hindus. Let them be heard and sung. Let them bring us closer to the Divine.\n\nSource- [https://www.hindustudentscouncil.org/2020/06/14/ninda-stutis-praising-the-divine-through-scolding/](https://www.hindustudentscouncil.org/2020/06/14/ninda-stutis-praising-the-divine-through-scolding/)'<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'kbif9q'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li>

<li>Title: 'OSInt about Islamic organisations and institutions of the country'<br />Body: "So, you just read the title right? OSInt. It stands for Open Source Intelligence. \nRecently while going through a video, I came to understand the fact that internal intelligence apparatus of the country, isn't very keen on gathering OSInt regarding the madarsas, Islamic universities, schools like Darul Uloom Deoband, various dargahs etc, let alone their surveillance. Let's get familiar to this term OSInt. By now you already know the full form. In detail it means the intelligence and analysable information that is collected using 'available to all' sources. Broadly speaking, newspapers, media, public statements. With reference to the Islamic religious institutions/organisations, the sources of OSInt can be the Urdu newspapers, the Fatawas, the statements of prominent Islamic ( preachers/public figures/politicians/Bollywood folks ), their unnoticed activities, like meetings with foreign leaders. Urdu newspapers and Magazines and Fatawas give the insight into the minds of the Islamists, or the narrative they are trying to build or sell. Like it or not, after partition, the scarcity of people who can read Urdu, has alienated us and made it difficult for us to monitor their activities. \nI'm looking for interested folks who can read Urdu and may be we can think of watching them."<br />Author: 'Raktcharitra'<br />id: 'kb83ps'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: 'The current Indian national political scenario'<br />Body: " \n\nThere are farmer protests going on this very moment, Bengal elections next year, TN has a very fickle political scenario with whatever the fuck Rajni is gonna do, bollywood just came out of a very ugly political situation (idk how that devolved to that) and we are probably on the brink of an all out religious war.\n\nDisclaimer: I don't really have any political party i support, i support all of them for different ideologies, so don't get butthurt or ban me from here because i don't support the party you like.(Talking from personal randia experience here)\n\nBJP:\n\n1.Privatization of several government organizations (the latest casualty being the railways). Yeah, it might help the trains safer, more hygenic and whatnot but nobody can deny the fact that the ticket pricing is gonna be too high. It is easily the most viable mode of transport for the lower middle class and now they probably cannot afford it anymore. Spending taxpayer money on Statue of Unity, the new parliament and whatever else. I mean, the cost of building this shit is probably not so astronomical and most of it is probably now in some politician and his builder buddy's pocket, but thats how this country has operated for a long time and its not gonna change anytime soon. Instead of draining that kind of money on the statue or whatever, i feel like they could have done a lot more good if they just stuck to building a hospital or a school or heck, even help ISRO with its future missions (thanks, Mission Mangal). The whole Pakistan rhetoric: Everyone who criticizes the government is labelled anti-national, tukde-tukde or whatever and their image is tarnished by Republic TV and the others. (No, Republic is not neutral). They are also advised to go to Pakistan because clearly you are not allowed to stay in this country if you don't support the ruling party.\n\nCONGRESS:\n\nI mean its caste and religion based politics has now done enough to destroy the country. I can't imagine how this country could have been if Nehru and is descendants would have atleast tried to develop the country instead of focusing on making sure that there is steady flow of money to their pockets and that they cover up all the wrongdoings and scams that have plagued most of their reign( since the late 80s atleast). These dumbfucks are still trying to project Pappu as a mass leader and the party's face on the sole privilage of having a PM daddy (and granny and great-granddaddy). Clearly that plan is not working and they are probably gonna fade out of existence by the end of this decade.\n\nMAHAGATHBANDHAN:\n\nI mean who the hell let this bunch of illiterate bunch of school bullies become national leaders (Arvind Kejriwal is an exception: He is smart and knows how to avoid letting the public see his hindutva self, while letting them realize it). Mayawati is a crazy bitch who had Lucknow laden with elephants when she had CM post. Akhilesh and his father are a bunch of patriarchal cunts who don't want to condemn rape, Lalu and his family needs no introduction in field of crime or politics and Didi is a genuine psycopath. Down south we have confused Kumaraswamy who doesn't know whether he likes the BJP or not and Shiv Sena has an extremely violent brand of hindutva."<br />Author: 'ketchupwithchocolate'<br />id: 'kb6t16'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

A belief in paramaatma, reverence towards trimurti, avatars, vedas, goddesses has to be a must for you to be allowed to call yourself a Hindu.'<br />Author: 'K2ASikhIsaiBhaiBhai'<br />id: 'kb6ls1'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li>

<li>Title: 'A case in the favour of Sadashivrao Bhau'<br />Body: 'I plan on making a few posts such as this one, before I make a post on the Third Battle of Panipat.\n\n\n\n\nOn the 3rd of August, 1730, the younger brother of Bajirao Ballal, Chimaji Appa was blessed with a son. This boy, he named Sadashivrao. Though, in time, he would earn the nickname Bhau. The young boy\'s father died when he was a mere ten years old. His education and nurturing being taken care of by his aunt Kashibai and his grandmother Radhabhai.\n\n\n\nAt the age of 16, in 1746, he undertook his first campaign. The campaign continued till May 1747 mostly in the western Karnatak region. In January 1747 he won his first battle at Ajra, south of Kolhapur. All together 36 parganas were captured in this campaign.\n\n\n\nAfter the death of Chhatrapati Shahu, Sadashivrao Bhau, would be made the Dewan of Peshwa Balaji Bajirao otherwise known as Nana Saheb. He successfully led the Battle of Udgir which weakened the Nizam of Hyderabad. It was here that Bhau first used a more European method of war, employing his Gardis and artillery to good use and winning the day. Thus, he grew suspicious of the old geurilla way of war and promoted a European model of pitched battles. \n\n\nA few words must be said about these early successes and the effect they had on a man of Bhau\'s temperament and his estimation of his own capabilities. Grant Duff draws a good picture of the young triumphant yet amateur Bhau in these words :\n\n\n" The natural violence of Bhau\'s temper was increased by the family jealousy he had experienced, and the factious intrigues to which it gave rise. His pride was augmented by his extraordinary good fortune in the late campaign, and the spirit of military enthusiasm so dangerous in a general without experience, took complete possession of his mind. Success had inspired him with a blind confidence, which salutary reverses in a humble sphere would in all probability have amended."\n\n\n\nAdded to this mental disposition, was the material factor of war, which was again unfortunately inadequate for the task Bhau was meant to accomplish.\n\n\n\nIn term of soldiers and equipment, he had been supplied with 10,000 of Peshwa\'s own household troops 12,000 of the subordinate chiefs, 8000 disciplined Gardis and 20,000 Pindaris (freebooting raiders). He was provided 8,184 cannon balls out of 19,000 required. 160 maubds of lead and 800 maunds of gunpowder, 99,150 flints for muskets, and an inadequate quantity of 65 sheets against 2000 requisitioned, of European paper for charging the muskets.\n\n\n\nThe Peshwa expected a Maratha army to supply itself with plunder and therefore gave Bhau a mere Rs. 1,88,000 while the monthly expenses exceeded 5 to 6 lakhs. Added to the miserable condition of his supplies and the unsatisfactory composition of his troops, Bhau had one more problem facing him.\n\n\n\nBhau, had too little time to prepare. He had never been to North India, didn\'t know its climate and people or culture. He had with him many families who wished to visit the sacred sites in North India. He didn\'t have boats to ford the rivers in the North. The Marathas fought the Afghans in winter when the Afghans are at their finest, instead of the summer when the climate would have sapped the Durrani of his vitality, this too happened due to delays.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I will say this, yes, there are many aspects that led to the defeat of the Marathas at Panipat, but Bhau is not solely responsible for this. The choice of picking a general lay in the hand of Nana Saheb, who even against the advice of his court should have ocjed Raghunath Rao. The only reason why Bhau was sent to the North instead of Raghunath, who was experienced in the North having led two successful expeditions there, was because the success of Maratha campaigns was judged in monetary terms, and in thus realm, Bhau overtook Raghunath who had brought debt to the Empire. This added with the fact that the army, it\'s supplies and composition also lay in the hands of the court, which also, wasn\'t optimal.\n\n\n\nI\'m open to any discussions in the comments.\n\n\n\n\nSources : Military History of India by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n"Marathas and Panipat" - Hari Ram Gupta\n\n\n\n"Military System of The Marathas" by Surendra Nath Sen\n\n\n\n"Ahwal-e-Jang-e-Bhau-va-Ahmad Shah Durrani" by Pandit Kashiraj, Dewan of Shuja-ud-Daulah.'<br />Author: 'PushyamitraShunga1st'<br />id: 'kay508'<br />Flair :इतिहास :H:</li>

<li>Title: 'Line se lago, sabko upar jaane milega'<br />Body: 'I heard a very interesting analogy today,\nA 10 floor building did not have a lift, so people had problem climbing up and down. Specially the elderly and the kids, so the society started exploring options.\nFinally they got some donkeys, who could carry people up and down. The donkey owners would charge people for carrying them up and down for a fee and would also pay 10% to the society from the revenue they earned. It was a very happy situation for all involved.\nAfter sometime the society management changed, the new management decided to install a lift for carrying people up and down.\nAll hell broke loose and everyone started protesting, this is not fair, society will loose revenue, the donkey owners will be jobless and no food for them (human rights issue), the donkeys will be worthless (animals rights issue), all were angry.\nSociety management clarified, the lift is available to all but the gentlemen who wanted to use the donkeys could still do it. But no, the agitation continued and so finally the new management had to succumb to the pressure.\nThe final arrangement was arrived and so anyone who wanted to climb the building could still use the donkey. The donkey would carry a person, go in the lift and carry people up &amp; down. All were happy.\nDisclaimer: any resemblance of this with the farmers agitation is a coincidence.'<br />Author: 'TejasaK'<br />id: 'ka6ncx'<br />Flair ::Whatsapp: WhatsApp Forward</li>

<li>Title: "Before I sign off for tonight, a representative of the so-called 'Kisan Protests'......."<br />Body: 'He mentioned that the proposed solution while allows for state governments to tax private markets but does not regulate trade in those markets. This is wrong on so many levels: \n\n1: For starters, the fact that a tax is being levied in itself implies state governments will frame rules of regulation of these markets. That there will be mandatory registration of traders (though bad decision as it restricts entry) further require some regulations by states\n\n2: The larger point here is that there are no defined market-places for most products in our economy - but there are standard contract regulations that are levied and that when we speak of unregulated trade, that does not do away with such regulation under standard-contracts.\n\n3: So this entire defence of lack of regulation even in what has been proposed by the government makes little sense and it ignores basic principles of law &amp; econ. It has become increasingly clear that this is not a farmers protest but a political protest\n\n\nIf the government buckles and gives in to guaranteeing MSP, it would be an UNMITIGATED DISASTER for this country'<br />Author: 'Pewdsubzero'<br />id: 'ka10ua'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li>

This is at the same time when the govt is making an active effort to become more digital, which seems a little paradoxical.\n\nIn some instances the high taxes has positive effect such as Samsung opening Asia's biggest smartphone manufacturing centre in India.\n\nAlso this is happening at a time of economic distress due to Covid. \n\nThe govt other than buying 2 VIP commercial jets (although I guess the orders for that were placed long before Covid), is also building a new parliament building.\n\nTypically during such times any Keynsian follower would advise on investing in infrastructure that can be monetised. This would also act as short term stimulus for the daily wage earner.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on tax increases and the agenda of the govt expenditure?"<br />Author: 'tryingmybest8'<br />id: 'k9zbvq'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

You can downvote me to hell, I don't really care, but just think and introspect for a second. Jokes are all fine, but constantly targeting a community (you all know which community) and making non-constructive degrading jokes, such as those of incest and bestiality, as if these things don't happen in Hindu society as well stinks of hypocrisy at worst and self-indulgent ignorance at best.\n\nI am a right-winger, but whenever I see a repulsive meme of Muslims and now recently the Punjabi Farmers Protest, labelling them all as Khalistanis and stuff, I don't want to be connected to the poster in any way, even though we might espouse similar politics. I am not saying that we should become some sort of intellectual opposition to randia(and if we are, we are doing a horrible job of it), as this subreddit is for memes and jokes, but we should not make our subreddit exclusive to a political spectrum. I honestly can't imagine myself being a Muslim being felt welcome to this subreddit. If jokes were pointed at all communities, then it would be a different matter. Jokes are supposed to be something both the recipient and the giver should be able to laugh over. If I am wrong about any assumptions or experiences that I have mentioned here, I will be more than happy to correct myself.

Some time ago, I was in a company of lawyers who were putting their criminal minds to work and I eavesdropped. \n\n&gt;Suppose you are a judge or an govt official in a responsible position. You could be blackmailed into doing something illegal or unlawful. That would  undermine the confidence of citizens in the system, which in a long run would cripple our institutions. China would be selling all these personal data to ISI funded criminal gangs in our country. It's a very serious situation which is still not getting enough attention.\n\n&gt;For example, look at whats happening i Australia.

<li>Title: 'How do you think these protests against farm bills would end?'<br />Body: "They have started it. It doesn't look like govt is in a mood to rollback any of the laws. \n\nThey've called for Bharat bandh. I don't think anyone would give a shit about it elsewhere. Tomorrow morning they'd read in news papers how everything in the rest of country just went about their business.\n\nTomorrow there seems to be another round of talks. They'll bring their own food, eat their own biryani and return back empty handed from those talks. Then what?\n\nAs the time progresses, while the rest country gives two straws about their protests, govt will simply call them for another round of talks have tea.\n\nThen what?\n\nOn what conditions would they likely be withdrawing? What would be a likely face saver? Suppose they won't get any such face saving gesture from govt, what would they do?\n\nIn short how do you think all this drama would end? I mean, without violence. I am quite apprehensive that should these protests go on until the upcoming Republic day, when Boris Johnson is due to visit, there would be a replay of Shaheen bagh riots in Delhi. I just hope it doesn't end that way!"<br />Author: 'ennis-jahsiah'<br />id: 'k8x68m'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li>

It's better and important.\nSince if we don't we can easily beakup again . \nCongress comes to power. Even Aimim which is echoing Muslim dalit propoganda while actually wants to islamise the worldview Muslims in India have been thinking. \nBjp needs to have more Muslims who act like muslims to be the guider of community rather than keeping muslims apart. \n\n*****Danger approaching******\nSecular Muslims are in far more danger .
