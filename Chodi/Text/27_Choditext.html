One that spans from Afghanistan to Burma.\n\nMy input would be that as a true Sanatan Dharm Rashtra, we should be inclusive of everyone and anyone (religion included), with certain exceptions such as people who wish to defeat the purpose of this Bharat (as an example).\n\nInstead of Death Penalties, we need to have rehabilitation and de-radicalization programs, instead, focus on community service so that every person serving in "jail" will also be a member of building our society and being responsible for it.\n\nSTEM subjects need to be given great importance with the motivation of old scholars like Aryabhata, Panini, and others. However, we should also give equal importance and focus to other areas of education like Arts and Commerce.\n\nWe also need to be a beacon of hope to cultures other than our own, such as the old African religions, and Native American religions, because I personally believe that they are another sect of Sanatan Dharm due to what they believe in (such as the Sun, Animals, etc).\n\nLet\'s keep this civil and hear inputs from everyone'<br />Author: 'AQuarantine'<br />id: 'k2m352'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

So the locals answered his question by saying the hillrange is called varahagiri and there was a temple on top of the hill of varaha swami.\n\nWe all know varaha means a boar in sanskrit, since it is "unholy" for ms to touch pigs they left the temple and the hill and went back.\n\nThe entire sanatana Dharma had to ensure many many hardships like this the damm leftists lecture us on being intolerant.\n\nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/RHv75dCJa61hYetQA \n\nThis is the plaque from the tirumala temple.'<br />Author: 'sprx7767'<br />id: 'k27d2n'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li>

We are keeping snake in our home and its just a matter of time, I am pointing to the radical Muslims, but guess what a secular Muslim also never criticize the wrong doing of a radical Muslims which bothers me. Within Hindu community you won't find that. By the time Hindu realizes it will be too late. It is very high time to bring the common civil law on the table because with this fertility rate of Muslims in our country Hindustan will soon become Muslistan.

<li>Title: 'Seizing the means of production'<br />Body: "We often see how the leftist claim that for the revolution to be successful, the proletariat must seize the means of production from the bourgeois.\n\nIt is true, and we must listen to this advise. The bourgeois are a group of unelected induvidual who decide what to produce, how to produce, when to produce. They live off the exploitation of the proletariat, who are the majority in the world.\n\nIn the modern India the same is happening. The academic printing press and institution like colleges and think tanks are run by a small elite whose ideology is defunct and is rejected by the electoral. The total seats all the communist combined won in Lok Sabha after all the efforts were 5 seats. But most of the Prof who are living of Govt salary are communist, the newspapers are run by leftist editors, the academic press succumbs to the leftist pressure. \n\nThis must change, the many should gain control over the means of production. There is no issue with people have opinion, but the issue is when the small elites suppress the voice of the majority. Two prominent examples are coming to my minds. \n\nThe first is a recent one of Jordan Peterson wanting to publish a self help book, and the leftists literally started crying and wanted to cancel his book publishing [https://www.foxnews.com/media/penguin-random-house-staffers-reportedly-breaking-down-crying-over-publishers-release-of-jordan-peterson-book](https://www.foxnews.com/media/penguin-random-house-staffers-reportedly-breaking-down-crying-over-publishers-release-of-jordan-peterson-book)\n\nThe second one is the Delhi Riots book that was pulled out in the 11th hour [https://www.thehindu.com/books/bloomsbury-says-it-wont-publish-book-on-delhi-riots-after-social-media-backlash/article32420501.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/books/bloomsbury-says-it-wont-publish-book-on-delhi-riots-after-social-media-backlash/article32420501.ece). \n\nIn Peterson's case, his previous book was a mega hit with 5 million books sold, making it one of the best sellers of this century, so it was a common sense decision to give him a new contract 50 lakh legally purchased books. Mazak thodi hai. Delhi Riots book was a super hit by Indian standards as well. The authors were not known public figures, yet their book crossed the 30,000 mark within the first few days, and I am not sure about the exact details, but people in online were saying books above 15,000 sales are considered as hits.\n\nIf the few elite wield enough power to shut down the voice of many, then should't by the communist logic they must be opposed. What do you think the outrage would be if book publishers stopped leftist writers from publishing because the right wing did not like? \n\nThere is only solution that I could think of. The majority must not buy books from the institution that panders to the elites. The book publishers who give equal opportunity to the many must be accepted. \n\n**You already vote with your feet when you move from a socialist city/state to a capitalist one like Bangalore, Hydrabad, Mumbai.** \n\n**You vote with your eyes when you made all the elitist visual media journalist lose TRP and start their own Youtube channel because no one was watching them and they were fired.** \n\n**You already vote with your hand every five years in the election.** \n\n**Now start voting with your wallet, and only support the printing press that supports your views.  Be it in form of purchasing books, or giving ads to print sources.** \n\n**Denounce the other sources like the leftist elites denounce yours.**"<br />Author: 'RKO_12'<br />id: 'k214wz'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

But I guess they knew Hindus are so divided They couldn't think a party can rule for 10 years who follow hindutva as core values. \n Uptill now I believe Congress and even Other politicians including Bjp understood reservation is only way to save lives and stop unwarranted protests. It's due to pandering to wakqs and ullemas Muslims couldnt speak Against Congress and their soft Islamism and secularrism.  \n Rss did major work till 2014 to push Bjp where it stands now.

Later on he noticed, Hindu Nationalism was on the rise, so he jumped on this bandwagon of Hindutva. Again once the issue of Bihari/UP immigrants came, he started using the Marathi-regionalism for his benefit. If he was so virat, he wouldn't have allowed 26/11, 93' blasts and many other radical islam-induced things to happen, or if it was out of his control, at the least he wouldn't have allowed so many Bangladeshi Rohingyas to enter Maharashtra (Mumbai folks especially know what I'm talking about). Not only this, Shivsena totally hindered the progress of Mumbai's development by their control on BMC (which is probably the shittiest municipal corporation ever, probably even some poor country of Africa would have a better municipal corporation). Also, it's no open secret that many Mumbai politicians (including Shivsena) were hand in glove with Underworld crooks like Haji Mastan, Dawood, etc. With so many flaws, I don't understand why the right-wing community praises this guy so much that he's now considered a Hindutva icon. Maybe it's because there are very less Hindutva icons so we always look eager to declare a personality as one at the slightest opportunity.\n\nTL,DR : Thackeray Sr. was all talk, no action opportunist and only slightly better than current ShivSena"<br />Author: 'PotentialBattle'<br />id: 'k0ye3x'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li>

He and Farooq Abdullah share family relations. He had links in Kerala. He was  gateway of Arab money to India.\n\n4. He controlled entire media chain. He is the one on whose command Vineet Jain thrown Arnab out from Times Now. His people are placed in all the channels.\n\n5. There are fleet of corporate cadres under his influence like Nilekani, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Narayan and many NGO runners.\n\n6. He was  the one who backtracked three orders when RAW had got Dawood. From Samjhauta, Ajmer to Mumbai blast, he managed everything from media narrative to Home ministry.\n\n7. He recruited everyone between 2004-2014 from judiciary, secretary to media editors.\n\n8. You can imagine his power that he jailed sitting Home Minister Amit Shah for more than 4 months and his entire state\n intelligence team for 8 years led by DIG Vanzara. He was so powerful that he grilled sitting CM Narendra Modi for 13 hours. He compelled Amit Shah to leave Gujrat.\n\n9. He was the man behind Augusta Westland to Spectrum. He was prime broker. Sonia Gandhi favored Ahmad Patel more than Rahul Gandhi.\n\n10. He openly captured 44 MLA and had wasted crores in resort. Neither media nor law asked him how he could do that.\nHe is not in power though he had shown his power when he required 45 votes knowing that he would get 44 votes only. He went to EC and EC disqualified 2 votes within hours. Video shows no malpractice and one can check the video. Despite the presence of NDA cabinet ministers Ahmad Patel made sure EC make him winner.\n\nThis is equal to winning of a state election. He reduced Congress from 57 to 42 but Congress made sure he wins. He was the lifeline of Sonia Gandhi\n\nRIH'<br />Author: 'civ_gandhi'<br />id: 'k0uq94'<br />Flair ::Whatsapp: WhatsApp Forward</li>

<li>Title: 'PES University Bangalore taking major health concerns'<br />Body: 'Greetings bhratas.\n I am a student of PES University, Bangalore. \nI am writing this mail because of decisions taken by our college management which I feel have not been appropriate from an academic point of view as well as keeping the current pandemic in mind. These are some key points:\n\n1) There are two mid-semester exams in each sem taken by our college. Till last semester it was computer based mode but from this semester itself they have made it pen-paper mode. Though they have given an option to skip it and directly give End Semester exams (ESA) with an increased weightage, but it\'s still all in OFFLINE MODE. Best of two offer for the first time has been announced for college for students giving ISA, leaving us in dilemma to go to campus or not. 2nd ISA is currently happening in campus.\nLabs have also been made offline.\n\n2) ESA is scheduled in December MANDATORY IN OFFLINE MODE. For the namesake of giving option, they have given us a chance to either give it in December or in next semester along with that semester exams. It is almost impossible for a student to give 2 semesters\' exam together. So practically it\'s not an option and forcibly all of us have to give exams in December in campus. \n\n3) When most other colleges have much before declared that all of their college activities would happen via online mode, PES has chosen not to even consider the option. A huge number of students study here and from all across India which makes it very difficult as well as risky to go to college.\n\n4)  Since August, Hostel Management have taken decisions that are not student-friendly. Today most students have paid the hostel fees and are in hostel right now. No SOP is being followed in the hostel, students are sharing rooms, attendance daily and mess coupons distribution weekly through queueing or grouping. No social distancing is being followed/enforced.\n\n5) Consent form is being taken from student\'s parents but the form is very unclear. It talks about classes but not exams however, the exams are the issue. College clearly wants to force people to make a decision but not have any liability on themselves. \n\n6) College is allowing students to enter even WITHOUT COVID TEST report. People are even producing month old tests which college is encouraging/ accepting. There have been numerous incidents where students are gathering as they believe college is taking precautions. There is no enforcement of Social Distancing either.\n\n7) Covid Testing was done on the college campus in one location with no social distancing. However one student from that area has tested positive and many students are yet to get their results, yet college is still allowing them to write their exams. The college has been completely ignorant about the fact and does not respond to us. \n\n8) Since a long time, we students are trying to contact our college management and convey our concerns. But each time they neglect us. There has been minimum communication whereas, during a pandemic, it should be ample. The only communication is a monthly live session where they have a one-way conversation with the students. \n\n9) Parents and students have sent mails across to our higher management as well which have been ignored. There has also been a case where one student received a reply in error where the pro-chancellor has asked the faculty to ignore the mail and "move it to spam"\n\nAll these things have led to a lot of fear among students and parents. It is adamantly clear that the management is not following the SOP\'s in place and therefore are putting our health at risk. \n Students have to travel all across from India risking their lives just to write exams when there is an alternate option available (online), which is being taken by other colleges. The Covid situation in Bangalore is not very good. We have seen and even have photos of people gathering in college but college authority takes no action regarding it.\nThe entire student community is very tensed right now. People living away from home are afraid of what to do if something were to happen to them. \nI am writing to you in hope that you will surely look into this matter and help all of us and our guardians. \nWould eagerly wait for your response.\nThanks'<br />Author: 'apookash55'<br />id: 'k05ve1'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li>

<li>Title: "The sad reality of the Indian 'Independence' Movement"<br />Body: "When we Viraats think of the the Swatantrata Andolan we are quick to blame Gandhi, Nehru, INC in general, CPI, Muslim League. However, we won't talk about Subhas Chandra Bose. Unfortunately the sad truth is that apart from Savarkar, a few Hindutva thinkers, and some crypto-Hindutva people in the INC (who generally had limited influence in the grand scheme of things), most of the major leaders had been either socialists of idealists. I had thought Bose was better but always had a sneaky feeling that he wasn't given that he had approached the USSR first and that Azad Hind Fauj's name and many songs were in Urdu. Recently I was send this blogpost about him on social media, I suggest you take the time to read it as it is quite big in multiple parts. [https://bharatendu.com/2011/02/10/subhas-chandra-bose/](https://bharatendu.com/2011/02/10/subhas-chandra-bose/)\n\nAmbedkar in his book on the partition had studied the Islamist mindset in depth and that is why the book provides a very logical understanding of how partition and the idea of Pakistan came to be and why most Hindus felt betrayed or were refusing to believe what was happening. (Not read all of it but got this much from the first two chapters). This limited understanding of the world stems from the idea of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam as we keep thinking that we should bring everyone along with us on our journey while others have already 'othered' us and not only want nothing to do with us but are even willing to be malicious against us. Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam is an idea with merit but it requires Hindus as a society and India as nation to be in a position of power. It is an ideology that may be adopted and promoted once India is a superpower in her own right not when we are working on an equal level with other countries. Sorry to digress, my main point is that while Bose certainly did damage the loyalty of the Indian army to the British, his ideology was bad and some of the actions that resulted from this had far-reaching negative consequences even in achieving his own aims (read the part of the blog that goes into what happened during the war)."<br />Author: 'thesaffronarmy'<br />id: 'k02u7i'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: 'What ambedkar said about a hindu sangathan or Hindu unity and the problems which make hindu sangathan impossible.'<br />Body: 'I know some here don\'t like ambedkar because he was critical of hinduism and hindus.\nLet\'s keep that aside for a moment and see what he had to say on hindu unity /sangathan.\nHe does have a point here about why hindus and "a hindu" is weak.\n\nShuddi here means reconversion or ghar wapasi\n\n&gt;The reasons which have made Shudhi impossible for Hindus are also responsible for making Sanghatan impossible. The idea underlying Sanghalan is to remove from the mind of the Hindu that timidity and cowardice which so painfully make him off from the Mohammedan and the Sikh and which have led him to adopt the low ways of treachery and cunning for protecting himself. The question naturally arises : From where does the Sikh or the Mohammedan derive his strength which makes him brave and fearless ? I am sure it is not due to relative superiority of physical strength, diet or drill. It is due to the strength arising out of the feeling that all Sikhs will come to the rescue of a Sikh when he is in danger and that all Mohammedans will rush to save a Muslim if he is attacked. The Hindu can derive no such strength. He cannot feel assured that his fellows will come to his help. Being one and fated to be alone he remains powerless, develops timidity and cowardice and in a fight surrenders or runs away. The Sikh as well as the Muslim stands fearless and gives battle because he knows that though one he will not be alone. The presence of this belief in the one helps him to hold out and the absence of it in the other makes him to give way. If you pursue this matter further and ask what is it that enables the Sikh and the Mohammedan to feel so assured and why is the Hindu filled with such despair in the matter of help and assistance you will find that the reasons for this difference lie in the difference in their associated mode of living. The associated mode of life practised by the Sikhs and the Mohammedans produces fellow-feeling. The associated mode of life of the Hindus does not. Among Sikhs and Muslims there is a social cement which makes them Bhais. Among Hindus there is no such cement and one Hindu does not regard another Hindu as his Bhai. This explains why a Sikh says and feels that one Sikh, or one Khalsa is equal to Sava Lakh men. This explains why one Mohammedan is equal to a crowd of Hindus. This difference is undoubtedly a difference due to caste. So long as caste remains, there will be no Sanghalan and so long as there is no Sanghatan the Hindu will remain weak and meek. The Hindus claim to be a very tolerant people. In my opinion this is a mistake. On many occasions they can be intolerant and if on some occasions they are tolerant that is because they are too weak to oppose or too indifferent to oppose. This indifference of the Hindus has become so much a part of their nature that a Hindu will quite meekly tolerate an insult as well as a wrong. You see amongst them, to use the words of Morris, " The great reading down the little, the strong beating down the weak, cruel men fearing not, kind men daring not and wise men caring not." With the Hindu Gods all forbearing, it is not difficult to imagine the pitiable condition of the wronged and the oppressed among the Hindus. Indifferentism is the worst kind of disease that can infect a people. Why is the Hindu so indifferent? In my opinion this indifferentism is the result of Caste System which has made Sanghatan and co-operation even for a good cause impossible.'<br />Author: 'rTx_101'<br />id: 'jzzzxv'<br />Flair ::CopyPasta: Copypasta</li>

Still, we remained connected to our roots. My siblings\nDoordarshan. So someday, I wanted my kids to imbibe our culture, but in their own way. We were at my parent\'s house a week before my due date, when my brother asked, Why aren\'t there any Hindu plush toys available? His wife was also expecting, so he\'d gone from store to store looking for a gift for her; there was nothing online either! There were unicorns &amp; Yodas but no Ganesh or Krishna. That got us thinking-maybe there were other parents Iike us; we could solve this. But was stressed about being a new mom along with my job-l wasn\'t ready to dive into a new venture. But my brother was passionate-by our daughters\' 1st birthday, he had a prototype created!\nMotivated, I eventually took the leap myself. My day would begin at 6 AM, l\'d drop my daughter to school &amp; go to work. Whenever found time, be it while commuting or bathing my daughter, I\'d work on our venture. After some to &amp; fro, we tested the prototype on my daughter &amp; niece; they loved their Baby Ganesh\'s &amp; hearing \'Ganpati Bappa Morya\' every time they squeezed it. That\'s when we launched Modi Toys. And the reviews since have been overwhelming! But honestly, it\'s about the comfort people have found in these toys. This one time a mom shared an image of her 4 year old who took his Baby Hanuman &amp; Ganesh for all his chemo sessions. Seeing his photo, I couldn\'t stop my tears.\nIn less than 2 years, we\'ve shipped to over 20 countries &amp; we\'ll start shipping to India soon too! But the best part is that people of all ages find solace in them. One lady gifted Baby Ganesh to her husband to announce her pregnancy, while another buried her stillborn alongside Baby Krishna. How does one put a price to that?\nIt\'s made me believe that what we\'ve created is more than a toy; it\'s a feeling. For some it signifies a new beginning, for others it\'s a source of strength.

This means I used to go to temples very regularly and loved taking part and enjoying the religious cultural festivals like [Theyyam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theyyam) as well as took part and in the communist party and their programs. This was very normal around here and definitely wasn't an out of behavior thing. I had my Muslim classmates who invited us during Ramadans, and we happily went there for the food. We invited them for [Vishu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishu) too.\n\nGrowing up without a TV, I picked up reading from early childhood and spend a lot of time reading many genres. I started reading philosophy including religious literature since the beginning of legal adulthood and have been doing and thinking about the same for more than 7 years. Now I think many of my beliefs in that area are cemented. I used the theoretical (scripture) and practical side (practice in the current climate) of religions and political ideas and evaluated them using rationality and my own set of morality to get to the conclusions naturally that I did.\n\nI am an agnostic atheist. I don't believe in any god in the sense that I don't pray to any. I still do take part in the cultural festivals including Theyyam because it was a very defining factor in shaping who I am as a person and I find them morally solid. I consider myself a Hindu as disbelief in God or Gods has been a historically propounded viewpoint in many of the *Astika* (Orthodox) streams of Hindu philosophy. Thus if someone asks me *if I am a Hindu*, I would say *yes*. At the same time, if someone asks me *whether I am a Hindu or an atheist*, I would go with the a*theist*, as I think this person is asking whether I am a conventional practicing Hindu, and I am not.\n\nI find the concept of religions a very destructive element to society but have no problem appreciating good practices like many elements of Jain religious culture. At the same time, I realize they are exceptions and don't make up for the terrible side, starting from crusades to the recent France beheading incident and many many immoral legally solid practices in Saudi Arabia.\n\nI am a great fan of Hindu mythology and have been reading them for as long as I remember. I think the Character of 'Shiva' to be one of the most interesting characters ever. I don't pray to Shiva, but would love to listen to Shiva Keertans or hang his pictures at home. Now I know if I called Allah a character, Muslims would be offended and they have a theological reason to do that. I don't know if any of you would be offended by me calling Shiva the same, but it doesn't change my opinion. **I love him, I don't pray to him**.\n\nI completely despise the set of ideas called Islam and I think we as a species have been very tolerant to a set of extremely bad practices for the long term under so-called secularism. I hate that the left doesn't address the religious fascism and the vast majority of immoral ideas of Islam in the magnitude it should be addressed. I don't think any religion that advocates death for people who leave the religion has any role in the new world.\n\nMy approach to Christianity is similar to that of Islam. Completely against their theological arguments and I am glad the left calls them out on their respective countries (unlike Islam).\n\nThe left in every country criticizes the majority religion and their immoral ideas and I am all for that, as long as they do that accurately. I in no way support arguing for the right to abortion while wearing religious body coverings. Misogyny covered under religious freedom is still misogyny and the left has trouble understanding that. There is also the problem of the absence of democracy in certain Islamic countries that banked to some major terrorist movement, which in the roots has theological support that goes unaddressed.\n\nI am not a communist party member anymore as I see their practices in my own home state to be very authoritarian and violent. Regardless, I think their ruling is slightly better than the previous Congress govt. I vote on elections based on who the person is and what their policies are as well as what their win means in the big picture of Indian/Kerala politics. I only voted once, around 5 years ago I think, and I voted for a communist party member who I knew personally. I voted for him based on who he is and would have voted for him even if he stood for other parties as I believe in his policies, which turned out to be as good as I thought.\n\nI have no problem with appreciating good leaders regardless of their parties. In BJP, there are leaders I despise and leaders I admire. I also hate the commercialization or exploitation of Hindu philosophy by certain 'Guru's like Mata Amrithananda Mayi or Sadh Guru while I align and support the majority of Swami Vivekanandan's priciples. I practice meditation regularly and learned from my older uncle, who was a Guruswamy (i.e went to Sabari Mala every year and was a huge Ayyappa devotee). He called it dhyana which is a religious practice.\n\nAs I am writing all this I am guessing I might not be someone you like. You may even consider me as an enemy of Hinduism in some way. But, I consider myself a Hindu in a spiritual sense and there are many more of us. I am also realizing that my interests may align with certain other subreddits like ' Hinduism ' more. Regardless, I would like to know where do I stand in your political or religious landscape. I am not made with sugar and won't melt so be honest and brutal as it needs to be.\n\nI hope you are managing well in these times and I hope and wish you and your families all the best in overcoming these trying times. Have a good Sunday.\n\nUPDATE: I posted the same in 'India' and the post is removed by moderators, I am guessing due to incorrect flaring.

<li>Title: 'Love jihad'<br />Body: "Let's face it, most of us cry about love jihad but we do nothing to fight it. An average hindu should be doing the following things:\n\n**1. Educate the women in your family.** It's difficult to be openly anti-interfaith with your friends. Your target audience should be your own family. Don't limit yourself to your sisters and daughters. If you're close with your relatives maybe educate them too. Women are naive, it's your duty to atleast educate the ones in your own family. \n\n**2. Groom yourself.** Muslim men are fetishized to a great degree. There's also a thrill that comes along when women rebel and enter a societally forbidden relationship. Only way to stop this is by making your own self desirable. Get off reddit, start working out, eat healthy, dress up like a normal human, don't be afraid to talk to women, take care of your hygiene etc. etc. (Refer grooming guides for more)\n\n**3. Socialise.** This is an extension of the second point. Be approachable and charming. Talk to people and be openly proud about your hindu identity. This will break the stereotype that orthodox hindus are boring and boomer-ish.\n\n**4. No sex before marriage people: find a viraat hindu chick, reproduce and raise viraat hindu kids. pro-casual sex people: fuck around with Mullis as much as you can** (goes without saying but do it consensually). Muslims did much worse with our women. Tit for tat.\n\n**5. If you're a grill be just be frank with your grillfriends.** Pretty sure there's atleast one muslim guy that your friend circle just drools over. When they talk about him just be honest with them about how you feel about dating muslims. Sugarcoat stuff if someone in your friend circle is already dating a muslim but never be stay silent because you're afraid of offending them. I'd anything you're doing them a favour.\n\nThese things are a bare minimum.

As Army is always seen as not accommodating to Muslims enough. This way plan of Islamist preachers to create horde mentality and country hating mentality will fail. As I see most are self employed and living on basic rations. Ignorant Hindus not caring about this will lead to mentality of Ms same like kashmiri Ms started hating Pandits since they were in elite posts and India sympathisers. (It's not just due to religion as Muslim haters believe so)"<br />Author: 'Trilokjit-Dey'<br />id: 'jyphge'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li>

<li>Title: 'r/DesiParentStories is a new subreddit for children of Desi Parents to discuss their experiences and the trauma a lot of us go through behind closed doors.'<br />Body: "Growing up, most of us get thrashed and beaten up by our parents with a variety of things. Our parents loved using belts, chappal, brooms and so many other things that should never even touch a child. We're brought up and told it's normal, that everyone goes through this. That our parents went through it too. We're told we should be greatful.\n\n\nThe abuse may even be verbal, with gaslighting and traumatizing name calling mixed in. It's not okay, and the point of this sub is for people to talk about the things they've experienced at the hands of their Desi parents and how they've been repressing it or how it has been affecting them. You're welcome to rant, vent out your feelings or talk about any instances that you want to get off your chest! The members are encouraged to be supportive and validate the person's feelings and experiences.\n\n\nOf course, not all of our parents are like this. Some of them are kind and prefer to solve issues with words and discussion over physical discipline, but that's not what this is about. \n\n\n[Here is the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiParentStories?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) to the subreddit. Everyone is welcome to join! Thank you for your attention! Let's break the cycle of abuse in anyway we can."<br />Author: 'CataleyaJackson'<br />id: 'jyf60k'<br />Flair ::star: OC ‡§π‡•à ‡§¨‡•á </li>
<li>Title: 'I was banned from r India sub just for a fairly neutral opinion. What a sick sub that is.'<br />Body: "There was a tweet of Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot which someone shared in r India in which he criticized BJP for ploting 'Love Jihad ' in few states. I just commented that I am not against inter religion marriages but I strongly oppose forced conversion and next this I noticed that I was banned from the sub. It pissed me off that you can't have a logical discussion on r India sub, if your comment doesn't meet the subs ideology then you ll be kicked out. Now I doubt who possibly is running that sub as this morning I saw an incomplete map of lndia and people in the sub are admiring it, I was like is some Pakistani's running this sub or what? Now that I am banned it doesn't matter but just wondering if others had similar experience in that sub."<br />Author: 'mangames'<br />id: 'jycxce'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li>

And all of this should be done, at 1/10th the cost of the existing competition. Some PMs would quit, most would tell you have gone mad....\n\nThat was the enormity of the task that was being faced by **Govt Officials**, in 1977, who wanted to do something about the fact that only 6% of India, had access to safe water. For the layperson, the answer is, why don't they just get pumps....\n\n\nUnfortunately, most of the pumps then were too expensive, not mass producible, too varied and so fragile, that 75% of the pumps, were inoperable at any given point in time. And women found it difficult to use, which was bad, because 80% of the water collection was done by them...\n\n\n**Enter Swedish engineer, Oscar Carlsson and UNICEF.**\n\nHe took existing pump designs, added uniformed jigs &amp; fixtures, mounted it on concrete and ensured water quality. He even took inspiration from oil rigs which drilled in rocks. Result was the India Mk 2 water pump.\n\n\nThis ubiquitous water pump, revolutionized India. By 1995, more than 2.5 million pumps were installed, ensuring a pump for every 150 Indians. More than 500 million people got access to safe water. Water borne diseases like Cholera reduced...\n\nWater, the vital ingredient of life, was no longer inaccessible. Not only that, the pump was so sturdy, that it might have been made out of adamantium. Because of this, we started exporting them to African countries, to solve their water woes. And it was a success there too.\n\nMany countries imposed heavy duties on all the pumps apart from the Indian Mk 2 pump. The India Mk2 pump was a transformative development, which changed generations. It also was a symbol of Indian innovation and proof that if we wanted to so something, we could.\n\nThe India Mk2 pump changed lives. And ensured one Swedish dude named Oscar Carlsson, who most of us, have no clue about, will forever be in our histroy books, as a guy who changed India. There is a nice paper written about the Mk2 pump and its story.....\n\n\nhttps://www.ircwash.org/resources/india-handpump-revolution-challenge-and-change"<br />Author: 'Baku-Madarame_UsoGui'<br />id: 'jxlixo'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

The kind of the exam that the aspirants have to go through, is based on colonial social theories, Leftist/Marxists theories of guilt like what‚Äôs wrong with us as a nation. \n\nThere‚Äôre no desi-centric theories. We don‚Äôt have our own theories on who we are. Everything is being imported. A bunch of people who think alike like west is being created. We‚Äôre outsiders in the way our own subject is being studied. \n\nWhat the West has given us becomes bible&amp; though, we have some Indian eliments, they‚Äôre very pejorative view of Indian ideas. For example they‚Äôre made to read The Hindu news paper which is anti-Hindu btw. In some or the other way it‚Äôll always try to demonise the actions of government no matter how good they‚Äôre. Even the op-eds in the newspaper are being fed to aspirants as knowledge. They take Romila Thapar as an authoritative source. They should rather make them learn how to think&amp;to have their own mind as opposed to feeding one set of ideologies. \n\nSo precisely aspirants have to pass a very negative and discouraging test of ideology/dogma which is masquerading as a test of knowledge. So we are indoctrinating the ideology of west into our aspirants and turn them to masterminds of a western lens so that an alien group could rule over us. This is why our civil servants are so disconnected from the common people of our nation. \n\nForget about NCERT text books or some western media but the bureaucrats who‚Äôre supposed to govern the country are being fed with this kind of things. It‚Äôs shame even after supposedly 70 Plus years of independence we couldn‚Äôt get rid of this colonised system. It‚Äôs far more shame&amp;disgusting even after many years of BJP rule which is allegedly Hindutva party it has not taken any seminal step to reform the bureaucracy to get rid of this remote controlled colonialism. \n\n\nPlease do let me know your opinions on this issue.

Voting Bjp isn't option coming to come together without caste barriers will help like Ms did for CAA reason why Congress appeased Ms."<br />Body: "I think we need a bill to make police force caste and religion neutral. A force which can work without political pressure Muslim or Hindu or caste identity politics. If we don't do this. Left wing will take advantage of rightwing govt and when demographics change the  reverse will be followed. identity breaking forces Hindu Muslim politics won't help. Your Dharma is on your own hand just know enough about others. I am telling this because I have seen cases are being politicised especially in dalit muslim victims in planned way and many cases the persons who are media trialed aren't criminals. Ppl need to get over sudarsan and ndtv type of bias. Gulnaz sheikh story 2nd twist i am getting is also because of her brothers taking Quran literally.If I trust  the one who interviewed girl but a Muslim journo wants to make the news communal.Where she said something else on camera where mother was but in reality she was in love with a hindu boy. Muslim brothers didn't like . She tried for suicide . Muslim mother's are more into Parenthood than moral hood hece victim game can easily be played on them and why hate for BJP RSS will remain even if sabka sath sabka vikas or muslim politicians join Bjp. This is how social divide and riot planning starts off in small scale. How political games are played democratically when rightiwng govt is winning even though they are the best option. The use of fear religion caste is a good weapon always have been. Youth is jobless but if they except The more dreadful parties to uplift them up then no God from heaven can save those or the community. Just a parts of Muslim community progressed are the ones who owned lands and the ones who migrated via mischief or backward classes given just basic amenities won't find secular parties cool and that's why LEFT and Islamic parties will rise.

He increased 36% toilet availability in 2014 to 72-80% in 2019.\nThen jan dhan yojana and many other successful and not so successful ones.\n\nThe point is Hindutva doesn\'t appeal to dalits and to poor OBCs and muslims who are majority of the population.\nIt may appeal to sections of hindu OBCs and to some UCs that make up 25-30% of Indian politics.\n\nI am guessing if everything goes right modi will serve a third term as PM but after that I don\'t think that BJP will remain in power there\'s no politician in BJP that appeals to majority(OBCs and SCs) like Modi does.\n\nWhat do you think will BJP remain in power after modi?'<br />Author: 'rTx_101'<br />id: 'jw952m'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li>
<li>Title: 'This needs to be said and people need to know'<br />Body: '1946 provincial election took place for the assemblies of British Indian provinces. These assemblies were to elect the members of constituent assembly. Separate electorate concept was implemented in the elections. Means, Muslims were to have their own separate represention in Muslim majority seats of each province. Provinces of then British India, which are now in India were:\nBengal\nPunjab\nBihar\nUP(United Provinces, later Uttar Pradesh)\nBihar\nCP(Central provinces. Today\'s Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh)\nBombay\nMadras\nAssam\nOrissa\nOut of these, Bengal and Punjab were partitioned. Assam\'s Sylhet district became a part of East Pakistan through referendum.\nLet\'s consider UP. In 1946 elections, 66 seats were declared Muslim seats and out of them 54 were won by Muslim League, which is roughly 82%. 1941 census report says, Muslim population in UP was 8,416,308. Very clearly. Next census took place in 1951. 1951 census report was created statewise. Because by then India had a federal structure. The report of UP doesn\'t directly tell the Muslim population (newly introduced political correctness. Thanks to Congress). It says that total population of Uttar Pradesh is 63,215,742 and Muslims are 14.28% of it, which is calculated to be  9,027,208. Provincial Elections were conducted, Muslim League was voted in thumping majority from Muslim seats, India was partitioned, and still the Muslim population in UP didn\'t decrease, instead some how it increased.\nSimilar patterns are observed in census reports of other provinces too. The psychology that created Pakistan still lives with us, right next door. Next time if someone says, "we loved India, that\'s why we didn\'t leave", never trust them even if they swear in the name of Ola or the book of Ola. They didn\'t leave because they couldn\'t. They didn\'t leave, cuz their lives were not as much threatened as the lives of Hindus in Pakistan. But they created Pakistan and they still live with us right next door. Think about it.'<br />Author: 'Raktcharitra'<br />id: 'jw871p'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: 'Will hinduism or sanatana dharma survive next 100-200 years?'<br />Body: 'our knowledge our dharma and our traditions will be wiped out of existence if we don\'t reform ourselves and our religion and put an end to superstitions and wrong practices.\n\nHinduism has no strict bound of interpretations unlike islam or xtianity i.e. it is open to reforms.\n\nWe must reform those aspects of hinduism that are actually wrong rather than escaping them.\n\nI don\'t know whether brits fabricated some of our texts or not but the fact remains that untouchability against dalits had been practiced for 2000+ years.\n\nShudras(OBCs) were not tortured like dalits and were employed in vast works like artisan,peasantry,dancers,etc. they were the working class of then ancient India.\n\nOfcourse left and islamists will now try to and have been trying to polarise them for last 50+ years and they will eventually succeed if we don\'t do anything about it.\n\nWe can justify untouchability against the "unclean" dalits but what happened was WRONG and it is still happening but RW doesn\'t want to discuss caste or caste system.\n\nDo you really want to be an elitist when we are not even a majority anymore?\n\nThink.\nMuslims are almost 20% of the population and majority of the 25% of dalits and tribals have switched to christianity or islam or buddhism but hide it to get caste benefits.\n\nOf the 35% OBC hindu population maybe half of them are religious and have their own cultures like jatts,yadav and gurjar hindus and other people from across India.\n\nThat leaves 18% of indian population to be Brahmins,baniyas,Kshatriyas. \nThe left 2% are majority Sikhs and jains.\n\nThe 18% of UC hindu population have lots of left leaning and athiest √ßu√ßks in their groups who don\'t give a fcuk about dharma and jerkoff to american and left media.\n\nBJP is not winning due to Hindutva that appeals to UC and some OBCs but it is winning due to poor OBC and dalits as they are promising development and have done good to help lower sections of society.\n\nBJP doesn\'t care about hindus they only want to be in power.\n\nIt is our responsibility to eradicate casteism and support OBCs we probably have lost dalits and they don\'t care about hindu identity we can be respectful to them though but if we work towards removing casteism and caste system as whole it can change.\n\nWe should work towards opening vedas for everyone which are the source of our religion. The vedas have no caste system and nowhere does it talks about birth being a criteria for someone to be a brahman or kshatriya.\n\n\nVajrasuchi\xa0Upanishad based on samveda debunk caste system.\nWe need to work towards eradicating discrimination if we don\'t do that I can assure you that in next 20 years Brahmins will be treated worse than jews in germany thanks to all the propaganda by left and Jai Bhim Jai MIM and also some reality to it.'<br />Author: 'rTx_101'<br />id: 'jvxx6l'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li>

<li>Title: 'LOL Sanghis says - "Hinduism is 12,000 old" - but it was ICE AGE IN INDIA - this sanghis don\'t know science ..LOL'<br />Body: " OK - Let debunk it - seeing this kinda screenshot 4th time.(most info here is from wikipedia but since it is scientific in nature - it can be trusted to a large extend.)\n\nFirst let's learn few things about ice age and what india looked like ?\n\nwas it a happening place - did some kind of human activity existed here or not? Was india habitable ?\n\nThe **Last Glacial Period** (**LGP**) occurred from the end of the Eemian to the end of the Younger Dryas, encompassing the period c.\u2009115,000\xa0‚Äì c.\u200911,700 years ago.\n\n**Last Glacial Maximum refugia** were places in which humans and other species survived during the Last Glacial Period in the Northern Hemisphere, around 25,000 to 20,000 years ago.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa and Australia were not affected by the glaciation although vast areas of them were too dry for human habitation of any sort, even by the most specialised and well-adapted foragers), and the Americas and New Zealand had no humans at the time. Therefore, the shelters were mainly in Eurasia(INDIA INCLUDED).\n\nVegetation of India (during this age) - Tropical Grassland(Majority) (Refer this map for more - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last\\_Glacial\\_Period#/media/File:Last\\_Glacial\\_Maximum\\_Vegetation\\_Map.svg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Period#/media/File:Last_Glacial_Maximum_Vegetation_Map.svg)) - it was not covered in icesheets or was not too dry!\n\n***Conclusion : So humans/homosapiens existed in India ,It was a habitable place with grasslands, it was one of the Last Glacial Maximum refugia ! Iceage doesn't proves lack of existence of some kind of Indian civilisation or religion.***\n\nHere I would talk about religion (and how it may have formed) on some scientific basis and evidences :(Taken from ***Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind*** \\- a book by Yuval Noah Harari)\n\nA brief History :\n\n2 million : Humans spread from Africa to Eurasia. Evolution of different human species.\n\n13,000 years ago : Extinction of Homo floresiensis. Homo sapiens the only surviving human species.\n\n*12,000 years ago: The Agricultural Revolution. Domestication of plants and animals.* ***Permanent settlements.***\n\nSo what happened after people started to settle up :\n\nAFTER THE AGRICULTURAL revolution, human societies grew ever larger and more complex, while the imagined constructs sustaining the social order also became more elaborate. Myths and fictions accustomed people, nearly from the moment of birth, to think in certain ways, to behave in accordance with certain standards, to want certain things, and to observe certain rules. They thereby created artificial instincts that enabled millions of strangers to cooperate effectively. This network of artificial instincts is called ‚Äòculture‚Äô.(The Arrow of History Harari, Yuval Noah. Sapiens (p. 206). Random House. Kindle Edition. )\n\nHow many different human worlds coexisted on earth? Around 10,000 BC our planet contained many thousands of them. By 2000 BC, their numbers had dwindled to the hundreds, or at most a few thousand. By AD 1450, their numbers had declined even more drastically. At that time, just prior to the age of European exploration, earth still contained a significant number of dwarf worlds such as Tasmania. ***But close to 90 per cent of humans lived in a single mega-world: the world of Afro-Asia. Most of Asia, most of Europe, and most of Africa*** (including substantial chunks of sub-Saharan Africa) were already connected by significant ***cultural, political and economic ties.***\n\n**Can some kinda religion/faith/belief system (hinduism) existed 12000 years ago?**\n\n**Were early humans capable of forming such group/tribes/identities/culture which we can call an early from of hinduism.**\n\nHow did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold(having a larger group), eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction.\n\nLarge numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. Any large-scale human cooperation ‚Äì whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe ‚Äì i***s rooted in common myths that exist only in people‚Äôs collective imagination.***\n\n***Conclusion : Existence of religion/myth/faiths is as old as homosepians - and these myths/faith/same believes took a new form after Agricultural Revolution(12,000years ago) - so science doesn't deny presence of hinduism(may be in some different form) 12000 years ago - but supports it!***\n\nHarari, Yuval Noah.
