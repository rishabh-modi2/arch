<li>Title: 'The John Cena/China controversy is something Indian netizens can learn from'<br />Body: "For those OOTL, John Cena just made a passing comment in the media referring to Taiwan as a country. Immediately facing online backlash, he issued an apology for hurting the sentiments of the Chinese people and retracted his statement within hours. His new movie is coming out and he doesn't want to piss off the huge China market. \n\nFor those of us who think India has a long way to go before we can project power the way China does, this incident shows that isn't true. The Chinese population has simply turned itself into an economic weapon - 'fall in line or lose access to this market'. No political intervention was required, no calls for government statement, just a bunch of proud Chinese folks stepping up to do their bit for the motherland. And clearly, it's keeping foreigners very much in line.\n\nInternet outrage can be a powerful tool in the hands of a populous country like ours. It was created by the American left, but in India, we can co-opt it with more success because, frankly, there are many more of us who love the country, than those who hate it. So next time the left makes fun of you for outraging over an ad or a celeb, remember that it's because they are scared of your power. They will make memes about your sensitivity, joke about how a global celeb doesn't care what a bhakt thinks, but in the end, you will win.\n\nYou guys don't need Modiji or the government to fight all the battles, because you're stronger than you think.

<li>Title: 'I THINK WE SHOULD START CONVERTING PEOPLE TO HINDUISM'<br />Body: "This is a sensitive topic that is rarely bought up so if you're a crybaby then skip \n\nEVERY religion encourages convertion except us. I beleive this is one of the main reasons why Hinduism is declining. I think we need to be more strict about our faith. When an interfaith relationship takes place it is ALWAYS the Hindu that has to convert regardless of being male or female. I feel that if you are a Hindu man marrying a non-Hindu woman you should make your wife convert to Hinduism. We also need to encourage our daughters and sisters to be proud Hindus. My older sister is currently engaged to a Sikh man and is going to convert to Sikhism. I am against this however our parents are completely cool with this.\n\nHe is a nice guy don't get me wrong, but why is she the one that needs to convert, why can't he?? This is not a one off occasion either. I go to university in England and it is extremely common to see Gujrati girls going out with Punjabi Sikh guys like it's a fetish. The same with Muslims as well. I feel like this stems from them not being raised with respect for their religion. If I were to go out with a Sikh or Muslim girl and I asked her to convert to Hindusim. 9 out of 10 times she would say no, where as a Hindu girl will always say yes. In fact I think we have become so weak that girls of different faiths would be taken a back by our request for them to convert as they expect us to be submissive. And in the end they'll just raise the kids in their religion anyway. I've seen this happen with one of my Malaysian friends. His dad is a Hindu and his mum is Muslim. His dad did convert as it is against the law in Malaysia to marry a Muslim woman otherwise. But his dad from what I know did it for convenience and is still a practicing Hindu. Despite this my mate has grown up to be a super religious Muslim who talks about the glory of Islam, even though he drinks 😂. \n\nBtw I'm not set on this opinion I'm open to changing my mind if you have any good counter arguments. I just beleive it will make our faith stronger and give our faith some respect if we are steadfast and start to convert those we marry. And state that we are raising our children with the ideas and principles of Sanatana Dharma."<br />Author: 'PatelGang'<br />id: 'nl0xsr'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

But on IndiaSpeaks one such post will be deleted right away, because mods fear the sub becoming political/drama place.\n\nDue to this, there is no safety mechanism there against Randiàns and Namazi librandoos. It is 100% upto the mod to decide whether he wants to ban a lurker or not. Usually he doesn't, most probably due to freedom of speech.\n\nSo with freedom of speech and intent to stay little less political, IndiaSpeaks mods can't stop lurkers and and won't allow any posts to motivate members  to shoo-away lurkers.\n\nWill IndiaSpeaks be taken over like bakchodí?"<br />Author: 'copper_wire_1mm'<br />id: 'nkxgss'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Your rejineation will be first step towards healing India and its people. If you really love this country which you called as your own, please please please rejine at the earliest.\n\nThough this is not the only issue for which you are responsible as there are plenty of them, but this is HUMONGOUS GENOCIDE.\n\nEdit: Thank you for giving awards to the post. But it’s a request, please don’t just give awards, ensure you educate at least 2 people in your circle about these people and ask them not to vote for these politicians and not to watch news channels which spread hatred and promote Thugs like Ramdev for money making.\n\nMany of you are asking, Why Nitin Gadkari?\n\nHe is the same man (equally responsible) who relaunched Coronil of Thug Ramdev along with Harsh Vardhan (Health Minister of India) with a banner educating this Thug Ramdev’s followers about WHO certification for Coronil (which was falsely stated). Just see the irony of India, the Indian media and public were told about a so called WHO certification for Coronil in presence of India’s Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, who also happens to be the Chairman of Executive Board of the World Health Organization (WHO). Their sins cannot be washed away even if they did some good work in the past/present. Also changing the formula to measure road development doesn’t equate to better work than predecessors. His name has also been involved in multiple corruption related reports where no independent enquiry was set up to investigate him. However, I am asking for his rejineation purely for Covid-19 related GENOCIDE in India.\n\nSome also asked, Why Pranoy Roy?\n\nBecause many times NDTV plays from both sides. I agree with the views that NDTV is ripping apart this Government on its handling of Covid-19, and has been doing so for many other issues as well. However, NDTV even though criticises Ramdev and his actions, but also let him use its platform to advertise Patanjali and Ramdev himself. I understand the money involved in running a channel, but that doesn’t mean to survive you start promoting a drug dealer, or a serial killer. Therefore, Prannoy Roy is equally responsible for promoting this con man to build his brand Patanjali, which is fooling India in the name of Swadesi/Swadeshi, Ayurveda, and what not.'<br />Author: 'from-andromeda'<br />id: 'nkoz8l'<br />Flair ::HighIQ: Randia Simulation</li>

<li>Title: 'List lf blunders by me. Last one can still be fixed.'<br />Body: "Here is the list of blunders that I've been collecting--\n\n1. Map of partitioned India-- We should've never agreed upon any map which gave Pakístan a coastline. If couldn't stop it, should've invaded and occupied the coastline immediately after partition. Pakístan should've remained landlocked. \n\n2. 1948 war of J&amp;K-- We should've gone through the war and should've reoccupied whole J&amp;K since it is one of THE most geopolitically important places on earth. With PoK, we would've borders with Afghanistan (hence west Asia), central Asia and there would've been no point of contact between Pakístan and China.\n\n3. 1955 Nehru Liyaqat pact -- nullified the point of partition. This pact said Múslíms could stay in India and Hindus in Pàkístàn like pre partition. Needless to say, Hindus, Sikhs of Pakístan got devoured into oblivion while the Múslím population is back at the same percentage it was in 1921. So we bought ourselves 75 years from partition, that's it.\n\n4. 1962-- Army was not well equipped by political leadership. Looming threat of China was not only ignored but Nehru was busy doing Panchsheel with China while  PLA troops gathered in Tibet to launch offensive. Lost Ladakh with critical river sources and watched like autistics while buffer between India and China, Tibet got engulfed.\n\n5. 1971 war-- This was not a victory, this was a massive loss on many levels. We not only gave the 93000 war criminals back, we forgot to bring back our own captive soldiers back from Pàkístàn, left them to torture and miserable death. Didn't hand over generals to Bangladesh for prosecution, didn't prosecute them in India either. Didn't force Pakístan to vacate PoK in return for 93000 soldiers. Didn't force Bangladesh to take back the runaways in India, which led to widespread demographic changes in West Bengal and Assam. Guess what that has done to West Bengal ans Assam.\n\n6. Morarji Desai-- ruined R&amp;AW. Dumped the opportunity to sabotage Pakístan's atom bomb development program and ratted out R&amp;AW agents to Pàkístàn. Lad received highest Pakístani honour Nishan-e-Pakistan for this treason to India.\n\nBONUS\n\n7.  BJP's mishandling of media-- knowing well what a disaster Rahul Gandhi's prime ministership can be, since he and his party are compromised to every breaking India force, BJP should've taken every single  to ensure that Congress doesn't even come close to power. BJP xan handle Congress, what it failed to handle is media, which has been trying to put Rahul Gandhi in the top seat. All BJP had to do was to buy the traitors in media or suppress them. But even with solid cases over NDTV and Wire BJP couldn't leverage them. Others like ThePrint are free to mouth off whatever the fúçk they want. Congress would've never allowed a vehemently anti Congress media. Neither did BJP make an international desk to address it's point of view in foreign media. Failures on media front are glaring and will lead to eventual fall of BJP, the first blunder BJP does, the traitors are ready with flashlights and fingers to point at."<br />Author: 'copper_wire_1mm'<br />id: 'njxsif'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
<li>Title: "Operation Kahuta: How Political Cowardice killed the Kaoboys and R&amp;AW's Most Daring Covert Mission"<br />Body: "Operation Kahuta. This operation undertaken by India’s Research &amp; Analysis Wing (RAW) **was one of its most daring and complicated of missions**. Despite its significance, people are greatly unaware of the operation and the unfortunate manner in which it ended.\n\nWhy Kahuta?\n\n[https://im.indiatimes.in/media/content/2017/Jan/2\\_1485328968.jpg](https://im.indiatimes.in/media/content/2017/Jan/2_1485328968.jpg)\n\nKahuta is a city in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. It is here that the Khan Research Laboratories was founded which was the home to the ‘Kahuta Project’, officially known as Project-706, a project meant to develop Pakistan’s first atomic bomb. The project ran from 1972 to 1983.\n\nWhat was Operation Kahuta?\n\nLaunched in 1977, the motive of the operation was to locate and confirm the existence of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons program. It is said that Israel’s intelligence agency, Mossad, also provided RAW with intelligence.\n\nUnder the leadership of R.N. Kao, the legendary spymaster, RAW had effectively built a network in Pakistan. RAW operatives in Pakistan picked up on information about a fissile material production facility. Priority of RAW was to pin point the location of this facility. However, this was not easy as Pakistan, post withdrawal of support from the French government, had started to maintain much greater secrecy with respect to the project.\n\n‘Hairy’ Investigation\n\nRAW agents were aware of various such facilities in Pakistan, but they still weren’t sure which one was the ‘motherlode’. It was impossible to infiltrate each facility. So, they planned ‘infiltrate’ a different kind of establishment – barber shops.\n\nRAW agents were surveilling Pakistani scientists. The agents went into barber shops that were visited by these scientists to collect the scientists’ hair samples. These samples were then sent for testing. Results showed that the hair contained radiation traces proving that the plant where the scientists worked was refining plutonium. This enabled the possibility to infiltrate and sabotage the plant.\n\nThe Traitor and Nishan-e-Pakistan Morarji Desai\n\nThe betrayal of the sacrifices and relentless work of the intelligence officers came at the hands of the then Prime Minister, Morarji Desai (oldest PM in office then). During his regime, there was great distrust between politicians and the intelligence agencies which may have played a role in what Desai did next. He used to think of these intelligence agencies as pawns of Indira Gandhi and interference in foreign policy\n\nFirst, he slashed RAW’s budget by as much as 40% which lead to RAW founder R.N. Kao frustrated and quitting. There couldn’t have been a more unfair and pathetic end to his awe-inspiring career. The Desai government also isolated and then successfully got rid of K.S. Nair who had been handed the RAW leadership after Kao.\n\nBack in Kahuta, after having confirmed the location of the plant, the next step of RAW was to get hold of the blueprints. A mole at the plant agreed to provide them in exchange for money. For any such ‘fee’ to be given,approval by the Prime Minister is essential. So, N.F. Suntook, the next head of RAW, took the matter to Desai for approval.\n\n**Instead of lending approval in national interest, Desai flatly denied support and even lectured the chief on how RAW/India shouldn’t interfere in Pakistan’s internal affairs!** But worse was yet to come. In an informal conversation with Zia-ul-Haq, Morarji Desai revealed details of RAW’s network in Pakistan and also confirmed that India was aware of the enrichment happening at the Kahuta facility.\n\nWhat happened next was on conceivable lines. Pakistan hunted the brave Indian officers on its land, killing many of them brutally. The entire network was neutralised, and this dealt an unprecedented setback to our Pakistan-specific intelligence by at least a decade.\n\nLater, on 19 May 1990, he was awarded with Pakistan's highest civil award Nishan-e-Pakistan for this contribution and bacame the only Indian national to receive it till date....\n\nConclusion\n\nWhat a sad tale indeed. What’s even more unfortunate is that no one has or will be held responsible for this act of treachery, whether intentional or not doesn’t matter. Had India been able to sabotage and deal Pakistan’s nuclear ambitions a blow, who knows if Pakistan would’ve tried to pursue its wild dreams again with the same gusto. There would’ve been a deep fear in Pakistan over India’s abilities.\n\nHowever, such betrayals aren’t a rarity. Jawaharlal Nehru’s indecision and even explicit idiocy cost the Indian Army numerous lives during the Indo-China war. From cutting funds for the army in fear of a coup to not paying heed to warnings of a Chinese ingress to forcing the IAF to stay on ground, Nehru took numerous decisions – or didn’t – that turned a war that could’ve seen parity in terms of its outcome into an outright disaster.\n\nMore detailed video  [https://youtu.be/ZKZhHaoYeE8](https://youtu.be/ZKZhHaoYeE8)"<br />Author: 'BaklolSalt'<br />id: 'njwobs'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>

It contained stately edifices decorated with flags and **hundreds of sataghnis (missiles)**.\n\nThe city with suburban towns on all sides had several female dancers and actors. It was filled with gardens and mango groves. And girdled by sal trees.\n\nIt was enclosed by strong fortifications and a deep moat. No enemy can ever enter and occupy that city. It abounded with several elephants and horses, cattle, camels and mules.\n\nIt was embellished with a host of tributary kings who used to pay tributes and with merchants from different countries.\n\nLike Indra's Amaravati, it was adorned by mountains and mansions with precious stones.\n\nWith groups of men and women and adorned with **seven-storied palaces**, it looked wonderful like a board where the game of ashtapada, is played. It was rich in all kinds of gems.\n\nIts dwellings were **constructed on levelled ground with no space left unutilised**. It was abundantly stocked with fine-grained rice and water which tasted sweet like sugarcane juice.\n\nThe city echoed with the sounds of trumpets, mrudangas, vinas and panavas. There was no city on earth superior to Ayodhya.\n\nLike an aerial car acquired by the siddhas in heaven through their austerities, the palaces were perfectly constructed in rows and inhabited by the noblest of men.\n\nThe city was inhabited by thousands of warriors known as **maharathas**. They were skilled archers and sharp-handed. They **would not** pierce with arrows, solitary persons, persons without defence, fleeing foes who could be tracked down through hints from sound. With sharp arrows or with the strength of their arms, they would kill roaring and inebriated lions, tigers, boars etc. in the forest.

As much as I enjoy liking the memes, it is hard for me to ignore our demise and the degradation of our ancestors who fought with honor and courage against the Mughals and the British. We must form a Fascist state to truly unite India; the goal? AKHAND BHARAT.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn order to achieve this, I have devised a plan and have broken it into steps we can follow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep 1: we must first kill anybody that spreads anti-indian propoganda. This calls for a mass genocide (or enslavement if you prefer) of communists, islamic state sympathizers, and left-wing media journalists like the Quint, and Christian missionaries.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep 2: Express our support to the military and the police. Those guys are not our enemies. We must gently remind them that our cause is their cause. Our fight is also their fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep 3: Raid all the politicians\' house, state and central. Seize all their assets to fund our goal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep 4: Bring together a greater India, that will not be a "nice" one.... to our enemies. Why do we donate money to Pakistan? Our great Chanakaya said to crush our enemies totally. Why the hell do we feed the hand that kills our brothers and sisters?  Why are we providing vaccines to countries that have abandoned us in the past? We should restore our economy by eliminating most subsidies  and decrease our interest rates to stipulate a free market economy. (Healthcare however should be subsidized for all).  There will be one law for all Indians and there will be criminalization of discrimination in terms of castes and religion (meaning no quotas also) .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe greater India will lead by values of Santana Dharma and will take back what once belonged to it. This includes land, and the cultural artifacts stolen by the Brits. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn order to achieve this, we will need at least 300,000,000 people. 60k on this sub is not enough to conquer a land of a billion people. As of now, I won\'t be able to lead due to lockdown. But if anybody puts this plan in action, I would still be very honored. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo those of you opposing this great cause, I ask you:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat good has democracy done for our country? \n\nLook what democracy is doing to USA, UK, and Australia?  Their wokeness is leading to their downfall. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe world will call us fascists, backwards, and other words. But we must never forget why we do this.  The same world will call us dirty, polluted, and shame us for our poor sanity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI say we take their advice and improve our great nation because I don\'t know about you guys, but I am sick and tired of listening to those hypocrites all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWE CANNOT ALLOW MUSLIMS TO DICTATE HOW WE LIVE IN OUR COUNTRY!\n\nWE MUST CONQUER ALL!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSincerely,\n\nAn Indian from Tamil Nadu.\n\nJAI HIND!'<br />Author: 'ComputerBoi69420'<br />id: 'nj2o15'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
<li>Title: 'When is a kingdom destroyed?'<br />Body: 'This is pretty important. There is an amazing similarity between Valmiki Ramayana and Vyasa Mahabharata. \n\n\nThere is a dark-skinned woman and a bald man that appear whenever a kingdom is about to be destroyed. \n\nIn Lanka, \n“kālikāḥ pāṇḍurair dantaiḥ prahasanty agrataḥ sthitāḥ |\n\nstriyaḥ svapnēṣu muṣṇantyō gṛhāṇi pratibhāṣya ca |” (Valmiki Ramayana 6:35:29)\n\n“Woman of black complexion and white teeth, chattering incoherently in dreams and robbing different houses stand in front, laughing loudly”.\n\nIn Dvaraka, as described in Mausala Parva of Mahabharata,\n\nkālī strī pāṇḍurairdantaiḥ praviśya hasatī niśi.\n\nstriyaḥ svapnēṣu muṣṇantī dvārakā̃ paridhāvati |” (MBH 16:3:1)\n\n“At that time the Vrishni ladies dreamed every night that a woman of black complexion and white teeth, entering their abodes, laughed aloud and ran through Dvaraka, snatching from them the auspicious threads in their wrists”.\n\nLook at the Sanskrit! It is almost exactly the same! Kali Stri Pandurair Dantaih, srriyah svapneshu, etc! So it is clearly the same Person!\n\nSimilarly the bald man,\n\n\n\npakṣiṇaśca mṛgāḥ sarvē pratyādityaṁ rudanti te\n\nkarālō vikaṭō muṇḍaḥ paruṣaḥ kṛṣṇapiṅgalaḥ |” (Valmiki Ramayana 6:35:35)\n\n\n“Birds and wild animals, facing towards the sun, cry out, witnessing Death, in the form of a frightful, monstrous, cruel dark and tawny fellow with a shaven head”.\n\n\nēvaṁ prayatamānānā̃ vṛṣṇīnāmandhakaiḥ saha.\n\nkālō gṛhāṇi sarvēṣā̃ paricakrāma nityaśaḥ |1\n\nkarālō vikaṭō muṇḍaḥ puruṣaḥ kṛṣṇapiṅgalaḥ.\n\ngṛhāṇyāvēkṣya vṛṣṇīnā̃ nādṛśyata kvacitkvacit |” (MBH 16:2:1-2)\n\n“[Vaishampayana said:] While the Vrishnis and the Andhakas were thus endeavouring (to avoid the impending calamity), the embodied form of Time (death) every day wandered about their houses. He looked like a man of terrible and fierce aspect. Of bald head, he was black and of tawny complexion. Sometimes he was seen by the Vrishnis as he peered into their houses”.\n\nAgain look at the Sanskrit! This is about Mahakala and it says " karalo vikato mundah purushah krsnapingalah"! Again the same Person! \n\nThis Mundaha word is used by Bhagavan Krishna to describe Rudra to Arjuna in Mahabharata Santi Parva, \n\nshrIbhagavAnuvAcha||\n\nkapardI jaTilo muNDaH shmashAnagRRihasevakaH |\n\nSimilarly, in Narayana Suktam of Veda when talking about the cosmic Purusha known by the name of Narayana , it says "puruṣaṁ kṛṣṇapiṅgalam,\nūrdhvaretaṁ virūpākśaṁ viśvarūpāya vai namo namaḥ." (Though Narayana Suktam is for Vishnu, and purusha krishnapingalaha just means a dark-skinned person, I found it interesting that the same word was used. Anyways Saivas consider Narayana Suktam for Siva so it would make sense in that way)\n\nWhy are They appearing though?\n\nKasyapa Muni explains to his disciple Aila \n\nIn consequence of the sins perpetrated by sinful men, the god Rudra appears in the kingdom. Indeed, the sinful by their sins bring upon them that god of vengeance. He then destroys all, the honest and the wicked alike (without making any distinction).\'\n\n- [Mahabharata Santi Parva](https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12a072.htm)\n\nRudra is the god of destruction, as Adi Shankaracharya comments on the 5th Name of Vishnu Sahasranama, Bhootakrita, as follows- "तमोगुणमास्थाय स रुद्रात्मना भूतानि कृन्तति कृणोति हिनस्तीति भूतकृत् [(Viśṇu) as Rudra, assuming Tamoguṇa, destroys all beings. Hence He is called ‘bhūtakṛt’"\n\nHence this is about destruction. Note that when it comes to a kingdom steeped in sin, Rudra does not look at who is honest or who is wicked - everyone is destroyed the way a forest fire ravages throughout the entire forest. Rudra is like that forest fire. \n\nHence it is important to always make sure the ruler of a kingdom, and of course the citizens as well, are following path of righteousness properly! Otherwise like with Lanka and Dvaraka, all are finished!\n\nJai Sita Rama'<br />Author: 'jai_sri_ram108'<br />id: 'nj2m6s'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm 🕉️</li>
<li>Title: 'All right you fuckers, listen up now.'<br />Body: 'It\'s exhausting spending time on this sub these days. There\'s either posts that (justifiably)amplify the plight of Hindus in Bengal or wherever, or tweet screenshots pointing out the double standards of our favourite hypocrites. But you know what always comes up after the upvote party? "Hindus are always asleep", "4 Hindus walk in one direction when carrying a fifth" etc. What good is that for the newcomers on this sub who have migrated from the official sub or the Bangalore sub or wherever? We KNOW there\'s a problem, that\'s why we are here in the first place. If we keep cribbing, there\'s no difference between the tantrums of a petulant child and this sub which is [remarkable at times](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/nin0up/the_first_20_verses_of_mahabharata_tatparya/), all credit to u/Darkstorm999.\n\nSo what do we do?\n\nFIRST OF ALL, remember that an overwhelming majority of India is not online like you and I are. Even among those who are, very few are on Reddit and even fewer still active on those subs. Go out and observe the locality around you. Most of them are local in their entire existence, from physical requirements (groceries and stuff) to the news they consume. All this media and online circus makes zero impact on the majority of people.\n\nSECOND, like someone had posted, just bemoaning the lack of a Hindu identity is not going to change anything. You need to rally the people around an ideal, a task. Take a look at [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptKRk1VPH0A) for example. People who understand Kannada can also watch [this](https://youtu.be/yzgYqUkWYkQ). He is rejuvenating lakes around Bangalore, and as a consequence the villages surrounding the water body are uniting in response. No divisive forces and separate happy people united in support of a common good. So go out and start/join activities that benefit the nature or people, and the punya will follow. Track these activities on a weekly basis on the sub and grow the community with this as another area of focus.\n\nTHIRD, quit tracking the BJP on a microscopic level. Nothing is going to change due to redditors ranting one way or another. Ranting about something, upvoting and not doing anything towards it is the literal modus operandi of the other sub. We do not want to be an bhagwa version of that sub. We want to be a sub that highlights Indic civilisation so the visiting folk can see the facts for themselves. BJP is a self-serving political party whose dharma is to win elections. It is NOT our spokesperson, no matter how much you want it to be. Fewer \'BJP bad\'/\'XYZ leader good\' posts please.\n\nFOURTH, we talk a lot about decolonising India. Start by decolonosing your minds. Quit consuming western media. People who live in America will confirm the suspicion I had that fewer Americans give a fuck about Friends or BBT or Suits or whatever. Stop being obsessed with cakes for all occasions and biryanis for office parties (although that is purely for kitchen-hygiene reasons lol). Start encouraging posts with local food (of which there are a few, to be fair) and center a few discussions around that.\n\nFINALLY, we have a lot of enthusiastic trekkers on this sub. It is no good moaning about the incorrect history taught to us when the real history lies a few kilometres from our cities. Start visiting these places, posting the pictures and telling their stories on the sub. I\'m sure people getting personal with their local pieces of lore will get traction here and help bust any agenda that might come in the future.\n\nTL;DR: Stop raising each other\'s BP here, go out and start DOING stuff for your community, strengthen your roots and lead a happy life.'<br />Author: 'NewUser5391'<br />id: 'nj2lke'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
<li>Title: 'Why should a kingdom focus on Dharma?'<br />Body: '(note -as always, Dharma is virtue and something more , rather than talking about a single school of thought)\n\nThe simple reason is because of this - \n\n"In consequence of the sins perpetrated by sinful men, the god Rudra appears in the kingdom. Indeed, the sinful by their sins bring upon them that god of vengeance. He then destroys all, the honest and the wicked alike (without making any distinction).\'"\n\n- [Mahabharata Santi Parva](https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12a072.htm)\n\nSo you being a good person makes no difference. Has this ever happened in Itihasa?  Yes, it happened in both epics actually!\n\nIn Lanka,\n\nkālikāḥ pāṇḍurair dantaiḥ prahasanty agrataḥ sthitāḥ |\n\nstriyaḥ svapnēṣu muṣṇantyō gṛhāṇi pratibhāṣya ca |” (Valmiki Ramayana 6:35:29)\n\n“Woman of black complexion and white teeth, chattering incoherently in dreams and robbing different houses stand in front, laughing loudly”.\n\nAnd In Dvaraka, as Mahabharata Mausala Parva describes\n\nkālī strī pāṇḍurairdantaiḥ praviśya hasatī niśi.\n\nstriyaḥ svapnēṣu muṣṇantī dvārakā̃ paridhāvati |” (MBH 16:3:1)\n\n“At that time the Vrishni ladies dreamed every night that a woman of black complexion and white teeth, entering their abodes, laughed aloud and ran through Dvaraka, snatching from them the auspicious threads in their wrists”.\n\nNotice the usage of words! The Sanskrit is almost the same between Ramayana and Mahabharata to describe Goddess!!\n\nAgain,\n\npakṣiṇaśca mṛgāḥ sarvē pratyādityaṁ rudanti te\n\nkarālō vikaṭō muṇḍaḥ paruṣaḥ kṛṣṇapiṅgalaḥ |” (Valmiki Ramayana 6:35:35)\n\n“Birds and wild animals, facing towards the sun, cry out, witnessing Death, in the form of a frightful, monstrous, cruel dark and tawny fellow with a shaven head”.\n\n“vaiśampāyana uvāca\n\nēvaṁ prayatamānānā̃ vṛṣṇīnāmandhakaiḥ saha.\n\nkālō gṛhāṇi sarvēṣā̃ paricakrāma nityaśaḥ |1\n\nkarālō vikaṭō muṇḍaḥ puruṣaḥ kṛṣṇapiṅgalaḥ.\n\ngṛhāṇyāvēkṣya vṛṣṇīnā̃ nādṛśyata kvacitkvacit |” (MBH 16:2:1-2)\n\n“[Vaishampayana said:] While the Vrishnis and the Andhakas were thus endeavouring (to avoid the impending calamity), the embodied form of Time (death) every day wandered about their houses. He looked like a man of terrible and fierce aspect. Of bald head, he was black and of tawny complexion. Sometimes he was seen by the Vrishnis as he peered into their houses”.\n\nAgain same language! Look at the Sanskrit, and the same omens! The Sanskrit describing the man in both is  Karalo vikato mundah purushah krsnapingalah!\n\n"Mundah" this word means shaved head and is employed by Sri Krishna when describing characteristics of Rudra to Arjuna in another chapter of Santi Parva-\n\nshrIbhagavAnuvAcha||\n\nkapardI jaTilo muNDaH shmashAnagRRihasevakaH |\n\nAs for krishnapingala, though I don\'t know if this is a reference to that, Narayana Suktam of the Veda calls the Purusha named Narayana as "puruṣaṁ kṛṣṇapiṅgalam,\nūrdhvaretaṁ virūpākśaṁ viśvarūpāya vai namo namaḥ."\n\nAnyways leaving that aside, it is clear that Rudra and Kalika appear for destruction of a kingdom and destroy all, whether sinful or virtuous. \n\nThink about it. Dvaraka had Krishna and Balarama in it! Of course it was Bhagavan Krishna\'s wish to destroy Dvaraka and hence that is the only reason it happened. I\'m not saying it was Krishna\'s sin or that He could not stop it, obviously as Vyasa Mahamuni tells Arjuna later on, Krishna could\'ve stopped it but He chose not to.  \n\nBut I think one can understand why now. If the majority is sinful the kingdom is gone. Or rather, if the ruler themselves are sinful (not the case with Dvaraka though), then the system itself is destroyed and destruction awaits. Simply because the citizens can only follow the king due to their limited power and hence if the system is sinful, they also partake in that sin. Hence why we should elect leaders properly. Otherwise, see what happened to Lanka! No amount of wealth saved it because the king himself was a rapist. \n\nOne way to avoid this fate is given here in the Taittiriya Brahmana says,\n\n"The king offers the third libation of blood of the slain sacrificial horse by means of a bronze cup. The people certainly are of bronze, and the Agni Svishtakrt is Rudra. He thus shields the people from Rudra, and in the country where this libation is offered, Rudra does not attempt to injure the people."\n\nBut obviously the focus on Dharma can\'t be limited to a sacrifice. The leader must be good in general too. \n\nJai Sita Rama'<br />Author: 'jai_sri_ram108'<br />id: 'nj1mag'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm 🕉️</li>

And the latest episode was on India's role in the two world wars. It will air a repeat at 12 pm and 5:30 pm today. If you are interested in Indian history should give a watch. Yesterday at midnight when I watched the episode I was shocked seeing the two historians who came on the panel dissing Gandhi and Nehru. They highlighted issues like Forced requirements of Indian troops. With Gandhi himself going village to village during the first world war to recruit soldiers. The show gave a good look on India's struggle during that period and how our revolutionaries wanted to take the advantage of the war but Gandhi and the Congress under him supported Britishers on the promise of a dominion status for India. This same view of the revolutionary finally became a reality due to the Herculean efforts of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and the INA. If any of you are interested in Indian history and want to see something about the real history of that era other than the Gandhi Nehru version you should have a look."<br />Author: 'muzanshigaraki'<br />id: 'nj0ndd'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: "People are saying that Modi's tears were crocodile tears, I somewhat partially agree but I also partially disagree."<br />Body: 'Ah, so you people might have now know about that Modi speech in which he cried and then said "We have lost so many loved ones to covid19". Many people are saying it was just an acting and that he should deserve an Oscar award. I partially agree that he cried to get attention but he\'s a pretty unpredictable person. For most of his speeches, he has always remained calm and patient, he has sometimes got angry in some of his speeches but for most part he\'s pretty unpredictable.\n\nAs far as I know, I heard from some article that Modi has also lost many people he knew or were his relatives. He lost his aunt in April [https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/pm-modi-aunt-narmadaben-covid-19-treatment-ahmedabad-1795622-2021-04-27](https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/pm-modi-aunt-narmadaben-covid-19-treatment-ahmedabad-1795622-2021-04-27). I think he got emotional because of people who he knew that have passed away. \n\nNow many people are saying that no country\'s leader cried in front of TV. They never cried but were angry, the Brazil PM even got as far as saying the virus is a bioweapon in public TV. But Modi is an exception, you may believe it or not but he\'s a person who you can easily talk to in public.\n\nSaying that he murdered people or is having crocodile tears is something I also disagree with. If he didn\'t cared about the people and nation, why would he put lockdown in the 1st place during the 1st wave? He did care about the people, but, I am still not able to comprehend why he didn\'t do any same thing for 2nd wave. Sure he did some meetings but he also contradicted himself in rallies and during election.\n\nAnd also he cried for a sentence which is true to many of us, we have lost so many loved ones die to the virus. I don\'t think any other leader can express his grief in front of TV'<br />Author: 'Accomplished-Bad7625'<br />id: 'nj0aqu'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Do we all think that all Engineers will go to US and UK and with this thinking we started teaching them in English??\n\nWe have so many forts and complex designs in our country and I tell you no engineer of that time studied in English.

<li>Title: 'Conspiracy Saturday: Teletubbies'<br />Body: 'I used to watch Teletubbies when it began airing on DD Metro and I absolutely loved it. But do you know the ultra-liberal West which lectures India on smallest of issues regarding Freedom of Expression managed to find even this innocent show affecting their children in frightening ways. Some of the arguments are quite...well read the following and decide for yourself:\n\n1. Tinky Winky was a gay icon: According to parents, the tallest purple tubby Tinky Winky was influencing their children to become gay because he carried a purse and had a triangle shaped antenna on his head and was of purple color.\n\n2. Teletubbies was about forced domination of a planet and the Sun Baby was some sort of a Big Boss who controlled the slaves which were the tubbies\n\n3. Teletubbies never spoke meaningful words and engaged in baby talk which hampered toddlers to learn human speech.\n\nI\'m now excerpting an article from CBC Radio:\n\n1. The baby sun is actually a demon\n\nAt the beginning of each episode, a sun rises and the centre of that sun is a baby\'s face. Some claim to see a demonic visage take over the baby\'s face as it expands, just for a second, right before it explodes, thus sending subliminal horrific images to children everywhere. Once you see it, you can\'t unsee it.\n\n2. The\xa0Teletubbies\xa0are\xa0biogenetically\xa0engineered slaves\n\nDefinitely one of the more out-there theories. What\'s the proof? There is no official\xa0backstory\xa0on the creation of\xa0Teletubbies, but it\'s clear to some that the\xa0Teletubbies\xa0are not in control of their own destiny. A mysterious "voice" tells them when to do everything, from eating to sleeping. There is also a vacuum-like character, the Noo Noo, who is constantly keeping the\xa0Teletubbies\xa0in check, making sure they follow orders. Then there\'s the Pinwheel, a godlike structure at the top of a hill that causes the\xa0Teletubbies\xa0to drop whatever they are doing and\xa0fall to their knees and worship whenever it spins. The Pinwheel then picks its favourite character and turns on it\'s tummy TV. Carrot and stick. It\'s all very Big Brother.\n\n3. The Teletubbies are hypnotizing your children\n\nNever mind what follows next: microphones pop out of the ground and chant, "time for Teletubbies" about a dozen times, which led many parents to boycott the shows because they believed it was attempting to brainwash their children.\n\n4. The strange Teletubbies and Harry Potter connection\n\nTeletubbies\xa0and\xa0Harry Potter, both released in 1997, are linked. The\xa0proof? Look no further than the strange antenna on the heads of Tinky Winky, Dipsy, and Po. Their three symbols, when combined, form the symbol for the Deathly Hallows, a key element in JK Rowling\'s\xa0Harry Potter\xa0universe. Still not convinced? Laa-Laa, the yellow Teletubby, has a lightning bolt as their\xa0antenna, strangely similar to the lightning bolt scar on Harry Potter\'s forehead.\n\n5. They\'re giants in real life!\n\nThey look cute and tiny onscreen but in real life they are actually 10-foot-tall giants! Actually, this part is\xa0true.\n\nIf you think these are the musings of just a fringe group,. Teletubbies show was actually banned on these complaints.\n\nNow, just two videos to make your dreams sweeter:'<br />Author: 'dreamerimagine1'<br />id: 'nin2ya'<br />Flair :Wholesome Bakchodi :danklaugh:</li>
<li>Title: 'The first 20 verses of Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya'<br />Body: 'Pranam friends. I had started reading Madhvacharya\'s Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya, which includes verses that explain the creation of the world for its first chapter. It also includes the entire Ramayana and Mahabharata. For obvious reasons, I didn\'t post those.\n\nBelow I have put the first 20 verses of the first Adhyaya, which is called \'Sarva Sastrartha Nirnaya\'. There are actually 138 verses in this first Adhyaya, but I feel that these 20 verses are enough to give people a good idea of what to expect, and hopefully you will decide to read the Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya after this.\n\nThe verses are in unaltered Sanskrit. The verses that are a part of the Adhyaya\'s first 20 verses will be in quote blocks like\n\n&gt;this\n\nOther Sanskrit verses taken as references will be shown normally without any quote blocks.\n\nThe *italicized* words is the direct translation of Sanskrit verses into english. And all the regular text are notes and supplements to help in understanding.\n\nWhile I was reading this, I found some complications, and so I had to do my own research. Some of the notes for the verses have been written by me, which I have denoted like `this.`\n\nAnd there is one small caveat to all of this. There are a few assumptions I have made here. Whichever assumptions I have made, I have backed most of them with evidence from other texts, but still I urge that you do your own research if you are doubtful. I am no expert in our scriptures and if you find any errors it would be much appreciated.\n\nSo, let\'s start then.\n\n&gt;ओं । नारायणाय परिपूर्णगुणार्णवाय विश्वोदयस्थितिलयोन्नियतिप्रदाय ।  \nज्ञानप्रदाय विबुधासुरसौख्यदुःखसत्कारणाय वितताय नमो नमस्ते । १.१ ।\n\n*1. Repeated Pious Salutations to Thee, Oh, Narayana who is like the ocean of all attributes, who is cause of Origin, sustenance, destruction and supreme guidance of universe, who is the giver of all knowledge, who is all pervading and who is the abiding cause of salvation to the Gods and damnation to the Asuras.*\n\nThis verse is also a brief summarization of the first four Adhyayas of the Brahmasutra.\n\nHere, Sri Narayana is addressed directly. This is because of the timeless presence of Sri Narayana that always exists everywhere(all pervading). This verse can be said to be a ‘definition’ of Narayana. This single term conveys not only who He is, but also how different He is from all others.\n\n`This verse tells us that He is the creator of all that exists. ‘Sustenance’ refers to the dependence that all of existence has upon Narayana. The universe is not independent from Narayana. He alone sustains it, and everything in it. He is also the one who will eventually destroy everything in the universe and the universe itself.`\n\n`Narayana is referred to as the ‘giver of knowledge’ because He alone knows all, and He readily imparts portions of this knowledge to those worthy. This ‘worthiness’ has nothing to do with worship, but it has everything to do with understanding. Worship is merely a way to immerse oneself.`\n\n`Narayana is the ‘abiding cause of salvation to the Devas and damnation to the Asuras’. This is a poetic way of saying that Narayana is just as supreme to the higher entities as He is supreme to us. Even to the mighty Devas, Narayana alone is the only way to be free from everything, and to the Asuras who are ever against the very idea of Narayana? For them, only damnation will be there. Sri Narayana is not a neutral bystander as many would like to claim. Through Sri Krishna, He has clarified as such: “Know, Duryodhana, that I identify myself with the Pandavas whose guide in life is Dharma.”`\n\n&gt;आसीदुदारगुणवारिधिरप्रमेयो नारायणः परतमः परमात्स एकः ।  \nसं शान्तसं विदखिलं जठरे निधाय लक्ष्मीभुजान्तरगतः स्वरतोऽपि चाग्रे । १.२ ।\n\n*2. This Narayana who is like the ocean of excellent attributes and who is (therefore) completely unknowable and who is superior even to Lakshmi, alone existed even before the creation of this Universe, keeping within His stomach all the sentient beings with their consciousness suppressed and resting on the shoulders of Sri Lakshmi, though capable of deriving pleasure through Himself.*\n\nThis verse explains the meaning of "Atmava Idameka Evagra aasith nanyatkinchinamishath" which describes the state of Brahman just before creation. The knowledge of creation as well as destruction of the Universe is necessary in order to have a correct idea of the hierarchy of divine beings. Unless this gradation is well understood the supremacy of Narayana cannot clearly be grasped.\n\n`Such clues to this gradation system is littered among the shrutis. One such is found in Aitareya Brahmana 1.1.1: ‘agnirvai devanamavamo vishnuh paramah tadantara sarva devatah’ “Agni is the lowest and Vishnu is the highest among devas. All other gods occupy positions that are in between.”`\n\n‘Keeping within His stomach all the sentient beings with their consciousness suppressed’ refers to Narayana having all knowledge within him, because there was none yet who could receive it. (Sri Vadiraja)\n\n`‘Though capable of deriving pleasure through Himself’ means that Sri Narayana did not create the universe out of a sense of boredom or other reasons. None but Sri Narayana Himself know the true reason for existence. All we can do is try to understand.`\n\n&gt;तस्योदरस्थजगतः सदमन्दसान्द्रस्वानन्दतुष्टवपुषोऽपि रमारमस्य ।  \nभूत्यै निजाण्स्रितजनस्य हि सृज्यसृष्टावीक्षा बभूव परनामनिमेषकान्ते । १.३ ।\n\n*3. At the end of a Brahma\'s lifetime which covers one hundred years of Brahma called Para, which is after all like a little wink for Maha Vishnu, a desire to bring into physical being the Souls fit to be so created for their own benefit because of their dependence on Him, came to Him who, though Himself possessed of a body consisting of unmixed and condensed innate bliss seeks the company of Maha Lakshmi only to delight Her, He who had kept the entire world in his own stomach.*\n\n`One single day of Brahma’s life is a 1000 Divya Yuga cycles. One Divya Yuga refers to the total time of Satya, Treta, Dvapara and Kali Yuga, which together is 4.32 million human years.`\n\n`So, one day of Brahma’s life is 4.32 billion human years. This is also known as a Kalpa. One night of Brahma’s life is also the same 4.32 billion human years, which we call as Pralaya. During every Pralaya, the lower ten lokas are destroyed. Only Satya-loka, Tapa-loka, Jana-loka and Mahar-loka are preserved.`\n\n`Brahma lives for a total of 100 of his years. That is, 100 x 360(a year in Brahma-loka is 360 days and nights) x (4.32 billion human years(day) + 4.32 billion human years(night)), which is 311.04 trillion human years. This period is called the Maha Kalpa. This amount of time passes by in the blink of an eye from Maha Vishnu’s perspective. After the Maha Kalpa, there is also a Maha Pralaya, where every single loka is destroyed(whole universe) and in this time, only Narayana exists.`\n\n`Narayana created life itself out of a desire to see them benefit from Him. Ultimately, attaining moksha is not only the goal of humans, but it is what Sri Narayana wants to see.`\n\n&gt;दृष्ट्वा स चेतनगणान् जठरे शयानानानन्दमात्रवपुषः सृतिविप्रमुक्तान् ।  \nध्यानं गतान् सृतिगतां श्च सुषुप्तिसं स्थान् ब्रह्मादिकान् कलिपरान्मनुजां स्तथैक्षत् । १.४ ।  \nस्रक्ष्ये हि चेतनगणान् सुखदुःखमध्यसम्प्राप्तये तनुभृतां विहृतिं ममेच्छन् ।  \nसोऽयं विहार इह मे तनुभृत्स्वभावसम्भूतये भवति भूतिकृदेव भूत्याः । १.५ ।\n\n*4-5. Having seen the groups of sentient beings resting in his stomach, who after release had only bodies of bliss and were bent upon contemplation of Him and also of those divine beings like Rujus, Shiva, Shesha etc., and of Kali and his-followers, and of men, who all lay motionless in slumber and were fit for creation, He thus contemplated “Desirous of amusement for myself, I shall create these groups of sentient beings by giving them physical frames for attainment of bliss, misery, and mixture of both (in their appropriate abodes). Thus this creation which affords scope for my incarnation also becomes my natural play. It also ensures for the development of the natural characteristics of these embodied beings and also for the divine welfare of Prakriti (by enabling her to assume multiple forms).”*\n\nNote – After Pralaya and before creation, the Souls who’s Linga Sharira have been separated as well as those clothed with Linga Sharira remain in the stomach of the supreme Vishnu. Of those whose Linga Sharira have been separated, some fit for heavenly abodes have bodies of bliss, while others destined for eternal hell have bodies consisting only of misery. There may be some released souls also still endowed with Linga Sharira.\n\nVasudeva keeps the released souls devoid of Linga Sharira while those with Linga Sharira retrain in the stomach of Sankarshana. The souls fit for release are handed over to Anirudha while those destined for perpetual samsara are handed over to Pradyumna.\n\n(Narada Purana.) Of the unreleased souls clothed with Linga Sharira, there are 3 classes:\n\n(1) which are fit for complete release and enjoy bliss there-after  \n(2) which are ordained for eternal hell and suffer eternal miseries there  \n(3) and those who have experience of both. Usually the first class of beings have their abode in the higher regions, while the second are consigned to eternal hell and the third class suffers from a cycle of births and deaths on the earth. Sri Lakshmi, Mukta Brahma and Vayu have no ignorance. Slumber in their case means only dependence upon Vishnu for the manifestation of their activity.\n\n`Important Note: Shiva, Brahma and Indra are not a part of the hierarchy of divine beings. That is because they are shuddhasrishti(pure creations) of Maha Vishnu.`\n\n`This is what the Narayana Sukta says:`\n\n`तस्याः᳚ शिखा॒या म॑ध्ये प॒रमा᳚त्मा व्य॒वस्थि॑तः ।`  \n`स ब्रह्म॒ स शिवः॒ स हरिः॒ सेन्द्रः॒ सोऽक्ष॑रः पर॒मः स्व॒राट् ॥`\n\n`In the middle of that flame, the supreme self dwells. This (self) is Brahma (the creator), Shiva (the destroyer), Hari (the protector), Indra (the ruler), the imperishable, the absolute, the autonomous being.`\n\n&gt;इत्थं विचिन्त्य परमः स तु वासुदेवनामा बभूव निजमुक्तिपदप्रदाता ।  \nतस्याज्ञयैव नियताऽथ रमाऽपि रूपं बभ्रे द्वितीयमपि यत्प्रवदन्ति मायाम् । १.६ ।  \nसङ्कर्षणण्स्च स बभूव पुनः सुनित्यः सं हारकारणवपुस्तदनुज्ञयैव ।  \nदेवी जयेत्यनु बभूव स सृष्टिहेतोः प्रद्युम्नतामुपगतः कृतितां च देवी । १.७ ।\n\n*6-7. Thus contemplating that omniscient Lord Narayana assumed the name of Vasudeva for the purpose of conferring the status of eternal release like himself (on souls.) Sri Lakshmi also prompted only by His command assumed her second form which is also called Maya. Again the same perfectly eternal Lord became Sankarshana whose body is the cause of destruction. Under His command only the same Goddess (Lakshmi) followed under the name of Jaya. For the sake of creation, He assumed the form of Pradyumna and the Goddess also took the form of Krithi.*\n\nNote: Creation is of four kinds: (1) shuddhasrishti -is pure creation by which without any change of form or character, the Lord Himself assumes various forms for the benefit of the world (2) paradeenavishopavapti srishti - where eternal form like Lakshmi comes under the control of Hari (3) mishrasrishti- where eternal spiritual forms like those of souls become embodied with physical forms (4) kevalasrishti - creation of what was non-existent before, like the physical universe etc. These two slokas deal with first two kinds of creation. The following slokas relate to the other two.\n\n`Important Note – One might wonder what is Lord Shiva’s role in all this if Maha Vishnu has already created Sankarshana(Shesha) as the cause of destruction.`\n\n`Bhagavata Purana 5.17.16 &amp; 5.25.3 clarifies this:`\n\n`भवानीनाथै: स्त्रीगणार्बुदसहस्रैरवरुध्यमानो भगवतश्चतुर्मूर्तेर्महापुरुषस्य तुरीयां तामसीं मूर्तिं प्रकृतिमात्मन:`  \n`सङ्कर्षणसंज्ञामात्मसमाधिरूपेण सन्निधाप्यैतदभिगृणन् भव उप-धावति ॥ १६ ॥`\n\n`In Ilāvṛta-varṣa, Lord Śiva is always encircled by ten billion maidservants of Goddess Durgā, who minister to him. The quadruple expansion of the Supreme Lord is composed of Vāsudeva, Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Saṅkarṣaṇa. Saṅkarṣaṇa, the fourth expansion, is certainly transcendental, but because His activities of destruction in the material world are in the mode of ignorance, He is known as tāmasī, the Lord’s form in the mode of ignorance. Lord Śiva knows that Saṅkarṣaṇa is the original cause of his own existence, and thus he always meditates upon Him in trance by chanting the following mantra.`\n\n`यस्य ह वा इदं कालेनोपसञ्जिहीर्षतोऽमर्षविरचितरुचिरभ्रमद्भ्रुवोरन्तरेण साङ्कर्षणो नाम रुद्र एकादशव्यूहस्\u200dत्र्यक्षस्त्रिशिखं`  \n`शूलमुत्तम्भयन्नुदतिष्ठत् ॥ ३ ॥`\n\n`At the time of devastation, when Lord Anantadeva desires to destroy the entire creation, He becomes slightly angry. Then from between His two eyebrows appears three-eyed Rudra, carrying a trident. This Rudra, who is known as Sāṅkarṣaṇa, is the embodiment of the eleven Rudras, or incarnations of Lord Śiva. He appears in order to devastate the entire creation.`\n\n`Shiva originates from Sankarshana. He is a shuddhasrishti creation. Sankarshana is whom Lord Shiva meditates upon so deeply. The snakes upon Lord Shiva represent Sankarshana.`\n\n&gt;स्थित्यै पुनः स भगवाननिरुद्धनामा देवी चशान्तिरभवच्छरदां सहस्रम् ।  \nस्थित्वा स्वमूर्तिभिरमूभिरचिन्त्यशक्तिः प्रद्युम्नरूपक इमां श्चरमात्मनेऽदात् । १.८ ।\n\n*8. Again for the sake of sustenance, the same Lord assumed the form of Anirudha and the Devi became Shanthi. Having remained quiet with these forms of His own for one thousand years(Human),this Lord of unthinkable prowess in the form of Pradyumna handed over these souls (kept in his stomach) to his last form Anirudha.*\n\n&gt;निर्देहकान् स भगवाननिरुद्धनामा जीवान् स्वकर्मसहितानुदरे निवेश्य ।  \nचक्रेऽथ देहसहितान् क्रमशः स्वयम्भुप्राणात्मशेषगरुडेण्समुखान् समग्रान् । १.९ ।\n\n*9. This Almighty Lord named Anirudha, having kept in his stomach these souls united to their own beginingless karma (in their Linga Sarira), but without physical bodies (Sookshma Sarira), then gradually made them all endowed with physical bodies beginning with the self born (Brahma), Prana, Sesha, Garuda, Siva and others.*\n\nNote – The apparent contradictions between the statements in these two verses 8 and 9 as to Anirudha playing both the creator and the sustainer is explained by saying that the reference to sustenance in the previous verse relates to sthulashrishti(the physical creation of the body and all its sensual feelings)- and the creation referred to in the latter relates to sukshmasrishti(the mental creation that consists of feelings of the heart and thoughts of the mind) (Sri Vadiraja.)\n\n&gt;पञ्चात्मकः स भगवान् द्विषडात्मकोऽभूत्पञ्चद्वयी शतसहस्रपरोऽमितश्च ।  \nइ.एकः समोऽप्यखिलदोषसमुज्झितोऽपि सर्वत्र पूर्णगुणकोऽपि बहूपमोऽभूत् । १.१० ।\n\n*10. This Almighty Lord assumed five forms, (viz: Narayana, Vasudeva, Sankarshana, Pradyumna, Anirudha), twelve forms (beginning with Kesava, etc.), and again twelve forms (beginning with Sankarshana etc,), ten forms (viz: Matsya, Kurma etc-), one hundred forms (beginning with Narayana etc) one thousand forms (beginning with Visvam etc.), forms of Para (para) (of 18 digits) and infinite forms. Through identical, equal, and free from every blemish, and full of complete attributes in all these forms, He appeared to be many.*\n\nNote – These entire multiple forms of the Lord become manifest at the time of creation itself and not separately at intervals. These, though indistinguishable from each other are known as separate by us.\n\nThis peculiar characteristic feature of the Lord known as Vishesha Shakti and are not separate like those of jivas which are intrinsically separate. These multiple forms of the Lord become merged at the time of Pralaya. Though they have all become manifest at the time of creation, they are understood as the first, second etc., form not according to the measure of time but according to the sequence in which they manifested themselves to Brahma.\n\n&gt;निर्दोषपूर्णगुणविग्रह आत्मतन्त्रो निश्चेतनात्मकशरीरगुणैश्च हीनः ।  \nआनन्दमात्रकरपादमुखोदरादिः सर्वत्र च स्वगतभेदविवर्जितात्मा । १.११ ।\n\n*11. His form is full of flawless good qualities and devoid of the defects attendant upon physical bodies and their three gunas. His form composed of hands, feet, face, stomach etc., consists of only bliss, (and knowledge etc.) ; in all His forms He is devoid of any differentiating feature; and He is independent.*\n\n`Here, independence means that unlike the universe and its inhabitants(both devas and mortals) which require sustenance from Narayana to exist, He exists without restriction.`\n\n&gt;कालाच्च देशगुणतोऽस्य न चाऽदिरन्तो वृद्धिक्षयौ न तु परस्य सदातनस्य ।  \nनैतादृशः क्व च बभूव न चैव भाव्यो नास्त्युत्तरः किमु परात्परमस्य विष्णोः । १.१२ ।\n\n*12. For this eternal Supreme Being, there is neither beginning nor end, in relation to time, space, or attribute; and there can be neither growth nor decay; one like Him never existed before anywhere nor is likely to come into being hereafter (and does not exist now). (When there is no equal), can there be any superior to Vishnu who is greater than even Lakshmi?*\n\n`Narayana was not born. He always was. He existed before the concept of time, space or any other physical attribute. There is no such thing as growth or decay for Narayana. And there is nothing and nobody like Him that has ever existed, nor will there ever be one that ever exists later.`\n\n`This verse also implies that after Narayana, Sri Lakshmi is next in the hierarchy of the divine beings.`\n\n&gt;सर्वज्ञ ईश्वरतमः स च सर्वशक्तिः पूर्णाव्ययात्मबलचित्सुखवीर्यसारः ।  \nयस्याऽज्ञया रहितमिन्दिरया समेतं ब्रह्मेशपूर्वकमिदं न तु कस्य चेशम् । १.१३ ।\n\n*13. He is all knowing, all powerful, and He is the very essence of innate complete and undiminishing strength, knowledge, bliss, and prowess, and the supreme Lord of all without whose command, this entire universe headed even by Lakshmi, Brahma and Rudra and others is not able to do anything.*\n\n`Again, this is referring to the dependence on Narayana. Without Anirudha to sustain the universe, even Rudra, whose power is almost as much as Narayana Himself, cannot act. This is because even though Lakshmi, Brahma and Shiva all have similar powers to Narayana, they are shuddhasrishti creations and thus dependent on Vishnu.`\n\n&gt;आभासकोऽस्य पवनः पवनस्य रुद्रः शेषात्मको गरुड एव च शक्रकामौ ।  \nवीन्द्रेशयोस्तदपरे त्वनयोश्च तेषामृष्यादयः क्रमश ऊनगुणाः शतां शाः । १.१४ ।\n\n*14. The chief Vayu is His image(i.e., similar to him in some respects and also dependent): of the chief Vayu, Sesha, as also Garuda and Rudra, (who will attain Sesha padavi later on,) is an image; lndra and Kama are the images of Garuda and Rudra. After these the rest viz., Ahankarikaprana, Anirudha, Moon, Sun etc. are the images of these two (Indra and Kama). Rishis and others deficient in qualities by one hundred parts each in gradation are the images of the foregoing respectively.*\n\n`This verse is describing the likeness of the Devas to the higher divine beings. Vayu is like Narayana. Indra is like Garuda. Kama is like Rudra. And all the other Devas are the images of Indra and Kama. As you go downwards in this hierarchy, the lower beings are images of the higher beings. This is because Narayana has given a ‘free reign’ to the divine beings to create lesser beings.`\n\n`Note – Although Vayu is said to be the likeness of Narayana, he is not the King of the Devas. That position belongs to Indra, as he is the ‘Ruler’ aspect of Narayana, who created him in the image of Garuda.`\n\n&gt;आभासका त्वथ रमाऽस्य मरुत्स्वरूपाच्छ्रेष्ठाऽप्यजात्तदनु गीः शिवतो वरिष्ठा ।  \nतस्या उमा विपतिनी च गिरस्तयोऽस्तु शच्यादिकाः क्रमश एव यथा पुमां सः । १.१५ ।\n\n*15. After Vishnu, the auspicious Lakshmi is indeed His image and is superior to the chief Vayu and also Brahma. After her comes Saraswati or Bharati who is superior to Rudra; Uma and Souparni are the images of Saraswati; Sachi and others in gradation are the images of these two, just as their husbands.*\n\nNote – Paramatma has both male and female forms. In his female form He becomes the image of Lakshmi. There is no rule however that like their husbands; these wives also are superior to the next male. `This is why even though Rudra might be lower on the hierarchy system, in practice He is actually much higher.`\n\n`The hierarchy system goes thusly: Vishnu &gt; Lakshmi &gt; Brahma, Vayu &gt; Saraswati, Bharati &gt; Garuda, Shesha, Rudra(but Shesha is Sankarshana and Rudra is the effect of Sankarshana) &gt; Wives of Krishna(Jambavati, Bhadra, Kalindi, Mitravinda, Lakshana, Neela) &gt; Sauparni(Garuda’s consort), Vaaruni(Shesha’s consort), Paarvati(Rudra/Shiva’s consort) &gt; Indra(Purandara), Kama, Skanda &gt; Ahankaarika Praana &gt; Svayambhu Manu, Daksha Prajapati, Bruhaspatyacharya, Shachi(consort of Indra(Purandara)), Rati(consort of Kama), Anirudha(son of Kama) &gt; Pravaha Vayu &gt; Vivasvaan Surya, Chandra, Yama, Shataroopa(consort of Svayambhu Manu) &gt; Varuna &gt; Devarshi Narada &gt; Bhrugu, Agni, Prasooti &gt; etc.`\n\n`This is the hierarchy up to Agni. There is much still below Agni.`\n\n&gt;ताभ्यश्च ते शतगुणैर्दशतो वरिष्ठाः पञ्चोत्तरैरपि यथाक्रमतः श्रुतिस्थाः ।  \nशब्दो बहुत्ववचनः शतमित्यतश्च श्रुत्यन्तरेषु बहुधोक्तिविरुद्धता न। १.१६ ।\n\n*16.They (the husbands) are superior to their wives by hundred, ten, and fifteen parts as in the Srutis by gradation, Here the term “hundred” must be under-stood to mean multitude and therefore there is no contradiction in the Srutis by narration of different grades.*\n\n&gt;तेषां स्वरूपमिदमेव यतोऽथ मुक्ता अप्येवमेव सततोच्चविनीचरूपाः ।  \nशब्दः शतं दशसहस्रमिति स्म यस्मात्तस्मान्न हीनवचनोऽथ ततोऽग्र्यरूपाः । १.१७ ।\n\n*17. Inasmuch as such superior and inferior forms are always thus natural to them, they remain so even after release. Though the terms ten, hundred, and thousand are indiscriminately used, they do not indicate inferiority, but only superiority.*\n\nNote - Every soul has two apathies one of which is innate and inseparable and the other separable. It the latter which is separated during release, while the innate differences. Always remain. After release gradation is determined according to innate differences .Sometimes these souls get greater qualities than their innate ones by the embodiment of other souls in them. Differences in the enumeration of qualities sometimes arise on account of such extraneous conditions (Sri Vadiraja).\n\n`This hierarchy of the divine beings is not always set in stone. The only constant is that Narayana’s position is unchallenged.`\n\n&gt;एवं नरोत्तमपरास्तु विमुक्तियोग्या अन्ये च सं सृतिपरा असुरास्तमोगाः ।  \nएवं सदैव नियमः क्वचिदन्यथा नयावन्न पूर्तिरुत सं सृतिगाः समस्ताः । १.१८ ।\n\n*18. Thus (though some have attained release) there are indeed other souls, headed by Vayu, fit for release, its eternal creation; and also Asuras fit for eternal hell. Thus this unchanging rule always prevails and it never varies at any time. Indeed so long as Sadhana (spiritual evolution) is not complete, all souls are liable to creation.*\n\n`Here, creation does not refer to the same creation that is done at the start of a Pralaya or Maha Pralaya, but it refers to the start of a new cycle in Samsara.`\n\n&gt;पूर्तिश्च नैव नियमाद्भविता हि यस्मात्तस्मात्समाप्तिमपि यान्ति न जीवसऽ न्घाः ।  \nआनन्त्यमेव गणण्सोऽस्ति यतो हि तेषामित्थं ततः सकलकालगता प्रवृत्तिः । १.१९ ।\n\n*19. And inasmuch by divine law, the spiritual evolution of all never becomes complete, therefore the groups of souls also never come to an end. Inasmuch as the groups of such souls are endless, therefore thus is the eternal process of creation pervading all time.*\n\n&gt;एतैः सुरादिभिरतिप्रतिभादियुक्तैर्युक्तैः सहैव सततं प्रविचिन्तयद्भिः ।  \nपूर्तेरचिन्त्यमहिमः परमः परात्मा नारायणोऽस्य गुणविस्तृतिरन्यगा क्व । १.२० ।\n\n20. The highest, the wisest, and the supreme Lord Narayana is such that His greatness cannot be comprehended in full, even by all these Devas together contemplating for ever with their intellect sharpened by the study of all the scriptures. How can such qualities extend to others?\n\n.\n\nThank you for reading, and I hope this piqued some of your interests.

But again, coming from 3 to 70+ in a (B)uslim dominated state is quite encouraging at the end.\n\nBut the present stance of our PM-Mota bhai duo against some liberandus, jihadis, anti-nationals, rice-bag conversions, love-jihaads, abusing of hindu temples and gods, and the protection of their own karyakartas is a bit disappointing. \n\nIts now or never. Justice delayed is justice denied.\n\nYes, yes, there are plenty positive things happened but equally bad things or on high rise and govt ain't doing shit.

It\'s his "own" creation.**\n\nThere are only a few truly Ayurveda experts left today. One of them is **Nityanandam Shree** on YouTube. He knows TRUE ayurveda.\n\nIn one of his recent videos he cured a corona positive old lady whose oxygen level was 84 within a matter of days.\n\n**It is 100% possible to not only cure but cure severe covid cases MUCH faster and safely** without any side effects (like black fungus is seen in people who used steroids) using Ayurvedic medicines.\n\nThere are some **INCREDIBLE and Strong** medicines in Ayurveda that are used in **emergency**.\n\nThese medicines are called as **\'ras\'** and are generally in tablet form. E.g. Laxmi Vilas Ras, Grahani Shardool Ras, Nav Jivan Ras, etc.\n\nThese medicines which have the word \'ras\' in them have some really strong ingredients like **purified mercury, purified Sulphur, abhrakh bhasma (mica), purified shilajit**, etc.\n\nYou may think "but mercury is dangerous, right?" Yes.\n\nBut **\'purified mercury\' acts FOR you** and not against you when taken in right fomurla/combination and quantities. These medicines are completely safe and have little to no side effects.\n\n**These medicines are so damn powerful that they literally even cure 2 decades old chronic ailments within few months** which the modern medicine can never do.\n\nRamdv baba doesn\'t make these medicines like \'ras\' because, first of they are hard to make, take a lot of time and effort and the profit margins are thin.\n\nRamdv baba is pure businessman. Most of Patanjali\'s products are highly deceptive. For e.g. they claim to have zero Maida in biscuits but the very first ingredient is "refined wheat flour".\n\n**DO NOT EVER underestimate Ayurveda** just because of idiots like Ramdv baba and his stupid medicines like coronil.

<li>Title: 'Losing all my Hopes. Either READ till the END or IGNORE.'<br />Body: 'To be honest, I don\'t have any hope left for Hinduism. Seems like this century will be our end. Of course I am not talking about complete eradication, definitely there would be some Hindus practising their Dharma but as a world religion which we were for thousands of years, we would surely be reduced to a small minority in future.\n\nEven at present, I hardly see any Hindu men and women teaching Dharma, Adhyatma and about Islamic invasions, genocide of Hindus to their children. Half of these children would grow up to be Hindu hating Pro Islamists and leftists. Another half would probably convert to Christianity and Islam even though their own Hindu parents are deemed for eternal hell according to these bigoted cults.\n\n**You are a fool if you think there are 100 crore Hindus. Just having a hindu name doesn\'t make you a Hindu. I can show you hundreds of "Sitaram" who are hardcore communists. Hundreds of "Ramkrishna" who denigrate Hinduism in every way possible and sympathise with those same Muslims who plundered our land, looted our wealth, desecrated temples and try to demean, mock,threaten, murder, dehumanise practising Hindus in every way possible.**\n\nTo all those who say there are good Muslims too, those good Muslims ain\'t going to save you and your family when the radical jihadis will attack. They won\'t raise their voice . They would be spectators secretly wishing every single kafir to either die or convert. Where were the good Muslims when Kashmiri Hindus were driven out? Don\'t get me wrong. I too have muslim friends but I very well know they will never raise their voice against radical Muslims while hurling every possible abuse to Hinduism. They won\'t, my viraat brothers and sisters. They won\'t.\n\nDespite knowing their intentions clearly, if Hindus still don\'t unite and save their Dharma, then it would be the final end of us. I am from West Bengal. After elections, there was a huge violence against Hindus who voted for BJP. Men, women, children, even animals, mercilessly stoned, raped, stabbed to death. And do you know what was the reaction of my leftist "Hindu" friends and teachers????\n\n&gt;*"Haha, they deserve it. Idiot Bhakts"*\n\nI am not exaggerating. How can we so blind is beyond my understanding. Even liberal Christians in Western countries are not that cucked. A single "*Samuel Paty Incident*" was enough to trigger a retaliation even among the most liberal French citizens.\n\nPolice, media, government, Judiciary, schools, universities, filled with such kind of scum. I am really tired, yaar. The most violent are being called the most peaceful. How? How is this possible? Is this the maya of Kaliyuga our scriptures warned about? I am completely lost. The world doesn\'t make any sense.\n\nWe Will Keep Posting and Posting and they would keep doing their real stuff on Ground Zero.\n\nThe only thing we could do is "Abhi Tandav hoga", "Jago Hindu Jago".'<br />Author: 'vacationinParadis'<br />id: 'nhtj7g'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Women need not be soldiers .'<br />Body: " \n\nI present my arguement based on the  authority of Lord Shiva , Sage Vashishtha , Lord Parshuram , Sage Ved  Vyas and Agni Puran . Why so because it is knowledge from Lord Shiva  consolidated and spread by other's which forms Dhanurveda .\n\nIt  is in the ethics of war that any fleeing enemy ,an unarmed ,an  unconscious ,a surrendered enemy and children and women are not to be  fought with nor to be struck down . The only basis in which this can be  countered is with the tale of Mata Kali being the only one to kill  Raktbija and showing that women are also allowed to wage war .\n\nHowever from two cases we can infer that it is not true .\n\nFirst  is the Tripurasur war when Lord Shiva uses the penultimate essence of  half the deites as an arrow , Lord Vishnu and the other half of deities  as a chariot and Lord Brahma as a bow . The reason why the tripurasurs  could not be destroyed was that they had a boon which caused them to  have three floating cities which would align only once in a thousand  years and had to be destroyed all at once . So before they aligned in  front of all heavenly beings Lord Shiva destroyed and reconstructed them  within a span of  a second proving that although boons have power he is  still supreme however to uphold the sanctity of Lord Brahma's word he  destroyed them once and for all when they aligned .\n\nFor  this Shivas word is supreme (the same which in Dhanurveda forbods women  from going to war ) and he also could have taken care of Raktbija .\n\nThe  other is when Andhaka Asur attacks Goddess Parvati she and all the  other goddess take avatar and battle him but are not able to defeat his  army . However when Lord Shiva strikes he within a single blow defeats  Andhaka Asur who is also his son . In that single strike Andhaka gains  wisdom and decides to stay as a Gana"<br />Author: 'Sage_of_Saffron'<br />id: 'nho0t3'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>

The campaign was "support democracy in china".**\n\nBut of course he couldn\'t do sh!t as it is china.\n\n**2) In one of his interviews with rNDTV during the congress regime, he said "India is doing great" (irony)**\n\n**3) In one of Strings video, Vinod talks about "gene sharp theory". The guy gene sharp wrote a book named \'from dictatorship to DEMOCRACY\'.**\n\nNow what does that tell you?\n\n**These people are "socialists" (anarchists too whatsoever).**\n\nThey **WANT** democracy. ***But they are fking blind***. They think hindus in India are oppressing the minorities. They don\'t know Sh\\*t about this country, it\'s culture, history, nothing.\n\nThey REALLY believe modi is dictator!\n\nThey get this stupid idea from the fake news factory **which is none other than west.**\n\n**That\'s right!**\n\n**IT\'S USA, UK, CANADA, etc. who WANT instability in India.**\n\nThese **"developed"** countries spread fake news about Hindus and India over and over and over again and idiots like s0ros believe it. Then these idiots send large amounts of money to India to ***"fight nationalism"*** without even knowing facts or history. They don\'t know it\'s actually the Hindus who are in danger.\n\nAnd by the way, s0ros is just one of the names. I\'m sure there are MANY such people, you just don\'t hear about them.\n\n**What is the solution?**\n\nQuite Simple. Only 2 Steps:\n\n**1) History** \\- The ultimate red pill is the history. Even in mahabharata somewhere Krishna says "the knowledge of history will wipe out ignorance". We need to HEAVILY invest to tell the world about the REAL Bharatiya Itihas. Praveen Mohan is doing a great job in this.\n\nWe need to make documentaries talking about atrocities by Mughals, Britishers in India. How pakistan, afghanistan, bangladesh, kashmir, etc were once Hindu but "something happened" and now they are not.\n\n**2) Economy -** Get out of the "job" mentality. Start swadeshi businesses. Solve local problems. Create swadeshi products, apps, software, etc. Make use of the immense workforce we have. This will give us the money to tackle the international fake narratives and to create our own.\n\nThese two things will avoid the creation of future s0ros and will ensure safety and stability.'<br />Author: 'johnkarter767612'<br />id: 'nhjvg8'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Fallacies of "Hindu Atheists"'<br />Body: 'A. The misconception of Charvaka\n\nI have seen a trend of "so-called-atheists" larping under the banner of Charvakas/Lokayatas. It shows a clear misunderstanding of what Charvaka philosophy actually stood for, and rest is just contradictory projection of wishfulness. People who call themselves Charvaka, but do not reject Sanatan Dharma do not understand the contradictory nature of their talks.\n\nCharvakas are regarded as the most radical of the Indian philosophical systems.\xa0 **It rejects the existence of other worldly entities such an immaterial soul or god and the after-life**.\xa0 Its primary philosophical import comes by way of a scientific and naturalistic approach to metaphysics.\xa0 Thus, it **rejects ethical systems that are grounded in supernaturalistic cosmologies, and consequently the vedas.**\n\nB.  Nastik\n\nIn *Nyāyasūtra (* 1.1.2 )*, i*n course of explaining what is meant by false knowledge *(mithyājñāna),* Vātsyāyana enumerates how evils produced under the influence of attraction and repulsion lead to moral lapses: “Driven by the evils and through the agency of the body one commits violence, theft and incest. Through words (one is led to) plotting against others, covetousness and *nāstikya.*”. Vātsyāyana adds that motivations like these are sinful, resulting in *adharma,* lack of merit. \n\nAcross scriptures, *nāstika* have been associated with irreligiosity.\n\nThe Manusmriti very succinctly explains *nāstika* as ‘a defiler of the Veda’, ***nāstiko vedanindakaḥ*** (2.11).      \n Defiling the Veda is one of the worst sins in the eye of Brahminical orthodoxy. By including *nāstikya* in the enumeration of vices, Vātsyāyana records his unflinching devotion to the Veda as well as his own orthodoxy. \n\nIt is, however, well known that the term, *nāstika,* is also employed by the Buddhists and Jains to designate those who, instead of denying the validity of the Veda, used to deny the existence of the other-world or after-life (*paraloka*) and hence the concept of virtue and vice. \n\nSince the Buddhists and Jains had nothing to do with the Veda and hence had no concern in upholding it as a sacred text, they had to put forward their own meaning of *nāstikya* in order to brand the common enemy of all religions, namely, the materialists  ( Charvaka and co. )\n\nIn whichever sense we take *nāstikya*, there is no room for doubt regarding the moral disapproval that goes with the word.    \n\nThe Buddhists and the Jains also call the materialist *nāstika* or *ṇāhiyavādī,* because he does not believe in rebirth and the notion that the meritorious and sinful acts of previous birth would influence the course of future life. Denial of rebirth and hence of after-life *(paraloka)* is another characteristic position of the Indian materialists.\n\nFunnily enough, A Charvaka aphorism runs as follows: ***paralokino \'bhāvāt paralokābhāvaḥ****,* “There is no other world because of the absence of any other-worldly being” (i.e. the transmigrating self).'<br />Author: 'ViciousPhilosopher'<br />id: 'nhc156'<br />Flair ::oc-: OC है BC!💡</li>

Then I said that most of (if not all) noble peace prize winners are like her only.   \nSo she asked me what about Malala Yousafzai. Now I know she is not good too .

So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .\n\nThe app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend.\n\n[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.happyer4life](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.happyer4life) for android [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/happyer/id1537711110](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/happyer/id1537711110) for iOS.\n\nI have created a subreddit [https://www.reddit.com/r/Happyer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Happyer/) to help easily address issues/bugs &amp; to allow users to share their happy experiences :)\n\nAlso here is our website [https://happyer4life.com](https://happyer4life.com/) if you would like to provide feedback, donate(to handle maintenance costs) or just know more about the app!'<br />Author: 'Dragonair_fruit1371'<br />id: 'ngmv18'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
