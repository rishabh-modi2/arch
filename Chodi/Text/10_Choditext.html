IT cells way of doing things are getting older and tricks are over used. \n\nTo put it in simple perspective votes can be divided in 3 groups 25% Pro BJP voters, 25% against BJP and 50% that can swing any way. These 50 are getting out of our hand thanks to IT cells failure and Modi thinking he can fkup and no one will notice. IT Cell hasn't been able to counter the PM Cares fund used for mandir and many more issues. But on the other hand the left ecosystem is taking a completely new way of doing things each month or so a new news outlet with a clear intention of anti-BJP and anti-Hindu agenda is being made and the problem is that people cannot see their true face. Digital news is becoming a nuisance. These outlets are very properly spreading their propoganda without the person reading it notice this bc they want to be called intellectuals, we need to get rid of this intellectual wannabe fantasy of the youth. Whereas news outlets like op and swrajya are not considered valid by these 50% public bc these outlets are very open about their ideaology, they seem to be mouthpieces of hindutva. We need more centerist right leaning type outlets.\n\nSocial media influencers like Dhruv Tatti and right influencers like Sham Srhma. See if a alien had to sort their videos then he'd most likely put Dhruvs video in informational videos and shams video into a rant/funny videos category. That is bc the way dhruv does it. We lack such influencers. We need someone like Jordan Petersen, a lot of people have this potential of doing it.

Janet  has written that millions of Hindu families living in extreme poverty in Bengal are not given the benefit of any such scheme.\n\nJanet Levy has given many examples around the world where terrorism, religious fanaticism and crime cases started increasing as the Muslim population increased.\n\nWith increasing population, a separate Sharia law is demanded at such places and then finally it reaches the demand of a separate country.\nIn this article, Janet has blamed Islam for this problem.\nShe has written that this message has been given openly in the Quran that Islamic rule should be established throughout the world.\n\nTaslima Nasreen presented an example.\n\nJanet has written that Islam has spread everywhere by forcibly converting or killing non-Muslims.\nShe has written about the situation of Bengal in this article.\n \nReferring to the riots in Bengal, she wrote that in 2007 riots broke out against Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen in Kolkata.\n \nThis was the first attempt in which Muslim organizations in Bengal started demanding the Islamic blasphemy (Blasfamie) law.\n\nQuestions raised on India\'s secularism\n\nIn 1993, Taslima Nasreen wrote a book \'Lajja\' on the issue of atrocities on Hindus in Bangladesh and forcibly making them Muslims.\nAfter writing the book, she had to leave Bangladesh for fear of bigotry.\nShe settled in Kolkata thinking that she will be safe there because India is a secular country and there is also the freedom to keep ideas there.\n\nBut surprisingly, even in secular country India, Muslims saw Taslima Nasreen with hatred Fatwas issued to cut her throat in India.\nShe was also attacked several times in different cities of the country.\nBut the hungry Left and Trinamool governments of Vote bank never supported them because the Muslims would get angry and votebank would do so.\n\nThere is demand for \'Mughalistan\'country in Bengal.\n\nJanet Levy further wrote that for the first time in 2013 some fundamentalist Maulanas of Bengal started demanding a separate \'Mughalistan\'.\nIn the same year riots in Bengal, houses and shops of hundreds of Hindus were looted and many temples were also destroyed. \nIn these riots, the government ordered the police not to do anything against the rioters.\n\nAre Hindus boycotted?\nMamta was afraid that if the Muslims were stopped they would get angry and would not vote.\n\nIt has been said in the article that not only riots but to drive away Hindus, Muslims in districts where there are more Muslims, boycotting Hindu businessman\nIn the districts of Malda, Murshidabad and North Dinajpur, Muslims do not even buy goods from Hindu shops.\n\nThis is the reason why a large number of Hindus have started migrating from there.\nLike Kashmiri Pandits, here Hindus have to leave their homes and businesses and move to other places.\nThese are the districts where Hindus have become a minority.\n\nMamta sending terrorist supporters to Parliament.\n\nNext, Janet has written that Mamta has now even started sending terrorism supporters to Parliament.\n\nIn June 2014, Mamta Banerjee sent a notorious jihadist named Ahmed Hasan Imran as a Rajya Sabha MP on her party ticket.\n \nHasan Imran has been the co-founder of banned terrorist organization SIMI\n\nHasan Imran is accused of transferring the money of the Saradha chit fund scam to the Jamaat-e-Islami of Bangladesh to provoke riots in Bangladesh.\n \nNIA and CBI are also under investigation against Hasan Imran\n\nAccording to the report of the Local Intelligence Unit LIU, Hassan has been involved in many riots and giving shelter to terrorists.\nHe has been accused of having links with Pakistani intelligence agency ISI\n\nAccording to Janet, the demand for partition of Bengal from India will soon begin to arise.\n\nThrough this article Janet has warned those Western countries who are resettling Muslim refugees that soon they will have to face the Verysame things like Germany and England.'<br />Author: 'lostvice69'<br />id: 'n6bbfi'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihaad_Halal Certified</li>

<li>Title: 'Weirdest reason to vote for didi...'<br />Body: 'Most of the news about WB comes from my bengali friend. So he is someone well connected with the local tmc leaders but is a closet sanghi. He has 2 housemaids and he told both of them to vote for Modi. You might be seeing TMC beating up BJP workers everywhere. But TMC vs TMC is more common than that. The quality of their workers are so bad that they start fighting regarding the shittiest of things and make everyone else afraid. The only way to stay safe is to be friends to big tmc politicians. They will beat the crap out of the workers if something bad happens to their friends. This is the reason this friend is so connected. Some years before this election one gangster cum tmc worker beat up another big gangster cum worker and also killed an innocent guy. The leaders got angry about seeing one important guy killed and the gangster had to run away in another district to save himself. After that the place was pretty peaceful. \n\nBefore the elections the housemaids started acting weird. My friend told me not to vote for tmc. But they started arguing how mamata is fighting alone against so much poweful opponents like Modi. She started telling him about her struggles and got lowkey emotional. The other housemaid started dreaming how commies will come back to power after tuis election. Her only evidence of this was that she saw some stupid whatsapp video lol. In this election, both of them including their entire slum voted for tmc. After winning he heard them discussing how that gangster who terrorized them will come back. My friend found them acting even more weird how they were filled with amazement and enthusiasm as they were basically talking about how that gangster will terrorize them again. My friend showed them whatsapp images and videos of what these goons are doing. He also sarcastically told how the ones injured or dead look so much like them. How they even wear the same clothes as them and speak in the same way as them. Both got a little nervous, but the one who predicted a commie win predicted again how mamata will meet the same fate as Indira Gandhi. The other one told there is election fraud because its impossible that commies got zero seats. They knew only one family in the entire area who voted for commies. And they still think its voter fraud lol. They were asking my friend to call the leader and praise him so that they do not get beaten up during the celebrations. \n\nYou can see this is a clear case of Stockholm syndrome here. And also that many bongs are slowly becomimg hindutvas.\n\n\nMany other weird things have happened. There was a girl from another district who was very studious and meritorious student. She was about to give her class 10 exams. But suddenly fell in love with a 40 year old goon. Why? Because he looked charismatic. Her parents are happy. (She is of legal age btw). They got a smartphone, learnt how to use WhatsApp and shared an image with their daughter dressed as a bride. \n\nMany tmc leaders are famous and loved just because of this syndrome. After decades of suppression of freedom of speech and violence, this is what remains of this once glorious region. Poor people get beaten up so much that they think themselves to be entitled if they are not beaten up. They get some freebies sometime and think of the leaders to be gods. Its over for them. Listening to these stories, I have no idea why bjp even tried to enter here. \n\nBtw I just remembered another funny incident: One tmc goon fell in love with the sister of another goon and both started fighting because of it. This story made me  laugh so hard.'<br />Author: 'LucaMarko'<br />id: 'n650tf'<br />Flair :Laal Salaam :commiehand:</li>

<li>Title: "My grandfather's experience during the Great Calcutta Killings"<br />Body: 'Before we get into it, let\'s be clear that all of this is \'hearsay\' i.e. all of this has been recollected from stories my grandfather told me. He was always reluctant to talk about those days, I guess he may have been suffering from PTSD from those horrific events. It started on 16th August, when the Buslim League started marching across Calcutta with *Lathis* and raised the slogan " Lad ke lenge Pakistan".\n\nMy grandfather had just passed out of college at that time( he was an architect). Our family was never involved in politics and my family was very secular, our family still has many close (b)uslim friends and so did my grandfather at the time.  He didn\'t personally know Gopal Mukherjee at the time, but brought meat from his shop. The objective of the league was to divide India such that all land east of the Ganga would be Pakistan and they couldn\'t have achieved this without wiping out a huge chunk of the Hindu population of Bengal. Our family went into hiding on the 16th and stayed underground for a while, all electricity was cutoff and boys from the local clubs ventured out to gather food and supplies. Initially my grandpa didn\'t want to get involved but an incident changed that, one his buslim friends attacked him with a knife when he was out to get food and supplies, he was very strong and tall( must have been 6\' 2" ish in his prime) and had trained in wrestling and weight-lifting from a very young age( Swami Vivekananda had brought a resurgence of physical culture to Bengal so every youth underwent some physical training, my grandma still has bigger biceps than me!) he managed to wrestle him away and fled the scene. After that incident, he joined Gopal patha who was organising counter-attacks against the M league. We were a \'bonedi\' or zamindar family so naturally, we had a few double-barrel shotguns, hunting rifles, revolvers, swords and spears lying around the house, later he pooled his savings to buy guns from American soldiers in Calcutta. Gopal patha\'s motto was to kill 10 of them for each Hindu they killed. The league was indiscriminately killing Hindus mostly from the lower classes like rickshaw-pullers, migrant labourers, Sikh taxi-drivers, etc. My grandpa\'s math tutor from his childhood had been kidnapped and later they found him disemboweled and beheaded, keep in mind he was like 60 years old at that time. Many Marwari businessmen were kidnapped, their shops looted and then chopped up and thrown in the outskirts of our para to serve as a warning. At one time a gunda had managed to break into our home but my grandpa managed to kill him with a sword, later the women of my family( my grandpa had 8 sisters) had to flee from our home for the time-being as it was too big of a target and our house was stocked with armed guards and served as the base of operations for the Bharat Rakshya Bahini  for a while. At one time they even planned an assassination attempt of Sohravardy( my grandpa wasn\'t involved in this) which failed. My grandpa claimed that the league even had a plan to blow up the Howrah bridge. Most of the fighting took place after non-urban Hindu Bengalis came into the city and fought. Even Sikhs fought with them against the league. The BRB organised counter-attacks deep into enemy territory along with defending their homes. On one these counter-attack missions my grandpa saw 4 men raping a Hindu woman, the managed to chase the men away, but the lady ( teenager would be more appropriate) had been stabbed in her belly and later succumbed to her injuries. The sights he saw during those days haunted him till his death, Hindu shops burned while people were still inside them, children raped and impaled on spears, women raped and then their limbs cut off and left to bleed to death, many times when the league found a woman with her child, the smashed its head in with a brick, while making sure the mother watched and then later raped and killed the woman. The extreme amount of violence took a toll on him, he had multiple stab wounds from swords and knives and was shot badly in his leg, due to which he limmped badly until the day of his death. I\'ll write about his experiences with Gandhi and the aftermath as the army came in in the comments.'<br />Author: 'GadadhariVrikodara'<br />id: 'n5n1rf'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Why we need the right to bear arms in India (like the American second amendment)'<br />Body: 'Our days of over-dependence on the government are over. We\'ve let the government (be it centre or state) have too much power over us and we\'ve seen them get tyrannical. America created the second amendment as a defense against big governments that go tyrannical and we\'re seeing Kashmir 2.0 happen in West Bengal and all the Hindus can do there is cross into Assam or live under fear of the government for simply "voting wrong". Moreover, this country has failed in gun control because over 90% of the gun crime that happens in India is committed using unlicensed guns. This goes to point the fact that criminals will continue to get their guns even if there are strict gun laws. India also has a hugely understaffed police force that\'s spread out thinly. What\'s worse is that while this is the case, police go arrest people who made crazy videos where they cut their birthday cakes with a katana while we remain the country with the highest number of slaves. Absolutely no sense of priority. If we have a right to bear arms, we might be able to solve this problem of crime and I know what you might be thinking, "But won\'t gun crime increase?". Maybe, but what you fail to notice is that it will end quicker as well if people have guns with them. I\'d highly suggest if you watch Steven Crowder\'s rebuttal to vox on gun control.'<br />Author: 'santaniatheist'<br />id: 'n5kkie'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

Those of us objecting to Tejaswi's comments are NOT making this about Hindu-Muslim. Tejaswi made it about religion, we are CONDEMNING it. \n\n2. They were targeted and fired for being Muslims, not for the scam. There are 200+ employees there. What are the chances of ALL 17 Muslims being the ONLY ones involved in the scam, especially when 2 other non-muslims are already arrested for it?\n\n3. BBMP is under BJP. The Mayor is a BJP man. The MP and most of the MLAs are BJP disgraces. The CM is a BJP oldie. The PM is a BJP narcissist. Are you chu*ya enough to believe that 17 out 200+ random nobodies are responsible for the scam while all the BJP leaders are not? Are you really so stupid?\n\nThis country has a long way to go, but making sure Tejaswi loses in 2024 would be a mighty leap in the right direction."<br />Author: 'petrichor993'<br />id: 'n5k261'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

They won battles because of their number . They are cowards thats why they kill innocent people with guns and bombs . They depend on numbers thats why they breed like pigs . On the contrary Hindus on the battle field are lions   . Many hindu kings defeated mughals even though they were outnumbered. For example Ahoms defeated them 17 times . We hindus will always depend on a leader to lead us . We are like ye pehle tu ja . You can see my point in the movie tanhaji when tanhaji gave that fiery speech before attacking the fort . Another example would be Lachit Borphukan's speech to his soldiers that inspired them to take on the bigger army  . One more thing that the peacefools do is  they demoralize the enemy well . According to me whenever they loot,rape a town or village its to demotivate the enemy . No matter how powerful you are physically or mentally if you see your daughter/wife get raped and your temples get demolished you will get depressed and demotivated . You will be suicidal.  This not only demoralizes every one  . Thats why small nations surrendered to mughals without a fight. For example whenever you see peacefools burning a city do you feel demotivated and overpowered ?

<li>Title: 'Modiji : Suffering From Success'<br />Body: "A classic rule of grand strategy is that, a strong power, which keeps getting bigger and stronger, will make enemies automatically. It is a simple response of neighbouring powers to align and collaborate against this bigger power.  \nModiji is that big power. All opposition parties are the neighbours.  \nModiji's awesome victories from 2014-2019 created a sense of unassailability. His massive win in 2019 elections cemented it. All other parties tried to band together (Mahagathbandan was it called?) and failed.\n\nBut now, it's harming him. The Lok Sabha majority is great, but allies are greater. A great power like Modiji must maintain allies, to prevent too much opposition (happening now).\n\nA great power has two choices in dealing with upset neighbours - 1) Crush them, or 2) Be passive.  \n1 is out of question. India cannot have just 1 player.  \nWhich means he will have to adopt a more friendly (carrot-stick) approach to other parties. I would like to see Shiv Sena ditch Congress and re-align with NDA, Congress ditch Left and align with BJP (in Kerala), BJP to create a new Bengali party to overthrow TMC etc.\n\nNevertheless, Modiji is a seasoned politician.

The vedic culture of Kerala always fascinated me, the grand temples, the grand srauta yajnas, the temple festivals, the many spiritual leaders and the sumptuous Onam sadya mesmerised me to nourish my soul!\n\nI understand that the leftists have hijacked the narrative of  'so called' reform movements since early days of independence movement, thus their base is strong. All their ideologues have been from the europe and their attempts to superimpose a leftist model of society in Kerala.\n\nHonestly, how good have the leftist and other governments been in presenting and promoting the Temple culture of Kerala and promoting the indigenous ideologies and thought systems?\n\nWhat are the reasons for the pathetic loss of BJP in Kerala? Does BJP represent the will of big sangh parivar of Kerala? \n\nWhy are the current average Hindu youth so naive and ignorant about their faith, customs and culture? I understand that the so called beef culture among Hindus of Kerala crept in during the rise of Gulf Malayalees who were mostly Muslims and Christians and Communism, a combination of it, while beef eating was unthinkable for Hindus of Kerala in the past.\n\nInfact the very passage of rite for a Hindu in Kerala to be rubber-stamped 'secular' is with what intensity and joy they love 'beef-porotta' and how they hate to call themselves as Hindus in the 1st place!\n\nThe most important threat being from the Islamists who might anytime in future call for a separate Malabar state, the rapid unchecked love jihad which has destroyed many Hindu families.\n\nI request you to Kindly express your insights and opinion about this, about the possibility of revival of the unique Hinduism of Kerala, since BJP has failed in Kerala, can there be a possibility of a local state level HIndu party being formed to protect the interests of Malayalee Hindus?\n\nLets discuss.

We want the Swayam-Sevak within Modi, not the validation-seeking personality that the media has developed over the years.\n\nSo when something bad happens he goes into Gandhi mode. He doesn't tweet a single word on these events. Instead he goes into denial, and tweets about other things. \n\nPS: I'll still vote Modi. He's not perfect. He has other strengths like foreign diplomacy, taking our country towards entrepreneurship, and building infrastructure. **Libbu brigade stay away**"<br />Author: 'civ_gandhi'<br />id: 'n5g5rl'<br />Flair :Magga Balti Vichar :Shwr:</li>

Social Media has helped them see the NSFL reality of states with too many \'peacefuls\'. \n\nI hope Bengal burns down. The massacre of Hindus there might give a lesson to other states -"This is what happens when your peaceful population gets over 30". \n\n\nPeacefuls are just 6.6 percent of my state, and it should remain that way. Let them get over 8-9 % and they\'ll start crying oppression. Once they get around 14 percent (Delhi), there will be riots. \n\nGujrat is giga based with just 3.39 percent peacefuls, and look what answer they did when the peacefuls started shit.\n\nOnce they get to 30 percent (Bengal). They\'ll openly start killing, raping others. Once they get over 60 (Kashmir) they\'ll kill, rape on an unfathomable scale, and push out everyone else out of that area (Pundits). \n\nSo I guess if Bengal example helps even some sickulars wake up, then these deaths are for the greater good.\n\n I see so many angry comments urging for Modi to act.

<li>Title: 'My thoughts on how to protect ourselves'<br />Body: 'First of all this post will have some hard truths and some self defense techniques.  Teaching or talking about self defense is not equal to calling for violence \n\nMy analysis of hindu and muslims\n\n Muslims are absolute cowards . You can check history.  They won battles because of their number . They are cowards thats why they kill innocent people with guns and bombs . They depend on numbers thats why they breed like pigs . On the contrary Hindus on the battle field are lions   . Many hindu kings defeated mughals even though they were outnumbered. For example Ahoms defeated them 17 times . We hindus will always depend on a leader to lead us . We are like ye pehle tu ja . You can see my point in the movie tanhaji when tanhaji gave that fiery speech before attacking the fort . Another example would be Lachit Borphukans speech to his soldiers that inspired them to take on the bigger army  . One more thing that the peacefools do is  they demoralize the enemy well . According to me whenever they loot,rape a town or village its to demotivate the enemy . No matter how powerful you are physically or mentally if you see your daughter/wife get raped and your temples get demolished you will get depressed and demotivated . You will be suicidal.  This not only demoralizes every one  . Thats why small nations surrendered to mughals without a fight. For example whenever you see peacefools burning a city do you feel demotivated and overpowered ? Ask yourself. Anyone who can see through this can defeat them \n\nNow how to fight them ?\n\n1.I see a lot of people telling to learn martial arts . That wont work   . As i said earlier they depend on numbers  . Martial art wont help you with barbaric mobs  . They wont fight with rules . 20 guys will gather around and beat you to pulp . You won\'t even get time to react . I am a self taught martial artist and i once told my cousins to lynch me like a mindless mob . I have 7 cousins and they beat me brutally.  Learn to hunt . My dad taught me hunting, gathering etc when i was 14 . Keep in mind that we never killed any organisms . Hunting is more like tracking,finding your prey ,looking for residue etc . The only thing that can stop a mindless mob is brute force or guerrilla tactics \n\n2. Start making bows and practice archery . Our constitution gives us right to use force to defend ourselves, our property and our family . But make sure you dont use more force than required . If you cant use a bow use a slingshot  . A well built slingshot can knock some sense into people from a distance of 30 meters . I have been making and using them since i was 14 . I stopped archery btw . I could make some decent bows\n\n3. Train yourself mentally . Place yourself into the situations that you dont want to be . A lie told 1000 times becomes the truth.  Place yourself in a lie . Live it 1000 times . Start thinking realistically.  Try to get out of the situation.  Take notes . Try to think about every possibility when you take a decision.  Do it thousand times . This also has a cost.  This will strip away all your emotions  . If you ever face that issue you will be like "Ye to mere sath ho chuka hai" . Once you lived a situation that you dont want to be in a 1000 time chances are when the situation comes you will be mentally stable . \n\nNumber three is a bit of a risky move . It will have consequences'<br />Author: 'someone_you_may_kn0w'<br />id: 'n4w0yi'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Why bjp lost bengal'<br />Body: 'The election strategist from bjp is a moron. Bjp thought people love Modi so much so they can put anyone as candidates and everything will be fine. \n\nThey recruited many stupid leaders from tmc, which nobody loved. Even bjp workers protested but nobody listened. So most of them lost. Ofcourse Shuvendu won. But he was a good one. The rest were all morons. \nInfact there is a rumor that bjp was so confident of their win that they took bribes from the candidates to give them tickets. These corrupt ex-tmc leaders could give it. But many newbies had to sacrifice a lot just to sit. This makes me angry\n\nBjp placed extremely weak leaders (mostly celebs) against tmc veterans. And guess who won. \n\nBabul, Locket and other big bjp leaders tried to do something Smriti Irani had done in Amethi: Defeating big tmc leaders in their own turf. But Smriti did a lot fo homework and spent a lot of time there to win. These morons on the other hand suddenly appeared just before the elections and were not quite popular. And guess what, they lost. \n\nModi did excessive campaigning in WB. They were not used to it. They started thinking bjp leaders were very weak so Modi has to cover for them. The main reason bjp performed unprecedentedly in 2019 was because people could see the struggles of the leaders and the leaders spent a lot of time connecting with people in their areas. \n\nMany good leaders didn\'t even get any railles. I know someone very good who didn\'t get any support. He literally visited a few people in their homes and told them to vote for him. And guess what he lost. (He was so good that even libs who met him loved him). \n\nModi failed as a PM too. Poor bengalis were angry with rise of prices and the economy. They were afraid of privatization too, not because they were commies but they thought Modi will give away the little money they have. Almost all of my bengali friend\'s housemaids turned against Modi because of it. Modi should communicate about his schemes or post advertisements on tv to educate the citizens if the schemes are any good. \n\nBjp thought people chanting "jai shree ram" meant they are loyal to Modi. Ram is not that much famous in WB. You will see that only 2 people represented wb in babri masjid demolition. And both were not bengalis. Most of them were clueless about Babri Masjid. The people chanting them were literally trolling Mamata. BJP didn\'t have any idea how bengalis think. Many bjp leaders were non-bengalis and same goes with their workers. I have heard from my friend that non-bengalis treat bengalis like trash. Peaceful people are hated too. But the running gag is, they won\'t beat you up if you are loyal to tmc or ifnyou just don\'t disturb them. But i have seen some incidents where non-bengalis misbehaved with bengalis. One user posted a news article on Twitter that a bengali guy was beaten up for speaking bengali. Mamata saying Modi Shah as outsiders was a big blow to them. They thought bjp will not favour bengalis but outsiders only. \n\nBjp tried to push casteism. I didn\'t hear anyone on the ground speak of it. But they were trying to do this on SM and who knows might have actually done it when nobody was looking. They made the election look like the lower castes from all of wb were defeating the upper castes in kolkata who were oppressing them by being commies. There was actually a guy talking about how stupid it is on Twitter. The problem is casteism doesn\'t exist here that much. Matuas are of lower castes but they were not oppressed by UCs but by political leaders from all castes. TMC was a bit afraid that this propaganda might actually defeat them. Which is why you would have heard a lower caste leader from tmc badmouthing lower castes. So bengalis wanted people to protect them from infiltrators but bjp started dividing them. This made me personally feel that bjp coming here this term would only worsen wb. Because they would introduce casteism which would further divide the people. And the way modi is behaving, they would do more harm than good. I am depressed about the violence but I can say defeatimg bjp was good in the long run. \n\nFun fact: My bengali friends had some SCs. They saw him getting a bit insecured about what bjp was doing and they decided to vote for tmc together. \n\nWhat should bjp do? Pick a great cm material (i know one already) who actually respects bengalis and their culture and leave everything to him. And protect the workers.

If at the same time in different locations we do this we'll be heard by government. And those who thinks only posting things on social media will get you something then you're wrong. So, I want every member here to join me on this mission.

<li>Title: 'Power of Compounding - a Slow way to get rich for manuwaadis here'<br />Body: "“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it earns  it… he who doesn’t… pays it.” - Albert Einstein\n\nthis is a great calculator with chart - [https://www.hdfclife.com/financial-tools-calculators/compound-interest-calculator](https://www.hdfclife.com/financial-tools-calculators/compound-interest-calculator)\n\ndisclaimer : I have just started SIPs at the age of 26. I am not selling anything. This is simple maths to help you understand compounding.  \n\n\nI would suggest passive index funds with low expense ratio (mimicking the sensex) \n\n# Example One - Ajay, 23 years old, just started a job of 40k rs per month, no previous savings or investments\n\nLets say Ajay starts a modest SIP of Rs 4000 per month. He lives in bangalore which is a high cost city.\n\nfor  the next 5 years, he pays the same Rs 4000 / month even if his salary  increases. He expects to withdraw this amount at the age of 70.\n\nHe will stop paying any amount after the 5th year and let the compounding do its magic.\n\nSo, Rs 4000 / month SIP, 13% annual returns, 70-23  = 47 years of investment time, 5 years of SIP payments.\n\nAfter  **47** years, his investment of **₹ 2.40 lakhs** will grow to **₹ 7.74 cr (at 13% pa).**\n\nIf he has a house paid off by then, hopefully 7.74Cr in 47 years would be worth something.\n\n# Example Two - Rahul (not Gandhi lol), 40 years old, Software Developer, earns 25 LPA, married and two kids.\n\nRahul  is currently paying the home loan of his fancy apartment and a new car.  His wife doesnt work anymore and after paying for the school fees of 2  kids, he is left with Rs 30k / month.\n\nHe  currently has a Fixed Deposit of Rs 10 lakhs fetching him a measly 6%  per annum. He never invested in stock market because of his father's  beliefs.\n\nSo now he wants to start  an SIP of Rs 10k per month and put a lumpsum deposit of Rs 10 lakhs.  this 10k / month SIP will be payed for 20 years.\n\nHe will encash at age 60 (20 years investment duration).\n\nSo at 13% pa, at the age of 60, he will get **2.47Cr**. had he NOT put the initial deposit of Rs 10 lakhs, he would be looking at just **1.15Cr**.\n\n# Example  3 - Mukesh, 21, is a auto driver in Mumbai. He earns Rs 40k / month.  His family is in Bihar and is recently blessed with a baby boy.\n\nHe  sends all his savings to Bihar and his family spends almost all of it.  They have a bank account but don't have any FDs. Gold and Village land  is the only savings they have.\n\nMukesh  learns a lot by reading Hindi Business newspapers and ferrying  customers near dalal street. He dares to ask questions to his riders  about mutual funds and other savings options. Some of his riders give  genuine advice, some just laugh at him.\n\nMukesh  also knows that without english education and good quality schooling,  his son will meet the same fate as him. So he decides to setup a modest  SIP of just Rs 1000 / month in his son's name.\n\nHe  decides that he will pay these SIPs till his son is 18 years of age and  then let his son pay those EMIs for the rest of his life.\n\nWith  no initial deposit, Rs 1000 / month SIP, 13% pa, 18 years payments, his  corpus grew to 8.63 lakhs after 18 years. Not a lot of amount.\n\nHis son stopped the SIP payments at age 18 and soon forgot about his father's investments.\n\nAfter  many years, at the age of 60, Mukesh's son rediscovered his father's  SIP investment which was stopped when he turned 18. This corpus has now  grown to **19.71Cr (at 13% pa)**. He couldn't believe his eyes.\n\nHad he continued the SIP payments from age 18 to 60 of just Rs 1000 / month, he would be looking at **Rs 21.83Cr**. Not a lot of increase."<br />Author: 'popat_mohamad'<br />id: 'n4gw44'<br />Flair :Atmanirbhar Bharat :modi:</li>

The most anyone can do is post an SOS message on social media. It is time to take things in your hand.\n\nYou need to defend yourselves and assume that you won't get any help whatsoever from anyone, the central leadership will just recite the number of deaths, cry death of democracy and say that law &amp; order is a state subject. The lefticles have already dehumanised you and will celebrate your demise and also try to justify it.\n\nHow to defend yourselves? First make your body strong, become a bull man. It is said that people avoid confrontation with physically strong men, so that should be your first priority. Gather all the karyakartas in your vicinity and start working on your body, so that everyone will be motivated enough to continue.\n\nBut this won't work when you get attacked by a mob. Next is weapons training. Swords, knives, guns, rifles, bombs. Learn as many of these things as you can. Get them legally, illegally, doesn't matter. I am sure BJP has a lot of resources, force your leaders to provide you with weapons.\n\nAll the larping that BJP central leadership is doing, that they will do dharna, oh look Bengal is the next Kashmir etc etc is not going to help the karyakartas. It seems that the BJP cares more for its image in the media, national and international, than to protect their own karyakartas. And their obsession with getting Moslem votes is absolutely sickening.\n\nWhatever the BJP will do, they will always remain fascist communal Hindu supremacists in the eyes of their opponents.

The other major alliance, UDF is majorly christian vote bank and Muslim League combined. So, naturally Hindus vote for Communist party. What had happened now is that, the communist party has widened it's appeal and is starting to leak votes from muslim and christian strongholds. For this the party has taken some pro Islamist stands, there is no denying that. But ultimately if you look closely, the communists have always been in the front to impose UAPAs and conduct raids against Jihadis and are never in tandem with the Islamic fundamentalists of the state.\n\nThough I am a BJP Supporter, there is no denying that the previous Kerala govt's work is appreciable. They carried the state through crises and living in Kerala, I know how the standard of living and the situation of basic infrastructure like roads have been better. Also every person continued receiving ration kits and welfare pensions regularly in his or her home even during the pandemic.\n\nAlso to add, I feel the most safe in Kerala during the crisis rather than any BJP ruled state. We are having an oxygen surplus and only 20% of total ventilators in the state are occupied. Be it using the central funds or rebranding central sector schemes, atleast Kerala govt has done it well and party grass root workers ensured that the benefits reached the last person. \n\nSo, for us, let's accept the defeat now and look forward to 24 and 26. Kerala BJP urgently needs new leaders with greater appeal and history of political work. Also infighting in the party cadres need to stop. BJP also should try to focus on issues like welfare schemes along with religion to win an election in a state like Kerala. Also, the central leadership needs to atleast show that they care about us.
