<li>Title: 'How do you think children of Bollywood/Hollywood actors or actresses react when they see the intimate photos or scenes of their parents?'<br />Body: "Some people were discussing in a whatsapp group how Kareena is arrogant and rude all the time. Someone was yelling that we should boycott her movies or behave in the same way as her to teach her a lession. But then someone suggested not to do anything as she will get her Karma when Taimur will see Dabaang 2, Heroine or Kurbaan. \n\nNow this got me thinking. I have read in an old interview that Ranbhir Kapoor used to hate his mother if she ever did romance with another man in a movie. I am pretty sure it holds true for most human beings in general. Sanjay Dutt was also bullied because of his mother's affair with Raj Kapoor. What really goes through a child's mi d when they are surrounded by beautiful or intimate pictures of their parents with other people all the time. Is that the reason why most pornstars opt not to have a baby or live in extremely troubled lives? If Sunny Leone's child ever searched her mother on pornhub (or even on wikipedia) then how would he react with what he would see? Now the actresees of the past generation didn't do such intimate scenes. Juhi Chawla, Kajol, Madhuri or even Aiswarya's children will never have to face all these I guess. But what would the children of Bipasha Basu, Kareena Kapooe or even Zeenat Aman (I know she doesn't have a child) ever think of their mothers when they see these things? Is it the reason why they end up so different than normal people or just too much detached from the world in general. Now you might love or hate the Tatas or Ambanis but they are also rich but they hardly make any stupid statement in public. Even their children don't do that. So money is perhaps not the only thing that makes these people so detached from the world. Is this the reason why they are so craxy?"<br />Author: 'Styeyr'<br />id: 'fjg8fd'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li>

And they saved their economy ?!\n\n This is what the Americans and Europeans think, after they sold their shares in high-value-added technology companies for a minimal price to the Chinese government.\n\n According to them, the Chinese leadership used an "economic tactic" that made everyone swallow the bait easily, before they asserted that China did not resort to implementing a high political strategy to get rid of European investors, in support of China\'s economy, which would bypass the US economy with this step ..!\n\n And because it teaches the science of certainty that Europeans and Americans are looking for excuses to slow and bankrupt the Chinese economy, China has sacrificed some hundreds of its citizens, instead of sacrificing an entire people ..!\n\n Through this tactic, China succeeded in "deceiving all", as it reaped about $ 20 billion in two days, and the Chinese president succeeded in deceiving the European Union and the United States of America in the eyes of the world, and played an economic game of a tactical nature, which was unthinkable.  !\n\n Before the Corona virus, most of the stocks and stakes in investment projects at "Technology and Chemicals" production plants were owned by European and American investors ..!\n\n This means that more than half of the profits from the light and heavy technological and chemical industries went to the hands of foreign investors, not to the Chinese treasury, which led to a decline in the Chinese currency, the yuan, .. and the Chinese central bank could not  To do something against the continuous fall of the yuan ..!\n\n There was even widespread news that China was unable to purchase masks to prevent the spread of the deadly virus.  These rumors and the Chinese President’s statements that he is “not ready to save the country from the virus” have led to a sharp drop in the purchase prices of shares of technology companies in China, and the empires of “foreign” investors have raced to offer investment shares for sale at very low prices, and with attractive offers,  "Never seen before" in history ..!\n\n The Chinese government waited for foreign share prices to reach their "almost free" minimums, and then issued an order to purchase them.  And bought the shares of Americans and Europeans ..!\n\n And when European and American investment financiers realized that they had been deceived, it was too late, as the shares were in the hands of the Chinese government, which in this process nationalized most of the foreign companies erected on its soil in a near-free manner, without causing a political crisis or a single shot ..  !\n\n The same sources confirmed and pointed out that "Corona" is a "real" virus, but it is not a terrible danger that has been promoted across the world ..!\n\n China began to take out the anti-virus vaccine, this vaccine that it had owned from the beginning on the shelves of refrigerators after it had received its goal ..!'<br />Author: 'Netkilluialways'<br />id: 'fje70k'<br />Flair :WhatsApp Forward</li>
<li>Title: 'A story about a friend'<br />Body: 'Once upon a time, long long ago, I was active on Twatter. Late 2017, early 2018. That was a period of a great change there. \n\nTwatter had been, till then, dominated by librandu chuttads. Most of the right wingers at that time were raitas. But one guy decided this wasn’t good enough. The narrative had to change. \n\nThat guy was pegun cat. You might have read his answers on quora. If not, please do. He will blow your mind. \n\nPegun, as we fondly called him, was much smarter than everyone else there. While there were, and still are better read people than him, Pegun had a gift. You see, while others read history, Pegun perceived things differently. It was as if he could actually talk with historical figures, glean their experiences, he could draw insights from random texts that seemed so obvious, but only once they had been disclosed. \n\nPegun was sick of librandu chuttads setting the narrative, and he scoffed at raitas who could only whimper in response. Hindus needed to take control of the wheel, he decided. We had to be the ones writing our history. \n\nBut how?\n\nSimple answer, dear Bhratas, is expanding the overton window, in our favour. \n\nCan we replicate it here?\n\nYes. By doing one small thing, we can. And just how twatter was bhagwafied, so can be rebbit. \n\nAnd what is this thing that we must do, you must wonder Bhratas. \n\nThe answer is, and please grill this into your heads, Never throw a Hindu under the bus, despite what he says. No matter how ‘extreme’ his opinion, do not censure him in public, in front of &lt;redacted&gt; or librandus. Defend him, let him set the narrative. \n\nYou will hear the same shrieking howls from leftie chutiyas, “fascist”, “n*zi” but don’t back down. Don’t go around talking how we aren’t what they accuse us of. Embrace their slurs. \n\nThis happened on twatter when all looked lost, and we  won against overwhelming odds. We can definitely repeat that here on rebbit. We can definitely win again. Remember to be strong, and stand by your fellow Hindus.'<br />Author: 'Faltu_Account13'<br />id: 'fjdeax'<br />Flair :OC है बे!</li>

Movie showed Mudslime boy dating a hindu girl, and when her family and guru tell her otherwise then they're portrayed as backward and villainous. Clearly, this is promoting love jihad. \n\n2. Shiva is seen in bathroom and made fun of meanwhile Ola and his messenger MoMad are untouchable. \n\nActor Amir Khan himself has married twice and both times with Hindu girls. Srk also married a hindu. Saif Ali Khan also married multiple times and all with Hindus. Bollywood is promoting love jihad because a) it's filled with mudslimes b) they get money from D company and Arabs to promote that crap. \n\n\nCall me narcissistic but I don't think India will become an Islamic country but I KNOW India will become an Islamic country, it's just about time. And the main culprit behind this will be other liberal hindus who made PK such a success and don't see any problem. Rant over."<br />Author: 'guiltsin'<br />id: 'fiejrf'<br />Flair :Rant</li>
<li>Title: 'Something to be proud of'<br />Body: "Something to be proud of as Indians:\n1. Firstly, despite sharing a border of 3,488 kilometres with China, India has only reported 78 cases and 1 death- compare that with 596 cases and 8 deaths in the UK.\n2. India is the only country in the world to evacuate its citizens 6 times (and counting) and evacuated the most number of foreign nationals.\n3. The Indian Air Force evacuated a total of 723 Indians, 37 foreign nationals from Wuhan. India evacuated 119 Indians and 5 foreign nationals from Japan. IAF also evacuated 58 Indian pilgrims from Iran on the 10th of March. Total: 900 Indians and 48 foreign nationals.\n4. India is leading the fight against COVID-19 in the South Asian region, offering diplomatic, humanitarian and medical assistance to its neighbours.\n5. A total of 56 Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDLs) have been set up in India to test its citizens as well as foreign citizens in a record time, with a plan to build 56 more VRDLs in the next month. This insane level of efficiency hasn't caught the eye of the media.\n6. India currently has one of the world’s most efficient and reliable testing systems, reducing the time taken to get test results back from 12-14 hours to four hours. US health officials have admitted that their system is failing and has testing has been very sluggish.\n7. As a result, from Iran, Afghanistan up to Timor Leste, countries in Asia have been requesting India to help set up testing facilities in their countries.\n8. India has sent 6 top scientists to set up a make-shift lab and testing facility in Iran to test 6000 of its citizens because Iranian officials refused to test Indians due to their high load. India plans to send 3 more airplanes in the next week to airlift its citizens.\n9. India has provided 15 tonnes of medical assistance comprising masks, gloves and other emergency medical equipment to China.\n10. India has sent Maldives a 14 member medical team comprising of pulmonologists, anaesthetists, physicians &amp; lab technicians and also a large composite of COVID-19 medical relief to assist Maldives health authorities.\n11. India has screened 1,057,506 people from 30 airports and 77 seaports.\n12. India has suspended all visas to India as well as visa-free travel facility for OCI cardholders. It has closed its border with Myanmar. The Indian nationals coming from COVID-19 hit nations after 15 February will be quarantined for 14 days. This in contrast with the UK with far more cases but no quick action whatsoever.\n13. India has the world’s biggest state-sponsored health assurance scheme, covering over 500 million beneficiaries (approximately 8 times the size of the UK).\n14. Indian drug prices are among the cheapest in the world. Medbelle ranks India as one of the five countries with the lowest median prices for drugs around the world due to an elaborate price control mechanism for drugs and the government’s Jan Aushadi project to provide cheap affordable medicines to the poor..\n\n- From a twitter response, all facts check out. The only true Chinese incursion has been via fried rice and spring rolls with garam masala so be thankful."<br />Author: 'EngancheIN'<br />id: 'fie5yc'<br />Flair :From Twitter</li>

<li>Title: 'Step By Step Strategy to Convert a Librandu into a Sanghi'<br />Body: 'In order to convert them first we have to understand WHY they say what they say:\n\nRemember sickular hindus are NOT as same as urban naxals or j!had!s. They are just bhatka hua hindus.\n\nThis is what they believe right now:\n\nBhakts are uneducated\nBhakts hate muslims\nBhakts only do hindu-muslim\nBJP is anti muslim\nBJP is creating divide for votes\nDecisions like DEMO, Adhar were wrong\nBad economy\nHindu bad\nRSS bad\nIndia bad\nModi fascist\nAnd many more things...\n\nThis all have been done by leftists over a LONG period of time.\n\nAfter constant brainwashing with fake  and distorted data, this has sunk deep down into the sickcular hindus.\n\nWe need to break all of these things based on lies.\n\nBut how?\n\n2 Steps:\n\nIndic Renaissance\nAwareness\n\nThese sickular hindus are not enough identified with there culture and hinduism.\n\nThis is a huge problem as these people don\'t care even they come to know urban naxals have been distorting our history.\n\nHistory textbooks haven\'t mentioned anything about Sambhaji who fought 100+ battles with mughal for 9 years and won every single battle was a nightmare to mughals.\n\nBut rather history textbooks glorify mughals especially one Aurangjeb who was the most inhuman mughal ever. \n\nSo\n\nFirst we have to remind sickular of who they are and what culture and land they are from.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nStep 1)\n\nShare more information about ancient Hindu civilization.\n\nWhere to get the information:\nPraveen Mohan\nTrue Indology\nSadhguru\n\nJust to name a few\n\nMarketing:\n\nPut these things on your WhatsApp status. Share it with peoole as much as possible.\n\nStart an Instagram account and share content with similar accounts. Watermark content only when posting. \n\nDon\'t watermark content when sharing it with similar accounts.\n\nNobody is going to call you a bhakt for putting an informational image or a video clip of let\'s say "How yoga came into being" Or " Archeological evidences of a Shiva idol that is 28,000 years old". You get the point.\n\nThis will make them proud of their own culture. And they won\'t buy into the bullsh*t that Hinduism sucks and rice bag or mo is real.\n\nIN SHORT : Become A tiny true Indology. They should think you are interested in archeology.\n\nStep 2) Awareness\n\nOne source that I\'d like to share:\n\nDK dubey.\n\nWhen you meet them don\'t talk about modi or BJP or anything like that. don\'t show political inclination just yet.\n\nHere\'s what you have to do:\n\nGather as much as possible info on urban naxals and islamists.\n\nThey don\'t know sh*t about urban naxals or islamists that\'s why they are not right wing.\n\nEducate them about these 2 anti national forces. Don\'t try to link it with politics just yet.\n\nFirst let them realize HOW BIG is this problem.\n\nOnce they are realize it\'s a real threat, now you connect it with bjp.\n\nGather info on in how many ways has BJP screwed anti national foeces.\n\nFor e.g. ask them questions like\n\nWhy do you think during BJP 20,000+ NGOs were shut down overnight?\n\nWhere was the funding coming from?\n\nWhat was the funding used for?\n\nAnd what about Christian missionary NGOs\n\nWhat is RTF (red terror funding) and GTF (green terror funding)?\n\nWhy did qatar funded 59 million recently to NYT?\n\nMake them realize how BJP is NOT creating divide.\n\nIt\'s the Urban Naxals, Islamists and Missionaries all together playing this game.\n\nProve them how the international media is being hijacked by urban naxals.\n\nThey will get back. Remember sickular hindus are NOT anti national elements.\n\nThey are just chut!yas.\n\nGo and Save Dharma.\n\nTathastu 🤚'<br />Author: 'johnkarter767612'<br />id: 'fhz69r'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>

<li>Title: 'Imagine This'<br />Body: '  \n\nYou work as a watchman at a graveyard. Your shift begins at ten in the evening and your shift ends at six in the morning. Your life is sad. Your parents don’t talk you anymore, you have no friends and you are a virgin. Tonight, a body arrived at the graveyard. A girl, age twenty-three with a beautiful face that shines like the moon. Your eyes fall upon her dead face and you feel something. It’s love, you realize. The feeling is quickly curbed by knowing the fact that she is now dead. You start to feel dreadful and horrified. Why do people have to die at such a young age? You ask yourself. While pondering over this question, you realize that she has now been buried. Her body lies six feet under the ground, boxed in her coffin to rot for eternity. The first woman you ever loved died before you even knew her. \n\nYou go to her grave and sit in front of it. The soil’s still damp and the tombstone has not yet been installed. The graveyard is silent and empty. No one is around. A sinister feeling grows inside your head. Maybe your dream could come true. Maybe you can love her, but just once. You can love her in the dead silence of the night. What you could never accomplish when she was alive, you can after she is dead. You get up, turn the CCTV camera off and grab the shovel. You get to work right away. Your hand work the shovel and start to dig out the fresh soil. After sometime, you get to the grave. You open it up to reveal the beautiful woman inside, asleep for all eternity. You grab her by the waist and pick her up.\n\nYou climb out of the grave with your love in your arms. Her body now lies on the ground. Stripped naked by your hands. Your eyes look at her cold body. Dead but beautiful. Love is blind, you keep reminding yourself. You take your pants off and get ready. Your oil up the body, getting her ready for your love. This is the first time you penetrate a woman, she is dead but remember, LOVE IS BLIND. Just as your dick goes inside, you feel something that you never felt before. It’s love, you realize. Before you start to thrust, the dead silence is broken by a cry. “*Ah*”, the moan your ears hear. You look down, shocked. \n\nThe girl is looking at you, eyes wide open. Her eyes are not like yours, they are white and shine like the moon. You immediately pull out of her and your feeling of lust is quickly curbed by seeing her smile at you. You get up and walk two steps back. \n\n“*Kya hua? Daloge nahi?”* Her mouth begins to speak. You take two more steps back. \n\n“*Arey, baith gya kya?”* She says, standing up. You feel your dick get loose and you are left horrified. \n\n“*Kya re? ab chodne ka nahi kya tereko.”* She says, now bending into a spider-walk position. Her body swiftly creeps towards you, spider-walking. You stand frozen, not knowing what to do. You quickly regret your decisions. You curse your stupid lust and start to cry. Your eyes are watering and she is now right before you, now sitting on both her knees. \n\n“*Chal mai tujhe batati hoon.”* Her cold hands grab your soft dick. Her grip is firm yet delicate. She starts to move her hands. Your feeling of horror is slowly curbed by the feeling your first hand job. Her hands are now moving fast, to and fro. This is like the most horrible dream that you still enjoy. Just when you start to get in the mood, you feel her grip get harder. The hardness of her grip only gets stronger. You start to feel pain. You are now screaming but no one can hear you. \n\n“*Tujhe pata hai mai kya karti hai tere jaise chikne laundo ka?”* She chuckles. You quickly remember that you shaved you pubes today. This is an irrelevant thought but you are a dumb potato who thinks with his dick. Before you know it, she reveals her teeth which are filed into fangs. \n\nShe opens her mouth, “*Mooh me lon kya?”* She says before grabbing the tip of your dick with her mouth. Before you know it, she has bitten your tip off.\n\n“*Maza aya kya tereko? Tera* first hand job.” The horrible pain bleed into your body. Your screaming is now more intense. You look down and see that she is now pulling your dick. Her firm grim pulls off the rest of your genitalia. The pain intensifies and you feel the blood gushing out. This is when she stands up. You feel something hard emerging from her body that pokes your stomach. It’s her dick, you realize. \n\n“*Ab mai legi.”* You hear her wretched voice whisper in your ear while you scream your lungs out. Her dick penetrates the hole left by your missing body part. She is thrusting into you with fervent intensity. Slowly, the pain stops. You start to like it. You are now moaning. You never thought being fucked by a dead girl was so great. Looking at her, you realize she is now looking somewhat like you, her face is slowing melting into yours. This is when everything starts to get blurry for you. \n\nYour eyes get sleepy and you feel like you are empty. Its blood-loss, you realize. The feeling of pleasure is immediately curbed by the feeling of numbness. She throws you down, her dick is engulfed in blood. Your blurry vision examines your body laying down. It’s not your body anymore. You realize that you are now the girl. You cannot move, all you see is blurred and all you can make out is that the “girl” now looks completely like you. “*Tera toh* first time, last time *ban gaya.”*  She says. You are helpless. You curse your lust for the last time. Your body gets cold. It’s death, you realize. Your head drops, you give your last breath and the last thing you see before dying is her closing you into the coffin, winking at you with your eyes. The final thing you say before your body becomes life-less is\n\n“*Behen ki lodi”.*'<br />Author: 'jrhuman'<br />id: 'fhbleb'<br />Flair :Copypasta</li>

I understand that many are reluctant to participate in Holi, and those who do play Holi try to force them in, but there should be a method to that. The complete lack of respect by forcing yourself physically without restraint on someone is nothing short of molestation IMHO, and the girls in those videos just seem like they go through it helplessly. Totally disgusted right now. Looking at those videos, I totally understand why Holi gets called as an excuse to molest girls, and definitely convinced a lot of guys probably use Holi for the same reason. \n\nThere are a lot of videos where men and women are involved voluntarily and they seem to be having a lot of fun which is totally the point of Holi. But the videos where guys force this on girls is both terrifying and disgusting to watch. There needs to be a lot of push on educating men and women on issues like good touch and bad touch, and especially encourage women to fearlessly complain about such situations, even take the matter to the police if need be, that is the only way to keep such shameless people in check.

<li>Title: 'The Mitrokhin Archive — The Special Relationship With India [Part 1: The supremacy of the Indian National Congress]'<br />Body: 'What is The Mitrokhin Archive?\n\nThe "Mitrokhin Archive" is a collection of handwritten notes made secretly by KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin during his thirty years as a KGB archivist in the foreign intelligence service and the First Chief Directorate. When he defected to the United Kingdom in 1992 he brought the archive with him. [The Mitrokhin Archive Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitrokhin_Archive#India_inquiry)\n\nA chapter from the book ‘The Mitrokhin Archive II: The KGB and the World\' shows that Indira Gandhi was on the payroll of KGB. The whole nation was on the payroll of KGB and even ISI. Indira was put in place by murdering Lal Bahadur Shastri, the second PM of India, by the KGB.\n\n# The Special Relationship With India\n\n**Part 1: The supremacy of the Indian National Congress**\n\nThe Third World country on which the KGB eventually concentrated most operational effort during the Cold War was India. Under Stalin, however, India had been regarded as an imperialist puppet. The Great Soviet Encyclopedia dismissed Mohandas \'Mahatma\' Gandhi, who led India to independence in 1947, as \'a reactionary…. who betrayed the people and helped the imperialists against them; aped the ascetics; pretended in a demagogic way to be a supporter of Indian independence and an enemy of the British; and widely exploited religious prejudice\'. Despite his distaste for Stalinist attacks Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of independent India, \'had no doubt that the Soviet revolution had advanced human society by a great leap and had lit a bright flame which could not be smothered\'. Though later eulogized by Soviet writers as ‘a leader of international magnitude who ranked \'among the best minds of the twentieth century\', Nehru was well aware that until Stalin\'s death in 1953 he, like Gandhi, was regarded as a reactionary. During the early years of Indian independence, secret correspondence from Moscow to the Communist Party of India (CPI) was frequently intercepted by the Intelligence Branch (IB) in New Delhi (as it had been when the IB was working for the British Raj). According to the head of the IB, B. N. Mullik, until the early 1950s \'every instruction that had issued from Moscow had expressed the necessity and importance \\[for\\] the Indian Communist Party to overthrow the "reactionary" Nehru Government\'. Early in 1951 Mullik gave Nehru a copy of the latest exhortations from Moscow to the CPI, which contained a warning that they must not fall into government hands. Nehru \'laughed out loud and remarked that Moscow apparently did not know how smart our Intelligence was\'.\n\nNeither Nehru nor the IB, however, realized how thoroughly the Indian embassy in Moscow was being penetrated by the KGB, using its usual varieties of the honey trap. The Indian diplomat PROKHOR (code name given for the Indian by KGB) was recruited, probably in the early 1950s, with the help of a female swallow (a female Russian prostitute/spy), codenamed NEVEROVA, who presumably seduced him. The KGB was clearly pleased with the material which PROKHOR provided, which included on two occasions the embassy code-book and deciphering tables, since in 1954 it increased his monthly payments from 1,000 to 4,000 rupees. Another Indian diplomat, RADAR, was recruited in 1956, also with the assistance of a swallow, who on this occasion claimed (probably falsely) to be pregnant. A third KGB swallow persuaded a cipher clerk in the Indian embassy, ARTUR, to go heavily into debt in order to make it easier to compromise him. He was recruited as an agent in 1957 after being trapped (probably into illegal currency dealing) by a KGB officer posing as a black-marketeer. As a result of these and other penetrations of the embassy, Soviet code breakers were probably able to decrypt substantial numbers of Indian diplomatic communications.\n\nAs KGB operations in India expanded during the 1950s and 1960s, the Centre seems to have discovered the extent of the IB\'s previous penetration of the CPI. According to a KGB report, an investigation into Promode Das Gupta, who became secretary of the Bengal Communist Party in 1959, concluded that he had been recruited by the IB in 1947. Further significant IB penetrations were discovered in the Kerala and Madras parties. By the 1960s KGB penetration of the Indian intelligence community and other parts of its official bureaucracy had enabled it to turn the tables on the IB. After the KGB became the main conduit for both money and secret communications from Moscow, high-level IB penetration of the CPI (Communist Party of India) became much more difficult. As in other Communist parties, this secret channel was known only to a small inner circle within the leadership. In 1959 the CPI General Secretary, Ajoy Ghosh, agreed With the Delhi residency on plans to fund an import-export business for trade with the Soviet bloc, headed by a senior Party member codenamed DED, whose profits would be creamed off for "party funds”. Within little more than a decade its annual profits had grown to over 3 million rupees. The Soviet news agency Novosti provided further subsidies by routinely paying the CPI publishing House at a rate 50 percent above its normal charges.\n\nMoscow\'s interest in Nehru was greatly enhanced by his emergence (together with Nasser and Tito) as one of the leaders of the Non-Aligned Movement, which began to take shape at the Bandung Conference in 1955, An exchange of official visits in the same year by Nehru and Khrushchev opened a new era in Indo-Soviet relations. On his return from India in December, Khrushchev reported to the Presidium that he had received a warm welcome, but criticized the \'primitive\' portrayal of India in Soviet publications and films which demonstrated a poor grasp of Indian culture. Khrushchev was, however, clearly pleased with the intelligence and personal security provided by the KGB during his trip and proposed that the officers concerned be decorated and considered for salary increases American reliance on Pakistan as a strategic counterweight to Soviet influence in Asia encouraged India to turn to the USSR. In 1956 Nehru declared that he had never encountered a \'grosser case of naked aggression\' than the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, but failed to condemn the brutal Soviet suppression of the Hungarian Uprising in the same year. India voted against a UN resolution calling for free elections in Hungary and the withdrawal of Soviet forces. The Kremlin increasingly valued Indian support as, with growing frequency, the Non-Aligned Movement tended to vote in the UN with the Soviet bloc rather than the West. During the 1960s India and the Soviet Union found further common cause against Mao\'s China.\n\nWithin Nehru\'s Congress Party government the KGB set out to cultivate its leading left-wing firebrand and Nehru\'s close adviser, Krishna Menon, who became Minister of Defense in 1957 after spending most of the previous decade as, successively, Indian High Commissioner in London and representative at the United Nations. To the Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei Gromyko, \'It was……. plain that \\[Menon\\] was personally friendly to the Soviet Union. He would say to me heatedly: "You cannot imagine the hatred the Indian people felt and stiff feel to the colonialists, the British…… The methods used by American capital to exploit the backward countries may be oblique, but they\'re just as harsh."\n\nIn May 1962 the Soviet Presidium (which under Khrushchev replaced the Politburo) authorized the KGB residency in New Delhi to conduct active-measures operations designed to strengthen Menon\'s position in India and enhance his personal popularity, probably in the hope that he would become Nehru\'s successor. During Menon\'s tenure of the Defense Ministry, India\'s main source of arms imports switched from the West to the Soviet Union. The Indian decision in the summer of 1962 to purchase MiG-21s rather than British Lightnings was due chiefly to Menon. The British High Commissioner in New Delhi reported to London, “Krishna Menon has from the beginning managed to surround this question with almost conspiratorial official and ministerial secrecy combined with a skillful putting about of stories in favour of the MiG and against Western aircraft”. Menon\'s career, however, was disrupted by the Chinese invasion of India in October 1961. Having failed to take the prospect of invasion seriously until the eve of the attack, Menon found himself made the scapegoat for India\'s unpreparedness. Following the rout of Indian forces by the Chinese, Nehru reluctantly dismissed him on 31 October. A fortnight later, the Presidium authorized active measures by the Delhi residency, including secret finance for a newspaper which supported Menon, in a forlorn attempt to resuscitate his political career. Though similar active measures by the KGB in Menon\'s favour before the 1967 election also had little observable effect, a secret message to Menon from the CPSU Central Committee (probably sent by its International Department) expressed appreciation for his positive attitude to the Soviet Union.\n\nKGB support did little to revive Menon\'s fortunes. Before he became Defense Minister, most of his political career had been spent outside India, including twenty eight years in Britain, where he had served for more than a decade as a Labour councilor in London. As a result, despite the personal support of some ardent disciples within the Congress Party (at least one of whom received substantial KGB funding) Menon lacked any real popular following in India itself. By the time he returned to India from foreign exiles the only language he spoke was English, he could no longer tolerate spicy Indian food and he preferred a tweed jacket and flannel trousers to traditional Indian dress. After failing to be denominated by Congress in his existing Bombay constituency for the 1967 election, Menon stood unsuccessfully as an independent. Two years later, with Communist support, he was elected as an independent in West Bengal. Some of the issues on which he campaigned suggest that he had been influenced by KGB active measures-as, for example, in his demand that American troops in Vietnam be tried for genocide and his claim that they were slitting open the wombs of pregnant women to expose their unborn babies. Well before his death in 1974, however, Menon had ceased to be an influential voice in Indian politics.\n\nFollowing Menon\'s political eclipse, Moscow\'s preferred candidate to succeed Nehru after his death in May 1964, was Gulzarilal Nanda, Home Minister and number two in the cabinet. The Delhi residency was ordered to do all it could to further his candidature but to switch support to Lal Bahadur Shastri, also a close associate of Nehru, if Nanda\'s campaign failed. There is no indication in the files noted by Mitrokhin that the KGB was in contact with either Nanda or Shastri. Moscow\'s main reason for supporting them was almost certainly, negative rather than positive-to prevent the right-wing Hindu traditionalist Morarji Desai, who began each day by drinking a glass of his own urine (a practice extolled in ancient Indian medical treatises), from succeeding Nehru. In the event, after Desai had been persuaded to withdraw reluctantly from the contest, Shastri became Prime Minister with the unanimous backing of Congress. Following Shastri\'s sudden death in January 1966, the cabal of Congress leaders (the \'Syndicate’) chose Nehru\'s daughter, Indira Gandhi (codenamed VANO by the KGB), as his successor in the mistaken belief that she would prove a popular figurehead whom they could manipulate at will.\n\nThe KGB\'s first prolonged contact with Indira Gandhi had occurred during her first visit to the Soviet Union a few months after Stalin\'s death in 1953. As well as keeping her under continuous surveillance, the Second Chief Directorate also surrounded her with handsome, attentive male admirers. Unaware of the orchestration of her welcome by the KGB, Indira was overwhelmed by the attentions lavished on her. Though she did not mention the male admirers in letters to her father, she wrote to him, \'Everybody-the Russians-have been so sweet to me... I am being treated like everybody\'s only daughter-I shall be horribly spoilt by the time I leave. Nobody has ever been so nice to me.\' Indira wrote of a holiday arranged for her on the Black Sea, ‘I don\'t think I have had such a holiday for years’. Later, in Leningrad, she told Nehru that she was \'wallowing in luxury\'. Two years later Indira accompanied her father on his first official visit to the Soviet Union. Like Nehru, she was visibly impressed by the apparent successes of Soviet planning and economic modernization exhibited to them in carefully stage-managed visits to Russian factories. During her trip, Khrushchev presented her with a mink coat which became one of the favorite items in her wardrobe-despite the fact that a few years earlier she had criticized the female Indian ambassador in Moscow for accepting a similar gift.\n\nSoviet attempts to cultivate Indira Gandhi during the 1950s were motivated far more by the desire to influence her father than by any awareness of her own political potential. Like both the Congress Syndicate and the CPI, Moscow still underestimated her when she became Prime Minister. During her early appearances in parliament, Mrs. Gandhi seemed tongue-tied and unable to think on her feet. The insulting nickname coined by a socialist MP, \'Dumb Doll’ began to stick. Moscow\'s strategy during 1966 for the Indian elections in the following year was based on encouraging the CPI and the breakaway Communist Party of India, Marxist (CPM) to join together in a left-wing alliance to oppose Mrs. Gandhi and the Congress government. As well as subsidizing the CPI and some other left-wing groups during the 1967 election campaign, the KGB also funded the campaigns of several agents and confidential contacts within Congress. The most senior agent identified in the files noted by Mitrokhin was a minister codenamed ABAD, who was regarded by the KGB as \'extremely influential\'.\n\nDuring the election campaign, the KGB also made considerable use of active measures, many of them based on forged American documents produced by Service A. An agent in the information department of the US embassy in New Delhi, codenamed MIKHAIL, provided examples of documents and samples of signatures to assist in the production of convincing forgeries. Among the operations officers who publicized the forgeries produced for the 1967 election campaign was Yuri Modin, former controller of the Cambridge \'Magnificent Five\'. In an attempt to discredit S.K. Patil, one of the leading anti-Communists in the Congress Syndicate, Modin circulated a forged letter from the US consul-general in Bombay to the American ambassador in New Delhi referring to Patil’s political intrigues with the Pakistanis\' and to the large American subsidies supposedly given to him. Though Patil was one of the most senior Congress politicians defeated at the election, it remains difficult to assess how much his defeat owed to KGB active measures. Modin also publicized a bogus telegram to London from the British High Commissioner, John Freeman, reporting that the United States was giving vast sums to right-wing parties and politicians. The fact that the KGB appears to have had no agent like MIKHAIL in the High Commission, however, led Service A on this occasion to make an embarrassing error. Its forgery mistakenly described the British High Commissioner as Sir John Freeman.\n\nOther Service A fabrications had much greater success. Among them was a forged letter purporting to come from Gordon Goldstein of the US Office of Naval Research and revealing the existence of (in reality non-existent) American bacteriological warfare weapons in Vietnam and Thailand. Originally published in the Bombay ‘Free Press Journal’, the letter was reported in the London ‘Times’ on 7 March 1968 and used by Moscow Radio in broadcasts beamed at Asia as proof that the United States had spread epidemics in Vietnam. The Indian weekly ‘Blitz’ headlined a story based on the same forgery, ‘US Admits Biological and Nuclear Warfare\'. Goldstein\'s signature and official letterhead were subsequently discovered to have been copied from an invitation to an international scientific symposium circulated by him the previous year.\n\nAfter the elections of February 1967, the KGB claimed, doubtless optimistically, that it was able to influence 30 to 40 percent of the new parliament. Congress lost 21 percent of its seats. The conflict between Indira Gandhi and her chief rival Morarji Desai made its forty-four-seat majority precarious and obliged her to accept Desai as Deputy Prime Minister. By 1968 Desai and Kamaraj, the head of the Syndicate, were agreed on the need to replace Mrs. Gandhi. Congress was moving inexorably towards a split.\n\nDuring 1969 there were major policy reorientations in both Moscow and Delhi. The growing threat from China persuaded the Kremlin to make a special relationship with India the basis of its South Asian policy. Simultaneously, Mrs. Gandhi set out to secure left-wing support against the Syndicate. In July 1969 she nationalized fourteen commercial banks. Desai was sacked as Finance Minister and resigned as Deputy Prime Minister- Encouraged by Moscow, the CPI swung its support behind Mrs. Gandhi. By infiltrating its members and sympathizers into the left-wing Congress Forum for Socialist Action (codenamed SECTOR by the KGB), the CPI set out to gain a position of influence within the ruling party. In November the Syndicate declared Mrs. Gandhi guilty of defiance of the Congress leadership and dismissed her from the: parry, which then split in two: Congress (O), which followed the Syndicate line, and Congress (R), which supported Mrs. Gandhi. The Syndicate hinted that Mrs. Gandhi intended to \'sell\' India to the Soviet Union and was using her principal private secretary, Parmeshwar Narain Haksar, as a direct link with Moscow and the Soviet embassy.\n\nFrom 1967 to 1973 Haksar, a former protégé of Krishna Menon, was Mrs. Gandhi\'s most trusted adviser. One of her biographers, Katherine Frank, describes him as \'a magnetic figure\' who became \'probably the most influential and powerful person in the government\' as well as \'the most important civil servant in the country\'. Haksar set out to turn a civil service which at least in principle, was politically neutral into an ideologically \'committed bureaucracy\'. His was the hand that guided Mrs. Gandhi through her turn to the left, the nationalization of the banks and the split in the Congress Party, It was Haksar also who was behind the transfer of control of the intelligence community to the Prime Minister\'s Secretariat. His advocacy of the leftward turn in Mrs. Gandhi\'s policies sprang, however, from his socialist convictions rather than from manipulation by the KGB. But both he and Mrs. Gandhi \'were less fastidious than Nehru had been about interfering with the democratic system and structure of government to attain their ideological ends\'. The journalist Inder Malhotra noted the growth of a ‘courtier culture\' in Indira Gandhi\'s entourage: \'The power centre in the world\'s largest democracy was slowly turning into a durbar\'. At the elections of February 1971 Mrs. Gandhi won a landslide victory. With seventy seats more than the undivided Congress had won in 1967, her Congress (R) had a two-thirds majority. The Congress Forum for Socialist Action had the support of about 100 MPs in the new parliament. Mrs. Gandhi made its most vocal spokesman, the former Communist Mohan Kumaramangalam, Minister of Mines; one of his first acts was the nationalization of the coal industry. Kumaramangalam seemed to be implementing a \'thesis\' which he had first argued in 1964: that since the CPI could not win power by itself, as many of its members and sympathizers as possible should join the Congress, make common cause with \'progressive\' Congressmen and compel the party leadership to implement socialist policies. Another leading figure in the Congress Forum for Socialist Action was recruited in 1971 as Agent RERO and paid about 100,000 rupees a year for what the KGB considered important political intelligence as well as acting as an agent recruiter. His controllers included the future head of the FCD, Leonid Shebarshin (codenamed VERNOV).\n\nIn August 1971 Mrs. Gandhi signed a Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Co-operation with the Soviet Union, According to the Permanent Secretary at the Indian Foreign Office, T.N. Kaul, it was one of the few closely guarded secret negotiations that India has ever conducted. On \\[the Indian\\] side, hardly half a dozen people were aware of it, including the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. The media got no scent of it. A delighted Gromyko declared at the signing ceremony, ‘The significance of the Treaty cannot be over-estimated.\' Mrs. Gandhi\'s popularity among the Soviet people, he later claimed, was demonstrated by the large number of Soviet babies who were given the unusual name Indira. The Soviet Union seemed to be guaranteed the support of the leading power in the Non-Aligned Movement. Both countries immediately issued a joint communiqué calling for the withdrawal of US troops from Vietnam. India was able to rely on Soviet arms supplies and diplomatic support in the conflict against Pakistan which was already in the offing. According to Leonid Shebarshin, who was posted to New Delhi as head of Line PR (political intelligence) at a time when \'Soviet military Technology was flowing into India in an endless stream\', the Centre-unlike many in the Foreign Ministry-concluded that war was inevitable. Shebarshin realized that war had begun when the lights went out in the middle of a diplomatic reception at the Soviet embassy on 2 December. Looking out of the window, Shebarshin saw that the power cut affected the whole of the capital. Leaving the embassy hurriedly, he drove to a phone box some way away to ring a member of the residency\'s agent network who confirmed that hostilities had started. Another member of the network arranged a meeting between Shebarshin and a senior Indian military commander:\n\nIt would fit an understatement to say that the general\'s mood was optimistic. He knew precisely when and how the war would end: on 16 December with the surrender of Dacca \\[later renamed Dhaka\\] and capitulation of the Pakistani army \\[in East Pakistan\\]... They were in no stare to resist and would not defend Dacca, because they had no one from whom to expect help. \'We know the Pakistani army\', my interlocutor said, ‘Any professional soldiers would behave the same way in their place\'.\n\nDespite diplomatic support from both the United States and China, Pakistan suffered a crushing defeat in the fourteen-day war with India. East Pakistan gained independence as Bangladesh, West Pakistan, reduced to a nation of only 55 million people, could no longer mount a credible challenge to India. For most Indians it was Mrs. Gandhi’s finest hour. A Soviet diplomat at the United Nations exulted, ‘This is the first time in history that the United States and China have been defeated together!\'\n\nIn the Centre, the Indo-Soviet special relationship was also celebrated as a triumph for the KGB. The residency in New Delhi was rewarded by being upgraded to the status of \'main residency\'. Its head from 1970 to 1975, Yakov Prokofyevich Medyanik, was accorded the title of \'main resident\', while the heads of Lines PR (political intelligence), KR (counter-intelligence) and X (scientific and technological intelligence) were each given the rank of resident-not, as elsewhere, deputy resident. Medyanik also had overall supervision of three other residencies, located in the Soviet consulates at Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, In the early 1970s, the KGB presence in India became one of the largest in the world outside the Soviet bloc, Indira Gandhi placed no limit on the number of Soviet diplomats and trade officials, thus allowing the KGB and GRU as many cover positions as they wished. Nor, like many other states, did India object to admitting Soviet intelligence officers who had been expelled by less hospitable regimes. The expansion of KGB operations in the Indian subcontinent (and first and foremost in India) during the early 1970s led the FCD to create a new department. Hitherto operations in India, as in the rest of non-Communist South and South-East Asia, had been the responsibility of the Seventh Department. In 1974 the newly founded Seventeenth Department was given charge of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nOleg Kalugin, who became head of FCD Directorate K (Counter-intelligence) in 1973, remembers India as \'a model of KGB infiltration of a Third World government\': \'We had scores of sources throughout the Indian government-in intelligence, counter-intelligence, the Defense and Foreign Ministries, and the police\'. In Directorate K, whose responsibilities included the penetration of foreign intelligence and security agencies, was running, through Line KR in the Indian residencies, over thirty agents — ten of whom were Indian intelligence officers. Kalugin recalls one occasion on which Andropov personally turned down an offer from an Indian minister to provide information in return for $50,000 on the grounds that the KGB was already well supplied with material from the Indian Foreign and Defense Ministries. It seemed like the entire country was for sale; the KGB-and the CIA-had deeply penetrated the Indian government. After a while neither side entrusted sensitive information to the Indians, realizing their enemy would know all about it the next day.\n\nThe KGB, in Kalugin\'s view, was more successful than the CIA, partly because of its skill in exploiting the corruption which became endemic under Indira Gandhi\'s regime. As Inder Malhotra noted, though corruption was not new in India:\n\nPeople expected Indira Gandhi\'s party, committed to bringing socialism to the country, to be more honest and cleaner than the old undivided Congress, But this turned out to be a vain hope. On the contrary, compared with the amassing of wealth by some of her close associates, the misdeeds of the discarded Syndicate leaders once looked upon as godfathers of corrupt Congressmen, began to appear trivial.\n\nSuitcases full of banknotes were said to be routinely taken to the Prime Minister\'s house. Former Syndicate member S.K. Patil is reported to have said that Mrs. Gandhi did not even return the suitcases.\n\nThe Prime Minister is unlikely to have paid close attention to the dubious origins of some of the funds which went into Congress\'s coffers. That was a matter which she left largely to her principal fundraiser, Lalit Narayan Mishra, who-though she doubtless did not realize it also accepted Soviet money. On at least one occasion a secret gift of 2 million rupees from the Politburo to Congress (R) was personally delivered after midnight by the head of Line PR in New Delhi, Leonid Shebarshin. Another million rupees were given on the same occasion to a newspaper which supported Mrs. Gandhi. Short and obese with several chins, Mishra looked the part of the corrupt politician he increasingly became. Indira Gandhi, despite her own frugal lifestyle, depended on the money he collected from a variety of sources to finance Congress (R). So did her son and anointed heir, Sanjay, whose misguided ambition to build an Indian popular car and become India\'s Henry Ford depended on government favours, When Mishra was assassinated in 1975, Mrs. Gandhi blamed a plot involving \'foreign elements’, a phrase which she doubtless intended as a euphemism for the CIA. The New Delhi main residency gave his widow 70,000 rupees from its active-measures budget. Though there were some complaints from the CPI leadership at the use of Soviet funds to support Mrs. Gandhi and Congress (R), 60 covert funding for the CPI seems to have been unaffected. By 1972 the import-export business founded by the CPI a decade earlier to trade with the Soviet Union had contributed more than 10 million rupees to Party funds. Other secret subsidies, totaling at least 1.5 million rupees, had gone to state Communist parties, individuals and media associated with the CPI. The funds which were sent from Moscow to Party headquarters via the KGB were larger still. In the first six months of 1975 alone they amounted to over 2.5 million rupees.\n\nIn the mid-1970s Soviet funds for the CPI were passed by operations officers of the New Delhi main residency to a senior member of the Party\'s National Council codenamed BANKIR at a number of different locations. The simplest transfers of funds occurred when KGB officers under diplomatic cover had a pretext to visit BANKIR\'s office, such as his briefings for visiting press delegations from the Soviet bloc. Other arrangements, however, were much more complex- One file noted by Mitrokhin records a fishing expedition to a lake not far from Delhi arranged to provide cover for a transfer of funds to BANKIR. Shebarshin and two operations officers from the main residency left the embassy at 6.30 a.m., arrived at about 8 a.m. and spent two and a half hours fishing. At 10.30 a.m. they left the lake and headed to an agreed rendezvous point with BANKIR, making visual contact with his car at 11.15. As the residency car overtook his on a section of the road which could not be observed from either side, packages of banknotes were passed through the open window of BANKlR\'s car. Rajeshwar Rao, general secretary of the CPI from 1964 to 1990, subsequently provided receipts for the sums received. Further substantial sums went to the Communist-Led All-India Congress of Trade Unions, headed by S.A. Dange.\n\nIndia under Indira Gandhi was also probably the arena for more KGB active measures than anywhere else in the world, though their significance appears to have been considerably exaggerated by the Centre, which overestimated its ability to manipulate Indian opinion. According to KGB files, by 1973 it had ten Indian newspapers on its payroll (which cannot be identified for legal reasons) as well as a press agency under its control. During 1972 the KGB claimed to have planted 3,789 articles in Indian newspapers-probably more than in any other country in the non-Communist world. According to its files, the number fell to 2,760 in 1973 but rose to 4,486 in 1974 and 5,510 in 1975.66 In some major NATO countries, despite active-measures campaigns, the KGB was able to plant little more than 1 percent of the articles which it placed in the Indian press.\n\nAmong the KGB\'s leading confidential contacts in the press was one of India\'s most influential journalists, codenamed NOK, Recruited as a confidential contact in 1976 by A.A. Arkhipov, NOK was subsequently handled by two Line PR officers operating under journalistic cover: first A.I. Khachaturian, officially a Trud correspondent, then V.N. Cherepakhin of the Novosti news agency. NOK\'s file records that he published material favorable to the Soviet Union and provided information on the entourage of Indira Gandhi. Contact with him ceased in 1980 as a result of his deteriorating health. Though not apparently aware of the KGB\'s involvement in the active-measures campaign, P.N. Dhar believed that the left was \'manipulating the press... to keep Mrs. Gandhi committed to their ideological line\'. India was also one of the most favorable environments for Soviet front organizations. From 1966 to 1986 the head of the most important of them, the World Peace Council (WPC), was the Indian Communist Romesh Chandra. In his review of the 1960s at the WPC-sponsored World Peace Congress I, Chandra denounced \'the US-dominated NATO\' as \'the greatest threat to peace\' across the world: \'The fangs of NATO can be felt in Asia and Africa as well \\[as Europe\\]… The forces of imperialism and exploitation, particularly NATO... bear the responsibility for the hunger and poverty of hundreds of millions all over the world.\'\n\nThe KGB was also confident of its ability to organize mass demonstrations in Delhi and other major cities. In 1969, for example Andropov informed the Politburo, \'The KGB residency in India has the opportunity to organize a protest demonstration of up to 20,000 Muslims in front of the US embassy in India-The cost of the demonstration would be 5,000 rupees and would be covered in the... budget for special tasks in India. I request consideration\'. Brezhnev wrote \'Agreed\' on Andropov\'s request. In April 1971, two months after Mrs. Gandhi\'s landslide election victory, the Politburo approved the establishment of a secret fund of 1.5 million convertible rubles (codenamed DEPO) to fund active-measures operations in India over the next four years. During that period KGB reports from New Delhi claimed on slender evidence, to have assisted the success of Congress (R) in elections to state assemblies.\n\nAmong the most time-consuming active measures implemented by Leonid Shebarshin as head of Line PR were the preparations for Brezhnev\'s state visit in 1973. As usual it was necessary to ensure that the General Secretary was received with what appeared to be rapturous enthusiasm and to concoct evidence that his platitudinous speeches were hailed as \'major political statements of tremendous importance\'. Since Brezhnev was probably the dreariest orator among the world\'s major statesmen this was no easy task, particularly when he traveled outside the Soviet bloc. Soviet audiences were used to listening respectfully to his long-winded utterances and to bursting into regular, unwarranted applause. Indian audiences, however, lacked the experience of their Soviet counterparts. Brezhnev would have been affronted by any suggestion that he deliver only a short address, since he believed in a direct correlation between the length of a speech and the prestige of the speaker. His open-air speech in the great square in front of Delhi\'s famous Red Fort, where Nehru had declared Indian independence twenty-six years earlier, thus presented a particular challenge. According to possibly inflated KGB estimates, 2 million people were present-perhaps the largest audience to whom Brezhnev had ever spoken. As Shebarshin later acknowledged, the speech was extraordinarily long winded and heavy going. The embassy had made matters even worse by translating the speech into a form of high Hindi which was incomprehensible to most of the audience. As the speech droned on and night began to fall, some of the audience started to drift away but, according to Shebarshin, were turned back by the police for fear of offending the Soviet leader. Though even Brezhnev sensed that not all was well, he was later reassured by the practiced sycophants in his entourage.\n\nShebarshin was able to persuade both himself and the Centre that the visit as a whole had been a great success. The KGB claimed much of the credit for \'creating favorable conditions\' for Brezhnev\'s Indian triumph.\n\nLeonid Shebarshin\'s perceived success in active measures as head of Line PR almost certainly helps to explain his promotion to the post of main resident in 1975 and launched him on a career which in 1988 took him to the leadership of the FCD. In a newspaper interview after his retirement from the KGB, Shebarshin spoke \'nostalgically about the old days, about disinformation- forging documents, creating sensations for the press\'. It was doubtless his days in India which he had chiefly in mind. Among the KGB\'s most successful active measures were those which claimed to expose CIA plots in the subcontinent. The Centre was probably right to claim the credit for persuading Indira Gandhi that the Agency was plotting her overthrow. In November 1973 she told Fidel Castro at a banquet in New Delhi, \'What they \\[the CIA\\] have done to Allende they want to do to me also. There are people here, connected with the same foreign forces that acted in Chile, who would like to eliminate me.\' She did not question Castro\'s (and the KGB\'s) insistence that Allende had been murdered in cold blood by Pinochet\'s US-backed troops. The belief that the Agency had marked her out for the same fate as Allende became something of an obsession. In an obvious reference to (accurate) American claims that, in reality, Allende had turned his gun on himself during the storming of his palace, Mrs. Gandhi declared, \'When I am murdered, they will say I arranged it myself\'.\n\nMrs. Gandhi was also easily persuaded that the CIA, rather than the mistakes of her own administration, was responsible for the growing opposition to her government. Early in 1974 riots in Gujarat, which killed over 100 people, led to 8,000 arrests and caused the dissolution of the State Assembly, reinforced her belief In an American conspiracy against her. Irritated by a series of speeches by Mrs. Gandhi denouncing the ever-present menace of CIA subversion, the US ambassador in New Delhi, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, ordered an investigation which uncovered two occasions during her father\'s premiership when the CIA had secretly provided funds to help the Communists\' opponents in state elections, once in Kerala (money provided to the Christian church for the \'Vimochana Samaram\') and once in West Bengal- According to Moynihan: \n\nBoth times the money was given to the Congress Party which had asked for it-Once it was given to Mrs. Gandhi herself, who was then a party official.\n\nStill, as we were no longer giving any money to her it was understandable that she should wonder to whom we were giving it. It is not a practice to be encouraged.\n\nA brief visit to India by Henry Kissinger in October 1974 provided another opportunity for a KGB active-measures campaign. Agents of influence were given further fabricated stories about CIA conspiracies to report to the Prime Minister and other leading figures in the government and parliament. The KGB claimed to have planted over seventy stories in the Indian press condemning CIA subversion as well as initiating letter-writing and poster campaigns. The Delhi main residency claimed that, thanks to its campaign, Mrs. Gandhi had raised the question of CIA operations in India during her talks with Kissinger.\n\nOn 28 April 1975 Andropov approved a further Indian active-measures operation to publicize fabricated evidence of CIA subversion. Sixteen packets containing incriminating material prepared by Service A on three CIA officers stationed under diplomatic cover at the US embassy were sent anonymously by the Delhi residency to the media and gave rise to a series of articles in the Indian press. According to KGB files, Mrs. Gandhi sent a personal letter to the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, enclosing some of the KGB\'s forged CIA documents and a series of articles in Indian newspapers which had been taken in by them. The same files report that Mrs. Bandaranaike concluded that CIA subversion posed such a serious threat to Sri Lanka that she set up a committee of investigation.\n\nOne of Mrs. Gandhi\'s critics, Piloo Moody, ridiculed her obsession with CIA subversion by wearing around his neck a medallion with the slogan, \'I am a CIA agent\'. For Mrs. Gandhi, however, the Agency was no laughing matter. By the summer of 1975 her suspicions of a vast conspiracy by her political opponents, aided and abetted by the CIA, had, in the opinion of her biographer Katherine Frank, grown to \'something close to paranoia\'. Her mood was further darkened on 12 June by a decision of the Allahabad High Court, against which she appealed, invalidating her election as MP on the grounds of irregularities in the 1971 elections. A fortnight later she persuaded both the President and the cabinet to agree to the declaration of a state of emergency.  \n\n(to be continued)'<br />Author: 'TheInsaneM'<br />id: 'fg0s7j'<br />Flair :Research</li>

<li>Title: 'A LONG-FORM dialogue on understanding the Left mindset that I think will help those feeling helpless against the demonization of Hindus in the international press and in understanding why the Indian left media acts the way it does.'<br />Body: ' \n\nCredit:- [u/stushevatsya46](https://www.reddit.com/user/stushevatsya46/)\n\nOriginally posted on Indiaspeaks\n\nThis post got lost, didn\'t get visibility, so posting it here, already intimated oc 3 days back.\n\nA request for you to read it till the end.\n\nHello everyone. Over the past few days I as well as others have been thoroughly disturbed by what has been going on. The way the leftist media has been selectively presenting facts, committing errors of omission, often straight out lying to construct their narratives to ruin India\'s image internationally, and to break down the morale of the people who support the constitutional changes taking place in the country currently. Upon seeing these lies peddled by the media, a family member during a call with me, asked indignantly, "Ye log jhoont kyun dikha rahe hain? Inhe pata nahin ki asliyat kya hai, ya jhoont bolte hain? tum bade shahr mein rehte ho, tumhein pata hoga?"\n\nAs a conservative, up until now I\'d been focusing solely studying the philosophy of the right. So basic economics, Thomas Sowell, Karl Popper, Paul Johnson, and other important scholars of the right. Only recently did I out of curiosity started studying a little bit of the left, and I have to say, while their ends might be wrong, the means they\'re employing are quite effective. Admittedly, my knowledge of the left is very basic. But for what it is worth, here it goes. I\'ll put it down in dialogue form. Hope you find it informative.\n\nP.S. - After I started writing, I just kept on, and the post grew to this length. I\'m grateful that this subreddit helped me articulate my views.\n\n**Why does the left-wing media not see that the riot was both-sided? That both Hindus and Muslims participated in it, and that there was advanced planning on part of the Muslims too? Why is it still trying to portray the Muslims as a victim minority group, when it so obviously a lot better organized and being around 15% of the country, and making up 24% of the world, is a global majority compared to the Hindus?**\n\nBecause the left is not interested in the question of who is being unfair to whom. It is not a question of whether Hindus are oppressing the Muslims, or the other way around. These are pretenses to dupe the people into believing that they advocate for "minority rights" and "open borders" out of compassion and humanistic intentions. Their real objective is something else.\n\n**What is it?**\n\nSome kind of internationalism. An order where the sovereignty of the individual nations is severely compromised and a top-down international government has a say in every little thing national entities do[i](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote1sym). A society where all fault-lines based on religion, ethnicity, etc. disappear and only one division remains: the one based on class and class-consciousness.\n\n**I\'m somewhat aware of these terms. What you\'re saying sounds like Marxism. But as far as I know, Marxism failed in the Soviet Union catastrophically, so why would they try to do it again in India? And isn\'t this a conspiracy theory?**\n\nIt sounds like a conspiracy theory, yes, to people who have not been acquainted with this philosophy. It is not. Look, theories seem probable only in light of other knowledge that a person already has in their mind. Think about the idea of the sun moving around the earth. The idea would sound ridiculous to someone who\'s not familiar with the notion of gravity, and the model of the solar system. If you were to tell a ninth-century Indian about this notion, they\'d probably balk at you and call you crazy. I\'m not saying what I\'m stating is a scientific theory, but this is just to say that certain ideas seem senseless until you get a sense of the background propositions, the knowledge *in the light of which* the idea makes sense.\n\n**Okay, what you\'re saying seems** ***bakwaas***, **but fine, what\'s the "background knowledge"?**\n\nIt\'ll take a bit of time. You\'ll have to bear with me. And it\'ll seem to have no bearing upon the present situation, till the very end. Are you up for continuing this conversation?\n\n**Sure, I have time. Go ahead.**\n\nOkay, so here we go. You\'re aware that soon after the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815, this guy Karl Marx was born. He was an almost-exact contemporary of Darwin, and from the middle of the 19th century onwards he wrote several tracts on the ideology of communism alongside another guy called Engels. So we have *The Communist Manifesto* and *Das Capital*, and a huge bunch of compiled writings, including essays on India.\n\n**Yes, yes. The idea that the bourgeoisie groups together as a class and controls the means of production, i.e. the big factories, and uses economic coercion and the power of the state to force the proleteriat -- the poor industrial workers -- into toeing their line. I know that this idea created havoc in Europe soon after, and reached its apogee with the October Revolution of 1917 in Russia, when the Bolsheviks headed by Lenin came to power. It quickly turned into a state of oppression, and under Stalin the state turned into a machinery of terror and the ego-maniac killed hundreds of thousands of the citizens. The state survived for the next forty years or so and finally disintegrated into fifteen repubic states around 1990. It\'s often joked about since. What\'s the catch?**\n\nThe catch is that what we know of and what we criticize is merely Soviet Marxism. Soviet Marxism is just one type of Marxism among several others, and often when we criticize the same, we criticize its economic aspects and Marxists laugh at us because that\'s not even the kind of Marxism they\'re aiming for in the present. There are other schools of Marxism flourishing in the democratic world that a lot of us are unaware of. This is specially true for the India, where most of the people as it is are ignorant of political ideologies -- “*Are bhaiya kya hai ye left and right? Ham to insaaniyat dekhte hain ...*”\n\n**Okay, go ahead. Tell me about those schools.**\n\nLook, when we criticize Marxism for its faulty economics we criticize classical Marxism, Marxism as it was penned down by the originators Marx and Engels. When we critize Marxism for its turning into a reign of terror, we mostly mean the Stalinist regime and Soviet Russia. What we completely ignore is **Western Marxism**. The Marxism that emerged in the Western European countries as Eastern European countries fell under the Soviet spell in the 1917-1923 revolutions following the October Revolution. Think about the progression of Marxist philosophy like this: Classical Marxism --&gt; Leninism --&gt; Leninism-Stalinism --&gt; Western Marxism.\n\n**What\'s Western Marxism? How\'s it different from other forms? And this better have a bearing on India pretty soon.**\n\nBear with me. In a very rough way, I can put it this way. In the inter-war period, between 1919 when WWI ends and 1939 when WWII begins, Marxism went a series of crises.\n\nFirst, the Soviet revolutions took place only in the eastern european countries, the Balkans and the Central Asian countries, etc. In the western european countries, countries like England, France, Germany, Italy, communist revolutions failed and were repressed thoroughly by the state. Why? In Germany and Italy, the ideology of fascism took root. England had a strong democratic and classical liberal tradition, and France already had ideas of liberty and social democracy engrained into it by the French Revolution. In summary, Marxism failed to take root in the western europe. This was ironic, since these were the countries where the population of the industrial workers was the greatest. The eastern european countries didn\'t have much industry, and so minimal industrial workers which constitute the proleteriat, and revolutions there, contrary to what Marx had anticipated, were won on the basis of the peasants.\n\nSecondly, after the death of Lenin in 1924, Stalin came to power, and immediately turned the state into a dictatorship. Marxist political and economic philosophy, which until then was being constantly added to by a variety of thinkers, was suddenly strangled. People either were members of the official communist party, and strictly and silently observed its diktat, or they were exiled or killed. This brought an end to innovative Marxist philosophy in Eastern Europe.\n\nAnd so the epicentre of Marxist philosophy shifted to western europe, where it had failed. Communists either were imprisoned, exiled, or concealed their affiliation and worked in secrecy.\n\nThe biggest question before these Marxists: why did we fail in the west? What happened? Why does the working class not organize together and get up in arms against their oppressors and overthrow the state? Why do they still vote and feel proud about their countries? Why do they love a nation that exploits them? Marxist philosophy had asserted so much, and much of what happened was contrary to its expectations. Marxists needed to get back to the drawing board. Analyze what happened. Amend their philosophy to explain their failure.[ii](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote2sym)\n\n**Interesting. So how did the Western Marxists alter their philosophy?**\n\nIn Italy, Mussolini came to power in the early 1920s, and immediately started using the state appratus against the PCI, the Communist Party of Italy. This party was headed by a guy called **Antonio Gramsci** (1891-1937), a small, physically-weak clever dude who would later change the course of Marxism as it is practiced today. This guy was put behind bars in 1926, where he, like Hitler, Nehru, Savarkar, Mandela, and many other political leaders, had time to meditate on his politics and write about it.\n\nWestern Marxism in its fundamentals is a progression of what Gramsi\'s thought as it was conceived in the Italian prison. He challenged certain fundamental propositions regarding the how the state achieves power: most importantly, he challenged the **dominance account of power**: the idea which asserts that the state obtains and maintains power by *force* and *economic coercion,* that is, that the state beats people down or blackmail people economically to hold on to power. This was a commonly-accepted notion amongst Marxists of that era, and one that blew back into their faces, since quite embarassingly, the “working class” liked their state, a lot of them being fiercely nationalistic, and didn\'t pay attention to the communist call for revolution in Western Europe.\n\n**But is it not true? The state does dominate. Look at China, look at Tianeman square, look at the south american countries, how they brutally beat down on protests using state power. How else does the state rule?**\n\nYou must understand the basic problem that Antonio Gramsci is fighting with, which, simply put is: *why are the people in democratic (and fascist) nations not responding to the Marxist call for revolution? Why do they love their countries so much? Why are they patriotic, and enroll in armies and sing national anthems with heartfelt pride for states that – according to the Marxists – are all about exploiting them?*\n\nThat the state rules by force is true, but according to Gramsci, it is only part of the whole truth. Clearly, the British weren\'t suppressing communist revolts by the dozens using arms. The communist revolts weren\'t happening in the first place because people didn\'t have that much of a problem with the government. They had disagreements, they had grievances, sometimes grave, but they didn\'t despise the government like the Marxists hoped they would.\n\n**I see. So what did Gramsci propose?**\n\nHe divided the factors of state power into two. The state rules by two methods: by maintaining **coercion** and **consent.**\n\nWhat is coercion? Simply put, coercion is the use of force and economic sanction on part of the government to maintain power. Shutting down farmers\' protest in countryside Maharashtra by a lathi-charge? Coercion. Prosecuting you for seditious content and putting you in prison? Coercion. Firing you from your govt. job if you criticize a policy? Coercion. The state applies coercion by the use of what he termed the **political society**, which is constituted by the armed forces, the police, the judiciary, and so on. This much was known to the Marxists of his day.\n\nConsent, is an innovative – and very subversive – idea on Gramsci\'s part. It influences all modern thought on Marxism in the democratic countries today. Basically, consent , as conceived by Gramsci is the willingness of the citizens – the working class, mostly, but others as well – to *willingly be party to their exploitation by the state.* People fall in love with the state. They develop feelings of patriotism towards the state. They become loyal, fiercely so. How does the state do this? By something Gramsci called **political hegemony**\\*\\*\\*.\\*\\*\\* Here is political hegemony defined:\n\n“*the domination of a culturally diverse society by the ruling class who manipulate the culture of that society so that the ruling-class worldview becomes the accepted cultural norm, the universally valid dominant ideology, which justifies the social, political, and economic status quo as natural and inevitable, perpetual and beneficial for every social class, rather than as artificial social constructs that benefit only the ruling class.*”[iii](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote3sym)\n\nBasically, a large group of upper-to-middle-class people who subtly control the state come together and propagandize an ideology that justifies the suffering of the working/lower class by using democratic, religious, nationalistic, ethnic, linguistic, or any other means. The oppressed people are deceived into believing it, and don\'t revolt, instead consenting to the alleged oppression. Consent is generated through what Gramsci called the **civil society,** which are “the cultural institutions and practices that appear to be independent of politics, but in fact are not.*”* So television, religious festivals, the republic day parade, the daily national anthem at school, the Sanskrit language, all of that is propaganda on part of the state to get your consent.\n\n**Damn, that\'s ... interesting**.\n\nSounds strangely convicing, no? It seems to explain so much you see around you.\n\n**It kinda does, yeah. So ... if we relate this to India, then ...?**\n\nYes, so take the Bhagavad Gita. According to the Western Marxists, the philosophy of Bhagavad Gita is simply a bourgeois ideology used by the Brahmins to maintain hegemony, or power, over the other castes. “Devote yourself entirely to me, and thinking every action of yours a sacrifice, O Arjuna, perform your *dharma.”* An ideologue of Gramsci\'s thought might say that this is just a Brahmin ploy to maintain a social order that favours them. “Do your duty, don\'t concern yourself with questions of right and wrong, don\'t worry about all of those philosophical problems, go and kill your brothers.” And of course, if a Dalit reads the Gita, the message that he is supposed to glean from it is, “Do your duty, even if it is cleaning after other people\'s excreta.”\n\nNow, of course, such a convenient analysis straw-mans the Gita, and ignores all the sublimity of the scripture. It ignores the fact that this idea of surrendering your will to God is not a hegemonic ploy uniquely attributable to the Hindu scripture, but a constant motif of ancient philosophical thought. Stoicism, for instance, a mostly secular sect of Greece and hellenestic Rome, suggests surrendering your will to the Gods, and performing what is under your control, and leaving everything else to nature. It\'s a doctrine that, among other things, aims to remove the doubts and fears that curtail our action when we are too attached to victory or loss to really do what needs to be done, to actually try our best to achieve our objective. God, or Gods, can be read here to mean that part of nature that is beyond your control, that even with all our knowledge of science, is still beyond our grasp. Krishna\'s idea is not to hegemonize Arjuna, but to point out the existential rationalizations Arjuna is engaging in to justify his unwillingness to fight because he\'s too attached to his brothers, even when *they\'re exploting him*.\n\nBut if you will find exploitation in everything if that is only what you look for. This is not to deny that religious authorities have justified exploitation by referring to Gods, but to say that that is not the gist of all *sanskriti*. *Sanskriti* would by its nature – because it is a reflection of the society -- incorporate elements of all aspects of the society, from the depths of depravity to the heights of sublimity, and you will find in it what you look for. The idea is to look at --\n\n**But you digress. This is not a discussion about the value of tradition. Let\'s perhaps stick to Western Marxism.**\n\nYes, right. The point is, a Gramscian theorist would see attempt at exploitative propaganda in all forms of culture and political ideology. The idea of Britain, its literature, its nationalism, its protestant religious identity, its pride, its democratic traditions all the way from Magna Carta to the modern times, is seen as a popular disguise, to feed false satisfaction into the people so that they do not revolt.\n\nMoreover, identities of nation, religion, language, etc. disable people from marching to the beat of the drum of class-consciousness. If I\'m an industrial worker and you\'re an industrial worker, but I\'m Hindu and you\'re Muslim, or you speak Tamil and I speak Urdu, and we\'re particularly proud of these idenities, we\'re less likely to unite as a class to fight against the “bourgeoisie.”\n\n**And so you\'re saying that the idea of India, its ancient civilization, its philosophy, its Hindu cultural identity, is thought by western marxists a kind of propaganda to generate consent to oppress the lower classes by the Brahmins?**\n\nYes, something like that. That is why they deride everything that remotely relates to the Hindu tradition. The Indians Gods are taboo-ed, caste-strife is exaggerated, the Hindu religious identity is stigmatized. Hell, Kalidasa\'s poetry and drama, which is one of the best works of literature ever produced, is barely mentioned by the intellectuals. We barely are aware of the achievements of our civilization. All this, because they think its a hegemonic ploy by the upper-classes to rule the state. Thus you have NDTV ridiculing the search for the Saraswati river – which is a perfectly genuine historical inquiry – and P.K. ridiculing Lord Shiva, and a Barkha Dutt and a Rajdeep Sardesai making fun of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam for saying something favourable to the idea of India, and other innumerable instances like that.\n\n**But why that doesn\'t explain why the left is so lenient towards Islam. After all, if religion is a hegemonic strategy, then Islam ought to be considered one of the most oppressive hegemonic ideologies there are. Why is that not stigmatised?**\n\nSeveral reasons. The most important being this:\n\nIndia, in the near future at least, is liable to nationalism founded on the Hindu identity. Nationalism, just like religion, is anathema to Marxism, since nationalism is precisely what led to its failure in western europe. By pointing repeatedly to the historic faults of Hinduism, sometimes real, but mostly imagined, the idea is to break down any possibility of national pride, so that India remains susceptible to increasing Marxist order. Hindu stigma is very important for the left in India, since it is the only thing that stands between them and nationalism. Once the Hindus really come into their own, learning of their past, learning of the crimes that have been committed upon them, the fierce pride and anger will likely obliterate the marxist left-wing.\n\n**Yes, but why not criticize Islam equally?**\n\nBecause there is no threat of Muslim nationalism in India in the near future. At the most, if the demographic ratio shifts against the Hindus, it will eliminate the possibility of Hindu nationalism within current Indian borders. Since nationalism is based on historical memory[iv](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote4sym), and what is a matter of pride to Muslims is a matter of embarassment to Hindus and vice versa, you can be sure that a skewed demographic ratio will remove the possibility of any nationalism altogether. What, then, will remain? Either a weak state maintaining the present borders, in which case it will increasingly look to an outside, international government to conduct its affairs, or it will disintegrate into a number of non-cooperating states that will individually be too weak for their respective nationalisms to pose any threat to a globalist left-wing order.\n\nThis is also partly why a blind eye is turned to the excesses of Islam committed by the immigrants in the Western countries as well. The greater the proportion of people in your nation-state that don\'t share the common historical memories vital for national pride, the weaker the state becomes, and the more susceptible to global intervention. That is one reason why anti-immigration laws are so vehemently opposed by the left.\n\nHere is another critical idea by the Gramsci that explains the blindness of the left towards Islam\'s excesses. Gramsci, in proposing a solution to dealing the cultural hegemony of the ruling class, proposed the idea of the **working-class hegemony.** This is a political and cultural alliance led by the marxism intellectuals, of course, and composed of what he termed ***subalterns***, i.e. All those groups that are not part of or loosely part of the dominant hegemony. So, in the Indian context, this would mean trying to recruit first and foremost the Muslims, then – constantly failing to, but still trying – the scheduled castes, the Kashmiris, and so on. This also includes subversive acts such as trying to promote Sikh separatism, getting it to clash with the state, and then recruiting it into the working-class hegemony.\n\nWith regards to Islam, the following tenet of Gramsci\'s thought is the most pertinent: “to genuinely represent the subalterns the working class hegemony has to take seriously their practices and values, *even if they\'re not progressive”*[*v*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote5sym). This, in the Indian context means that, in order to suppress the **dominant ideology** which is the Hindu tradition, Islam has to be accepted by the left with all its anti-progressive elements: the intolerance, the terrorism, the expansionism, the archaic codes for women, and so on. This, simply because, in India, Islam is the biggest member of the alliance of the working-class hegemony.\n\n**I see. But clearly, Islam is not susceptible to the Marxist ideology. It aims for an order derived from the sharia, not from Marxism. To what extent then is this alliance compatible?**\n\nIn their ideologies they are antithetical. Islam as it currently stands, and as it is likely to stand in the future, will never accept the Marxist ideology. Both Islam and modern Marxism are fundamentally non-nationalist, imperialist orders (even though for expedience they subscribe temporarily to these orders). Marxism strives for an internationalist order based on class-consciousness and rule of the proletariat, while Islam looks to extend the sphere of influence of the *ummah*, the global Muslim community, by whatever pragmatic means possible, even if it is nationalism[vi](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote6sym). On the world scale, they\'re competitors rather than allies. But, in terms of the short-term goals they want to achieve, i.e. the defeat of nationalism (that co-incidentally, is based on Hindu historical identity in India), they form a perfect alliance serving mutual interests. In European countries, you will historically see political organizations suffixed “Popular Front”, which is generally an alliance of all left-wing parties within a country. The left-liberal-islamic nexus is just that suited to the Indian sociopolitical climate.\n\n**I understand your point. I see how this alliance might work. But still it seems a bit unreasonable to suggest that all the students on the road, protesting in the universities, all the media personnel, the newspapers, the magazines, would do all of what you describe with such calculated intention. Maybe they really are just coming from a place of humanistic concern.**\n\nI agree. But here you must pay attention to a crucial analogy: there are foot-soldiers in a battle, and then there are the generals, above them is the head-of-state, and often propping his or her power is the public. The reason why the solider fights is not the same reason the general fights, and that is not the same reason why the head-of-state goes to war, and the reason the public supports or condemns the battle might yet be different. The head-of-state might have a personal interest, the general might be fighting for glory, the soldier for duty, and the public might be supporting the war because of perceived or real injustice on part of the adversary.\n\nIt is the same with any ideology. The academicians, the professors of Marxism deeply versed in the Gramscian and other Marxist thought, the media figureheads who\'ve sprung from the universities where this thought is taught, might be promulgating their ideology with complete awareness of what they are doing. Some of the people studying it might also be aware. But the bulk of the public perhaps is fighting because it does not know. It has had it drilled into its head the values of “minority protection” and “Hindutva fascism” and “constitutional values” -- which, by the way, they simply use to flout legal precedents and launch into judicial activism – and the public might just be fighting now out of a sense of perceived injustice that they think the Hindus are inflicting on imaginary targets. That, and that the penetration of Marxist values into the cultural domain – the civil society, to use Gramsci\'s terminology – has ensured that such protestations are considered cool and righteous.\n\n**Also, Gramsci died in the early 1930s, what makes you say that his ideology is still active currently?**\n\nI\'ll name you some ideological currents that derive heavily from his thought, and have moved much farther in terms of their sophistication and competence at weakening nationalisms. Admittedly I\'m only sufficiently-versed with Gramsci\'s thought, having not read with much depth the other schools. But they are:\n\nThe **Frankfurt School**. First Marxist school to be set up in a democratic society, in Germany. Horkheimer, Adorno, and Marcuse are its primary figures. This school came up with the subject of **critical theory**, which is a euphemism for an “ideological effort of representatives of Frankfurt School to challenge all previously accepted standards in every aspect of societal life from a Marxist perspective.”[vii](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote7sym) Critical theory is a mandatory course in English Literature deparments, and also History departments lately.\n\nRudi Dutschke and his slogan “long march through the institutions,” which was his notion of subverting society by infilitrating academia, beauracracy, media, and so on over a long period of time. This started happening in the 60s and 70s, and has now reached the zenith, with the left-wing inside all prominent institutions that are responsible for maintaining civil society.\n\nIn India, I can recall a few instances off the top of my head. The Subaltern school of history (which has, admittedly, had some credible historians too), of which Sudipto Kaviraj is a prominent figure, is influenced by Gramscian Marxism. Kaviraj believes that the idea of India was created in the 19th century with the British colonial state (conveniently forgetting Arrian, Megasthenes, Al-Biruni, and so many other ancient sources that define India as a definite geographical and cultural entity). Yogendra Yadav is a disciple of his. Then of course you have the journalist nexus, which I\'m sure I don\'t need to spell out.\n\n**So to come back to the initial point ...**\n\nTo come back to the initial point, which started this conversation. The reason that the left is omitting the crimes against Hindus and portraying the Hindus as evil in their narrative does not come out of misunderstanding, or a lack of knowledge on their part (“Maybe they just don\'t know what is happening. Maybe because they live in their ivory towers they\'re not acquainted with reality. If only they come to hinterland, to the towns in the lives of the common people, they would understand ...”). Nope, this is part of well-thought-out ideology that has been institutionalized all over the world, with added verve in the democratic countries.\n\nIndian nationalism will have to fight a strong pitched battle against it. The media will not cover your riots for you. It will not cover both sides. It is biased, certainly, but who are you complaining of the bias to? Objectivity is merely a front, behind which is a left-wing agenda being worked at with tremendous intensity. It is sad that most foot-soldiers of the left-wing might not even be aware of the ideology they\'re promoting, but they\'re doing it nonetheless, and have to be equally be countered.\n\n**And how do you propose Indians stand their defenses against it?**\n\nAs with all battles, it starts with recognizing the enemy. People generally think of Islamism as the threat. I do not deny it. But Islamism is a visible threat, it is something that is so obvious you can\'t help but respond against it. Left-wing subversion is something that is a lot more devious. It\'s hazy, concealed, garbed in the costumes of secularism and superior humanistic morality, and unless you\'re educated in the subject, you can\'t even point to where and how it is taking place.\n\nWhat is fortunate, however, is that the model for social analysis that the left has figured out are not exclusive to it. Gramsci\'s thought, stripped of its prescriptive values and used solely for its general model of the society, can just as well be put to serve the nationalist objective. The left, using these models, has been successful in reaching the top echelons of the civil society. There is no reason why the right can\'t use it to further their objectives.\n\nOne *can* use the concepts of consent, hegemony, dominant ideology, and so on to see where we\'re at. The left has been very successful in manufacturing consent [viii](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote8sym) of the college students, and they\'ve done it by manipulating the civil society: by infiltrating culture, the movies, the books, the newspapers. Once we\'re sensitive to it, we can issue a counter-propaganda campaign. One can and should borrow from one\'s foes that which can use to one\'s own advantage.\n\nOther than that, I do not know. I am yet to study the rules of political organization and agitation (which again, I will learn from the Marxists, and who\'ve specialized in this area for over a century and a half now; and also, Islam with its centralized mosque-maulvi-fatwa network [ix](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote9sym)). Indians are clearly bad at political organization, and this reflects itself not only in the civil society – compare what a weak crowd we\'ve been able to muster in favour of the CAA to how many people actually support it, the supporters-to-demonstrators ratio is pathetic – but also in the political diplomatic scenario (see, our failure to negotiate to our advantage in the Kashmir dispute)[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote10sym) Self-education helps.\n\nAnd that\'s about it.

My response to a recent post on r/India.'<br />Body: 'Note: I have changed the title of the original post because OP forgot to address the great Maratha king Sambhaji with the title "Maharaj".\n\nHere is the link to the original post - [Click Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fe44tj/sanghees_claiming_sambhajee_gave_nightmares_to/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)\n\nAs a self-respecting Hindu and a Maratha, I could not help myself but write this response but since I am banned from [r/India](https://np.reddit.com/r/India/) just like the rest of you (thanks to its gay mods), I\'m writing it here.\n\nTo the OP ([u/ShortTesla\\_Rekt5](https://np.reddit.com/u/ShortTesla_Rekt5/)), since you cherry picked only a particular part from History to insult Sambhaji Maharaj, I feel it is my duty to educate you about the whole story. Please read this entire post carefully.\n\nAfter the unfortunate demise of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in 1680, the Maratha empire faced a great challenge. The Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb had been confounded and **defeated** by the repeated battles with the Marathas and the high spirit of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. With the forces of fanaticism released throughout South Asia and to sustain himself, the aged emperor leaned ever heavier on the clerics and upon religious exclusivism. The king of the Marathas with his slaying of the Afghan war leader, Afzal Khan, the daring attack on Shaista Khan and the escape from the very depths of the Mughal Empire in Delhi, were the stuff of legend in the lifetime of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj himself. The deaths of the great Rajput Chiefs, Jai Singh and Jaswant Singh around the same time seemed to open the floodgates of repression and extremism even further. Orders were issued to demolish the Hindu temples and impose the hated poll tax on non-Muslims – the *Jizya*.\n\nAs the empire groaned in its agony, resistance began to multiply and leading to further repressions. The Bundelas in central India began fighting; the Jats of the Mathura region and the Rajput clans of the Rathores and Sisodiyas in Rajasthan even leading to a son of Aurangzeb named Akbar to join the Rajput’s. In fury, the enraged Emperor led the main imperial army to crush his son and his erstwhile rebellion.\n\nFurther south, the Mughals believed that the Marathas would be unable to repeat their exploits under the son of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj (Sambhaji Maharaj), thinking that the sustenance of this new Hindu kingdom rested on one able man alone. Like so many other rebellions in that period, he thought that the Maratha movement too must have received its death-blow with the passing of its able leader, and by the fact that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had been succeeded by son, Sambhaji Maharaj. Sambhaji Maharaj had the courage, which he indeed demonstrated on various occasions, but also indulged in excesses, leading his father on occasions, forced to consider a severe punishment for his own son. Sambhaji Maharaj in his rage left and joined the Mughals. This was an intensely painful time in Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj\'s life. Sambhaji Maharaj left the Mughals when he witnessed first-hand the atrocities against Hindus.\n\nShambaji Maharaj offered refuge to Akbar and in 1682, the lost son of Aurangzeb escorted by the Rajputs, arrived safely in Maharashtra. Close behind the Emperor entered the Maratha Kingdom in the same year. Few would have guessed that he would never return after spending the last 27 years of his life in a **futile** and eventually **failed war** with the Hindus.\n\nThe war was engaged and raged from this period onwards in a steady ebb and flow in the hills of western India with neither side able to emerge over the other. The steady courage of Sambhaji Maharaj was only matched by his impetuous and rash nature. Only his minister, Kavi Kalash, was able to exercise any control over the headstrong king. An equal measure of the rage of Sambhaji Maharaj was directed towards any perceived rivals or dissenters in his kingdom and he dealt with the same with extreme severity and with all the rage for which he was justly famous.\n\nBlood flowed over the mountains and the land was ruined but the people fought on. The full force of the empire was now borne down on the barren hills, and the prime generals and troops of the Mughals all now began to unravel. For seven years more, that war continued with its monotonous tale of attack and counter-attack. Of determined sieges of forts by the Mughals, only to be retaken months later by the equally determined sieges of forts by the Marathas and this cycle of destruction continued.\n\nIn the Battle of Wai in the year 1687, the Maratha forces were hit hard by the Mughal army. The army General and staunch Shivaji Maharaj\'s loyalist Hambirao Mohite was killed. The troops had started to desert the Maratha army. Sambhaji Maharaj himself was under scrutiny by his own relatives, the Shirke family. Shirke had defected to the Mughals. Finally, as a result of this betrayal, Sambhaji Maharaj was captured by the Mughal forces of Muqarrab Khan along with 25 of his loyalists. This happened in the battle at Sangameshwar in February 1689.\n\nIn 1689, the Maratha king was at Sangameshwar unaware of the nearness of his enemies and with an inadequate force around him. After a sudden raid under Muqarrab Khan, a Mughal force reached the place and after a bitter fight, succeeded in capturing Sambhaji Maharaj and Kavi Kalash.\n\nAfter the capture of Sambhaji Maharaj and Kavi Kalash, they were taken to Bahadurgad. This is the same place as the present day Ahmednagar. At this location, Aurangzeb grossly humiliated them. He was paraded by making them wear clown\'s clothes. They were subjected to insults by Mughal soldiers.\n\nSambhaji Maharaj was asked to surrender his forts which he had recaptured from the Mughals. He was asked to return all his loot which he had looted in his battles with Mughals. Most importantly, he was asked to reveal the names of the conspirators from within the Mughal army who had collaborated with Sambhaji Maharaj. Bravely, Sambhaji Maharaj refused to divulge the names of his collaborators and also rejected the other demands of the Emperor. As a strong response and in a fit of anger, he insulted the Prophet Muhammad and the Emperor. As a result of this, and for having killed Muslims, he was given the death sentence as per Islamic law.\n\nSambhaji Maharaj was asked to bow down before the Emperor. He refused. He was also offered to get converted to Islam in return for the Emperor’s favor of less harsh punishment. This was also rejected by Sambhaji Maharaj.\n\nFor his adherence to the Hindu Dharma, the people named him **‘Dharamveer’ the warrior of Dharma**.\n\nHe and Kavi Kalash were tortured for over a fortnight. His eyes were gouged out and tongue was cut. His nails were pulled out. Skin was removed. He was finally killed on 11th March 1689.\n\nHe was torn apart from the front and back with tiger claws (*wagh nakhe* – same arms with which Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj killed Afzal Khan).\n\nFinally, he was beheaded with an axe at Tulapur on the banks of Bhima river near Pune.\n\nHis body was cut into pieces. It was thrown in the river. Some body parts were recovered by the villagers and cremated at the confluence of rivers of Tulapur.\n\nHis head was cut off and placed in public display around the cities and towns of Maharashtra as a warning. But it did not have the desired effect.\n\nThere were many people who did not like Sambhaji Maharaj and thus, were sympathetic to the Mughals. But this barbaric treatment made everyone angry. Maratha generals gathered on Raigad. The decision was unanimous. All peace offers were to be withdrawn. Mughals had to be repelled at all costs. Rajaram Bhosle I (younger son of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, and half-brother of Sambhaji Maharaj), succeeded as the next king. He began his reign by a valiant speech on Raigad. All Maratha generals and councilmen united under the flag of a new king, and thus began the second phase of the epic war.\n\nIn the moment of his apparent triumph, Aurangzeb was beset by an even greater tide of enemies. The Marathas under their warbands and leaders took to fight all over the western and southern parts of India from coast to coast. Their soldiers everywhere continually harried and fought the Mughals in an even greater tidal wave of resistance. The harried and worn out emperor continued to fight in the face of ever increasing odds. The people of the north of India began to rise in rebellions and struggles which eventually lead to the destruction of the Mughals. For 27 long years, Aurangzeb continued with his fight against the Marathas only to die in despair in 1707.\n\nAlone, lost, depressed, bankrupt, and far away from home, he died a sad death on 3rd March 1707. “I hope God will forgive me one day for my disastrous sins”, were his last words.\n\nThe son of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had redeemed the pledge of his father of Hindu Padshahi – His heroic death led to the eventual victory over the forces and the Maratha Hindu empire rose on the ruins of the Mughals and a hundred years after the execution of Sambhaji Maharaj, a defeated and blinded Mughal Padshah, Shah Alam fell at the feet and mercy of the Maratha warrior and kingmaker Mahadaji Shinde.\n\n**Thus ended a prolonged and grueling period in the history of India. The Mughal kingdom fragmented and disintegrated soon after. And Deccan saw the rise of a new sun, the Maratha empire.**\n\n”What some call the Muslim period in Indian history, was, in reality, a continuous war of occupiers against resisters, in which the Muslim rulers were finally defeated in the 18th century” *-* Dr. Koenraad Elst\n\nThe remarkable things that Sambhaji Maharaj achieved in his short life had far reaching effects on the whole of India. Every Hindu should be grateful to him for that. He valiantly faced the 8 lakh strong army of Aurangzeb and defeated several Mughal chieftains on the battlefield forcing them to retreat. Because of this, Aurangzeb remained engaged in battles in Maharashtra, thus keeping the rest of India free from Aurangzeb’s tyranny for a long time. This can be considered as the greatest achievement of Sambhaji Maharaj. If Sambhaji Maharaj would have arrived at a settlement with Aurangzeb and accepted his proposal of being a tributary prince, then within the next 2 or 3 years Aurangzeb would have captured North India again. However, because of Sambhaji Maharaj and other Maratha ruler’s (Rajaram and Maharani Tarabai) struggle, Aurangzeb was stuck in battles in South India for 27 years. This helped in the establishment of new Hindu kingdoms in the provinces of Bundelkhand, Punjab, and Rajasthan in North India; thus providing safety to the Hindu society there.\n\nWhy didn\'t Aurangzeb achieve victory against the Maratha empire?\n\nBecause Aurangzeb wanted to win the war against Marathas. But Marathas were fighting for their freedom. It is super hard for an occupying force to win a war against the resisting militias.\n\nThough Aurangzeb\'s men were well equipped and well fed, they weren\'t motivated as the Marathas were. A well motivated army with a firm leader can beat a force with technical and numerical superiority if the superior force doesn\'t strategize well. The Mughal soldiers were fighting the war because that paid their salary. But the Marathas were fighting for freedom, to escape tyranny, to live the life the way they wanted to live without paying *Jizya* and to be independent of Muslim rulers like Mughals and Adil Shahis.\n\n**An important message for everyone who is reading this.**\n\nThe main motive behind such rubbish posts which we see often on [r/India](https://np.reddit.com/r/India/) is to defame our heroes and demoralize us by twisting the facts and portraying our idols as weak. This same strategy was used by the Congress to keep the Hindus in check by emphasizing on history written by Marxists which antagonized Hindu nationalists like Veer Savarkar and others. It is a perfect example of psychological warfare. A civilization only survives as long as people take pride in it and this is exactly what these people are trying to do - to strip us off of our pride.

<li>Title: 'Why Hindus were given the disputed site at Aayodhya?(My Take)'<br />Body: "1. Faiths of many Hindus that Ram was born there and Right to worship was guaranteed by the constitution in the preamble as well as article 24(Right to Freedom of Religion) which is a fundamental right. The other petitioners in the case were fighting over the land which is a property issue &amp; it's protection was under article 300A(Right to property) which is an ordinary right. \n\nThis is important as there is this principle in law where a fundamental right &gt; ordinary right.\n\nConclusion: Mecca to Muslims is same as Aayodhya to Hindus. Also faith and worship is more important than property.\n\n\n\n2. ASI's evidences from excavations\n- Idols and artifacts found which proved that there was a structure upon which the Mosque was built.\n\n- A slab with inscriptions was found and preserved  that in a nutshell talks about Lord Vishnu and someone killing a ten headed demon.\n\n- A floral like object was excavated that is a symbol of Hindu temples.\n\n- Many pillars and underground walls were found that laid a foundation for the Mosque.\n\nConclusion: The structure under the Mosque was not Islamic as Idol worship is forbidden in Islam.\n\n\n\n3. Ancient Scriptures\n-Many ancient foreign travellers including some Mughals had written in their scriptures about Aayodhya, the temple and people praying there.\n\n-Tulsidas who wrote Ramayana also mentioned in his  dohas about Aayodhya where he clearly mentions that there was a temple that was demolished by an invader where Hindus were also killed.\n\nConclusion: The structure under the Mosque was a Temple and had ties to Lord Ram, the 7th avatar of Lord Vishnu and killer of Ravana the ten headed demon.\n\n\n\n4. The Mosque built by Babur by his commander Mir Baqi was not recognised as a Monument of national interest as well as was not in any way an important Masjid to Muslims like the ones in Mecca and Madina. And the fact is many mosques are demolished and shifted for economic and domestic reasons in Islamic countries.\n\nMy final take:\nDemolition of the Mosque and other illegal activities done was not right and a criminal offence.\n\nBut the Mosque would either way be demolished if  an order by the SC would've been given for excavation purposes.\n\nHindus of 16th century were mostly killed, forcibly converted and their temples being destroyed.\n Hence  the AIMPLB and Sunni Waqf board who represent the muslim side should've given the land based on these facts to improve the communal harmony. \n\nIt is therefore this historic judgement which will serve as a basis for others judgments that will further give them a tough fight when Kashi and Mathura are brought in the picture."<br />Author: 'bennychetan98'<br />id: 'fe034i'<br />Flair :Research</li>

You cannot deny it and it cannot be ignored. \n\n\nWe need to form our sense of morality as a form of procedural virtue ethics, as it must be demanded unconditional obedience to absolute virtues with the attitude of social engineering and an ideological catalogue of virtues and commands. This fake secularism bullshit that we are fed is plain Hindu subdugation continuing even after the hundreds of years of exploitation. \n\n\nThe ideal Hindu new man should be an ideologically dedicated warrior who would commit actions for the sake of the our country, Mother India, and his religion while never deviating from our virtues and values. An individual can only develop their capabilities and individual characteristics within the framework of their social membership; to determine whether or not one was worthy of moral care. The concept of self-denial is to be replaced with the idea of self-assertion and self upliftment. \n\n\n\nBhrata if we don't stand up now, these librandus, marxists and islamists will take over. I urge you all to stand up and protect your identity. \n\n\nJai Hind, Jai Bharat, Jai Shri Ram."<br />Author: 'virat-hindu'<br />id: 'fdrn2d'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>

<li>Title: "What people don't understand about Hindu Rashtra"<br />Body: "India is already a Hindu Rashtra. Always was. Always will be. Secular constitution has nothing to do with it. A Western form of democracy survived in India because of secular nature of Hindu dharma. India has always accepted different ideologies such Nastika, Caravaka, Vedanta etc. What didn't work here was pseudo-secularism. \n\n\nSometimes people ask on this sub and at other places. When will India become a Hindu rashtra? My answer is: India was, is and always will be a Hindu Rashtra. It is a state of mind. When people ask, what about making India a theocratic state like Pakistan but a Hindu one? My answer to them is same as Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel's address to a rally of 5 million in Calcutta: It has been decided that India's constitution will always be secular. Some people might dislike my view but even if you ask PM Modi, his answer would be the same in my opinion. Modi is a secular Hindu, but what makes him different from all the pseudo-secular predecessors is that he is implementing the secular constitution to its core. If 370 is temporary, then he made it so. If triple talaq goes against secularism and is discriminatory against women, then criminalize it. If directive principles say there needs to be UCC, let's hope there will be one soon under Modi because no one else can do it. \n\n\nComing to Ram Mandir, building a temple does not go against secularism because secularism does not mean forgetting our roots. Also, CAA was important because of its civilizational value. When people ask when India will become a Hindu Rashtra? It comes from their naïve ignorance and what is Hindutva and a Hindu Rashtra. I have made a post in the past describing what it is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/enkz77/hindutva_sunday_discussion_thread_serious/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share).

In connection with the assassination of Gandhi, Nathuram Godse was arrested and presented in court. The court sentenced Godse to be hanged till death. Godse also admitted in court that he had killed Gandhi. Keeping his side, Godse told the court that I respect the country which Gandhi has served and that was why he bowed in his honor before shooting him, but because he made two pieces of unbroken India, that is why he shot Gandhi. \n\nNathuram Godse was hanged in Ambala jail on November 15, 1949. Prior to the execution, Godse had a Gita and a map Akhand Bharat in one hand and in the other hand he had a saffron flag. It is said that before the hanging, Godse had pronounced ‘Namaste Sada Vatsale’. \n\nYou would be surprised to know that Godse’s ashes have not been immersed in the river till now, but are kept safe in the room of a building located in the Shivaji Nagar area of \u200b\u200bPune. Apart from Godse’s ashes, some of his clothes and hand-written notes are also kept in that room. \n\n[ Nathuram Godse\'s ashes contained in the silver urn ](https://preview.redd.it/8e244apyfnk41.jpg?width=2109&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7b84b792ea08425df936d58dcce61034fd9103d)\n\nNathuram Godse’s niece Himani Savarkar had said during an interview that Godse’s body was not given to the family, but after hanging, the government itself had performed his last rites on the banks of Ghagghar river. After this, his ashes were given to them in a box. Since Godse had a last wish, his family has not yet released his ashes in the river, but they are kept safe in a silver urn. \n\nAccording to Himani Savarkar, Nathuram Godse had said to his family as his last wish that his ashes should be kept till the Indus river was absorbed into independent India and again unbroken India is created. After this dream is completed, his ashes should be flown in the river Indus. That is the reason that Godse’s family has kept his ashes in place till date. \n\nTo see India become whole once again is a dream of every Hindu nationalist. We must fight the anti-national elements like the \'tukde tukde gang\' and communists whose only motive is to destroy and disgrace our motherland by all means. \n\n["Why I killed Gandhi" part-I.

Jesus fucking Christ, the fact that Biden has any chance, let alone being the predicted nominee at this point is absurd.\n\nRemember when it seemed for a while that Roy Moore was going to lose the Alabama Senate race to a democrat, because he\'s a fucking paedophile, but then to the surprise of all the liberals who thought Republicans still had decency, it turned out that they\'re completely willing to stand behind our guy.\n\nWell congrats democrats on proving yourselves no fucking better. Congrats on proving that you\'re willing to elect someone whose behaviour around women is comparable to that of Jimmy fucking Saville. Congrats on proving that some borderline dementia patient who stands for absolutely nothing, and probably isn\'t even sane enough to run for president is your choice.\n\nBut y\'know, every democratic darling was completely unfit for presidency. National Service Pete, aka mr "I get funding from the state department and CIA, and will likely bomb and coup any country I\'m told to", Bloomberg, for whom apparently stop and frisk programs are "discriminatory towards whites" because in his vision of a world your skin colour is a crime(Who has 40 outstanding sexual harassment cases by the way, because systemic rape and misogyny is what our entire civilisation is built on). Biden was the tip of the fucking iceberg for these people.\n\nIn any sane democracy, the fact that there\'s any chance of two sex-pests barely able to form coherent sentences running against each other would be absurd.\n\nThe so called "Moderate Democrat" is a hate-driven ideological extremist who will rally behind their fashy leaders just the same as the alt-right. They try and smear us as hateful extremists and ideologues because it\'s sheer projection. They know full well they have no conviction, an inability to compromise, and hate for anyone who disagrees with them.\n\nIt\'s well known that fascists have a tendency to fall in line behind their leaders right and wrong because they\'re driven more by hate and insecurity in their position on social hierarchy. Well congrats on proving yourselves as fascists, you liberal scumbags. You\'ve proven that you hate us leftists so much that you will rally behind Joe Fucking Biden, who is by all metrics the most incompetent leader you could, just to spite us and to maintain your fucking starbucks lattes and wall street yuppie jobs.\n\nThe far-left on the other hand splinters itself a hundred times over minor ideological differences. Do you know why?, Because we actually fucking care, we actually believe in something. We\'re the ones who are willing to compromise on our positions out of pragmatism, we\'re the ones who are willing\n\nI\'m sick and fucking tired of the sheer vitriol and hate I get for being one of the few ACTUALLY moderate people out here. Because the far-left IS the moderate, yet every single time I try and compromise my position and rally behind a candidate half-way between my beliefs and the status quo, I get treated like an invader whose destroying your parties from the inside, and responsible for all your problems.\n\nI\'m fucking tired of the vitriol liberals have towards leftists, to the extent that they\'ll back Joe Biden just to fucking spite us, blame us on their inevitable loss to Trump, claim w\'ere invading THEIR party that they apparently have a god-given right to maintain as the status quo, and treating us like toxic trash to be discarded because we don\'t support the murder of Yemeni children, or people dying from lack of healthcare.\n\nYou know whose going to win this election if it comes between Biden and Trump?, Saudi Arabia. Because our only chance of having a president who actually wants world peace will be fucking ruined.\n\nDear Liberals, Dear Biden Voters: You may start noticing that you\'re being haunted by the ghosts of dead Yemeni children, bombed in the ongoing total war waged by Saudi Arabia which makes no distinction between civilians and military personnel.\n\nAny future wars in the Middle East are your fault. Our continued support of Saudi Arabia in their genocidal campaign will be your fault. The next refugee crisis will be your fault. That\'s what you get for not voting for peace. You get bombed children.\n\nAs a pacifist, I have to say: I fucking hate all of you. All of you are as bad as George W fucking Bush. The CIA are going to keep building up unlimited, unquestioned power to terrorise American citizens with, countries you can\'t even point out on a map will get invaded.\n\nEnjoy the slow decline in to tyranny that the US has been facing for decades now. Hope you enjoy being spied on by the NSA. And when the time finally comes that all the war and poverty and climate disaster is too much, and the National Guard start arresting dissidents on the street, because of the unchecked power of authoritarian warmongers is what causes all that fucking shit: You could have stopped this, but instead you chose to be fascists.'<br />Author: 'fsm_vs_cthulhu'<br />id: 'fdbx1e'<br />Flair :Laal Salaam</li>

They are the worst tormentors of civility and culture and why not? The Gods they worship and hang photo frames thereof in their offices are Karl Marx/Lenin/Stalin who espoused violence of every conceivable order/nature to realize their goals and the Doctrine of Violence happens to be very close to their hearts and souls. Founder of the Marxist cult, Karl Marx declared religion to be the opium of masses intoxicating them into artificial/superficial joy. However, does Marxist cult do anything other than poisoning / destroying masses after intoxicating them into false glory of equality?\n\nThere is one more ‘luminary’ whom they adore, copycat his strategies and actions to obfuscate real issues by preparing an insidiously false grand narrative. He happens to be Hitler’s Propaganda Minister Goebbels. By denying the existence of issues that have the potential to expose their anti-national, sinister activities or embarrass them for their sins of past and by harping on non-existent issues to confound the unsuspecting, is the Dodger’s Art that they have mastered by neatly following Goebbels and his shenanigans. Their nefarious activities have not been brought to the fore as the party that ruled over the country for six decades had been in cahoots with Reds, one of the worst instances of anti-national symbiotic relationships.\n\nBy deriving maximum advantage from their proximity to the ruling establishment, Reds worked out a powerful/well-hinged network of favor-seekers and favor-providers. This nefarious system had been largely responsible to ensure, the nation remained a wretched leader from the bottom in the merit-list of the UN Human Development Index all these years in all disciplines of national reconstruction. Their drum-beating propagandists/acolytes/adherents resort to fantastic arguments viz. “inevitable to cleanse the system of bourgeoisie /reactionaries” to justify every irrational /anti-national/criminal activity of their unworthiness. Their well-oiled false propaganda-reticulum has tarnished the image of the nation abroad and raised several hurdles in attaining laurels that the nation would have been attained otherwise.\n\nThe recent instance of Comrade Sitaram Yechury accusing BJP/RSS of “worming their way into Freedom Movement” notwithstanding the facts that they destroyed Gandhi’s Quit India Movement in cahoots with British-Occupiers and always hobnobbed with them, always condemned hard-earned freedom, are yet other stunning pieces of falsehood. They never took up cudgels to discover much to their enlightenment and discomfiture, thousands of RSS members were the foot-soldiers in freedom movement, every RSS shakha individually sent a congratulatory message to JL Nehru when resolution of ‘Purna Swaraj’ was passed by Congress in 1929, RSS actively participated in Non-Cooperation Movement in 1930, Quit India Movement with the founder Dr. Hedgewar himself very active from Nagpur to Kolkata with Anusilana Samiti and arrested for sedition in May 1921. During trial for sedition, he thundered in court before the Judge, “India belongs to Indians. We, therefore, demand independence. This is the content of all my speeches. People have to be told how to secure independence, and also how to conduct themselves after securing it. What law is there that gives one country the right to rule over the other? I am asking you, the Counsel for Government, this simple and straight question. Can you answer it? Is it not that against natural justice? If it is true that no country has a right to rule over another country, who gave the British the authority to trample the people of India under their feet? How can they enslave us and declare that they own this country? Is it not the most blatant murder of justice, morality and Dharma? Our mind revolts at the thought of remaining the slaves of the British Empire and carrying that stigma for all time. We demand nothing short of complete independence. Till we achieve it we cannot be at peace….” And Communist Reds periodically declare RSS did nothing to attain independence from British-Occupiers.\n\nReds are so much obsessed with and fear RSS/Hindu Rightists that whenever and wherever their political outfit BJP is installed in power, they begin undergoing all sorts of hallucinations hollering from rooftops on top of their vocal cords, be it education, foreign policy, internal security or any issue under the sun. In the state of Tamil Nadu, they have their vernacular version in DMK who keenly follow their footsteps in berating Hindu-s and Hinduism. The latest instances have been suggestions to observe Hindi Week, Guru-Utsava on Teacher’s Day and substitution of German with Samskrita in Central Schools. When Christians sing “Oh Jesus, lead us…”, Reds and Dravidians swing to the tune but turn ferociously abusive if Saraswati Vandana is recited. Red-Wolves just hate anything even remotely connected with Hinduism. Hindi movies run for weeks in Tamil Nadu, Dravidian hotheads produce Hindi-hits and progeny of Mother Tamil send their children to English schools even while abusing Hindi uninterruptedly.\n\nMarxist pseudo-historians in cahoots with Nehruvian intellectuals, denigrated all stalwarts of the independence movement, be it Netaji Bose or Sardar Patel. Quite methodically, they established Nehru-Gandhi family as flawless who swear by lofty ideals of democratic values, nourished that through their blood and sweat, others happen to be unworthiness as hangers on to them with a finger in every pie, all achievements of the nation originating from the Dynasty while failures/setbacks crafted by all others. DK Chakravorty, a distinguished historian who taught History / Archaeology at the University of Cambridge, disclosed, “Since coming of this group to power, the world of Indian historical studies has been largely criminalized.”\n\nReds have executed cultural subversion of the country extensively so much so that what external invaders could not do, was adroitly committed by them. Reds and westernized rootless, intellectuals know the power and strength of Sanskrit and the fear of being rendered worthless by Sanskrit looms large in their minds. NASA has declared Sanskrit as the perfect language for advanced scientific calculations and computer programming. Briggs wrote in the issue of Artificial Intelligence 1985, “Sanskrit is the perfect language designed for enlightened communication. It is the one and only unambiguous spoken language in the world.” All attempts by Red planted bogus western scholars viz. Wendy Doniger, Arundhati Roy, Sheldon Pollock to defame Hindus and Hinduism have been successfully thwarted so far by a determined group of nationalists whom Reds do not miss even whiff of an opportunity to berate and abuse. Reds do not allow people to believe that the great Hindu civilization adored women, that there were no Dalits /untouchables, that there were no prostitutes at all, that it was an invasion of western bigots that destroyed Hindu civilization and cultural heritage.\n\nSo desperate were they after installation of Modi government in 2014 that they not only engineered murderous assaults on so-called rationalists, the farcical return of awards by literary figures, etc. but also raised the decibel level between two lunatic fringes of society, one faking public opinion and the other, symptomatic of Government policies. They even moved to the extent of declaring; the Idea of India is in a perpetual clash with the Govt. elected with a massive mandate to deliver the Idea of India. It is always that Leftist intellectuals cry wolf loudest. They dread the scenario of losing control of the Indian Council of Historical Research which they monopolize to carry out their nefarious designs of cultural/historical subversions. ‘Eminent Historians’ authored by Arun Shourie speaks volumes on their ‘trade’ practices solely meant to perpetuate Red hegemony. Red historian Irfan Habib even went to the extent of castigating revival efforts of the Saraswati river which enjoys enormous value in Vedic wisdom and Hindu civilization. The Marxist historian spent his lifetime proving, the Saraswati river never existed, contrary to all scientific studies, satellite imagery, etc. to the contrary.\n\nFraudulent theory of Aryan Invasion too was propagated Marxists. Also are they hell-bent to negate everything even remotely connected with Sanatana Dharma? Everything good about Hinduism, if at all any, was brought in by Aryan invaders, Alexander brought Vedic wisdom into the country…and Hindus at best, be remembered for having contributed absolutely nothing. The first activity that Marxists undertake is to destroy entire cultural heritage and convert everyone into empty-headed zombies to create space in their minds so as to allow the venomous doctrine of Marxism to take roots in their minds.\n\nReds deviously supported Jinnah’s Direct Action on Aug.16, 1946 and partition of Bharat with the statement in their own words, “…secession would lead to still greater and more glorious unity of India, the like of which India has not seen in her history”. They waved many flags viz. Soviet flag, Red flag, Russian flag, then League flag. Whenever Dr. SP Mookerjee, a hard-core nationalist, picked up any issue pertaining to the nation’s interest, Reds began howling and yelling from rooftops on top of their voice.\n\nThey ruled over Bengal uninterruptedly for four decades and left the state in tatters, completely pauperized. The State they left behind was infested with anti-national/criminal activities, industrial junkyards, democratic institutions emaciated, education in ruins, then the revelations about electoral malpractices, large-scale booth-capturing, etc. to win elections. They allowed atrocities by Muslims on Hindu-s in the name of secularism, encouraged Bangladeshi infiltrators as their vote-banks destroying entire demography of the State. And when they lost to TMC of Mamata Banerjee, all Reds joined TMC to enjoy a free hand in all matters as ever in addition to a bloodbath of their opponents. In Kerala too, the tale of Reds is almost the same. When they have realized, the ground beneath in Kerala has been slipping away and they are on the verge of decimation, they resorted to uninterrupted killing spree all over the state.

They have never been known to undertake any nation-building activity/social work, never in any relief/rehabilitation exercise ever they participated when a natural calamity strikes, never supportive when the nation’s integrity had been at stake or ancient cultural heritage threatened.\n\nIf religion is really opium of masses as vouchsafed by Marx, is not Marxism cyanide pill of the same masses?\n\nAn answer on Quora further details how the Communists and the left-wing are destroying India from within:\n\n&gt;If one examines the reasons of why Communism and Communist parties have been unequivocally rejected the world over. He/She will find that there are solid reasons why the communists countries collapsed, have been hounded in many countries, criticized in several others and violently overthrown in countries which they ruled.  \nCommunism, as an ideology, is in itself so colossally flawed that it cannot be reformed. In the past, all those who have tried to reform its intrinsic faults, either have been labelled as schismatic or have been mass slaughtered for having expressed dissent.  \nThe Left has since quite a while ago utilized the term rightist to malign its adversaries, much as the old Christian church called non-Christians "barbarians" and "blasphemers". Notwithstanding warring Leftist gatherings call their clashing Leftist rivals fascists. European Leftists call the United States a rightist nation. The far Left in America calls the Republican right rightist.  \nPresently the Soviet Union has vanished from the scene and the Communist development in India does not know whom to serve. In any case, its antagonistic vibe towards Hindu society and culture stays undiminished. It is quite on the cards that this mercenary outfit will be purchased over, at the appointed time, by some other power or powers antagonistic to positive Indian patriotism. A Communist can\'t resist being a backstabber to his nation and his kin.  \n**Yuri Bezmenov, an ex-KGB agent exposes how the Soviet Union utilized the so called Indian pseudo-intellectuals to obliterate India.** He clarifies how the toxin called communism was acquainted in India to keep alive individuals within the Indian community group who could obliterate our cultural and social values from inside. He goes ahead to clarify the part he played for the Soviet Union. He was to watch and keep an eye on the academicians in India, who were propelled by communist standards, welcome them to Russia and mentally program them into decimating our nation. The Soviet Union essentially implemented a well-arranged procedure to indoctrinate an entire country into their convictions and utilize these countries further bolstering their good fortune.  \nClearly thinking about it, this was a splendid arrangement by the Soviet operators. A teacher has the ability to impact the youth who are brimming with vitality. A little provocative direction would clearly lead them to take after communism and supporting standards that the Soviet would need them to.  \nBezmenov was directed to gradually however without a doubt build up the Soviet style of authority in India. Around the same time, a sector mandate of the Central Committee opened another secret office in all government offices of the Soviet Union around the globe, titled the “Research and Counter-Propaganda Group.” Bezmenov turned into a deputy chief of that division, which assembled insight from sources like Indian informers and operators, in regards to practically every compelling or the politically noteworthy subject of India.  \nAmid that period, progressively observing the Soviet framework as insidious and immoral, Bezmenov cautiously planned to abandon the project.  \n**Now think about this carefully, and you will clearly understand why some universities in India like JNU, Aligarh Muslim University, Jadhavpur University, Hyderabad University, etc. are in this state today.**  \nThis video might be somewhat long but is nevertheless extremely critical that you unmistakably understand every single word Yuri says.  \n[Former KGB Agent Yuri Bezmenov Explains How to Brainwash a Nation (Full Length)](https://youtu.be/5It1zarINv0)  \n**The ignominious tale of Indian Communists:**  \nWest Bengal and Kerala have essentially conceived the brunt of Communist organizations in India. In both these states, the level of influence of the Communist belief system makes it inconceivable for a contradiction to survive. It was essentially in view of this influence the Communist Party clung to control in West Bengal for almost 4 decades. Universities and Colleges were changed over into caves of political thought. Disagreeing students and lecturers/teachers were bashed to death or crashed into depression and despair. Local comrade chieftains caused repulsive reprisal on the individuals who upheld other political gatherings. Kill, Rape, Arson, Electoral deceit all served as weapons to keep up Communist run the show. In Kerala, fight amongst Communists and RSS has guaranteed many lives. Atheist Communists in Kerala bolstered the reason for Mopalastan (Country for Kerala Muslims) and birthed a Muslim larger part region, Malappuram. Atheist Communists in West Bengal have bolstered the reason for illicit migrants from Bangladesh. Communists in India have upheld each hostility to the nation as their own-Independence of Hyderabad, Opposition to Quit India Movement, Partition of India, Support for China in the 1962 war, etc. They have even bolstered the worldwide Jihad as a freeing, anti-Imperialist development on the planet. What\'s more, now, these godforsaken Leftists have even held hands to contradict Nationalism and patriotism in the nation. Flying the national banner is viewed as a demonstration of incitement, maintaining Indian culture is viewed as an injustice. These Communists and Media people on their finance would preferably have us turned into a province of their Masters than live as glad residents of a free country.  \n[Census of Political Murders in West Bengal during CPI-M Rule—1977-2009](https://www.mainstreamweekly.net/article2234.html)  \n[From Moscow to Bengal - How Communists dealt with blood](https://www.saddahaq.com/from-moscow-to-bengal-how-communists-dealt-with-blood)\n\nMany conspiracy theories are floating around on the internet which states that communist groups across the world are joining forces to establish what they call as the \'New World Order\' in the coming years and nationalism is an inherent setback from accomplishing their goals because of which, the recent cases like that of George Soros to fund 1 Billion USD to fight nationalism is occurring.

<li>Title: 'The main problem with Hindus which has always been the cause for their suffering.'<br />Body: 'This post is an extension to my previous post "Mughal India - The biggest holocaust in world history". If you haven\'t already read it before, read it [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/HindutvaRises/comments/fbvhng/mughal_india_the_biggest_holocaust_in_world/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).\n\nThe effort to whitewash the real history of Marathas, Sikhs, Rajputs, and other Hindus is going on since Independence to prove Hindu-Muslim unity philosophy.\n\n**The main problem with Hindus which has always been the cause for their suffering is that same problem which once led to the downfall of Prithviraj Chauhan and other Rajputs. The inability to do what is necessary because of a false sense of self-righteousness.**\n\nLet\'s understand the story of Prithviraj Chauhan and Mohammed Ghori.\n\nIn the second half of the 12th century, Mohammed Ghori of Afghanistan was inspired by his Islamic preacher Moinuddin Chishti (now worshiped in Ajmer Sharif *dargah* by Hindus and Muslims both) to attack India and convert it into an Islamic nation. Mesmerized by the great riches of India, Mohammed Ghori attacked India many times. As per Rajput history recorded by Hindu historians and Chander Bardai (one of the greatest poets of that time in India and was also a friend of Prithviraj Chauhan) in his book *Prithviraj Raso*, Ghori attacked Prithviraj Chauhan 16 times. (Islamic historians mention only two wars).\n\nEvery time after defeat, Mohammed Ghori used to ask for forgiveness and as per Rajput tradition, Prithviraj Chauhan spared him. It was the biggest mistake ever made by any King in Indian history which is paid by Indians even now. That mistake is the reason for the assault on more than a quarter-billion Indians for nearly more than 30 generations. Every time on return to Afghanistan, Mohammed Ghori would destroy villages, kill males and take few lakh young girls as sex slaves with him.\n\nAs per 1400 years old Muslim tradition, whenever Muslims won a battle, they took women in from that kingdom as slaves. The history of rapes, nude marches, conversions are mentioned in Rajput history. Book *Meera Charita* ( Author: Saubhagya Kunvari Ranavat) had original notes from the time of Meera, Bhojraj Rana Sanga from the early 16th century. The book also finds mention about *Jauhar* and why it was performed to escape atrocities. Maratha\'s history also states the same.\n\nFamous Sikh saying of “*Sardar ke 12 baj gaye*” is related to outnumbered Sikhs attacking huge Muslim forces at 12 ‘O’ clock at night and day (summers when the sun was ferocious and spoilers use to rest). Enemies sometimes in lacs even felt helpless against a handful of Sikhs who were committed to saving captured Hindu sisters who were made sex slaves. Prithviraj Chauhan was unaware of these Islamic laws of taking women as slaves, as in India, during those days, kings used to challenge another king for war if necessary. Then both armies would gather for war.\n\nWars during that time were fought between sunrise and sunset in *maidaan* (big grounds). If the result was undecided, there would be a break after sunset and war would start again the next day. This might continue for days. Running enemies were not attacked. Unarmed enemies were not attacked. Enemies were also given respect on the principle of bravery (Kshatriya dharma). Even the queens and women of the defeated king were respected along with the general population. If a defeated king asked forgiveness, it was considered a very big thing as people were ready to die for keeping their words. The famous saying was *Prana Jaye per wachan na Jaaye* (Even life can be sacrificed for keeping words).\n\nMohammed Ghori’s final attack on Prithviraj Chauhan was at the end of the 12th century. Ghori defeated Chauhan with betrayal and with the help of Prithviraj Chauhan’s father in law Jaichand. Jaichand was the enemy of Prithviraj because King Anagpal made Prithviraj Chauhan as his successor of the Delhi kingdom instead of Jaichand. King Anagpal did on the basis of qualities of Prithviraj even though Jaichand had first right on the kingdom on the basis of birth. Besides, Jaichand was older than Prithviraj. Jaichand was unaware of the culture and war betrayal techniques of Muslims. By the time he opposed it, it was too late and even Jaichand was killed by Ghori. The first thing Ghori did was that he made Prithviraj blind (punishment of mercy). Then he took his wife Sanyogita as a slave.\n\nShould Moinuddin Chishti of Ajmer *dargah* be worshipped by Hindus or not?\n\nMoinuddin Chishti proudly said after the defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan, “We have conquered India with great difficulty. Prithviraj Chauhan’s lovely wedded wife will now share the bed with Mohammed Ghori”.\n\nMohammed Ghori gifted young daughters (it is said Prithviraj raised them up like his own daughters) of Prithviraj Chauhan to his teacher Moinudeen Chishti as slaves after his victory. Prithviraj Chauhan’s daughters managed to kill Chishti by trick and then sacrificed themselves to escape atrocities. Captured Prithviraj Chauhan was taken to Afghanistan – Ghor by Mohammed Ghori. Prithviraj Chauhan did not bow down to accept Islam even though his wife was sexually assaulted. He did not bow down even though his eyes were plucked off. He was not ready to accept Islam even after he was forcefully made to eat cow’s meat by Ghori. He did not give up his religion until his last breath. That was the sincerity showed towards his religion by Prithviraj Chauhan. If you really wish to worship then worship this personality who did not give up even after all the brutalities by Islamic forces till he perished. Today this India’s warrior is buried in Afghanistan, outside the mausoleum of Mohammed Ghori.\n\nThe arrival of Muslim forces into India has destroyed Indian culture to a great extent.\n\nIndian culture is bashed by the modern observer for having practices inhumane like *Jauhar* and *Sati* and child marriages. But what is the actual reason behind its occurrence?\n\nWhat is *Jauhar*?\n\nJauhar is a death ceremony of valor celebrated among Hindu queens along with women in their territory. When the kings go on a final war\xa0against Muslim invaders (Saka) and the chances of victory are nil then these outnumbered warriors would give final stand. Queens along with women in their territory gather together and prepare a huge well of ferocious fire. Then these women would jump into that fire to save their pride. This fire sacrifice of self, considering the values and pride above life is called as *Jauhar*. Women who performed *Jauhar* are referred to as *Jauhar Sati*.\n\nWhat is *Sati Pratha*?\n\n*Sati Pratha* is when\xa0the wife burns herself alive along with the dead body of her husband. This *pratha* started after the Islamic invasions began. There are no records of *Sati pratha* in the history of Hindu kingdoms before. At least, no case of *Sati* is there in Indian tradition since the history from 3000 B.C.\xa0 This practice came into the picture during Islamic rule because when a Hindu male died, his wife was often captured and sold in the market by Muslim kings.\n\nNote: Only those Hindus who paid *Jizya* tax (a tax that is imposed by Muslim rulers on non-Muslims till they agree to convert into Islam) as per Islam survived atrocities during the Muslim rule. Rest all are killed or converted on swords.\n\nWho Is Sati as Per Hindu Text or Vedas?\n\nAs per *Vedas,* Sati was the daughter of Lord Brahma’s son Daksha Prajapati. Sati was an incarnation of Durga, the wife of Shiva. Sati’s father Daksha disgraced Lord Shiva in front of all. She was not able to tolerate it. So she sat in a Yoga *asana* and meditated on inner fire at naval. The meditative fire appeared from within and merged her into it. This is one of the methods as per Yoga to leave the body at will.\n\nApart from it, there is one more example from *Mahabharat* when Madri (wife of King Pandu) sacrificed herself in fire at the death of her husband 5000 years ago. Madri did so as an atonement as she thought herself to be the reason for King Pandu getting cursed from the Rishi resulting in his death. Apart from that, no other example is seen even in Vedic texts. King Dashrath died in sorrow when Lord Ram’s exile happened, but his widows never become *Sati.* Kunti was a widow but never become *Sati.* Abhimanyu’s wife was also a widow. There is no other example other than that. There is no record of *Sati Pratha* ever in any kingdom during these 4000 years before the Islamic invasions.\n\nWhat Is Mystery Behind Night Marriage in India?\n\nAs per Hindu (Sanatan) tradition, marriage is a *Yagya* (sacrifice). *Hawan\xa0 kund* (sacrifice place) is prepared and fire sacrifice is performed with celebrations. As per Hindu scriptures, marriage (*Vivah Yagya*) is always performed between sunrise\xa0to\xa012 Noon. It can’t be performed with the sun setting down (after\xa012 Noon). So why marriages among some Hindus still happen during night time?\n\nIt was started after the Islamic invasions. During Muslim rule in India, only those Hindus survived who paid heavy *Jizya* tax. When a Hindu was to get married, the Muslim commander\xa0of that territory had to be informed. Then\xa0the girl to be married had to spent a few nights with that Muslim commander before marriage. If avoided, then all the members of the family would be killed and the women would be taken as slaves to be sold in the market. To avoid such atrocities, Hindus started to perform their ceremonies at night incognito.\n\nHow And When Child Marriage Started in India?\n\nChild marriage was never a part of Hindu culture. Going by historical records, Sita-Ram, Rukmini Krishna and nearly all the kings before the Islamic invasions got married as grown-up adults. It started during the Muslim rule. Child marriage is a part of Islam. It all started when 53-year-old Prophet Mohammed married 9-year-old child bride Aisha Bint Abi Bakr. As per Islam, when a girl is strong enough to bear the weight of the male on her body then she could be married.\n\nTo impose this law, Muslim rulers used to take unmarried girls as slaves as soon as they reach their puberty. Hindu and Sikh girls being kidnapped and forcibly converted as soon as they reached around 14 years is actually part of the same 1400 yrs old tradition. The same tradition is still followed in Muslim nations. Pakistan is also doing the same with Hindu and Sikh girls.\xa0They kidnap them as soon as they reach 14-15 years of age. Family members reporting the incident to police used to receive the same reply that their daughters were converted into Islam and got married and that they could not meet them. *WION News,* an India based International news channel, recently covered this and even its reporter was attacked by terrorists for reporting, but somehow the reporter managed to escape. This was the reason that Hindus were forced to follow the law of child marriage.\n\nThe culture of killing, converting, destroying ancient Universities in India was on heights wherever Muslims won. One after another from Qutub Din, Ibrahim Lodhi, Humayun, Babar, Akbar, Jahangir, Shahjahan to Aurangzeb, Adil Shah, Haider Ali, Tipu Sultan, everyone followed the same tactics. Everyone broke hundreds of thousands of Hindu temples and converted them into mosques, took heavy *Jizya* tax, captured Hindu women, and took them as sex slaves.\n\nThe practices which once began to protect oneself later continued as \'tradition\' because most Indians, still today, are not aware of their past.\n\nHindu kings kept on fighting and defeating Muslim invaders. Sometimes losing and sometimes winning but someone or other was continuously fighting the Muslim forces.\n\nMost ferocious were the Rajputs, Marathas, Sikhs and rulers of the Vijaynagar Empire (3-4 times bigger than Mughals), etc. Many Hindus kings who won many battles were erased from history by Islamic historians after a single defeat. Wherever Hindu kings ruled, the Hindu population used to flourish and women were safe but the moment they were invaded, males were killed and females were taken as slaves.\n\nIn our school curriculum, a significant bit of the history that is being taught is about the Delhi Sultanate, Mughals and British. Much to our dismay that the majority of the realities given are twisted.\n\nWhat harms this further is that Mughal rulers are celebrated for their architecture and so forth yet with regards to the atrocities done by them, our historians easily look the other way. Furthermore, not only Mughals, be it Mahmud Ghazni or Ibrahim Lodhi, everybody\'s hand is bloodstained. Still, our historians and NCERT textbooks neglect to give any record to that.\n\nFor what reason are the tyrants celebrated?\n\n1. A great deal of this has to do with our politicians. In a democratic nation with that much diversity, political issues regularly turn into a key factor that shapes things and Indian history is the same.\n2. India saw a partition on religious lines. Our politicians were terrified that India may observe another such occasion and the best way to maintain a strategic distance from any such occasion, according to them is to "pacify".\n3. This sort of political position, supported the Indian Marxist historians to totally whitewash the Islamic history that was bloodstained.\n4. Historians with a bit of taste for the truth and facts never got the necessary attention.\n5. Vote bank politics. Indian politicians are worried that discharging the truth may be a reason for worry for them. This may outrage the Hindus and that may prompt loss of votes.\n6. The innate fear that with the ascent of right-wing nationalist groups, the arrival of such information may be adverse to the communal harmony.\n\nWhat’s the reason why Hindus are still in the majority?\n\nRajputs, Marathas, Sikhs, and many brave kings and queens kept on fighting and defeating these Muslim invaders. The reality is that Muslims were never able to capture the whole of India and have ruled only some parts of India. Like Vijay Garh was a Hindu territory and was nearly 3 times bigger than the Mughal Empire. But this is not taught in History. The final nail in the coffin of Muslim rule was put by Sikhs (Guru Gobind Singh) and Marathas (Shivaji). But their glories are not taught much in Indian school textbooks. Instead, the glories of Muslim invaders are wrongly taught in a heroic manner. After Independence, the glorious Hindu history of sacrifice and atrocities by Muslim invaders were whitewashed as a part of the political agenda of the Congress party (read the Ghazwa-e-Hind post [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/HindutvaRises/comments/eoo3n8/the_shocking_reality_of_ghazwaehind_they_wont/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)).\n\nThe justice will be done when correct and full history will be taught as in records of Rajputs, Marathas, Sikhs, and other Hindu kingdoms rather than of those written by Islamic and communists propaganda historians.\n\nWhat is my opinion about this?\n\nThere is no reason for battling over the past. What has happened has happened. We can\'t change it. In any case, having said that, I feel that we should introduce the truth to the people. History can show us a ton however when the history itself is distorted, the lessons it can provide fundamentally reduces, right? So the verified facts should and ought to be given. We have committed mistakes previously and we should learn from it. Unless we learn, we will undoubtedly commit the same mistake again.\n\nIslam is a force that has to be continuously resisted. The day we stop standing up against their oppression, is the day we perish. To resist it, I don\'t mean to call for violence in any way (as some \'intellectuals\' here will selectively point this out) but to stop victimizing them and justifying their wrongdoings every step of the way. If secularism is what someone says they stand for, then allow it to work both ways and not only towards \'minority appeasement\' as coexisting peacefully is what our *dharma* teaches us. But if that is not the case, then don\'t hesitate to stand up for your rights. Fight it, if and when, it becomes necessary because \'peace\' if it comes at the expense of lives and rights of Hindus, is the peace which you should not strive for. This is our motherland and to protect is up to us and no one else. Be militant instead of suffering your fate in silence.\n\nIf today, you\'re a Hindu, if you can openly chant \'Jai Shree Ram\' in public then it\'s only because your ancestors were reluctant to oblige and accept Islam regardless of the challenges. Whether, it was paying *Jizya* or fighting to the death to uphold *dharma*. Be grateful. Always.\n\nYou are answerable to your descendants.\n\nJai Hind. Jai Shree Ram.'<br />Author: 'TheInsaneM'<br />id: 'fcd4qy'<br />Flair :Research</li>

That it would be somehow any less of a horrific for her.\n\nAnd this coming from a so called "feminist" who wants to "reform" hinduism to the extent that she once even said this about Hinduism, while talking of the Sabrimala issue (where she wants entry of all women):\n\n[Ok, boomer.](https://preview.redd.it/37kuz57ep9k41.png?width=756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=864e743a8b7d559e3eadad5ca853910c1247f069)\n\nSo banning women from Sabrimala (the temple whose deity\'s very fundamental stricture is about him not wanting fertile age women around ... good luck getting his blessings if you don\'t follow even his basic wishes) makes Hinduism the second worst religion of the world?\n\n"*I lack basic reasoning faculties coz muh bromeenikul  patriarrchiesz!!!*"\n\n......\n\nApart from the sheer stupidity, what strikes me is this: that someone is willing to fall so low as to even trivialize rape just push forward their personal socio-political narrative (which ironically enough, is about empowering women).\n\nJust how depraved are you?\n\n.....\n\nIn any case, while rather abrupt and off the cuff, there is a larger point I\'d like to attempt to make with this post, rather than just ranting about one case.\n\nI\'d like to take note of the fact that in the recent years, not just in Reddit, as RW seems to be becoming more and more mainstream as a political movement and gaining, pseudo-liberals re-packaging their rhetoric in a RW/Bhagwa wrapper (to use a very rough description) seems to be becoming more and more common, across all platforms, and across all levels (from anonymous posters on message boards to more prominent figures) \n\nThis particular lady here is just a more rabid and easily spotted example.

I can’t write who am I because these people are powerfull and they will come after me.\n\nThe Delhi riots were instigated by Muslims and many Hindus have died. They have been wanting to start some sort of killing since December when CAA was passed. We saw Shaheen Bagh and even before that, there were already Muslims doing riots. From Uttar Pradesh to Delhi, Mumbai, Gujarat, Bengal and everywhere else. Muslims threw stones, petrol bombs and what not. So it is weird that Wikipedia article paints Delhi riots as some program to kill all Muslims by Hindus.\n\nWhile everyone is outraging, I know who exactly is ruining India image in the world.

It is only Kejriwal because his votebank will be happy. Deepesh Raj is just doing work for Kejriwal.

<li>Title: 'A LONG-FORM dialogue on understanding the Left mindset that I think will help those feeling helpless against the demonization of Hindus in the international press and in understanding why the Indian left media acts the way it does. Please read TILL THE END. Repost from r/IndiaSpeaks.'<br />Body: 'Hello everyone. Over the past few days I as well as others have been thoroughly disturbed by what has been going on. The way the leftist media has been selectively presenting facts, committing errors of omission, often straight out lying to construct their narratives to ruin India\'s image internationally, and to break down the morale of the people who support the constitutional changes taking place in the country currently. Upon seeing these lies peddled by the media, a family member during a call with me, asked indignantly, "Ye log jhoont kyun dikha rahe hain? Inhe pata nahin ki asliyat kya hai, ya jhoont bolte hain? tum bade shahr mein rehte ho, tumhein pata hoga?"\n\nAs a conservative, up until now I\'d been focusing solely studying the philosophy of the right. So basic economics, Thomas Sowell, Karl Popper, Paul Johnson, and other important scholars of the right. Only recently did I out of curiosity started studying a little bit of the left, and I have to say, while their ends might be wrong, the means they\'re employing are quite effective. Admittedly, my knowledge of the left is very basic. But for what it is worth, here it goes. I\'ll put it down in dialogue form. Hope you find it informative.\n\nP.S. - After I started writing, I just kept on, and the post grew to this length. I\'m grateful that this subreddit helped me articulate my views.\n\n**Why does the left-wing media not see that the riot was both-sided? That both Hindus and Muslims participated in it, and that there was advanced planning on part of the Muslims too? Why is it still trying to portray the Muslims as a victim minority group, when it so obviously a lot better organized and being around 15% of the country, and making up 24% of the world, is a global majority compared to the Hindus?**\n\nBecause the left is not interested in the question of who is being unfair to whom. It is not a question of whether Hindus are oppressing the Muslims, or the other way around. These are pretenses to dupe the people into believing that they advocate for "minority rights" and "open borders" out of compassion and humanistic intentions. Their real objective is something else.\n\n**What is it?**\n\nSome kind of internationalism. An order where the sovereignty of the individual nations is severely compromised and a top-down international government has a say in every little thing national entities do[i](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote1sym). A society where all fault-lines based on religion, ethnicity, etc. disappear and only one division remains: the one based on class and class-consciousness.\n\n**I\'m somewhat aware of these terms. What you\'re saying sounds like Marxism. But as far as I know, Marxism failed in the Soviet Union catastrophically, so why would they try to do it again in India? And isn\'t this a conspiracy theory?**\n\nIt sounds like a conspiracy theory, yes, to people who have not been acquainted with this philosophy. It is not. Look, theories seem probable only in light of other knowledge that a person already has in their mind. Think about the idea of the sun moving around the earth. The idea would sound ridiculous to someone who\'s not familiar with the notion of gravity, and the model of the solar system. If you were to tell a ninth-century Indian about this notion, they\'d probably balk at you and call you crazy. I\'m not saying what I\'m stating is a scientific theory, but this is just to say that certain ideas seem senseless until you get a sense of the background propositions, the knowledge *in the light of which* the idea makes sense.\n\n**Okay, what you\'re saying seems** ***bakwaas***, **but fine, what\'s the "background knowledge"?**\n\nIt\'ll take a bit of time. You\'ll have to bear with me. And it\'ll seem to have no bearing upon the present situation, till the very end. Are you up for continuing this conversation?\n\n**Sure, I have time. Go ahead.**\n\nOkay, so here we go. You\'re aware that soon after the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815, this guy Karl Marx was born. He was an almost-exact contemporary of Darwin, and from the middle of the 19th century onwards he wrote several tracts on the ideology of communism alongside another guy called Engels. So we have *The Communist Manifesto* and *Das Capital*, and a huge bunch of compiled writings, including essays on India.\n\n**Yes, yes. The idea that the bourgeoisie groups together as a class and controls the means of production, i.e. the big factories, and uses economic coercion and the power of the state to force the proleteriat -- the poor industrial workers -- into toeing their line. I know that this idea created havoc in Europe soon after, and reached its apogee with the October Revolution of 1917 in Russia, when the Bolsheviks headed by Lenin came to power. It quickly turned into a state of oppression, and under Stalin the state turned into a machinery of terror and the ego-maniac killed hundreds of thousands of the citizens. The state survived for the next forty years or so and finally disintegrated into fifteen repubic states around 1990. It\'s often joked about since. What\'s the catch?**\n\nThe catch is that what we know of and what we criticize is merely Soviet Marxism. Soviet Marxism is just one type of Marxism among several others, and often when we criticize the same, we criticize its economic aspects and Marxists laugh at us because that\'s not even the kind of Marxism they\'re aiming for in the present. There are other schools of Marxism flourishing in the democratic world that a lot of us are unaware of. This is specially true for the India, where most of the people as it is are ignorant of political ideologies -- “*Are bhaiya kya hai ye left and right? Ham to insaaniyat dekhte hain ...*”\n\n**Okay, go ahead. Tell me about those schools.**\n\nLook, when we criticize Marxism for its faulty economics we criticize classical Marxism, Marxism as it was penned down by the originators Marx and Engels. When we critize Marxism for its turning into a reign of terror, we mostly mean the Stalinist regime and Soviet Russia. What we completely ignore is **Western Marxism**. The Marxism that emerged in the Western European countries as Eastern European countries fell under the Soviet spell in the 1917-1923 revolutions following the October Revolution. Think about the progression of Marxist philosophy like this: Classical Marxism --&gt; Leninism --&gt; Leninism-Stalinism --&gt; Western Marxism.\n\n**What\'s Western Marxism? How\'s it different from other forms? And this better have a bearing on India pretty soon.**\n\nBear with me. In a very rough way, I can put it this way. In the inter-war period, between 1919 when WWI ends and 1939 when WWII begins, Marxism went a series of crises.\n\nFirst, the Soviet revolutions took place only in the eastern european countries, the Balkans and the Central Asian countries, etc. In the western european countries, countries like England, France, Germany, Italy, communist revolutions failed and were repressed thoroughly by the state. Why? In Germany and Italy, the ideology of fascism took root. England had a strong democratic and classical liberal tradition, and France already had ideas of liberty and social democracy engrained into it by the French Revolution. In summary, Marxism failed to take root in the western europe. This was ironic, since these were the countries where the population of the industrial workers was the greatest. The eastern european countries didn\'t have much industry, and so minimal industrial workers which constitute the proleteriat, and revolutions there, contrary to what Marx had anticipated, were won on the basis of the peasants.\n\nSecondly, after the death of Lenin in 1924, Stalin came to power, and immediately turned the state into a dictatorship. Marxist political and economic philosophy, which until then was being constantly added to by a variety of thinkers, was suddenly strangled. People either were members of the official communist party, and strictly and silently observed its diktat, or they were exiled or killed. This brought an end to innovative Marxist philosophy in Eastern Europe.\n\nAnd so the epicentre of Marxist philosophy shifted to western europe, where it had failed. Communists either were imprisoned, exiled, or concealed their affiliation and worked in secrecy.\n\nThe biggest question before these Marxists: why did we fail in the west? What happened? Why does the working class not organize together and get up in arms against their oppressors and overthrow the state? Why do they still vote and feel proud about their countries? Why do they love a nation that exploits them? Marxist philosophy had asserted so much, and much of what happened was contrary to its expectations. Marxists needed to get back to the drawing board. Analyze what happened. Amend their philosophy to explain their failure.[ii](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote2sym)\n\n**Interesting. So how did the Western Marxists alter their philosophy?**\n\nIn Italy, Mussolini came to power in the early 1920s, and immediately started using the state apparatus against the PCI, the Communist Party of Italy. This party was headed by a guy called **Antonio Gramsci** (1891-1937), a small, physically-weak clever dude who would later change the course of Marxism as it is practiced today. This guy was put behind bars in 1926, where he, like Hitler, Nehru, Savarkar, Mandela, and many other political leaders, had time to meditate on his politics and write about it.\n\nWestern Marxism in its fundamentals is a progression of what Gramsi\'s thought as it was conceived in the Italian prison. He challenged certain fundamental propositions regarding the how the state achieves power: most importantly, he challenged the **dominance account of power**: the idea which asserts that the state obtains and maintains power by *force* and *economic coercion,* that is, that the state beats people down or blackmail people economically to hold on to power. This was a commonly-accepted notion amongst Marxists of that era, and one that blew back into their faces, since quite embarrassingly, the “working class” liked their state, a lot of them being fiercely nationalistic, and didn\'t pay attention to the communist call for revolution in Western Europe.\n\n**But is it not true? The state does dominate. Look at China, look at Tianeman square, look at the south american countries, how they brutally beat down on protests using state power. How else does the state rule?**\n\nYou must understand the basic problem that Antonio Gramsci is fighting with, which, simply put is: *why are the people in democratic (and fascist) nations not responding to the Marxist call for revolution? Why do they love their countries so much? Why are they patriotic, and enroll in armies and sing national anthems with heartfelt pride for states that – according to the Marxists – are all about exploiting them?*\n\nThat the state rules by force is true, but according to Gramsci, it is only part of the whole truth. Clearly, the British weren\'t suppressing communist revolts by the dozens using arms. The communist revolts weren\'t happening in the first place because people didn\'t have that much of a problem with the government. They had disagreements, they had grievances, sometimes grave, but they didn\'t despise the government like the Marxists hoped they would.\n\n**I see. So what did Gramsci propose?**\n\nHe divided the factors of state power into two. The state rules by two methods: by maintaining **coercion** and **consent.**\n\nWhat is coercion? Simply put, coercion is the use of force and economic sanction on part of the government to maintain power. Shutting down farmers\' protest in countryside Maharashtra by a lathi-charge? Coercion. Prosecuting you for seditious content and putting you in prison? Coercion. Firing you from your govt. job if you criticize a policy? Coercion. The state applies coercion by the use of what he termed the **political society**, which is constituted by the armed forces, the police, the judiciary, and so on. This much was known to the Marxists of his day.\n\nConsent, is an innovative – and very subversive – idea on Gramsci\'s part. It influences all modern thought on Marxism in the democratic countries today. Basically, consent , as conceived by Gramsci is the willingness of the citizens – the working class, mostly, but others as well – to *willingly be party to their exploitation by the state.* People fall in love with the state. They develop feelings of patriotism towards the state. They become loyal, fiercely so. How does the state do this? By something Gramsci called **political hegemony**\\*\\*\\*.\\*\\*\\* Here is political hegemony defined:\n\n“*the domination of a culturally diverse society by the ruling class who manipulate the culture of that society so that the ruling-class worldview becomes the accepted cultural norm, the universally valid dominant ideology, which justifies the social, political, and economic status quo as natural and inevitable, perpetual and beneficial for every social class, rather than as artificial social constructs that benefit only the ruling class.*”[iii](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote3sym)\n\nBasically, a large group of upper-to-middle-class people who subtly control the state come together and propagandize an ideology that justifies the suffering of the working/lower class by using democratic, religious, nationalistic, ethnic, linguistic, or any other means. The oppressed people are deceived into believing it, and don\'t revolt, instead consenting to the alleged oppression. Consent is generated through what Gramsci called the **civil society,** which are “the cultural institutions and practices that appear to be independent of politics, but in fact are not.*”* So television, religious festivals, the republic day parade, the daily national anthem at school, the Sanskrit language, all of that is propaganda on part of the state to get your consent.\n\n**Damn, that\'s ... interesting**.\n\nSounds strangely convicing, no? It seems to explain so much you see around you.\n\n**It kinda does, yeah. So ... if we relate this to India, then ...?**\n\nYes, so take the Bhagavad Gita. According to the Western Marxists, the philosophy of Bhagavad Gita is simply a bourgeois ideology used by the Brahmins to maintain hegemony, or power, over the other castes. “Devote yourself entirely to me, and thinking every action of yours a sacrifice, O Arjuna, perform your *dharma.”* An ideologue of Gramsci\'s thought might say that this is just a Brahmin ploy to maintain a social order that favours them. “Do your duty, don\'t concern yourself with questions of right and wrong, don\'t worry about all of those philosophical problems, go and kill your brothers.” And of course, if a Dalit reads the Gita, the message that he is supposed to glean from it is, “Do your duty, even if it is cleaning after other people\'s excreta.”\n\nNow, of course, such a convenient analysis straw-mans the Gita, and ignores all the sublimity of the scripture. It ignores the fact that this idea of surrendering your will to God is not a hegemonic ploy uniquely attributable to the Hindu scripture, but a constant motif of ancient philosophical thought. Stoicism, for instance, a mostly secular sect of Greece and hellenestic Rome, suggests surrendering your will to the Gods, and performing what is under your control, and leaving everything else to nature. It\'s a doctrine that, among other things, aims to remove the doubts and fears that curtail our action when we are too attached to victory or loss to really do what needs to be done, to actually try our best to achieve our objective. God, or Gods, can be read here to mean that part of nature that is beyond your control, that even with all our knowledge of science, is still beyond our grasp. Krishna\'s idea is not to hegemonize Arjuna, but to point out the existential rationalizations Arjuna is engaging in to justify his unwillingness to fight because he\'s too attached to his brothers, even when *they\'re exploting him*.\n\nBut if you will find exploitation in everything if that is only what you look for. This is not to deny that religious authorities have justified exploitation by referring to Gods, but to say that that is not the gist of all *sanskriti*. *Sanskriti* would by its nature – because it is a reflection of the society -- incorporate elements of all aspects of the society, from the depths of depravity to the heights of sublimity, and you will find in it what you look for. The idea is to look at --\n\n**But you digress. This is not a discussion about the value of tradition. Let\'s perhaps stick to Western Marxism.**\n\nYes, right. The point is, a Gramscian theorist would see attempt at exploitative propaganda in all forms of culture and political ideology. The idea of Britain, its literature, its nationalism, its protestant religious identity, its pride, its democratic traditions all the way from Magna Carta to the modern times, is seen as a popular disguise, to feed false satisfaction into the people so that they do not revolt.\n\nMoreover, identities of nation, religion, language, etc. disable people from marching to the beat of the drum of class-consciousness. If I\'m an industrial worker and you\'re an industrial worker, but I\'m Hindu and you\'re Muslim, or you speak Tamil and I speak Urdu, and we\'re particularly proud of these idenities, we\'re less likely to unite as a class to fight against the “bourgeoisie.”\n\n**And so you\'re saying that the idea of India, its ancient civilization, its philosophy, its Hindu cultural identity, is thought by western marxists a kind of propaganda to generate consent to oppress the lower classes by the Brahmins?**\n\nYes, something like that. That is why they deride everything that remotely relates to the Hindu tradition. The Indians Gods are taboo-ed, caste-strife is exaggerated, the Hindu religious identity is stigmatized. Hell, Kalidasa\'s poetry and drama, which is one of the best works of literature ever produced, is barely mentioned by the intellectuals. We barely are aware of the achievements of our civilization. All this, because they think its a hegemonic ploy by the upper-classes to rule the state. Thus you have NDTV ridiculing the search for the Saraswati river – which is a perfectly genuine historical inquiry – and P.K. ridiculing Lord Shiva, and a Barkha Dutt and a Rajdeep Sardesai making fun of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam for saying something favourable to the idea of India, and other innumerable instances like that.\n\n**But why that doesn\'t explain why the left is so lenient towards Islam. After all, if religion is a hegemonic strategy, then Islam ought to be considered one of the most oppressive hegemonic ideologies there are. Why is that not stigmatised?**\n\nSeveral reasons. The most important being this:\n\nIndia, in the near future at least, is liable to nationalism founded on the Hindu identity. Nationalism, just like religion, is anathema to Marxism, since nationalism is precisely what led to its failure in western europe. By pointing repeatedly to the historic faults of Hinduism, sometimes real, but mostly imagined, the idea is to break down any possibility of national pride, so that India remains susceptible to increasing Marxist order. Hindu stigma is very important for the left in India, since it is the only thing that stands between them and nationalism. Once the Hindus really come into their own, learning of their past, learning of the crimes that have been committed upon them, the fierce pride and anger will likely obliterate the marxist left-wing.\n\n**Yes, but why not criticize Islam equally?**\n\nBecause there is no threat of Muslim nationalism in India in the near future. At the most, if the demographic ratio shifts against the Hindus, it will eliminate the possibility of Hindu nationalism within current Indian borders. Since nationalism is based on historical memory[iv](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote4sym), and what is a matter of pride to Muslims is a matter of embarassment to Hindus and vice versa, you can be sure that a skewed demographic ratio will remove the possibility of any nationalism altogether. What, then, will remain? Either a weak state maintaining the present borders, in which case it will increasingly look to an outside, international government to conduct its affairs, or it will disintegrate into a number of non-cooperating states that will individually be too weak for their respective nationalisms to pose any threat to a globalist left-wing order.\n\nThis is also partly why a blind eye is turned to the excesses of Islam committed by the immigrants in the Western countries as well. The greater the proportion of people in your nation-state that don\'t share the common historical memories vital for national pride, the weaker the state becomes, and the more susceptible to global intervention. That is one reason why anti-immigration laws are so vehemently opposed by the left.\n\nHere is another critical idea by the Gramsci that explains the blindness of the left towards Islam\'s excesses. Gramsci, in proposing a solution to dealing the cultural hegemony of the ruling class, proposed the idea of the **working-class hegemony.** This is a political and cultural alliance led by the marxism intellectuals, of course, and composed of what he termed ***subalterns***, i.e. All those groups that are not part of or loosely part of the dominant hegemony. So, in the Indian context, this would mean trying to recruit first and foremost the Muslims, then – constantly failing to, but still trying – the scheduled castes, the Kashmiris, and so on. This also includes subversive acts such as trying to promote Sikh separatism, getting it to clash with the state, and then recruiting it into the working-class hegemony.\n\nWith regards to Islam, the following tenet of Gramsci\'s thought is the most pertinent: “to genuinely represent the subalterns the working class hegemony has to take seriously their practices and values, *even if they\'re not progressive”*[*v*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote5sym). This, in the Indian context means that, in order to suppress the **dominant ideology** which is the Hindu tradition, Islam has to be accepted by the left with all its anti-progressive elements: the intolerance, the terrorism, the expansionism, the archaic codes for women, and so on. This, simply because, in India, Islam is the biggest member of the alliance of the working-class hegemony.\n\n**I see. But clearly, Islam is not susceptible to the Marxist ideology. It aims for an order derived from the sharia, not from Marxism. To what extent then is this alliance compatible?**\n\nIn their ideologies they are antithetical. Islam as it currently stands, and as it is likely to stand in the future, will never accept the Marxist ideology. Both Islam and modern Marxism are fundamentally non-nationalist, imperialist orders (even though for expedience they subscribe temporarily to these orders). Marxism strives for an internationalist order based on class-consciousness and rule of the proletariat, while Islam looks to extend the sphere of influence of the *ummah*, the global Muslim community, by whatever pragmatic means possible, even if it is nationalism[vi](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote6sym). On the world scale, they\'re competitors rather than allies. But, in terms of the short-term goals they want to achieve, i.e. the defeat of nationalism (that co-incidentally, is based on Hindu historical identity in India), they form a perfect alliance serving mutual interests. In European countries, you will historically see political organizations suffixed “Popular Front”, which is generally an alliance of all left-wing parties within a country. The left-liberal-islamic nexus is just that suited to the Indian sociopolitical climate.\n\n**I understand your point. I see how this alliance might work. But still it seems a bit unreasonable to suggest that all the students on the road, protesting in the universities, all the media personnel, the newspapers, the magazines, would do all of what you describe with such calculated intention. Maybe they really are just coming from a place of humanistic concern.**\n\nI agree. But here you must pay attention to a crucial analogy: there are foot-soldiers in a battle, and then there are the generals, above them is the head-of-state, and often propping his or her power is the public. The reason why the solider fights is not the same reason the general fights, and that is not the same reason why the head-of-state goes to war, and the reason the public supports or condemns the battle might yet be different. The head-of-state might have a personal interest, the general might be fighting for glory, the soldier for duty, and the public might be supporting the war because of perceived or real injustice on part of the adversary.\n\nIt is the same with any ideology. The academicians, the professors of Marxism deeply versed in the Gramscian and other Marxist thought, the media figureheads who\'ve sprung from the universities where this thought is taught, might be promulgating their ideology with complete awareness of what they are doing. Some of the people studying it might also be aware. But the bulk of the public perhaps is fighting because it does not know. It has had it drilled into its head the values of “minority protection” and “Hindutva fascism” and “constitutional values” -- which, by the way, they simply use to flout legal precedents and launch into judicial activism – and the public might just be fighting now out of a sense of perceived injustice that they think the Hindus are inflicting on imaginary targets. That, and that the penetration of Marxist values into the cultural domain – the civil society, to use Gramsci\'s terminology – has ensured that such protestations are considered cool and righteous.\n\n**Also, Gramsci died in the early 1930s, what makes you say that his ideology is still active currently?**\n\nI\'ll name you some ideological currents that derive heavily from his thought, and have moved much farther in terms of their sophistication and competence at weakening nationalisms. Admittedly I\'m only sufficiently-versed with Gramsci\'s thought, having not read with much depth the other schools. But they are:\n\nThe **Frankfurt School**. First Marxist school to be set up in a democratic society, in Germany. Horkheimer, Adorno, and Marcuse are its primary figures. This school came up with the subject of **critical theory**, which is a euphemism for an “ideological effort of representatives of Frankfurt School to challenge all previously accepted standards in every aspect of societal life from a Marxist perspective.”[vii](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote7sym) Critical theory is a mandatory course in English Literature deparments, and also History departments lately.\n\nRudi Dutschke and his slogan “long march through the institutions,” which was his notion of subverting society by infilitrating academia, beauracracy, media, and so on over a long period of time. This started happening in the 60s and 70s, and has now reached the zenith, with the left-wing inside all prominent institutions that are responsible for maintaining civil society.\n\nIn India, I can recall a few instances off the top of my head. The Subaltern school of history (which has, admittedly, had some credible historians too), of which Sudipto Kaviraj is a prominent figure, is influenced by Gramscian Marxism. Kaviraj believes that the idea of India was created in the 19th century with the British colonial state (conveniently forgetting Arrian, Megasthenes, Al-Biruni, and so many other ancient sources that define India as a definite geographical and cultural entity). Yogendra Yadav is a disciple of his. Then of course you have the journalist nexus, which I\'m sure I don\'t need to spell out.\n\n**So to come back to the initial point ...**\n\nTo come back to the initial point, which started this conversation. The reason that the left is omitting the crimes against Hindus and portraying the Hindus as evil in their narrative does not come out of misunderstanding, or a lack of knowledge on their part (“Maybe they just don\'t know what is happening. Maybe because they live in their ivory towers they\'re not acquainted with reality. If only they come to hinterland, to the towns in the lives of the common people, they would understand ...”). Nope, this is part of well-thought-out ideology that has been institutionalized all over the world, with added verve in the democratic countries.\n\nIndian nationalism will have to fight a strong pitched battle against it. The media will not cover your riots for you. It will not cover both sides. It is biased, certainly, but who are you complaining of the bias to? Objectivity is merely a front, behind which is a left-wing agenda being worked at with tremendous intensity. It is sad that most foot-soldiers of the left-wing might not even be aware of the ideology they\'re promoting, but they\'re doing it nonetheless, and have to be equally be countered.\n\n**And how do you propose Indians stand their defenses against it?**\n\nAs with all battles, it starts with recognizing the enemy. People generally think of Islamism as the threat. I do not deny it. But Islamism is a visible threat, it is something that is so obvious you can\'t help but respond against it. Left-wing subversion is something that is a lot more devious. It\'s hazy, concealed, garbed in the costumes of secularism and superior humanistic morality, and unless you\'re educated in the subject, you can\'t even point to where and how it is taking place.\n\nWhat is fortunate, however, is that the model for social analysis that the left has figured out are not exclusive to it. Gramsci\'s thought, stripped of its prescriptive values and used solely for its general model of the society, can just as well be put to serve the nationalist objective. The left, using these models, has been successful in reaching the top echelons of the civil society. There is no reason why the right can\'t use it to further their objectives.\n\nOne *can* use the concepts of consent, hegemony, dominant ideology, and so on to see where we\'re at. The left has been very successful in manufacturing consent [viii](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote8sym) of the college students, and they\'ve done it by manipulating the civil society: by infiltrating culture, the movies, the books, the newspapers. Once we\'re sensitive to it, we can issue a counter-propaganda campaign. One can and should borrow from one\'s foes that which can use to one\'s own advantage.\n\nOther than that, I do not know. I am yet to study the rules of political organization and agitation (which again, I will learn from the Marxists, and who\'ve specialized in this area for over a century and a half now; and also, Islam with its centralized mosque-maulvi-fatwa network [ix](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote9sym)). Indians are clearly bad at political organization, and this reflects itself not only in the civil society – compare what a weak crowd we\'ve been able to muster in favour of the CAA to how many people actually support it, the supporters-to-demonstrators ratio is pathetic – but also in the political diplomatic scenario (see, our failure to negotiate to our advantage in the Kashmir dispute)[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote10sym) Self-education helps.\n\nAnd that\'s about it. For those who reached till the end, I hope you found something informative here.

<li>Title: 'Koschen for chodi citizens'<br />Body: 'Recently I have seen hatred against Sikhs on this sub. Why? Are Sikhs out there killing Hindus? Are Sikhs breaking temples? Is Sikh theology at odds with Sanatana Dharma?\n\nNot that Sikhs are perfect, no one is. Behaviour of certain Sikhs is atrocious, to say the least. But try and understand why that is. It is only because over the last century or so, Hindu civilization has been on its knees. And I hate to break it to you, but no one wants to stick around with losers. \n\nThis shouldn’t mean that Sikhs are our civilizational enemies, they are potential allies. And we don’t need to suck up to them, as soon as they sense us being strong, they’ll come around. \n\nMy suggestion to Hindus is to maintain a respectful distance from Sikhs till that day comes. Don’t go around crying hoarse ‘Hindu Sikh bhai bhai’, and don’t go around abusing them either. Be pragmatic. If a Sikh says “Hindu Sikh bhai bhai” welcome him with open arms. Any Sikh who doesn’t associate with Sanatana Dharma, just don’t associate with them either. Flooding them with responses about how similar we are only shows us as weak and desperate. We shouldn’t be. We are going to win, and that won’t come about by bending the knee to anyone. Be proud Hindus, and people will flock to you automatically. \n\nThoughts?'<br />Author: 'Faltu_Account13'<br />id: 'fc5ybx'<br />Flair :Research</li>

Like you search their history/ post history there is nothing before December. \n\nAdd fuel to the fire even pages on IG and Facebook suddenly sprang up putting up graphics from unknown artist which most likely were hired to help propagate misinformation.\n\nExample:\n\nhttps://instagram.com/sanghsational?igshid=v4ct2xqvts54\n\nhttps://instagram.com/jamun_ka_ped?igshid=g45bymq634wy\n\nhttps://instagram.com/shaheenbaghoff1?igshid=el2a39e44k6\n\nhttps://instagram.com/thepeopleofind?igshid=1gk4xaq0j1pzx\n\nhttps://instagram.com/creativesagainstcaa?igshid=gytedk8fek6a\n\nhttps://instagram.com/art.of.resistance?igshid=1ovnvbcthb5ya\n\n Then these bot accounts/ newly created accounts became active on these pages and started sharing the post from these accounts to spread misinformation.\n\n\n Upon doing further research I think I might have stumbled upon the entire left leaning gang that started the Anti CAA stir and the misinformation campaign. All of them are connected. Surprisingly these people are all followed by that pages that were created out of the blue in December. Note these people most likely get funding from the outside or within too. All of them have a graphic art page and from there the art is shared via the pages I posted above.
