ISLAM&gt;CHINTUISM /s\n\n Surah 2, verse 282 of the Qur‚Äôan   \n\n\n&gt;And get two witnesses out of your own men. And if there are not two men (available), then a man and two women, such as you agree for witnesses, so that if one of them (one of the two women) errs, the other can remind her.\n\nThe Qur‚Äôan says that, if two men aren‚Äôt available as witnesses, then get a man and two women. Here we find the Islamic principle that the ***testimony of a woman is worth half the testimony of a man***. Why is this? Muhammad explains in Sahih al-Bukhari, where he says that the testimony of a woman is only half as reliable as a man‚Äôs testimony because ***women are intellectually deficient***. They‚Äôre stupid.  \n\n\nThis view of the reliability of a woman‚Äôs testimony has made it enormously difficult for Muslim women to testify against men in court. According to the New York Times, human rights workers have noted that as many as half of the women who report being raped in Pakistan are charged with adultery.  \n\n\nAnother disturbing verses is Surah 2, verse 223, where Allah tells Muslim men:  \n\n\n&gt;Your wives are a tilth for you; so go to your tilth when or how you will . . .\n\nWe don‚Äôt use the word ‚Äútilth‚Äù much nowadays. A ‚Äútilth‚Äù is a patch of ground that you plow so you can sow your seed. The Qur‚Äôan says that ***women are a tilth that you approach whenever and however you want***.  \n\n\nThe historical background of this verse, according to Sunan Abu Dawud, is that when Muslims moved to Medina, they began marrying women from Medina, and the women of Medina didn‚Äôt want to have sex in certain positions. One woman told her husband not to come near her if he wanted sex in these positions. She said, ‚ÄúStay away from me if you want me to do that.‚Äù The issue was brought to Muhammad, and Allah‚Äôs response was Surah 2, verse 223: ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs your tilth, your field for sowing your seed; ***plow her however you want***.‚Äù Notice, the ***wife has no right to refuse her husband‚Äôs sexual desires***.  \n\n\nLet‚Äôs consider one more verse. Some women aren‚Äôt as quick to obey their husbands as Allah and Muhammad demand, so what are Muslim men supposed to do about rebellious wives? Allah answers in Surah 4, verse 34:  \n\n\n&gt;Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other, and because they spend of their property (for the support of women). So good women are obedient, guarding in secret that which Allah hath guarded. As for those from whom you fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them to beds apart, and scourge them. Then if they obey you, seek not a way against them.\n\n***If your wife doesn‚Äôt obey you, you warn her, banish her to a separate bed, and beat her*** until she does what you say.  \n\n\nA study by Human Rights Watch reports that more than 85% of Afghan women are victims of physical, sexual, or psychological violence or forced marriage, and that more than 60 percent are victims of multiple forms of violence? Why? Because of the Qur‚Äôan.  \n\n\nAccording to Allah and Muhammad, women are ***stupid***; they‚Äôre the ***property of men*** and have to submit themselves fully to their husbands‚Äô sexual whims; those who don‚Äôt are to be beaten into submission. Numerous studies show the real-world impact of these teachings. And yet we‚Äôre told, by politicians, reporters, librandus  and Muslim groups that the discrimination against women in Muslim countries has nothing to do with Islam. But as long as people refuse to confront the actual problem, women in Muslim countries will continue to suffer.'<br />Author: 'MeinChutiya69'<br />id: 'lgsvik'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: 'u/VPTABHR ka koi alt Account hai?'<br />Body: 'Bhot mahino se dikh nahi raha uska ID bhi nahi horaha :(('<br />Author: 'leaveMeAlonePlease_'<br />id: 'lgsb53'<br />Flair :Low Effort Shitpost ü§≥</li><li>Title: 'NSFW subreddits defaming Hindu community in a bad way'<br />Body: 'There is a subreddit called r/hinduslutsmuclimcock which posts pics with Nsfw Captions, some posts promote rape.

Since there is no such thing as MSP in the world, it will be very difficult to make it a law.\n\n2. If MSP is made a law, it would mean the right to msp. Rn, around 6% of farmers get msp. Law would mean that the govt would have to buy from all the farmers. It may sound all nice to you on surface but if you look deeper, you'll realise the problem. Currently 6% farmers benefit from MSP.\n\n3. The Budget of India this year was 32,000 billion. There are 23 crops under MSP and there are 145 million Farmers.\n\nWhen MSP is a law and is a Guarantee, govt will spend 17,000 BILLION per year on just MSP. That's 53%of the budget!  ARE YOU SAYING THAT INDIA SHOULD SPEND 53% OF ITS TOTAL EARNING ON BUYING CROPS? Govt will have to increase tax by 3 times\n\n4. Govt will be forced to purchase very bad quality food that will ultimately be distributed to the poor. Are you fine with govt buying rotten food to be stored with good food cause govt will be forced to buy em and store em? \n\n5. WTO is already up in arms about MSP and considers MSP bad subsidy.

I have read that a person always cultivates his political orientation on the basis of the social superstructure he comes across during his early age. Social superstructure means informal institution like family, relative, schools, locality and sorrounding institutions. And also his experience with these does have prominent role in shaping his political opinion. For example a privileged class in the political structure tends to be supportive of that structure like a king/queen royal family tends to support monarchial ideology as a whole. You can also relate it to recent protests of farm bills (Jaat Hindus/Sikh farmers who were prosperous in status quos, are now against the new farm reforms). Similarly the person who had bad experience with Muslims in childhood and teenage tends to have non secular political orientation. The person who had good experiences with Muslims and Christians in teenage tends to have secular orientation in adult stage. The role of schools, family and relatives also plays role in shaping political opinion of the individual. Hence I want you to answer few Questions:-\n  1. Is your parents left wing or right wing?Are your parents and other relatives are religious or liberal in nature. Please explain in details.\n2. Which kind of Ideology was prevalent in your school (like leftists-convent school, rightists- saraswati sushi Vidya Mandir, DAV). Please explain in details (ideology of your teachers, students)\n3.

War will last 25 days and South India will be struck too. Tibet and PoK might be liberated.'<br />Body: "This writeup is based on the video [Results of Indo-China war in 2021] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTiIlP9SEV8). It was released in September 2020, when China was anticipating an Indian strike. The astrologer predicted then that war will not take place in October but rather in the Feb-April 2021 period. This is also the time when weather conditions are favourable for military action at Ladakh. Coincidentally, it's also when the tide at the Taiwan strait is conducive to sea-based invasion. 2021 is an important milestone in the CCP's history, and capturing/invading Taiwan has been on the cards for a long time.\n\nI know that not everybody believes in astrology, but this perspective needs to be heard. Also, I am not Sambit (the uploader) and tbh I think his latest comments on the video sound rather unhinged. Anyway, his video is in English and he speaks logically. He spends the first 8 minutes explaining that astrology is not a scam before getting to his predictions.\n\nAccording to astrology and its calculations, based on the timing and location of India and China's respective independence days, the positions of the stars, planets, et cetera, China will attack not in Ladakh but in Arunachal first. Shortly after, missiles will rain down on targets in South India. These can come from long-range missiles and Chinese naval ships but also from hypersonic weapons. Hypersonic weapons in the PLA's arsenal [can reach Bangalore in 20 minutes] (https://nationalinterest.org/feature/five-chinese-weapons-war-india-should-fear-10774). Third, war will begin at Ladakh.\n\nAccording to the astrologer, war will last for 25 days. There will be huge casualties on both sides. Pakistan will also attack and lose Gilgit-Baltistan. There's also a chance of Tibet being liberated.\n\nI will add my own input: China and Pakistan may coordinate terrorist attacks that will happen in a matter of weeks. These may be made to look indigenous. The Delhi riots anniversary is coming up and Pakistan's 'ISIS' plot to kill Indians was busted in January of last year. This year, with or without Pakistani/Chinese assistance, there is a high likelihood of Islamist attacks. Some publications refer to the Delhi incidents as an 'anti-Hindu' riot but the fact remains that most of the victims and burnt houses of worship were Muslim. (I am not denying the crimes and conspiracy of Tahir Hussain and Umar Khalid). So, everyone, please be careful. Save the phone numbers of the police stations near your home and workplace to your contacts so that you can report any suspicious events/persons.

From blatant opposition to Trump by big-tech to ignoring Bernie and actual Left of US and how it relates to India Here are my thoughts.\n\nThe current attack on "BJP" from west isn\'t related to the policies or the actual ground work of BJP as hardly any critical person would call it\'s policies and laws inherently bad or discriminatory. Neither the attack is on "India" as many would like to believe from \'Indic\' side. It\'s basically a war against Nationalism. \n\nAfter the second world war, the Nationalism in Germany and Italy was defeated by "Liberal Democracy" and "Communism". And after 1991, it was a ideological win for  "Liberal Democracy". If you look into recent history, there hasn\'t been any "Nationalist" president of US besides Trump. We all looked how everyone ganged to take him down. Was it because there was a liking for actual economical left? No. If that was the case, Bernie would be in the white house and not Biden.\n\nBut now the question arises why even be against \'Nationalism\' in the first place, why didn\'t west changed it\'s strategy and who is even against Nationalism? The answer is Nationalism is the only think standing against Globalists that want to break the barrier between countries. Nationalists are harder to deal with, as they will keep the country paramount. The only way for Rich to become more richer now is to gain more control over other countries, be it through lobbying or by helping politically and remember most of these rich people are in west. It is reflected on how the wall street who is economically right donated for Biden and not the "Right-winged" Trump. Most of the coups have happened only for the benefit of rich in west and the inward strategy of Trump wasn\'t liked by \'The Rich\'.\n\nModi is a Nationalist, that is hidden to no one. He has banned Chinese apps and even Facebook Free Basics. The only thing standing against this "Neo-colonalism" form west deep state is the sense of Nationalism with Aatm-Nirbharta and stuff. If tomorrow some party comes with more Nationalism, it would be criticized. We Indians realized it way to late about the British impact on India, this can be one of those things. It strange how Richie rich of west suddenly from being a colonizer turned to a bastian of democracy and human rights.

As Ambedkar observed,a Hindu uc is bound to shit on Hindu Dalits but would love Muslims."<br />Author: 'treesisnicesoothing'<br />id: 'lcjy6u'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Madaraschaap/Randian : How many members do you have Chodi Mod :'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'lcjt09'<br />Flair ::oc-: OC ‡§π‡•à BC!üí°</li><li>Title: 'Inspired by Mia Khalifa'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'lcjsdw'<br />Flair :Wholesome Bakchodi :danklaugh:</li><li>Title: 'Lavde ke farmers hai bc'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'lcjqta'<br />Flair ::oc-: OC ‡§π‡•à BC!üí°</li><li>Title: 'Lavde ke farmers hai bc'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'lcjnc5'<br />Flair ::oc-: OC ‡§π‡•à BC!üí°</li><li>Title: 'Lavde ke farmers hai bc'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'lcjkzu'<br />Flair ::oc-: OC ‡§π‡•à BC!üí°</li><li>Title: 'Once a Suar always a Suar'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'lcjiyr'<br />Flair :Removed-09-LowEff:stop:</li><li>Title: "How come know one is talking about Greta's link and their hypocrisy."<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'kagurachan9748'<br />id: 'lcjf1l'<br />Flair :Removed-09-LowEff:stop:</li><li>Title: 'Question from a Raita(pseudo-hindu) on conversion to viraat ideology'<br />Body: "I sometimes become a Viraat and on some days become a libr@ndu.

At least that is what I think.\n\nAlmost all of us are in a position to file a complaint in the local police station.  We just don't know how.\n\nI want to complain about the tweets which are creating divisions in the society and spreading false information and are harmful.  But i don't know the language to use to ensure that the complaint is treated in priority.\n\nThe left coordinates on such issues.  Gretas google doc was just one small piece of evidence.\n\nWe hindus need to coordinate on this.  and we can do so openly.\n\nIf some lawyer type people can pick an issue and post on chodi the full text of a complaint, and give the directions as to what to do (take a print out on plain paper, sign your name, attach a photocopy of your aadhar card etc, and go to the nearest police station and hand it over to the officer of such and such rank and take a receipt, and pay 1500 rupees filing fee, etc. etc. --- i am writing all of that wrong, but i want to give example of what the instructions should look like)... i am sure that many of us will follow it.\n\nI am not well aware of how the legal system works.  If instead of this, I need to go to a lawyer then I will do that.  Just tell me what to do/say.\n\nPlease create a flair - LEGAL ACTION - and give a 'legal team' flair to certain users, and let us start this."<br />Author: 'mussanmix'<br />id: 'lciorh'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Number of internet shutdowns'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'lcigzs'<br />Flair ::news: Unverified</li><li>Title: 'BJP spokespersons and media anchors calling anti-Modi panelists "Mia Khalifa ka fan" is just Indian media at its funniest...'<br />Body: "It's kinda hard to keep a straight face in front of parents though!"<br />Author: 'lightaniruddhe2000'<br />id: 'lci5g5'<br />Flair :Poli-tickle Bakchodi ü§£</li><li>Title: 'What is up with Indiaspeaks sub simping for Sikhs ?'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'treesisnicesoothing'<br />id: 'lci52t'<br />Flair :Removed-05-noMeta:stop:</li><li>Title: 'Any Assamese viraat who could suggest a good book on Lachit Barphukan'<br />Body: "(‚óè'‚ó°'‚óè)"<br />Author: 'helloworld090'<br />id: 'lci4au'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: '[Khayali pulao thoughts] There should be a meme of hindu rashtra intensifies, just like mother Russia meme with communism songs'<br />Body: 'Basically same as title'<br />Author: 'okbrok'<br />id: 'lci40c'<br />Flair :Low Effort Shitpost ü§≥</li><li>Title: 'merko to aisa dhak dhak horela hai'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'lci0qz'<br />Flair :Low Effort Shitpost ü§≥</li><li>Title: 'mereko to esa dhak dhak horela hai'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'lchweo'<br />Flair :Low Effort Shitpost ü§≥</li><li>Title: 'You guys know any more poems like this?'<br />Body: 'Do rupee ki pepsi .\nX bhaiya sexy.\n\nOr \n\nX bhaiya change.\nRaat ko soye nange.'<br />Author: 'KingOStingt'<br />id: 'lchvf7'<br />Flair :Toonmeme :kappa:</li><li>Title: 'big OOF'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'lchkfy'<br />Flair :Removed-07-LowQua:stop:</li><li>Title: "Tried posting this on r/India but I'm sure it wont get approved there"<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'indiactivist'<br />id: 'lchfad'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: 'Remembered an old post on reddit about farm subsidies.'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'lcheig'<br />Flair :Laal Salaam :commiehand:</li><li>Title: 'Greta'<br />Body: 'So greta thunberg has literally been caught red handed with a plot to de- stabilize India and yet no international media outlet cares.We are losing the war of narratives so bad and Indophobia is rising at unprecedented rates.Sad üò£.What do we do from here?'<br />Author: 'Himalayan-Pagan69'<br />id: 'lche9n'<br />Flair :Indo-International üì∞</li><li>Title: 'I just got a new card'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'lch2pi'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: "This was the idiot who posted that propaganda piece in worldnews which twisted the Greta Thunberg farmer protest tweet.

It was to create a new normal where Violent Protest become normalised. Shaheen Bagh was Beta test while this is the Version 1. Any sane State would have uprooted everything that undermines its Monopoly on Violemce. But Chacha wants to Noball prize. We are paying for their cowardice. West loves to use Democracy meme to undermine Majority snd empower Traitors in non white nations. Its given.\n\n2. Not many people know that we are producing too much grains and sugarcane which environmentally bad for us in long run with how erratic our Climate has become. Also the State gives incentive to harm the Air (stubble burning), water table(excessive use, rice/sugarcane), Free Electricity (wastage &amp; lead to Business paying higher tariffs to reduce losses), Soil(excessive use of fertilizer)\n\nWe are exporting our water.\n\nWhat Farm laws will do is that Farmers will start moving towards Vegetables which grows rapidly and has higher prices compared to Grains. This can easily solve our import of many Vegetables and can turn us into leading Exporter. With these laws more Cold warehouses and Food processing units will open as India has truly become 1 single market. West doesn't like it as it is major exporter of many Agricultural products. So to protect its Farmers is funding this insidious protests. Imagine Farmers growing legumes/dal instead of Rice, how much they'll earn? Same goes for vegetables.\n\nWe have highly fertile soil, 4 seasons and very low Wages so we can easily compete with West even when they've technology. We have more arable land so we can compete with them on total production if not on yield. This is what West fears as we will be able to undermine them and become major Exporter of agricultural products.\n\nFor reference when Chins banned US's Soyabean, US cried like a 2 year old.\n\nAlso it will increase the Farmer's Income multifold as with increase in Warehouses &amp; Cold Storage the prices will stabilise which will help both farmers and us consumers. \n\nAlso with cheap and easy availability of Insurance Schemes, Irrigation (Drip &amp; Canal), Seeds, Manures, Fertilizer, Power etc farming will effectively become risk free thus more men will have confidence to leave farming and try to get into Service &amp; Manufacturing sector. Lower risk will help farmers in availing grearer credit as they know what income they'll earn from their Produce. Women can take care of Farms and Men can go to city, which will increase their household income.\n\nAlso food processing units will unlock great value of our local products, take Makhaana for example which is grown in Seemanchal. Until few years ago not many people used to eat it but now it is one of the Superfood and the farmers are selling it at high price. We will be able to see a great and favourable change within few years, don't need to wait for even a decade.\n\n\nMy point being this is right hill for Modi to dye and unleash full blown asssaultt on Opposition."<br />Author: 'AwdheshMishra'<br />id: 'lcg3pp'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'We need a proper Twitter account for this page ASAP!!!'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Acoolusername001'<br />id: 'lcg27o'<br />Flair :Removed-05-noMeta:stop:</li><li>Title: 'I was free so i tried to get the ip address of the contect mails from the toolkit'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'lcg16v'<br />Flair :Removed-01-noHaxx:stop:</li></ol>
