<li>Title: 'When someone tells you Hindus just defend - Remind them of the Hindu conqueror Rajendra Chola'<br />Body: "Dharmics always like to say they never went to war. They just fought when someone invaded them. The invaders called themselves conquerors with pride. But that was ok. Hindus were not conquerors. They fought back when invaded. Never mind the fact that the entire area from Afghanisthan to Burma were followers of Dharma. But Hindus were nice and docile. This narrative has contributed massively to the mental constitution of Hindus.\n\nThis narrative is what has led to the marginalization of the greatest Hindu **conqueror** \\- Rajendra Chola I, the son of the great Chola emperor Raja Raja Chola. The man who commanded a force of sixty thousand elephants. The man who reached the banks of the Ganga to take her water back to perform abhisheka at the Bridhadeeshwara temple. The man with an impressive navy that allowed him to spread Dharma all the way to Maldives, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The man who was the commander in chief of his own army leading the force from the front in true warrior fashion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img xg4b4hktagh61...*\n\nHe built numerous temples to Shiva, Vishnu and even Buddhist viharas. He also built Gangaikonda Cholapuram among many other temples. Contrary to some claims designed to split Hindus, he never destroyed places of worship from other faiths or even other sects. Kanchipuram's ancient temples and viharas are a testament to this.\n\nDear Hindus, no matter what your persuasion, I ask you one thing. Today, you bow your heads for a second in adoration, respect, or prayer to this great Emperor who spread Dharma. This king of kings who was written out of the history books. This Hindu conqueror.\n\nAnd when someone tells you that Hindus were not conquerors, imagine this son of Dharma charging with his army of 2 million cavalry units and 60,000 elephants..."<br />Author: 'dharmavaan'<br />id: 'ljp243'<br />Flair :Viraat Sanatani🚩</li>

<li>Title: 'Kampanna Udayar - The legendary Sanatani warrior who stood up to the barbaric Madurai Sultanate'<br />Body: "The story of one of bravest sons of Dharma has been written out of the collective consciousness of the Hindus.\n\nMadurai - the seat of Hindus in the south. The most beautiful temple city. A city where Sangam literature thrived. The sound of tiruppugazh and thiruvasagam rendering the air in the evenings along the beautiful holy river Tamaraparani. All this ended when the forces of the Delhi sultantae invaded Madurai. Malik Kafur the eunuch servant/general of Khilji invaded Madurai in 1311. The Meenakshi Amman temple was destroyed. Only one of the gopurams stood the remaining three demolished. Srirangam was captured and desecrated. The Madurai sultanate was established by Jalaluddin. The atrocities began.\n\nIbn Batuta, a Muslim traveled to Madurai in around 1340 BC. He speaks thusly of the atrocities of the killed Ghiyasuddin Dhamagani. Here are his excerpts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The Hindu prisoners were divided into four sections and taken to each of the four gates of the great catcar. There, on the stakes they had carried, the prisoners were impaled. Afterwards their wives were killed and tied by their hair to these pales. Little children were massacred on the bosoms of their mothers and their corpses left there. Then, the camp was raised, and they started cutting down the trees of another forest. In the same manner did they treat their later Hindu prisoners.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;One day whilst the Kadhi (Kazi) and I were having our food with (Ghiyazu-d-din), the Kazi to his right and I to his left, an infidel was brought before him accompanied by his wife and son aged seven years. The Sultan made a sign with his hand to the executioners to cut off the head of this man ; then he said to them in Arabic : 'and the son and the wife.' They cut off their heads and I turned my eyes away. When I looked again, I saw their heads lying on the ground.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost of us cannot even comprehend this evil. A more depraved bunch we could not envision. At that point most Hindus had lost hope. But as always, on the side of Dharma a warrior arose. The son of Emperor Bukka of Vijayanagara - Kumara Kampana Udaiyar. The warrior who would stand up nay charge against this incredible evil. The warrior who would risk it all to put an end to this evil and restore Dharma.\n\nHis exploits are chronicled in Madura Vijayam an epic poem. Legend says that he was visited by an old woman when he was in Kanchipuram. She implored him to liberate South India from the sultanate. More importantly, she asked him liberate the Meenakshi Amman temple and restore its sanctity. The prince decided. He would stand up to the barbarians. He would rescue Madurai. He would personally battle this evil.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis meant going to war against the barbarians and in modern day terms a group more psychotic than ISIS . Bukka and Kampana knew well what would happen to the prince in the event of a defeat. But prince Kampana in modern parlance was a badass - a legendary one at that backed by Dharma. Legend (and we Hindus for sure dismiss it as myth) says that the prince received a sword from the goddess Gangadevi.\n\nKampana began the battle. Troops of the Sultan fell in scores and finally the sultan himself arrived to fight. In an epic combat, Kampana destroyed the banner of the sultan, then the bowstring of the sultan. Finally, he beheaded the sultan. This is recounted in Madura Vijayam\n\n**The sultan incandescent with ire flung his bow and seized a fearsome sword. King Kampa in turn took hold of his sword sent to him by Agastya to vanquish the king, a blade dreadful as the dark lord of death. Kampa riding at a great gallop lpped off the sultan's head with his sword. The head of the sultan that had bowed to none now lay on the ground.**\n\nA fitting end for the evil tyrants. Kampa and the other vijayanagara Kings then restored the Srirangam temple and finally gained possession of Madurai.\n\nThis man was a Viraat Sanatani - in the words of you youngsters a legendary badass. \n\nThis prince who stood up to an unparalleled force of evil. This prince who spent his life battling for the adherents of Dharma whose descendants (though 1 billion in number) chose to throw him out of their collective conscious.

And those who indulge in it will either go to hell or reborn as animals which is where there rightful place is so that they can indulge in free sex. \n\nThe prime reason for people ousted from Brahmin and Kshtraiya Varna was sexual morality . People who indulged in sexual immoral behavior were classified as lower caste and animals.\n\nIf Hinduism approves of sex outside of marriage then why do you think Hinduism is strictly against widow remarriage even if a woman is widowed at the age of 16 , she can't remarry. The reason is sexual purity and that a woman who has indulged in sex with one man is considered as impure and unfit for marriage .\nThis shows that in Hinduism sexual purity of woman is of prime importance. \n\nHinduism in no way approves of premarital sex.

<li>Title: 'The sub is going to shit. (Written only with good intent)'<br />Body: "I joined this sub, like many others, as an escape and lightweight contrast to the existing irrational left-wing bias on reddit and the usual India bashing on the website. It was refreshing to say the least, the memes were interesting, and the content was, at least 50 percent stemming from the truth, even when funny. \n\nAs the pinned message indicates, this is probably the most participated Indian sub on Reddit. Which is great for the regular centrist/RW leaning individual to visit.\n\nHowever, lately I have started observing that there is an influx of the whatsapp, facebook janta of India, which really deepfries the content presented here, and even the thin veil of respect, or acknowledgement is dissapearing.\n\nThe sheer treatment of other religions on here, makes me ashamed to call myself an emergent of Hinduism. I am not an Islam/Christian apologist, not even close (check my comment history), but dehumanising any group of people IS the first step towards fascism. It might note for you, but it WILL be for the 100s of participants joining in from Whatsapp and Facebook. Will they be able to show the same restraint?\n\nI read somewhere on Reddit, where they compared this sub with Donald, it was honestly heartbreaking, because I realise that the need and content of this sub is stemming from a reactionary standpoint where 'enough is enough' is a common underlying theme.\n\nI understand that we can see biases taking place in our country day-in day-out, I can see our friends getting braindrained due to Western propaganda, but calling them out in a way which makes them feel inhumane, worthless, will get you exactly the opposite of what you're trying to achieve. This is the same mistake that led to the Presidentship of Trump, because the left couldn't unite well and ended up creating so much differences amongst themselves that the problems still persist even under the administration of Biden.\n\nThe TLDR of this long rant is probably this, if you want to make jokes/memes, make intelligent ones, that don't make the sub seem like fanatical place for hindu radicals(believe it or not, it does seem like the case right now). The agitations in the country will lead to the influx of more rural and toughened whatsapp janta, if there is no reigning in of content right now, we will surely witness the definition of Hindu extremism very soon. And from what I know, Hinduism isn't about that.

You had a deep disdain for them before and found material from people online to justify it. Many upper caste people are poor, but they don’t have the option of blaming others for oppression. The poor Rajput isn’t doing much better off than his Lohar counterpart. \n\n**Why would a shudra be a proud Hindu**\n\nBecause he is attached to his kul, sanskar and is a bhakt of his ishtadev like any other Hindu. Temple entry is a legal right. Only in villages where each family/gotra has their separate devta are other castes not allowed to worship in the inner sanctum. \n\n**intercaste marriages will solve casteism**\n\nNo it won’t and thinking along these lines is working to destroy caste identities altogether, which is disastrous for Hindu civilization. In my opinion, if it happens, it’s all well and fine, but no need to promote it.\n\n**reservation is needed, only casteists oppose it**\n\nLol.

So today I was scrolling on my Instagram feed and I kid you not, I saw 2 Instagram influencers (Hindu girls) from the US who got married to Pakistani guys. I was like fuck! people come here to marry white guys and these girls found only Pakistanis to marry? \n\nThen it got me thinking… I have Pakistani friends here… and as friends, they are some of the friendliest people. I am not joking… 2 of my close friends are Pakistanis and I have got nothing but respect from them and have given them respect as well. Ofcourse there are plenty of chutiyas here as well but we come from respected neighborhoods and families and these guys are absolutely amazing.\n\nSo what are their plus points? They are very serious about their health and body, good looking, very friendly and talk to people with respect and are family oriented. So naturally girls will like them.\n\nNow I am not saying that Hindu guys are not like that, we are like that as well but we tend to act like assholes plus unlike muslims, we don’t give too much importance to Hinduism or have never bothered to learn about it. \n\nThe other issue is that we have this fucking caste system. FUCKING CASTE SYSTEM.. I have never lived in India so I have no clue whats my cast… Heck even my parents are not sure about their caste now. But Indians coming from there are too fucking concerned about caste system. I have a west Indian (Guyanese) neighbor who is getting engaged to a Pakistani guy.. yeah these fucks are plentiful here. When she was in Uni, she dated a North Indian dude from Delhi. But this asshole’s stupid parents wanted him to get married to someone of his caste. Are you fucking kidding me? You cant tolerate someone who is not your caste but will then start shitting on them if they get married to someone who is disbeliever of Lord Krishna?! \n\nBtw she is 5 years older to me or I would have definitely dated her\n\nMan we need to change ourselves if we want people to respect us and our religion!\n\n1.

<li>Title: 'A few questions for Upper caste Hindus.'<br />Body: 'Hello all, I come here in peace. I am a lower caste Hindu, but I am not really a believer. This is not a sub I’d usually be in, but someone recommended that I discuss my experiences with others and get their opinions. The aim of this post is not to offend anyone, and I apologize in advance if this post were to be construed as offensive by some people. \n\nOver the last few years on social media, I have had certain experiences that have made me dislike Upper caste Hindus quite a lot. I did not grow up hating upper castes, even though my friends and classmates in school always joked about how easy life was going to be for me(cause reservations). I always assumed this to be light hearted ribbing among friends. \n\nAll this changed when I joined social media. Over the last few years, I have routinely faced casteist abuse(people telling to clean sewers like my ancestors, even though my family members were milkmen), I have been told how “my kind” want to trap upper caste girls(as if love happens only after knowing someone’s caste), I have been told how my people are only good for being slaves, and how women from my community can only be wh*res for UC men. \n\nWhen I first started receiving such abuse, I would always ask the abuser if not all Hindus were part of the Brahman? Wasn’t caste decided by your karma?\n\nThe responses I got for these questions were along the lines of:\n1. Caste is by birth alone, Krishna himself says your birth is decided by karma of your past lives. \n2. A shudra can only serve the other 3 varnas, him taking over roles of other varna will lead him to hell. \n\nThese were bitter pills to swallow. Who wants to live life as an indentured servant? Not me. And I doubt any else does either. Why shouldn’t I as a shudra not try to seek wealth? Why shouldn’t I try to achieve a life as comfortable as possible?\n\nIn response to these enquiries of mine, someone said(I will be repeating what they said in Hindi, I don’t know if I can translate this):”यह संसार केवल ब्राह्मणों के भोग के लिए है, एक शूद्र होने के नाते तुम्हारा कर्तव्य है ब्राह्मणों की सेवा करना, इसी मार्ग के द्वारा तुम अगले जन्म में उच्च जाति में जन्म लेके संसार भोग सकोगे।”\n\nNow that I have shared some of my life experiences, I seriously want to ask all of you, why should I support Hinduism if Hinduism wants to me to become an unpaid slave? Why should I oppose Dr Ambedkar and reservations if they have given me a chance at a respectable life? Why should I stand together with upper castes, if you don’t even consider me an equal? \n\nThanks for allowing me to share my thoughts, I did not mean any malice towards anyone. I don’t hate upper castes(or anyone else for that matter), but I don’t really like you guys either.'<br />Author: 'kaizaki_arata_'<br />id: 'lir2wh'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
<li>Title: 'Brothers, help me understand this...'<br />Body: "Why would a guy decide to live separately away from his parents after getting married?\n\nLiving in another city for a job is understandable but if you are working in the same city why would you waste your money on buying another property? Living with your parents is the best way to control your wife and take care of your parents and have more savings. She gets busy with house chores and won't have time for feminist bullshits, while you can have ample amount of freedom to sleep with other women(if you are into that) or maybe do anything else you want, maybe a small side business. You get to have the cake and eat it too. Why on earth will a guy give that up to live separately with his wife? Is it due to a scarcity mindset? If your girlfriend isn't willing to take care of your parents then you can just ditch her and not marry her. She will find it more difficult at that age to get married and that too with that attitude. She's basically used goods at that point."<br />Author: 'mullisSalivatemydick'<br />id: 'liotom'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Dear, Ram Bhakts(❁´◡`❁) today I am here to introduce to you the Pancharatna Kriti. These are harsh times and music is the best solution for hurting the soul. Here are the greatest masterpieces of music that are all composed by pure bhakti and spirituality. I urge you all to give this listen🕉 ♪(´▽｀)'<br />Body: ' The ***Pancharatna kritis***  ([Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit): *pancha* "five" + *ratna* "gems") are a set of five [*kritis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti) (songs) in [Carnatic classical music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_classical_music), composed by the 18th-century Indian composer [Tyagaraja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyagaraja). All the *kritis*, as is the case with almost all of Tyagaraja\'s compositions, are penned in [Telugu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language), except the first one, which is composed in [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n \n\n### Jagadānanda kārakā\n\nIn this song, Tyagaraja praises [Ramachandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramachandra), one of the incarnations of Lord [Vishnu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu). He eulogizes [Ramachandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramachandra) as one who is the cause of all bliss in the universe. This is the only *Pancharatna Kriti* that was composed in [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit). All the other *kritis* were composed in [Telugu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language), which was used in the court of the Maratha king [Sarabhoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serfoji_II) who ruled this area in the 18th century. Rama was Tyagaraja\'s favorite god.\n\n### Duḍukugala nannē dora koḍuku brōchurā yentō\n\nIn this second *Pancharatna Kriti* composed in [Telugu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language), Tyagaraja lists all the errors he has committed in his life and asks who but Rama could redeem such a sinner. The sins described include: just wandering around as though being satisfied with a full meal, giving sermons to people who are not interested in listening or who do not have the capability to understand, self-styling oneself as a great person, and mistaking the dross for the real thing. He lists four categories of people to whom he has made the claim of greatness; the ignorant, the riff-raff, the low social folk, and women. In a play on words, he reproaches those who desire wives and progeny.\n\n### Sādhinchane ō manasā\n\nThis *Pancharatna Kriti* was composed in [Telugu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language) and has been set to Arabhi raga. It is written in a playful tone, rich with metaphor and simile without a surfeit of adjectives - all the while arresting the attention of the singers. In this *kriti*, Tyagaraja sings the greatness of Lord [Krishna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna) in a lucid manner. The style adopted in this *kriti* is very sweet in comparison with the other four.\n\n### Kana kana ruci rā kanaka vasana ninnu\n\nThis is the least sung or performed of the five *Pancharatna Kritis* composed in [Telugu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language), but it is considered by some to be the most haunting and beautiful. It describes the divine beauty of Sri Rama, whom Tyagaraja worshiped. He says that the more he \\[Tyagaraja\\] looks upon His beautiful features, the more his mind is attracted to Him. This composition is rarely taught and rarely heard in concerts, owing to the raga it is set in, Varali.\n\n### Endarō mahānubhāvulu\n\n*Endarō mahānubhāvulu* is believed to be one of the earlier *kritis* Tyagaraja composed in [Telugu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language). The song is a salutation to and praise of all the great saints and musicians down the ages. Tyagaraja clearly delineates and lists the *Mahanubhavalu*, or great ones, in the *kriti* itself, mentioning the saints Narada and Saunaka, among others. In this poem, Tyagaraja describes the greatness of devotees of the Lord. The belief in [Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala) and [Tamil Nadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu) is that Tyagaraja composed the *kriti* spontaneously in his joy upon hearing the divine music of the [Malayali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayali) singer [Shadkala Govinda Marar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadkala_Govinda_Marar). But according to the Walajapet disciples\' version of the origin of the *kriti*, it was composed and learnt by Tyagaraja\'s disciples before the arrival of Marar. This, according to P. T. Narendra Menon, was the legendary, historically significant meeting between two great musicians. Since *Endharo mahanubhavalu* is said to have been composed by Tyagaraja at a young age, it is possible that after hearing Marar sing and in appreciation of the greatness of Marar, Tyagaraja could have asked his disciples to sing the *kriti* on this occasion. Humility is the foundation of all.'<br />Author: 'Euphoric_Dimension62'<br />id: 'lijv5r'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>

Modi says to the talent agent, “Sir, I have an amazing act, I know if you would let me perform it for you, you would want to sign me.” And the talent agent says, “Sorry, we don’t sign fascist cucks, they\'re too fucking whiney about everything and if we don\'t spend all day telling them how smart and special they are they start plotting genocides.” But then Modi goes, “Please sir, if you just give me two minutes I know you’ll like my act.” So the talent agent says “Alright, ya got two minutes.”\n\nSo Modi jumps right into it. He smiles his hits “play” on a boombox. Thrilling circus music starts to play as Modi bends over between his legs, lifts up his skirt, and starts licking his own asshole. Then, in an incredible feat of skill and coordination, Modi pulls his head back slightly and fires a liquid stream of shit directly into is own mouth. He swallows half of it, and sprays the other half back into the air like a fountain, covering the ceiling in regurgitated diarrhea. \n\nNext Modi lays down on the floor and pulls a large snapping turtle out of the suitcase. Modi rips his clothing off entirely and shoves his penis into the mouth of the snapping turtle, which immediately bites it off, causing a jet of blood and gore to launch from his pelvis. Modi rolls around in the flood of viscera as his liquid shit continues to drip back down from the ceiling. Somehow, despite losing his penis, Modi achieves orgasm in the middle of this display.\n\nThen Modi jumps up and says “And now for my impersonation of The Exodus of Kashmiri Hindus!” Modi starts running around the room screaming and laughing with his dickless pelvis and nutsack and asshole all flapping around covered with shit and piss and cum going “Aaaaugh! Aaaugh! Some Muslims were mean to us! Help!”\n\nAnd finally the Modi runs back to the center of the room and goes “TA-DAAAA!!”\n\nAnd the talent agent he just sits there for the longest time, and finally he says, “Jesus, that’s a hell of an act.

<li>Title: 'What Hindus should do now?'<br />Body: "Rinku Sharma's death made me realise we are sitting on a ticking time bomb. Sorry to break the news but if we keep sleeping as we are now, Hinduism will become extinct by fifty years.\n\n1. This is for especially young men. Choose a particular day and visit your nearby temple in group. The mistake Hindus are doing since the beginning is separating religion from politics. No doubt, we offer prayers and visit temples but only on individual level. Though some senior citizen visit temples in group but I've seldom seen young men visiting temple in groups. \n\n2. Be unapologetic about your Hindu identity: People from peaceful religion don't hesitate to go for nimaz during office time, but due to influence of missionary schools, if a Hindu wears kalawa or has tilak it's considered against discipline. Wear kalawa and tilak without any hesitation. Keep a picture of Ram Darbar, Shiv Ji, Ganesh Ji in your cubicle or as screen wallpaper.\n\n3. Adopt two language policy: To make it easy to communicate, learn two languages Hindi from north India and Telugu/Kannada from south India.\n\n4. Make people (both men and women) more masculine and less concerned about things like love, booze, party: Ok, you may downvote me for this, but have you ever thought about the purpose of festivals like Muharram where boys break tubelights with their heads, walk on pieces of glass or burning coal. The purpose is to make them physically and mentally strong and prepared to tolerate pain for their aim. Bollywood is leaving no stone unturned for subliminal messaging that you only need love to fulfil you and the ideal of metrosexual.\n\n5. Don't virtue signal- Two days ago, I came across a comment on the sub that Bajrang dal members are incels that's why they disturb lovey dovey couples during Valentine's day. Dude! It's Bajrang dal members who are sacrificing their lives for our cause. We find flaws in everyone who supports the Hindu cause then wonder why there's no Indic ecosystem. Bhai Taliban rule ayega to public places me lovey dovey karne par seedhe patthar milenge. In the pursuit of absolute freedom, we are giving ourselves for slavery.\n\n6. Don't be dependent on government: Kuchh bhi hota hai to we blame on government but peacefuls have more purusharth than us. They are not dependent on government that's why with even BJP at centre, they have stronger case.

<li>Title: 'ISLAM IS BETTER FOR WOMEN THAN HINDUISM, KAAFIR! /s'<br />Body: 'so what if the following factual evidence is quoted from the scriptures of islam? ISLAM&gt;CHINTUISM /s\n\n Surah 2, verse 282 of the Qur’an   \n\n\n&gt;And get two witnesses out of your own men. And if there are not two men (available), then a man and two women, such as you agree for witnesses, so that if one of them (one of the two women) errs, the other can remind her.\n\nThe Qur’an says that, if two men aren’t available as witnesses, then get a man and two women. Here we find the Islamic principle that the ***testimony of a woman is worth half the testimony of a man***. Why is this? Muhammad explains in Sahih al-Bukhari, where he says that the testimony of a woman is only half as reliable as a man’s testimony because ***women are intellectually deficient***. They’re stupid.  \n\n\nThis view of the reliability of a woman’s testimony has made it enormously difficult for Muslim women to testify against men in court. According to the New York Times, human rights workers have noted that as many as half of the women who report being raped in Pakistan are charged with adultery.  \n\n\nAnother disturbing verses is Surah 2, verse 223, where Allah tells Muslim men:  \n\n\n&gt;Your wives are a tilth for you; so go to your tilth when or how you will . . .\n\nWe don’t use the word “tilth” much nowadays. A “tilth” is a patch of ground that you plow so you can sow your seed. The Qur’an says that ***women are a tilth that you approach whenever and however you want***.  \n\n\nThe historical background of this verse, according to Sunan Abu Dawud, is that when Muslims moved to Medina, they began marrying women from Medina, and the women of Medina didn’t want to have sex in certain positions. One woman told her husband not to come near her if he wanted sex in these positions. She said, “Stay away from me if you want me to do that.” The issue was brought to Muhammad, and Allah’s response was Surah 2, verse 223: “She’s your tilth, your field for sowing your seed; ***plow her however you want***.” Notice, the ***wife has no right to refuse her husband’s sexual desires***.  \n\n\nLet’s consider one more verse. Some women aren’t as quick to obey their husbands as Allah and Muhammad demand, so what are Muslim men supposed to do about rebellious wives? Allah answers in Surah 4, verse 34:  \n\n\n&gt;Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other, and because they spend of their property (for the support of women). So good women are obedient, guarding in secret that which Allah hath guarded. As for those from whom you fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them to beds apart, and scourge them. Then if they obey you, seek not a way against them.\n\n***If your wife doesn’t obey you, you warn her, banish her to a separate bed, and beat her*** until she does what you say.  \n\n\nA study by Human Rights Watch reports that more than 85% of Afghan women are victims of physical, sexual, or psychological violence or forced marriage, and that more than 60 percent are victims of multiple forms of violence? Why? Because of the Qur’an.  \n\n\nAccording to Allah and Muhammad, women are ***stupid***; they’re the ***property of men*** and have to submit themselves fully to their husbands’ sexual whims; those who don’t are to be beaten into submission. Numerous studies show the real-world impact of these teachings. And yet we’re told, by politicians, reporters, librandus  and Muslim groups that the discrimination against women in Muslim countries has nothing to do with Islam. But as long as people refuse to confront the actual problem, women in Muslim countries will continue to suffer.'<br />Author: 'MeinChutiya69'<br />id: 'lgsvik'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

<li>Title: 'Why MSP cannot be made into a law'<br />Body: "These are a no of reason why MSP can't be a law as per my opinion:\n\n1. Since there is no such thing as MSP in the world, it will be very difficult to make it a law.\n\n2. If MSP is made a law, it would mean the right to msp. Rn, around 6% of farmers get msp. Law would mean that the govt would have to buy from all the farmers. It may sound all nice to you on surface but if you look deeper, you'll realise the problem. Currently 6% farmers benefit from MSP.\n\n3. The Budget of India this year was 32,000 billion. There are 23 crops under MSP and there are 145 million Farmers.\n\nWhen MSP is a law and is a Guarantee, govt will spend 17,000 BILLION per year on just MSP. That's 53%of the budget!  ARE YOU SAYING THAT INDIA SHOULD SPEND 53% OF ITS TOTAL EARNING ON BUYING CROPS? Govt will have to increase tax by 3 times\n\n4. Govt will be forced to purchase very bad quality food that will ultimately be distributed to the poor. Are you fine with govt buying rotten food to be stored with good food cause govt will be forced to buy em and store em? \n\n5. WTO is already up in arms about MSP and considers MSP bad subsidy. What will happen when msp is law is export will fall and India would loose precious foreign exchange.\n\n\nAnd argument against or pov of others are welcome"<br />Author: 'RIPAaron_FuckSpez'<br />id: 'lfz0ta'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Tell us your political culture.'<br />Body: 'As I am a political science student, fortunately. I have read that a person always cultivates his political orientation on the basis of the social superstructure he comes across during his early age. Social superstructure means informal institution like family, relative, schools, locality and sorrounding institutions. And also his experience with these does have prominent role in shaping his political opinion. For example a privileged class in the political structure tends to be supportive of that structure like a king/queen royal family tends to support monarchial ideology as a whole. You can also relate it to recent protests of farm bills (Jaat Hindus/Sikh farmers who were prosperous in status quos, are now against the new farm reforms). Similarly the person who had bad experience with Muslims in childhood and teenage tends to have non secular political orientation. The person who had good experiences with Muslims and Christians in teenage tends to have secular orientation in adult stage. The role of schools, family and relatives also plays role in shaping political opinion of the individual. Hence I want you to answer few Questions:-\n  1. Is your parents left wing or right wing?Are your parents and other relatives are religious or liberal in nature. Please explain in details.\n2. Which kind of Ideology was prevalent in your school (like leftists-convent school, rightists- saraswati sushi Vidya Mandir, DAV). Please explain in details (ideology of your teachers, students)\n3. Are you ex-secular? If yes, what instances triggered you to support right wing?

<li>Title: 'According to Vedic astrologers, China will attack this month or in March and April. War will last 25 days and South India will be struck too. Tibet and PoK might be liberated.'<br />Body: "This writeup is based on the video [Results of Indo-China war in 2021] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTiIlP9SEV8). It was released in September 2020, when China was anticipating an Indian strike. The astrologer predicted then that war will not take place in October but rather in the Feb-April 2021 period. This is also the time when weather conditions are favourable for military action at Ladakh. Coincidentally, it's also when the tide at the Taiwan strait is conducive to sea-based invasion. 2021 is an important milestone in the CCP's history, and capturing/invading Taiwan has been on the cards for a long time.\n\nI know that not everybody believes in astrology, but this perspective needs to be heard. Also, I am not Sambit (the uploader) and tbh I think his latest comments on the video sound rather unhinged. Anyway, his video is in English and he speaks logically. He spends the first 8 minutes explaining that astrology is not a scam before getting to his predictions.\n\nAccording to astrology and its calculations, based on the timing and location of India and China's respective independence days, the positions of the stars, planets, et cetera, China will attack not in Ladakh but in Arunachal first. Shortly after, missiles will rain down on targets in South India. These can come from long-range missiles and Chinese naval ships but also from hypersonic weapons. Hypersonic weapons in the PLA's arsenal [can reach Bangalore in 20 minutes] (https://nationalinterest.org/feature/five-chinese-weapons-war-india-should-fear-10774). Third, war will begin at Ladakh.\n\nAccording to the astrologer, war will last for 25 days. There will be huge casualties on both sides. Pakistan will also attack and lose Gilgit-Baltistan. There's also a chance of Tibet being liberated.\n\nI will add my own input: China and Pakistan may coordinate terrorist attacks that will happen in a matter of weeks. These may be made to look indigenous. The Delhi riots anniversary is coming up and Pakistan's 'ISIS' plot to kill Indians was busted in January of last year. This year, with or without Pakistani/Chinese assistance, there is a high likelihood of Islamist attacks. Some publications refer to the Delhi incidents as an 'anti-Hindu' riot but the fact remains that most of the victims and burnt houses of worship were Muslim. (I am not denying the crimes and conspiracy of Tahir Hussain and Umar Khalid). So, everyone, please be careful. Save the phone numbers of the police stations near your home and workplace to your contacts so that you can report any suspicious events/persons.

They are being threatened by the fact that Hindus have united. And they do not relate with Hindus as much as Hindus relate with them.  Let us comfort them by saying that we Love Sikhs, and support farmers, and the bills are beneficial to them; no matter what they say. We CANNOT be divided. They are our civilizational brothers.\n\nAnd trust me, there is extremely low Khalistan sentiment in India. And whatever it is there, it is foreign funded and some radical Sikhs. Rest is simply a blackmail tactic. They do know that Khalistan is not a viable thing because\n\n1. 20 years from now, Punjab's water table would be depleted, who would help them? Who would buy their agri products, if there would be any(the only thing they produce)?\n2. Punjab would be a landlocked country, no access to sea, with obvious enemy, India. It would be another Afghanistan, Nepal or Mongolia.\n3. Where would they buy all the cheap industrial products and services? China would still be expensive? MP has already smoked them in wheat production, will they be able to compete in International market with India?\n4. How would they access Patna Sahib and all the religious places in India?\n5. What would happen to all the Sikhs residing in all the parts of India, what about their business and property?\n\nThis Khalistani thing is nothing but a Blackmail tactic, like Nagas, Arunachal, Kashmir etc. Love them, but call their bluff factually.  Also, 1984 should not be forgotten, it was a blunder, and Sikhs have still not got justice. Modi has opened criminal cases again, but lets see. Why is Jagdish tytler still out? Seriously congress has made some serious blunders.\n\nOn the other hand Sikhs have some real social issues like\n\n1. Caste superiority complex, you can hear in all their songs, and they dont even consider it something bad.\n\n2.Highest landless farmers in India are in Punjab.\n\n3.Biggest center of pesticide related cancers in India.\n\n4.
