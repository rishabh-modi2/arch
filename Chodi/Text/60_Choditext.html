<ol><li>Title: 'தமிழ் Imposition - 4!!'<br />Body: '*Source of all these images is my phone camera.*\n\nThis is a special imposition. It is not really Tamil language imposition, but Tamil Nadu related stuff imposition.  \n\nRecently I went to Thanjavur Periya Kovil, (Kovil means temple) and Gangaikonda Cholapuram (it was not named after King Rajendra I, who is also known by the title Gangai Konda Cholan, or one who conquered the ganges). \n\nChola rulers were patrons of the arts and architecture . They built the  temple of Gangaikondacholisvara. The temple has sculptures of exceptional quality. The bronzes of  Bhogasakti and Subrahmanya are masterpieces of Chola metal icons. The  Saurapitha (Solar altar), the lotus altar with eight deities, is  considered auspicious. Most importantly, \n\n# The shiva lingam is made from single rock.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The temple of Gangai Konda Cholapuram, near Ariyalur district of Tamil Nadu ](https://preview.redd.it/ib94d8k1smw51.png?width=1215&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b415ea57ad1222b2abe0c27ba00b1b3aac8a382)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Nandi at Gangaikonda Cholapuram Temple](https://preview.redd.it/795ateqlsmw51.png?width=683&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c23ad535a1d91ca8c5fe02e08cde4c445670399a)\n\nThe Chola rulers constructed enormous stone temple complexes with  intricate carvings of Hindu gods. Rajaraja Chola-1 built the famous  Brihdrishvara temple at Thanjavur between 1003 and 1010 CE. Shiva is  worshipped here. The grandeur of this temple has not been diminished by  age. There is a massive statue of Nandi, the sacred bull of Shiva, in  the central courtyard of the temple. \n\nThe exquisite bronze statues of the Chola period are known the  world over for their grace and lifelike appearance. Many beautiful  figures of Nataraja, or the dancing Shiva, were made during the Chola  era. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Brihadeeshwara temple or Thanjai Periya Kovil, Thanjavur](https://preview.redd.it/20t1y6hxsmw51.png?width=683&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a24b41ba151fa2e685d389b65659daf4e1be951)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This particular horse sculpture alone shows how much effort they have put into in carving the structure.](https://preview.redd.it/c7m0pla2tmw51.png?width=1032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=636c8a3099c4e9eb22995513e5ed440d507fde8f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Bronze Nataraja Statue](https://preview.redd.it/ejorxyrctmw51.png?width=683&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1784c51cc79bfc30506742c1492852b763ece2c4)\n\nThe periya kovil has significant Maratha style constructions too under King Sarabhoji II, which may have been the reason for some dome-style structures within the temple.\n\nOverall this first-time visit to the two temples was extremely good and it made me wonder how such intricate structures had been carved back then in spite of lack of modern technology and how the engineering principles had been applied to the fullest along with creativity to bring out such a massive creation.\n\n தென்னாடுடைய சிவனே போற்றி!   \n எந்நாட்டவர்க்கும் இறைவா போற்றி!  \n\n(Try to interpret the last two lines without using google but with the previous impositions I posted)'<br />Author: 'R_Chodi_is_useless'<br />id: 'jm2i22'<br />Flair ::star: OC है बे </li><li>Title: 'can someone please change my ideology ?'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'okay_retard939'<br />id: 'jm1y2v'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'Privacy Advice'<br />Body: "If you are an active viraat people might try to doxx you using fake accounts and having a message or post with fake link for ip tracing or any other means.

So how do we counter it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is my first attempt to counter it and would love to hear more suggestions and would encourage you to do such experiments of your own as well. I have submitted this post to both Indian based left wing and right wing subs. If any of these subs are majorly controlled by any such paid for astroturfing mods this post won't see the light of day and I intend to note those subs. Some of them might not be in it for the money and genuinely believe in their cause but use the above mentioned techniques to manipulate general public opinion and sentiments which is still not acceptable.     \n\nThe subs where this post makes it to the readers are probably safe and are not worried about their members coming across this piece of information. If you read this post and it has managed to change your perception, then leave a comment just sighting the percentage of content you now believe to be an outcome of astroturfing on this particular sub. This post in itself a kind of litmus test for the subs I have posted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason for posting this right now is that 2020 has come to an end making it six years since 2014 and four years since 2017 but never have I seen Left vs Right so polarized in history. I believe the exact phenomena mentioned in the above video is responsible for this. The drift between Left wing and right wing is being cultivated and nurtured intentionally using techniques such as astroturfing. This particular scenario is very dangerous and can only be tackled by ensuring that the citizens are aware and have a rational mindset."<br />Author: '95_red'<br />id: 'jlr1yz'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li><li>Title: 'religion of piece'<br />Body: 'I am so fucking happy that finally world is uniting against this religion, earlier they just used to ignore them, but now everywhere u go, people are batshit crazy about islam! almost every subreddit whether be it left dominated is filled with posts bashing islam and making fun of asmani kirab god and that ayesha f*cker! the world needs to unite against this religion otherwise islam will be the reason for world war 3!\n\nhowever, what makes me sad is same Thing  is happening with Hindus in India from last few years, but there was no outrage in world! and when same thing happened in France, everyone now came to realize that islam is a violent religion?'<br />Author: 'imankit12'<br />id: 'jlp6kq'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'Found the meme to bust leftards and islamists .'<br />Body: '"Before you try to defend Islam, draw a picture of Muhammad and display it in public (or social media) first."\n\nyour job is done.most of their arguments fail in front of this one sentence.'<br />Author: 'kuchbhifeko'<br />id: 'jlnhv4'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li><li>Title: 'Trads ke liye koi subreddit hai kya ?

Ganesha has an elephant head. Narasimha is a lion. Hayagriva is horse headed. There is Varaha, a boar. Matsya, a fish. Kurma, a turtle. Hanuman, a monkey and Garuda, a bird. These animal headed gods make hinduism appear primitve and strange to the western mind, Make it subject to scrutiny and insult. But there are explenations for these apparently strange forms.\n\nThe first explenation of these forms can be through symbolism. Let\'s look at Ganesha for example.\n\nThe elephant head represents intelligence required to discriminate and grow. His ears represent that god is all knowing, and listens to all. The rope in his hand represents how he can pull us on the right path. A modakh in his hand symbolises sweet spiritual bliss which he can provide. His rat (which a major point of yours) represents the erratic  mind, which is difficult to control, and him comfortably riding it represents how we too can control our own mind with all the above qualities.\n\nThese are all qualities which Ganesha is known to give, which is why they are part of his apperance.\n\nAt this point many will surely ask. If these forms are symbolic, are they not fiction?\n\nThis question can be answered here. In hinduism, there is ultimately one formless, supreme Brahman. This Brahman takes increasingly specific forms for increasingly specific purposes. The purpose of Ganesha, let us say, is to remove obstacles. As I have said, Ganesha\'s form is akin to that which he can give us. So, if the unmanifest Brahman can continue to manifest as Ganesha to devotees, though his form being symbolic, It would not be entirely right to call him fiction.\n\nHowever, this argument is still unconvincing to some. So, there can indeed be an entirely different approach to the animalistic gods.\n\nThis is especially true for Hindus who believe that such forms are for the weakminded and that symbolism is their ultimate meaning. Instead of recognising that Ganesha is a divine personality, he is simply\n\nWe can still say, that these forms exist to remind us that we must expand a limited understanding of god. Take Arjuna for example, who had a very limited understanding of god in the Gita, and to show him the true scale of what god is, Krishna proudly proclaims that he is present in every part of nature.\n\nIt shows us how God is truly everywhere, and there is no part of the world where he is not present.\n\nKnowing, this these animalistic forms of god can be interpreted as us celebrating that same reality, knowing that god is truly boundless, and there are no limits to his nature.\n\nKnowing this, rather than jumping to symbolism, why can\'t we instead answer with another question. "Is there a problem with Ganesha\'s head? If god is truly everywhere and manifest in any form, why not that of an elephant?"\n\nGod does not have any restriction on how he can be known. Hinduism recognises that god doesn\'t have to conform to what is considered as proper or conform to the conditions and judgments of the human mind. God can manifest in any form and this why even more unorthodox forms such as the Shaligramam or the Shiva linga are still worshipped and viewed as divine. In the Gita we hear Arjuna asking Krishna on how he can be known in this world. He responds:\n\n*Of mountains I am Meru..... Of immovable objects I am the Himalaya\'s...... Of Elephants I am Airavat, Among cows I am Surabhi..... Among Serpants I am Vasuki, Among beasts, I am the Lion, Of birds I am Garuda, of Fish I am the Shark, and of Rivers I am the Ganga (BG 10.23.31)*\n\nHe explains how who he really is is truly infinite. He is both part of the Universe, and beyond it.\n\nThis is why God is also represented as Animalistic. We can see through them that gods glory is everywhere, wherever we look, we can find him.\n\nBy accepting divinity in multiple and strange forms, we are then force to give up a fixed notion of god. We can thus see him in all places and can achieve an elevated concioussness.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.'<br />Author: 'Accomplished-Ad-6524'<br />id: 'jljf9f'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'Support your country over your kaum.

The editor has worked with the great V.T. Rajashekar earlier and we have been inspired by him.\xa0Apart from Babasaheb and Kancha Ilaiah, VTR is\xa0our greatest inspiration. We have had several talks with VTR when he visited Oxford University in England. We have also had lengthy and stimulating discussions with VTR at his residence at palace lower orchards in Bangalore.\n\n# \xa0Bunts are a backward caste and VTR has written about it. Bunts are\xa0 shudras. The oppressed people who have come from the feet of God. Aishwaraya proved to the world that she is the smartest and beautiful when she won the Miss World title. Brahmins the most cruel race in the world could never digest it. When Aishwarya Rai joined movies the brahmin and Bania toilet papers like Times of India, Hindu and Indian Express were seething with jealousy. They made claims that she does not know any acting. They always sided with their jatwallah actress like the maharistrian brahmins Madhuri Dixit and Sonali Bendre.\n\n# The wily\xa0upper caste people in Bollywood tried to set up Aishwarya Rai with the upper caste wallahs. But our Shudra sister Aishwarya never relented. It was during this time when she was harassed by these papans that Salman Khan rescued her. Salman Khan being a muslim wanted to get married to Aishwarya Rai and save her from the oppressive Hindu caste system. A system which has crushed and oppressed our men and especially women. But the upper caste wallahs started spreading all kinds of rumors about Salman Khan. They called him a cocaine addict. These brahmins can go to any length. They will tell what suits their need. Finally they implicated Salman Khan in a fake accident case. They split these two people so that Aishwarya can stay in the evil Hindu caste system. This is what all these upper caste people have been doing to Dalits so that they can never escape from their tyranny.\n\n# After this incident they did not leave Aishwarya alone. They hatched a conspiracy in UP and got the manuwadi Amar Singh to get Aishwarya married to Abhishek Bachan, a half upper caste sikh and brahmin. They even made Aishwarya marry a banana plant before this marriage. How these evil people oppress us there is no end. Aishwarya now no longer identifies with her Dalit brethren.

Thereafter, the following Mantra by the Rishi Medatithi Kanva be used as evidence that Arya women are supposed to cover their bodies, in all ages, ancient or modern. \n\nअ॒धः प॑श्यस्व॒ मोपरि॑ संत॒रां पा॑द॒कौ ह॑र।\n\nमा ते॑ कशप्ल॒कौ दृ॑श॒न्स्त्री हि ब्र॒ह्मा ब॒भूवि॑थ॥ \n\nadhaḥ paśyasva mopari santarāṃ pādakau hara | \nmā te kaṣaplakau dṛśan strī hi brahmā babhūvitha || \n\nहे स्त्री! तू सदा नीचे देखा कर, ऊपर मत देख, तू पैरों को ठीक से एकत्र करते हुए चल, तेरे कशप्लक अर्थात दोनों स्तन, पीठ और पेट, नितम्भ, दोनों जाँघे, और दोनों पिंढ़ीलियां (घुटने और ऐड़ी के बीच का भाग) दिखाई न दे। क्योंकि स्त्री ब्रह्मा, निर्माणकर्त्री हुई है। \n\nThe Mantra clearly states that women should cover their body - breasts, back, stomach, waist, buttocks, private parts, thighs, and legs ( uptil the ankles). Additionally they should walk with grace and decency, and not in an attention seeking behaviour. They should gaze downwards (simply not glance or eye contact with other random men). All this because woman is a miniature aspect of Brahma the creator, and like him she has the power to create (give birth). If women become corrupt, the creation itself will be hampered and corrupted.

I shall liberate you from all sins; do not fear (18.66)\n\n*Commentary*\n\n**All along, Shree Krishna had been asking Arjun to do two things simultaneously—engage his mind in devotion, and engage his body in fulfilling his material duty as a warrior. He thus wanted Arjun not to give up his Kshatriya** ***dharma*****, but to do devotion alongside with it. This is the principle of** ***karm yog*****. Now, Shree Krishna reverses this teaching by saying that here is no need to fulfill even material** ***dharma*****. Arjun can renounce all material duties and simply surrender to God. This is the principle of** ***karm sanyās*****. Here, one may question that if we give up all our material** ***dharmas*** **will we not incur sin? Shree Krishna tells Arjun not to fear; he will absolve him from all sins, and liberate him from material existence.**\n\n**To comprehend this instruction of Shree Krishna, we need to understand the term** ***dharma*****. It comes from the root word** ***dhṛi*****, which means** ***dhāraṇ karane yogya*****, or “responsibilities, duties, thoughts, and actions that are appropriate for us.” There are actually two kinds of** ***dharmas*****—material** ***dharma*** **and spiritual** ***dharma*****. These two kinds of** ***dharma*** **are based upon two different understandings of the “self.” When we identify ourselves as the body, then our** ***dharma*** **is determined in accordance with our bodily designations, obligations, duties, and norms. Hence, serving the bodily parents, fulfilling the responsibilities to society, nation, etc. are all bodily** ***dharma*****. This is also called** ***apara dharma*** **or material** ***dharma*****. This includes the** ***dharma*** **as a Brahmin, Kshatriya, etc. However, when we identify ourselves as the soul, we have no material designations of** ***varṇa*** **(social class) and** ***āśhram*** **(status in life). The soul’s Father, Mother, Friend, Beloved, and resting place are all God. Hence our one and only** ***dharma*** **becomes loving devotional service to God. This is also called** ***para dharma*** **or spiritual** ***dharma*****.**\n\n**If one leaves the material** ***dharma*** **it is considered a sin due to dereliction of duty. But if one leaves material** ***dharma*** **and takes the shelter of spiritual** ***dharma*****, it is not a sin. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states:**\n\n***devarṣhi-bhūtāpta-nṛiṇāṁ pitṝīṇāṁ na kiṅkaro nāyam ṛiṇī cha rājan***\n\n***sarvātmanā yaḥ śharaṇaṁ śharaṇyaṁ gato mukundaṁ parihṛitya kartam*** **(11.5.41)\\[v37\\]**\n\n**This verse explains that for those who do not surrender to God, there are five debts—to the celestial gods, to the sages, to the ancestors, to other humans, and to other living beings. The** ***varṇāśhram*** **system includes various procedures for releasing ourselves from these five kinds of debts. However, when we surrender to God, we are automatically released from all these debts, just as by watering the roots of a tree, all its branches, twigs, leaves, flowers, and fruit automatically get watered. Similarly, by fulfilling our duty to God, we automatically fulfill our duty to everyone. Hence, there is no sin in renouncing material** ***dharma*** **if we are properly situated in spiritual** ***dharma*****. In fact, the ultimate goal is to engage completely and wholeheartedly in spiritual** ***dharma*****. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states:**\n\n***ājñāyaivaṁ guṇān doṣhān mayādiṣhṭān api svakān***\n\n***dharmān santyajya yaḥ sarvān māṁ bhajeta sa tu sattamaḥ*** **(11.11.32) \\[v38\\]**\n\n**“I have given innumerable instructions regarding the performance of bodily** ***dharma*** **in the Vedas. But those who realize the shortcomings in these, and renounce all prescribed duties, to simply engage in my devotional service, I consider them to be the best** ***sādhaks*****.” In the Ramayan, we read how Lakshman renounced all material duties to accompany Lord Ram in the forest. He said:**\n\n***guru pitu mātu na jānahu kāhū, kahahu subhāū nātha patiyāū***\n\n***more sabahiñ eka tuma swāmī, dinabhandhu ura antarayamī*** **\\[v39\\]**\n\n**“O Lord, please believe me, I do not know any teacher, father, mother, etc. As far as I am concerned, you, the savior of the fallen and the knower of the heart, are my Master and my everything.” Similarly, Prahlad said:**\n\n***mātā nāsti pitā na ’sti na ’sti me swajano janaḥ*** **\\[v40\\]**  \n\n\n**“I do not know any mother, father, or relative (God is everything to me).”**\n\n**In the** ***Bhagavad Gita*****, Shree Krishna gave Arjun sequentially higher instructions. Initially, he instructed Arjun to do** ***karm*****, i.e. his material** ***dharma*** **as a warrior (verse 2.31). But material** ***dharma*** **does not result in God-realization; it leads to the celestial abodes, and once the pious merits are depleted one has to come back. Hence, Shree Krishna next instructed Arjun to do** ***karm yog*****, i.e. his material** ***dharma*** **with the body and spiritual** ***dharma*** **with the mind. He asked Arjun to fight the war with the body and remember God with the mind (verse 8.7). This instruction of** ***karm yog*** **forms the major portion of the** **Bhagavad Gita****. Now in the very end, Shree Krishna instructs Arjun to practice** ***karm sanyās*****, i.e. renounce all material** ***dharma*** **and simply adopt spiritual** ***dharma*****, which is love for God. He should thus fight, not because it is his duty as a warrior, but because God wants him to do so.**\n\nजय श्री कृष्णा\n\n जय श्री अर्जुन'<br />Author: 'Accomplished-Ad-6524'<br />id: 'jjpp6g'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'Kamlesh Tiwari was a cuck.'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'rock492'<br />id: 'jjorp2'<br />Flair ::shit: Shitpost</li><li>Title: 'Kamlesh Tiwari was a cuck.'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'rock492'<br />id: 'jjoqi6'<br />Flair ::shit: Shitpost</li><li>Title: '[SERIOUS] Chodi bhratas and bhaginis, how has been your experience with causal relationships and FWB?'<br />Body: 'basically this👆'<br />Author: 'sharmaJi_ki_rakhel'<br />id: 'jjngyt'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'Hear me out!'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'notshrawin'<br />id: 'jjmv3y'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'How will a Biden presidency affect India?'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'pandawarrior2000'<br />id: 'jjm5p0'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'We need to bring Apostasy and Blasphemy laws in India.'<br />Body: 'If we want to make Hinduism a strong religion then you need to bring Apostasy and Blasphemy laws in Hinduism and India where punishment for both these things will be death sentence.\n\nBecause just like any military can survive and stay united when there is a provision for death sentence for betrayal and for not obeying the command.

In this article, I would like to talk about said people, by explaining how their claims are faulty, at best.\n\nNote : This will be divided into parts, as it is, then easier for\xa0 both me and you.\n\n\nPart 1 : The influence of Liberals/Liberalism around India\n\n\nI would say the influence of liberalism, has further increased in the past few decades, but the idea behind it has been present since 1947. The thought of liberalism which infected India included hating on Hinduism, not saying anything about minority religions and never at all talking how the religions of Islam and Christianity are like leeches to this nation, which is slowly sucking\xa0 the blood out of it. This was the nation that the BJP inherited in 2014, that is the reason why the government wasn’t able to introduce any key bills, addressing the issue of Hindu inferiority.\n\n\nPart 2 : The absolute hate against Hinduism, by Hindus themselves.\n\n\nThe hate present in Hindus against their own religion, what a typical subject if I were to say so myself, something that the liberals, used for their own advantage. However, many ask, what’s the reason behind it, before telling the reason I would like to give an example. Language, what language am I using at the moment, the language of our very own invaders, yes, of course I would love to use the language of our land, Sanskrit, but why am I not using it? It is because the government, never saw a reason to teach me in a language I would understand for Shiva’s Sake. This is what clearly proves the root cause, the root cause being the absolute disinterest of the post-independence government in culture, language and even basic education. This is what has led to the disinterest of the nations children in preserving their religion, or even show the world how valuable it can be to everybody.\n\n\nPart 3, and the final Part : Why did BJP, come to power anyway?\n\n\nThis is very much a debatable topic, so feel free to disagree. But, I think we can agree on one thing, that The BJP came to power as they promised vikas, and an end to corruption, for once and for all. Though religion may have been a contributor, I can confirm it wasn’t the main reason. I would say religion was bigger of a contributor, in the 2019, general election, as compared to the previous one. The book, Messiah Modi proves my point quite well, as to how an Indian citizen in India, before 2014 was derived from basic needs like healthcare, food and clean drinking water.\n\n\nEnding Remarks :\xa0\n\nIf you have read my point by point rebuttal well, and if, for a period of time, we consider it the truth. Then we can come to a conclusion, that the environment of India, pre-2014 was filled with self-loathers who loved seeing the country as a pile of filth, rather than loving it as their very own Mother, and in an environment filled with this much garbage, the fact that the BJP was able to do what they did, even a fraction of it is,\n\nB R E A T H T A K I N G to say the least. I am not a complete Bhakt of the Bharatiya Janta Dal, but I think one thing that we can all do is, appreciate the amount of Hindutva, BJP was able to fuel into us all, and criticize the party at,every one of its hick-ups, as we only want the best for the nation.\n\nJai Hind!\n\nVande Mataram!'<br />Author: 'Generocide'<br />id: 'jjjopd'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'How prevalent is Manusmriti in our society today?'<br />Body: "It was just recently that I got to know about Manusmriti and it's alleged misogynistic ideology.

Reading through a few I understood that most if these articles are recycled and rely heavily upon western construct of feminism to dissect the script. Well, I'm not informed enough to have an opinion on whether it is indeed misogynistic or not(True Indology can help us with that), I just want to know if it truly exist within our society at this day of age.\n\nI asked women in my family if they have heard about Manusmriti and they had not. When I asked my grandfather, he did say he had heard about Manusmriti but had not read it. So this made me wonder, how much of our family dynamics is based on Manusmriti?

The tapati river flows through the town and he went to the river bank to a take a dip and do sandhayavandana and on his way back he was clad in the traditional dhoti with vibhooti on his forehead and as he was walking towards the car a lot of people that were there on the riverbank started saying pranam panditji. And he said pranam back to them and went on his way to the office.\n\nNow the point I'd like to make is that if there is a rampant amount of oppression, will normal people say pranam obviously no.

Everyone follows my path, knowingly or unknowingly, O son of Pritha. BG 4.11\n\n*Commentary*\n\nHere, Lord Krishna states that he reciprocates with everyone as they surrender to him. For those who deny the existence of God, he meets them in the form of the law of karma—he sits inside their hearts, notes their actions, and dispenses the results. But such atheists too cannot get away from serving him; they are obliged to serve God’s material energy, Maya, in its various apparitions, as wealth, luxuries, relatives, prestige, etc. Maya holds them under the sway of anger, lust, and greed. On the other hand, for those who turn their mind away from worldly attractions and look upon God as the goal and refuge, he takes care of them just as a mother takes care of her child.\n\nShree Krishna uses the word *bhajāmi*, which means “to serve.” He serves the surrendered souls, by destroying their accumulated karmas of endless lifetimes, cutting the bonds of Maya, removing the darkness of material existence, and bestowing divine bliss, divine knowledge, and divine love. And when the devotee learns to love God selflessly, he willingly enslaves himself to their love. Shree Ram thus tells Hanuman:\n\n*ekaikasyopakārasya prāṇān dāsyāsmi te kape*\n\n*śheṣhasyehopakārāṇāṁ bhavām ṛiṇino vayaṁ* (Vālmīki Ramayan)\\[v14\\]\n\n“O Hanuman, to release myself from the debt of one service you performed for me, I shall have to offer my life to you. For all the other devotional services done by you, I shall remain eternally indebted.” In this way, God reciprocates with everyone as they surrender to him.\n\n*If God is so merciful upon his devotees, why do some people worship the celestial gods instead? He explains in the following verse.*'<br />Author: 'Accomplished-Ad-6524'<br />id: 'jj0ct3'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'Astitv ki ladai mai, kai baar massomo ko bali chadna padta hai.'<br />Body: '*Note : Mai kisi bhi tarah se Hinduo par ho rahe julm ko justify nahi kar raha hu.*\n\n&gt;Love Jihad ki ek aur ghatna, Bihar mai Hinduo par chalti bandook,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Kab hoga hamare sath insaaf, kab khaulega hamara khoon.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Kahi pyar ki aadh mai ho rahi hai hatya, kahi dharm ke naam par mitta majood,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;bharne laga hai paap ka ghada, utho aur lado Bharat maa ke sapoot.\n\nYe sahi samay nahi hai.

Also be advised that this may seem pretty far fetched but I don't blame someone who is afraid of making bold imaginations.*\n\n**Main text:**\n\nI read and read and came to a conclusion. And that made a dream.\n\nI have a dream.\n\nFor centuries Hindus/Sanatanis have been [persecuted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus) and we allowed every other ethnicity and religion to either spread or take refuge. For centuries Hinduism was misinterpreted and distorted.\n\nI envision a nation, built on the Vedic Sanatani virtues and flourished with the modern philosophy. A nation where everyone is treated equal irrespective or caste, creed or religion. A nation which promotes development of the old Sanatani philosophies like they were into development through debates, discussions and research centuries ago. A nation which respects other religions and ideas. A nation which stands up tall for what is righteous, where the knowledge of a person is his social stature, where the pursuit of Gyan(Jnan) has the foremost importance and a nation where no Hindu or any other religion person shall feel intimidated again by any force.\n\nAfter the gap of millennia, it is the time we take up the development of our religion through the modern concept of science. There was a time when these things were the same, now one has lagged behind, it is our duty now to take the movement forward. The [various Hindu schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_philosophy#Classifications), the concepts in [Hindu Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_philosophy) are very rich but need new life.\n\nHence I envision a nation where Sanskrit education is given importance, government orders are required to be published in Sanskrit, govt promotes all the researches to also be published in Sanskrit. This vast knowledge creation in Sanskrit will move our religion forward, and give it a new life.\n\nAll this new knowledge generated through researches and discussions and debates in the various schools of Sciences, Engineering, Philosophy, Medicine, Law etc. will give rise to the *naveen-granth*s, they will give new life to our religion. Hinduism has always been known to be flexible and developed through the discussions and debates of Rishis and Munis, there is no supreme authority, there is no supreme deity, no higher or lower order among gods (after the Bhakti movement). Given this nature and that Hinduism was under continuous development even until recent (Buddha) times, it is only justified that we contribute to the Dharma and hence contribute to ourselves. Ours is a living religion which adjusts with changing times and which shows light even in the difficult days. Hence when the debates and discussions and experiments are stopped, the Sanatan Dharma is choked because it's breath is new ideas and reforms towards better tomorrow.\n\nThere is so much in those unturned Palm leaf manuscripts which we have ignored, there is so much in ourselves which we have ignored. This is the time that we strive for the future which should have been, a future which was lost until now.\n\nIndia needs to rewake as Bharat that it was supposed to be and live at it's full potential of economic, cultural and philosophical development. Bharat is the future, the *vishwaguru* we dreamt of.\n\n**Thank you for reading if you have read till now.**\n\nPlease feel free to ask or discuss something. I sincerely expect discussions strictly related to this topic. I have no hate or love for any religion/group/etc, Sanatan Dharma stands apart as a logical choice for me. And let me know your views about the same. I am okay with non-hateful political discussions.

available, offer Him a flower.\xa0 If it is not the season for flowers, offer God a mere leaf; even that will suffice, provided it is a gift of love.\xa0 If leaves are also scarce, make an offering of water, which is available everywhere, but ensure again that you do it with devotion.\xa0 The word *bhaktyā* has been used in both the first and second lines of the verse.\xa0 It is the bhakti of the devotee that is pleasing to God, and not the worth of the offering.\n\nBy making this wonderful statement, Shree Krishna reveals the merciful divine nature of God.\xa0 He is not concerned with the material value of our offering.\xa0 Rather, He values, above everything else, the love with which we make the offering.\xa0 Thus, the Hari Bhakti Vilas states:\n\n*tulasī-dala-mātreṇa jalasya chulukena cha*\n\n*vikrīṇīte svam ātmānaṁ bhaktebhyo bhakta-vatsalaḥ*\xa0 \xa0(11.261)\n\n“If you offer God with sincere love, just a *Tulsī* leaf and as much water as you can hold in your palm, He will offer Himself to you in return because He is endeared by love.”\xa0 How wonderful it is that the Supreme Master of unlimited universes, whose glorious qualities and virtues are amazing beyond description, and by whose mere thought multitudes of universes come into existence and disappear again, accepts even the most humble offering of His devotee that is given with genuine love.\xa0 The word used here is *prayatātmanaḥ*, implying, “I accept the offerings of those whose hearts are pure.”\n\nThe Shreemad Bhagavatam contains exactly the same verse as the above verse of the Bhagavad Gita.\xa0 While eating dry rice at the house of His friend, Sudama, Shree Krishna said:\n\n*patraṁ puṣhpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayachchhati*\n\n*tadahaṁ bhaktyupahṛitam aśhnāmi prayatātmanaḥ*\xa0\xa0 (10.81.4)\n\n“If one offers Me with devotion, a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or even water, I delightfully partake of that article offered with love by My devotee in pure consciousness.”\n\nWhenever God descends upon the earth, He exhibits this quality in His divine Pastimes.\xa0 Before the Mahabharat war, when Shree Krishna went to Hastinapur to explore the possibility of fashioning an agreement between the Kauravas and Pandavas, the evil Duryodhan had proudly prepared for Him a meal with fifty-six different items.\xa0 However, Shree Krishna rejected his hospitality and instead went to the humble hut of Vidurani, who had been longing deeply for the opportunity to serve her beloved Lord.\xa0 Vidurani was overjoyed on receiving the Supreme Lord at her home.\xa0 All she had to offer was bananas, but her intellect so benumbed with loving sentiments that she did not even realize she was dropping the fruit and putting the banana peels in His mouth.\xa0 Nevertheless, seeing her devotion, Shree Krishna blissfully ate the peels, as if they were the most delicious food in the world.\xa0'<br />Author: 'Accomplished-Ad-6524'<br />id: 'jiax8p'<br />Flair
