OSInt. It stands for Open Source Intelligence. \nRecently while going through a video, I came to understand the fact that internal intelligence apparatus of the country, isn't very keen on gathering OSInt regarding the madarsas, Islamic universities, schools like Darul Uloom Deoband, various dargahs etc, let alone their surveillance. Let's get familiar to this term OSInt. By now you already know the full form. In detail it means the intelligence and analysable information that is collected using 'available to all' sources. Broadly speaking, newspapers, media, public statements. With reference to the Islamic religious institutions/organisations, the sources of OSInt can be the Urdu newspapers, the Fatawas, the statements of prominent Islamic ( preachers/public figures/politicians/Bollywood folks ), their unnoticed activities, like meetings with foreign leaders. Urdu newspapers and Magazines and Fatawas give the insight into the minds of the Islamists, or the narrative they are trying to build or sell. Like it or not, after partition, the scarcity of people who can read Urdu, has alienated us and made it difficult for us to monitor their activities. \nI'm looking for interested folks who can read Urdu and may be we can think of watching them."<br />Author: 'Raktcharitra'<br />id: 'kb83ps'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'B-But Nanak ij our guru too vro, we ij all sanatani vro'<br />Body: "The head which does not bow to the Lord - chop off and remove that head. ||71||\n\nThat head which does not bow to the Lord - what is to be done with that head?\n\nPut it in the fireplace, instead of firewood. ||72||\n\n[a virtuous person isn't without vice](http://www.srigurugranth.org/1381.html)"<br />Author: 'MeinChutiya69'<br />id: 'kb82q9'<br />Flair ::star: OC है बे </li><li>Title: "Justin's Peaceful Protest Remarks Betray his Political Compulsions"<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'barticulate1001'<br />id: 'kb7mao'<br />Flair ::star: OC है बे </li><li>Title: 'bahaut hue political posts, ye batao mitron ki.....'<br />Body: 'zyada chaach peene k baad akhir tatti patli kyun aati h? \n\nraat ko bhindi khane k baad subah lendi mein bhindi k beej kyun lage hue hote h? \n\nwrong answers only.'<br />Author: 'vegandracoola'<br />id: 'kb794v'<br />Flair ::shit: Shitpost</li><li>Title: 'What happened to chodi discord server?'<br />Body: 'Shaam ko kuchh likhne ki permission nahi thi aur ab server gayab ho gaya.

Yeah, it might help the trains safer, more hygenic and whatnot but nobody can deny the fact that the ticket pricing is gonna be too high. It is easily the most viable mode of transport for the lower middle class and now they probably cannot afford it anymore. Spending taxpayer money on Statue of Unity, the new parliament and whatever else. I mean, the cost of building this shit is probably not so astronomical and most of it is probably now in some politician and his builder buddy's pocket, but thats how this country has operated for a long time and its not gonna change anytime soon. Instead of draining that kind of money on the statue or whatever, i feel like they could have done a lot more good if they just stuck to building a hospital or a school or heck, even help ISRO with its future missions (thanks, Mission Mangal). The whole Pakistan rhetoric: Everyone who criticizes the government is labelled anti-national, tukde-tukde or whatever and their image is tarnished by Republic TV and the others. (No, Republic is not neutral). They are also advised to go to Pakistan because clearly you are not allowed to stay in this country if you don't support the ruling party.\n\nCONGRESS:\n\nI mean its caste and religion based politics has now done enough to destroy the country. I can't imagine how this country could have been if Nehru and is descendants would have atleast tried to develop the country instead of focusing on making sure that there is steady flow of money to their pockets and that they cover up all the wrongdoings and scams that have plagued most of their reign( since the late 80s atleast). These dumbfucks are still trying to project Pappu as a mass leader and the party's face on the sole privilage of having a PM daddy (and granny and great-granddaddy). Clearly that plan is not working and they are probably gonna fade out of existence by the end of this decade.\n\nMAHAGATHBANDHAN:\n\nI mean who the hell let this bunch of illiterate bunch of school bullies become national leaders (Arvind Kejriwal is an exception: He is smart and knows how to avoid letting the public see his hindutva self, while letting them realize it). Mayawati is a crazy bitch who had Lucknow laden with elephants when she had CM post. Akhilesh and his father are a bunch of patriarchal cunts who don't want to condemn rape, Lalu and his family needs no introduction in field of crime or politics and Didi is a genuine psycopath. Down south we have confused Kumaraswamy who doesn't know whether he likes the BJP or not and Shiv Sena has an extremely violent brand of hindutva."<br />Author: 'ketchupwithchocolate'<br />id: 'kb6t16'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'What do you people think of the present political scenario in India?'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'ketchupwithchocolate'<br />id: 'kb6rjr'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'Hinduism is not just a way of life. IT IS A RELIGION'<br />Body: 'Hinduism is a way of life is an apologetic label used by coward Hindus to please Marxists and westerners who think Hinduism is nothing more than chanting Om or doing yoga. \n\nThis label is used to preemptively defend yourself against any potential criticism or shaming you may face from someone who hates Hinduism as a religion. \n\nBy calling it a way of life you give rise to pseudo hindus who are Hindu in name only but ideologically want Hinduism gone which is how you allow people like Kanhaya, Ravish etc to say they condemn something despite being "Hindus". \n\nThis flexibility is the downfall of hinduism in 21st century. A belief in paramaatma, reverence towards trimurti, avatars, vedas, goddesses has to be a must for you to be allowed to call yourself a Hindu.'<br />Author: 'K2ASikhIsaiBhaiBhai'<br />id: 'kb6ls1'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'Akhand Hindu Rashtra Bharatvarsh'<br />Body: 'मेरे प्रिय बकचोद सखाओं! जय श्रीराम।\nमित्रों, मैं बहुत दुःखी हो जाता हूँ जब देखता हूँ कि कैसे हमारी भारतभूमि, हमारी सभ्यता को खंड खंड किया गया। महापराक्रमियों और महान संतों के वंशज हम,  हमारे प्रभु के जन्मस्थान और मंदिर सदियों सदियों तक स्वतंत्र नहीं करवा पाए। क्या हमारी नाड़ियों में अब भी वो महान रुधिर बहता है?\n\n\nहम सब राष्ट्रवादी अखंड भारत की बातें करते है। धरातल पर सच्चाई यह है कि हम कश्मीरी हिंदुओं को उनके मातृभूमि में अब तक पुनर्वासित नहीं करवा पाए। हमारे मन्दिरो पर सरकारी कब्ज़ा है। उत्तर-पूर्व के कुछेक राज्यों को छोड़कर सभी ईसाई हो गए। दक्षिण और उत्तर भारत में भाषा को लेकर तो कभी संस्कृति को लेकर अलगाव है। दक्षिण के कुछ राज्यों में हिन्दू अल्पसंख्यक हो गए या निकट भविष्य में हो जाएंगे। जाति-उन्मूलन पर कोई बात नहीं होती। हम जितने पहले विभाजित थे, उतने अब भी हैं। \n\n\nइतने चुनौतियों के बाद भी हम हिन्दुराष्ट्र की परिकल्पना करके क्या स्वयं को फुसला रहे हैं? जब यही मुश्किल है तो अपनी खंडित भूमि वापस लेने की बात करके हम अपने आप को लजा नहीं रहे?\n\n\nआपका क्या विज़न है? क्या हमें इस स्वप्न का त्याग कर देना चाहिए। यदि हाँ, तो आपके लिए आदर्श राष्ट्र कैसा होगा? \n\nयदि यह संभव है, तो रोडमैप क्या होगा? हमें स्वयं को कैसे तैयार करना चाहिए। मुझे बहुत अधिक ज्ञान नहीं है और ना नहीं मैं बुद्धिशाली हूँ - बस एक राष्ट्रभक्त हूँ और राष्ट्र को जो भी छोटी-बड़ी सेवा हो वो देना चाहता हूं। कृपया मार्गदर्शन करिए। \n\nहर हर महादेव'<br />Author: 'drd_rdx'<br />id: 'kb40r5'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'Have you seen anyone being Librandu af until they themselves got to experience the "Hindu Muslim Bhaichara"?'<br />Body: "Have you seen anyone's transition?"<br />Author: '_rudeness_'<br />id: 'kb3xdx'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'My fellow Bhartas, I’m curious- Why is Shivji by far the most popular and followed god?

This boy, he named Sadashivrao. Though, in time, he would earn the nickname Bhau. The young boy\'s father died when he was a mere ten years old. His education and nurturing being taken care of by his aunt Kashibai and his grandmother Radhabhai.\n\n\n\nAt the age of 16, in 1746, he undertook his first campaign. The campaign continued till May 1747 mostly in the western Karnatak region. In January 1747 he won his first battle at Ajra, south of Kolhapur. All together 36 parganas were captured in this campaign.\n\n\n\nAfter the death of Chhatrapati Shahu, Sadashivrao Bhau, would be made the Dewan of Peshwa Balaji Bajirao otherwise known as Nana Saheb. He successfully led the Battle of Udgir which weakened the Nizam of Hyderabad. It was here that Bhau first used a more European method of war, employing his Gardis and artillery to good use and winning the day. Thus, he grew suspicious of the old geurilla way of war and promoted a European model of pitched battles. \n\n\nA few words must be said about these early successes and the effect they had on a man of Bhau\'s temperament and his estimation of his own capabilities. Grant Duff draws a good picture of the young triumphant yet amateur Bhau in these words :\n\n\n" The natural violence of Bhau\'s temper was increased by the family jealousy he had experienced, and the factious intrigues to which it gave rise. His pride was augmented by his extraordinary good fortune in the late campaign, and the spirit of military enthusiasm so dangerous in a general without experience, took complete possession of his mind. Success had inspired him with a blind confidence, which salutary reverses in a humble sphere would in all probability have amended."\n\n\n\nAdded to this mental disposition, was the material factor of war, which was again unfortunately inadequate for the task Bhau was meant to accomplish.\n\n\n\nIn term of soldiers and equipment, he had been supplied with 10,000 of Peshwa\'s own household troops 12,000 of the subordinate chiefs, 8000 disciplined Gardis and 20,000 Pindaris (freebooting raiders). He was provided 8,184 cannon balls out of 19,000 required. 160 maubds of lead and 800 maunds of gunpowder, 99,150 flints for muskets, and an inadequate quantity of 65 sheets against 2000 requisitioned, of European paper for charging the muskets.\n\n\n\nThe Peshwa expected a Maratha army to supply itself with plunder and therefore gave Bhau a mere Rs. 1,88,000 while the monthly expenses exceeded 5 to 6 lakhs. Added to the miserable condition of his supplies and the unsatisfactory composition of his troops, Bhau had one more problem facing him.\n\n\n\nBhau, had too little time to prepare. He had never been to North India, didn\'t know its climate and people or culture. He had with him many families who wished to visit the sacred sites in North India. He didn\'t have boats to ford the rivers in the North. The Marathas fought the Afghans in winter when the Afghans are at their finest, instead of the summer when the climate would have sapped the Durrani of his vitality, this too happened due to delays.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I will say this, yes, there are many aspects that led to the defeat of the Marathas at Panipat, but Bhau is not solely responsible for this. The choice of picking a general lay in the hand of Nana Saheb, who even against the advice of his court should have ocjed Raghunath Rao. The only reason why Bhau was sent to the North instead of Raghunath, who was experienced in the North having led two successful expeditions there, was because the success of Maratha campaigns was judged in monetary terms, and in thus realm, Bhau overtook Raghunath who had brought debt to the Empire. This added with the fact that the army, it\'s supplies and composition also lay in the hands of the court, which also, wasn\'t optimal.\n\n\n\nI\'m open to any discussions in the comments.\n\n\n\n\nSources : Military History of India by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n"Marathas and Panipat" - Hari Ram Gupta\n\n\n\n"Military System of The Marathas" by Surendra Nath Sen\n\n\n\n"Ahwal-e-Jang-e-Bhau-va-Ahmad Shah Durrani" by Pandit Kashiraj, Dewan of Shuja-ud-Daulah.'<br />Author: 'PushyamitraShunga1st'<br />id: 'kay508'<br />Flair :इतिहास :H:</li><li>Title: 'Daily discussion, screenshots, randirona, and rant post here'<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\nDaily discussion, screenshots, randirona, and rant post here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNew users introduce yourselves here.

But no, the agitation continued and so finally the new management had to succumb to the pressure.\nThe final arrangement was arrived and so anyone who wanted to climb the building could still use the donkey. The donkey would carry a person, go in the lift and carry people up &amp; down. All were happy.\nDisclaimer: any resemblance of this with the farmers agitation is a coincidence.'<br />Author: 'TejasaK'<br />id: 'ka6ncx'<br />Flair ::Whatsapp: WhatsApp Forward</li><li>Title: 'Call to action in Toronto'<br />Body: 'An affiliate of the Pakistani section of the international activist organization, the IMT, has been illegally detained, and is likely being tortured, by Pakistani state forces and his colleagues are organizing a protest outside the Pakistani consulate in Toronto on December 17 demanding his immediate release and transparency regarding his whereabouts and humbly request the support of all available. https://www.facebook.com/events/402362760966293'<br />Author: 'dhatura'<br />id: 'ka5dt0'<br />Flair ::danklaugh: Wholesome Bakchodi</li><li>Title: "Before I sign off for tonight, a representative of the so-called 'Kisan Protests'......."<br />Body: 'He mentioned that the proposed solution while allows for state governments to tax private markets but does not regulate trade in those markets. This is wrong on so many levels: \n\n1: For starters, the fact that a tax is being levied in itself implies state governments will frame rules of regulation of these markets. That there will be mandatory registration of traders (though bad decision as it restricts entry) further require some regulations by states\n\n2: The larger point here is that there are no defined market-places for most products in our economy - but there are standard contract regulations that are levied and that when we speak of unregulated trade, that does not do away with such regulation under standard-contracts.\n\n3: So this entire defence of lack of regulation even in what has been proposed by the government makes little sense and it ignores basic principles of law &amp; econ.

This is at the same time when the govt is making an active effort to become more digital, which seems a little paradoxical.\n\nIn some instances the high taxes has positive effect such as Samsung opening Asia's biggest smartphone manufacturing centre in India.\n\nAlso this is happening at a time of economic distress due to Covid. \n\nThe govt other than buying 2 VIP commercial jets (although I guess the orders for that were placed long before Covid), is also building a new parliament building.\n\nTypically during such times any Keynsian follower would advise on investing in infrastructure that can be monetised. This would also act as short term stimulus for the daily wage earner.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on tax increases and the agenda of the govt expenditure?"<br />Author: 'tryingmybest8'<br />id: 'k9zbvq'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'This subreddit is becoming horrible'<br />Body: " \n\nThis subreddit is becoming or has become a cesspool of Islamophobia.

I am not saying that we should become some sort of intellectual opposition to randia(and if we are, we are doing a horrible job of it), as this subreddit is for memes and jokes, but we should not make our subreddit exclusive to a political spectrum.

But just to give a context to my post, \n\nTyagaraja Swamy was a renowned composer of Carnatic music, a form of Indian classical music. He was prolific and highly influential in the development of India\'s classical music tradition. Tyagaraja and his contemporaries, Shyama Shastri and Muthuswami Dikshitar, were regarded as the Trinity of Carnatic music. Tyagaraja composed thousands of devotional compositions, most in Telugu and in praise of Lord Rama, many of which remain popular today. Of special mention are five of his compositions called the Pancharatna Kritis (English: "five gems"), which are often sung in programs in his honour. \n\nEvery Year on his birth Anniversary there is a huge program in Tiruvallur in Tamil Nadu, they call it Tyagraja Aaradhana Ustsavams and it is a very big event for Carnatic singers and general Hindu populous of this nation. \n\nSo Tyagaraja Swamy used to do  **Uncha Vritti,** which is an ancient practice similar to bhikshatan except that the grihastha can do uncha Vritti whereas a sanyasi or a brahmachari can do bhikshatan.\n\nHe used to collect food grains and used them to perform the Sri Rama Aardhana on Rama Navami etc. and thus feed the people.\n\nNow here\'s the issue \n\n[https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/kamal-haasan-s-comment-on-tyagaraja-irks-carnatic-musicians-1675295-2020-05-07](https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/kamal-haasan-s-comment-on-tyagaraja-irks-carnatic-musicians-1675295-2020-05-07)\n\nThis moron kamal Haasan called Tyagaraja Swamy a beggar who sings about Rama. Normally I\'d brush such type of things aside because I know better. But this time they have crossed a line when I first heard about this news I wanted to do something so that these type of things don\'t go unpunished\n\nBut the time has come, we\'ll not let issues like this go very easily. \n\nFYI Kamal Haasan has made tons of money using the Hindu angle in his films, but once he has finished using that angle the actual colours come out.\n\nWhat do you think??'<br />Author: 'sprx7767'<br />id: 'k7aqil'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Butthurt OP</li><li>Title: 'RW Media is trying hard to remove their Bjp love.

Also Hindus are mindwashed well using Hindu named Fakers. \nI am also seeing trend of what AIMIM plans.  \nPandering fear in Muslim community for rss and proud Hindus. \nA message that Bjp is anti Muslim ,police under Bjp targets Muslim especially victims are selected specialty well. I was seeing a pro Palestine Hyderabadi Aimim speaker in fb . He was crying jibbering more than finding solutions.\nAlso so called Hindu majority is already treated as dhimmis using their eyes. Since under constitution they can't make dalits muslims otherwise they will lose Dali status as well can't blame Hindu community for casteism.\nThey fear pan Islamic politics Muslim victim card will be stopped and hindus will suck up poor Muslims. The pandering is such a way that proud Muslim Aimim supporter will never see eye to eye with Rss supporter. While Congress culture was sitting and talking problem is it's hijacked into factions of pan Islamism and soft hindutva. \nAimim targets congress for Rss.  I feel Bjp needs a strong alliance . Fearmongering is the easiest thing. Modi is trying hard to find solutions.but emotional religious fools especially Ms easily give in to it.\nThe way paid seculars project they dont know they pander a venomous agenda hidden under garb of humanity. \nPolitical correctness of Hindus apologetic nature has gone under Bjp but still there is so muslims often guilt trap. While I see Muslims mostly convient religious or pan Islamist   the 1 and 3 are greatly dangerous and 2nd in ghettos."<br />Author: 'Trilokjit-Dey'<br />id: 'k7apgy'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihad</li><li>Title: 'Anyone who comments first will get an award'<br />Body: 'So comment'<br />Author: 'xxiwisk'<br />id: 'k7am83'<br />Flair ::shit: Shitpost</li><li>Title: '#BJPinSL'<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2nw44x4t6e361.png?width=683&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee0fa3903631084b09e7e2b049a861bdc110f4bc'<br />Author: 'milindmarathe'<br />id: 'k7a1iq'<br />Flair ::Twitter: From Twitter Meme</li><li>Title: 'Historical day tomorrow.'<br />Body: 'Happy Independence Day bhratas.'<br />Author: 'fappingninja666'<br />id: 'k7a1c9'<br />Flair :इतिहास :H:</li><li>Title: 'Bihar govt is double facist!

In pursuance, Congress ruled states of Karnataka, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Meghalya &amp; Haryana de-notified Fruits &amp; Vegetables!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335158778623246336\n\n&gt;Did you know? UPA govt also formulated the Model APMC Rules 2007 for implementation of Model APMC Act. After coming to power in 2004, Congress-led UPA persuaded states to adopt the Model APMC Act 2003 to liberalize state agricultural marketing laws.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335159164654391297\n\n&gt;UPA constituted ‘Committee of State Min. In-charge of Agriculture Marketing to Promote Reforms’ under Harshvardhan Patil, Cooperation &amp; Parliamentary Affairs Minsiter in Maharashtra. In 2013 it proposed the following bill for barrier free markets:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335159625700687872\n\n&gt;The Planning Commission in its 2011 report also over mulled the policy option of enacting an “Inter-State Agriculture Produce Trade and Commerce Regulation Act” under entry 42 (Inter-State Trade and Commerce) of the Union list.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335160034091618304\n\n&gt;In April 2011, then Cabinet Secretary while considering the Note for COS suggested to promote Inter-State Trade &amp; Commerce of agriculture produce across States/UTs through the instrument of Central Legislation. Guess who was in power? Congress-led UPA!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335160345854283778\n\n&gt;In pursuance, DAC in consultation with Ministry of Law prepared draft Bill titled as “Agricultural Produce Inter State Trade &amp; Commerce (Development and Regulation) Bill 2012”. However, it was not pursued further. So Congress also wanted barrier free trade of agriculture produce.\n\n&gt;Contract farming has been recognized as a chief enabler in various reports of the Planning Commission &amp; has been implemented by several states under the State APMC Acts. The 11th Five Year Plan, 2007–12, released during the tenure of Congress-led UPA govt mentions:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335160907035410434\n\n&gt;Planning Commission report XII Five Year Plan 2012-17: “There\'s a need to promote both pvt invt &amp; alternative marketing channels to improve marketing system of agri produce by way of direct marketing contract farming &amp; setting up of markets in pvt &amp; co-op sectors, e-trading, etc“.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335161055299870721\n\n&gt;While discussing ‘Issues in Expanding Agricultural Marketing and Processing’, the 12th Five Year Plan  (2012-17) prepared by Planning Commission during UPA years advocates contract farming!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335161336716644353\n\n&gt;Haryana (2007, INC), Karnataka (2003, INC), Maharashtra (2006, INC-NCP), MP (2003, INC), Odisha (2006, BJD), &amp; others made provisions for contract farming under state APMC Act. Punjab (2013, SAD), Tamil Nadu (2019, AIADMK), Odisha (2020, BJD) passed separate Contract Farming Acts\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335161724320710656\n\n&gt;In 2019 Lok Sabha Elections Manifesto, Congress promised to replace the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 by an enabling law that can be invoked only in case of emergencies. The same reform, when bought by Modi is being opposed today!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335162145432952832\n\n&gt;Mid Term Appraisal of Eleventh Five Year Plan during UPA suggests reforming the \'archaic\' APMC Act &amp; abolishing the Essential Commodities Act to \'trigger private sector investment\'! Now when Modi brings it from paper to reality, Congress is opposing it!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335162624695103488\n\n&gt;UPA constituted ‘Committee of State Ministers, In-charge of Agriculture Marketing to Promote Reforms’ under chairmanship of Harshvardhan Patil, then Minister for Cooperation &amp; Parliamentary Affairs, Govt. of Maharashtra. In its 2013 report it spoke of Essential Commodities Act:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335162838080372747\n\n&gt;Planning Commission in its 2011 report also mentioned about the reduction of list of commodities from the purview of Essential Commodities Act &amp; recommended imposition of trade &amp; marketing restrictions only during the emergency. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335163084671909890\n\n&gt;Congress &amp; other anti-social forces have been vehemently opposing the pro-farmer reforms &amp; Congress’ current stand &amp; actions totally stand opposite of their past actions. It is clear that Congress is misleading public at large &amp; protesting only for the sake of opposing Modi!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335166201001984001'<br />Author: 'alubonda'<br />id: 'k79b9x'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'Kashmiri displays blatant racism and skin color prejudice and western leftists rejoice.'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'k790p4'<br />Flair ::Twitter: From Twitter Meme</li><li>Title: 'Who is provoking farmers?'<br />Body: "The way they are protesting it's clear that someone is provoking them as they are not ready to co-operate neither they want to listen anything that government is saying, punjab government can play an important role here but I don't think so they have such a potential to convince them. We have to think who is close to these farmers and who will be effected the most by this bill, according to my personal views the actual role players are the middle men they are the closest to the farmers and due to years of dealing they have a full control over farmers mind and if we see clearly they are the ones who will receive the highest possible loss as there will be a rise in pricing of buying. Now because government is not doing anything to counter these middle men as there complete focus is on congress this can be the reason why even after so much of cooperation by government they are failing to convince these farmers. No one is focusing on them... Maybe that's where the loophole is...\n( I am not sure how true my theory is but I want a positive discussion as a solution has more potential than just questions)"<br />Author: 'Deablose'<br />id: 'k78vkq'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'But God make it flat!!'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'k789c6'<br />Flair ::topkek: Low Effort Meme</li><li>Title: "There is a huge pressure created when Muslim dies .
