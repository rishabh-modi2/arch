And republicans allegedly funded by the Russians. People have no real voice as they're being brainwashed by the media and narrative being controlled by big tech. \n\nIt's playing out the same in India too. Congress, communist parties and media platforms are being funded by China, islamists, and Christian missionaries. And it's showing its ugly face and brainwashing young minds (which included me until recently)\n\nOnly way I see is super strict regulations on money coming from outside or else we will be doomed."<br />Author: 'civ_gandhi'<br />id: 'ku60am'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'What is your view on the caste system in Hinduism?'<br />Body: "One thing which has lead to our downfall since early ages is how we were always divided amongst each other through various castes.\n\nThe caste system may be useful in ancient times for the functioning of society by assigning duties to groups of people but in the modern age there is no need for it in my opinion.\n\nOne thing which Islam gave to people which Hinduism couldn't was complete equality and social solidarity in regards to legal status and religious privileges. Why do we still partake in such a system is beyond me. \n\nLots of lower castes get converted to Islam and Christianity every year because of discrimination whether you want to admit it or not. We are partly in blame for that. Why do people still need to declare that they are brahmins or kshatriyas today? \n\nWe are Hindus. And we don't need to divide ourselves into classes anymore. What we need is social solidarity and the first step in achieving that is to abolish this outdated system."<br />Author: 'horrorlover2'<br />id: 'ksykpw'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'How the saffron party is manipulating us?'<br />Body: '                   How the saffron party \n                        is manipulating us\n  \n   With looting going on everywhere, no freedom of speech and prosecution of critics, those were the days during the British Raj. Now under the governance of the saffron party, India is facing a similar situation. And citizens of our country are completely numb about it, the main problem of people in India is they forget what happened in the past and form their opinions on the present situation. Some politicians are found talking stupid things on national television and they are not even firm on their own points, you can watch it here https://youtu.be/F2zEH7VrKVs.\n    \n    The saffron party is trying to manipulate us by using the media. I don\'t support any political party, manipulation through media was even their during the time of congress,\nbut it was not much. Now sometimes I feel that the Indian media is only working for the saffron party. And if any journalist tries to criticize them on national television they end up like Punya Prasun Bajpai. You can see the case of Punya Prasun Bajpai here https://youtu.be/wfF5Q17lYy4 . Owning multiple news channels gives you the power to form public  opinion and reliance group owns 72 channels which reach out to more than 800 million Indians. Reliance group is owned by Mukesh Ambani and we all know how close he is with our honorable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.\n   \n   Lets leave manipulation  on  national television aside and look towards our social  media. Well our social media is too not that clean. Operation \'karaoke\' conducted by Cobra Post says it all. It was a sting operation in which some journalist went to interview some popular celebrities, after interview they faked going off air but still kept their camera and microphones on. They asked them a question about whether they are paid for their posts on social media. And to the journalist\'s astonisment most of them said that the saffron party pays them above 1 crore for their every tweet they made in favor of the saffron party. To your surprise, the celebrities who agreed that they were paid are Krishna Abhishek, Raju Srivastav, Sonu Sood ,Vivek Oberoy, Jackie Shroff , Mika Singh and 40  more. This operation was so huge that the news channels should have been filled with it but no one even knew that such operation was conducted. You can learn more about  operation karaoke here https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtIitJsHQm64G-lHSe4tuutWWJe7XQfAs .\n\n    While talking about social media how can we forget about the BJP IT cell, if you criticize the saffron party on social media, then get ready to be trolled. There are in total 20,000 members and theres a meeting held every month of the top 150 members of the BJP IT cell. Guess what this meeting is attended by our honorable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the pictures about the meeting is openly available on the top 150 member\'s Instagram and twitter account and our Prime Minister follows them too. You can get more information about it from Quint\'s article https://www.thequint.com/tech-and-auto/tech-news/twitter-trolls-among-super150-invited-by-pm-modi\n\n   We all love watching movies but what if I tell you that Bollywood is manipulating you to form a political opinion in favor of the saffron party. From quit some time movies are made about political figure, one of these movies was Indu sarkar. The movie talks about Indira Gandhi and her evil side during emergency. "What we see, is what we believe", 70% of the movie was based on fiction and it was not mentioned anywhere in the movie. Less than 1% of the audience knew this fact.\n  \n   Young Minds are the most easy targets to manipulate and these Young Minds are the vote banks of the future . Political manipulation has not even spared our education system. A kid\'s world is small it\'s all about going to school, play with friends, etc. They feel everything printed in their textbooks is true but is it? Let\'s look at case in Rajasthan,  during rule of the saffron party in the state. There were some changes in the textbooks, before it was  ‡§ï for ‡§ï‡•å‡§Ü but it was then changed to ‡§ï for ‡§ï‡§Æ‡§≤ and the image used for ‡§ï‡§Æ‡§≤ was exactly similar to the saffron party\'s emblem. There was one more change in its history books which showed image of freedom fighters of Congress during the time of British in bad light and from textbooks of standard first to standard tenth it was not mentioned anywhere that Mahatma Gandhi was murdered by Naturam Godse and Naturam Godse was a part of the RSS. Lets not go so far in Rajasthan and look at our NCERT textbooks, demonetisation which was a huge economic failure which disturbed India\'s economic growth, it was glorified in the NCERT textbooks. There was poem in its English book on lotus that said victory of lotus is victory of Indian culture. You can get more information about it herehttps://youtu.be/48OyyhpIGZk\n\n   Why is the saffron party doing it? Why are they manipulating us through education system, Bollywood, social media and our Television. It is because if their public image is not getting better, at least it should not be bad. What can we do about it? The only thing we can do is to not believe anything around us and remember everything around us is fake.'<br />Author: 'Fine_Principle_7755'<br />id: 'ksxjh9'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
<li>Title: 'Tips to battle Hinduphobia'<br />Body: "Some tips to battle Hinduphobia:\n\n1. Stop being apologetic: I've never seen a religion more apologetic than Hindus. Even after being victims for thousands years, they are apologetic for everything under the sun. In the temple outside my house, there was Bhandara almost every month but yet Hindus feel apologetic for Bhandaras at Gurudwaras. And if someone asks why so much milk is 'wasted' in temples, ask the person how dared the person plan a trip to Paris/Australia or had his destination wedding at Timbaktu when so many countrymen were starving. Hindus are apologetic to Northeastern Christians if they raised a ruckus on supposed discrimination in mainland but are completely silent when they threaten and physically assault not only Biharis and Bengalis but also other north eastern Hindu or non-Christian tribals.\n\n.\n\n2. Take care of your words: Hindus are worst examples of subconscious conditioning. Since childhood, through movies and casual remarks, it is being fed into our minds that Punjabi and Pathan boys and girls are more beautiful and 'fair' which results in our boys changing their religion to marry the girl from other community and our girls simping over Fawad Khan and Turkish soaps.\n.\n\n3. Be aware: If you are aware, no one will be able to guilt trip you over so-called Brahminical patriarchy or Manusmriti for so called oppression of dalits, you can point out how the provisions of Indian Constitution and government are highly favorable towards these castes while in Pakistan, still the position for cleaning washrooms is only for Hindu Dalits.\n.\n4. And if any foreigner tries to guilt trip you, remind them about massacres of aboriginal people who were the rightful owners of the land they've built their houses on."<br />Author: 'dreamerimagine1'<br />id: 'ksx0eh'<br />Flair :Magga Balti Vichar :Shwr:</li>

Ask yourself, is it possible today that son of a collector is discriminated in school and made to sit separately ?  \n\n\nIf mahars were not allowed to study, how did bhimrao get his school admission ? if they were, did the children of mahar kings faced similar discrimination ?   \n\n\nbhimrao was admitted in Elphinstone High School, bombay (est   \n1822) and Elphinstone College (est. 1834). these schools were started by the british for white children and to train brown civil servants. He had no problem getting admission here.   \n\n\nInterestingly, this school was started by Mountstuart Elphinstone, governer of bombay, who acted as a broker with peshwas and Marathas. (due to which Maratha kingdom went from Emperor Shahu (son of Shivaji) to Peshwas and then to mughals).  \n\n\nHe then went to columbia uni, USA where he was influenced by John Dewey, who converted the english word, depressed to dalit.   \n\n\nAmbedkar\'s father helped recruit most of the mahar soilders during WW1, and ambedkar himself recruited them in WW2.   \n\n\nThere was no caste / jaati system before british came to Aryavart, no surnames (related to occupation).

<li>Title: "India's Secularism - Sita ram goel. (Book review)"<br />Body: "India‚Äôs Secularism penned down by Sita Ram Goel further translated in English by Yashpal Sharma. \n\r\nTo preach Secularism to this Hindu society, was like showing a lamp to the Sun. ~ Sita Ram Goel. \n\r\nCan there be a religion without spirituality? \n\r\nThese words Secularism, Socialism, non-alignment etc etc sounds beautiful, But we all know what the garbs of secularism has done to India. \r\n\r\nThe title of the book is aptly chosen,  ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs Secularism‚Äù not ‚ÄúIndian Secularism‚Äù because there is nothing Indian about Nehruvian Secularism. \r\n\r\nIn the chapter named ‚ÄúWhat is Dharma‚Äù, The author has talked about What Dharma is, Types of Worships and has deeply discussed the propositions of Advaita and Monotheism. \r\nIt gave us an understanding that both are different to each other and they aren't even comparable. Differences arise when different individuals espouse the opposite traditions of Advaita and Monotheism intellectually and cherish them consciously. Then the tradition of Monotheism gives birth to Aurangzeb and the tradition of Advaita to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.\r\n\r\nThe author has discussed how secularism, Rise and developed in Europe. And how India is different from Europe, India where there is no sign of bloodshed of dharma before Mughals invasions. And Europe where Jews whom the Church had stigmatized as the ‚ÄúKilled of Christ‚Äù and deprived of all citizenship rights. Also he talked about the challenge of Islam and Hindu Response in differnt phases. First phase - Mahmud Ghaznavi, Second - Mahmud Ghauri, Third - Akbar and the Fourth - after partition. Talking about ‚ÄúThe Basic Blunder‚Äù to recognize Islam as a dharma. (ofc it‚Äôs a religion). And also talked about how thinkers (Such as Adi Shankaracharya) of Arab invasion periods have not talked about the invasion. All these thinkers could not entertain any proposition beyond  ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§π‡•à, ‡§ú‡§ó‡§§ ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§•‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ (Brahma alone is Real, the world is an illusion). Perhaps evil conduct in this unreal world was no more than an illusion for them. Perhaps they could see no reason for discussing an illusion.\r\n \r\nFurther has also talked about Treatment of these Diseases. That we have to go back to the ideals and goals laid by our leader during the Swadeshi movement. In order to emerge as the leading nation and as an exemplary example to the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nA new meaning of Secularism began to be fortified - Secularism, that is, applause for Islam and Christianity. And Hindu society began to be denounced as a nest of narrow-minded and aggressive communalism. All political parties also began to swear by this Secularism.\r\n\r\nSita Ram Goel criticized Hindus as we failed to re-establish the dharmic way of life. \r\nAnd he was also criticized, other religions after a deep understanding of their scriptures. Though this book is written against the backdrop of the political developments in India parallels can be drawn when one sees the goings on in Europe. Even though this book was written almost 35 years ago its relevance has certainly not diminished. \r\nReligion has to suffer due to Religious fanatics of conflicting religions leading it to systematic disintegration. Someone then has to speak up. \r\nThank You, Sita Ram Goel Ji. \r\nJai Shree Ram."<br />Author: 'runawayharish'<br />id: 'ksveth'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

If the protesters were from a different religion, it would still have made sense but being from the same religion and hitting your own god just to hurt your own people doesn‚Äôt make sense. I thought people can‚Äôt be that stupid until I met my secular classmates in college, the most anti-Hindu people I‚Äôve ever seen , by anti Hindu i mean anti-uppercaste.

<li>Title: "India isn't a rape capital and doesn't have a rape culture, it's a conspiracy by leftists to destroy our thousands of years old culture and traditions."<br />Body: 'Let\'s talk about the word \'rape\' itself, how a society perceives a word tells us a lot about it, in India nobody wants to talk about rape except a few woke leftists, now what does it tell us about Indian society? \n\nLeftists will tell you this means India is so misogynistic that even nobody wants to talk about rape and how we should talk about rape to "smash the brahminical patriarchy". But here\'s the mind blowing part, the word \'rape\' isn\'t even a Indian word it\'s a English word imported in India by British and propagated by leftists. In fact no Indic languages originally have words for rape, leftists were successful in injecting some made up words for rape in indic languages but even a child can tell they sound so different from normal words and aren\'t original.\n\nNow you would understand why Indian society doesn\'t talk about rape because it\'s a totally foreign concept, the society home to thousands of great men, vast wishdom, knowledge, peace and love can\'t even imagine a thing as bad as rape. No person following indic religion can even think about rape.\n\nFurthermore there isn\'t a single written evidence of rape in ancient India, the mughals and other foreigners of course did mass rapes of Hindu women. Hindus were totally stunned by those horrible acts, they didn\'t know how to respond to such a terrible acts, so as a result they started child marriage ([source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage_in_India#:~:text=Child%20marriage%20in%20India%2C%20according,in%20poor%20socio-economic%20conditions.&amp;text=Child%20marriage%20was%20outlawed%20in%201929%2C%20under%20Indian%20law.)). \n\nBritish took advantage of this and framed Hindus as pedophiles and rapists, even today the people who say India has rape capital are mughal and Britain sympathizers. The reason rape has increased in India is due to growing influence of west.'<br />Author: 'micgef2'<br />id: 'ksiixl'<br />Flair :Indo-International üì∞</li>
<li>Title: 'Ravish Kumar- An overview'<br />Body: '**CLAIM:** Ravish Kumar is the only unbiased anchor \n\n**Facts:**\n\n* His brother Brajesh Kumar Pandey, is an INC leader from Bihar. He also contested in the last Bihar Assembly election from Govindganj. He lost to Shree Sunilmani Tiwari (BJP)  by a margin of 27924 votes.\n* Ramon Magsaysay Award: This is what the chamchas are most excited about. Let\'s drill it down a bit. This prize was actually established by Rockefeller Brothers Fund. \n* Now, who were the Rockefellers when it comes to politics? They were ***liberal republicans!!!*** *and now get ready for another surprising fact*, the Philippine government also plays a huge role in deciding the winners. Pastors from the Philippines come to India to convert a tonne of Hindus! and guess where they are mostly located? drum roll.....................\n* Yes, you guessed it right, **Andhra Pradesh!!!**\n* His wife  Nayana Dasgupta, is a professor at the University of Delhi! Just google "University of Delhi anti-CAA protests" and you will see what this whole thing is all about.\n\nSome other awards which he received and their explanation:\n\n* Gauri Lankesh Award for Journalism (Self-explanatory why he got this one)\n* Kuldip Nayar journalism award: Now who was Kuldip Nayar? Wikipedia refers to him as a "left-wing political commentator" Again this is self-explanatory\n* Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Award for Hindi Journalism Now you might be wondering who was Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi? Well as you might have guessed, he was a leader of the INC (Indian National Congress)\n\n**Verdict:**\n\nNope, the evidence does not indicate that Ravish Kumar can be an unbiased anchor.'<br />Author: 'Meet_Me_In_Heaven'<br />id: 'ksi140'<br />Flair ::oc-: OC ‡§π‡•à BC!üí°</li>

<li>Title: 'Chodi After Dark : Which is your strange/paranormal experience? Heres mine'<br />Body: "It happened when I was a wee young lad, bounding up the twelfth class. I remember it clearly to this day.\n\nThe city I used to live at was somewhat weird in its planning. Well which city isnt in India barring a few exceptions. So for the tuition classes I used to go to the other part of city and there was a bridge which joined both parts. \n\nThe bridge was an important construction as it was the only thing which joined both the parts of the city. And weirdly even after being in the smack middle of the city there was no human settlement near one kilometre vicinity of the bridge, on either side. \n\nAnd it wasnt devoid of a reason. Its an ancient city and since time immemorial, the bridge or the area near it was known to be haunted. \n\nI never paid any heed to such old wives tales. Until that fateful night. \n\nI had planned to stay back on the other side of the bridge at a friend's place as early in the morning next day, we had a test at the tuitions at 6.00 am. Bring the winter season it was a lot of trouble crossing the town on my moped, teeth chattering all the while to reach the tuitions. \n\nBut as my misfortune would have it, someone from my friends family was critical following a major accident. So the family had to leave urgently, my friends protest to stay back fell on deaf ears and I was in a precarious position. \n\nBut not wanting to be a point of bother for the family I decided myself to get back to my home. \n\nMust have been around 12.30 pm I bade farewell to the family and self started the moped. I tucked myself well with the jerkin, pulled its hoodie above my head and tied it. \n\nIt was especially foggy that night. As I crossed the slumbering city, I found myself the only dweller on the roads. The air was icy cold. \n\nAs I neared the bridge I thought to myself look at this bridge looking so innocent and harmless, people just get spooked cause of the  deserted place, thats all.\n\nJust as I finished this thought I felt a significant drop in power of the moped, its engine started sputtering. I was already on the bridge by now, no matter how much throttle I gave her, she gave feeble signs of life and died exactly at the middle of the bridge. \n\nI tried the self, I tried the kickstarter, nothing worked. Before the engine had stalled I had managed to get it near the wall of the bridge, to avoid collision in case of incoming traffic. Because the fog had really thickened up by now.  The golden light of the streetlights were the only sign that there were street lights. \n\nThe place was eerie, with the halos of light formed around the street lights and no sound from any direction. It was weird for an open space to be this silent, I thought. \n\nJust as I moved towards the wall of the bridge to see if there was water flowing below, because I couldn't hear anything, I heard a  whisper, inside my left ear. It was just a sound, as if someone had exhaled near my ear. \n\nWhat bothered me was that both of my ears were well covered. I had made sure no wind could pass in. I looked sound warily, there was nothing, nobody. \n\nFor a moment I thought of making a break for it. It was impractical, I wasnt thinking straight. My home was long way from there and the cold was biting. I took a deep breath, grabbed the handles of the moped and started dragging it. There was a slope just where the bridge ended which I thought could jump start the engine. \n\nAs soon as I started walking away from the spot, I felt as if mutiple cold needles were piercing my body. I had never experienced anything like this, it was almost too painful to bear. I felt I was burning up, by cold. I took every ounce of energy I had and didnt stop. I kept pulling the moped. It wasnt getting better,  I felt as if I was getting pierced more and more as I went further.\n\nAs soon as I reached the end of the bridge I jumped on the moped gave it a mighty push with everything I had. The moment I left the bridge, the sensation stopped. But the remember trying to self start the moped like a madman, somehow it started on the first try. \n\nI zoomed so fast till home that I didnt even realise I was at the front gate. Once inside I pulled up my shirt and saw multiple small red indurations on my skin. For once I thought I may have got chickenpox. But it wasn't. \n\nI didnt tell anyone about it. And to this day you can always hear water flowing when you stand near the walls of the bridge.\n\nBut that night, that night was different."<br />Author: 'chayenchabilo'<br />id: 'krwelr'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: "Why Secularism Isn't A Suitable Trait For The Indian System And What Our Constitutional Fathers Thought About it- (A message to dear secular-liberal friends)"<br />Body: '  Secularism is not inherently bad, it\'s just not well suited a system for India, as Gandhi rightly said, one can\'t ever seperate religion from Indian people and Indian politics. You get the answer when you try to dwell into the origins of secularism as a trait of a governance system. The history of Secular govt. goes back to Europe in the late medieval period, not because the European people loved welcoming other religions to their country but because their governments and kings didn\'t like the Church\'s rising influence in governance and hence govts. and kings all over western Europe introduced systems and laws in their country to seperate all kinds of religious organizations, values and influence from seats of power and governmental decision-making, because obviously,tell me would you like it if you were a 16th century nobleman who worked for the king but an old-baldy from the church could bypass all your decisions? In case you\'d like to explore the history,you can do some more reading here in this really excellent journal- [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40972199?seq=1](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40972199?seq=1)\n\nIn contrast to that,there was no church in India, and even if there is one now,they haven\'t ever really been much strong enough to influence any kind of politics and no similar organizations exist as well whereas most Hindu seats of authority (the different *maths*) have largely always remained apolitical and hence the secularist trait is rendered useless when it comes to India. \n\nThere\'s a reason why Ambedkar didn\'t add the term "Secular" into the original constitution and we were not a secular nation upto \'74 when Indira Gandhi used her authority during the emergency and added the terms "socialist" and "secular" unilaterally, it is suspected that she did that under the influence of the KGB as the Mitrokhin archives reveal because the soviets wanted a place in the Indian govt. and Congress in return for helping India win the \'71 war, I\'ve already done a very detailed post on how the Congress technically sold the whole country to the Soviets and KGB, not going into more detail on it-[https://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/krkmzq/the\\_legacy\\_of\\_bose\\_and\\_how\\_the\\_nehruand\\_congress/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/krkmzq/the_legacy_of_bose_and_how_the_nehruand_congress/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  \n \n\n*There\'s a reason why Ambedkar didn\'t add the term "Secular" into the original constitution* Coming back to my previous point,yes you heard that right, the father of the constitution didn\'t want us to be secular, and he was not bigoted,you want to know why he thought so? Because he suspected a future islamization of the country could happen if we adopted a secular nation\'s traits (which he foresaw and his words aged well), the same case is being seen with many parts of Europe, which didn\'t forsee the evil of Secularism and how it could be twisted and used by Islamic radicals, if you don\'t believe me,maybe you\'ll believe Ambedkar\'s own words from some of the constitutional assembly debates when they were making the decision whether the country should be "secular" or not, here are some extracts of what he said-\n\n\\- Dr Ambedkar says:\n\n‚Äú*There can thus be no manner of doubt that the Muslim Society in India is afflicted by the same social evils as afflict the Hindu Society. Indeed, the Muslims have all the social evils of the Hindus and something more. That something more is the compulsory system of purdah for Muslim women.*‚Äù\n\n\\- Dr Ambedkar says:\n\n‚Äú*The existence of these evils among the Muslims is distressing enough. But far more distressing is the fact that there is no organized movement of social reform among the Musalmans of India on a scale sufficient to bring about their eradication. The Hindus have their social evils. But there is this relieving feature about them‚Äînamely, that some of them are conscious of their existence and a few of them are actively agitating for their removal. The Muslims, on the other hand, do not realize that they are evils and consequently do not agitate for their removal. Indeed, they oppose any change in their existing practices.*‚Äù\n\n\\- Dr Ambedkar says.\n\n‚Äú*The third thing that is noticeable is the adoption by the Muslims of the gangster‚Äôs method in politics. The riots are a sufficient indication that gangsterism has become a settled part of their strategy in politics. ‚Ä¶. So long as the Muslims were the aggressors, the Hindus were passive, and in the conflict, they suffered more than the Muslims did. But this is no longer true. The Hindus have learned to retaliate and no longer feel any compunction in knifing a Musalman. This spirit of retaliation bids fair to produce the ugly spectacle of gangsterism against gangsterism*.‚Äù\n\n\\- Dr Ambedkar says:\n\n‚ÄúT*he second thing that is noticeable among the Muslims is the spirit of exploiting the weaknesses of the Hindus. If the Hindus object to anything, the Muslim policy seems to be to insist upon it and give it up only when the Hindus show themselves ready to offer a price for it by giving the Muslims some other concessions. Another illustration of this spirit of exploitation is furnished by the Muslim insistence upon cow-slaughter and the* *stoppage of music before mosques. Islamic law does not insist upon the slaughter of the cow for sacrificial purposes and no Musalman, when he goes to Haj, sacrifices the cow in Mecca or Medina. But in India, they will not be content with the sacrifice of any other animal.*‚Äù\n\n\\- **But at least Islam teaches universal brotherhood, right?**\n\nWrong! Dr Ambedkar has this to say\n\n‚Äú*The brotherhood of Islam is not the universal brotherhood of man. It is brotherhood of Muslims for Muslims only. There is a fraternity, but its benefit is confined to those within that corporation.*‚Äù\n\n**But what about the ‚Äúidea of India?‚Äù Is it right to question the patriotism of Indian Muslims?**\n\nLet‚Äôs find out what Baba Saheb has to say\n\n‚Äú*The second defect of Islam is that it is a system of social self-government and is incompatible with local self-government, because the allegiance of a Muslim does not rest on his domicile in the country which is his but on the faith to which he belongs. ‚Ä¶. Wherever there is the rule of Islam, there is his own country. In other words, Islam can never allow a true Muslim to adopt India as his motherland and regard a Hindu as his kith and kin.*‚Äù\n\n*There goes an ouch from The Wire and Quint*\n\n**How do the Muslims of India see the Hindus? Do they see Hindus as equals and treat them with respect as per Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb?**\n\nDr Ambedkar says:\n\n‚Äú*The realist must take note of the fact that the Musalmans look upon the Hindus as Kaffirs, who deserves more to be exterminated than protected. The realist must take note of the fact that while the Musalman accepts the European as his superior, he looks upon the Hindu as his inferior.*‚Äù\n\n‚Äú*If the representative government can help the Muslims, they will demand it, and fight for it. ‚Ä¶ The dominating consideration with the Muslims is not democracy. The dominating consideration is how democracy with majority rule will affect the Muslims in their struggle against the Hindus. Will it strengthen them or will it weaken them? If democracy weakens them, they will not have democracy*.‚Äù\n\n**But don‚Äôt the vast majority of Muslims condemn all acts of violence? Isn‚Äôt Islam a religion of peace?**\n\nYou could listen to NDTV. Or you could listen to Dr Ambedkar:\n\n‚Äú*whether the number of prominent Hindus killed by fanatic Muslims is large or small matters little. What matters is the attitude of those who count, towards these murderers. The murderers paid the penalty of law where the law is enforced. The leading Moslems, however, never condemned these criminals. On the contrary, they were hailed as religious martyrs and agitation was carried on for clemency being shown to them.* ‚Äù\n\nGo ahead, read Baba Saheb\'s **PAKISTAN OR THE PARTITION OF INDIA** and you\'ll find how much the man leftists, islamists and liberals champion so much today, the very Father of the Indian Constitution would\'ve laughed these jokers off in a debate about secularism and opression os Islam as a minority today ([http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar\\_partition/](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/))\n\nAnyway, if we don\'t have a society suitable for being secular, the father of our constitution didn\'t want such a trait for our democracy (because he foresaw Islam as a future evil that it is today, and he was way ahead of his time on this one because no one in the west was focusing on this then) and he also very well knew how a secular society would mean a doomsday for Hindus (No he wasn\'t an anti-Hindu like they claim so, in fact he compiled the Hindu code of conduct and Laws very passionately himself and seeked to reform Hindu society for the better), and after all of that,what makes you think that the principle is good for us?We might not feel threatened right now but as per the classic Game Theory model ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game\\_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)) we\'re already losing this infinitely long civilizational war, and we\'re not far away, most research papers and social scientists agree that once the Islamic population in a country reaches 16% nobody can stop the country from getting Islamized in the next 100-150 years (backed by Harvard and Pew peer-reviewed papers published in reputed social science journals- [https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4481625/Norris\\_MuslimIntegration.pdf](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4481625/Norris_MuslimIntegration.pdf) , [https://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/the-future-of-the-global-muslim-population/](https://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/the-future-of-the-global-muslim-population/) , Note-if that link doesn\'t work on your IP by any chance, PM me your email for a PDF copy if you want to read the whole paper)\n\n So to recap it for you- We\'re not a suitable civilization for being Secular, we\'re threatened by the Islamic community (radically,not just demographically,although they did increase from 13% to 20% in 10 years,and that\'s hugely bad for us,just waiting for the 2021 census) and the Father of our constitution didn\'t want us to be one, since Ambedkar believed that Muslim society has more ills than Hindu society, that Muslims are more resistant to positive change, that Muslims believe neither in democracy, nor in treating Hindus as equals, nor do Muslims condemn crimes against Hindus. That Muslims can never owe allegiance to India.\n\nSuffice to say, Baba Saheb would certainly have lost the elections for the post of JNUSU President to "Dr." Kanhaiya Kumar.\n\nSo my question to you dear liberal friend being, one,if we weren\'t originally secular when we got independence and two, when we got our first constitution two years later,three, the principle was forced into our throats by a neo-dictatorial regime (because that\'s what the emergency basically was) and even most of the fathers of Modern India (including Ambedkar and Patel) believed that secularism wasn\'t a suitable principle for us to blindly follow as a civilization, then mate,what makes you think it is good for us into a long run? The way I see it, if it keeps being misused and twisted by people like this, we\'ll for sure one day end up in a communal civil war with multiple sides fighting for themselves, and that would be a true doomsday for us as a country.\n\nI think I need not say furthermore why secularism is not a principle suitable for India as a civilization in the long run mate.\n\nWith this I rest my case.'<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'kruh6p'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Full letter of ISRO senior scientist Tapan Mishra of the series of assassination attempts on him, what all they tried and the approach by Indian Amercian professors from top US universities to silence him for remuneration. This needs to be read by every Indian.'<br />Body: '#Long Kept Secret\n\nWe, in ISRO, occasionally heard about highly suspicious death of Prof. Vikram Sarabhai in 1971. Also heard occasional doubts about sudden death of Dr. S Srinivasan, Director of VSSC in 1999. Case of Shri Nambinarayanan in 1994 is well known. But I never thought that I will be at the receiving end of such mystery.\n\nI was poisoned with deadly Arsenic Trioxide on 23rd May 2017, during promotion interview from Sci/Eng SF to SG in ISRO HQ at Bangalore. Fatal dose was probably mixed with chutney along with Dosai, in snacks after lunch. What followed was nightmare lasting for almost two years Severe loss of blood to the tune of 30-40% through anal bleeding. I barely could come back from Bangalore and was rushed to Zydus Cadila hospital in Ahmedabad. It was followed by severe breathing difficulty, unusual skin eruptions and skin shedding, loss of nails on feet and hands, terrible neurological issues due to hypoxia, skeletal pain, unusual sensations, one suspected heart attack and Arsenic depositions and fungal infections on every inch of skin and internal organs. Treatment was received in Zydus cadilla, TMH-Mumbai and AIIMS-Delhi over a period of two years. Famed forensic specialist, Dr. Sudhir Gupta told me that in his whole career, for the first time he was seeing a live specimen of a survivor of assassination attempt with fatal dose of assassination grade molecular As2O3. Otherwise his experience was limited to cadavers.\n\nI am thankful to one of my Director colleagues, present at the same meeting, who warned me on 5th June 2017, of possibility of poison given to me. Probably, I guess, he witnessed poison mixing in my food. On 7th June, MHA security agency personnels met me and alerted me of Arsenic poisoning. I am thankful to them, as their info helped doctors to focus on exact remedy instead of scratching their heads with unusual signatures of my ailment. Security agencies took me to different cities. I am sure, without their intervention, I would have been dead with multiple organ failure within two to three weeks.\n\nI learnt that this poison is given in molecular level suspension (crystal level is harmless) just after heavy meal. It is a colourless, odourless, tasteless suspension and hence cannot even be suspected. It gets absorbed through stomach during food ingestion, kills RBCs immediately to such large extent that the fine blood vessels are clogged, leading to heart attacks and strokes within two to three hours and the victim can easily be passed of as heart attack death. Fortunately, that day, I did not take lunch. Arsenic passed directly to colon region and most of them got rejected through bleeding. The small remnant created so much damage to my health that I only know and I kept my morale high to face the danger with poise.\n\nThe motive appears to be espionage attack, embedded in the Government set up, to remove a scientist with critical contribution of very large military and commercial significance, like expertise in building Synthetic Aperture Radar. I will also not rule out it also as a new modus operandi of adjusting seniority and clear me who was perceived as obstacle. Whatever may be the reason, it was a great shame for the country and our security apparatus.\n\nWhat pains me is that ISRO hierarchy and my colleagues tried to shun me as pariah. I pleaded with two successive Chairmen to help me in getting justice. Kirankumar tried his best to convince me that my earlier case of squamous cell carcinoma is resurrecting. I personally talked to Dr. Kasturirangan and Shri Madhavan Nair and they developed cold feet. What followed was a series of nightmares, alongwith severe deterioration of health. I was bombarded with hundreds of threatening emails to keep my mouth shut. I was saved by whiskers, due to alacrity of security agencies, from massive explosive incident, in which Rs. 100 cr. lab was destroyed. This happened on 3rd May 2018.\n\nOn 19th July 2019, an Indian American professor of one of the topmost US university suddenly appeared in my office. He requested me not to utter a word in future. As a quid pro quo, my IITK grad son will be accommodated in a top notch college in USA. I declined and he left my office at 1430 hrs. And my thirty plus years contributing career was consigned to sinecure position at 1630 hrs. on the same day. I was removed from all responsibilities, including SAC Directorship.\n\nMy security was breached and I was poisoned with gaseous poison, probably Hydrogen Cyanide, which hypoxiates leaving no trace, on 12th July 2019. I was hypoxiated severely, leading to convulsion, loss of senses and memory. I survived because of NSG training of my PSO. I was transferred immediately to hospital, administered ozonised oxygen and had to spend couple of days in ICU. Hospitalization was followed by a long treatment for hypoxia, which is still continuing. Curiously it happened just two days prior to planned launch date of Chandrayan 2 on 15th July. Probably to prevent me to be present there on this occasion.\n\nThere was a plan to defame me by doctoring the CCTV recording of my room on 23rd and 24th Jan, 2020. It still baffles me how this high security recorder, located in the room of Director, SAC was accessed, contents were digitally edited and played back in analog for rerecording. CCTV recorders are special recorders which can only be fed in analog and can be digitally retrieved. The attempt was foiled because of alertness of security agencies. I still marvel at the cinematographical quality of editing of such an unimpressive fellow like me.\n\nFor last two years there were mysterious appearances of poisonous snakes like cobra, krait at a regular intervals of a few days in my quarter. Karbolic acid vents are put every 10 ft. Yet nobody could prevent intrusions of the snakes. Fortunately because of my four cats and my security staff, they could be killed or caught alive. Only three months back, we accidentally discovered a carefully laid secret tunnel in my compound and hidden in a trove of banana plantations. Once we blocked the tunnel, all snake intrusions stopped. Two incidents convinced me that the mysterious people are after me and probably going to hit me hard before my superannuation at the end if this month. They want my mouth shut forever.\n\n1. All the signatures point to deliberate poisoning of my mentally challenged son with Covid 19. The poor boy, who cannot even speak or eat or carry out hygiene activities himself, had to be hospitalized for 10 days, followed by months of complications.\n\n2. There was a failed attempt in poisoning me with Arsenic, probably in first week of September 2020. It failed, but it was enough to create signature of quite good amount of poisoning, leading to skeletal pain, skin peeling and nail dying.\n\nEnough is enough. I have faith in our security apparatus and men. But these mysterious men are much more equipped, trained, lethal and determined to snuff out living witness of the most shameful incident of Indian science. I put forward to Government, intellectuals and fellow scientists and my classmates and teachers, spread across the world, that all efforts should be made to keep me and my family safe and punish these mysterious men. I am convinced that these are the men, embedded in our system, are leading to mysterious deaths of scientists and destruction of our institutions. These incidents should be wake up call to prevent such nefarious happening to many of our bright minds in future. The nation, which cannot protect their own people who made contributions in building it in the first place, is destined to suffer.\n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2021/01/former-isro-sac-director-tapan-misra-reveals-he-was-poisoned-arsenic-trioxide/'<br />Author: 'BalHanumanJi'<br />id: 'krput3'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

The whole North Bengal, western Bengal and Bangladesh border areas of Nadia district has given BJP a clear mandate, paving way for BJP's inroad in West Bengal Assembly.\n\nInterestingly, the Kolkata and sub-urban area has remained almost untouched by BJP while TMC has retained its stronghold. The middle bengal (Birbhum and Murshidabad) however has been easier for TMC due to large Muslim population, despite having oldest RSS presence in this part of WB.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Parliament seat distribution 2019](https://preview.redd.it/koslg5360p961.jpg?width=1199&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40ff610b6e81513631f8bc8c273153d1086a2cd7)\n\nEast Bengali Hindu refugees have been settling mostly in the Kolkata and sub-urban part. CPIM did a great job convincing them to be their vote bank. Remember, Jyoti Basu (CM for 23 years) was a East Bengali refugee. Despite committing atrocities and mass murder of refugees they whitewashed them and did not allow the facts to come out in public. All the history of atrocities has remained only in the private life of individuals who suffered. Its a very strange factor that they don't want to remember the atrocities that has been caused upon them. They just want to move on and not speak about them. Unless there is a long sustaining tradition of keeping the stories alive, we forget and make the same mistakes again and again and again. Ayodhya has been able to celebrated Diwali after 492 years. Because They kept the stories alive.\n\nThe East Bengali voter base has switched towards TMC, which is why BJP is yet to gain a mandate in this area. You will probably never find another group of people that has forgotten atrocities that has been committed on them by Muslims and communists. We have studied in the leftist education system. So imagine how much whitewashing and indoctrination has been done through school education. Also, recruiting teachers from party cadre base has been a common feature of CPIM and TMC. So we have been indoctrinated by our curriculum, our teachers, even our religious institutes spread the non sense of Sarv dharm Badapav. Probably I was lucky that I grew up in a sanghi household and studied in a cultural environment.\n\nProbably everyone of us have been taught from childhood not to speak about politics in public. The red terror of CPIM is so ingrained in the Bengali psyche that it is taking time to come out of that. Due to the Neo-cultural renaissance of Hindutva, availability of information (Thank you Jio, democracy owes you a lot) and inter connectivity due to Social Media a new batch of assertive Hindus are emerging.

He said: Look here; Scotland Yard has not yet written off Subhas as dead or gone disappeared never to come. If that is so, if Subhas comes back to India, will you be the Prime Minister or Subhas will be? That was Question No 1. Question No 2 was, supposing the country is not partitioned, will Bengal contribute the Prime Ministership or will UP contribute the Prime Ministership? The hint was very clear and the vacillating great leader agreed to Partition.***\n\n3. After winning the 1971 elections, KGB approved establishment of a secret fund of 2.5 million rubles (approx. Rs. 7.5 Crore in 1971, *check link in source*) for the operations in India for the coming years.\n\n4. Indira Gandhi was totally against the CIA (obvious her being sponsored by KGB), she sent a letter to the then PM of Sri Lanka, Bandarnaike, attaching fake/forged CIA documents and planted articles in the Indian Newspapers by the KGB. As a result PM Bandarnaike setup a committee to investigate CIA threat to Sri Lanka.\n\n5. There were irregularities in the 1971 elections which invalidated Mrs. Gandhi‚Äôs election as MP. Later she persuaded the President and the cabinet towards declaring a National emergency.\n\n6. On 26th June, she declared National Emergency - Media was censored, opposition leaders were jailed/house arrested.\n\n&gt;More than 110,000+ people were arrested and detained without trial.  \nReports from the New Delhi main residency, headed from 1975 to 1977 by Leonid Shebarshin, claimed (probably greatly exaggerated) credit for using its agents of influence to persuade Mrs Gandhi to declare the emergency.\n\n7. Till 1975, more than **10 million rubles** (Back then Rs. 30 Crore = Rs. 3000 Lakh) were spent to support Mrs. Gandhi and to undermine her opponents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nl9lke84io961.png?width=495&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=959d58a12aa89603bd553bec59fdb3546ae8ee1d\n\n 8. There were claims that Mrs Gandhi tried to prevent the Janata Party from taking the power with the backing of Indian Army High Command but failed.\n\n9. Under Janata Party, the active measures of KGB became difficult.\n\n&gt;Articles planted by the KGB in the Indian press declined sharply from 1,980 in 1976 to 411 in 1977.\n\n10. In 1984 after Mrs. Gandhi sent troops into the Golden Temple at Amritsar, there was evidence concluding the planned assassination of Mrs. Gandhi by the Pakistan and Afghanistan Intelligence.\n\n&gt;On 31 October she was shot dead by two Sikh guards in the garden of her house. Predictably, some conspiracy theorists were later to argue that the guards had been working for the CIA. Though the Centre probably did not originate this conspiracy theory, attempting to implicate the Agency in the assassination of Mrs Gandhi became one of the chief priorities of KGB active measures in India over the next few years.\n\nIt was also revealed that  The Soviets supplied clandestine money to the Congress and individual politicians, with up to 40% of Indira Gandhi‚Äôs parliamentarians receiving political contributions from Moscow, a recently declassified CIA says, mirroring similar assertions in highly classified KGB records leaked in 2005.\n\n The CIA report dated December 1985, on the prevailing Soviet influence in India, is heavily redacted but says that Moscow was deeply involved in the Indian political process through covert contributions to parties and individuals.  \n\n\n ‚ÄúAs many as 40% Congress MPs in Mrs Gandhi‚Äôs last government had received Soviet political contributions,‚Äù the report titled ‚ÄúThe Soviets in India‚Äù reads, adding that ‚Äúthe Soviet embassy maintains a large reserve of rupees for various uses ‚Äî including clandestine payments to Congress politicians.‚Äù  \n\n\n The CIA report was similar to claims in a 2005 book by former KGB operative Vasili Mitrokhin who smuggled thousands of secret documents out from the Soviet Union. The documents claimed that Indira Gandhi was sent money in suitcases for the Congress party and the KGB had funded election campaigns of former defence minister VK Krishna Menon, besides four other Union ministers in the 1970s.  \n\n\n The CIA documents accessed by ET allege Soviets provided kickbacks to the Congress party through arrangements with Indian businessmen. It also named the CPI and CPM as major benefactors of Soviet funding. ‚ÄúSoviet funding reaches the two Communist parties, the CPI and CPM through a combination of kickback schemes, normal business transactions and direct cash payments,‚Äù the report said.  \n\n\n The CIA‚Äôs assessment then was that the funding by the KGB gave ready access to many leaders and helped Moscow influence Indian policies. In the leaked KGB papers revealed by Mitrokhin too, India is described as a model of the KGBs infiltration in third world governments, with scores of sources across the government.  \n\n\n Or as the Telegraph describes the Mitrokhin Archive leaks from the former Soviet spy, "Even the Soviets were amazed by the workings of the INC, It seemed as if the whole country was up for sale."\n\nSource :[Documents reveal Nehru govt shared information on Netaji\'s family with MI5](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/documents-reveal-nehru-govt-shared-information-on-netaji-s-family-with-mi5/story-ITBOB2mIlEXIDe8YdJoITL.html)\n\nSource: [Why Did the Government Spy on Netaji‚Äôs Kin for More Than Two Decades?](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-did-the-government-spy-on-netajis-kin-for-more-than-two-decades)\n\nSource: [Nehru spied on Bose family for 20 years, declassified papers reveal](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-3032682/Nehru-spied-Bose-family-20-years-Declassified-papers-reveal-IB-snooped-family-s-letters-followed-tracked-visitors.html)\n\nSource: [Historical currency converter with official exchange rates from 1953](https://fxtop.com/en/historical-currency-converter.php?A=1&amp;C1=RUB&amp;C2=INR&amp;DD=17&amp;MM=08&amp;YYYY=1971&amp;B=1&amp;P=&amp;I=1&amp;btnOK=Go!)\n\nSource: India‚Äôs biggest cover-up\n\nSource: The Mitrokhin Archives I and II ([https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/collection/52/mitrokhin-archive](https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/collection/52/mitrokhin-archive))\n\nSource: [Secret government papers raise mystery of Netaji\'s missing treasure](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-3082358/Mystery-Netaji-s-missing-treasure-Secret-government-papers-reveal-Nehru-told-Bose-s-missing-war-chest-100kg-gold-jewels-former-PM-failed-order-probe.html)\n\nSource : [http://netajipapers.gov.in](http://netajipapers.gov.in/)\n\n[https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/the-kgb-papers-it-seemed-like-the-entire-country-was-for-sale/cid/1023636](https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/the-kgb-papers-it-seemed-like-the-entire-country-was-for-sale/cid/1023636)\n\nSource:[https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP86T00586R000400490007-7.pdf](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP86T00586R000400490007-7.pdf) (CIA Source,open at your own discretion)'<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'krkmzq'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'The Manusmriti was heavily altered. No I am not speaking out of my ass. Please read the post.'<br />Body: "I've noticed many people have this wrong impression that Manusmriti is casteist and against women. \n\nYou are right. THE CURRENT VERSION of Manusmriti definitely has verses that are casteist and against women. \n\nHowever, there are also a good number of verses that are totally opposite to this. There are two explanations. Either Manu was completely insane and wrote down contradictory verses. \n\nOr the Manusmriti was later altered. \n\nWe have one instances in which it was plausible that the Manusmriti was altered. Max Muller's translation. He was a German working for the British. Coincidentally, *his* translation is currently the ONLY AVAILABLE version of the Manusmriti. Interesting eh? We have alternate versions of pretty much all Hindu texts, but somehow there's only one for Manusmriti. \n\nI claim that the Manusmriti has been altered by the British because if you read through this, you'll see that the altered verses are so utterly different in ideology and thought that they really seem like they belong in a separate book.\n\nI have listed below all the contradicting verses I could find. There are many of them so this comment is going to be LONG. I won't hold it against you if you wanna just skim through it. But I highly suggest you please read this through. \n\nGet a glass of water. This is a fairly long read for a reddit post. \n\nLet us look at all the casteist verses. \n\n&gt;For the welfare of humanity the supreme creator Brahma, gave birth to the Brahmins from his mouth, the Kshatriyas from his shoulders, the Vaishyas from his thighs and Shudras from his feet. (Manu‚Äôs code I-31,)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;God said the duty of a Shudra is to serve the upper varnas faithfully with devotion and without grumbling. (Manu 1-91) Manu is not satisfied with this. He wants this servile status of the Shudras to be expressed in the names and surnames of persons belonging to that community.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Manu says:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Let the first part of a Brahman‚Äôs name denote something auspicious, a Kshatriya‚Äôs be connected with power, and a Vaishyas with wealth but a Shudra‚Äôs express something contemptible. (Manu II. 31.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The second part of a Brahmin‚Äôs name shall be a word implying happiness, of a Kshatriya‚Äôs (a word) implying protection, of a Vaishya‚Äôs a term expressive of thriving and of a Shudra‚Äôs an expression denoting service. (Manu II. 32.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A hundred year old Kshatriya must treat a ten year old Brahmin boy as his father. (Manu 11-135)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Brahmin should never invite persons of other varnas for food. In case, the latter begs the Brahmin for food, the Brahmin may give them some left-over. Even these left-over must be served not by the Brahmin but by his servants outside the house. (Manu II2).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He who instructs Shudra pupils and he whose teacher is a Shudra shall become disqualified for being invited to a shradha. (Manu III. 156.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A Shudra is unfit of receive education. The upper varnas should not impart education or give advice to a Shudra. It is not necessary that the Shudra should know the laws and codes and hence need not be taught. Violators will go to as amrita hell. (Manu IV-78 to 81)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;‚ÄúLet him not dwell in a country where the rulers are Shudras.‚Äù (Manu IV. 61)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He must never read the Vedas in the presence of the Shudras. (Manu IV. 99.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Any country, where there are no Brahmins, of where they are not happy will get devastated and destroyed. (Manu VIII-20 to 22)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A Brahmana who is only a Brahman by decent i.e., one who has neither studied nor performed any other act required by the Vedas may, at the king‚Äôs pleasure, interpret the law to him i.e., act as the judge, but never a Shudra (however learned he may be). (Manu VIII. 20.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Kingdom of that monarch, who looks on while a Shudra settles the law, will sink low like a cow in the morass. (Manu VIII. 21.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Any Brahmin, who enslaves or tries to enslave a Brahmin, is liable for a penalty of no less than 600 PANAS. A Brahmin can order a Shudra to serve him without any remuneration because the Shudra is created by Brahma to serve the Brahmins. Even if a Brahmin frees a Shudra from slavery the Shudra continues to be a slave as he is created for slavery. Nobody has the right to free him. (Manu VIII-50,56 and 59)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A Shudra who insults a twice born man with gross invectives shall have his tongue cut out; for he is of low origin. (Manu VIII. 270.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If he mentions the names and castes of the (twice born) with contumely, an iron nail, ten fingers long, shall be thrust red hot into his mouth. (Manu VIII. 271.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If a Shudra arrogantly presumes to preach religion to Brahmins, the king shall have poured burning oil in his mouth and ears. Manu VIII. 272.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A Shudra who has an intercourse with a woman of the higher caste guarded or unguarded shall be punished n the following manner; if she was unguarded, he loses the offending part; if she was guarded then he should be put to death and his property confiscated.‚Äù (Manu VIII. 374.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A Brahman may compel a Shudra, whether bought or unbought, to do servile work for he is created by the creator to be the slave of a Brahmana. (Manu VIII. 413.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;No Shudra should have property of his own, He should have nothing of his own. The existence of a wealthy Shudra is bad for the Brahmins. A Brahman may take possession of the goods of a Shudra. (ManuVIII-417 &amp; X129)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A Brahman may seize without hesitation, if he be in distress for his subsistence, the goods of his Shudra. The Shudra can have only one occupation. This is one of the inexorable laws of Manu. says Manu. (Manu VIII. 417)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A Shudra who wants to just fill his stomach may serve a Vaishya. If he wants a permanent means of living he can serve a Kshatriya. But if he wants to go to heaven or wants higher or superior birth in the next generation he must serve a Brahmin. (ManuIX334 &amp; 335)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The most sacred duty of a Shudra is to serve the Brahmins, always, reciting the words ‚ÄúBrahman‚Äù with utmost devotion. Such a Shudra will get salvation. Otherwise he will die a worst death and will go to the worst hell. (Manu X-121)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But let a (Shudra) serve Brahmans, either for the sake of heaven, or with a view to both (this life and the next) for he who is called the servant of a Brahman thereby gains all his ends. (Manu X. 122.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The service of Brahmans alone is declared (to be) an excellent occupation for a Shudra for whatever else besides this he may perform will bear him no fruit. (Manu X. 123.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They must allot to him out of their own family (property) a suitable maintenance, after considering his ability, his industry, and the number of those whom he is bound to support. (Manu X. 124.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Brahmins to give Shudras food leftovers, old torn clothes, spoiled grain and old utensils (Manu X-125)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;No superfluous collection of wealth must be made by a Shudra, even though he has power to make it, since a servile man, who has amassed riches, becomes proud, and, by his insolence or neglect, gives pain to Brahmins. (Manu X. 129.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A Brahmin shall never beg from a Shudra, property for (performing) a sacrifice i.e., for religious purposes. All marriages with the Shudra were prescribed. Marriage with a woman belonging to any of three other classes was forbidden.\n\nBut you knew these. Now let us look at the stuff that contradicts these verses. \n\nHere are the verses from Manusmriti which says that Varna is based on qualification not on the basis of Birth. It also tells us Shudras are not supposed to be some lower caste but merely uneducated. \n\n&gt;2/157. As an elephant made of wood, as an antelope made of leather, such is an unlearned Brahmana; those three have nothing but the names (devoid of virtues respective to their kind).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2/28. This (human) body is made fit for (union with) Brahman by study of the Vedas, by vows, by burnt oblations, by (recitation of) sacred texts, by (acquisition of the) threefold sacred science, by offering (to gods, sages and manes), by (procreation of) sons, by great sacrifices, and by (the  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Srauta) rites.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(The above texts lays the qualifications to be acquired, with great dedication and effort at specified works, in order to become a Brahmin, and not merely by being born to a Brahmin father.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Varna of a person (caste or status in society) was decided after completion of his education.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Two births were considered for a person in Vedic period : first, when he was born to his parents, and, next, when he completed his education with due thoroughness. It was after second birth (twice born) that the Varna of person was determined.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2/148. But that birth which a teacher acquainted with Vedas entire, in accordance with the law, procures for him (the student) through the Savitr (Sun), is real and exempt from his birth, age or death.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2/146. Between him to whom one is physically born and him who gives (the knowledge of) the Vedas, the giver of the Veda is the more venerable father; for birth through arising in the knowledge of the Veda (ensures) eternal (reward) both in this (life) and that (afterlife).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A person who remained uneducated and devoid of the knowledge of Vedas was considered a Shudra. That is, the Shudra Varna was not based on birth but on merit.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;10/4. Brahmana, Kshatriya and the Vaisya castes (Varna) are twice-born (educated) but the fourth, the Shudra, has one birth only; there is no fifth (caste).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2/172. He who has not been initiated with teaching of the Vedas is like a Shudra.\n\nThen there is this verse in which Manu says not to insult someone for their circumstances of birth or their intelligence etc.\n\n&gt;4/141. Let him not insult those who have redundant limbs or are deficient in limbs, nor those destitute of knowledge, nor very aged men, nor those who have no beauty or wealth, nor those who are of low birth.\n\nAnd these verses explain why the varna system even exists.\n\n&gt;1/31. But for the sake of the prosperity of the worlds he caused the Brahmana, the Kshatriya, the Vaisya and the Shudra Varna origin in form of the body of the society : as its mouth, its arms, its thighs and its feet, respectively.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(Only the ignorant consider the Shudra as being originated from the feet of God.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1/87. But in order to protect this universe He (God), the most resplendent one, assigned separate (duties and) occupations to those as done in a body by mouth, arms, thighs, and feet.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1/88. To Brahmanas He assigned teaching and studying (the Vedas), sacrificing for their own benefit and for the welfare of others, giving and accepting (of alms).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1/89. The Kshatriya he commanded to protect the people, to bestow gifts, to offer sacrifices, to study (the Vedas), and to abstain from attaching himself to sensual pleasures;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1/90. The Vaisya to tend cattle, to bestow gifts, to offer sacrifices, to study (the Vedas), to trade, to lend money, and to cultivate the land.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1/91. One occupation only the Lord prescribed to the Shudra: to serve these (other) three castes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Manu considered anyone who is without knowledge or capacity for skilled deeds as a Shudra. So any uneducated person is fit only for being in the service, under the guidance, of others who have the requisite knowledge and skills.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Isn‚Äôt that how we are organised even today? According to Manu, all those blue collar workers would be Shudras. Bankers, CEOs, white collar jobs etc. would be Vaisyas. The Kshatriyas would be the military and ruling class. Brahmins would be the scientists and knowledge experts.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Manu also advises people to exert in order to acquire a higher Varna, and change his or her allotted Varna. The advisory leaves Varn Vyastha changeable, fluid, and not based on birth but on merit alone.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;10/65. (Thus) a Shudra attains the rank of a Brahmana, and (in a similar manner) a Brahmana sinks to the level of a Shudra; and know that it is the same with the offspring of a Kshatriya or of a Vaisya.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9/335. (A Shudra who is) pure, accompanies his betters and is gentle in his speech, free from pride, and always seeks a refuge with Brahmanas, attains a higher Varna (Brahmana, Kshatriya or Vaisya) based on his qualities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;4/245. A Brahmana who always connects himself with the most excellent (ones), and shuns all inferior ones, (himself) becomes most distinguished; by an opposite conduct he becomes a Shudra.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Is it not said : the company one keeps makes a man better or worse ?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2/103. But he who does not worship in morning, nor in the evening, is like a Shudra and he shall be excluded, just like a Shudra, from all the duties and rights of an Arya (one of noble qualities).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2/168. A twice-born man who, not having studied the Vedas, applies himself to other (and worldly study), soon falls, even while living, to the condition of a Shudra; and so do his descendants (after him).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2/126. A Brahmana who does not know the form of returning a salutation, they must not be saluted by a learned man; they must be considered as a Shudra.\n\nA Sudra too can teach the other castes.\n\n&gt;2/238. He who possesses faith may receive pure learning even from a man of lower caste (Shudra), the highest law even from the lowest, and an excellent wife even from a base family.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2/241. It is prescribed that in times of distress (a student) may learn (the Vedas) from one who is not a Brahmana; and that he shall walk behind and serve (such a) teacher, as long as the instruction lasts.\n\nSuperior rights given by Manu to Shudras.\n\n&gt;2/136. Wealth, kindred, age, (the due performance of) rites, and, fifthly, sacred learning are titles to respect; but each later-named (cause) is more weighty (than the preceding ones).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2/137. Whatever man of the three (higher) castes possesses most of those five, both in number and degree, that man is worthy of honour among them; and (so is) also a Shudra who has entered the tenth (decade of his life).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In above text Manu gives respect to any Shudra who is in tenth decade of life. That is, anybody who lives long enough transcends the Varna Vyavastha.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3/116. After the Brahmanas, the kinsmen, and the servants have dined, the householder and his wife may afterwards eat of what remains.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Householders are advised by Manu to dine after Shudras or the servants.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;8/335. Neither a father, nor a teacher, nor a friend, nor a mother, nor a wife, nor a son, nor a domestic priest must be left unpunished by a king, if they do not keep within their duty.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;8/336. Where another common man would be fined one karshapana, the king shall be fined one thousand; that is the settled rule.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;8/337. In (a case of) theft the guilt of a Shudra shall be eightfold, that of a Vaisya sixteen fold, that of a Kshatriya two-and-thirtyfold ‚Ä¶  \n&gt;  \n&gt;8/338. ‚Ä¶ that of a Brahmana sixty-fourfold, or quite a hundredfold, or (even) twice four-and-sixtyfold; (each of them) knowing the nature of the offence.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Manu advises strict punishment for a higher Varna : punishing the Brahmana many times more than a lower Varna, say, a Shudra.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The above text is evidence of Manu‚Äôs unbiased social hierarchy and structure. He considered a behavioural error as being more unpardonable in case of the learned one than for the ignorant.\n\nFollowing are the examples of changing of Varn Vyastha in the past:\n\n&gt;1. Rishi Brahma, son Manu Swayambhu himself, was born to a Brahmana but became a Kshatriya king.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2. Manu‚Äôs eldest son, Priyavrat, became a king, a Kshatriya.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3. Out of Manu‚Äôs ten sons seven became kings while three became Brahmanas. Their names were Mahavir, Kavi and Savan. (Ref Bhagwat Puran Chap. 5)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;4. Kavash Ailush was born to a Shudra and attained the highest Varna of a Rishi. He became mantra-drashta to numerous hymns in Rig Veda : 10th Mandal.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;5. Jabala‚Äôs son, Satyakaam, born from unknown father became Rishi by his qualities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;6. Matang became a Rishi after his birth in low Varna.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;7. Maharishi Valmiki was born in inferior Varna and became a Rishi.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;8. Mahatma Vidur was born to a Dasi (maid) and became the prime minister to king Dhritarastra.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9. Raja Vishvanath, a Kshatriya, became a Brahmana ‚Äì Rishi Vishwamitra.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There are many examples of Varn Vyastha to inferior level:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1. Ravan king of Lanka, who was son of a Brahmana Rishi Pultasya, became a Rakshasa.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2. Shri Ram‚Äôs ancestor, Raja Raghu‚Äôs son, Pravidh, was declared of inferior Varna due to lack of qualities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3. Shri Ram‚Äôs ancestor, Raja Samar‚Äôs son, Asmanjas, was declared a Shudra due to his bad qualities.\n\nIf you've read till here, then there's still a little more. Now let us come to women. \n\nBelow are all the verses that describe women in a derogatory fashion. \n\n&gt;1. ‚ÄúSwabhav ev narinam ‚Ä¶..‚Äù ‚Äì 2/213.

Do you all remember that the Christian Inquisition targeted red haired women because they were assumed to be witches?! And by the way, since when did India have red haired women? Why would the Manusmriti say red haired women if redheads are not ethnic to India? Hmmm?   \n&gt;  \n&gt;5. ‚ÄúNraksh vraksh ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..‚Äù ‚Äì 3/9.

In case a Brahman man marries Shudra woman, their son will be called ‚ÄòParshav‚Äô or ‚ÄòShudra‚Äô because his social existence is like a dead body.\n\nNow let us look at the verses which directly contradicts all of this and praises women.\n\nImportance of happy women\n\n&gt;3.55. A father, brother, husband or brother-in-law should keep their daughter, sister, wife or sister-in-law happy and pleased through gentle words, respectful behavior, gifts etc. Those who desire prosperity should ensure that women in their family are always happy and do not face miseries.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3.57. A family where women remain unhappy due to misdeeds of their men is bound to be destroyed. And a family where women are always happy is bound to prosper forever.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3.58. A family- where women feel insulted or discriminated against and curse their menfolk- is destroyed in same manner as poison kills all those who eat it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3.59. One desiring glory should ensure that he keeps women in the family by giving them respect and pleasing them with good ornaments, dresses, food. Women should always be revered under all circumstances.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3.62. A person who does not keep her wife happy causes misery for entire family. And if wife is happy, entire family appears as happiness incarnate.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9.26. Women give birth to next generation. They enlighten the home. They bring fortune and bliss. Hence women are synonymous to Prosperity.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This shloka forms the basis of women being called Ghar ki Laxmi or ‚ÄòGoddess of Fortune in Home‚Äò in India even till today.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9.28. Woman is the source of all kinds of happiness in all generations ‚Äì be it from children, or from noble benevolent deeds or through conjugal bliss or through service of elders.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In other words, woman is the primary source of bliss in many forms ‚Äì sometimes as mother, sometimes as daughter, sometimes as wife and sometimes as a partner in spiritual deeds. It also means that participation of women is necessary for conduct of any religious or spiritual activity.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9.96. Man and Woman are incomplete without each other. Hence the most ordinary religious duty would demand participation of both.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thus, those who deny Vedas or Vedic rituals to women are anti-Hindu and anti-Humanity.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;4.180. A wise man should not indulge in fights and arguments with his family members including mother, daughter and wife.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9.4. A father who does not marry his daughter to a deserving groom deserves condemnation. A husband who does not fulfill just demands of her wife deserves condemnation. A son who does not take care of her widow mother deserves condemnation.\n\nPolygamy is a sin\n\n&gt;9.101. Husband and Wife should remain together till death. They should not approach any other partner, nor commit adultery. This, in summary, is the Dharma or religion of all human beings.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thus those societies which justify polygamy or sex-slavery or temporary marriage are bound to suffer miseries because they neglect the core tenet of Dharma.\n\nAutonomy of Women\n\n&gt;9.11.  Women should be provided autonomy and leadership in managing the finances, maintaining hygiene, spiritual and religious activities, nutrition and overall management of home.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9.12. A woman who is kept constrained in a home by noble men (husband, father, son) is still insecure. Thus it is futile to restrict women. Security of women would come only through her own capabilities and mindset.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This shloka explains the futility to attempting to restrict a woman to home in name of providing her security. On contrary, to secure her, she should be given the right training so that she can defend herself and avoid getting misled by bad company. The prevailing notion of cornering women within a small home is against Manu‚Äôs ideology.\n\nProtection of Women\n\n&gt;9.6. Even a weak husband should attempt to protect his wife.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9.5 Women should keep themselves away from vices. Because when women lose character, the entire society is destroyed.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;5.149. A woman should always ensure that she is protected. It is duty of father, husband and son to protect her.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Protection is not restriction. See the section on Autonomy of Women. Verse 9.12 tells that you should not constrain women in a home. \n\nMarriage of Women\n\n&gt;9.89. It is better to keep the daughter unmarried than force her to marry an undeserving person.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9.90-91. A woman can choose her own husband after attaining maturity. If her parents are unable to choose a deserving groom, she can herself choose her husband.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thus the concept of parents deciding the groom for their daughter is against Manu. A mature daughter has full rights to choose her husband. Parents should act as facilitators for the marriage and not final decision makers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And this is supported in ancient texts. Mahabharata and Ramayana. Draupadi and Sita both chose their husbands through Swayamvara. Male suitors had to go through a selection process and the final choice was in the woman's hand for whom she wanted to marry. \n\nProperty Rights of Women\n\n&gt;9.130. A daughter is equivalent to a son. In her presence, how can any one snatch away her right over the property.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9.131. A daughter alone has the right over personal property of her mother.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thus, as per Manu, while daughter has equal share as her brothers over property of her father, she has exclusive rights over property of her mother. The reason for this special treatment of women is to ensure that women are never at mercy of anyone. After all happy dignified women form the foundation of a happy society!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9.212-213. If a person has no kins or wife, then his wealth be distributed equally among his brothers and sisters. If the elder brother refuses to give due share to other brothers and sisters, he is punishable by law.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To further ensure safety of women, Manu recommended harsh punishments for those who rob away wealth of a woman, even if they are her relatives.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;8.28-29. If a woman is alone because she has no children, or no men to provide for her security in her family, or is widow, or whose husband has gone abroad, or who is unwell, then it is duty of the government to ensure her safety and security. If her wealth is robbed by her relatives or friends, then the government should provide strict punishment to the culprits and have her wealth returned back.\n\nProhibition of Dowry\n\n&gt;3.52. Those relatives who rob away or thrive on wealth, property, vehicles or dresses of a woman or her family are wiliest of people.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thus any kind of dowry is a strict NO NO as per Manu Smriti. No one should dare attempt to take away the property of a woman.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The next shloka takes this concept further and states that even slightest exchange of tangible items amounts to sale/purchase and hence against principles of noble marriage. In fact Manu Smriti suggests that a marriage along with dowry is marriage of ‚ÄòDevils‚Äô or Asuri Vivah.\n\nStrict Punishment for harming Women\n\n&gt;8.323. Those who abduct women should be given death sentence.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9.232. Those who kill women, children or scholarly virtuous people should be given strictest punishment.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;8.352. Those who rape or molest women or incite them into adultery should be given harshest punishment that creates fear among others to even think of such a crime.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;8. 275. One should be punished if he puts false allegations or demeans mother, wife or daughter.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;8.389. Those who abandon their mother, father, wife or children without any reasonable reason should face severe punishments.\n\nLadies First\n\n&gt;The concept of Ladies First seems to originate from Manu Smriti.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2.138. A man in a vehicle should give way to the following ‚Äì aged person, diseased person, one carrying burden, groom, king, student and a woman.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3.114. One should feed the following even before feeding the guests ‚Äì newly married women, girls, and pregnant women.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThere is such overwhelming evidence that the Manusmriti was altered. Just looking at the contradictions should tell you which verses are original and which are not.\n\nI am very sorry for the extremely long post but this HAD to be said. It is infuriating to see people ignorantly commenting shit about the Manusmriti without knowing how much alterations have been done to it. \n\nThere is one user I want to personally thank for opening my eyes to this since I too had once hated Manusmriti thinking it ruined Hinduism. Now I know it is a victim of distortion. \n\nI really hope this opens your eyes too. History is not what was told to us. Even our own texts must be scrutinized carefully, lest we end up believing wrong things."<br />Author: 'Darkstorm999'<br />id: 'kr4a72'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm üïâÔ∏è</li>

It\'s basically a male philosophy which asks men to simply pull away from marriages and serious relationships and focus on themselves because they say the situation is completely biased against men - live in to divorce, the laws are meant just to screw men and give women immense power to completely screw men , which they don\'t hesitate to use.\n\nSo that\'s what MGTOW is , briefly.

<li>Title: "The Three Strike Rule - Here's how you and me, average non-political Hindus can handle the people who vilely insult our culture and religion with no sense of shame for the act"<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j1elvtdtrb961.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f17c232470a2a69fdf6d9b87fc3ad4e76d69d7f\n\nIf you\'re not much in-depth aware with the Mahabharata you might be wondering why this image? What\'s the context here and even if there\'s a context then what relation does this image have with those who mock and insult our culture with the vilest of words?\n\nThe answer we seek lies in the  Shishupal-vadh episode of the Mahabharata.\n\n The [Mahabharata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata) states that Shishupala was born with three eyes and four arms. His parents were inclined to cast him out but were warned by a voice (Akashvani) not to do so, as his time had not come. It also foretold that his superfluous bodyparts would disappear when a certain person took the child into his lap and that he would eventually die at the hands of that same person. Coming to visit his cousin,Lord [Krishna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna) placed the child on his lap and the extra eye and arms disappeared, thus indicating Shishupala\'s death was destined at the hands of Krishna. In the Mahabharata, Shishupala\'s mother persuaded her nephew,Lord Krishna, that he would pardon his cousin Shishupala for a hundred offences/insults.\n\nWhen [Yudhishthira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yudhishthira) undertook the [Rajasuya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasuya) Yajna, he sent [Bhima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhima) to obtain the fealty of Shishupala, now king after his father\'s death. Shishupala accepted Yudhishthira\'s supremacy with no protest, and was invited to the final ceremony at [Indraprastha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indraprastha).\n\nAt that event, the [Pandavas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandavas) decided that Krishna would be the special honoured guest of the sacrificial ceremony. This angered Shishupala and he started insulting Krishna, calling him a mere cowherd and worthless to be honoured as a king.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shishupala#cite_note-3) He also started insulting [Bhishma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhishma), calling his vow to remain a [celibate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibate) throughout life as an act of cowardice. Bhishma became furious and threatened Shishupala, but Krishna calmed him down. Through this act, he committed his 100th sin and was pardoned by Krishna. When he insulted Krishna again, he committed his 101st sin. Krishna then released his [Sudarshana Chakra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudarshana_Chakra) on Shishupala, killing him on the spot.\n\n( www.wisdomlib.org (9 January 2015). ["Shishupala\'s Liberation \\[Chapter 6\\]"](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/mahabharata/d/doc118386.html))\n\nSo what is it that we gather from here? When even Krishna(The Supreme Lord of the universe) only held back from liberating Shishupal for the vile words he used for the lord himself 100 times only because of the promise he\'d made to his aunt, The lord himself didn\'t forgive the 101th vile insult thrown at him and here we are, mere humans with not enough patience to bear these insults even once,let alone a 100 times and henceforth, I propose the *Three-strike rule* which any of us ordinary working Hindus can use against these animalistic nonsensical creatures. And in the words to follow, I will be illustrating through example to you how we use this rule against these people-  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA user on Indiadisscussion sub   under a meta post was having the time of her life, user was a satrangi bengalin and the whole thread was a garbage can of her throwing insults upon insults on people, labeling people from other states as foreigners, fools, demonising Hinduism, calling all Brahmins as devil\'s own incarnations and although I had no business there, I couldn\'t stand my own culture and country being vilified by a grown up child with such an abusive and hateful mindset.    \n\nSo I tried reasoning with the woman/whoever "it" was since "it" hadn\'t identified it\'s gender.\n\nStrike 1- The first time I tried arguing politely, the user called me a demonic Aryan for my Brahmin identity\n\nStrike 2- The user went on to say that all languages except Bangla in the country were perverted form of Islamic languages and all North-Indians except the Bengalis with mongoloid features (which the user for some weird reason seemed proud of) were sub-humans because they were all Aryans.\n\nStrike 3- The user goes on to say, on a totally irrelevant topic to the argument i.e Kashmir, and how Kashmir would be indepedent one day from us North Indian pigs and the Kashmiris and "it" (the user) would walk on all our graves to achieve this goal. That\'s a separatist comment and that\'s it.\n\nThe user\'s three strikes are now over and it deserves the punishment I\'m going to give it.\n\nSo I went on to file a cyber-complaint for the separatism and the anti-India agenda that the user endorsed openly on the Internet while having the benefits of an Indian citizenship. I also tagged the NIA and the Delhi Police Cyber Cell on twitter to the link to the user\'s comment.\n\nThen I inform the user that its comment has been reported to the authorities and the creature replies "Oh really, nothing will happen" and "I will not be silenced by the likes of you, you\'re the scum of the earth", these are not the exact quotes but the gist of it.\n\nEventually the creature deleted its comments 10-15 minutes later and I went on to take my complaint back and delete the tweeted which tagged the NIA and MHA because the lesson had been taught well. Now the creature would think twice before abuse the anonymity it has online,simply because she/it knows that there can be consequences. So much for "I\'ll not be silenced by the likes of you" brave satrangi didi.\n\nAll we need to do is act bhratas and bhaginis,nobody will come with a magic wand to wipe these people out for us, it\'s high time we took matters into our own hands. The only prime reason why we still face so much vile abuse from these indecent creatures is because we don\'t act and hence they don\'t have to bear any consequences and therefore, the moment we start acting on ground, actually giving them consequences for their actions, it is that very moment when they will stop spewing horseshit without thinking twice, even when under an anonymous user when online.\n\nAnd that\'s the Three Strike Rule that we all can follow as a simple grassroots solution to counter, reduce  and eventually stop all the Hinduphobia both online and in real life(like the "stand-up artist" who has finally faced consequences for his words under the same rule, unsaid,but still the same rule)\n\nMy only request to y\'ll who want Hinduphobia to end as well, visit their subreddits,their forums, the places where these vile offenders are active in, engage with them, try to reason with them, and do so very politely until they have used up their three strikes, and then take action, and finally remind them of the consequences now that you have already taken actions and there\'s a high chance the offender won\'t repeat this mistake in life again if they really like roaming free instead of the hassles of visiting the Police stations or even going to prison.\n\nAnd if you\'re not aware of what actions you should take in what specific scenario, here\'s a basic list of what you should do-\n\n1. Hateful post/comment against Hinduism/Sanatana culture - File a cyber complaint with your state\'s police\'s cyber cell, it\'s convenient,easy for everyone to file while staying in the comfort of their homes without much hassle. State Section 95 ,Section 124A or Section 153A or Section 153B or Section 292 or Section 293 or Section 295A of the Indian Penal Code as the reason, here are what the sections say-\n\n Section 153(A)\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hate_speech_laws_in_India&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3)\\]\n\nSection 153A of the Indian penal code says,[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_in_India#cite_note-IndianPenalCode-153A-Valinko-4) *inter alia*:\n\nWhoever (a) by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise, promotes or attempts to promote, on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, caste or community or any other ground whatsoever, disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities, or (b) commits any act which is prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities, and which disturbs or is likely to disturb the public tranquillity, . . . shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.\n\n### Section 295(A)[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hate_speech_laws_in_India&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4)]\n\nSection 295(A) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) enacted in 1927[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_in_India#cite_note-Insult_to_religion-5) says:[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_in_India#cite_note-IndianPenalCode-295A-Valinko-6)\n\nWhoever, with deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of any class of \\[citizens of India\\], \\[by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise\\], insults or attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of that class, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to \\[three years\\], or with fine, or with both.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_in_India#cite_note-7) \n\nTLDR- All these parts of the Indian Constitution all kinds of hate speech/literature including the ones with religious ground and it very well covers Stand-up comedy and social media posts and comments. All of these laws have a prison sentence for the offender if found guilty of violation.\n\n2.Hateful post/comment on India or any kind of seperatist endorsements/anti-India agenda - There are two ways to counter this- \n\n1. Follow the three strike rule\n\n2.

Do not reply to them anymore,I repeat do not respond to any of their "I\'ll not be silenced" rants anymore, the key here is fear. If you respond to their rants it just sends across the notion that you might not be serious with your action, your objective here is to not send the offender to jail or make them pay a fine but rather to teach a lesson that nothing is without consequences and hence when you do not reply to any of their rants later,it\'ll just send across a message that you\'re serious and would ignite a feeling of fear insider the offender. The result being that they\'ll think twice before spreading hate/Indophobia even under anonymous IDs from the next time onwards.\n\nOn a concluding note,stop being Gandhis my fellow trad Hindus, Gandhi had nothing to do with our cultures, and neither does Pacifism need a place in our hearts right now when our very civilization is under threats from all sides by various enemies. No better time is going to come for us all to be Krishnas and make these vile,abusive, animalistic and indecent Shishupals learn their lesson once and for all.\n\nSo take action as devout Hindus my fellow Bhratas and Bhaginis I plead you,take action.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **Jai Shri Krishna!**'<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'kqaz50'<br />Flair :Viraat Sanataniüö©</li>

<li>Title: 'The Purbiya Brahmins : A Short Military history'<br />Body: 'Throughout the history of the Indian subcontinent, many warrior peoples have graced the landscape and have established their hegemony in the regional military labour market. Indeed, the Marathas themselves, before carving out an autonomous territory for themselves, found profitable employment in the armies of the Bahmani Sultanate, the Vijaynagar Empire, the Deccani Successor Sultanates and eventually the Mughal Empire.\n\n\n\nAmong these many groups, one rose to prominence at the dawn of the 1st millennium AD, and remained on of the most dominant mercenary and landholding groups in the Northern half of the Subcontinent. These were the Purbiyas. The term itself, means the "Easterners" yet, the majority of these men came from Awadh, Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Baksar region. Hence, they were technically part of the North Western Frontier. \n\n\n\nRecruitment :\n\n\n\nThe Purbiyas were recruited from among the Kanyakubja and Bhumihar Brahmins of Awadh, Bhojpuri and Baksar regions as well as the Rajputs of these regions.\n\n\n\nThe process of recruitment itself is shrouded in the fog of history, but what we do know, is that the strong caste affiliations of the Kanyakubja and Bhumihars, allowed them to acquire employment in large numbers in Medieval Armies. The local Brahmin and Rajput zamindars, recruited men from within the Kanyakubja, Bhumihar and to a lesser extent the Rajputs clans and presented these levies to the Nawabs, Subehadar or Imperial recruiters themselves and assured their participation in the coming campaigns at a cost, which would be the combined salary of the soldiers and would also be used to pay for their equipment, if they didn\'t bring their own.\n\n\n\nUnlike the eastern Hindu warrior caste of Rajputana\'s Rajputs who were famous for their cavalry charges and skills on the saddle, the Purbiya Brahmins gained recognition as reliable infantry troops and dragoon-type troops.\n\n\n\nWith the introduction of gunpowder in warfare, these Brahmins, who were in close proximity to sources of saltpeter, which was essential for gunpowder production, became renowned as musketeers and dragoons.\n\n\n\n\nWe find massive contingents of Purbiyas beung recruited in the armies of Marwar, Nawabs of Awadh, the rulers of Malwa and Rajputana, the Mughal Emperors and eventually the East India Company.\n\n\n\nWe find that once their military traditions were established by the 17th century, English and Mughal officials noted, how the Brahmin youth would be sent into a "tiger tank" where he would only be allowed to emerge out once he had slain the beast, being reborn as a "fearless warrior".\n\n\n\nThis recruitment drive from Malwa saw the large influx of Purbiya soldiers into the region. Many of the local chieftains in Malwa depended heavily on Purbiya soldiers such as Silhadi who eventually became known as a Purbiya himself. The presence of Purbiya mercenaries in Gujarat are referenced in 16th and 17th century Persian chronicles including many Purbiya gunners serving in the army of Bahadur Shah of the Gujarat Sultanate in 1535.\n\n\n\nPrior to 1857, the British East India Company preferred to recruit Purbiya Brahmins, who they designated as "The military arm of the Brahmin caste" , or simply "Easterners". The Bengal Army of the East India Company preferred to recruit its sepoys from the Brahmins of Awadh and Bihar, in part because they had an average height of 5\'8", an important consideration in an army that valued impressive appearance amongst its soldiers.\n\n\n\nWe find that during the 17th and 18th centuries, until the revolt of 1857, these Brahmins held a monopoly in the Bengal Army. Between 1814-1815, Brahmins constituted roughly 42% of the Bengal Army, while the Rajputs were roughly 34% and the remainder were Ahirs, Jats and Muslims.\n\n\n\nTheir Own Kingdom :\n\n\n\nWhile the Purbiya Brahmins had been great zamindars and landholders in the Medieval period in the Awadh and Bhojpur and Baksar region, their aspirations for autonomy would find expression in the rise of the Narayan Dynasty and the emergence of the King of Benares. \n\n\nMost of the area currently known as Varanasi was acquired by Mansa Ram, a zamindar of Utaria. His son Balwant Singh, the ruler of Utaria in 1737,took over the Jagirs of Jaunpur, Varanasi, and Chunar, in 1737 from the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah of Delhi . Other places under the kingship of Kashi Naresh were Chandauli, Gyanpur, Chakia, Latifshah, Mirzapur, Nandeshwar, Mint House and Vindhyachal. With the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Kanyakubja and Bhumihars Brahmins under the leadership of Kashi Naresh strengthened their sway in the area south of Avadh and in the fertile rice growing areas of Benares, Jaunpur, Gorakhpur, Basti, Deoria, Azamgarh, Ghazipur, Ballia and Bihar and on the fringes of Bengal. \n\n\n\nThe strong clan organisation of the Purbiya Brahmins, brought success to the Kings of Benares .There were as many as 100,000 Brahmins backing the power of the Benares rajas in the districts of Benares, Gorakhpur and Azamgarh. This proved a decisive advantage when the dynasty faced a rival and the nominal suzerain, the Nawab of Oudh, in the 1750s and the 1760s. An exhausting guerrilla war, waged by the Benares ruler against the Oudh camp, using his troops, forced the Nawab to withdraw his main force. The region eventually ceded by the Nawab of Oudh to the Company Rule in India in 1775, who recognized Benares as a family dominion. Benares became a princely state in 1911. \n\n\nTheir Decline :\n\n\n\nThe Purbiya units of the Bengal Army played a major role in the Indian Rebellion of 1857 against the British. Mangal Pandey, a notable figure during the start of the mutiny, was a Purbiya serving in the 34th Bengal Native Infantry. Following the suppression of the uprising, British authorities decided not to recruit troops from the eastern plains, and the new Bengal Army was to be recruited primarily from the Sikh and Muslim communities of the Punjab.\n\n\n\nWe find that the vilification and vitriol that the British held for the "Pandies" gained more ground and began with a religious fervor post this period as they felt that the Brahmins were among the greatest threats to their rule.\n\n\n\nHence, the most influential and sought after mercenaries/zamindars/martial race of the medieval period, lost their prominence, until the first and second World Wars, when the war demanded more men and finally the Purbiyas were recruited in greater proportions once again.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\n\nThe Purbiyas were excellent soldiers and this  was evident in the fact that they were recruited from the times of Rana Sanga to the Revolt of 1857, in almost any army, that wanted a reliable and proficient infantry component.\n\n\n\nIt was their string caste affiliation that brought them recruitment, regional autonomy and influence.\n\n\n\nYet, it was this very caste affiliation, that sprouted within them the roots of rebellion, when the English threatened their caste, their race, their identity. Hence, the Purbiyas set the company ablaze and were the main driving force behind the First Indian War of Independence. And while they did not gain independence, they forced the end of the Company rule, decades before it would have.\n\n\n\nTheir struggle also inspired many more generations to come, to take up the gun and purge colonial rule with iron and blood.\n\n\n\nThese valiant blood-brothers and descendants of Lord Parshuram, hold a special place in Indian military history and since they are often ignored, I felt this as a good opportunity to tell their tale.\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\nSources :\n\n\n\n"Peasants fighting for a living in early modern North India" by Dirk H.A Kolf\n\n\n\nNaukar, Rajput, and Sepoy: The Ethnohistory of the Military Labour Market of Hindustan, 1450-1850 by Dirk H.A Kolf\n\n\n\nRecruiting, Drafting, and Enlisting: Two Sides of the Raising of Military Forces by Peter Karsten\n\n\n\nA Matter of Honour by Philip Mason'<br />Author: 'PushyamitraShunga1st'<br />id: 'kq4tn8'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture (Bharatiye Itihaas aur Sanskriti)</li>

<li>Title: 'THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MODERN LEFTISM AND EXPLORING THE TIES BETWEEN LEFTISM AND ISLAMISM IN THE 21ST CENTURY- THE UNABOMBER MANIFESTO FOR THE TRADITIONAL INDIAN HINDU -'<br />Body: '  \n\n**THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MODERN LEFTISM**\n\n1. Almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled society. One of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world is leftism, so a discussion of the psychology of leftism can serve as an introduction to the discussion of the problems of modern society in general.\n\n2. But what is leftism? During the first half of the 20th century leftism could have been practically identified with socialism. Today the movement is fragmented and it is not clear who can properly be called a leftist. When we speak of leftists in this article we have in mind mainly socialists, collectivists, ‚Äúpolitically correct‚Äù types, feminists, gay and disability activists, animal rights activists and the like. But not everyone who is associated with one of these movements is a leftist. What we are trying to get at in discussing leftism is not so much movement or an ideology as a psychological type, or rather a collection of related types. Thus, what we mean by ‚Äúleftism‚Äù will emerge more clearly in the course of our discussion of leftist psychology.\n\n3. Even so, our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less clear than we would wish, but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any remedy for this. All we are trying to do here is indicate in a rough and approximate way the two psychological tendencies that we believe are the main driving force of modern leftism. We by no means claim to be telling the WHOLE truth about leftist psychology. Also, our discussion is meant to apply to modern leftism only. We leave open the question of the extent to which our discussion could be applied to the leftists of the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n4. The two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we call ‚Äúfeelings of inferiority‚Äù and ‚Äúoversocialization.‚Äù Feelings of inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole, while oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of modern leftism; but this segment is highly influential.\n\n**1.FEELINGS OF INFERIORITY**\n\n1.(a) By ‚Äúfeelings of inferiority‚Äù we mean not only inferiority feelings in the strict sense but a whole spectrum of related traits; low self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, depressive tendencies, defeatism, guilt, self- hatred, etc. We argue that modern leftists tend to have some such feelings (possibly more or less repressed) and that these feelings are decisive in determining the direction of modern leftism.\n\n(b) When someone interprets as derogatory almost anything that is said about him (or about groups with whom he identifies) we conclude that he has inferiority feelings or low self-esteem. This tendency is pronounced among minority rights activists, whether or not they belong to the minority groups whose rights they defend. They are hypersensitive about the words used to designate minorities and about anything that is said concerning minorities. The terms ‚Äúnegro,‚Äù ‚Äúoriental,‚Äù ‚Äúhandicapped‚Äù or ‚Äúchick‚Äù for an African, an Asian, a disabled person or a woman originally had no derogatory connotation. ‚ÄúBroad‚Äù and ‚Äúchick‚Äù were merely the feminine equivalents of ‚Äúguy,‚Äù ‚Äúdude‚Äù or ‚Äúfellow.‚Äù The negative connotations have been attached to these terms by the activists themselves. Some animal rights activists have gone so far as to reject the word ‚Äúpet‚Äù and insist on its replacement by ‚Äúanimal companion.‚Äù Leftish anthropologists go to great lengths to avoid saying anything about primitive peoples that could conceivably be interpreted as negative. They want to replace the world ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù by ‚Äúnonliterate.‚Äù They seem almost paranoid about anything that might suggest that any primitive culture is inferior to our own. (We do not mean to imply that primitive cultures ARE inferior to ours. We merely point out the hypersensitivity of leftish anthropologists.)\n\n(c) Those who are most sensitive about ‚Äúpolitically incorrect‚Äù terminology are not the average poor ghetto- dweller, illegal-immigrant, abused woman or disabled person, but a minority of activists, many of whom do not even belong to any ‚Äúoppressed‚Äù group but come from privileged strata of society. Political correctness has its stronghold among university professors, who have secure employment with comfortable salaries, and the majority of whom are heterosexual males and females from middle- to upper-middle-class families.\n\n(d) Many leftists have an intense identification with the problems of groups that have an image of being weak (women), defeated (Muslim ghetto-dwellers and other minorities), repellent (homosexuals) or otherwise inferior. The leftists themselves feel that these groups are inferior. They would never admit to themselves that they have such feelings, but it is precisely because they do see these groups as inferior that they identify with their problems. (We do not mean to suggest that women, muslims,xtians etc. ARE inferior; we are only making a point about leftist psychology.)\n\n(e) Feminists are desperately anxious to prove that women are as strong and as capable as men. Clearly they are nagged by a fear that women may NOT be as strong and as capable as men.\n\n(f) Leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being strong, good and successful. They hate India, they hate the idea of a united Aryavrat, they hate  males, they hate rationality. The reasons that leftists give for hating the Hindutva driven nation, etc. clearly do not correspond with their real motives. They SAY they hate Hindutva because it is warlike, imperialistic, sexist, ethnocentric and so forth, but where these same faults appear in socialist/communist-totalitarian countries or in primitive cultures(for example pre-oil boom Arabia), the leftist finds excuses for them, or at best he GRUDGINGLY admits that they exist; whereas he ENTHUSIASTICALLY points out (and often greatly exaggerates) these faults where they appear in the Post-Vedic Indian civilization. Thus it is clear that these faults are not the leftist‚Äôs real motive for hating India and the Hindutva. He hates a united Bharat and the idea of it because they are strong and successful in contrast to what his own conscious tells him.\n\n(g) Words like ‚Äúself-confidence,‚Äù ‚Äúself-reliance,‚Äù ‚Äúinitiative,‚Äù ‚Äúenterprise,‚Äù ‚Äúoptimism,‚Äù etc., play little role in the liberal and leftist vocabulary. The leftist is anti-individualistic, pro-collectivist. He wants society to solve everyone‚Äôs problems for them, satisfy everyone‚Äôs needs for them, take care of them. He is not the sort of person who has an inner sense of confidence in his ability to solve his own problems and satisfy his own needs. The leftist is antagonistic to the concept of competition because, deep inside, he feels like a loser.\n\n(h) Art forms that appeal to modern leftish intellectuals tend to focus on sordidness, defeat and despair, or else they take an orgiastic tone, throwing off rational control as if there were no hope of accomplishing anything through rational calculation and all that was left was to immerse oneself in the sensations of the moment.\n\n(i) Modern leftish philosophers tend to dismiss reason, science, objective reality and to insist that everything is culturally relative. It is true that one can ask serious questions about the foundations of scientific knowledge and about how, if at all, the concept of objective reality can be defined. But it is obvious that modern leftish philosophers are not simply cool-headed logicians systematically analyzing the foundations of knowledge. They are deeply involved emotionally in their attack on truth and reality. They attack these concepts because of their own psychological needs. For one thing, their attack is an outlet for hostility, and, to the extent that it is successful, it satisfies the drive for power. More importantly, the leftist hates science and rationality because they classify certain beliefs as true (i.e., successful, superior) and other beliefs as false (i.e., failed, inferior). The leftist‚Äôs feelings of inferiority run so deep that he cannot tolerate any classification of some things as successful or superior and other things as failed or inferior. This also underlies the rejection by many leftists of the concept of mental illness and of the utility of IQ tests. Leftists are antagonistic to genetic explanations of human abilities or behavior because such explanations tend to make some persons appear superior or inferior to others. Leftists prefer to give society the credit or blame for an individual‚Äôs ability or lack of it. Thus if a person is ‚Äúinferior‚Äù it is not his fault, but society‚Äôs, because he has not been brought up properly.\n\n(j) The leftist is not typically the kind of person whose feelings of inferiority make him a braggart, an egotist, a bully, a self-promoter, a ruthless competitor. This kind of person has not wholly lost faith in himself. He has a deficit in his sense of power and self-worth, but he can still conceive of himself as having the capacity to be strong, and his efforts to make himself strong produce his unpleasant behavior. \\[1\\] But the leftist is too far gone for that. His feelings of inferiority are so ingrained that he cannot conceive of himself as individually strong and valuable. Hence the collectivism of the leftist. He can feel strong only as a member of a large organization or a mass movement with which he identifies himself.\n\n(k) Notice the masochistic tendency of leftist tactics. Leftists protest by lying down in front of vehicles, they intentionally provoke police or ethno-segregationists to abuse them, etc. These tactics may often be effective, but many leftists use them not as a means to an end but because they PREFER masochistic tactics. Self-hatred is a leftist trait.\n\n(l) Leftists may claim that their activism is motivated by compassion or by moral principles, and moral principle does play a role for the leftist of the oversocialized type. But compassion and moral principle cannot be the main motives for leftist activism. Hostility is too prominent a component of leftist behavior; so is the drive for power. Moreover, much leftist behavior is not rationally calculated to be of benefit to the people whom the leftists claim to be trying to help. For example, if one believes that affirmative action is good for Abrahamics/other minorities/lower caste people, does it make sense to demand affirmative action in hostile or dogmatic terms? Obviously it would be more productive to take a diplomatic and conciliatory approach that would make at least verbal and symbolic concessions to upper caste Hindus who think that affirmative action discriminates against them. But leftist activists do not take such an approach because it would not satisfy their emotional needs. Helping Abrahamics/other minorities/lower caste people  is not their real goal. Instead, communal tensions serve as an excuse for them to express their own hostility and frustrated need for power. In doing so they actually harm Abrahamics/other minorities/lower caste people, because the activists‚Äô hostile attitude toward the upper caste Hindu majority tends to intensify communal hatred.\n\n(m) If our society had no social problems at all, the leftists would have to INVENT problems in order to provide themselves with an excuse for making a fuss.\n\n(n) We emphasize that the foregoing does not pretend to be an accurate description of everyone who might be considered a leftist. It is only a rough indication of a general tendency of leftism.\n\n**2.OVERSOCIALIZATION**\n\n2.(a) Psychologists use the term ‚Äúsocialization‚Äù to designate the process by which children are trained to think and act as society demands. A person is said to be well socialized if he believes in and obeys the moral code of his society and fits in well as a functioning part of that society. It may seem senseless to say that many leftists are oversocialized, since the leftist is perceived as a rebel. Nevertheless, the position can be defended. Many leftists are not such rebels as they seem.\n\n(b) The moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think, feel and act in a completely moral way. For example, we are not supposed to hate anyone, yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time or other, whether he admits it to himself or not. Some people are so highly socialized that the attempt to think, feel and act morally imposes a severe burden on them. In order to avoid feelings of guilt, they continually have to deceive themselves about their own motives and find moral explanations for feelings and actions that in reality have a non-moral origin. We use the term ‚Äúoversocialized‚Äù to describe such people. \\[2\\]\n\n(c) Oversocialization can lead to low self-esteem, a sense of powerlessness, defeatism, guilt, etc. One of the most important means by which our society socializes children is by making them feel ashamed of behavior or speech that is contrary to society‚Äôs expectations. If this is overdone, or if a particular child is especially susceptible to such feelings, he ends by feeling ashamed of HIMSELF. Moreover the thought and the behavior of the oversocialized person are more restricted by society‚Äôs expectations than are those of the lightly socialized person. The majority of people engage in a significant amount of naughty behavior. They lie, they commit petty thefts, they break traffic laws, they goof off at work, they hate someone, they say spiteful things or they use some underhanded trick to get ahead of the other guy. The oversocialized person cannot do these things, or if he does do them he generates in himself a sense of shame and self-hatred. The oversocialized person cannot even experience, without guilt, thoughts or feelings that are contrary to the accepted morality; he cannot think ‚Äúunclean‚Äù thoughts. And socialization is not just a matter of morality; we are socialized to conform to many norms of behavior that do not fall under the heading of morality. Thus the oversocialized person is kept on a psychological leash and spends his life running on rails that society has laid down for him. In many oversocialized people this results in a sense of constraint and powerlessness that can be a severe hardship. We suggest that oversocialization is among the more serious cruelties that human beings inflict on one another.\n\n(d) We argue that a very important and influential segment of the modern left is oversocialized and that their oversocialization is of great importance in determining the direction of modern leftism. Leftists of the oversocialized type tend to be intellectuals or members of the upper-middle class. Notice that university intellectuals \\[3\\] constitute the most highly socialized segment of our society and also the most left-wing segment.\n\n(e) The leftist of the oversocialized type tries to get off his psychological leash and assert his autonomy by rebelling. But usually he is not strong enough to rebel against the most basic values of society. Generally speaking, the goals of today‚Äôs leftists are NOT in conflict with the accepted morality. On the contrary, the left takes an accepted moral principle, adopts it as its own, and then accuses mainstream society of violating that principle. Examples: communal equality, equality of the sexes, helping poor people, peace as opposed to war, nonviolence generally, freedom of expression, kindness to animals. More fundamentally, the duty of the individual to serve society and the duty of society to take care of the individual. All these have been deeply rooted values of our society (or at least of its middle and upper classes \\[4\\] for a long time. These values are explicitly or implicitly expressed or presupposed in most of the material presented to us by the mainstream communications media and the educational system. Leftists, especially those of the oversocialized type, usually do not rebel against these principles but justify their hostility to society by claiming (with some degree of truth) that society is not living up to these principles.\n\n(f) Here is an illustration of the way in which the oversocialized leftist shows his real attachment to the conventional attitudes of our society while pretending to be in rebellion against it. Many leftists push for affirmative action, for moving women and lower castes/tribals/religious minorities into high-prestige jobs, for improved education in Islamic schools and more money for such schools; the way of life of the Islamic ‚Äúunderclass‚Äù they regard as a social disgrace. They want to integrate the black man into the system, make him a business executive, a lawyer, a scientist just like upper-middle-class Hindus and some prosperous minorities(Jews,Jains,Sikhs etc.). The leftists will reply that the last thing they want is to make the muslim man into a copy of the Hindu man(allegedly extremist, misogynist  and intolerant); instead, they want to preserve Islamic culture. But in what does this preservation of Islamic culture consist? It can hardly consist in anything more than eating Islamic-style food, clothing and going to a mosque(anything further plays right into the faith‚Äôs mainstream goal of the supremacist agenda of world domination and the genocide of the ‚Äúinfidels‚Äù and results in radicalization of the masses that follow Islam). In other words, it can express itself only in superficial matters. In all ESSENTIAL respects most leftists of the oversocialized type want to make the Hindu man conform to, poorer-class tribal ideals. They want to make him study deny science for a document that advocates flat-earth, become an tolerant or ‚Äúsilent‚Äù and ‚Äúobjective‚Äù to Islamic violence, spend his life respecting and admiring the tribalistic,primitive and perverted idea of an Islamic civilization to prove that staunch Islamic minorities are as good as the idea of a post-vedic Hindu civilization. They want to make Hindu fathers ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù like their Islamic counterparts, they want Hindu organizations to become ‚Äútolerant‚Äù, etc. But these are exactly the values of the cruel-tribalistic-regressive and a primitive system. The system couldn‚Äôt bother anyone more than it already does with what kind of halal music a man listens to, what kind of clothes the family females wear or what religion he believes in as long as he studies in an islamic school, holds an unquestionable belief in the Quran(and the Hadiths), disrupts the progress in communities of other religions, is a ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù man when it comes to being a ‚Äúgood husband‚Äù, is silent on the vast amount of precedences of Islamic extremism that have killed millions till date and so forth. In effect, however much he may deny it, the oversocialized leftist wants to integrate the Hindu man into the Islamic/Abrahamic system and make him adopt its values.Conversion either by fraud or sword is the main agenda of this leftist-Islam conjunct.\n\n(g) We certainly do not claim that leftists, even of the oversocialized type, NEVER rebel against the fundamental values of our society. Clearly they sometimes do. Some oversocialized leftists have gone so far as to rebel against one of modern society‚Äôs most important principles by engaging in physical violence. By their own account, violence is for them a form of ‚Äúliberation.‚Äù In other words, by committing violence they break through the psychological restraints that have been trained into them. Because they are oversocialized these restraints have been more confining for them than for others; hence their need to break free of them. But they usually justify their rebellion in terms of mainstream values. If they engage in violence they claim to be fighting against racism or the like.\n\n(h) We realize that many objections could be raised to the foregoing thumbnail sketch of leftist psychology. The real situation is complex, and anything like a complete description of it would take several volumes even if the necessary data were available. We claim only to have indicated very roughly the two most important tendencies in the psychology of modern leftism.\n\n(i) The problems of the leftist are indicative of the problems of our society as a whole. Low self-esteem, depressive tendencies and defeatism are not restricted to the left. Though they are especially noticeable in the left, they are widespread in our society. And today‚Äôs society tries to socialize us to a greater extent than any previous society. We are even told by experts how to eat, how to exercise, how to make love, how to raise our kids and so forth.\n\n\\#to be continued.....'<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'kpngob'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion (Vichaar-Vimersh)üó®Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è</li>

We ask you to come to us and give us enlightenment.\r\n\n4 Go to the wise unconquered One, ask thou of Indra, skilled in song,\r\nHim who is better than thy friends.\r\n\n5 Whether the men who mock us say, Depart unto another place,\r\nYe who serve Indra and none else;\r\n\n6 Or whether, God of wondrous deeds, all our true people call us blest,\r\nStill may we dwell in Indra's care.\r\n\n7 Unto the swift One bring the swift, man-cheering, grace of sacrifice,\r\nThat to the Friend gives wings and joy.\r\n\n8 Thou, Satakratu, drankest this and wast the Vrtras' slayer; thou\r\nHelpest the warrior in the fray.\r\n\n9 We strengthen, Satakratu, thee, yea, thee the powerful in fight,\r\nThat, Indra, we may win us wealth\n.\r\n10 To him the mighty stream of wealth, prompt friend ot'him who pours the juice,\r\nyea, to this Indra sing your song."<br />Author: 'GodSpeed1225'<br />id: 'kpft34'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture (Bharatiye Itihaas aur Sanskriti)</li>

People can have only 10 subscribers but their most successful viral video has thousands of views each week. People may not subscribe since it's a tutorial video.

<li>Title: "Thoughts on Modi's farm reforms?"<br />Body: "I think some Indian farmers need to recognise that the welfare of the nation is more important than their own greed. things cannot always be the same especially in such a crucial and competitive sector like agriculture. you can always rely on public handouts, sometimes you need to earn your keep. the problem with Indian agricultural market is that it doesn't reflect market conditions, farmers need to become more dynamic adapting to the needs and wants of the international markets within the constraints of existing technology in order to bring Indian farming to the 21st century, if this means current farmers are usurped by corporations so be it. temporary rise in unemployment so be it. the rest of india has had to adapt do farmers expect that they can continue to be employed in their hometowns?"<br />Author: 'saitosoul'<br />id: 'kp0nzo'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion (Vichaar-Vimersh)üó®Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è</li>

<li>Title: 'What do you guys think of brahminism? Do you guys agree that Brahmins might be the modern day Dalits?'<br />Body: "I have seen at many places and even at chodi that many times brahminism is labelled as bad, evil and promoting oppression against lower castes. But how are all those accusations verified? Where and what part of brahminism verifies the allegations on it? As a result of this still many intellectuals and activists generalise and call all brahmins evil. Isn't brahminism important for sanatan dharm to exist as it protects and preserves the hindu culture, traditions, rituals and the spirit of hindu rashtra? Would it be possible for sanatan dharm to have survived for so many centuries without brahminism protecting and preserving its spirit? Whenever our lands were invaded, did brahmins give up their culture and rituals? Did brahmins betray all of us hindus when our invaders looted us? Did brahmins never fight for independence or protect fellow hindus and our culture? Many brahmins are denied opportunities because of something they never did in their life but because they were born into a brahmin family. Isn't this caste based discrimination? Shouldn't the constitution and government then provide opportunities to empower brahmins? Today around 64% brahmins live below poverty line and work in all occupations that were once thought of and designated as something a person from lower caste would do. The temples are still under the control of government hence leading many pandits to live in poverty. In this country the anti brahmin forces are much stronger than many of us might think. Government has stopped releasing caste based census since 2011 but it was estimated that brahmin population is now severely declined and its barely even 2.5% hence making them a minority. Does this all lead to the conclusion that brahmins might be today's dalits living in the only country they could live in without any support and opportunities? If so then isn't it possible that in the future brahmins may get wiped out of existence? Is this also the reason why many brahmins dream of settling on foreign lands with the hope that they may get a future with equal opportunities as anyone else? If so then how can we expect brahmins to be patriotic and fight for a country that denies them opportunities and oppress them? And at last what wrong has brahminism done to any hindu that its labelled as evil and bad. My intentions of discussing about these is to not instigate any division within us hindus or discriminate against anyone else but to bring these genuine worries and issues into light. I am sorry if this post violates any rules of this sub but chodi is the only place where we can all unite hindus and talk about some genuine issues and concerns which can be resolved in the future."<br />Author: 'petermishra420'<br />id: 'koz205'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion (Vichaar-Vimersh)üó®Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è</li>
