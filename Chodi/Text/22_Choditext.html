Even other members like mamta , tamilans etc will agree for him being the pm candidate as he has developed the relations from long time with them.\n\nI wonder what BJP and mota bhai will bring to the table. Somewhere around mota bhai has got overrated , hes a man of action definetely but recently in strategy making hes missing out unfortunaltely. Though BJP has a big election machinery with them public sentiments are very against them currently.\n\nI think BJP is changing its gears and being result oriented (atleast as of now)  rather than defence oriented to opposition ( recent vaccine policy and the vaccine drive throttling ). They really need to put up big things on table with crystal clarity (not like CAA where things were lost in smoke and opp took the chance of false information spread). \n\nLast not least, after asking a lot of contacts and known peoples ( a small survey 😉 ). At core People do believe that modi is best for a secure nation but  are angry,dissapointed and looking for options for "if not him" , which they dont see anyone anywhere close yet coz of their daily lives has been impacted greatly...

By thy speech I infer thee to be highly intelligent.\n\nYudhishthira said, \n\n&gt;\'O foremost of serpents, he, it is asserted by the wise, in whom are seen truth, charity, forgiveness, good conduct, benevolence, observance of the rites of his order and mercy is a Brahmana. And, O serpent, that which should be known is even the supreme Brahma, in which is neither happiness nor misery--and attaining which beings are not affected with misery; what is thy opinion?\'"\n\nThe serpent said, \n\n&gt;\'O Yudhishthira, truth, charity, forgiveness, benevolence, benignity, kindness and the Veda which worketh the benefit of the four orders, which is the authority in matters of religion and which is true, are seen even in the Sudra. As regards the object to be known and which thou allegest is without both happiness and misery, I do not see any such that is devoid of these.\'\n\nYudhishthira said, \n\n&gt;Those characteristics that are present in a Sudra, do not exist in a Brahmana; nor do those that are in a Brahmana exist in a Sudra. And a Sudra is not a Sudra by birth alone--nor a Brahmana is Brahmana by birth alone. He, it is said by the wise, in whom are seen those virtues is a Brahmana. And people term him a Sudra in whom those qualities do not exist, even though he be a Brahmana by birth. And again, as for thy assertion that the object to be known (as asserted by me) doth not exist, because nothing exists that is devoid of both (happiness and misery), such indeed is the opinion, O serpent, that nothing exists that is without (them) both. But as in cold, heat doth not exist, nor in heat, cold, so there cannot exist an object in which both (happiness and misery) cannot exist?\n\nThe serpent said, \n\n&gt;\'O king, if thou recognise him as a Brahmana by characteristics, then, O long-lived one, the distinction of caste becometh futile as long as conduct doth not come into play.\'"\n\nYudhishthira said, \n\n&gt;\'In human society, O mighty and highly intelligent serpent, it is difficult to ascertain one\'s caste, because of promiscuous intercourse among the four orders. This is my opinion.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Men belonging to all orders (promiscuously) beget offspring upon women of all the orders. And of men, speech, sexual intercourse, birth and death are common. And to this the Rishis have borne testimony by using as the beginning of a sacrifice such expressions as--of what caste so ever we may be, we celebrate the sacrifice.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Therefore, those that are wise have asserted that character is the chief essential requisite. The natal ceremony of a person is performed before division of the umbilical cord. His mother then acts as its Savitri and his father officiates as priest. He is considered as a Sudra as long as he is not initiated in the Vedas.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Doubts having arisen on this point, O prince; of serpents, Swayambhuba Manu has declared, that the mixed castes are to be regarded as better than the (other) classes, if having gone through the ceremonies of purification, the latter do not conform to the rules of good conduct, O excellent snake! Whosoever now conforms to the rules of pure and virtuous conduct, him have I, ere now, designated as a Brahmana."\n\nTo this Nahusha is impressed and replies,\n\n&gt;"The serpent replied, \'O Yudhishthira, thou art acquainted with all that is fit to be known"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now that you\'ve all read that, can we stop with this pointless, archaic concept already? It was already obsolete during Yudhishtira\'s time. It\'s been thousands of years since then. \n\nDoes anybody have any clue or way we can oppose this birth-based system of determining varna? Or is it too late already? Are we doomed to follow this obsolete tradition?'<br />Author: 'Darkstorm999'<br />id: 'o5kex8'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm 🕉️</li><li>Title: 'Are leftists stupider now?'<br />Body: 'I\'ve noticed when having discussions with indians who are in atheisminindia Or ex hindu subs that they\'re MINDNUMBINGLY stupid.

If we could rectify it, that'd be great. \n\nMy main issue comes from the whole high octave, almost falsetto-esque rendition that's played in formal events.\n\nSay anything about the Soviets, they knew how to rouse an audience with an anthem. I was recently hearing the rendition of our national anthem during the WTC final. The new zealand anthem seemed to have been sung by a professional singer. Ours on the other hand was three children singing in the same higher octave. \n\nI feel it should be updated to depict genuine pride in being indian, adopt a melody that's more rounded indian instrumental rendition, and less the jhunjhuna we've begun to associate it with. \n\nIdk, I just feel a more rousing and proud anthem would help spread the nationalist fervor better than asking for a shubh ashish in the middle of it all, in a high voice within 52 seconds. Let it echo in the hearts of everyone for a good 100 seconds atleast.

We're approaching a fucking time bomb. Which is being made bigger by opposition and the ruling govt."<br />Body: "Let's be honest we're still overly depended on China. Add to that our country is still an argarian society and when Modi tried to corporatatize the farming sector you see what happened.\n\nRecently the shipping prices have literally Mooned. It used to cost $2300 to book a standard TEU container. Now it cost $10000-$12000 dollar that is an insane price jump. All of this adds to the pricing of goods and companies usually like to pass these on to customers. In India it's worst because not only do we not have subsidies for industries. There is crazy taxing schemes for everything. Now comes the part where the ruling party and even the opposition do stupid shit which just ends up destroying everything. Ruling party in a bid to stay in power artificially tries to lower prices of goods by reducing taxes or letting go of taxes. But this just doesn't solve it so what do they do start giving out freebies. From loans to homes to what not. Opposition in its bid also tries to make the already fucked up situation more worst by staging protest and dharna telling people how inflation is sky rocketing and the govt doesn't care. When the problem is not even govt. Control.\n\n\nNow comes the more scary aspect especially in Indian context. With Raw materials prices going up, inefficient labour and sky high labour cost most MSME can't survive. Example I can relate to is my uncle. He runs a small factory that mfg. Injections for vaccines and plastic container. The cost of raw materials is high, labour cost for him per day is 500 rupee per person + food. Additionally the labour workers are inefficient as they keep taking frequent breaks leading to low output. Which just puts more burden on the overall operating cost. So, my uncle has to charge more money to even make 1-2% profit. This just makes him uncompetitive in front of chinese goodz which have a high output and low cost of goods. Multiply this with all industry and we have a fucking problem.\n\nThe problem gets more messed up as labourers don't even care because they get free ration, free accommodation and they just threaten to vote for opposite party if they are not given what they want. Which is free money without any work.  In my uncle's case the labourers just blow the money on booze and sometimes don't even show up to work. But with shortage of labour workers it extremely hard to.remain in business. \n\n\nSo, we're heading for a massive economic chutiyapa if something is not done ASAP. Both opposition and ruling govt need to make rules clear. Efficiency, productivity is the only way forward for prosperity or else we're fucked."<br />Author: 'Legionoo7'<br />id: 'o483pu'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Covid Updates from past week'<br />Body: "COVID-19 India: More than 29.10 cr vaccine doses provided to States/UTs\n\nBangladesh reports highest single day COVID 19 death toll since May 2\n\nDPIIT Secretary Dr. Guruprasad Mohapatra , who monitored oxygen supply during Covid crisis passes away; PM Modi, ministers express grief\n\nSENSIT Rapid COVID-19 Ag Kit help quick testing procedure\n\nPM Modi launches 'Customized Crash Course programme for Covid 19 Frontline workers'\n\nBangladesh records highest COVID-19 death toll since May 3\n\nKhadi Village Industries Commission (KVIC) Records Highest Ever Turnover in FY 2020-21 Despite Covid-19 Pandemic\n\n#IndiaFightsCorona: 1,03,570 discharges in the last 24 hours\n\nPM Modi to launch ‘Customized Crash Course' for COVID-19 frontline workers\n\nPM CARES: Two 250-bedded makeshift COVID hospitals to be set up in West Bengal\n\n\n\nAll news courtesy http://ddnews.gov.in/ \n\nTrack latest covid data for India here: https://www.covid19india.org/"<br />Author: 'chodibot'<br />id: 'o468v3'<br />Flair :National 📰</li><li>Title: 'Regardless of what you think about his policies, I think one can admire Narendra Modi for the personality he is.'<br />Body: "I have always admired the work ethic the man has.

A sequence of that movie really shook me.\n\nThe story is set in 1878. The premise of the movie is that there is a young girl called Anandi Gopal who is married to a man called Gopalrao at the age of 14 years. Gopalrao is an educated person and he wants his wife to be a doctor at any cost. Anandi is a very talented girl she reads a lots of books and without any formal primary eduation, she is far more wise than any other girl in her village. Her husband manages to get her admitted in a missionary school run by the britishers. She is not treated very well in that college, the British girls there teas her for her appearance and skin colour but she still manages to make an identity of her in the school due to her knowledge. Further the villagers and the panchayat boycott Gopalrao and his wife saying that the hindu religion does not allow the women to be educated and that Gopalrao is committing a shameful sin by making his wife to go to a christian college. Gopalrao initially ignores people boycotting her but later when the tensions intensify, he decides to send his wife to America for her further studies. A consultant of him advices that in order ro go to America he needs to change his religion and Accept christianity. Gopalrao, a brahmin agrees to accept christianity and takes his wife to a church.\n\nThis was the moment I thought that the movie is yet another liberal product that tells people that Hindu religion must be given up to be a successful person in life but here comes the twist, when the father tells Anandi to remove her mangalsutra, she refuses and run away from the Church saying that the only thing that  has made her capable of being what she is today is her religion, she\'d never give up her religion at any cost. She says, "Jis desh ko mera dharm manya nahi, voh desh mujhe manya nahi." However later Anandi Gopal goes to America and ends up being a doctor without changing a religion.\n\nI mentioned this movie especially because what bollywood is showing is today in the name of feminism is "Veere di Wedding" and "Four more shots please" movies that say that only way a women can express the feminism inside her is by drinking beer and swearing men. In this era, Anandi Gopal is a masterpiece movie that promotes the true sense of Feminism without disrespecting our culture and religion.\n\nHighly recommended...'<br />Author: '_its_krits_'<br />id: 'o3v036'<br />Flair :DawoodWood (Entertainment) 🎥</li><li>Title: "Root Cause of India NOT becoming a Super Power is that the 'Cost of Crime' is Low or Non Existent and the sheer brain washing in university via social sciences chutiyapa.
