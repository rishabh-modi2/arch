<li>Title: 'Hindu apologetic!'<br />Body: 'Hello guys! I\'m not a super practicing hindu, i go to holy sites rarely, and hardly i\'ve read religious scriptures.\nBut i wanted to let out my personal opinion on certain topics non-hindus use to brainwash hindu youngsters in order to brain waah them into self hatered.\n1. "If mohommad was a pedophile(he was 6 when he married aisha and did s€x with her when she was 9, his age was 54), then so was Lord राम as he married godess sita when she was 7".\nSo, yes, godess was underage at the time of marriage, but so was lord राम! He was 12 or something, after 14 years of vanvaas, lord lav and kush were born. So according to current era, things were legal. \nYou know even today in India, many families do certain marrige ceremony which is considered to be partial marriage/marriage, after marriage the bride gets to remain with her actual parents, and is sent to her inlaws only when she\'s an adult. \n2. " hinduism has awkward polygamy ". (anyways, the most perfect prophet had 11 wives with whom he\'d have sex on a single night but bath only once, +he had numerous underage sex slaves as well). \nSo., afaik we do not worship pandavas, they ended up in hell, it was taboo back then too, and they were bound by the promise to their mother. Apart from that, they ended up in नर्क except for युधिष्ठिर. \n3. Godess सीता had to give the "purity" test. \nI have herd various things on this matter, but, as an apologetic i\'d say, who sits in the throne, MATTERS, the prince MUST be blood heir to the king. Nature\'s rule. So pressure by the citizens of अयोध्या to lord राम for godess सीता was VALID imo. \n I\'d say, lord राम took extreme decisions in his life, but they were perfect. You must know when you have to choose your family, and when you have to choose the प्रजा, and HE DID, wo we worship him. \nIn the future i\'ll post some Quran texts as well, because you have to know them, as the one pointing fingers at you, has to be clean himself, and peacefuls "aren\'t" clean. \nSpread awareness, धन्यावाद!'<br />Author: 'queueue_ueueue'<br />id: 'j1aez8'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li>

<li>Title: 'Tax'<br />Body: "Modern Economics.  Your money is weight by supply and demand.  \n\nThink of tax as a way to remove money from a country. You pay tax to make money keep its current value.  \nThink of it as this way. Tax is a way to remove money from the system to keep inflation in check. The more Hands money goes though, the less valuable it becomes. When the same amount of money gets used by more people it artificially increases its quantity.  \nThis is why Tax is imposed on every goods thus whenever money is transferred from one hand to other its quantity decreases to keep up with its increase in use.  \n  \nQuite a head cracker.  \nlet me explain in the most layman terms.  \nSuppose a pack of lays cost **Rs 10 when the total amount of money in India is Rs100 and population of India is 6**.  \n\n1. Case 1 if no tax is levied.  \nlet's say that Government prints Rs 100 this year so the net amount of money is Rs200.  \nAnd the transfer of money is.  \nA(200)-&gt;B(200)-&gt;C(200)-&gt;D(200)-&gt;E(200)-&gt;F(200).  \n**Total usefulness is Rs 1200 and thus the price of lays next year would be Rs120**.    \n\n  \n2. Case 2 if a Rs 25 tax is imposed on every sale  \nA(200)-&gt;B(175)-&gt;C(150)-&gt;D(125)-&gt;E(100)-&gt;F(75).  \n**Total usefulness is Rs 825 and thus the price of lays next year would be Rs 82.5**.    \n\n  \n1. Case 3 if a Rs 25 tax is imposed and the population in India is increased 8.  \nA(200)-&gt;B(175)-&gt;C(150)-&gt;D(125)-&gt;E(100)-&gt;F(75)-&gt;G(50)-&gt;H(25).  \n**Total usefulness is Rs 900 and thus the price of lays next year would be Rs 90**.  \n\n\n1. Case 4 if a Rs 25 tax is imposed and people save Rs 25 in the bank, while the population of India is increased to 8.  \nA(200)-&gt;B(150)-&gt;C(100)-&gt;D(50)-&gt;E(0)-&gt;F(-50)-&gt;G(-100)-&gt;H(-150).   \n**Total Usefulness is Rs 200 and thus the price of Lays will remain Rs 10 next year** . Negative money is loans.    \n\n\n1.   Case 5 if a Rs 50 tax is imposed, while the population of India is increased to 8.  \nA(200)-&gt;B(150)-&gt;C(100)-&gt;D(50)-&gt;E(0)-&gt;F(-50)-&gt;G(-100)-&gt;H(-150).   \n**Total Usefulness is Rs 200 and thus the price of Lays will remain Rs 10 next year** . Negative money is loans. This is exactly why saving money gives you a discount on taxes.    \n\n\nHope you can get it now. Not having tax blooms inflation, having slight tax reduces it, Having a population increases cause inflation.  \nThus the government can either ask people to save money in a deposit or Increase tax to reduce money and keep the inflation in check.  \nI do not think I can simplify it more.  Government Does not use tax money to fund the budget. It prints as much money as needed and then has to find a way to remove it.  \nGovernment is printing money to take care of corona and stimulate the economy. They have to Increase tax and savings to get this money to remove before the inflation kicks in. \n\nYes, the government does not need your money to do works. It is the opposite, they give money so that you can work.  \n  \nWelcome to the 21st. \nI got a migraine."<br />Author: 'Rakesh1995'<br />id: 'j0v5zl'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li>

<li>Title: 'Put racists in their place.'<br />Body: 'Indians should not cower as they become victims of racism. Racism by white men who have neither the intellectual depth nor the spiritual awareness to contend with us, is extremely ironic. Furthermore, they look like clones of each other.\n\nWe are superior in every aspect, be it knowledge, technical expertise, traditions, culture, and even linguistic skills. This does not mean that we become the racists; it simply means that we don\'t have to be on the defensive. A white guy in my university tried to belittle Indians by callously stating that my english was "better than most Indians." I told him that my english was better than his, as I had learnt it from scratch. Moreover, most of us know at least three languages, while native English speakers confuse "should have" with "should of" to this day. \n\nSelf-loathing Indians liberals/ABCDs/commies can continue to hate themselves and propogate nonsense on the internet. That is beyond our control; however, that should not stop us from putting racist trash in its place. Be it racist Americans from backwater shitholes or Eurotrash, always be unapologetic in our defense.\n\nWe as a people are culturally and morally superior and we can be even better only if we focus inwards. The day this country looks toward inward perfection, we will leave everyone behind.\n\nधन्यवाद।'<br />Author: 'ShanayStark7'<br />id: 'izho84'<br />Flair :HQ Text Bakchodi</li>

Child labour basically.\n\nFirst mistake, I met Ram Kumar Ramamurthy, CEO of Gemini Communications Ltd. He was a LITERAL sanghi. Why? Because he had a pretty high position in this "RSS" thingy. He also donated money to establish a paatashaala (or gurukul) that forced innocent children to leave their education and to read age-old irrelevant texts like the Vedas. He forced me too to leave my non-vegetarian diet and now I am really sad because I can\'t convert back to the original. \n\nI met a HUGE group of bhakts, sanghis, Nazis, and islamophobic terrorists with sole purpose of uniting Indians. What a narrow-minded thought! What about Pakistanis? What about antarticans? And what about people from Jupiter? Can\'t they deserve to be unified? When will they realize that internationalism &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nationalism? Ok, coming to the actual point, let us see what they do in RSS. \n\nFirst - Prarthana. I don\'t think I have to say much, what can you say about the fact that an idiotic organization assumes everyone and everything to be theist and more importantly, "Hindu"? NOTHING.\n\nSecond - Games. First I thought their games will something like Running and catching where the runners would be labelled as Muslims and Catchers as Hindus, I was relieved THAT kind of cringe didn\'t happen. What happened was even more cringe - Mandala Kho-Kho. The same old stuff we did in school days, somehow they managed to make it even more boring! \n\nThird - rules and responsibilities. It would go like "Anand Ji, your thing for the week is to distribute CDs of Bharat Mata songs in the nearby streets. XYZ Ji, your job is to give some vegetarian food to the other streets". I slept off because I don\'t want to hear all NGO stuff. What matters to me is how beautifully they have managed to build a right-wing echo-chamber, shutting down all other thoughts that goes against their narrative and propaganda.\n\nAnd the saddest part of that? I came to know the name of the organization (RSS) only after coming to my house. I remember that day my liberal mom had a fight with my dad because he took me to RSS.

<li>Title: 'What are the 3 "controversial" Agri- reforms that were passed by the govt?'<br />Body: '**What are APMCs?** \n\nAfter Independence to overcome the vicious cycle of debt and exploitation of farmers at the hands of moneylenders/traders who controlled all the supply &amp; distribution of the agri produce, Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) were introduced by states.\n\n\nThese APMCs are managed by Market Committees (constituted by the state governments). \n\nA Market committee comprises of 15-20 members who were either elected/nominated by the govt (elections were very rare). \n\nPolitical parties like NCP dominate 80% of APMCs in Maharashtra. \n\n\nThe entire state is divided into market areas, and each area is under a market committee. \n\nOnce this is done, NO person or agency is allowed to freely carry out the wholesale marketing activities in the agriculture produce.\n\n\n**Licensing:** Market committees authorise commission agents/ traders to carry out procurement &amp; distribution activities through Mandis. \n\n**Thus, even after the abolishment of License Raj in 1991, it is still prevalent in the agricultural sector.**\n\n\nNot only this, APMCs charge license fee from warehousing agents, loading agents commission agents, etc. \n\nFee is also charged from both the seller (farmer who comes to sell) and the buyer (wholesaler).\n\n\nSome hidden charges also include legal fee, Mandi Tax, etc. \n\nLet’s say a farmer sells his produce like - potatoes to the APMCs for ₹10/Kg, he will first pay plethora of taxes to the agents, who in turn are going to charge similar set of taxes even from the wholesaler.\n\n\nThus, in the end, a common man pays ₹60/kg for potatoes, whereas the farmer takes home only a meagre sum, based on say, ₹5 per kilo (after taxes). Only the middleman is at profit. \n\nThe middleman here refers to agents of APMCs, who collect all the commissions. \n\n\nAlso, when a farmer sells his produce to the APMC Mandis, there is NO immediate payment. Rather, he has to wait for a couple of days before the amount gets credited to his account. \n\nThis means - a lag in payment and liquidity.\n\nAPMCs play a dual role of “regulator” and a “controlled market”. \n\nMost of the states even impose restrictions on the interstate selling and procurement of agricultural produce. Hence, barring market integration.\n\n\n**What are the "controversial" bills introduced to tackle this?**\n\nThe three bills introduced that are all set to bring a sea change in this sector are - \n\n1) **The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020**- The act ends the monopoly of APMCs to exclusively procure from the farmers.\n\n\nIt however has NOT ENDED THE FARMER’s choice to keep selling to APMCs if he gets good return. \n\nFarmers will now have a CHOICE to sell in the open market or keep selling to APMCs. \n\nThis act provides a level playing field to all sellers, hence paving way for a free market.\n\n2) **The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020**-\n\nTo ensure a fair treatment to farmers outside APMCs, this bill provides for price assurance &amp; trade agreement during sale/ purchase of farm produce through a written agreement.\n\n\n\n3) **The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020**-\n\nTo ensure free market mechanism, this act will remove cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onions, and potatoes from the list of essential commodities to prevent regulation in production, distribution &amp; movement.\n\n\nHowever, the government is still authorised to regulate the supply &amp; distribution of these commodities during emergencies.\n\nAPMCs in major states have only served few political goons for decades. Introduction of free market in agriculture is definitely going to produce some friction, but it is beneficial in the long run.'<br />Author: 'Set1Less'<br />id: 'iwdaof'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: "I (18 M) am fearing for my parent's lives. Please tell me what to do next."<br />Body: " \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpelling will be horrible, not a native speaker, so please excuse that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo months ago my grandmother, who had been mentally unstable for a few months, died in our home. My mother is a general physician and as she had died in our arms, she saw clear signs of kidney failure that caused septisemia. Grandma had already been diagnosed and treated for a kidney infection 2 years prior. However due to personal reasons, we didn't get her tested for covid post-mortem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past few weeks, my mom and dad have been very sick. Mother's pulse has been rising suddenly for a few days now, reaching the 100-150 range. Dad has been suffering from diarrohea, and some sort of gastroentitis problem. Me and my dad have a slightly strained relationship so I'm not very sure of his problems. Whatever I know is what I could muster from my mother. I have heard them discussing about the gall bladder, a bladder stone and removing the gall bladder.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday my mom confided in me that she has been having pain in her lower back, near her kidneys, just like my grandmother did before she passed away. She had a urine culture test done, which she says indicates a possible kidney infection and indirectly told me that whatever happened to grandma could happen to her too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom's pulse reached 150 a few days ago and dad rushed her to the hospital, but it had already reduced to a normal level by the time they left home. However, her pulse still rises to 100 nearly every day since. She says she's not feeling alright, but is not able to put it in words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey have done a few tests,but I'm of the view that they haven't done enough. I am not able to bring myself to ask them about the results, as I'll explain why. They visited the hospital twice and always came back with a much better mood, but their problems once again start the next morning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realize I'm not very clear with explaining their ailments, but this is all I know at the moment. It is not easy to discuss this at home without one of us breaking down. Dad already has been on the verge of tears many times when he thought me and my younger brother weren't looking. I'm fearing for their life and literally have no idea what to do. With all that's happened this year, my anxiety is through the roof and I'm extremely tensed. If any, any of you out there who has experienced or known someone who experienced these health problems, please advice and suggest me what to do now. I am clueless and in constant fear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my panic, I posted this in each and every sub that I thought would be helpful. Dad and Mom are trying to be as optimistic in front of me as possible, but even their facade is cracking. I have no idea why I'm reaching out to strangers who read this, but please, please, please- If you can be of any help, please do. It would mean the world right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;DR- My parents are both quite sick, but they aren't able to convey about it to me and neither I am able to ask about it to them. I only know the following key terms. Dad- gall bladder, bladder stone, diarrohea, endoscopy and gastroentitis. Mom- suddenlr rising pulse(reaching 150), lower back pain that is caused by(as a urine culture test indicates) kidney infection."<br />Author: 'marvel_fanboy_4ever'<br />id: 'iupogt'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: 'Dr Li-Meng, a Chinese researcher and whistleblower has published a paper explaining how SARS-CoV-2 was designed in a lab. Here is an ELI5 ⬇️'<br />Body: 'Link to Dr Li-Meng et al\'s research paper: https://zenodo.org/record/4028830#.X1_G1mhKg2z\n\n\n**Summary**: She alleges that there is no way a wild bat coronavirus could evolve or mutate into the human-infecting strain that appeared in late 2019 naturally. The paper brings up a number of possible scenarios that were proposed (direct mutation, intermediary infection, etc.) and shows how they are not feasible, at least in a manner that produced what we see today. Covid-19 appeared out of the gate perfectly formed to infect human cells, and there\'s no way to explain that other than genetic engineering.\n\n\n**The genomes for COVID-19 and the coronaviruses ZC45 and ZCX21 are very similar.**\n\n1. COVID-19 (technically named, SARS-CoV-2) is a coronavirus. If you look at the NCBI database that shows the gene sequences of other coronavirus, it closely matches two related coronaviruses known as ZC45 and ZXC21. (Those particular viruses also happened to be discovered by Chinese researches in 2015.)\n\n2. Other bat-type coronaviruses are similar to COVID-19, but they come in at about 89% identical over the entire genome. ZC45/ZCX21, however, are in the range of 94%-100% identical to COVID-19, depending on the section you\'re looking at.\n\n**Like really, really, unusually similar...**\n\n3. There are two particularly interesting gene sequences to look at in COVID-19 and ZC45 (and ZXC21). They are the sections that code for the Orf8 protein and E protein...\n\n4. Orf8 exists in other coronaviruses, but the sequence will vary a lot between different types. If you look at all other coronaviruses, their Orf8 sequences match COVID-19 with a 58% correspondence. However, ZC45 matches COVID-19\'s Orf18 with a 94.2% correspondence. This is weird, because all the other data suggest that Orf8 is a sequence that just plays loosey-goosey between strains, but here we have an unnaturally close identicality. It\'s like catching two students cheating on a test because their written answers are so similarly worded.\n\n5. As for the E protein sequence, it mutates relatively quickly, meaning you\'ll find genomic differences even between close generations of the same virus. However, they\'ve found some COVID-19 E protein sequences that have a 100% match with ZC45./ZXC21. To put that in perspective, no other coronavirus has been observed with a 100% match to either COVID-19 or ZC45/ZXC21.\n\n**There\'s this other "natural" virus that supposedly matches COVID-19, but it seems like a fabrication to lead people away from ZC45/ZXC21**\n\n6. The virus is called RaTG13. It\'s supposed to be a 96% match to COVID-19. The reason why they think this is bullshit is because RaTG13 is supposed to be found in horseshoe bats but third party researchers found out that the sequence as described probably can\'t actually infect horseshoe bats.\n\n\n**Ok, so COVID-19 and ZC45/ZXC21 are nearly identical. What does that prove?**\n\n7. Given their nearly identical nature, two possibilities exist. COVID-19 naturally evolved from ZC45/ZXC21 or ZX45/ZXC21 was used as a template for COVID-19. But which possibility is it? It can\'t be evolution because...\n\n8. There\'s a protein in all coronaviruses known as Spike proteins. Spike proteins allow coronaviruses to "spear" the host cell and infect it.\n\n9. If you compare Spike proteins between COVID-19 and ZC45/ZXC21, they are very similar as expected...BUT they differ in one very significant way. There\'s one section that helps give COVID-19 the ability to infect humans instead of bats. This one section "coincidentally" looks a lot like the same section of the virus that caused the 2003\'s SARS epidemic.\n\n10. This one section could not have evolved naturally because if it did, you would expect to see other "evolutionary" changes around that section and throughout the whole protein. Instead what you\'re seeing is almost like a copy-and-paste. One part of the protein closely matches the ZC45/ZXC21 virus and the other part closely matches the SARS virus. It\'s like a bad photoshop where someone neglected to use the smudge and blur tool.\n\n11. There is another possibility this not-matching section just popped in through a natural gene swap (like trading Pokemon cards)...which does happen occasionally with viruses. But in order for that to happen, the two trading viruses need to infect the same host at the same time. This is impossible because SARS infects humans but ZC45/ZXC21 only infects bats. Pokemon cards thus cannot be swapped because the otakus aren\'t even in the same house.\n\n12. A final nail in this Spike protein coffin is that if you look at the beginning and end of the not-matching sequence, you find short sequences that happen to be "restrictions sites" that are commonly used in genetic engineering. (A restriction site is a genomic sequence that is easily cut through and pasted into using genetic engineering techniques.) While it\'s possible that these sites could just randomly be there, it\'s more than extremely unlikely and very suspicious.\n\n13. One last thing about the COVID-19 Spike protein is that there\'s a thing in it called a "furin-cleavage site". It\'s a little complicated, but basically, furin-cleavage sites don\'t exist in the particular line of coronaviruses that COVID-19 is associated with, and the ones that do exist are about 60% different from the furin-cleavage site in COVID-19\'s Spike protein. Basically, it\'s like COVID-19\'s furin-cleavage site came out of nowhere.\n\nTake home message: ZC45/ZXC21 appears to be the template that COVID-19 was based on. One particular sequence in COVID-19 appears to be copy-and-pasted from the 2003 SARS virus. It\'s nearly statistically impossible and equally illogical that COVID-19 could just randomly evolve a genome that happens to look like a patchwork copy of other viruses.\n\n\nPlease read the paper when you have time, it is very informative. They actually delineate a possible workflow through which you could derive COVID-19 from ZC45/ZXC21. At that point, it\'s like rubbing it in everyone\'s faces that this is exactly what happened and they\'re going to show how they did it.

In fact, one can even assume that the verdict was meant more as a headline-worthy \'media fodder\' than any real rebuttal coming from a position of jurisprudence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext, I don\'t think a lot of people understand how exponential growth works when it pertains to highly infectious diseases. One can draw analogies with how a single neutron leads to a massive chain reaction in nuclear fission reactions to possibly understand how even 300 "active spreaders" (people not following quarantine directives, hiding symptoms, moving freely &amp; interacting with a large number of people) can now be attributed to having been the source of a large chunk of current active cases. However, what remains incontrovertible in the fact that at one point in time, TJ was directly attributed to more than 1/3rd of COVID cases in ENTIRE SOUTH ASIA. It was arguably much higher in India. Authorities of several different countries have expressed their disapproval of how TJ has operated in light of the COVID outbreak.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/world/asia/coronavirus-malaysia-muslims-outbreak.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/world/asia/coronavirus-malaysia-muslims-outbreak.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I know that just like the negative GDP figure, all commie-jihadis are gonna keep beating on this dead horse of a "verdict" until everybody forgets what ACTUALLY happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNevermind what you hear on the news, most people now actually have been given to understand that despite strict quarantine instructions, TJ sent its preachers to all corners of India &amp; literally asked them to gather people at mosques for prayers. Search "belgaum mosque covid" on YT and you can actually hear the guys admitting that they came straight from markaaz. They aren\'t locals &amp; they don\'t speak a word of Kannada. This has been one of the most self-evident &amp; shocking revelations for me. It\'s pretty much common knowledge in these parts now &amp; no amount of intellectual "whitewashing" is going to change that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\'m guessing BJP is going to let this one slide because it doesn\'t want to give even more reasons for stupid shitheads to screech "iSlaMOpHoBiA!!!!". Moreover, it\'s evident from their policies, that no matter what other parties say, they actually care about muslims in India and are unwilling to stir up a hornet\'s nest when they clearly aren\'t interested in vote bank politics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurther points to ponder/read up on:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- A person in ahmedabad(?) who made a presentation mathematically explaining how TJ is a major vector for COVID spread in India &amp; was arrested.\n\n\\- TJ\'s Wikipedia page which extensively documents their involvement in terrorist activities across the globe &amp; also has info on COVID related events. Imagine an organization so wrought in controversy that even Wikipedia can\'t scrub it clean from their pages.\n\n\\- The fact that foreign TJs were on illegal visas. They were supposed to be on missionary visas while actually being on tourist visas. This was one of the major reasons why they were detained.\n\n\\- TJs willfully staying in high population density areas like Dharavi\n\n\\- Chief Mulana spreading hateful rhetoric about how COVID is "allah ki NRC" &amp; further encouraging people to gather in mosques. The latter phenomenon was even observed in pakistan &amp; you\'ll find several posts regarding the same in relevant subreddits.\n\n\\- Well documented (on video) cases of bad behaviour by TJs while under quarantine/treatment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question to you guys is: Should an organization like Tablighi Jamaat, which has been deeply linked with terrorist activities across the globe &amp; whose stated goal (very explicit -- as indicated by their very name) is proselytization, be allowed to operate in India?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould love to hear you guys\' thoughts/inputs on this.'<br />Author: 'DanKoder1337'<br />id: 'irynkn'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: "You Can't Blame The People For POOR HINDI IMPLEMENTATION!"<br />Body: 'Please Note : I am from northern India, and many of the things I talk about in this article, are also partially and/or completely limited to the Hindi speaking/writing states. I want to make it clear that I don’t believe in forceful Hindi teaching, to places with regional languages that contain both vocal and written  forms. We have 22 languages for a reason.\n\nAlong with Hindi, I suppose that regional languages can also be included into the category of “poor implementation”, but I believe that Hindi is the one that has gotten the highest push back, obviously Sanskrit is much behind, and their is little to no implementation of it into studies, but I suppose that is a topic for another day.\n\nHindi, though it may be a language used everyday, has been really pushed down if you were to ask me. It became from a language, which was, absolutely fluent and dare I say beautifully spoken, to bringing it down to being limited to casual talks, and the least of government works. Many people also use this phrase along with the line, look at countries like Japan and China, where many people are proud of their language, and look at us who are stuck in indirect British Raj, in the form of education, jobs and just everything overall. And, they aren’t wrong, they are absolutely correct, but as I wrote two things in two separate articles of mine, which talk about implementation and root cause. Both of them are interconnected, and I will try my best simplify it, even though, I don’t have the best track record of keeping it all simple...\n\nThe root cause goes long back to the time of independence, even though India became its own country, the new people in power, weren’t eager in changing the nature of education nor government from completely English based to partial/complete move to Hindi, and I do get the point, the politicians obviously didn’t want to bring in such a drastic change into the newly, not so stable independent India, but all actions have consequences, and the consequences that came afterwards were grave and unexpected, to say the least. The reason to become a Hindi Graduate, or even taking interest in Hindi overall, became more of a force till class 8, than be it a norm, in a country, which’s northern part, mostly speaks in Hindi. Now that is the root cause, with a tad bit of introduction regarding the implementation, by implementation, I try to pressure upon the very importance of the step and, why it may have been a contributing factor, to degradation of the Hindi Language as a whole.\n\nThe implementation, is the step that I see many people talking about when they speak regarding the following subject, and they also use it to justify the degradation, as to how can it be so easy to change something which was a norm for 200 years(The norm is using English as a language in all subjects)\n\nI have a simple answer against it, look at this:\n\nWhen the British rule ended in India in the year 1947 the literacy rate was just **12%**. Over the years, India has changed socially, economically, and globally. After the 2011 census, literacy rate India 2011 was found to be **74.04%**.  \n\nI rest my case, and the “judges”(you, the reader) shall decide whether my statement is legitimate enough to be justify the incompetence of the government post-1947 specifically in this subject.'<br />Author: 'Generocide'<br />id: 'irwohx'<br />Flair ::swamivivek: High IQ</li>
<li>Title: 'The never ending Reservation'<br />Body: 'Reservation is bad.\n\nOk now what is the right way to make life less unfair of those who were discriminated and some are still being highly discriminated in society. And make a society where people feel more equal.\n\nThere are two types of Equality - 1. Equality of Opportunity   2. Equality of Outcome\n\nReservations are 2nd type of Equality - Equality of Outcome, what we need in our society is Equality of Opportunity. But equality of opportunity requires efforts and a good intention.\n\nFor understanding let me give you a analogy-\n\nIf we give some people Aata, Water and Ghee. We will get different results like Roti, Bati, Parantha, and bread. Some will just add sugar and can make Halwa and Laddu, some will make some other things.\n\nGiving everyone Aata, Water and Ghee is Equality of Opportunity.\n\nAnd if we say there are less production of Bati and Bread, and there are large production of Roti and Parantha .So we control the result and say that this much Roti and Paranthas should be produced.\n\nThis is Equality of Outcome.\n\n(Now wait before bashing me in replies and read the whole thing)\n\nNow come to the caste system. Caste system is not a process which is we evolve into as a society. It\'s not like everyone is making what they like to eat and that\'s why the production of Bati and Bread is less and Roti and Parantha is high, But some people are forced to choose and allowed only to eat Bati and Bread. And if they try to eat Parantha they were killed and beaten up.\n\nWhat reservation does is gives marginalised community a fixed number of seats which is the lower limit and seats can be higher than that and no one can steal those seats from them. That\'s it.\n\nWhat reservation don\'t do is - End discrimination and attrocities, Intercaste marriage, Financial empowerment of whole community, and other caste related issues. Then what is the thing which do all these things which Reservation can\'t do? Those things are - SC/ST attrocities (prevention) Act, Social campaigns and Awareness, Welfare Schemes.\n\nBut we have all these things and still there are discrimination in society, then what\'s missing? - What is the thing that is missing is "Equality of Opportunity". We have all these things but there\'s no intention to remove caste based discrimination. What we have is polarisation and appeasement, there\'s equality only on paper.\n\nWhat we have -\n\nReservation, Free schools, Very less or non at all fees in forms, colleges and hostels, loan schemes for business, Prevention of Attrocities Act\n\nWhat we don\'t have -\n\nBetter facilities ( some don\'t have basic facilities) in those Schools and Colleges, No environment for even thinking of doing somethings else what currently doing, worst law and order system and many many other very important things which is required to have a Equality of Opportunity.\n\n(Most of the marginalised community people loose at School level itself, only "financially sound and very few dedicated" people from these community enjoy the benefits of reservation. And for most of them there is atleast one more generation which is at same place)\n\nSo, in the end I only wanted to say is that if there\'s no or enough Equality of Opportunity no matter how much years and with any percentage of reservation , discrimination will not end.\n\nSo if you want to end this "unfair and anti-merit" reservation, first demand Equality of Opportunity, without these nothing will change. Don\'t vote for who will give your community how much reservation or who will end reservation, vote who will create environment for Equality of Opportunity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit - Also read this I find these interesting -  [In countries with higher gender equality, women are less likely to get STEM degrees](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/02/does-gender-equality-result-in-fewer-female-stem-grads)\n\n[The More Gender Equality, the Fewer Women in STEM](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/the-more-gender-equality-the-fewer-women-in-stem/553592/)\n\nAnd in India -  [India tops the world in India tops the world in producing female graduates in STEM but ranks 19th in employing them](https://www.businessinsider.in/careers/news/india-tops-the-world-in-producing-female-graduates-in-stem-but-ranks-19th-in-employing-them/articleshow/74117413.cms?utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=Click_through_social_share)\n\nWomen in India are at the bottom in hierarchy in every caste/religion/tribe. And things are not simple as that we think and will take push from every sides including the marginalised to make things more equal.'<br />Author: 'newaccountforgmail'<br />id: 'irwlao'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li>

<li>Title: 'Ancient Bharat #1 : The Sarasawati Civilization'<br />Body: "Thought I'd share something about our history. Lemme know if you'd like me to share more and give feedback \n\nSource: Michel Danino's On the Trail of Sarasawati\n\nResearchers have officially accepted the existence of the mythical Saraswati river mentioned in the rigved. The current channel of Ghaggar-Hakra basin in Rajasthan is the remnants of the ancient river. This basin and the whole channel was discovered by the British Archaeologists back in the early years 1900s. This only positive outcome from the British era I believe. \n\nAlso, later it was found that in total 3781 Harrapan sites have been found across Pakistan and India. Out of this 2378 found on the Sarasawati basin and only 835 found in the Indus river basin. The other 568 sites have been found in the Gangetic plains. This clearly shows the vastness of our civilization and the scale at which governance and logistics occured in a time which is atleast 4000 years old. The oldest site is supposedly Rakhigarhi which dates back to 8000 BCE. \n\nOne of the sites found is under the walls and premises of Delhi's Purnana Qila (Old Fort) but not many are aware about obviously because of the propagandist education system. Harrappan style wells have been found there and there was a proposal to create a shed there for people to visit but nothing has been done yet. \n\nAlso some of the artifact's found from all of these sites are pottery, jewelry (made of shells similar to what Rajasthani women wear as bangles even today), dice, shivlings, fire alters in the shape of yoni of the shiv ling, hunting spears etc. \n\nLater research in the 20th century showed satellite images of the course of the river and revealed that Sarasvati's width would have been 22 kms ( Amazon river width is 24 kms) so it was a huge river, no wonder it was known as the birthplace of Vedic knowledge since the river is mentioned 22 times in the rigveda and Ganga is mentioned only 3 times. \n\nThe concept of globalisation is also not new since Indus Sarasawati Civilization used to trade with Iran and central asian civilization. \n\nThe writing and script of the civilization has not been decoded yet but work is ongoing. \n\nThe 2 major mysteries of the Civilization\n 1. In all the excavations and research, historians and anthropologists have not been able to find any mention of a King or one ruler or who governed the region. \n\n2. NO proof of warfare, conflict and weaponry has been found in any of the sites creating a big mystery as to how a primitive civilization survived without any conflict from outside intervention or internal rebellion. The case rests kn the fact that was no rebellion or any outside intervention. The societal structure was such that conflict was not existent. \n\n\nRecent discoveries of chariots and swords in Sanauli, U.P give a new turn in the art of warfare in the region. (Remnants of Mahabharata?) Research is ongoing. \n\nI am an avid reader of history, non fiction and Archaeology. Let me know if you guys want me to share more stuff like this. I have a lot to share. :) And yes I'll share the source too. \n\nजय श्री राम।   🏹"<br />Author: 'siddhantprakashsingh'<br />id: 'irhnfk'<br />Flair :इतिहास :H:</li>

<li>Title: 'मिथ्या'<br />Body: '\nअजीब सी फिल्मों में से एक फिल्म थी “मिथ्या” जिसे रजत कपूर ने 2008 में बनाया था। इसमें एक फिल्म में एक्स्ट्रा का काम करने वाले की शक्ल बिलकुल स्थानीय डॉन राजे भाई से मिलती थी। राजे भाई के दुश्मन राजे को मारकर उसकी जगह इस एक्स्ट्रा को बिठा देना चाहते थे। उनका ही गुर्गा दुश्मन की सल्तनत का मुखिया हो तो पूरे इलाके पर कब्ज़ा करने में उन्हें आसानी होती।\nपूरी कहानी में झोल ये होता है कि वो एक्स्ट्रा को राजे की जगह डाल तो देते हैं मगर एक दुर्घटना में उसके सर पर चोट लग जाती है। उसकी याददाश्त जाती रहती है और जैसे जैसे वो एक्स्ट्रा ठीक होता है, वो अपने आप को सचमुच का राजे भाई और उसके परिवार को अपना परिवार मानने लगता है। यही कहानी का ट्विस्ट है कि अब विरोधी गुट क्या करेगा? क्या वो अपनी ही हरकत की पोल खोले? या नकली राजे भाई को झेले?\nफिल्म में कई अच्छे कलाकार हैं जैसे रणवीर शौरी राजे भाई के किरदार में है, उसके अलावा विनय पाठक, सौरभ शुक्ला, हर्ष छाया, नेहा धूपिया और नसीरुद्दीन शाह भी हैं। दिमाग के अगले हिस्से में इंसान की अपनी एक छवि होती है, वही उसकी पहचान होती है। वो बदल जाये तो आदमी बदलेगा या नहीं, ऐसे दार्शनिक सवाल पर फिल्म बनी है। कलाकारों ने अच्छा काम किया या बुरा उसपर भी अलग चर्चा की जा सकती है।\nलेकिन हमारा ध्यान फ़िलहाल फिल्म के सिर्फ एक दृश्य पर है। इस दृश्य में विरोधी गुट यानी सौरभ शुक्ला और विनय पाठक वगैरह मिलकर एक्स्ट्रा रणवीर शौरी को राजे भाई की तरह बर्ताव करना सिखा रहे होते हैं। उन्हें पता था कि ये एक्स्ट्रा मामूली आदमी है और वो बड़े गुंडे इसलिए बीच बीच में वो उसके साथ बदतमीजी भी कर बैठते थे। नेहा धूपिया के सामने पीटना या बेइज्जत होना रणवीर को पसंद नहीं आ रहा होता।\nअचानक वो पिस्तौल उठा लेता है और बिलकुल राजे भाई वाले किरदार में आ जाता है। एक गुर्गे की कनपटी पर पिस्तौल टीकाकार वो बिलकुल राजे भाई के से अंदाज में उसे धमकाता है। आखिर वो राजे भाई वाले अंदाज में कहता है, “बोल! बोल कि मेरा नाम झंडूलाल है और मेरी अकल मेरे पिछवाड़े में घुस गयी है!” मरता क्या ना करता? गुंडा दोहराता है, “मेरा नाम झंडूलाल है और मेरी अकल मेरे पिछवाड़े में घुस गयी है!”\nकुछ साल पहले की बात है जब 19 नवम्बर 2012 को बाल ठाकरे की शवयात्रा निकली और पूरी मुंबई बंद रही तो दो लड़कियों ने सोशल मीडिया पर कुछ लिख दिया। बिलकुल निरीह, बिना कोई नॉटी जैसा शब्द इस्तेमाल किये बिना, बस शहर बंद क्यों, इतना ही पूछा था। इतने पर लड़कियों को मुंबई की तेज-तर्रार पुलिस ने गिरफ्तार कर लिया था। कड़ी पूछताछ और कानूनी करवाई के बाद, माफ़ी-वाफी मांगकर लड़कियां जैसे-तैसे छूटी थीं। इस मामले में किसी को नारीवाद नहीं सूझा था। कोई सूरमा “रोजेज आर रेड, वायलेट्स आर ब्लू...” करता हुआ नहीं निकला था।\nबाकी मसला बड़ा मजेदार है क्योंकि\n# बाबरसेना का नाम आते ही तमाम शेखुलर, बुद्धिपिशाच, लिबटार्ड और नारीवादी अपना नाम झंडूलाल बताने लगते हैं और उनका नारीवाद उनके पिछवाड़े में घुस जाता है! ऐसा ही है न?'<br />Author: 'jhaansi_rani'<br />id: 'iqlbrt'<br />Flair ::snoo_trollface:Bait molana Bait</li>

But being of Sri Lankan origin, she didn\'t have any problem portraying an Indian character in her last show. When Indian origin Naomi Scott was cast as Jasmine in Aladdin many protested saying she is not Arab. Same thing happened when Anya Chalotra was cast as Yennefer in Witcher and Dev Patel in The Personal History of David Copperfield.\n\nBut we didn\'t see any outrage when Rami Malek an Arab played Indian Parsi Freddie Mercury or Kumail Nanjiani of Pakistani origin playing Bollywood actor in Marvel\'s The Eternals. \n\n**Why the selective outrage only against Indian people?**'<br />Author: 'uncool_girl'<br />id: 'iqk7q4'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

They live with their parents. \n\nSince we live in my same city , I frequently visit their house as they live just few kilometers from me. \n\nSo, both these brother-sister are very friendly with each other . They are like best friends . Though not always , sometimes they even sleep on the same bed. Sometimes they lay on the same bed and talk with each another. Though they don't cuddle.  I knew about them doing this but I didn't find anything wrong in it. \n\nBoth of them have boyfriend and girlfriend. And they share every details of their personal life with one another. \n\nBut few days ago when I visited their house . The brother was sleeping on the back and was  just in sleeveless vest (banyan) and a boxer . And the sister climbed on up on his body and sat on it.  The sister was wearing tshirt and pyjama. And sister climbed up on his body and sat on his . The brother was having back-ache. And perhaps he requested her to do so.\n\nBoth brother and sister are 20 years old. \n\nThe brother is very good friend of mine . The sister is also friendly with me. . And I am 100 percent sure there is no incest. Also they did this infront of me and both their parents . And their father is very conservative.( Their father don't know about them having bf and gf and is strictly against such things)\n\nIs it normal behavior ?"<br />Author: 'rock492'<br />id: 'iq2f6y'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li>

Every piece of Sh*t guy wants a chunk of your money.\nBuilding website?  20-50k for a sh*t website but shopify does it for way less and actually looks great but no one told me this back then.\n\nThen registering the business was hell back then.\nNot to mention the hell of going to through bank procedures. If experienced people could have guided me back then I wouldn't make so many stupid moves.\n\nSo I think we need a community to teach young bhratas of the ways of business."<br />Author: 'Stoicjaguar'<br />id: 'iq1h49'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>
