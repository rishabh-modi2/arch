<li>Title: "Bhaiyo, this is a petition on an important matter let's not drag it into 'communal oppression' agenda, if you can support it then it can be helpful"<br />Body: 'http://chng.it/tGTMBH5kWh\n\nWhile entire India is dealing with coronavirus crisis, mine is compounded by shrill noise coming from the loudspeakers of nearby masjids, 5 times a day. Though I am not against any religion still the consequences of piercing noise compelled me to inquire from others residing in my locality at Bandra as to the effect that this noise is having on them. I learnt that children and old people are the most affected. Of course, their immunities are compromised with stress levels increasing and blood pressure rising. Others also were compelled to listen to things which they have no interest or reason to listen to. The practice of calling azaan originated hundreds of years ago when people did not have watches and clocks to guide them as to the time to pray. Nowadays everyone has not only watches &amp; clocks but smartphones with alarms. Therefore not only is making noise at such high volume against the law but it is not practically justified by any need or emergency or exception necessitating it. This forced me to widen the gamut of my research wherein I found that Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules 2000 has been promulgated and the use of loudspeakers and amplifiers without permission is banned. Even with permission, noise is required to be kept within permissible limits and breach thereof is an offence. I also learnt that Supreme Court and Bombay High Court have passed judgments directing police authorities to enforce the law. However, for reasons best known, the police authorities have done little and rarely took action against this illegal act. Through this petition, I seek support of everyone to urge the police machinery to take strictest action as per law so that peace and quiet that is our right as citizens can be restored in our lives.'<br />Author: 'braVishi'<br />id: 'hgt6un'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li>

<li>Title: "Internet censorship nai hona chahiye India mein and any orders of which promote censorship should be vehemently objected against by the Indian people, this isn't China aur hum humare desh ko China banne bhi nai denge."<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img hmqo1x4x0f751...*\n\nTLDR\n\nA whistleblower provided us with a cache of blocking orders for more than 4000 websites issued in India. We are making them available online as they form an essential resource for the public and researchers. As per our initial analysis a majority of website blocking being done due to copyright claims and court orders.\n\nPublic Disclosure: reducing secrecy and opacity\n\nWebsite blocking is a complex issue which seems to be growing in severity only with time. Ordinary Indians who access the internet --- which is a public resource -- still do not know the reason why a specific website is blocked. Sometimes, even the persons who run these websites do not have knowledge as to the reasons and the legal authority which has directed the blocking of websites.\n\nWe have earlier explained the legal position in respect of [**porn websites**](https://internetfreedom.in/whattheblock/), how sometimes [**blocking is inconsistently done at the ISP level**](https://internetfreedom.in/what-the-block-iff-has-heard-your-complaints-and-is-taking-action-savetheinternet/), and done a preliminary analysis of the [several orders we had received through RTIs](https://internetfreedom.in/a-tale-of-rogue-pirates-ashok-kumars-and-isps-caught-in-the-middle-rti-data-on-court-ordered-website-blocking-reveals-worrying-trends-whattheblock/). Our continuing attempts to increase transparency around this issue received a boost. A whistleblower has [**provided orders**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XtWN1FGTnalCIOiEdCLtIbuGM-d_3IYR?usp=sharing) sent by courts and government authorities to Internet Service Providers across India. These contain more than 64 documents and provide explanations for the blocking of about 4398 websites. Today we are publishing them for public knowledge and the wider research community.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8xt7sd8z0f751.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef94165a3195c54f6d582103a5026617443bb8f3\n\nPreliminary inferences\n\nWe have three preliminary inferences to share on these orders. While offering these inferences we would like to point out that this is a limited data set and is likely to display a bias given the total data field of all blocking orders is not publicly available. At the same time, we find value in providing an initial analysis that confirms several points on the reasons for blocking, or the more recent instance of how the [**WeTransfer block** ](https://internetfreedom.in/we-urge-the-dot-to-unblock-wetransfer-whattheblock/)was effected without proper transparency.\n\n* **Courts are primary actors:** The public authorities from which most of these orders arise are from courts situated in Delhi and Chennai. This is principally the High Court of Delhi and the High Court of Madras. The nature of the orders are interim injunctions on claims by content owners. Here quite often file sharing and movie streaming websites are being blocked. Here processes for specific takedowns on URLs is not the preferred route but entire websites are blocked. A casual read through the list of URLs confirms this.\n* **Website blocking is inconsistent:** Internet users all across India who use different ISPs have very different experiences on website blocking. This may be due to the technology used, the nature of blocking that is affected and varies from each ISPs compliance in each specific region where they may be offering services through a different technical infrastructure. This is specifically through Document No. 59 which is a non-compliance report in which correspondence was specifically directed to ISPs to block websites in terms of an earlier order.\n* **Lack of opposition and transparency:** Despite the large impression carried that a majority of blocking orders are affected by Government, as stated these primarily occur through infringement claims made by private parties. In most of these cases, the defendants are a few websites, ISPs and Government Departments. It is not clear whether any opposition is presented and whether a high level of scrutiny is visited prior to the directions for blocking being made. While many of such claims may be legitimate there do exist legitimate arguments on proportionality and how over-broad intellectual property enforcement results in deprivations of the public’s right to access materials online. This issue is further compounded by the insufficient notice to people as there does not exist any central, or government repository for housing and publishing their directions for blocking websites.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xvei86x01f751.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93cc4182e9e4ea14998798683f60633c2a3f8720\n\nThe Tanul Thakur Case\n\nWe have identified that it is a lack of proactive publication and transparency in India’s blocking process whether through courts or executive bodies which is causing a fracture of public trust in the exercise of this power. At present, there is a writ petition pending before the High Court of Delhi regarding the blocking of the satirical website, “[**Dowry Calculator**](https://internetfreedom.in/delhi-hc-issues-notice-to-the-government-for-blocking-satirical-dowry-calculator-website/)”.\n\nWe have been working with Tanul Thakur, the petitioner and the creator of this website since May 2019 with drafting and filing RTI applications and we also assisted with the writ petition. Our hope through this intervention is that it helps support greater transparency and the norms of proper notice to website creators, hearings in which they can put forward a defence followed by public disclosure of the decision. You can read more about this case here, from when the [**notice was first issued**](https://internetfreedom.in/delhi-hc-issues-notice-to-the-government-for-blocking-satirical-dowry-calculator-website/), to the [**stand taken by the government**](https://internetfreedom.in/meity-defends-blocking-of-satirical-dowry-calculator-website/).

<li>Title: 'Peddling half-truths is centuries old habit of Muslim historians'<br />Body: 'V. K. Rajwade was a veteran Marathi historian, who perhaps contributed most to shed light on Maratha history by compiling historic Marathi and Sanskrit documents and making commentaries. He wrote his commentaries in the preface, one such preface to a 17th-century manuscript called "Radha Madhav Vilas Champu", which is essentially a biography of Chhatrapati Shivaji\'s father Shahaji written by someone during his lifetime. \n\nThe following paragraph is a word to word translation of paragraph 48 of that preface.\n\n\\---\n\nMir Jumla was Abdullah Qutb Shah\'s vizier. He was famous for his wealth and diplomacy all over India. He attacked south Karnataka in 1652 CE. Karnataka was desired by both Adilshah and Qutbshah since it was adjacent to their realm and strategically important. Adilshah sent Shahaji from his side. Mij Jumla fought a bloody war with Shahaji after entering Karnataka, in which Mir Jumla was routed by Shahaji. Finally, Mir Jumla ran off to the fort of Gooty. Shahaji sieged the fort and Mir Jumla had to surrender and sign the treaty.  Contemporary Muslim chroniclers don\'t even mention this vastly successful campaign of Shahaji. They occasionally mention some Muslim generals of Adilshahi carried out a successful campaign with flying mentions or secondary attributes to Shahaji. The same chroniclers then complain Shahaji got stronger. Conclusion of these accounts is clear. The Muslim chroniclers did not write the painful(for them) reality of Maratha general winning wars and getting stronger.\n\n\\---'<br />Author: 'nanafadanavis'<br />id: 'hgpmxw'<br />Flair :Research</li>

<li>Title: 'THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MODERN LEFTISM'<br />Body: 'Almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled society. One of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world is leftism, so a discussion of the psychology of leftism can serve as an introduction to the discussion of the problems of modern society in general.\n\n7. But what is leftism? During the first half of the 20th century leftism could have been practically identified with socialism. Today the movement is fragmented and it is not clear who can properly be called a leftist. When we speak of leftists in this article we have in mind mainly socialists, collectivists, “politically correct” types, fminsts, gy and disability activists, animal rights activists and the like. But not everyone who is associated with one of these movements is a leftist. What we are trying to get at in discussing leftism is not so much movement or an ideology as a psychological type, or rather a collection of related types. Thus, what we mean by “leftism” will emerge more clearly in the course of our discussion of leftist psychology. (Also, see paragraphs 227-230.)\n\n8. Even so, our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less clear than we would wish, but there doesn’t seem to be any remedy for this. All we are trying to do here is indicate in a rough and approximate way the two psychological tendencies that we believe are the main driving force of modern leftism. We by no means claim to be telling the WHOLE truth about leftist psychology. Also, our discussion is meant to apply to modern leftism only. We leave open the question of the extent to which our discussion could be applied to the leftists of the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n9. The two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we call “feelings of inferiority” and “oversocialization.” Feelings of inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole, while oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of modern leftism; but this segment is highly influential.\n\nFEELINGS OF INFERIORITY\n\n10. By “feelings of inferiority” we mean not only inferiority feelings in the strict sense but a whole spectrum of related traits; low self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, depressive tendencies, defeatism, guilt, self- hatred, etc. We argue that modern leftists tend to have some such feelings (possibly more or less repressed) and that these feelings are decisive in determining the direction of modern leftism.\n\n11. When someone interprets as derogatory almost anything that is said about him (or about groups with whom he identifies) we conclude that he has inferiority feelings or low self-esteem. This tendency is pronounced among minority rights activists, whether or not they belong to the minority groups whose rights they defend. They are hypersensitive about the words used to designate minorities and about anything that is said concerning minorities. The terms “n,” “or,” “handicapped” or “chick” for an African, an Asian, a disabled person or a woman originally had no derogatory connotation. “Broad” and “chick” were merely the feminine equivalents of “guy,” “dude” or “fellow.” The negative connotations have been attached to these terms by the activists themselves. Some animal rights activists have gone so far as to reject the word “pet” and insist on its replacement by “animal companion.” Leftish anthropologists go to great lengths to avoid saying anything about primitive peoples that could conceivably be interpreted as negative. They want to replace the world “primitive” by “nonliterate.” They seem almost paranoid about anything that might suggest that any primitive culture is inferior to our own. (We do not mean to imply that primitive cultures ARE inferior to ours. We merely point out the hypersensitivity of leftish anthropologists.)\n\n12. Those who are most sensitive about “politically incorrect” terminology are not the average black - dweller, Asian immigrant, abused woman or disabled person, but a minority of activists, many of whom do not even belong to any “oppressed” group but come from privileged strata of society. Political correctness has its stronghold among university professors, who have secure employment with comfortable salaries, and the majority of whom are heterosexual white males from middle- to upper-middle-class families.\n\n13. Many leftists have an intense identification with the problems of groups that have an image of being weak (women), defeated (American Indians), repellent (homosexuals) or otherwise inferior. The leftists themselves feel that these groups are inferior. They would never admit to themselves that they have such feelings, but it is precisely because they do see these groups as inferior that they identify with their problems. (We do not mean to suggest that women, Indians, etc. ARE inferior; we are only making a point about leftist psychology.)\n\n14. Fminsts are desperately anxious to prove that women are as strong and as capable as men. Clearly they are nagged by a fear that women may NOT be as strong and as capable as men.\n\n15. Leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being strong, good and successful. They hate America, they hate Western civilization, they hate white males, they hate rationality. The reasons that leftists give for hating the West, etc. clearly do not correspond with their real motives. They SAY they hate the West because it is warlike, imperialistic, sexist, ethnocentric and so forth, but where these same faults appear in socialist countries or in primitive cultures, the leftist finds excuses for them, or at best he GRUDGINGLY admits that they exist; whereas he ENTHUSIASTICALLY points out (and often greatly exaggerates) these faults where they appear in Western civilization. Thus it is clear that these faults are not the leftist’s real motive for hating America and the West. He hates America and the West because they are strong and successful.\n\n16. Words like “self-confidence,” “self-reliance,” “initiative,” “enterprise,” “optimism,” etc., play little role in the liberal and leftist vocabulary. The leftist is anti-individualistic, pro-collectivist. He wants society to solve everyone’s problems for them, satisfy everyone’s needs for them, take care of them. He is not the sort of person who has an inner sense of confidence in his ability to solve his own problems and satisfy his own needs. The leftist is antagonistic to the concept of competition because, deep inside, he feels like a loser.\n\n17. Art forms that appeal to modern leftish intellectuals tend to focus on sordidness, defeat and despair, or else they take an orgiastic tone, throwing off rational control as if there were no hope of accomplishing anything through rational calculation and all that was left was to immerse oneself in the sensations of the moment.\n\n18. Modern leftish philosophers tend to dismiss reason, science, objective reality and to insist that everything is culturally relative. It is true that one can ask serious questions about the foundations of scientific knowledge and about how, if at all, the concept of objective reality can be defined. But it is obvious that modern leftish philosophers are not simply cool-headed logicians systematically analyzing the foundations of knowledge. They are deeply involved emotionally in their attack on truth and reality. They attack these concepts because of their own psychological needs. For one thing, their attack is an outlet for hostility, and, to the extent that it is successful, it satisfies the drive for power. More importantly, the leftist hates science and rationality because they classify certain beliefs as true (i.e., successful, superior) and other beliefs as false (i.e., failed, inferior). The leftist’s feelings of inferiority run so deep that he cannot tolerate any classification of some things as successful or superior and other things as failed or inferior. This also underlies the rejection by many leftists of the concept of mental illness and of the utility of IQ tests. Leftists are antagonistic to genetic explanations of human abilities or behavior because such explanations tend to make some persons appear superior or inferior to others. Leftists prefer to give society the credit or blame for an individual’s ability or lack of it. Thus if a person is “inferior” it is not his fault, but society’s, because he has not been brought up properly.\n\n19. The leftist is not typically the kind of person whose feelings of inferiority make him a braggart, an egotist, a bully, a self-promoter, a ruthless competitor. This kind of person has not wholly lost faith in himself. He has a deficit in his sense of power and self-worth, but he can still conceive of himself as having the capacity to be strong, and his efforts to make himself strong produce his unpleasant behavior. [1] But the leftist is too far gone for that. His feelings of inferiority are so ingrained that he cannot conceive of himself as individually strong and valuable. Hence the collectivism of the leftist. He can feel strong only as a member of a large organization or a mass movement with which he identifies himself.\n\n20. Notice the masochistic tendency of leftist tactics. Leftists protest by lying down in front of vehicles, they intentionally provoke police or racists to abuse them, etc. These tactics may often be effective, but many leftists use them not as a means to an end but because they PREFER masochistic tactics. Self-hatred is a leftist trait.\n\n21. Leftists may claim that their activism is motivated by compassion or by moral principles, and moral principle does play a role for the leftist of the oversocialized type. But compassion and moral principle cannot be the main motives for leftist activism. Hostility is too prominent a component of leftist behavior; so is the drive for power. Moreover, much leftist behavior is not rationally calculated to be of benefit to the people whom the leftists claim to be trying to help. For example, if one believes that affirmative action is good for black people, does it make sense to demand affirmative action in hostile or dogmatic terms? Obviously it would be more productive to take a diplomatic and conciliatory approach that would make at least verbal and symbolic concessions to white people who think that affirmative action discriminates against them. But leftist activists do not take such an approach because it would not satisfy their emotional needs. Helping black people is not their real goal. Instead, race problems serve as an excuse for them to express their own hostility and frustrated need for power. In doing so they actually harm black people, because the activists’ hostile attitude toward the white majority tends to intensify race hatred.\n\n22. If our society had no social problems at all, the leftists would have to INVENT problems in order to provide themselves with an excuse for making a fuss.\n\n23. We emphasize that the foregoing does not pretend to be an accurate description of everyone who might be considered a leftist. It is only a rough indication of a general tendency of leftism.\n\nOVERSOCIALIZATION\n\n24. Psychologists use the term “socialization” to designate the process by which children are trained to think and act as society demands. A person is said to be well socialized if he believes in and obeys the moral code of his society and fits in well as a functioning part of that society. It may seem senseless to say that many leftists are oversocialized, since the leftist is perceived as a rebel. Nevertheless, the position can be defended. Many leftists are not such rebels as they seem.\n\n25. The moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think, feel and act in a completely moral way. For example, we are not supposed to hate anyone, yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time or other, whether he admits it to himself or not. Some people are so highly socialized that the attempt to think, feel and act morally imposes a severe burden on them. In order to avoid feelings of guilt, they continually have to deceive themselves about their own motives and find moral explanations for feelings and actions that in reality have a non-moral origin. We use the term “oversocialized” to describe such people. [2]\n\n26. Oversocialization can lead to low self-esteem, a sense of powerlessness, defeatism, guilt, etc. One of the most important means by which our society socializes children is by making them feel ashamed of behavior or speech that is contrary to society’s expectations. If this is overdone, or if a particular child is especially susceptible to such feelings, he ends by feeling ashamed of HIMSELF. Moreover the thought and the behavior of the oversocialized person are more restricted by society’s expectations than are those of the lightly socialized person. The majority of people engage in a significant amount of naughty behavior. They lie, they commit petty thefts, they break traffic laws, they goof off at work, they hate someone, they say spiteful things or they use some underhanded trick to get ahead of the other guy. The oversocialized person cannot do these things, or if he does do them he generates in himself a sense of shame and self-hatred. The oversocialized person cannot even experience, without guilt, thoughts or feelings that are contrary to the accepted morality; he cannot think “unclean” thoughts. And socialization is not just a matter of morality; we are socialized to conform to many norms of behavior that do not fall under the heading of morality. Thus the oversocialized person is kept on a psychological leash and spends his life running on rails that society has laid down for him. In many oversocialized people this results in a sense of constraint and powerlessness that can be a severe hardship. We suggest that oversocialization is among the more serious cruelties that human beings inflict on one another.\n\n27. We argue that a very important and influential segment of the modern left is oversocialized and that their oversocialization is of great importance in determining the direction of modern leftism. Leftists of the oversocialized type tend to be intellectuals or members of the upper-middle class. Notice that university intellectuals [3] constitute the most highly socialized segment of our society and also the most left-wing segment.\n\n28. The leftist of the oversocialized type tries to get off his psychological leash and assert his autonomy by rebelling. But usually he is not strong enough to rebel against the most basic values of society. Generally speaking, the goals of today’s leftists are NOT in conflict with the accepted morality. On the contrary, the left takes an accepted moral principle, adopts it as its own, and then accuses mainstream society of violating that principle. Examples: racial equality, equality of the sexes, helping poor people, peace as opposed to war, nonviolence generally, freedom of expression, kindness to animals. More fundamentally, the duty of the individual to serve society and the duty of society to take care of the individual. All these have been deeply rooted values of our society (or at least of its middle and upper classes [4] for a long time. These values are explicitly or implicitly expressed or presupposed in most of the material presented to us by the mainstream communications media and the educational system. Leftists, especially those of the oversocialized type, usually do not rebel against these principles but justify their hostility to society by claiming (with some degree of truth) that society is not living up to these principles.\n\n29. Here is an illustration of the way in which the oversocialized leftist shows his real attachment to the conventional attitudes of our society while pretending to be in rebellion against it. Many leftists push for affirmative action, for moving black people into high-prestige jobs, for improved education in black schools and more money for such schools; the way of life of the black “underclass” they regard as a social disgrace. They want to integrate the black man into the system, make him a business executive, a lawyer, a scientist just like upper-middle-class white people. The leftists will reply that the last thing they want is to make the black man into a copy of the white man; instead, they want to preserve African American culture. But in what does this preservation of African American culture consist? It can hardly consist in anything more than eating black-style food, listening to black-style music, wearing black-style clothing and going to a black- style church or mosque. In other words, it can express itself only in superficial matters. In all ESSENTIAL respects most leftists of the oversocialized type want to make the black man conform to white, middle-class ideals. They want to make him study technical subjects, become an executive or a scientist, spend his life climbing the status ladder to prove that black people are as good as white. They want to make black fathers “responsible,” they want black gangs to become nonviolent, etc. But these are exactly the values of the industrial-technological system. The system couldn’t care less what kind of music a man listens to, what kind of clothes he wears or what religion he believes in as long as he studies in school, holds a respectable job, climbs the status ladder, is a “responsible” parent, is nonviolent and so forth. In effect, however much he may deny it, the oversocialized leftist wants to integrate the black man into the system and make him adopt its values.\n\n30. We certainly do not claim that leftists, even of the oversocialized type, NEVER rebel against the fundamental values of our society. Clearly they sometimes do. Some oversocialized leftists have gone so far as to rebel against one of modern society’s most important principles by engaging in physical violence. By their own account, violence is for them a form of “liberation.” In other words, by committing violence they break through the psychological restraints that have been trained into them. Because they are oversocialized these restraints have been more confining for them than for others; hence their need to break free of them. But they usually justify their rebellion in terms of mainstream values. If they engage in violence they claim to be fighting against racism or the like.\n\n31. We realize that many objections could be raised to the foregoing thumbnail sketch of leftist psychology. The real situation is complex, and anything like a complete description of it would take several volumes even if the necessary data were available. We claim only to have indicated very roughly the two most important tendencies in the psychology of modern leftism.\n\n32. The problems of the leftist are indicative of the problems of our society as a whole. Low self-esteem, depressive tendencies and defeatism are not restricted to the left. Though they are especially noticeable in the left, they are widespread in our society. And today’s society tries to socialize us to a greater extent than any previous society. We are even told by experts how to eat, how to exercise, how to make love, how to raise our kids and so forth.'<br />Author: 'dhtura'<br />id: 'hg97df'<br />Flair :Randia Simulation</li>

Now, if you look at the location of South Korea you understand its importance to China. I\'ve timestamped the video but watching it in full is quite instructive in light of the news of Congress party signing MOU with CCP.  Highlights if you want to know the gist of it.\n\nBTW, I worked in South Korea for a while and I kind of understand the country and its politics a bit more than an average Indian.\n\n1. China is building a large complex in south-west island of South Korea where it plans to bring in native Chinese and house them. They get voting rights after 3 years of residency\n2. China has been building multiple "China Town"s throughout the country. This way it got its foot in the door and started political brainwashing of commoners. Why is this brain washing possible? There are divided families between NK/SK and China tells them that presence of US in SK is stopping them from uniting them with their families. This argument has genuine currency.\n3. China bought top politicians and signed MOU with Democratic party (and not the govt). Now those party members are saying things like -"We should nationalize the land". Over a period of time, this will become a mainstream idea. And then, when "nationalization" happens, CCP will walk in and buy the country up.\n\nCCP does this kind of things everywhere. There is no need to work with WHO when you can buy people who work there for cheap. There is no need to work with the govts when you can buy people belonging to national parties for cheap. And this is where congress comes in IMO. It appears to my eyes that congress has already sold our country - hadn\'t BJP come to power unexpectedly, all the selling could have unraveled in front of our own eyes and we could do nothing about it. Yes, it\'s that scary!\n\nNow I understand why European countries are saying China is a threat to democracies all over the world.'<br />Author: 'ennis-jahsiah'<br />id: 'hegs9f'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion</li>

Fake news creates impression and beliefs \n\nbased on\n\nfalse premises leading to divison, misunderstanding and further exacerbating \n\notherwise\n\ntenuous  relations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe distribution of false information through fake news has become easier in \n\nthe age\n\nof internet, where anyone can post a report or a statement to resemble a news \n\nstory and claim\n\nit as true and factual. Fake news or information cause or intend to cause \n\npanic, division,\n\nchaos, violence, hate or must exhibit or intend to exhibit a propaganda to \n\nblacken or discredit\n\none\'s reputation. A large number of incidents of mob lynching have reported \n\nfrom various\n\npart of the country due to the spread of fake news in the social media like \n\nwhatsapp, Facebook,\n\nTwitter, etc. Studies have also found evidence of political parties spreading \n\npropaganda on\n\nsocial networks during elections in the country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the India being one of the most virtually-connected countries in the world \n\nwith\n\nmillion active social media users, we have access to platforms of media and \n\naccess to any\n\narray  of  information  available  on  the  web,  some  with  questionable  \n\nsources.  While  the\n\nresponsibility of discerning lie from truth falls with the person using the \n\ninformation, it is a\n\nmoral duty of the State to protect its people from such lies in the first \n\nplace. There is need to\n\ncurb the existence of disreputable news sources and prevent established mass \n\nmedia outlets\n\nfrom careless publishing of unverified or false content.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt present, India does not have a specific law to deal with menace of fake \n\nnews. Other\n\ncountries have taken strides in preventing the spread of false information \n\nthrough legislations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe need is to nip the cause of fake news in the bud by prohibiting the \n\ncreation and\n\nmalicious distribution of false information. It aims to ensure that the content \n\nbeing published\n\nand disseminated by mass media outlets and social media personalities are free \n\nfrom false,\n\nmisleading or fictitious stories through a clear definition of what fake news \n\nis. It penalizes not\n\nonly the creation of false content and the malicious distribution thereof, but \n\nalso the failure\n\nto remove such content once it has been published, with verying penalties \n\ndepending on the\n\ngravity of the act.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe need is also to encourage our citizens, especially public officers, to be \n\nmore\n\nresponsible and circumspect in creating, distributing and/or sharing news. \n\nAddressing national\n\nand global concerns should not be made more complicated by false news \n\ncalculated to cause\n\ndisunity, panic, chaos and/or violence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn addition, penalizing mass media enterprise or social media platform that \n\nfails, neglects\n\nor refuses to remove false news or information within a reasonable period after \n\nhaving\n\nknowledge, or having reasonable grounds to believe of its falsity is also \n\nrequired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Bill aims to encourage responsible and credible journalism, as well as \n\ncreating\n\nawareness of the harmful effects of spreading untruthful facts. Misleading and \n\ndeceptive\n\nnews may cause divisiveness, health hazards, security risks, panic and chaos to \n\nthis nation,\n\ncontrary to our Constitutionally enshrined principle of adhering to a policy of \n\npeace and\n\ncooperation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNEW  DELHI;                                                                     \n\nRAMA DEVI\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJune 26, 2019.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMEMORANDUM  REGARDING  DELEGATED  LEGISLATION\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClause 10 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to make rules for carrying\n\nout the purposes of the Bill.

I would love to know your view on this.'<br />Body: "**I am a proud and devout Hindu.**  \n**I am a proud and devout Hindu.** **I am a proud Indian.**  \n**I am a supporter of BJP.**   \nBut now my view is changing. Now I know that what I truly support, and what I truly believe is not in BJP, but right-wing ideology.  Let's be honest. There is only one party in the right-wing in India, i.e., the BJP. Uddhav Thackeray (Shiv Sena), betrayed us. The only party that is truly right-wing in India is the BJP. The rest are too small to consider. However, the left-wing has a huge list of parties. INC, BSP, CPI, AAP, AITC, etc. The leftists have a large set of options to choose from. The leftists have a choice. They can promote left-wing ideology by voting for any party that they choose. This is something right-wing followers don't have.  \n\n**We don't have a choice.**\n\n If we want to support right-wing ideology, we have to support BJP. There is no other way, simply because there is no other party we can choose from that supports right-wing ideology! When I have debates with leftists, I put forwards my points on right-wing ideology, and they keep countering my points by showing mistakes of BJP. Let's admit it. BJP brings out things with the best of intentions, and sometimes they are highly necessary, but they suck at the implementation of these. I want to promote a right-wing ideology, but when everybody imagines the right-wing of India with BJP and its mistakes, it is hard for me to do so. \n\nI support the right-wing. I want an Akhand Bharat. I want to live in a Hindu Rashtra. I want to live in a country that loves me for my religion, and where my religion does not become a problem for me.  When BJP makes mistakes, the image of the right-wing gets damaged. Statements of some of their politicians, allegations against some, comments on some issue, not raising a voice on some issue are all things that hurt the right-wing of India. \n\n **What we need now is a political party that endorses right-wing ideology and philosophy, no bullshit of trying to include all people.** We need a political party that supports Hindu's. We need a party which does not bring people who have huge allegations against them. We need a party that will help India become very serious competition for the USA and China. We need a party which doesn't allow BJP and it's politicians mistakes to tarnish the image of the right-wing.  \n\n**What we need, my friends is a choice.**  We need to have political parties on the right-wing that allow the Hindu's of our country to know that if not BJP, they have other right-wing parties to choose from.  \n\n**I will keep supporting BJP**, till a party/parties like this come forward. The reason for this is that currently, BJP is the only party that works for the betterment of the Hindu's. BJP is a good party, but giving it the complete control over the image of the right-wing is something I, and I hope a lot of you will not be ready to give. We need more options. We need more parties on the right-wing. We need more parties that work for Hindu's. \n\n **Jai Hind.** **Jai Bharat.**"<br />Author: 'AKartikeya'<br />id: 'hd4ggb'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion</li>

He has been posted in grave terrorist, toughterrains and I feel if someone like GDB is siggesting or implying something it should be paid heed to, and also that rahul gandhi, chest beating about we have given our land is false information, because from finger 4 to finger 8 in Galwan valley, there has been a yearly transgression from their side, because of their perception of LAC.\nI try explaining all this to my dad and he refuses to believe and trust anyone except the government.\n\nI understand the secrecy and security point of view. I understand there is a protocol and we can\'t be shelling out any and every information in the public domain but the information that is in the public domain, has to be clarified on the govs part. If Maj. Gen. G D Bakshi knows, if independent nationalist journalists and media houses like Zee News know then either you hide it well or you tell people who really want to know if their country is safe and we have all our men. \n\nBut for my dad, there is no grey area, it is either white or black. Either I am Rahul Gandhi or I am not. He says that I am talking like Rahu Gandhi and says my feelings and words are that of an anti national.

<li>Title: 'I wrote an article regarding the phrase that many people use, day to day which is,"It is your opinion man!", the problems with the phrase are shown in the article below'<br />Body: '# Ridiculing The Phrase: It is your opinion\n\nIn my opinion, this phrase is very much related to the words which belong to the phrase itself, the most important of which is “opinion”, an opinion is pretty much your thinking on a topic or subject.\n\nBut where do we draw the line between opinions and tyrannical thought?\n\nHere, the line is drawn on the opinion you have itself and its relation to the fact, which has been researched upon and proven. The farther away it is from the fact the more it reaches a conspiracy or in some places tyrannical thought on a subject.\n\nSo, saying the phrase “It is your opinion, man”, may be right in some places, the key word some needs to be pressurized, mainly because this phrase is, as far as I have seen, used for the thought related to conspiracy and less well-thought out opinion, which takes facts into consideration.  \n\nSo, the end message in this article is that, just think out when this phrase is used, because you may just use this on someone who’s opinion differs wildly at times even hurting the facts’ integrity itself.'<br />Author: 'Generocide'<br />id: 'hcp82o'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>

There is no border fence. Chinese and Indian troops cross into each other\'s territory all the time, even right now incursions are going on throughout the 3000km long porous border. Then they both go back to patrolling other areas.\n\nMaybe they did enter our land, Maybe they were beat back after.\nMaybe Modi has read ArthaShastra which ordains how to deal with a weak enemy (Pakistan) and how to deal with a strong enemy (China), how to project strength during weakness, and weakness during strength.\n\nWould you be happy if he said *\'they did enter/grab land\'* ?  \nWhat will the next set of questions be ?  \nHe has to then manage public opinion which might end up curtailing or forcing the Army into doing something they didn\'t plan for.  \nModi is not obliged to reveal full information to everyone everytime.  \nYou think PoohPing does it ?  \n*"But China is dictatorship and we\'re not REEE"* - Go back to point 4 above - either vote for him, or don\'t.\n\nWe armchairs can do only one thing useful right now. **Keep quiet**.  \nSo those that are actually thinking are not distracted.

<li>Title: "MUST READ: An Excerpt from today's ToI editorial on India-China relations"<br />Body: 'Next time a decision is being considered in the economic or political sphere that may displease Beijing, many voices around Modi will advise caution. No one wants to be in the position of dealing with a new incursion of Chinese troops across the border. These same voices will likely push for a more active posture in all four sectors of the border. This gets things exactly wrong. If it wants to avoid falling into the strategic trap that has been laid for it, India needs to de-escalate tensions at the border while increasing activity where the real game is being played: in the Indian Ocean, in the race to develop the key technologies of the future, and in the battle to control critical infrastructure.\n\n\nThe first and most important lesson in the “new great game” is not to be distracted from the main prize. The second lesson is to preserve your margin of action.\n\n\nThose who consulted the Chinese press over the last week must have noticed an interesting fact: The recent battle between Indian and Chinese troops in Ladakh was nowhere to be seen. The possibility of war was not created and managed for domestic consumption.

<li>Title: 'Hindi Poetry - Bhagwaan Krishna ki Chetavani - by Rashtrakavi Ramdhari Singh Dinkar'<br />Body: 'Background - This poetry "Krishna ki Chetavani" is a part of Ramdhari Singh Dinkar\'s Hindi epic "Rashmirathi". It describes the part of Mahabharata when Shri Krishna went to Hastinapur as the Shantidoot (messenger) of the Pandavas &amp; requested Duryodhan to accept peace in exchange of giving the Pandavas nothing more than 5 villages. But Duryodhan instead tried to capture Shri Krishna. Shri Krishna then revealed his vishwaroop in Dhritarashtra\'s Court.\n\nRamdhari Singh Dinkar writes-\n\n\u200b\n\nवर्षों तक वन में घूम-घूम,\nबाधा-विघ्नों को चूम-चूम,\nसह धूप-घाम, पानी-पत्थर,\nपांडव आये कुछ और निखर।\nसौभाग्य न सब दिन सोता है,\nदेखें, आगे क्या होता है। \n\nमैत्री की राह बताने को,\nसबको सुमार्ग पर लाने को,\nदुर्योधन को समझाने को,\nभीषण विध्वंस बचाने को,\nभगवान् हस्तिनापुर आये,\nपांडव का संदेशा लाये। \n\n‘दो न्याय अगर तो आधा दो,\nपर, इसमें भी यदि बाधा हो,\nतो दे दो केवल पाँच ग्राम,\nरक्खो अपनी धरती तमाम।\nहम वहीं खुशी से खायेंगे,\nपरिजन पर असि न उठायेंगे! \n\nदुर्योधन वह भी दे ना सका,\nआशीष समाज की ले न सका,\nउलटे, हरि को बाँधने चला,\nजो था असाध्य, साधने चला।\nजब नाश मनुज पर छाता है,\nपहले विवेक मर जाता है। \n\nहरि ने भीषण हुंकार किया,\nअपना स्वरूप-विस्तार किया,\nडगमग-डगमग दिग्गज डोले,\nभगवान् कुपित होकर बोले-\n‘जंजीर बढ़ा कर साध मुझे,\nहाँ, हाँ दुर्योधन! बाँध मुझे। \n\nयह देख, गगन मुझमें लय है,\nयह देख, पवन मुझमें लय है,\nमुझमें विलीन झंकार सकल,\nमुझमें लय है संसार सकल।\nअमरत्व फूलता है मुझमें,\nसंहार झूलता है मुझमें। \n\n‘उदयाचल मेरा दीप्त भाल,\nभूमंडल वक्षस्थल विशाल,\nभुज परिधि-बन्ध को घेरे हैं,\nमैनाक-मेरु पग मेरे हैं।\nदिपते जो ग्रह नक्षत्र निकर,\nसब हैं मेरे मुख के अन्दर। \n\n‘दृग हों तो दृश्य अकाण्ड देख,\nमुझमें सारा ब्रह्माण्ड देख,\nचर-अचर जीव, जग, क्षर-अक्षर,\nनश्वर मनुष्य सुरजाति अमर।\nशत कोटि सूर्य, शत कोटि चन्द्र,\nशत कोटि सरित, सर, सिन्धु मन्द्र। \n\n‘शत कोटि विष्णु, ब्रह्मा, महेश,\nशत कोटि जिष्णु, जलपति, धनेश,\nशत कोटि रुद्र, शत कोटि काल,\nशत कोटि दण्डधर लोकपाल।\nजञ्जीर बढ़ाकर साध इन्हें,\nहाँ-हाँ दुर्योधन! बाँध इन्हें। \n\n‘भूलोक, अतल, पाताल देख,\nगत और अनागत काल देख,\nयह देख जगत का आदि-सृजन,\nयह देख, महाभारत का रण,\nमृतकों से पटी हुई भू है,\nपहचान, इसमें कहाँ तू है। \n\n‘अम्बर में कुन्तल-जाल देख,\nपद के नीचे पाताल देख,\nमुट्ठी में तीनों काल देख,\nमेरा स्वरूप विकराल देख।\nसब जन्म मुझी से पाते हैं,\nफिर लौट मुझी में आते हैं। \n\n‘जिह्वा से कढ़ती ज्वाल सघन,\nसाँसों में पाता जन्म पवन,\nपड़ जाती मेरी दृष्टि जिधर,\nहँसने लगती है सृष्टि उधर!\nमैं जभी मूँदता हूँ लोचन,\nछा जाता चारों ओर मरण। \n\n‘बाँधने मुझे तो आया है,\nजंजीर बड़ी क्या लाया है?\nयदि मुझे बाँधना चाहे मन,\nपहले तो बाँध अनन्त गगन।\nसूने को साध न सकता है,\nवह मुझे बाँध कब सकता है? \n\n‘हित-वचन नहीं तूने माना,\nमैत्री का मूल्य न पहचाना,\nतो ले, मैं भी अब जाता हूँ,\nअन्तिम संकल्प सुनाता हूँ।\nयाचना नहीं, अब रण होगा,\nजीवन-जय या कि मरण होगा। \n\n‘टकरायेंगे नक्षत्र-निकर,\nबरसेगी भू पर वह्नि प्रखर,\nफण शेषनाग का डोलेगा,\nविकराल काल मुँह खोलेगा।\nदुर्योधन! रण ऐसा होगा।\nफिर कभी नहीं जैसा होगा। \n\n‘भाई पर भाई टूटेंगे,\nविष-बाण बूँद-से छूटेंगे,\nवायस-श्रृगाल सुख लूटेंगे,\nसौभाग्य मनुज के फूटेंगे।\nआखिर तू भूशायी होगा,\nहिंसा का पर, दायी होगा।’ \n\nथी सभा सन्न, सब लोग डरे,\nचुप थे या थे बेहोश पड़े।\nकेवल दो नर ना अघाते थे,\nधृतराष्ट्र-विदुर सुख पाते थे।\nकर जोड़ खड़े प्रमुदित,\nनिर्भय, दोनों पुकारते थे ‘जय-जय’! \n\n[Vishwaroop](https://images.app.goo.gl/GuxBXEZwuo5c85vt9)'<br />Author: 'Loweowe'<br />id: 'hc0adl'<br />Flair :Hindi Poetry</li>

<li>Title: 'Guys and Girls, Please Stop Using RIP for the dead ones.'<br />Body: 'WHY RIP IS NOT THE CORRECT FORM OF CONDOLENCE TO A HINDU FAMILY\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nR.I.P means Rest in Peace-\n\nIn Christianity, this short epitaph signifies wishing rest and peace to someone who has died. Christians bury the dead ones and the soul rests in peace in that grave until the judgment day arrives. On the Judgment day, the Lord will decide who goes where- Heaven or Hell. They believe that on the Judgment day the dead will rise again. Until that time, the soul has to remain inside that coffin. Hence the blessing Rest In Peace (until the judgement day)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, Hinduism does not have any concept such as that of rising of dead ones. Hinduism believes in reincarnation. It says that the cycle of birth and death are governed by the Karma of individuals. The deceased individual would take another birth based upon the Karma of this life. So there is no rest and hence, the concept of RIP is not valid in Hinduism. Hinduism believes in Moksha that is liberation- Liberation from the endless cycles of birth and death. That’s why instead of using RIP we should say, “Om Shanti” or “Aatma Ko Sadgati Prapt Ho (May Soul attain Moksha)” or simply "Om Sadgati". Sadgati means salvation or liberation. We always pray that may the soul get liberated from the cycle of life and death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn fact, the concept of RIP would remotely come close to the concept of Preta (Evil, hungry ghosts) which is basically a curse in the Hindu way of life. An individual after leaving his/her body becomes Preta. When we say RIP , we are praying for the soul to remain locked into a standstill on Earth as it becomes Preta for eternity. That’s why in Hindu way of life there is a concept of Terahvin (13 days). For 13 days family members of deceased persuade the Pretas every day with various invocations and offerings requesting them to leave this earth and move on to their next destination which could be either incarnation or salvation (moksha). By saying Om Sadgati we prompt the soul to move on and not remain in \'peace\' here..'<br />Author: 'Dhruv_Colossus'<br />id: 'ha8yid'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>

Just accept it \n\nChina on the other hand, has most risen from poverty and corruption despite the population still large than of India, CCP has mostly solved basic problems and is  now going in direction of being a superpower.\n China was always the wealthiest country throughout ancient, medival, and early modern period, it wasn't India it was China. You're not immune to any type of propaganda.\nMoving on current situation, it's the China who is actually winning, it has even started building it's new silk road, it will stretch from Asia to Europe and Africa and its centre will be China. They're really on their way to gain their old throne and unlike America china already has gained powerful ways to silent any voice against it. \nTheir government and companies invest in every single country and especially in Africa, they control the media!! Look at how YouTube, reddit, tiktok shadow people and if it continues like that every voice against it will immediately will be shut. \nThis is how far they've coming into in just 20 years. \nThey're even building ports in Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Look how our old friend Nepal is now no more different than Pakistan. At this point do we have any allies left? \nChina will control Indian Ocean, central Asia, sub saharan Africa and south China sea if it keeps continuing, they will get every influential region it the world. We only had Indian Ocean to be dominant in as our paths to central and east Asia were blocked by China. It shame how some Indians seem so confident with indo China issue.

<li>Title: 'You Fail, They Succeed. You Succeed, They Fail'<br />Body: "u/CholiMein, u/Br_in please pin this temporarily.\n\n**PLEASE READ THE FULL POST**\n\nI recently came across a tweet by Vivek Agnihotri which shook me from the root of my spine.\n\nWe all know that commies want to create unrest in the society.\n\nYou may think that riots, stone pelting, burning buses, hurting economy, etc. are the only type of unrest one can create in a society.\n\nWRONG!\n\n**IF you are unfocused, unhappy, hateful, angry, frustrated and unhealthy, THEY HAVE SUCCEEDED!**\n\nMental unrest is the WORST type of unrest in a society.\n\nYou may think you are winning because you know who they are and their intentions and everything else. **But that's what they want!**\n\nThey want you to know who they are so that you become angry and frustrated.\n\nThe news where they use words like 'maths teacher, tik tok start' are done on purpose so that hindus become frustrated and unfocused.\n\nWHY?\n\n**An unfocused society is a highway to poverty.**\n\nAbject poverty is their goal. Only then communism can be imposed.\n\n*YOU ARE HELPING THEM by being angry, hateful and unfocused and thus unproductive.*\n\nThey are focused, productive and make a lot of money. Then they use to money to fund commies who further continue destruction.\n\nUnrest is their goal. Be it any type of unrest.\n\n**THE ONLY WAY** to defeat commies is POSITIVITY.\n\n**What kind of positivity?**\n\nI want you to become so bloody successful inside and outside, that your success BURNS these commies within.\n\n**Remember:** A successful and happy democratic society is the WORST nightmare of commies.\n\nGive them that nightmare.\n\n**So how to do that?**\n\n***Here are a few things that turned my life around in an unimaginable way:***\n\n**1) Yoga by Isha Foundation:** This has been the MOST impactful experience for me. Sadhguru has some incredible methods of transformations and it's free( the beginner ones are free).\n\nThere's an app called Yoga Tools by isha foundation. Those 7 beginner yoga tools are a good start. I can't stress enough on how important they are.\n\nThese methods have taken away a lot major compulsions I had. For e.g. I'm on brahmacharya, so nofap was the biggest challenge for me. Yoga is helped me to come over these compulsions and use the energy somewhere worthwhile.\n\nYoga is now an inseparable part of my life. It's a must.\n\n**2) Healthy diet -** Eat healthy, nutritious and light weight food. Drink fruit juices as per fruit season.\n\nNimboo pani daily after at least 2 hours after meal boosts immunity dramatically. Daily consumption of honey increases iron in body and keeps you energized throughout the day.\n\nConsume protein power for protein instead of eating heavy foods meat/beef/chicken. It's infinitely more healthy. Refer to Fit Tuber on YouTube to know more. Don't argue with me in the comments.\n\n**3) Think big:** No I'm not talking about akhand bharat here. I'm talking about seeing beyond survival. Don't just think of getting a job. Think how you can create jobs. This pandemic is an opportunity. Make use of it."<br />Author: 'johnkarter767612'<br />id: 'h812b8'<br />Flair :High IQ</li>

<li>Title: 'Perception of a particular religion'<br />Body: 'Media plays important role in creating a minder or view point of people, Media it maybe be our news source, movies, articles and videos from big influencer and others.\n\nRecently there\'s a news that a Baba who kiss hands of his devotees to cure them from diseases had corona and he spread it to many others.\nEveryone around me just assumed that the Baba must be from "this" religion, and there\'s no second thought in their mind. Because only "this" religion is so stupid. But it turned out the Baba is from "other" religion.\n\nThere\'s also another recent  incident sad incident, several "this caste" households are burnt and they were beaten . Same thing happened again people already made their mind that attackers are from this "particular caste" and obviously follow "this" religion.\nAgain it turned out the attackers are from "other" religion.\n\nThere was more than 10 shameful incidents of people rejecting to eat food cooked from "this caste", people and media mentioned the caste of these castiest people in headline only when it was done by "particular caste" which is 1 incident , but for other same incidents which are more than 10 incidents, people assumed that it must be done by this "particular caste" and media is no longer mentioning the caste of these castiest people.\n\nWe see everywhere that when one follows "this" religion , there\'s this mindset that they are stupid, idiots, uncouth, lack scientific knowledge, and of communal mindset. This is shown every where from movies to shows, newspaper to social media.\nPeople find it cool to make fun of "this" religion, and if you follow "this" religion you\'re a low iq , low mentality, narrow minded person. People will encourage you , lecture you to become atheist if you follow "this" religion. Also it is seen as really open minded person if you say bad about "particular caste" , blame everything wrong with the society on "particular caste", thinks like "particular caste" go back, smash "particular caste" patriarchy, "particular caste" must die and "particular caste" = Castiest person. But when a terrorist activity happens , and people associate this "other" religion to it, same people will protest against it that you can\'t target a particular religion like this, which is a right thing to do ( IMO) but they do the opposite thing with "particular caste" and also promote things like this.\n\nI can go on there\'s thousands of things to say bad about "this" religion and "particular caste", but these aren\'t the only Evil religion/caste. You can\'t blame everything one a single community, blaming never change things our actions change te society.\n\nSo what\'s your opinion on the Evil of Society?'<br />Author: 'RandomCitizenOfMars'<br />id: 'h7xhze'<br />Flair :BAIT HAI BC</li>

And beaurocrats have a left bias because of the educational system which the communist infiltrated with success.\n\nNow why does the USA FIGHTS WARS,\nIt's simple,\nCapitalistic gains.\n***And to prevent a country from becoming a regional supremacy***\n\nNow why does USA favours china in many terms, \nIt's because china has them by their throats. US is in debt to china in terms of economic powers and debt. They are in debt to china for some amount close to $1.1 trillion. Many American companies have their manufacturing in China. One thing is appreciable about trump is that he's making sure American companies come back to US.\n\nCommunism is deeply rooted in their beaurocrats, \n\nHow does social media plays a role,\nI'll be adding this in part 3 after doing some more information digging."<br />Author: 'lainfan'<br />id: 'h0lwm5'<br />Flair :Bakchod News</li>

They were adopting the Middle-East strategies of planting women at front so men can attack the police.\n\nThe above report by CNN implicates an AAP MLA Mohammad Athar in the Chandbagh riots where the mobs attacked the police forces &amp; killed Constable Ratan Lal &amp; almost killed DCP Amit Sharma. Athar is alleged to have brought the protesters who were carrying guns, sickles, etc. \n\nHowever, yesterday, when the chargesheet of murder of Ratan Lal was released, there was no Mohammad Athar in the chargesheet. Now maybe because it\'s because Athar is innocent &amp; locals were wrong.\n\nBut let\'s also remember that Inspector Vishal isn\'t the first police officer who was involved with investigating Delhi riots investigators to ~~be murdered~~ died under mysterious circumstances. Even IB officer Ankit Sharma who was performing duty incognito in Tahir Hussain\'s locality was the first to be not just murdered, but brutally murdered, stabbed 51 times &amp; then thrown into the drain as a targeted killing of the IB/police force. What nexus had Ankit Sharma uncovered that he was tortured so much before death?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gy62q2/a_police_officer_who_was_part_of_delhi_police/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gvpvdg/big_delhi_police_chargesheet_says_ib_official/\n\nLet\'s also remember that up till 2 days before ~~murder~~mysterious death of Inspector Vishal, Kejriwal government was fighting a legal battle to let AAP lawyers represent Delhi police force in prosecution cases against ex-AAP MLA Tahir Hussain &amp; other Delhi case riots. \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gtxeo9/these_articles_explain_why_inspite_of_delhi/\n\nAmanatullah Khan even today is trying to save Tahir Hussain saying the only reason Tahir Hussain has been charged by Delhi police is because he is a Muslim. [Just before the riots, Tahir Hussain had called Amanatullah 56 times, Sisodiya 18 times &amp; Kejriwal 3 times.](https://www.organiser.org/Encyc/2020/3/3/Tahir-Hussain-trail-leads-to-Arvind-Kejriwal-and-Manish-Sisodia.amp.html) Yet even today, even with multiple AAP leaders being named by locals in bringing the riot mobs, Tahir Hussain is painted by the media to be the sole mastermind of riots. Maybe a plain corporator indeed is the sole mastermind of the riots planned the exact days current PM was in global spotlight, maybe no other PM aspirants were involved in/had knowledge of these riots.\n\nAfter Epstein **killed himself**, all the pedo-ring investigations in US went cold. Given now even police officers investigating the case are being murdered, would the big names, the real names behind the riots be charged?'<br />Author: 'brackenlassie'<br />id: 'h084xb'<br />Flair :Jihad</li>

I\'m a average person who knows some Mahabharat and ramayan coz I have watched some shows.\n\n-( When you answer a point please add --answer of 1. ,2. , 3. Etc so I can understand your views/answer fully )-\n\n1. What\'s your views on SADHGURU? Do you have any understanding of what he\'s talking about?\n\n2. What\'s your views on attachment?\n\n3. What\'s your views on enlightenment?\n\n4. What\'s your views on sprituality? \n\n5. If you\'re a person who only believe in something or know that there is this thing(big bang, Black hole etc) that\'s because there\'s some "scientific evidence" how do you view life,God,Truth, enlightenment, attachment, pleasure?\n\n6. Sir, when we see some people "converting" to Hinduism/sanatan dhram don\'t you think that HOW THE HELL CAN SOMEONE "CONVERT" TO Hinduism/sanatan dhram?? I have seen some videos of pandits/pujaaris saying some mantr or doing something (rituals).. to "convert" them BUT sir, i have small knowledge of scriptures so help me to understand WHEN DID ASIAN RELIGIONS BECOME ORGANIZED RELIGIONS???\n\n7. WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ON EDUCATION? DO YOU THINK IF SOMEONE KNOW HOW TO DO MATH OR WRITE AND READ SOMETHING THEY\'RE EDUCATED? In world there are millions of people who knows how to do math, write something,read something but still all of them are suffering.. there are wars, violence in everyday life, don\'t you think education is to see things as they are? what is real education? \n\n8. What\'s your views on love? Do you think love is just sex? Or do you think it\'s something more? Sir, what is love? Do you think love of a mother/father is love? Does love have any boundaries or is it limitless?\n\n9. Sir, what\'s your views on pleasure? Don\'t you think we\'re always looking for some pleasure? Pleasure of knowledge, position,power, possession, etc.\n\n10. Sir, don\'t you think we have to face our daily life problems rather than running away from it by watching movies, drinking alcohol, sex, violence.. do you see sir what I\'m saying?\n\n11. In your views/understanding what is God? I\'m not asking what Geeta, puranas, Quran, science says.. I\'m asking what do you think about God? \n\n12. Sir, fear is Necessary for something to survive but after surviving there\'s no need to be afraid.. people always depends on religion because they are afraid, they\'re afraid of coming to an end.. they have all these problems instead of solving this they go on into their lives their daily life which is miserable.\n\n13. What is it that you truly want? I\'m not talking about your daily needs.. I\'m asking WHY are you living? Why are you here reading this? What are you seeking?\n\n14. Have you heard of SADHGURU talking about confidence? If not in short he said "confidence without clarity is disaster" which is true, we\'re taught to be more confident.. peoples like Sandeep Maheshwaari have some clarity I\'m not denying that but he doesn\'t have full clarity which is absolutely needed to understand the truth/god,etc he and many more people say go fight for your success, do more work to become successful.. does successful mean have money?  they don\'t ask the basic question which is why are you seeking?\n\n15. I\'m not a follower of anything I\'m asking WHY you follow something at all isn\'t because you\'re afraid? Isn\'t because you want others to decide your life? Yes people have taught you how to stand, talk ,walk, eat, which is needed to be a functioning member of society but that\'s it. After knowing this and that that\'s it. but after this you stay dependent on others because they have taught you all of this and you assume they know better and that\'s where the game of following begins..\n\n\n\n\n\n( If you\'re not interested it\'s ok ignore it like u have always been ignoring it.

<li>Title: 'Right Media, Left media. Wtf is this?'<br />Body: 'Long post, please read if you care about a fellow. \n\nI am awfully dejected by the dirty politics and the acts of media. \nThe right-wing does not want to realize its flaws and the left-wing, words will be less to describe its evil nature and the doom it is planning to bring in our country. I can never fathom to be a leftist. \n\nBefore coming to my rant, let me give you guys a brief intro, So you guys dare not to think of me as from the other side (because thats all you guys do when someone points out a fault in your belief system)\nI am a Hindu,19, avid reader/learner of Veda and Mahabharat, and a proud believer of the omniscient nature of Vedas. Look up to great sages like Swami Dayanand, Bhishma Pitamah, and also the recently passed Rajiv Dixit(Up for a debate on this name). \nI took birth in a Dalit family. (Which is actually not Dalit because caste is not birth right but derived by the occupation according to manusmriti) \nNow, Our Hindu texts and Manusmriti(which was used as constitution till few thousand years) are the most well constructed guidelines which leaks only minimal crimes/wrong doings. \nI assume it is well known in this sub that these texts have been altered and entered with nefarious addings since the Mughal invasion and primarily in the British raj times. \nThese editing were only successfully due to greedy pandits. The seemingly rigid system cannot fall unless the the man in power lets it. \nYou dare not assume that I talk about every pandit in this context. \nAfter the independence, our system has divided into two parts in public, the people who want to bury our religion and the people who has agreed on the addings and practice it there on. \nYou don’t have to be too smart to name who’s who. \nI am in no mood to care about the left so I’ll just say about the remaining that has taught themselves to believe\n\n* Hanuman was a monkey and / not a Vanar (वन =forest + नर =man) the man living in forest\n\n* Shri Krishna was a womanizer, left Radha at early age and / not realizing the fact this is just foul play from the addings to ruin our gods character while there is no mention of the existence of Radha and stealing of butter /maakhan etc in Shuddh Mahabharat\n\n* Panchali was wife of 5 pandavs  and / not caring to read the actual sanskrit shloks which reveal, Panchali was handed to Yudhishtra from Arjuna after he won the swaymvar\n\n* The existence of fantasies like Aakashwani (voice from sky) and characterization of nature bodies (like ganga river to Ganga mother of Bhishma) and / not realizing that these addings are only to take you further from your own  religion, they translate Aakashwani from देवदूतस्य भाशितम which means the messenger of dev(the learned man) speaks. \n\nand many more, these were made to give a wonderland image to our religion so we intend on converting. \n\nBut most of all, these addings were aimed to divide us. They targeted the weakest link, the laborers, the dalits. \nTo cause a havoc and showcase the cruelty on the hardworkers to wake the emotional counterpart. \n\nTherefore, they absolutely abused our books with rules and limitation within the varna-occupation system. Filled it with filthy and sinister “punishments”. Led crimes against your own people, killings on Dalits. Bred ever-longing hatred towards the poor and untouchability. \nAnd to completely polarize, the britishers made the dalits “मूलनिवासी”, to image the aggressor as invaders.  \nThey even formulated restrictions against women. \n\nNow, my problem lies with people forgetting our own religion and burgeoning from the roots of britshers’ deeds. \nThe hate towards dalits still seeps in our country. \nStates like UP, have the most killings against Dalits. \nThey are still untouchable in some areas, murdered if entered mandir in villages. Are you serious? Every human had the right to perform Agnihotra hawan twice a day and now even the entry in mandir is restricted. \n\nOn 8th June 2020, A 17 year old dalit boy was killed in one of UP’s village for temple rules. Look up the internet and you’ll find whats dreadful. \nNone of this so called right wing media posted even an article on this crime while you all find almost all the left wingers articles ranging from ndtv to quint. \nMuch of their news is fake, but these killings are real. \nThe hatred in people’s eyes is real. Media reflects the ideologies of people to great extent.\nI am speaking about this because it is often overlooked. I am not just another dalit seeking of your worthless sympathy, but just to unite us Hindi, the arya we are, to fight the other side.  \n\nIn the wake of BLM in America, let’s reassess our beliefs against casteism. \nCasteism is not foul, but the perception is. \n\nP.S I can debate on anything I said.'<br />Author: 'theconcentrated'<br />id: 'gzwekp'<br />Flair :Rant</li>

Normally, you will not even think of trying to touch or rotate this stone block, but someone accidentally discovered or re-discovered that it could be rotated.  What could possibly be the reason to have something like this installed in a temple? To set up something like this there has to be a rotating mechanism and it is not easy to set this up in stone because you cannot open it afterwards and put lubricant inside. \n\nTo have a rotating mechanism made of stone, you need to have advanced knowledge in engineering. No, this is not the only temple with moving parts, look at this one. Here is a column which has small holes through which, you can insert your finger. Inside, there is a ball, a stone ball and you can move it up and down. Of course, you cannot pull the ball out through these tiny holes, you can only move it inside the hollow column. How was the ball put inside in the first place? If you claim this is carved, how did they manage to scoop out the rock which was inside through these small holes? There is another ancient temple in a place called Uthirakosamangai, this is at least 1200 years old. There is a ball inside a lion's mouth. You can roll the ball, you can rotate it, but you cannot pull it out of the lions' mouth. What's more bizarre? the lion is made of solid granite, but the ball inside is made of a type of rock called Onyx. So how was this ball put inside the lion's mouth, and why are we not able to pull this ball out? More and More young people are becoming interested in Indian temples and they are sending some incredible videos to my email. Here is a snake’s mouth wide open, and the mouth is held open because Lord Vishnu’s Conch shell is placed between its upper and lower jaw. But you can rotate this Conch. \n\nIt spins very well, much better than some modern rotating devices. But the real question is: why were these moving parts set up in temples? Some say that if you move these parts in a certain rhythm, in a certain order or a certain speed, secret chambers can be opened which are hiding in plain sight. Now what do I mean by this?  Let us look at this one, this is a safe box to keep money and boxes like these were used in India for many centuries. There is a type of safe used by a group called Chettiyars, they have mastered the art of safe making. It is so complex, it is uncrackable even today, unless you know which knobs to turn, in which order, to open the safe. In fact, when a normal person looks at this for the first time, he will not even realize that this as a safe that can be opened, he will just think that this is a decorative piece made of solid metal.  But now, look at this ceiling in an ancient temple in a place called Vettuvan Kovil. This is made of stone, and of course it has these fabulous and complex pattern of the 9 Influencers called Navagraha, and 12 Zodiac signs and other features of astrology. But look at this area in the center, this is a door knob, which means you can open this. \n\nThis is also a very ancient temple, and because of time, you can now see the gaps between the door and the rest of the chamber. And look at these protruding circular knobs. I believe that if you rotate them in a particular pattern, just like the metal safe u saw, you can open this secret chamber in the ceiling of this temple. I mean clearly this is a door which leads to something. In ancient Indian temples, there are many many mysteries hidden in plain sight. We have not even started to understand them.  Now, let us look at one of the most iconic megalithic structures in the world Heritage site of Hampi. \n\nThis is a gigantic stone Chariot standing about 15 feet tall and 10 feet wide and weighs more than 120 tons. It is so awe-inspiring, it is even printed on Indian money. Even by conservative archeological accounts, it was built at least 500 years ago. But, In spite of being very popular among tourists, this Chariot remains shrouded in mystery. Google and Wikipedia give blatantly false information, for example Google calls this a monolithic chariot. If you examine this structure, you realize it is not Monolithic at all, it is not made of one stone. Look at how each wheel is made of a separate stone block and they are setup on the axles, like a real working chariot. The chariot appears to be not built as a decorative or religious structure. Rather, it is built like a real vehicle, made of several parts which are assembled together. I know this is a weird question to ask, but is it possible that this chariot has moving parts?"<br />Author: 'NapoleonAK'<br />id: 'gz2bfn'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>

<li>Title: "Justice for Bramsh Baloch, a very happy-go-lucky child, whose mother was murdered in cold blood in Balochistan by members of a local death squad, recruited by Pakistan's Military Intelligence. The 4 year old girl was severely wounded in the attack too."<br />Body: 'In a viral video which would haunt humanity for years to come, an inconsolable 4 year old is seen crying and repeating the same word again and again, "Amma" (mother). She\'s fresh out of surgery herself and hasn\'t got out of her hospital bed yet, but little does she know that her beloved "amma" can now never return.\n\nThis hapless child is little Bramsh Baloch, a native of Balochistan, whose mother, Malik Naz was murdered in cold blood for refusing to bow down to the evils of the militants backed by the Pakistani state. More than a week has passed, and the alleged leader of the squad is still "nowhere to be found". It has become routine for the Pakistani State to use the local death squad militants to rape, abduct and kill Baloch Political and Human Rights Activists.\n\nLittle Bramsh\'s story, however gave leeway to an online campaign, #JusticeForBramsh. Hundreds of people from from Balochistan and abroad participated in the campaign and demanded justice for the poor child. June 1 saw a large number of protestors gathering at Turbat city\'s "Shaheed Fida Chowk". On June 2, citizens of Washok and Bulaida rallied to question the provincial government. The port city of Gwadar also saw similar protests on May 30. Similar protests were announced in the capital city of Quetta on June 4.\n\nThe Internet and cellular services have been cut off in the capital city of Quetta since June 1. According to the locals, the Internet shutdown comes after another 23 year old Baloch man, Bilal Noorzai was brutally beaten to death by an angry mob of vigilantes . It is pertinent to mention that cellular services have been cut-off in the Panjur, Kech and Kalat districts of Balochistan for the past 5 years. Internet accessibility remains a major issue in Balochistan.\n\nI request all of you to help in spreading little Bramsh\'s story.\n\n#JucticeForBramsh\n https://www.opindia.com/2020/06/justice-for-bramsh-baloch-murder-pakistan-balochistan/amp/'<br />Author: 'huicups'<br />id: 'gywbo5'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion</li>
