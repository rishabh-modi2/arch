His credibility as a source of Pusthun history is beyond reproach. His exact quote is reproduced below with complete fidelity:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúThe Valour of Sikh Army during the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, under the leadership of the historically most ferocious General Hari Singh Nalwa came to the Frontier in the 1820\'s and swiftly conquered our ancestors. It is the only time in Recorded History that our people were ever ruled over by foreigners (Indians). The locals were so utterly terrified of the Sikh Army that they used to hide every time the Sikhs came into view. Those that decided to resist were met with utter ruthlessness. During this time, the word was spread around that the Sikhs Never harm elderly people, Women and Children and that the local men who did not wish to earn wrath of the Sikhs should wear the garb of Punjabi women, which was the Salwar-Kameez. At that time in our history both men and women alike, wore only a single-robe garment (similar to that worn by the Arabs) and the Gallant honourable Sikh\'s would not harm any man either  wearing a Salwar-Kameez.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo you see, our men happily adopted the garb of Punjabi women since they were too terrified to stand up and they have adopted the garb as being theirs\' ever since. I am very intrigued to see that you are following in the footsteps of your ancestors by wearing the adopted Punjabi women\'s garb as your own, but now go around preaching and coercing our women as to how they should be living their lives! I suggest that take a deep look inside yourselves, given this historical perspective."\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease see the following references for corrobaration:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNalwa, V. 2009.

We cheered our heroes (Medical Staff, Police, etc) and were looking forward to flatening the curve.\n\nOur collective anger was directed at China. On twitter I could see Indians taking the lead in roasting the shit out of China. From thinkers of various think tanks to the common man, everyone contributed in driving the narrative against the Chinese on the social media.\n\nAnd then Tabligi Jamaat happened. And all our anger, that was directed outwards got directed inwards. The curve that was about get straightened gained a lot of gradient. The India that seemed united, even for brief, got divided once again, with infighting within the nation. \n\nAll of this doesn't help but make me think what if India was indeed a Hindu Rastra. What if we had muslims but not in the same proportion as we have now. After all, 90% of all Muslims in India at the time before partition demanded for a separate state. Who indeed thought it was a good idea to provide them a separate state, and also have them have a say in a Hindu majority country which eventually had to become a secular country.\n\nI can't help but think where we would have been without this infighting we have had for so many years. How much at peace we would have felt? how wonderfully we would have cooperated with our heroes at different critical times throughout our post independence history.\n\nI am pretty sure, Muslims too who are currently in India, if they had a Muslim majority country to live in, would have felt more comfortable practicing their customs and religion, and not be under scrutinity  of others. In 1947, Jinnah was right and he provided what was needed by his supporters and Gandhi and Nehru were wrong. Even after dividing Bharat into pieces which broke our hearts, we the supporters still ended up living with the problems that caused the partition. \n\nIn order for India to ever have a chance of becoming a superpower, we must be outward looking with very less internal infighting. But given the current demographic situation in India, we will never be able to do that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the rant.

My wife faces daily discrimination as she cannot wear a burka when she goes outside.\n\n Let me tell you about this incident\nA few days ago, my wife was not feeling well. She told me and I understood she wanted to go to the doctor. So I teamed up with my other wife to take her to the doctor. Because she couldn't wear Burkha, people started looking at my beloved wife like it was some bizzare sight. Fuck these bhakts.i finally understood why women should wear Burkhas. It is to protect them from these perverts. I became a greater believer in my ideology. I brought her to the local clinic and they told me to go to the Vet. What the fuck is meant by Vet? I do not understand how Endians make up such weird stuff. So the doctors refused treatment for my wife because he was an Islamophobe. I got angry and asked someone nearby where is the nearest Vet. They showed me the way. He looked like a kafir but Kafirs can never help others. He is a bulla in disguise I am sure. So I went to the Vet and found it was filled with more people like me. My wife immediately took a liking in the crowd and started talking to the other wives. Meanwhile some bhakts brought their cows over there. They are such idiots. Does it look like a clinic for cows? My wife also wanted to break free of her ropes but we didn't allow that because we respect women's rights. The doctor there was nice. He gave some medications and told me to come to him again in a few weeks. \n\nAfter 2 weeks I wanted to take her for a final checkup. I wanted to decrease the sexism about my wife and believed in my religion. So I forcefully made her wear a Burkha. But to my horror, these Sanghi Perverts started looking at my wife even more. Fuck you RSS. But the doctor told everything was OK and I breathed a sign of relief. \n\nSo I wanted my wife to vote. It is important for women to vote, right? I will vote only for Kejruddin and no one else. But the Sanghi Government told me that my wife cannot vote. They also told that I was retarded. You see how much discrimination we face daily because of Modi? He is not letting women to vote. \n\nMy brother told me to go to Mamta didi's place so she can get a Voter Id. \nBut can I get a Voter Id without an Aadhar card? \nAlso my wife ate all my Kagaz so I couldn't find our aadhar cards or birth certificates. What should I do?"<br />Author: 'Styeyr'<br />id: 'g1q9eu'<br />Flair :Randia Simulation</li><li>Title: 'Bhagwapill update, Lockdown Day 22. Successfully Bhagwapilled 3 Librandus. They are virats now.'<br />Body: 'The only thing truth needs, is a spark of inquiry.\n\nEdit: Here\'s how I usually go about it. I have recognized that most of the librandus are well meaning people who wish the best for the world they live in. All humans form their world views on concepts, concepts build on more concepts and form stories and narratives. If you change the definition, or understanding of a concept in someone\'s head, you can change their world view.\n\nMost of these guys hate \'hindutva\', and they should, because the concept of Hindutva as told to them by the media they are exposed to is incorrect, and we will fight with them because we understand hindutva differently. So, I explain them this fundamental part of human nature and get them to agree on it. Once they understand that different definitions/understanding of the same concept leads to conflict, you strike in by challenging the foundations of their cultural identity, their world view. This statement helps\n\n&gt;"Hindu is a geographical, civilisational identity, it is not a religious identity"  \nMake it possible for them to understand that hindu muslim is a valid identity. Do the same thing, tell them what a religion is, and whatever hindus do isn\'t religious. \n\nAt some point they might say that historical contexts don\'t matter anymore, that they aren\'t religious or cultural and to them only material developments matter. Infra, economy, etc. Tell them cultural development needs to go hand in hand, and then make this point which is fairly balanced and should make them reconsider. The gist is summarised in a comment of mine :  \n\n\n&gt;So there are two schools of thoughts.   \nIndividualism,  where you live only for yourself and thus your history is only the  memory that you have experienced. This memory is needed for you to drive  ahead otherwise you\'ll be lost on the street it you have no idea who  you are, where you\'re coming from, and why did you even step out. So  memory is important.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Now, a civilization is a super organism, made of us organisms like us humans. And history is the memory of this civilisation.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Second  school of thought is that I\'m part of this culture, I can think because  I\'ve been taught language and fed and brought up safe. And so I\'ll see  myself as part of the culture.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Two  different lenses. Now if you look at Delhi riots, you don\'t know  history, you will rationalise it as anger, lack of education, etc.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I  know history, I have more information, more data points and there are  patterns that emerge out in this universe. So I understand the cause  better, with much more depth.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You  can choose to live for yourself, it\'s one of the many ways to live but  then you lose the right, and the moral ground to speak on the behalf of  civilisational. You shouldn\'t even speak about architectures. Anything  etc.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If you want to take a stand  on civilisation, you need to first understand it, and that it by reading  history, the memory of the civilisation.  \n\n\nMake them understand how unemployment is a consequence of history, and not a random whack a mole problem that appears once in a while. You have to convince them to respect history, to search for the true meaning behind this outer identity they wear ("Indian"). If you are able to help them realise, even as a momentary spark that their concept, or understanding of India is completely wrong and is based on the narratives of breaking India forces, give them some time to do research.  \n\n\nThis has worked for me in 3 cases, 2 ongoing and failed in 1, some people just don\'t want to be part of a civilisation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;'<br />Author: 'sharmaji_ka_dost'<br />id: 'g1pfd8'<br />Flair :Bakchod News</li><li>Title: '(Asking for a friend) Any pics of Madrassas celebrating Ambedkar Jayanti?'<br />Body: 'My friend wants to use it to shout "Jai Bheem Jai Meem".'<br />Author: 'TorontoArgonaut'<br />id: 'g1pd0n'<br />Flair :Shitpost</li><li>Title: 'Tera naam toh bata Abdoool Abdoool'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'g1oyw4'<br />Flair :High IQ</li><li>Title: 'Lol got banned from Randia for this'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'g1osv6'<br />Flair :Rant</li><li>Title: 'ooo yeah!'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'g1ofzb'<br />Flair :WhatsApp Forward</li><li>Title: 'The Westerners obsession with Trump is mind-blowing.'<br />Body: "They talk about him 24X7.

Sharma, Satish Chandra, Bipan Chandra‚Äï *NCERT History Books\' (the prescribed textbooks for CBSE schools) primary authors with independent academic works of their own, all using the Marxist Approach of viewing History with the lenses of socioeconomic interaction between "oppressor and the oppressed".*\n\n\n\n\n2)  Romila Thapar, Irfan Habib‚Äï *NCERT Supporting Historians of the above three with independent works of their own, writing from a Marxist approach which completely denounces schools which view Indian History from a "communal viewpoint", that is as a conflict between Hindus and Muslims.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3)  RC Majumdar‚Äî *The lone historian writing from a somewhat nationalistic point of view, who holds that it\'s impossible not to see Indian history with a "communal" lens, seeing as how religion was often a driving factor between both the invasions and the subsequent treatment of the invaded. His 11 volume magnum-opus, which took 26 years to complete, captures the entire history of India from prehistoric times till it\'s independence.* \n\n\n\n\nIt\'s little surprise then, that our kids grow up with a colonial hangover being sympathetic to the very people who invaded and destroyed large swathes of the indigenous culture.\n\nSo what should RW Indians who want history to be shown from the "right side" do??\n\nThe obvious answer would be to encourage more and more right leaning people to get into arts and humanities (which is dominated by left leaning ones the world over), and change the entire system from within. While that\'s certainly the long term aim, we can make do with what\'s on our hand for the time being too. \n\nMost of the above marxist historians, despite having heavily "anti-nationalistic/hindu" overtones, do have their moments where they mildly or even strongly espouse patriotic/pro "dhƒÅrmic" ideas.\n\nWhile Romila Thapar views Aurangzeb as a "gentleman", her debunking of the myth of Buddhist persecution at the hands of Hindus, as often alleged by radical Ambedkarites, is noteworthy and is well backed by archaeological and literary sources.\n\nSimilarly, Bipan Chandra has often downplayed the atrocities committed by the Muslim rulers of the 17the/18th century and even offered apologetic justifications foe violence in the case of rulers like Tipu Sultan of Mysore. However, he is pretty patriotic when it comes to the Indian struggle for independence against the British, never once lapsing into *British colonialism was good for India* mode. \n                                      This is in stark contrast to RC Majumdar who, while being staunchly nationalistic when writing about ancient and medieval India , falls in the camp of "colonialism wasn\'t as bad as it\'s made out to be" in his writings on the struggle against the British.\n\nWhile a complete historical ~~revisionism~~ correction is the only permanent solution to rid our coming generations of the insecurity and self hatred √† la randians, we (as in our generation) can make do with what has been done so far too, if only we learn to glean the "cash" from the "trash".'<br />Author: 'TerryMcGinnis1999'<br />id: 'g1nyso'<br />Flair :Research</li><li>Title: 'A victim of Rubbish Kumar Report'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'g1nmob'<br />Flair :Low Effort</li><li>Title: 'Why is Ramayan in fantasy genre ?

I failed miserably, thinking about why, makes me realise that i have been making anti muslim memes, reading anti muslim comments for a long time now, which also makes me think that i have lost my creativity and sense of humour.\n\nIts very high time that we need to understand.\n\n# Muslims are not our enemies.\n\nOur enemies are those Jaichand hindus, those liberandu jerks, propagandists like Kunal Kamra, Anurag Kashyap. Weather you agree with me or not, but the history is proof that many wars have been lost, many people have died only due to these people. They work on the ideology of\n\n ***Phoot dalo Raj karo***\n\nWhile we are making memes on muslims they are establishing false narratives about India and Hindus around the world. We say us viraat but no we aren't. Sorry to say but talking about being united and strong on the Internet doesn't make you strong ion real life. Don't be offended and think, if I am organising a protest against the government for the wrong and biased education provided the education system, how many of you viraat will come forward? how many of you will leave their comfort zones and join the protests? Not more than 10%,.\n\nHave you seen the interview of the girl who was saying Pakistan Zindabad in Owaisi rally? How proudly she admits that there is a gang working behind her a team of experts who advises her and others to do things like that. That clearly show how slowly they our making the students like them, using them for the propaganda right under our nose.\n\nPlease give it a thought,\n\n* The knowledge being given to the school children\n* The ancient history being altered by Islamic scholars and historians\n* Organisations like RSS, VHP being given terrorist label\n* False anti India propaganda by biased and paki funded journalist, \n* The protests and the ideologies spread  by universities like Jamia Milia and JNU\n* Parties like PFI, people like Kanahiya Kumar being given the right to fight elections\n\nDoesn't these concern you?\n\nNow some will say we have elected Modi and he will manage all these things, Don't you see the how Modi is a fascist Hindu supremacist in the eyes of people around the world(except Japan,Israel and Russia). TO stop the growth of muslims refugees he brought up CAA, what happened? Shaheen Bagh? Riots? India as a racist country around the world? \n\nYou may say that it doesn't matter what the world thinks about India, we don't need gora validation . And that's okay on a personal level, but here is the problem, we cant think above the personal level. please put your ego aside for a minute and think about it.\n\nIf just bringing a bill which stops Muslim Immigration in India can cause this much havoc in India? How much will a Population Control Law for muslims will?\n\n Now coming to Hindu rashtra,What does it exactly mean?\n\n1. It means that Muslims cannot marry 4 wives and give birth to many children. Maximum 2 kids with only one wife.\n2. Mass and Illegal Christian conversions are banned. Scheduled Caste people who converted to Christianity will lose their SC Status and all the benefits, Ever heard of Sunni-Christian? or Catholic Muslim? No. Then what is Dalit Christian? Same is the case with OBC, ST or even 10% reservations to OC. Such benefits are exclusively for followers of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism or Sikhism.\n3. If a Hindu girl/woman marries a Muslim guy/man, then the boy/man must convert to Hinduism. Also, if a Muslim girl/woman marries a Hindu boy then the girl/woman has to convert to Hinduism. Their kids will be Hindus for sure.\n4. Hindi will not be imposed on India at all. Sanskrit is the Mother of all our Languages and Hindi will not be forced.\n5. Manusmriti is not a book related to Hindu Religion and is not a holy book of Hindus. It is related to Society. Ramayana, Mahabharata, Bhagavad Gita and The Vedas are either from God (Word of God) or related to God. Manusmriti was shown as Word of God and OBC SC STs were discriminated for 2,000 years. At any cost, Manusmriti will not be followed and there will be no discrimination of any kind towards OBC SC STs who are Hindus in The Hindu Rashtra.\n6. The ultimate aim of becoming Hindu Rashtra is peace and no physical attacks/lynchings of Minorities will be tolerated. We are not going to become another Pakistan. Law and Order will not be compromised at any cost.\n7. Any attempts to change the demographics of the country, especially Religion wise is strictly punishable and Hindus will remain 80% of the Indian Population all the time. It‚Äôs the only Nation we have and there‚Äôs no choice.\n8. The political scenario after becoming Hindu Rashtra will be democracy only. No question of monarchy at all. But, it will be similar to Pakistan in this particular case. The main purpose of Muslim League was to establish a Muslim Nation during Independence. Today, that party is not in power in Pakistan. It simply means that, whoever comes to power in Pakistan will not try to change the fundamental of Pakistan as an Islamic Republic. It is an Islamic Democracy. Similarly, India will become a Vedic Democracy. Probably Aam Aadmi Party will form the government in centre after some years due to it‚Äôs development agenda, but India will still remain Official Hindu State. All the above rules will be implemented. No ifs and buts.\n\nDo you think Modi can implement these?\n\nThe only way we can fight such anti India anti Hindu forces are by becoming united more than ever, I government takes any step for the welfare and the making of a Hindu Rashtra. We nedd to support them but this support should not be like abusing anyone on social media but by coming out of our comfort zones and do more than that. \n\nHere's is what we can do:\n\n* Stop making memes and videos ***only*** about Muslims\n* Librandus Commies and should be our enemies, they can destroy the country by their double standards.\n* Targeted memes on those journalists who are anti India and Anti Hindu.\n* Support the Right Wing creators more and more by sharing their work.\n* Make being a Hindu look cool, what i mean by that is listening to Hindi Bhakti songs, wearing traditional Indian outfits, doing pooja, worshipping, reading our ancient literature, should not be considered shameful or old school, first, it will be hard, but don't stop. \n\nThere are 18k people on this sub, only if 3-4k of them do what i have suggested, can bring big changes.\n\nUnlike Instagram and Twitter, Reddit is the platform where we can actually bring change. ALSO,  we have to stop fighting with the librandu jerks on these platforms, this only give them attention, its very hard that you will make them understand. Please consider these suggestions, educate more and more people about these, This is the only way we can save our culture.\n\nAs more and more youngsters are getting attracted to the western culture, and forgetting their own we have to do something to preserve the essence of Sanatan Dharma in them. \n\nThat was my   **‡§Ü‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ö‡§ø‡§Ç‡§§‡§®**  for today after I failed making a good meme about the pseudo secular people.

Dyer carried out the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar, Punjab.  Even the arch-imperialist Winston Churchill condemned it as a  ‚Äúmonstrous event, an event which stood in singular and sinister  isolation‚Äù.\n\nBut, General Dyer and Michael O‚ÄôDwyer (who was subsequently shot by Udham Singh) had admirers in Bharat as well. The prominent name in the list was none other than Dewan Bahadur Kunj Behari Thapar of Lahore.   \n\n\nKaran Thapar belongs to the Thapar clan, which was among the elite of  undivided Punjab and then New Delhi, with connections to the  Nehru-Gandhi family for decades. Karan Thapar‚Äôs paternal grandfather was  Diwan Bahadur Kunj Behari Thapar. He belonged to a section of the  Punjabi elite that came into new wealth as commission agents for the  colonial British Indian Army.  \n \n\nKunj Behari Thapar was also one  of four people, including Umar Hayat Khan, Chaudhary Gajjan Singh and  Rai Bahadur Lal Chand, who donated Rs 1.75 lakh to the fund of Punjab  governor Sir Michael O‚ÄôDwyer ‚Äî the man who backed the actions of  Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer during the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.  For his loyalty to the British, Karan Thapar‚Äôs grand father, Kunj Behari  Thapar was also awarded the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire  in 1920.  \n \n\nKaran Thapar‚Äôs mother is Bimla Bashiram, sister of  Gautam Sahgal, whose wife Nayantara Sahgal was the daughter of  Vijayalakshmi Pandit and niece of Jawaharlal Nehru. Thus, Karan Thapar‚Äôs  aunt is Nayantara Sahgal (now infamous for being the first of the award  wapsi gang). Nayantara Sahgal got divorced from Gautam Sahgal in 1967.  But the relations between the Thapar family and the Nehru dynasty still  remains strong today.  \n \n\nDue to the family connection, Chacha  Nehru, against advice by General Thimaya, promoted Karan Thapar‚Äôs  father, General Pran Nath Thapar as Chief of Army Staff of the Indian  Army ahead of two generals that were senior to him. Thapar took over in  1961 and served until 19 November 1962. He was the only Indian Army  chief in history to lose a war, against China in 1962, forcing him to  resign in disgrace in November that year. Anyone that was disgraced in  such a fashion would have been relegated to the dustbin of history.  However, due to his Nehru family connection, he was allowed to serve as  the Indian ambassador to Afghanistan from 1964 until 1969.  \n \n\nIn  spite of the brother‚Äôs (General Pran Nath Thapar) ignominious exit from  the Indian army, Karan Thapar‚Äôs uncle, Daya Ram Thapar, who worked as a  doctor in the Indian military, somehow managed to get himself promoted  to the position of Director-General of the Indian Armed Forces Medical  Services. This was largely thanks to the family‚Äôs connection to the  Nehru dynasty.  \n \n\nKaran Thapar‚Äôs cousin, [\\#Romila\\_Thapar](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/romila_thapar?epa=HASHTAG)  worked as Professor of Ancient Indian History at the Jawaharlal Nehru  University, New Delhi. Known for her extreme left-leaning views, she has  derided Hinduism at every given opportunity under the premise of  ‚Äúexposing ancient truths‚Äù. She is an advocate of whitewashing the  horrors of Islamic invasions and the Mughal rule in India. She proposed  to dismiss the fact that India had a Golden age has always downplayed  the achievements of the great Indian kingdoms: Maurya, Gupta, Chalukya,  Rashtrakutas, Cholas, Chandelas, Vijayanagar kingdoms, etc as they hurt  her disgust for anything that can give rise to national pride in  Indians. She wants to de-emphasize such portions of history in the name  of opposing Hindutva etc, as if she is some kind of final judgment on  what is counted as history and what is not.  \n \n\nKaran Thapar‚Äôs  other cousin, Romesh Thapar (born in Lahore) was a famous loony liberal  writer and commentator and belonged to the Communist party of India. As  is typical of Indian communists, he lived a comfortable life in his  upmarket flat (in the Breach Candy neighborhood in Mumbai), but churned  out pages and pages of communist material for magazines. Always proud of  calling himself a friend of freedom, he vigorously applauded the  discipline and efficiency of family chum Indira Gandhi‚Äôs emergency  period of dictatorship and appreciated that many communist agendas, such  as forcible and irreversible birth control operations to limit  population growth, were enforced. He died in 1987.  \n \n\nNot many  people know that he was a close friend of Sanjay Gandhi and never  worried about the excesses of emergency in spite of posing as a friend  of freedom. Karan Thapar‚Äôs sister [\\#Shoba](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/shoba?epa=HASHTAG) used to be Sanjay Gandhi‚Äôs girlfriend for a short while and it was she who introduced her brother to Sanjay.  \n \n\n Karan Thapar‚Äôs wife was Nisha Jean √Ålvares Meneses who died of cancer.  She was of Goan descent and Karan Thapar converted to Christianity to  marry her.  \n \n\nKaran Thapar was a classmate of Benazir Bhutto at  Oxford University and maintained very cordial relations with her until  her death and still maintains a close relationship with her husband,  Asif Ali Zardari.  \n \n\nIn 2017, Karan Thapar wrote an article named  "The mysterious of Mr. Jadhav" in regard to death sentence given to Mr  Kulbhushan Yadav, an alleged Indian spy who was imprisoned in Pakistan.  This article embarrassed India Internationally. But Mr. Thapar, a  self-serving, life-long admirer of Pakistan has never been one to shy  away from embarrassing India in any way he can so as to build up his  profile as a great Jeremy Paxman-like figure.  \n \n\nKaran Thapar is  just another sickular icon from a typical loony liberal family, whose  members have all succeeded and lived a life of luxury thanks to their  family connections.  \n \n\n[https://theprint.in/lutyens-league/why-is-karan-thapar-complaining-his-dynasty-holds-a-key-to-lutyenss-delhi/87308/](https://theprint.in/lutyens-league/why-is-karan-thapar-complaining-his-dynasty-holds-a-key-to-lutyenss-delhi/87308/?fbclid=IwAR3RwEpXmdgW6GpGzVUJRgW7jhOVIdb6TZHxGqQHe7VSH9vduDeTl2qBhuA)'<br />Author: 'Tumharabaap786'<br />id: 'g0xxbw'<br />Flair :Copypasta</li><li>Title: 'PERSIANS INDIANS AND ARABS UNITE'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'g0uy6e'<br />Flair :From Twitter</li><li>Title: "Maybe it's time for a new step"<br />Body: "We should ask for legalization of marijuana.

On one occasion, a secret gift of Rs 2 million from the Politburo to the Congress was personally delivered by the KGB head in India Leonid Shebarshin. Another million rupees were given on the same occasion to a newspaper supporting Mrs Gandhi.\n\nIn 1978, the KGB was running over 30 agents in India, 10 of whom were Indian intelligence officers.\n\nIn 1977, KGB files identified 21 non communist politicians (four union ministers) whose election campaigns were subsidised by the KGB.\n\nThe CPI was funded in many ways, including transfer of money through car windows on Delhi roads.\n\nIn 1959, CPI general-secretary Ajoy Ghosh agreed on a plan to found an import-export business for trade with the Soviet bloc. In little more than a decade its annual profits grew to over Rs 3 million.\n\nDuring 1975, a total of 10.6 million roubles was spent on active measures in India designed to strengthen the support for Mrs Gandhi and undermine her political opponents.\n\nV. Krishna Menon, as defence minister, was persuaded to buy Soviet MiGs and not British Lightnings. His election campaigns in 1962 and 1967 were funded by the KGB.\n\nBy 1973, the KGB had 10 Indian newspapers on its payroll plus a press agency. During 1975 the KGB planted 5,510 articles in Indian newspapers.\n\nPromode Dasgupta, the communist stalwart, was identified by the KGB as an Intelligence Bureau informant in the Indian communist movement.'<br />Author: 'zealofsingh'<br />id: 'g0gfc5'<br />Flair :High IQ</li><li>Title: 'A humble petition to ban u/Volatilewalker'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'achilles298'<br />id: 'g0fzmn'<br />Flair :Rant</li><li>Title: 'Pandavon ki jeet pakki.
