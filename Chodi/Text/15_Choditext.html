Moreover, India might have an interest in making its nuclear capabilities known to ‚Äúenemies.‚Äù Whatever the Indians decided, external pressure would have no impact on a highly nationalist state and society: ‚Äúwe see nothing US or international community can presently do to influence GOI policy directions in atomic field.‚Äù  \nOne of the sources mentioned, apparently a CIA asset (the reference is excised), had a connection with the Prime Minister‚Äôs secretariat. This may be the same informant, future Prime Minister **Moraji Desai,** who provided information to the CIA about Prime Minister Gandhi‚Äôs intentions during the recent South Asian crisis and whose cover was subsequently blown through press leaks published by Jack Anderson.

<li>Title: '[Note: Mature Content] A question regarding which there have been countless debates and arguments: Did Ravan have sex with Sita in Lanka after he abducted her?'<br />Body: "So this is quite a controversial topic, considering it's about one of the major characters of the ancient epic Ramayan by Valmiki, and involves a lot of sexuality.\n\nHistorians and writers who've explored the Ramayan have almost always avoided this subject, which isn't surprising at all, since most Indians are still uncomfortable about sexuality even to this day. Since the text in question is the Ramayan, it only makes sense for annalists to gloss over this segment of the goddess Sita's abduction and enslavement in Lanka.\n\nWhile it may be open for debate, the fact remains that, according to Valmiki's Ramayan, Sita indeed engaged in sexual intercourse with her captor. Although Valmiki does not provide any details or particulars regarding the extent of her physical relations with Ravan, there is an *explicit* description of sex between the two characters. Furthermore, there are quite a few references to this incident by various characters of the epic, such as Jatayu, Hanuman, Mandodhari, and Sita herself. The amount of dispute on Ravan and Sita being involved in such a scandalous affair is akin to the dispute on whether or not Draupadi was dragged to the Kuru Sabha. To sum it all up, I believe there's a high probability that Ravan did have sex with Sita(which was non-consensual, of course.)\n\nI would like to begin a discussion on this point, and know what different opinions members of this subreddit could possibly have on it.\n\n(Warning: if this question disturbs you, please do not engage and stay away. There's enough controversy already, we don't need more.)"<br />Author: 'TanatanDonut'<br />id: 'mhtczo'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
<li>Title: "*Posting this on request from my personal archive. I wrote this critique of Mahua Moitra's 14 sign of fascism speech in LS at that time. It was a long time back. So excuse my underwhelming and somewhat unsound response. Also it was mainly intended for librandu audience. So keep that in mind."<br />Body: 'Deconstruction: The Mahua Moitra Chapter  \n \\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nNothing beats a cup of chai or a cup of black coffee or a thought  provoking battle of narrative. I find truth in every narrative, and  lies, and the logical fallacies attached with it. The inherent nature of  setting a narrative is based on some assumption, some pre-conceived  notions and some agendas. Not only I welcome every voice, but I actually  like to see it gets its due respect. But the problem arises when I see  only the truth is recognised but the lies and the fallacies goes  unnoticed. It creates a new set of "Bhakts".  \n \n\nRecently the  speech of Mahua Moitra in LS has garnered a lot of buzz. I consider it  very healthy for democracy and I welcome it when I saw it the first  time. But seeing people are going gaga over this I thought I should  bring out the fallacies I noticed.  \n \n\nFirst of all, shouting does not make your case and  point, your arguments do. Now let‚Äôs go and break down the arguments  point by point.  \n \n\nIntroduction:  \n "Constitution is under  threat" - is not backed by any example. Just going with the confirmation  bias that is present in mainstream media. Just check how many  constitutional amendment bills have been presented in the house in last  five years and how many got mandate from opposition as well. A case of  circular argument.  \n Carefully choosing words - "The sun will never  set on this Indian empire that the government is seeking to build" -  trying to draw analogy from British Empire.   \n \n\n1. "Powerful and  continuing nationalism" - uses adjective like \'superficial\',  \'xenophobic\' and \'narrow\' and links it with Nationalism, which I find  problematic, although, I agree with the argument about NRC.  \n Also I agree that there cannot be one slogan, one symbol for the diversity that India has.   \n  But Indian Nationalism is different from western construct. Just like  the State and Nation-state in Europe, where Nation-state has a broader  connotation, India has the Concept of Rajya and Rashtra. The Republic of  India is "Bharat Ganarajya" (Check your Passport), which is defined by  the border, emblem, flag etc. But the Rashtra of India is broader than  the Republic of India. Heck even the emblem is a symbol of \'Ashokan  State\' not of \'Kautilyan State\'. It encapsulates the cultural and  historical idea of Bharat.  \n \n\n2. Disdain for human Rights  violation: She mentions that there is 10X increase of hate crime from  2014 and 2019. I am not sure where she got this data from. I don‚Äôt think  there is any profiling of criminal case based on hate crime. I do not  know what IPC or CRPC sections could be classified as hate crimes. This  seems to be a case of hyperbole and Hasty Generalisation. Please give me  an authentic source of information where this claim can be  substantiated. I am willing to reconsider my position.  \n She mentions  Pehlu Khan to Ansari. Now there are few other incidents that she is  missing. I can give you a list of 50 cases where the victim is not from  minority community. So this is clearly a Law and Order issue, which is a  state subject. Instead of voicing for police reform she is giving it a  communal colour.   \n Instead of talking about what police reform could  be facilitated she is implying it is a case of communal violence. A case  of Appeal to Pity.  \n It is not that all hell broke in 2014 and people  started lynching. It is a law and order issue which needs to be fixed  ASAP. And why would you do that? After all out of the 545+245 members of  both the houses of parliament, probably 100+ are out on bail and 200+  have criminal case registered against them. Who would axe their own  feet?  \n \n\n3. Controlling mass media:  \n 5 of this media house is  directly or indirectly controlled by one man in this country. She does  not mention who this person is, but that is Ok.   \n TV channels played  propaganda for the ruling party. You mean both Namo TV and ABP Ananda,  right? Just like those unreported riots that were influenced  politically, right?  \n She is asking for ad spent per media house.  Which is good enough argument. I think we all agree with that. Now would  you support the demand for bringing the National Parties under RTI?  Would you support the same argument for the political parties? Let\'s not  form a smog and create an illusion of making a good argument. I don‚Äôt  have problem with the points that have been raised, rather I have  problem with people calling you a good debater. Don\'t worry, I am not  going into nitty-gritty of what you do in a debate. That would be Ad  hominem on my part.  \n Now let‚Äôs come to the point that 120+ people are  recruited for I&amp;B Ministry, whose job is solely to check the  contents of TV every day. Now, as per my knowledge, I&amp;B ministry is  mainly responsible for running only government channels, i.e., LSTV,  RSTV AIR News etc. My information might be wrong. But content is subject  matter of each individual private media. And even in Government  channel, there are coverage for all significant parties. Have you ever  even watched a government channel? Have you ever watched the debates  conducted on RSTV? Let\'s talk about facts, not  assumption. You are going all Strawman over this topic.  \n Election was  fought on fake news and Whatsapp. Telling a lie a thousand times and it  becomes truth. Gabble doctrine. Again false equivalence drawn between  Hitler and current regime. Now please madam, decide what do you want to  call this legislative body out for? For being a imperialist Britain or  Fascist Germany? However I understand the point you are trying to make.   \n  36 Dynasts of Congress vs. 31 of BJP. That is a party wise tally, I  should not get into that. But this is what I like about BJP and CPIM.  Both the party has cadre system. Anyone can work their way up and reach  the top position. Not in congress I guess. It also seems that in future  AITC will turn into a dynastic party. And there is a difference between  "MP ka beta MP" and "PM ka beta PM".  \n \n\n4. National Security: Fear  pervading everywhere. Kalabhoot? Where is this argument going madam? It  is going all red herring. You mentioned 106% increase of death of Army  Jawans in J&amp;K. Now is the data based on Year on Year basis? Or based  on 5 years term? I also think that is possible given 44 Jawans died in  Pulwama and several other incidents but please specify the details. What  have you done to co-operating when action is needed? What are your  stand on cross border human trafficking, Cattle smuggling in Bengal  border? WB ranks number one in girl child trafficking. Why are you not  pressuring Central Government to fix porous border? Why are you not  improving Law and Order situation in WB? Who is stopping you? Why don‚Äôt  you file a PIL to SC if the Central government is not cooperating? Get a  mandate from SC and pressurise the government. 22 MP seats are good  enough to disrupt LS in case you are really willing to work.  \n  Religion and government has already been intertwined. If you don‚Äôt  agree, go read Article 30 of Constitution, Hindu Marriage Act, Muslim  Personnel Law to name a few. It is a shame that instead of being  \'secular\' country, India still has separate civil law based on religion.  You forgot to mention Article 44 of the Constitution of India.  \n \n\n 5. You said that only one community is targeted via Anti-Immigration  law. First of all, it is not anti-immigration law, it is Citizenship  Amendment Act. You are twisting words just to inflate the gravity of the  situation.   \n Now what does the Citizenship Amendment Act says? It  says that is applies for prosecuted Religious Minority of Pakistan,  Afghanistan and Bangladesh. What are the provision? It is just that the  norms for citizenship for these prosecuted minorities are a bit relaxed.  It does not prosecute minorities of India.   \n And let‚Äôs not confuse  between NRC and Citizenship Amendment Bill. NRC pact was signed between  Rajiv Gandhi and Assam Students Union in 1985.  \n I guess you have some  confusion over Ram Mandir Land and rest of India. While Ram Mandir land  is Nationalised land, govt has yet kept this for consideration of SC so  that democratic right of all the concerned parties can have a voice.  What security do you want? Law and Order or Border Security? Govt is  trying enough to strengthen Border security. What are you doing to  strengthen Law and Order situation?  \n \n\n6. Disdain for  Intellectuals and art. O ho ho ho ho! Let\'s not even dig an inch deeper  what happens in the field of intellectual and art. Let‚Äôs not try to link  who\'s who in there. Who is whose cousin, brother, sister, father,  mother, husband etc., who is patronised by whom. Let‚Äôs not try to find  out how and why historians like RC Majumdar was side-lined. Let‚Äôs not  argue how curriculum and historical perception has changed since  independence. Just go and check NCERT Secondary History text books how  many time Netaji was mentioned.  \n \'Secondary school textbook are  manipulated\'. First of all, that is a blatant and white lie. Last  amendment was done during UPA rule.   \n I agree with you that there is a  severe crisis of research facility. Where government is keen on  investing only on space, defence, We need a massive infrastructure and  huge funding on RnD. Without strong RnD facility we will remain  dependent upon foreign countries in matters of modern technologies. Just  merely mentioning Lack of Scientific Temperament does not provide a  solution.   \n \n\n7. Erosion of independence of EC: Government has  introduced EVM, VVPAT. Have invited political parties to come and try to  figure out if there is any flaw in the machine. And about the  independence of EC, I cannot help you if you are deliberately blind to  the actions EC took against parties other than yours, or ruling party  for the matter.  \n \n\nWe have thousands and thousands of \'experts\'  who can criticise, censure the actions of governments, but very few can  provide constructive criticism and alternative mode of governance. I  would like you to see as a responsible MP and provide constructive  argument on how the government should work. Merely pointing fingers can  produce a lot of fan boys and fan girls, but that ultimately contributes  nothing to the society.'<br />Author: 'Straight_Razor007'<br />id: 'mhrmdk'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

It may surprise you to know that the origin of the phrase \'Bhosadike\' is, in fact, an ancient Sanskrit greeting.\n\n"‡§≠‡•ã ‡§∏‡§¶‡•ç ‡§á‡§ï‡•á?" meaning, "Sir, are you well?"\n\nat is a term used for respectful greeting.

<li>Title: "Question to ask a Muslim : Do you think it's wise to financially plan ahead before having a child and decide to not have children temporarily or permanently if you know your financial situation is very very bad?"<br />Body: 'That\'s haram!\n\nThe "no money" thing is an actual part of their belief system (atleast for some imams, worth telling the Muslims you know that many of their beloved, knowledgeable, scholars think this way)\n\nMuslims may not know this but it\'s a fairly common view - in particular amongst the "Salafis" (admittedly it\'s not explicit in their scripture, but it\'s not unheard of)\n\nAccording to these scholars: It\'s actually forbidden for you to NOT have children because of financial considerations. Like that\'s not a valid reason to stop breeding. You can stop breeding if you just feel you\'re busy or you have health issues right now or basically any other reason but it\'s haram to decide not to have kids because you feel you can\'t financially support them. The idea is that Allah provides provisions.\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MF8Ep5pELr4\n\n\nhttps://islamqa.info/en/answers/10033/he-wants-to-limit-having-children-because-he-is-poor\n\n\nI know - it\'s patently dumb, very stupid üòÇ just watch the video though (relevant bit is in the end), that\'s from a very famous scholar (Yasir Qadhi). Ironically he\'s considered a mordernist and a reformer haha.\n\n\nThese dumfuks made financial planning haram.\n\n\nSource - I\'m an ex-muslim, trust me, it sounds VERY stupid but this what donee imams believe. Most Muslims don\'t know this, so they\'ll probably think it\'s crazy. \n\n\nDo this, ask a Muslim what they think about financial planning wrt having children in general and whether it\'s good/bad. then ask them if they think their religion allows it - they\'ll think it does. Post that quote the scholars above and watch them squirm, they\'ll be forced to throw their tradition under the bus, which is good - it\'s always a win when a Muslim gets skeptical of "big scholars"'<br />Author: 'throwawaythemoid'<br />id: 'mgcgdp'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'My Xperiences as a kalu mallu hindu'<br />Body: "I've lived in 10+ cities, 4 continents. So here's some rough generalization. Take it with a grain of  anecdotal salt and dont crucify me. \n\nIn India - \n\n- non religious tambrahms in TN have been dicks to me. traditional ones are either avoidant or extremely considerate plus trust worthy, westernized returnees even better. Exposure better? \n\n\n- apolitical urduwoodified North indians and East Indians have been dicks to me except the right wing ones or the liberal westernized returnees of pre woke era. When I say north I only mean BIMAU and exclude pahadi mountains, Rajasthan, northeasterners and western coastline. Bengali ones are fucking cowardly sleazy and snobbish even if they have returned from the west and even while in the west. Bangladeshi or Assami hindus are okay. Hope Modi delivers a vaccine to them.\n\n\nThey are much better to dark christians, muslims who speak hindi urdu unlike md and my lighter taller hindu cousins. Dark lower caste north Indians are worse but just dont use kalu slurs on me.\n\n\n-North Indians (haryana, Up, punjuab delhi) are quick to jump fists but very forgiving unlike south indians who dont confront but avoid adversaries passive aggressively forever if done . Northeasterners are polite when in mainland, but brutal if I go to their place and am not christian. \n\n\n- dark Tamils and telugu especially the low caste christian converts have been dicks while they lecher over my lighter skinned  female cousins. \n\n\n- Kerala christians who are light skinned mostly orthodox have been nicer to me than the hindus who I find are snarky, lazy and sarcastic crabs in the well especially if they are or were communist leaning regardless of their tone or caste. No postive experience with the dark skin latins. Cant trust either when it comes to business partnerships based on alignment ( not competence). Whereas for hindus or muslims alignment is alright but not the competence. \n\n\n-Positive takes on mangalorean catholics, karnataka or marathi hindus and most goan ones of both religions or any politics are okay if they are not . \n\n\n- Muslims (including moppilas), intial extrafriendliness but betrayal if not subordinated later on disagreement. Literal trap. Applies to BOTH religious and westernized with latter being more cunning. Gulf or overseas returnees are more islamist even though they are treated like dogshit by arabs. Aggressiveness and Condescension like North indians but on a collective basis without the forgiving nature. \n\n\nExceptions are rich shia trading folk,  those from kargil region, apostates and westernized apolitical muslim girls. \n\n\n- Very very postive experience with pahadis in india and West both genders, beats even canadians in Canada. If I were to return to India, Id pick pahadi or southwestern ghats to settle. \n\n\nIn west-.\n\n\n- Woke SJWs are horrible in person, much worse than supposedly racist southern rural trump supporters. Wokes give protection only to brown women not us men. 2nd gen included, as they give off snobbish superiority vibes especially the self hating women. Whites are much friendlier especially the rural ones. Those from industrial run down towns are the worst not the country boys or girls. White feminist SJW men are sleazeball up to black latino muslim voting blocks but are condescending to asian or hindu men. \n\n\n- Blacks, good on a personal basis as long as you are in higher ed professional setting not near ghetto or woke poltical crowd. Christian immigrants from africa carribean are good as long as they are more into church music over rap gangsta wannabes. Non somali eastern africans are extremely understanding to us. Muslim blacks dont like us unless we are Muslim. \n\n\n- Latin plus southern Europeans extra extra friendly, more ambitious and family minded than whites. Beautiful warm. Women. But unlike whites or jews, not sure if sentiment remains upon disagreements. I would have want to settle in southern europe or safer parts of latam if not India. Gangsta dirt poor ones not included. \n\n\n- Asian men, get along the most with them more than other Indians. Especially, the south east Asian ones (indonesian muslims hands up, Malaysian ones as worse as bangladeshi ones). Sinhalabuddhist catholics treated me better than SL tamils (Christians were bad) . 2nd gen koreans are less racist than fob koreans. \n\n\nNon japanese Asian women? More racist against us than Nazis, unless they are too ugly to be a sellout to white men, EXCEPT vietnamese fobs or half-thai ones. \n\n\n- Surprise exception: francophone muslim women  levantine or North african ones and ex soviet central asian muslim women are very truly liberal in terms of sexuality and european values moreso than fake indian islamophobia accusing feminists. For these women, sexual competition from liberal french or Russian women stealing their men makes them one up on it to play catch up. \n\n\n- The best indicator of how women treat you or how attractive other women are as competition thats why you see  fat ugly feminists pro islamists wanting to cover up bikini supermodels in burkas out of jealousy.\n\n\n- Eastern europeans are ill mannered and crass but they are the same to each other not just us. Neutral to positive opinions on other Europeans. Irish and Scots are friendly while English run policy by money over values unlike the French. \n\n\n- Very positive experience with Jews as Indian but noticed they are more insular to non asians prolly cause of bad history. \n\n\n- Dutch are direct to the point and best folks to do business with. Afrikaaner are as brave as non-london british and not as racist as they are accused to be. \n\n\n- young gen gaming adict hollywood junkies arent refined and lazy entitled brats unlike those born before 1985, same in india\n\n\nWill add more soon. \n\n\nPatterns I notice gets you treated better-\n\n\nLooks! Light skinned Indians who look italian or like tall athletic blacks get treated much better by everyone, especially the girls. If you are dark male you would do much better in west than in india. \n\n\nThose who look distinctively skinny fat or skinny short dark Indian with the pedostache and bad dress sense and accent will be bullied by the blacks muslims and avoided by the asians or whites or  2nd gen desi\n\n\nMoney! Stick yourself to professional crowds you will be respected but not on political and casual sphere. \n\n\nGangsters. There is a reason why world is going RW, being betabux bank account is not respected inhigh tax regimes even by gold digging women. Thats why you see 2nd gen kids of even doctors playing pretend gangsta let alone mirpuri or khalistani blue collar ones - those tantrums work with loose white women there. \n\n\nDo you resonate? Disagree. I dont mean to prime but these are patterns I cant ignore. Please share.\n\n\nEdit: automod  keeps removing it for cross posting?

<li>Title: 'Civil Disobedience and Making your voice heard'<br />Body: 'This is in continuation of [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/mevy8x/civil_disobedience_and_hindu_festivities/). The theme is slightly different and is OC so request the mod to not remove.\n\nThere are a number of books that one can read to cause the kind of civil unrest witnessed during Shaheen Bagh and Farmer protests. But this is abhorrent for the common citizenry (like you and me) and silent candle marches are just a trope now. So, let me share a few ideas which are peaceful, follow social distancing, and can send a loud message to the concerned parties. *Inspired slightly by Munnabhai MBBS.*\n\nHere are ways to celebrate and make your voice heard:\n\n1. Play loud festive music. If it is aarti or devotional music, all the better. The chance of offending the neighbours is lesser.\n2. Remember the request Modiji made about an year ago about banging pots and pans. Please follow his instructions again. Call people in your neighbourhood and organize it at a particular time and videotape the clangs echoing in the neighbourhood. Send to local media channels with a short message like "Holi ki pawri ho rahi hai".\n3. Take lots of photos of faces of family members with colour on them and people drenched in colours. Then tweet them out. Do not forget to tag everyone who commented about Diwali or Holi recently. Show to them that you \'appreciate\' their opinion about how to celebrate Holi.\n4. Buy Holi greeting cards and colour packets from Dharmic shops and use a Dharmic business to send it to your local MLA. Do not forget to add a personal note along the lines of "Wishing you a Happy Holi. Thanks for your immeasurable support." Members of legislature who really \'enjoy\' Hindu festivals should definitely be given special consideration.\n5. If you or your group is especially thankful to a prominent person, please buy these gifts and in person deliver it to the person. Maintain decorum, form a queue with 6 feet gap and do ring the bell to greet them. Bells are considered to be able to cleanse mind and soul. I am sure consistent doorbells will bring joy to them.\n6. While others dump animal dung in legislators houses, this is illegal and not Dharmic. Kindly consider buying garlands of flowers from a local flower shop and get it delivered. The smell of flowers after a few days do make it an especially pleasant affair. Also, you are supporting your local artisans.\n7. Such ideas have a low-cost impact on individuals, can be anonymous for the most part and can really show how you plan to support your local lawmaker in the next 5 years.\n8. These expressions of joy can also be utilized by writing a postcard to your local MLA with the content "Greetings from Indraprastha"/"Greetings from Bhagyanagar" etc. The more, the merrier. Similarly, if there is a recent display of communal harmony from a person, please do wish the person with "Get well soon" wishes govt postcard.\n9. *Kindly DO NOT take out your bike\'s silencer and annoy everyone. This is a known modus operandi of hooligans and public harassers of women. This has no place in our civil society.*\n\nBaaki all you are great at jugaad and creative thinking.'<br />Author: 'halla-nahi-hamla-bol'<br />id: 'mf9jpn'<br />Flair :Low Effort Shitpost ü§≥</li>

<li>Title: 'Civil Disobedience and Hindu Festivities'<br />Body: " There is a common saying that nearly every region in India has at least one festival every (lunar) month. Festivals in India have always played multiple roles. They have connected people to each other, connected people to the divine, and connected people to the world about them. Nearly every festival is a celebration, where neighbours come out of their houses to meet each other, visit friends and proudly and with great joy shake away the blues and mundaneness of the daily life.\n\nOur festivals have their own history, traditions, food, dresses, prayers and fond memories. Festivals have been the glue of the Bharatiya samaaj from time immemorial. I would go so far as to say that unlike Western festivals (New Year, Valentines, Mother's Day etc.) celebrated in India nowadays, our traditional days do not lead to a feeling of loneliness and depression. Even if you are not in your region, you can participate in a regional festival on the same day, albeit with a different name and traditions.\n\nEvery Indian knows this. Then why am I saying this. Because I want you to remember that festivals are an ESSENTIAL part of our way of living. In fact, our lives are meant to be a joyous occasion in themselves. So, when our festivals are maligned and our traditions distorted to suit someone's agenda we should stay strong. However, when governments start banning and completely restricting them, then we must act. No, I do not seek any violent or vulgar display of power or public anger. That is not the Indian way.\n\nI propose that you enjoy your festivities as a mark of civil disobedience. Yes, the virus is around. So, limit your gathering to one or 2 families only.

The summary of her Instagram account is - Ugly faces with accompanying preachy sermons on caste/gender(cis het badüò°)/privilege, basically issues she thinks she\'s an expert on \n\nNow I totally sympathise with the fact that trans people have a hard time coming out and being at peace with themselves and just being left the hell alone without all the bullying/tormenting/teasing. But this lady just takes it to a whole new level. First of all I find it ironic that she chides literally every cis het male for their "cis het male privilege" and how cis het males are far more privileged than her while she has the economic wherewithal to get a gender reassignment surgery+ hormonal therapy costing 13 lakhs AND an education in medicine from a private university while thousands of cis het males struggle to get even a decent undergraduate education, let alone fill the craters associated with their identity. \n\nSecond of all she uses her trans identity to shit on the govt(CAA/Farmer\'s protests) which literally has nothing to do with her trans identity lol. I mean with respect to letting LGBTQ marriages prevail she has a bone to pick, but apart from that I see little relevance \n\nThird - Inherent assumption that all cis het people are monsters and filthy SOBs. Look I get you might have been treated badly by cis het people but that gives you no right to demonize all of us. But then again this is the #AllMen mentality which strangely never translates to #AllMuslims. Now when someone pointed out the irony in her post that hating someone based on their sexual orientation is precisely the thing you\'re fighting against so isn\'t it hypocritical of you to engage in the same, she says "A minority is allowed to hate on the majority but not the other way around"(WTF?!)\n\nFourth - If you don\'t date trans women, you\'re transphobic. \n\nNo I\'m not. It\'s my life, and I am have all the right to choose who i wish to be romantically involved with. You may be great as a friend and I wouldn\'t mind going out and getting drinks with you, but I just can\'t get into a physical relationship with someone who is biologically male. Maybe it\'s my prejudice but when it comes to love, everyone is motivated by prejudice. Think of someone you love and try coming up with a logic based proof. You can\'t because it doesn\'t work like that. \n\n\nThese are just a few I can think of, but I\'d love to here your opinions!'<br />Author: 'Gunpowder_gelatin765'<br />id: 'm6ssti'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

Very kind, gentle, extremely intelligent, polyglot( knows around 6-7 languages with perfection), very honest and has a very high social standing in the neighborhood we live. I have this extreme regret for not having him in my life while I grew up. I don\'t even know what father\'s love means. Should I become a father, I don\'t even know how to express my love.\n\nHe worked hard and sent money back home for our house and repaid loan over years. He never lived in it. He doesn\'t even have photographs of the house until I\'ve shown him.\n\nHe is now old and not keeping well and I don\'t know how long he has. I am just giving him company, spending as much time as I can.\n\nAnd I don\'t exactly know what happened. Why has this happened. No one tells me.

O ye who believe! the idolators only are unclean...( 9.28)\n\n3. In truth the disbelievers are an open enemy to you. ( 4.101)\n\n4. O ye who believe! Fight those of the disbelievers who are near to you and let them find harshness in you...( 9.123)\n\n5. Lo! Those who disbelieve our revelations, we shall expose them to the fire. As often as their skins are consumed We shall exchange them for fresh skins that they may taste the torment. Lo! Allah is ever Mighty, Wise ( 4.56)\n\n6. O ye who believe! Choose not your father nor your brethren for friends if they take pleasure in disbelief rather than faith. Who so of you taketh them for friends such are wrongdoers. (9.23)\n\n7. Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk. (9.37)\n\n8. O ye who believe! Choose not for friends People of the Book and of the disbelievers. But keep your duty to Allah if ye are true believers.

If they turn back (to enmity) then take them and kill them wherever ye find them, and choose not friend nor helper from among them. (4.89)\n\n24. Fight them!

It will continue to go unabated. \n* Their toxic mechanisms include "cancel culture" and the mainstreaming of the "liberal voices". These ideas have a perfect ground due to the education system. \n* There are enough parallels between here and the US. Social media has assumed an outsize influence- Facebook/WhatsApp/Twitter. WhatsApp, specifically, is more insidious because they are using real-time data to trigger unrest in India through artificial intelligence mechanisms. The recent farmer\'s protests are merely a glimpse into what we will observe by 2024.\n\nThere is no straightforward way to counter it, although I can suggest a few changes: \n\n* Delete giant tech media. (I have archived this sub on the Telegram app through the bot), so in case the subreddit gets deleted (or deplatformed), it will have the last post till the time the tap is shut. \n* Join on alternative media like Telegram+Gab (and have presence on other digital mediums like Discord etc). \n* Aggregate+ work for a common goal for defending your faith. It means revival through regular Satsangs. Remember, the illustrious statesman Bal Gangadhar Tilak gave the call for Swarajaya by reviving the traditional Marathi Ganpati Utsav and realigned everyone to their roots. If your roots are strong, no one can uproot you. \n* Share ideas far and wide for national cultural revivalism and explore your own beliefs. There are many organizations for doing something similar and join them with any particular way you like with a common goal of Akhand Bharat. \n\nHari Om!'<br />Author: 'ommahakaal'<br />id: 'm4tghq'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Rajput alliances-How Wodeyars became Kshatriya [Part2]'<br />Body: 'In my last post here  , I explained how the Wodeyars invented a foreign chandravamshi lineage, created the Urs caste and dismantled the supra-local ruling classes of the Vokkaligas, but failed to penetrate the local power structures that were still in the hands of Vokkaligas and Lingayats. While the Urs sanskritised and anglicised themselves they were still regarded as an inferior caste by these landed communities. This post shall be about how they forged matrimonial alliances with the Rajputs, to buttress their Kshatriya status. \n\nWhen Maharaja Chamarajendra Wodeyar participated in the Imperial Assemblage held at Delhi in 1877 at the age of fourteen, he was treated with every mark of consideration as one belonging to the first rank of princes along with the Nizam of Hyderabad. But behind all the pomp and glory, he may have realised that among the Indian princes, Mysore was not regarded as highly as other Kshatriyas, and felt the isolation. He wished to enter the imperial space that the Kshatriyas in the North had already established through marriage alliances with each other.\n\nAfter the unfortunate loss of Chamarajendra Wodeyar to diphtheria , the Maharani, who then became the Regent on behalf of her young son, Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, asked the British for assistance to fulfil her late husband‚Äôs wishes. \n\nBut the letters from the British agents in the north were all disappointing. They all said that the Rajput chiefs did not recognise the Mysore family as belonging to their caste and that there would be difficulties in effecting a matrimonial alliance with Mysore, unless possibly a beginning could be made by marrying a Mysore princess to a Rajput chief. The Maharao of Kotah, who had recently lost his Udaipur wife, wanted to marry a Mysore princess with Rs. five lakhs of dowry, which was a huge amount of money considering that the civil list of Mysore Maharaja was then fourteen lakhs. Meanwhile, the Urs clan strongly opposed against the idea of giving Mysore princesses away. The Maharani refused, feeling uneasy about sending her young daughter away among ‚Äòpeople of strange language and habits‚Äô. By failing to give Mysore princesses to the Rajput chiefs, Mysore made it even more difficult for them to find a bride for the young Maharaja.\n\nNonetheless efforts continued and in 1898 a Mysore deputation was sent to north India, and Diwan Sheshadri Iyer in his Memo of Instruction stressed on ‚Äúhistory‚Äù stating that the Wodeyars ‚Äúemigrated from Dwaraka many generations ago‚Äù and belonged to the same stock as the Rajput ruling houses. The mythological origin stories of Yaduraya Wodeyar were printed in Kannada as Annals of the Mysore Royal Family and used as history text book in schools. With that, myth became fact.\n\nThey also made clear several promises on the side of Mysore. Any money or property which the bride‚Äôs father might wish to give her would be her own, the Mysore royal house would not take any dowry [this was not strange in the local context as dowry in the South is considered to be a new phenomenon. Traditionally, wedding expenses and the exchanging of gifts was shared much less asymmetrically between the bride‚Äôs kin and the groom‚Äôs kin, since South Indian kinship system was more isogamous compared (Srinivas 1984: 10)]. It was also asserted that Krishnaraja would remain monogamous while the bride was alive. \n\nThe tradition of endogamous marriage between the Wodeyars and the Urs was broken for the first time by the marriage of Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV with a princess from Vana, Kathiawar in 1900.  But this was not without compromise as there was a huge gap in the political status in the imperial order between them. Vana was just 62 square kms large, with population of just 2,749 and an annual revenue of a paltry Rs. 38,900. Their ruler was not even granted a gun salute by the British while Mysore was one of the three states at the time to be accorded the 21 gun salute, the highest of honours. The royal wedding itself cost Rs. 20 lakh. Krishnaraja Wodeyar was worth USD 56 Billion in today‚Äôs prices. \n\nWith this marriage the ice was broken and marriages with north Indian princely states has continued ever since. The last king of the dynasty, Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar, the nephew of Krishnaraja Wodeyar ‚Äì also married a princess from north India. She was from Charkhari, a princely state in Uttar Pradesh, which had the privilege of a 11 gun salute.\n\nAn interesting fact is that the Mysore royal family, did not have any ‚Äòrajput blood‚Äô till 2017 as none of the foreign marriages had produced any offspring. This was attributed to a curse believed to be cast on the Wadiyars in 1612 by Alamelamma, wife of King Tirumalaraja, who ruled the Vijaynagar Empire. It is believed that when her jewels were being taken under the orders of the Wodeyar ruler, she ran over to a cliff overlooking the Kaveri river and cursed before jumping to death :\n\n&gt; "Talakadu MaraLagali, Malangi Maduvagali, Mysooru Arasarige Makkalaagadirali" ( May Talakadu become a barren land, Malangi turn into a whirlpool and may Mysore kings never beget children).\n\nThis curse was however broken by the birth of a baby boy to Yaduveer Wodeyar (the adopted son of Rani Pramoda Devi) and the princess of Dungarpur in 2017.\n\nReferences: Ikegame, Aya.

I want to tell my story so that others won\'t get duped like me üò£ \n\nSince my child hood, I\'m a big of canada. When i was just 3,i drew my first maple tree leaf on a drawing book my unkill from kanada sent me. Before ABCD i have learned the spelling of K A N A D A. Canda is my divine destiny. \n\nAfter my intermediate in 3rd world country of India, i applied for a diploma course in African pottery in canada. My application was mysteriously rejected even though i explained kanada is my destiny. I deduce from this incident that mudi must have played a part in it, he is after all friends with trump who is anti immigration. \n\nSome years passed and my application keeps getting rejected. I emailed mudi (mudi@india.gov.in).he did not reply because he is a coward. \n\nI finally took the red pill. I DECIDED to defeat mudi at any cost. I opened 50 Twitter accounts and called out mudi and retweeted rahul gandhi\'s every tweets. \n\nThen the farm laws came, for the first time, i left my state of punjab to fight the fastism in delhi itself. Thought it may not have yielded that much, mysterious donors donated us daaru biryani through our stay. I later came to know the name of our donor, some guy they called **kejru**.. \n\nDuring my stay, i have seen a poster on a wall advertising visa to Canada. Even though i know mudi is blocking my future. I gave it a a try. A meet was set up the next day by a ditch near singhu border\\s make-shift pucca gym. \n\n---\n\nThe man i met looked professional and well dressed. He said he had been to Canada and showed me some pics. \n\nHe let me in on a grand project that is being developed on *need-to-know* basis. A train is being built from **india** to **canada**, as a part of QUAD. The purpose of this railway is to transport very heavy equipment with each other as a part of tech sharing. \n\nThe train is being called **SNOWPIERCER** and fully runs runs on nuclear power. \n\nhe said that Mudi used his influence to use Russian railway system as relay. A new bridge has been built from alaska to Russian tip. \n\nA train requires staff and i have been offered a job for a price of 50 lakhs Only.\n \n---\n\nI had a lot on my mind when i returned to singhu camp. I opened my imported (from canada) macbook and opened google map and selected "globe view"\n\nIt it indeed true. one can indeed cross russia into alaska and go to canada. I zoomed in to see the pictures of brige, but the internet is very slow because our comrades *burned down all jio 4g towers*. apparently they cause autism or something but some say it will bankrupt ambani and adani. airtel network is trash and probably overloaded.\n\nfrom my blurred macbook screen i could make out a small line, that should be the bridge after all, what else could it be..\n\nThis is the chance of my life. \n\nI parted with my comrades at the camp, they seem to be preoccupied with something something *redfort*. I don\'t care, I\'m ecstatic, I\'m going to my home country. \n\nI came back to my village and convinced my family to sell our ancestor land. It only fetched us 30 lakhs. I also sold off my cows and Buffalo\'s. Took a mortgage on our house to raise the remaining 20 lakhs. \n\nI asked my agent on mode of payment, he said payment gateway is down so bring it in cash. We met a few days later and i handed him hefty bag containing bundles of 2000 notes. He handed me a color printed paper which is my ticket. \n\n**Jalandhar(India) - Brampton(Canada)**\n\n**Crew Quarters - Q23**\n\n\nSatisfied, i thanked him and started packing up. \n\nToday is the day of my journey, it\'s past 8:00PM and there\'s no sight of **SNOWPIERCER** on track 1 at jalandhar railway station. The station staff are not helpful, they are saying no such thing exists. I don\'t understand. \n\n\nGuys, i have a feeling i have been scammed and mudi\'s agencies like CBI ED did not prevent this from happening. My agent is not lifting his phone. My parents are calling me to check if I\'m aboard snowpiercer. I have nothing to go back to. I just opened google maps to see my route once again, i cant see any bridge in between canada and alaska. they seem to small islands packed tightly that gave a illusion of a shape ridge shape on blurring.\n\nI decided to rest for today on platform, i still have hope. Before that, i decided to write this post just in case.\n\nGood luck everyone. \n\n(satirical essay)'<br />Author: 'a45ed6cs7s'<br />id: 'm4bwr9'<br />Flair ::HighIQ: Randia Simulation</li>

Indeed, if the growth rates trends seen from the latest census data sustain, Muslims may actually account for a lower proportion of India‚Äôs population than at their peak in 2011.The 2011 census puts the Muslim population at 17.22 crore or 14.22% of India‚Äôs total population.

Population growth is calculated using an exponential growth rate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nThe Hindu growth rate is 1.55% annually, while Muslims‚Äô is 2.2%. The figures for the previous decade (1991-2001) are an annual 1.8% and 2.6%, respectively. If this decline in growth rates persists (both continue to grow at slower rates), both Hindu and Muslim populations will hit a peak in 2061.  \n**Then, Muslims will number 29.24 crore and Hindus 140.25 crore.

Muslims will overtake Hindu population by 1991-**but India\'s total population would have to grow to nearly twice the UN projections for this to happen.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n( Error 404, graph not found )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe also looked at a third case where the reverse happens. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Consider the Hindu growth rate slowing at the worst rate ever, which was in the decade till 2011, and Muslims growth rate increasing in the same way it did for the decade ending in 1991 (from 2.68 to 2.85%, or 17 basis points). One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n**The Hindu population will stabilize in 2071 at 139.43 crore. But Muslims will only account for 91.68 crore of the population or 39.21%.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nIt will be by **2091** that Muslims will outnumber Hindus in India if the growth rate increases by 17 basis points every decade. *But for that pattern to persist, Muslim population will have to grow to 182.91 crore and the Muslim exponential growth rate at that point comes to be over 3.54%.*\n\n  \n\n\n# ‚ÄúThat will never happen. The highest exponential growth rates for population do not generally exceed 2%. All communities see a reduction in population growth as the level of education and development increase," said S.K. Singh, professor at the Department of Mathematical Demography and Statistics at the International Institute for Population Studies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To put it in context, global population growth rate peaked out at 2.19% in 1962-63, according to Geoffrey Gilbert‚Äôs World Population: A Reference Handbook. Moreover, India‚Äôs population would be 311.41 crore by 2091 in the third scenario.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nThe United Nations has projected India‚Äôs population to grow to 170.53 crore by 2050, and then decline to 165.97 by 2100. While that is not gospel truth, it also suggests that neither the scenario of Hindu population growing to 219.95 crore, nor the Muslim population growing to 182.91 crore are likely to come true.The UN‚Äôs 2050 figure, however, is close to the base-case scenario which estimates a total population of 173.03 crore by 2061. Thus, the scenario where Hindus outnumber Muslims 4:1 seems most likely of the three. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe assumption for that scenario is that growth rates from 2011 will decline in the same way that they did between 2001 and 2011. Why? Simply because literacy and economic well-being are improving, although at a debatable pace.‚ÄúThe pace of convergence depends on a number of socio-economic, political and programme factors, and the process will be hastened with the spread of mass education especially amongst women and girls and a sustained reduction in poverty across all population groups," says the Sachar Committee report released in 2006.'<br />Author: 'itisverynice'<br />id: 'm3k15l'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'How to become Kshatriya -Mysore Case Study'<br />Body: 'Kings and rulers often tried to legitimate the superiority of royal houses over the people they ruled by inventing foreign origins and divine lineages. This is called \'Conundrum of the King\'s authority\' because of the inherent contradiction of them being outsiders and at the same time rulers of the local society. \n\nThe caste of the Wodeyars of Mysore is called  \'Arasu\' / \'Urs\' caste. It means King. According to legend Yaduraya Wodeyar, a young Chandravamshi prince of Dwarka and descendant of Lord Krishna was invited by the Vijaynagar Emperor to rule a small region around the Kaveri River in Karnataka in 1400 CE. When Yaduraya arrives at the village of Hadadana near Mysore, he learns that the local Palegar had renounced his kingship to become an ascetic and that his daughter was being harassed by the army chief Marasa Nayaka . Yaduraya kills the army chief and marries the princess to become the King of Mysore. \n\nThis legend served multiple purposes. It established a chandravamshi kshatriya lineage, it established a connection with the indigenous people through the princess and it could also explain why the descendants of Lord Krishna worshipped the local village goddess \'Chamundeshwari\' as their clan god (Kula Devi). Moreover the villain of the story Marasa Nayaka was a low caste Toreya, this helped further emphasise the pure-blooded superiority of the Wodeyars.\n\nHowever historians noted a lot of inconsistencies. It was extremely far-fetched that the Vijaynagar Emperor Harihara II would invite Yaduraya from Distant Dwarka. Yaduraya would have to risk his life and travel through two hostile Muslim Kingdoms, the Gujarat Sultanate and Brahmani Kingdom to reach Vijaynagar. Epigraphy mentioning the Wodeyars began only 150 years after 1400 CE. The legend of Yaduraya made its advent only in the later half of 17th century. Different versions of the legend had been fabricated by the poets commissioned by  Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar.\n\nHistorians like David Leeming and Aya Ikegame instead suggest that the Wodeyars were local feudal lords and that the \'Urs\' had extremely indigenous origins. \n\nIn the 17th century the \'Vokkaligas\'/\'Gowdas\', the landed gentry and agriculturist caste of Karnataka had the most number of ruling families. Chikkadevaraja strategically united the other feudal lords under the \'Urs\' caste and divided them into hierarchical groups based on their relationship with Vokkaligas and the size of their feudal domains. The Vokkaligas were systematimatically eliminated from amongst the ruling classes. \n\nThen Chikkadevaraja violently persecuted the Lingayats (a community of shaivites of diverse caste origins, that politically dominated North Karnataka) who had risen in insurrection. An invitation was sent to all the Lingayat priests to meet the Raja at the great temples of Nunjengod, in order to discuss the conduct of their follower. Executioners who were lying in wait slaughtered  400 priests. Orders were sent to destroy over 700 Lingayat mutts on the same day. \n\nNobuhiri Ota says the Urs including the Wodeyars belonged to not only the peasant caste but were also from other castes. The Urs adopted vegetarianism, and Sanskrited themseleves as Kshatriyas. But the local Kannada Brahmins refused to coronate the Wodeyars and so they had to import a group of ‚ÄúTamil Brahmins‚Äù from Srirangam to officiate the ceremony.  \n\nThe Vokkaligas and Lingayats considered the Wodeyars of an inferior cowherd caste (possibly even potter caste). Since the Wodeyars did not have kinship with the local elites, their power penetration in local arenas was severely limited. \n\nRoyal schools were set up to train the young urs elite (anglicise them) and courses included history (British version), geography, arithmetic (Traditionally mathematical knowledge was considering unnecessary for Kshatriyas), horse riding and cricket. While this improves the status of the rich urs. The gap between the poor and rich urs grew. \n\nThe wodeyars realised that it was pointless to try to convert the Urs into a powerful landed aristocracy and instead tried unsuccessfully to educate the poorer sections of their own caste members to expand their political power beyond the palace administration.  English boarding schools were also made available for poorer urs to create a gentleman class . But the poorer urs lacked the political ambition to return to the village and instead preferred jobs such as clerks and officers in the city. So mysore kingdom finally resorted to a decentralised administration, taking immense care not to ruffle the sentiments of the dominant landed gentry at the local level.\n\nQuoting James Manor "The Lingayats and Vokkaligas enjoyed an unwritten and unspoken but very real promise of non-interference from the states princely rulers who came from a cow-herding jati-indeed, some believe that they were originally potters, an even humbler caste-and who now claimed Kshatriya status."\n\nIn Part 2: I shall continue the story of how the Wodeyars through matrimonial alliances tried to buttress their mythological origin. \n\n\nReferences:-\n\nIkegame, Aya.
