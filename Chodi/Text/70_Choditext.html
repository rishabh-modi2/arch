Not by Varna or JƒÅti.'<br />Body: "Just pasting my comment here from one of the posts to make more people aware. The topic is that many people in the sub are holding ideology of following varna or caste system. And I think we must not divide ourselves in varnas because the time has changed.\n\nPeople from different varnas are doing different jobs. And they are no way willing to accept it. They recognize themselves according to modern caste system. Are Brahmins going to accept Dalits who are in higher position in various sectors? I'm sure Dalits would accept Brahmins doing labour work (which itself is hard to find).\n\nPlease dont spread this Varna ideology. We have already been divided enough. Savarkar's work shouldn't be wasted. Kindly read his 'Six Golden Pages of Indian History'. He brilliantly points out what mistakes we Hindus have been doing till today. And caste is the major factor in it. Savarkar called it Seven Shackles. \n\nAccording to Savarkar, the Hindu society was bound by seven shackles ( bandi ) viz. prohibition of touch (sparshabandi) of certain castes, prohibition of interdining (rotibandi) with certain castes, prohibition of intercaste marriages (betibandi), prohibition of pursuing certain occupations (vyavasayabandi), prohibition of seafaring (sindhubandi), prohibition of rites sanctioned by the Vedas (vedoktabandi), prohibition of reconversion (shuddhibandi) to the Hindu religion."<br />Author: 'boywhospy'<br />id: 'hvddoy'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'Akhand Bharat?

She is secular)'<br />Body: "Fun fact: all the m≈≥slims  residing in bharat(bharat a.k.a india, pakistan, afghanistan, bangladesh, mayanmar and neighbouring countries) were all hindus once. These poor people got forcefully converted to ƒØslam by the invaders. They havent realised that yet. Their ancestors were hindus infact. I really pity them. Knowingly or Un-knowingly they follow √Øslam even though their past were horrendous. They are the ones who truly sufferrd from this genocide of   √Æslam. It is our duty to educate them because we are lucky that we did not get converted. Know this.. there wer no m√ºslims b4 the invasion. M≈Øslim ppl did not come from sky and settled here. They carry the blood of hindus. Its only logical to think that they wer hindus once. Tbh this scene looks like a disaster to me. But them being ignorant is what aches the most. Such blind faith in any religion is dangerous to humanity itself. That is y hinduism(sanatan dharm) is beautiful. It allows every question and provides answer. No intolerance. Although i think at this age of kaliyug a hindu must become a militant. At this age it is a threat for their own identity. I mean have u ever given it a thought? Y the world's oldest civilisation is still alive? Because we have dharma . A law to be followed for the welfare of the society. There was a fuckin bloody war to save dharma. Can u give me any name of a country at this age wer hindus are a majority or population atleast more than 30%?  The only country left is india .  Understand that fact. Only 1 country in this world for hinduism. Either others are atheistic or islam or christian country. The dharm which taught the whole world has no place. Yes hinduism is the only religion in the wolrd which talks about the universe. Bhagawat gita is the only book wer krishna says I AM GOD. With a given identity. No other books says this. We had to fight for freedom for our country? From foriegn invaders we had to save our land?\nTemples give money for govt. for tax but no church and mosques are allowed to give? Is this secularism? Is this y u sent me that photo of a man hugging a mu≈õlim? In mosques it compulsary for kids to learn quran but it is prohibited in temples to learn vedas and upanishads. Wtf? Why? Why us?u know why? Because we are peaceful. This is wer tge problem lies. Jainism is kept in high regard for non violence. But wat will u do if u wer born in pakistan. No church no temples. U are a kafir. In quran it is permitted to have a kafur woman as a sex slave if she isnt accepting islam.u me and all hindus are fortunate to have been born in this land. Eevn if u put up non violrnce against such action will this stop happening? These laws are ancient. It was held for people wen there was only our dharm. Times have changed. U wud have eating beef if u wer in pakistan or u wud be killed or u wud be kept as sex slave(sorry for abrasive langiage but its the truth). My mssg to ƒ´slam is do watevr u want but dont convert and dont kill. We are not kafirs. And then they will play victim card that minority are opressed . Hear this out: the day they become majority it is the end of dharma, end for u and me and all tge loved ones.pls stop secularism and save culture. Wat was the take away from this mmsg? *We are fighting for our own rights*\nIsnt it?\nDo you know wer the problem lies? We are not taught wat has been written in the scriptures. Atleast not me. We just want to sit and watch FRIENDS and other series, idealise the west. Eat french fries,  do make up. Travel europe and join iit, ditch the country and work in a foriegn firm like a slave and we question y india is still a developed country. Y all people here are money mongers. Y they are peaceful."<br />Author: 'indian_danker'<br />id: 'hv6ufy'<br />Flair :Butthurt OP</li><li>Title: 'What is your honest opinion on Marathis ?'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hv58z1'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'Jai Bhavani, Jai Shivaji!'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hv51k6'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'I invite all bakchod GTA online players to join my crew PKMKB and spread this universal truth.'<br />Body: ' [https://socialclub.rockstargames.com/crew/p\\_k\\_m\\_k\\_b/wall](https://socialclub.rockstargames.com/crew/p_k_m_k_b/wall)'<br />Author: 'naya-nakli-khata'<br />id: 'hv4uee'<br />Flair :PKMKB</li><li>Title: 'Kanye West joined IT cell #2020vision'<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7j40rfadb6c51.jpg?width=602&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1579dec031927682ecd22811c92957be9857b68e'<br />Author: 'Chance_Midnight'<br />id: 'hv3x0h'<br />Flair :Bakchod News</li><li>Title: 'Sacha dost'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hv3muv'<br />Flair :Shitpost</li><li>Title: 'PETA tho mootne laga saala'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hv3kta'<br />Flair :The Times of Chodi</li><li>Title: 'Banned from r/ Hindi'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'DirectTension'<br />id: 'hv36mx'<br />Flair :Butthurt OP</li><li>Title: "Although I don't agree with these comments in any way.

Yes, despite what you think we are in a  great  danger and I will explain how.**\n\nRight  now, as I see it there is a  temporary pact between the anarchists,  communists and certain Religious leaders which is really unstable. All  of them are trying to fool one another. Communists see this pact as  their way to power. Anarchist see it as their way to Freedom and  Religious leaders see it as their chance  to realize their prophecy and  dreams. ***In The 2020 Delhi Riots***,  the  Anarchists and Communists lost their control which they had on  religious leaders, The religious community hijacked it by planning their  own deadly stunt,  Which resulted in deaths of many people.\n\n**Why are they, so powerful?**\n\nThey  have a political ecosystem which is funded by many enemies of our  country. Money is laundered with the help of N.G.Os and religious  donations.Not just that, They pay celebrities, activists, influencers,  reporters and news networks to further their plan. They have to show  their loyalty from time to time by responding, so they don‚Äôt lose their  perks. While most people are blindly supporting these ideologies, as  they have been fed the wrong information. The people who are at  forefront of this are  doing it for power and money.\n\n**What is Political Ecosystem?**\n\nPolitical Ecosystem: It is a community of people, Individual networks which help each other to propagate their ideas.\n\n**Why should we be worried about this ‚ÄúPolitical Ecosystem‚Äù?**\n\nToday  many  Indians have access to fast Internet connection which helps  spread  information quickly. But the most used Platforms are already  filled with propaganda spreading Individuals. Countless news websites  and news  networks are also doing this, and they are all part of this  Ecosystem,  If you don‚Äôt agree with them, they will attack your personal  life. They  literally have control over trends on social media. Day by  day critical  thinking is being perceived as hateful. Unless of course  you do it  selectively against, the majority population.\n\n**Do we need this kind of structure too?**\n\nYes,   but it will be nearly impossible for someone like us to do something  this huge. I have heard the arguments made against it by Anand  Ranganathan, but I think it is naive to think that way. Having no   ecosystem is the reason why people hesitate to go against   pseudo-secularists. People like True Indology can‚Äôt even reveal  themselves because as soon as they do that, They will be attacked. Our  country does not allow full freedom to express ourselves either.\n\n**What can we do?**\n\nWe can build a small community. which will play a bigger role.\n\n**How to start?**\n\n1. First step is to create content.\n\na)  Get into writing and write  articles with sources and data. There are  many websites which accept  articles from individuals who write opinion  posts. Write cultural blogs,  make news websites.\n\nb)  Make YouTube channels and either report or talk about the related   topics. If Again, you are not confident enough about your safety, make   just voice-overs or if you don't want to make voice over use text with   pictures and explain the topic. Please do it anonymously because the   last thing you want is to be arrested.\n\nc)  People who are good at debates and making points should write cheat   sheets to help others argue on topics but please don't try to prove something which is false into truth. The last thing we want is people   cherry-picking our arguments and portraying us in bad light.  I will   help to answer some arguments. Maybe start compiling arguments from the hijacked subreddit and make a list?\n\nd) Create surveys and create statistics with that data ! The more data sources you create the better it will be.\n\ne)  Make memes like you always do! Many people don't like to read long  paragraphs like these but they do get influenced by humor. Red pill  everyone with your awesome memes.\n\nf)  Gather artists who can produce stuff in bulk when needed. Cartoonists,  concept designers, music producers everyone should be welcomed. Support  them if you can.\n\ng) There is lot  of fake information on Wikipedia which needs to be fixed but for it to  stay there for long time we need some old Wikipedia accounts with good  records. Makes yours now and wait.\n\nh)Document  everything on Twitter, learn to archive even Reddit and  YouTube. Many  people just protect their tweets and comments which expose  their  hypocrisy so instead of just screenshotting it which can be  faked,  learn to archive it. I remember a famous political YouTuber  making fun a  person with disability. I did not archive it and I think he  deleted  that comment Now.\n\n2) Organize Funds\n\nSave money because you will need it for leasing servers and domains, paying artists, supporting your favorite content creators.\n\n3)Organize  yourselves.  Plan ahead of time. You guys have discord right? Start  from there. Just  make sure there are no snitches in that chat who will  screen shot it.\n\n4) Be active in online debates or public if you can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(Note when you pay a PayPal user his first and last name is revealed so please use fake name if you don't want unwanted attention from vultures. Don't disclose private information when buying domain. Simple who.is Lookup will reveal your name if you give it out so buy domains with who.is protection.)**"<br />Author: 'XE34Q'<br />id: 'hupgoq'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'PSA: looking forwardt to hearing Shri K K Muhammed live on @pGurus1 YouTube channel.

This is not just any coronavirus but the Chairvirus of the virus community‚Äôs COVID-19 Task Force. I must record here my gratitude to Potangoli Pvt Ltd for sharing with me a special bio-genetic software that enabled me to bypass the communication barrier between humans and viruses and conduct this historic interview. Edited excerpts:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** Thank you Mr‚Ä¶should I address you as Mister or Ms or..?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** The virus community is stringently opposed to any form of discrimination or identification based on gender, sexual orientation or heteronormativity. We are fully LGBTQIA-plus-plus-compliant. However, to keep things simple, you may call me Shrimati Shrimati SARS-CoV-2-XUV-700-ji.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But if that causes symptoms of breathlessness, say ‚ÄòCorona Madam‚Äô.  \n**Me**: Corona Madam, let me start with a personal question. In the good old days, viruses had such exotic names ‚Äî Chikungunya virus, Chandipura virus, Uukuniemi virus, West Nile virus. I mean, who wouldn‚Äôt want to meet the West Nile virus? Or get a taste of Tuscany from the Toscana virus? But nowadays you‚Äôve gone fully alphanumeric! It‚Äôs all HIV, HAV, H1N1, SARS-CoV-2. You have 10 gorgeous species of rotaviruses. But their names? They are called A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. Why?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** We viruses have long outgrown the primitive human proclivity for names loaded with meaning. Some human societies, for instance, call themselves a democracy. Does that mean they actually are a democracy? On the other hand, a virus by any name would be as infectious.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me**: It‚Äôs nearly six months since you entered the Indian market. How has the journey been?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** Well, the April-June numbers have just come in and I‚Äôm happy to share that our quarterly results have exceeded our top line and bottom line projections. On all the key growth parameters ‚Äî number of infections, mortality, rate of transmission, and public relations ‚Äî India has been our biggest success story.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** What‚Äôs the secret behind the COVID-19 success story in India?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** Before coming to your country, we‚Äôd heard a lot about Indian hospitality. *Atithi devo bhava*, right? But none of us expected such a fabulous reception. All the clapping, the lighting of candles, the sheer human warmth, and everywhere we went, encouraging chants of ‚ÄúGo, corona, Go!‚Äù ‚Äî you guys made us feel at home. We finally realised what your PM meant when he said the ‚Äòease of doing business‚Äô in India is unmatched by any other country.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** Really?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** Yours is the only country that has implemented every single one of our recommendations.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** What recommendations?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** India is a large country, but its cities are not well connected with the hinterlands. We needed help in rapidly expanding our geographical footprint. So we suggested a unique lockdown model wherein migrant workers in cities are forcibly held back for a few weeks in overcrowded conditions where chances of infection are high, and then gradually allowed to disperse to villages across the country. Your government loved our suggestion. India‚Äôs unique, zero-notice lockdown gave us the initial boost we needed ‚Äî a generous seed fund of infections ‚Äî in order to become *Atmanirbhar* in India.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** You mean, India‚Äôs lockdown was your idea?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus***(smiling):* We do our homework.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** But the logic of a lockdown is that it makes it difficult for you guys ‚Äî sorry, you girls ‚Äî to infect more people. So why would you recommend it?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** We figured that whether it‚Äôs a pandemic or Pangong Tso, so long as we let your government score propaganda victories, we can do whatever we want.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** Why does this logic sound familiar?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** Back where I come from, it‚Äôs common sense. Anyway, to answer your question, we made a deal with your government. We said, ‚ÄúLook, we‚Äôll save you from having to spend big money on public health, hospital beds, testing capacity, nurses‚Äô salaries, etc.‚Äù How, they wanted to know. We said, ‚ÄúDo a draconian lockdown ‚Äî it will cost you nothing, but it will look like you‚Äôve taken decisive action. We‚Äôll manage the rest.‚Äù So, we let your government control the narrative, and in exchange, our best ever performance came under your lockdown.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** I see. So you really are a Chinese virus, aren‚Äôt you?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** Viruses don‚Äôt subscribe to national identities. But yes, I do sometimes consult for the PLA.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** You betrayed us!And to think we trusted and encouraged you!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** I‚Äôll say this much. Despite my place of origin being China, I‚Äôve never felt discriminated against in your country. All I‚Äôve ever received, from the people and the government, is love, and for that, every single coronavirus will always have a soft corner for India in its RNA.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** Ok, this interview is over.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus** (*laughing*):Cool.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** Why you laughing?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** Your mask!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** What‚Äôs so funny about my mask?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** It‚Äôs the way you Indians wear masks. And then you blame us when you die!\n\n*G.

They have a stable demography, their minority don\'t impede government schemes and mooch off from welfare unnecessary.\n\nPakistan could have been a tourism hub with developed sites like Taxila, they could have made big bucks by facilitating Hindu pilgrimage sites like Punch-Mukhi Hanuman Mandir in Karachi. \n\nA famous museum could be built with various historical artefacts found across Pakistan. Instead of breaking centuries old statues just because some illiterate maulvi told them to, they could have placed that statue inside that non-existent museum. I am sure they would find large amount of historical evidences given their "Indus Valley" roots.\n\nSindh could have been made world largest financial hub, something like Hong-Kong. A world class port could have been developed in Karachi, given its location.\n\nInstead they kill poor minorities and blame everything as "yahoodi sazish".\n\nI guess, Madarsa grade education combined with 7th century mindset produces a failed state like Pakistan.'<br />Author: 'Frosty_War'<br />id: 'htl4zc'<br />Flair :Rant</li><li>Title: 'He made some mistakes :('<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'htjwd3'<br />Flair :OC Meme</li><li>Title: 'Mighty Paxtani Elite paratroopers'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'htjfi3'<br />Flair :Randia Simulation</li><li>Title: 'Took this from somewhere else, but this is hold :p'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'htjb7c'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'Right wing historians'<br />Body: "Bhratas, \n\nI was recently watching Sorabh pant's interview with Ramachandra Guha.

Furthermore they have taken well a meaning Gujarati man to deliver this message, he makes good points and it's good to nip this intolerance in the bud however they don't look into why these views are there? He doesn't know and just thinks it starts with the Indian community.\n\nHow about 200 fucking years of colonialism from the whites? Who ran slave trades out of India, where white was right, similar to how 100s of years of slavery has left a mark on the black community, so has the brutal ruling of India. I will concede that the caste system may have something to do with it, as people who would be darker in India would've worked manual labour as opposed to the former who wouldn't be as dark.\n\nAlso these views on black people specifically, where did they come from? Aside from the minuscule black community that the majority of India hasn't interacted with, many Indians wouldn't have come across black people. So where did they get these thoughts from? From other racist white people, that's who. Who had golliwogs, cartoonised black people and a propaganda of anti black rhetoric? White people. The British Indian community that immigrated learnt this from the locals and american Hollywood, same with the Indians back home, all they saw from america was white people in lead roles and all this old racist subtle messaging. \n\nI am wanting to right a letter/email to the BBC about this, not to silence them because the substance is true and silencing makes us seem weak, we have to accept our mistakes but i will not stand for the propaganda, we need to correct them about where this came from. I know this isn't the oppression Olympics but my god did they and the afghans fuck our beautiful country for far too long to not be held acceptable for it.\n\nApologies for any mistakes in the typing, i'm too heated rn to care. \n\nJai Hind."<br />Author: '1337k1d'<br />id: 'hrtix5'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: "you're nice question but your question my sickularism ..."<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dzwrzf6me2b51.png?width=1084&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc188acd5adc9232c00dddf56978e4c37988cc9e'<br />Author: 'kiyutus'<br />id: 'hrt5aj'<br />Flair :From Twitter Meme</li><li>Title: 'My dream vs Reality'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hrrwiq'<br />Flair :OC Meme</li><li>Title: 'Cheeee what lass for Preedom Ap Speeech'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hrox2r'<br />Flair :The Times of Chodi</li><li>Title: 'Dear comrades'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hropkk'<br />Flair :Laal Salaam</li><li>Title: 'Recently started watching WION, have to say, they are actually quite unbiased!'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hro66d'<br />Flair :Bakchod News</li><li>Title: 'You laugh you anti national. ‡§Ö‡§¶‡•ç‡§≠‡•Å‡§§ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hrnv4c'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'Logical Komedians'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hrn448'<br />Flair :High IQ</li><li>Title: 'MC BC Beti Nigga i have achieved komedy'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hrm1qy'<br />Flair :OC Meme</li><li>Title: 'TIL zam zam is water from the haram masjid at mecca'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hrlpum'<br />Flair :Shitpost</li><li>Title: 'Flip Side of Mahatma Gandhi'<br />Body: "Reasons for killing Mahatma Gandhi:\n \nDuring the trial justice Khosla had allowed Nathuram Godse the killer of Gandhi to read his own confession in the court.\n\nHowever the Indian government had banned the confession of Nathuram.\n\nNathuram's brother Gopal Godse fought a 60 years legal battle after which the Supreme Court removed the ban.\n \nNathuram had given 150 reasons for killing Gandhi; some of which are as follows:\n \n1. In 1919 people of India wanted General Dyer to be tried for the Massacre of innocent people at Jalianwalla Bagh. Gandhi refused to support this demand.\n\n2. Whole of India wanted Gandhi to intervene and save Bhagat Singh,Rajguru and Sukhdev from the Gallows. Gandhi stubbornly refused on the grounds that they were misguided freedom fighters, and theirs was an act of  violence.\n\n3. On 6th May 1946 on public platform, Gandhi asked Hindus to sacrifice and not fight the members of Muslim league. In Kerala Muslim league members killed over 1500 Hindus and converted 2000  to Islam. Instead of protesting Gandhi expressed that it was a brave act of Allah's followers.\n\n4. On several occasions Gandhi called Shivaji, Maha Rana pratap and Guru Govind Singh as misguided nationalists.\n \n5. Gandhi advised Raja Harisingh of Kashmir to abdicate as Kashmir had Muslim majority ,and settle down in Kashi. Raja Harisingh on the other hand he supported the Nizam (Osman Ali Khan ) of Hyderabad to join Pakistan , even though the state of Hyderabad\n(Andhra , Telangana ,Karnataka and Berar) had Hundu majority. Sardar Vallabh bhai Patel however over ruled Gandhi. When Nehru heard of Patel's police action in Hyderabad (operation POLO) he disconnected his telephone with Patel.\n \n6. In 1931 the congress committee on designing of Indian flag suggested that the flag be only in saffron. Gandhi insisted changed it to a tri-colour flag.\n\n7. During the Tripura congress , Subhash Chandra Bose was elected as president with majority however Gandhi supported Pattabhai Sitaramayya forcing Bose to resign.\n \n8. On 15th June 1947 during congress conclave it was decided to resist the partition of India but Gandhi went to the meeting at the\nlast minute and supported the partition. Infact it was Gandhi who had declared earlier that partition will take place only over my dead body.\n\n9. Sardar Patel was elected by majority as the first Prime Minister but Gandhi insisted on Nehru .\n \n10. Nehru government had decided to reconstruct Somnath Mandir at its cost but Gandhi without even being a member of the ministry forced the Govt. to reject this proposal. At the same time on 13th January 1948 he went on a fast to allow Muslims to repair the mosque in Delhi at govt's cost.\n \n11. When Hindus refugees returned to India after partition, some of them took shelter  in some mosques temporarily. When Muslims objected ,Gandhi forced all such Hindus children,ladies and the old to leave the mosque and live on the streets.\n \n12. In October 1947 Pakistan attacked Kashmir, Gandhi went on a fast and forced the Indian Govt to pay Pakistan a compensation of Rs.55 crore. Gandhi did not mind hurting Hindu feelings to win over the Indian Muslims.\n\nNathuram Godse and Narayan Apte were hanged on 15th November 1949 in the Ambala Jail in Punjab.\n\nFound this at a post somewhere, and would appreciate if chodi bhratas can help find references to these from respective books"<br />Author: 'ManikManson'<br />id: 'hrjp50'<br />Flair :Unverified</li><li>Title: 'B*uslim women in Real Life'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hrhl89'<br />Flair :Jihad</li><li>Title: 'BJP IT cell is the third planet from sun'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hrhdrh'<br />Flair :OC Meme</li><li>Title: 'We need members here, to make trueindology famous'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hrf6i5'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'How close are you to mukhti/enlightenment/nirvaan/Truth ?'<br />Body: "Choose one of these options.\n\n1.

In India, you will be judged by the Indian society as horrible and ungrateful if you tell them that your parent might have abused you. Indian parents often resort to physical, verbal, mental, emotional abuse; mostly because they have been raised that way. This is a stupid backward society which keeps on practising the authoritarian system of parenting despite being a democracy. Your parents are pure narcissists who I know for a fact are highly toxic and simultaneously brainwash you into being grateful for providing you with basic amenities, something which all parents do and are legally bound to. Oh, btw, you were simply meant to be your parents\' retirement plan that they have invested in you, nothing more than that, if you have Indian parents that is. Just cut off all contact from your toxic af Indian parents. \n\nThey show you off to their peers and ironically, claim that your achievements are a result of their excellent parenting. It like beating the shit out of a dog to train him jst to win the local dog competition and bear the "best dog trainer" title. Everything revolves around reputation in India. This has created self-centred bastards everywhere in India who can go to any extent in order to uphold/improve their reputation and to flaunt/boast themselves by being condescending to others. This is also misused by a lot of Indian parents. Initially they shout at and beat the child when the kid makes a mistake. Later on in their lives they become completely intolerant and start abusing their kids for almost no reason whatsoever. They derive pleasure by bullying their kids. As an excuse they say that they have a short temper and can\'t control it. Do not fall for their shit. They think of you as mere extensions of themselves and ignore or crush you individuality. Your parents are horrible, abusive, toxic, inhuman and rotten to the very core of their existence. Avoid contact with them as much as possible or even better, cut off those toxic bastards out of your life, go NC (no contact).

Now!!'<br />Body: "I was recently shocked to know that Islam and its philosophy is taught as a history chapter in class 11 in the CBSE curriculum. Although I don't object to that specifically but what beats me is that there is no mention if Hinduism anywhere, leave alone its philosophy, or the vedic culture from ancient India. How can we expect children to be aware of their true identities if they are being taught philosophies that are not only controversial and contradictory but also inflammatory, misleading, and extremely brainwashing. \n\nThe need of the hour is to significantly change our school education system so that it accurately reflects our profoundly rich ancient culture and wisdom from the vedas. An education that brings values and wisdom from the vedas and intermixes them with modern day technological ideas and sciences will not only eclipse the knowledge that we are able to access today but it will eventually make better human beings out of the next generations. An education of such a kind will ensure that the next generations are not only innovators and world leaders but they are responsible and good human beings who cherish their values more than their money and property. \n\nBefore learning how and when an another religion came into being, we must be aware of what our culture and traditions are and how they came into being. Instead of begin taught how and why the taj mahal was made, we must be informed about how and why the Ellora caves and the sun temple were built. Instead of learning what Ramzaan is, we must be taught what navratre and karva chauth really are. In place of killing and eating animals for religious celebrations we must learn to respect and treat them well. Instead of marrying four wives to increase population for religious gains, we should be taught to love and respect one person while responsibly conserve the resources of mother earth for future generations. \n\nWe need to change our education system.

Since, most of us aren't jobless like these Pakis, it's easy for us to be influenced by the propaganda, I've noticed a lot of my friends who take whatever is on reddit as the gospel truth.
