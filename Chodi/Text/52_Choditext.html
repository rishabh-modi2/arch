How come Bharat became a secular country l, when the division happened based on religion?'<br />Body: 'Please don‚Äôt attack me for not knowing history. No hard feelings. Just wanted to know your thoughts. \n\nI have a few thoughts  to share from myself. \n\n1) May be it was not a division. Muslims were asked to move to Muslim part (and made Pakistan) and Non-Muslims (not just Hindus) were free to stay in original Bharat. And as we had all non Muslims, we became secular. \n\n2) May be philosophy of ‚ÄòHindu‚Äô is way beyond religions. We all were/are Hindu still. So even some Muslims (Muslims of Hind)  made their own country, we are still Hindus. And Hindu being a culture/philosophy/way to live life/Santana Dharm, it turned out non religious country. \n\n3) I also think Hindu is not just a religion. If I ask a religious question to two Muslims from different part of the world, they will say the same thing. But in our Bharat, even your neighbour might say things very different, so we were never united on beliefs, we were United beyond religion even from start. \n\n4) It was just a brutal politics and we turned out secular in order to please everyone. \n\nThanks guys!  üôè'<br />Author: 'myrealact'<br />id: 'khezur'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: "Libbus are crying that the Farm bills were passed in RS unconstitutionally because: 1.

In Next 30 years they will be over 40 % of total and even higher young age population. And remember , no Once Child Policy will be able to stop them from breeding instead end up being a dickhammer for us. So the way out is hindus should have at least 4 kids who must be given dharmic education and taught to kill and die for dharma. It's expenses bearing is a bit difficult but it's neccassary if you don't want to end up being Leabnon.\nI assume that there are 100 mn hindus pay Rupee 6000 each year to Hindu welfare fund, then it can be sufficient for upbringing of children \nAlso try to send your children for education in vedic ashrams( Arya Samaj ones cost very less)  as there are lot of them in India. Its only way to cope this problem. No law of country can be made to follow by Muslims . So Hindus should be on streets if government tries to bring one child policy."<br />Author: 'Lopardest'<br />id: 'kgyk2d'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'Man Indian Babus are Ducking stupid'<br />Body: 'DoT left red-faced after Huawei given clearance to conduct equipment trials: \n\nRead on this [Article](https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/industry/article/dot-left-red-faced-after-huawei-given-clearance-to-conduct-equipment-trials/696141)\n\nIndian Babus are the worst and in my opinion they are keeping India from progressing from where it is.\nThese guys pass one exam and sit on many important decision making position all their life.

possibility of the world's first Hindu nation certain now - After millions protesting in Nepal for Hindu Rashtra, PM K.P Oli dissolves the parliament in the country stating that he's lost the majority's trust [News]"<br />Body: ' Nepal‚Äôs Cabinet recommended dissolving parliament in an emergency meeting on Sunday as Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli‚Äôs party said he had lost majority support.  \n\n\nMeanwhile, the Nepal‚Äôs Communist Party today said "The prime minister has lost the majority in the parliamentary party, central committee and the secretariat of the party," as quoted by reuters.  \n\n\n"Instead of seeking a compromise within the party he chose to dissolve parliament."  \n\n\n"PM Oli was under pressure to withdraw an ordinance related to the Constitutional Council Act that he had issued on Tuesday and got endorsed by President Bidya Devi Bhandari the same day," The Kathmandu Post newspaper reported today. It also said that today\'s Cabinet meeting was expected to recommend the replacement of the ordinance.  \n\n\nThe ordinance to amend the Constitutional Council Act was introduced on December 15, and allegedly undermined the principle of checks and balances. It allowed the Constitutional Council to convene a meeting if a majority of its members attend it. PM Oli then held such a meeting on December 15 evening itself, according to The Kathmandu Post.  \n\n\nProtests have been underway across the country in early December, where thousands marched in Kathmandu, the national capital, calling for a Monarchical restoration.  \n\n\nDemands for the restoration of the Hindu Monarchy in Nepal has been steadily gaining momentum in recent times. Two weeks after the first round of protests for the same, the Rashtriya Shakti Nepal on the 30th of November threatened the restoration of the ‚ÄòHindu Kingdom‚Äô status of Nepal through a peaceful movement. In the previous round of rallies, slogans such as ‚Äúmonarchy must return to save the country‚Äù and ‚Äúcountry above party‚Äù were raised.  \n\n\nAlthough the approval of President is awaited, the demands of the people might be heard and this could result in the first Hindu Nation in the world. \n\n[https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-s-pm-oli-springs-a-surprise-on-detractors-dissolves-parliament/story-eUa1HK4to31fOCUrKd5bVK.html](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-s-pm-oli-springs-a-surprise-on-detractors-dissolves-parliament/story-eUa1HK4to31fOCUrKd5bVK.html)\n\n https://www.instagram.com/p/CJAtoq4Bp8l/?utm\\_source=ig\\_web\\_copy\\_link'<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'kgruce'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: '‚ÄúTherefore if we want a happy and tranquil political situation, we must select leaders who eat K·πõ·π£·πáa prasƒÅda.

Please share your feelings, thoughts and opinions about it. Do you feel the same, what are you doing in your personal capacity.  So the story goes as follows.\n\nIt started a month ago when I stumbled upon randia subreddit. While browsing through the subreddit, I called out someone on their pseudo secularism in one of the posts. They banned me for the comment. \n\nI told the whole story to one of my friends and he was of the opinion that randia subreddit is a cancer(which I agree now) and suggested me to check out r/chodi. \n\nAt that time I was reading "Breaking India\'\' by Rajiv Malhotra. While browsing through chodi and watching the news/posts around, be it in TV channel, insta., twitter etc. I started to notice posts about the propagandas, bully tactics, anti hindu stances and narrative, pseudo secularism, commies, global narrative/ agenda about breaking india etc. Out of interest and curiosity, I started to go down the rabbit hole to see what this stuff was all about. In the due course, I discovered many facts, information, perspectives, videos, podcasts on topics about such as sanatan dharma and values, what is written in the vedas, indic history(not from the lens of the left), dharmic religions\' similarities, anti hindu narrative set by the left, distorted history taught to us in the school books by historians such as romila thapar and the colonial era britishers, what is written in quran and bible etc. \n\nSeeing how Viraat our culture is and how our generation including me does not even know about all these rich knowledge that the sanatan dharma has to offer, I thought of starting my journey to \n\n1.learn Sanskrit,\n\n2.read all vedas, upanishads, smritis, purans. \n\n3.read guru granth sahib, quran and bible\n\n4.read about the Indian history \n\nAll this to enlighten myself and to know first hand information from the source itself. I was thinking to equip myself with golden knowledge sanatan dharm and our history had to offer as well as to arm myself up with all the points and counterpoints from all the religions and the history.\n\nBut today, after watching some videos I found out that how the left, islamist , christans had been weaving the net of the brainwashing, propaganda, conversion, hindu hate since the independence and before. They have an army of intellectuals, academicians, bureaucrats, Baulanas, who are doing it systematically day in day out. \n\nI have observed one common point in everyone\'s opinion that hindus are not united which is the main problem. Also the right, RSS, BJP, any guru or institution are not churning out material and pushing a  narrative in a centralized manner. I mean all of them are contributing in their own capacity but there is a need for a coherent narrative that is based on fact to be agreed upon by all the stake holders and pushed in a systematic manner like the left and islamists have been doing.\n\nRealizing the vastness of all the work I felt that my entire life would fall short if I alone would do it. So I thought as it is not centralized (to my knowledge), we are already way behind or worst case- fighting a lost battle. So I was feeling helpless and depressed and thinking about it all day long. It was making me go insane.\n\nAt last with a heavy heart, I decided that first I will come to a position of power; be it political, bureaucratic or economical then only I will think of these things.'<br />Author: 'helloworld090'<br />id: 'kgfg6e'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'You guys seem to like cows .

He wanted to become immortal and so prayed to god Surya. Pleased with his penance, Surya appeared before him. Dambhodbhava asked Surya to make him immortal. But Surya couldn't grant this boon since anything, anyone who was born on this planet will have to die. Surya offered him to ask for something else instead of immortality. Dambhodbhava thought of tricking the sun god and came up with a cunning request.\n\nHe said that he has to be protected by a thousand armors and laid the following conditions:\n\n&gt;1. The thousand armors can be broken only by someone who performs penance for a thousand years!  \n2. Whoever breaks the armor should die immediately!\n\nSurya was horribly worried. He knew that Dambhodbhava had performed a very powerful penance and that he could get the entire boon he had asked for. And Surya had a feeling that Dambhodbhava was not going to use his powers for good. However having no choice in the matter, Surya granted Dambhodbhava the boon. But deep down Surya was worried and seeked Lord Vishnu‚Äôs help, Vishnu asked him not to worry and he would save earth by eliminating adharma.\n\n Immediately after getting the boon from Surya, Dambhodbhava started wrecking havoc on people. People were scared of fighting with him. There was no way of defeating him. Anybody who stood in his way was crushed by him. People started calling him Sahasrakavacha (one who has a thousand armours). It was around this time that King Daksha (the father of Sati, the wife of Shiva, who later incarnated as Parvathi) got one of his daughters, Murti married to one of the ‚ÄòManas putras‚Äô of Lord Brahma, the God of Creation.\n\nMurti had also heard of Sahasrakavacha and wanted to put an end to his menace. So she prayed to Lord Vishnu to come and help the people. Lord Vishnu pleased with her, appeared before her and said ‚Äò‚ÄòI am pleased with your devotion! I will come and slay Sahasrakavacha! Because you have prayed to me, you would be the reason for slaying Sahasrakavacha!‚Äô‚Äô.\n\nMurti gave birth to not one child, but twins- Narayana and Nara. Narayana and Nara grew up in the ashrama surrounded by the forests. They were great devotees of Lord Shiva. The two brothers learnt the art of warfare.The two brothers were inseparable. What one thought the other was always able to finish. Both of them trusted each other implicitly and never questioned the other.\n\nAs time went on, Sahasrakavacha started attacking the forest areas surrounding Badrinath, where both Narayana and Nara were staying. As Nara was meditating, Narayana went and challenged Sahasrakavacha for a fight. Sahasrakavacha looked at the calm eyes of Narayana and for the first time since he got his boon, felt fear building inside him.\n\nSahasrakavacha faced the attack of Narayana and was astounded. He found that Narayana was powerful and had indeed got a lot of power from the penance of his brother. As the fight went on, Sahasrakavacha realized that the penance of Nara was giving Narayana strength. As Sahasrakavacha‚Äôs first armour broke he realized that Nara and Narayana were for all purposes one. They were just two persons having the same soul. But Sahasrakavacha was not too worried. He had lost one of his armours. He watched in glee as Narayana dropped dead, the minute one of his armours broke!\n\n As Narayana fell down dead, Nara came running towards him. By his years of penance and pleasing Lord Shiva, he had gained the Maha Mritunjaya mantra (a mantra which brought back dead to life). Now Nara took the fighting with Sahasrakavacha while Narayana meditated! After thousand years, Nara broke another armor and dropped dead while Narayana came back and revived him. This went on until 999 armors were down. Sahasrakavacha realized that he could never beat the two brothers and ran away seeking refuge with Surya. When Nara approached Surya to give him up, Surya did not since he was protecting his devotee. Nara cursed Surya to be born as a human for this act and Surya accepted the curse for this devotee.\n\nAll this happened at the end of Treta yuga. Immediately after Surya refused to part with Sahasrakavacha, the Treta Yuga ended and the Dwapar Yuga started. To fulfil the promise to destroying Sahasrakavacha, Narayana and Nara were reborn ‚Äì this time as Krishna and Arjuna.\n\nDue to the curse, Dambhodbhava with Surya‚Äôs ansh within him was born as Karna, the eldest son of Kunti! Karna was born with one of armours as a natural protection, the last one left of Sahasrakavacha.  \nAs Arjuna would have died if Karna had had the armour, on Krishna‚Äôs advise, Indra went in disguise and got the last armor of Karna, much before the war began.\n\nAs Karna was actually the monster Dambodbhava in his previous life, he led a very difficult life to pay for all the sins committed by him in his past life. But Karna also had Surya, the Sun God inside him. It was Karna‚Äôs karma from his previous life that he had to take part of the all the evil things he did. But the Surya in him made him brave, strong, fearless and charitable. It brought him long lasting fame."<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'kg6675'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'Yeh ham longo ki nudity ke liye kyu pooch rahe hai Reddit wale, kisko nanga kardiya kamne??'<br />Body: 'Kripya comment section me shanti banaye rakhe aur line se randia ki ek ek Gali dete jaye'<br />Author: 'IGotPizza-'<br />id: 'kg61em'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'This sub made me realise i am not alone'<br />Body: 'With all the public shaming we guys get it makes us feel that we are all alone coz we seldom get like minded ppl in real life coz just like me they are afraid to come out in the open.

I asked you guys to vote and it was a tie between those who wanted this post and those who didn\'t. So I\'ve decided to make this post today. This is the second last post before the analysis of the 3rd Battle of Panipat. Enjoy)\n\n\n\nAhmad Abdali, was born in the Sadozai clan of the Abdali tribe of Afghans in about 1722 CE. After having defeated the Russians and the Turks, Nadir Shah of Iran, had set out of Iran to punish the Afghans for their actions. During his invasions in 1732 CE, he captured two boys, brothers, Zulfiqar and Ahmad. Ahmad, distinguished himself in Nadir\'s service, quickly becoming a favourite and rose to the command of 3000 troopers in Nadir\'s personal guard. He was with Nadir Shah when Nadir invaded Delhi. It is said that Nizam-ul-mulk who was known to read faces, said when he saw Ahmad Abdali, that he would one day be a king. When Nadir Shah was assassinated by his own trusted advisors, Abdali, took Nadir\'s seal, the Koh-i-Noor, valuables and a Mughal princess who was married to Nadir\'s son. He left for Afghanistan and took his troopers and many other Afghans with him, who elected him as their leader. And so, upon a Throne of dirt, with a crown of strewn grass, Ahmad Abdali, was made Ahmad Shah Abdali of Afghanistan. The Abdalis styled him Durrani Padshah or Pearl Among Kings and called themselves henceforth, Durranis. \n\n\n\n\nHe had claimed for himself, the provinces of the Mughal Empire that Nadir Shah had conquered which included Qandahar, Kabul, Peshwar, Lahore, Sindh, Ghazni, Hazara, Kohat, Bannu, Derajay, Qalat and Chahar Mahal. \n\n\n\nHe began his conquests for these provinces by taking Sindh. The Mughals sent an army under Safdar Jung of Awadh, and Ishwari Sigh of Jaipur. In the Battle of Manupur, Ishwari Singh disgraced his Rajput name and pride, by fleeing the field in the face of enemy fire and left Safdar Jung to struggle alone. Here the Nawab of Awadh proved that he was a patriot once again, and fought the battle bravely, his Awadhi troops consisting largely of Brahmin and Rajputs in infantry and Irani Shia cavalry, defeated the Afghans. Yet, the Mughals failed to take advantage of victory and allowed Nadir to slip away.\n\n\n\nWe now skip a few years ahead, to discuss his fourth invasion of India. This invasion was at the invitation of Najib-ud-Daulah and the Mughal Emperor\'s wife, as they were offended by Imad-ul-Mulk and invited Abdali to suppress him. Therefore, he had the opportunity to do what he had always desired. In January 1757, he was in Ludhiana, with Imad chastised, his troops went plundering and sacking cities mercilessly. They dragged away men\'s wives and daughters, so cruelly, that a large number of them committed suicide. Hindus were ordered to paint their foreheads and were beaten for failing to do so.\n\n\n\nNajib-ud-Daulah joined his forces with Abdali and with about 100,000 troops, they set out on their expedition to suppress Surajmal who had refused to surrender in person. On this occasion, Surajmal\'s pride would cost him and innocent people alike. Jahan Khan and Najib-ud-Daulah were sent out with 20,000 troops each, and another 20,000 marched under Abdali. They planned to make the the festival of Holi, their time of attack, to inflict the greatest offences upon their enemy. So they set out on 27th of February and planned an expedition which would last till 6th of March. \n\n\n\n\nIn Bulandshahr, a general slaughter was ordered and according to an eye witness account of Ghulam Hasan Samin, "unnumbered dead bodies flooded the streets".\n\n\n\nAt Mathura, Jawahir Singh, Surajmal\'s son, opposed them with 10,000 men but after killing 8000 Afghans and losing 4000 Jats, he returned to Ballabhgard. Once again we have an eye witness account of Ghulam Hassan - " I saw a number Bairagi and Sanyasi huts by the edge of the stream. These are ascetics of the Hindu faith. In each hut lay a severed head, with the head of a cow tied to its mouth by a rope around it\'s neck."\n\n\n\nAt Ballabhgard, the fort was captured and Jawahir Singh escaped to Kumbher where Surajmal was. Ghulam Hassan once again gives his account -" Horsemen set out with 10-20 horses each at midnight. They return with plunder and women captives atop the plunder. Male captives carry baskets on their heads, which have bundles of severed heads in them. For each head the Prime Minister pays Rs.5. Then the male captives are beheaded and the women ravished, whose screams deafen the ears of civilised men."\n\n\n\nAt Brindaban Ghulam narrates "At one place, 200 children lay dead in a heap"\n\n\n\nAt Gokul, "4000 Naga Sadhus, fought the Abdalis and each side lost 2000 men." At the behest of Jugal Kishore,  an agent of the Bengal Viceroy, who assured the Shah that there were only beggars and Sadhus in Gokul, Gokul Nath temple and its people were saved.\n\n\n\nAt Brindaban, the Afghans had encamped by the Jamuna, downstream from Brindaban. The water was choked due to dead bodies and the polluted water caused cholera in the Afghan camp and hence the Afghans retreated.\n\n\n\n\nOn his return, he sacked Delhi, took a 16 year old Mughal princess and her sister as wives. Along with 16 other women from the imperial harem.\n\n\n\n\nBefore returning to Afghanistan, he conquered Sarhind in 1757 and finally went back.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1758, Adina Beg Khan, Mughal Governor of Jalandhar Doab, allied with the Sikhs to push the Afghans out of Punjab. He then realised that soon the Durrani would invade once more and invited, the Marathas who were encamped at Delhi. Raghunath Rao accepted the offer and set out with a grand army. \n\n\n\n\n\nAnd hence, Raghunath Rao arrived to liberate Punjab and the west with Malharrao Holkar, Sakharam Bapu, Manaji Paygude, Gangadhar Bajirao, Hari Raghunath Bhide, Bapuji Trimbak, Renako Anaji, Gopalrao Ganesh Barve, Rayaji Sahdev, Tukoji Scindia, Narsoji Pandit, Khandoji Kadam and Vithal Shivdeo, assaulted any and all Afghans they encountered between Delhi and Attock. They took back Peshwar, Multan, Sarhind, Punjab and Lahore. Glorious celebrations were held and bazaars were offered to Raghunath Rao. Finally, the stage was set, for the Third Battle of Panipat.

I\'m more religious than most of my friends, but not really that religious on average. I go to temple on the big festivals and try to celebrate them all at home, but don\'t bend over backwards to get it right. I do pooja-paath when convenient and try to do it everyday. I donate to Hindu causes and temples, even donated a cow and all. \n\nBut when I lived with my parents, I was extremely against religion, hated Hinduism, was against all the rituals etc, hated going to temples. I would repeatedly berate people for superstition, wouldn\'t like to join in for poojas at home, and wanted to sleep in on festival days. \n\nI thought I had seen the light or something when I started living on my own. But it\'s actually more complicated than that.\n\nRecently my mother came to stay with me for a few months. We haven\'t stayed with each other for that long in several years because visas, responsibilities, jobs etc, so it was a bit of a new experience. My mother is typical mom, religious, very ritualistic, deeply devoted to our family deity\'s temple and the Shankaracharya. \n\nWithin two days we were back to having the same arguments about religion. I realized the issue is my mother is a product of her generation. \n\nHer parents were born a couple of decades before Independence and had several hungry mouths to feed in a country with very limited opportunities. They had a deep understanding of religion and old practices. But they just didn\'t have the bandwidth to teach the kids anything beyond the superficial. Usually this would have been imbibed from the culture, but they were first generation city dwellers and were removed from their larger context. \n\nAs a result my mom is sort of an andhbhakt. She doesn\'t know why any practices are followed, she just follows them. I on the other hand was raised to be questioning. She always could answer my questions on most things, but when it came to religion and rituals, there was no room to question the inconsistencies. \n\nThis works as a way to preserve the religion and pass it on. When we\'re apart, I ask her what to do for festivals and occasions, and then interpret it in my own way and do it, and use Google and other resources to figure out the meaning of things. Success.\n\nBut when we\'re under the same roof, she expects me to do the andhbhakt thing, and it annoys me to no end that she never questions anything. So many rituals make no sense and seem pointless and non-inclusive. So many practices just seem to only make life harder. A lot of the things she says are "important to good outcomes" aren\'t, because I see so many people around me who don\'t follow those practices and are doing better than me. \n\nIt\'s annoying when she attributes a bad outcome to not praying that morning, or because it was astrologically the wrong time to do something. She will also brook no criticism against all the random tv gurus on all the religious tv channels and YouTube. And she tells me my problems are all from questioning too much and not believing enough. \n\nAs a Savarkarite, this is all too much to take. I end up making extreme assertions as a result, like God does not exist etc. Under normal circumstances I\'m happy to be agnostic and offer prayers etc, but when belief becomes a cornerstone of life, I don\'t want to entertain it anymore. \n\nHinduism will do much better when more people welcome questioning and are happy to seek out primary sources and understand why something is recommended. Hinduism works better when people are not forced to take it up, or it makes very simple demands of people. \n\nThe only resource for questioning Hindus at least a couple of decades ago was the mainstream media saying things like "so much milk is wasted offering to God, why not give it to poor people". That gets coopted by anti-Hindu forces. \n\nWe have much more resources than a generation or two ago. We should be much more accommodative of seekers. That\'s the only way to stay relevant and grow.'<br />Author: 'sensitiveinfomax'<br />id: 'kfem5g'<br />Flair :MyBhagwaPillStory :pill:</li><li>Title: 'LIFE IS A SHIT'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'kfccbl'<br />Flair ::shit: Shitpost</li><li>Title: 'Shameless journalism.'<br />Body: 'https://mobile.twitter.com/agrawalmanindra/status/1339263938525949952'<br />Author: 'Trilokjit-Dey'<br />id: 'kfc0qk'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Butthurt OP</li><li>Title: 'US hack is so big and severe that it could cripple the entire Govt if information leaked or if the hackers decided to hit back'<br />Body: "Hackers got into US's nuclear security administration, their treasury department etc. Btw they had access to this since March.
