Resubmitted after removal'<br />Body: "My post got removed as linking other subreddits are not allowed.  Resubmitted. \n\nI will try to explain who am I and what my believes are and maybe you can help me figure out where do I stand in terms of the general wavelength of this sub.\n\nI am born in the Hindu religion to a normal household set in a communist area of Kerala. This means I used to go to temples very regularly and loved taking part and enjoying the religious cultural festivals like [Theyyam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theyyam) as well as took part and in the communist party and their programs. This was very normal around here and definitely wasn't an out of behavior thing. I had my Muslim classmates who invited us during Ramadans, and we happily went there for the food. We invited them for [Vishu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishu) too.\n\nGrowing up without a TV, I picked up reading from early childhood and spend a lot of time reading many genres. I started reading philosophy including religious literature since the beginning of legal adulthood and have been doing and thinking about the same for more than 7 years. Now I think many of my beliefs in that area are cemented. I used the theoretical (scripture) and practical side (practice in the current climate) of religions and political ideas and evaluated them using rationality and my own set of morality to get to the conclusions naturally that I did.\n\nI am an agnostic atheist. I don't believe in any god in the sense that I don't pray to any. I still do take part in the cultural festivals including Theyyam because it was a very defining factor in shaping who I am as a person and I find them morally solid. I consider myself a Hindu as disbelief in God or Gods has been a historically propounded viewpoint in many of the *Astika* (Orthodox) streams of Hindu philosophy. Thus if someone asks me *if I am a Hindu*, I would say *yes*. At the same time, if someone asks me *whether I am a Hindu or an atheist*, I would go with the a*theist*, as I think this person is asking whether I am a conventional practicing Hindu, and I am not.\n\nI find the concept of religions a very destructive element to society but have no problem appreciating good practices like many elements of Jain religious culture. At the same time, I realize they are exceptions and don't make up for the terrible side, starting from crusades to the recent France beheading incident and many many immoral legally solid practices in Saudi Arabia.\n\nI am a great fan of Hindu mythology and have been reading them for as long as I remember. I think the Character of 'Shiva' to be one of the most interesting characters ever. I don't pray to Shiva, but would love to listen to Shiva Keertans or hang his pictures at home. Now I know if I called Allah a character, Muslims would be offended and they have a theological reason to do that. I don't know if any of you would be offended by me calling Shiva the same, but it doesn't change my opinion. **I love him, I don't pray to him**.\n\nI completely despise the set of ideas called Islam and I think we as a species have been very tolerant to a set of extremely bad practices for the long term under so-called secularism. I hate that the left doesn't address the religious fascism and the vast majority of immoral ideas of Islam in the magnitude it should be addressed. I don't think any religion that advocates death for people who leave the religion has any role in the new world.\n\nMy approach to Christianity is similar to that of Islam. Completely against their theological arguments and I am glad the left calls them out on their respective countries (unlike Islam).\n\nThe left in every country criticizes the majority religion and their immoral ideas and I am all for that, as long as they do that accurately. I in no way support arguing for the right to abortion while wearing religious body coverings. Misogyny covered under religious freedom is still misogyny and the left has trouble understanding that. There is also the problem of the absence of democracy in certain Islamic countries that banked to some major terrorist movement, which in the roots has theological support that goes unaddressed.\n\nI am not a communist party member anymore as I see their practices in my own home state to be very authoritarian and violent. Regardless, I think their ruling is slightly better than the previous Congress govt. I vote on elections based on who the person is and what their policies are as well as what their win means in the big picture of Indian/Kerala politics. I only voted once, around 5 years ago I think, and I voted for a communist party member who I knew personally. I voted for him based on who he is and would have voted for him even if he stood for other parties as I believe in his policies, which turned out to be as good as I thought.\n\nI have no problem with appreciating good leaders regardless of their parties. In BJP, there are leaders I despise and leaders I admire. I also hate the commercialization or exploitation of Hindu philosophy by certain 'Guru's like Mata Amrithananda Mayi or Sadh Guru while I align and support the majority of Swami Vivekanandan's priciples. I practice meditation regularly and learned from my older uncle, who was a Guruswamy (i.e went to Sabari Mala every year and was a huge Ayyappa devotee). He called it dhyana which is a religious practice.\n\nAs I am writing all this I am guessing I might not be someone you like. You may even consider me as an enemy of Hinduism in some way. But, I consider myself a Hindu in a spiritual sense and there are many more of us. I am also realizing that my interests may align with certain other subreddits like ' Hinduism ' more. Regardless, I would like to know where do I stand in your political or religious landscape. I am not made with sugar and won't melt so be honest and brutal as it needs to be.\n\nI hope you are managing well in these times and I hope and wish you and your families all the best in overcoming these trying times. Have a good Sunday.\n\nUPDATE: I posted the same in 'India' and the post is removed by moderators, I am guessing due to incorrect flaring. I may try it one more time."<br />Author: 'bluewaterbottle9'<br />id: 'jyu86h'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'Free Our Temples - J Sai Deepak - #IndicTalks'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'jytu8o'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'So, I have just visited this sub and I am not sure if I am your enemy or friend, or are you mine?'<br />Body: "I will try to explain who am I and what my believes are and maybe you can help me figure out where do I stand in terms of the general wavelength of this sub.\n\nI am born in the Hindu religion to a normal household set in a communist area of Kerala.

An average hindu should be doing the following things:\n\n**1. Educate the women in your family.** It's difficult to be openly anti-interfaith with your friends. Your target audience should be your own family. Don't limit yourself to your sisters and daughters. If you're close with your relatives maybe educate them too. Women are naive, it's your duty to atleast educate the ones in your own family. \n\n**2. Groom yourself.** Muslim men are fetishized to a great degree. There's also a thrill that comes along when women rebel and enter a societally forbidden relationship. Only way to stop this is by making your own self desirable. Get off reddit, start working out, eat healthy, dress up like a normal human, don't be afraid to talk to women, take care of your hygiene etc. etc. (Refer grooming guides for more)\n\n**3. Socialise.** This is an extension of the second point. Be approachable and charming. Talk to people and be openly proud about your hindu identity. This will break the stereotype that orthodox hindus are boring and boomer-ish.\n\n**4. No sex before marriage people: find a viraat hindu chick, reproduce and raise viraat hindu kids. pro-casual sex people: fuck around with Mullis as much as you can** (goes without saying but do it consensually). Muslims did much worse with our women. Tit for tat.\n\n**5. If you're a grill be just be frank with your grillfriends.** Pretty sure there's atleast one muslim guy that your friend circle just drools over. When they talk about him just be honest with them about how you feel about dating muslims. Sugarcoat stuff if someone in your friend circle is already dating a muslim but never be stay silent because you're afraid of offending them. I'd anything you're doing them a favour.\n\nThese things are a bare minimum. I request all my bhratas and bhaginis to add more stuff in the comments."<br />Author: 'ApologeticallyEmo'<br />id: 'jysmy7'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: "I am Against no religion but oh well Santana Dharma was never a religion. 😐 .

Opposition, Ngos in secular nations ,in Islamic world and Communist countries just ignore. Is there any value being  proud Hindu ? Where other religious incentivise defend and protect you if you're from their community and hear people gate bases on mentality caste and political group . I feel I will give up on being agnostic as India is heading towards conflict as the Pakistani army and Arab fundoos want so.

But I think there was great demand for Islam as state religion and Sharia practices being in law. Hence Nehru Gandhi found the easiest and safest solution to escape from it I'll knowing Hindu community will suffer either way she to decentralised practices. I am ashamed of our history books cultural Marxism and targetting of only a grouped together faith under Hindu code bill as Hindus (which is actually a British driven term to identify non abhrahmics). Tribals and Sikhs later got separate identifications.Then came caste groups. Casteism infact is ingrained in subcontinent even in non Hindu groups people hid it. Padhmada Muslims and Jacobite Christian's I have talked to in my 2 year research on Interfaith Realities(I am data collecter-hobby). Told me realities hidden in media and books. When are we getting to have more knowledge than just rubbish Ncert filled with corrupted versions of Congress theocracy and praise.😠And No acknowledgement of Dharmic warriors and those who saved temples from Army of haters of idol worhsippers? Due to our education system Hindus are apologetic while Madrasa board Muslims are unapologetic hail Muslim rulers as hero while not knowing complete truth. Thankfully India wasn't fully converted Sikhs and Hindus were alive to tell the tails that aurangzeb and ghazni were monsters or look what Afghans and Pakistani books teach. Distorted to suite own versions. Shia Sunni divide as we know came due to this bias on agreeing to real history and versions. It's a fact the winners to live to tell the tails.  Truth wins says bhagwath Geeta gets chopped up for criticizing Prophet if religion of peace . 😂. A joke has played to us . Sanghi bigots let's mass convert since no one will protest against the fakery. I am deepshit tired.

And all of this should be done, at 1/10th the cost of the existing competition. Some PMs would quit, most would tell you have gone mad....\n\nThat was the enormity of the task that was being faced by **Govt Officials**, in 1977, who wanted to do something about the fact that only 6% of India, had access to safe water. For the layperson, the answer is, why don't they just get pumps....\n\n\nUnfortunately, most of the pumps then were too expensive, not mass producible, too varied and so fragile, that 75% of the pumps, were inoperable at any given point in time. And women found it difficult to use, which was bad, because 80% of the water collection was done by them...\n\n\n**Enter Swedish engineer, Oscar Carlsson and UNICEF.**\n\nHe took existing pump designs, added uniformed jigs &amp; fixtures, mounted it on concrete and ensured water quality. He even took inspiration from oil rigs which drilled in rocks. Result was the India Mk 2 water pump.\n\n\nThis ubiquitous water pump, revolutionized India. By 1995, more than 2.5 million pumps were installed, ensuring a pump for every 150 Indians. More than 500 million people got access to safe water. Water borne diseases like Cholera reduced...\n\nWater, the vital ingredient of life, was no longer inaccessible. Not only that, the pump was so sturdy, that it might have been made out of adamantium. Because of this, we started exporting them to African countries, to solve their water woes. And it was a success there too.\n\nMany countries imposed heavy duties on all the pumps apart from the Indian Mk 2 pump. The India Mk2 pump was a transformative development, which changed generations. It also was a symbol of Indian innovation and proof that if we wanted to so something, we could.\n\nThe India Mk2 pump changed lives. And ensured one Swedish dude named Oscar Carlsson, who most of us, have no clue about, will forever be in our histroy books, as a guy who changed India. There is a nice paper written about the Mk2 pump and its story.....\n\n\nhttps://www.ircwash.org/resources/india-handpump-revolution-challenge-and-change"<br />Author: 'Baku-Madarame_UsoGui'<br />id: 'jxlixo'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'What are your views on Osho?'<br />Body: 'What do you guys think of the controversial Guru?'<br />Author: 'slashinghunter45'<br />id: 'jxk7lg'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'Oxford Vaccine Profiteering: $5B profit for this Adar Bhosadiwaala'<br />Body: 'Why is the govt. of India allowing this sort of business in the name of health?

The kind of the exam that the aspirants have to go through, is based on colonial social theories, Leftist/Marxists theories of guilt like what’s wrong with us as a nation. \n\nThere’re no desi-centric theories. We don’t have our own theories on who we are. Everything is being imported. A bunch of people who think alike like west is being created. We’re outsiders in the way our own subject is being studied. \n\nWhat the West has given us becomes bible&amp; though, we have some Indian eliments, they’re very pejorative view of Indian ideas. For example they’re made to read The Hindu news paper which is anti-Hindu btw. In some or the other way it’ll always try to demonise the actions of government no matter how good they’re. Even the op-eds in the newspaper are being fed to aspirants as knowledge. They take Romila Thapar as an authoritative source. They should rather make them learn how to think&amp;to have their own mind as opposed to feeding one set of ideologies. \n\nSo precisely aspirants have to pass a very negative and discouraging test of ideology/dogma which is masquerading as a test of knowledge. So we are indoctrinating the ideology of west into our aspirants and turn them to masterminds of a western lens so that an alien group could rule over us. This is why our civil servants are so disconnected from the common people of our nation. \n\nForget about NCERT text books or some western media but the bureaucrats who’re supposed to govern the country are being fed with this kind of things. It’s shame even after supposedly 70 Plus years of independence we couldn’t get rid of this colonised system. It’s far more shame&amp;disgusting even after many years of BJP rule which is allegedly Hindutva party it has not taken any seminal step to reform the bureaucracy to get rid of this remote controlled colonialism. \n\n\nPlease do let me know your opinions on this issue.

These assemblies were to elect the members of constituent assembly. Separate electorate concept was implemented in the elections. Means, Muslims were to have their own separate represention in Muslim majority seats of each province. Provinces of then British India, which are now in India were:\nBengal\nPunjab\nBihar\nUP(United Provinces, later Uttar Pradesh)\nBihar\nCP(Central provinces. Today\'s Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh)\nBombay\nMadras\nAssam\nOrissa\nOut of these, Bengal and Punjab were partitioned. Assam\'s Sylhet district became a part of East Pakistan through referendum.\nLet\'s consider UP. In 1946 elections, 66 seats were declared Muslim seats and out of them 54 were won by Muslim League, which is roughly 82%. 1941 census report says, Muslim population in UP was 8,416,308. Very clearly. Next census took place in 1951. 1951 census report was created statewise. Because by then India had a federal structure. The report of UP doesn\'t directly tell the Muslim population (newly introduced political correctness. Thanks to Congress). It says that total population of Uttar Pradesh is 63,215,742 and Muslims are 14.28% of it, which is calculated to be  9,027,208. Provincial Elections were conducted, Muslim League was voted in thumping majority from Muslim seats, India was partitioned, and still the Muslim population in UP didn\'t decrease, instead some how it increased.\nSimilar patterns are observed in census reports of other provinces too. The psychology that created Pakistan still lives with us, right next door. Next time if someone says, "we loved India, that\'s why we didn\'t leave", never trust them even if they swear in the name of Ola or the book of Ola. They didn\'t leave because they couldn\'t. They didn\'t leave, cuz their lives were not as much threatened as the lives of Hindus in Pakistan. But they created Pakistan and they still live with us right next door.

The vedas have no caste system and nowhere does it talks about birth being a criteria for someone to be a brahman or kshatriya.\n\n\nVajrasuchi\xa0Upanishad based on samveda debunk caste system.\nWe need to work towards eradicating discrimination if we don\'t do that I can assure you that in next 20 years Brahmins will be treated worse than jews in germany thanks to all the propaganda by left and Jai Bhim Jai MIM and also some reality to it.'<br />Author: 'rTx_101'<br />id: 'jvxx6l'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li><li>Title: "He didn't suspect that these ranking systems are faulty or bullshit.

Was india habitable ?\n\nThe **Last Glacial Period** (**LGP**) occurred from the end of the Eemian to the end of the Younger Dryas, encompassing the period c.\u2009115,000\xa0– c.\u200911,700 years ago.\n\n**Last Glacial Maximum refugia** were places in which humans and other species survived during the Last Glacial Period in the Northern Hemisphere, around 25,000 to 20,000 years ago.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa and Australia were not affected by the glaciation although vast areas of them were too dry for human habitation of any sort, even by the most specialised and well-adapted foragers), and the Americas and New Zealand had no humans at the time. Therefore, the shelters were mainly in Eurasia(INDIA INCLUDED).\n\nVegetation of India (during this age) - Tropical Grassland(Majority) (Refer this map for more - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last\\_Glacial\\_Period#/media/File:Last\\_Glacial\\_Maximum\\_Vegetation\\_Map.svg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Period#/media/File:Last_Glacial_Maximum_Vegetation_Map.svg)) - it was not covered in icesheets or was not too dry!\n\n***Conclusion : So humans/homosapiens existed in India ,It was a habitable place with grasslands, it was one of the Last Glacial Maximum refugia ! Iceage doesn't proves lack of existence of some kind of Indian civilisation or religion.***\n\nHere I would talk about religion (and how it may have formed) on some scientific basis and evidences :(Taken from ***Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind*** \\- a book by Yuval Noah Harari)\n\nA brief History :\n\n2 million : Humans spread from Africa to Eurasia. Evolution of different human species.\n\n13,000 years ago : Extinction of Homo floresiensis. Homo sapiens the only surviving human species.\n\n*12,000 years ago: The Agricultural Revolution. Domestication of plants and animals.* ***Permanent settlements.***\n\nSo what happened after people started to settle up :\n\nAFTER THE AGRICULTURAL revolution, human societies grew ever larger and more complex, while the imagined constructs sustaining the social order also became more elaborate. Myths and fictions accustomed people, nearly from the moment of birth, to think in certain ways, to behave in accordance with certain standards, to want certain things, and to observe certain rules. They thereby created artificial instincts that enabled millions of strangers to cooperate effectively. This network of artificial instincts is called ‘culture’.(The Arrow of History Harari, Yuval Noah. Sapiens (p. 206). Random House. Kindle Edition. )\n\nHow many different human worlds coexisted on earth? Around 10,000 BC our planet contained many thousands of them. By 2000 BC, their numbers had dwindled to the hundreds, or at most a few thousand. By AD 1450, their numbers had declined even more drastically. At that time, just prior to the age of European exploration, earth still contained a significant number of dwarf worlds such as Tasmania. ***But close to 90 per cent of humans lived in a single mega-world: the world of Afro-Asia. Most of Asia, most of Europe, and most of Africa*** (including substantial chunks of sub-Saharan Africa) were already connected by significant ***cultural, political and economic ties.***\n\n**Can some kinda religion/faith/belief system (hinduism) existed 12000 years ago?**\n\n**Were early humans capable of forming such group/tribes/identities/culture which we can call an early from of hinduism.**\n\nHow did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold(having a larger group), eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction.\n\nLarge numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. Any large-scale human cooperation – whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe – i***s rooted in common myths that exist only in people’s collective imagination.***\n\n***Conclusion : Existence of religion/myth/faiths is as old as homosepians - and these myths/faith/same believes took a new form after Agricultural Revolution(12,000years ago) - so science doesn't deny presence of hinduism(may be in some different form) 12000 years ago - but supports it!***\n\nHarari, Yuval Noah.
