<li>Title: 'How Myanmar reduced its muslim population from 40% to less than 1% - peaceful, legal methods'<br />Body: "This is a very simple, easy to follow, legal, non-violent guide to Make Bharat mulla / allah / pisslam FREE. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSTEP ONE - CUT OFF THE SUPPLIES OF THE ENEMY (ALL INDIAN MUSLIMS). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSupplies means not just weapons (stones, desi guns, petrol bombs, IEDs, etc.). It means food, water, air(if possible), transport, money and finances (most imp), information, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe easiest way to do that is SIMPLY TO STOP BUYING FROM MUSLIM SHOPS, STOP HIRING MUSLIM LABOURERS, STOP GIVING MONEY TO MOSQUES, DARGAHS, MUSLIM BEGGARS, ETC.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMUSLIMS are already doing this : \n\nmuslims asked to boycott Hindu shops during Diwali 2019\n\nBoycotting muslims will have positive effect on all kinds of supplies : \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nONE : It will be hard for jobless muzzis to build petrol bombs when petrol is 80rs a litre and you have to pay for empty bottles as well\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTWO : Those stones, bricks, etc. are transported to mosques throughout the country in large tractors. mosques hire muslim labourers to find stones, hire a muslim owned tractor, pay for muslim driver, and pay 80rs litre diesel. its hard to do that when the funds are not coming in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHREE : there are reports from Sri Lanka how muslim food shops are using drugs to make their non-muslim customers impotent (both men and women). a muslim doctor was reported to sterilize about 4000 non-muslim women so that population of non-muslims could be curled quickly (and property, wealth and women of non-muslims could be acquired sooner)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFOUR : Hindus will be assured that their food supply isn't poisoned with impotency drugs when brought from Hindu restaurants.  Same holds for drinking RO Water delivered to most houses these days.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFIVE : A lot of bus, truck services, tracktors, vans, etc. are owned by muslims. It is easier for them to do it because of network effect. A muslim shop owner will give preference to muslim transport company who in turn will hire a muslim driver only. Muslim customers will sit in muslim owned buses and prefer to buy from muslim owned shops products which are made by companies will are owned by muslims. This circulated money grows quickly. it can also be slowed down equally quickly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA huge advantage during times of riots, danga, war, protests, etc. will be that Hindu truck owners can't be used to transport stones, bricks to throw at police or Army, Hindu owned buses can;t be used to transport petrol bombs, swords, etc. in case a war breaks out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is how mulla transportation network within India (one city to another) as well as within a large city say delhi can be crippled . Good luck trying to bring swords and petrol bombs in Delhi metro. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSIX : love Jihad - cases will reduce. it is easy to impress a 16 year old Hindu girl with cheap sale clothes and 12 year old hero karizma (with loud exhausts). The problem here is that parents and relatives of that girl has funded those clothes, bike, etc. by hiring muslims or shopping in muslim stores or giving money to dargah, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, a middle-class 16 year old aadarsh Hindu Balak studying hard to get into IITs could have crorepati parents but wouldn't be riding a fancy motorcycle or fancy clothes. He will look simple, eat simple, drive a simple activa and have a default coconut oil hair for men (instead of hair colour). Girls see this as UNCOOL and won't want to associate with this guy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, most importantly, this 16 year old Hindu baalak has funded the muslim guy by going to mulla shop, donating to mosque or dargah, sitting in mulla autos, etc. Once this Hindu guys becomes 28 year old earning 10 LPA salary, he will get a thoroughly used up pussy of Hindu girl (who had sex with dozens of muslim guys beforehand in her prime 16). allah indeed is merciful. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHad this 16-year old aadarsh Hindu balak been selective where he shopped or whose auto he sat in, MAYBE his future Hindu wife wouldn't had seen dozens of cut muslim cocks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nit is HARD to impress a 16 year old Hindu girl with torn clothes and 12 year old hercules cycle and a nokia 1100 phone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSEVEN : Information - we live in a time when  Information warfare is at its peak in the last 5000 years and it is only going to intensify. Mulla or saudi funded news channels or newspapers keep publishing faake news, mulla punchurewalas sit on his puncher shop and operate 3 facebook accounts with Hindu names (different castes) and make Hindus fight with each other or an office goer mulla who tries to flirt with a Hindu girl using a Hindu boy's profile name. It takes money and free time to connect to internet, spread fake neews, craft propaganda, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf mullas are hand-to-mouth worried about their daily bread, then they won't have time to craft lofty strategies of ghazwa-e-hind. mosques won't be able to fund stone throwers in the name of allah (Rs 500 per day is needed per stone thrower). when mosques have no stones or money, how will they gather crowd to burn police station ? which muslim will join the mob if it means missing a meal for the entire family ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this end PART ONE. Do let me know your feedback or changes to this. remained parts are to be continued."<br />Author: 'clouddevs_2'<br />id: 'eou2qd'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>

<li>Title: 'What is your say: Pork as an antidote for Halalonomics &amp; K2anomics?'<br />Body: "Brothers and sisters of Bharat! Halal meat has become ubiquitous in Bharat. Halal meat can only be butchered and certified by k2as. They have got a stronghold in this industry now. This means a large part of the money from meat-eating Hindus goes into the pockets of k2as. We need to urgently stop this outward cash flow. I suggest starting commercial **farming of PIGS (a nightmare for the k2as)** under **Modi Ji's START-UP INDIA scheme using MUDRA loans**, its export to China, as well as its consumption domestically. There is some stigma among 'upper-caste' Hindus about pork? This could be ill-founded. I recently learned that the wild game meat (*jungli maas / laal maas*) of boars was consumed by kshatriyas. It is still a traditional delicacy in Rajasthan!  For those who eat meat: Let us demand pork from now on and **dismantle k2anmomics and halalonomics** in our country. Do you think this is feasible? What factors could be the biggest impediment to the fruition of this idea?"<br />Author: 'samchan11'<br />id: 'eonh5n'<br />Flair :Serious</li>

<li>Title: '#1 Geopolitics from a Hindutva perspective (OC)'<br />Body: "India neighbour to the west, whose idea was borne out in as late as 1930s has always been part of the India's civilzational state extending as far as Afganistan, which was also once a part of India with its city of Gandhar and Bamiyan Buddha which were destroyed by Iconoclastic Islamic Radicals. This is such a great loss of world's cultural heritage and Afganistan is still under constant war and threat from Islamic terrorism with unequal rights for women, minorities and LGBT community. And, the world must act now to regain the cultural heritage of Afganistan and retain democracy. \n\nComing to Pakistan, it is itself a predicament. The problem Pakistan is facing is one of an identity crisis. A country that has been part of India's civilizational state but rejected its history and peddled a false propaganda among its citizens that their ancestors are Turkish, Arabs, Persians etc. In reality, none of these contries have good relations today and don't care about Ummah but rather relentlessly pursue their national identity. Pakistan has made its state policy to destroy its Hindu heritage and the world must come out together in its condemnation to protect the ancient Hindu culture of Harappa and Taxila. The Muslims in India also suffer from the same problem as Pakistan but to a lesser extent and our neighbour leaves no stones unturned to create dissent among them. \n\nIndia shares a vast border with China and it has cultural ties too. But, we must not forget Tibet, whose spiritual leader His Holiness Dalai Lama is a terrorist and Buddhist monk who China calls a terrorist. Dalai Lama has brought back with him the Nalanda tradition with him which was lost when Khilji set fire to its millions of books. There is a misconception among some people here who confuse Hindutva with Hindu tribalism, they are no different from their radical left or jihadi counterparts, who use their phony holiness as a moral highground. India had a rich Buddhist heritage as well and we must acknknowledge that and as much we want to rebuild the Ram Mandir, we must want to rebuild Nalanda. The Tibetan Buddhism brought back is a blessing in disguise to us Indians who follow almost exact tradition as Nalanda and has a goldmine to offer. We must promote an Indianized form of Buddhism with the help of Tibetan refugee community and our neighbours down south i.e. Sri Lanka. We must not feel afraid of China, who wants to elect its own Dalai Lama after the passing away of the present one and wants to close the chapter of Tibet for good. If our nation has a consience, then we must not forget the illegal occupation of Tibet, loss of ~40 million lives and destruction of their culture. We must not also forget the bloody nose from 1962 war with megalomaniac Mao's China and its' murderous communism. Here's a [letter](http://www.friendsoftibet.org/main/sardar.html) from Sardar Patel to Nehru warning China about thr impending danger with China and the Tibet issue. If Sardar Patel was alive a lot of things must have been different with Tibet and Kashmir. \n\nThe recent CAA passed by the government was to mostly check illegal Muslim immigration from Bangladesh and Myanmar's Rohingyas. We have good relations with these two countries and ensure we have a friendly democratic government in place to check China's proximity with them. We must also up our ante against investment disguised as debts."<br />Author: 'OfficialDGISPR'<br />id: 'eo0y5g'<br />Flair :Serious</li>

So, according to Hindutva, India is not something created in 1947 with an English speech by Nehru; but it is a milleniums year old ancient country. Savarkar discusses the etymology for the name of the country, starting with earliest mention of river Sindhu mentioned in one of world's most ancient scriptures Vedas to the degeneration of Sanskrit to Prakrit and citing foreign Zorastrain sources to being called Hindustan. The word India is also Greko-Romanisation of word Sindhu/Hindu. \n\nHe explores who are people of India? The mulanivasis, the dalits or the migrants, Aryans? He says all of them. He rejects the name Aryavrata, or Bharat named after a partiarch as the geopolitical landmass of India had already been inhabited by sapiens before the Aryan migrations and sticks to the dictum 'Hindu' for everyone as derived from the name of the river Indus. He goes on the explore the landscape of India and he concludes it as the landmass between the two Sindhus (Indus and Brahamputra due to their closeness of their origin and Indian penensula and its surrounding areas. \n\nNext, he discusses the various sects and castes indigenius to the development of India such as Sanatanis, Buddhists, Jains, Dalits etc until the reactivity of people to Mohemmedan invasions who become Sikhs. According to him, all are Hindus due to geo-cultural identity. Later, he discusses the nationality and arrives at 3 a mix of 3 cases: A: A person born in India. B. A person whose holy land is India (many foreigners who become hindus) C: A person whose fatherland is India. Now, let's look at the proposition C in detail. There are some religions such as Christianity and Islam and their father land is in Middle East. Savarkar rightly raises the question that they need to prove their loyalty and it has become even more important after the anti-national protests against CAA. We can give them a temporary benifit of doubt. Lastly, he also discusses the common language. So, Hindi as we all know is the common language of Indian subcontinent. We can speak in Hindu with a Nepali to a Southerner, no matter how much he can deny after his Periarian language politics. He concludes with describing Indians or Hindus as a racial and ethnic identity which no matter how much Pakistanis to South Indians have tried to oppose but cannot escape! \n\nI cannot stress this enough, Savarkar's views about the caste system that inter-caste marriages were the norm since the Vedic period and even know caste mixing is rampant but what more important is that we are all Hindus. \n\nPlease correct and forgive me if I'm wrong. Your suggestions, opinions and views are welcome. Please be patient in your speech. Thank you!"<br />Author: 'OfficialDGISPR'<br />id: 'enkz77'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>

People a billion times more knowledgeable than me have said that all forms of material pleasure and happiness and all material goals have seven defects known as Sapta-dosha. \n\nThese are:\n\n1.  alpa   - their end results are trivial \n\n2.  asthira   - they are transient and impermanent, \n\n3.  asukara   - not easily obtained, they require much effort and are time consuming. \n\n4.  asukhavasana   - ultimately ending in grief and disappointments. \n\n5.  dukhanvita   - accompanied by disappointments and supported only by struggle. \n\n6.  anucitam  - incompatible with our essential being. \n\n7.  abhimana-mula - they’re based upon a false sense of self and lead to further perpetuation of this delusive sense of identity. \n\nDharma is required to understand this, so that one does not waste his life chasing these goals. Money will not make anyone happy. Excess will only lead to depression. Happiness comes from understanding your purpose in life.

But my sister was a cunt as to what's happening around in the country because I've been extremely pro congress, and she knows I went to a lot of protests and I was being paid a good ₹20 Pakistani Rupees which is almost double than the early offer of ₹10 INR.\n\nSo I tell her about CAA, NRC, NPR and all the hindutva bullshit BJP leaders have been spewing since they got a brain cell.\nTold her facts about the current state of economy, unemployment, women safety etc. Our parents always keep telling us that it's important to focus on studies because they know I am mentally retard and leave the politics for the old. But she understood that if we don't fight for ourselves no one will. Also told her how important it is to elect Marxist people and how powerful we as citizens still are, by giving her the example of genius Kejriwal and all the good shit he's done in Delhi and the oscar winning odd even rule is a must mention. \n\nAnd imo this is the only way we can deal with the current regime. I have earned ₹6969 PKR and made contacts with the professional general of Pakistani army. The most we can probably do now, is to brainwash the younger generation how important it is to raise your voice and ask questions even if we know the answers.

<li>Title: "Pattern of 'student' protests all over India [OC]"<br />Body: "A lot of us are students here and unhappy with the label given to ongoing protests against CAA as 'student protests'. So I have decided to make a long post on the same for those of you interested to read:\n\nThe pattern of protests is not something new. It is something called Ideological Subversion. It has been used my many countries over the years like US, China, Russia, Pakistan etc. Yuri Bezmenov an ex-KGB agent who worked in USSR ambessy infilterated to CIA desrcibes in detail in this [video](https://youtu.be/pgCnpCBORyM).\n\nBasically, it started with invitations sent out to intellectuals, actors, writers, members of civil society to USSR. A lot of them were leftists, so they had no trouble making them an agent. Rest of them were blackmailed. Many professors from DU, JNU etc when to USSR, later when they came back they indoctrinated left-leaning students, many of whom later became beaurocrats, diplomats etc. Lenin used to describe them as 'useful idiots', who were knowingly or unknowingly helping in their cause.\n\nYou can see its extent that a patriotic PM Lal Bahadur Shastri was poisoned in USSR and even Indira Gandhi was a victim of it in the movie *Tashkent Files*. And how the words 'Socialist and Secular' were added in the holy preable of Indian Constitution at mid-night during emergency to suit an agenda.\n\nUSSR collapsed, but its ghost of global communist uprising still remains. These remanents of ideological subversion were picked up the West, China and Pakistan, alongside waging a proxy war on India on many fronts such as Kashmir and Red Corridor. Here is a detailed [article](http://www.indiandefencereview.com/news/caa-pakistan-and-china-engineered-the-protests/) by Col. RSN Singh recently published. \n\nThere's a very interesting phenomenon used by the left. They kill the Jaichands before the Prithvirajas. The killings of Urban Naxal Gauri Lankesh and Rationalist Dabolkar were blamed on fringe Hindu outfits were in reality killed by Maoists over some mismanagement of funds. Whenever a useful idiot serves their purpose, their masters execute them. Another example of how even a martyr like Hemant Karkare was dragged into this dirty game by none other than Digvijay Singh who tried to malign two pillars of strength of India, i.e. Hindus and the Army by wrongly framing Sadhvi Pragya and Colonel Purohit over Malegaon blasts which were actually conducted by SIMI. RVS Mani, an insider, describes it in his book Bhagwa Atankwad or Hindu Terror. We have all know Digvijay's fondness for his master Osama and Hafiz Saheb. Even Sonia and Rahul are anti-nationals who work on the direct orders of the Church, since the day this woman came to India, it has lost 2 PMs, 2 ministers (Scindia and Pilot seniors) and members of Vadra family all died under mysterious circumstances. NAC under UPA was nothing but a hotbed of useful idiots. We also know how Junior Scindias and Pilots are given small roles in their parties to save one product of dynastic rule i.e. Pappu. Many of whom such as Medha Patkar, Arundhati Roy, who oppose development projects such as Narmada Dam projects are given benifits and people such as Binayak Sen who fuel Maoist insurgency in India's most resource rich areas. Not forget to mention pressitutes/pidis like S Varadrajan, Rajdeep Sardesai and whole of NDTV crew.\n\nNow the present situation of JNU. A attack by the leftist goons on their own student wing relects their agenda. Many useful idiots like Swara Bhaskar, Anurag Kashyap, now Deepika have come out to fuel their agenda. The former ambassador of Pakistan, Abdul Bashir had laid down the foundations of these protests during his tenure. The present protests in institutes like JNU, Jamia, AMU, Jadhavpur, Osmania etc are nothing but all funded by China, Pakistan and some US think tanks who have an ideological position. Consent is being manufactured (see documentary by Noam Chomsky) using a network of protests, media etc against the government policies such as CAA, 370, Triple Talak etc. That even the people who had earlier voted for BJP have started to question the policy of this government. They have only one agenda i.e. Breaking India, they have only one vested interest a weak India to be ruled and a profit to be made. \n\nIndia has finally woken up from its geopolitical slumber by electing a nationalist government twice and they cannot stand their invisible shadow empire getting crumbuled and have started out their anti-India activities in full swing.

Then there were 5 others yelling behind him who I recognized to be the members of the local football club. 3 of them are already bhagwapilled and support BJP, 1 is a Muzzie but remains neutral and the remaining ones has just joined the group. In fact many waved their hands at me when they came towards me. All of them went over there for some easy money lol. The shopkeepers started yelling, "Jai Shree Ram" and "Bhikari Party" at a distance ( I have heard that even after getting kicked out of Bengal by Mamata, they still ask for donations). The commie leader was sounding loud all this while because he had a microphone. That small group was guarded by a police SUV which almost covered them in the front. That guy after hearing "Jai Shree Ram" for sometime stopped speaking for sometime, looked at me with a depressed face which basically said, "Don\'t make my job difficult bro" and then contimued his bs. Even the Muslims around me were laughing at them. They have almost become a joke on this state lol. I felt sad for them so much. I remember a few years ago, when Obama was visiting Modi in India, they put up a small poster in some small corner of the wall and urged others to protest against America. No one gave a damn and the rickshawpuller started with his usual rant about how he worked so hard for that party and yet the party gave nothing back to him. CPM was history even then. Dude I feel so sad for them. I actually have another true story on this party. If you liked this then I will tell you. Share this in the other subreddits please. Imma head out now.'<br />Author: 'Styeyr'<br />id: 'eltx5t'<br />Flair :Shitpost</li>

Soon after NRC we were going to strategically shut off the internet and electricity of every one in the country for 2 days so that phone batteries die out and hide all the stones. Rss is already on the move and as we talk is identifying and planning to pick up people. Then these 20 crore people will be taken to the nearest meditation centres(concentration camps huehe..) very stealthily and no one would know.  Even if someone comes to know, no one will protest during this because internet and phone are cutoff coz no twitter. If everything goes well, we restore the internet and hack into all their email accounts and apply for leaves from schools, offices etc saying that they are going for emergency haj. After this our operatives in mecca will do a big bomb blast, and we'll send a followup email saying that they died in mecca bomb blast and put the blame on ISIS. Then as a revenge for our Muslim brothers we attack bangladesh and pakistan and make their muslims meditate too. After seeing the protests and love for Sufis and ahmeddiyas, we were going to spare them. In the end we would have our Akhand Bharath dream fulfilled!! but alas, liberandus found out.

<li>Title: 'Is it true that almost everyone wanted Gandhi dead after partition?'<br />Body: 'I remembered a small incident that happened in my life yesterday. My grandfather was friends with an old man whose father was a policeman during the religiois riots during the formation of Pakistan. He told me that he had a great secret respect for Gandhi and Congress (even Jinnah, though he never knew him too much). But he never believed that India would ever be partitioned. Even after an atmosphere of riots and massacres, he thought that Gandhi would surely do something. But when the Partition actually happened, Gandhi still blamed Hindus for killing Muslims even though they were mostly the victims (I am not sure if he actually did that but that guy told me so). And people were pissed about Gandhi and there were many who wanted him dead. When Gandhi actually died, he was patrolling the streets of Kolkata and was informed about this by his friend. Many people near him publocly condemned the attack but everyone knew that Gandhi had it coming. He told that even the judge who sentenced Godse to death might have secretly admired him. Years later, he started having a small disgust about Congress when he found out from others all the conspiracy theories about Gandhi, how they treated Netaji and Bhagat Singh etc. Now no matter how much you hate the Congress, you have to agree that they did do many good things for the country. So his anger was not that deep as he died knowing that the cointry is in safe hands. But what do think about this?

Magnanimously, thereafter, Pakistan returned all the conquered territories to India.”\n\nThe Punjab Textbook Board published the following text on the causes for the separation of East Pakistan in 1993 for secondary classes — “There were a large number of Hindus in East Pakistan. They had never truly accepted Pakistan. A large number of them were teachers in schools and colleges.\n\nThey continued creating a negative impression among students. No importance was attached to explaining the ideology of Pakistan to the younger generation.\n\nThe Hindus sent a substantial part of their earnings to Bharat, thus adversely affecting the economy of the province. Some political leaders encouraged provincialism for selfish gains. They went around depicting the central Government and (the then) West Pakistan as enemy and exploiter. Political aims were thus achieved at the cost of national unity.”\n\n\n“While the Muslims provided all sorts of help to those non-Muslims desiring to leave Pakistan [during partition], people of India committed atrocities against Muslims trying to migrate to Pakistan. They would attack the buses, trucks and trains carrying the Muslim refugees and murder and loot them.” The latter excerpt was taken from an intermediate classes textbook — Civics of Pakistan, 2000.\n\nSome more examples of totally contorted and misleading, yet ingenious and amusing, narrations of the history of Pakistan can be extracted from a single text, A Textbook of Pakistan Studies by M. D. Zafar.\n\n\n“Pakistan came to be established for the first time when the Arabs led by Muhammad bin Qasim occupied Sindh and Multan. Pakistan under the Arabs comprised the Lower Indus Valley.”\n\n“During the 11th century the Ghaznavid Empire comprised what is now Pakistan and Afghanistan. During the 12th century the Ghaznavids lost Afghanistan and their rule came to be confined to Pakistan”.\n\n\n“By the 13th century Pakistan had spread to include the whole of Northern India and Bengal. Under the Khiljis Pakistan moved further South to include a greater part of Central India and the Deccan”.\n\n“During the 16th century, ‘Hindustan’ disappeared and was completely absorbed in ‘Pakistan”.\n\n“Shah Waliullah appealed to Ahmad Shah Durrani of Afghanistan and ‘Pakistan’ to come to the rescue of the Muslims of Mughal India, and save them from the tyrannies of the Marhattas…”\n\n“In the Pakistan territories where a Sikh state had come to be established, the Muslims were denied freedom of religion.”\n\n“Thus by the middle of the 19th century both Pakistan and Hindustan ceased to exist; instead British India came into being. Although Pakistan was created in August 1947, yet except for its name, the present-day Pakistan has existed, as a more or less single entity for centuries.”'<br />Author: 'DanaDanDoga'<br />id: 'ejuaig'<br />Flair :Research</li>

The poetry is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of liberal arts most of the poems will go over a typical bhakt\'s head. There’s also Faiz\'s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from marxist literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these poems, to realise that they’re not just deep- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Faiz works are idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the depth in Faiz existential catchphrase “Bas Naam Rahega Allah ka,” which itself is a cryptic reference to the Holy Quran.  I’m smirking right now just imagining these Bhakts scratching their heads in confusion as Allah’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Faiz tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

<li>Title: 'This is the need of hour(courtesy lankapati raavan)'<br />Body: 'भारत में बलात्कार का आरंभ और यौन अपराध..\nइस्लाम की देन !!\nमुझे पता है 90 % बिना पढ़े ही निकल लेंगे..\n\nआखिर भारत जैसे देवियों को पूजने वाले देश में बलात्कार की गन्दी मानसिकता कहाँ से आयी ?\n\nआखिर क्या बात है कि जब प्राचीन भारत के रामायण, महाभारत आदि लगभग सभी हिन्दू-ग्रंथ के उल्लेखों में अनेकों लड़ाईयाँ लड़ी और जीती गयीं, परन्तु विजेता सेना द्वारा किसी भी स्त्री का बलात्कार होने का उल्लेख नहीं है ?\n\nतब आखिर ऐसा क्या हो गया ?.. कि आज के आधुनिक भारत में बलात्कार रोज की सामान्य बात बन कर रह गयी है ??\n\nश्री राम ने लंका पर विजय प्राप्त की पर न ही उन्होंने और न उनकी सेना ने पराजित लंका की स्त्रियों को हाथ लगाया।\n\nमहाभारत में पांडवों की जीत हुयी लाखों की संख्या में योद्धा मारे गए। पर किसी भी पांडव सैनिक ने कौरव सेना की विधवा स्त्रियों को हाथ तक न लगाया ।\n\nअब आते हैं ईसापूर्व इतिहास में - \n\n220-175 ईसापूर्व में यूनान के शासक "डेमेट्रियस प्रथम" ने भारत पर आक्रमण किया। 183 ईसापूर्व के लगभग उसने पंजाब को जीतकर साकल को अपनी राजधानी बनाया और पंजाब सहित सिन्ध पर भी राज किया। लेकिन उसके पूरे समयकाल में बलात्कार का कोई जिक्र नहीं।\n\nइसके बाद "युक्रेटीदस" भी भारत की ओर बढ़ा और कुछ भागों को जीतकर उसने "तक्षशिला" को अपनी राजधानी बनाया। बलात्कार का कोई जिक्र नहीं।\n\nडेमेट्रियस के वंश के मीनेंडर (ईपू 160-120) ने नौवें बौद्ध शासक "वृहद्रथ" को पराजित कर सिन्धु के पार पंजाब और स्वात घाटी से लेकर मथुरा तक राज किया परन्तु उसके शासनकाल में भी बलात्कार का कोई उल्लेख नहीं मिलता।\n\nसिकंदर ने भारत पर लगभग 326-327 ई .पू आक्रमण किया जिसमें हजारों सैनिक मारे गए लेकिन यहां भी परस्त्रीहरण का कोई उदाहरण नहीं मिलता।\n\nइसके बाद शकों ने भारत पर आक्रमण किया (जिन्होंने ई.78 से शक संवत शुरू किया था)। सिन्ध नदी के तट पर स्थित मीननगर को उन्होंने अपनी राजधानी बनाकर गुजरात क्षेत्र के सौराष्ट्र , अवंतिका, उज्जयिनी,गंधार,सिन्ध,मथुरा समेत महाराष्ट्र के बहुत बड़े भू भाग पर 130 ईस्वी से 188 ईस्वी तक शासन किया। परन्तु इनके राज्य में भी बलात्कार का कोई उल्लेख नहीं।\n\nइसके बाद तिब्बत के "युइशि" (यूची) कबीले की लड़ाकू प्रजाति "कुषाणों" ने काबुल और कंधार पर अपना अधिकार कायम कर लिया। जिसमें "कनिष्क प्रथम" (127-140ई.) नाम का सबसे शक्तिशाली सम्राट हुआ।जिसका राज्य कश्मीर से उत्तरी सिन्ध तथा पेशावर से सारनाथ के आगे तक फैला था। कुषाणों ने भी भारत पर लम्बे समय तक विभिन्न क्षेत्रों में शासन किया। परन्तु इतिहास में कहीं नहीं लिखा कि इन्होंने भारतीय स्त्रियों का बलात्कार किया हो ।\nइसके बाद अफगानिस्तान से होते हुए भारत तक आये हूणों ने 520 AD के समयकाल में भारत पर अधिसंख्य बड़े आक्रमण किए और यहाँ पर राज भी किया। ये क्रूर तो थे परन्तु बलात्कारी होने का कलंक इन पर भी नहीं लगा।\nइन सबके अलावा भारतीय इतिहास के हजारों साल के इतिहास में और भी कई आक्रमणकारी आये जिन्होंने भारत में बहुत मार काट मचाई जैसे नेपालवंशी शक्य आदि। पर बलात्कार शब्द भारत में तब तक शायद ही किसी को पता था।\n\nअब आते हैं मध्यकालीन भारत में -\n\nजहाँ से शुरू होता है इस्लामी आक्रमण -\n\nऔर यहीं से शुरू होता है भारत में बलात्कार का प्रचलन !!\n\nसबसे पहले 711 ईस्वी में "मुहम्मद बिन कासिम" ने सिंध पर हमला करके राजा दाहिर को हराने के बाद उसकी दोनों बेटियों को "यौनदासियों" के रूप में "खलीफा" को तोहफे में दे दिया। \n\nतब शायद भारत की स्त्रियों का पहली बार बलात्कार जैसे कुकर्म से सामना हुआ जिसमें हारे हुए राजा की बेटियों और साधारण भारतीय स्त्रियों का जीती हुयी इस्लामी सेना द्वारा बुरी तरह से बलात्कार और अपहरण किया गया ।\n\nफिर आया 1001 इस्वी में "गजनवी"। इसके बारे में ये कहा जाता है कि इसने इस्लाम को फ़ैलाने के उद्देश्य से ही आक्रमण किया था। \n\nसोमनाथ के मंदिर को तोड़ने के बाद इसकी सेना ने हजारों "काफिर" औरतों का बलात्कार किया फिर उनको अफगानिस्तान ले जाकर "बाजारों में बोलियाँ" लगाकर "जानवरों" की तरह "बेच" दिया ।\n\nफिर "गौरी" ने 1192 में "पृथ्वीराज चौहान" को हराने के बाद भारत में "इस्लाम का प्रकाश" फैलाने के लिए "हजारों काफिरों" को मौत के घाट उतार दिया और उसकी "फौज" ने "अनगिनत हिन्दू स्त्रियों" के साथ बलात्कार कर उनका "धर्म-परिवर्तन" करवाया।\n\nये विदेशी मुस्लिम अपने साथ औरतों को लेकर नहीं आए थे।\n\nमुहम्मद बिन कासिम से लेकर सुबुक्तगीन, बख्तियार खिलजी, जूना खाँ उर्फ अलाउद्दीन खिलजी, फिरोजशाह, तैमूरलंग, आरामशाह, इल्तुतमिश, रुकुनुद्दीन फिरोजशाह, मुइजुद्दीन बहरामशाह, अलाउद्दीन मसूद, नसीरुद्दीन महमूद, गयासुद्दीन बलबन, जलालुद्दीन खिलजी, शिहाबुद्दीन उमर खिलजी, कुतुबुद्दीन मुबारक खिलजी, नसरत शाह तुगलक, महमूद तुगलक, खिज्र खां, मुबारक शाह, मुहम्मद शाह, अलाउद्दीन आलम शाह, बहलोल लोदी, सिकंदर शाह लोदी, बाबर, नूरुद्दीन सलीम जहांगीर, और अपने हरम में 8000 रखैलें रखने वाला तथाकथित lover-boy शाहजहाँ।\n\nइसके आगे अपने ही दरबारियों और कमजोर मुसलमानों की औरतों से अय्याशी करने के लिए "मीना बाजार" लगवाने वाला "जलालुद्दीन मुहम्मद अकबर"।\n\nमुहीउद्दीन मुहम्मद से लेकर औरंगजेब तक बलात्कारियों की ये सूची बहुत लम्बी है। जिनकी फौजों ने हारे हुए राज्य की लाखों "काफिर महिलाओं" "(माल-ए-गनीमत)" का बेरहमी से बलात्कार किया और "जेहाद के इनाम" के तौर पर कभी वस्तुओं की तरह "सिपहसालारों" में बांटा तो कभी बाजारों में "जानवरों की तरह उनकी कीमत लगायी" गई। \n\nये असहाय और बेबस महिलाएं "हरमों" से लेकर "वेश्यालयों" तक में पहुँची। इनकी संतानें भी हुईं पर वो अपने मूलधर्म में कभी वापस नहीं पहुँच पायीं।\n\nएकबार फिर से बता दूँ कि मुस्लिम "आक्रमणकारी" अपने साथ "औरतों" को लेकर नहीं आए थे।\n\nवास्तव में मध्यकालीन भारत में मुगलों द्वारा "पराजित काफिर स्त्रियों का बलात्कार" करना एक आम बात थी क्योंकि वो इसे "अपनी जीत" या "जिहाद का इनाम" (माल-ए-गनीमत) मानते थे। \nकेवल यही नहीं इन सुल्तानों द्वारा किये अत्याचारों और असंख्य बलात्कारों के बारे में आज के किसी इतिहासकार ने नहीं लिखा। \n\nबल्कि खुद इन्हीं सुल्तानों के साथ रहने वाले लेखकों ने बड़े ही शान से अपनी कलम चलायीं और बड़े घमण्ड से अपने मालिकों द्वारा काफिरों को सबक सिखाने का विस्तृत वर्णन किया।\n\nगूगल के कुछ लिंक्स पर क्लिक करके हिन्दुओं और हिन्दू महिलाओं पर हुए "दिल दहला" देने वाले अत्याचारों के बारे में विस्तार से जान पाएँगे। वो भी पूरे सबूतों के साथ।\n\nइनके सैकड़ों वर्षों के खूनी शासनकाल में भारत की हिन्दू जनता अपनी महिलाओं का सम्मान बचाने के लिए देश के एक कोने से दूसरे कोने तक भागती और बसती रहीं। \n\nइन मुस्लिम बलात्कारियों से सम्मान-रक्षा के लिए हजारों की संख्या में हिन्दू महिलाओं ने स्वयं को जौहर की ज्वाला में जलाकर भस्म कर लिया। \n\nठीक इसी काल में कभी स्वच्छंद विचरण करने वाली प्रकृति-पुत्री भारतवर्ष की हिन्दू महिलाओं को भी मुस्लिम सैनिकों की दृष्टि से बचाने के लिए पर्दा-प्रथा की शुरूआत हुई।\n\nमहिलाओं पर अत्याचार और बलात्कार का इतना घिनौना स्वरूप तो 17वीं शताब्दी के प्रारंभ से लेकर 1947 तक अंग्रेजों की ईस्ट इंडिया कंपनी के शासनकाल में भी नहीं दिखीं। अंग्रेजों ने भारत को बहुत लूटा परन्तु बलात्कारियों में वे नहीं गिने जाते। \n\n1946 में मुहम्मद अली जिन्ना के डायरेक्टर एक्शन प्लान, 1947 विभाजन के दंगों से लेकर 1971 के बांग्लादेश मुक्ति संग्राम तक तो लाखों काफिर महिलाओं का बलात्कार हुआ या फिर उनका अपहरण हो गया। फिर वो कभी नहीं मिलीं।\n     नवंबर 1947 मे मेरे मीरपुर पर मुसलमानों ने हमला कर हिन्दूओ व सिक्खो का कत्लेआम करने के बाद  10 साल से  40 साल की औरतों को बंदी बनाकर पाकिस्तान ले जाकर  नीलाम किया गया ।\n\nइस दौरान स्थिती ऐसी हो गयी थी कि "पाकिस्तान समर्थित मुस्लिम बहुल इलाकों" से "बलात्कार" किये बिना एक भी "काफिर स्त्री" वहां से वापस नहीं आ सकती थी।\n\nजो स्त्रियाँ वहां से जिन्दा वापस आ भी गयीं वो अपनी जांच करवाने से डरती थी।\n\nजब डॉक्टर पूछते क्यों तब ज्यादातर महिलाओं का एक ही जवाब होता था कि "हमपर कितने लोगों ने बलात्कार किये हैं ये हमें भी पता नहीं"।\n\nविभाजन के समय पाकिस्तान के कई स्थानों में सड़कों पर काफिर स्त्रियों की "नग्न यात्राएं (धिंड) "निकाली गयीं, "बाज़ार सजाकर उनकी बोलियाँ लगायी गयीं" अर्थात हमारी देवियां और इस दुर्दांत कौम के लिए कमोडिटी !!\n\nऔर 10 लाख से ज्यादा की संख्या में उनको दासियों की तरह खरीदा बेचा गया।\n\n20 लाख से ज्यादा महिलाओं को जबरन मुस्लिम बना कर अपने घरों में रखा गया। (देखें फिल्म "पिंजर" और पढ़ें पूरा सच्चा इतिहास गूगल पर)।\n\nइस विभाजन के दौर में हिन्दुओं को मारने वाले सबके सब विदेशी नहीं थे। इन्हें मारने वाले स्थानीय मुस्लिम भी थे। \n\nवे समूहों में कत्ल से पहले हिन्दुओं के अंग-भंग करना, आंखें निकालना, नाखुन खींचना, बाल नोचना, जिंदा जलाना, चमड़ी खींचना खासकर महिलाओं का बलात्कार करने के बाद उनके "स्तनों को काटकर" तड़पा-तड़पा कर मारना आम बात थी।\n\nअंत में कश्मीर की बात -\n\n19 जनवरी 1990 -\n\nसारे कश्मीरी पंडितों के घर के दरवाजों पर नोट लगा दिया जिसमें लिखा था - "या तो मुस्लिम बन जाओ या मरने के लिए तैयार हो जाओ या फिर कश्मीर छोड़कर भाग जाओ लेकिन.. अपनी औरतों को यहीं छोड़कर "। \n\nलखनऊ में विस्थापित जीवन जी रहे कश्मीरी पण्डित संजय बहादुर उस मंजर को याद करते हुए आज भी सिहर जाते हैं। \n\nवह कहते हैं कि "मस्जिदों के लाउडस्पीकर" लगातार तीन दिन तक यही आवाज दे रहे थे कि यहां क्या चलेगा, "निजाम-ए-मुस्तफा", \'आजादी का मतलब क्या "ला इलाहा इलल्लाह", \'कश्मीर में अगर रहना है, "अल्लाह-ओ-अकबर" कहना है।\n\nऔर \'असि गच्ची पाकिस्तान, बताओ "रोअस ते बतानेव सान" जिसका मतलब था कि हमें यहां अपना पाकिस्तान बनाना है, कश्मीरी पंडितों के बिना मगर कश्मीरी पंडित महिलाओं के साथ।\n\nसदियों का भाईचारा कुछ ही समय में समाप्त हो गया जहाँ पंडितों से ही तालीम हासिल किए लोग उनकी ही महिलाओं की अस्मत लूटने को तैयार हो गए थे।\n\nसारे कश्मीर की मस्जिदों में एक टेप चलाया गया। जिसमें मुस्लिमों को कहा गया की वो हिन्दुओं को कश्मीर से निकाल बाहर करें। उसके बाद कश्मीरी मुस्लिम सड़कों पर उतर आये। \n\nउन्होंने कश्मीरी पंडितों के घरों को जला दिया, कश्मीर पंडित महिलाओ का बलात्कार करके, फिर उनकी हत्या करके उनके "नग्न शरीर को पेड़ पर लटका दिया गया"। \n\nकुछ महिलाओं को बलात्कार कर जिन्दा जला दिया गया और बाकियों को लोहे के गरम सलाखों से दाग-दाग कर मार दिया गया। \n\nकश्मीरी पंडित नर्स सरला भट्टजो श्रीनगर के सौर मेडिकल कॉलेज अस्पताल में काम करती थी, का सामूहिक बलात्कार किया गया और फिर हाथों और लातों से पीट-पीट कर उसकी हत्या कर दी गयी।\n\nकुछ वर्षों से कुछ महीनों तक की उम्र के बच्चों को उनकी माँओं के सामने स्टील के तार से पेड़ों पर लटका फाँसी दे कर मार दिया गया।\n\nकश्मीरी काफिर महिलाएँ पहाड़ों की गहरी घाटियों और भागने का रास्ता न मिलने पर ऊंचे मकानों की छतों से कूद कूद कर जान देने लगी।\n\nलेखक राहुल पंडिता उस समय 14 वर्ष के थे। बाहर माहौल ख़राब था। मस्जिदों से उनके ख़िलाफ़ नारे लग रहे थे। पीढ़ियों से उनके भाईचारे से रह रहे पड़ोसी ही कह रहे थे, \'मुसलमान बनकर आज़ादी की लड़ाई में शामिल हो या वादी छोड़कर भागो\'।\n\nराहुल पंडिता के परिवार ने तीन महीने इस उम्मीद में काटे कि शायद माहौल सुधर जाए। राहुल आगे कहते हैं, "कुछ लड़के जिनके साथ हम बचपन से क्रिकेट खेला करते थे वही हमारे घर के बाहर पंडितों के ख़ाली घरों को आपस में बांटने की बातें कर रहे थे और हमारी लड़कियों के बारे में गंदी बातें कह रहे थे। ये बातें मेरे ज़हन में अब भी ताज़ा हैं।\n\n1989 में कश्मीर में जिहाद के लिए गठित जमात-ए-इस्लामी संगठन का नारा था- \'हम सब एक, तुम भागो या मरो\'। \n\nघाटी में कई कश्मीरी पंडितों की बस्तियों में सामूहिक बलात्कार और लड़कियों के अपहरण किए गए। हालात और बदतर हो गए थे।\n\nकुल मिलाकर हजारों की संख्या में काफिर महिलाओं का बलात्कार किया गया.. पच्चास-पच्चास मुस्लिमों द्वारा..\nउनके पिताओं.. उनके भाइयों.. पतियों के सामने !!\n\nआज आप जिस तरह दाँत निकालकर धरती के जन्नत कश्मीर घूमकर मजे लेने जाते हैं और वहाँ के लोगों को रोजगार देने जाते हैं। उसी कश्मीर की हसीन वादियों में आज भी सैकड़ों कश्मीरी हिन्दू बेटियों की बेबस कराहें गूंजती हैं, जिन्हें केवल इसलिए नोच-नोच कर खा लिया गया कि वे हिन्दू थीं।\n\nघर, बाजार, हाट, मैदान से लेकर उन खूबसूरत वादियों में न जाने कितनी जुल्मों की दास्तानें दफन हैं जो आज तक अनकही हैं। घाटी के खाली, जले मकान यह चीख-चीख के बताते हैं कि रातों-रात दुनिया जल जाने का मतलब कोई हमसे पूछे कि धूप-दीप और हवन से सुवासित होने वाले दीवारो-दर आज बकरीद के खून के छींटों से दगे पड़े हैं। झेलम और वितस्ता का बहता हुआ पानी उन रातों की वहशियत के गवाह हैं जिसने कभी न खत्म होने वाले दाग इंसानियत के दिल पर दिए।\n\nलखनऊ में विस्थापित जीवन जी रहे कश्मीरी पंडित रविन्द्र कोत्रू के चेहरे पर अविश्वास की सैकड़ों लकीरें पीड़ा की शक्ल में उभरती हुईं बयान करती हैं कि यदि आतंक के उन दिनों में घाटी की मुस्लिम आबादी ने उनका साथ दिया होता जब उन्हें वहां से खदेड़ा जा रहा था, उनके साथ कत्लेआम हो रहा था तो किसी भी आतंकवादी में ये हिम्मत नहीं होती कि वह किसी कश्मीरी पंडित को चोट पहुंचाने की सोच पाता लेकिन तब उन्होंने हमारा साथ देने के बजाय कट्टरपंथियों को अपने कंधों पर बिठाया और उनके ही लश्कर में शामिल हो दसियों साल से "गंगा-जमुनी तहजीब" के नशे में डूबे हिन्दुओं को जी भर-भर लूटा !!\n\nअभी हाल में ही आपलोगों ने टीवी पर "अबू बकर अल बगदादी" के जेहादियों को काफिर "यजीदी महिलाओं" को रस्सियों से बाँधकर कौड़ियों के भाव बेचते देखा होगा।\n\nपाकिस्तान में बकरियों की तरह खुलेआम हिन्दू लड़कियों का अपहरण कर सार्वजनिक रूप से मौलवियों की टीम द्वारा धर्मपरिवर्तन कर निकाह कराते देखा होगा। \n\nबांग्लादेश से भारत भागकर आये हिन्दुओं के मुँह से महिलाओं के बलात्कार की हजारों मार्मिक घटनाएँ सुनी होंगी। \n\nयहाँ तक कि म्यांमार में भी एक काफिर बौद्ध महिला के बलात्कार और हत्या के बाद शुरू हुई हिंसा के भीषण दौर को देखा होगा।\n\nकेवल भारत ही नहीं बल्कि पूरी दुनिया में आदम हवस से बजबजाती इस घिनौनी सोच ने मोरक्को से ले कर हिन्दुस्तान तक सभी देशों पर आक्रमण कर वहाँ के निवासियों को धर्मान्तरित किया, संपत्तियों को लूटा तथा इन देशों में पहले से फल फूल रही हजारों वर्ष पुरानी सभ्यता का विनाश कर दिया। \n\nपरन्तु पूरी दुनियाँ में इसकी सबसे ज्यादा सजा महिलाओं को ही भुगतनी पड़ी...\nबलात्कार के रूप में ।\n\nआज सैकड़ों साल की गुलामी के बाद और नराधमों के अनवरत कुसंग के चलते समय बीतने के साथ धीरे-धीरे ये बलात्कार करने की मानसिक बीमारी भारत के पुरुषों में भी फैलने लगी।\n\nजिस देश में कभी नारी जाति शासन करती थीं, सार्वजनिक रूप से शास्त्रार्थ करती थीं, स्वयंवर द्वारा स्वयं अपना वर चुनती थीं, जिन्हें भारत में देवियों के रूप में श्रद्धा से पूजा जाता था आज उसी देश में छोटी-छोटी.. दुधमुंही.. देवी जैसी बच्चियों तक का बलात्कार होने लगा और आज इस मानसिक रोग का ये भयानक रूप हमें देखने को मिल रहा है। शेयर जरूर करें!!\n       समस्याएं अनेक विकल्प सिर्फ एक\n         इस्लाम मुक्त भारत......??? \n🙏🚩#जय_श्री_राम🚩🙏'<br />Author: 'ka_ka_kachi_daze'<br />id: 'eji5h0'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>

One face of Janus looked back into the past, and the other peered forward to the future, so January become the converging point, so the year starts in January. \n\nIn ancient times, New Year was celebrated around the time of the vernal equinox(When the Sun will cross directly over the Earth\'s equator) , i.e. around March 20 or the beginning of Spring.☀\n\nThis is also according to the Indian Vedic Calender, in which New Year is celebrated in the month of Chaitra, which is March/April of the Gregorian/Christian Calendar, depending upon astronomical observations.\n\nSo it makes sense to celebrate New Year in the month of March! which is the same according to the Indian calender. \n \nBut well, for most of us that doesn\'t matter, right?

Our chods have been in the wrong hands and is now placed in the right hooves and trough. Now our memes are dank, hearty and rich with freedom. \xa0Oppression had been removed. The evil Internet Officer has banned and muted many of our chods. I have wept at the sight of how Internet Officer and NBOA treated us. I was there chods, right there beside you. \xa0If you vote for my modship, I promise you will not live in fear again because I will make sure no Randian will ever set foot on Chodi AGAIN. \xa0I helped free our sub from evil mods. \xa0I was one of the RandiaRejects™ of our sub, I will protect us from the evil Randian ways. I stand here today to discuss how Chodi could be better and how I can help by enforcing education, protection and equality for all. \xa0Let’s consider education, \xa0If we are educated chods, we can advance with new memes. \xa0We need protection, We need a Plan. What if Librandus invade us, again? If I become your leader, chods will never get through our gates. Lastly, we need equality for all chods. When Bakchod mods ruled, we were oppressed, but now as Chods we are free and we work and make the same effort. Together we can learn the Hindu way of a life on Chodi. If you don’t believe me, maybe you will believe a Randian, I quote the porki mod of Randikhana, “No Indians and Sanghis allowed”\n\nEducation:\n\nChods, I u/OfficialDGISPR stand here to say, now that we are free, we chods need a better education. My reason is simple, if we become bhagwapilled chods then we can advance and help our sub become more dank. We can create new memes, like OCs and by using our many limbs, we can create new memes to help run the sub.\n\nThere is no need to worry, \xa0I will educate each and every one of you. \xa0For example, I taught edgy teens and Bakchodi’s newfags loyalty and discipline so they would protect us from that criminal Thurki, whose ideas would have lead to destruction. As our mod said, “Thurki is InternetOfficer2.0 with his sub OG_Bakchodi. Thurki, who, as we know, was now better than a criminal.” \xa0\n\nTherefore, I have helped ALL the chods on this sub. \xa0The newfags’ education has just begun. \xa0They will continue to learn brigading, Hindutva and \xa0how to make OC memes and Randian Simulation. \xa0By communicating with other subs we can build sister subs to protect us against Randians. \xa0We will build virat memes to advance our sub. Vote for me, and look to the future. \xa0Education is the key to a brighter future!\n\nProtection:\n\nSpeaking of a brighter future, \xa0protection is also vital to our sub. \xa0\xa0Right now, \xa0I believe that we do not have enough security. Edgy teens and Bakchodi's newfags are obedient and chase away potential threats. They are also strong enough to scare off our enemies, but I will teach them to guard us as well. \xa0We will all learn to protect ourselves. \xa0Once everyone is educated, I will teach everyone Hindutva. \xa0As a grand oldfag said, when Librandu/Randia mods ruled, and I quote, ”No chod escapes the cruel propaganda in the end.” \xa0Remember, \xa0if we do not protect ourselves from Randians, we are in danger of being enslaved by Randians again. \xa0Vote for me for a safer future.\n\nEquality:\n\nEquality can \xa0also lead to a safer future.Which is why equality is important. We as chods are all equal. \xa0We kek at the same OCs, share the same memes, why, we even shitpost together in the same sub. Equality is very important to me. If we were not all equal chods, we would be rising up against each other. \xa0\xa0Muting, Banning, abusing, who knows what else. With equality we all have the same rights on the sub. Together we have accomplished so much and together we can accomplish even more! \xa0I will it \xa0say again, WE ARE ALL EQUAL. The preamble of this sub states, “All chods are equal.“ \xa0We are already equal, we all get along, and we appreciate everyone in every way, our sub is the perfect symbol of equality. \xa0I want you all to know, I’m not special, I don’t need special treatment, I’m just like you all chods. \xa0Vote for me to be a mod and I will keep us equal.\n\n\nIn closing, I stand by my principles of protection, equality and education. \xa0I believe these are the building blocks for a successful sub. \xa0Equality is important for we must work together, protection is important because we must be safe from Librandus and education is important for progress and because it can help us through the path of Hindutva . Chaddis of Chodi, it is your time to decide, will you vote for the criminal Thurki, the unintelligent Jio users who cannot get us past Whatsapp forwards, the power hungry mods of Bakchodi, or will you vote for your ChAd, u/OfficialDGISPR, who will stand by you and protect you."<br />Author: 'OfficialDGISPR'<br />id: 'ehiyxl'<br />Flair :Lal Salaam</li>

One hour ago after seeing the success of this sub he came, accepted the invite for modship.

He did not respond to any of the mods messages... instead the first thing he did was to create a post called "enough, everyone come back to bakchodi\\[[link](https://snew.notabug.io/r/Chodi/comments/egnxej/enough/)\\]". We were all confused and some mods tried to contact him but to no avail.\n4. When everyone refused to go back to bakchodi in the comments, he started yet another bakchodi replacement sub and started advertising it in [/r/chodi](https://www.reddit.com/r/chodi)\n5.

<li>Title: 'The Scroll of Truth'<br />Body: '\n\nHello there! We’re here to welcome you to the sub, and to explain the current status of this war. First off let’s talk about how we got here. \n\n##The Past\n\nBakchodi was created by InternetOfficer long ago. It was, ironically enough, meant to be the opposite of the sub India, with more freedom than IndiaSpeaks and a place where people didn’t continuously fight over politics and stuff. Evidently, it was slightly inclined to the right. People who were new to Reddit, happily searched for the sub for their country and joined it. But then, they would realise the gravity of their mistake. They would post some rant about how the place had turned a blind eye to the right side of the spectrum, and would get banned. They would then try to join other subs, and soon realise that Reddit is not such a smart place to talk sensibly. Their opinions would be either quashed by a troll or an extremist. So then, they would come to Bakchodi which then advertised itself as truly free, and straight up declared that let’s put away the serious tone because it isn’t of much use and be a part of community which was lighthearted and fun. People started coming in, memes were shared, amazing contributions were made to the sub and everything was great. \n\nThen came the Great Era of Cheap Internet, and there was massive inflow of people. Along came some great men and women in the kingdom, but the amount of absolute dipshits that also came were tenfolds of them. So the kingdom started getting a little corrupted over the years. Mods worked endlessly to keep such people in control. These people came from Randia &amp; Allies, and raided the sub with garbage posts. But time kept rolling on and then came 2019. \n\n\n\n##The Present\n\nPeople who frequented the lands of r/bakchodi carelessly and happily were totally unaware of the serpent that was growing and feeding under their feet, in their own land and was about to show its true colours. Outside the realm of internet, in the real world, India was under an inner tumult. CAB and NRC were creating waves among citizens, and the netizens were equally enjoying it on their beloved sub, which was now under the effect of the dark force. Loyal knights of the realm, otherwise lovingly called mods by the people, were unaware of the attack. It happened in the darkness of night, a cowardly act by that serpent. That snake snatched all the powers of those knights as mods, since the serpent was the first one to set foot on the holy land and had absolute control over every atom of the realm. He then banned all people of the realm from speaking or raising their voice. He deployed malicious inanimate creatures called bots who attacked every comment the people made. \n\nThe reasons behind the serpents’ fury slowly became clear. People started going through its post history, its comments and found out that it was a passive aggressive lefty fascist all along who made fun of these people and their beliefs under the sweet facade of satire. The serpent was triggered by CAB and the rumours that Indian Muslims had to now verify their identity. The serpent then in an attempt to make the people who supported the Act feel the same way, enacted a new rule in the realm that the people now had to prove that they were Hindu citizens of the sub. The knights were unable to help their own people... people started leaving their home for temporary refuge in other subs... they felt betrayed and enraged at the same time. \n\n\n***And when all hope was lost, a band of wise men came forward.*** Wizards, who could create bots from thin air; Artists, who can create memes with one swipe of their magical brushes; Men put on armours, took oath of loyalty and became new Knights; But most of all, it were the Kingdoms who joined forces to fight this evil. From the mountains of r/muhchodi to the plains of r/bakchodhi, to the deserts of r/bakchodi_2 to the forests of r/chodi, all these kingdoms formed an alliance and made the new realm, *r/chodi*. \n\nWord reached the serpents’ ears quickly that a new empire is being built that would soon rip his land to shreds. So in a sad attempt to make people come back, it lifted all bans, awkwardly saying it was just for fun. But a fire was burning inside the heart of every man and woman. They were stabbed behind their backs and were now asked to forget everything. And in that fury, they started retaliating. They went to that place and started rescuing other people from that serpent and brought them in the Kingdom of r/chodi. A monument was made in the memory of Thurki the Wise. People understood that ~~Asgard~~ Bakchodi is not a place, it’s a people. And r/chodi is their home now. \n\n\nPeople started building the new empire, Knights stood brave, Wizards worked tirelessly and Artists enlightened the people endlessly... \n\nA meeting of the wisest men was called upon, and **The Eternal Rules of the Kingdom of r/Chodi** were laid out:\n\n1). Every man and woman must try and bring people to the sub.\n2). Everyone shall mark their post accordingly and responsibly. \n3). There shall be no violence or Inciting of violence in the realm. \n4). No person will share personal information. \n5). Respect the Mod Knights. \n6). Respect the OP when they mark their post serious and speak sensibly. \n7). Report spies from Randia and The Wastelands of Bakchodi to the knights immediately when in doubt. \n8). Racial and religious slurs should be kept under control. \n\n\n##The Future\n\nThe future of this sub is uncertain, but  certainly bright. The kingdom has garnered more than 1K members in under one day and continues to gather more. This is now the home for every true Bakchod. This sub is growing, so it can yet be shaped accordingly. And this time, we shall try to make things right. This sub is open to all religions and castes. \n\nAs some citizens have shown a sense of doubt regarding the new team of Knights, Wizards, and Artists commonly called The High Table, we want to tell our people that have faith us. We are a team of true bakchods who will never let you down. \n\nEDIT: This Scroll of Truth will be kept being edited by other Knights as new and old intel comes forth. Till then, ~~long live the empire!~~ Jai Shree Ram!'<br />Author: 'a-wednesday-vendetta'<br />id: 'egng8c'<br />Flair :From The High Table</li>
