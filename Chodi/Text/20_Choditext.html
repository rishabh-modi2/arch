It includes three acts Farmers\' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.\n\nExactly how does this bill tend to achieve that? Well, the government has made plenty of changes.\n\nFarmers will be able to sell their crops outside of APMC yards / Mandis. Farmers will have no restriction on where they want to sell their product. This bill is designed to expand the areas for farmers to trade, with this the Farmers can trade anywhere in the country in "any place of production, collection, aggregation". It also gives farmers access to inter-state and intra-state trading. But it does not make APMC yards / Mandis obsolete as they will be functioning as always.\n\nProhibits State government to collect any market fees from trades, farmers or traders that happens outside of govt designated Mandis. This is done to make trades easier and cheaper.\n\nIt provides a legal framework for the contracts that are made between farmer/farmers and the buyer/buyers/buying firm. The government has taken care to ensure that farmers will not be taken advantage of as such as:-\n\n1. The farmer may only enter the agreement if it includes the time of supply, quality, grade, standards, price, and such other matters; and it includes the terms related to supply of farm services.\n\n2. The length of an agreement is a minimum of one crop cycle / one production cycle and up to 5 years maximum unless farmer and buyer agree on extending the length.\n\n3. Both parties can adopt a quality and grade standard and the buyer can check on crops during their cycle to ensure no problems arise on the day of deliver.\n\n4. The buyer will guarantee to pay for the produce which is mentioned in the agreement. The buyer will agree to pay a sum of a guaranteed amount to the farmer. An additional bonus or premium can be also specified to ensure the best value to the farmer and such price may be linked to the prevailing prices of APMC yard / Mandis, or any other suitable benchmark prices.\n\n5. The responsibility of picking up the trade at the designated time at the trade gate and make necessary arrangements for picking up the produce falls on the buyer.\n\n6. The payment to farmers should be done. In most cases, the farmers should be paid at the time when the buyer is accepting the produce and issue a receipt to farmers unless. In cases Where it relates to seed production, in which 2/3 of payment should be done when the agriculture produce is handed over and 1/3 of payment should be done after certification or within 30 days of trade.\n\n7. The agreement cannot be made to modify the land or erect a structure / change structures within it unless it is agreed upon and the structure is removed by the buyer by the end of the agreement. If the structure is not removed by end of the agreement than the structure will be owned by the farmer  \n\nIt makes a conciliation board to help with any disputes that arise within the agreement, the board will have the power to settle the dispute with the agreement of both parties. And if the dispute is not solved by the said board then the case will be taken to Sub-District Magistrate in which the Sub-District Magistrate shall have the authority of the civil court. This process is done so the farmers may not end up in the long battles in courts which usually drags for months if not year, and in this time the produce can go array.\n\nIt removes the limit added to cold storage for storing cereals, pulses, potatoes, onions, edible oilseeds, and oils, by removing it from essential commodities except under ‘extraordinary circumstances’. Rather than base the stock limit on the type of produce it tries to restrict it based on its increase in produce’s price.\n\nWhat are the concerns of farmers and people?\n\nQ) The MSP will be affected by removing the role of APMC yard / mandis.\n\nAns) False as the bill does not make APMC yard / mandis absolute and merely gives an option to farmers to trade their produce outside the mandis and also do electronic trades. Since doing this will not have any charges on trades by the government. The farmers can sell in APMC if they wish to. The mandis are removed so the farmers can sell anywhere they wish. This bill also removes the restrictions on inter-state trades and pushes the idea of ‘One India, One Agriculture Market’.\n\nQ) The government will not buy crops or will not buy crops under MSP.\n\nAns) The government mainly buys wheat, paddy, and pulses. This bill mentions nothing of as such about govt not buying the wheat, paddy, and pulses as they used to buy and it is likely government will not stop doing it since they need these crops for various schemes they run.\n\nQ) The government wishes to trade land to big corporations\n\nAns) False, as this bill bars any modification to land in its agreements. And farmers will always have the choice to not trade with these corporations if they chose to.\n\nQ) The states that have abrogated the APMC act has degraded their agriculture industry\n\nAns) Contrary to popular belief many states allow contractual farming and have made changes to APMC. The example that many people give to point out faults in allowing these changes is Bihar. As even Rahul Gandhi tweeted how Bihar was ruined due to these changes. But let’s see some facts.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/cvs6ok342e461.png?width=961&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bda615d8d6694bdca5857e5b58af4ad5b54ea5db](https://preview.redd.it/cvs6ok342e461.png?width=961&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bda615d8d6694bdca5857e5b58af4ad5b54ea5db)\n\n(Source: The Print) \n\nAs you can see Bihar is doing better than the national average in spite that Bihar has less land for cultivation as compared to let’s say Punjab. Yes, the Bihar’s farmer earns less as of now but they used to earn even lesser and now their industry is growing at an exponential rate as compared to Punjab’s growth which is regressing. The cycle of wheat -paddy – wheat is what is destroying many state\'s land and agricultural produce. This law tries to push a variety of crops for production.\n\nQ) Farmers will not receive their due.\n\nAns) As mentioned above the law covers the basic right of farmers, which is to ensure they get considerable profits from their produce, and it has given many guidelines to ensure that. Like Farmers getting the price of their produce at the exact time of selling it, unless it is seed production in which they will receive 2/3 of their price on trade and 1/3 within 30 days at most.\n\nQ) Removing the limit on storage will increase the price for wheat, etc.\n\nAns) The bill states that the crops for which the storage limit has been removed are food items including cereals, pulses, potato, onion, edible oilseeds, and oils. The government has also ensured that the restrictions will be imposed but not pre-determined from start but will be imposed based on the increase in the price of crops. So, if the price of a certain crop for example if the price of Potato increases by a lot then the government will impose restrictions on its storage so more potatoes will be sold in the market.\n\nQ) The government is taking the right of farmers to go to civil court in case if a dispute arises between buyer refuses from conditions of agreement made.\n\nAns) The government has not taken the right of Farmers but the government has given the power of the civil court to SDMs since it can take very long to reach the case in courts and SDMs will act and hold the authority of the civil court in their decrees to settle the disputes. This will ensure that farmers will receive justice in due time.'<br />Author: 'TheManWhoSayHello'<br />id: 'l6tbje'<br />Flair :National 📰</li>

The problem is holding a parade parallel to the republic parade itself because this is an open contempt of the existence of the republic and a direct challenge with authority of the state the republic the parade is not of the government of India that is not the parade of the prime minister more that is not the parade of BJP.\nThe parade is Indias, it is the parade of the republic of India. To try to undermine it. To prop up a rival one Is the problem. And they did not stop there. They attacked the red fort itself the red fort is a symbol of the modern Indian state, this is the place from where the democratically elected prime minister of India addresses the nation on the independence day. \n\nIt's not about the prime minister in question, it's not about the political party in question, this is about the post or the prime minister itself, this is about the symbolism of the red fort itself.

I understand it was very well  orchestrated  plan of BJP to kill the growing  popularity of the protestors in one single day. I really applaud the thinktanks of BJP who designed this plan and the protestors became a easy prey on an historical day where every Indian will be watching  the TV and condemn the incident. \nRoutinely, if this type of incident happens in any part of the country and if the situation goes beyond control, the Army will step in and do a Flag March which was missing yesterday. \nWell planned 40 days protest was crushed in a single day without changing any single clause in the legislation. *Really a master stroke by Amit Shah and his team....*"<br />Author: 'rishivyas879'<br />id: 'l6p8nj'<br />Flair :National 📰</li>

<li>Title: 'Viewing Indian Politics through the Western Lens'<br />Body: 'Indian politics are being viewed through a western lens and it does not do them justice.  \nThe concept of "Left wing - Right Wing" are western concepts and I don\'t believe Indian politics should be viewed through that perspective.  \nNow firstly there is no economic right wing in India. Elections are won on promises of subsidies and reservations. Secondly people just believe that certain parties are right wing and the others are left because the media consistently refers to them like that however they wouldn\'t be able to tell you even 3 policy decisions of those parties that justify their position on the political spectrum.  \nFor Instance, BJP is traditionally viewed as a "right wing" party but are they though ? ask yourself if you can think of 3 policy decisions that have been enforced by the BJP that can be identified as traditionally right wing ? You might say that the farmers bills could qualify as one such decision but lets not forget those reforms had been on the congress manifesto as well.   \nAs for the repeal of section 377 from the IPC that has now led to the decriminalisation of homosexuality, the supreme court had written a letter to the congress as early as 2012 asking them what their opinion was on the section and the congress explicitly replied that it should still be a crime. However when the BJP was in power and the SC asked them for their opinions, the BJP didn\'t have a strong opinion and it allowed the court to take a decision themselves which eventually led to its decriminalisation, a decision which the BJP happily accepted.  \nThis is just among many examples that I can think of where policies have defied the apparent stance that parties are believed to have.'<br />Author: 'FightPatriotFight'<br />id: 'l4ts7x'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

I cannot see a better example why the state has no businesses deciding what to do with a private company, same thing happened with the nationalization of banks by our beloved "When a big tree falls, the earth shakes" sahiba.\n\nThis is only one example, there are many more such examples where the nehruvian socialist policies wrecked our economy.\n\nThat being said the government should give air india back to the Tatas, cause govt can keep on pumping tax payer money into a sinking ship with the hopes that it will keep the ship afloat. \n\nAlthough the tatas have air Asia, this will do some good to the employees of air India, plus tatas can have all the slots in all the airports that belong to air india. Maybe with their financial muscle and business acumen they can turn this company arround.\n\nMaybe it\'s time for india as country to go private.\n\nWhat do you think of this?

<li>Title: 'The Bhupinder Singh Files (Source: Freedom at Midnight by Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins) Also, search about who is his grandson. There is a treat for you after you do this.'<br />Body: "   \n\n&gt;Bhupinder Singh demonstrated a remarkably refined aptitude for an equally worthy princely pastime, sex. As he came into maturity his devotion to his harem eventually surpassed even his passions for polo and hunting. He personally supervised the steady accumulation of its inmates, selecting new recruits with a connoisseur's appreciation of variety in appearance and accomplishment in action. By the time the institution reached its fullest fruition, it contained 350 ladies.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;During the torrid Punjab summers, the harem moved outdoors in the evening to Bhupinder's pool. The prince stationed a score of bare-breasted girls like nymphs at intervals around its rim. Chunks of ice bobbing in the pool's water gave the hot air a delicious chill while the Maharaja floated idly about, coming to port from time to time to caress a breast or have a sip of whiskey.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The walls and ceilings of Bhupinder's private quarters were covered with representations of the erotic temple sculptures for which India was justly famous, a catalogue of copulative possibilities to exhaust the most inventive mind and athletic body. A wide silk hammock slung in one corner of the room allowed Bhupinder Singh to suspend the laws of gravity while attempting to perform in that state some of the more complex maneuvers suggested by his ceiling.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To satisfy his insatiable habits, the imaginative Maharaja embarked on a program that would allow him to remodel the charms of his concubines as his own taste changed. Sir Bhupinder opened his harem doors to a parade of perfumers, jewelers, hairdressers, beauticians and dressmakers. He even kept a team of French, British and Indian plastic surgeons on standby to alter the physiognomies of his favorites according to the Maharaja's fluctuating tastes or the dictates of the London fashion magazines, which reached the palaces in a regular flow. To further stimulate his princely ardors, he converted one wing of the harem into a laboratory whose test tubes and vials produced an exotic blend of scents, cosmetics, lotions and philters.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;All those piquant refinements ultimately only served to screen the fatal weakness in the Maharaja's Oriental pleasure dome.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What man, as handsomely en- downed by nature as Sir Bhupinder was, could satisfy the 350 highly trained and motivated ladies lurking behind the harem's grilles? A recourse to aphrodisiacs was inevitable. His Indian doctors worked up a number of savory concoctions based on gold, pearls, spices, silver, herbs and iron."<br />Author: 'Meet_Me_In_Heaven'<br />id: 'l3ceku'<br />Flair ::oc-: OC है BC!💡</li>

<li>Title: "My Family's History With Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose"<br />Body: 'Today is Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose\'s 125th birth anniversary. All these years, I\'ve never told this incident to the public that\'s related to Netaji. My maternal family had relations with Netaji\'s family. My maternal family and Netaji\'s family used to be very well-off, both of them being super rich, owning multistoreyed bungalows at the time. My mother\'s grandfather used to be the President of the All India Business Group. They also had relations with the big Congress leaders. All of this was in the 1930s.\n\nOwing to this, my grandmother\'s (my mother\'s mother), uncle\'s, mother-in-law was friends with Netaji\'s mother, Prabhadevi Bose, who was also a social activist and a politician. The mother-in-law had a Narayan\'s idol, made of stone, in her house\'s temple. Once, after the death of Netaji hit the news in 1945, Netaji\'s mother visited the mother-in-law\'s home, and told her that "If I get the news about Subhash being alive, I\'ll come and install an umbrella (chhatra) made of gold for this Narayan\'s idol. Well, a few days later, Netaji\'s mother visited the mother-in-law\'s home and installed a gold umbrella for the Narayan\'s idol 😉🙂'<br />Author: 'maithunmama'<br />id: 'l3a76q'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>

<li>Title: 'Farmers have given the government the upper hand by rejecting the 18 month suspension of farm laws offer.'<br />Body: "In what exposes the farmers movement as bare faced obstructionism and dirty extortion, the farmers have rejected the government offer to meet their demands half way by suspending the farm laws for 18 months.\n\nThis is just the latest of the governments offers to be rejected.  Initially the government offered to discuss specific provisions of the farms laws which the farmers found wrongful and to negotiate the language for those provisions.  The farmers insisted that they wanted the farm laws to be repealed.\n\nWhen the matter went to the supreme court, the court instituted a panel to explain the farm laws to the farmers.  While this has been represented as the court abdicating its responsibility, it actually shows that the supreme court finds nothing untoward in the laws.  They carefully selected eminent lawyers who understood the laws to explain the provisions to the farmers, the way only a lawyer can explain the law to their layman clients.  The panel was rejected by the farmers and liberals were quick to point out that the panel was comprised of people who were always in support of the farm laws.\n\nwell, duh!  what the court was looking for was lawyers who understood the farm laws.  the fact that they agreed with the laws only shows that the laws were good.  it is worth noting that the panel members were, in addition to being lawyers, understanding the farm laws, and supporting the farm laws, also not really fans of the ruling government.\n\nthe agitating farmers have rejected each and every offer made by the government.  this last offer to suspend the laws for 18 months was an effort to get the confidence of the farmers and get them disband from their protest site while negotiations continue with the government.\n\nthe farmers did not outright reject this offer.  if they had done that, they could have been given benefit of doubt besides points for conviction.  instead they asked for a day to respond.\n\nwhat did they do in this day?  it is very likely that the government offer to suspend the law for 18 months was something the farmers had not foreseen and were unprepared for.  the fact that they asked for a day to respond confirms two things.  one, that the farmers sitting across the table with the government does not have the autonomy to negotiate with the government.  two, and more importantly, the fact that they were not prepared for government offer of moratorium means they have a different game in mind.\n\nso it is very likely that the farmers communicated with the people who are managing them.  the fact that the farmers asked for a day to respond made it inevitable that they will reject the offer.  the people who are managing them told them nothing doing.  they want what they paid for.\n\nthe protesting farmers now find themselves trapped.  the reasonable offer of 18 month moratorium should have been accepted.  by rejecting this offer, the farmer protests are now that much more difficult to defend.\n\nthe next action by the indian government would be 'our every offer was rejected.  now we are withdrawing from the talks.'\n\nthe government will not ask the farmers to disband.  nor will the government force the protest to disband.  they will just walk out of the negotiations and let the farmers continue their peaceful protests for as long as they need.  the emphasis on peaceful.\n\nthe farmers have three moves left.  disband and go home, continue protesting peacefully, or become violent.  if the farmers are really autonomous, they will do the first thing.  if they have some measure of control over their actions, they will insist on doing the second thing.  but, as is becoming evident, if they are puppets completely under control of some other powers, they will be forced to do the third thing.\n\nso government walks out, farmer protests turn violent.  what next?  well the world has seen that the farmers are irrational and unwilling to negotiate.  the world has also seen that farmers all over the rest of the country are reaping the benefits of the new farm laws.  if this farmer protest turns violent, it will be impossible to support them.\n\nunfortunately that is all that is left to happen.  so people in delhi best move out of there for a month or so."<br />Author: 'homeyside'<br />id: 'l2hry4'<br />Flair ::news: Unverified</li>

There are a couple of times that Krishna says quite clearly that other than him, all are lesser and worshiping them will not lead you to him.\n\nI am doing this because according to me, there is no fucking way in hell that those abrahamic cult gods are the same as ours. \n\nBhagavad Gita verses, using Ramanujan's translation: \n\n7:07\n\n&gt;मत्तः परतरं नान्यत्किञ्चिदस्ति धनञ्जय।  \nमयि सर्वमिदं प्रोतं सूत्रे मणिगणा इव।।   \n&gt;  \n&gt;I am absolutely superior to all in two ways: 1) I am the cause of both the Prakrtis and I am also their controlling master (Sesin). This controllership over inanimate nature is exercised through the animate Prakrti (the Jivas) who form the inner controller (Sesin) of their bodies which are constituted of inanimate nature. 2) I am supreme to all in another sense also - as the possessor of knowledge, power, strength etc., in an infinite degree. There is no entity other than Me with such attributes of an eal or superior nature. The aggregate of all the animate and inanimate things, whether in their causal state or in the state of effect, is strung on Me who abides as their Self, as a row of gems on a thread. They depend on Me.  \n\n7:20\n\n&gt;कामैस्तैस्तैर्हृतज्ञानाः प्रपद्यन्तेऽन्यदेवताः।  \nतं तं नियममास्थाय प्रकृत्या नियताः स्वया।।  \n&gt;  \n&gt; All men of this world are controlled, i.e., constantly accompanied by their own nature consisting in the Vasanas (subtle impressions) resulting from relation with the objects formed of the Gunas. Their knowledge about My essential nature is robbed by various Karmas, i.e., by objects of desire corresponding to their Vasanas (subtle impressions) born of their Karmas and constituted of Gunas. In order to fulfil these various kinds of desires they take refuge in, i.e., seek and worship, other divinities who are regarded as different from Me, such as Indra and others, observing various disciplines, i.e., practising rituals which are specially meant to propitiate only these divinities. \n\n7:23\n\n&gt;अन्तवत्तु फलं तेषां तद्भवत्यल्पमेधसाम्।  \nदेवान्देवयजो यान्ति मद्भक्ता यान्ति मामपि।।   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The men of small understanding means those whose understanding is poor, who worship only Indra and other divinities. The fruit of their worship is small and finite. Why? The worshippers of divinities like Indra go to the divinities. And Indra and other divinities possess limited joy and live only for a limited time. So if they attain eality of enjoyment with them, they also fall down along with them in due course; but My devotees, knowing that their acts are of the nature of My worship, renouncing attachment for finite, fruits, reach Me, having for their purpose the pleasing of Me alone. That is, they never more return to Samsara. \n\n8:16\n\n&gt;आब्रह्मभुवनाल्लोकाः पुनरावर्तिनोऽर्जुन।  \nमामुपेत्य तु कौन्तेय पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते।।   \n&gt;  \n&gt;All the worlds, from the realm of Brahma included in the Brahmanda (cosmic sphere), are spheres in which experiences conferring Aisvarya (prosperity and power) can be obtained. But they are destructible and those who attain them are subject to return. Therefore destruction, i.e., return is unavoidable for the aspirants for Aisvarya, as the regions where it is attained perish. On the contrary there is no rirth to those who attain Me, the Omniscient, who has true resolves, whose sport is creation, sustentation and dissolution of the entire universe, who is supremely compassionate and who is always of the same form. For these reasons there is no destruction in the case of those who attain Me. He now elucidates the time-period settled by the Supreme Persons will in regard to the evolution and dissolution of the worlds upto the cosmic sphere of Brahma and of those who are within them. \n\nTl;dr - Just because Vishnu/Brahma/Shiva/Shakti can be the same does not mean lesser beings like the christian god or islamic god are the same. \n\nAt least, this is what I think after reading these verses. What do you guys think?"<br />Author: 'Darkstorm999'<br />id: 'l1vjez'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>
<li>Title: "BJP also has UCC in its manifesto. Do you guys think that this will happen? Let me quote the text from BJP's 2019 manifesto."<br />Body: "&gt;Article 44 of the Constitution of India lists Uniform Civil Code as one of the Directive Principles of State Policy. BJP believes that there cannot be gender equality till such time India adopts a Uniform Civil Code, which protects the rights of all women, and the BJP reiterates its stand to draft a Uniform Civil Code, drawing upon the best traditions and harmonizing them with the modern times. \n\nI mean as per me, this might be the next logical step for Modi and Shah. There will be widespread protest as before of course but this will significantly polarise society and help us gain more political mileage.\n\nIt will another one of Atalji's dreams which might come true. Do let me know what you think. I always learn a lot because of you guys' opinions.

<li>Title: 'Mobocracy over democracy??'<br />Body: "\n\nThis government is setting a terrible precedent by staying the implementation of farm bills. This is state accepting the defeat and conceding ground to the Anarchists. The interest of a pressure group with in a state is forcing the government to rescind a law duly passed by the parliament. A fringe group has been successful to stay a legally passed economic reform in both the houses, signed by the President through plain and simple thuggery and vile protesting mobs in the streets by holding the capital ransom. Will of majority people which represents democracy is being superseded by a small pressure group in a country of billions, only because this pressure group has succeeded in gathering enough crowd to demand attention of the whole nation. Doesn’t this amount to death of democracy?? \n\nEvery law has a potential for abuse. That cannot be an excuse for rescinding the laws. A fringe protest by a vested group is able to halt a law duly passed by parliament within just 2 months. What signal would it send to the other vested interest groups in India? No matter whether your cause is justified or not you can force the government to rescind a law duly passed by parliament if you can hold Delhi at ransom for 2 months. What if this becomes the standard template for the rest of the term? Indian democracy has been lowered to such level that a mob of thousand people (not sure about the number) can bring it down in a country of billions. \n\nWhat use is 303 seats if you don't know how to wield the power?"<br />Author: 'Im_impossible'<br />id: 'l1vclw'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

So it's clear narendra tomar is fucked. \nSo I thought this is my thinking (feel free to comment your or share your views) it would be fun to see both sides sparring with each other over farm laws and government trying to refree them, so I suggest let's grab a bucket of popcorn and watch the shitshow which begins now. \nPS I am not justifying the suspension it's wrong you shouldn't do that you show your weakness."<br />Author: 'amogha128'<br />id: 'l1uolo'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
<li>Title: 'I saw a lot of people criticizing Modi and Shah about what happened with their decision to suspend farm laws for 1.5 years. I wanted to say something about it.'<br />Body: "First of all, I want you people to stay strong. Don't just give up this easy. Do you think Modi and Shah don't realize what is being done? They do. They both removed article 370 which was considered to be almost impossible by people like Omar, Shehla, and Mehbooba.\n\nWe need to stay positive during these trying times. And we need to put our absolute trust in both of them. They know what they are doing. Remember, they are after all the last hope for us Hindus. You should not expect them to do nothing about all this shitf\\*ckery.\n\nThey will fight back and do something which will push the opposition on the back foot again. Just wait and watch. And again I would like to say that we need to stay strong. The whole point of these so-called farmers' protest was to sow a divide between Sikhs and Hindus. \n\nModi knew that we cannot afford to do this and he has done the needful to protect the unity of Sikhs and Hindus. Might look like Sikh appeasement but it is necessary. We can't afford to be labeled as Anti-Sikh.\n\nAnyways let me know what you think about my opinion."<br />Author: 'Meet_Me_In_Heaven'<br />id: 'l1umer'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

We keep hearing about this masterstroke , that masterstroke but the Majority of his tenure is over and nothing has been accomplished. CAA NRC still not implemented. Farm Bills held captive by a couple thousand protestors from 1 state. \nForget Econom for a second, what have they done for Hindus? Not a single law passed that benefits or even puts Hindus in the same place as others. Just one Mandir built, that too by the same court that is staying the farmer's laws. UCC not even in talks right now. It's only the ordinary Hindu voters who have stood up for their religion while being ostracized by wokes and foreign media as equivalent of white supremacists and if anything, peacefuls have gained sympathy even though not a single policy was made against them. PM Modi is not the same CM Modi. He loves being serenaded by the woke and international establishment. He's not willing to go down in the trenches for his people, like Trump was.\nHe has become a sickulaar who just wants to have a good public image, which is stupid since people consider him an evil Fascist anyway.

My reasons for leaving are personal, but understand that I'm not leaving out of spite or contempt, rather simply to persue personal goals in life and to accomplish goals that have been otherwise sidetracked as of late, because of what I feel is an overindulgence in online debates that go nowhere and ultimately mean nothing.\n\n\n\nI have participated regularly and extensively in debates against those who have provided false information about history or those who have made incoherent and nigh malevolent representations of history.\n\n\n\nAmong the many topics that I have debated so stubbornly on is AMT, which for those of you who don't know is Aryan Migration Theory. It's what I believe in, it's what the facts prove to me and its what I'll continue to believe in. I won't make a point to leave behind an encyclopedia of data and information as a last hurrah, that would be childish and spiteful.\n\n\n\nThere have been many of you who have appreciated my posts, my comments and have expected me to remain active and to those I say, do not expect me to leave forever, there's a small chance I might come back. Take that for what you will.\n\n\n\nAnd to the friends I've made on this sub and on another we may call our own, I'd say, hopefully, in a while, when and if I do return, I'll have achieved what I wanted and the reason for my absence will have been fulfilled.\n\n\n\nWith all that said, I'll be signing off, with a couple of lines, that I feel have always uplifted my spirits and truly define the way I look at life.\n\n\n\n“Aaqabat  Manzil-e-Ma Wadi-e-Khamoshan-e-Ast\n\n\nHaliya Ghughula Dar Gunbad-e-Aflak Andaz”\n\n\n“The end of all our lives is the cemetery, \n\n\nPresently, raise tumult in the sky’s vault”\n\n\n\nFarewell."<br />Author: 'PushyamitraShunga1st'<br />id: 'l0xmsm'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

<li>Title: 'Our Views and Apology on Aryan Migration Theory.'<br />Body: "For Past couple of days i am witnessing heated debate between people who Support AMT and OIT here and i didn't say anything because of some reasons but now i feel like i have to.(I am the guy who posted with proof that Aryans even when they were in Europe were Dark Haired/Eyed people, sadly i deleted it because i thought no one is going to read it later.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n=========\n\nThe Aryans were from a Ukraine and Middle Russia originally, **Fatyanovo Culture** in Middle of Russia was the start of the Ethno-Genesis of Indo-Iranian People as a whole and as they migrated towards South from **Abaseno, Sintasta and Andronovo culture they picked up large number of Middle Eastern/IVC type Ancestry from the people who used to live in those Regions.** \n\nThe **Fatyanovo who had only 21% people with Blond hair and 25% people with Blue eyes were already losing those features and Sintasta had even less % of Those features as they were mixed with Middle Eastern Type people** of that region according to Anthropologists and Razib Khan confirmed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Fatyanovo are earliest Indo-Iranian\\/Aryan people or start of Indo Iranian Nations](https://preview.redd.it/9lqj0c5z5bc61.png?width=599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b9f1b07a7c0c2ccab10c8a48c8e719d2eebdc16)\n\n**80% of them had moderately light to Brown skin.**\n\nthey were Semi Pastoralist people and **mixed with Middle Eastern type BMAC culture of Southern Central Asia heavily** as well, it took them **800+ years to move from Fatyanovo to India. even before they entered into India, They mixed Heavily with Indus valley type Neolithic People heavily as well.**\n\n**so by the time they entered into India, they were half IVC type Neolithic people, The Earliest Indo-Aryan Cultures we have of SWAT, Cemetery H shows that Indo-Aryans had IVC like pottery and earlier they had BMAC type pottery because they intermixed with natives of India.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLearn from Europeans :\n\n**today, Yamnaya like Ancestry is highest in Scandinavia only, it is 50%+-, that means rest of their ancestry is from Dark skinned blue eyed hunter gatherers and Dark eyed IVC/Iran/Anatolian neolithic Farmers! high % of blond hair today happend because of various selection pressure there, a recent development. they those Eurpoes who have minority Yamnaya ancestry are proud of it despite many have non R1a/R1b lineages such as l1 and l2 who were earlier natives who were assimilated.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwhy did i say this ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**because Indians are today Similar people**, we have **Brahmins** who have **30/40% ASI, 30/40% Indus valley ancestry and 20/30% Steppe  ancestry** and we have **Dalits** who have **40/50% ASI, 30/40% Indus valley and 10/15% Steppe ancestry today!** \n\n**we are a Mixed people! all of India, regardless of their caste or Community have at least 1/5(20%) to 3/4(75%) ancestry that is similar to Indo-Aryans. then why do we dont Accept it and accept them as part of our ancestors instead of Fighting and Name calling each other ? we all are Descendants of Aryans, Indus Valley Farmers and Hunter Gatherers of India, first Native! why cant we accept all of these people as our ancestors at once like Europeans do ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthat being said, **I have no Part in Any of your AMT or OIT Debate that is going on and if i said something that hurt your feeling earlier i would like to apologize for that alongside** u/pleaseanyonekillhim , **we consider all of Indians as our brothers and sisters as genetically, religiously and culturally we are ! we Are Proud Hindus and Proud Indians.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni hope you guys will understand our point, if you have any questions, feel free to ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthank you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n===\n\n(I Hope this post will not get Brigaded by any AMT or OIT Camps.)"<br />Author: 'VishwamitraSunuh'<br />id: 'l0m7p4'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
