Under the Indian Arms Act only licensed police officials, NSGs can use it also under the situation where its use is found reasonable from the perspective of a reasonable officer who at the time was present in the scene. The law also limits the use of any dangerous individual and not on them who passively resist arrest.\n\nUnder the Indian Arms Act, 1956 prohibits the possession of those arms which could be a threat to public peace or public safety which were of much greater magnitude compared to law and order. Hence on the basis of it, the concerned act prohibits a civilian in possessing a stun gun.\n\nThe use of stun guns in India is restricted to police officials only. No person other than a police officer can use it as it can be highly misused, as has been mentioned above.\n\nPossession, sale or use of stun guns in an area where it is a ban or by a person who is not authorized by law to acquire it, can result in heavy fines or imprisonment or both.\n\nUnder law use of stun guns without authorization can lead to assault and one could be punished for this crime.'<br />Author: 'bibyanaman'<br />id: 'g0d8ke'<br />Flair :Research</li><li>Title: 'Time To Use Stun Guns against Radicals within Copuntry'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'g0d6un'<br />Flair :Research</li><li>Title: 'Question'<br />Body: 'What\'s worse, a Malayali Christian telling a Punjabi Hindu whose ancestors lost everything in partition,"Why you north Indians keep talking about partition, why you Northies so obsessed with Pakistan" or a Bengali Communist telling Bengali Hindus who have lost families in the 1971 genocide,"Why do you feel anguish at Muslims ?"\n\nThese people talk about privilege but don\'t realise the privilege that they themselves are coming from.'<br />Author: 'Resurgence28'<br />id: 'g0d3qh'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'India and hindu hating commie has been taught a good lesson'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'g0az6y'<br />Flair :From Twitter</li><li>Title: 'Dilli bhejo'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'g0asah'<br />Flair :From Twitter</li><li>Title: 'BJP ki saazish..!!'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'g07rdd'<br />Flair :Bakchod News</li><li>Title: 'So much for vasudhiava kutumbakam'<br />Body: 'Modi is sending supplies and medical equipment for free to other countries, while countries like US are hoarding supplies from us.

HISTORY IS TOO IMPORTANT TO BE LEFT ALONE TO HISTORIANS!'<br />Body: '# History is too important to be left alone to Historians!\n\nSo recently I have taken upon myself to create well-cited notes on the history of ***Bharat!*** \n\nso I was going through all the authors for citations and I noticed some strange things\\~\n\n&gt;How does one make a civilization weak and emotionally and intellectually vulnerable?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It is simple you just take away the only pride that one might have and whitewash that to make them believe that they were barbaric LOWER IQ people who could not manage anything on their own! So they put all that morally depressing things in our History Books! \n\n*So I noticed some strange things! All the post-NEHRUVIAN/INDIRA reign our History books started getting hijacked by the* ***Leftist/Assumed Centrist/Marxists.*** *Any Uninformed Nibba if reads those books then all he will think is that OUR HISTORY is pathetic and we were a bunch of savages who were colonised by INVADERS/HUNS/TURKS/GREEKS/MUGHALS/EUROPEANS/BRITISHERS and everything came from them!*\n\nBut the reality is far away from it! One will only feel sad and depressed if one reads those books! \n\nLike I was referring ***UPINDER SINGH*** book on ancient India history and her pejorative of referring to ***GUPTA EMPIRE*** was so visible! She apparently the daughter of Former PM Manmohan Singh! No wonder she might have been involved in "CONGRESS RAJDARBAR" to get politically entrenched! But she is smart! From her writings, she will call out  Marxist Historians and Nationalist School of thought historians that we should look at history without bias! But then she always takes a U\\~Turn. All this is   "HISTORY AL TAQIYA" and she slowly starts injecting ***MARXIST BIAS*** in her books! By reading her books one will hardly feel any pride! SO instead of getting our chest swollen up with pride, it sinks in with low self-esteem!  Unfortunately, she is an EMINENT PROF in Delhi University! So according to her GUPTA EMPIRE IS NOT THE GOLDEN AGE OF INDIA! (Guess what as  marxist she is smart hit the right spot by lowering down the only empire that really in all sense was the TRUE GOLDEN AGE EMPIRE OF CLASSICAL INDIA!) So they attack that! This reminds me of interesting lines\\~\n\n \n\n&gt;*It all boils down to pride. Italian city-states, post-Christian Central Europe - all wanted to claim at least cultural successorship to Rome\'s legacy. Rome was that one girl everyone wants to have but cannot.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Rome, therefore, got remembered in annals as that continuously coveted girl whom everyone wanted to sleep with, some did, some did not and some raped her because she plainly refused but then again - they all got what they wanted.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Now contrast with the Gupta Empire -*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*A people who hate their own past will not tend to remember it like some prize woman coveted overtimes, nor will they try remembering it as a time when they were the best. It boils down psychologically to the fact that while Rome became European invaders\' trophy courtesan, the Gupta period became the whore of history.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Empires are not called empires because they recorded themselves as such in history. Empires are called empires only because its peoples\' descendants choose to recognize the history that way. For instance, the Mughal \'empire\' got destroyed and de-facto abolished many times before its dynastic end had actually arrived and yet - books call it the Mughal empire. Reason - the people who wrote those books would rather remember Turko-Mongol Islamic rule as a continuous prized memory of history rather than whatever your status explains.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Psychology of people remembering history is normally the answer to questions pertaining to the later interpretation of history as well.*\n\n \n\n&gt;*Ok. Riddle me this.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The Roman Empire was, in the course of its existence, dissolved several times, changed hands even more, was split up, parcelled out, apportioned, quartered, gambled away, bought back, and otherwise rendered defunct multiple times- but it\'s still called the \'Roman Empire\'.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*On the other hand:-*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*1- Sri Gupta (240 AD to 280 AD) (Founder of the Empire)*  \n*2- Ghatotkacha Gupta (280 AD to 319 AD)*  \n*3- Chandra Gupta (320 AD to 335 AD)*  \n*4- Samudra Gupta (335 AD to 380 AD)*  \n*5- Rama Gupta (380 AD to 382 AD)*  \n*6- Chandra Gupta 2/ (aka Vikramaditya)  (382 AD to 415 AD)*  \n*7- Kumara Gupta (415 AD to 455 AD)*  \n*8- Skanda Gupta (455 AD to 467 AD)*  \n*9- Puru Gupta (467 AD to 473 AD)*  \n*10- Kumara Gupta (473 AD to 476 AD)*  \n*11- Buddha Gupta (476 AD to 495 AD)*  \n*12- Narasimha Gupta (495 AD to 523 AD)*  \n*13- Kumara Gupta (523 AD to 540 AD)*  \n*14- Vainya Gupta (540 AD to 550 AD)*  \n*15- Bhanu Gupta (550 AD to 557 AD)*  \n*16- Krishna Gupta (557 AD to 559 AD)*  \n*17- Harsha Gupta*  \n*18- Jivita Gupta (few days)*  \n*19- Kumara Gupta (560s AD to 570s AD)*  \n*20- Damodara Gupta (few days)*  \n*21- Mahasena Gupta (570 AD to 580 AD)*  \n*22- Prabhakara Pushyabhuti (son-in-law of Mahasena; 580 to 604 AD)*  \n*23- Rajyavardhana Pushyabhuti (604 AD to 606 AD)*  \n*24- Harshavardhana Pushyabhuti (606 AD to 647 AD)*  \n*25- Unnamed noble (No Conclusive Data present)*  \n*26- (?) Varmana (690s AD to 725 D)*  \n*27- Yashoda Varmana (725 AD to 752 AD)*  \n*28- Unnamed Varmana Heir*  \n*29- Ama(?) Varmana (780s AD to 832 AD)*  \n*30- Dundhaka Varmana (833 AD to 860s AD)*  \n*31- Bhoja Varmana (No Conclusive Data present)*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*So, we have a single Empire extending over most of North India from Punjab to Bengal, with Sindh and Orissa being taken into the Empire every so often, and extending well into the Deccan and North East for centuries at a time- lasting almost uninterrupted for more than 600 years. This Empire demonstrates remarkable continuity in rule- with power passing fairly smoothly from ruler to successor across three dynasties, linked by both blood and election.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*This Empire lasted two period of massive climatic upheaval that led to the destruction of multiple Empires across Europe, South America, Persia, and China- and encompassed the \'Golden Age of India\' in the 4th Century- presiding over a flourishing of Art, Culture, and Literature the World has scarcely seen- with an almost exacting continuity of Ethos and Belief.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*So- why is \'Roman Empire\' a legitimate usage while the \'Gupta-Vardhamana\' Empire isn\'t? The iconography in their coins is consistent, the focus on Emperors being scholar-soldiers is consistent. Their military representation- with the Brahminy Kite standard- is consistent. The administrative organization- barring the steady change from centralized Empire under Sri Gupta to a wholly internally-divided Feudal state under the Varmana- is consistent as well.*\n\nSO my virat friends History creates a narrative! OUR GRAND NARRATIVE and IT Should be known to all!\n\n***Here are some authors that one should stay away\\~*** \n\n* Romila Thapar(MARXIST)\n* Irfan Habib(MARXIST)\n* RS Sharma(MARXIST)\n* Upinder Singh(Calls herself NEUTRAL YET INJECT MARXISM)\n* Bipin Chandra\n* Satish Chandra\n* Ramchandra Guha\n* B.B Lal\n* Kosambi\n* D.N Jha\n\n**SOME AUTHORS WHICH YOU SHOULD READ\\~**\n\n* *RC Majumdar* (The Granddaddy of all Historians in India.

I was even banned for it.\n\n[Exhibit 3](https://np.reddit.com/r/Hindi/comments/fvqcte/etymology_of_hindi/)\n\n[Exhibit 4](https://np.reddit.com/r/Hindi/comments/fv8smn/%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%9C_%E0%A4%95_%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%AB%E0%A4%9C/fmj2dq0?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x)\n\nThis moderator even seems to have an alt. Why I suspect this? This post was pinned within minutes by the other alt who shows up as the moderator:\n\n[https://np.reddit.com/r/Hindi/comments/fyy5kd/hindis\\_history\\_and\\_connection\\_with\\_urdu/](https://np.reddit.com/r/Hindi/comments/fyy5kd/hindis_history_and_connection_with_urdu/)\n\nHere is his librandu connection (of course it doesn't show up now that librandu is private and/or his comments deleted to hide it):\n\n[https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/697501017910149161/698617203011879062/unknown.png](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/697501017910149161/698617203011879062/unknown.png)\n\nAnd here is the timestamp of when he was made mod:\n\n[https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/694951247459123270/698721459756990565/unknown.png](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/694951247459123270/698721459756990565/unknown.png)\n\nEdit: [Oh, and what happened to the rule on the subreddit of no politics?](https://np.reddit.com/r/Hindi/comments/fv8smn/%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%9C_%E0%A4%95_%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%AB%E0%A4%9C/fmiiak4?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x)\n\nI and couple of our nationalist friends have created a separate subreddit (private as of now) called [r/HindiLanguage](https://new.reddit.com/r/HindiLanguage/) to promote colloquial and Shudh Hindi, which I will be opening up in a bit.

There is a huge lack of such content in our country.\n\nAlso in subs like r/hinduism in the past year i have been seeing a surge of awesome new images of our gods, especially some minimalistic ones which i love.

When Hanuman got into the crack he got to know that it was a way to *nag lok* *(abode of serpents)* where he met Vasuki (king of serpents) and told about his mission. then Vasuki led him towards the mountain of rings.\n\nHanuman did not even waste a second and rushed to the mountain. He picked up the first ring. He was amused to find the original ring in the very first go. He again picked another ring. To his surprise, even that ring was original. He was now confused. He looked at Vasuki in confusion.\n\n“Don’t worry, child. I will explain it to you. but first let me tell you a story” Vasuki calmly spoke.\n\n“There are four yugas and the world keeps on cycling. In the second quarter or treta yuga Rama takes birth, then one day his ring falls into the land of serpents and a monkey comes to take that ring back, and I will tell him the same story. And until then, Rama dies.\n\nThe mountain of rings indicates the number of times this repeated. Each time this cycle repeat, a ring is added to the mountain”\n\nHanuman realizes that he had stuck in the time loop.\n\nRam’s death gives us a sense of cyclic pattern of time depicted in hinduism.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jvzzsx4zinr41.png?width=416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=484a9627c8a95971d8dce9fcad8d1edc36a465de\n\nI found it fascinating and worth sharing.Apart from that here is 1 hr loop of Ramayana 1987 intro loop.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNh52hy2jiQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNh52hy2jiQ)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iwj4ulfoinr41.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f37cf37834b1775f7ec690915b290e5a171b78ee'<br />Author: 'rookiephysicist'<br />id: 'fxdu6t'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'List of people who are doing meaningful things during lockdown.'<br />Body: 'The owner of Iscon mall in Ahmedabad has converted his premises into shelter for homeless people.  hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people are housed there, sitting safe distances away from each other.  there are clean bathroom, and facility to take bath.  tea and food is served to everyone at specific times.  beddings and blankets are provided to everyone to sleep at night.\n\nI feel that things likes these will not get sufficiently recorded and when this pandemic is passed, these people will be forgotten.\n\nInstead, i suggest we start listing evidence of people who are doing good work during this time, so that when these times are passed, we can celebrate them.

Forget newfags, even some oldfags  tend to use "Virat" for anybody; from bollywood actresses holding a copy of *bhāgavad gitā* to some random westerner wearing ॐ kurtas.\n\nVirat, when translated literally from Sanskrit, means "majestic". Contrary to popular belief, a Virat doesn\'t have to be from one of the *Dhārmic* faiths. Though certainly not as common; Christians and even Muslims can be Virat. \n\nA Virat Hindu/Sikh/Jain is somebody who takes immense pride in his *Dhārmic* heritage. This pride stems from a realisation of belonging to the oldest surviving civilization and is also, in part, reactionary; centuries of being conquered, invaded and losing all your glory is going to do that to you. It manifests itself in things as simple as an open appreciation of the indigenous culture; like wearing a *Kada*/*Kalava*/*Rudraksh* in circles where it\'s considered "uncool" to something as brave as refusing to cite the *shahada* even in the face of death.\n\nFor the Muslim and the Christian, Viratness expresses itself as an unwavering allegiance to India and the Indic culture. Unlike (Indian) followers of the Dhārmic faiths whose religion was formulated in the very land they live in and is thus inseparable from it\'s culture, Muslims and Christians follow an "imported" religion; that too one which was brought over by invaders. This creates a dichotomy in their mind wherein they are often put in situations where they have to choose between the two (Nation and Religion). The Virat Christian/Muslim will always choose the nation, even if it means being branded as a "traitor" to their (religious) brethren. Think Mohammed Kaif celebrating the Triple Talaq verdict even in the face of death threats from Islamic trolls, or Tom Alter/Ruskin Bond refusing to call themselves as anything other than Indians despite them being looked at as "outsiders" because of their "firangi heritage".\n\nVirats of all heritages will never LARP as Aryans(Hindus)/Anglos (Christians)/Arabs(Muslims), because to them, it\'s not a compliment, it\'s an insult.'<br />Author: 'TerryMcGinnis1999'<br />id: 'fwpe8g'<br />Flair :Research</li><li>Title: 'Anyone ever cancelled their Ola or Uber rides or Zomato or other delivery because the driver/delivery guy was Muslim?'<br />Body: "Previously we didn't have an option as to who we are giving business to.
