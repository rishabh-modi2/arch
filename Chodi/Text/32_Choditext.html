Here are some reasons of BJP's defeat:\n\n1. Unable to understand the matriarchial fabric of Bengalis: Bengali culture is predominantly feminine and due to this very reason, I used to admire Bengalis. Even the Bengali men I've met are slightly effeminate and in households, it's only the women whose voice has weight. Even in Bengali literature, authors have portrayed strong, independent women and the male writers write women voices much better than male ones. Due to this very reason, Momta approved women candidates in 50 seats, while whether it be the campaign by Modi, Amit Shah, JP Nadda or Suvendu Adhikary joining BJP, Momta made it seem like an injured lone warrior woman fighting against an army of men. BJP made a big mistake by not choosing women leaders to campaign.\n\n2. Over reliance on Jai Shri Ram slogan: Let's face it, Hindus have never given and will never give votes on the basis of our gods being insulted or religious sovereignty. Shri Ram Andolan started in late 80s-early 90s, yet tell me once people have given majority to BJP before 2014. Even in 2014, it was more about people getting fed up with passive Manmohan Singh government and less about Hindu identity. And honestly, except Marathis and Konkanis, no one will vote for a government solely for protecting Sanatan Dharma. Especially for Bengalis, their identity as a Bengali is more important than their Hindu identity. So clutching over Jai Shri Ram slogan issue was not a very wise move.\n\n3.

He also has a tendency to resort to gutter level political tactics. \n\nNot many would know that in 2017, a fake porn CD surfaced in Chhattisgarh of BJP leader Rajesh Munat. Allegedly Rajesh Munat was performing sexual act in the CD however the CD turned out to be doctored. But according to investigation,  many Congress leaders led by current CM Bhupesh Baghel helped circulating the clip in Chhattisgarh\n\nBaghel is that kind of leader who would love to defame his rivals in such a way. \n\nA case is already in courts and CBI is investigating. Bhupesh is already using his power to silence the witnesses\n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/sex-cd-case-chhattisgarh-congress-chief-bhupesh-baghel-sent-to-jail/articleshow/65936224.cms\n\nhttps://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india-chhattisgarh-cm-bhuesh-baghel-advisor-journalist-vinod-verma-sex-cd-case-494786\n\nhttps://www.jagran.com/news/national-chhattisgarh-government-made-party-in-cd-case-demand-for-transfer-of-case-out-of-state-21358987.html\n\nhttps://www.india.com/news/india/chhattisgarh-sleaze-cd-case-suspect-rinku-khanuja-allegedly-commits-suicide-3094304/\n\nhttps://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/chhattisgarh-fake-sex-cd-case-sc-to-hear-case-transfer-plea-in-february-1760222-2021-01-18\n\nHe ended up being the CM Of the state handpicked by Rahul Gandhi as he was from OBC caste. Now Baghel apart from mishandling the Covid situation in the state has stooped to new low to ensure that his failures in handling the pandemic are not highlighted. He organised Road Safety World Series in March, an event with multiple Cricket matches which turned out to the super spreader event of Chhattisgarh. He also did not order Vaccine on time as he was busy in Assam campaigning of Congress. There are videos of him dancing in Assam when Chhattisgarh was overwhelmed with dead bodies all over in funeral homes. \n\nNow he resorted to cheap politics of reservation even in Vaccines. He could not have directly asked for caste based reservation in Vaccines so he did it by saying that he is reserving initial vaccination for very poor and BPL people. In chhattisgarh those who get free ration from Govt and carry some Abhyuday Card will only be vaccinated. Bhupesh could have opted for simultaneous vaccination of all sections with some % of vaccination reserved for poor and weak sections of state. But he went all out with 100% vaccination for certain card holders. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/ChhattisgarhCMO/status/1388395150376783875\n\nAfter that he will vaccinate only BPL card holders. Now the catch is that vaccine registration is done on Cowin platform which does not have any means to implement Abhyuday or BPL card verification so any common person from Chhattisgarh can get registered for vaccination and still not get the vaccination. \n\nEx - \n\n&gt; This is the vaccination appointment letter, scheduled date 1 .05.21. Appointment approved by your system. they went to centre 20km,but your officer replied you are not eligible,you have no Antyoday Card.Then why your system approved appointment?who recover loss.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/blsahu23/status/1388444103046623232\n\nAt the same time there is no awareness among the poor people who are to be vaccinated right now about vaccination, so even they will not turn up for vaccinations thus vaccines will remain unused but at the same time other people will not vaccinated because the vaccination center will ask for Abhyuday cards\n\nBecause of such confusion and stupid rule only 1693 people could be vaccinated on the first day\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0XEnV8UUAgTDnE?format=jpg&amp;name=medium\n\n\nBhupesh is not interested in containing Corona epidemic in state.

I saw it coming..'<br />Body: 'Before I start, a little background about myself: I graduated from one of the top 5 Engg colleges in the country and went on to work for BJP Assam\'s 2016 election campaign as an independent consultant mainly handling their Data Analysis Dept, learnt a lot about elections.\n\nNow let\'s keep the fact that WB has a 30% M population that controls 120 seats aside. Basically in the absence of division of M votes, 170/294 is the ceiling for BJP. BJP has got around 50% of Hindu votes, to win it requires 65% H votes.\n\nI will deal with why this shortfall of 15% H votes:\n\n1. **Petrol and Gas price hike just before elections**. This DGAF attitude of Modi/Shah has cost them dearly, they thought people will vote for them no matter what. Contrast this with Momuta, she didn\'t let the Electricity company hike charges even after a lot of pressure on their side for the last 1 year.\n2. **Sab ka Saath, Sabka Vikas Syndrome and ditching Hard Hindutva**: Himanta Biswa Sarma in Assam has always been clear that he will never get votes from Muslims and hence doesn\'t play soft Hindutva. He goes full throttle on it and that\'s why he could unite both Bengali and Assamese Hindus despite CAA. In Bengal beyond "Jai Shree Raam" sloganeering BJP didn\'t use Hindutva at all quite surprisingly. HBS made effort to educate the Assamese people as to how Assamese identity was a part of the bigger Hindu identity and how the demographic change is a threat, this could have been done by BJP Bengal too, they could show how most Bengal stalwarts were actually Hindutvadis by quoting them and citing the effects of demographics changes that has already started happening in bordering districts of Bengal. The only BJP leader doing it was Suvendu Adhikari and see the result he defeated Mamata herself despite the seat having a 30% M population. This illusion of BJP to get Muslim votes must end and Hindus aren\'t going to vote for a Hindu party unless Hindu sentiments are invoked.\n3. **Lack of educated, sober leaders:** BJP Bengal almost has no regular leader who can reason properly. Not a single one. Every single TV debate is like a full toss to TMC. They very often come across as unreasonable idiots.\n4. **Inducting turncoats who tortured/killed people BJP workers**: In a bid to find "winnable candidates" they went on inducting all and sundry including people who used to be henchmen of TMC. People gravitated towards BJP during the LS 2019elections to escape from these henchmen. Now that the same people were accepted in BJP, people/workers feel betrayed. People who were involved in killing BJP workers were given tickets.\n5. **Not using agencies properly:** BJP used CBI against Mamata\'s favourite IPS officer just before the 2019 elections and as soon as it was over, they abandoned it, only now that elections were close did they start summoning TMC leaders. It\'s beyond me what purpose this serves! People have started to think these of nothing more than gimmicks. If they would have put sustained pressure, it would have crumbled Mamata. CBI takes any action, Momata rushes to meet Modi, CBI is pulled back. We have seen this cycle multiple times. Bengalis don\'t, believe BJP to be more honest.\n6. **Bengal has a Party Society structure**: In Bengal there is a unique political culture whereby a lot of people directly/indirectly benefits from the ruling party which is more pronounced than in other states. In rural areas, they influence family matters too. This gives a very strong hold over society. That\'s why you see such long spells Congress(22 yrs), CPM(34 yrs), TMC(15 yrs and counting)\n7. **Voter intimidation has worked:**  It was communicated to people in rural areas to people that if they vote for BJP they will be attacked and they would not be given govt schemes\n8. During the elections attacks on Bengali Hindus were going on in BD. BJP made no attempt to capitalise on that\n9. On Mamata\'s side, the only thing that worked for her is she went on a **freebie overdrive** in the last 1 year especially targeting the female population\n10. Many will say the outsider-insider factor played a part, that\'s minimal tbh if you look at the patterns.\n\n**Way Forward**: Retain Suvendu. Chances are he may leave, he seems disappointed with BJP today. Give him the reins of the party of Bengal. He knows what to say and when to say and what to do and when to do. Dilip Ghosh has done his part, he can\'t take it forward from here. Mamata\'s tactics are to finish off the opposition by killing and putting them in jails through false cases. This can be countered only by the ruthless hounding of TMC leaders by CBI, ED, otherwise, no one would be left to hold a BJP flag in 3yrs. Go full throttle on Hindutva.\n\nAlso, Amit Shah is no Chanakya, he is way too overrated. Both Himanta Biswa Sarma and Suvendu Adhikari are smarter. BJP should take cue and go on freebie overdrive from 2023 to return in 2024'<br />Author: 'xoxololo420'<br />id: 'n3c2fq'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'To all the bengalis on this sub.

At least this time there was an effort made to rescue these suicidal H√≠ndus but with the results in Bengal I am forced to think that Kashmiri Hindus couldn't be saved because they wouldn't have aligned with any nationalist force which hypothetically would have arrived in Kashmir.

Whoever came to power after that continued to use this medium of  power consolidation. In fact, political murders were and still are a common thing there. \n\nThis system over the decades has matured really well. And not all Bengalis dared to go against Momler Didi. \n\nWe saw how BJP workers were murdered, JP Nadda was attacked, Even Home minister Amit Shah was not spared, Tejasvi Surya\'s rally got attacked. This continued even during elections where voters were openly intimidated, and BJP workers were killed. \n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**BJPs campaign was not localized to Bengali preferences**\n\nTo appeal Bengali Hindus BJP should\'ve gone for "Joi Maa Durga" instead of "Jai Sri Ram". I as a south Indian took a while to connect to "Jai Sri Ram", in fact it took me a few years. \n\nAlso local BJP leaders should\'ve been given the center stage. I feel presence of outsiders, although powerful people like Modi and Amit Shah overshadowed local BJP leaders. \n\nBengali identity is very strong. And this is the area BJP needs to change it\'s strategy. This issue is there in all south Indian states except Karnataka\n\nAnd because of this language identity, a Bengali Hindu and Bengali/Bangladeshi muslim is more likely to vote as a block to the party that\'s local and closer to people. \n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Positives**\n\nAlthough the polls were hyped by pro-BJP news, which all news do. The results are still good in that BJP is losing seats by a very close margin of a few thousand votes. BJP has made significant inroads in the Bengali politics. And it is a longer game. The seats gained are also significant. \n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Negative**\n\nBiggest negative is that demography is destiny. Probably BJP should\'ve done this five years ago. Feels like it\'s too late and we might see Bengal turn into Kashmir and there would be no surprises if Hindus are slaughtered with impunity and silently with ZERO media coverage. \n\nI\'m afraid what will now happen to BJP cadre in Bengal.

So, now there are many new users here who do not understand why Chodi was created, and the interesting history behind it. So, I decided to write this post to go back through the memorylane.\n\n# Backstory\n\nUntil the day we started Chodi(26th December 2019), all of us were part of Bakchodi subreddit. Everyone used to post there, but the quality of the sub deteriorated over time, and the biggest reason was because of the moderators misusing their powers and basically abusing the users. \n\nPeople were getting unnecessarily banned for no reason just because some mod was triggered, posts were silently removed even when they violated no rules. There was infact a rule in the sidebar called Never Piss off mods because MODS=GODS. Ahh, that rule is still there in their sidebar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[4 years ago](https://preview.redd.it/tzbf1eupjiw61.png?width=1701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=549fb37c125aaf4a2eab6ee6fafdf4435d4635b2)\n\nThis created a toxic interaction between the mods and the users with the users unable to do anything about it. Users still continued to use the sub because there was no other place like that. They still enjoyed posting there, but while trying to stay out of the radar of the mods.\n\nThis continued for several years until 23d December when the top mod of Bakchodi threw a tantrum by blocking the entire sub to all users. Well, we got to experience Lockdown before Corona!\n\nHe then asked all users to get personally verified by him or else remain banned from the sub. He did this because he was unhappy with the CAA Law, and many users had posted things in support of the CAA law in the Bakchodi subreddit, so he wanted to show the anger at the users.\n\n[Discussion of the top mod IO, one week before the tantrum](https://preview.redd.it/ffqbg8hpwiw61.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29bf5bd354cbcc188260cefb9858770ee86bb8c6)\n\nHe also removed the power of all the mods and banned thousands of users. At first people took it as a joke but one day passed and the sub was still blocked. The users were now very pissed at this abuse of power, but there were nothing they could do, so they waited and pleaded the mod to unlock the sub like how we pleaded Britishers to leave in the earlier independence movements. \n\n[The post that eventually destroyed Bakchodi](https://preview.redd.it/qts2r4h4giw61.png?width=1711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79a13969f012859130d6f2c2e71f773ed6f933fd)\n\nSecond day also the sub was blocked for everyone except the few approved users. All other posts and comments were getting auto-removed by the AutoModerater.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Look at the auto moderator message](https://preview.redd.it/ymdyd6mydiw61.png?width=1732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08925b277f7183bdcb17c8bb741a07ff2d8d4829)\n\nIf you want to take a look at a post yourself, here is a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/bakchodi/comments/efrmbi/bakchodi_hack_hui_gava_ka/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A mod posting about another mod being banned](https://preview.redd.it/t0zbao25fiw61.png?width=1733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be0a6d186fb2f695f15a5c06fff349759be3e76e)\n\n# -------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Beginning of Chodi\n\nAfter about three days of this self-inflicted blockade, the users finally had enough and started discussing ideas on other Indian subreddits. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vbc4702eiiw61.png?width=1711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9253b145d34b9878190f47dd2bf8b27d1f1910ff\n\nThen multiple users decided to create dozens of new subs. I too created a sub called Chodi. Meanwhile, the top mod of Bakchodi made fun of these attempts saying they will never succeed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Few other alternative ones](https://preview.redd.it/ich3637tuiw61.png?width=1719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2cc8be2dd76e000bdebbdcb988768dbff4f4de8)\n\nThe problem I saw at that time was that we were all getting divided into too many tiny subs such that none was going to succeed. No single sub had enough audience, thus users were posting memes to a dozen subs. The community was getting disintegrated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bvt3gj41jiw61.png?width=1592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cc94e191d3e93b764035927550a0ccf9cbaadfc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThus, it was necessary to lead everyone into one sub. And I contacted all the mods of different subs and asked them to come together. Most of them agreed, and within a day, all mods were part of Chodi.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[When Chodi welcomed Refugees from Bakchodi. \\(One of the first posts of chodi\\)](https://preview.redd.it/qp1wtk970jw61.png?width=1708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80371951ebc4baccd71609dd88ba705016fee1c6)\n\nBakchodi\\_2 was the biggest alternate sub of that time with around 300 subscribers. Since we did not want to be "2" of anything, it was decided to go with Chodi. So, Finally when Backhodi\\_2 moderator agreed and got merged with us, we were done integrating all backhods back together under one flag once again.\n\n[A very famous post that brought us all together](https://preview.redd.it/o1l09a19ziw61.png?width=1702&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a599fdf048f374a224f0185c9df3a1a32634e12a)\n\nIn the first day of the launch itself, we grew to nearly 1000 users, seeing such a huge growth, Bakchodi mod got panicked and quickly reopened the sub, and reversed restrictions he had done. He even cancelled the bans of everyone(1000s of users)! And then pleaded everyone to come back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[They started banning anyone who mentioned Chodi](https://preview.redd.it/7tifo6df2jw61.png?width=1704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91bbbd103526cff099c0054e109ca41dac009827)\n\nAt first there was some gossips on weather to go back to Bakchodi accepting the mod\'s offer as no one wanted to be part of a small sub. At that time, Bakchodi had 38000 subs, while we had only 2000. Some users even said they are ready to go back if that top mod was removed, but they were not ready to do this. Then it was decided there is no going back. \n\nBakchodi mods then offered all mods of Chodi Mod-position in Bakchodi if we were to ask the users to go back to Bakchodi and close Chodi. One of backchodi Mods said to me "Chodi will never be able to reach the sub count of Bakchodi, so why not join Bakchodi". I even got that Mod-invite from him which is still sitting in my messages. But as you all know all mods refused to take that offer.\n\n[My Mod initiation](https://preview.redd.it/qqityo6g6jw61.png?width=1223&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e95e8402b537cc265cd0fb62f4ff9529cb52429)\n\nAfter that, one of their mods famously said "Good Riddance" in one of the comments. While another mod called all of the users "Low IQ JIO Users". It was not just the Top Mod that was the problem. All the mods except one was full of arrogance.\n\n[This screenshot show exactly the atmosphere at that time](https://preview.redd.it/nm9n40fkbjw61.png?width=1425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44c8b7097f0189e6294c52b3c1ba26b3036c0cb7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Another Mod\'s Good Riddance Commnet](https://preview.redd.it/tgk97mzb8jw61.png?width=1626&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e76eedd05f19978a17717968eaa967da690fc41)\n\nAfter realizing that Bakchodi was beyond saving, the above mod even tried creating another alternative subs and posted on Chodi to advertise it asking users to join there. But almost no one joined, and he later deleted that sub.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# CHODI\'s Insane Growth\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img m77ipeod3jw61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[4500subs after one week](https://preview.redd.it/sw910u1y3jw61.png?width=1695&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3370d9aa7e635bd677ab3acbcdeb3a2e9a09f24b)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that, the growth rate slowed down because there were no more active users in Reddit. We mods had decided a target to hit 10000subs, because our sub was too small to sustain itself, and we were worried that new users would be unaware about all these history and thus, they would subscribe and post again to Bakchodi which was a huge sub with 38,000subscribers. \n\nNew Users would just see the bigger sub, subscribe and use it while ignoring the smaller one. So, we worked hard to promote our sub every way possible, and after around one month, we reached 10k subs, and then we knew we were safe and can sustain itself.\n\nAnd we hit that goal of 10k subscribers in around 1 month, again becoming the fastest growing subreddit in entire world. The crazy thing is that in the beginning itself, we had 26 Mods!!! And many made fun of having so many mods, but it worked out great. Everyone volunteered to do whatever they could to make the sub great. There were many awesome people, working together as a team without any coordination structure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# NOW\n\nToday we stand at a point where we are going to cross the total sub count of Bakchodi. As we predicted, new users continued to subscribe to Bakchodi unaware of this history, but we got 10x more active users. Chodi still remains as the most active "Indian" Subreddit. \n\n[Look at Chodi\'s growth compared to bakchodi](https://preview.redd.it/lino3sbeejw61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01fa511ea457a6a50017bacdbdb56f26d0c0b29c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Look at that Comments per day difference!!!](https://preview.redd.it/8v8agaujfjw61.png?width=1369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb1edfab5e4a8cbac55725f09969c2abfa5ef6b8)\n\nWe are ranked 230th most active subreddit in whole of Reddit considering the number of comments we get per day! Imagine that!\n\n[Comments per day. Orange is Chodi.

The post showed that Randia was heavily left leaning while Chodi was moderate. This could be a worrying symptom of a cancer growth right before our eyes. Chodi might be getting swamped by Randians to change the charitra of Chodi and blue pill us meanwhile we pat ourselves on the back for being centrists which let's not fool ourselves, we are not. Many Chodians are noticing this rise in number of librandoo looking posts and we know how cunning Randi√† dwellers are. So I request Chodians and Chodi mods to be extra vigilant from now on, because this sub might be going under propaganda attack.

It was a rapid test. I read this paper they handed me right after getting my negative results back.\n\nIt claimed that ‚Äúthe covid test (that I just paid $155 for) AND PCR testing is not 100% accurate. It didn‚Äôt disclose the accuracy. So I asked the nurse what the accuracy of the test actually is: she didn‚Äôt know. I ask my doctor the next day: he doesn‚Äôt really have a definite number on their accuracy.\n\nDoing some research I found on Harvard‚Äôs website. Almost 20% false negatives when up to 5 days after the first symptoms. But they STILL don‚Äôt have an absolute number number. ‚ÄúCould be more‚Äù basically\n\nOn that same piece of paper I got from the clinic: a few paragraphs down it says between 5% and 60% of COVID cases are believe to have few to no symptoms. That‚Äôs a 55% difference in spread. Fam, Super Bowl Predictions predictions are more accurate than that üò≠\n\nIt basically says that medical professionals cannot tell who has COVID and of those people they cannot be sure how many are asymptotic, or just don‚Äôt have it.\n\nSo my question is:\n\nWhen they tests the vaccines, how do they have enough information to claim that a vaccine is 90% effective &amp; 94% effective for reducing symptoms or avoiding death when there‚Äôs no way to tell who ACTUALLY has COVID and who‚Äôs already asymptotic to it.\n\nThe vaccine can‚Äôt have an effectiveness rate determined when the researchers don‚Äôt know the other solid data metrics \U0001f978\n\nThis may be why the CDC is telling you to stay masked up after getting the vaccines - because they don‚Äôt know how effective they really are\n\nSo I‚Äôm gonna sit this vaccine out But that‚Äôs just me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ncrosspost in old way [https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/n245lo/if\\_the\\_vaccines\\_are\\_90\\_94\\_effective\\_against/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/n245lo/if_the_vaccines_are_90_94_effective_against/)'<br />Author: 'EnthusiasmPhysical67'<br />id: 'n2fkq6'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: 'Man, How toxic is this Libarandu subreddit'<br />Body: 'Ufff,..'<br />Author: 'One-Inspection8628'<br />id: 'n2fdek'<br />Flair ::HighIQ: Randia Simulation</li><li>Title: 'VISHAL SINGH OF ATHURA AKA STALKER " BEWARE'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'D3DEVILISH'<br />id: 'n2eioz'<br />Flair :Laal Salaam :commiehand:</li><li>Title: 'Unrelated to memes and politics'<br />Body: 'Can some Viraat weebs tell me where can I watch Kochikame?
