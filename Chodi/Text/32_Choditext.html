<li>Title: '[OC]Is the war between India and China Imminent due to the fact that the 15th Dalai Lama has to be incarnated soon?'<br />Body: " S*ome preface:*\n\nDalai  Lamas are important monks of the Gelug school, the newest school of  Tibetan Buddhism. The Dalai lama can only be incarnated in Tibet and the  14th Dalai lama fled off to India to avoid persecution in 1959 China  Uprising. Since then China has been cracking down various religious  figures especially Buddhists in Tibet. China also hates India due to the  fact that the Dalai Lama lives as a refugee there.\\[[s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama)\\]\n\nWhat I did:\n\nI  calculated the birth date difference between every Dalai Lama to exist  yet. The maximum difference of years between two consecutive Dalai Lamas  was 84 years between the First and Second Dalai Lama. If we consider  the birth date of the current Dalai Lama(1935), he should have died and  the new Dalai Lama should have been incarnated(does not necessarily mean reincarnated) before 2019. But that's not the case, and thus this Dalai Lama becomes the highest reigning one.\n\nThe  difference between the death and the birth of next consecutive Dalai  Lama has never been more than 2 years. The current Dalai Lama is 85  years old. With the recent Sudden Flare up of tensions among India and  China, and also with almost the whole world due to the Chinese Pandemic,  I think War in imminent and it will should lead to the liberation of  Tibet. The consecutive Dalai Lama would be born within 2 years of the  death of current Dalai Lama(the 14th)[\\[s\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dalai_Lamas)\n\nnote: Dalai Lama cannot be reincarnated until the previous one dies."<br />Author: '--I-love-you-'<br />id: 'ipd016'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li>

It annoys me that anyone that wants to know more about india and its current affairs will probably search for an indian sub, and Randia is the one that comes up, a sub that is completelt anti indian.\n\nAs a sub that is the name of our country, it should definetely not be run with posts filled with self hate and gora/non-indian validation.\n\nWhat do u guys think? Do you have any other ideas to deal with this? I know its not a 1-day solution but i believe we should start taking steps before they do more damage and brainwash newcomers as well with their agenda.\n\nLets discuss :)"<br />Author: 'JazzKrew'<br />id: 'inj6th'<br />Flair ::modi: aatmanirbhar</li>

Asked for uber, the cab was shit, the driver kept burping and if I opened the window, it stunk of shit and piss everywhere, when I reached my house, we had a flat, just adjacent to it, there was a disgusting slum but then I realized that slums are everywhere in india. I was enrolled in a school, to my surprise, I forgot that they had tests to enroll in a school in india. I was an ace in England, top set maths, science and English. But then they had so many unnecessary questions in ther paper that I barely passed through. After a year I realized how shit India is and how I treated the becautiful country for England. I started hating the country every month to where I\'d rather die than live in india, Education, Emergence services, Medical system, culture, population, FEMINISM, corruption. Then the day came, I was 17 and my dad was like "We are moving back to England, my work here as a softwere engineer is done" I was so happy, even happier than what I felt going back to india.

And mind well that she\'s an actress. she definitely knows her expressions. They even happen to be baseless and isn\'t considered reliable enough in courts. but just for the sake of interest, I\'m posting this here. \n\nSo adding more to the context, micro expressions are subtle hints or expressions that your subconscious mind "leaks". These expressions help experts (or even layman like us) to spot a liar .These can be prevented after a lot of practice though.\n\nRhea throughout the interview shows almost all the basic parameters of a liar. She tries to avoid eye contacts with Rajdeep, she shows Non-Duchenne ( fake ) smiles as her wrinkles around eyes are absent, notice how when she states any major fact, she blinks slower than usual and after that, her blinking speed is suddenly increased. this is exactly what a liar would do. also, as she describes her relationship with sushant , she minimally references herself. She repeates herself so much, gives a pause before answering, touches her hair more than usual, bites her lips occasionally , uses convoluted terms to describe events. Her tone changes in between a lot. while telling him about Modafinil drug and sushant\'s claustrophobia, notice how she clenched her teeth awkwardly showing a "duping delight" ( a sense of enjoyment they are getting out of controlling and deceiving another person. ) All of these are traits of liars.\n\nAgain, I\'m not an expert. and these are not stone written facts that she is a liar. but all of this is pretty interesting to me and had a bit free time in my hands :-) So would really like to know any expert\'s opinion.'<br />Author: 'nihahahahahar'<br />id: 'iine9e'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li>

His Disciple Haridas Thakur was a born Muslim, but he converted to Hinduism under Mahaprabhu\'s guidance, and he used to chant Krishna\'s names for 1 lakh times daily in Puri. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did the sanadhi of Haridas Thakur, a mleccha born, with gis own hands in Puri in the times when mlecchas were considered impure.\n\nThe 6 Goswamis of Vrindavan are considered as unparalleled in their contribution to Sanskrit literature that too during the tough times of Islamic rule. Rupa and Sanatana goswamis were formerly Muslims, they converted and became ministers under an Islamic ruler. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did ghar wapasi of both of them and instructed them to write Sanskrit commentaries on Krishna Bhakti. Their sanskrit grammar guide "Harinamamrita Vyakarna" is a classic gem in Sanskrit literature.\n\nThese are just few instances among the countless ghar wapasi Mahaprabhu did through the spread of Krishna Bhakti.\n\nSwami Prabhupada comes from the same line of disciplic succession. His Bhagavad Gita commentary is based upon the commentaries of the goswamis and Baladeva Vidyabhushana who was also a great scholar. \n\nTo all those spreading unnecessary hate against Swami Prabhupada, SHAME ON YOU!'<br />Author: 'nkdataster'<br />id: 'ii4wzk'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Butthurt OP</li>

Manmohan Singh said, very little to enable us to run the country for about 9 days only.\n\nNarasimha Rao got tensed and asked how to deal with this situation? Manmohan Singh said that the value of the country\'s rupee should have to fall by 20%. Narasimha ji said, okay call the cabinet meeting and we will seek approval.\n\nTo which Manmohan ji said, if we arrange cabinet meeting, we will not be able to take these tough decisions. All ministers will address the vote bank and won\'t agree to it. So as the PM, you have to take this critical decision.\n\nNarasimha ji paused for a while, and asked Manmohan ji to leave. Manmohan ji went to his office. After about 20 minutes, the PM\'s secretary went to Manmohan ji and handed over a letter. In that letter Narasimha Rao Ji had written, "Done"!\n\nManmohan ji got surprised, how could the PM gather the courage to say Yes even without getting nod of cabinet ministers? That could upset many top leaders of Congress. He rushed to PM\'s office again and asked what happened within these 20 minutes that led you to say yes?\n\nNarasimha ji said, it was quite easy. I just spoke to the opposition leader, Atal Bihari Bajpai ji, and he said Yes.\n\nManmohan ji asked, does that mean you look at Atal ji more than your own cabinet? Narasimha ji had said, I know he is the only person who will speak in the interest of the country.\n\nIt happens that after the announcement of this drastic decision to firefight bankruptcy, the Atal ji led opposition team never organized a protest movement, but supported the government to bring the country\'s economy back on track.\n\nGone those Politicians, gone those days..'<br />Author: 'civ_gandhi'<br />id: 'ihnlri'<br />Flair ::Whatsapp: WhatsApp Forward</li>

It\'s about promotion and indirectly demanding more content in you own language. You may have no problem with English but remember 90% Indians don\'t know English and it\'s difficult for them.\n\n1. Change you apps language in your regional language. Like Whatsapp and YouTube, YouTube even give keyboard in Indian languages in search bar.\n2. Contribute or Ask for subtitles in Youtube videos and OTT platforms.\n3. If you\'re a producer/manufacturer keep your product information bilingual, English and the regional language.\n4. Demand your government if the publish any notice in English to publish also in the regional language. Like Karnataka government issue a notice in English only ask them to issue it in Kannada also.\n5. Talk to your friends if they are from same region in your own language, even on social media\n6. Demand your local government to make all sign boards and information board bilingual. I visited many places where the information is given only in English no regional support.\n7. ADD Your suggestions please please\n\nMy point is you may understand the information in English but there are many many Indians lack this understanding -\n\nThey don\'t know what are the ingredients in a packet they are buying. In villages there are many similar looking products and most people buy things such as color of packing which leads to shopkeeper giving them duplicate product. One time I was at my village and my relative got ill, and then She just asked me to buy a medicine which is "green" in color. because it\'s all in English.\n\nThey have difficulties using simple apps, even though they can post something on facebook but they don\'t know how to stop video from automatically playing, things like that.\n\nThey enter in a contract like Insurance , but they can\'t read what\'s written. They are just entering in a contract based on the agent\'s trust.\n\nNow, you will say that it\'s the problem for manufactures but what happened to "consumer is the king"?\n\nIn court, English is necessary, I have seen many people being harassed by lawyers and police because people have to trust what they are saying and can\'t read what\'s actually written.\n\nThere are many more things I can add, I started writing this because I feel we should also think about 90% Indians who don\'t understand English, but now I am thinking of replies I will get "English is the language of future, there\'s no meaning of learning regional languages, English is our connecting language, I being a Fascist,Castiest, Narrow Minded person for asking to help regional langauges etc"\n\nMaking them learn English is hard but changing little things in our daily lives is easy.  \nplease share your thoughts.'<br />Author: 'newaccountforgmail'<br />id: 'ihh816'<br />Flair ::star: OC है बे </li>

<li>Title: 'Vir Savarkar on Hindi'<br />Body: 'Although the Sanskrit language must ever remain the cherished and sacred possession of our race, contributing most powerfully to the fundamental unity of our people and enriching our life, ennobling our aspirations and purifying the fountains of our being, yet the honour of being the living spoken national tongue of our people is already won by that Prakrit, which being one of the eldest daughters of Sanskrit is most fittingly called Hindi or Hindusthani the language of the national and cultural descendants of the ancient Sindhus or Hindus. Hindusthani is par excellence the language of Hindusthan or Sindhusthan. The attempt to raise Hindi to the pedestal of our national tongue is neither new nor forced. Centuries before the advent of British rule in India we find it recorded in our annals that this was the medium of expression throughout India. A sadhu or a merchant starting from Rameshwaram and proceeding to Hardwar, could make himself understood in all parts of India through this tongue. Sanskrit might have introduced him to circles of pandits and princes; but Hindusthani was a safe and sure passport to the Rajasabhas as well as to the bazaars. A Nanak, a Chaitanya, a Ramdas could and did travel up and down the country as freely as they would have done in their own provinces teaching and preaching in this tongue. As the growth and development of this our genuine national tongue was parallel to and almost simultaneous with the revival and popularization of the ancient names Sindhusthan or Sindhus or Hindusthan or Hindus it was but a matter of course that language being the common possession of the whole nation should be called Hindusthani or Hindi.'<br />Author: 'thinking-indian'<br />id: 'igvk31'<br />Flair :HQ Text Bakchodi</li>

Par same time par dusro ko apni bhasha seekhne ke liye bolenge.\n\nMai UP se hoon. Hamesha se hindi boli hai par kabhi usko lekr bakchodi nai ki. Ummeed hai baaki log bhi na kare. Desh aur Dharma dono par dhyan lagaye na ki Hindu ko aapas me ladvane me. And to all the non-hindi speakers, Most of the Virats don't support Hindi is national language its just few abrahimic corruptions in hinduism.\n\nKyuki apna culture ko sabse accha batana aur dusro se bhi zabardasti woh karvana Islamic ya abrahamic hai aur jo ye karta hai woh Sanatan Values ki beizzati karta hai bas."<br />Author: 'imperatoris7'<br />id: 'igvgc8'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li>

<li>Title: 'Open letter to yogi ji by सांड देवता'<br />Body: '-\n\n“एक अभिभूत\xa0#साँड़\xa0का पत्र माननीय योगी जी के नाम”\n\nहे परम आदरणीय\xa0#योगीजी\xa0महराज,\nसाँड़वत साष्टांग प्रणाम…\nमहराज बहुत अभिभूत भाव से यह पत्र आपको लिखने का साहस कर रहा हूँ… यूँ तो हम साँड़ों का बहुत गौरवशाली अतीत रहा है… त्रिदेवों में देवाधिदेव\xa0#महादेव\xa0के वाहन के रूप में मेरी नियुक्ति प्रजापति द्वारा की गई… हालांकि तमाम पशु-पक्षियों को धनवान और ऐश्वर्यशाली देवताओं की सेवा में नियुक्ति मिली… लेकिन हमारी नियुक्ति औघड़ दानी महादेव की सेवा में हुई, जिनके पास न घर था, न ही सुख-संपत्ति… महादेव की सेवा में हमें सदैव बर्फ़ीले कैलाश पर ही रहना पड़ता था… वो अधिकांश वक़्त ध्यानयोग में रहते थे जिसके कारण मैं उनकी सेवा हेतु बहुधा प्रतीक्षा ही किया करता था… एक तो कैलाश के इर्द-गिर्द हरियाली न होने से मुझे भोजन की बहुत दिक्क़त होती रही, ऊपर से माता जगदम्बा का वाहन शेर मुझे घूरता रहता था… हमारे गौरव से विस्मृत ऋषियों-मुनियों ने जातकों की एक राशि का नाम वृष रखा... यूँ तो सभी भारतीय पतियों में समयानुकूल साँड़ और बैल की आत्मा सदैव निवास करती है... महादेव की नगरी काशी के बारे में तो उक्ति है कि --\n"राँड़ साँड़ सीढ़ी सन्यासी, इनसे बचे सो सेवै काशी।"\n\nहम सभी साँड़ अपने परिवारों के साथ बहुत खुशहाल थे… सिंधु घाटी सभ्यता की खुदाई में हमारे गौरवशाली पूर्वज वृषभों की मूर्तियाँ और मोहरें मिली हैं... तभी मनुष्य ने खेती और पहिये का आविष्कार कर डाला… बस यहीं से हमारी मुसीबतें शुरू हो गईं… खेत जोतने तथा रथ, बैलगाड़ी वगैरह खींचने के लिए मनुष्य ने हमारी इज़्जत से खिलवाड़ शुरू कर दिया… सौ में नब्बे हृष्ट-पुष्ट बछड़ों को बधिया करके बैल बना दिया जाता था… फ़िर हमें बैलों के रूप में कोल्हू और रहट में भी जोता जाने लगा… हमारी सज्जनता को लोगों ने मूर्खता समझ कर “बैल बुद्धि” का मुहावरा गढ़ दिया… साँड़ के उन्मुक्त जीवन से हम कोल्हू के बैल बन गए… हमारे भाई बैलों की मण्डियां सजने लगीं, जहाँ हम श्रीकृष्ण-प्रियगोवंश को अन्य पशुओं की तरह बेचा-खरीदा जाने लगा… कवियों और लेखकों ने भी नारीवादियों की ही तरह सदैव हमारे साथ भेदभाव किया… काव्यों, महाकाव्यों, पुराणों, ग्रंथों में हमारे कुल की गायों को तो महिमामण्डित किया गया, लेकिन हम साँड़ों और भ्राता बैलों का जिक्र तक नहीं किया गया… बस गोवर्धन पूजा वाले दिन भ्राता बैलों के सींग रंगकर, सजा-धजाकर कर स्वादिष्ट भोजन दिया जाता रहा… बैलों में भी मूलनिवासी बैलों को ही बैलगाड़ी, कोल्हू, रहट, खेती वग़ैरह में जोता जाता रहा, जबकि विदेशी जर्सी अथवा संकर नस्ल के कन्धे न होने के कारण उन्हें कभी साँड़ से बैल भी नहीं बनाया जाता रहा…\n\nफ़िर देश आज़ाद होने के बाद हमारे अच्छे दिन भी आये जब देश चलाने का एकमुश्त टेण्डर उठाने वाली काँग्रेस ने “दो बैलों की जोड़ी” अपना चुनाव निशान बनाया… हम तो इस लोकतंत्र और संविधान के ऋणी हैं जिसके समानता के अधिकार के तहत तमाम बैल-बुद्धि दोपाये बैलों-साँड़ों को चुनाव लड़ने, जीतने और शासन चलाने का मौका मिला… हमारे अनेक बैलबुद्धि बिरादर आज नौकरशाही में भी तमाम उच्च पदों पर आसीन हैं… हमारे बैलबुद्धि बिरादर अरबों का हमारा चारा ख़ाकर हमसे भी ज़्यादा भुक्खड़ और कमाऊ हो गए... तभी फ़िर ऑटोमोबाइल वाहनों, ट्रैक्टर और मशीनें आने से हमें यातायात, कोल्हू, रहट और खेत जोतने से काफ़ी-कुछ मुक्ति मिल गई… लेकिन अब समाज को आवश्यकता न रहने से बेरोज़गार भ्राता बैल समाज पर बोझ बन गए… उधर सुंदर-बलिष्ठ संतान की अभिलाषा के तहत स्थापित कृत्रिम पशुधन केंद्रों ने हमारा दाम्पत्य जीवन और रोज़गार हम साँड़ों से भी छीन लिया… बैल-कोल्हू ब्राण्ड तेल के पीपे पर हमारी फोटू छापकर बनिये करोड़ों कमाते रहे और हम रोज़गार को तरसते रहे...\n\nनतीज़े के तौर पर हम साँड़ों और बैलों की उपयोगिता कसाइयों की आजीविका चलाने हेतु बूचड़खानों तक सीमित हो गई… हमें ट्रकों, गाड़ियों में मुम्बई की लोकल ट्रेनों की तरह ठूँसकर हमारी तस्करी होने लगी… कसाइयों के साथ ही तमाम नेताओं, पुलिस-प्रशासन अधिकारियों की तिजोरियाँ हमारी क़ुर्बानियों से भरने लगीं… हमारी रक्षा करने हेतु जो लोग गोरक्षक बन कर हमें बचाने आये उन्हें सभी बुद्धिजीवियों के साथ ही हमारे माननीय पीएम साहेब ने भी\xa0#गोरक्षकगुण्डे घोषित कर दिया… मीलॉर्डों ने भी हमारी रक्षा हेतु आने वाली भीड़ को\xa0#मॉबलिंचर\xa0अपराधी घोषित कर दिया… मीलॉर्ड को पहले भी हमारी\xa0#जल्लीकट्टू\xa0क्रीड़ा प्रतियोगिता से बहुत नाराज़गी रही है, उन्हें हमारी खेल भावना कभी पसंद नहीं आई...\n\nलेकिन हमें अंततः अपने युगों-युगों से संचित पुण्यों का फ़ल मिला… और पिछले वर्ष 2017 में प्रभु द्वारिकाधीश ने आपकी गो-द्विज-संत कल्याणकारी सरकार यूपी में बनवा दी… राज्य के मुखिया स्वयं गो-द्विज हितकारी संत योगीजी महराज आप स्वयं बने… आपने आते ही हम गोवंशजों के हितार्थ-कल्याणार्थ अनेक कार्य किये… हमारे वध और भक्षण पर आपने पूर्ण प्रतिबंध लगा दिया… जो गोपालक हम निष्प्रयोज्य-बेरोज़गार साँड़ों, बैलों को कसाइयों को बेंच देते थे, उन्होंने हमारी ख़ुराक से पीड़ित होकर हमें आज़ाद छोड़ दिया… हे परमपूज्य योगीजी महराज, अपने साँड़ और बैल समाज की इस स्वतंत्रता हेतु हम सदैव आपके ऋणी रहेंगे… महराज, अब आप तो जानते ही हैं कि पिछली भ्रष्ट सरकारों ने हमारे लिए कभी कोई साँड़ आवास विकास कॉलोनियाँ अथवा साँड़ विकास प्राधिकरण नहीं बनवाये, जबकि माता जगदम्बा के वाहन हेतु लॉयन सफ़ारी ज़रूर बनवा डाला… हाथी, शेर, हिरण, चीता, तेंदुआ, गैण्डा आदि से लेकर पक्षियों तक के अभ्यारण्य बने… लेकिन हम आवासहीन ही रहे अथवा बाड़ों में नजरबंद रहे…\n\nलेकिन हम हृदय से आभारी हैं परमपूज्य योगीजी महाराज आपके जिनकी असीम कृपा और प्रताप से हमें इस लोकतंत्र में स्वतंत्रता और समानता का अधिकार मिला… अब हम बड़े से बड़े शहर के किसी भी स्थल पर स्वच्छंद विचरण करते हैं… हमें शहर में कभी भी कहीं भी जाने, बैठने, खड़े रहने, प्यार करने, चरने की सम्पूर्ण स्वतंत्रता है… हमारे कुछ उत्साही साथी साँड़ तो बहुधा अधिकारपूर्वक आवासीय भवनों, सार्वजनिक स्थलों और पार्कों में भी प्रवेश करके विचरण करते हैं। अब हम किसी भी राजमार्ग पर बिना टोल टैक्स दिए कभी भी कहीं भी घूम या बैठ सकते हैं… पहले हमें सिर्फ़ रूखे-सूखे चारे से संतुष्ट रहना पड़ता था… लेकिन अब हम गाँवों में भी घास ही नहीं अपितु मनमाफ़िक फसलें भी इच्छानुसार भरपेट ससम्मान चरते हैं… हमारी इस असीम स्वतंत्रता के कारण अब गाँवों में नीलगायों की ख्याति और वैभव हमारे मुकाबले क्षीण हो गया है… पूज्य योगिराज में रामराज्य की ही तरह दोपाये मनुष्य और चौपाये पशु शांतिपूर्ण सहअस्तित्व की भावना से रह रहे हैं... सड़कों पर दौड़ते-कूदते, क्रीड़ा-किलोल करते पशुओं का मनोहारी दृश्य देखकर सूरदास की भाँति कोई भी भावविह्वल हो जाता है... साँड़, गाय, बैल, सुअर, बकरियाँ, खच्चर, गधे, बंदर इत्यादि शहरों में भी दंडकारण्य का आनन्द और अनुभूति देते हैं... शहरों-गाँवों में किसी भटके हुए बेरोज़गार साँड़ ने यदि कभी किसी मनुष्य को सींग मार दी हो तो हम इस हेतु खेद व्यक्त करते हैं… हिंसा का साँड़ समाज में कोई स्थान नहीं है... उग्र-आतंकी साँड़ की कोई नस्ल नहीं होती...\n\nहे साँड़-उद्धारक महात्मन, हम समस्त साँड़, बैल और सम्पूर्ण गोवंश आपका हृदय से ऋणी-आभारी है… महादेव की काशी के संसदाधिपति द्वारिकाचार्य माननीय पीएम साहेब के स्वच्छ भारत मिशन के तहत शहरों में कूड़ा-पॉलीथिन ख़ाकर हम पहले से ही स्वच्छ पर्यावरण हेतु योगदान करते रहे हैं… आपसे विनम्र अनुरोध है कि हमारे गोवंश के लिए जगह-जगह इज्ज़तघर (शौचालय) निर्माण करवाने की कृपा करें ताकि हम चतुर्दिक गोबर करने की बजाय सम्मानपूर्वक दैनिक क्रिया से निवृत्त हो सकें… हे महराज, करूणानिधान पीएम से कहकर सदियों से शोषित-पीड़ित-वंचित-पिछड़े हम बैलों साँड़ों हेतु संविधान में “भारतीय साँड़ आयोग” और “बैल/साँड़, गोप्रजाति अत्याचार निवारण अधिनियम” लागू करवाने की कृपा करें… हम अपने “अखिल भारतीय साँड़ महासंघ”, “भारतीय मूलनिवासी बैल संघर्ष मोर्चा”, “भारतीय गोवंश एकता परिषद” इत्यादि सभी संगठनों की तरफ़ से आपको सदैव भरपूर समर्थन देने की घोषणा करते हैं… महराज, हम आगामी 2019 तथा 2022 के आम चुनावों में पूरे तन-मन-सींग-पूंछ से पार्टी की विजय हेतु कटिबद्ध हैं… हे महराज, कदाचित त्रुटियों, अपराधों, अवगुणों हेतु इस अपने चरणदास साँड़ को क्षमा कर दीजियेगा... पुनः सम्पूर्ण धेनु के नन्दन साँड़-बैल समाज और समस्त गोवंश की ओर से आपको सादर नमन, वन्दन, अभिनंदन…\n\nगो द्विज धेनु देव हितकारी। कृपासिंधु भगवा तनुधारी।।\nविप्र धेनु सुर संत हित लीन्ह नमो अवतार।\nनिज इच्छा निर्मित तनु माया गुन गो पार ।।\n\nगऊ-बैल-साँड़ एकता ज़िंदाबाद... दुनिया के साँड़ों एक हो... साँड़े शक्ति कलयुगे... जय नंदीश्वर महादेव, जय नन्दी बाबा...\n\nआपका आज्ञाकारी, अनुरागी, भक्त\nएक शोषित-वंचित-पीड़ित मूल निवासी आर्य

<li>Title: 'The upcoming Culture Wars'<br />Body: 'The relative luxuries of the 21st century have spawned a new generation of soft doughy Indians, convinced that all prevailing peace and intact borders will continue to be the way they have been. The anarchists and islamists in the west have set in motion events that will become the destruction of the western civilization. The dam is broken and the degeneracy has begun to seep into the west and we are and will continue to face the fallout of this moral decay.\n\nThe Indian man today faces a brutal cultural crisis, blinded by decads of propaganda laced entertainment, his cultural identity has been stamped out of him. The Sheep and the parasites living in this country are all too happy to sing the song of secularism, because there exists a symbiotic relationship between them.\nOur enemies have extensive militant outfits- Islamists and communists throughout our country with international operational capabilities. Their brainwashed liberal counterparts handle the online PR campaign/damage control in the name of secularism, ofcourse. Indian liberals, either knowingly or mostly unknowingly end up serving as puppets for Islamists and communists, due to their general ignorance. These loud, boastful crusaders and defenders of human rights are often the ones who abuse the most rights and end up harbouring even more abusers. Consciously or not, they have the recipe to destroy us backed with full dedication to break this country apart. A man or a woman, even of fighting stock, will flee in battle if they do not believe in the land, culture or religion they are fighting for. Add the degeneracy that is infecting the west today into this mix and the Indian man faces a unique situation. His history and culture has been stripped off and his head flooded with ideas fitting a degenerate. \n\nThe challenges for the Indian right wing are extensive and with more and more rural indians joining the internet, the situation only gets complicated. The shadowy, discreet Culture Wars are coming and many more indians will fall prey to propaganda. Internet propaganda and the information war is going to be a significant challenge for the Indian right wing. They have the upper hand here, too. Due to the leftist nature of most social media sites, liberals enjoy unrestricted freedom to do and speak as they desire while shutting down dissent by calling it fascist/racist/etc.\n\n\nSteel yourself. The coming years are of the crucial importance. Our country will not remain intact if we slip up now.
