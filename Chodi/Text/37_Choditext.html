It may surprise you to know that the origin of the phrase \'Bhosadike\' is, in fact, an ancient Sanskrit greeting.\n\n"‡§≠‡•ã ‡§∏‡§¶‡•ç ‡§á‡§ï‡•á?" meaning, "Sir, are you well?"\n\nat is a term used for respectful greeting. Similar to ‡§Ö‡§π‡•ã,\n\n‡§ú‡•à‡§∏‡•á..... ‡§≠‡•ã ‡§≠‡•ã ‡§¨‡§æ‡§≤‡§ï‡§æ‡§É ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ç‡§Ø‡§§‡§æ‡§Æ.\n\n\'‡§∏‡§¶‡•ç is a prefix used for \'Good Things\'. As in \'‡§∏‡§¶‡•ç ‡§ó‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å\', \'‡§∏‡§¶‡•ç ‡§Ü‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞, \'‡§∏‡§¶‡•ç‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ‡§®‡§æ\' etc.\n\n\'‡§á‡§ï‡§æ\' is a atmanepadi verb meaning \'To Be\'. Other forms of this are:\n\n‡§á‡§ï‡§§‡•á ‡§á‡§ï‡•á‡§§‡•á ‡§á‡§ï‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•á ‡§á‡§ï‡§∏‡•á ‡§á‡§ï‡•á‡§•‡•á ‡§á‡§ï‡§ß‡•ç‡§µ‡•á ‡§á‡§ï‡•á ‡§á‡§ï‡§æ‡§µ‡§π‡•á ‡§á‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ‡§π‡•á\n\nHence \'Bhosadike was a popular form of greeting in ancient India before the Mughals invaded India &amp; prohibited it for some reason.\n\nHowever some steadfast Indians continued to use this greeting. Therefore, to asassinate this greeting morally, the Mughals gave it profane &amp; vulgar connotations, which unfortunately prevail even to this day.\n\nIt is time we revived our ancient Indian traditions heeding to the call of the purists to go back to our ancient way of life.\n\nSo say "Bhosadike" to all the people you meet &amp; explain to them its true, pure meaning.\n\nSauce: TheDceuGuy and Whatsapp Unibhersity\nHappy April Fools Day'<br />Author: '_lameboy_'<br />id: 'mhnmxd'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: 'Remember this day'<br />Body: 'Islamic scholars/Maulana are going to remove this jihad word from quran to spread peace and humanity all over the world'<br />Author: 'naughtkhalifa'<br />id: 'mhn8h4'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihaad_Halal Certified</li><li>Title: 'Where is the IT cell which all randians keep blaming?'<br />Body: 'I have been lurking through randia lately and noticed that everyone there blames BJP IT cell for everything and anything that is not in their favor.\n\nI earlier tried commenting on different randia posts that I am not part of any IT cell, still I was hounded out.\n\nAre there any such BJP IT cells?

Like that\'s not a valid reason to stop breeding. You can stop breeding if you just feel you\'re busy or you have health issues right now or basically any other reason but it\'s haram to decide not to have kids because you feel you can\'t financially support them. The idea is that Allah provides provisions.\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MF8Ep5pELr4\n\n\nhttps://islamqa.info/en/answers/10033/he-wants-to-limit-having-children-because-he-is-poor\n\n\nI know - it\'s patently dumb, very stupid üòÇ just watch the video though (relevant bit is in the end), that\'s from a very famous scholar (Yasir Qadhi).

Most Muslims don\'t know this, so they\'ll probably think it\'s crazy. \n\n\nDo this, ask a Muslim what they think about financial planning wrt having children in general and whether it\'s good/bad. then ask them if they think their religion allows it - they\'ll think it does. Post that quote the scholars above and watch them squirm, they\'ll be forced to throw their tradition under the bus, which is good - it\'s always a win when a Muslim gets skeptical of "big scholars"'<br />Author: 'throwawaythemoid'<br />id: 'mgcgdp'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'TryOut'<br />Body: 'Try browsing.     file:///sdcard/.    in your browser and thank me later.\nCan be done in anyones mobile Phone.'<br />Author: 'uraniium30'<br />id: 'mg97z6'<br />Flair ::news: Unverified</li><li>Title: 'Holi in Vrindavan'<br />Body: 'While the whole blames the Maharashtra government for doing poorly when it comes to covid cases they UP government just proves itself to be worse.

So here's some rough generalization. Take it with a grain of  anecdotal salt and dont crucify me. \n\nIn India - \n\n- non religious tambrahms in TN have been dicks to me. traditional ones are either avoidant or extremely considerate plus trust worthy, westernized returnees even better. Exposure better? \n\n\n- apolitical urduwoodified North indians and East Indians have been dicks to me except the right wing ones or the liberal westernized returnees of pre woke era. When I say north I only mean BIMAU and exclude pahadi mountains, Rajasthan, northeasterners and western coastline. Bengali ones are fucking cowardly sleazy and snobbish even if they have returned from the west and even while in the west. Bangladeshi or Assami hindus are okay. Hope Modi delivers a vaccine to them.\n\n\nThey are much better to dark christians, muslims who speak hindi urdu unlike md and my lighter taller hindu cousins. Dark lower caste north Indians are worse but just dont use kalu slurs on me.\n\n\n-North Indians (haryana, Up, punjuab delhi) are quick to jump fists but very forgiving unlike south indians who dont confront but avoid adversaries passive aggressively forever if done . Northeasterners are polite when in mainland, but brutal if I go to their place and am not christian. \n\n\n- dark Tamils and telugu especially the low caste christian converts have been dicks while they lecher over my lighter skinned  female cousins. \n\n\n- Kerala christians who are light skinned mostly orthodox have been nicer to me than the hindus who I find are snarky, lazy and sarcastic crabs in the well especially if they are or were communist leaning regardless of their tone or caste. No postive experience with the dark skin latins. Cant trust either when it comes to business partnerships based on alignment ( not competence). Whereas for hindus or muslims alignment is alright but not the competence. \n\n\n-Positive takes on mangalorean catholics, karnataka or marathi hindus and most goan ones of both religions or any politics are okay if they are not . \n\n\n- Muslims (including moppilas), intial extrafriendliness but betrayal if not subordinated later on disagreement. Literal trap. Applies to BOTH religious and westernized with latter being more cunning. Gulf or overseas returnees are more islamist even though they are treated like dogshit by arabs. Aggressiveness and Condescension like North indians but on a collective basis without the forgiving nature. \n\n\nExceptions are rich shia trading folk,  those from kargil region, apostates and westernized apolitical muslim girls. \n\n\n- Very very postive experience with pahadis in india and West both genders, beats even canadians in Canada. If I were to return to India, Id pick pahadi or southwestern ghats to settle. \n\n\nIn west-.\n\n\n- Woke SJWs are horrible in person, much worse than supposedly racist southern rural trump supporters. Wokes give protection only to brown women not us men. 2nd gen included, as they give off snobbish superiority vibes especially the self hating women. Whites are much friendlier especially the rural ones. Those from industrial run down towns are the worst not the country boys or girls. White feminist SJW men are sleazeball up to black latino muslim voting blocks but are condescending to asian or hindu men. \n\n\n- Blacks, good on a personal basis as long as you are in higher ed professional setting not near ghetto or woke poltical crowd. Christian immigrants from africa carribean are good as long as they are more into church music over rap gangsta wannabes. Non somali eastern africans are extremely understanding to us. Muslim blacks dont like us unless we are Muslim. \n\n\n- Latin plus southern Europeans extra extra friendly, more ambitious and family minded than whites. Beautiful warm. Women. But unlike whites or jews, not sure if sentiment remains upon disagreements. I would have want to settle in southern europe or safer parts of latam if not India. Gangsta dirt poor ones not included. \n\n\n- Asian men, get along the most with them more than other Indians. Especially, the south east Asian ones (indonesian muslims hands up, Malaysian ones as worse as bangladeshi ones). Sinhalabuddhist catholics treated me better than SL tamils (Christians were bad) . 2nd gen koreans are less racist than fob koreans. \n\n\nNon japanese Asian women? More racist against us than Nazis, unless they are too ugly to be a sellout to white men, EXCEPT vietnamese fobs or half-thai ones. \n\n\n- Surprise exception: francophone muslim women  levantine or North african ones and ex soviet central asian muslim women are very truly liberal in terms of sexuality and european values moreso than fake indian islamophobia accusing feminists. For these women, sexual competition from liberal french or Russian women stealing their men makes them one up on it to play catch up. \n\n\n- The best indicator of how women treat you or how attractive other women are as competition thats why you see  fat ugly feminists pro islamists wanting to cover up bikini supermodels in burkas out of jealousy.\n\n\n- Eastern europeans are ill mannered and crass but they are the same to each other not just us. Neutral to positive opinions on other Europeans. Irish and Scots are friendly while English run policy by money over values unlike the French. \n\n\n- Very positive experience with Jews as Indian but noticed they are more insular to non asians prolly cause of bad history. \n\n\n- Dutch are direct to the point and best folks to do business with. Afrikaaner are as brave as non-london british and not as racist as they are accused to be. \n\n\n- young gen gaming adict hollywood junkies arent refined and lazy entitled brats unlike those born before 1985, same in india\n\n\nWill add more soon. \n\n\nPatterns I notice gets you treated better-\n\n\nLooks! Light skinned Indians who look italian or like tall athletic blacks get treated much better by everyone, especially the girls. If you are dark male you would do much better in west than in india. \n\n\nThose who look distinctively skinny fat or skinny short dark Indian with the pedostache and bad dress sense and accent will be bullied by the blacks muslims and avoided by the asians or whites or  2nd gen desi\n\n\nMoney! Stick yourself to professional crowds you will be respected but not on political and casual sphere. \n\n\nGangsters. There is a reason why world is going RW, being betabux bank account is not respected inhigh tax regimes even by gold digging women. Thats why you see 2nd gen kids of even doctors playing pretend gangsta let alone mirpuri or khalistani blue collar ones - those tantrums work with loose white women there. \n\n\nDo you resonate? Disagree. I dont mean to prime but these are patterns I cant ignore. Please share.\n\n\nEdit: automod  keeps removing it for cross posting?

The theme is slightly different and is OC so request the mod to not remove.\n\nThere are a number of books that one can read to cause the kind of civil unrest witnessed during Shaheen Bagh and Farmer protests. But this is abhorrent for the common citizenry (like you and me) and silent candle marches are just a trope now. So, let me share a few ideas which are peaceful, follow social distancing, and can send a loud message to the concerned parties. *Inspired slightly by Munnabhai MBBS.*\n\nHere are ways to celebrate and make your voice heard:\n\n1. Play loud festive music. If it is aarti or devotional music, all the better. The chance of offending the neighbours is lesser.\n2. Remember the request Modiji made about an year ago about banging pots and pans. Please follow his instructions again. Call people in your neighbourhood and organize it at a particular time and videotape the clangs echoing in the neighbourhood. Send to local media channels with a short message like "Holi ki pawri ho rahi hai".\n3. Take lots of photos of faces of family members with colour on them and people drenched in colours. Then tweet them out. Do not forget to tag everyone who commented about Diwali or Holi recently. Show to them that you \'appreciate\' their opinion about how to celebrate Holi.\n4. Buy Holi greeting cards and colour packets from Dharmic shops and use a Dharmic business to send it to your local MLA. Do not forget to add a personal note along the lines of "Wishing you a Happy Holi. Thanks for your immeasurable support." Members of legislature who really \'enjoy\' Hindu festivals should definitely be given special consideration.\n5. If you or your group is especially thankful to a prominent person, please buy these gifts and in person deliver it to the person. Maintain decorum, form a queue with 6 feet gap and do ring the bell to greet them. Bells are considered to be able to cleanse mind and soul. I am sure consistent doorbells will bring joy to them.\n6. While others dump animal dung in legislators houses, this is illegal and not Dharmic. Kindly consider buying garlands of flowers from a local flower shop and get it delivered. The smell of flowers after a few days do make it an especially pleasant affair. Also, you are supporting your local artisans.\n7. Such ideas have a low-cost impact on individuals, can be anonymous for the most part and can really show how you plan to support your local lawmaker in the next 5 years.\n8. These expressions of joy can also be utilized by writing a postcard to your local MLA with the content "Greetings from Indraprastha"/"Greetings from Bhagyanagar" etc. The more, the merrier. Similarly, if there is a recent display of communal harmony from a person, please do wish the person with "Get well soon" wishes govt postcard.\n9. *Kindly DO NOT take out your bike\'s silencer and annoy everyone. This is a known modus operandi of hooligans and public harassers of women.

Festivals in India have always played multiple roles. They have connected people to each other, connected people to the divine, and connected people to the world about them. Nearly every festival is a celebration, where neighbours come out of their houses to meet each other, visit friends and proudly and with great joy shake away the blues and mundaneness of the daily life.\n\nOur festivals have their own history, traditions, food, dresses, prayers and fond memories. Festivals have been the glue of the Bharatiya samaaj from time immemorial. I would go so far as to say that unlike Western festivals (New Year, Valentines, Mother's Day etc.) celebrated in India nowadays, our traditional days do not lead to a feeling of loneliness and depression. Even if you are not in your region, you can participate in a regional festival on the same day, albeit with a different name and traditions.\n\nEvery Indian knows this. Then why am I saying this. Because I want you to remember that festivals are an ESSENTIAL part of our way of living. In fact, our lives are meant to be a joyous occasion in themselves. So, when our festivals are maligned and our traditions distorted to suit someone's agenda we should stay strong. However, when governments start banning and completely restricting them, then we must act. No, I do not seek any violent or vulgar display of power or public anger. That is not the Indian way.\n\nI propose that you enjoy your festivities as a mark of civil disobedience. Yes, the virus is around. So, limit your gathering to one or 2 families only. But, ensure to enjoy yourselves. Play with colours. Share your greeting and sweets. If, however, you want to stay extra safe, then at least play festive music loudly during the day. Will it cause discomfort to others? Maybe. But, we have to take a stance.\n\n*We‚Äôre fighting for our right to live, to exist.* [We will not go quietly into the night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V16tMmTezFQ)*. We will not vanish without a fight. We‚Äôre going to live on. We‚Äôre going to survive.* Never forget, we are the free citizens of a great civilization.\n\nHoli ki aapko shubhkamnaye! Happy Holi! Stay Safe! Enjoy Life!"<br />Author: 'halla-nahi-hamla-bol'<br />id: 'mevy8x'<br />Flair ::oc-: OC ‡§π‡•à BC!üí°</li><li>Title: 'G*and chatayi by Delhi Police (THE BINDU PAPER)'<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4fq5ykjakpp61.jpg?width=296&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fce4368b4356563aa5c5a5b0b0d7f488529767ed\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mj31l9jakpp61.jpg?width=312&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f8f05a431834d0e6811c8a7ffdd1caaa79883d0'<br />Author: 'Ok-Expression8911'<br />id: 'mevlq2'<br />Flair :Mudi Rejine :topkek:</li><li>Title: 'How long it would take for a woke to come up with this narrative'<br />Body: 'If the kids have the right explore their sexuality and can learn about safe sex; if pedophilia is just a mental disorder and incest is not bad if done safely, why should the kids be denied of their right to have sexual pleasure?

The summary of her Instagram account is - Ugly faces with accompanying preachy sermons on caste/gender(cis het badüò°)/privilege, basically issues she thinks she\'s an expert on \n\nNow I totally sympathise with the fact that trans people have a hard time coming out and being at peace with themselves and just being left the hell alone without all the bullying/tormenting/teasing. But this lady just takes it to a whole new level. First of all I find it ironic that she chides literally every cis het male for their "cis het male privilege" and how cis het males are far more privileged than her while she has the economic wherewithal to get a gender reassignment surgery+ hormonal therapy costing 13 lakhs AND an education in medicine from a private university while thousands of cis het males struggle to get even a decent undergraduate education, let alone fill the craters associated with their identity. \n\nSecond of all she uses her trans identity to shit on the govt(CAA/Farmer\'s protests) which literally has nothing to do with her trans identity lol. I mean with respect to letting LGBTQ marriages prevail she has a bone to pick, but apart from that I see little relevance \n\nThird - Inherent assumption that all cis het people are monsters and filthy SOBs. Look I get you might have been treated badly by cis het people but that gives you no right to demonize all of us. But then again this is the #AllMen mentality which strangely never translates to #AllMuslims. Now when someone pointed out the irony in her post that hating someone based on their sexual orientation is precisely the thing you\'re fighting against so isn\'t it hypocritical of you to engage in the same, she says "A minority is allowed to hate on the majority but not the other way around"(WTF?!)\n\nFourth - If you don\'t date trans women, you\'re transphobic. \n\nNo I\'m not. It\'s my life, and I am have all the right to choose who i wish to be romantically involved with. You may be great as a friend and I wouldn\'t mind going out and getting drinks with you, but I just can\'t get into a physical relationship with someone who is biologically male. Maybe it\'s my prejudice but when it comes to love, everyone is motivated by prejudice. Think of someone you love and try coming up with a logic based proof. You can\'t because it doesn\'t work like that. \n\n\nThese are just a few I can think of, but I\'d love to here your opinions!'<br />Author: 'Gunpowder_gelatin765'<br />id: 'm6ssti'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: 'It has been 7 years where is the uniform civil code we were promised'<br />Body: "I am sick of waiting.

It will continue to go unabated. \n* Their toxic mechanisms include "cancel culture" and the mainstreaming of the "liberal voices". These ideas have a perfect ground due to the education system. \n* There are enough parallels between here and the US. Social media has assumed an outsize influence- Facebook/WhatsApp/Twitter. WhatsApp, specifically, is more insidious because they are using real-time data to trigger unrest in India through artificial intelligence mechanisms. The recent farmer\'s protests are merely a glimpse into what we will observe by 2024.\n\nThere is no straightforward way to counter it, although I can suggest a few changes: \n\n* Delete giant tech media. (I have archived this sub on the Telegram app through the bot), so in case the subreddit gets deleted (or deplatformed), it will have the last post till the time the tap is shut. \n* Join on alternative media like Telegram+Gab (and have presence on other digital mediums like Discord etc). \n* Aggregate+ work for a common goal for defending your faith. It means revival through regular Satsangs. Remember, the illustrious statesman Bal Gangadhar Tilak gave the call for Swarajaya by reviving the traditional Marathi Ganpati Utsav and realigned everyone to their roots. If your roots are strong, no one can uproot you. \n* Share ideas far and wide for national cultural revivalism and explore your own beliefs.

While the Urs sanskritised and anglicised themselves they were still regarded as an inferior caste by these landed communities. This post shall be about how they forged matrimonial alliances with the Rajputs, to buttress their Kshatriya status. \n\nWhen Maharaja Chamarajendra Wodeyar participated in the Imperial Assemblage held at Delhi in 1877 at the age of fourteen, he was treated with every mark of consideration as one belonging to the first rank of princes along with the Nizam of Hyderabad. But behind all the pomp and glory, he may have realised that among the Indian princes, Mysore was not regarded as highly as other Kshatriyas, and felt the isolation. He wished to enter the imperial space that the Kshatriyas in the North had already established through marriage alliances with each other.\n\nAfter the unfortunate loss of Chamarajendra Wodeyar to diphtheria , the Maharani, who then became the Regent on behalf of her young son, Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, asked the British for assistance to fulfil her late husband‚Äôs wishes. \n\nBut the letters from the British agents in the north were all disappointing. They all said that the Rajput chiefs did not recognise the Mysore family as belonging to their caste and that there would be difficulties in effecting a matrimonial alliance with Mysore, unless possibly a beginning could be made by marrying a Mysore princess to a Rajput chief. The Maharao of Kotah, who had recently lost his Udaipur wife, wanted to marry a Mysore princess with Rs. five lakhs of dowry, which was a huge amount of money considering that the civil list of Mysore Maharaja was then fourteen lakhs. Meanwhile, the Urs clan strongly opposed against the idea of giving Mysore princesses away. The Maharani refused, feeling uneasy about sending her young daughter away among ‚Äòpeople of strange language and habits‚Äô. By failing to give Mysore princesses to the Rajput chiefs, Mysore made it even more difficult for them to find a bride for the young Maharaja.\n\nNonetheless efforts continued and in 1898 a Mysore deputation was sent to north India, and Diwan Sheshadri Iyer in his Memo of Instruction stressed on ‚Äúhistory‚Äù stating that the Wodeyars ‚Äúemigrated from Dwaraka many generations ago‚Äù and belonged to the same stock as the Rajput ruling houses. The mythological origin stories of Yaduraya Wodeyar were printed in Kannada as Annals of the Mysore Royal Family and used as history text book in schools. With that, myth became fact.\n\nThey also made clear several promises on the side of Mysore. Any money or property which the bride‚Äôs father might wish to give her would be her own, the Mysore royal house would not take any dowry [this was not strange in the local context as dowry in the South is considered to be a new phenomenon. Traditionally, wedding expenses and the exchanging of gifts was shared much less asymmetrically between the bride‚Äôs kin and the groom‚Äôs kin, since South Indian kinship system was more isogamous compared (Srinivas 1984: 10)]. It was also asserted that Krishnaraja would remain monogamous while the bride was alive. \n\nThe tradition of endogamous marriage between the Wodeyars and the Urs was broken for the first time by the marriage of Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV with a princess from Vana, Kathiawar in 1900.  But this was not without compromise as there was a huge gap in the political status in the imperial order between them. Vana was just 62 square kms large, with population of just 2,749 and an annual revenue of a paltry Rs. 38,900. Their ruler was not even granted a gun salute by the British while Mysore was one of the three states at the time to be accorded the 21 gun salute, the highest of honours. The royal wedding itself cost Rs. 20 lakh. Krishnaraja Wodeyar was worth USD 56 Billion in today‚Äôs prices. \n\nWith this marriage the ice was broken and marriages with north Indian princely states has continued ever since. The last king of the dynasty, Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar, the nephew of Krishnaraja Wodeyar ‚Äì also married a princess from north India. She was from Charkhari, a princely state in Uttar Pradesh, which had the privilege of a 11 gun salute.\n\nAn interesting fact is that the Mysore royal family, did not have any ‚Äòrajput blood‚Äô till 2017 as none of the foreign marriages had produced any offspring. This was attributed to a curse believed to be cast on the Wadiyars in 1612 by Alamelamma, wife of King Tirumalaraja, who ruled the Vijaynagar Empire. It is believed that when her jewels were being taken under the orders of the Wodeyar ruler, she ran over to a cliff overlooking the Kaveri river and cursed before jumping to death :\n\n&gt; "Talakadu MaraLagali, Malangi Maduvagali, Mysooru Arasarige Makkalaagadirali" ( May Talakadu become a barren land, Malangi turn into a whirlpool and may Mysore kings never beget children).\n\nThis curse was however broken by the birth of a baby boy to Yaduveer Wodeyar (the adopted son of Rani Pramoda Devi) and the princess of Dungarpur in 2017.\n\nReferences: Ikegame, Aya.
