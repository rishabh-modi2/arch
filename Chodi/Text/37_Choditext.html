<li>Title: "It's something that I wrote after 2014 elections. My grammar is bit poor here but please give it a try!"<br />Body: "Once\xa0upon a time in a land far far away, there was a kingdom where the Champion of town was chosed by a game of chess and he was deemed worthy to rule them all. Yes, you heard me right, it was a\xa0 town of intellects and their Champion and Ruler was chosen by a Game of Chess. There were three contenders who set their claim to the Champion's Throne. All of three were different in their talent, background and ideology. First one was a Champion already but of smaller region who wanted to become the best of them all. Little low in formal education but highly skilled in practical knowlesge, he was A Messiah to some. As legend have it, he burned all his enemies alive. This was reason that he was hated by some but loved by many. Of all the talents he possessed, his speech was most finest and with smartest of council to guide him, he surely was everyone's bet. The Second Champion was highly qualified and who has better chances to win a Game of Chess then who had finest education. He was a nobody few time before but his Revolutions guided by his Saint Guru made him a household name. He was so dedicated to win the throne that he abandoned his previous throne to give full effort in biggest match of his life. Legend says about him that he had a Revolutionary Idea which was guaranteed to reform the world as we know it. The Common folk loves nothing more than a revolution so The Second Champ was sure their favourite pick. The Third Champ came from a House of Champions whose history was older than time. He was the youngest of them all. He grew up in a World of Champions hearing about the tales of his legendary ancestors. His plans to win the game were doubted but he not even once doubted himself and who can defeat one who believes in himself. So now let's arrive at The Judgement Day i.e. Day of Championship. Now the dilemma was that chess is a game of two people and contenders were three so who were to start the game. The First Champion started his treacherous tricks even before the game and asked the other two contenders to show their pair of dice which were must in a Game of Chess or so he claimed. The Second Champ understood the plot and asked the first champ not to worry about his fate. The Third Champ was confused and embarrassed on how he forgot to bring\xa0 the dice. So he apologised and left The Championship so that he could prepare for next fight. As stupid it seems but First Champ trick worked because his stupid trick outwitted The Third Champ. Now with Two Final Contenders decided Board and all it's pieces were set and so the match began. First Champion plan was simple to win the match based on the facts and methods of book but with his little touch. The Second Champion plan was unclear to all as during most of the game he was whining and crying over foul play of The First Champion while Judges could spot none. As history have it Stupid tricks won over Real methods on very rare night and unfortunately to The Second Champ, it was not one of those nights. Hence The First Champion won the Game with Checkmate and almost all his peices intact. Hence he was crowned the Champion of them all hence One worthy to Rule them All. The Second Champ was still whining and crying while whole kingdom laughed to his face. Many claimed that the reason of his defeat was that he deflected from paths of his Saint Guru. So for coming years The First Champion ruled over the Kingdom and as he used to say Good days didn't seem so far away.\nNow I want to thank you for being a patience reader and would like to ask you to read this story again. Also this time bear in mind that it is not my original work but a story inspired from Great Indian Politics. Yes...The Champion One was Our Present Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Council of Amit Shah at back.The Second Champion was Arvind Kejriwal with his Guru Anna Hazaray guidence. The Third Champion was Rahul Gandhi with the legendary family name. Indian Politics really is more intersting than anything.

Nirmala Sitharaman under the theme ‘Aspirational India’. \n\n&gt;&gt;“The Government proposes to start a program whereby the urban local bodies across the country would provide internship opportunities to fresh engineers for a period up to one year.” \n&gt;&gt;\nGovt. Announcement\n\nSuch a program will help reap the benefits of India’s demographic dividend as it is poised to have the largest working-age population in the world in the coming years.\n\nGeneral education may not reflect the depth of productive knowledge present in society. Instead of approaching education as ‘doing by learning,’ our societies need to reimagine education as ‘learning by doing.’\n\nTULIP- “The Urban Learning Internship Program” would help fulfill twin goals of providing interns with hands-on learning experience as well as infusing fresh energy and ideas in the functioning of India’s ULBs and Smart Cities.\n\n#What is TULIP ?\nThe Urban Learning Internship Program (TULIP)’ is a program for providing internship opportunities to fresh graduates in all Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and Smart Cities across the country.\n\nThe TULIP portal has been developed by AICTE. Under the internship programme students will get to work for 100 smart cities under ministry of housing and urban development.\n\nThe platform is customizable and provides immense flexibility to both ULBs/ Smart Cities and interns to enable convenient access. Security features have been thoroughly tested and the platform has been made scalable, federated and transparent by design.\n\nAn MoU has also been signed between MoHUA and AICTE. The MoU, inter alia, lays down roles and responsibilities of AICTE and MoHUA over a period of 5 years. Technical support for the platform shall be anchored by AICTE and the programmatic non-technical support shall be anchored by MoHUA.\n\n#Who are Eligible to apply ?\nThe internships under TULIP are open to Indian Citizens who graduate from an undergraduate program can apply within 18 months from graduating. It is open to courses and streams as prescribed by ULBs/smart cities in their requirements and both AICTE affiliated and non-AICTE college graduates can apply.\n\n#What will be the Stipend of such internships ?\nThe stipend and its amount are under the scope and purview of the specific ULB/smart city one is applying to. Any stipend or allowance amount, if provided or not, will be mentioned in the perks and allowances section of the internship posted by the ULB/smart city.\n\n**[FAQ's](https://internship.aicte-india.org/module_ulb/Dashboard/TulipMain/faq.php#accordion)**\n\n**[Webportal](https://internship.aicte-india.org/index.php)**\n\n**[TULIP Portal](https://internship.aicte-india.org/module_ulb/Dashboard/TulipMain/index.php)**\n\n**[PDF Brochure](https://internship.aicte-india.org/module_ulb/Dashboard/TulipMain/Handbook.pdf)**\n\nSource: https://www.rajras.in/index.php/the-urban-learning-internship-program-tulip-launched-by-union-govt/"<br />Author: 'CholiMein'<br />id: 'gwn6q5'<br />Flair :Bakchod News</li>

So, I want your opinions over this.\n\nAs we all know that during this global pandemic, our country has seen an extremely poor doctor-population ratio.\n With India likely to shortly begin reeling under a massive\xa0doctor\xa0shortage, the government is now considering letting fifth-year medical students join India's\xa0CoronaVirus\xa0fighter brigade.\n\nEveryone knows that NEET is the only entrance exam which allows every student to become a Doctor.\nWell, I have enormous knowledge about it and I've seen various articles concerned with this.\n\nSo my conclusion is there is one doctor for every 1,445 Indians as per the country's current population estimate of 135 crore, which is lower than the WHO's prescribed norm of one doctor for 1,000 people.\n\nNEET\xa0is abolishing the quality of our medical education as it is based on\xa0NEET\xa0scoring only. The\xa0NEET is not\xa0a\xa0well\xa0thought out policy and badly rushed and implemented without any social justice or research base. It's like some advisors proposed\xa0NEET\xa0without any policy analysis beforehand.\n\nMost of the students are from the rural and poor background they can't get proper education hence, a disadvantage for them and for the country as well.\nSince they've studied in the State Board and we all know there is a vast difference between CBSE and State Board.\n\nSouthern Indian state, Tamil Nadu has been contradicting NEET from many years due to various justifications related to the quality of NEET.\n\nIn 2018, 49 questions were wrongly translated in the Tamil language hence, The Madras High Court order to give 196 marks to every Tamil student but Supreme Court overruled this and also NEET paper was leaked twice so one can't believe in the exam fairness.\n\nI just want to know your opinions over this, what do you think about this if it is good or not? \nOur country should change this or not?\n\nStay Safe, Take care.\n\nJai Hind 🇮🇳"<br />Author: 'studmuffin1119'<br />id: 'gwinaj'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: 'Why India is still 80% Hindu if Muslim invaders were barbaric .'<br />Body: "Majority of India remained untouched by Muslim invaders the only reason was huge population and isolated self sufficent village structure. So what happen in city /towns and it's surrounding was never effect the villages as they have to gave tax to a fix authority( local landlords) . So major actrocities were done in so called city/town and trade routes of those time and that's why you will see Muslim culture influence mostly limited to urban areas. Muslim where-ever have a strong hold tried to penetrate that self sufficient village structure by forced conversion which was mostly limited to North India that's why castism is still equally present in Muslim because they changed only religion of that self suffcient society that's why presence of Islam in rural India mostly limited to North India or bengal. Muslim doesn't provide any new opportunity. They tried where ever they can try to spread islam forcefully according to their limited capability. They were barbaric Islamic fanatics. We all knew about jajiya tax and not a single 300 old temple in North India.....all the remaing one are either hidden or burried for eg kujrao or sachi stupa.\n\nAlso with partition a population shift happen if we take account the population of Indian subcontinent then our share decrease to 55-60%. As our nation divided on base of religion India was the nation for Hindu. We all knew 95% &amp; 90% majority countries pakistan and bengladesh respetively  were once 100% dharmic. So Muslim were barbaric Islamic fanatics not some sugar coated ruler these leftist try to potray.

<li>Title: 'Perhaps some northeasterners deserve racism. Perhaps.'<br />Body: 'After seeing 6 consecutive completely black images on IG and thinking something was wrong with my phone, I thought I\'d share my opinion on northeasterners being called "chinky". \n\nFor background, I\'m from Arunachal Pradesh, grew up there and never been to the Indian mainland (except for a school excursion a few years ago; more on that later). Not until I had to leave for college (Dehradun).\n\nNow, this is solely based on my domicile state only. Although if a general hate for non northeastern Indians(there\'s a lot of it) counts as racism, I\'d say a small percentage of the northeast is racist. In Arunachal Pradesh, there\'s a term used to describe any non northeastern Indian - haaring. To me, it\'s the equivalent of being called chinky. The word "haaring" or in some cases "nipak" is used in a derogatory sense. The problem is that this word has been around for some time. Idk where and how it originated exactly, but the entirety of the generation before ours seem to use it. Bc mere hi maa bap use karte hai iss word ko. I did too, until I had some sense knocked into me. And a huge percentage of, if not, the entire state uses this word on any non northeastern Indian. The thing that bugged me the most is that some of my former female classmates(mostly) put up stories on IG  a few years back, complaining that people were being racist, calling them chinky or momo and all that crap. I understand that this is a bad thing but like, bro, you do that too. To the same people. To another Indian. And you expect it to stop? Kaun sa maal fuk raha hai tu? \n\nFor me personally,  I was just racially profiled once- in that school excursion i mentioned. Some kid called me chinky and a nepali. Bhai chunky bula le, mind nahi karunga. Bc nationality change mat kar mera, haath jodta hu. Even in college, I have friends and they horse around with me and vice versa. They call me corona I call them AIDS and Ebola(not the most accurate comeback but comeon ,chamgadar kaun khata hai bhai?). \n\nAnyway, that\'s my opinion on racism against northeasterners (esp my bros from Arunachal).

I see a lot of people predicting that this country will be go down the drain and the radical left and pseudo liberals will take over. Well my friends, this had already been happening from 8th Century B.C. (First Islamic Invasion) to 2014. \n\nWe are hearing more and more about forced conversion and anti-Hindu propaganda nowadays. But the reason behind it is that people are now calling it out fearlessly and reacting against it. Anti-Hindu propaganda has always existed and will continue to exist until the end of time.\n\nBut we won't be taken down by such a small thing. WE are the first and last of the great ancient civilizations, we have withstood the test of time, calamities, atrocities, war and every other imaginable hurdle known to mankind. You can't ideologically enslave 100 crore + people forever. The statistics prove it. A nationalistic govt. won for a second time with an even greater margin. Numbers don't lie, they are the absolute truth of the universe and the closest thing to the handwriting of god. \n\nSlowly but steadily we will overcome these problems and deal with these idiots trying to bring us down. But we all have to play a part in it. The govt. can't and won't do everything on it's own.\n\nWe will be there when humanity becomes an interplanetary civilization, we will be there when humanity becomes a galactic civilization and we will be there when humanity becomes an inter-galactic civilization.\n\nSo my brothers and sisters, hold your head high and fearlessly, be proud of your identity and work together for the development of this great nation.\n\nJai Hind, Jai Bharat"<br />Author: 'tundra_tea_party'<br />id: 'gvqmcw'<br />Flair :HQ Text Bakchodi</li>

Cows need to be pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk. First, they’re impregnated through artificial insemination, then after the delivery, newborn calves are separated from their mothers immediately after birth so the cows can be milked. *Then Male calves are starved to death because hypocrite nazi Gau-Rakshaks banned cow slaughter in many states.* \n\nIf you think chickens have it worse, then think again, cows are subjected to much more cruelty in the dairy industry. At least chickens have to suffer for few weeks, but cows have to suffer for years before they stop producing milk. In the wild, cattle may live up to 20 years. But since they’re artificially impregnated every year, it cause their bodies to deteriorate at the age of just four years.\n\nA lot of people think cows are holy in this fascist india and are treated like deities. But they don’t have a revered godly status because we librandus eat them, they are referred to as "gau mata", which came about because we wanted to justify taking milk from cows and wanted to appear good doing so. Calling the cow mother makes it seem like we are respecting the cow and that the cow is giving us the milk by her own will, just like a mother. \n\nMost vegetarian Hindus are fascistly delusional enough to believe that litres of milk they’re wasting in temples doesn’t come from exploitation. In fact we’re running the biggest cattle exploitation industry on the planet and feel superior while doing so. Chaddis are amazingly asshole.\n\nI’m a meat eater, yay right I will blame vegetarians while I eat halal meat, so I’m not the one to say but “religious” fascist vegetarians are the biggest hypocrites Modi bhakts'<br />Author: 'xxiwisk'<br />id: 'gtz2x3'<br />Flair :Randia Simulation</li>

<li>Title: 'Wow I am amazed by how accurate this is'<br />Body: 'In Dr. Peter Hammond’s book, “Slavery, Terrorism and Islam,” he documents the way Muslims slowly develop a presence in various countries and as their population numbers build, become more aggressive and assertive about exercising Sharia law.\n\nOpen, free, democratic societies are particularly vulnerable. “When politically correct, tolerant, and culturally diverse societies agree to Muslim demands for their religious privileges, some of the other components tend to creep in as well,” he notes.\n\n\n\n“Islam is not a religion, nor is it a cult. In its fullest form, it is a complete, total, 100% system of life,” Dr. Hammond notes in his book. “Islam has religious, legal, political, economic, social, and military components. The religious component is a beard for all of the other components.”\n\nTheir takeover of a country, what Dr. Hammond refers to as “Islamization,” begins when the population of Muslims reaches a critical mass, and they being to agitate for various privileges.\n\nOpen, free, democratic societies are particularly vulnerable. “When politically correct, tolerant, and culturally diverse societies agree to Muslim demands for their religious privileges, some of the other components tend to creep in as well,” he notes.\nWhen the Muslim population remains under 2% in a country, they will be seen primarily as a peace-loving minority and not as a threat to other citizens. \n\nUnited States — Muslim 0.6%\n\nAustralia — Muslim 1.5%\n\nCanada — Muslim 1.9%\n\nAs the Muslim population reaches 2% to 5%, they begin to recruit from ethnic minorities and disaffected groups, within prisons and street gangs. \n\nUnited Kingdom — Muslim 2.7%\n\nSpain — Muslim 4%\n\nThailand — Muslim 4.6%\n\nFrom 5% on, they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population,” Dr. Hammond notes. “For example, they will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic standards) food” and increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature such food on their shelves — along with threats for failure to comply.\n\nFrance — Muslim 8%\n\nPhilippines — 5%\n\nSweden — Muslim 5%\n\nSwitzerland — Muslim 4.3%\n\n\nSoon they begin to apply pressure to allow Sharia law within their own communities (sometimes ghettos).\n\n“When Muslims approach 10% of the population, they tend to increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions,” Dr. Hammond notes. “In Paris, we are already seeing car-burnings. Any non-Muslim action offends Islam, and results in uprisings and threats, such as in Amsterdam, with opposition to Mohammed cartoons and films about Islam.” \n\nIndia — Muslim 13.4% (riots, separatism)\n\nIsrael — Muslim 16% (Palestine)\n\nKenya — Muslim 10% (Boko Haram)\n\nRussia — Muslim 15% (Chechen extremists) \n\n\nThe violence increases when the Muslim population reaches 20%. “After reaching 20%, nations can expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations, sporadic killings, and the burnings of Christian churches and Jewish synagogues,\n\n\nAt 40%, nations experience widespread massacres, chronic terror\xa0attacks, and ongoing militia warfare,” such as in:\n\nBosnia — Muslim 40%\n\nChad — Muslim 53.1%\n\nLebanon — Muslim 59.7% \n\n\nFrom 60%, persecution of non-believing “infidels” rises significantly, including sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia law as a weapon,\xa0and Jizya, a tax placed on infidels, such as in:\n\nAlbania — Muslim 70%\n\nMalaysia — Muslim 60.4%\n\n\nAfter 80%, expect daily intimidation and violent jihad, some State-run ethnic cleansing, and even some genocide, as these nations drive out “infidels,” and move toward a 100% Muslim society, which has been experienced to some degree in:\n\nBangladesh — Muslim 83%\n\nEgypt — Muslim 90%\n\nGaza — Muslim 98.7%\n\nIndonesia — Muslim 86.1%\n\nIran — Muslim 98%\n\nPakistan — Muslim 97%\n\nPalestine — Muslim 99%\n\nSyria — Muslim 90%\n\nA 100% Muslim society will theoretically usher in their version of peace — the peace of ‘Dar-es-Salaam’ — the Islamic House of Peace. “Here there’s supposed to be peace, because everybody is a Muslim, the Madrassas are the only schools, and the Koran is the only word,” such as in:\n\nAfghanistan — Muslim 100%\n\nSaudi Arabia — Muslim 100%\n\nSomalia — Muslim 100%\n\nYemen — Muslim 100%\n\n\nMore dangerous are the demographic trends. “Today’s 1.5 billion Muslims make up 22% of the world’s population,” he observes. “But their birth rates dwarf the birth rates of Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews, and all other believers.\xa0Muslims will exceed 50% of the world’s population by the end of this century."\n\nThanks to Erwinlives.'<br />Author: 'RLR_1'<br />id: 'gtc2v9'<br />Flair :HQ Text Bakchodi</li>
<li>Title: 'Letter from India: RAND Corporation'<br />Body: "[This is a letter](https://www.rand.org/pubs/documents/D10703.html) written by an American expert in July 1962, just prior to the Indo-China war of 1962. It is an assessment of the bleak situation of that time. I can't say if all assertions are true but it shows what the Americans thought at that time.\n\nTL;DR: India (ie Nehru) never considered China a major threat even in July 1962. The main obsession remained Pakistan. Army was not allowed to retaliate against Chinese aggression, which began months after Indo-China friendship treaty 1954. Army is deliberately kept under-equipped by Menon. China planned to attack India in 1960, but were coincidentally thwarted by rebellion in Xinjiang, orchestrated by the Russians. \n\nHighlights:\n\n* China section of the Ministry of External Affairs is dominated by a pro-Chinese group of which R. K. Nehru is a leading member (from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratan_Kumar_Nehru): RK Nehru is a close relative of Jawahar)\n* Indian policy regarding China: \n   *  Communism, according to Nehru, does not imply violence or expansionism \n   *  war might develop into a major one \n   *  Russians would come to the rescue \n*  main obsession continues to be Pakistan \n* Ambassador to China, K. M. Panikkar: may be responsible for Nehru's decision to recognize Chinese sovereignty over Tibet. His daughter is married to a leading Communist labor leader. \n* Chinese aggression commenced within three months after the signing of the 1954 Indo-Chinese Treaty \n*  The Army favored resistance, but was overruled by Menon (defense minister)\n   * **supplies deliberately withheld** from Indian troops in the affected areas \n   * ordered **not to retaliate**. \n   * considerable unhappiness about this in the Army \n* Army is confident that it could stop the Chinese if it were ordered to do so, but they have received **no special training or equipment** for mountain warfare \n* Helicopters were purchased from Russia, but were found to be unsuitable for high altitudes \n* Chinese are training Indian guerrillas in Tibet, but no similar action has been taken by the Indians.\n\nThe author also quotes from a book *The Chinese Aggression* by a Dr. Satyanarayan Sinha:\n\n* China planned to attack India in 1960\n* in March 1960, a large number of revolts against the Chinese occupying forces flared up in several parts of Sinkiang \n* these were instigated and supported by Russian men and weapons \n\nQuoting a Russian Kazakh from the book:\n\n* Central Asian Soviet Intelligence was the only outside agency which understood the international gravity and the consequent results of the war moves of the Chinese \n*  It was by coincidence that the Soviet Union in its own interests realised the urgency and took measures to stop the Chinese advance, planned to cut deep into the Indian borders \n* Provoking successful revolts in Sinkiang may not prove enough to stop their onward march. Ultimately we shall have to think of stumping their spearhead \n* It would have been much simpler had India helped us in our efforts to smash the war-craze of the Chinese."<br />Author: 'space_diplomat'<br />id: 'gtakpo'<br />Flair :Research</li>
<li>Title: 'Stop criticising Modi...!!'<br />Body: "Economy, education sector and Hinduism. These three are major areas where every right wing supporter has problem with Modi govt. \n\nI don't understand what kind of magic do people expect from govt. Do you realise that even if Modi doesn't change anything in education policy and simply tries to discipline the primary schools already existing. Let the conversions and everything anti Hindu going on in country to continue for next 5 years and let economy with its imperfect policies take whatever shape in due course of time (ofcourse it will not run into ground), still this govt is the only option you have. \n\nMy opinion : This term govt will only focus on Water supply, Indian penal code changes, Uniform civil code, population control bill and anti conversion laws. Obviously many more changes will be brought but these are the major ones. Just these and add 370 abrogation and Ram mandir decision. If these planned changes are actually brought, these 5 years will be remembered as revolutionary in India political history.\n\nThere are many things that needs to be done before Modi govt can even think about issues of religious conversion and communist text books. \n\nBe assured that no changes in school syllabus or text books will come before 24, Temples will remain under govt, communist will cause bloodbath under the veil of free speech and democracy in coming elections. Ridiculously high amounts will be offered as freebies, all media will be sold out, azadi slogans along with hanuman chalisa will be part of campaigns. \n\nYour rant and demand of everything at once will only cause fault lines which leftist are only going to exploit. I see these impatient young people who start to abuse BJP for everything wrong with country. Guys keep patience, except few people in cabinet every other political leader is willing to sell anything for votes. Just imagine if these communist ever got in power again, what havoc they will bring upon whole country.\n\nInfact, bust them with facts. Support right wing social media persons. And please watch this video, it shows you mirror for a while, [harsh truth of patriotic Indians](https://youtu.be/LANe_3CZgVk).

What does that mean? I help people improve their mental health so that they can prevent/avoid mental health issues. Think of it this way - a trainer and nutritionist can help you get healthy and fit so you're less vulnerable to illness and common injury. But that doesn't mean you won't get hurt, or won't fall sick occasionally, in which case, you will then go to a doctor to help you out. I am that trainer - but for mental health.\n\nThis Sunday, May 31, I will be hosting another session of Happiness for Millennials. This session will be free and open for anyone who would like to participate. [RSVP here](https://forms.gle/AUhsvP2xQUoLJpQM9) by Saturday noon.\n\n**Why should you join this one?**\n\nFor the last couple of months, we've covered two Life Skills modules in our discussions. This Sunday, I will be hosting a special session that will tie together the two modules till now. For anyone who hasn't yet attended a session, **this would be an excellent introduction** to what we've been discussing so far and how it has helped others who have been joining in. For those who have been attending the sessions regularly, it will be an opportunity to put together all our discussions, and see for yourself how far you've come.\n\nUnlike our regular sessions, this one will involve live activities, and give you ideas of how you can actively work on improving your mental health in your daily life.\n\n**How can you make it better?**\n\nGet your friends from wherever in the world to join! If you're staying with family, join in with your family. If you have flatmates/roommates, get them to join! If you're doing Zoom meetings with your colleagues, tell them about this and get them to join! If you have friends/family in other cities, get them to join!\n\nBASICALLY, this series is not for the mentally ill only. These sessions are not a replacement for therapy. These sessions are not only for the unhappy.\n\nNo one really knows what happiness is. So come and let's figure it out together. \n\n[**Here**](https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2020/mar/17/decoding-happiness-2117479.html) is a news article about the webinar series.\n\n[**FAQ here**](https://np.reddit.com/user/monkeyshantiorg/comments/fteb5p/faq_about_happiness_for_millennials/)**.** Pls read before posting your questions.\n\nIf you're interested, pls [RSVP here](https://forms.gle/AUhsvP2xQUoLJpQM9) so I can set up the meet accordingly."<br />Author: 'monkeyshantiorg'<br />id: 'gs08aq'<br />Flair :High IQ</li>

<li>Title: 'Who can challenge Modi in 2024 ?'<br />Body: 'The day before Yesterday NDA 2 completed 1 year in power.\n\nBissmilla e marxisit e lenine e raheem...\n\nAlthough I know 4 years is a long time, but still I want to ask your views who can be a potential competitor to BJP in 2024 ?\n\nHere are some options we have -\n\n1. Aurangzeb - As we know he was the most secular leader we have all the allegations against him are false accusation by RSS.\n2. Bernie sanders - He is the most amazing policymaker in the world, I masturbate regularly to his bald spot.\n3. Sonia Gandhi - Sonia Maa is the definition of the Indian warrior woman, I have her photo in my Namaz chamber.\n4. Dhruv Rathee - He is more knowledgeable than any other man in bajipao sarkar. he is a doctor, scientist, historian and economist. \n5. Ravish Kumar - He is the most honest man on the planet. He is the Akbar of modern times.\n6. My Maullana sahib - He is the best person. he did my khatna and made me a peacefull for free. \n\nOr do you think we would have a new pan India leader who can challenge Modi, Kunal Kamra ? Rajdeep Sirdisai ? A new student leader from JNU ?\n\nP.S - I did not include Rahul Gandhi since it is impossible\n\nAll views are welcome'<br />Author: 'Fluid-Lock'<br />id: 'gq84ve'<br />Flair :Randia Simulation</li>

<li>Title: 'My Fellow Bhratas, What is Haryanavi culture?'<br />Body: "Everybody is welcome to join in. Every region in India has plethora of tangible and intangible attributes of culture which are very famous in general public and when once anyone sees that particular architecture, dance, dress, food or text, They instantly recognize the state.\nTamil Nadu: Chola dynasty, Thanjavur temple, or Bharat natyam\nHimachal Pradesh: Jwalaji temple, Lahaul Spiti, Manikaran\nRajasthan: Too much. dont even know where to start.\nSame with all the others: Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra.\n\nWhat is uniquely Haryanavi? \nHaryanavi Dialect.\nKurukshetra.(but like it has no characteristic architecture while it was capital of Pushyabhutis.)\nEven dances like Ghumar, Loor are mostly derivations, very generalist type and not so widespread.\nRagini and Kushti are quite famous Elements of Music and Martial heritage, but I believe we need more.\nHaryana used to have Harshavardhana's palace at Thanesar in Kurukshetra and Gurjara Pratihara temple of Bhima Devi at Panchkula, but both were destroyed by Delhi Sultanate and Aurangzeb respectively.\n\nWhat do you think we can do to create a concrete identity of Haryana which is rooted in its cultural elements?\nBecause without A culture, people almost always associated Haryana with cliches like Sports, Village life and Our Dialect."<br />Author: 'helmuthxz'<br />id: 'gq7hea'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li>

<li>Title: 'Need help'<br />Body: ' So 4 days back i was playing Pubg duos with random at 3 A.M and then i met this girl who had her mic open and she was saying something about Roza . So i asked her wheather she has kept Roza or not. She replied no and then asked my name .So i  said my name was Rizwan( i was playing with her i am a hindu) and then she said we started talking . I thought she would realise that i am not muslim but she did not. so after 10 minutes i told her myself and then she was laughing and said it was funny and all. Then i came to know she was also from Bangalore and we started talking and then she said that i sounded depressed and  frustrated  (which was true ) and then she told everything will be okay and all. Then she started talking about herself that she has also seen bad days, she was molested by her uncle when he was child and some other stuff. She was pretty open and we talked for about 4 hours in Pubg lobby. Then i asked for her number and she gave it to me. I dont know why but it was like she knows me very well( i forgot to mention she wanted to pursue psychology but could not) and i felt a very strong connection toward her. then 2 days back i called her and started to ask more about her family . She told she is not very close to her father and her father and mother dont sleep in same room. IDK  why did she tell me all that personal stuff but she did. And everytime  i texted or called her it was like she was spying on me, she just knew very much about me.This was driving me crazy, i would just think about her all the time and could not concentrate elsewhere . So then i did what we can call a dick move, i called her yesterday and confessed i was found of her and she was like its cute and funny and she just kept laughing. She said it was Brothers day but i didnt say you anything and i am not even friendzoning you , and said it was just attraction that i had for her.And then .... And now i miss her even more.idk WTF did just happen but idk why it hurts.Sorry for any  grammatical errors.'<br />Author: 'oddgamer1'<br />id: 'gq3hhq'<br />Flair :Shitpost</li>

<li>Title: 'How to fight for Dharma at an individual level.'<br />Body: 'While surfing internet whenever we get time and to support the people who stand for dharma is a part we netizens has to play - there is a part we can play that we often don\'t talk about.\n\nThe propagation and protection of dharma starts at home..it starts with your close group of friends.\n\nYes most of us are busy in studies and jobs to survive in this world - we cannot go out to fight legal battles in the courts ..we as an individual cannot create rules and regulations - we need to focus on an aspect of dharma that need a participation at an individual level . So what can you do :\n\n1.People over centuries tries to destroy our civilization - the thing that saved dharma and tradition of this culture was "Guru-Shishya Parmapara". The knowledge was passed on from parents/Gurus to children so if you wan\'t to defend the dharma starts learning about it -as much as you can - do you know how to read hindu calender - hindu tithis - what are the month of hindu calendar? - if you learn it and pass it to your kids - it cannot be lost. ..what if you are a engineer .. why don\'t you create  amazing Github Libraries to easily implement hindu calender in any application.. yeah we need to pass it on to upcoming generation. Did you learn some important Sanskrit slokas/strotum/aartis etc - give it a try.\n\n2.The state of Temples in India : we know our temples are slowly losing importance in life of new generations. When did you last time visited a temple - did you made a small donation. When did you made a plan with some of your friends to visit a temple. Yes we need to do this. \n\nOur temples are now not as rich as before they cannot feed all the hungry and underprivileged people today - in some states temples are under strict supervision and control - but can government stop you from feeding poor and hungry on the name of your dharma.. NO! Get some friends - make small fund - starts feeding poor near your house or temple - yeah call it "prasadam" - tell them it\'s the temple and god feeding them. Feed one.. two.. hundred ..do as much as you can. Give up selfish interest and do it on the behalf of temples.\n\nRemember the need of a poor and hungry is - food - not dharma. If we don\'t do this as individuals - some other religion will try to feed and capture their soul.\n\n3.Start learning regional languages : people will try to divide us on basis of languages . So if you are hindi speaker - starts learning languages close to hindi - try Gujarati ,Rajasthani ,Punjabi. Make sanskrit words part of you vocabulary.\n\nIf we live in north of India - try to at least learn a language from south - kannada , tamil, malayalam, Telugu. And if you are from south - try learning bengali , hindi, Gujarati ..anyone that you like.The best way to destroy this division - is to prove to the world that north indian can speak a south indian language fluently and vice a versa..  learn some songs in new regional languages..learn some basics of different languages of india... The key to a civilization is its languages.\n\n4.Celebrate the festivals (Find time in your busy scheduled for this) : So if it\'s Krishna Janmastami - don\'t just do puja at home - get some friends - organize some games - destroy some danhi handi --&gt; tell friends on instagram and whatsapp - how much fun you had. What about a Makhaan Heist - kid will have some much fun isn\'t it. A deep curiosity build up in childrens\' mind. A night out on Shiva Ratri - may be. We need to create some new way to celebrate - which appeals to young generation but keeping the core based on ancient traditions.\n\nWhat I see know a days - we are moving away from celebrating festivals as a SOCIETY - we are becoming more self centered even in times of celebration.\n\nNamaskar!'<br />Author: 'sharma_pratik'<br />id: 'gpmth8'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li></ol>
