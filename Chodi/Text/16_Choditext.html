And yet, the same Europeans often praise the Indian soldiers for their bravery. Our British masters have conquered Kabul on the strength of these weak Indian fighters and have put them to use in winning over India itself.

Whatever toughness and bravery the Indians may have today, no doubt, is less than what they had in the past. Many years of subjugation have blunted their power.

<li>Title: 'White people aren‚Äôt Aryans: Puranic explanation of what happened after the collapse of the IVC'<br />Body: 'I‚Äôm reposting the following after rewriting it and making it more clear. I‚Äôd earlier posted it on Indiaspeaks but it didn‚Äôt generate much interest. I hope it helps you guys handle white supremacists who claim they gave us (a bunch of uncivilised tribals) the Vedas. \n\nA reddit post in a edgy left wing Indian sub (You can find it by searching for Pargiter), got me interested in Ancient Indian History. And when I read it, a lot of puzzles fell in place. His work not only explains how we got the Steppe a.k.a Aryan gene. But also beautifully explains the ‚Äòout of india‚Äô theory and is in line with many Indian Historians who have rejected Aryan Invasion theory too.\n\nThe author says that in India post the IVC collapse there were the non-aryan kings and non-aryan Brahmins (Like Agastya and Kashyapa). The most important of these were the Ishkvaku/Suryavamsha Kshatriyas, located in Ayodhya, the family to which Ram belonged to.\nhttps://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.279548/page/n313/mode/2up?q=non-aryan\n\nHe says the steppe gene/aryan gene was spread across the country by another tribe, the ones who we refer to as the aila/chandravamshi lineage Kshatriyas. Krishna and the Pauravas belong to this tribe. These people did not have a separate Brahmin class initially. But they developed one later.\n\nI believe the Aila/Aryan/lunar race were descendants of a pre-aryan race ( like the Ishkvakus ) who were already very steppe enriched. (whether this was due to mixing with steppe males/females I do not know).  This also explains why the Jats even today have the highest steppe component in the country. The Kuru kingdom, a chandravamshi kingdom was located in present day Haryana/Punjab. Perhaps the Jats being farmers stayed put in the north west preserving their genetics, while the other castes through admixture with their corresponding non aryan communities diluted their steppe genes. (Kshatriyas formed alliances through marriage, Brahmins travelled to spread their Vedic knowledge and Vaishyas travelled for business).\n\nHe says the non-aryan Brahmins who composed the early vedas also seeked the patronage of the Aila/lunar kings who had conquered most of India except the eastern UP, Bihar region. When they moved west from East they recorded the rivers in that order, this is in line with the arguments most Indian historians use to discard Ayan invasion by saying the rig Veda mentions rivers in the east first and then west.\n\nThe unique thing about Chandravamshi Kshatriyas was that many of their Kshatriyas became Kshatriya Brahmins and some even renounced Kshatriyahood to become Brahmins (The most famous of these being Vishwamitra). This was surprisingly a smooth transition and only occasionally was it opposed by the Brahmins when they differed in ideologies (Vasishta and Vishwamitra had a fall out because of this).  But this improved the status of Brahmins in general. The mixing of the lunar race Kshatriyas with the non aryan Brahmins led to the steppe enrichment of Brahmins. \n\nThe solar and lunar tribes often fought each other and this killed off many Kshatriyas. The first solar king to stop the Haihya aryans was Ram and the last was Sagara,  the Brahmins who later wrote these wars down recorded it as Parashurama killing Kshatriyas 21 times.\nhttps://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.279548/page/n275/mode/2up?q=Twenty+one\n\nThe non-aryan suryavamshis and the aryan chandravamshis probably spoke different Indo-European languages.  The lunar race spoke an inner indo European language (Sanskrit) while the Suryavamshis probably spoke an outer Indo European language (Like Pali), the conquests of the lunar race led to sanskritisatiion of the outer indoeuropean languages like it did for the Dravidian languages.\nNote: Outer Indo European languages are  those which are supposed to have predated Sanskrit in India\nhttps://www.brownpundits.com/2021/03/01/the-fair-skinned-sintashta-folks-did-not-spread-indo-aryan-languages-in-india/ \n\nThis also explains why Marathi is the closest modern Indian language we have to Sanskrit. According to Pargiter the lunar hahihyas launched raids from Southern Malwa (Present day Maharastra) across India and on the ishkvakus  much like the Marathas many centuries later.\n\nEventually the lunar dynasty dominated and invaded most of India, they led to sanskritisation of India. Their steppe enriched Brahmins and Kshatriyas would have mixed with the Brahmins and Kshatriyas of other regions leading to the steppe enrichment of these communities across India. This also explains why the term ‚ÄòArya‚Äô came to mean ‚Äònoble‚Äô. It was because the Aila tribe quickly expanded and became the noble/elite class. \n\nAfter aryanization of India, a group of Aryans moved out of India to give rise to the Iranians and took some Indic traditions along with them.\nhttps://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.279548/page/n307/mode/2up?q=Iranian\n\nAccording to the Bhagvad Gita and Matsya Purana Shraddhadeva was the king of the Dravida Desa. And he is the progenitor of both Aila and Ishkvaku. Technically both solar and lunar lines are dravidian in origin. (Perhaps they diverged branched off from the Dravidian IVC tribe when migrating into the subcontinent after the collapse of the IVC civilisation.\n\nNote: Pargiter leans heavily towards the Puranas and Mahabharata because he feels the Vedas and Ramayana were exaggerated and embellished by Brahman Rishis who had a bad sense of history and current affairs because they were isolated from civilisation. He says that Kshatriyas had a stronger necessity to accurately record their lineages and their accomplishments in the Puranas. Because for a Kshatriya material conquests and blood lineages where everything. According to him Brahminical records are not accurate historically and only to be used for philosophy.  \n\nThis may upset some of the Brahmins who are reading this, but I urge you to read the first few pages of his book, to understand his logic.'<br />Author: 'devarajurs'<br />id: 'm215lh'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>

<li>Title: 'IMPORTANT: Why Jati/Varna is not a part of Sanatana Dharma'<br />Body: 'Hindonts, even right wingers, have for several millennia believed that varna was always a part of Sanatana Dharma. I am here to tell you all that it never was (nope, not even a little bit).  The modern day Hindontism has almost nothing to do with what our ancestors actually practiced.  We always say that the Vedas are the real heart of Sanatana Dharma, but we do not even know what is in them let alone practice what is in them.  \n\nThe varnas are only mentioned once in the entirety of the four Vedas (in the Purusha Suktam), yes, JUST ONCE.  If we look deeper, we realize that even this one mention of varna was put in much later.  These are some quotes I found (yes, most are rice bags but this just solidifies my argument since they have everything to gain by us being divided).\n\n*V. Nagarajan believes that it was an "interpolation" to give "divine sanction" to an unequal division in society that was in existence at the time of its composition. He states "The Vedic Hymns had been composed before the Varna scheme was implemented. The Vedic society was not organized on the basis of varnas. The Purush Sukta might have been a later interpolation to secure Vedic sanction for that scheme".* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*As compared with by far the largest part of the hymns of the Rigveda, the Purusha Sukta has every character of modernness both in its diction and ideas. I have already observed that the hymns which we find in this collection (Purusha Sukta) are of very different periods.*\n\n‚Äî\u2009[John Muir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Muir_(indologist))\n\n \n\n*That the Purusha Sukta, considered as a hymn of the Rigveda, is among the latest portions of that collection, is clearly perceptible from its contents.*\n\n‚Äî\u2009[Albrecht Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_Weber) \n\n \n\n*That remarkable hymn (the Purusha Sukta) is in language, metre, and style, very different from the rest of the prayers with which it is associated. It has a decidedly more modern tone, and must have been composed after the Sanskrit language had been refined.*\n\n‚Äî\u2009[Henry Thomas Colebrooke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Thomas_Colebrooke) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, the true, unadulterated Vedas do not even mention the varna system nor does it mention the four varnas AT ALL.  Our pUrvajAs called themselves AryAs and that is what we should call ourselves as well.  There never was any Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, or Dalits.  This might shatter your world-view but that is because we have been living a lie for several millennia.\n\nNow, let us look at the Manusmrti, or at least the version we have with us today, which is rife with hatred toward "lower castes" (don\'t try to deny this, read the text).  Knowing that the Vedas do not even mention the varnas, why is that a main theme in the Manusmrti and later texts?  Looking at things logically, Vaivasvata Manu (Manu which literally means Man), was the king of Dravida.  After the flood wiped out humanity and he was the only one saved, he reproduced with Shraddha and propagated humanity for this Manvantara.  \n\nModern day Hindontism believes that all Brahmanas are descendants of the Sapta Rshi and everyone else (all the other varnas) are descendants of Manu.  Why would Manu, the King of Dravida and the progenitor of the "lower castes", denigrate his sons and descendants so badly?  Where is the logic in this?  There is no logic and there is certainly not any truth.  All of our texts whether it is the Mahabharata (including the Gita), Vedas, etc have been tampered with extensively.\n\nYou might ask what scumbags would do this and how would they benefit.  The answer is that some treacherous priests wanted to solidify their "superiority" and ensure the same for their children and future descendants.  These traitors went as far as altering our Holy texts (even the Vedas) to further their agenda.  The consequences of that was not just the immense suffering of fellow Aryas who were deemed to be inferior, but the subjugation of our civilization by the desert cults.\n\nOnly Kshatriyas and to some degree Brahmanas were allowed to pick up weapons against the peaceful hordes.  Combined, they make up around 15% of all Aryas.  Varnas also splintered further into Jatis/clans.  All of whom despised one another and could not see that they were all Aryas.  When Cchatrapathi Shivaji Maharaja forcefully unified believers, he allowed all believing men to serve in his military regardless of this made-up concept called varna/jati.  He started the reconquest of AryAvarta and brought us back from the brink of extinction. What was his reward by filthy, treacherous, castist priests for his undying devotion to the Devas?  They would not coronate him as Chhatrapati since his ancestors were Shudras (again, a made-up concept).  These filthy traitors would rather be masters among slaves than be their own masters, free of peaceful rule. They were the ultimate cucks and bootlickers.\n\nI write this because varna and jati have brought our civilization to its knees. It is a poison and we gain nothing by bowing down to it.  It is why we have dozens if not hundreds of political parties.  It is why despite centuries of fighting amongst ourselves and letting peacefuls and rice bags screw our women and destroy our temples for centuries, we have let a leftist party rule us for six decades and why Tamilnadu and other states will never be ruled by BJP despite being majority Hindont.  \n\nKnow one thing. Despite leftist scumbags pretending to be against this evil and false concept of jati, they ABSOLUTELY F\'ING LOVE IT. I remember watching a news show with that filthy Burqa Butt where a VirAt Arya was talking about uniting all believers regardless of their jati.  That filthbag Butt lost it and kept attacking him for wanting to rid caste discrimination.  This is because jati is their biggest weapon, and it isn\'t even a weapon they have to wield.  Hindont society wields it for them.\n\nVarna is the biggest enemy of AryAvarta.

Since, I wasn't able to find work on sites like LinkedIn, Facebook etc. I had to put my hopes on reddit. \n\nI have an overall experience of 2 years, I have worked for clients in the past as a freelancer. I have designed social media posts, ebooks, blog images, informative videos, etc.\n\nI am a self-starter. I run my own hobby blog on anime and popular culture too. I make all the memes and graphics for itself. Last year I got over 50K views on the blog. I hope to prove myself to be a valuable asset with my present skill set. Looking for a chance to prove myself. \n\nIf anyone has any openings please let me know. I can email my portfolio with some of my works. Thank you so much!\n\nAlso, since its a meme subreddit, I'm not too sure if I should post this here. I apologize if its breaking any rules!"<br />Author: 'ShakeDash1'<br />id: 'm1j7j9'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

They had an interview with a cricket journalist Gedion heigh who is a senior cricket journalist in Australia. He also has a cricket show called cricket etc.\nFew days ago he invited Ramchandra guha on cricket etc show. And I was like wtf what this piece of crap is doing there. And Guha as usual brainwashed this Gedion heigh guy big time about Modi that how he is taking over institutions in India and how cricket is being politicised in India. And now this Gedion heigh guy is spreading his knowledge given by Guha all over Australia. But every Indian knows that cricket has always been controlled by politicians whoever is in power. When congress was in power they were in control and now BJP. There is nothing new in that.\nBut these scums like Guha spread their lies all over the world and influence people. I know a lot these foreign opinion does not matter. But still we need to win this narrative war. These leftards has strong institutional hold outside of India and BJP is not going to do anything about that. We need knowledgefull people who can break this vicious cycle.'<br />Author: 'thelizardking_19453'<br />id: 'm1bmd0'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Working on animation for cultures of India and tool'<br />Body: 'Hello friends,\n\nWe are planning to create animation videos on small distant subcultures of India. By sheer luck, we come in contact with Mr. Ahmad Balti and his daughter Sherine Balti who also waned to promote their culture (which generally gets overshadowed with Ladakhi culture). I will divide this post in 2 parts: first about the video and seconds about the tool used for this video.\n\n**Part 1**:\n\nDo you know Balti people of India got freedom from Pakistani invaders in 1971 and are fearlessly patriotic. I have made a small video (target audience 10-15 yrs) based on pictures and  videos available:\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/man-of-panda3d/Balti\\_video\\_memeer/blob/main/Balti%20-%20India.mp4](https://github.com/man-of-panda3d/Balti_video_memeer/blob/main/Balti%20-%20India.mp4)\n\nYoutube: [https://youtu.be/ELx9iHNEqtQ](https://youtu.be/ELx9iHNEqtQ)\n\nThe story of the video is at [https://github.com/man-of-panda3d/Balti\\_video\\_memeer/blob/main/stories/gilgit\\_video.txt](https://github.com/man-of-panda3d/Balti_video_memeer/blob/main/stories/gilgit_video.txt) \n\nIf you want to help, would like to extent this story, addon any extra model/ action - we (me personally and our Balti countrymen too) will be grateful.\n\n**Part 2**:\n\nThis video is made from MeMeer ([https://github.com/man-of-panda3d/memeer](https://github.com/man-of-panda3d/memeer)). The reason for this tool (python3, panda3d, ffmpeg) creation was:\n\n1. We wanted to make videos of places and people which are geographically distant and otherwise costly (T&amp;M wise) to visit.\n2. We also wanted  to make videos in house (as in not uploading videos/ pics to other sites as most probably content will not be owned by us), free from all royalty/ watermarks, with unlimited iterations with options for motion graphics, 3d/2d animation, subtitles, picture and video elements available in public domain or allowed to use\n3. Story is the code: Keep the story in simple English (the person of the regions can change the video and do modification by himself as much as possible)\n4. Advanced users (as some of you are very well) can create models and animations (in blender for example and converted to panda3d) and use them liberally in the video, frame by frame, and pixel by pixel\n5. For simple educational videos, motion graphics are a great way and have been shown for ice drafting in above video\n6. Support for audio has not been included as yet, though it is expected to be simple change.\n\nHonestly, there is a lot still needs to be done, but with everything in life, this tool takes a backseat. \n\nDo you think something like this will help you? Would you like to use it? Do you have any plans for making such videos on various cultures? \n\nThanks in advance for your comments :)'<br />Author: 'assholistic'<br />id: 'lxfqac'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>

Those 2 things need to work together to ensure a decent living. What do you guys think of this idea?'<br />Body: "Today one could be employed with a pay of 30000 rupee/ month. But if the cost of goods are high then even a person with a job and such salary  is still under poverty. The problem becomes do you bring in more competition or efficiency to reduce the price of goods. Both have their ups and down. With increased competition comes lower prices and jobs. But at the same time the risk of failure and exploitation is high as companies fight to survive. But with increased efficiency there is Job loss as more things get automated or standardized at the hands of lower goods prices. Also the idea of businesses having to bring in stellar growth in profit needs to stop. 1-2% profit is okay. The higher the profit that means the lower the labour cost and other cost that may indirectly generate more jobs. May it be in production, transportation etc. Today not just India but the entire faces a conondrum where inflation is skyrocketing.

<li>Title: 'Book Review: Gunahon ka Devta by Dharmveer Bharti'<br />Body: "\n\nTo all the readers who swoon over the love of Hazel-Gus, Liz-Darcy, Heathcliff and Cathy, believe me you have experienced nothing if you haven't read about Chander and Sudha. We Indians have a really bad habit of cribbing how great Western culture is and how we lack. But, we seldom are aware of the gems collecting dust in the mildewed attic of our forgetfulness.\n\nHere are\xa0 points why you should read Gunahon ka Devta:\n\n1. The protagonist: Western books often present a brooding bad boy who is transformed by the love of his life. Here, our protagonist is a serious young man having lofty ideals. Frankly, his goodness and pure character at the beginning of the book was so refreshing. The corruption of his character from being a pure, innocent Devta to a Pret, Gunahon ka Devta is something that will create a heaviness in your heart. Chander's negative character arc is tragically beautiful.\n\n2. Love story between Chander and Sudha: There's no love at first sight here. Instead there's the love the creeps on your soul and you don't even realize how every fibre of you has become entwined with that love. Though many people complain that the love between them is patriarchal, I beg to differ. Yes, Sudha worships Chander as Devta but not because he's a man, but due to the loftiness of his character. Yes, Chander dictates Sudha where to go, but it is only because Chander is older than her and more mature and acts like a guardian to Sudha. There are also discussions on how caste system is the cause of separation between the lovers, but if you have an understanding of Indian society, Chander considered Sudha's father as his parent and hence, could not break his trust by keeping a conjugal relationship with Sudha. Also, his relationship with Sudha had fraternal undertones and he couldn't bear the thought of mixing sex with their pure relationship.\n\n3. Haunting secondary characters: Be it Anglo Indian Pammi and her brother Bertie, Binati, Buaji, Bisariya, Dr. Shukla, each character has its own nuances and depth and\xa0character arcs which haunt the reader days after he has finished the novel.\n\n4. Exquisite imagery: Did I mention how exquisitely Bharti Ji painted the setting and the imagery is so vivid that you feel you yourself are there with the characters. Especially the scene at Lake with Chander and Pammi.\n\nOverall, this novel is a masterpiece and everyone should read it once in a lifetime.\n\n\nHave you read the book?

Despite he himself admitting to have written \'Centuries\', his famous book on predictions, in a state of trance, people down the ages continue to be amazed at the accuracy of his predictions, based on events that turned out to be true...**.**\xa0   \nWhat\'s of particular great interest to us Indians is India having the destiny of growing into a force to be reckoned with, when it comes to world events... let\'s check out the passages from Centuries that hint at the progress of India, in particular, of its home-grown religion, Hinduism...  \nSkeptics should note that over 800 of his forecasts have been fulfilled in the last 400 years, among which was the prediction (Century X, quatrain 42) that the British empire would collapse in 1942. Indeed, the Quit India movement gave a mighty setback to the till-then invincible British imperialist forces. This is especially mind-boggling when you consider the fact that there was no Britain, what to talk of British empire, in 1555, the year when Nostradamus made his predictions. Britain was formed in 1603 and the battle of Plassey was fought in 1757 (heralding British rule in India).  \nBefore I continue, let me share a case to show that while we feel thrilled at getting a peek into the future, yet when we modify it to suit our whims and fancies, in other words, when the prophecies become self-serving, how disastrous they can be! For example, Hitler twisted Nostradamus for propaganda purposes. He brought out a false "Centuries" to predict the unending glory of Nazi Germany. Contrarily, however, Nostradamus had predicted the annihilation of Nazis for mass-murder of Jews. (Quatrain 77, Century VIII).\n\nNow, let\'s check out predictions which have been interpreted as having significance for India...'<br />Author: 'SHIVANSH_RTX'<br />id: 'lwbhnk'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm üïâÔ∏è</li>

Double taxation of Hindus.  Hindus pay tax on income, and after that they donate money to temples.  When the government taxes temples, that is effectively double taxation.\n9. Slowly move from taxation to looting.  Equate the current indian government with the mughal and british invaders who robbed indian temples.\n10. Every incident of attack on temple/hindu temple should be highlighted as government is happy to take away the money from the temples but is unwilling to provide the protection for the same.\n11.

Talk about liability for repayment extending to all MLAs/MPs (past, present and future), and their family.  Cash, gold and land.\n13.

<li>Title: 'Idol Thief Subhash Chandra Kapoor declared by the US as one of the most prolific commodities smugglers in the world. His NY warehouse had more than $100 million worth of stolen Indian art! The pair of Nataraja and Sivakami (900 yrs) fetched him $ 8.5 million, the idols belonged to the Chola Era'<br />Body: "**Background:**\n\nThe Udayarpalayam taluk of the Ariyalur District, in Tamil Nadu, India has nearly 463 ancient temples, of which 200 belong to the Chola period dated 9th to 10th century AD. Most of these temples haven't seen maintenance for many decades and have lax security. Local thieves used to target the idols for their metal content, usually melting them. Some idols are pure gold, silver and panchaloha ‚Äî five precious metals. However, the entry of international smuggling cartels has changed the situation. With antique Chola art being worth millions in the international market, idol thieves were recruited to lift them from the temples. In 2008, one such gang allegedly recruited by New York-based art dealer Subhash Kapoor was responsible for stealing eight idols from the Brihadeeswarar temple at Sripuranthan, 18 idols from the Varadharaja Perumal temple, and in 2010, 6 panchaloha idols from Chozeeshwarar temple at Vikiramangalam.\n\nAnd when the US authorities subsequently raided Kapoor's warehouses in New York more skeletons came tumbling out of his closet. They recovered no less than $100 million worth of stolen Indian art! This was just Kapoor's inventory - he had been in business for close to four decades and the true scale of his loot is incalculable. The US declared Kapoor one of the most prolific commodities smugglers in the world.\n\n[ Idol Chase](https://preview.redd.it/saallmlkq9j61.png?width=785&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c54fa54eafb5f519d21291304f61da8f01751638)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ State of one our Temples in Tamil Nadu, 800-year-old Sundareswara Temple in Suthamalli](https://preview.redd.it/cuqpjbdsq9j61.png?width=650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfac9fe0947aceef298861ee01c110cc4f646169)\n\n \n\n**Idols Returned from Museums across the World**\n\n* **Australia**\n\nThe Sripuranthan Natarajan Idol, is a 900-year-old statue of Natarajan ‚Äî the dancing Shiva ‚Äî that was stolen from the ancient Brihadeeswarar temple of Sripuranthan, smuggled to the United States, and then sold to the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra with a false provenance, for US$5.1 million. In March 2014, Ron Radford, the director of the National Gallery of Australia, removed the idol from display. In September 2014, the Australian government returned the Natarajan idol to India, along with another stolen antique idol of Shiva as Ardhanarishvarar which was displayed at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. The two were handed over by the then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 5 September 2014, at New Delhi\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ This 900-year-old bronze statue of Dancing Shiva, shown on display at the National Gallery of Australia, was stolen from a temple in Tamil Nadu , $5 million.](https://preview.redd.it/o4yc6yrxq9j61.jpg?width=650&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cda8f53700f2c2553bf142a87044db7ea8e1f86f)\n\n \n\n[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Stolen-Nataraja-Ardhanariswara-idols-return-to-the-land-of-temples/articleshow/42282580.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Stolen-Nataraja-Ardhanariswara-idols-return-to-the-land-of-temples/articleshow/42282580.cms)\n\n* **Germany**\n\nThe Linden Museum in Germany returned to the Indian government a 9th-century AD idol of Mahishasumardini, stolen from Pulwama district in Jammu and Kashmir in the 1990s, which had been acquired from Kapoor.\n\n* **USA**\n\nThe Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio returned four artifacts acquired from Kapoor, including the Vinayagar statue stolen from Sripuranthan. The other antiques are a stone idol of Varaha Rescuing the Earth (acquired 2001), Mughal origin 18th-century enamel with gold box (acquired 2008), and a watercolour Rasikapriya from the Samdehi Ragini (acquired 2010).\n\nIn November 2015, the United States returned a chola period bronze of Shivan and Parvathi, which was sold to the David Owsley Museum of Art at the Ball State University in 2005 by Subhash Kapoor. Here also, the sculpture was sold with a false provenance which placed it back to an American collection of Leo Figie, dated to 1969. The idol was recovered by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement‚Äôs (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).\n\nIn June 2016, the United States returned **nearly 200 antiques to the Indian Government, in the presence of the visiting Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi at Washington DC.** Among the antiques returned were the Chola period (850 AD to 1250 AD) bronze of the Tamil Shaivite poet Manikkavacakar stolen from the Sivan Temple in Madras and the 1000 year old Sripuranthan Vinayagar which was displayed at the Toledo Museum of Art.\n\n* **Singapore**\n\nIn March 2016, the Natarajan idol was re-united with its consort Uma Parmeshwari, at the ASI Icon Centre, Kumbakonam, after nearly 8 years. The Singapore Civilisation Museum had finally returned the Uma Parmeshwari after long negotiations with the Indian Government.\n\nOverall four of the eight statues stolen from Sripuranthan were traced, with three to the United States and one to Singapore.\n\n**Work on getting the Gods Stolen was not Easy**\n\nHowever, the **National Gallery of Australia, continued to deny that the artwork was stolen, refused to return it, and continued to display it in the gallery, without any note of its doubtful provenance.** This stand was criticised by the Australian media, with Duncan Chappell, criminology expert from University of Sydney, calling it in-appropriate and an international embarrassment. **The Government of India formally requested the artwork to be returned, under the UNESCO** **convention on stolen antiquities**\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n**How did he Succeed for so long without getting caught**\n\n**Subhash Chandra Kapoor** main man who made him from selling terracotta to idols where big money is Sanjeevi Asokan an art dealer based out of Chennai.\n\nThe plan involved identifying villages in and around TN, look for temples which remained closed or neglected for years. The Cholas love for bronze idols were immense even small temples in remote villages has great idols.\n\nSubash Kapoor used 3 main books where he sourced which temples to rob and which temples had what idols, the books were,\n\n* The Chola Temples, S.R Balasubrahmanyam\n* Early Chola Bronzes, Douglas Barrett\n* Bronzes of South India - P.R Srinivasan\n\n**Problem :**\n\n1. Neglect some temples have been closed for years, rituals happen once a few years\n2. No Photographic evidence of what idols are in what temples\n3. No of idols in each temples is not documented\n4. ASI was sleeping along\n5. Diplomats and moles who sold their soles to sell our gods\n6. Worst was the robbery was not detected even after years after it was robbed and the Statues had already been sold museums and were displayed in the Galleries\n\n**Who is Vijay Kumar**\n\nAuthor Vijay Kumar was one of the prominent person who studied and exposed the idol trade business of Subash Kapoor. He has exposed the relationship between Subhash Kapoor and Sanjeevi Ashokan which goes beyond thee bronzes, the loopholes and contacts in the entire system helps them route the idols from Indian shores across the word without being caught. But despite many corrupt officials the Indian bureaucracy also has some good honest officers on its payroll.\xa0 Being art enthusiast used his study and source along with the enthusiastic group (An officer from US Immigration and customs who encountered an abandoned shipment earlier) did a magnificent job of identifying the stolen Bronzes, across museums in the world, and establishing the proof which eased the efforts of the Police. The author and his team studied various pictures from Museums and collated the data with historical information about the location of the idols and iconography in various Temples to prove the thefts.\n\nHis two pertinent questions for us:\n\n* To the top Museums of the world, what‚Äôs the point of curating and documenting systematically when the Murtis are basically stolen from Ancient Temples of India that has survived invasions over 800 plus years? Quite shameless.\n* Specifically to all my fellow Indians, what exactly are you proud of as a Hindu/Indian? If not for our Temple structures, exquisite sculptures, what then? A reader can get a clear picture on the global network and their greed towards our precious and how apathy from our side to even have a photograph makes it difficult to establish evidence. Even though it is a Pan-India problem, I assume it is more in Tamil Nadu.\n\nInspiration\n\nThe Idol Thief - Book by S.

Every Islam country has a strict fascist  regime. The freedom people (especially women) hold in countries like Iran is just complete fucking 0.\n* The middle east has been in a constant war be it a civil war, or a war with Jihadi Terrorists or with Nations such as Russia and the US\n* Imagine if a country like India had a \\~30% muslim population and shares a border with Iran, we would have attracted more Islamic Terrorists to provoke violence here.\n\nJust wanted to share something with you guys.
