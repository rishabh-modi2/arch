Kashmir lost a lot of demographic to &Icirc;sl&agrave;m, Bengal did too, Kashmir had an &Iacute;sl&agrave;m&iacute;c state next to it, Bengal did too, Kashmiri elite Hindus failed to realise the threat, Bengali elite Hindus did too, religious and political murders ramped up over the years in Kashmir, happening in Bengal too, media, the motherf&uacute;ck&eacute;r media watched on as more and more grusom m&uacute;rd&eacute;rs came about in Kashmir, media silent on Bengal m&uacute;rd&eacute;rs too. At least this time there was an effort made to rescue these suicidal H&iacute;ndus but with the results in Bengal I am forced to think that Kashmiri Hindus couldn't be saved because they wouldn't have aligned with any nationalist force which hypothetically would have arrived in Kashmir. That's the signature move of Hindu elite, getting k&icirc;lled and to sideline any Hindu muscle group. Nonetheless, I remind you all that Bengal is your and my land as well and protecting it falls on us too. Let's do what we can to contain this vampire Momota and her zombies. Because with Bengal north east will be doomed and Bihar, Orissa etc will be next on the list."<br />Author: 'copper_wire_1mm'<br />id: 'n32mdj' &nbsp;num_comments: 21 &nbsp;score: 1</li>

<li>Title: 'My layman analysis of explaining Bengal results'<br />Body: '**Existing infrastructure of organized crime - using FEAR and INTIMIDATION through Violence:** \n\nThis cycle of organized extra-judicial gundagiri was started back in 1960s by the communists. Whoever came to power after that continued to use this medium of &nbsp;power consolidation. In fact, political murders were and still are a common thing there. \n\nThis system over the decades has matured really well. And not all Bengalis dared to go against Momler Didi. \n\nWe saw how BJP workers were murdered, JP Nadda was attacked, Even Home minister Amit Shah was not spared, Tejasvi Surya\'s rally got attacked. This continued even during elections where voters were openly intimidated, and BJP workers were killed. \n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**BJPs campaign was not localized to Bengali preferences**\n\nTo appeal Bengali Hindus BJP should\'ve gone for "Joi Maa Durga" instead of "Jai Sri Ram". I as a south Indian took a while to connect to "Jai Sri Ram", in fact it took me a few years. \n\nAlso local BJP leaders should\'ve been given the center stage. I feel presence of outsiders, although powerful people like Modi and Amit Shah overshadowed local BJP leaders. \n\nBengali identity is very strong. And this is the area BJP needs to change it\'s strategy. This issue is there in all south Indian states except Karnataka\n\nAnd because of this language identity, a Bengali Hindu and Bengali/Bangladeshi muslim is more likely to vote as a block to the party that\'s local and closer to people. \n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Positives**\n\nAlthough the polls were hyped by pro-BJP news, which all news do. The results are still good in that BJP is losing seats by a very close margin of a few thousand votes. BJP has made significant inroads in the Bengali politics. And it is a longer game. The seats gained are also significant. \n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Negative**\n\nBiggest negative is that demography is destiny. Probably BJP should\'ve done this five years ago. Feels like it\'s too late and we might see Bengal turn into Kashmir and there would be no surprises if Hindus are slaughtered with impunity and silently with ZERO media coverage. \n\nI\'m afraid what will now happen to BJP cadre in Bengal.

<li>Title: 'COVID: MISSING FACTS, MISDIRECTED DISCOURSE'<br />Body: "\\*\\*Stolen\\*\\*\n\nONE-FIFTH of Indian districts have not reported any Covid 19 cases for the last seven days. We seem to have flattened the Covid curve,&rdquo; declared Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan two months back, on February 15. By then the daily infections that had peaked to 90,000 cases last year, were down to less than 9,000. But things changed dramatically into an unprecedented disaster in April (see table). The grim situation called for a huge national resolve to deal with the crisis. But the unfortunate deaths caused by the shortage of oxygen in Delhi made the ecosystem so emotionally surcharged that all facts and reasoning became irrelevant. The missing facts misdirected the public discourse, distorted the narrative on Covid and damaged the national will to face the challenge. Look at what crucial facts were missed. \n\n***Profiteers&rsquo; complaint*** \n\nThe oxygen shortage-induced deaths first occurred in Delhi&rsquo;s corporate hospitals. These hospitals made huge profits, even more last year, thanks to the pandemic. That provoked the National Herald site to write an article titled Profit in times of COVID-19: Is it time to take over private hospitals? (20.6.2020). The report said &ldquo;Rs 25,090, Rs 53,090, Rs 775,590, Rs 5,00,000, Rs 6,00,000, Rs 12,00,000 &mdash; these are not random numbers. These are the per day costs and cumulative two-week costs for a bed in private hospitals in Delhi if one gets Coronavirus.&rdquo; Adding the cost of the personal protection equipment (PPE), tests and medicines, the bill equalled Indians&rsquo; annual income, it said. Home treatment fee was no less; it varied from Rs 5,700 to Rs 21,900 a day plus cost of tests. The Herald report cited a writ against this loot in the Supreme Court. \n\nAlarmed by the writ, the Association of Healthcare Providers (AHPs) and FICCI members agreed to self regulate. What were the self regulated fees? AHP&rsquo;s daily fee for general wards was Rs 15,000 plus Rs 5,000 for oxygen; for ICU Rs 25,000 plus Rs 10,000 for ventilators. The FICCI&rsquo;s rates were even higher - Rs 17,000 to Rs 45,000 per day. And more. Hospitals bought PPEs at Rs 375-500 apiece and sold them to patients at 10-12 times more. Chennai and Mumbai were no exceptions, said the Herald. \n\nIt is these hospitals that now filed writs under the constitutional right to life, for oxygen supply by governments &mdash; for which they charge the patients Rs 5,000 per day! Anyone heard of these horrendous facts of the loot in the uproarious debate on oxygen shortage causing deaths? This is important because the profiteering hospitals could have set up their own oxygen plants at minuscule cost. Read on. \n\n***O2 privatised, unregulated*** \n\nThe production, trade, stocking and use of oxygen is privatised. The trade in medical oxygen is not controlled or regulated in India &mdash; though its prices are controlled by the National Pharma Pricing Authority (NPPA)an autonomous body under the chemicals and fertilisers ministry. Producers enter into private contracts with industries, hospitals and also governments to supply oxygen. \n\nHospitals plan how much oxygen is needed for an emergency, estimate the lead time for delivery and order accordingly. Their supply chains were long both in distance and time, particularly for Delhi hospitals, which are thousands of kilometers away from their production sources spread across several states. Supplies have to be trucked in from industrial zones in eastern India. This needed meticulous advance planning to ensure timely deliveries even during normalcy. But hospitals did not plan stocks for contingent needs and saved on costs. Did anyone hear any of these facts in the noise of the last 10 days? \n\n***No shortage*** \n\nSecond, there is no shortage of oxygen. We produce 1,00,000 tonnes a day, with one company in Gujarat alone producing a fifth of it. Of the total produced, only a minuscule part, some 1%, is medical oxygen. Even in the Covid crisis, it may not top 5-6%. The production of oxygen, mostly captively used, is concentrated in far off areas. Oxygen in liquid form is traded and transported through heavy, safe tankers, each of which costs Rs 45 lakh. Worse still, oxygen worth Rs 300 is stored in a cylinder that costs Rs 10,000! The distant production and multiple trade chains in oxygen, transport in tankers and stocking in cylinders created huge logistic issues even in normal times. In times of pandemic, this supply chain wouldn&rsquo;t withstand stress, particularly when Delhi, where the deaths occurred, is several hundred kms away from where the oxygen has to be transported. \n\n***Profiteers failed, but shifted the blame*** \n\nAfter the Covid first wave last year, each (Delhi) hospital should have set up their on-thespot oxygen producing unit. A report by The Print says that a 240-bed hospital with 40 ICU beds uses oxygen worth about Rs 5 lakh per month in normal times. It costs some Rs 50 lakh to set up a Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen plant, which they could recover within 18 months. Every Delhi hospital could afford it. But none was ready to allocate the precious space to house an oxygen plant. They opted to buy oxygen from a thousand kilometres away instead and not make it in their backyard. The supply chain risks of oxygen were brought out last year by Cherish Paul, John Paul and Akhil Babu of the Department of Anaesthesia and Critical Care, Jubilee Mission Medical College and Research Institute, Thrissur, Kerala. \n\nIn an article in the Indian Journal of Respiratory Care titled &ldquo;Hospital oxygen supply: A survey of disaster preparedness of Indian hospitals,&rdquo; the three experts concluded that most of the hospitals rely on a single pipeline from a single location, inviting mishaps during disasters. They recommended multiple sources of oxygen depending on the size and the hospital&rsquo;s proximity to a liquid oxygen plant. Apply this caution to the Delhi hospitals. They could themselves produce oxygen but did not. They never planned for an uninterrupted supply of oxygen during a disaster. When their supply lines for oxygen on which they profiteer failed, they cited the constitutional right to life and asked the court to direct governments to give oxygen! The off-hand and emotional response of the court actually helped to shift the blame on to governments. That changed the very discourse and narrative on Covid. Did the public have any hint of these critical facts in the last few days? \n\n***Hospitals thwarted 129 on-spot oxygen plants*** \n\nThe current stentorian discourse sans facts, which shifts the blame on to the government for the supply chain failures of hospitals, misses a more critical fact. Anticipating a contingency like this, the Modi government had ordered 162 PSA plants at a cost of over Rs 200 crore in October last for government hospitals all over India. This could have produced 80,500 litres of medical oxygen per minute. This translates approximately to one ton of liquid oxygen per day per plant. But out of plants ordered for 162 hospitals, only 33 got installed. Why? Even state government hospitals thwarted the Centre&rsquo;s plan for on-thespot oxygen production facili ties. The Print says, orders were placed in December but when vendors reached the hospitals for installation, many &ldquo;faced resistance&rdquo; from them, pretending &ldquo;no space&rdquo; &mdash; the real reason being vested interest to procure oxygen rather than generating the entire requirement onsite. This showed how advance planning for on-thespot oxygen supply by the Centre was thwarted by even the state-run hospitals. In the contemporary shouting and counter shouting in the media and social media, has anyone heard about this farsighted move of the government, beyond the feeble voice of The Print? \n\n***New Covid Tsunami Isn'ta return of the old*** \n\nAn even more critical fact that is absent in the discourse on oxygen deficit, is that the present Covid Tsunami is not the return of the old, but a totally unanticipated new one massifying like hell. The Covid curve, which began rising from March first week, gathered pace through March, rose fast in the first two weeks of April and became a Tsunami later. In just seven weeks, Bihar saw a rise of daily new cases by 522 times, UP by 399 times, Andhra by 186 times, Delhi and Jharkhand by 150 times, West Bengal by 142 times and Rajasthan by 123 times &mdash; disaster of a size, a Tsunami, beyond anyone&rsquo;s anticipation. This is not the repeat of Covid 1.0 last year. It is a new, double mutant Indian variety that got generated in each place where Covid 1.0 had gone before. No expert could anticipate this. This was bound to flood hospitals and ICUs throwing all plans awry. \n\n ***Need national will*** \n\nThis unprecedented Tsunami called for shared responsibility and collective will to face it and not to miss the facts or misdirect the discourse and shift the blame. That even in the face of a national disaster like Covid we showed the lack of collective will is a matter of concern. How the opposition parties branded the vaccine, Covaxin, approved by the government for emergency use exposed this national deficit. Except Rajasthan, opposition-ruled Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, West Bengal and Jharkhand created doubts in people&rsquo;s mind about vaccines. Result, the people hesitated for the jab. In January only 33% beneficiaries were willing for the shot, 40% preferred to wait and 16% said &lsquo;No&rsquo;. In March, those willing rose to 57%, those who preferred to wait halved and naysayers reduced to 6%. Three precious months were lost. \n\nAgainst an average daily vaccination of 30 lakh, making it 9 crore a month, only 10.8 crore had first jabs, and 1.6 crore had double jabs till March, which could have been double that number had vaccine hesitancy not crept in. Also, as a nation we let down our guard. As the Google mobility data shows, despite Covid continuing we began leading a near normal life &mdash; 78% in entertainment, 87% in parks and public places, 92% in transportation, and 120% in shopping as compared to the pre-lockdown period. And mostly without social distancing and without wearing masks. Now we have a huge challenge &mdash; to face up to which we need collective national will. Are we capable of it?"<br />Author: 'notorious_kitten'<br />id: 'n14n5m' &nbsp;num_comments: 1 &nbsp;score: 1</li>

To begin with we must take a look at the Mughals.\n\nAt the time when Babur first contemplated the idea of invading India he had already conquered Kabul. Zahir-ud-din Mohammed Babur, was the eldest of Umar Sheikh Mirza, who was governor of Ferghana, which is a region in eastern Uzbekistan. Babur was by lineage the great-great grandson of Timur. Babur\'s early military career was full of frustrations. Born in 1483, he had assumed the Throne of his father at age 12, in the year 1494. He conquered Samarkand two years later, only to lose Fergana soon after. In his attempts to reconquer Fergana, he lost control of Samarkand. In 1501, his attempt to recapture both the regions failed when Muhammad Shaybani Khan the founder of the Shaybanid dynasty, defeated him. He conquered Kabul, in 1504, after having being driven away from his patrimony and homeland. He formed an alliance with the Safavid Shah Ismail I, to take parts of Turkestan as well as Samarkand itself only to lose them again to the Shaybanids.\n\nHence, he had decided to give up on the dreams of taking back Ferghana and Samarkand and set his eyes on North India. At the time he had only thought of conquering the Punjab region. A task he accomplished in his second campaign in 1525, after a short campaign in 1519. Thus, at this juncture, we the political situation in North India was ripe for conflict and power changes. In Punjab, Babur prepared for a march towards Delhi to take it and all the realms under the rule of the Lodi Dynasty from Ibrahim Lodi who was currently the sultan of the Delhi Sultanate, whose own relatives, Daulat Khan Lodi and Alauddin had invited Babur to invade the Delhi Sultanate. Under the Lodi Dynasty the Sultanate had lost most of its eastern and southern as well as western territories and Ibrahim ruled over merely the Upper Gangetic plains. Meanwhile, a third contender for power and perhaps bigger threat to Babur\'s rise was looming in the Rajputana, in the form of the Rajput Confederacy, which was the first of its kind since the reign of Prithviraj Chauhan. This Confederacy was formed under the auspicious leadership of Rana Sangram Singh, of House Sisodiya of Mewar which had risen in prestige and power at the cost of neighbouring Malwa and Gujurati Sultanates during the reign of Rana Sangram other wise known as Rana Sanga.\n\nThe following events are well known, Babur defeated the Lodis at Panipat and then faced the Rajputs at Khanwa in 1527. However after his victories at Chanderi and at Ghaghra, he soon died leaving the Empire to his son Humayun whose reign was turbulent and prospects uncertain until his son Akbar assumed the Throne.\n\nNow let us look at the Sisodias of Mewar. This house of Rajputs traces it\'s origins from the legendary Suryavnshi lineage. But while records to back up such claims are obviously questionable, the historical foundation of this dynasty lies in the rise of Rana Hammir Singh, the founder of the Sisodiya Cadet Branch of the Guhila dynasty. The Guhila dynasty was extinguished by Alauddin Khalji after he besieged and conquered Chittor in 1303, their capital. But Rana Hammir Singh had taken back Chittor and since then reclaimed control of the region and re-established the dynasty under its cadet branch of the Sisodias by 1326. Owing to the legendary exploits of their kings and being one of the few Hindu noble houses that had remained independent during the successive reigns of various dynasties at the helm of the Delhi Sultanate, the House of Mewar carried weight amongst Rajput nobility.\n\nApart from Rana Hammir Singh, two rulers in particular, Rana Kumbharna Singh (1433-1468) and his great grandson Rana Sangram Singh (1508-1528), had raised the prestige of the House of Mewar to astronomical heights by not only defeating neighbouring Sultanates in Gujurat, Nagaur, Delhi and Malwa, but infact under the reign of Rana Sangram, actually conquering Gujurat and Malwa. Therefore, by 1526, most Rajput states had formed a Confederacy under the leadership of Rana Sanga. Ofcourse, following his defeat the Confederacy fell apart and while the house of Mewar still held a high place on the Rajput and indeed the Indian sociopolitical stage, there would never again be such a untied political front offered by the Rajputs. \n\nIn terms of the motivations and objectives of the Confederacy, it could be said that the Confederacy was buoyed together towards the political wills of the Rana of Mewar. Rana Sanga had made a policy to attack and acquire the territories of his kingdom\'s old enemies such as the Sultanates of Delhi, Gujurat, Nagaur and Malwa, and at the same time remove any traces of Turkic or Afghan dominion in North India. Therefore, it would be safe to say that had Babur not invaded Delhi and taken the Upper Ganga Valley, the Rana would have quite soon. Among the many noble houses that had joined the Rajput Confederacy was the next dynasty which will complete the puzzle to understanding the key players in North India and Mughal-Rajput history.\n\nThis was the Kachwahas of Amber. This dynasty claimed it\'s descent from the son Kush of the legendary King Rama of Ayodhya. Their ancestors allegedly migrated from Rama\'s kingdom of Kosala and established a new dynasty at Gwalior. After 31 generations, they moved to Rajputana and created a kingdom at Dhundhar. Dullah Rai, one of the ancestors of the Kachwaha rulers, defeated the Meenas of Manchi and Amber and later completed the conquest of Dhundhar by defeating the Bargurjars of Dausa and Deoti. However, in the early 16th century, they were conquered and vassalised by the Rathore ruler Maldeo of the kingdom of Marwar.\n\nIn 1527, the ruler of Amber who had joined the Rajput Confederacy was Prithviraj Singh I. Prithviraj had fought at Khanwa and like Rana Sanga, died soon afterwards, being succeeded by his son Puranmal. After Puranmal\'s succession, which was quite controversial, the Kachwaha domain became unstable over disputes regarding the succession of Puranmal to the Throne. This problem was only further exacerbated by neighbouring Rajput kingdoms that sought to capitalise on the situation. While accounts about Puranmal seeking the aid of Humayun are varying and quite contradictory we know for sure that after Puranmal, his brother Bhim Singh assumed the Throne. Bhim only reigned three and a half years before dying on 22 July 1537. He was succeeded in quick succession by two sons, Ratan Singh and Askaran, before the throne eventually passed to his younger brother Bharmal in 1548.\n\nIt is here that we arrive at a crucial juncture in Mughal-Rajput relations. In Mewar, the reigns were assumed by the 4th son of Rana Sanga, Maharana Udai Singh II, under whose reign the capital of Chittor was lost to Akbar in 1568 and the capital was shifted to Udaipur. Here his son, Maharana Pratap assumed the Throne after Udai died in 1572. Meanwhile, Akbar had overthrown his guardian Bairam Khan who had grown too ambitious and controlling and at the age of 18, the young Baadshaah of the Mughal Empire removed Bairam from service and continued his expeditions by directly controlling all affairs from 1560 onwards. Meanwhile, in 1562, the situation became critical for the Kachwahas of Amber when Mirza Muhammad Sharaf-ud-din Hussain was appointed Mughal governor of Mewat. Mirza led a large army to Amber which Bharmal could not resist. Mirza forced the Kachwahas to leave Amber and live in forests and hills. Bharmal promised a fixed tribute to Mirza and handed over his own son, Jagannath, and his nephews, Raj Singh and Khangar Singh, as hostages for its due payment. When Sharaf-ud-din was preparing to invade Amber again, Bharmal met Akbar\'s courtier, Chaghtai Khan. Fortunately, for Bharmal, Akbar was at Karavali (a village near Agra) on his way from Agra to Ajmer (on a pilgrimage to the dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti). Bharmal himself met Akbar at his camp at Sanganer on 20 January 1562. Here, Bharmal proposed a marriage between Akbar and his eldest daughter Hira Kunwari. Therefore, when Akbar agreed, the Kachwahas were now relatives of Akbar, Bharmal was his father-in-law and was in par with the highest Muslim nobles of the Empire. Hence, Sharaf-ud-din Mirza, returned to Bharmal his lands and relatives and in the following years, the Kachwahas rendered unwavering service to the Mughals while they themselves enjoyed the highest salaries, status and prestige the Empire had to offer.\n\nHence, The House of Mewar, still held in the highest esteem by all Rajput nobility was in a period of decline and The House of Amber had united with the Mughals. Raja Bharmal was succeeded by his son Raja Bhagwant Das in 1574. He served as Akbar\'s General and was awarded a rank or mansab of 5000 along with the title of Amir-ul-Umra. He fought battles in Punjab, Kashmir where he decisively defeated the Kashmiri King Yousuf Shah Chak and Afghanistan as well and he held the governorship of Kabul. His daughter Manbhawati Bai was married off to the Mughal Prince and future Emperor Jehangir. He died in 1589 being succeeded by his son Raja Man Singh.\n\nRaja Man Singh, assumed the Throne of Amber in 1589, but he had served with distinction at the Battle of Haldighati 1576 against the Maharana of Mewar, Maharana Pratap in a legendary battle, and in other campaigns as well. The reason why Akbar wanted to conquer Rajputana and especially Mewar was because with Mewar and the Rajputs at his flanks, his empire would never be secure, a fact he had learned by learning about the experiences of the Delhi Sultanate and their fruitless tussle with the Sisodiya dynasty. Yet, in his lifetime, Akbar could not conquer Mewar. Even after being defeated at Haldighati, where his army of 3000-4000 Rajputs and allied Bhils (400 men approx.), was defeated by Man Singh who commanded the Imperial Mughal Army roughly 8000-10,000 in numbers, Pratap Singh endured and by the end of his reign, he scored a decisive victory against the Mughals at Dewair in 1582 and took back Western Mewar including Kumbhalgarh, Udaipur and Gogunda through guerilla warfare and even destroyed newly built mosques in these regions in retaliation. He died in 1597.\n\nAfter his death, his son Maharana Amar Singh I (r. 1597-1620) assumed the Throne and followed his father\'s policy of resisting Mughal overlordship. Amar Singh continued to resist the Mughals and it was clear that he could not be taken in a battle, so &nbsp;Mewar was devastated financially and in manpower due to the policy of Shah Jahan (son of Jahangir, Jahangir had become Emperor in 1605 after Akbar\'s death) , to scorch the lands of Mewar and make it incapable of supporting the efforts of Amar Singh. Finally, in 1615, Amar Singh submitted to the Mughals. Mewar including Chittor was assigned to him as Watan Jagir or hereditary patrimony. He secured a favourable peace treaty and it was ensured that Mewar would never bend his knee to the Mughal Emperors or serve at his court personally nor would the House of Mewar enter into matrimonial relations with the Mughals.\n\nHence, we see a clear policy emerging from the Mughals towards the Rajputs since the reign of Akbar. The first, religious tolerance and engagement at a political level, treating them as warriors and nobles on par with the Iranis or Turks in the Imperial service. The second, realising that the prestige of Mewar and the potential of the Rajputs uniting once again was an ever present threat and therefore it was better to assuage them. Third, following a policy of providing high posts and port folios to Rajput nobles who allied or accepted Mughal suzerainty. Fourth, matrimonial relations were never the prerequisite for such alliances as many Rajputs had previously simply accepted Mughal suzerainty and had acquired high posts for themselves.\n\nFinally, the attitudes in Rajputana and in general accross North India were shaped by the actions and decisions of the Rajput houses of Mewar and Amber. While Mewar only grew in prestige as the last stronghold and symbol of strength and resistance for the more conservative elements in Hindu society, the House of Amber was universally recognised as a house which produced some of the finest administrators and generals the Empire would ever know. And yet, the more conservative elements in Hindu society saw the House of Amber as traitors, ofcourse such opinions were never discussed in front of the Amber Rajas. \n\nUntil the reign of Aurangzeb, the Rajputs were more or less, united under the Mughal cause. They fought and led expeditions as far west and Afghanistan and Qandahar and as east as Bengal and Odissa. In 1585, Man Singh I was sent to conquer Afghanistan and silence the rebels there. Man Singh decisively defeated five major tribes of the Afghans including Yusufzai and "Mandar" tribes. The flag of Amber was changed from "Katchanar" (green climber in white base) to "Pachranga" (five colored) to commemorate this victory. This flag continued in use until accession of Jaipur state in India. This permanently crushed the revolt and the area remained peaceful thereafter.\n\nIn 1586 CE, Akbar sent another army under Raja Bhagwant Das, father of Prince Man Singh I to win Kashmir. Kashmir was included in the Mughal Empire and made a Sarkar (district) of Kabul province.\n\nMan Singh I also conquered Bihar in similar fashion. Abul Fazl has described Man Singhs campaign in Bihar in the following words. "The Raja united ability with courage and genius with strenuous action".\n\nMan Singh after conquering Bihar was ordered to defeat the Afghan Sultan Qatlu Khan Lohani of Orissa, Man Singh set out for Orissa on April 1590. By 1592, Odissa was also conquered by him.\n\nHis grandson Jai Singh I (r. 1621 - 1667), was another great General of the Mughal Empire. He was the second Raja to receive the title Mirza Raja, the first being his grandfather Man Singh I who received it from Akbar. During his career he served first in the Deccan, subduing the Gonds and then in Central Asia, fighting at Kandahar in the Mughal-Safavid wars and at Balkh.\n\n\nJai Singh, who had begun his own military career in the Deccan, was then appointed to lead a 14,000 strong army against Shivaji. And in 1665, he forced Shivaji to sign the Treaty of Purandar being the only noble in the. Empire to subdue the Maratha King. Although the opportunity his victories provided were made meaningless thanks to Aurangzeb\'s inability to compromise on his orthodox beliefs and accept Shivaji into his court with proper honours.\n\nIn conclusion, until the reign of Aurangzeb, whose interference into the succession matters of Rajput states, a matter which was left to the Rajputs by Akbar himself, the Rajputs, especially the house of Amber, continued to serve the Empire with loyalty and distinction. Both to serge the larger interests of the Empire and the interests of their own houses and their kingdoms. \n\n\nSources :\n\n\n"A History of Jaipur" by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n"Shivaji and His Times" By Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n" Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals (1206&ndash;1526) Part 2" by Satish Chandra\n\n\n"Akbarnama" by Abu\'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, Henry Beveridge (Trans.) \n\n\n"A Military History of India" by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n"History and Culture of the Indian People Volume VII : The Mughal Empire" by R.C Majumdar'<br />Author: 'MaharajadhirajaSawai'<br />id: 'mtf1ee' &nbsp;num_comments: 16 &nbsp;score: 1</li>

But only 14% actually lived over there.\n\nBoth jinnah(and the muslim league) as well as many prominent leaders like patel and ambedkar were of the view that parition has to be complete so as to remove the possibility of riots permanently. The muslim league actually wanted all the muslims to come to pakistan (as was done by them in awarding freebies like promoted posts and stuff in pakistan) and that was their actual demand. Thats why they wanted states like sindh and baluchistan to house the incoming muslims from india( remember that partition only took place in punjab and bengal, sindh was given wholeheartedly despite having a significant hindu population, currently known as sindhi. \n\nBut both gandhi and nehru were opposed to this and in their way to make up to the muslims who "chose" to stay in india , were awarded freebies like a personal law board, tax free madrassa and masjid setups etc, basically a way to make them stay back in india itself.\n\nIn short, muslims chose to stay in india, hindus and sikhs were expelled from pakistan, &nbsp;so shorter landmass taking influx of more and more people. The muslims in pakistan filled up that void by having a birthrate of around 3.5, while hindu population in india has around 1.8.\n\nSo when they say that muslims are only 16% of india, &nbsp;they hide the fact that its on 26% lower landmass. This has resulted in the balance ratio being 4:1 &nbsp;in 1947 to 4:3 in the indian subcontinent currently.\n\n\nP.S if you\'ve read it this far please give it an upvote so that it reaches max people on the sub.

He reinforced the foundations of the state after partition of 1947, got the Durgapur &amp;amp; Alloy Steel Plant, Chittaranjan Locomotives, India&rsquo;s 1st satellite town in Kalyani, Digha Beach Resort, expanded the engineering industries, set up engineering, technology, medical, management, and other institutes. \n\nCalcutta and Jadavpur used to be the prime universities in India those days. West Bengal had the IIM, IIT, Indian Statistical Institute, the Operations Research School, Bengal Engineering College, besides, of course, Presidency College, SXC, Scottish Church and many other venerable institutes.\n\nIt was the HQ of Birla, JK, Bangur, and Thapar and Tata. The grand Tata Centre was built for that purpose. This was the vision of TATA'S. Most of their investment was in Jamshedpur. Most foreign companies had their India HQs in Calcutta. This was the reason Calcutta has best of the Clubs in the country. It had the highest number of International flights, Bombay used to serve mainly Aden, Muscat, and East Africa.\n\nAnd then &lsquo;Ashok Kumar Nite&rsquo; happened in February 1968. Women were dragged out and their naked dead raped bodies were found in and around the lake over the next two days. The CPM leaders (Jyoti Basu &amp;amp; Co) called it &ldquo;the rise of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie&rdquo; and justified it.\n\nCalcutta started emptying. Soon after, Aditya Birla was dragged out of his car between GPO &amp;amp; RBI, opposite Writers Building, thrashed, clothes torn, stripped down to his undergarments and made to walk like that to his office at 15 India Exchange Place. With a crowd roaring in laughter and jeering, he went home and took a flight to Bombay, never to return. He took all his money and offices out of Bengal. Today they are one of the top industrial houses in the country. \n\nSo did JK, so did Thapar, within a month. So did most entrepreneurs, so did most MNCs. Latest example was ousting of Tata Nano. Those were &lsquo;Mass Exodus&rsquo; of money and employment from the state. Today no Industrial house plans to start any project in the state. That, this being the dream that the Communists wanted, and there is no change by the present government too. \n\nCommunists in West Bengal started their political power capturing from &lsquo;Ashok Kumar Nite&rsquo; in 1968 and went through &lsquo;Sain Bari killings&rsquo; in 1970, &lsquo;Marichjhapi massacre&rsquo; in 1979, &lsquo;Bijon Setu massacre&rsquo; of 1982 to &lsquo;Bantala gang rape&rsquo; of 1990, &lsquo;Nanoor massacre&rsquo; of 2000 and &lsquo;Nandigram massacre&rsquo; of 2007. They destroyed the work culture and closed down thousands of factories in West Bengal in the name of violent Trade Union and Co-ordination Committee. Presently, the state has been infected with culture of &lsquo;Cut Money&rsquo;, &lsquo;Syndicate&rsquo;, Para-teachers, Civic Volunteers and migration of lakhs of labourers to other states. &nbsp; \n\nThose educated ones, who could not cope up with destruction of West Bengal migrated out to other parts of India; to other countries. One finds so many teachers, scientists, researchers, doctors, economists, artists, from West Bengal in the US, UK, France, Germany, Benelux, Scandinavia, but none worth the name here in Bengal. It was a &lsquo;Mass Exodus&rsquo; of brains.\n\nThe people of West Bengal have been strangely watching this downhill journey of the state for five decades and will do so unfortunately for another five decades. One may see the state to turn into an Islamic State in near future. Just keep your fingers crossed.&rdquo; \n\nPS: Number of beggars per hundred thousand population is highest (89) in West Bengal at present. This is the bottom line.\n\nTHE PRESENT GENERATION IS UNAWARE OF THE REASONS FOR THE FALL OF GOLDEN BENGAL. &nbsp; \nThis piece of History is kept away from them by the perpetrators to achieve their mean goal.

I find truth in every narrative, and &nbsp;lies, and the logical fallacies attached with it. The inherent nature of &nbsp;setting a narrative is based on some assumption, some pre-conceived &nbsp;notions and some agendas. Not only I welcome every voice, but I actually &nbsp;like to see it gets its due respect. But the problem arises when I see &nbsp;only the truth is recognised but the lies and the fallacies goes &nbsp;unnoticed. It creates a new set of "Bhakts". &nbsp;\n \n\nRecently the &nbsp;speech of Mahua Moitra in LS has garnered a lot of buzz. I consider it &nbsp;very healthy for democracy and I welcome it when I saw it the first &nbsp;time. But seeing people are going gaga over this I thought I should &nbsp;bring out the fallacies I noticed. &nbsp;\n \n\nFirst of all, shouting does not make your case and &nbsp;point, your arguments do. Now let&rsquo;s go and break down the arguments &nbsp;point by point. &nbsp;\n \n\nIntroduction: &nbsp;\n "Constitution is under &nbsp;threat" - is not backed by any example. Just going with the confirmation &nbsp;bias that is present in mainstream media. Just check how many &nbsp;constitutional amendment bills have been presented in the house in last &nbsp;five years and how many got mandate from opposition as well. A case of &nbsp;circular argument. &nbsp;\n Carefully choosing words - "The sun will never &nbsp;set on this Indian empire that the government is seeking to build" - &nbsp;trying to draw analogy from British Empire. &nbsp; \n \n\n1. "Powerful and &nbsp;continuing nationalism" - uses adjective like \'superficial\', &nbsp;\'xenophobic\' and \'narrow\' and links it with Nationalism, which I find &nbsp;problematic, although, I agree with the argument about NRC. &nbsp;\n Also I agree that there cannot be one slogan, one symbol for the diversity that India has. &nbsp; \n &nbsp;But Indian Nationalism is different from western construct. Just like &nbsp;the State and Nation-state in Europe, where Nation-state has a broader &nbsp;connotation, India has the Concept of Rajya and Rashtra. The Republic of &nbsp;India is "Bharat Ganarajya" (Check your Passport), which is defined by &nbsp;the border, emblem, flag etc. But the Rashtra of India is broader than &nbsp;the Republic of India. Heck even the emblem is a symbol of \'Ashokan &nbsp;State\' not of \'Kautilyan State\'. It encapsulates the cultural and &nbsp;historical idea of Bharat. &nbsp;\n \n\n2. Disdain for human Rights &nbsp;violation: She mentions that there is 10X increase of hate crime from &nbsp;2014 and 2019. I am not sure where she got this data from. I don&rsquo;t think &nbsp;there is any profiling of criminal case based on hate crime. I do not &nbsp;know what IPC or CRPC sections could be classified as hate crimes. This &nbsp;seems to be a case of hyperbole and Hasty Generalisation. Please give me &nbsp;an authentic source of information where this claim can be &nbsp;substantiated. I am willing to reconsider my position. &nbsp;\n She mentions &nbsp;Pehlu Khan to Ansari. Now there are few other incidents that she is &nbsp;missing. I can give you a list of 50 cases where the victim is not from &nbsp;minority community. So this is clearly a Law and Order issue, which is a &nbsp;state subject. Instead of voicing for police reform she is giving it a &nbsp;communal colour. &nbsp; \n Instead of talking about what police reform could &nbsp;be facilitated she is implying it is a case of communal violence. A case &nbsp;of Appeal to Pity. &nbsp;\n It is not that all hell broke in 2014 and people &nbsp;started lynching. It is a law and order issue which needs to be fixed &nbsp;ASAP. And why would you do that? After all out of the 545+245 members of &nbsp;both the houses of parliament, probably 100+ are out on bail and 200+ &nbsp;have criminal case registered against them. Who would axe their own &nbsp;feet? &nbsp;\n \n\n3. Controlling mass media: &nbsp;\n 5 of this media house is &nbsp;directly or indirectly controlled by one man in this country. She does &nbsp;not mention who this person is, but that is Ok. &nbsp; \n TV channels played &nbsp;propaganda for the ruling party. You mean both Namo TV and ABP Ananda, &nbsp;right? Just like those unreported riots that were influenced &nbsp;politically, right? &nbsp;\n She is asking for ad spent per media house. &nbsp;Which is good enough argument. I think we all agree with that. Now would &nbsp;you support the demand for bringing the National Parties under RTI? &nbsp;Would you support the same argument for the political parties? Let\'s not &nbsp;form a smog and create an illusion of making a good argument. I don&rsquo;t &nbsp;have problem with the points that have been raised, rather I have &nbsp;problem with people calling you a good debater. Don\'t worry, I am not &nbsp;going into nitty-gritty of what you do in a debate. That would be Ad &nbsp;hominem on my part. &nbsp;\n Now let&rsquo;s come to the point that 120+ people are &nbsp;recruited for I&amp;amp;B Ministry, whose job is solely to check the &nbsp;contents of TV every day. Now, as per my knowledge, I&amp;amp;B ministry is &nbsp;mainly responsible for running only government channels, i.e., LSTV, &nbsp;RSTV AIR News etc. My information might be wrong. But content is subject &nbsp;matter of each individual private media. And even in Government &nbsp;channel, there are coverage for all significant parties. Have you ever &nbsp;even watched a government channel? Have you ever watched the debates &nbsp;conducted on RSTV? Let\'s talk about facts, not &nbsp;assumption. You are going all Strawman over this topic. &nbsp;\n Election was &nbsp;fought on fake news and Whatsapp. Telling a lie a thousand times and it &nbsp;becomes truth. Gabble doctrine. Again false equivalence drawn between &nbsp;Hitler and current regime. Now please madam, decide what do you want to &nbsp;call this legislative body out for? For being a imperialist Britain or &nbsp;Fascist Germany? However I understand the point you are trying to make. &nbsp; \n &nbsp;36 Dynasts of Congress vs. 31 of BJP. That is a party wise tally, I &nbsp;should not get into that. But this is what I like about BJP and CPIM. &nbsp;Both the party has cadre system. Anyone can work their way up and reach &nbsp;the top position. Not in congress I guess. It also seems that in future &nbsp;AITC will turn into a dynastic party. And there is a difference between &nbsp;"MP ka beta MP" and "PM ka beta PM". &nbsp;\n \n\n4. National Security: Fear &nbsp;pervading everywhere. Kalabhoot? Where is this argument going madam? It &nbsp;is going all red herring. You mentioned 106% increase of death of Army &nbsp;Jawans in J&amp;amp;K. Now is the data based on Year on Year basis? Or based &nbsp;on 5 years term? I also think that is possible given 44 Jawans died in &nbsp;Pulwama and several other incidents but please specify the details. What &nbsp;have you done to co-operating when action is needed? What are your &nbsp;stand on cross border human trafficking, Cattle smuggling in Bengal &nbsp;border? WB ranks number one in girl child trafficking. Why are you not &nbsp;pressuring Central Government to fix porous border? Why are you not &nbsp;improving Law and Order situation in WB? Who is stopping you? Why don&rsquo;t &nbsp;you file a PIL to SC if the Central government is not cooperating? Get a &nbsp;mandate from SC and pressurise the government. 22 MP seats are good &nbsp;enough to disrupt LS in case you are really willing to work. &nbsp;\n &nbsp;Religion and government has already been intertwined. If you don&rsquo;t &nbsp;agree, go read Article 30 of Constitution, Hindu Marriage Act, Muslim &nbsp;Personnel Law to name a few. It is a shame that instead of being &nbsp;\'secular\' country, India still has separate civil law based on religion. &nbsp;You forgot to mention Article 44 of the Constitution of India. &nbsp;\n \n\n 5. You said that only one community is targeted via Anti-Immigration &nbsp;law. First of all, it is not anti-immigration law, it is Citizenship &nbsp;Amendment Act. You are twisting words just to inflate the gravity of the &nbsp;situation. &nbsp; \n Now what does the Citizenship Amendment Act says? It &nbsp;says that is applies for prosecuted Religious Minority of Pakistan, &nbsp;Afghanistan and Bangladesh. What are the provision? It is just that the &nbsp;norms for citizenship for these prosecuted minorities are a bit relaxed. &nbsp;It does not prosecute minorities of India. &nbsp; \n And let&rsquo;s not confuse &nbsp;between NRC and Citizenship Amendment Bill. NRC pact was signed between &nbsp;Rajiv Gandhi and Assam Students Union in 1985. &nbsp;\n I guess you have some &nbsp;confusion over Ram Mandir Land and rest of India. While Ram Mandir land &nbsp;is Nationalised land, govt has yet kept this for consideration of SC so &nbsp;that democratic right of all the concerned parties can have a voice. &nbsp;What security do you want? Law and Order or Border Security? Govt is &nbsp;trying enough to strengthen Border security. What are you doing to &nbsp;strengthen Law and Order situation? &nbsp;\n \n\n6. Disdain for &nbsp;Intellectuals and art. O ho ho ho ho! Let\'s not even dig an inch deeper &nbsp;what happens in the field of intellectual and art. Let&rsquo;s not try to link &nbsp;who\'s who in there. Who is whose cousin, brother, sister, father, &nbsp;mother, husband etc., who is patronised by whom. Let&rsquo;s not try to find &nbsp;out how and why historians like RC Majumdar was side-lined. Let&rsquo;s not &nbsp;argue how curriculum and historical perception has changed since &nbsp;independence. Just go and check NCERT Secondary History text books how &nbsp;many time Netaji was mentioned. &nbsp;\n \'Secondary school textbook are &nbsp;manipulated\'. First of all, that is a blatant and white lie. Last &nbsp;amendment was done during UPA rule. &nbsp; \n I agree with you that there is a &nbsp;severe crisis of research facility. Where government is keen on &nbsp;investing only on space, defence, We need a massive infrastructure and &nbsp;huge funding on RnD. Without strong RnD facility we will remain &nbsp;dependent upon foreign countries in matters of modern technologies. Just &nbsp;merely mentioning Lack of Scientific Temperament does not provide a &nbsp;solution. &nbsp; \n \n\n7. Erosion of independence of EC: Government has &nbsp;introduced EVM, VVPAT. Have invited political parties to come and try to &nbsp;figure out if there is any flaw in the machine. And about the &nbsp;independence of EC, I cannot help you if you are deliberately blind to &nbsp;the actions EC took against parties other than yours, or ruling party &nbsp;for the matter. &nbsp;\n \n\nWe have thousands and thousands of \'experts\' &nbsp;who can criticise, censure the actions of governments, but very few can &nbsp;provide constructive criticism and alternative mode of governance. I &nbsp;would like you to see as a responsible MP and provide constructive &nbsp;argument on how the government should work. Merely pointing fingers can &nbsp;produce a lot of fan boys and fan girls, but that ultimately contributes &nbsp;nothing to the society.'<br />Author: 'Straight_Razor007'<br />id: 'mhrmdk' &nbsp;num_comments: 25 &nbsp;score: 1</li>

Madan singh Rathore was weapon teacher of Guru har gobind and fought against mughals for him .Sardar Mandan singh Rathore saved guru hargobind singh at the battle of rohilla and &nbsp;taught \'shastarvidya to Sikhs \' and militarised them.\n\n2. Bajjar singh Rathore was the teacher of Guru Gobind singh ji maharaj.\n\n3.Alam singh chauhan was the teacher of sahibzadas(sons of guru gobind singh ji maharaj).\n\n4. Mirza raja jai singh kachwaha of jaipur was a devotee of sikh gurus.He saved guru tegh bahadur sahib ji when he was arrested first time while travelling towards bihar,bengal and assam.jai singh went against the order of Aurangzeb and relesed guru sahib.\n\n5. Banda singh bahadur was a minhas rajput.He became the leader of sikhs after the death of guru gobind singh ji.He captured the mughal state of sirhind and took revenge from wazir khan who killed innocent sons of gurupita gobind singh ji and also gave zamindari rights to petty peasant\'s in punjab.\n\n6.Gurudwara bangla sahib actually belongs to mirza raja jai singh kachwaha of jaipur.He donoted his personal bungalow to sikh gurus.\n\n7 .The concept of keeping kirpan comes from Rajputana culture .\n\n8.The 1st governer of khalsa raj was a sikh rajput.\n\n9. Elder son from hindu family was given to Gurus to save Dharma.\n\n10. Mati Das , Dayal Das , Sati Das were Hindus who sacrificed their Life but didn\'t accept Islam just like Guru Teg Bahadur. \n\n11. &nbsp;Sardar gulab Singh Rathore was the founder of \'dallewalia misl\'.\n\n12. Rai bular bhatti gave guru nanak 18000 acres of land...\n\nBHAI BACHITTAR SINGH &nbsp;and many more....\n\nBut, Nothing can enter into radical misguided Sikhs\' mind now, they are brainwashed completely with distorted history + manipulated events and radicalized with hatred against BJP and superiority complex over Hindus till their core.\n\n--------------- What Sikhs will never talk about ---------\n\n1. Britishers preferred &nbsp;Sikhs in their army because they were least hesitant to kill and fire at people when ordered by Britishers. Especially after the mutiny of 1857 where everyone had revolted except Sikhs. Britishers found it hard to have complete faith on solders from rest of India after having tasted mutiny from them in 1857.\n\n2. Sikh regiment was also a &nbsp;part of Jalianwala bagh Massacre who had fired at people on General\'s orders.\n https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jallianwala_Bagh_massacre \n\nWhereas, Entire battalion of Garhwal Rifles was sentenced to kala pani &nbsp;by Britishers when they had refused to shoot at protestors in Peshawar. It\'s also called Qissa Khwani Massacre.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qissa_Khwani_massacre\n\nBritish civil servant wrote later that "hardly any regiment of the Indian Army won greater glory in the Great War (World War I) than the Garhwal Rifles, and the defection of part of the regiment sent shock waves through India, of apprehension to some, of exultation to others." \n\nThe NCOs of the two platoons, including one led by Hawaldar Major Chandra Singh Garhwali, involved were sentenced to terms of up to eight years imprisonment"\n\n3. Maharaja Ala Singh , A sikh was the Founder of Patiala Kingdom and &nbsp;was a boot licker of Abdali.The Wadda Ghallughara happened during February 1762, where about 40,000 Sikhs were killed by Abdali. Due to Ala Singh&rsquo;s loyalty to Ahmed Shah Abdali, he was given land, elephants, horses, camels, cannons, jewelery, and plenty of cash. Due to the support from Abdali, Ala Singh conquered lands of Samana, Barnala, and founded Longowal. \n\n4. Maharaja of Patiala Bhupendra Singh\n\nBhupinder Singh&rsquo;s governorship of Punjab included extreme brutality by the police and he later refused to condemn the Jallianwala Massacre of April 1919. \n\nBhupinder Singh in a telegram told Dyer &ldquo;Your action is correct and the Lieutenant Governor approves.&rdquo; Instead, he was very friendly with General O&rsquo;Dwyer in London.\n\n5. Jathedar Arur Singh \n\nJathedar of Akal Takht Sahib Giani Arur Singh had presented General Michael O&rsquo;Dwyer with a siropa at Sri Akal Takht Sahib, the man responsible for Jallianwala Bagh on April 13, 1919. The traiter Giani Arur Singh not only presented the butcher of Sikhs a Siropa, but also gave a turban and a kirpan. \n\nThe Jathedar went so far that he declared General O&rsquo;Dwyer a Sikh and stated it&rsquo;s alright despite the fact he smoked cigarettes.\n\n6. Those who have problem with people saying gurus were hindus..because according to them Gurus had stopped following karm kaand and believing in Avatars. \n\nThen Why do they call Bhagat Singh a Sikh, when Bhagat Singh had become an atheist ( Nastik) ? Bhagat Singh even wrote a book " Why I am an Atheist". \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_I_Am_an_Atheist#:~:text=Why%20I%20am%20an%20Atheist%20is%20an%20essay%20written%20by,atheist%20because%20of%20his%20vanity.\n\nStupid Hypocrites !!'<br />Author: 'getbangedchatshit'<br />id: 'lpldhu' &nbsp;num_comments: 5 &nbsp;score: 1</li>

The takeaway, the lesson, let\'s recount it together. But some history first-\n\n*The year is 1818*\n\nA Christian priest, &nbsp;British Baptist minister, missionary, abolitionist and Harvard professor named William Adam, after taking his inspiration from churchman Thomas Chalmer &nbsp;decided to venture into India.\n\n With the help of American friends, Adam sent his family and left himself years later in 1838. There he met abolitionists and his background qualified him to be sent by the Americans as their representative to the anti-slavery meeting in London of the [British India Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_India_Society&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;redlink=1).\n\nBoston East Indian merchants were so impressed by his linguistic skills that they arranged for his to be made a Professor of Oriental Linguistics at [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University), but by 1840 he was publishing public letters to [Thomas Fowell Buxton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fowell_Buxton) warning of British complacency of assuming that because the West Indies no longer had slavery it did not mean that the British Empire had renounced slavery whilst India was unchanged.\n\n In 1840, Adam was sent with a large number of other Americans to the [World\'s Anti-Slavery Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_Anti-Slavery_Convention) in London, where he presented a paper about India. After the convention was completed the more notable people were recorded in a large painting for the [Anti-Slavery Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Slavery_International) &nbsp;.\n\n Reputedly they had been voted from the floor by clergyman who were generally not from the Church of England. In protest the four men took up seats with the sidelined women delegates. Adam said at the convention "If women had no right there, he had none, his credentials were from the same persons and the same society." \n\n Later after many discussions on Christianity and Indian thoughts on God, he found himself unable to resolve the doubts on Jesus Doctrines and logically felt defeated. (The life and letters of Raja Rammohun Roy by Collet, Sophia Dobson, 1822-1894, Page-68)\n\nAdam lost interest in the Baptist Mission, but not India, and with Roy and a mix of locals and Europeans formed the Calcutta Unitarian Society. The society ended in an unusual way when the Hindu membership became interested in the emerging ideas of [Brahmo Somaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmo_Somaj). In 1830,Adams was appointed by the colonial government of Bengal to carry out a census and analysis of native education in Bengal.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Adam_(minister)#cite_note-2)\n\nAnd it is this venture of his into India, while carrying out the analysis and census is what we\'re going to talk about-\n\n Following his investigations that lasted over two years (1836-8), William Adam submitted three reports which &ldquo;remain to this day an extremely important source of information regarding the state of indigenous education in early nineteenth century Bengal. \\[2\\] Four editions of [Adam&rsquo;s work,](https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.135582/2015.135582.Reports-On-The-State-Of-Education-In-Bengal1835-38_djvu.txt) including the original reports that were submitted to the government from 1835-38, have been published at various junctures of time. \n\n Adam&rsquo;s first report was based on a preliminary investigation and a review of pre-existing materials. It is the second and third reports of Adam that contain the results of his fieldwork and reveal a great deal of information. In his second report (which pertains to the district of Rajshahi in Bengal), Adam reveals that every native school has but one teacher. Adam&rsquo;s second report also informs us about the number of pupils, the usual age of admission as well as of leaving school, the medium of instruction, the curriculum, the school building and the remuneration of the teacher as well as the teacher&rsquo;s name, caste and age.\\[4\\] Adam&rsquo;s third report pertained to three districts of Bengal (Burdwan, Beerbhoom and Moorshedabad) and two districts of Bihar (Tirhoot and South Bihar). This report reveals for each district, the number of schools categorised according to the medium of instruction. \\[5\\] It is beyond the scope of this article to list all of the statistics compiled by Adam. So, we will only highlight the most noteworthy points that will help us get a fair idea of the state of education in those days. \n\n Let us look at some numbers to begin with. **In his first report, Adam observed that almost every village had a school. So, there were more than 100,000 village schools in Bengal and Bihar and there was a village school for every 400 persons. \\[6\\]**\xa0Adam&rsquo;s subsequent investigations looked at different kinds of schools in specific districts. For instance, his second report reveals that the district of South Bihar had a total of 286 Hindi schools in which 3,090 scholars received instruction. \\[7\\] \n\n(Let that sink in for a second, a 100,000 rural Gurukuls in the two states combined, let that sink in, because the same two states today lag behind and have less than that much no. of rural education institutions today, about 15%(or more) of rural areas in these 2 states till date still lack proper schooling facilities as per MHRD and RMD data from 2018) Moving on....\n\n**William Adam and "*****Brahminical Hegemony"*** **in the past**\n\n Adam&rsquo;s reports also give information about the social composition of students and teachers of indigenous elementary schools.It is interesting to note that these reports contradict the modern notion of Brahminical hegemony. \n\n Much ink has been spilled on the hegemony of Brahmins in indigenous institutions and the inaccessibility of education for the socially backward classes. \\[8\\] But Adam (like his counterparts in the Madras Presidency) found that a significant percentage of students belonged to low castes such as *Malo, Chandal, Kahar, Luniar, Dhoba* and *Kalu*. &nbsp;\n\n \\[9\\] These castes were also found to be well represented amongst the teachers of elementary schools, the majority of whom were non-Brahmins. For instance, Adam observed that in the district of South Bihar vernacular instruction was *&ldquo;almost wholly in the hands of the Kayastha or writer caste, and that the institutions of the country are still in this respect in almost unabated force. There are no brahman-teachers.&rdquo;* \n\n \\[10\\]\xa0**There is now a vast body of evidence in the form of colonial surveys indicating that nearly all sections of pre-colonial Indian society enjoyed comfortable access to mass elementary education.** \n\nSo much for the "Brahminical Patriarchy down-down",right?\n\nQualitative aspect-\n\n Adam found that a scholar typically went through four stages of instruction during the course of his studies in a Bengali *patshala*.\\[12\\] Amongst the textbooks taught in Bengali schools, the *Subhankar* was found by Adam to be commonly used for basic arithmetic. Elementary grammar was taught through books such as *Sabda Subanta* and *Ashta Sabdi.* In addition, the Sanskrit verses of *Chanakya* (a book on statecraft and general principles by the ancient philosopher named Chanakya who lived between 371 and 283 B.C.) containing pithy maxims and general precepts of morality were read and memorized. Other general instruction included compositions in praise of various gods and goddesses such as *Data Karna* (on the altruistic nature of Karna, a hero in the *Mahabharata*), *Ram Janma* (on the birth of Lord Ram), *Ganga Bandana* (on the qualities of the river Ganges) etc. as well as extracts from religious epics such as the *Sundar Kand* of the *Ramayana,* or the *Adi Parva* of the *Mahabharata* etc. \\[13\\] \n\nHence it will not be wrong to conclude that the Gurukul system was what kept Pre-colonial India well rooted for its culture and the youth was not left astray.\n\nAs a matter of fact, contradicting the "Brahminical hegemonical" narrative that the left/liberals like to spit out like air everywhere, in all of the provinces that Adam surveyed, the lower caste students in Gurukuls, outnumbered the "upper-castes" by a ratio of almost 2:1 and even greater than 3:1 in some provinces.\n\nAll this while, Adam, while on his survey didn\'t encounter a single child who wasn\'t familiar with basic arithmetic, not a single person who he could call iliterate.\n\nEventually the same Gurukul system that kept us well connected to our roots and united as a society was chopped down by the English Education Act, 1835 but that\'s a story for another time.\n\nTherefore, after understanding the takeaways from the history we just dwelled into, I would like you all to come back to the first two *slokas* that I cited at the beginning, both verses are from the Manusmriti, the same code of law that haunts the left/liberal brigade like their worst nightmare, they keep quoting one single verse to try and establish the text as casteist, but the fact remains that all they can do is nitpick, because the slokas I cited indicate otherwise &nbsp;hence demolishing their narrative of the solid nature of caste, I assert, again here that caste was not something solid, birth based, it only became so after the EEA,\'35 was passed and everyone was told to get their castes put down on paper and the same narrative and law continues till date in the form of colonial hangover because many other colonial surveys like Adam and Monroe clearly establish the difference between the caste and the Varna system.\n\nFurthermore, if a 3000 year old code of law/jurisprudence (dated as assigned by &nbsp;Sir William Jones and Karl Wilhelm, Friedrich Schlegel) &nbsp;indicates that the Varna system was fluid and it was possible for a *Sudra* to turn into a *Brahmin* by being learned and then carrying on the family legacy as a *Brahmin* itself then no modern narrative or bashing is enough to break this hard truth down. Yes, there were and have always been once-in-a-blue-moon precedences of discrimination, but most of the evidences,foreign accounts of India and surveys indicate otherwise, and the fact that Ancient India as a society lacked caste discrimination seems clear, no matter how many Guhas and Thapars keep shouting, the truth won\'t change this solid fact.\n\nWhat\'s to be noted here is that endogamy among Varna lines and Exogamy among Gotra lines was still persistent since the last 2000 years and should be excluded from what I stated above, in addition, Marriage restrictions across communities are something debatable and I see Varna endogamy (&amp;amp; Gotra based exogamy, because Hinduism prohibits inbreeding) as purely a means established to maintain the stability of our gene pool intact as a community over time.\n\nSo on a concluding note, I would say, that it\'s a plot of the left/liberals to make us demolish our Varna identity with our own hands, [the first stage of subversion has already set in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9TviIuXPSE), and many Hindus have fallen prey to it, don\'t let them tell you otherwise because on their face is a smile, on their lips is a slogan but in their hearts is pure hatred for you and your identity, because when they couldn\'t win, they found their punching bags in the Brahmins/Kshtriya community and invented a hegemonical oppression narrative. Because then again, what is the left without the word "Oppression" in their dictionary and a victim card instead of an Aadhar?\n\nWhat I would like to end with is, let\'s unite as one, as Hindus,but also embrace our glorious past, and do not let go of your identity, if you\'re a Brahmin, say Jai Parshuram proudly, if you\'re a Kshtriya, hail Pratap, Vaishyas,your money still controls most of the modern world today,because what would we be without businessmen? And my *Sudra* mates,remember, the father of our constitution was one of you, a man who, by the way was also an unapologetic Hindu,a very proud one indeed and so is our President today.\n\nEmbrace your identities, embrace the blood of your ancestors and we shall emerge brighter, and don\'t let anyone tell you otherwise and that your identity is regressive, because they aren\'t anything but a wolf in sheep\'s clothing waiting to pounce on you and your ideals, because once you and I, my Hindu Friend let go of our identity and pride for our bloodline, we will not have a shield, a sense of belongingness and commune for each other anymore.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n*May Dharma prevail for eternity!*\n\n*Hare Krishna!*\n\n*Jai Parshuram!*\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources and References**\n\n1.

<li>Title: 'We all know what is happening in the Mewat region to the minority Hindus. I found a really interesting article about it which I would like to share with you all. Sharing the original article too in the comments. Please do read this article. It explains why these things are happening in Mewat'<br />Body: '\xa0Nuh is different from the rest of Haryana because of its religious demography. While Muslims constitute 7.06 per cent of the State&rsquo;s population (as per Census, 2011), they constitute 75 per cent of the district. As per the 1971 census, the Muslims constituted 62 per cent of the population in the five tehsils that now form Nuh. This reversal of the majority-minority relationship has had its consequences, particularly in the polarised context prevailing in the rest of the country. That&rsquo;s why Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar declared that his Government would bring a law against forced conversions and set up a board to protect Hindu properties.\n\nThe Mewat district was renamed as Nuh in 2016. Earlier in 2001, Mewat (1,507 sq km) was carved out from Gurgaon district. Nuh has been in the news for the wrong reasons. Mewati gangs are notorious for **cattle smuggling, automobile thefts and highway robberies**. Jails in Gurugram and Faridabad districts have a disproportionate number of Mewati inmates. **Terror suspects have been arrested from Nuh**. There have been reports of communal disturbances.\n\nYet things need not have played out like this. The Meo Muslims were a different lot; they were more or less Hindu in custom and culture until the beginning of the 20th century. Their syncretism could have been an example for the rest of the Muslims of the subcontinent. Major Percy William Powlett wrote about the Meos of Alwar (then a princely State) in Alwar Gazetteer (1878). He said: &ldquo;The Meos are half-Hindu by their habits. Mosques are rarely to be seen in their villages. There are only eight mosques in the 50 villages of the tehsil of Tijarah. Leaving aside the temples, the places of worship of the Meos are very much similar to those of Hindu neighbours. They are known, for instance, as Paanch Peera, Baisa and Chahand.&rdquo;\n\nMewat, as a historical region, extends into Alwar and Bharatpur districts of Rajasthan and Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh beyond its heartland, that is Nuh. One has to cross the region while going to either Agra or Jaipur from Delhi. It lies at the heart of the &ldquo;golden triangle&rdquo; tourist circuit comprising Delhi, Agra and Jaipur.\n\nIt is barely known to the outsiders how this region, merely 70-80 km away from Delhi, acted as the laboratory of Islamic alienation over the last century. Maulana Mohammad Ilyas (1885-1944), who started the itinerant Tabligh movement (Tablighi Jama&rsquo;at), chose Mewat as its nursery in the 1920s. The movement has been run from its headquarters in the Banglewali Masjid in the Nizamuddin area of Delhi. Since Maulana Ilyas was a product of Dar-ul-Uloom at Deoband (in fact, a pet student of its co-founder Ahmed Rashid Gangohi), the imprint of its orthodoxy is evident in the Tabligh movement.\n\nTabligh is an outreach movement by Muslim missionaries to take authentic Islam to the doorsteps of the believers. It encourages nominal Muslims (Momin) to become true Muslims (Ihsaan/Muhsin). The process involves disavowal of all &ldquo;Kafiresque&rdquo; (that is not sanctioned by Islam) practices, which might be the legacy of the pre-Islamic past. The recital of six Kalimas (six verses of Quran) and performing namaaz form the foundation of Tablighi practices. The six Kalimas are avowals that there is &ldquo;no God but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.&rdquo; The sixth Kalima is especially a rejection of disbelief and polytheism. The Kalimas constitute disavowal of associating Allah with any other divine authority. Naturally, syncretism is not merely out of place, but sinful, to be practised alongside Islam.\n\nWay back in 1970, Hashim Amir Ali, Director, Rural Institute, Jamia Millia Islamia, had, by examining the features of the movement, stated that the &ldquo;institution of Tabligh has begun to blow a wind of change for the worse in the hitherto tranquil and uniquely syncretic culture of the Meos&rdquo; (The Meos of Mewat: Old Neighbours of New Delhi, P.41). Ali feared that orthodoxy, championed by Tabligh, would be ruinous for the economic life of the Meos. The religious injunction against interest might discourage them from accepting loans from banks, opening bank accounts or even joining cooperative societies. It might be remembered that Dar-ul-Uloom at Deoband has pronounced several fatwas against any kind of borrowing/lending which involves payment of interest. It is high time that fresh sociological studies are undertaken to ascertain how far the Islamic prohibitions on certain issues (like interest on lending/borrowing and family planning methods) have kept the Muslim community backward and impoverished.\n\nThe result of the Tabligh movement manifested during the tumultuous times of 1946-47 when a popular demand for a **separate &ldquo;Meostan&rdquo; was raised**. Interestingly, it was pitched by the **Communist leader Kunwar Mohammed Ashraf**. Its boundaries were envisaged as extending from Mehrauli in Delhi to Bandikui in Dausa district of Rajasthan. The Meos of Alwar and Bharatpur had formed the Rajputana Muslim League. One of its sections was determined to achieve Meostan, envisaged as adjacent to Pakistan, by the power of guns. This naturally culminated in a riotous situation where Meos suffered heavy losses due to the Hindu backlash. Narayan Bhaskar Khare, the Congressman who was then the Dewan of the Alwar State, had described the situation in detail in his memoirs (My Political Memoirs or Autobiography, 1959).\n\nHowever, Lord Mountbatten&rsquo;s Partition declaration, dated June 3, 1947, which stipulated the division of both Punjab and Bengal, knocked out the plan for a Meostan. **Beleaguered, a large number of Meos fled to Pakistan but only to be invited back to India by the Jawaharlal Nehru Government**. **Stopping them from migrating to Pakistan also became an article of faith for Mahatma Gandhi**. Khare, therefore, was not certain that permanent peace had returned to Mewat. He was apprehensive that communalism could still rear its ugly head. Time has vindicated Khare as the discontent continues to simmer.'<br />Author: 'Meet_Me_In_Heaven'<br />id: 'kwztk1' &nbsp;num_comments: 5 &nbsp;score: 1</li>

I think Modi is our last hope. If somehow the opposition manages to defeat him in 2024, all hope will be lost for us.\n\nOne thing is we can do is turn more and more \'liberals\' into nationalists.

<li>Title: 'Massacre, Election and a group of amnesic people. The Stockholm syndrome of East Bengali refugees: My perspective'<br />Body: "I have tried to keep it as short and to the point as possible so that it does not become boring for you guys. \n\nThe 2019 Lok Sabha election was a clear indication that BJP is going to the possible contender for winning 2021 Assembly election. The whole North Bengal, western Bengal and Bangladesh border areas of Nadia district has given BJP a clear mandate, paving way for BJP's inroad in West Bengal Assembly.\n\nInterestingly, the Kolkata and sub-urban area has remained almost untouched by BJP while TMC has retained its stronghold. The middle bengal (Birbhum and Murshidabad) however has been easier for TMC due to large Muslim population, despite having oldest RSS presence in this part of WB.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n[Parliament seat distribution 2019](https://preview.redd.it/koslg5360p961.jpg?width=1199&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=40ff610b6e81513631f8bc8c273153d1086a2cd7)\n\nEast Bengali Hindu refugees have been settling mostly in the Kolkata and sub-urban part. CPIM did a great job convincing them to be their vote bank. Remember, Jyoti Basu (CM for 23 years) was a East Bengali refugee. Despite committing atrocities and mass murder of refugees they whitewashed them and did not allow the facts to come out in public. All the history of atrocities has remained only in the private life of individuals who suffered. Its a very strange factor that they don't want to remember the atrocities that has been caused upon them. They just want to move on and not speak about them. Unless there is a long sustaining tradition of keeping the stories alive, we forget and make the same mistakes again and again and again. Ayodhya has been able to celebrated Diwali after 492 years. Because They kept the stories alive.\n\nThe East Bengali voter base has switched towards TMC, which is why BJP is yet to gain a mandate in this area. You will probably never find another group of people that has forgotten atrocities that has been committed on them by Muslims and communists. We have studied in the leftist education system. So imagine how much whitewashing and indoctrination has been done through school education. Also, recruiting teachers from party cadre base has been a common feature of CPIM and TMC. So we have been indoctrinated by our curriculum, our teachers, even our religious institutes spread the non sense of Sarv dharm Badapav. Probably I was lucky that I grew up in a sanghi household and studied in a cultural environment.\n\nProbably everyone of us have been taught from childhood not to speak about politics in public. The red terror of CPIM is so ingrained in the Bengali psyche that it is taking time to come out of that. Due to the Neo-cultural renaissance of Hindutva, availability of information (Thank you Jio, democracy owes you a lot) and inter connectivity due to Social Media a new batch of assertive Hindus are emerging. We may be Aastik, we may be Nastik, we may be vegeterian or non-vegeterian, we may be Shakta or Shaiva or Vaishnav or nirishwarvadi, but we all are proud of our culture, our heroes and our heritage. \n\nBharat mata ki Jay."<br />Author: 'Straight_Razor007'<br />id: 'krlmub' &nbsp;num_comments: 16 &nbsp;score: 1</li>

Indira Gandhi was totally against the CIA (obvious her being sponsored by KGB), she sent a letter to the then PM of Sri Lanka, Bandarnaike, attaching fake/forged CIA documents and planted articles in the Indian Newspapers by the KGB.

Predictably, some conspiracy theorists were later to argue that the guards had been working for the CIA. Though the Centre probably did not originate this conspiracy theory, attempting to implicate the Agency in the assassination of Mrs Gandhi became one of the chief priorities of KGB active measures in India over the next few years.\n\nIt was also revealed that &nbsp;The Soviets supplied clandestine money to the Congress and individual politicians, with up to 40% of Indira Gandhi&rsquo;s parliamentarians receiving political contributions from Moscow, a recently declassified CIA says, mirroring similar assertions in highly classified KGB records leaked in 2005.\n\n The CIA report dated December 1985, on the prevailing Soviet influence in India, is heavily redacted but says that Moscow was deeply involved in the Indian political process through covert contributions to parties and individuals. &nbsp;\n\n\n &ldquo;As many as 40% Congress MPs in Mrs Gandhi&rsquo;s last government had received Soviet political contributions,&rdquo; the report titled &ldquo;The Soviets in India&rdquo; reads, adding that &ldquo;the Soviet embassy maintains a large reserve of rupees for various uses &mdash; including clandestine payments to Congress politicians.&rdquo; &nbsp;\n\n\n The CIA report was similar to claims in a 2005 book by former KGB operative Vasili Mitrokhin who smuggled thousands of secret documents out from the Soviet Union. The documents claimed that Indira Gandhi was sent money in suitcases for the Congress party and the KGB had funded election campaigns of former defence minister VK Krishna Menon, besides four other Union ministers in the 1970s. &nbsp;\n\n\n The CIA documents accessed by ET allege Soviets provided kickbacks to the Congress party through arrangements with Indian businessmen. It also named the CPI and CPM as major benefactors of Soviet funding. &ldquo;Soviet funding reaches the two Communist parties, the CPI and CPM through a combination of kickback schemes, normal business transactions and direct cash payments,&rdquo; the report said. &nbsp;\n\n\n The CIA&rsquo;s assessment then was that the funding by the KGB gave ready access to many leaders and helped Moscow influence Indian policies. In the leaked KGB papers revealed by Mitrokhin too, India is described as a model of the KGBs infiltration in third world governments, with scores of sources across the government. &nbsp;\n\n\n Or as the Telegraph describes the Mitrokhin Archive leaks from the former Soviet spy, "Even the Soviets were amazed by the workings of the INC, It seemed as if the whole country was up for sale."\n\nSource :[Documents reveal Nehru govt shared information on Netaji\'s family with MI5](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/documents-reveal-nehru-govt-shared-information-on-netaji-s-family-with-mi5/story-ITBOB2mIlEXIDe8YdJoITL.html)\n\nSource: [Why Did the Government Spy on Netaji&rsquo;s Kin for More Than Two Decades?](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-did-the-government-spy-on-netajis-kin-for-more-than-two-decades)\n\nSource: [Nehru spied on Bose family for 20 years, declassified papers reveal](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-3032682/Nehru-spied-Bose-family-20-years-Declassified-papers-reveal-IB-snooped-family-s-letters-followed-tracked-visitors.html)\n\nSource: [Historical currency converter with official exchange rates from 1953](https://fxtop.com/en/historical-currency-converter.php?A=1&amp;amp;C1=RUB&amp;amp;C2=INR&amp;amp;DD=17&amp;amp;MM=08&amp;amp;YYYY=1971&amp;amp;B=1&amp;amp;P=&amp;amp;I=1&amp;amp;btnOK=Go!)\n\nSource: India&rsquo;s biggest cover-up\n\nSource: The Mitrokhin Archives I and II ([https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/collection/52/mitrokhin-archive](https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/collection/52/mitrokhin-archive))\n\nSource: [Secret government papers raise mystery of Netaji\'s missing treasure](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-3082358/Mystery-Netaji-s-missing-treasure-Secret-government-papers-reveal-Nehru-told-Bose-s-missing-war-chest-100kg-gold-jewels-former-PM-failed-order-probe.html)\n\nSource : [http://netajipapers.gov.in](http://netajipapers.gov.in/)\n\n[https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/the-kgb-papers-it-seemed-like-the-entire-country-was-for-sale/cid/1023636](https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/the-kgb-papers-it-seemed-like-the-entire-country-was-for-sale/cid/1023636)\n\nSource:[https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP86T00586R000400490007-7.pdf](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP86T00586R000400490007-7.pdf) (CIA Source,open at your own discretion)'<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'krkmzq' &nbsp;num_comments: 20 &nbsp;score: 1</li>
<li>Title: 'The Purbiya Brahmins : A Short Military history'<br />Body: 'Throughout the history of the Indian subcontinent, many warrior peoples have graced the landscape and have established their hegemony in the regional military labour market. Indeed, the Marathas themselves, before carving out an autonomous territory for themselves, found profitable employment in the armies of the Bahmani Sultanate, the Vijaynagar Empire, the Deccani Successor Sultanates and eventually the Mughal Empire.\n\n\n\nAmong these many groups, one rose to prominence at the dawn of the 1st millennium AD, and remained on of the most dominant mercenary and landholding groups in the Northern half of the Subcontinent. These were the Purbiyas. The term itself, means the "Easterners" yet, the majority of these men came from Awadh, Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Baksar region. Hence, they were technically part of the North Western Frontier. \n\n\n\nRecruitment :\n\n\n\nThe Purbiyas were recruited from among the Kanyakubja and Bhumihar Brahmins of Awadh, Bhojpuri and Baksar regions as well as the Rajputs of these regions.\n\n\n\nThe process of recruitment itself is shrouded in the fog of history, but what we do know, is that the strong caste affiliations of the Kanyakubja and Bhumihars, allowed them to acquire employment in large numbers in Medieval Armies. The local Brahmin and Rajput zamindars, recruited men from within the Kanyakubja, Bhumihar and to a lesser extent the Rajputs clans and presented these levies to the Nawabs, Subehadar or Imperial recruiters themselves and assured their participation in the coming campaigns at a cost, which would be the combined salary of the soldiers and would also be used to pay for their equipment, if they didn\'t bring their own.\n\n\n\nUnlike the eastern Hindu warrior caste of Rajputana\'s Rajputs who were famous for their cavalry charges and skills on the saddle, the Purbiya Brahmins gained recognition as reliable infantry troops and dragoon-type troops.\n\n\n\nWith the introduction of gunpowder in warfare, these Brahmins, who were in close proximity to sources of saltpeter, which was essential for gunpowder production, became renowned as musketeers and dragoons.\n\n\n\n\nWe find massive contingents of Purbiyas beung recruited in the armies of Marwar, Nawabs of Awadh, the rulers of Malwa and Rajputana, the Mughal Emperors and eventually the East India Company.\n\n\n\nWe find that once their military traditions were established by the 17th century, English and Mughal officials noted, how the Brahmin youth would be sent into a "tiger tank" where he would only be allowed to emerge out once he had slain the beast, being reborn as a "fearless warrior".\n\n\n\nThis recruitment drive from Malwa saw the large influx of Purbiya soldiers into the region. Many of the local chieftains in Malwa depended heavily on Purbiya soldiers such as Silhadi who eventually became known as a Purbiya himself. The presence of Purbiya mercenaries in Gujarat are referenced in 16th and 17th century Persian chronicles including many Purbiya gunners serving in the army of Bahadur Shah of the Gujarat Sultanate in 1535.\n\n\n\nPrior to 1857, the British East India Company preferred to recruit Purbiya Brahmins, who they designated as "The military arm of the Brahmin caste" , or simply "Easterners". The Bengal Army of the East India Company preferred to recruit its sepoys from the Brahmins of Awadh and Bihar, in part because they had an average height of 5\'8", an important consideration in an army that valued impressive appearance amongst its soldiers.\n\n\n\nWe find that during the 17th and 18th centuries, until the revolt of 1857, these Brahmins held a monopoly in the Bengal Army. Between 1814-1815, Brahmins constituted roughly 42% of the Bengal Army, while the Rajputs were roughly 34% and the remainder were Ahirs, Jats and Muslims.\n\n\n\nTheir Own Kingdom :\n\n\n\nWhile the Purbiya Brahmins had been great zamindars and landholders in the Medieval period in the Awadh and Bhojpur and Baksar region, their aspirations for autonomy would find expression in the rise of the Narayan Dynasty and the emergence of the King of Benares. \n\n\nMost of the area currently known as Varanasi was acquired by Mansa Ram, a zamindar of Utaria. His son Balwant Singh, the ruler of Utaria in 1737,took over the Jagirs of Jaunpur, Varanasi, and Chunar, in 1737 from the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah of Delhi . Other places under the kingship of Kashi Naresh were Chandauli, Gyanpur, Chakia, Latifshah, Mirzapur, Nandeshwar, Mint House and Vindhyachal. With the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Kanyakubja and Bhumihars Brahmins under the leadership of Kashi Naresh strengthened their sway in the area south of Avadh and in the fertile rice growing areas of Benares, Jaunpur, Gorakhpur, Basti, Deoria, Azamgarh, Ghazipur, Ballia and Bihar and on the fringes of Bengal. \n\n\n\nThe strong clan organisation of the Purbiya Brahmins, brought success to the Kings of Benares .There were as many as 100,000 Brahmins backing the power of the Benares rajas in the districts of Benares, Gorakhpur and Azamgarh. This proved a decisive advantage when the dynasty faced a rival and the nominal suzerain, the Nawab of Oudh, in the 1750s and the 1760s. An exhausting guerrilla war, waged by the Benares ruler against the Oudh camp, using his troops, forced the Nawab to withdraw his main force. The region eventually ceded by the Nawab of Oudh to the Company Rule in India in 1775, who recognized Benares as a family dominion. Benares became a princely state in 1911. \n\n\nTheir Decline :\n\n\n\nThe Purbiya units of the Bengal Army played a major role in the Indian Rebellion of 1857 against the British. Mangal Pandey, a notable figure during the start of the mutiny, was a Purbiya serving in the 34th Bengal Native Infantry. Following the suppression of the uprising, British authorities decided not to recruit troops from the eastern plains, and the new Bengal Army was to be recruited primarily from the Sikh and Muslim communities of the Punjab.\n\n\n\nWe find that the vilification and vitriol that the British held for the "Pandies" gained more ground and began with a religious fervor post this period as they felt that the Brahmins were among the greatest threats to their rule.\n\n\n\nHence, the most influential and sought after mercenaries/zamindars/martial race of the medieval period, lost their prominence, until the first and second World Wars, when the war demanded more men and finally the Purbiyas were recruited in greater proportions once again.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\n\nThe Purbiyas were excellent soldiers and this &nbsp;was evident in the fact that they were recruited from the times of Rana Sanga to the Revolt of 1857, in almost any army, that wanted a reliable and proficient infantry component.\n\n\n\nIt was their string caste affiliation that brought them recruitment, regional autonomy and influence.\n\n\n\nYet, it was this very caste affiliation, that sprouted within them the roots of rebellion, when the English threatened their caste, their race, their identity. Hence, the Purbiyas set the company ablaze and were the main driving force behind the First Indian War of Independence. And while they did not gain independence, they forced the end of the Company rule, decades before it would have.\n\n\n\nTheir struggle also inspired many more generations to come, to take up the gun and purge colonial rule with iron and blood.\n\n\n\nThese valiant blood-brothers and descendants of Lord Parshuram, hold a special place in Indian military history and since they are often ignored, I felt this as a good opportunity to tell their tale.\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\nSources :\n\n\n\n"Peasants fighting for a living in early modern North India" by Dirk H.A Kolf\n\n\n\nNaukar, Rajput, and Sepoy: The Ethnohistory of the Military Labour Market of Hindustan, 1450-1850 by Dirk H.A Kolf\n\n\n\nRecruiting, Drafting, and Enlisting: Two Sides of the Raising of Military Forces by Peter Karsten\n\n\n\nA Matter of Honour by Philip Mason'<br />Author: 'PushyamitraShunga1st'<br />id: 'kq4tn8' &nbsp;num_comments: 36 &nbsp;score: 1</li>

<li>Title: 'The Gupta Age (300 - 500 AD)'<br />Body: '# History often Repeats Itself.\n\nJust like Chandragupta Maurya had founded the Mauryan Dynasty in 320BC, just so did a Chandragupta find the Gupta dynasty in 320 AD. He is often referred to as **Chandragupta I**\n\nJust like Chandragupta Maurya, Chandragupta I had the misfortune of being upstaged by a more illustrious successor - **Samudragupta**.\n\n**Earlier Guptas**\n\nChandragupta\'s father was **Ghatotakacha Gupta** and his grandfather was **Sri Gupta**. Not much is known about these two. Sri Gupta built a temple for Chinese Buddhists who would come to tour the sites associated with Buddha.\n\n**Chandragupta I**\n\nHis territory stretched along the Ganga from Magadha (Southern Bihar) to Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh. It\'s not known how he conquered Magadha. It may have come to him as a marriage settlement. Kumaradevi, his chief queen was a descendant of the Licchavi rajas who were defeated by Ajatashatru 700 years ago.\n\n**Samudra-Gupta**\n\nThe most famous of the Guptas. He came to the throne in 335 AD and died in 380 AD. Long lists of kings and regions were subdued by the prowess of his arm in battle.\n\nThe first campaign led Samudra-Gupta to the west where he uprooted kingdoms in Bareilly and Mathura regions of what is now Uttar Pradesh and in neighboring Rajasthan. They were incorporated in the Gupta Kingdom.\n\nNext he headed south down the eastern seaboard and elbowed aside a dozen more rivals. He turned back only after capturing Vishnugopa, the Pallava kingdom of Kanchipuram (near Madras).\n\nFurther campaigns in the north saw Gupta forces overrunning most of Bengal, exterminating independent republics like of the Yaudheyas west of Delhi, and establishing Gupta Rule throughout the ancient Aryavarta (The land of UP, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and eastern parts of Rajasthan and Punjab). This became the core region of the Guptas.\n\nNow indisputably "The unconquered conqueror of unconquered kings", Samudra-Gupta stood on the threshold of a pan-Indian empire.\n\n**The Guptas annex the Western Satraps**\n\nRama Gupta briefly succeeded Samudra-Gupta and attempted to uproot the Western Satraps in Malwa. But he was defeated. The price of surrender was to surrender his queen to them. The lust filled Shaka Satrap wanted the queen for himself and Rama Gupta conceded defeat and agreed to hand her over. However his lust would lead to his own downfall.\n\nRama Gupta\'s brother infiltrated the enemy\'s camp dressed as Queen Dhruvadevi, and promptly slew the Satrap. After the disgrace of Rama Gupta, it was his righteous brother who became the next emperor of the Gupta Dynasty, known to us as **Chandragupta II**. He may have had to kill Rama Gupta in the process, and then eventually he claimed the hand of Dhruvadevi.\n\nChandragupta II\'s main offensive was against the Shaka Satraps. By the year 409 the Shaka territories of the Western Satraps were annexed by the Guptas, and the western Satraps were heard of no more.\n\nSuccess against the Satraps gave the Guptas access to the ports of Gujarat and to the profits of it\'s international maritime trade. There and throughout central India, the Guptas became involved with the Vakatakas, the dynasty which succeeded the Satavahanas as the dominant force in the deccan.\n\nThe Cultural Achievements of the Gupta Empire flourished during Chandragupta II\'s reign.\n\n**Alliance with the Vakatakas**\n\nThe Guptas formed a dynastic alliance with the Vakatakas. Chandragupta II\'s daughter was betrothed to Rudrasena II, the Vakataka king. The latter soon died and the ensuing regency (490 - 410 AD) was controlled by **Prabhavati**, the Gupta Queen, who as regent controlled the Vakataka state in accordance with Gupta policy.\n\nChandragupta II, like his predecessor Samudra-Gupta and his successor Kumara-Gupta, reigned for about 40 years. Such longevity for 3 generations is exceptional and must have been an important factor in the stability of the Gupta Rule.\n\n**Kumara-Gupta**\n\nKumara-Gupta ruled from 415-455 AD. In his reign there was one major uprising by one Pushyamitra in Malwa. It ruined the fortunes of the Gupta Family. Soon after there appeared on the scene foreign invaders in the form of the Hunas, a branch of the Hiung-nu of Chinese history and the Huns of European history.\n\nAn offshoot of this horde, the Epthalites of White Huns had established themselves in Bactria in the late 4th century. In the mid fifth century they followed their Kushana predecessors across the Hindu Kush and into Gandhara, and they pushed east against the Guptas.\n\n**Skanda-Gupta**\n\nFortunately, the Guptas produced a champion in the form of Skanda-Gupta, the son of Kumara Gupta. He took the field successively against Pushyamitra. He then made good a doubtful claim to succeed his father, and finally repulsed the Huns.\n\nSkanda-Gupta and his son, both paragons of virtue, built a massive embankment when Rudraman\'s reservoir was in turn overwhelmed by floodwaters, where they also built a temple.\n\n**Later Guptas**\n\nAfter the death of Skanda-Gupta in 467 AD, his nephew Budha-Gupta, then another nephew, his son and then his grandson succeeded the throne well into the 6th century.\n\nBut their reigns were mostly brief and by 510 AD, other Guptas, who may or may not have been related to them, opted as independent rulers within the core area of the erstwhile empire.\n\nIn that year, the Huns led by a formidable leader Toramana, were again on the move. They overran Kashmir and Punjab and defeated a Gupta army near Gwalior, thus extending their rule to Malwa.\n\nThus the Golden Age of the Guptas eventually came to an end.'<br />Author: 'horrorlover2'<br />id: 'km1614' &nbsp;num_comments: 2 &nbsp;score: 1</li>

<li>Title: 'Ahmad Shah Abdali, the prelude to Panipat'<br />Body: '(Here it is bois. I asked you guys to vote and it was a tie between those who wanted this post and those who didn\'t. So I\'ve decided to make this post today. This is the second last post before the analysis of the 3rd Battle of Panipat. Enjoy)\n\n\n\nAhmad Abdali, was born in the Sadozai clan of the Abdali tribe of Afghans in about 1722 CE. After having defeated the Russians and the Turks, Nadir Shah of Iran, had set out of Iran to punish the Afghans for their actions. During his invasions in 1732 CE, he captured two boys, brothers, Zulfiqar and Ahmad. Ahmad, distinguished himself in Nadir\'s service, quickly becoming a favourite and rose to the command of 3000 troopers in Nadir\'s personal guard. He was with Nadir Shah when Nadir invaded Delhi. It is said that Nizam-ul-mulk who was known to read faces, said when he saw Ahmad Abdali, that he would one day be a king. When Nadir Shah was assassinated by his own trusted advisors, Abdali, took Nadir\'s seal, the Koh-i-Noor, valuables and a Mughal princess who was married to Nadir\'s son. He left for Afghanistan and took his troopers and many other Afghans with him, who elected him as their leader. And so, upon a Throne of dirt, with a crown of strewn grass, Ahmad Abdali, was made Ahmad Shah Abdali of Afghanistan. The Abdalis styled him Durrani Padshah or Pearl Among Kings and called themselves henceforth, Durranis. \n\n\n\n\nHe had claimed for himself, the provinces of the Mughal Empire that Nadir Shah had conquered which included Qandahar, Kabul, Peshwar, Lahore, Sindh, Ghazni, Hazara, Kohat, Bannu, Derajay, Qalat and Chahar Mahal. \n\n\n\nHe began his conquests for these provinces by taking Sindh. The Mughals sent an army under Safdar Jung of Awadh, and Ishwari Sigh of Jaipur. In the Battle of Manupur, Ishwari Singh disgraced his Rajput name and pride, by fleeing the field in the face of enemy fire and left Safdar Jung to struggle alone. Here the Nawab of Awadh proved that he was a patriot once again, and fought the battle bravely, his Awadhi troops consisting largely of Brahmin and Rajputs in infantry and Irani Shia cavalry, defeated the Afghans. Yet, the Mughals failed to take advantage of victory and allowed Nadir to slip away.\n\n\n\nWe now skip a few years ahead, to discuss his fourth invasion of India. This invasion was at the invitation of Najib-ud-Daulah and the Mughal Emperor\'s wife, as they were offended by Imad-ul-Mulk and invited Abdali to suppress him. Therefore, he had the opportunity to do what he had always desired. In January 1757, he was in Ludhiana, with Imad chastised, his troops went plundering and sacking cities mercilessly. They dragged away men\'s wives and daughters, so cruelly, that a large number of them committed suicide. Hindus were ordered to paint their foreheads and were beaten for failing to do so.\n\n\n\nNajib-ud-Daulah joined his forces with Abdali and with about 100,000 troops, they set out on their expedition to suppress Surajmal who had refused to surrender in person. On this occasion, Surajmal\'s pride would cost him and innocent people alike. Jahan Khan and Najib-ud-Daulah were sent out with 20,000 troops each, and another 20,000 marched under Abdali. They planned to make the the festival of Holi, their time of attack, to inflict the greatest offences upon their enemy. So they set out on 27th of February and planned an expedition which would last till 6th of March. \n\n\n\n\nIn Bulandshahr, a general slaughter was ordered and according to an eye witness account of Ghulam Hasan Samin, "unnumbered dead bodies flooded the streets".\n\n\n\nAt Mathura, Jawahir Singh, Surajmal\'s son, opposed them with 10,000 men but after killing 8000 Afghans and losing 4000 Jats, he returned to Ballabhgard. Once again we have an eye witness account of Ghulam Hassan - " I saw a number Bairagi and Sanyasi huts by the edge of the stream. These are ascetics of the Hindu faith. In each hut lay a severed head, with the head of a cow tied to its mouth by a rope around it\'s neck."\n\n\n\nAt Ballabhgard, the fort was captured and Jawahir Singh escaped to Kumbher where Surajmal was. Ghulam Hassan once again gives his account -" Horsemen set out with 10-20 horses each at midnight. They return with plunder and women captives atop the plunder. Male captives carry baskets on their heads, which have bundles of severed heads in them. For each head the Prime Minister pays Rs.5. Then the male captives are beheaded and the women ravished, whose screams deafen the ears of civilised men."\n\n\n\nAt Brindaban Ghulam narrates "At one place, 200 children lay dead in a heap"\n\n\n\nAt Gokul, "4000 Naga Sadhus, fought the Abdalis and each side lost 2000 men." At the behest of Jugal Kishore, &nbsp;an agent of the Bengal Viceroy, who assured the Shah that there were only beggars and Sadhus in Gokul, Gokul Nath temple and its people were saved.\n\n\n\nAt Brindaban, the Afghans had encamped by the Jamuna, downstream from Brindaban. The water was choked due to dead bodies and the polluted water caused cholera in the Afghan camp and hence the Afghans retreated.\n\n\n\n\nOn his return, he sacked Delhi, took a 16 year old Mughal princess and her sister as wives. Along with 16 other women from the imperial harem.\n\n\n\n\nBefore returning to Afghanistan, he conquered Sarhind in 1757 and finally went back.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1758, Adina Beg Khan, Mughal Governor of Jalandhar Doab, allied with the Sikhs to push the Afghans out of Punjab. He then realised that soon the Durrani would invade once more and invited, the Marathas who were encamped at Delhi. Raghunath Rao accepted the offer and set out with a grand army. \n\n\n\n\n\nAnd hence, Raghunath Rao arrived to liberate Punjab and the west with Malharrao Holkar, Sakharam Bapu, Manaji Paygude, Gangadhar Bajirao, Hari Raghunath Bhide, Bapuji Trimbak, Renako Anaji, Gopalrao Ganesh Barve, Rayaji Sahdev, Tukoji Scindia, Narsoji Pandit, Khandoji Kadam and Vithal Shivdeo, assaulted any and all Afghans they encountered between Delhi and Attock. They took back Peshwar, Multan, Sarhind, Punjab and Lahore. Glorious celebrations were held and bazaars were offered to Raghunath Rao. Finally, the stage was set, for the Third Battle of Panipat. Soon, Najib-ud-Daulah would invite Abdali, to invade once more, for loot and land. Dattaji Scindia, would be slain and the great battle would be fought.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next post shall be my last in this series. Thanks for staying tuned and wait until I finish with the next one. I know I could make more posts by providing more and more context, but that would be too exhaustive and I\'m very eager to cover the Battle itself. \n\n\n\n\n\nSources : "Marathas and Panipat" by Hari Ram Gupta\n\n\n\n"Ahmad Shah Abdali in India, Islamic Culture" and "Fall of Mughal Empire Vol I and II"by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n\n\n" History of The Jats" by K.R Qanungo\n\n\n\n"Tarikh-e-Ahmad Shah" by Imad-ul-din-al-Husaini'<br />Author: 'PushyamitraShunga1st'<br />id: 'kflh06' &nbsp;num_comments: 45 &nbsp;score: 12</li>

Yeah, it might help the trains safer, more hygenic and whatnot but nobody can deny the fact that the ticket pricing is gonna be too high. It is easily the most viable mode of transport for the lower middle class and now they probably cannot afford it anymore. Spending taxpayer money on Statue of Unity, the new parliament and whatever else. I mean, the cost of building this shit is probably not so astronomical and most of it is probably now in some politician and his builder buddy's pocket, but thats how this country has operated for a long time and its not gonna change anytime soon. Instead of draining that kind of money on the statue or whatever, i feel like they could have done a lot more good if they just stuck to building a hospital or a school or heck, even help ISRO with its future missions (thanks, Mission Mangal). The whole Pakistan rhetoric: Everyone who criticizes the government is labelled anti-national, tukde-tukde or whatever and their image is tarnished by Republic TV and the others. (No, Republic is not neutral). They are also advised to go to Pakistan because clearly you are not allowed to stay in this country if you don't support the ruling party.\n\nCONGRESS:\n\nI mean its caste and religion based politics has now done enough to destroy the country. I can't imagine how this country could have been if Nehru and is descendants would have atleast tried to develop the country instead of focusing on making sure that there is steady flow of money to their pockets and that they cover up all the wrongdoings and scams that have plagued most of their reign( since the late 80s atleast). These dumbfucks are still trying to project Pappu as a mass leader and the party's face on the sole privilage of having a PM daddy (and granny and great-granddaddy). Clearly that plan is not working and they are probably gonna fade out of existence by the end of this decade.\n\nMAHAGATHBANDHAN:\n\nI mean who the hell let this bunch of illiterate bunch of school bullies become national leaders (Arvind Kejriwal is an exception: He is smart and knows how to avoid letting the public see his hindutva self, while letting them realize it). Mayawati is a crazy bitch who had Lucknow laden with elephants when she had CM post. Akhilesh and his father are a bunch of patriarchal cunts who don't want to condemn rape, Lalu and his family needs no introduction in field of crime or politics and Didi is a genuine psycopath. Down south we have confused Kumaraswamy who doesn't know whether he likes the BJP or not and Shiv Sena has an extremely violent brand of hindutva."<br />Author: 'ketchupwithchocolate'<br />id: 'kb6t16' &nbsp;num_comments: 2 &nbsp;score: 1</li>
<li>Title: 'This needs to be said and people need to know'<br />Body: '1946 provincial election took place for the assemblies of British Indian provinces. These assemblies were to elect the members of constituent assembly. Separate electorate concept was implemented in the elections. Means, Muslims were to have their own separate represention in Muslim majority seats of each province. Provinces of then British India, which are now in India were:\nBengal\nPunjab\nBihar\nUP(United Provinces, later Uttar Pradesh)\nBihar\nCP(Central provinces. Today\'s Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh)\nBombay\nMadras\nAssam\nOrissa\nOut of these, Bengal and Punjab were partitioned. Assam\'s Sylhet district became a part of East Pakistan through referendum.\nLet\'s consider UP. In 1946 elections, 66 seats were declared Muslim seats and out of them 54 were won by Muslim League, which is roughly 82%. 1941 census report says, Muslim population in UP was 8,416,308. Very clearly. Next census took place in 1951. 1951 census report was created statewise. Because by then India had a federal structure. The report of UP doesn\'t directly tell the Muslim population (newly introduced political correctness. Thanks to Congress). It says that total population of Uttar Pradesh is 63,215,742 and Muslims are 14.28% of it, which is calculated to be &nbsp;9,027,208. Provincial Elections were conducted, Muslim League was voted in thumping majority from Muslim seats, India was partitioned, and still the Muslim population in UP didn\'t decrease, instead some how it increased.\nSimilar patterns are observed in census reports of other provinces too. The psychology that created Pakistan still lives with us, right next door. Next time if someone says, "we loved India, that\'s why we didn\'t leave", never trust them even if they swear in the name of Ola or the book of Ola. They didn\'t leave because they couldn\'t. They didn\'t leave, cuz their lives were not as much threatened as the lives of Hindus in Pakistan. But they created Pakistan and they still live with us right next door.

If left to me I won\'t watch the channel and you may differ in ideology but* ***Constitutional courts will have to protect such freedoms...*****"**\n\nHere are point made by Justice Chandrchud,\n\n**1. On the limits of defining "abetment of suicide"**\n\nIt may be recalled that Goswami stands accused of abetting interior designer, Anvay Naik\'s suicide on account of failing to pay dues owed. In this context, Justice Chandrachud queried.\n\n"*We are assuming the allegations of FIR as gospel truth but even then, is a case of Section 306 made out?* ***In a matter like this when some dues was not paid, would a suicide mean abetment? Would it not be a travesty of justice if someone is denied bail for this?***\n\nNoting further that the deceased is stated to have been under mental stress, the Judge also remarked,\n\n"*For Section 306, abetment there needs to be actual incitement. Does one owes money to another and they commit suicide - would it be abetment?"*\n\n**2. Constitutional Courts should protect liberty**\n\nJustice Chandrachud proceeded to remark,\n\n"*If we don\'t interfere in this case today, we will walk on path of destruction. If left to me I won\'t watch the channel and you may differ in ideology but* ***Constitutional courts will have to protect such freedoms...*****"**\n\nThe Judge recounted, during the hearing,\n\n"*A woman was hauled up for a tweet in West Bengal as she criticised the lockdown enforcement. She was issued summons under 41A. Is this fair? This cannot happen.*"\n\nHe added,\n\n"Forget Arnab Goswami for a moment, we are a Constitutional court.... If we as a Constitutional Court do not lay down law and protect liberty, then who will?"*Justice DY Chandrachud*\n\n**3. High Court has not dealt with the basic question**\n\nJustice Chandrachud remarked, on this aspect,\n\n*"****Here, is there an active incitement to suicide? Can you say that it is a case for custodial interrogation?*** *High Court has written 56 pages order but had not dealt with the basic question...* ***was an offence made out prima facie?***\n\n**4. If you don\'t like a channel, don\'t watch it**\n\nThe Court today also witnessed arguments made for Goswami that the case lodged against him was politically motivated in view of reports carried by Republic TV, where he is editor-in-chief.\n\nJustice Chandrachud observed,\n\n"*Victim* (Naik\'s family) *is entitled to recourse as in proper and fair probe. But* ***answer is simple. If you don\'t like a channel then don\'t watch it&hellip;****Government needs to ignore all of this and we don\'t think elections don\'t depend on all this.*\n\n**5. All should be responsible in matters of free speech**\n\nAppearing for the State of Maharashtra, Senior Advocate **Kapil Sibal** pointed out that the freedom of speech and expression is subject to reasonable restrictions.\n\n"*Article 19 (1)(a) is not an absolute right",* Sibal said.\n\nJustice Chandrachud responded,\n\n"*When this matter was before the CJI, CJI said in a subtle way that* ***responsibility is on all the sides."***\n\n**6.

And as such it was a total failure for India and a long term victory for Pakistan.\n\nPakistan surrendered in Bengal. Not in punjab. We did not even make the return of PoK as a condition of ending the war. We did not impose any economic or military sanctions on West Pakistan as a condition of ending the war.\n\nSuch conditions are the perogative of the victor. To ensure that the enemy, in exchange for being spared, has to concede to a number of terms that take away its power to cause trouble for you again.\n\nWe extracted no such concessions. \n\nWe could have demanded that the return of PoK, unlimited access for Indian trade to cross Pakistan to Iran and central Asia, opening up of the Pakistani economy to Indian trade, restriction on the Pakistani military in the number of soldiers, officers, tanks and aircraft it could have, disbanding the Pakistani navy permanently and acknowledgement from Pakistan that Kashmir was an integral part of India, including PoK. \n\nWe did nothing. Nothing. We just ended the war. And gave back 90,000 Pakistani prisoners of war for a worthless agreement that the Kashmir dispute would be solved bilaterally.\n\nWhat the hell was that? If nothing else, we could have ended the Kashmir issue there and then. We didn\'t even do that. \n\nWe just accepted the surrender in east Pakistan and closed the chapter. \n\nBecause the reality is that Indira only wanted enough to establish herself as the iron lady in the minds of Indians. She achieved that. She threw India and its future under the bus. And left Pakistan able and free to acquire nuclear weapons, which ensured we would not get the chance again, not for 50 years, perhaps never, and left Pakistan able to start terrorism campaigns across India, which it did, from punjab to kashmir to SIMI. \n\nAnd now we run around stroking ourselves about our supposedly great "victory".\n\nIt was not a victory. It was a betrayal. And has cost us so heavily that today we are surrounded and besieged internally and externally totally by the intense and devastating terrorist and diplomatic operations that Pakistan has been running against us after we ran away in 1971.\n\nWake up.\n\n*Taken from Harbir Singh\'s Facebook Post*'<br />Author: 'dukegabon'<br />id: 'hkl51a' &nbsp;num_comments: 4 &nbsp;score: 18</li>

So what happen in city /towns and it's surrounding was never effect the villages as they have to gave tax to a fix authority( local landlords) . So major actrocities were done in so called city/town and trade routes of those time and that's why you will see Muslim culture influence mostly limited to urban areas. Muslim where-ever have a strong hold tried to penetrate that self sufficient village structure by forced conversion which was mostly limited to North India that's why castism is still equally present in Muslim because they changed only religion of that self suffcient society that's why presence of Islam in rural India mostly limited to North India or bengal. Muslim doesn't provide any new opportunity. They tried where ever they can try to spread islam forcefully according to their limited capability. They were barbaric Islamic fanatics. We all knew about jajiya tax and not a single 300 old temple in North India.....all the remaing one are either hidden or burried for eg kujrao or sachi stupa.\n\nAlso with partition a population shift happen if we take account the population of Indian subcontinent then our share decrease to 55-60%. As our nation divided on base of religion India was the nation for Hindu. We all knew 95% &amp;amp; 90% majority countries pakistan and bengladesh respetively &nbsp;were once 100% dharmic.

Why are these groups so out of sync with the mood of the people? How could they rush to declare demonetisation a failure, even as a billion ordinary citizens braved long queues and solidly backed the government? Why do they crank up the volume of protest when a Christian church is burgled and vandalised by criminals, but there is deafening silence when Muslim mobs destroy an entire Hindu town in Bengal? When Muslims are attacked for allegedly consuming beef, the cacophony of these groups doesn&rsquo;t end for weeks, but when six Hindu women are gunned down by Kashmiri terrorists during the Amarnath pilgrimage why do they dismiss it in a tweet? Why are they always on the side of forces inimical to India, such as fundamentalist Muslims, evangelistic Christians or communists who are in the pay of the Chinese? Why are they sympathetic to Pakistan, whose raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre is at worst the destruction of India or at best its Islamisation?\n\nYou don&rsquo;t need to be on the inside track of politics or have exhaustive knowledge of the working of the news media to connect the dots.

Here the working of the machinery is greased by cold cash, off-the-book perks, long-term sinecures and free junkets. Here, there is an incestuous relationship between disparate groups such as bureaucrats, journalists, fixers, so-called intellectuals and politicians who reside in an elite space known as Lutyens&rsquo; Delhi.\n#A short history of Lutyens&rsquo; Delhi\nIn 1931 when the British moved India&rsquo;s capital from Kolkata to New Delhi, the city&rsquo;s central administrative area, with its wide avenues, extensive parks and imposing colonial homes was reserved for the empire&rsquo;s bureaucrats. This area came to be known as Lutyens&rsquo; Delhi after its designer Edwin Lutyens. Many of these administrators were little men &ndash; colonialists who descended on India with utter contempt for the people they were going to rule over, not serve. Their only qualification was white skin. In keeping with the general calibre of Englishmen and Scots of those days, they were men of questionable intellect and average to poor skills. However, they were paid obscene amounts of money. Each of these bureaucrats had at least a dozen Indian servants, some had up to 30.\n\nWhen the British hastily retreated in 1947, their rapacious administrators were replaced by a class of Indians derisively described as Macaulayites &ndash; Indians only in name but who were otherwise disconnected from Indian culture and thought. These Indians had inherited all the biases that the British rulers harboured towards Indians. They were the product of Thomas Macaulay&rsquo;s English Education Act of 1835 whose sole purpose was to create a class of people who would assist the British in administering India.\n\nIn almost every country when oppressive rulers or colonisers were overthrown by freedom fighters or revolutionaries, the entire country went through the wringer. The old ways were discarded and new governance followed. This was true of the US in 1776 after the war of independence, in Russia after the 1917 revolution, in China after the 1949 revolution and in Vietnam in 1975 after the Viet Cong defeated the Americans.\n\nIn contrast, nothing changed in India after the hasty British retreat. It was a smooth transition from colonial looters to Congress carpetbaggers. The bureaucracy, which facilitated British loot, now joined the political class in looting nominally free Indians. When the Congress introduced socialism style permits for operating industries, the middlemen moved in. These fixers were soon joined by journalists who realised that their easy access to the political leadership and the bureaucracy could be monetised.\n\nThe nexus between the above groups is so profitable (as I will elaborate further in gory detail) that it is now a virtual cartel. Just like the Sicilian mafia tried to eliminate honest judges and policemen who came after it, the Lutyens mafia will target anyone who tries to stop its freeloading. That is why it is targeting the current political leadership, in particular Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who threatens to end the deeply entrenched loot culture of Lutyens&rsquo; Delhi.\n\nThe award wapsi (returns) drama, beef festivals, the constant drone about intolerance and the manufacturing of fake news to make the current BJP government look like a failure are all a synchronised act by deeply entrenched Lutyens&rsquo; Delhi groups who have been effectively checkmated by Modi and now are desperate to make a comeback. Their 70 year long ride on the gravy train has ended and they want it to continue. They will even seek the support of the foreign media, intelligence agencies, NGOs and religious outfits to keep India down.\n\nIn the following story you will see how Lutyens&rsquo; Delhi operates and why it needs to be checked and neutralised and the nexus completely broken if India is to rise. For, their interests are diametrically opposite to India&rsquo;s. Only by keeping India weak, struggling (if not poor) and in a state of chaos can they continue to leech off the ineffectual nation state.\n#Diplomatic impunity\nThis event took place sometime in the latter half of 2001 at a leading New Delhi-based newspaper. It was a slow night and nothing newsworthy had arrived from the state bureaus. I was the chief copy editor and along with other senior editors, I was scanning the wires for a lead story for the following day&rsquo;s paper. The reality of the news business is that most nights there is nothing interesting happening nationwide, so the media has to spin, or spice up, the news.\n\nBut that particular night we didn&rsquo;t have to resort to spin as the ceasefire broke down on the Line of Control in Jammu &amp;amp; Kashmir and the guns opened up from both sides. However, trading projectiles across the LoC wasn&rsquo;t news. What got our attention was CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour &ndash; the well-known India-hater &ndash; reporting live from Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK). What shocked me and the rest of the journalists on duty was Amanpour&rsquo;s completely one sided reporting &ndash; she was practically frothing at the mouth, alleging that Indian cannons were laying waste to peaceful villages in PoK. Although she was presenting the news as a massive human rights violation, all that the CNN crew could broadcast as evidence was footage of a couple of huts with their roofs blown away, the odd crater and a dead buffalo. Amanpour&rsquo;s neutrality &ndash; and her standard of journalism &ndash; can be judged by the fact that she was flying in a Pakistan Army helicopter accompanied by Pakistan military officers.\n\nAnd now we come to the devious part. After he watched the footage the resident editor (who takes the executive decision) said: &ldquo;Splash it on the front page. Let&rsquo;s expose CNN.&rdquo; For journalists like me &ndash; used to seeing news stories get smothered because of various lobbies at work &ndash; this was great news. We decided to give the story a six-column display that would take up most of the top half of the front page. I&rsquo;d never seen such an expose of the western media in a leading newspaper, so this was going to set one hell of an example, I thought.\n\nI had even come up with a headline for the story: &ldquo;CNN goes ballistic on India at LoC&rdquo;. With barely an hour to go for the presses to start rolling, the Resident Editor came rushing into the news desk. &ldquo;Pull the story, find something else,&rdquo; he said. You can imagine my disappointment when I heard this. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we run the story?&rdquo; I asked.\n\nThe resident editor said: &ldquo;We got a call from Blackwill. He has requested us to not publish the story.&rdquo;\n\nHe was referring to American ambassador Robert Blackwill. It is not known whether the envoy himself had called up the resident editor or if he had directly called the owners of the paper.\n\nNow the thing to note is how on earth did the Americans come to know that our newspaper was going to press with the CNN story? A good guess is they were monitoring the India media in real time via electronic methods. American whistleblower Edward Snowden who defected to Russia revealed in 2013 that India is the fifth most penetrated country by American intelligence agencies. NSA and CIA operatives may have tipped Blackwill off about the PR disaster that was about to hit the US in India.\n\nHowever, a more plausible explanation is that they had an inside man. The one journalist that fit the bill is a senior editor who still works there. He was educated in the US and had even worked at American media outlets. He had become a sort of fixer for the owners by ensuring their family members were always granted American tourist or business visas. This was not a job he enjoyed much, but several times I had heard him speak over the phone, asking that so and so relative&rsquo;s visas be expedited.\n\nWhat aroused my suspicion was that he hung around till late even when his page had gone to press and his presence was not required. He could be seen slowly walking the long aisles, a mobile phone glued to his ear. He would frequently come to the production area, looking at the various screens as he walked past.\n\nThis editor also ensured that nothing too critical was written against the US. In 2011 when an American diplomat disgusted the entire country when she told a group of students in Chennai that after a long train journey her skin became &ldquo;dark and dirty like the Tamils&rdquo;, this editor defended the US diplomat in his blog, saying she did not really mean it. That was a good hint he was a flack for the Americans.\n\nSo here you have a journalist who was clearly operating against India&rsquo;s interests by working for a foreign power. He fits the description of a presstitute, as described by former army chief and current junior external affairs minister V.K. Singh.\n#Pakistan fixation\nBy nature, Indian liberals and leftists are anti-India and anti-Hindu. They conflate caste oppression with Hinduism and are therefore predisposed to hate Hindus. Also, because they are conditioned by Macaulayite education to believe their own country&rsquo;s religion and culture are inferior to the West&rsquo;s, they suffer from a deep inferiority complex. They, therefore, disown India.\n\nBut what explains their affinity for the Islamic madhouse that masquerades as a nation? Pakistan is an Islamic state where Marxism and atheism are considered blasphemous. Indian leftists and the so-called intellectuals will be dragged out and lynched on the streets of Islamabad, Lahore and Peshawar. In India they misuse free speech by attacking Hindu gods and religion, and yet they get away with it. In Pakistan that would not be possible. Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan claim India is intolerant, yet they prosper and thrive in India. Frankly, if they move to Pakistan (and perhaps they should give it a try) and say Pakistan is intolerant, they wouldn&rsquo;t last more than a few hours.\n\nThere is no real mystery to the Indian liberal&rsquo;s Pakistan fixation. It&rsquo;s again about money and junkets. The 2003-04 India-Pakistan cricket series provides an excellent example. No cricket series had been played between the two sides since 1999, and the Kargil War was fresh in people&rsquo;s mind. The nation did not want any sporting contact with Pakistan, but those who had a vested interest in the resumption of cricket matches were parroting the usual line: &ldquo;Cricket should not become a victim of politics.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;cricket unites peoples&rdquo;.\n\nThe debate whether India should tour Pakistan was being played out in the media. At the Delhi-based newspaper where I worked, there was a discussion on what line we should take. The associate editor &ndash; the journalist who decided what news went on which page and was also responsible for copy editing, headlines and photo selection &ndash; led the voices who said India must tour. I argued why we must not by presenting these arguments:\n\n1. Pakistan is an artificial country of incompatible ethnic groups that virulently hate each other. The only time these Punjabis, Pathans, Seraikis and Sindhis come together is when the Pakistan cricket team plays India. Cricket acts like the glue that periodically makes disintegrating Pakistan stick together. Indians therefore must not do anything that stops the disintegrating process. Therefore, we must not play cricket with Pakistan.\n2. Pakistani cricketers come to India and are hosted, wined and dined by celebrities. The Pakistanis begin to believe they are superstars, without whom cricket would not sell in India. A similar claim was made by Pakistani artists. According to Hindi movie playback singer Abhijeet, Pakistani artists used to brag that &ldquo;without us your movies will not sell&rdquo;. Pakistani artists have the same mentality of hardcore Islamists who have a sense of entitlement. They believe they can enjoy Indian hospitality, earn megabucks in India and then snub India because a Muslim is entitled to take anything from a Hindu.\n3. Indian starlets try and hook up with some of the cricketers in order to boost their careers. The delusional Pakistanis then go around claiming that Indian women like Pakistani men. This is highly insulting for any self-respecting Indian.\n\nOf late, Pakistani cricketers have taken to &ldquo;thank the almighty Allah&rdquo; in post-match interviews. They also offer namaz on the cricket grounds, injecting an unhealthy dose of fundamentalism into sport.\n\nSince my arguments were well presented and solid, the associate editor got up and walked away, saying, &ldquo;No we must play cricket with them.&rdquo;\n\nFurther meetings were held that day to decide the paper&rsquo;s policy on whether we should pitch for resuming cricket or not. I was not invited to these meetings. By evening, the line taken was: India must play Pakistan.\n\nNow here&rsquo;s where it gets really interesting. The associate editor wrote the main front page story, arguing the case for playing Pakistan. A few weeks later when the Indian cricket team toured Pakistan, the newspaper sent a sports reporter to cover the matches. Joining him was the associate editor, who was feted like royalty by the Pakistanis. Over a period of more than a month, this journalist filed several pieces about how great the Pakistanis were.\n\nThe paper had daily fixed allowance for journalists travelling overseas. It was US$150 for South Asian countries. I heard from a very reliable source in the administration department that the total amount was so high that the accounts department did not clear the bill because they believed these expenses had been incurred on a frivolous tour. The matter went to the owners before the bill was cleared.\n\nPakistan, easy cash and Indian journalists were also the subjects of an FBI investigation. In 2011 when the FBI busted an ISI front in the United States, they discovered that the man running the racket, Ghulam Nabi Fai, had funnelled $4 million from the ISI to influence American opinion on Kashmir. The FBI recorded 4000 emails and phone calls from his Pakistani handlers. According to the FBI, of the statements Fai made, 80 per cent were provided by the ISI for him to repeat and disseminate verbatim. The other 20 per cent were Fai&rsquo;s own ideas, but which were pre-approved by the ISI. In other words, he was a 100 per cent Pakistani spy.\n\nAnd guess who were among his guest list: retired justice Rajinder Sachar (who headed a committee, which falsely claimed Indian Muslims faced discrimination in all aspects of life); Gautam Navlakha (editor of the communist rag Economic and Political Weekly); Dileep Padgaonkar (former editor of the Times of India); Harish Khare (the media adviser to the previous prime minister); Ved Bhasin (editor, Kashmir Times); Harinder Baweja (former India Today journalist) and Praful Bidwai (experienced columnist with communist leanings).\n\nThink about it. When Indian liberals and media figures attend conclaves where the agenda is India&rsquo;s exit from Kashmir, you think they are doing it for free?\n#Episode Tharoor\nBecause they all feed from the same trough, members of the Lutyens&rsquo; club solidly support each other, cutting across ideological and party lines. This is best illustrated by how they closed ranks to try and protect Shashi Tharoor. The former diplomat and Congress politician may or may not be involved in his wife Sunanda Pushkar&rsquo;s murder, but everyone agrees that the Delhi Police botched the investigation at the behest of someone powerful. It was classic O.J. Simpson style reprieve &ndash; there was plenty of circumstantial evidence to book Tharoor, but the police closed his file without pursuing any of the leads.\n\nThe law is very clear &ndash; any mysterious death of a woman within seven years of her marriage needs to be investigated by the anti-dowry cell. That wasn&rsquo;t applied to Tharoor. But, for the Lutyens cabal, the possible murder of a woman is irrelevant. In their view, the law should be bent to favour one of them.\n\nLeading the mob against Republic TV was columnist and long time BJP supporter Tavleen Singh. The veteran writer switched sides the moment Republic TV produced evidence that someone had indeed interfered in the police investigation. Writing in the Indian Express, she describes the channel&rsquo;s investigation as &ldquo;a media lynching&rdquo;. She even lies that Republic TV journalists were not attacked, whereas the visuals show Tharoor&rsquo;s goons aggressively pushing and shoving them.\n\nTavleen admits in her column that Tharoor is a &ldquo;Lutyens&rsquo; darling&rdquo;, meaning that he was one of their star members. A breach cannot be allowed. If a celebrity member is questioned and investigated, let alone booked or jailed like a criminal, it would be the beginning of the end for other law breakers as well. Powerful clubs do not operate like that; they nip such moves in the bud. Which is why Tavleen was quickly joined by Sadanand Dhume, a pro-Congress journalist and secular apologist (translation: opportunist), who tweeted Tavleen&rsquo;s words to give her hatchet job more traction.\n\nAnother example is the March 2002 suicide of Natasha Singh, the estranged daughter-in-law of then external affairs minister Natwar Singh. Just two months later Natwar&rsquo;s daughter Ritu Singh committed suicide. Both deaths were highly suspicious and were extensively covered by the Delhi media. Except by Hindustan Times &ndash; the city&rsquo;s largest circulation daily.\n\nHT did not cover the suicides even as a matter of record. The reason for blanking out the suicides was that the HT is a highly pro-Congress paper and Natwar Singh was a Gandhi-family loyalist. Once again the ranks closed to shield a member.\n\n**Supari (hit job) journalism**\n\nIn May 2017 a leading Delhi based newspaper produced a report that said 60 percent of the toilets built under the Swachch Bharat scheme lacked water and were therefore non-functional. An insider at the paper told me that the report was published despite a senior editor asking the reporter to provide more information about his claims. The story had several serious flaws:\n\n1) Why was 2015 data being used to write a story in 2017?\n\n2) Some of the toilets may not yet have received water supply, but perhaps were about to.\n\n3) What were the chief reasons for the lack of water supply?\n\n4) The water supply may have been denied by vested interests to make the initiative fail.\n\nHowever, without addressing any of the above issues, the team that was anchoring the story sent it for publication. This led to a huge confrontation &ndash; between the more balanced editors and a new anti-Modi team that is creating news tailored to fit their agenda. &ldquo;They are spinning journalism,&rdquo; the insider told me. &ldquo;A narrative is sought to be built that Modi is not an effective Prime Minister.&rdquo;\n\nThe insider, who is a senior editor at the paper, said secular, leftist, Christian, Muslim and plain opportunist journalists have formed networks and Whatsapp groups where the constant refrain is how to spin a particular news event to make Modi look bad. Once upon a time, members of this group jealously guarded their sources and tips, today they are cutting across media loyalties, constantly sharing bits of information with each other, in the hope that something that could connect Modi to a scam could crop up.\n\nA typical example is the train murder that happened near Ballabhgarh Railway Station, where the first take was that the stabbing was a result of a scuffle between two groups. As more details trickled in, the headlines and news reports were quickly changed to reflect the fact that the dead man was a Muslim and the other party was Hindu. Within hours the narrative was changed to show that the Muslim man was murdered because he was allegedly carrying beef.\n\nThis is a classic hatchet job, with low risks. As the news business is not an exact science, you can always allege something loudly, make your target (the Modi government) look guilty, and then retract silently if you are outed as a liar. Meanwhile, the international media (or more accurately, the India-hating media of the English speaking countries) picks up these scraps of misinformation and soon you have usual villains such as The Economist, Washington Post and New York Times proclaiming that India is descending into fascism. The Indian secular media, which contributed the original lie, now quotes the western media to buttress their claims that India is indeed intolerant. That India&rsquo;s name is sullied and Indian men are now labelled rapists and killers are of no concern to the Indian media.\n\nSays the media insider: &ldquo;The seculars do not want secularism. They are least bothered about the welfare of Muslims. They just want to eat kebabs and drink whisky at Khan Market. They want their perks back so they can breathe easy and go back to their offices and file their unreadable stories, which have little to no readership anyway. Webstats don&rsquo;t lie &ndash; many of these journalists are the living dead because nobody clicks on their stories.&rdquo;\n\nSo doesn&rsquo;t it bother these secular journalists at all that they have such abysmal readership. The insider explains: &ldquo;Their only readers are the NGOs and foreign journalists. Even their families would not read their articles if they paid them. They are that bad &ndash; besides being fake. The public knows it and they are tired of us. Our credibility is near zero. But these secular journalists keep getting paid because they perform a useful hatchet job for their owners. Plus, the odd NGO will quote their story and thereby boost their ego. It is the classic tyranny of low expectations. Throw in a few free foreign trips per year and they are happy like a larry.&rdquo;\n#Why is the media going after Modi?\nThere are two reasons. One, the current government has decided to treat journalists for what we are &ndash; journalists. No more, no less. A number of undeserved perks have been taken away. For instance, Modi has ended the practice of the Prime Minister taking the media along on a free junket on his overseas trips. Rajiv Gandhi may have popularised this practice, but Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh also massaged the egos of the political journalists by taking them along on official trips.\n\nSenior editors based in Delhi were used to grandiosely by-lining their stories: &ldquo;From the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Aircraft&rdquo;. Or even &ldquo;Somewhere in the Skies Over Washington DC&rdquo;. It didn&rsquo;t matter that the copy itself was an anticlimax. Poorly worded, equally bad analysis and most likely recycled from a report written at a similar junket two years ago.\n\nBeing denied VIP treatment is something the Lutyens&rsquo; media cannot swallow. They may come from ordinary middle class homes, but as journalists, they are used to be being treated as guests at the reasonably high table, wining and dining in the company of celebrities, industrialists and politicians.\n\nModi has taken away this perk. This is the chief reason why this supari or vendetta journalism has replaced normal reporting.\n\nOn a side note, one of the little known facts about the media is the enormous number of junkets that journalists are used to. Most of these go to business journalists, but the others get a good number too. In 2001 when I joined a leading Delhi-based newspaper, within the space of three months, I was offered a two-day junket to Malaysia and a seven-day trip to Russia, all expenses paid plus US$250 a day allowance. This was followed by a five-day Konkan Railway sponsored stay in Goa. And I was not even kosher &ndash; meaning that I was not a leftist, secular, smelly, unkempt journalist. I did not try and curry favour with a business house or political party. And yet I got picked for these rewards. The point is that if you blend in with the presstitutes, the rewards are greater.\n\nThe second &ndash; but equally important &ndash; reason why the media is going after Modi is that many members of the media moonlight as fixers, and once again the Prime Minister has taken away that handy second income. Among the first things he did after moving into the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office was to ban his cabinet ministers from meeting people they should not. There was one instance where a certain minister, who was meeting an industrialist, got a call on his mobile from Modi, who demanded what he was discussing with the industrialist at a five-star hotel. The minister freaked and scooted back to his office. Therefore, with ministers &ndash; and bureaucrats &ndash; being under the Intelligence Bureau&rsquo;s scanner, the media fixer&rsquo;s hands are tied and his role greatly curtailed.\n\nThe Radia tapes scandal of 2010 showed the country how leading journalists such as Barkha Dutt (NDTV), Vir Sanghvi (Hindustan Times) and Shankar Ayyar (India Today) were acting as fixers for the rich and powerful. For instance, Dutt and Sanghvi canvassed for DMK party politician A. Raja to be appointed telecom minister. According to a government auditor, Raja caused a $40 billion scam because of his illegal spectrum sale.\n\nAssuming an extremely conservative kickback of 1 per cent, can you imagine the payoff for the media fixer?\n#Endgame\nLutyens&rsquo; Delhi is a snakepit. It is injecting poison into the country&rsquo;s body politic. Its shrill denouncement of Modi is not just jarring, but also diverting attention from vital governance. Its actions send the government into defensive or firefighting mode. No government deserves to be treated in such manner.\n\nA remedy is to go on the offensive. The Congress is feared by Lutyens&rsquo; Delhi because it is vindictive. Late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was a vindictive person. So is her daughter-in-law, the Italian born Sonia Gandhi. Modi should emulate them and drill some fear into the hearts of his opponents. Each one of them must have a skeleton in their closet. They must have stashed ill-gotten wealth in a benami account. They must have spoken with some Pakistani terrorist. They could be cheating on their spouses. You don&rsquo;t need the IB to go after them. A private detective agency will give you all the dirt.\n\nModi must use Machiavellian tactics to neutralise his enemies. He should stop being goody two shoes because the Award Wapsi gang and supari journalists are not impressed by his kindness. They are not going to reciprocate. Their agenda is to make him fail. Or at least make him look like a failure. If they throw dirt at him unchecked, the danger is some of it could stick. India cannot afford a return of the Gandhis in 2019 or even 2024. The country needs a long innings from Modi to make India strong and rich again. If the Lutyens nexus tries to stop him, he must stop them.\n\nMr Prime Minister, don&rsquo;t say you weren&rsquo;t warned.\n\n^(Disclaimer: The facts and opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

HISTORY IS TOO IMPORTANT TO BE LEFT ALONE TO HISTORIANS!'<br />Body: '# History is too important to be left alone to Historians!\n\nSo recently I have taken upon myself to create well-cited notes on the history of ***Bharat!*** \n\nso I was going through all the authors for citations and I noticed some strange things\\~\n\n&amp;gt;How does one make a civilization weak and emotionally and intellectually vulnerable? &nbsp;\n&amp;gt; &nbsp;\n&amp;gt;It is simple you just take away the only pride that one might have and whitewash that to make them believe that they were barbaric LOWER IQ people who could not manage anything on their own! So they put all that morally depressing things in our History Books! \n\n*So I noticed some strange things! All the post-NEHRUVIAN/INDIRA reign our History books started getting hijacked by the* ***Leftist/Assumed Centrist/Marxists.*** *Any Uninformed Nibba if reads those books then all he will think is that OUR HISTORY is pathetic and we were a bunch of savages who were colonised by INVADERS/HUNS/TURKS/GREEKS/MUGHALS/EUROPEANS/BRITISHERS and everything came from them!*\n\nBut the reality is far away from it! One will only feel sad and depressed if one reads those books! \n\nLike I was referring ***UPINDER SINGH*** book on ancient India history and her pejorative of referring to ***GUPTA EMPIRE*** was so visible! She apparently the daughter of Former PM Manmohan Singh! No wonder she might have been involved in "CONGRESS RAJDARBAR" to get politically entrenched! But she is smart! From her writings, she will call out &nbsp;Marxist Historians and Nationalist School of thought historians that we should look at history without bias! But then she always takes a U\\~Turn. All this is &nbsp; "HISTORY AL TAQIYA" and she slowly starts injecting ***MARXIST BIAS*** in her books! By reading her books one will hardly feel any pride! SO instead of getting our chest swollen up with pride, it sinks in with low self-esteem! &nbsp;Unfortunately, she is an EMINENT PROF in Delhi University! So according to her GUPTA EMPIRE IS NOT THE GOLDEN AGE OF INDIA! (Guess what as &nbsp;marxist she is smart hit the right spot by lowering down the only empire that really in all sense was the TRUE GOLDEN AGE EMPIRE OF CLASSICAL INDIA!) So they attack that! This reminds me of interesting lines\\~\n\n \n\n&amp;gt;*It all boils down to pride. Italian city-states, post-Christian Central Europe - all wanted to claim at least cultural successorship to Rome\'s legacy. Rome was that one girl everyone wants to have but cannot.* &nbsp;\n&amp;gt; &nbsp;\n&amp;gt;*Rome, therefore, got remembered in annals as that continuously coveted girl whom everyone wanted to sleep with, some did, some did not and some raped her because she plainly refused but then again - they all got what they wanted.* &nbsp;\n&amp;gt; &nbsp;\n&amp;gt;*Now contrast with the Gupta Empire -* &nbsp;\n&amp;gt; &nbsp;\n&amp;gt;*A people who hate their own past will not tend to remember it like some prize woman coveted overtimes, nor will they try remembering it as a time when they were the best. It boils down psychologically to the fact that while Rome became European invaders\' trophy courtesan, the Gupta period became the whore of history.* &nbsp;\n&amp;gt; &nbsp;\n&amp;gt;*Empires are not called empires because they recorded themselves as such in history. Empires are called empires only because its peoples\' descendants choose to recognize the history that way. For instance, the Mughal \'empire\' got destroyed and de-facto abolished many times before its dynastic end had actually arrived and yet - books call it the Mughal empire. Reason - the people who wrote those books would rather remember Turko-Mongol Islamic rule as a continuous prized memory of history rather than whatever your status explains.* &nbsp;\n&amp;gt; &nbsp;\n&amp;gt;*Psychology of people remembering history is normally the answer to questions pertaining to the later interpretation of history as well.*\n\n \n\n&amp;gt;*Ok. Riddle me this.* &nbsp;\n&amp;gt; &nbsp;\n&amp;gt;*The Roman Empire was, in the course of its existence, dissolved several times, changed hands even more, was split up, parcelled out, apportioned, quartered, gambled away, bought back, and otherwise rendered defunct multiple times- but it\'s still called the \'Roman Empire\'.* &nbsp;\n&amp;gt; &nbsp;\n&amp;gt;*On the other hand:-* &nbsp;\n&amp;gt; &nbsp;\n&amp;gt;*1- Sri Gupta (240 AD to 280 AD) (Founder of the Empire)* &nbsp;\n*2- Ghatotkacha Gupta (280 AD to 319 AD)* &nbsp;\n*3- Chandra Gupta (320 AD to 335 AD)* &nbsp;\n*4- Samudra Gupta (335 AD to 380 AD)* &nbsp;\n*5- Rama Gupta (380 AD to 382 AD)* &nbsp;\n*6- Chandra Gupta 2/ (aka Vikramaditya) &nbsp;(382 AD to 415 AD)* &nbsp;\n*7- Kumara Gupta (415 AD to 455 AD)* &nbsp;\n*8- Skanda Gupta (455 AD to 467 AD)* &nbsp;\n*9- Puru Gupta (467 AD to 473 AD)* &nbsp;\n*10- Kumara Gupta (473 AD to 476 AD)* &nbsp;\n*11- Buddha Gupta (476 AD to 495 AD)* &nbsp;\n*12- Narasimha Gupta (495 AD to 523 AD)* &nbsp;\n*13- Kumara Gupta (523 AD to 540 AD)* &nbsp;\n*14- Vainya Gupta (540 AD to 550 AD)* &nbsp;\n*15- Bhanu Gupta (550 AD to 557 AD)* &nbsp;\n*16- Krishna Gupta (557 AD to 559 AD)* &nbsp;\n*17- Harsha Gupta* &nbsp;\n*18- Jivita Gupta (few days)* &nbsp;\n*19- Kumara Gupta (560s AD to 570s AD)* &nbsp;\n*20- Damodara Gupta (few days)* &nbsp;\n*21- Mahasena Gupta (570 AD to 580 AD)* &nbsp;\n*22- Prabhakara Pushyabhuti (son-in-law of Mahasena; 580 to 604 AD)* &nbsp;\n*23- Rajyavardhana Pushyabhuti (604 AD to 606 AD)* &nbsp;\n*24- Harshavardhana Pushyabhuti (606 AD to 647 AD)* &nbsp;\n*25- Unnamed noble (No Conclusive Data present)* &nbsp;\n*26- (?)

<li>Title: 'Lachit Borpukhan &ndash; The Hero of Assam and Pride of India #1 (Not a meme post)'<br />Body: " Background &ndash; The mighty **Ahom Kingdom of Assam**\n\nSince their beginning in the year of 1228 AD, The Ahom kingdom (in Assam) had defeated all the attacks from various Islamic Dynasties. **Whether it was Khilji Sultanate, Tughlaq Sultanate, Ilyas Sultanate or Lodhi Sultanate, none was able to defeat the valour of the Ahom kingdom**. However, in the year 1661 AD Aurangzeb, the warlord of the biggest army in India, the Mughals sent his army in the leadership of two of his most trusted generals Mir Jumla and Diler Khan to conquer Assam and Bengal. Mir Jumla led a naval invasion of Ahom Kingdom. During this period, the Ahom Kingdom had lost many great men and the unity that resisted all the previous Invasions. The Mughals' campaign was successful; they won many forts without even a fight from the Ahom Kingdom. The King of Ahom Kingdom, Jaydhwaj Singha ji fought the invasion bravely but he had to retread and even lost a significant portion of the territory in the battle.\n\nThe battle was lost and the King had to agree to a humiliating treaty to save the life of his compatriots. In this treaty, he gave up his land, money, his elephants, a significant portion of the Calvary and weapons. Nevertheless, gaining territory was not enough for the Mughal Aurangzeb; the Mughals also took the King&rsquo;s six-year daughter to Mughal Harem. **King Jaydhwaj Singha could not bear this pain and passed away**. In the wake of King&rsquo;s death, Chakradhwaj Singha ji became the new king.\n\n**Lachit Borpukhan** &ndash; A brief introduction to the gallant warrior\n\n**Lachit Borpukhan ji** was born around 1620 AD, his father **Momai Tamuli Barbarua ji** was a senior officer in the Kingdom. Lachit ji had a keen interest in the Royal affairs and always wanted to show his love for his Kingdom. With his ability and courage, he achieved a senior position in the king&rsquo;s administration.\n\nIn the year 1665 AD, the army needed a new Borpukhan. *In Ahom Army, the Borpukhan is the Army Cheif or the Commander who controls the entire army*. After discussing the matter with his ministers, the King Cakradhwaj Singh ji agreed that there could not be anyone more capable for the position of Borpukhan than the Lachit ji. **Therefore, Lachit ji was named the Borpukhan of the Army**. It was a very difficult time for the Ahoms. Their Army had become disjointed and dejected; they did not even possess the proper weapons and arms to fight with the enemy. Therefore, Lachit ji spent the next four years organizing the army. They recruited and trained the soldiers, built weapons and boats for the navy, strengthened the fort and improved the army infrastructure.\n\nThey were successfully able to keep the rebuilding of the Army a secret from the Enemy. In the year 1667 AD Firoz Khan had been named the head of the Ghuwati fort. Firoz Khan was a cruel and hedonistic person. Driven by his pursuit of pleasure he demanded that the King Chakradhwaj Singha ji must present him Assamese Girls whenever he wished. This was the final straw for the Ahom Kingdom who had remained silent for a long time. This incident enraged the people and the King equally; they wanted to end the Mughal rule on their land at once. Lachit Borpukhan ji decided to take back the Ghuwati Fort from the Mughals. With the years of preparation, Lachit ji had changed the disjointed and disinvested army to the fiercest warriors in India. But no matter the might of the Ahoms and how well-trained the army was, they were lacking in the numbers, especially in the calvary. Their biggest challenge was going to be the fort of Itakuli. Itakuli was the frontier which defended Ghuwati. If the Ahom Army was successful in capturing the Itakuli fort, they would have taken the Ghuwati back but the task was going to be onerous. **With determination in their hearts, they led the siege to the Itakuli.**\n\nSubscribe to - HindutvaRises subreddit for more\n\nPlease feel free to correct me in the comments below if any mistake is found.

<li>Title: 'The Untold Story of India&rsquo;s Partition'<br />Body: 'The Indian leaders were arrogant, inconsistent, disinterested in foreign affairs, did not understand the defence and erred politically time and again. Gandhi and Nehru failed to maintain the integrity of the Indian land when the partition was imminently avoidable since neither Muslims nor Hindus wanted it. \n\nIt was by sheer chance that Narendra Singh Sarila came across certain documents which revealed that the partition of India was linked to the great game being played between Britain and the USSR at the time. Without this accidental discovery, the riveting story of India&rsquo;s partition may have remained buried in the heap of archives somewhere in a London library.\n\nEncouraged by this chance discovery, Sarila expanded his research into the archives of the British Library London, Hartley Library South Hampton, Broadland Archives, United States Foreign Relations documents and Nehru Memorial Museum. The result of this extensive research is a path breaking book- Shadow of The Great Game, The Untold Story of India&rsquo;s Partition. &nbsp;\n\nSarila has the right credentials to write this tale. Son of the Maharaja of Sarila, he was the Aide de Camp of Mountbatten in 1948 and served in the Indian Foreign Service from 1948-1985.\n\nHere is the tragic story of India&rsquo;s partition. It throws a completely new light on the established narrative of the partition and independence of India. The history we have been taught would have us believe that irreconcilable Hindu-Muslim differences forced the reluctant British rulers to partition India and Gandhi&rsquo;s non-violent resistance got the British to pack their bags. Let us see what the truth really was.\n\n**The Great Game**\n\nAfter the Czars had expanded their empire to within 100 miles from Kashmir, the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) had become a very strategic region for the British Empire. Especially after the 1857 mutiny, the British feared that disgruntled Indian rulers would begin intriguing with the Russians. From a Russian perspective, Asia was to them what undiscovered Americas was to Europe: savages needing to be civilized and controlled.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the Russians became a formidable power in Eurasia. The British feared that if India fell under the Russian influence, it would mean the eclipse of the British Empire. Thus, started a clash between the British and Russians that Rudyard Kipling termed &lsquo;the Great Game.&rsquo;\n\nIn April 1946, the British Chiefs of Staff Field Marshal Viscount Allenbrooke, Air Marshal Arthur William Tedder and Admiral Rhoderick McGrigor reported to the British cabinet:\n\n&lsquo;Recent developments made it appear that Russia is our most probable enemy and to meet its threat, areas on which our war effort will be based and without which it would not be possible for us to fight at all would include India.&rsquo;\n\nThe man who first grasped the strategic importance of India for the survival of the British empire, was Field Marshal Archibald Wavell, viceroy from 1943-46. He recognized that the British power was fading, and it was a matter of time before Britain would have to withdraw. In his estimate, the Congress party which would rule India would not cooperate with British interests. This breach, he figured, would have to be plugged by making the Muslim League succeed in separating the Northwest from the rest of India.\n\nWavell noted in his diary that Churchill too had visualized the division of India. In fact, Churchill&rsquo;s idea was a division into three parts, Pakistan, Hindustan and Princesstan. Wavell, however, had envisaged then a division of India as it actually happened later. This plan was known secretly within the British leadership as the Wavell plan of Pakistan.\n\nBy early 1947, the British military and leadership were in overwhelming agreement to retain strategic control over Northwest India. Thereafter they played an intricate game to finesse a blundering Congress Party, use Jinnah to achieve their strategic goal and to fool the Americans who had other ideas.\n\n**How the Congress was Finessed**\n\nThe British strategic objective was to retain control over the Northwest by partitioning India.\n\nThe Muslim objective was a little complex. In the provinces where Muslims were in majority (about 70-75% of Muslim population), there was no feeling that Islam was in danger. The Islam in danger narrative had appeal in Muslim minority provinces only. Majority of Muslims were confident of avoiding Hindu domination. They saw Hindus as both divided and passive, who could be easily bullied. Even fundamentalists like Abdul Al Mawdudi of Jammat-i-Islami did not want partition as they did not approve of Jinnah&rsquo;s non-Islamic ways. However, there was a small elite led by the likes of Agha Khan, Liaqat Ali Khan and Syed Ahmad Khan who wanted a separate Islamic state. Jinnah himself was initially against a break up, but scorned by Gandhi and Nehru he later wanted Pakistan in any shape or size.\n\nThe objective of the Congress Party, effectively the sole political force representing Hindu interest, should have been to defend the territorial integrity of India at any cost.\n\nThe Americans were of the view that an undivided independent India was crucial to gain their much needed cooperation in the war effort. Second, an independent united India would give a positive signal to the rest of Asia. &lsquo;Asia for Asiatics&rsquo; was a significant part of the American vision for a post war world order.\n\n**Jinnah Floats the Two Nation Theory**\n\nGandhi squandered a hard won election victory in 1937, by resigning from the provincial governments as part of his badly timed Quit India movement. This move had exactly the opposite effect than what was intended. The British were determined to not let anything come in the way of the war effort. Instead of feeling pressured they simply reduced their dependence on the Congress and thus its bargaining power. Further the vacuum created, gave a god sent opportunity to Jinnah. A delighted Jinnah termed the Congress move a &lsquo;Himalayan blunder.&rsquo; The distinguished civil servant V P Menon noted that &lsquo;by resigning the Congress Party showed lamentable political wisdom.&rsquo;\n\nOn 24th March 1941 Jinnah proclaimed that Muslims were a separate nation. This suited the British plan. By strengthening Jinnah, the British were making Gandhi increasingly irrelevant. His loud proclamations of non-violence were not sitting well with the British in the midst of a tough war. In 1940 Gandhi told Viceroy Linlithgow:\n\n&lsquo;Let them (the Germans) take possession of your beautiful island, if Hitler chooses to occupy your homes vacate them, if he does not give you free passage out, allow yourself, every man, woman and child to be slaughtered.&rsquo;\n\nJinnah&rsquo;s scheme for Pakistan included NWFP, Baluchistan, all of Punjab, Delhi, Sind, all of Bengal, Assam, Hyderabad and all other Muslim princely states and a corridor connecting East and West Pakistan\n\nThe Congress party, being neither farsighted nor adamant on a united India, did not counter Jinnah&rsquo;s preposterous scheme. Nehru reasoned that taking the idea seriously would encourage separatist forces. It wasn&rsquo;t until 1944 that Gandhi said that Hindus and Muslims were not separate. He argued that Muslims were descendants from converts and there was no precedence in history of a change of religion changing nationality. The result was that the two-nation idea was not nipped in the bud and Jinnah was politically strengthened.\n\nThe irony of Jinnah was that for the first sixty years of his life he fought for a united India. Jinnah&rsquo;s difficulties began after Gandhi returned from South Africa in 1915. In the 1920 Nagpur Congress session, Jinnah and Gandhi clashed. Jinnah was openly booed in the presence of his young wife Ruttie, with Gandhi refusing to intervene. In 1928 Jinnah persuaded the Muslim league to give up the separate electorate in return for 33% Muslim seats in the central legislature, separation of Sind from Bombay Presidency and recognition of NWFP and Baluchistan as separate entities. This, he reasoned, would enable the Muslims to dominate five provinces and help reduce communal differences. The Congress rejected this proposal. Angling for his son Jawaharlal to be elected Congress President, Motilal Nehru did not want to risk upsetting Congress leaders by supporting Jinnah. In the midst of this major crisis in his career, Ruttie decided to leave him. Badly scarred, Jinnah left for England in 1933 to concentrate on his legal practice.\n\nIt was Liaqat Ali Khan who persuaded Jinnah to return and contest the 1937 elections. Jinnah was unsure of countering Gandhi&rsquo;s ability to mobilize the masses. Khan assured him that he will arrange the means to win them over. He did not, however, reveal that whipping up fanaticism was the weapon he had in mind. Jinnah returned and set upon the task of rebuilding the Muslim League. He was now consumed by a burning desire to vanquish the Congress and get even with the arrogant Nehru. For the first time he began to see Mohammad Iqbal&rsquo;s idea of a separate Muslim state as a way to achieve personal glory.\n\nIn the end, Jinnah emerged a tragic Shakespearian character. Exploited by hard liners like Liaqat Ali Khan, used by the British and consumed by his own ambition, he died a bitter man. Colonel Ilahi Bakhsh, his doctor heard Jinnah say, &lsquo;I have made Pakistan, but I am convinced that I have committed the greatest blunder of my life.&rsquo; \n\n**The Cripps Mission** \n\nIn 1941 the Allied forces were suffering reverses. The attack on Pearl Harbour had drawn America into the war. Roosevelt was putting pressure on Churchill to grant self-governance to an undivided India. He felt that this was best course to gain India&rsquo;s cooperation in the war effort. Viceroy Linlithgow, however, was of the firm opinion that no concession should be granted to the Indians at this crucial juncture in the war. He was certain that any agitation caused by Gandhi could be brought down.\n\nTo deflect the American pressure, Churchill decided to send Sir Stafford Cripps to India. The mission was a smokescreen designed for deliberate failure. The covert plan was to placate Roosevelt and put the Congress in a dilemma. The Cripps Plan was:\n\nImmediately after the war India would be independent either within or outside the Commonwealth.\n\nIn the interim, a politically representative Executive Council would be formed under the Viceroy.\n\nThe princely states would have the right to stay out of the proposed Indian Union if they so choose.\n\nThe proposal had to be accepted or rejected as a whole.\n\nFor the first time, the idea of princely states not being part of the union was mooted. The real motive behind the mission can be gauged from what Foreign Secretary Amery said to Linlithgow:\n\n&lsquo;As for the Congress, their adverse reaction may be all the greater when they discover that the nest contains Pakistan Cookoo&rsquo;s egg.&rsquo;\n\nOn 25 March 1942 Cripps noted:\n\n&lsquo;I think Jinnah was rather surprised in the distance that it went to meet the Pakistan case.&rsquo;\n\nAs expected the Congress Party rejected the proposal on 11 April 1942. But surprisingly the resolution rejecting the proposal had this sentence:\n\n&lsquo;The Congress working committee cannot think in terms of compelling the people of any territorial unit to remain in the Indian Union against their declared and established will.&rsquo; \n\nThis was inexplicable since the Congress had consistently considered India indivisible. It raised doubts about its commitment to India&rsquo;s unity.\n\nThe British achieved their objectives of placating the Americans, giving Jinnah hope and putting the Congress into a dilemma. The Congress on its part, erred badly in diluting its position on the integrity of India and by not joining the Executive council. It is arguable that by joining they could have exerted power and signaled their cooperation in the war effort. This would have been useful to garner the support of the British public and the Americans. The risk of the princely states seceding was low and the majority of Muslims did not want partition.\n\n**After the Cripps&rsquo;s Mission**\n\nAfter the Cripps mission, Gandhi became belligerent. This can be discerned by the draft of the Allahabad Congress resolution, leaked to British intelligence by the Communist party. The Communists had switched loyalty from the Nationalists to the British after Russia was attacked by the Germans. This is a sad commentary on the Communist Party too, but that is another story.\n\nThe draft asked for the British to clear out and to use force if necessary. Nehru opposed the draft saying that the British would not allow this and would render India into an active war zone. The draft was first accepted and then rejected the same day after Nehru&rsquo;s threat. \n\nIn the draft we have Nehru saying:\n\n&lsquo;It is Gandhiji&rsquo;s feeling that Japan and Germany will win. This feeling unconsciously governs his thinking.&rsquo;\n\nBritish intelligence quoted this statement to Roosevelt to denounce Gandhi as &lsquo;a fifth columnist.&rsquo;\n\nIn 1945 Wavell held another conference to discuss the formation of a politically representative Executive Council. Jinnah was tutored by a member of the Viceroy&rsquo;s council to sabotage the meeting in return for the promise of Pakistan. Hence as early as June 1945 Jinnah was taken into confidence on the creation of Pakistan. This event made Jinnah into a strong leader of the Muslims.\n\n**Clement Atlee Becomes Prime Minister** \n\nIn 1945 Churchill lost the election and Clement Atlee took over as Prime Minister. Unlike Churchill, Atlee liked to operate from behind the scene. His objective was to partition India but make it appear that the Congress wanted it. His second objective was to persuade Jinnah to accept a truncated Pakistan. As we have seen there existed a Wavell plan of Pakistan which was pretty much how Pakistan was finally created.\n\nHe instructed Cripps to reach out to Nehru and ask for his suggestion. On 27 January 1946, Nehru wrote a 3500-word letter.\n\nThe gist of the letter was:\n\nThe British should grant independence to India and allow it to frame its own constitution.\n\nThe British should not divide India. Only after a plebiscite can territories that wished to secede could do so.\n\nPakistan was a non-starter because the vote for Muslim League did not mean a vote for separation.\n\nAlthough there was a feeling that the British would not leave without force, he was in favor of a negotiated settlement.\n\nAgain, Nehru failed to stand firm on India&rsquo;s territorial integrity be mentioning plebiscite. Not surprisingly, Atlee decoded this as the Congress being &lsquo;flexible&rsquo; on separation. The assurance of eschewing force and negotiating a settlement was an added relief. Atlee now instructed Cripps to work towards Wavell&rsquo;s Pakistan. The Cabinet Mission was the next major event.\n\n**The Cabinet Mission 1946** \n\nIn March 1946 the Cabinet Mission arrived in India to devise a mechanism for the smooth transfer of power. It comprised Sir Pethick-Lawrence, Secretary of State for India, Sir Stafford Cripps, President, Board of Trade and A V Alexander, First Lord of the Admiralty.\n\nThe key features of the Cabinet Mission plan were:\n\nAcceptance of the Muslim fear of Hindu domination.\n\nGrouping of provinces into A, B, C. Sizable Muslim populated areas into B and C (North West &amp;amp; East of India), to be controlled by the Muslim League. However, a separate state of Pakistan was ruled out.\n\nAfter ten years Groups B &amp;amp; C could secede if they so wished.\n\nThe Union of India will have three subjects under its control-Foreign Affairs, Defence and Communication. The provincial governments will control other subjects.\n\nNo clause could be modified without the majority of representatives of the two political formations and the majority of representatives of the constituent assemblies agreeing.\n\nAtlee&rsquo;s plan was to somehow induct Nehru and Patel into the government to prevent the Congress from revolting. Second to browbeat Jinnah into accepting a truncated Pakistan.\n\nJinnah was suspicious about a plan that rejected the idea of an independent Pakistan straight away. The Labour politician and journalist Woodrow Wyatt was tasked with convincing Jinnah that this plan was the first step on the road to Pakistan. He writes:\n\n&lsquo;When I finished his (Jinnah&rsquo;s) face lit up. He hit the table with his hand. That&rsquo;s it, I said, you&rsquo;ve got it.&rsquo;\n\nJinnah accepted the plan.\n\nAs had been the pattern, the Congress&rsquo;s response was inconsistent and confused. Gandhi did realize that the proposal was a trap. No provision for an independent Pakistan was to bait the Congress, while the acceptance of a principle of Pakistan was to bait the Muslim League. So, while the Congress was willing to accept the idea of an Interim Government, the possibility of B and C breaking away was objectionable.\n\nThe Nationalists urged the Congress to renew the Quit India movement, this time violently. The 1946 INA revolt had unnerved the British. They came to believe that the loyalty of the Indian army could no longer be relied upon. Field Marshal Claude Auchinleck had noted &lsquo;wholesale defection and disintegration of the Indian army was possible.&rsquo; A full-blown revolt would have perhaps stopped Jinnah&rsquo;s belligerent Direct action as well.\n\nThe Congress leadership felt that a revolt was too risky. They figured that by accepting being in the Interim Government they might somehow be able to ward off the partition. They banked on the NWFP, under Congress friendly rule, choosing to stay within India, thus making Pakistan non-contiguous enclaves within Indian borders and therefore temporary.\n\nOn 6 July 1946, Nehru announced that the Congress was committed to nothing more than simply entering the Interim government. This prompted Jinnah to reject the Cabinet Mission plan in toto. Jinnah announced Direct action which led to the horrific Calcutta killings. The Congress had failed to see that their restraint would embolden the Muslim League to adopt violent ways.\n\nOn 2 September 1946 Atlee succeeded in getting Nehru to join the Interim government. Jinnah saw this as an ominous move. But the British were pleased as the plan was moving in the right direction. N P A Smith, Director of Intelligence Bureau looked ahead:\n\n&lsquo;As I have said for some months, Pakistan is likely to come from Congresstan.&rsquo; (the acceptance of office by the Congress)\n\nNow Wavell began to work on Gandhi and Nehru to accept the Cabinet Mission&rsquo;s grouping formula. He argued that without this acceptance the Muslim League would not join the government and more violence will result. Both Gandhi and Nehru rejected the proposal. The Nationalists felt that the only way to keep India united was to be in the government and exclude Jinnah from it. This would help to break away the Muslim leaders opposed to Jinnah.\n\nWavell, however, was relentless. He met Nehru on 11,16, 26 and 27 September 1946 to persuade him to take Jinnah on board but Nehru stood firm. Inexplicably on October 2, 1946, Nehru caved in. He told Sudhir Ghosh, a Gandhi confidant &lsquo;Well this man (Wavell) had been pestering me to start talks with Jinnah. A few days ago, I told him in sheer exasperation that if he was so keen to talk to Jinnah he could do so.&rsquo;\n\nWhat transpired next was the biggest blow to the united India project. Wavell invited the Muslim League to join the Viceroy&rsquo;s executive council without either insisting that they join the Constituent assembly or even call off direct action campaign. This was a great victory for Jinnah. He could now sabotage Nehru from within. The move did not stop violence either as the Noakhali riots followed soon after.\n\nThe last piece of the action required the secession of NWFP. \n\n**How NWFP was Plucked Out** \n\nThe Congress figured that with NWFP in their hands, the division of Pakistan would at best be enclaves within the borders of India, which could not last for long. This could have worked if they were firm against any division. However, the Congress resolution to bifurcate Punjab and Bengal into Muslim and Hindu parts went against the united India principle. By accepting the division of Punjab and Bengal, the Congress was in principle accepting Jinnah&rsquo;s two nation theory.\n\nThe extent of this blunder can be judged by what the US charge d&rsquo;affairs in India George Merrell wrote to his government on 22 April 1947:\n\n&lsquo;The Congress effort to make Pakistan unattractive by demanding the partition of Punjab and Bengal-Congress leaders have in effect abandoned the tenets which they supported for so many years in their campaign for united India. They have also agreed by implication to Jinnah&rsquo;s allegation that Hindus and Muslims cannot live together.&rsquo;\n\nVery significantly this weakened the American position on an undivided India.\n\nOn taking over as viceroy in March 1947, Lord Mountbatten asked Nehru what he would do in his (Mountbatten&rsquo;s) place. Nehru again weakened the position of a united India when he said, &lsquo;it would not be right to impose any form of constitutional conditions on any community which was in a majority in a specific area.&rsquo; Mountbatten obviously took this to mean that Nehru was agreeable to the provinces, including NWFP, being given a free choice. He floated the idea of a referendum to which Nehru agreed, sure as he was of a Congress victory. He had erred again by failing to factor in the effect of Gandhian pacifism on the Frontier Gandhi, Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan. Fearing bloodletting, Gaffar Khan decided that his party will not vote in the referendum. The referendum voted for Pakistan by 50.49%. If Gaffar Khan&rsquo;s party had not boycotted the referendum, albeit with bloodletting, NWFP would have been with India.\n\nThe assessment of N P A Smith that Pakistan would come from Congresstan came true.\n\n**How the Americans Were Played** \n\nThe Americans were disposed towards a free undivided India for three reasons: \n\nRoosevelt figured that fulfilling the Indian aspiration for freedom would encourage them to support the war effort wholeheartedly.\n\nThe freedom and unity of India was required to send a positive signal to the rest of Asia on the post war American plan of &lsquo;Asia for Asiatics.&rsquo;\n\nPartition would give a fillip to the dreaded Communist forces.\n\nChurchill played on the American&rsquo;s lack of knowledge of the complexity of India. In fact, he willfully misled Roosevelt by saying that 75% of recruits were Muslim (only 33% were). He used this to justify acceding to the Muslim aspiration of a separate country.\n\nThe Americans were increasingly getting anxious of Gandhi&rsquo;s belligerence and call for civil disobedience in 1942. Nehru who understood foreign relations better than anybody else at the time got Gandhi to write to Roosevelt appealing to his ideal of freedom and democracy. Nehru also got Gandhi to mention that a free India would be open to allied bases.\n\nRoosevelt did write to Churchill, but the British response was on expected lines. Foreign Secretary Amery pointed out the irreconcilable religious differences in India. He emphatically reassured the Americans that any agitation will be quelled swiftly thus not impacting the war effort. Churchill chipped in with a scathing criticism of the Congress saying that their offer of supporting the war effort in lieu of the British quitting was an eyewash and that they would have no hesitation in joining hands with the Japanese. Realizing that this would be a tightrope walk, Roosevelt stopped pushing the issue.\n\nWhatever hope there was of an American intervention was dashed when Congress agreed to the Cabinet Mission plan and division of Punjab and Bengal.\n\n**Looking at the Events in Hindsight** \n\nBritain&rsquo;s Pakistan strategy was a spectacular success. Pakistan joined the Baghdad Pact and later the CENTO led by the USA. This formed a defence barrier against Soviet ambition in the Middle East. In 1958, Pakistan provided air bases to the CIA in Peshawar from where they flew U2 spy planes. In 1970 Pakistan helped the US establish a relationship with China to pressurize the Soviets from the East. In 1980 Pakistan played a major role in helping the USA defeat the Soviet Union to end the cold war.\n\nJinnah got his Pakistan but died a bitter man. The West used Pakistan and when no longer needed, fed it to the wolves. The question needs to be asked if its people benefited from the partition. In 1945 Field Marshal Alanbrooke was prescient when he told the British cabinet:\n\n&lsquo;With no industrial development Pakistan would not be able to defend itself. Pakistan will end up identifying with Muslim lands and end up in wars not in its interest.&rsquo;\n\nThe entire saga of colonial rule shows up the British empire as downright unconscionable. The damage they have inflicted on India is so mind boggling that even today we shy away from honestly analyzing it. They wreaked cultural destruction, divided the people, impoverished a prosperous country to build their own wealth, inflicted famines that killed so many millions that history must judge Churchill a bigger villain than Hitler. They have their hands soaked in the blood of over half a million people by engineering an avoidable partition. The history of the British Raj from an Indian gaze needs to be written. Even a clinical assessment will be severely damning.\n\nHowever, the saddest part of this story, is the sheer ineptitude of the Indian leadership. The narrative we have been fed about them is false. The Indian leaders were arrogant, inconsistent, disinterested in foreign affairs, did not understand defence and erred politically time and again. In a predatory world they were easily exploited. Gandhi and Nehru need to be judged unapologetically for what they achieved or did not achieve. They failed to maintain the integrity of the Indian land when partition was imminently avoidable since neither the Muslims nor the Hindus wanted it.\n\nHere is a list of mistakes:\n\nRejecting a capable and then secular Jinnah from the Congress party in the 1920s made an enemy out of him. If he had been retained in the Congress fold, the story of India would have been quite different. Gandhi should have intervened between Nehru and Jinnah keeping long term national interest above personal likes and dislikes. Nehru should have negotiated harder with Jinnah to keep India united.\n\nGiving up the gains of a massive electoral victory in 1937 over an ill-timed Quit India movement, made the British distrustful and opened the door for Jinnah. The Quit India movement was timed in the midst of a tough war. The British were in no mood to give any concessions. As it happened the movement was quelled ruthlessly, thousands were killed and over sixty thousand imprisoned. Even aerial machine gun firing was resorted to. After Subhash Bose had dealt a big blow with the INA trials, the time was right for a second Quit India movement, but Gandhi demurred.\n\nComplete inconsistency in their resolve to keep India united. Not strongly opposing Jinnah&rsquo;s preposterous two nation theory in 1941; indicating time and again that people could choose to stay in united India or not; agreeing to the trap of the Cabinet Mission plan; losing NWFP, not exploiting Roosevelt&rsquo;s support for a united India; and not meeting fire with fire on Jinnah&rsquo;s violent ways.\n\nGandhi&rsquo;s bigger goal appears to have been the ideal of non-violence and not the unity of India. He has to take the rap for this. Nobody can deny Gandhi the credit of galvanizing a broken people into a spiritually inspired force. He caught the imagination of the world and whipped up global sympathy for his cause, but his failure to use this mammoth advantage to achieve his goals has to be questioned. He failed to frame and pursue non-negotiable goals. Despite proclamations of the ideal like non-violence, the masses still ended up losing their lives for nothing.\n\nFinally, to Nehru, an intelligent man who too could not frame clear goals and work unwaveringly for them, like Jinnah did. If he was clear he would have cooperated with the British and Americans to contain the Soviets, in return for a united India. But his distrust for American capitalism came in the way. He was more interested in following a lofty foreign policy of fighting colonialism and apartheid than dousing existential fires at home. This greatly embarrassed Britain. He was excited by the prospect of mediating peace between the East and the West. By appealing to the deep felt urges of mankind for freedom, equality, and peace, he believed that he could leave his imprimatur on the world stage. He should have learned that behind lofty declarations countries followed predatory self-interest. These ideas would not persuade the British to abandon the Pakistan scheme.\n\nAll in all, this is a tragic tale of a great civilization squeezed out of its essence. It is not surprising that even the journey to reclaim what is its due is so uphill. A tale of a people who have a fantastic blueprint within their own culture but are unable to access it because of a million broken narratives.\n\nA Doha from Kabir is very apt to describe this conundrum:\n\n*Pani beech meen piyasi*\n\n*mohe sun sun aave haansi*\n\nA thirsty fish looks for water everywhere, all the time surrounded by it.

<li>Title: 'The Mitrokhin Archive &mdash; The Special Relationship With India [Part 1: The supremacy of the Indian National Congress]'<br />Body: 'What is The Mitrokhin Archive?\n\nThe "Mitrokhin Archive" is a collection of handwritten notes made secretly by KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin during his thirty years as a KGB archivist in the foreign intelligence service and the First Chief Directorate. When he defected to the United Kingdom in 1992 he brought the archive with him. [The Mitrokhin Archive Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitrokhin_Archive#India_inquiry)\n\nA chapter from the book &lsquo;The Mitrokhin Archive II: The KGB and the World\' shows that Indira Gandhi was on the payroll of KGB. The whole nation was on the payroll of KGB and even ISI. Indira was put in place by murdering Lal Bahadur Shastri, the second PM of India, by the KGB.\n\n# The Special Relationship With India\n\n**Part 1: The supremacy of the Indian National Congress**\n\nThe Third World country on which the KGB eventually concentrated most operational effort during the Cold War was India. Under Stalin, however, India had been regarded as an imperialist puppet. The Great Soviet Encyclopedia dismissed Mohandas \'Mahatma\' Gandhi, who led India to independence in 1947, as \'a reactionary&hellip;. who betrayed the people and helped the imperialists against them; aped the ascetics; pretended in a demagogic way to be a supporter of Indian independence and an enemy of the British; and widely exploited religious prejudice\'. Despite his distaste for Stalinist attacks Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of independent India, \'had no doubt that the Soviet revolution had advanced human society by a great leap and had lit a bright flame which could not be smothered\'. Though later eulogized by Soviet writers as &lsquo;a leader of international magnitude who ranked \'among the best minds of the twentieth century\', Nehru was well aware that until Stalin\'s death in 1953 he, like Gandhi, was regarded as a reactionary. During the early years of Indian independence, secret correspondence from Moscow to the Communist Party of India (CPI) was frequently intercepted by the Intelligence Branch (IB) in New Delhi (as it had been when the IB was working for the British Raj). According to the head of the IB, B. N. Mullik, until the early 1950s \'every instruction that had issued from Moscow had expressed the necessity and importance \\[for\\] the Indian Communist Party to overthrow the "reactionary" Nehru Government\'. Early in 1951 Mullik gave Nehru a copy of the latest exhortations from Moscow to the CPI, which contained a warning that they must not fall into government hands. Nehru \'laughed out loud and remarked that Moscow apparently did not know how smart our Intelligence was\'.\n\nNeither Nehru nor the IB, however, realized how thoroughly the Indian embassy in Moscow was being penetrated by the KGB, using its usual varieties of the honey trap. The Indian diplomat PROKHOR (code name given for the Indian by KGB) was recruited, probably in the early 1950s, with the help of a female swallow (a female Russian prostitute/spy), codenamed NEVEROVA, who presumably seduced him. The KGB was clearly pleased with the material which PROKHOR provided, which included on two occasions the embassy code-book and deciphering tables, since in 1954 it increased his monthly payments from 1,000 to 4,000 rupees. Another Indian diplomat, RADAR, was recruited in 1956, also with the assistance of a swallow, who on this occasion claimed (probably falsely) to be pregnant. A third KGB swallow persuaded a cipher clerk in the Indian embassy, ARTUR, to go heavily into debt in order to make it easier to compromise him. He was recruited as an agent in 1957 after being trapped (probably into illegal currency dealing) by a KGB officer posing as a black-marketeer. As a result of these and other penetrations of the embassy, Soviet code breakers were probably able to decrypt substantial numbers of Indian diplomatic communications.\n\nAs KGB operations in India expanded during the 1950s and 1960s, the Centre seems to have discovered the extent of the IB\'s previous penetration of the CPI. According to a KGB report, an investigation into Promode Das Gupta, who became secretary of the Bengal Communist Party in 1959, concluded that he had been recruited by the IB in 1947. Further significant IB penetrations were discovered in the Kerala and Madras parties. By the 1960s KGB penetration of the Indian intelligence community and other parts of its official bureaucracy had enabled it to turn the tables on the IB. After the KGB became the main conduit for both money and secret communications from Moscow, high-level IB penetration of the CPI (Communist Party of India) became much more difficult. As in other Communist parties, this secret channel was known only to a small inner circle within the leadership. In 1959 the CPI General Secretary, Ajoy Ghosh, agreed With the Delhi residency on plans to fund an import-export business for trade with the Soviet bloc, headed by a senior Party member codenamed DED, whose profits would be creamed off for "party funds&rdquo;. Within little more than a decade its annual profits had grown to over 3 million rupees. The Soviet news agency Novosti provided further subsidies by routinely paying the CPI publishing House at a rate 50 percent above its normal charges.\n\nMoscow\'s interest in Nehru was greatly enhanced by his emergence (together with Nasser and Tito) as one of the leaders of the Non-Aligned Movement, which began to take shape at the Bandung Conference in 1955, An exchange of official visits in the same year by Nehru and Khrushchev opened a new era in Indo-Soviet relations. On his return from India in December, Khrushchev reported to the Presidium that he had received a warm welcome, but criticized the \'primitive\' portrayal of India in Soviet publications and films which demonstrated a poor grasp of Indian culture. Khrushchev was, however, clearly pleased with the intelligence and personal security provided by the KGB during his trip and proposed that the officers concerned be decorated and considered for salary increases American reliance on Pakistan as a strategic counterweight to Soviet influence in Asia encouraged India to turn to the USSR. In 1956 Nehru declared that he had never encountered a \'grosser case of naked aggression\' than the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, but failed to condemn the brutal Soviet suppression of the Hungarian Uprising in the same year. India voted against a UN resolution calling for free elections in Hungary and the withdrawal of Soviet forces. The Kremlin increasingly valued Indian support as, with growing frequency, the Non-Aligned Movement tended to vote in the UN with the Soviet bloc rather than the West. During the 1960s India and the Soviet Union found further common cause against Mao\'s China.\n\nWithin Nehru\'s Congress Party government the KGB set out to cultivate its leading left-wing firebrand and Nehru\'s close adviser, Krishna Menon, who became Minister of Defense in 1957 after spending most of the previous decade as, successively, Indian High Commissioner in London and representative at the United Nations. To the Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei Gromyko, \'It was&hellip;&hellip;. plain that \\[Menon\\] was personally friendly to the Soviet Union. He would say to me heatedly: "You cannot imagine the hatred the Indian people felt and stiff feel to the colonialists, the British&hellip;&hellip; The methods used by American capital to exploit the backward countries may be oblique, but they\'re just as harsh."\n\nIn May 1962 the Soviet Presidium (which under Khrushchev replaced the Politburo) authorized the KGB residency in New Delhi to conduct active-measures operations designed to strengthen Menon\'s position in India and enhance his personal popularity, probably in the hope that he would become Nehru\'s successor. During Menon\'s tenure of the Defense Ministry, India\'s main source of arms imports switched from the West to the Soviet Union. The Indian decision in the summer of 1962 to purchase MiG-21s rather than British Lightnings was due chiefly to Menon. The British High Commissioner in New Delhi reported to London, &ldquo;Krishna Menon has from the beginning managed to surround this question with almost conspiratorial official and ministerial secrecy combined with a skillful putting about of stories in favour of the MiG and against Western aircraft&rdquo;. Menon\'s career, however, was disrupted by the Chinese invasion of India in October 1961. Having failed to take the prospect of invasion seriously until the eve of the attack, Menon found himself made the scapegoat for India\'s unpreparedness. Following the rout of Indian forces by the Chinese, Nehru reluctantly dismissed him on 31 October. A fortnight later, the Presidium authorized active measures by the Delhi residency, including secret finance for a newspaper which supported Menon, in a forlorn attempt to resuscitate his political career. Though similar active measures by the KGB in Menon\'s favour before the 1967 election also had little observable effect, a secret message to Menon from the CPSU Central Committee (probably sent by its International Department) expressed appreciation for his positive attitude to the Soviet Union.\n\nKGB support did little to revive Menon\'s fortunes. Before he became Defense Minister, most of his political career had been spent outside India, including twenty eight years in Britain, where he had served for more than a decade as a Labour councilor in London. As a result, despite the personal support of some ardent disciples within the Congress Party (at least one of whom received substantial KGB funding) Menon lacked any real popular following in India itself. By the time he returned to India from foreign exiles the only language he spoke was English, he could no longer tolerate spicy Indian food and he preferred a tweed jacket and flannel trousers to traditional Indian dress. After failing to be denominated by Congress in his existing Bombay constituency for the 1967 election, Menon stood unsuccessfully as an independent. Two years later, with Communist support, he was elected as an independent in West Bengal. Some of the issues on which he campaigned suggest that he had been influenced by KGB active measures-as, for example, in his demand that American troops in Vietnam be tried for genocide and his claim that they were slitting open the wombs of pregnant women to expose their unborn babies. Well before his death in 1974, however, Menon had ceased to be an influential voice in Indian politics.\n\nFollowing Menon\'s political eclipse, Moscow\'s preferred candidate to succeed Nehru after his death in May 1964, was Gulzarilal Nanda, Home Minister and number two in the cabinet. The Delhi residency was ordered to do all it could to further his candidature but to switch support to Lal Bahadur Shastri, also a close associate of Nehru, if Nanda\'s campaign failed. There is no indication in the files noted by Mitrokhin that the KGB was in contact with either Nanda or Shastri. Moscow\'s main reason for supporting them was almost certainly, negative rather than positive-to prevent the right-wing Hindu traditionalist Morarji Desai, who began each day by drinking a glass of his own urine (a practice extolled in ancient Indian medical treatises), from succeeding Nehru. In the event, after Desai had been persuaded to withdraw reluctantly from the contest, Shastri became Prime Minister with the unanimous backing of Congress. Following Shastri\'s sudden death in January 1966, the cabal of Congress leaders (the \'Syndicate&rsquo;) chose Nehru\'s daughter, Indira Gandhi (codenamed VANO by the KGB), as his successor in the mistaken belief that she would prove a popular figurehead whom they could manipulate at will.\n\nThe KGB\'s first prolonged contact with Indira Gandhi had occurred during her first visit to the Soviet Union a few months after Stalin\'s death in 1953. As well as keeping her under continuous surveillance, the Second Chief Directorate also surrounded her with handsome, attentive male admirers. Unaware of the orchestration of her welcome by the KGB, Indira was overwhelmed by the attentions lavished on her. Though she did not mention the male admirers in letters to her father, she wrote to him, \'Everybody-the Russians-have been so sweet to me... I am being treated like everybody\'s only daughter-I shall be horribly spoilt by the time I leave. Nobody has ever been so nice to me.\' Indira wrote of a holiday arranged for her on the Black Sea, &lsquo;I don\'t think I have had such a holiday for years&rsquo;. Later, in Leningrad, she told Nehru that she was \'wallowing in luxury\'. Two years later Indira accompanied her father on his first official visit to the Soviet Union. Like Nehru, she was visibly impressed by the apparent successes of Soviet planning and economic modernization exhibited to them in carefully stage-managed visits to Russian factories. During her trip, Khrushchev presented her with a mink coat which became one of the favorite items in her wardrobe-despite the fact that a few years earlier she had criticized the female Indian ambassador in Moscow for accepting a similar gift.\n\nSoviet attempts to cultivate Indira Gandhi during the 1950s were motivated far more by the desire to influence her father than by any awareness of her own political potential. Like both the Congress Syndicate and the CPI, Moscow still underestimated her when she became Prime Minister. During her early appearances in parliament, Mrs. Gandhi seemed tongue-tied and unable to think on her feet. The insulting nickname coined by a socialist MP, \'Dumb Doll&rsquo; began to stick. Moscow\'s strategy during 1966 for the Indian elections in the following year was based on encouraging the CPI and the breakaway Communist Party of India, Marxist (CPM) to join together in a left-wing alliance to oppose Mrs. Gandhi and the Congress government. As well as subsidizing the CPI and some other left-wing groups during the 1967 election campaign, the KGB also funded the campaigns of several agents and confidential contacts within Congress. The most senior agent identified in the files noted by Mitrokhin was a minister codenamed ABAD, who was regarded by the KGB as \'extremely influential\'.\n\nDuring the election campaign, the KGB also made considerable use of active measures, many of them based on forged American documents produced by Service A. An agent in the information department of the US embassy in New Delhi, codenamed MIKHAIL, provided examples of documents and samples of signatures to assist in the production of convincing forgeries. Among the operations officers who publicized the forgeries produced for the 1967 election campaign was Yuri Modin, former controller of the Cambridge \'Magnificent Five\'. In an attempt to discredit S.K. Patil, one of the leading anti-Communists in the Congress Syndicate, Modin circulated a forged letter from the US consul-general in Bombay to the American ambassador in New Delhi referring to Patil&rsquo;s political intrigues with the Pakistanis\' and to the large American subsidies supposedly given to him. Though Patil was one of the most senior Congress politicians defeated at the election, it remains difficult to assess how much his defeat owed to KGB active measures. Modin also publicized a bogus telegram to London from the British High Commissioner, John Freeman, reporting that the United States was giving vast sums to right-wing parties and politicians. The fact that the KGB appears to have had no agent like MIKHAIL in the High Commission, however, led Service A on this occasion to make an embarrassing error. Its forgery mistakenly described the British High Commissioner as Sir John Freeman.\n\nOther Service A fabrications had much greater success. Among them was a forged letter purporting to come from Gordon Goldstein of the US Office of Naval Research and revealing the existence of (in reality non-existent) American bacteriological warfare weapons in Vietnam and Thailand. Originally published in the Bombay &lsquo;Free Press Journal&rsquo;, the letter was reported in the London &lsquo;Times&rsquo; on 7 March 1968 and used by Moscow Radio in broadcasts beamed at Asia as proof that the United States had spread epidemics in Vietnam. The Indian weekly &lsquo;Blitz&rsquo; headlined a story based on the same forgery, &lsquo;US Admits Biological and Nuclear Warfare\'. Goldstein\'s signature and official letterhead were subsequently discovered to have been copied from an invitation to an international scientific symposium circulated by him the previous year.\n\nAfter the elections of February 1967, the KGB claimed, doubtless optimistically, that it was able to influence 30 to 40 percent of the new parliament. Congress lost 21 percent of its seats. The conflict between Indira Gandhi and her chief rival Morarji Desai made its forty-four-seat majority precarious and obliged her to accept Desai as Deputy Prime Minister. By 1968 Desai and Kamaraj, the head of the Syndicate, were agreed on the need to replace Mrs. Gandhi. Congress was moving inexorably towards a split.\n\nDuring 1969 there were major policy reorientations in both Moscow and Delhi. The growing threat from China persuaded the Kremlin to make a special relationship with India the basis of its South Asian policy. Simultaneously, Mrs. Gandhi set out to secure left-wing support against the Syndicate. In July 1969 she nationalized fourteen commercial banks. Desai was sacked as Finance Minister and resigned as Deputy Prime Minister- Encouraged by Moscow, the CPI swung its support behind Mrs. Gandhi. By infiltrating its members and sympathizers into the left-wing Congress Forum for Socialist Action (codenamed SECTOR by the KGB), the CPI set out to gain a position of influence within the ruling party. In November the Syndicate declared Mrs. Gandhi guilty of defiance of the Congress leadership and dismissed her from the: parry, which then split in two: Congress (O), which followed the Syndicate line, and Congress (R), which supported Mrs. Gandhi. The Syndicate hinted that Mrs. Gandhi intended to \'sell\' India to the Soviet Union and was using her principal private secretary, Parmeshwar Narain Haksar, as a direct link with Moscow and the Soviet embassy.\n\nFrom 1967 to 1973 Haksar, a former prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Krishna Menon, was Mrs. Gandhi\'s most trusted adviser. One of her biographers, Katherine Frank, describes him as \'a magnetic figure\' who became \'probably the most influential and powerful person in the government\' as well as \'the most important civil servant in the country\'. Haksar set out to turn a civil service which at least in principle, was politically neutral into an ideologically \'committed bureaucracy\'. His was the hand that guided Mrs. Gandhi through her turn to the left, the nationalization of the banks and the split in the Congress Party, It was Haksar also who was behind the transfer of control of the intelligence community to the Prime Minister\'s Secretariat. His advocacy of the leftward turn in Mrs. Gandhi\'s policies sprang, however, from his socialist convictions rather than from manipulation by the KGB. But both he and Mrs. Gandhi \'were less fastidious than Nehru had been about interfering with the democratic system and structure of government to attain their ideological ends\'. The journalist Inder Malhotra noted the growth of a &lsquo;courtier culture\' in Indira Gandhi\'s entourage: \'The power centre in the world\'s largest democracy was slowly turning into a durbar\'. At the elections of February 1971 Mrs. Gandhi won a landslide victory. With seventy seats more than the undivided Congress had won in 1967, her Congress (R) had a two-thirds majority. The Congress Forum for Socialist Action had the support of about 100 MPs in the new parliament. Mrs. Gandhi made its most vocal spokesman, the former Communist Mohan Kumaramangalam, Minister of Mines; one of his first acts was the nationalization of the coal industry. Kumaramangalam seemed to be implementing a \'thesis\' which he had first argued in 1964: that since the CPI could not win power by itself, as many of its members and sympathizers as possible should join the Congress, make common cause with \'progressive\' Congressmen and compel the party leadership to implement socialist policies. Another leading figure in the Congress Forum for Socialist Action was recruited in 1971 as Agent RERO and paid about 100,000 rupees a year for what the KGB considered important political intelligence as well as acting as an agent recruiter. His controllers included the future head of the FCD, Leonid Shebarshin (codenamed VERNOV).\n\nIn August 1971 Mrs. Gandhi signed a Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Co-operation with the Soviet Union, According to the Permanent Secretary at the Indian Foreign Office, T.N. Kaul, it was one of the few closely guarded secret negotiations that India has ever conducted. On \\[the Indian\\] side, hardly half a dozen people were aware of it, including the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. The media got no scent of it. A delighted Gromyko declared at the signing ceremony, &lsquo;The significance of the Treaty cannot be over-estimated.\' Mrs. Gandhi\'s popularity among the Soviet people, he later claimed, was demonstrated by the large number of Soviet babies who were given the unusual name Indira. The Soviet Union seemed to be guaranteed the support of the leading power in the Non-Aligned Movement. Both countries immediately issued a joint communiqu&eacute; calling for the withdrawal of US troops from Vietnam. India was able to rely on Soviet arms supplies and diplomatic support in the conflict against Pakistan which was already in the offing. According to Leonid Shebarshin, who was posted to New Delhi as head of Line PR (political intelligence) at a time when \'Soviet military Technology was flowing into India in an endless stream\', the Centre-unlike many in the Foreign Ministry-concluded that war was inevitable. Shebarshin realized that war had begun when the lights went out in the middle of a diplomatic reception at the Soviet embassy on 2 December. Looking out of the window, Shebarshin saw that the power cut affected the whole of the capital. Leaving the embassy hurriedly, he drove to a phone box some way away to ring a member of the residency\'s agent network who confirmed that hostilities had started. Another member of the network arranged a meeting between Shebarshin and a senior Indian military commander:\n\nIt would fit an understatement to say that the general\'s mood was optimistic. He knew precisely when and how the war would end: on 16 December with the surrender of Dacca \\[later renamed Dhaka\\] and capitulation of the Pakistani army \\[in East Pakistan\\]... They were in no stare to resist and would not defend Dacca, because they had no one from whom to expect help. \'We know the Pakistani army\', my interlocutor said, &lsquo;Any professional soldiers would behave the same way in their place\'.\n\nDespite diplomatic support from both the United States and China, Pakistan suffered a crushing defeat in the fourteen-day war with India. East Pakistan gained independence as Bangladesh, West Pakistan, reduced to a nation of only 55 million people, could no longer mount a credible challenge to India. For most Indians it was Mrs. Gandhi&rsquo;s finest hour. A Soviet diplomat at the United Nations exulted, &lsquo;This is the first time in history that the United States and China have been defeated together!\'\n\nIn the Centre, the Indo-Soviet special relationship was also celebrated as a triumph for the KGB. The residency in New Delhi was rewarded by being upgraded to the status of \'main residency\'. Its head from 1970 to 1975, Yakov Prokofyevich Medyanik, was accorded the title of \'main resident\', while the heads of Lines PR (political intelligence), KR (counter-intelligence) and X (scientific and technological intelligence) were each given the rank of resident-not, as elsewhere, deputy resident. Medyanik also had overall supervision of three other residencies, located in the Soviet consulates at Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, In the early 1970s, the KGB presence in India became one of the largest in the world outside the Soviet bloc, Indira Gandhi placed no limit on the number of Soviet diplomats and trade officials, thus allowing the KGB and GRU as many cover positions as they wished. Nor, like many other states, did India object to admitting Soviet intelligence officers who had been expelled by less hospitable regimes. The expansion of KGB operations in the Indian subcontinent (and first and foremost in India) during the early 1970s led the FCD to create a new department. Hitherto operations in India, as in the rest of non-Communist South and South-East Asia, had been the responsibility of the Seventh Department. In 1974 the newly founded Seventeenth Department was given charge of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nOleg Kalugin, who became head of FCD Directorate K (Counter-intelligence) in 1973, remembers India as \'a model of KGB infiltration of a Third World government\': \'We had scores of sources throughout the Indian government-in intelligence, counter-intelligence, the Defense and Foreign Ministries, and the police\'. In Directorate K, whose responsibilities included the penetration of foreign intelligence and security agencies, was running, through Line KR in the Indian residencies, over thirty agents &mdash; ten of whom were Indian intelligence officers. Kalugin recalls one occasion on which Andropov personally turned down an offer from an Indian minister to provide information in return for $50,000 on the grounds that the KGB was already well supplied with material from the Indian Foreign and Defense Ministries. It seemed like the entire country was for sale; the KGB-and the CIA-had deeply penetrated the Indian government. After a while neither side entrusted sensitive information to the Indians, realizing their enemy would know all about it the next day.\n\nThe KGB, in Kalugin\'s view, was more successful than the CIA, partly because of its skill in exploiting the corruption which became endemic under Indira Gandhi\'s regime. As Inder Malhotra noted, though corruption was not new in India:\n\nPeople expected Indira Gandhi\'s party, committed to bringing socialism to the country, to be more honest and cleaner than the old undivided Congress, But this turned out to be a vain hope. On the contrary, compared with the amassing of wealth by some of her close associates, the misdeeds of the discarded Syndicate leaders once looked upon as godfathers of corrupt Congressmen, began to appear trivial.\n\nSuitcases full of banknotes were said to be routinely taken to the Prime Minister\'s house. Former Syndicate member S.K. Patil is reported to have said that Mrs. Gandhi did not even return the suitcases.\n\nThe Prime Minister is unlikely to have paid close attention to the dubious origins of some of the funds which went into Congress\'s coffers. That was a matter which she left largely to her principal fundraiser, Lalit Narayan Mishra, who-though she doubtless did not realize it also accepted Soviet money. On at least one occasion a secret gift of 2 million rupees from the Politburo to Congress (R) was personally delivered after midnight by the head of Line PR in New Delhi, Leonid Shebarshin. Another million rupees were given on the same occasion to a newspaper which supported Mrs. Gandhi. Short and obese with several chins, Mishra looked the part of the corrupt politician he increasingly became. Indira Gandhi, despite her own frugal lifestyle, depended on the money he collected from a variety of sources to finance Congress (R). So did her son and anointed heir, Sanjay, whose misguided ambition to build an Indian popular car and become India\'s Henry Ford depended on government favours, When Mishra was assassinated in 1975, Mrs. Gandhi blamed a plot involving \'foreign elements&rsquo;, a phrase which she doubtless intended as a euphemism for the CIA. The New Delhi main residency gave his widow 70,000 rupees from its active-measures budget. Though there were some complaints from the CPI leadership at the use of Soviet funds to support Mrs. Gandhi and Congress (R), 60 covert funding for the CPI seems to have been unaffected. By 1972 the import-export business founded by the CPI a decade earlier to trade with the Soviet Union had contributed more than 10 million rupees to Party funds. Other secret subsidies, totaling at least 1.5 million rupees, had gone to state Communist parties, individuals and media associated with the CPI. The funds which were sent from Moscow to Party headquarters via the KGB were larger still. In the first six months of 1975 alone they amounted to over 2.5 million rupees.\n\nIn the mid-1970s Soviet funds for the CPI were passed by operations officers of the New Delhi main residency to a senior member of the Party\'s National Council codenamed BANKIR at a number of different locations. The simplest transfers of funds occurred when KGB officers under diplomatic cover had a pretext to visit BANKIR\'s office, such as his briefings for visiting press delegations from the Soviet bloc. Other arrangements, however, were much more complex- One file noted by Mitrokhin records a fishing expedition to a lake not far from Delhi arranged to provide cover for a transfer of funds to BANKIR. Shebarshin and two operations officers from the main residency left the embassy at 6.30 a.m., arrived at about 8 a.m. and spent two and a half hours fishing. At 10.30 a.m. they left the lake and headed to an agreed rendezvous point with BANKIR, making visual contact with his car at 11.15. As the residency car overtook his on a section of the road which could not be observed from either side, packages of banknotes were passed through the open window of BANKlR\'s car. Rajeshwar Rao, general secretary of the CPI from 1964 to 1990, subsequently provided receipts for the sums received. Further substantial sums went to the Communist-Led All-India Congress of Trade Unions, headed by S.A. Dange.\n\nIndia under Indira Gandhi was also probably the arena for more KGB active measures than anywhere else in the world, though their significance appears to have been considerably exaggerated by the Centre, which overestimated its ability to manipulate Indian opinion. According to KGB files, by 1973 it had ten Indian newspapers on its payroll (which cannot be identified for legal reasons) as well as a press agency under its control. During 1972 the KGB claimed to have planted 3,789 articles in Indian newspapers-probably more than in any other country in the non-Communist world. According to its files, the number fell to 2,760 in 1973 but rose to 4,486 in 1974 and 5,510 in 1975.66 In some major NATO countries, despite active-measures campaigns, the KGB was able to plant little more than 1 percent of the articles which it placed in the Indian press.\n\nAmong the KGB\'s leading confidential contacts in the press was one of India\'s most influential journalists, codenamed NOK, Recruited as a confidential contact in 1976 by A.A. Arkhipov, NOK was subsequently handled by two Line PR officers operating under journalistic cover: first A.I. Khachaturian, officially a Trud correspondent, then V.N. Cherepakhin of the Novosti news agency. NOK\'s file records that he published material favorable to the Soviet Union and provided information on the entourage of Indira Gandhi. Contact with him ceased in 1980 as a result of his deteriorating health. Though not apparently aware of the KGB\'s involvement in the active-measures campaign, P.N. Dhar believed that the left was \'manipulating the press... to keep Mrs. Gandhi committed to their ideological line\'. India was also one of the most favorable environments for Soviet front organizations. From 1966 to 1986 the head of the most important of them, the World Peace Council (WPC), was the Indian Communist Romesh Chandra. In his review of the 1960s at the WPC-sponsored World Peace Congress I, Chandra denounced \'the US-dominated NATO\' as \'the greatest threat to peace\' across the world: \'The fangs of NATO can be felt in Asia and Africa as well \\[as Europe\\]&hellip; The forces of imperialism and exploitation, particularly NATO... bear the responsibility for the hunger and poverty of hundreds of millions all over the world.\'\n\nThe KGB was also confident of its ability to organize mass demonstrations in Delhi and other major cities. In 1969, for example Andropov informed the Politburo, \'The KGB residency in India has the opportunity to organize a protest demonstration of up to 20,000 Muslims in front of the US embassy in India-The cost of the demonstration would be 5,000 rupees and would be covered in the... budget for special tasks in India. I request consideration\'. Brezhnev wrote \'Agreed\' on Andropov\'s request. In April 1971, two months after Mrs. Gandhi\'s landslide election victory, the Politburo approved the establishment of a secret fund of 1.5 million convertible rubles (codenamed DEPO) to fund active-measures operations in India over the next four years. During that period KGB reports from New Delhi claimed on slender evidence, to have assisted the success of Congress (R) in elections to state assemblies.\n\nAmong the most time-consuming active measures implemented by Leonid Shebarshin as head of Line PR were the preparations for Brezhnev\'s state visit in 1973. As usual it was necessary to ensure that the General Secretary was received with what appeared to be rapturous enthusiasm and to concoct evidence that his platitudinous speeches were hailed as \'major political statements of tremendous importance\'. Since Brezhnev was probably the dreariest orator among the world\'s major statesmen this was no easy task, particularly when he traveled outside the Soviet bloc. Soviet audiences were used to listening respectfully to his long-winded utterances and to bursting into regular, unwarranted applause. Indian audiences, however, lacked the experience of their Soviet counterparts. Brezhnev would have been affronted by any suggestion that he deliver only a short address, since he believed in a direct correlation between the length of a speech and the prestige of the speaker. His open-air speech in the great square in front of Delhi\'s famous Red Fort, where Nehru had declared Indian independence twenty-six years earlier, thus presented a particular challenge. According to possibly inflated KGB estimates, 2 million people were present-perhaps the largest audience to whom Brezhnev had ever spoken. As Shebarshin later acknowledged, the speech was extraordinarily long winded and heavy going. The embassy had made matters even worse by translating the speech into a form of high Hindi which was incomprehensible to most of the audience. As the speech droned on and night began to fall, some of the audience started to drift away but, according to Shebarshin, were turned back by the police for fear of offending the Soviet leader. Though even Brezhnev sensed that not all was well, he was later reassured by the practiced sycophants in his entourage.\n\nShebarshin was able to persuade both himself and the Centre that the visit as a whole had been a great success. The KGB claimed much of the credit for \'creating favorable conditions\' for Brezhnev\'s Indian triumph.\n\nLeonid Shebarshin\'s perceived success in active measures as head of Line PR almost certainly helps to explain his promotion to the post of main resident in 1975 and launched him on a career which in 1988 took him to the leadership of the FCD. In a newspaper interview after his retirement from the KGB, Shebarshin spoke \'nostalgically about the old days, about disinformation- forging documents, creating sensations for the press\'. It was doubtless his days in India which he had chiefly in mind. Among the KGB\'s most successful active measures were those which claimed to expose CIA plots in the subcontinent. The Centre was probably right to claim the credit for persuading Indira Gandhi that the Agency was plotting her overthrow. In November 1973 she told Fidel Castro at a banquet in New Delhi, \'What they \\[the CIA\\] have done to Allende they want to do to me also. There are people here, connected with the same foreign forces that acted in Chile, who would like to eliminate me.\' She did not question Castro\'s (and the KGB\'s) insistence that Allende had been murdered in cold blood by Pinochet\'s US-backed troops. The belief that the Agency had marked her out for the same fate as Allende became something of an obsession. In an obvious reference to (accurate) American claims that, in reality, Allende had turned his gun on himself during the storming of his palace, Mrs. Gandhi declared, \'When I am murdered, they will say I arranged it myself\'.\n\nMrs. Gandhi was also easily persuaded that the CIA, rather than the mistakes of her own administration, was responsible for the growing opposition to her government. Early in 1974 riots in Gujarat, which killed over 100 people, led to 8,000 arrests and caused the dissolution of the State Assembly, reinforced her belief In an American conspiracy against her. Irritated by a series of speeches by Mrs. Gandhi denouncing the ever-present menace of CIA subversion, the US ambassador in New Delhi, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, ordered an investigation which uncovered two occasions during her father\'s premiership when the CIA had secretly provided funds to help the Communists\' opponents in state elections, once in Kerala (money provided to the Christian church for the \'Vimochana Samaram\') and once in West Bengal- According to Moynihan: \n\nBoth times the money was given to the Congress Party which had asked for it-Once it was given to Mrs. Gandhi herself, who was then a party official.\n\nStill, as we were no longer giving any money to her it was understandable that she should wonder to whom we were giving it. It is not a practice to be encouraged.\n\nA brief visit to India by Henry Kissinger in October 1974 provided another opportunity for a KGB active-measures campaign. Agents of influence were given further fabricated stories about CIA conspiracies to report to the Prime Minister and other leading figures in the government and parliament. The KGB claimed to have planted over seventy stories in the Indian press condemning CIA subversion as well as initiating letter-writing and poster campaigns. The Delhi main residency claimed that, thanks to its campaign, Mrs. Gandhi had raised the question of CIA operations in India during her talks with Kissinger.\n\nOn 28 April 1975 Andropov approved a further Indian active-measures operation to publicize fabricated evidence of CIA subversion. Sixteen packets containing incriminating material prepared by Service A on three CIA officers stationed under diplomatic cover at the US embassy were sent anonymously by the Delhi residency to the media and gave rise to a series of articles in the Indian press. According to KGB files, Mrs. Gandhi sent a personal letter to the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, enclosing some of the KGB\'s forged CIA documents and a series of articles in Indian newspapers which had been taken in by them. The same files report that Mrs. Bandaranaike concluded that CIA subversion posed such a serious threat to Sri Lanka that she set up a committee of investigation.\n\nOne of Mrs. Gandhi\'s critics, Piloo Moody, ridiculed her obsession with CIA subversion by wearing around his neck a medallion with the slogan, \'I am a CIA agent\'. For Mrs. Gandhi, however, the Agency was no laughing matter. By the summer of 1975 her suspicions of a vast conspiracy by her political opponents, aided and abetted by the CIA, had, in the opinion of her biographer Katherine Frank, grown to \'something close to paranoia\'. Her mood was further darkened on 12 June by a decision of the Allahabad High Court, against which she appealed, invalidating her election as MP on the grounds of irregularities in the 1971 elections. A fortnight later she persuaded both the President and the cabinet to agree to the declaration of a state of emergency. &nbsp;\n\n(to be continued)'<br />Author: 'TheInsaneM'<br />id: 'fg0s7j' &nbsp;num_comments: 6 &nbsp;score: 1</li>
<li>Title: 'How Communists tried to destroy Indian culture.'<br />Body: 'Communists are never exhausted from harping on lofty ideals like democracy and democratic institutions, yet they are the worst destroyers of those very values and institutions raised to protect and nourish them. They are the worst tormentors of civility and culture and why not? The Gods they worship and hang photo frames thereof in their offices are Karl Marx/Lenin/Stalin who espoused violence of every conceivable order/nature to realize their goals and the Doctrine of Violence happens to be very close to their hearts and souls. Founder of the Marxist cult, Karl Marx declared religion to be the opium of masses intoxicating them into artificial/superficial joy. However, does Marxist cult do anything other than poisoning / destroying masses after intoxicating them into false glory of equality?\n\nThere is one more &lsquo;luminary&rsquo; whom they adore, copycat his strategies and actions to obfuscate real issues by preparing an insidiously false grand narrative. He happens to be Hitler&rsquo;s Propaganda Minister Goebbels. By denying the existence of issues that have the potential to expose their anti-national, sinister activities or embarrass them for their sins of past and by harping on non-existent issues to confound the unsuspecting, is the Dodger&rsquo;s Art that they have mastered by neatly following Goebbels and his shenanigans. Their nefarious activities have not been brought to the fore as the party that ruled over the country for six decades had been in cahoots with Reds, one of the worst instances of anti-national symbiotic relationships.\n\nBy deriving maximum advantage from their proximity to the ruling establishment, Reds worked out a powerful/well-hinged network of favor-seekers and favor-providers. This nefarious system had been largely responsible to ensure, the nation remained a wretched leader from the bottom in the merit-list of the UN Human Development Index all these years in all disciplines of national reconstruction. Their drum-beating propagandists/acolytes/adherents resort to fantastic arguments viz. &ldquo;inevitable to cleanse the system of bourgeoisie /reactionaries&rdquo; to justify every irrational /anti-national/criminal activity of their unworthiness. Their well-oiled false propaganda-reticulum has tarnished the image of the nation abroad and raised several hurdles in attaining laurels that the nation would have been attained otherwise.\n\nThe recent instance of Comrade Sitaram Yechury accusing BJP/RSS of &ldquo;worming their way into Freedom Movement&rdquo; notwithstanding the facts that they destroyed Gandhi&rsquo;s Quit India Movement in cahoots with British-Occupiers and always hobnobbed with them, always condemned hard-earned freedom, are yet other stunning pieces of falsehood. They never took up cudgels to discover much to their enlightenment and discomfiture, thousands of RSS members were the foot-soldiers in freedom movement, every RSS shakha individually sent a congratulatory message to JL Nehru when resolution of &lsquo;Purna Swaraj&rsquo; was passed by Congress in 1929, RSS actively participated in Non-Cooperation Movement in 1930, Quit India Movement with the founder Dr. Hedgewar himself very active from Nagpur to Kolkata with Anusilana Samiti and arrested for sedition in May 1921. During trial for sedition, he thundered in court before the Judge, &ldquo;India belongs to Indians. We, therefore, demand independence. This is the content of all my speeches. People have to be told how to secure independence, and also how to conduct themselves after securing it. What law is there that gives one country the right to rule over the other? I am asking you, the Counsel for Government, this simple and straight question. Can you answer it? Is it not that against natural justice? If it is true that no country has a right to rule over another country, who gave the British the authority to trample the people of India under their feet? How can they enslave us and declare that they own this country? Is it not the most blatant murder of justice, morality and Dharma? Our mind revolts at the thought of remaining the slaves of the British Empire and carrying that stigma for all time. We demand nothing short of complete independence. Till we achieve it we cannot be at peace&hellip;.&rdquo; And Communist Reds periodically declare RSS did nothing to attain independence from British-Occupiers.\n\nReds are so much obsessed with and fear RSS/Hindu Rightists that whenever and wherever their political outfit BJP is installed in power, they begin undergoing all sorts of hallucinations hollering from rooftops on top of their vocal cords, be it education, foreign policy, internal security or any issue under the sun. In the state of Tamil Nadu, they have their vernacular version in DMK who keenly follow their footsteps in berating Hindu-s and Hinduism. The latest instances have been suggestions to observe Hindi Week, Guru-Utsava on Teacher&rsquo;s Day and substitution of German with Samskrita in Central Schools. When Christians sing &ldquo;Oh Jesus, lead us&hellip;&rdquo;, Reds and Dravidians swing to the tune but turn ferociously abusive if Saraswati Vandana is recited. Red-Wolves just hate anything even remotely connected with Hinduism. Hindi movies run for weeks in Tamil Nadu, Dravidian hotheads produce Hindi-hits and progeny of Mother Tamil send their children to English schools even while abusing Hindi uninterruptedly.\n\nMarxist pseudo-historians in cahoots with Nehruvian intellectuals, denigrated all stalwarts of the independence movement, be it Netaji Bose or Sardar Patel. Quite methodically, they established Nehru-Gandhi family as flawless who swear by lofty ideals of democratic values, nourished that through their blood and sweat, others happen to be unworthiness as hangers on to them with a finger in every pie, all achievements of the nation originating from the Dynasty while failures/setbacks crafted by all others. DK Chakravorty, a distinguished historian who taught History / Archaeology at the University of Cambridge, disclosed, &ldquo;Since coming of this group to power, the world of Indian historical studies has been largely criminalized.&rdquo;\n\nReds have executed cultural subversion of the country extensively so much so that what external invaders could not do, was adroitly committed by them. Reds and westernized rootless, intellectuals know the power and strength of Sanskrit and the fear of being rendered worthless by Sanskrit looms large in their minds. NASA has declared Sanskrit as the perfect language for advanced scientific calculations and computer programming. Briggs wrote in the issue of Artificial Intelligence 1985, &ldquo;Sanskrit is the perfect language designed for enlightened communication. It is the one and only unambiguous spoken language in the world.&rdquo; All attempts by Red planted bogus western scholars viz. Wendy Doniger, Arundhati Roy, Sheldon Pollock to defame Hindus and Hinduism have been successfully thwarted so far by a determined group of nationalists whom Reds do not miss even whiff of an opportunity to berate and abuse. Reds do not allow people to believe that the great Hindu civilization adored women, that there were no Dalits /untouchables, that there were no prostitutes at all, that it was an invasion of western bigots that destroyed Hindu civilization and cultural heritage.\n\nSo desperate were they after installation of Modi government in 2014 that they not only engineered murderous assaults on so-called rationalists, the farcical return of awards by literary figures, etc. but also raised the decibel level between two lunatic fringes of society, one faking public opinion and the other, symptomatic of Government policies. They even moved to the extent of declaring; the Idea of India is in a perpetual clash with the Govt. elected with a massive mandate to deliver the Idea of India. It is always that Leftist intellectuals cry wolf loudest. They dread the scenario of losing control of the Indian Council of Historical Research which they monopolize to carry out their nefarious designs of cultural/historical subversions. &lsquo;Eminent Historians&rsquo; authored by Arun Shourie speaks volumes on their &lsquo;trade&rsquo; practices solely meant to perpetuate Red hegemony. Red historian Irfan Habib even went to the extent of castigating revival efforts of the Saraswati river which enjoys enormous value in Vedic wisdom and Hindu civilization. The Marxist historian spent his lifetime proving, the Saraswati river never existed, contrary to all scientific studies, satellite imagery, etc. to the contrary.\n\nFraudulent theory of Aryan Invasion too was propagated Marxists. Also are they hell-bent to negate everything even remotely connected with Sanatana Dharma? Everything good about Hinduism, if at all any, was brought in by Aryan invaders, Alexander brought Vedic wisdom into the country&hellip;and Hindus at best, be remembered for having contributed absolutely nothing. The first activity that Marxists undertake is to destroy entire cultural heritage and convert everyone into empty-headed zombies to create space in their minds so as to allow the venomous doctrine of Marxism to take roots in their minds.\n\nReds deviously supported Jinnah&rsquo;s Direct Action on Aug.16, 1946 and partition of Bharat with the statement in their own words, &ldquo;&hellip;secession would lead to still greater and more glorious unity of India, the like of which India has not seen in her history&rdquo;. They waved many flags viz. Soviet flag, Red flag, Russian flag, then League flag. Whenever Dr. SP Mookerjee, a hard-core nationalist, picked up any issue pertaining to the nation&rsquo;s interest, Reds began howling and yelling from rooftops on top of their voice.\n\nThey ruled over Bengal uninterruptedly for four decades and left the state in tatters, completely pauperized. The State they left behind was infested with anti-national/criminal activities, industrial junkyards, democratic institutions emaciated, education in ruins, then the revelations about electoral malpractices, large-scale booth-capturing, etc. to win elections. They allowed atrocities by Muslims on Hindu-s in the name of secularism, encouraged Bangladeshi infiltrators as their vote-banks destroying entire demography of the State. And when they lost to TMC of Mamata Banerjee, all Reds joined TMC to enjoy a free hand in all matters as ever in addition to a bloodbath of their opponents. In Kerala too, the tale of Reds is almost the same. When they have realized, the ground beneath in Kerala has been slipping away and they are on the verge of decimation, they resorted to uninterrupted killing spree all over the state. Reds in Kerala not only encouraged but also protected missionaries and jihadis in all their nefarious activities.\n\nWherever they have been in power, they deported themselves like monster-killers and when in opposition, they are cunning jackals ever prepared to howl and cry for being the worst victims. They have never been known to undertake any nation-building activity/social work, never in any relief/rehabilitation exercise ever they participated when a natural calamity strikes, never supportive when the nation&rsquo;s integrity had been at stake or ancient cultural heritage threatened.\n\nIf religion is really opium of masses as vouchsafed by Marx, is not Marxism cyanide pill of the same masses?\n\nAn answer on Quora further details how the Communists and the left-wing are destroying India from within:\n\n&amp;gt;If one examines the reasons of why Communism and Communist parties have been unequivocally rejected the world over. He/She will find that there are solid reasons why the communists countries collapsed, have been hounded in many countries, criticized in several others and violently overthrown in countries which they ruled. &nbsp;\nCommunism, as an ideology, is in itself so colossally flawed that it cannot be reformed. In the past, all those who have tried to reform its intrinsic faults, either have been labelled as schismatic or have been mass slaughtered for having expressed dissent. &nbsp;\nThe Left has since quite a while ago utilized the term rightist to malign its adversaries, much as the old Christian church called non-Christians "barbarians" and "blasphemers". Notwithstanding warring Leftist gatherings call their clashing Leftist rivals fascists. European Leftists call the United States a rightist nation. The far Left in America calls the Republican right rightist. &nbsp;\nPresently the Soviet Union has vanished from the scene and the Communist development in India does not know whom to serve. In any case, its antagonistic vibe towards Hindu society and culture stays undiminished. It is quite on the cards that this mercenary outfit will be purchased over, at the appointed time, by some other power or powers antagonistic to positive Indian patriotism. A Communist can\'t resist being a backstabber to his nation and his kin. &nbsp;\n**Yuri Bezmenov, an ex-KGB agent exposes how the Soviet Union utilized the so called Indian pseudo-intellectuals to obliterate India.** He clarifies how the toxin called communism was acquainted in India to keep alive individuals within the Indian community group who could obliterate our cultural and social values from inside. He goes ahead to clarify the part he played for the Soviet Union. He was to watch and keep an eye on the academicians in India, who were propelled by communist standards, welcome them to Russia and mentally program them into decimating our nation. The Soviet Union essentially implemented a well-arranged procedure to indoctrinate an entire country into their convictions and utilize these countries further bolstering their good fortune. &nbsp;\nClearly thinking about it, this was a splendid arrangement by the Soviet operators. A teacher has the ability to impact the youth who are brimming with vitality. A little provocative direction would clearly lead them to take after communism and supporting standards that the Soviet would need them to. &nbsp;\nBezmenov was directed to gradually however without a doubt build up the Soviet style of authority in India. Around the same time, a sector mandate of the Central Committee opened another secret office in all government offices of the Soviet Union around the globe, titled the &ldquo;Research and Counter-Propaganda Group.&rdquo; Bezmenov turned into a deputy chief of that division, which assembled insight from sources like Indian informers and operators, in regards to practically every compelling or the politically noteworthy subject of India. &nbsp;\nAmid that period, progressively observing the Soviet framework as insidious and immoral, Bezmenov cautiously planned to abandon the project. &nbsp;\n**Now think about this carefully, and you will clearly understand why some universities in India like JNU, Aligarh Muslim University, Jadhavpur University, Hyderabad University, etc. are in this state today.** &nbsp;\nThis video might be somewhat long but is nevertheless extremely critical that you unmistakably understand every single word Yuri says. &nbsp;\n[Former KGB Agent Yuri Bezmenov Explains How to Brainwash a Nation (Full Length)](https://youtu.be/5It1zarINv0) &nbsp;\n**The ignominious tale of Indian Communists:** &nbsp;\nWest Bengal and Kerala have essentially conceived the brunt of Communist organizations in India. In both these states, the level of influence of the Communist belief system makes it inconceivable for a contradiction to survive. It was essentially in view of this influence the Communist Party clung to control in West Bengal for almost 4 decades. Universities and Colleges were changed over into caves of political thought. Disagreeing students and lecturers/teachers were bashed to death or crashed into depression and despair. Local comrade chieftains caused repulsive reprisal on the individuals who upheld other political gatherings. Kill, Rape, Arson, Electoral deceit all served as weapons to keep up Communist run the show. In Kerala, fight amongst Communists and RSS has guaranteed many lives. Atheist Communists in Kerala bolstered the reason for Mopalastan (Country for Kerala Muslims) and birthed a Muslim larger part region, Malappuram. Atheist Communists in West Bengal have bolstered the reason for illicit migrants from Bangladesh. Communists in India have upheld each hostility to the nation as their own-Independence of Hyderabad, Opposition to Quit India Movement, Partition of India, Support for China in the 1962 war, etc. They have even bolstered the worldwide Jihad as a freeing, anti-Imperialist development on the planet. What\'s more, now, these godforsaken Leftists have even held hands to contradict Nationalism and patriotism in the nation. Flying the national banner is viewed as a demonstration of incitement, maintaining Indian culture is viewed as an injustice.

Read this and you'll never enter a debate with a ghazi because you'll never find common ground."<br />Body: 'The following excerpt regarding the 1965 war is taken from fifth grade reading material published by the NWFP Textbook Board, Peshawar in 2002 &mdash; &ldquo;The Pakistan Army conquered several areas of India, and when India was at the verge of being defeated she ran to the United Nations to beg for a cease-fire. Magnanimously, thereafter, Pakistan returned all the conquered territories to India.&rdquo;\n\nThe Punjab Textbook Board published the following text on the causes for the separation of East Pakistan in 1993 for secondary classes &mdash; &ldquo;There were a large number of Hindus in East Pakistan. They had never truly accepted Pakistan. A large number of them were teachers in schools and colleges.\n\nThey continued creating a negative impression among students. No importance was attached to explaining the ideology of Pakistan to the younger generation.\n\nThe Hindus sent a substantial part of their earnings to Bharat, thus adversely affecting the economy of the province. Some political leaders encouraged provincialism for selfish gains. They went around depicting the central Government and (the then) West Pakistan as enemy and exploiter. Political aims were thus achieved at the cost of national unity.&rdquo;\n\n\n&ldquo;While the Muslims provided all sorts of help to those non-Muslims desiring to leave Pakistan [during partition], people of India committed atrocities against Muslims trying to migrate to Pakistan. They would attack the buses, trucks and trains carrying the Muslim refugees and murder and loot them.&rdquo; The latter excerpt was taken from an intermediate classes textbook &mdash; Civics of Pakistan, 2000.\n\nSome more examples of totally contorted and misleading, yet ingenious and amusing, narrations of the history of Pakistan can be extracted from a single text, A Textbook of Pakistan Studies by M. D. Zafar.\n\n\n&ldquo;Pakistan came to be established for the first time when the Arabs led by Muhammad bin Qasim occupied Sindh and Multan. Pakistan under the Arabs comprised the Lower Indus Valley.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;During the 11th century the Ghaznavid Empire comprised what is now Pakistan and Afghanistan. During the 12th century the Ghaznavids lost Afghanistan and their rule came to be confined to Pakistan&rdquo;.\n\n\n&ldquo;By the 13th century Pakistan had spread to include the whole of Northern India and Bengal. Under the Khiljis Pakistan moved further South to include a greater part of Central India and the Deccan&rdquo;.\n\n&ldquo;During the 16th century, &lsquo;Hindustan&rsquo; disappeared and was completely absorbed in &lsquo;Pakistan&rdquo;.\n\n&ldquo;Shah Waliullah appealed to Ahmad Shah Durrani of Afghanistan and &lsquo;Pakistan&rsquo; to come to the rescue of the Muslims of Mughal India, and save them from the tyrannies of the Marhattas&hellip;&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;In the Pakistan territories where a Sikh state had come to be established, the Muslims were denied freedom of religion.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Thus by the middle of the 19th century both Pakistan and Hindustan ceased to exist; instead British India came into being. Although Pakistan was created in August 1947, yet except for its name, the present-day Pakistan has existed, as a more or less single entity for centuries.&rdquo;'<br />Author: 'DanaDanDoga'<br />id: 'ejuaig' &nbsp;num_comments: 16 &nbsp;score: 29</li>
<li>Title: '"BJP IT Cell" vs "Reddit IT Cell"'<br />Body: ' So OP in the other "universe" most likely this guy : [https://www.producthunt.com/@onosmosis](https://www.producthunt.com/@onosmosis) , has done twitter account analysis to figure out how many bot account does BJP "IT" cell have. In the process racked up a big bill (well may not for him).\n\nThere are a couple of amusing things about our "batman" boi,\n\na ) He fails to hide his identity through his own post history &amp;amp; then makes a claim his identity is "compromised". A bit like Rakhi Sawant and Mikha Singh controversy. OP being Rakhi Sawant of course. And now makes claims about some death threats. Classic victim card move, like the Islamists, do it. Demand sharia, kill people and when the police enter the scene, just scream "victim victim" till your lungs give out. At first, I thought the guy is just a technical dude without an agenda, respect in that case regardless of whether he was pro or not pro bjp.\n\nb) He goes through in detail on how he went about finding out the bot accounts and the aws setup etc to create this "mini product" only for defeating BJP IT cell by spending 2L. Well, no prizes for guessing better products already exist: For ex: [https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/#!/](https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/#!/) . They analyze more features and would cost far less. So why run "40 aws servers?" . Beyound me.\n\nc) The guy then makes a claim he has no agenda no bias. But "only" choose to run analysis on BJP accounts. Running the same analysis on different political parties would be a logical thing to do and then publish findings so it\'s neutral. So clearly this is targetted against a group in this case BJP as was evident in the post. The problem is this is against twitter rules to target: [https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/enforcement-philosophy](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/enforcement-philosophy) The claim that "BJP IT" cell owns this account NEEDS proof that these accounts were created by them. Just because they benefit them doesn\'t necessarily mean they created it. That part of it also breaks twitter rules.\n\nd) Ever heard of Social media marketing, the guys on fiverr that will promote your product on social media platforms? Right from those small guys to larger social media marketing teams use bots. They have since twitter came out with an API. It is not new, there is no "breaking news" there. The attempt to create this fake narrative of "this evil empire" to create sensation and unrest is a little disappointing. No "coalgate" or "telecom" level scam here or "wikileaks" level stuff here, so let\'s move on.\n\ne) Then batman goes on creating a platform to talk about islamophobia. At a time when, more than 19,000 underage girls were molested by Pakistani origin Muslims, when people in UK are literally taking defence classes and walking in stab-proof vests because they fear a Muslim terrorist will stab them or their family, a paris girl was brutally raped by a muslim "in the name of allah", when Indian congress politicians basically says loyatly is for dogs in essence callling all the freedom fighters and people loyal to the country including armed forces/police/firefighters etc dogs. Batman wants to talk about islamaphoa. Not about the actual suffering of persecuted non-Muslims some of whom faced ISIS style treatment in pakistan.\n\nA more logical thing, a logical person would want to talk about would be:\n\ni) How can CAB be improved(if you disagree with the current form)\n\nii) How can reforms in Islam be bought so we don\'t have another west bengal or kashmir style genocide &amp;amp; reduce the aggression and radicalization in Islam. Logic would say more integration of muslims should reduce a huge number of problems on all ends.\n\nBut no, let\'s talk about how the whole world is wrong and we need to dole out special treatment for Muslims because if the world doesn\'t then the world is Islamaphobic . Surely that solves all the problems. But what do I know, I haven\'t ever run 40 aws servers at the same time. Certainly not m5 instances.'<br />Author: 'LiberatedSoul1984'<br />id: 'eifch7' &nbsp;num_comments: 14 &nbsp;score: 1</li>
