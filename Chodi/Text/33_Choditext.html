Fresh post graduate medical admissions are underway as the medicos in this sub would be aware, MCI regulation sub clause 13.3 states all post graduates must get stipend as prescribed by the respective state authorities (which is about 45K in Karnataka).. But I have learnt that pvt colleges here do not pay stipend or pay miniscule stipend to the PGs and sometimes even take it back during the final year during exam registration in the name of dues , library fee etc .. The college I am in right now has no intention in discharging stipend to the PGs.. here's the thing : non payment of stipend is a serious misconduct and can potentially result in the withdrawl of recognition of the college.. Thats why these shady motherfuckers wont give you in writing that they wont pay you stipend.. Usually the students refrain from legal action due to the fear of backlash from politically connected people in the college board.. My students are mulling legal action and I feel bad about not being able to help them in any concrete way.. However, if you can please tell any medical PG aspirant you can find , that when they get a seat allotted in a Pvt College , do not rush to get admission , call them visit them and ask the administration directly of they would pay the stipend... If possible ask them if they can give it in writing that they would pay stipend.. I know the later is a stretch but still try.. if you find any hesitation in the admistration folks , DO NOT JOIN THAT COLLEGE.. please spread this message as far as you can.. because for three years without any salary and playing exorbitant tution fee the life of these start eyes PGs becomes hell.. They deserve much much better"<br />Author: 'RaktimSoul'<br />id: 'ig547l'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li>
<li>Title: 'I am liberandu turned Viraat Hindu.'<br />Body: "I am new to this sub and identity. I have been for the longest time, a part of the liberandu/liberal circle jerk. In this lockdown I started reading Bibek Debroy's Mahabharata and began lurking on this sub, slowly coming to terms with my new found belief.\n\nI want to ask how can I further explore the Hindu ideology, understand the right from wrong, what literature should I read ? \nAlso I am very keen on reading the Bhagvad Geeta, can someone here recommend the most authentic version.\nP.S. The Swami Prabhupada version is trash imo. It talks about cast division and women's place in the society in the most derogatory manner. Plus ISKCON itself is super shady and I don't want to feel averse about Hinduism again like I have for the longest time.\n\nApologies in advance for any mistakes."<br />Author: 'Fffs_21'<br />id: 'ig376d'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li>

Is the strategy of boycotting Bloomsbury the strategically correct move from our side?\nI think other tactics like pre ordering many copies or forcing other major publications like Penguin to carry the book could be considered. \n\nBtw, I totally stand for the FoE and absolutely want the book published and also want to buy a copy of it."<br />Author: 'isvoltaire'<br />id: 'ifwaia'<br />Flair ::swamivivek: High IQ</li>

<li>Title: 'why I hate Maulana Mudi'<br />Body: 'I bet none of you chods can provide a good explanation for ANY of the points given below:\n\nFake promises: he promised 1 crore jobs each year (people are losing jobs now). He said he will bring back black money in 100 days (100? Why ? Even he knew thats impossible but he still said it). He promised 15 lakh to each person’s account. These are just some of the things he promised. The list is bing\n\nDemonitisation: Almost everybody supported bjp when demonitisation happened. But now even bjp leaders are saying it was mistake.\nTaking credit of everything: ISRO sends satellite in space, creadit goes to modi (people don’t realise scientists were working on those launches since congress time). Court send ram rahim to jail, people thanks modi government for that. Army does sergical strike, BJP uses that in election( I agree sergical strike was idea of modi but using it in future election for votes? This is not the first time our army has taken action, they have done it when congress was in power byt this is the first time a party used work soldiers in elections.\n\nUsing paid media and fake news: You must have heard of IT cell right? Also channels like ABP news,zee news work for BJP. (ZEE news once said 2000 note has chip XD). These paid news channels can’t stop talking about modi and bjp. When they do debates, they clearly take sides of bjp leaders, why they don’t debate on decreased GDP, job loss, failure of GST?\n\nReligious issues: Since bjp came to power you can clearly see a lot of debates related to religion. Latest one is about taj mahal where yogi said taj mahal is not part of india.\n\nPriorities : Why ram mandir, bullet train, shivaji statue, ram statue are our priority? Why? Mumbai don’t want shivaji statue, they want basic things.\nIncreased taxes: fuel prices, train tickets and price of everything has increased.\n\nAnd now my personal reason\n\nDid nothing in health and education sector. Nothing. India needs more hospitals, quality education but they are doing nothing.'<br />Author: 'ityfmu'<br />id: 'ifkz79'<br />Flair ::HighIQ: Randia Simulation</li>

They had 3 kids. However, in 2017, the husband died in a road accident.

Fed up with it, the victim went back to her hometown in Bareily, UP. But Nizammuddin had been tracking her and deceitfully convinced her to return to Panipat. There, he forced her into marriage. When she refused, he stabbed her in the thigh with a knife. Eventually, he got the marriage done on January 2020\n\nAfter some days of marriage, he took her to a madrasa where he revealed his Muslim identity, which he had been purposely hiding till this point.

Whereas, in the annual cycle, at least the ratio of seats available to the candidates appearing is more or less constant.\n\nOn the other hand, what will happen if someone starts coughing and sneezing in the exam hall or at the entrance? Not every cough is covid. Some are allergies, or just common cold. But how will the candidates know for sure? I am sure some mischief-makers will come up with such schemes to distract serious candidates. Thermal scanners are mostly a joke: stand in the Sun for 5 mins and you have a temperature, stand underneath an AC vent and you're ok. \n\nThis post is not meant to either condone or criticise the govt, but just to get some insights."<br />Author: 'space_diplomat'<br />id: 'ied7oq'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li>

<li>Title: 'पाकिस्तान का टर्की प्रेम (geopolitics)'<br />Body: 'यह लेख निरा बकलोली ही है क्यों कि जिनके विषय में है उनपर कुछ कहना लिखना सिर्फ बेवकूफी ही है लेकिन कुछ अगड़म बगड़म लिख गया है तो पोस्ट कर दिए।माफ़ी दीजियेगा।\n\nयूएई इजराइल शांति समझौते के कारण दुनियाँ भर के मजहबी देशों के पैंतरे कुछ नए अंदेशों व समीकरणों को जन्म दे रहे हैं। दुनियाँ भर में घटित होने वाली घटनाएं भविष्य की दुनियाँ के रंग ढंग की तरफ बढ़ता कदम ही तो है।\n\nइजरायल ने संयुक्त अरब अमीरात से अपनी दुश्मनी समाप्त की ये कोई अभूतपूर्व घटना नहीं है। पहले भी समझौते हुए लेकिन अब जिन कारणों से हुआ वो महत्वपूर्ण है।\n\nअब तक का शिया सुन्नी विवाद भी भूतकाल की घटनाओं का ही प्रतिफल है।\xa0#सऊदी_अरब\xa0खुद को सुन्नी मुस्लिमो का मुखिया साबित करता रहता है और\xa0#ईरान\xa0खुद को शिया लोगो का। दुनियाँ में जहाँ जहाँ मुस्लिम शिया सुन्नी लड़ते है ये दोनों देश अपने अपने ग्रुप को समर्थन करते है।\n\nअब एक तीसरे पक्ष\xa0#टर्की\xa0का उदय हुआ है। क्योंकि हर भविष्य अतीत की कोख से ही जन्म लेता है ऐसे में भूतकाल में घटित घटनाओं को जानना नितांत जरूरी है। टर्की का उदय इस्लाम के संस्थापक व पैग़म्बर मोहम्मद की तीसरी बीबी से जुड़ा है, तो शुरूवार यंही से करते हैं।\n\n"आयशा" इनकी शादी किस उम्र में हुई ये तो अलग ही विषय है लेकिन इनके पिता का नाम आबू बकर था। ये आबू बकर एक धनाढ्य व्यक्ति थे और ये इस्लाम मे सपरिवार कन्वर्ट हुए थे जबकि इनके एक बेटे ने जब इस्लाम कबूल करने से मना कर दिया तो अबू बकर ने उससे सारे सबंध तोड़ दिए। खैर इसी क्रम में अरब में गुलाम रखना आम बात थी तो बकर के सारे गुलाम भी इस्लाम मे कन्वर्ट हुए और लड़ाके बन साथ रहने लगे।\n\nशादी के कुछ समय बाद ही मोहम्मद की मृत्यु और उसके बाद उत्तराधिकारी कौन से ही सारा विवाद शुरू हुआ। मतलब पहला उत्तराधिकारी या खलीफा कौन बनेगा?\n\nचौथे खलीफा अली जो कि मोहम्मद से दामाद और भतीजे दोनों का रिश्ते रखते थे ने उस समय अबू बकर को समर्थन दिया और ऐसे में पहला खलीफा आबू बकर बन जाते है,लेकिन 2 साल में उसकी मौत हो जाती है। घटना क्रम तेजी से घटित होता है इसके बाद दूसरे और तीसरे खलीफा की मौत भी जल्दी ही होती जाती है। यंहा तीसरे खलीफा की मौत का कारण उसकी हत्या होती है। दरअसल उथमन जो तीसरा खलीफा था उसकी विद्रोही लोगो ने हत्या कर दी और असल विवाद फिर यंही से शुरू हुआ।\n\nआयशा और उनके समर्थकों ने ये बोला कि विद्रोही लोगो को अभी सजा दो लेकिन चौथे व तत्कालीन खलीफा अली इस पर तुरंत फैसला नहीं ले रहे थे। ऐसे में घनघोर लड़ाइयों दोनों पक्षो में होती है और बाद में ये विवाद अली की हत्या तक चला जाता है। इसी क्रम में अब्बासी खिलाफत का अंत होता है और टर्की के ऑटोमन साम्राज्य वाले पुराने खलीफा को बंदी बनाकर खुद को नया खलीफा घोषित कर देते है। इसके बाद ऑटोमन जो अब टर्की है वो अरबी मुस्लिमो पर सैकड़ों साल अत्याचार करता है लेकिन अब खुद को मुस्लिमो का सर्वोच्च लीडर समझने लगा है।\n\nइधर वर्तमान में कुछ घटना हुई जिसने नए गठजोड़ों को जन्म दिए। जैसे पाकिस्तान का टर्की प्रेम। पाकिस्तान ने हाल में टर्की के टीवी शो अरदगन गाजी को ऊर्दू में ट्रांसलेट करवा कर सरकारी पैसे से राष्ट्रीय टीवी पर चलाने का फैसला लिया। जिसका विरोध सऊदी ने किया। इस चक्कर मे चिंगारी पर बैठे सारे मुस्लिम देश 3 गुटों में बंट गए ।\n\n#पहला\n\nसऊदी अरब व यूएई के जिसके साथ अमेरिका है और इनके पास पैसा है....\n\n#दूसरा\n\nईरान इनके साथ चीन की करीबी और कुछ कुछ रूस से भी सबंध बेहतर...\n\n#तीसरा\n\nये भिखमंगे लोग टर्की ,पाकिस्तान और सीरिया जैसे चिरकुट देश जो कट्टरता के ही पोषक हैं...\n\nये तीनों खुद को बड़ा और सच्चा मुस्लिम साबित करने के साथ खुद को मुस्लिम देशों का लीडर साबित करने का मौका खोजते रहते है और इसके लिए तीनो\xa0#इजरायल\xa0को गाली दे कर अपने अस्तित्व की रक्षा करते हैं।\n\nचीन ऊईगर मुस्लिमो को मारता है उनके धार्मिक ग्रंथ भी बदल देता है, किसी ईरान,टर्की,सीरिया या अरबी की जुबान से शब्द नही निकलते। ट्रंप रेडिकल इस्लामिक टेररिज्म बोलता है तो सऊदी तक भी चुप ही रहता है। पुतिन चेचन्या में इस्लामिक आतंकी संगठनों को दौड़ा दौड़ा कर मारता है और उसके गुट वाले चुप रहने में ही भलाई समझते हैं।\n\nखैर इससे ये समझा जा सकता है कि ये कितने दोगले,दोमुँहे, मक्कार व डरपोक लोग हैं।\n\nखैर आगे बढ़ते हैं व बदली परिस्थितियों पर नजर डालते हैं। जैसे पश्चिमी एशिया में रूस ने तेजी से अमेरिका को बैकफुट पर धकेल दिया। वैईसे तो अमेरिका को अब इस इलाके में तेल की जरूरत नही है लेकिन रणनैतिक रूप से इस इलाके में दखल उसके सरदार बने रहने लिए जरुरी है और उसको नए मित्रों की जरूरत भी है।\n\nमजेदार बात ये की पिछले 2 साल से ट्रंप कभी इजरायल की राजधानी यरूसलेम को मानते तो कभी इजरायल के कब्जे वाले इलाके को मान्यता देते। कुल मिलाकर ट्रंप के दामाद जो खुद यहूदी है और ट्रंप के सलाहकार भी है ने समझौते मामले में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभाई जिससे ट्रंप का भला हो सके।\n\nईरान पूरे अरब के सुन्नी शासन वाले देशों के लिए सबसे बड़ा खतरा है। ऐसे में इसी इलाके के दूसरे ताकतवर देशों को अपने पक्ष में करने का एक बड़ा प्रयास है। उधर यमन में भी लड़ाई चल रही है। मौजूदा समय में ईरान से पूरा अरब जगत डरा हुआ है। ऐसे में अरब देशों को अमेरिका पर भी कम विश्\u200dवास है। इस समझौते के बाद ईरान को इजरायल की फौज के उसके घर के बाहर तक आने का डर रहेगा। ये कहीं न कहीं अरब जगत के दूसरे देशों के लिए सुरक्षा की गारंटी भी होगा। उनके मुताबिक, खाड़ी के देश अमेरिका को लेकर पहले बंटे हुए थे, लेकिन अब ये भी इजरायल के पक्ष में हो जाएंगे।\n\nसऊदी अरब ने इधर कंही कुछ नही बोला लेकिन सऊदी को पता सब है इसलिए उसने भी पिछले सालों में अमेरिका, इजरायल से अपने संबंधों को सुधारा है। तो कुल मिलाकर ये सारा गठजोड़ ईरान के साथ युद्ध की तरफ बढ़ने से पहले दूसरे प्रगतिशील देशों में आपसी शांति व सौहार्द स्थापित करने की है।\n\nटर्की के खुद को नया इस्लामिक खलीफा समझने के कारण टर्की और अरब देशों में सबंध पहले ही खराब है। इधर जैसे ही UAE ने इजरायल से सबंध स्थापित करने की घोषणा की टर्की ने UAE से भी अपने सारे सबंध खत्म करने की घोषणा की।\n\nमतलब अब मुस्लिम देश दो टुकड़ों में बंट गए।\n\nएक ओर घनघोर\xa0#कट्टरपंथी\xa0देश ईरान,टर्की ,पाकिस्तान, मलेशिया और कुछेक अफ्रीकी मुस्लिम देश\n\nतो दूसरी ओर\xa0#थोड़े_कम_कट्टरपंथी\xa0(ना कि नरमपंथी) देश जिसमें आजकल सऊदी में काफी बदलाव दिख रहे है व UAE में दूसरे धर्मों के लिए दरवाजे खुले है।अरब देशों की नई पीढ़ी में चाहे UAE हो या सऊदी अरब इनमे जो नए प्रिंस या फिर किंग आ रहे है वो पिछले वालो की तरह इस्लामिक एकता जैसी बातों के बजाय व्यक्तिगत स्वार्थ व अपने विस्तार व उत्थान के बारे में ज्यादा सोच रहे हैं।।\n\nUAE तो पकड़ पकड़ भारत के दुश्मनों को भारत को सौप रहा है और अब दुबई भी पहले वाला दुबई नही रहा जहाँ D कंपनी अपना धंधा चलाती थी। कारण उनकी एक राजकुमारी भागकर भारत आई थी यहाँ से वो विदेश जा कर राजपरिवार के खिलाफ आवाज उठाने की सोच रही थी। लेकिन मोदी सरकार ने चुपचाप उसे पकड़कर उन्हें लौटा दिया। उसके बाद UAE भारत के खिलाफ या भारत मे वांटेड काफी लोगो को UAE से पकड़कर भारत को दे दिया। ऐसी ही परिस्थिति सऊदी में तब हुई जब सऊदी ने इस्ताम्बुल में एक पत्रकार की हत्या करवा दी जिसके बाद काफी हल्ला मचा।\n\nसऊदी और UAE दोनों अब कच्चे तेल पर निर्भर अपनी अर्थव्यवस्था को बदलने की सोच रहे है क्यों कि तेजी से बढ़ते बैटरी आधारित गाड़ियों, सोलर एनर्जी और दूसरे रिन्यूएबल एनर्जी के कारण भविष्य पैट्रोलियम का नही है। अब ये दशकों का ही बचा खेल है ऐसे में कुछ नया बिना अमेरिका सहयोग के संभव नही है।\n\nइस बदलाव के दौर में अपने देशों की अर्थव्यवस्था को बिना बदले इनका भला नही होने जा रहा। दूसरी तरफ टर्की ,मलेशिया, पाकिस्तान जैसे भिखमंगे देशों में धार्मिक कट्टरता बढ़ती जा रही है ।\n\nएक कमाल की बात और कि पिछले सालों में कई बार जब मुस्लिम देश आपस मे लड़ते है तो वो हज यात्रा का बायकॉट करने लगते है ऐसे में वो धार्मिक बातों का मतलब भी बदल देते है। जब कि सऊदी को हज यात्राओं से भरी आमदनी होती है।\n\nआसान भाषा मे कंहें तो इस समय सऊदी और UAE में नए युवा लोग सत्ता में आये है जो कई मोर्चो पर लड़ रहे है। एक तो वो अपने ही परिवारों से लड़ रहे है जिसमे उन्हें बाहरी दोस्तो की जरूरत है दूसरा बाहरी देशों में लड़ाई लड़ रहे है और भविष्य की दिशा क्या हो ये इसके लिए भी जूझ रहे है। ऐसे में नए दोस्त और नए दुश्मन बनना बिगड़ना भी प्रक्रिया ही है।\n\nभारत वेट एंड वाच की स्थिति में है हालाँकि भारत के सबंध पहले से ही UAE और सऊदी अरब से काफी मजबूत हो गए है दूसरी तरफ कश्मीर के मुद्दे पर पाकिस्तान का साथ देने वाले इस्लामिक देशों में अब टर्की और मलेशिया जैसे कट्टर इस्लामिक देश है।\n\nकुछ तस्वीरों को याद कीजिये जैसे जब आबू धाबी में बने हिन्दू मंदिर की जिसका उद्घाटन मोदी जी ने किया था तो UAE के राजपरिवार धार्मिक स्थल में ईंट रख रहे थे और उधर टर्की का अरदगन दूसरों के धार्मिक स्थलों पर कब्जा कर ख़ौफ़ फैला रहा है।\n\nमूल इस्लामिक देश अरब, यूएई आदि कट्टरपंथ से दूर हो रहे हैं इससे अब आप बदले हालात भी समझ सकते है कि दुनियाँ भर के असली(प्रगतिशील व धनाढ्य) व नकली(धार्मिक कट्टर व चिरकुट) मु/सलमान किससे जुड़ रहे है और किसका समर्थन कर रहे। दिक्कत तो सिर्फ भारत के उन मुसलमानों को है जिन्हें भारत अपना नहीं लगता लेकिन उनको कोई प्रतिष्ठित मु/स्लिम देश उन्हें शुद्ध मु/सलमान भी न मानता।\n\nखुदा खैर करे .....'<br />Author: 'Sonam-guptaa'<br />id: 'id76pq'<br />Flair ::Pakistan-Flag: PKMKB</li>

का सपना होता है कि उसकी औलाद उससे आगे की उड़ान तय करे लेकिन काश मेरे बाप को भी उन मुट्ठीभर बापों की तरह ये ज्ञान होता कि नया परिंदा अपने परों की कुव्वत से उड़ता है न कि उनके परों की ताकत से जिन्होंने उसे पैदा किया ...\n\nबहुत ऊँचा उड़ना चाहता था मैं ... जब भी सुरों के साये में होता ...अनहद के सफर से भी आगे निकल जाता ....\n\nआस-पड़ोस और हर अपना बस यही कहता कि मेरे कंठ की एक नाड़ी में शिव निवास करते हैं तो दूसरे में वागेश्वरी देवी ......\n\nजब भी मैं गाता ... मैं खुश होता ..जब भी संगीत रगड़ लेकर मेरे हृदय में उतरता तो मैं पल्लवित होने लगता ... संगीत मेरी आत्मा में वास करता ... मैं संगीत को अपनी रक्त धमनियों में दौड़ता हुआ महसूस करता .....\n\nस्कूल के बन्द ..बोझिल कमरे मुझे डराते ...मेरा लहरों की तरह उठती सरगम से सम्पर्क ही नही जुड़ने देते .... जब भी मुझे अपनी दुनिया बेरंग दिखती.. मैं आँखें बंद करके उनको संगीत की जलतरंग से भिगोकर अपने को साहस और संतुलन देता ...\n\nअकेले में गुनगुनाता ..वॉश रूम मेरी सबसे पसंदीदा जगह थी ..मैं वहाँ तारसप्तक छेड़ता ... मैं बालकॉनी से पक्षियों को उड़ते देखता ..उनके पंखों की आवाज में मुझे संगीत सुनाई देता ...मैं बारिश की बूंदों को थाप का सितार बनाता ....\n\nमैं जिंदगी में खुश था महक रहा था ..और मुझे लगातार महका रही थी ... खुशबू ।\n\nखुशबू जो मेरी पड़ोसन थी ..क्लासमेट थी ...और मेरे सबसे करीब थी ... उसे मुझपर यकीन था ...वो मुझे समझती थी ...सुरों से मेरा गहरा रिश्ता ..सरगम से मेरी सरगोशी सब उसे भाता था ...\n\nएक वो ही थी जो पूरे स्कूल में मुझपर नही हँसती थी ...एक वही थी जो आँख भिगो लेती थी जब और स्टूडेंट्स " ब्लेंक माइंड " कहकर मेरा मजाक उड़ाते थे ...\n\nलोग कहते हैं स्कूल शिक्षा का मंदिर होता है ...लेकिन मेरे लिए स्कूल जैसे कोई नर्क का बादल था ...मैं जितने वक्त भी स्कूल में रहता मुझे सुकून नही मिलता ...\n\nकोई साला ..जज्बातों की बात करता ही नही ...खिड़की से बाहर दौड़ता समाज किसी को नजर ही नही आता ...कोई देखता ही नही कि कुछ बच्चे स्कूल के गेट के पास खड़े होकर स्कूल को निहारते हैं ...क्यूँकि उनके पास स्कूल के गेट के अंदर घुसने की हैसियत ही नही ...\n\nरिक्शे ..ठेले ..शर्बत ..पतंग .. तमाशे वाले सब गुजरते ..लेकिन किसी को भी वो नजर नही आते ..\n\nस्कूल की भाषा ..संवैधानिक भाषा से भी जटिल लगती मुझे ..पता नही सिर्फ किताबी बातें ही क्यों होती ....??\n\nएक हिंदी और ड्राइंग का पीरियड कुछ राहत देता ...लेकिन फिर वो भी कमर्शियल होकर नम्बर और ग्रेड की डिमांड करने लगा ...\n\nमैं हमेशा स्कूल बेल को सुनने की कोशिश करता ...क्यूँकि उसमें मुझे संगीत सुनाई देता ...\n\nस्कूल बेल एक सच्चा सुर और ताल लगती मुझे .. क्यूँकि खुशबू के बाद बस वही मेरी पीढ़ा को समझती ...\n\nवही मुझे स्कूल से मुक्ति देती -\n\nलेकिन ये मुक्ति अस्थाई होती ...और इस मुक्ति को सदा के लिए समाप्त करने के लिए मेरे पापा की फ्लाइट ने दिल्ली पालम में लेंड किया .....\n\nपापा आई . एफ .एस हैं ...युगांडा में थे ...वहाँ का माहौल अराजक था तो पापा हमें वहाँ नही ले गये ...पापा अब सेकेट्रेट में सम्बद्ध हो गये ....\n\nऔर मेरी जिंदगी में संगीत की ये पहली चिता की तैयारी थी -\n\nपापा चाहते थे कि मैं भी आई .एफ. एस बनूँ ...पापा अपने इस सपने को मेरे अंदर जलाना चाहते थे ..वो मुझे रोज रसिया ..फ्रांस ..इंडोनेशिया वगैरह की कहानी और कल्चर समझाते...लेकिन मैं सिर्फ संगीत सुनता और उसे ही समझता ...\n\nमम्मी के पास सिर्फ मेरा ब्रेक फास्ट बनाने का टाइम था ...बाकी काम मेड करती थी ... मम्मी उसके बाद सिर्फ रात को मुझे गुडनाइट किस देने मेरे रूम में आती थी ...बाकि सारे दिन वो घर से बाहर ही रहती ...\n\nबड़ा अच्छा था ...समाज सुधार का ठेका ले रखा था उन्होंने ...लेकिन उनका बच्चा जो बिन माँ -बाप के तड़प रहा था उसकी जिंदगी में कोई सुधार न आ पाया ....\n\nऔर फिर आया वो दिन ..जब स्कूल की रिपोर्ट्स और नम्बर घर पहुँचने लगे...जब तक पापा नही थे मम्मी सब इग्नोर कर देती थी लेकिन अब पापा थे और उनके सामने की टेबल में थे मेरे हाफ इयरली एग्जामनेशन नम्बर्स ....\n\nस्कूल नैतिकता सीखाते हैं ..लेकिन स्कूल अब इस देश की सबसे भ्रष्ट संस्था बन चुके हैं ...\n\nक्यूँकि मुझे यकीन था ..कि मैं ड्राइंग छोड़कर किसी भी सब्जेक्ट में पास नही हो सकता ..ये मेरा विश्वास नही मेरा काम था जो आंसरशीट में दर्ज था ...लेकिन अपने स्कूल की रेपो के लिए उन्होंने मुझे सारे सब्जेक्ट्स में पास कर दिया ....\n\nलेकिन मैं नम्बरों के निचले पायदान पर खड़ा था ....एक करारा तमाचा मेरे गाल पर पड़ा ...मेरे आँसू पापा को दिखते इससे पहले मुझे सामने की खिड़की में खुशबू दिखाई दी ...\n\nमेरी आँख से पहले उसकी आँख भीग गई ...पापा एक तो गुस्से में थे और ऊपर से वाइन के नशे में ...\n\nउन्होंने मेरे सारे म्यूजिक इंस्ट्रूमेंट तोड़ डाले और दहाड़ कर बोले -\n\n" सुन ले गवैया नही बनना है तुझे ..अपने बाप की तरह एक फ़ॉरन ऑफिसर बनना है ...आज के बाद अगर इनमें हाथ लगाया तो तेरे हाथ तोड़ दूँगा ....मुझे एनवल एक्जामिनेशन में मार्क्स चाहिए ..एट एनी कॉस्ट ..एनी हाऊ "\n\nउस रात मैं सिर्फ रोता रहा ...मम्मी आई और मुझे सोता समझकर खाना पूर्ति करके चली गई ...एक बड़े से घर के बड़े से कमरे में ..मै अब अकेला था ..मेरे साथी.. मेरे अपने साज ..कटे -फटे, मरे पड़े थे...मेरे अंदर इतनी हिम्मत नही थी कि मैं उनकी लाशें भी उठा सकूँ .....\n\nघर पर दो-दो ट्यूटर आने लगे ...स्कूल में मेरी सोच का रेप होने लगा ...और घर में मेरी कल्पनाओं का ...किसी ने नही पूछा कि मैं चाहता क्या हूँ....\n\nमुझे खुद से घृणा होने लगी ...मेरी उम्मीदें टूटने लगी ...संगीत जो मेरी आत्मा में निवास करता था ..उसने भी मकान बदल लिया ...\n\nमैं अधूरा हो गया ...और आँख बंद करके अपने जीवन में आये इस बदलाव के डंक और दाँत अपने जिस्म में महसूस करने लगा ....\n\nइस बदलाव के झंझावात ने मुझे घोर अंतरमुखी बना दिया ...खुशबू से भी अब मैं नजरें चुराने लगा ...\n\nहजार कोशिशों के बाद भी मैं जब नम्बरी घोड़ा नही बन पाया ..तो मेरे बाप ने मुझसे बात करनी ही छोड़ दी ...माँ इस वक्त सबसे बड़ी ढाल बन जाती है अपनी औलाद की लेकिन उसने सिर्फ पापा का साथ दिया ...\n\nवो भी मुझे स्टेट्स का ताना मारने लगी ...टूट चुका था मैं इतना कि सोचा अपनी जान देकर संगीत से जा मिलूं ....\n\nलेकिन फिर खुशबू ने मुझे सम्हाला और विश्वास दिलाया कि एक दिन सब बदलेगा ......\n\nलेकिन उसका विश्वास मेरी हसरतों ने चटका दिया ...\n\nउम्र बढ़ी तो मैंने जैसे-तैसे कॉलेज ज्वाइन किया ...नम्बरों की रेस ने मुझे इतना पछाड़ दिया था कि मैं बाप का कोई भी अरमान पूरा करने की सारी अर्हता खो चुका था ...\n\nलेकिन कॉलेज में मुझे फिर खुशबू मिली ...और फिर मिला मुझे उसकी जुबान से प्रेम का निमंत्रण ...\n\nमैं और खुशबू साथ-साथ वक्त बिताते और खुशबू ने फिर मेरे अंदर संगीत को दाखिल कर दिया ...वो संगीत जो मेरे कलेजे से निकलकर खाना बदोश हो चुका था ...\n\nवो मुझमें फिर लौट आया ...मैं फिर गाने लगा और खुशबू मेरे काँधें में अपना सर रखकर मेरे अल्फाजों को अपनी जुबान से चखने लगती ...\n\nवो मेरी आवाज को रिकार्ड करती और फिर मुझे सुनाती ...सब कुछ ठीक चल रहा था तभी एक दिन -\n\n" अजीत ! मैं नही चाहता कि तुम मेरी बेटी से कोई रिश्ता रखो ..मैं नही चाहता कि मेरी बेटी तुम्हारी तरह बने ...मैंने तुम्हारे पापा से कम्प्लेन कर दी है लेकिन आगे अगर तुम फिर खुशबू से मिले तो मुझे फिर कोई स्ट्रिक्ट एक्शन लेना होगा .."\n\nखुशबू के पापा की धमकी सुनकर घर पहुँचा तो पापा आखरी बार मुझसे मुखातिब हुए -\n\n" नालायक ... तू तो हराम का खाने का आदी हो गया है कम से कम खुशबू को तो कुछ करने दे ...बेशर्म हमारे सर पर बोझ है तू कम से कम उसे तो अपने माता-पिता का नाम रौशन करने दे ...तूने तो मिट्टी में मिला ही दिया है हमारी इज्जत को ..."\n\nपापा की सारी बातें जायज हो सकती हो लेकिन वो हराम का खाना वो बोझ कुछ जँचा नही ...मम्मी हमेशा की तरह पापा से सहमत थी ...\n\nसामने खिड़की में फिर आँखों में आँसू भरकर खुशबू खड़ी थी ....मैंने एक नजर सबको देखा फिर देखा कैलेन्डर को .... 17 जून का नम्बर टँगा था ....\n\nनम्बरों से हारा मैं अजीत ...फिर नम्बरों से दूर निकल गया ...छोड़ दिया मैंने घर , वो शहर , वो गलियां ...जिसमें सब कुछ था लेकिन संगीत और जज्बात नही थे ....\n\nअपनी जिंदगी जैसे -तैसे एक कम्पनी की जॉब में काट रहा था ...लेकिन अब संगीत था जो रोज मुझे सुलाता था और रोज जगाता भी था ...लेकिन दिन-भर की भागदौड़ में सिर्फ गाड़ियों का शोर था और थी ज़िन्दगी की नंगी और कड़वी सच्चाई ....\n\nएक रात जब काम से लौट कर घर आया ...तो मेरे फोन में एक फोन आया -\n\n" प्लीज़ डोंट बी डिस्कनेक्ट अजीत ...मैं खुशबू ..प्लीज़ ..मेरी बात सुनो अजीत ..बड़ी मुश्किल से ढूंढ़ा है तुम्हे बहुत साल लग गये यार ...सुनो अजीत अगर तुमने मुझसे कभी भी कहीं भी किसी भी पल प्यार किया है तो सीधे मुंबई आ जाओ ...तुम्हारी आवाज एक फ़िल्म मेकर को बहुत पसंद आ गई है ...वो तुम्हे अपनी फिल्म में बतौर एक सिंगर लेना चाहता है ...प्लीज़ अजीत प्लीज आ जाओ ...."\n\nबहुत रो रही थी ...उसके आँसू गवाह थे कि वो आज भी मुझसे प्यार करती है ...सच्चा प्यार ...मैं भी रो पड़ा ...और बहुत सी बातें मेरे और खुशबू के बीच हुई ...\n\nफिर उसने अपना एड्रेस सेंड किया ....और मैंने बैग पैक करके मुंबई की ट्रेन पकड़ने के लिए अपने कमरे से पैर बाहर फेंका ....\n\nसीधे प्लेटफॉर्म पहुँचा ट्रैन लेट थी ...तो यूँ ही नींद आ गई ...और फिर 8 नम्बर प्लेटफॉर्म की उस ट्रैन ने मेरी जिंदगी ही बदल दी ....\n\nआज पूरा मुल्क मुझे जानता है ...मेरी आवाज का दीवाना है ...आज मेरे पास संगीत की नेमत है ...प्यार की दौलत है ...मेरे पास मेरा पहला और सच्चा प्यार खुशबू है ....और अब मेरे पास मेरे नम्बरी माँ -बाप भी हैं ...उन्हें आज मुझपर नाज है लेकिन जिसपर मैं नाज करता हूँ वो खुशबू है ...जिसने न सिर्फ इस नम्बरी दुनिया की भागदौड़ में मेरी खूबी को पहचाना...बल्कि उसे परवरिश दी ...जिसने मेरी खूबी पर यकीन किया और समझाया कि नम्बरों के आगे भी एक दुनिया है ...जो प्यार और भरोसे के स्तम्भ पर अभी भी टिकी हुई है ....काश यही भरोसा मुझपर मेरे पालकों ने किया होता ....\n\nमुझे तो मेरी मंजिल मिल गई लेकिन न जाने इस मुल्क में नम्बरों की भेंट चढ़ते करोड़ों अजीतों और अंजलियों को उनकी मंजिल मिलेगी या नही मुझे नही पता ....\n\nमेरा सिर्फ इतना निवेदन है आप सभी से ...कि नम्बरों की इस अंधाधुंध दौड़ में किसी भी मासूम का बचपन, उसके सपने , उसके अरमान , उसकी वास्तविकता ....उसकी खूबी को न रौंदे ....उसे पहचाने ..उसकी खूबी को सराहें ...उसे भरोसा और हौंसला दे ...और सुबूत दें कि हम इंसान की औलाद हैं नम्बरों की नही ...\n\nसो प्लीज़ स्टॉप काउंटडाउन ....'<br

....\n\nअब ये अपन की भाषा तुम सब वाइट भसड़ कालर्स को टुच्ची लगेगी तो अपन सिंपल भाषा में बोलेगा ...\n\nमेरा नाम शिव नारायण है ...अपन साला ..सॉरी फिर टंग स्लिप हो गई ..मतलब मैं पैदा हकीमपुर में हुआ ...मेरा बाप एक सरकारी मास्टर था ...मेरी एक बहन हैं सुधा और एक भाई है गणेश ...दोनों मुझसे छोटे हैं...\n\nत्रिलोक का ऐसा कोई गणितीय सवाल नही ..जो मैं चुटकी बजाते हल नही कर लेता था ....\n\nप्रखर बुद्धि की बैलगाड़ी हाँकता हुआ जब मैं कक्षा पाँच में पहुँचा ...अपन की माँ ऑफ हो गई ...\n\nउस दिन अपन ..अगेन सॉरी ..उस दिन मैं रोया नही ...बस माँ का चेहरा देखते रहा ...माँ की नाक में ठूंसी रुई ..मुझे परेशान करने लगी .. मेरा बाप बोलता था कि हम नाक से साँस लेते हैं ...\n\nमैंने माँ की नाक से रुई निकाल दी ...और मेरे सनसनाये मातमी बाप ने मेरे गाल में चांटा चिपका दिया....\n\nमेरा बाप कभी मेरा बाप नही बन पाया ...वो घर में भी मास्टर था ..और बाहर भी ...उसके सीने में दिल नही ..पाइथागोरस का जॉमेट्रिक कलेजा था .. वो जिंदगी और गृहस्थी को भी गणित की संटी से हाँकता था ....\n\nमतलब माँ बीमार हो या उदास ..उसे कोई फर्क नही पड़ता था ...वो बस हुक्म देता ..और हुक्म पूरा न होने पर वो माँ को उतनी ही बेरहमी से मारता जितनी बेरहमी से वो स्कूल के बच्चों का मोर बनाता ...\n\nउसकी आत्मा में इंसान नही बसता था ..वरना उसे भी दर्द का एहसास जरूर होता ...वो माँ से कतई प्रेम नही करता था ...क्यूँकि माँ रूप -रंग में औसत से भी नीचे थी और हमेशा बीमार रहा करती थी ....\n\nवो मास्टर जरूर था ...लेकिन गुरु ब्रह्मा और गुरु विष्णु वाला नही ...कबीर होते तो उसे देखकर कोई दूसरा दोहा जरूर टेकते ...\n\nमुझे वो फूंटी आँख पसन्द नही करता था ..वेतन समय पर न आये .. या किसी संगी मास्टर से उसकी कोई खटपट हो जाये साला पूरे का पूरा गुबार मेरी पीठ पर निकालता था ...\n\nमाँ जब मरी तो मैं खुश हुआ ..क्यूँकि उसे इस जानवर से मुक्ति मिली ....\n\nलेकिन माँ की तेरहवीं के बाद ही वो चौदहवी का चांद ले आया ...\n\nसौतेली माँ का नाम चंदा था ... और मेरा बाप उसका चकोर बन गया ...उसने जमकर भसड़ काटी ... और मुझे अक्सर दरवाजे के बाहर सोना पड़ता .....\n\nवो उस औरत का गुलाम था ...वो उसे रूप की देवी मानता था ...वो उसे न सुबह छोड़ता ..न शाम ..और रात को उनकी हँसी-ठिठल्ली की भसीली आवाजें मुझे बताने लगी कि मेरी माँ वास्तव में मर गई है ....\n\nबिल्कुल ठीक फिल्मी टाइप की ही थी सौतेली माँ ...न वक्त पर खाना देती न ..न धुले कपड़े ...होता है साहब ...होता है ...जब माली ही फूलों से घृणा करने लगे तो फिर बहार भी गुलों को नही खिला पाती ....\n\nजैसे- तैसे ज़िन्दगी दरवाजे के बाहर कटने लगी ..इसी बीच बाप ने दो औलादें भी पैदा कर ली ... और फिर मुझे पता चला कि मेरा मास्टर बाप सिर्फ मेरे और मेरी माँ के लिए ही मास्टर था ...लेकिन चंदा की औलादों के लिये वो उन दोनो का बाप बनने लगा ....बहन मुझसे प्यार करती थी और चूतियम सल्फेट भाई निरा बाप पर गया था ...साला पता नही नफरत का लेमनचूस लेकर न जाने कैसे पैदा हुआ ....\n\nइसी बीच ...मैं पढ़ता रहा ...हाई स्कूल में डिस्ट्रिक्ट टॉप किया ...बाप को घन्टा खुशी नही हुई ....इंटर में मुहल्ला ही टॉप कर सका ...बाप ने मुँह में एक बताशा नही डाला .....\n\nलेकिन मिश्री सी लगती थी मुझे अवंतिका शास्त्री ...\n\nअपने मुहल्ले के झोला छाप डॉक्टर की बेटी थी ..आई. पी. एस ऑफिसर बनने का ख्वाब था उसका ....लेकिन शहर ने उसके झोला छाप बाप का झोला इतना भर दिया कि बाप ने उसी झोले को उलट कर क्लिनिक खोल दिया और उसके बाद एक छोटा सा अस्पताल ...\n\nसब धन की मोह माया है .... ऐसा सुनता आया था ऐसा होते देख भी लिया ....\n\nमैं कॉलेज पहुँचा और अवंतिका बारहवीं में ....प्रेम को इजहार की बैसाखी की हमेशा जरूरत पड़ती है ....तो ...प्रेम पत्र लिख दिया ...कोई रिप्लाई नही आया ...\n\nलेकिन एक दिन रजनीश मेरा दोस्त दौड़ते हुए मेरे पास आया और बोला -\n\n" तेरे माल की चुन्नी खींची है बे स्वामी ने "\n\nइन्वेस्टिगेशन नही की बस उठा के ईंटा सर पर चिन दिया स्वामी के और अपन की लग गई लंका ...\n\nस्वामी विधायक का लौंडा था ..मौका ए वारदात पर पुलिस पहुँची वरना पुलिस और मौके पर ... चुनाव का सीजन था अपन की जात विधायक से मैच कर गई ...वोट बैंक बिगड़ता तो एफ .आई. आर नही कटी ....\n\nकतई पुलिस स्टेशन से निकलकर अपन की औकात बढ़ गई और पहली बार मेरा बाप ..मेरा भाई और चंदा ...मुझे देखकर भयभीत हुए ....\n\nलेकिन बहन आगे बढ़ी और उसने मेरा हाथ चूमा और भगवान को थैंक्स बोला ....\n\nतूती फिर गई शहर में ...शिव नारायण से अपन शिवा भाई हो गया ...ये नया लुक जमता था अपन पर ....और अपनी जुबान फिल्मों ने पॉलिस करके मुम्बइया बना दी ....\n\nपूरा मुहल्ला इम्प्रेश था अपन से लेकिन जिसके लिए ये सब कुछ किया वो अवंतिका मुझसे घनघोर नफरत करने लगी ....मेरी पीठ पीछे वो मुझे मवाली बोलती ...जैसा मेरा बाप ..चंदा और भाई बोलता ....बाप ने घर के दरवाजे हमेशा के लिये बन्द कर दिए ..लेकिन अपन तो हमेशा दरवाजे के बाहर ही सोया तो वहाँ उसने अपना खटारा स्कूटर खड़ा कर दिया ...\n\nमुहल्ले से निकल कर मुंम्बई जाना चाहा लेकिन अवंतिका और मेरी बहन का प्यार मेरे पाँव रोकता रहा ...बहन ने मेरी बड़ी हेल्प की ..बाप के चुराए पैसे दिये और अवंतिका को मनाने की पूरी कोशिश की.....\n\nलेकिन अवंतिका अपने झोला छाप बाप के झोले से भी ज्यादा दिल की गरीब निकली और उसने मेरी बहन से बात करना ही छोड़ दिया ....\n\nबहन की इंसल्ट पूरा महीना मुझे अवंतिका को भुलाने की कोशिश कराती रही लेकिन मैं उसे नही भूल पाया और एक दिन -\n\n" अब तो मान जाओ अवंतिका ..तुम जो कहोगी ...जैसा कहोगी मैं करने को तैयार हूँ...मेरे प्यार ...."\n\n" चुप कर मवाली ...गुंडे ...पूरा मुहल्ला डरता होगा तुझसे लेकिन मैं नही ...अपनी औकात देख तू कहाँ खड़ा है और मैं कहाँ ...?\n\nकर्री चोट कर गई ये औकात वाली बात ...सही बोल रही थी अवंतिका ..हर लड़की का एक सपना होता है ..कि उसका प्रेमी ..उसका पति ऐसा हो जिसपर उसे गर्व हो ...अवंतिका यकीनन मुझसे प्यार करती थी ...नही तो सीधे मना भी कर सकती थी ...क्यूँ उसने मुझे आईना दिखाया -\n\nबी. एस .ई ..दो साल पहले कम्प्लीट हो ही चुकी थी ...सीधे बहन से मिला और उसका माथा चूमा ...आँख में आँसू भरे और सीधे पकड़ी इलाहाबाद की ट्रेन ....\n\nसुध नही थी अब ..अब सिर्फ एक धुन थी कुछ बनने की ...इलाहाबाद जाते ही पहले काम ढूंढा ...एक दुकान में काम मिला अकाउंटेंट का ...मालिक बढ़िया आदमी था ...और मैं गणित में मास्टर ....\n\nपैसे हुए तो सीधे सिविल सर्विसेज का बैनर देखा ... फिर नजर आया उसका ग्लैमर ....बनना चाहता था कुछ और लेकिन अब ठान लिया कि आई.ए .एस क्रेक करूंगा ...\n\nये सिर्फ अभी हट थी लेकिन न जाने ये हट कैसे जुनून बन गई ...मैंने अकाउंटेंट की जॉब छोड़ दी ...और सुबह शाम बच्चों को मैथ पढ़ाने लगा...दिन में कोचिंग और फिर रात को अपनी पढ़ाई ....\n\nमैं अपने पहले अटेम्प्ट को लास्ट अटेम्प्ट में बदलना चाहता था नही तो अवंतिका की शादी हो जाती ...या फिर मुझे कुछ और साल उसका इंतेजार करना पड़ता ...\n\nलेकिन इंसान का जुनून उसकी सफलता का पैमाना स्थापित करता है ...मेरा पहला ही अटेम्प्ट मेरा फाइनल अटेम्प्ट हो गया ...और सिर्फ अवंतिका के लिए मैंने आई .ए. एस को नही आई.पी .एस को वरीयता दी ...और इस सनक ने मुझे पहुँचा दिया हैदराबाद ....\n\nमैंने वहाँ आई.पी .एस की ट्रेनिंग मुक्कमल की ....और कल का एक अनाथ सरीखा ..फिर एक गुंडा आज का सुपरिटेण्डेन्ट ऑफ पुलिस बन गया ....\n\nमेरी जिंदगी वैसे ही दौड़ी जैसे फिल्मों में दौड़ती है लेकिन फ़िल्म भी तो किसी न किसी के जीवन की कहानी होती है ....\n\nलेकिन इस बीच अवंतिका सिविल एग्जाम क्रेक नही कर पाई लेकिन स्टेट पी. सी. एस क्वालीफाई करके उसने सी. ओ सिटी का पद प्राप्त कर लिया था ...\n\nमैंने अपनी नियुक्ति में उसी जिले को वरीयता दी जहाँ अवंतिका कार्यरत थी ....खुशी -खुशी मैंने ये सारी खबर अपनी बहन को टेलीफोन के माध्यम से दी ...और उसको विकासपुर बुला लिया ....\n\nवो बहुत खुश थी ...लेकिन मेरे बाप..चंदा और भाई के चेहरे में मुहर्रम का मातम था ...उनकी सुलग कर चौतीस हो गई थी ...सुधा आई और मेरे गले लगी ...बहुत लाड़ उतरा मेरा भी उसके लिए ...फिर मैंने उसको सारा वृतांत सुना दिया और ये भी कि अवंतिका भी इसी जनपद में कार्यरत है ....लेकिन वो बोली -\n\n" भाई अब तो उसे भूल जाओ ...वो नीच कभी आपके लायक ही नही थी ..झूठ सोचते हैं आप वो आपका भला सोचती थी ..जबकि उसका विवाह होने वाला है अपने ही डिपार्टमेंट के किसी लड़के से "\n\nये खबर मुझे झंझोड़ गई ..बुरी तरह तोड़ गई ...पूरे डिस्ट्रिक्ट को पता चल चुका था कि शिव नारायण इस शहर के एस. पी बनकर आने वाले हैं ....लेकिन मैंने उसी पल फोन निकाला ..कंट्रोल रूम से अवंतिका की लोकेशन पूछी ..पता चला और मैंने सीधे सुधा का हाथ पकड़ा और अब मैं अवंतिका के सामने प्लेन ड्रेस में खड़ा था ...जबकि सुधा को मैंने कुछ दूरी पर खड़ा कर दिया -\n\n" हैलो अवन्तिका ! कैसी हो ...?"\n\n" तू ..यहाँ भी मेरे पीछे आ गया शिवा ..चल दे यहाँ से वरना अरेस्ट करके अंदर डाल दूँगी .."\n\n" कौन है ये ...?"\n\nउसके साथ खड़ा उसका प्रेमी जो वर्दी में था बोला ...\n\n" ये मवाली गुंडा है ...ये मेरे ...."\n\nवो पूरा बोलती तभी सुधा बीच मे आ गई और वो कुछ बोलती इससे पहले ही मैंने उसका मुँह बन्द करवा दिया ...फ्लो में बोलती अवंतिका कुछ शांत हुई -\n\n" हाँ बोलो अवंतिका ..उर्फ अवि "\n\n" अवि बोला तू मुझे ....क्या बोला तू ..अपनी औकात देखकर बात कर जानता है कौन हूँ मैं ..सी. ओ सिटी हूँ .. दो कौड़ी के मवाली ..."\n\nतभी वायरलैस सेट बजा -\n\n" जय हिंद मैडम ! कप्तान साहब उसी रूट पर हैं जहाँ आप हैं .."\n\nसुधा कुछ बोलती इससे पहले ही पेट्रोल पुलिस टीम पहुँची और आनन -फानन में उसमें से पुलिस इंस्पेक्टर उतरे -\n\n" जय हिंद सर ! सॉरी सर हमें लेट हो गया ...वो गाड़ी का टायर पंक्चर हो गया था ..."\n\nहवाइयां उड़े अवंतिका के चेहरे को समझकर या पढ़कर ..वो इंस्पेक्टर फिर अवंतिका से मुखातिब होकर बोला -\n\n" कप्तान

<li>Title: 'I see many people talking about how India should help Balochistan in seceding, so I decided to do an analysis upon it, and see whether their is any realistic gain for india in the matter. OC है बे!'<br />Body: 'Should India “Realistically” Help Balochistan?\n\nI would like to start off by just saying one thing, the process of seceding Balochistan from Pakistan requires a lot of blood and money, with lesser chance of a gain at the end.\n\n\nNow I would like to give a point by point rebuttal to all of the points that people normally discuss to show why India should help Balochistan.\n\n\nIndia should help Balochistan as it betrayed the country during the time of independence.\n\nThat is true, India didn’t help Balochistan, back in those days and let Pakistan invade it, actually I am not so sure about the invading part, as I am not able to get trusted sources to prove it, so let’s just assume that they either invaded it or forcefully integrated it.\n\nAs I said in the first line of this article, war is only wagered if the side who starts it, feels that they would be able to get an advantage from it, along with lesser losses. But, according to what I have researched, there is no way in hell that Balochistan can be freed without the martyring of thousands of soldiers, economic burden and maybe even worsened relations with countries, and even at a chance of WW3, and the advantages aren’t exactly viable, to say the least.\n\nIndia should help, as Pakistan itself, is provoking the population of Kashmir.\n\nMy rebuttal to this phrase would be basically that, India is not at all like Pakistan, if you get what I mean. India cares way more about its future economy, stability, and the support of the people, which are the traits that you have to take care of in a functional democracy. Pakistan, however, is a government which is a puppet of a military dictatorship, definitely they too have to keep the people happy, but more of their GDP goes towards the military, and paying back debts that they have piled up throughout the years, and also that India also wants to keep a steady relationship with far away, and nearby neighbours such as Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Russia, United States Of America and The European Union, to slow down the influence of China. So wagering war, may worsen these relations, or make them better, it is more of a debatable topic, to say the least.\n\nThe seceding of Balochistan will break the back of the Pakistani’s\n\nThat is a correct statement, however it doesn’t take into consideration that the same/ a similar toll will also be on the back of India, as, if you look at the graphs of previous wars throughout the years(Indo-Pakistani Wars), then you may see that economic growth stayed stale for 1-2 years, or just that specific year.\n\nProof: War of 1947: I think that taking that war into consideration would be a little unfair because not only was India going through an economic burden like most countries do after independence but also as there aren’t many sources showing the economic growth of that time, most start of from 1951.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0War of 1965: The GDP growth rate for 1964 was\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 7.45% and then in 1965 it stooped down to -2.64% and in 1966, it still stayed stale at 0.06%.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0War of 1971: The GDP growth rate for 1970 was 5.16% and then in 1971 it stooped down to 1.64% and then it again stooped down to 0.66% in 1972.\n\nThe source to the data: https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IND/india/gdp-growth-rate\n\nSo, basically my point is that, Balochistan’s independence is hard to say the least, and in my opinion, time will only tell whether Balochistan will get to call itself a nation.\n\n\nThank you for reading\xa0\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0-Aryaman Singh'<br />Author: 'Generocide'<br />id: 'iaq1wv'<br />Flair ::swamivivek: High IQ</li>

If you do not start from there, you will search for multiple explanations and rationalisations for your society\'s misery and shortcomings that will ultimately lead you nowhere.\n\nThe thing is, your enemy has no interest in a so-called "victory" over you, because they already won - long ago, before most of you were even born. Now, the entirety of their actions is aimed at a single goal - humiliation. Humiliation robs you of your humanity, your will, your reason to fight on. Humiliation takes everything from you, and it even robs you of being worthy of empathy. It has been used by every occupier in history, and it’s our natural primal understanding of defeat. The Ottoman practice of Köçek is a prime example, similar to the concept of eunuch in Mughal era . Köçeks were a combination of dancers, clowns and prostitutes; they were young non-Muslim boys taken from their parents and trained to be wilful sexual objects and entertainers for the Ottoman Turks. The goal was to have the occupied think “if we allow that to be done to our boys, what else can they do?” The answer is "anything". It is full-spectrum domination of the minds of the conquered. \n\nYour enemy doesn\'t want your daughters taken away through love jihad, your temples destroyed, your religion mocked, your gods made fun on so called stand up comedy,  your tax paid public properties torched. They want it because they know you don\'t want it, but can\'t stop them. They want to humiliate you. There isn\'t any other reason.

<li>Title: '[NOC] How i fucked communist.'<br />Body: 'ये तब की बात है जब में दिल्ली में हुआ करता था। मेरी JNU , दु के कुछ छात्रों से जान पहचान थी। जाड़े के दिन थे। में साबरमती ढाबे पे मेरे jnu के कॉमी दोस्त से कुछ बातचीत कर रहा था। उसने हमेशा की तरह संघ, सावरकर, हिंदुत्व का विरोध चलाया। तभी वहाँ एक लड़की आयी। वो काफी खूबसूरत थी। इंजिनीरिंग छात्र एवं बॉयज स्कूल में शिक्षा होनेके कारण मेरे जीवन मे मानो लड़कियों का जैसे अकाल था। तो इसमें कोई आस्चर्य नहीं के jnu की वो छात्रा मुझे आकर्षक लगे। लेकिन वो लड़की भी बहोत टंच थी। उसके मम्मे काफी बड़े थे। उसका चेहरा ठीक सा था। उसकी आवाज काफी भद्दी थी। उसने हमारी चर्चा में भाग लिया। वह भी मेरे दोस्त के तरफ से थी। मेने उसके मुद्दों का खंडन किया। तब वो कुछ नाराज सी हो गई। में उसके मुद्दों का खंडन तो कर रहा था पर मेरे शरीर मै एक गरमाहट हो रही थी। में उसको जितना हो सके उतना ताड रहा था। मैं खुड़पे काबू नही कर पा रहा था। \n\nतभी शायद उसने मेरी भावना समझी। उसने मुझे अपने रूम पे बुलाया। रूम पे आते ही उसका बर्ताव बदल से गया। एक मादक नजर मुझपे डालके वो बोली, काफी इंटेंस हो तुम। काफी पैशनेट भी। मेने एक awkward सी स्माइल दी। वो मेरे करीब आयी और सीधे पॉइंट पर आके बोली, वर्जिन हो? मैंने jwav नही दिया। मुझे मेरे लिंग में खून दौड़ते हुए महसूस हो रहा था। उसने एक सेक्सी स्माइल दी और बोली, कोई नहीं संघी बॉय, में सब सीखा दूंगी तुम्हे। में काफी एक्सपेरेंसड हु। मेंरे अंदर का पुरुष जग गया। मेने उसे अपनी ओर खींचा, और सवाल किया, "क्यों? तुम्हारे कॉमरेड्स के साथ क्यों नही सोती?" वो बोली "कई कॉमरेड्स के नीचे रही। अब मुझे उनसे कुछ मजा नही आता। मुझे अब किसी संघी के साथ सेक्स करना है। मुझे देखना हैं वो कैसा होता है। और आज तुम मुझे मिले।" \n\nबिना वक्त गवाये मैने उसके मम्मे रगड़ना शुरू किया। वो सिसकिया लेने लगी। फिर उसने मेरा चुम्बन लेने की कोशिश की। मेने उसे रोका और पूछा, "बीफ खाया है तुमने?" वो थोड़ी शर्माकर हाँ बोली। मैने बोला "फिर मुझे किस करने की कोशिश मत करना" । वो दंग रह2गयी। में फिर उसके निप्पल्स रगड़ने लगा। वो जोरजोर से सिसकिया लेने लगीं। मेने फिर उसकी टॉप उतारी। रेड ब्रा में उसके मम्मे समा नही रहे थे। उसके तने हुए निप्पल ब्रासे दिख रहे थे। मैने उसे अपना ब्रा खोलने बोला। फिर में उसके निप्पल चूसना शुरू किया। वो काफी गर्म हो गयी थी। मैने उसके पेन्टी में हाथ डाला। उसकी चूत गीली होके उससे पानी टपक रहा था। मेने उसके मम्मे चूसते हुए उसके चूत में उंगली डाली और उसे फिंगर करने लगा। वो अब आहे भर रही थी। मैने उसके बूब्स पे दाँत के निशान छोड़े। मेने अपनी पैंट और कच्छा nikal दिया। मेरा लिंग पूरा सख्त होगया था। वो उसे देखकर दंग हो गयी। "ये काफी बड़ा है।" मैने पूछा, "तेरे कॉमरेड्स का कितना है?" वो बोली, कुछ 4 इंच। काफी छोटा। फिर मेने उसे बोला "तो चूस ना"। वो mwra लन्ड चूसने लगी। मेरे लन्ड के टोपे पे होंठ रगड़ने लगी। पूरा लन्ड अंदर लेने लगी। वो इसमे काफी एक्सपर्ट थी। इससे पहले के मेरा पानी छूटे, मैने उसे रोक। उसको बेड पे लेटाया। \n\nउसके चूत पर मैने अपना लन्ड रगड़ना शुरू किया वो xhillane लगी "चोद मुझे, डाल अपना लोडा अंदर" मैने फिर अपना लन्ड उसके दाने पे रगड़ा। वो और ऐसैट हुई और मुझे चोदने के लिए गिड़गिड़ाने लगी। उसका फिर पानी छूट गया। मैंने उसकी गेम गीली चूत में अपना लोडा घुसाया। वो जैसे सातवे आसमान पर गई। में फिर उसे पेल पेल के चोदने लगा। उसकी चूत काफी गहरी थी। मैं काफी अंदर तक अपना लोडा घुसाया। मेरा लोडा छप छप करके अंदर बाहर होरहा था। फिर एके पल ऐसा आया जहा मेरे लन्ड ने पानी छोड़ दिया। उसकी चूत मेरे सीमेन से भर गई। वो मदहोश हो गई थी।\n\nमैंने उसे पूछा, "कैसा था संघी के साथ सेक्स" वो बोली "काफी दमदार। मुझे अब जैसे संघी के साथ सेक्स करने की लत सी लगी है।"\n\nमौजूद फिर दिल्ली में जितने दिन था, उनमेसे हर 2 दिन उसे मिलता। हम खूब सेक्स करते। हमने हर पोजिशन में सेक्स किया। उसको डॉगी पोजिशन में चोदने में मुझे काफी मज़ा आता। उसके चूतड़ में मार मारके लाल कर देता। उसको मैने कई बार1इतना चोदा के वो अजीब चलने लगती। \n\nफिर मैं बंगलोर आया। हमारी मुलाकात नई होती। अब वो काफी मशहूर बनी है। लेकिन मुझे गारंटी है के वो हमारी चुदाई अभी भी याद रखे हैं।'<br />Author: 'thande_papa12'<br />id: 'i8g4cd'<br />Flair ::shit: Shitpost</li>

<li>Title: 'Begum Aisha Explains: Bangalore Riots'<br />Body: 'Earlier this week a Dalit Kafir posted an image of me and my husband, Prophet Mohammed on Facebook. Alongside were quotes from The Holi Quran;\n\n*"Mohammed (54) would take a bath with the little girl (me, 9) and fondle her."*\n\nBeen there, done that.\n\n*"Mohammed deflowered pre-pubescent Aisha."*\n\nCan confirm. This was my first PTSD inducing incident &lt;3. \n\n*"In Islam, rape, marriage and divorce of pre-pubescent children is allowed"*\n\nYes. Islam is the most liberal religion. Here men are given absolute freedom.\n\n*"Muslims, in fact, Allah himself, considered Mohammed to be an ideal man."*\n\nMy Profit Momo really is the ideal man. \n\nIn my eyes, this post is merely glorifying our relationship. I wish for more Kafirs to share such anecdotes of the love life of Profit and I so as to build a new standard for relationships all across Endia. To get you all started, here’s [one such incident:](https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Muhammad_and_the_Clinical_Definition_of_Pedophilia)\n\nI first met Profit when I was 5 years old. He had come to visit my father, Abu Bakr. There, he saw me playing with a winged horse. Profit Momo has always had a thing for kids like me. And so, when he saw me, all spent in my childlike glory, playing and riding the toy horse, Profit’s emotions started to stir up. He slowly approached me like a present-day pedophile approaches an unsuspecting kid. In that sensual moment, he pointed to the thing I was riding and asked me what it was. I said it’s a horse. He smiled and argued that horses don’t have wings and thus ruined the romantic moment. After a yearlong of long distance and communicating via pigeons, we finally got married when I was six. I moved in with him. Three years later, at the age of 9, my marriage was consummated. \n\nAnyways, coming back to the topic in hand, I, as the wife of Profit Momo, would like to clear a few things. First of all, the riots didn’t occur because my Muslim brothers got offended by the Facebook post. I can assure you that all my Muslim brothers see the aforementioned quotes as relationship goals. And hence, contrary to the Kafir propaganda, my Muslim brothers really appreciated that post and have also approached the vulnerable Dalit poster with love to offer conversion (I hope they reach him before missionaries and their rice-bags do.) \n\nSo why did the riots occur, you may ask. Despite Maulana Modi’s constant appeasement by hiking madrasa allocation upto 80% and many other schemes, us Muslims are starting to lose faith in him. There’s pent up anger and an urge for Jihad due to Ram Mandir, CAA, Triple Talaq abolishment and Article 370. Expect many more such riots if Maulana Modi, Amit “Maulvi” Shah, Rashtriya MuslimSevak Sangh etc don’t speak up and take charge.'<br />Author: 'AishaBegum72'<br />id: 'i8ce25'<br />Flair ::snoo_trollface:Bait molana Bait</li>
