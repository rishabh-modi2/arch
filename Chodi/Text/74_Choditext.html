Only then communism can be imposed.\n\n*YOU ARE HELPING THEM by being angry, hateful and unfocused and thus unproductive.*\n\nThey are focused, productive and make a lot of money. Then they use to money to fund commies who further continue destruction.\n\nUnrest is their goal. Be it any type of unrest.\n\n**THE ONLY WAY** to defeat commies is POSITIVITY.\n\n**What kind of positivity?**\n\nI want you to become so bloody successful inside and outside, that your success BURNS these commies within.\n\n**Remember:** A successful and happy democratic society is the WORST nightmare of commies.\n\nGive them that nightmare.\n\n**So how to do that?**\n\n***Here are a few things that turned my life around in an unimaginable way:***\n\n**1) Yoga by Isha Foundation:** This has been the MOST impactful experience for me. Sadhguru has some incredible methods of transformations and it's free( the beginner ones are free).\n\nThere's an app called Yoga Tools by isha foundation. Those 7 beginner yoga tools are a good start. I can't stress enough on how important they are.\n\nThese methods have taken away a lot major compulsions I had. For e.g. I'm on brahmacharya, so nofap was the biggest challenge for me. Yoga is helped me to come over these compulsions and use the energy somewhere worthwhile.\n\nYoga is now an inseparable part of my life. It's a must.\n\n**2) Healthy diet -** Eat healthy, nutritious and light weight food. Drink fruit juices as per fruit season.\n\nNimboo pani daily after at least 2 hours after meal boosts immunity dramatically. Daily consumption of honey increases iron in body and keeps you energized throughout the day.\n\nConsume protein power for protein instead of eating heavy foods meat/beef/chicken. It's infinitely more healthy. Refer to Fit Tuber on YouTube to know more. Don't argue with me in the comments.\n\n**3) Think big:** No I'm not talking about akhand bharat here. I'm talking about seeing beyond survival. Don't just think of getting a job. Think how you can create jobs. This pandemic is an opportunity.

Because only "this" religion is so stupid. But it turned out the Baba is from "other" religion.\n\nThere\'s also another recent  incident sad incident, several "this caste" households are burnt and they were beaten . Same thing happened again people already made their mind that attackers are from this "particular caste" and obviously follow "this" religion.\nAgain it turned out the attackers are from "other" religion.\n\nThere was more than 10 shameful incidents of people rejecting to eat food cooked from "this caste", people and media mentioned the caste of these castiest people in headline only when it was done by "particular caste" which is 1 incident , but for other same incidents which are more than 10 incidents, people assumed that it must be done by this "particular caste" and media is no longer mentioning the caste of these castiest people.\n\nWe see everywhere that when one follows "this" religion , there\'s this mindset that they are stupid, idiots, uncouth, lack scientific knowledge, and of communal mindset. This is shown every where from movies to shows, newspaper to social media.\nPeople find it cool to make fun of "this" religion, and if you follow "this" religion you\'re a low iq , low mentality, narrow minded person. People will encourage you , lecture you to become atheist if you follow "this" religion. Also it is seen as really open minded person if you say bad about "particular caste" , blame everything wrong with the society on "particular caste", thinks like "particular caste" go back, smash "particular caste" patriarchy, "particular caste" must die and "particular caste" = Castiest person. But when a terrorist activity happens , and people associate this "other" religion to it, same people will protest against it that you can\'t target a particular religion like this, which is a right thing to do ( IMO) but they do the opposite thing with "particular caste" and also promote things like this.\n\nI can go on there\'s thousands of things to say bad about "this" religion and "particular caste", but these aren\'t the only Evil religion/caste. You can\'t blame everything one a single community, blaming never change things our actions change te society.\n\nSo what\'s your opinion on the Evil of Society?'<br />Author: 'RandomCitizenOfMars'<br />id: 'h7xhze'<br />Flair :BAIT HAI BC</li><li>Title: 'Seeking advice from fellow bratas!'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'h7tg2z'<br />Flair :BAIT HAI BC</li><li>Title: 'Pujari Bhikhari Hai trending on Twitter.'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'apestogetherstoned'<br />id: 'h7r62i'<br />Flair :From Twitter</li><li>Title: "JNU can't face they fact that Aryan invasion theory is wrong and We're sarswati civilization in real.

And beaurocrats have a left bias because of the educational system which the communist infiltrated with success.\n\nNow why does the USA FIGHTS WARS,\nIt's simple,\nCapitalistic gains.\n***And to prevent a country from becoming a regional supremacy***\n\nNow why does USA favours china in many terms, \nIt's because china has them by their throats. US is in debt to china in terms of economic powers and debt. They are in debt to china for some amount close to $1.1 trillion. Many American companies have their manufacturing in China. One thing is appreciable about trump is that he's making sure American companies come back to US.\n\nCommunism is deeply rooted in their beaurocrats, \n\nHow does social media plays a role,\nI'll be adding this in part 3 after doing some more information digging."<br />Author: 'lainfan'<br />id: 'h0lwm5'<br />Flair :Bakchod News</li><li>Title: 'Join r/IndianMemology'<br />Body: 'Hey fellow bakchods join r/IndianMemology for some good wholesome OC memes.
