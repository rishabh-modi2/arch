Well india is going on the same route and we Hindus will be or are feeling alienated today and it's not our fault we have to stand up for our country. If things don't change in the next 5 years, civil was will follow up right after that. We need our country back and shit has to happen now, this might just be the only chance to not have a dark future. We nees to take matters into our hands and it needs to be done now. We can't wait for others anymore, and we all damn well know what I mean by saying taking matter into our hands. I am ready to die for my country and don't give a shit about life anymore and I am only 16 years old. If u r not ready to spill blood for getting a home country then you can't fight the fight.

There are the avatars of Vishnu bhagwan which we praise and worship, then some villages are totally devoted to one devti or devta, some gods and goddesses we might never have heard of. ( For instance Kashmir is considered to be devoted to devi Kashmira,  in himachal we have famous temple of Devi hadimba and so on and so on, there are countless cases) \n\nTo be honest I consider myself as a believer of parmatma or the parm bhraman(the supreme brahman). As sanatanis we should know that parmatma is the greatest and the three major manifestations of him are bhrama, vishnu and shiv. \n\nPoint of discussion is what should we consider our religion to be?\nMonotheistic? Polytheistic? Henotheism? \nAnd what do the members of this sub think of themselves to be? Do they believe only on parmatma, or they treat everything around them like God(just like in Hinduism we treat various things as God) \nAnd if your answer is the later, kindly explain how much manifestations of parmata to consider and to be believed on are healthy. \n\nAt last this is post for learn something new myself and so that other people can learn something about too. рдХреЛрдИ рднреА рднреВрд▓ рдпрд╛ рдЧрд▓рддреА рд╣реБрдИ рд╣реЛ рддреЛ рдорд╛рдлреАред'<br />Author: 'FatalConfusion0'<br />id: 'knn9m3'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion (Vichaar-Vimersh)ЁЯЧия╕ПЁЯЧгя╕П</li>

Then they investigated further and it was found that the registrar was ordered from above that Teesta's case should be sent to the bench of Justice Aftab Alam and for this the muster roll and roster should be changed.

<li>Title: 'The Third Battle of Panipat, 14th of January, 1761'<br />Body: '(This is the last post in the series. I\'ll post relevant related posts, but not all, as I expect you all to lol for them in my profile. Thanks for reading these posts and I hope you enjoy this last one as well.)\n\n\n\nWe resume our story where the two armies were faced off against one another, the Maratha Army as an imperfect inverted crescent and the Durrani as an imperfect crescent itself.\n\n\n\nThe Two Armies at Panipat :\n\n\n\nAccording to Kashi Raj, the Shah had inspected a muster of his troops a day after Dussehra, October 20. The number then, was 41,800 horse and 38,000 foot. Of these 24 \'dastas\' of 1200 men each, or 28,800 men along with 10,000 foot were composed of the Shah\'s regular Afghan force, along with their 200 camel swivels, 40 pieces of artillery and some "shaturnaals". This along with Najib-ud-Daulahsl\'s 6000 horse and 20,000 foot, Hafiz Rahmat and Dunde Khan\'s 15,000 foot and roughly 4,000 horse. Allowing for the fact the pre battle skirmishes had claimed the lives of soldiers on both sides, the Abdali army in the field may be estimated to a total of 60,000\n(this estimate being borne out by Sir Jadunath Sarkar himself)\n\n\n\nNow, we look at Kashi Raj\'s record of Bhau\'s muster at Kunjpura, on October 19, 45,000 horse, 15,000 foot, latter including 9000 Gardi sepoys. Allowing for casualties, estimates show that at Panipat, the army had 45,000 total men on the field.\n\n\n\nDeployment of Forces :\n\n\n\nMaratha Forces \n\n\n\nThe Maratha camp had debated all night regarding a plan of action, yet most historians agree with the conclusion that the conduct of the Battle shows that such a plan did not materialise.\n\n\n\nHence, Bhau\'s army was deployed in part, according to the political situation in the camp and in part, owing to the confidence Bhau placed in individual commanders. He placed Gardi closer to the enemy, at the left, himself in the centre and the Maratha Sardars, whose troops and they themselves were low on morale due to previous defeats, furthest away from Durrani on the left. \n\n\n\nIbrahim Gardi occupied the extreme left wing with 8000 (approx) musketeers. Heavy Maratha cannon were placed in front of the infantry, in 3 deep columns in the form of a spear head, to lead their march. To support him stood, Damaji Gaikwar (2500 horse) and Vithal Shivdeo (1500 horse) and some petty captains (2000 horse) with their light horse.\n\n\n\nBhau and Vishwasrao occupied the centre with their persona Huzurat (13,500 Huzurat cavalry) \n\n\n\nThe Right being formed by Antaji Mankeshwar (1000), Pilaji Jadav\'s son, Satvoji (1500), Yashwantrao Pawar (1500) and Shamsher Bahadur (1500) with Jankoji Scindia (7000) and Malharrao Holkar (3000) contingents, all horse, along with petty captains (2000 horse) at the extreme end. Light artillery was placed in front of these positions.\n\n\n\nDurrani Forces\n\nGiven that Abdali commanded absolute control, he placed his forces in the centre, as a wedge between his Indian Allies to avoid defection. He also held back reserves and himself observed and commanded from his observation post close to his camp.\n\n\n\nThe Durrani Right facing Ibrahim, was under Barkhurdar Khan (3000 Kabuki Infantry) and Amir Beg with Persian Horse. Along with Hafiz Rahmat Khan and Dunde Khan ( 14,000 of which 1/4th was cavalry) followed by Ahmad Khan Bangash (1000 foot) .\n\n\n\nThe Centre was under Wazir Shah Vali Khan with 15,000 troopers, 2,000 camel swivels and 1,000 Kabuli Infantry.\n\n\n\nThe Afghan Left was under Shah Pasand Khan (5000 Persian horse). Najib-ud-Daulah with 15,000 foot and dismounted cavalry followed by Shuja-ud-Daulah with roughly 4000 men 1/3rd of whom were musketeers.\n\n\n\nThe Battle of Panipat 14th of January, 1761 :\n\n\n\nFirst Phase (9 AM to 12 PM noon)\n\n\n\nThe Battle began, as was custom in those days, with a salvo from both sides. The was followed by a Maratha cannonade, meant to carve a way for the Gardi Infantry, yet the inherent faults of Maratha cannons, made the cannonade ineffective. This fiasco continued for an hour, until Ibrahim sized the initiative, halted the cannonade and advanced his musketeers towards the Afghan left. He detached 2 batallions to keep a watch on Barkhurdar Khan and Amir Beg, covering his flanks. The remaining 7 batallions, marched under him personally, slowly towards the enemy. Yet, the infantry outpaced the heavy guns mean to support them.\n\n\n\nThus, the Gardis, now marching towards the enemy fell upon them, killing many in Rohillas, though they were outnumbered. Just then, Vithal Shivdeo, commanding the light horse, made a charge upon the Rohilla foot in front of him, yet the hail of Rohilla bullets, meant that he soon had to retreat. He had broken the order of battle, euffered casualties and had nothing to show for it. Instead, he sapped his soldier\'s morale as well.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Gardis had inflicted a loss of 8-9000 men on the Rohillas. Yet in the exchange, he had lost almost all of 6 battalions. Had Vithal Shivdeo held back, a tremendous charge could have routed the Rohilla left now, yet, as we have already seen, the Maratha commanders and the army had fallen from their disciplined days of old.\n\n\n\nThe Second Phase (12:30 onwards) \n\nIn the centre, Bhau\'s light artillery in front of his troops fired its rounds and Shah Vali Khan, took this as a signal to commence the attack. Soon his camel swivels took down the Maratha light artillery and Bhau knew that he had to reply.\n\n\n\n With their traditional war cry of "Har Har Mahadev!" the pride of Maratha Cavalry, the Huzurat began and impetuous charge so ferocious that the Afghan forces of the centre were swept before them, despite being armed with muskets and Matchlocks. The over-powering and irresistible charge of a sea of 13,500 swords and spears that flashed in the sun, fell like tornado of fury and inflicted heavy casualties on the Afghans. As Kashi Raj himself says "The fighting was so violent that the earth and sky couldn\'t be seen and the eye of heaven became dazzled at the beholding spectacle".\n\n\n\nAnd yet, despite this, the advantage of an Afghan centre in retreat or a beaten Afghan left, couldn\'t be pressed home. The Marathas lacked good cavalry in reserve which could drive home these gains and hold the territory gained, plus, how could Bhau abandon his position, given the camp full of women and civilians in his rear and the Abdali reserves in the enemy camp?\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, when Abdali heard news of these events, he took the following steps. He ordered his "Zenana" to mount their steeds and wait inside his pavilion. Next he commanded the 500 "nasaqchis" or military provosts to drive out by brute force, both retreating and reserve forces. Hence, within an hour, Abdali had reinforced his position with 4-7000 men. On the other hand, such communications were not maintained by Bhau.\n\nThus, by 1 PM, Durrani had fresh troops in the field.\n\n\n\nThe Final Phase (post 1:30 PM)\n\nDurrani had reinforced his lines with fresh troops against the Marathas who were famished for a fortnight not to mention exhausted. He had also commanded all position to advance and take down the enemy before them.\n\n\n\nAll this while the Afghan left had remained silent as well as the Maratha right. However, Najib-ud-Daulah, was the exception this. He was brave, cunning and adventurous. His tactical acumen showed itself here. \n\n\nHe commanded his cavalry to dismount with their muskets and thus instead of cavalry and foot he now had 15,000 musketeers, in total. Next, he ordered his rockets, 2000 of them, to fire at once, to create a thick wall of smoke. Behind this wall, he moved his infantry, quarter of a mile at a time, and they would throw up breast works of sand in front of their lines. Thus, he covered his movement, disorientated  and froze the enemy and advanced in order at the same time. By 1 PM he stood only within a long range musket shit of the Maratha Right.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the centre, Shah Vali Khan had made an attack into the Maratha centre, being reinforced by the Abdali Guard cavalry and foot. He attacked with no restraint and it was during the attack, that an unfortunate zamburak, hit 17-year old nominal commander of Maratha army, Vishwasrao, who now lay dead in his uncle Bhau\'s arm. \n\n\n\nNews of his death spread in the camp and the left and right wings, demoralising all men, which now being raised by a detachment of rebellious Afghans who had been recruited before the Battle. Gardi was overcome by sheer numbers and the impetus of Najib-ud-Daulah\'s attack, forced the right into rout. Here Holkar, Scindia and others retreated with what civilians they could take.\n\n\n\nAnd so, there he was, Sadashivrao Bhau, holding the lifeless corpse of the graceful pride of the Chitpavan Peshwa\'s manhood in his arms, his own nephew, a warrior like his ancestors were, who had died in that hell on Earth called Panipat.\n\n\n\nIn his last desperate and vengeful assault, Bhau charged and rallied his men three times, changed his mount thrice, killing as many Afghans as his strength would allow, until finally he was wounded by a spear and musket shots. He was lurching on the ground when some Durrani horsemen attacked him. "The wounded lion, now cornered" killed 2 of the 3 men attacking him, until he was killed himself. And beheaded.\n\n\n\nI will not say anymore, than this, that both Bhau and his nephew, were given proper Hindu last rites, by the Brahmin Prime Minister of Awadh, Kashi Raj himself. Marathas casualties in terms of troops is estimated 30,000. While the Abdalis suffered 10-20,000 themselves. Surajmal Jat, fed and clothed 50, 000 Maratha men and women fleeing the site. More could be said, but the Battle is what we are interested in.\n\n\n\nSources : "Marathas and Panipat" by Hari Ram Gupta\n\n\n\n"Ahmad Shah Abdali in India" and "Fall of Mughal Empire Vol I and II" by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n"Military System of the Marathas" by S.N Sen\n\n\n\n"Ahwal-eJang-e-Bhau-va-Ahmad" by Kashi Raj\n\n\n\n\nLinks to related posts :\n\n\n\nA Case in Favour of Sadashivrao Bhau - https://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/kay508/a_case_in_the_favour_of_sadashivrao_bhau/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\n\n\nThird Battle of Panipat, 1761.

I feel great satisfaction where I am but also a pain that's crippling. It looks like I'm alone in a valley of despair but my inner sky is musical and happy.\n\nEssentially I've embarked on a journey where I'll have to travel alone. My family tells me I'll fail. The world tells me I'll fail. But my heart vibrates with joy at what I'm about to do. There are moments of doubt in which I almost cede control and surrender. Its probably divine providence that confers on me wisdom in such delicate moments. It's exceedingly difficult to march forward while the world's trying to fetter you. Unrestrained criticism, condemnation from loved ones and the prospect of a spectacular failure do bother me.\n\n\nI've embraced an entrepreneurial mission which is daunting to say the least. I've made all the preparations and the rubber is ready to hit the ground. I believe there's potential in my business. But noone else thinks so.

<li>Title: 'MOHAMMED WAS IN PETRA NOT MECCA, Real KABA was in Petra and QURAN IS FAKE'<br />Body: "Some revealtions about Islam I gathered from various sources.\n\n1. Quran says that Mecca is a city in settled in a valley between two hills named SAFA and MARWA, . The altitude of hills is such that an enemy army can hide on its other side and you can't see them from this side. Now you go on hajj and see SAFA and MARWA , they are just some foot tall rocks And they are covered by roofs. Their distance is 450 m apart. How can a city be placed in a place of 450 m and how can a at hide behind a rock just some foot tall and wide . In Quran mecaa isentioned a city sided by hills on two sides and on other two sides, it's surrounded by 2 man made walls. Also Quran says there is river flowing from mecaa. But as we know theere is no river in whole of Saudi , let alone Mecca. \n\n2. Quran says that Mecca has farming of grapes, olive ,2 different kind of grasses and gardens lush of greenery and it's a oasis of life , greenery and desert In water. This doesnt fit for Mecca as the nearest oasis from there is 560 km away. Quran says that Mecca has 2 entrances one from higher part and one from lower . So we can conclude that Mecca is placed on a slope like area. But if you go to Mecca and see it geography, it is located on Plain ground and also it had historically 6 different entrances for coming and going out of city. \n\n3. Quran says that Mecca was a major trade hub.and it had hundreds of fair of horses and camels each year . .but scientific and archealogical evdidences. show that the old trade routes during Mohammed 200BC-600AD were at least 240 km away from Mecca . How the fuck will you water so many animals without a oasis or river .\n\n4. In first hundred years of Islam , every mosque qibla ( place where face of mosque is located) were at Petra and not Mecca. In two hundred years some qiblas were at Petra , some at Mecca , some at the centre point of line  joining Petra and Mecca and some parallel to line joining Mecca and Petra (this type of mosques were prevalent in North Africa and  Spain) \n\n5. Till here we proved that that Mecca was not mohammwd birth place and not the origin of Islam ,neither was KABA( KALA DABBA ) in Mecca . Here. Are points that proove the things instated in Quran and Hadiths mentioned for Quran actually fit true 100% for Petra \n\n6. PETRA is surrounded by two big hills and this city is located in the valley between hills. This city has two entrances , one from higher end and one from lower.this city has been found to contain spores and soil which is fertile. Even now crops are cultivated near Petra archealogical site. Petra was a big home of Arab pagans . Various Arab pagans came here to the Kaba . Petra was historically on silk route and other trade routes, so many traders and animal fairs were organised here.to feed them a river was diverted to form an excellent canal in surrounding of Petra city . \n\n7. The most important point is that in every major Arab city be it Israel Saudi or Yemen you require archealogical department permission to form new buildings.but till date no kind of archaeological evidence is found in Mecca dating to time of Mohamed or early. Medina has evidences but no mention of Mecca.\n\nIf you find this interesting, I will post in future new revealtions about Islam and Quran."<br />Author: 'Lopardest'<br />id: 'km9vzl'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihaad_Halal Certified</li>

You don't have the time to call Hindu organization every time. In emergency, family males will do the protection. \n\nNow don't tell me that this is not practical bla bla bla. \nYou'd decide, you can send your child to a less premium school or even send to kv school instead of paying Lacs of rupee per year.

<li>Title: 'I found this on a certain subreddit.Are libchhuts becoming more self aware?'<br />Body: "Unironic Problems With Libranduism\n\nI am un-circlejerking here for a second just to address some problems with leftism that need to be addressed\n\nReligion\n\nAttacking religion itself is unproductive. Rather, it is a lot more productive to use religion itself to promote libranduism. If the Goan Inquisition, Muslim and then British rule was not enough to convert India, le enlightened atheist won't either especially if it's talking down to religious people which the vast majority of people in India, especially the poor are. It is a lot more effective to use religious interpretations to push for leftist values.\nJesus was anti-capitalist, Buddha was anti-casteist, Rama was pro-lgbt and Muhammad was pro-pubg player.\nThis is just better optics for us and actually works better. It is a lot easier to sell leftist values to religious people if you convince them that this is what their god actually says.\nSide note but\xa0r/ex_hindu\xa0is genuinely a shitfest. Posting defence.pk memes to own the Hindus epic gamer style is very cringe.\n\nCommunism\n\nLook guys, I sympathise with socialists and anarchists. But in this political climate it is unironically impossible for a socialist country to survive. The USSR does not exist anymore, a socialist country would have to be isolationist and would suffer blockade upon blockade by imperialist forces. It is best we stick to criticising capitalism but understand that it is a necessary evil now.\n\nReactionary politics\n\nI get that the BJP is a shitstain but don't lose your heads. Ashok Swain is one of the worst reactionary librandus I have ever seen. Guy has officially gone full retard. Never go full retard.\n\nSeparatist advocation\n\nI am aware that these people are a small minority among the left but nevertheless they do exist. Just because I am against the using of pellet guns on unarmed protestors, does not mean I support the secession of a state. Just because I advocate for adivasi rights, does not mean I support naxal separatism.\nI would much rather the government come to an agreement with these groups for peace. At the very least, it's bad optics to push for secession and gives the left less credibility.\n\nAdvocation of violence\n\nAgain, a small minority but still. Remember when the CAA protestors burned down a couple buses and all the sanghis lost their fucking minds and all of a sudden became peaceful Gandhians appalled by leftist barbarism?\nHindutva is dependent on a delusional victimhood mentality and by engaging in violence you are just feeding into that delusion and perceived hypocrisy.\n\n\nNot sharing leftist ideas\n\nI have massive respect for people like Kannhaiya Kumar and Shehla Rashid. They really go out there and share leftist values and ideas.\nI understand not everyone has that kind of platform but the internet is a very important place to start with if you have no better way. Right wing NPCs practically dominate everywhere on Twitter, and you have a small minority of randians clinging to their echo chambers circlejerking on how secular they are.\nOn the left, a lot of the rhetoric is missing. And many are just reactionaries. Understand that when the right dominates a platform, they are the ones informing the majority of people what it is that you believe. Most people unironically think that leftism is hating India and the more you hate India, the more leftist you are."<br />Author: 'Delicious-Peanut-215'<br />id: 'km7juz'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion (Vichaar-Vimersh)ЁЯЧия╕ПЁЯЧгя╕П</li>

<li>Title: 'The Gupta Age (300 - 500 AD)'<br />Body: '# History often Repeats Itself.\n\nJust like Chandragupta Maurya had founded the Mauryan Dynasty in 320BC, just so did a Chandragupta find the Gupta dynasty in 320 AD. He is often referred to as **Chandragupta I**\n\nJust like Chandragupta Maurya, Chandragupta I had the misfortune of being upstaged by a more illustrious successor - **Samudragupta**.\n\n**Earlier Guptas**\n\nChandragupta\'s father was **Ghatotakacha Gupta** and his grandfather was **Sri Gupta**. Not much is known about these two. Sri Gupta built a temple for Chinese Buddhists who would come to tour the sites associated with Buddha.\n\n**Chandragupta I**\n\nHis territory stretched along the Ganga from Magadha (Southern Bihar) to Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh. It\'s not known how he conquered Magadha. It may have come to him as a marriage settlement. Kumaradevi, his chief queen was a descendant of the Licchavi rajas who were defeated by Ajatashatru 700 years ago.\n\n**Samudra-Gupta**\n\nThe most famous of the Guptas. He came to the throne in 335 AD and died in 380 AD. Long lists of kings and regions were subdued by the prowess of his arm in battle.\n\nThe first campaign led Samudra-Gupta to the west where he uprooted kingdoms in Bareilly and Mathura regions of what is now Uttar Pradesh and in neighboring Rajasthan. They were incorporated in the Gupta Kingdom.\n\nNext he headed south down the eastern seaboard and elbowed aside a dozen more rivals. He turned back only after capturing Vishnugopa, the Pallava kingdom of Kanchipuram (near Madras).\n\nFurther campaigns in the north saw Gupta forces overrunning most of Bengal, exterminating independent republics like of the Yaudheyas west of Delhi, and establishing Gupta Rule throughout the ancient Aryavarta (The land of UP, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and eastern parts of Rajasthan and Punjab). This became the core region of the Guptas.\n\nNow indisputably "The unconquered conqueror of unconquered kings", Samudra-Gupta stood on the threshold of a pan-Indian empire.\n\n**The Guptas annex the Western Satraps**\n\nRama Gupta briefly succeeded Samudra-Gupta and attempted to uproot the Western Satraps in Malwa. But he was defeated. The price of surrender was to surrender his queen to them. The lust filled Shaka Satrap wanted the queen for himself and Rama Gupta conceded defeat and agreed to hand her over. However his lust would lead to his own downfall.\n\nRama Gupta\'s brother infiltrated the enemy\'s camp dressed as Queen Dhruvadevi, and promptly slew the Satrap. After the disgrace of Rama Gupta, it was his righteous brother who became the next emperor of the Gupta Dynasty, known to us as **Chandragupta II**. He may have had to kill Rama Gupta in the process, and then eventually he claimed the hand of Dhruvadevi.\n\nChandragupta II\'s main offensive was against the Shaka Satraps. By the year 409 the Shaka territories of the Western Satraps were annexed by the Guptas, and the western Satraps were heard of no more.\n\nSuccess against the Satraps gave the Guptas access to the ports of Gujarat and to the profits of it\'s international maritime trade. There and throughout central India, the Guptas became involved with the Vakatakas, the dynasty which succeeded the Satavahanas as the dominant force in the deccan.\n\nThe Cultural Achievements of the Gupta Empire flourished during Chandragupta II\'s reign.\n\n**Alliance with the Vakatakas**\n\nThe Guptas formed a dynastic alliance with the Vakatakas. Chandragupta II\'s daughter was betrothed to Rudrasena II, the Vakataka king. The latter soon died and the ensuing regency (490 - 410 AD) was controlled by **Prabhavati**, the Gupta Queen, who as regent controlled the Vakataka state in accordance with Gupta policy.\n\nChandragupta II, like his predecessor Samudra-Gupta and his successor Kumara-Gupta, reigned for about 40 years. Such longevity for 3 generations is exceptional and must have been an important factor in the stability of the Gupta Rule.\n\n**Kumara-Gupta**\n\nKumara-Gupta ruled from 415-455 AD. In his reign there was one major uprising by one Pushyamitra in Malwa. It ruined the fortunes of the Gupta Family. Soon after there appeared on the scene foreign invaders in the form of the Hunas, a branch of the Hiung-nu of Chinese history and the Huns of European history.\n\nAn offshoot of this horde, the Epthalites of White Huns had established themselves in Bactria in the late 4th century. In the mid fifth century they followed their Kushana predecessors across the Hindu Kush and into Gandhara, and they pushed east against the Guptas.\n\n**Skanda-Gupta**\n\nFortunately, the Guptas produced a champion in the form of Skanda-Gupta, the son of Kumara Gupta. He took the field successively against Pushyamitra. He then made good a doubtful claim to succeed his father, and finally repulsed the Huns.\n\nSkanda-Gupta and his son, both paragons of virtue, built a massive embankment when Rudraman\'s reservoir was in turn overwhelmed by floodwaters, where they also built a temple.\n\n**Later Guptas**\n\nAfter the death of Skanda-Gupta in 467 AD, his nephew Budha-Gupta, then another nephew, his son and then his grandson succeeded the throne well into the 6th century.\n\nBut their reigns were mostly brief and by 510 AD, other Guptas, who may or may not have been related to them, opted as independent rulers within the core area of the erstwhile empire.\n\nIn that year, the Huns led by a formidable leader Toramana, were again on the move. They overran Kashmir and Punjab and defeated a Gupta army near Gwalior, thus extending their rule to Malwa.\n\nThus the Golden Age of the Guptas eventually came to an end.'<br />Author: 'horrorlover2'<br />id: 'km1614'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture (Bharatiye Itihaas aur Sanskriti)</li>

We need to get out of the rhetoric of " media biased, NCERT islamic and british whitewahing", we are already aware of that but only keep beating around this bush without doing anything, hence there is no further intellectual discussion, as a result we are no better than whiners.\n\nFirst of all, all social media is created to support the left, so fighting for rights in their platforms is wasting time, already Indic SM exist but convenience makes us stay on leftist platforms\n\nSecond, we need to realise that a Sense of tribalism which you\'ll see exists within these communities, however when it comes to us we discard Hindu tribalism(as in supporting someone on the basis of them being true to your cause first, and then seeing the righteousness within that closed group of your people) for mere righteousness, this is used against us,\n\nThird, we don\'t have a vocal groundwork unity that does Hindu related work, from taking care of local temples, to raising awareness of the Hindu cause, protecting and following festivals and rituals, we assume RSS will do it, but from what I\'ve experienced they are not doing things as per their founding ideology, infact local hindutva groups are doing more in these aspects(stopping conversions, starting sanskrit pathshalas etc.) But their work is getting shunned because if their small numbers and small reach.\n\nFourth, even having a niche platform like this, all we have done so far is sharing news and discussing who r\\*ndia banned, instead we can use such platforms to form country wide small sanghi networking groups, to facilitate point 3, anything, any help, any association would happen within this group, this would be a mitra mandali as was done by savarakar at his time, this would help closeted Sanghis to become more vocal, infact many of the social work is over taken by leftist which drive the narrative, thus by using SM to truly faciliate offline groundwork we can counter them\n\nFifth, recognising Hindu businesses, especially reviving jhatka, and promoting them within the Hindu community, this is essentially what Indic ecosystem would be one that is intellectually and economically backed, also seeing a pattern of how things bad for isl\\*mic and Christian faiths are forcefully adopted within our customs, thus pig farming should be promoted for jhatka, this would effectively counter all beef related nonsense\n\nPolitical parties will only count in votes, if we want Hindu Rashtra, we need to depend on our dharma than political entities.\n\nThat\'s all I had in mind Bhrata that I feel will eventually be making Hindu samaj well networked, and effective as a community, feel free to add more suggestions\n\nAlso look into this video as well, [The Mirage of Hindu Unity](https://youtu.be/WMo7BSS7JAw)'<br />Author: 'brown_vandamme'<br />id: 'klrbc9'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion (Vichaar-Vimersh)ЁЯЧия╕ПЁЯЧгя╕П</li>

And the last one, How far should we be willing to go,hindus have always had the victor's mentality deeply embedded in them while the rest of them always used their victim card as a weapon of expansion and deceit,we sure can't go around wearing bomb-jackets like them so how do we counter them? What according to you is the way ahead?  \n\nAnd if I were to put the gist of all my questions into one, What do you think is the way Sanatana(eternal) Dharma should really adapt to,to keep being into existence and keep being eternal,its own namesake, what if the long term way for Hinduism ahead for us to survive?\n\nThank you everyone!"<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'kl7iym'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion (Vichaar-Vimersh)ЁЯЧия╕ПЁЯЧгя╕П</li>

Regardless of whether Bhajipao wins every election or not,ideologically it has won in uniting the Hindus at a scale no one has ever done before. And that shows in the way how lately TMC,INC and CPI have been trying to suck up to us in the form of Hindu appeasement, or as Mamata didi just a while ago said "Chadda,nadda,fadda, they\'re outsiders, I\'m the real Hindu,not them" or maybe how Congress sucked up to us on Vaikuntha Ekadasi, and wished us instead of Christians on Christmas day. \n\nHence, Ideologically I would say it\'s safe to conclude that we\'ve already paved a winning warpath for us until atleast 2030 as Hindus, and  unless a mishap occurs, nobody can make us tread off it, also don\'t mind a little appeasement from the Bhajipao, they aren\'t going to betray us anytime soon in the future for the next 5-10 years, or atleast till when the current hierarchy/leadership is maintained. \n\nTo end with a quote from Veer Savarkar ji to give you some food for thought and to make you realize why I\'m saying what I wrote above-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d6yqe4tqzp761.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20b8cb058eb94d10928cb147930ae8ca25290815'<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'kl2lfx'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion (Vichaar-Vimersh)ЁЯЧия╕ПЁЯЧгя╕П</li>

<li>Title: 'Lord Vishnu is the Supreme Being according to the Rig Veda'<br />Body: "I've noticed something among many people I've met in real life and also most people in this subreddit. People seem to have this misconception that Vishnu is a minor god in the Vedas. \n\nThat is not true. Below I have put a few verses from the Rig Veda which gives some credence to Vishnu being the creator of the universe. \n\nP.S - (**рд╡рд┐рд╖реНрдгреЛрдГ**) is Vishnu, however I learnt that it also refers to Shiva. So the below verses are also applicable to Shiva. So if you are a follower of Lord Shiva then he is the one who is the supreme being in the Vedas. I am a Vaishnava so that is why I am referring to **рд╡рд┐рд╖реНрдгреЛрдГ** as Vishnu and not Shiva. But all the below verses can apply to Lord Shiva as well.\n\nRig Veda 1.22.20:   \n**рддрдж рд╡рд┐рд╖реНрдгреЛрдГ рдкрд░рдордВ рдкрджрдВ рд╕рджрд╛ рдкрд╢реНрдпрдиреНрддрд┐ рд╕реВрд░рдпрдГ |**  \n**рджрд┐рд╡реАрд╡ рдЪрдХреНрд╖реБрд░рд╛рддрддрдо ||**\n\n&gt; Vishnu occupies the paramount position.

Indra, on the other hand, is only glorious circumstantially.\n\nRig Veda 1.156.2:   \n **рдпрдГ рдкреВреТрд░реНрд╡реНрдпрд╛рдпреС рд╡реЗреТрдзрд╕реЗреТ рдирд╡реАреСрдпрд╕реЗ рд╕реБреТрдордЬреНрдЬрд╛реСрдирдпреЗреТ рд╡рд┐рд╖реНрдгреСрд╡реЗреТ рджрджрд╛реСрд╢рддрд┐ ред**   \n**рдпреЛ рдЬрд╛реТрддрдореСрд╕реНрдп рдорд╣реТрддреЛ рдорд╣рд┐реТ рдмреНрд░рд╡реТрддреНрд╕реЗрджреБреТ рд╢реНрд░рд╡реЛреСрднрд┐реТрд░реНрдпреБрдЬреНрдпрдВреС рдЪрд┐рджреТрднреНрдпреСрд╕рддреН рее** \n\n&gt;Vishnu is the most ancient of all, yet also the most recent. Nothing and no one creates Vishnu, yet Vishnu creates everyone and everything.\n\nSo while Indra is the Lord of Paradise in the Rig Veda, Vishnu is still the creator of the universe.  \n\nVishnu *does* take an inferior position to Indra whenever he is referred to as *Upendra*. This name is specific to Vishnu in the form of the dwarf, Vamana, who incarnated as the *younger brother* (and thus the junior) of Indra, to take the three strides mentioned so often in Rig Veda. This is why people think that Indra is Vishnu's older brother in the Rig Veda. He is not. He is the older brother to Upendra, who is the Vamana Avatara. \n\nI hope this cleared some misconceptions. The Puranas didn't retcon anything much. Even back during the Vedic Age people did see Vishnu/Shiva as God, and Indra and the Devas were gods. God is very different from gods. \n\nAlso, even Krishna is mentioned in the Rig Veda. Though Krishna is not mentioned by name in the below text, it states that Narayana defeated Kaliya. You guys cannot tell me you don't know Kaliya, the multi headed snake that Krishna defeated by dancing on its heads.  \n\n**рдпрдореБрдирд╛-рд╣реНрд░рджреЗ рд╣рд┐ рд╕реЛ рдпрд╛рддреЛ**  \n**рдпреЛ рдирд╛рд░рд╛рдпрдг-рд╡рд╛рд╣рдирдГ**  \n**рдпрджрд┐ рдХрд╛рд▓рд┐рдХ-рджрдиреНрддрд╕реНрдп**  \n**рдпрджрд┐ рдХрд╛рдХрд╛рд▓рд┐рдХрд╛рджреН рднрдпрдореН**  \n**рдЬрдиреНрдо-рднреВрдорд┐-рдкрд░рд┐рддреНрд░рд╛рддреЛ**  \n**рд╡рд┐рд░реНрд╡рд┐рд╖реЛ рдпрд╛рддрд┐ рдХрд╛рд▓рд┐рдХрдГ**\n\n***yamun─Б-hrade hi so y─Бto***  \n***yo n─Бr─Бyaс╣Зa-v─Бhanaс╕е***  \n***yadi k─Бlika-dantasya***  \n***yadi k─Бk─Бlik─Бd bhayam***  \n***janma-bh┼лmi-paritr─Бto***  \n***virviс╣гo y─Бti k─Бlikaс╕е***\n\n*He visited the lake within the Yamuna river,*  \n*The carrier of Narayana (Garuda),*  \n*Fear not KaliyaтАЩs fangs*  \n*Fear not KaliyaтАЩs poison*  \n*For he who protects his birthplace*  \n*Has made Kaliya harmless*"<br />Author: 'Darkstorm999'<br />id: 'kl0s10'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm ЁЯХЙя╕П</li>

Why MSP can\'t be legalised? \n\nlet\'s talk about it for a second. hurr durr why government can\'t fix MSP when they can fix circle rates. first off, there\'s a difference between those two. government fixes circle rate but it doesn\'t assure everyone that government is going to procure those flats at circle rate. a flat/house can stay empty for years and government still won\'t buy it at circle rate. Crops are perishable and farmers don\'t have the capacity to store it for long. \n\nalso, you dumbfucks always want a good deal for anything you purchase as a consumer, so riddle me this... why would a private company procure wheat at msp of over тВ╣1900 when he can purchase the same in international market for тВ╣1300 - тВ╣1400.\n\n2. why shouldn\'t the government procure at MSP? \n\nbecause that\'ll require the government to spend 15 lakh crore every year on food procurement. that\'s 170 billion dollars every year. FCI neither has the storage capacity, nor it has the need because FCI procures in preparedness and for PDS and for both these things, government already procures more than enough grains. \n\n3. why should farmers take losses? \n\nbecause farming, especially with the archaic technology our farmers use will never be profitable. if they want to "stick to their culture of farming" then let them enjoy the repercussions of those choice. farming, with all the modern technology out there is a break even profession, and with out dinosaur age technology... a deal made for losses. \n\n\nhere\'s an open challenge to you dumdums, come and argue on these facts and let\'s see how long you last.

But when you ask the same people why Anil Ambani the richest Indian once upon a time with close ties to Modi/ NDA govt and Manhmohan singh/UPA govt became bust. They can't come up with shit. Anil Ambani has huge influence in policy favouring him and yet became bust. The fact is he became bust because he took on debt and gave zero fucks about working to ensure he can deleverage or future proofing. He never future proofed his investments fueled by debt. He never gave a shit and got by by thinking since he is rich and has high influence with UPA and NDA govt's and he will never go broke and yet he went bust. Now look at Adani that guy has took on debt but he also made sure to make his investments future proof. \n\nExample 1 Adani green \n\nSolar energy is going to be in big demand and he invested in it and made sure he has power purchase agreement with all govt. With some of the lowest power traiffs in the world. \n\nAdani transmission\n\nHe took out debt and invested in high DC current transmission. Why because solar energy will be huge in future and Solar energy produces DC power. Once again future proofing his investments.\n\nAdani Gas\n\nHe made his infrastructure in a way that once LNG( Natural gas) runs out. He can use the existing infrastructure to supply green hydrogen. Once again future proofing his assets and debt. \n\nSo, next time assholes who know jack shit shove these facts down their throats.

<li>Title: 'So what do people here think about Christmas?'<br />Body: "We only have less than maybe 1% Christians in the country but Christmas has nearly as big a presence as Diwali. Maybe not as much but it's definitely big. \n\nMy opinion is it makes sense because businesses want to sell things and Christmas and New Year combined is a pretty big sales opportunity. We don't see people celebrating it but mostly just malls and restaurants, etc. \n\nI don't mind, I'm one of those that think this is what's beautiful about our country. And if we can make the case for giant statues funded by the tax payer in the name of tourism (economy) surely we can't argue against the business economics of Christmas which is actually funded by the businesses themselves. \n\nAnd we see Diwali is getting a similar traction in the west, it's not quite there but it's getting there. I don't see why diwali might not in the near future become a non religious celebration of light and good in the west like christmas is just a fun time here. Indians love festivals after all, we just need an excuse."<br />Author: 'vivektwr23'<br />id: 'kjum7r'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li>

The Vedic scriptures and Jain Aagams contain a lot of knowledge and were the important centres of astronomical research for ages.  \n\n\n4 Key arguments of the Petitioners:  \n\n\n1. During the time of the ruler Qutubuddin Aibak, the mosque was built by breaking the temples located in the Qutub-Minar complex. Qutubuddin Aibak could not completely demolish the temples, so some parts of it were torn down and made mosques from his material.  \n\n\n2. The walls, pillars and ceilings of the existing complex have paintings and religious symbols of deities. These include the images of Lord Ganesha, Vishnu, Yaksha-Yakshini, Dwarpal, Parshvanath, Mahavira, Nataraja and signs of Mangal Kalash, conch, mace, shriyantra, bells and sacred lotus.  \n\n\n3. The complex\'s 9 inner and outer structures symbolize the architecture of ancient Hindu and Jain temples. The corridor is completely built in Vedic style. It has galleries showing the sacred inscriptions on the pillars.  \n\n\n4.The brief history of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) also mentions the demolition of temples and the construction of mosques in Qutub-Minar.  \n\n\nThe Saket Court has accepted the PIL after the first hearing and offered 2 months of time to gather proofs including all exact photos, and prepare documents including ancient scriptures that indicate towards the existence of these temples. \n\nThis decision was ordered today itself.\n\nSource-[https://www.dnaindia.com/india/news-delhi-court-to-consider-on-dec-24-suit-to-restore-temples-in-qutub-minar-complex-2860860](https://www.dnaindia.com/india/news-delhi-court-to-consider-on-dec-24-suit-to-restore-temples-in-qutub-minar-complex-2860860)'<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'kje4gr'<br />Flair :Bakchod News :news:</li>

<li>Title: 'High fuel prices: central excise which has increased manifold since 2014'<br />Body: 'When BJP leaders claim that revenue from fuel prices is used for welfare schemes, they are being economical with the truth. What is more the share of states from tax on fuel has steadily gone down\n\nF uel prices in India have skyrocketed this month, recording a historic high. After assuming office in 2014, NDA Government which has steadily hiked central excise duty to levels which are five times or even higher than in 2014, has persistently refused to reduce it to provide some relief to people.\n\nNeither the pandemic nor the lockdown and the slump in the economy or growing joblessness have persuaded the government to do otherwise\n\n\nWhen in the opposition,BJP used to oppose tooth and nail even small hikes in excise duty in petrol and diesel, totally overlooking the fact that under recoveries of oil companies had spiraled out of control and touched a whopping Rs. 1.61 lakh Crores in 2012-13. Prices were then high also because international prices of crude oil were at a record high. Prices were high despite the subsidies given by the UPA Government to diesel, kerosene and LPG, which provided a cushion to domestic consumers.\n\nThe BJP Government at the Centre, on the other hand, has been busy lowering or withdrawing subsidies. And despite oil prices in international markets having remained consistently low for the last six years, Indian consumers have continued to pay a high price.\n\n\nWe should not forget the fact that the international crude oil prices fluctuated above $110/barrel between 2011-2013 and threatened fiscal discipline and deficit of the central government with the oil import bills upsetting estimates.\n\nCentral Government deregulated the prices of petrol on 25.06.2010 and diesel on 19.10.2014, as the subsidies spiraled up due to the high international crude oil price, which resulted in large holes in central finances. But over the years, the fuel have become one of the biggest tax revenue contributors to the Union Government. The excise duty collection by Government directly comes from a handful of refineries, therefore it is swift and efficient unlike other taxes. As per the data by PPAC, the crude oil price per barrel, which cost $107.14/barrel (тВ╣6655.54/barrel) in March 2014 fell to $41.53/barrel (Rs.3050.38/barrel) in October, 2020\nPetrol and diesel prices on 15.03.2014 were тВ╣73.20/litre and тВ╣55.48/litre respectively which have now soared to a historical high as Petrol and diesel prices touched тВ╣90.34/litre and тВ╣80.51/litre respectively in Mumbai on December 16, 2020.\n\nLet us examine DelhiтАЩs fuel prices to understand how taxes are levied on both petrol and diesel. As of December 16, 2020, prices of petrol and diesel in Delhi were тВ╣83.71 and тВ╣73.87 respectively. However, the base price including freight of Petrol is still тВ╣27.74 per litre, which is just 33.1% of the retail selling price (RSP) of тВ╣83.71. In case of diesel, this is тВ╣28.66, i.e., 38.8% of the RSP.\n\nFrom every single litre of petrol sold in Delhi, the central government now collects тВ╣32.98 as central excise duty, which is 119% of the base price including freight while the state VAT comes to тВ╣19.32, which is 70% of the base price including freight.\n\nSimilarly, in case of diesel, the Central excise duty is тВ╣31.83, which is 111% of the base price including freight and State VAT is тВ╣10.85, ie, 37.9% of the base price including freight.\n\nAs per the data provided by the Petroleum Planning &amp; Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the Petroleum Ministry, during 2019-20, Central Government collected тВ╣2.23 lakh Crores from excise duty on fuel. The Union Budget 2020-21 anticipated тВ╣2.67 lakh Crores as excise duty from the fuel, which comes 16.3% of the total tax revenue of тВ╣16.539 lakh crores.\n\nThe present excise duty on petrol is тВ╣32.98, which, when UPA-2 left office was just тВ╣9.48 per litre. In other words, excise duty on petrol is 348% higher now than in 2014. Similarly, the present excise duty on diesel is тВ╣31.83 which has increased by 894% more than тВ╣3.56, when UPA-2 remitted office.\n\nThe central government not only hiked the excise duty but they have also tweaked its components in such a way that the component which goes to the divisible pool to be shared among states is reduced substantially while the Cess, which goes to the CentreтАЩs kitty, increases. The central government has strict regulatory control and say over how the Cess shall be shared among the states under various Centrally Sponsored Schemes.\n\nWhen UPA-2 left office, the basic excise duty that went to the divisible pool was тВ╣6.35 out of a total excise duty of тВ╣9.48, ie, 67%. But now the basic excise duty has shrunk to тВ╣2.98 out of the total excise duty of тВ╣32.98, ie, just 9% of the total excise duty collected by the Centre.\n\nSimilarly,the current basic excise duty on diesel going to the divisible pool and collected by the Centre is тВ╣4.83, ie, 15.2% of the total excise duty of тВ╣31.83. This is a classic example of the hypocrisy of the principle of co-operative federalism by which the Prime Minister and the BJP Government at the Centre swear.\n\nThis BJP Government has hiked and tweaked the excise duty 15 times after assuming office in 2014.\n\nIndian citizens are now conditioned to pay high fuel prices, thanks to exorbitant taxation by the central government, and they limit their outrage in social media and take the burden without any protest.\n\nSome experts believe petroleum products should be brought under the GST as a panacea for the high taxation now imposed on the fuel. But as total taxation on petrol by both Centre and state governments comes to 189% of the base price and freight, how to bring fuel prices under a flat and uniform GST regime is a great conundrum waiting to be solved'<br />Author: 'lucifersci'<br />id: 'kjc57n'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

You eat rice, you eat barley, you eat gram and you eat sesame. These are specifically meant for you. \n\nDo not kill those who are capable of being fathers and mothers."the wording is pretty unambiguous here, do not kill those capable of producing progeny on their own for food,almost all of the animal kingdom except some asexual organisms\n\nAnother mantra in Atharvaveda says, "It is definitely a great sin to kill innocents. Do not kill our cows, horses and people.\n\n"Atharvaveda 10.1.29Anumantaa vishasitaa nihantaa krayavikrayee Samskartaa chopahartaa cha khadakashcheti ghaatakaah \n\nManusmrithi 5.51 Those who permit slaying of animals; those who bring animals for slaughter; those who slaughter; those who sell meat; those who purchase meat; those who prepare dish out of it; those who serve that meat and those who eat are all murderers.\n\nanother one condemning killing of animals capable of reproduction\n\nYa aamam maansamadanti paurusheyam cha ye kravih Garbhaan khaadanti keshavaastaanito naashayaamasi Atharvaveda 8.6.23  We ought to destroy those who eat cooked as well as uncooked meat, meat involving destruction of males and females, foetus and eggs.\n\nAghnyaa yajamaanasya pashoonpahi Yajurveda 1.1  тАЬO human! animals are Aghnya тАУ not to be killed.

How could the same philosophy which prays for well-being of every soul in every moment of life, approve of killing animals?\n\nI mean,it was too naive to think so dudethat a philosophy that views all creatures as equals souls that are part of bramhan,how can such a culture promote meat-eating\n\nbut it\'s not your or my fault,we only get to read what the foreigner "indologists" interpret for us, and they clearly have always done it so as to brainwash Sanatanis and promote their vested interests\n\nI did some reading into the yajnas and the process to conduct yajnas as well, animal sacrifice throughout yajnas,occult was something looked down upon in most slokasThe Rigveda describes Yajna as Adhvara or non violent throughout. Same is the case with all the other Vedas. How can it be then concluded that the Vedas permit violence or slaughter of animals?  The biggest accusation of cattle and cow slaughter comes in the context of the Yajnas that derived their names from different cattle like the Ashwamedh Yajna, the Gomedha Yajna and the Nar-medh Yajna. \n\nEven by the wildest stretch of the imagination the word Medha would not mean slaughter in this context.in fact this is what the Yajurveda says about slaughter of a horse\n\nImam ma himsirekashafam pashum kanikradam vaajinam vaajineshu Yajurveda 13.48  Do not slaughter this one hoofed animal that neighs and who goes with a speed faster than most of the animalsAswamedha does not mean horse sacrifice at Yajna. \n\nInstead the Yajurveda clearly mentions that a horse ought not to be slaughtered.  In Shathapatha, Ashwa is a word for the nation or empire  The word medha does not mean slaughter. It denotes an act done in accordance to the intellect Alternatively it could mean consolidation, as evident from the root meaning of medha i.e. medhru san-ga-me \n\n Raashtram vaa ashwamedhah Annam hi gau Agnirvaa ashwah Aajyam medhah (Shatpath [13.1.6.3](http://13.1.6.3/)) or as the arya samaj founder, Dayanand saraswati said as well\n\nA Yajna dedicated to the glory, wellbeing and prosperity of the Rashtra the nation or empire is known as the Ashwamedh yajna.  тАЬTo keep the food pure or to keep the senses under control, or to make the food pure or to make a good use of the rays of Sun or keep the earth free from impurities\\[clean\\] is called Gomedha YajnaтАЭ.  тАЬThe word Gau also means the Earth and the yajna dedicated to keep the Earth the environment clean is called Gomedha YajnaтАЭ \n\n тАЬThe cremation of the body of a dead person in accordance with the principles laid down in the Vedas is called Naramedha YajnaтАЭ\n\nThe same principle is observed clearly in the classification of the three kinds of traits in the vedic culture- Satogun or the "noblest of all" food habits help develop the noblest of mindsets and traits,it\'s supposed to a pure vegetarian diet also excluding any pungent materials like onion and garlic,or chilli as well\n\nGods and devas are supposed to belong to this class,meat can\'t be offered to them as prasadam,anywhere where it\'s done is probably an occult or tantric traditioneven rigveda abolishes slaughter of BOTH cows and bull\n\nAare gohaa nrhaa vadho vo astu Rigveda 7.56.17the sloka says that murder of a cow is equivalent to human murder\n\nSooyavasaad bhagavatee hi bhooyaa atho vayam bhagvantah syaama Addhi trnamaghnye vishwadaaneem piba shuddhamudakamaacharantee \n\nRigveda 1.164.40 or Atharv 7.73.11 or Atharv 9.10.20  The Aghnya cows тАУ which are not to be killed under any circumstancesтАУ may keep themselves healthy by use of pure water and green grass, so that we may be endowed with virtues, knowledge and wealth.\n\netymology in the vedic lexicon Nighantu agrees as well\n\nAghnya the one that ought not to be killed \n\nAhi the one that must not be slaughtered. \n\nAditi the one that ought not to be cut into pieces.\n\n  These three names of cow signify that the animal ought not to be put to tortures. These words appear frequently throughout the Vedas in context of the cow.\n\nMaa gaamanaagaamaditim vadhishta Rigveda 8.101.15 \n\nDo not kill the cow. Cow is innocent and aditi тАУ that ought not to be cut into pieces\n\nMaa gaamanaagaamaditim vadhishta Rigveda 8.101.15 \n\nDo not kill the cow. Cow is innocent and aditi тАУ that ought not to be cut into pieces\n\nAntakaaya goghaatam Yajurveda 30.18 Destroy those who kill cows\n\nThe entire 28th Sukta or Hymn of 6th Mandal of Rigveda sings the glory of cow.\n\n Aa gaavo agnamannuta bhadramakrantseedantu \n\n Bhooyobhooyo rayimidasya vardhayannabhinne\n\n  Na taa nashanti na dabhaati taskaro naasaamamitro\n\n vyathiraa dadharshati  Na taa arvaa renukakaato ashnute \n\nna samskritramupa yanti taa abhi  Gaavo bhago gaava indro me achhaan \n\n Yooyam gaavo medayathaa  Maa vah stena eeshata maaghanshasah \n\n 1. Everyone should ensure that cows are free from miseries and kept healthy.\n\n 2. God blesses those who take care of cows. \n\n3. Even the enemies should not use any weapon on cows \n\n4. No one should slaughter the cow \n\n5. Cow brings prosperity and strength\n\n  6. If cows keep healthy and happy, men and women shall also keep disease free and prosperous  \n\n7. May the cow eat green grass and pure water. May they not be killed and bring prosperity to us.\n\nThe key here lies in wrong interpretation of traditional sanskrit,most hindus themselves don\'t speak sanskrit and this gives the westerners a chance to corrupt our texts and mislead us\n\nBut yes,I\'m confident enough that Sanatana dharma doesn\'t allow beef eating or even cow sacrifice,all kinds of killings except for Dharma are looked down upon and criticized .\n\nNote-for anyone who begins with the news that bovine meat traces were discovered in the IVC (Indus Valley Civilization), strong genetic evidence (genetic research evidence from the Rakhigarhi site,2015) supports the idea that the  Indus Valley people were not Hindus,and certainly not vedic and hence could eat meat.\n\nThe fact being Hinduism never was,and have never-ever been a meat eating Dharma and we never supported anything like it.'<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'kiyfvu'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li>

He also said that half of the farmers don't know what is MSP, other half who know what is MSP and if they say that they aren't receiving MSP so party worker will suppress them.\nWhen asked them about do you get profit from selling at mandi he literally said no loss hota hai they dont get any profit.\nWhen asked what do you think about the farm laws he said that atleast they will have a new alternative to sell other than mandi or the middlemen. The farmer also said that the sarpanch of the village will call meeting of FPC and decide the price on their own without consulting the other farmers.\nHe also said that when he tried to sell at mandi the middleman took the produce from him and sold it to the other party in front of him and literally deducted 300-400 from the total amount in front of him, just to handover the produce from him to the buyer nothing else no storing nothing else.\nThis is the ground reality of farmer's life this is in the state of Gujarat remember Modi's home state now remember what could have been the state of mandi in farmers in Punjab Haryana etc."<br />Author: 'amogha128'<br />id: 'kitg9z'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li>

He then was slated to contest the elections for the Youth Congress district secretary post but purportedly did not withdraw his nomination papers. The elections subsequently took place from 10 to 12 December. He was elected as the District Secretary of MP Youth Congress wing in Jabalpur.  \n\n\nFollowing his victory, Singhai spoke to media persons, "The most laughable is the fact that no one was interested in the polls and I was elected general secretary. I left the Congress on 10 March with Scindia-ji. I filled in my nomination for the Youth Congress polls three years ago".  \n\n\nThe MP Youth Congress election coordinator Maqsood Mirza on the other hand has called it a cheap publicity stunt and has claimed that a total of 1,800 workers had filed their nominations for the election, which was held online. He added that nobody paid much attention as Singhai apparently was not a popular leader. \n\nSource-[https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-big-slip-in-madhya-pradesh-congress-elects-bjp-leader-to-party-post/story-gWBGS3p995XRW87AGH5VpJ.html](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-big-slip-in-madhya-pradesh-congress-elects-bjp-leader-to-party-post/story-gWBGS3p995XRW87AGH5VpJ.html)'<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'kiph5q'<br />Flair ::swamivivek: High IQ</li>
