This all happens in very so called intelligent countries. He is rich so his brainless talks also seem intelligent. This is also a symbol of intellectual slavery.  \nIndian culture has always tried to be in love with nature, that is why we have accepted the names of animals, birds, animals, river, constellations, stars etc. Popatbhai, Meenaben, Ganga, Kaveri, Ashwin etc are wearing surnames like elephant, mosquito, horse. This is how we have tried to coordinate with nature. Our rituals, customs, fasting, in all these we have kept nature together. Like Vadasavitri's fast, moon darshan in Kadva Chauth, Sun Narayan's worship, Tulsi worship, river bath in Rishi Pancham, girls fasting like Fulkanjali or in vratas like Molakat and Jyaparvati somewhere there is nature, nature with nature or respect for nature. Farmers worship snakes, it is called Khetarpal. Because snakes protect from rat-like crops, therefore respect them as part of gratitude. Pipal gives the most oxygen that is why Ashwathama Survivrikshana is said in Bhagwad Gita. I'm the peep in the trees. In this way, Tulsi is also a very useful plant in Ayurveda. Which everyone saw in the Corona period.  \nIndian culture has always worshipped every thing of nature which has been used in human life with gratitude. The school which gives me education, I bow down first to its steps, that is why children bow down while climbing the steps of the school. Even if he doesn't know the philosophy behind it, he needs faith. There are so many things we have there. But we have forgotten the philosophy behind it and the ancient people say that you believe in Tree God, Snake God, River God, so our PhD who went to America is also doing yes in his talk. He doesn't have the intellectual courage to explain the philosophy of Tree God or River God to the first paragraph above. In birthday, those people cut cake and put it on their face, beat the one whose birthday is it, in Spain, celebrate the festival by throwing tomatoes on each other, in which trucks filled with tomatoes and wasting the road. In the same way, by throwing mud-mud on each other and celebrating the festival, if we celebrate with kesuda or gulal, it is also appropriate in the view of Ayurveda. Let us light a fire in good work that my life is bright like fire. When I was small on birthday, I used to lamp with God or Tulsi. All this seems brainless but lighting a glamorous candle on the cake - what's the use of this birthday that my life has become so dark! Following such a aho surprise like customs we are back in the game of proving ourselves intelligent.\n\nWe have a lot of superstition there too. No we don't like promoting it. But every talk of us is not like brainless or superstition and every talk of people of the world means that it has been rubbed on the air of intelligence, even there astrologer, ghost, witch all these things are the same. A novel featuring magical stories like Harry Porter runs, a lot of films like Dracula runs there. If this is not superstition then what else is it? There are many fantasy men like Phantom, Hulk, Aquaman, right there. If we talk about Hanuman or Bhim then talk about Orthodox and this Hulk or Aquaman then modern is not bankrupt of this intelligence then what else?  \nIt is not that we become modern, before taking up and leaving any thinking, we must think that which ideology is the intelligent thing? After that if the east is right then we pick it up and if the west is inappropriate then it is inappropriate and also show the courage to leave.\n\nAstu.  \nDt.18.06.2021."<br />Author: 'falana-dhikana'<br />id: 'o2oydu'<br />Flair ::cshivajim: VirArt</li><li>Title: 'lol'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'o2otvd'<br />Flair :Removed-11-Repost:stop:</li><li>Title: 'What is happening.'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'o2omxr'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Irish Pub-g'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'o2mzw1'<br />Flair :Indo-International üì∞</li><li>Title: 'üÖ±Ô∏èulla nibbi summarized in one pic.'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'o2mrb3'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: '153‡§µ‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§™‡•Å‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø‡§•‡§ø, ‡§∂‡§§ ‡§∂‡§§ ‡§®‡§Æ‡§® | True flag-bearer of Feminism and Patriotism.'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'o2mmf7'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li><li>Title: 'Minor girl gangraped by 4 men for refusing to convert to Islam to marry one of them.'<br />Body: ' In an appalling incident of crime, a 15-year-old girl from Barwani district in Madhya Pradesh was allegedly gang-raped by four men, reportedly after she refused to convert to Islam to solemnize marriage with one of them.\n\nAccording to the police, the heinous crime took place in neighbouring Maharashtra‚Äôs Malegaon, where the teenage girl worked as a labourer. In Malegaon, the minor girl came in contact with a 23-year-old youth who befriended her using fake identity. The youth, whose real name is Majid Khan, allegedly introduced himself to the girl as Mohit. Khan allegedly sexually assaulted her after promising to marry her. In October last year, Khan\xa0allegedly made an attempt\xa0to change the girl‚Äôs religion to Islam. When the girl opposed the conversion bid, Khan and his three friends allegedly gang-raped her.\n\nWhat is even more shocking is that the girl‚Äôs family members did not report the crime to the police. The girl shifted to her sister‚Äôs house in MP‚Äôs Ujjain. In April, she developed abdominal pain, following which she was dashed to a hospital, where her medical examination revealed that she was pregnant. ‚ÄúShe had a premature delivery in the hospital, but the baby died. It was then that the girl shared her ordeal with another woman in the hospital, who then informed a Hindu organisation and the police about it,‚Äù a report by *Hindustan Times* quoted Ujjain ASP Amrendra Singh as saying.

This disrupts the unity, causes people to argue without even knowing what context the terms they are using should be used in thus leading to no clear conclusion.  \n\n\nI have studied "Sanskrit" for 5 years of my life in school and I have taken exams issued by the Sringeri Sharada Peetha\'s Surasaraswati Sabha. This still doesn\'t give me authority to make definitive claims about any scripture or samskritam as I still have much left to study. But I still feel that I can contribute to educating anyone who wishes to learn, the utter basics of samskritam and some important terminologies that usually get misused in modern discussions about Dharma.   \n\n\nI would like to help you all understand the thought process of our ancestors, how discussions regarding the purusharthas took place and much more. All this to create a large group of youngsters well educated in samskritam with a common way thinking. This is absolutely essential in these times and we have to get to a stage where discussions about dharma will be taking place in samskritam on online platforms like how they are now in English. This will also build modesty in us and create an inner seeking in us to know more and more. The more one knows, the more they tend to seek. One who knows less is satisfied with the low level of knowledge and lets their big ego make up for the lack of knowledge.  \n\n\nI am totally aware that there are people here with more authority over the language and culture than me, I would like them to also guide us and learn more with us if possible.  \n\n\nI plan on making regular posts regarding important topics and basics of samskrtiam. I would love interested people to comment whatever they expect from this and how we should go about this.  \n\n\nOne last point I would like to make is that, learning should always be separated from biases and politics to prevent the student from not being able to reach the absolute truth and therefore politics will and must be avoided while learning as much as possible.'<br />Author: 'SantaphiliaHUB'<br />id: 'o1onun'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Dekh liya eek din phele YouTube se padhne ka natija'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'o1ogzb'<br />Flair :Removed-07-LowQua:stop:</li><li>Title: 'Maybe the aliens are our only hope to stop universal jihad !!'<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tdr8acge1r571.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ae66abd18f6fa7d7ce1d2da7171b01db044b172'<br />Author: 'PossibleTasty7113'<br />id: 'o1nvs6'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihaad_Halal Certified</li><li>Title: 'Average Liberal starter pack'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'o1nj46'<br />Flair :Removed-11-Repost:stop:</li><li>Title: 'Woke Libgandu in action.'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'o1nas4'<br />Flair :Removed-07-LowQua:stop:</li><li>Title: 'Liberandus and their daddy China..'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'o1m856'<br />Flair ::HighIQ: Randia Simulation</li><li>Title: 'I believe in ssr Supremacy'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'o1ehru'<br />Flair :Wholesome Bakchodi :danklaugh:</li><li>Title: "What according to you, is the best empire of Bharat's (‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§) history?

I don't know about you, but over the last two to three years my experience on social media has gone down significantly. It's because of this reason that I chose to make products that would decentralize and democratize the internet again.\n\n# What Is OpenReply?\n\n**OpenReply** is a browser extension that acts like a layer over the internet. This means that you can vote, comment, and reply on any website on the internet out there ‚Äî and no, the website has **ZERO** control over your comments. **And yes, this is a swadeshi product. ü™î**\n\nWith OpenReply, you can comment and vote on YouTube videos, Facebook posts, tweets, and online news articles.\n\n# Downloads\n\nWe have released **v0.3.1 (pre-release)** on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/openreply/noljkklhldpabidacigodpiiimjgodfk). You can click on this link and download it from there. However, we will slowly be shifting towards a different software release model that isn't reliant on Google's servers.\n\n# Development\n\nWe fully realize the threat of going against Big Tech corporations (who have their own agendas) who control a large majority of the internet. To mitigate this risk, we will be embracing decentralization as we progress further through decentralized Database and Authentication systems (OrbitDB, gun.js, IPFS, or something that we develop). In the future, we would also like to implement anonymity protocols (Dandelion++, Tor, etc.) to achieve complete democratization.\n\n# Stay In Touch\n\nAlthough we don't encourage these platforms, you can follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/openreply.app/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/openreply_app), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/OpenReplyApp), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPFseLEHL5NtHnDlEg_y-fA).

As per suggestions, we're working on porting the extension to other browsers and setting up a website. Additionally, we've now made the code [open source](https://github.com/open-reply/open-reply-extension) as well (I apologize for any spaghetti code beforehand üòÖ). Again, thank you so much for the response. We'll strive to make this better every day and restore free speech to the internet again.

Her parents are somewhat strict in a normal middle class way, nothing too extreme. Last year after neet counseling, she could get a seat at a Muslim managed medical college at a somewhat faraway place from our hometown. Her parents didn't want to send her there, but couldn't afford anyplace better. They asked me for advice because I am the only doctor in my mother's side of family and I studied in good govt institutes throughout my studies. I was a bit wary about sending her there, but since she really wanted to get into MBBS and didn't want to waste another year in prep, I told them that the college doesn't really matter much as long as you get into pg at a decent place. \n\nFast forward 8 months and the girl is now saying things like astafigurulla in her normal conversations with her friends and relatives.

It\'ll be a long read.\n\nPlease go through the links to get more info on them. \n\n1) Lord Krishna had said to mata ganga that after 5000 years of his death there will be a golden age. \n\nIam not sure if this is starting of Satya yuga or just a temporary peroid. \nThere are currently two school of thoughts currently regarding the start of satya yuga :\n\n1) As per isckon and their lineage its 432000 years after kali yuga\n\n2) As per swami yukteshwar giri(lineage of mahavatar baba) , sadguru and many others, the yuga cycle is not that big. \n\nPlease go through the links to read more about yuga cycle and come to your own conclusions: \nhttps://www.bibhudevmisra.com/2012/07/end-of-kali-yuga-in-2025-unraveling.html\nhttps://isha.sadhguru.org/in/en/wisdom/article/kali-yuga-end-lies-ahead \n\nIf you read kalki puran you will be surprised because it makes so much sense now. Here are some main points in kalkipurana:\n\na) Kalki\'s war with China (or maybe, North Korea)\n\n\nThe great conqueror, Kalki then paid homage to his father and started for conquering Kikatpur with his army. \nThe Buddhists live in that city. The residents of that city do not worship God or their forefathers. \nThey do not fear after-life. Other than the body, they do not believe in any soul. \nThey do not have any pride in their lineage or in their race; money, marriage etc. are insignificant to them. \nPeople of that place eat and drink a variety of things. \nWhen Jin (the leader) heard that Kalki has come to fight them, he gathered a huge army and went out of the city to fight Him.\n\nAlthough the city of Kikatpur is unidentified, yet it is specified that "Buddhists" live there. \nBut the descriptions of the belief of those people are anything but Buddhist and are more in consonance with the ideology of the Communists, i.e. people who do not worship God, do not believe in after-life, soul, race and the significance of wealth and give the collective more importance than the individual. \nThe choice of foods of the Chinese (or Koreans) are also considered exotic in other parts of the world.\nInterestingly, the name of the leader is also mentioned as "Jin". As we all know, Jin, Xin or Xian are very common names among the Chinese.\nBy religion, China (or Korea) is predominantly Buddhist, although no religion is allowed to be openly practiced under the Communist rule. \nThus the description of the belief of the people and their religion are not contradictory but very appropriate.\n\nHe (Jin) took up various types of arms and started war with Kalki. \nEven the Gods were surprised by the techniques of war adopted by Jin. \nJin injured Kalki\'s horse with a javelin and made him disoriented and unconscious and attempted to take him away, but could not lift him\n.On seeing that, King Vishakhjupa got angry and encountered Jin and picked up unconscious Kalki in his own chariot. \nKalki regained his consciousness in a while and encouraged his soldiers; following that, he rushed towards Jin after getting down from the chariot of Vishakhjupa.\nIt seems that Jin was not a mean enemy and Kalki did not have a smooth ride either and had his moments of ups and downs. \nOf course this is what is expected if a western force confronts the mighty Chinese army, the biggest in the world in terms of numbers.\nSoon, Garga (associate of Kalki) and his army killed 6000 Buddhist soldiers.\nBharga and his soldiers killed and injured 11 million enemy soldiers and his mighty allies killed 2500 of them. \nKobi along with his sons killed 2 million enemy soldiers, Pragya killed 1 million and Sumantu killed 5 million soldiers.\n\nIt seems that Kalki and his allies kill or injure an army which is almost 20 million strong. \nAn army of this huge proportions can only be assembled by a country like China and its allies. \nThus, the attack on the city of Kikatpur does not merely represent an attack on a city but on a country, probably in alliance with others.\n\n\nMore about it can be read in kalki purana. It is available in net. \n\n\n\n\n1) Veerabramhendra swamy kalagnana\n\nVeerabramhendra swamy was a saint in 1600\'s and he operated in Andhra pradesh area. His kalagnana is really famous in AP.\nHe was born through the boon of lord Siva. \nSome of the main points of his kalagnana are : \n\n\ta) He will take birth as veera vasnatha raya/kalki after 5000 years of kaliyuga.\n\n\tb) He will establish righteousness in the world by killing all the bad people.\n\n\tc) At the time of his coming there will be lot chaos in the world. Lots of epidemics , huge earthquakes which we have never seen , tsunamis etc.\n\n\td) He had succesfully predicted about british rule and gandhi.\n\n\te) He had predicted about corona virus also : \n\t\tThis is the line which he told\n\t\t‡∞à‡∞∂‡∞æ‡∞®‡±ç‡∞Ø ‡∞¶‡∞ø‡∞ï‡±ç‡∞ï‡±Å‡∞® ‡∞µ‡∞ø‡∞∑‡∞ó‡∞æ‡∞≤‡∞ø ‡∞™‡±Å‡∞ü‡±ç‡∞ü‡±á‡∞®‡±Å.\n\t\t‡∞≤‡∞ï‡±ç‡∞∑‡∞≤‡∞æ‡∞¶‡∞ø ‡∞™‡±ç‡∞∞‡∞ú‡∞≤‡±Å ‡∞∏‡∞ö‡±ç‡∞ö‡±á‡∞∞‡∞Ø.\n\t\t‡∞ï‡±ã‡∞∞‡∞Ç‡∞ï‡∞ø‡∞Ø‡∞®‡±Å ‡∞ú‡∞¨‡±ç‡∞¨‡±Å ‡∞ï‡±ã‡∞ü‡∞ø ‡∞Æ‡∞Ç‡∞¶‡∞ø‡∞ï‡∞ø ‡∞§‡∞ó‡∞ø‡∞≤‡∞ø\n\t\t‡∞ï‡±ã‡∞°‡∞ø ‡∞≤‡∞æ‡∞ó‡∞æ ‡∞§‡±Ç‡∞ó‡∞ø ‡∞∏‡∞ö‡±ç‡∞ö‡±á‡∞∞‡∞Ø || ‡∞∂‡∞ø‡∞µ || .... 114\n\t\ttranslation : \n\t\tFrom east there will come poisonous wind,\n\t\tLakhs of people will die\n\t\tA disease/virus named koranki will infect crores of people\n\t\tThey all will die swinging their heads like chicken. (presumably coughing?? im not sure)\n\nHe has mentioned exact year in his prophecies and all the years are in telugu 60 year cycle(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_years)\n\nHis next prophecy which iam waiting for is a new star which comes up in the sky in 2024-2025(he has mentioned the year as Krodhi)\n\nIts very difficult to get english translation in internet. I have collected only some of them\nPlease find the books which has more of his prophecies: \n\n1) govinda vyakyas - kalagnana in the form of poems(translations of some poems)\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1onhFjH8K8vwloyhB28NjBGbmWtolnint/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf anyone wants his life story also with kalagnana in english- \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1DQKfY6U0j1iKEiYtGQNk5iXSYZpURiJD/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n2) Achyutanada das mallika\n\nThis was written by Achyutanada das in odia language. \nThere really isnt a english translation of this book and its very difficult to find info in english. \nThis link has some of his prophecies : \nhttps://currenthealthscenario.blogspot.com/2015/05/an-indian-saint-on-coming-destruction.html\nThis channel has lot of content relating to his prophecies in hindi : \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI5_A-xvPs639jV9iEu6-4A\n\n\n3) Kaivara tatayya kalagnana\n\nHe was famous saint in karntaka/andhra border. His kalagnana is also very rare to comeby in english. \nSome brief points in his kalagnana are which i remember hearing when i was a kid : \n1) There will come a new star to the north of half moon. At first it will seem like a star.\nBut it will grow in size after some days and will fall onto earth in a great crash. This would cause heavy distruction. \n\n\nThere are many other who have prophesied about kali yuga and kalki avatar like sant surdas , guru govid singh etc. \nIam yet to research more about them.'<br />Author: 'satbieng'<br />id: 'o0h8ku'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li><li>Title: 'Kind of hatred spread that is being spread by Congress and its eco-system, aided and goaded by muslim politicians, left liberals and newsportals we are headed to a civil war.

Padmanabhaswamy temple kept $3 trillion worth of treasures safe from Islamists, British and Communists by executing the greatest heist in history of mankind.'<br />Body: '##A communist attempt by Pinaryi Vijayan government to loot Padmanabhaswamy temple to fill their party coffers -\n\nIn 2009, a rat by the name of T P Sunderrajan filed a PIL in the district court of Tiruvananthapuram, challenging the authority of the Travancore royal family heir over the Padmanabhaswamy temple and its property. \n\n\nSunderrajan was a man propped by the CPI-M to ascertain as to how much wealth the temple owned. Back then, very few people knew the extent of opulence of the temple. But some rumour must have escaped because it got the hinduphobic CPI-M very interested in temple finances of Padmanabhaswamy.\n\n\nIn January 2011, the Kerala High Court passed an order that the temple and its management be given to the state government run by communists. \n\n\nCome May 2011, Marthanda Varma, the royal heir, challenged the verdict in the supreme court which stayed the order. But the court also ordered the inventory of all the temple assets, especially the one in the underground vaults. \n\n\n##Thus came out the extent of wealth the temple held in its vaults -\n\nThousands upon thousands of gold coins, jewels and precious stones the size of people\'s thumbs. A life size moorti of Vishnu cast out of pure gold and embedded with diamonds and rubies and emeralds.\n\n\nThere are french colonial era gold coins with Napoleon Bonaparte\'s face on them. There also hundreds of pots of gold coins from the Roman and Greek empires dating back from before the birth of Christ.\n\n\nThe conservative estimate of this treasure is around $2-3 trillion, without even taking into account the unopened vaults and approximately 3 TONNES of gold dust lying around the vaults.\n\n\nHow did Sunderrajan know such a treasure is buried under the temple?\n\n\n***He\'s a former Assistant Director of Intelligence Bureau and a close confidant of Indira Gandhi and a lifelong Congress loyalist.***\n\n\nIt was in 2020 that finally the Supreme Court passed the order that the temple management belonged to the Travancore royal family and not the state government putting an end to Vijayan\'s dream of looting Bhagwan Vishnu\'s assets.\n\n\n##How Hindu kings sent their wealth to Bhagwan Padmanabhaswamy for safekeeping -\n\nThere are many speculations as to why the temple is so rich. One of the expert opinions is that all the Hindu wealth from across Bharat was relocated to Tiruvanathapuram for safekeeping. This included northern kingdoms too, since the southern kingdoms as south as Kerala did not interact with Greeks.\n\n\nIt is the accumulated wealth of the Chelas, Pandyas, the Ay Kingdom and finally the Travancore Kingdom. But we can assume that wealth from erstwhile Northern kingdoms also found way here in the form of dana by visiting Hindu kings on a pilgrimage to pay obecience to Padmanabhaswamy.\n\n\n##The clandestine way the royal families kept the treasure a secret by way of renovations -\n\nHow does one construct a complete maze of vaults underground without people ever knowing?\n\n\nThe answer lies in deliberate sabotage and renovations. \n\n\nThe earliest record of renovations is recorded in 1050 AD when a Venad king ordered renovation by removing the moorti of Padmanabhaswamy.\n\n\nAnother extensive renovation was performed in 1461 AD and the moorti was reinstalled.\n\n\nThese "renovations" are nothing but careful and planned construction of the underground vaults and their expansion. \n\n\nIn 1689, the temple was almost destroyed in a fire. Only the moorti of Vishnu survived.\n\n\nIn 1729, Thirunal Marthanda Varma, finally began rebuilding in earnest. The construction ended in 1733.\n\n\nI am speculating that it is here that all the vaults are constructed and deemed completed. Because right after this Thirunal Marthanda Varma announced himself as the servant of Vishnu or Padmanabha dasa, dedicating all his wealth to Vishnu.\n\n\nIn hindsight Marthanda is a visionary because the Dutch invasions and Islamic trouble started in 1735, a mere two years after the temple was completed.\n\n\nBut the fundamental question is that how did the temple keep the knowledge of such a treasure secret from the British and Islamist conquerors, especially the Mysore Sultanate?\n\n\n\n##The genius strategy to fool the British in 1848-\n\nTraditionally Travancore kings participated in the ceremony of mahadanams (great charity). \n\n\nIn this ceremony the king\'s would give gold and wealth to the brahmins on their kingdom. Each brahmin would get at least 80 grams of gold as charity. They did this every year, and gave away gold to thousands of brahmins. \n\n\nBut in the account books they shared with the British, they showed depleting finances.\n\n\nThis grave financial condition concerned the Governor general of India and he warned the king Uttaran Tirunal in 1848 that if he continued doing this charity, his kingdom would be acceded to Madras presidency.\n\n\nThe king happily stopped the mahadanam ceremony to the happiness of the British who were finally satisfied that the kingdom would not bankrupt itself.\n\n\n***Thus by smart accounting and charity, the king easily made idiots of the British and kept them in the dark about the treasure.***\n\n\n\n\n##Trouncing Tipu Sultan in battlefield and keeping the East India Company away with diplomacy in 1789 -\n\nThe first real threat by way of force after Travancore was formed came in the form of Tipu Sultan.\n\n\nKarthika Thirunal Rama Varma was the son of Marthanda Varma, the king who established the Travancore royal family and declared the family as Padmanabhaswamy dasas(servants of Vishnu).\n\n\nHe made sure to keep the British calm by diplomacy, recognising that he could not have a war on two fronts with such a treasure under his safekeep.\n\n\nWhen Tipu Sultan attacked with his son, Karthika Varma defeated him, and routed his Islamic ego.\n\n\nThe defeat was a significant one because there were thousands of Hindu refugees who had migrated to Tiruvanathapuram to escape the Islamic atrocities by Tipu Sultan.\n\n\nTipu had demanded that the refugees be returned to him, but Varma refused and went to war for the Hindu refugees and won this ending any possibility of Islamic attack and upholding Hindu dharma.\n\n\nThus by keeping people in the dark, the Travancore royal family and their descendants have kept the treasure away from malicious agents and agencies.\n\n\nBut this will not end here. The Communists and the Imperialist Congress forces want the temple treasure to be taken out and kept in a museum. Many voices also want to use the treasure to erase the debt by allowing government control over it. We know how much of it will be left when the Commies will go through it, looting god knows how much.\n\n\nThe royal family is right - the treasure belongs to Bhawan Padmanabhaswamy and Him only. They are just the caretakers. And what marvelous caretakers to protect Bhagwan\'s treasure for over 3 millennia! No such feat of secrecy has been accomplished ever in the history of mankind. To know what would have happened to the treasure just look at the Mayan, Aztec and Egypt treasures.\n\n\nBut the wolves are circling even now. This temple is a classic case why we need to make provisions to free temples from ever coming under government control.\n\n\nWe need to make sure that it remains Bhagwan\'s forever.\n\n\n***Aum Padmanabhaya Namah!***\n\n\n\nPS. -\n\nA little about the Travancore royal family tradition of Muramakkathayam or the matrilineal succession -\n\n\nIn the Travancore royal family, the women have more power than the men. The king was not the son of the previous king. To be the king he had to be born to the sister of the king. Thus the nephew would inherit the title of king. \n\nIf the king would beget only sons, a girl child would be adopted and then a son, who is not of king\'s blood would become the successor.\n\nShow this to the people who attack Hinduism for being patriarchal. The richest religious institution in the WHOLE WORLD was managed by the authority of women. And this is not the sole example either. There are many such. I will compile them in another post.
