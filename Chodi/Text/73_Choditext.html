The farther away it is from the fact the more it reaches a conspiracy or in some places tyrannical thought on a subject.\n\nSo, saying the phrase ‚ÄúIt is your opinion, man‚Äù, may be right in some places, the key word some needs to be pressurized, mainly because this phrase is, as far as I have seen, used for the thought related to conspiracy and less well-thought out opinion, which takes facts into consideration.  \n\nSo, the end message in this article is that, just think out when this phrase is used, because you may just use this on someone who‚Äôs opinion differs wildly at times even hurting the facts‚Äô integrity itself.'<br />Author: 'Generocide'<br />id: 'hcp82o'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'What happened at China border'<br />Body: 'There is only 2 possibilities - China either took our land, or they didn\'t.\n\nWhichever happened, Modi has 2 choices - Tell the truth, or lie.\n\nWhatever Modi says, you have 2 choices - believe him, or disbelieve.\n\nWhatever you decide, there are 2 outcomes - you either vote for him, or not.\n\nDo permutation, combination, flowchart of these options to keep yourself busy.\n\nYou and I have zero visibility into what\'s going on there. There is no border fence. Chinese and Indian troops cross into each other\'s territory all the time, even right now incursions are going on throughout the 3000km long porous border. Then they both go back to patrolling other areas.\n\nMaybe they did enter our land, Maybe they were beat back after.\nMaybe Modi has read ArthaShastra which ordains how to deal with a weak enemy (Pakistan) and how to deal with a strong enemy (China), how to project strength during weakness, and weakness during strength.\n\nWould you be happy if he said *\'they did enter/grab land\'* ?  \nWhat will the next set of questions be ?  \nHe has to then manage public opinion which might end up curtailing or forcing the Army into doing something they didn\'t plan for.  \nModi is not obliged to reveal full information to everyone everytime.  \nYou think PoohPing does it ?  \n*"But China is dictatorship and we\'re not REEE"* - Go back to point 4 above - either vote for him, or don\'t.\n\nWe armchairs can do only one thing useful right now. **Keep quiet**.  \nSo those that are actually thinking are not distracted.

Or on yahoo (or askjeeves, or galaxy.einet.net, or dogpile, or altavista or even astalavista) being the one true search engine.\n\nthese things are temporary and tend to wither away and get replaced by something new.  no matter how you feel about this, the way WANG computers disappeared, the same way IBM computers are also going to disappear.  The way that Digital Research DOS or Control Program/Microprocessors, disappeared, the same way Microsoft is also going to disappear.  Apple, Google.  They are all going to vanish without a trace.  Islam, Christianity, Buddhism... they are all going to end.\n\nWhat makes something perennial?  Something that is fed from the never ending source. Glaciers, Ice, TRUTH.  Anything that is the words of men, delivered to them by angels, sent by god.... is going to get corrupted, is temporary.

No one wants to be in the position of dealing with a new incursion of Chinese troops across the border. These same voices will likely push for a more active posture in all four sectors of the border. This gets things exactly wrong. If it wants to avoid falling into the strategic trap that has been laid for it, India needs to de-escalate tensions at the border while increasing activity where the real game is being played: in the Indian Ocean, in the race to develop the key technologies of the future, and in the battle to control critical infrastructure.\n\n\nThe first and most important lesson in the ‚Äúnew great game‚Äù is not to be distracted from the main prize. The second lesson is to preserve your margin of action.\n\n\nThose who consulted the Chinese press over the last week must have noticed an interesting fact: The recent battle between Indian and Chinese troops in Ladakh was nowhere to be seen. The possibility of war was not created and managed for domestic consumption. It was created for the Indian mind, a strategy of war psychology.\n\n\nBy Bruno Macaes, The writer, a former Secretary of State for European Affairs in Portugal, is the author of Belt and Road: A Chinese World Order'<br />Author: 'rangilarasool'<br />id: 'hch08v'<br />Flair :HQ Text Bakchodi</li><li>Title: 'Comics Chahiye'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'RaktimSoul'<br />id: 'hcgeeg'<br />Flair :Low Effort</li><li>Title: 'Many rappers support or say anti-religious lines'<br />Body: "I don't understand that why many Hindu rappers support or say anti-religious things in their songs like:\n\nFotty Seven (Ankit): Baal kyun kata rha h, pooja ka din hai ?\nAbe kaise jiyun tujhse poocha kisi ne?\n\nMuhfaad (Gaurav Pal): Naastik mai Vaastavik me Muhfaad\n\nSeedhe Maut (Abhijay Negi &amp; Siddhant Sharma): Gharwalon ko pata tha chhati se ladka ye mandir me matha ni tekega...\n\nKarma (Vivek Arora): Poora khaviz mai chicken ke piece me, Mangalvaar ya Shanivaar\n\nWhile most rappers from other religions are close to their religions like DIVINE (Vivian Fernandez), Emiway Bantai (Shahrukh Shaikh), Naezy (Naved Shaikh), MC Stan (Altaf Shaikh)..."<br />Author: 'AreBhaiBhaiBhai'<br />id: 'hcgah7'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'Not OC'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hcct5a'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'You can make a love story out of this.....'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'themarxistworker'<br />id: 'hcbsa9'<br />Flair :Shitpost</li><li>Title: 'Sad truthüòî'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hc9q71'<br />Flair :Rant</li><li>Title: 'r/chodi should stop acting like saints when they do exactly what r/india does.

Christians bury the dead ones and the soul rests in peace in that grave until the judgment day arrives. On the Judgment day, the Lord will decide who goes where- Heaven or Hell. They believe that on the Judgment day the dead will rise again. Until that time, the soul has to remain inside that coffin. Hence the blessing Rest In Peace (until the judgement day)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, Hinduism does not have any concept such as that of rising of dead ones. Hinduism believes in reincarnation. It says that the cycle of birth and death are governed by the Karma of individuals. The deceased individual would take another birth based upon the Karma of this life. So there is no rest and hence, the concept of RIP is not valid in Hinduism. Hinduism believes in Moksha that is liberation- Liberation from the endless cycles of birth and death. That‚Äôs why instead of using RIP we should say, ‚ÄúOm Shanti‚Äù or ‚ÄúAatma Ko Sadgati Prapt Ho (May Soul attain Moksha)‚Äù or simply "Om Sadgati". Sadgati means salvation or liberation. We always pray that may the soul get liberated from the cycle of life and death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn fact, the concept of RIP would remotely come close to the concept of Preta (Evil, hungry ghosts) which is basically a curse in the Hindu way of life. An individual after leaving his/her body becomes Preta. When we say RIP , we are praying for the soul to remain locked into a standstill on Earth as it becomes Preta for eternity. That‚Äôs why in Hindu way of life there is a concept of Terahvin (13 days). For 13 days family members of deceased persuade the Pretas every day with various invocations and offerings requesting them to leave this earth and move on to their next destination which could be either incarnation or salvation (moksha).

Let's get real, our large percentage of population is still facing poverty, we're really lagging behind in every aspect, our education system is fucked, corruption is still common, people still throw garbage on streets, yes we're growing but our growth is no where near to be dominant power in Asia.\nThat's the current state our country. Just accept it \n\nChina on the other hand, has most risen from poverty and corruption despite the population still large than of India, CCP has mostly solved basic problems and is  now going in direction of being a superpower.\n China was always the wealthiest country throughout ancient, medival, and early modern period, it wasn't India it was China. You're not immune to any type of propaganda.\nMoving on current situation, it's the China who is actually winning, it has even started building it's new silk road, it will stretch from Asia to Europe and Africa and its centre will be China. They're really on their way to gain their old throne and unlike America china already has gained powerful ways to silent any voice against it. \nTheir government and companies invest in every single country and especially in Africa, they control the media!! Look at how YouTube, reddit, tiktok shadow people and if it continues like that every voice against it will immediately will be shut. \nThis is how far they've coming into in just 20 years. \nThey're even building ports in Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Look how our old friend Nepal is now no more different than Pakistan. At this point do we have any allies left? \nChina will control Indian Ocean, central Asia, sub saharan Africa and south China sea if it keeps continuing, they will get every influential region it the world. We only had Indian Ocean to be dominant in as our paths to central and east Asia were blocked by China. It shame how some Indians seem so confident with indo China issue.

I took that flat for office only and now I am paying the rent for it and not staying there.\n\nMy parents are against for me moving there because I can catch Coronavirus there. Also they don't want me to eat outside as I was doing before cause no cooking skills. \n\nNow the problem is I don't know how many more months this pandemic is going to last and how long my office is going to be work from home.\n\nSo what should I do?\n\n1. Move my stuff back to my parents house and work from here. Though if this pandemic ends early or my office opens, I have to find another flat or travel :(\n2. Move back there and cook for myself. My parents will definitely be worried about me catching the virus. Also no cooking skills, will have to learn from scratch.\n3. Keep paying the rent and stay in my parents house till this pandemic ends. Most of my family is suggesting this and frankly I don't want to waste money for the flat I am not using.\n\nPS: I kind of want to move back there as I miss my solitude but I worry for my parent's worries about me."<br />Author: 'Frosty_War'<br />id: 'h8xyss'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: '57 overseas Tablighis convicted, sentences set off and freed.'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'h8xrtb'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'Chodus with somewhat fragile mental health, how are you doing?'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'KaunJamaatHo'<br />id: 'h8wtwy'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'Sanghi Bieber'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'h8w9f2'<br />Flair :Shitpost</li><li>Title: '(Wholesome without the bakchodi) I just found this sub and have to say.....I am happy beyond words.
