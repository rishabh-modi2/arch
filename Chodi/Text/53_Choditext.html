We're unknowingly turning into soft leftists and bootlickers to the West."<br />Body: 'Before the Mughals destroyed the Indian universities , Before the British imperialism, people from all over the world often visited India to study in universities like Nalanda, Ujjain, Takshashila University...etc. \n\nMany students from the middle-east used to translated works of the Indian mathematicians (from sanskrit) to Arabic, they often gave credit to Indian mathematicians in their books. \n\nInfact Chinese kings used to hire Indian mathematicians to translate sanskrit works into Chinese. In order to honour those teachers, Chinese built many statues of them. \n\nMany students from the Europe translated these works into their languages as their own works, without citing the original work. \n\nTo verify, just google these mathematicians works: Bhaskaracharya 2 ( invented calculus before Newton), Bhaskaracharya 1, Aryabhatta ... etc.\n\nThe thing is, these works often are in chandhas (poetic verses) in sanskrit. Obviously, these works don\'t use Greek alphabet. Learning sanskrit can be a real pain in the ass for many foreigners. This gave the historians all the more reason to strike these works off as religious books when they have nothing to do with the religion. \n\nMany universities have been demolished and Millions of these works have been burnt down by Mughals. They banned Indian education and forced Islam over 200 years. Then came the Great Britain and imposed "Macaulay" type education system which tried to dumb down Indians for more than 300 years to mere workers and destroy their culture. Sadly this Macaulay system is still prevalent in India.\n\nPS- The funny part is that they won\'t teach us this in school instead they teach some tailor made history cooked up by these biased historians. I guess this is common in the most of the countries that have been colonies of western countries.\n\nJai Hind!'<br />Author: 'm_a_n_u_18'<br />id: 'kel3on'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li><li>Title: 'Muslims in EX-Hindu?

The Chinese have crossed their limit once again.'<br />Body: 'There is a game called Devotion which is an excellent horror video game made by Taiwanese developer "Red Candle Games" and was released in early 2019. The game had a reference of Xi Ping as Winnie the pooh and then Chinese suckers started review bombing on steam so badly until the devs had to remove it (It\'s unknown if Valve, owner of Steam made them do it). \n\nFast forward to today, it was announced the game is not going to available on gog,com a DRM free game store owned by CDPR \\[Publishers of arguably the best game ever The Witcher 3 and the recent Cyberpunk 2077\\]. Soon after the announcement, gog announced on their twitter " Earlier today, it was announced that the game Devotion is coming to GOG. After receiving many messages from gamers, we have decided not to list the game in our store."\n\nNever knew CCP were "gamers". Anyways the game had a patch \\[1.05\\] where the reference was removed before the game was taken out from steam. So the game doesn\'t even have the reference/Easter egg anymore yet CCP c\\*nts made them remove the game. If the censorship was just in China it would have been acceptable. But they are literally forcing to censor worldwide. \n\nHere\'s the tweet link: https://twitter.com/GOGcom/status/1339227388438306817?s=20'<br />Author: 'chratoc'<br />id: 'keh67o'<br />Flair ::China-Flag: CKMKB</li><li>Title: 'Kanhaiya still playing with it.'<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Unemployed Kanhaiya Kumar](https://preview.redd.it/2an765ypel561.png?width=870&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c53e8c02390102c94e4e9841e464d81b9c6f306)'<br />Author: 'Background_Screen497'<br />id: 'keeurx'<br />Flair ::topkek: Low Effort Meme</li><li>Title: '"When the slave will whip himself after the master has long gone, the work of colonialism is complete"--Radha Bharadwaj.'<br />Body: '"When the slave will whip himself after the master has long gone, the work of colonialism is complete"--Radha Bharadwaj.'<br />Author: 'thr0Wawayfitness'<br />id: 'kedxep'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: '[askchodi] jab Kashmir se pandito ko bhagaya gaya tb bjp ki sarkar thi aisa mene suna.

Rama and Lord Krishna\nजब मैं zoya Mansoori को पढ़ता हूँ तो कई बार तो ये  विश्वास ही नही होता कि ये पोस्ट एक 19 साल की लड़की ने लिखी है ........ \nखैर लिखती तो वो तब भी गजब थी जब सिर्फ 15 साल की थी और 10th में पढ़ती थी । \nजो वो15 साल की उम्र में लिख देती थी,हम 55 साल में नही लिख पाते। ये पोस्ट पढिये। \n*\nसामवेद में दो तरह के श्लोक है। अरण्य के श्लोक और ग्राम के श्लोक। अरण्य जहां नियम नहीं होते, ग्राम जहाँ नियम होते हैं। अरण्य जहाँ पशु रहते हैं, ग्राम जहाँ मानव रहते हैं। राम यज्ञ से पैदा हुए थे, आकाश पुत्र थे। उनकी पत्नी सीता भूमि से पैदा हुई थी, भूमिजा थी, वन्य कन्या थी। राम सारी उम्र अरण्य के पशुओं और ग्राम के मानवों को मैनेज करने में लगे रहे, पशुओं को इंसान बनाते रहे। राम ग्राम वासी भी थे और वनवासी भी। वन में शिव रहते है जो दिगंबर हैं। शिव देह पर भभूत लगाए बैठे है, दिगम्बर हैं। देह पर भभूत लगाने का अर्थ है देह को ही त्याग देना। राम शिव भक्त भी है इसलिए राम के फैसलो में, भाव में दिगम्बर परम्परा दिखती है। माँ के कहने पर राज्य त्याग दिया, आभूषण त्याग दिए, मुकुट त्याग दिया। धोबी के कहने पर रानी सीता त्याग दी। जीवन पर्यन्त नियमों का पालन करते रहे, नियम सही हो या गलत उन्हें पालन करना ही था।\n\nइसके विपरीत कृष्ण कभी किसी बंधन में नहीं रहे। उनके ऊपर परिवार का सबसे बड़ा बेटा होने का भार नहीं था। वो सबसे छोटे थे इसलिए स्वतंत्र थे और चंचल भी। मर्यादा का भार नहीं था उनपर। उन्होंने अरण्य और ग्राम में बैलेंस साधने की कोशिश कभी नहीं की। उन्होंने वन को ही मधुवन बना लिया। वो राजा नहीं थे,न ही राजा बन सकते थे इसलिए गलत नियम मानने को बाध्य नहीं थे कृष्ण। उन्होंने नियमों को नहीं माना। राम rवचन के पक्के थे, उन्होने अयोध्या वासियों को वचन दिया था कि चौदह वर्ष बाद लौट आऊँगा। समय से पहुँचने के लिए उन्होंने पुष्पक विमान का उपयोग किया। कृष्ण ने गोपियों को वचन दिया था, मथुरा से लौट कर जरुर आऊँगा, वो कभी नहीं लौटे। राम ने गलत सही हर नियम माना, कृष्ण ने गलत नियम तोड़े। राम के राज्य में एक मामूली व्यक्ति रानी पर अभिव्यक्ति की आज़ादी के नियम के तहत गॉसिप कर सकता था मगर कृष्ण को शिशुपाल भी सौ से ज्यादा गाली नहीं दे सकते थे। राम मदद तभी करते है जब आप खुद लड़ो। वो पीछे से मदद करेंगे। सुग्रीव को दो बार बाली से पिटना पड़ा तब राम ने वाण चलाया। कृष्ण स्वयं सारथी बन के आगे बैठते हैं।\n\nनरेंद्र मोदी को देखिए। वो भी त्यागने की बात करते हैं। पुराने नोट त्याग दो, दो नम्बर का पैसा त्याग दो, गैस सब्सिडी त्याग दो। उनके सारे फैसले राज-धर्म, संविधान के अनुरूप ही होते है, भले ही संविधान का वो नियम सही हो या गलत। मोदी हमेशा अरण्य और ग्राम में बैलेंस साधने की कोशिश करते हैं। सबका साथ सबका विकास। वो पशुओं को मानव बनाने का प्रयास करते हैं। अभिव्यक्ति की आज़ादी के नाम अपना पराया कोई भी उन्हें 24 घण्टे गाली दे सकता हैं। दिगम्बर भाव है, सब त्याग बैठे है, अपमान सम्मान सब। आपकी गालियों से उन्हें ताकत मिलती है। विरोध के अधिकार के नाम पर आप उनकी नाक के नीचे सड़क जाम कर महीनों बैठ सकते हैं। वो देश के बड़े बेटे है, नियम अनुरूप ही आचरण करेंगे। भेदभाव करते हुए नहीं दिख सकते।\n\nवहीं योगी आदित्यनाथ को देखिए। उसी अभिव्यक्ति की आज़ादी के नाम पर एक उन्हें एक गाली दे दीजिए, 24 घण्टे के अंदर आप पर मुकदमा होगा औऱ 48 घण्टे में जेल में होंगे। कनिका कपूर मुंबई, दिल्ली, लखनऊ कानपुर गई। कहीं मुकदमा दर्ज नहीं हुआ उस पर सिवाय यूपी के। आपिये दिन रात फ़र्ज़ी खबरें शेयर करते है मोदी के अगेंस्ट। मोदी रिस्पॉन्स नहीं देते। योगी आदित्यनाथ पर एक फ़र्ज़ी ट्वीट में ही राघव चड्ढा पर मुकदमा दर्ज हो जाता है। जिस विरोध के अधिकार के तहत दिल्ली में सौ दिन से ज्यादा प्रदर्शन होता रहा, उन्हीं नियमों के तहत यूपी में एक भी प्रदर्शन नहीं चल पाया। राजनीति का नियम है कि सरकार बदलने पर बदला नहीं लिया जाता। योगी जी ने आज़म खान के पूरे परिवार को जेल में सड़ा दिया। मोदी का भाव दिगम्बर है योगी का आचरण दिगम्बर है। मोदी तब मदद करेंगे जब आप खुद लड़ोगे। योगी शंखनाद होते ही रथ की लगाम थाम लेते हैं।\n\n*तेलगू फ़िल्म गब्बर सिंह का एक डायलॉग है, "I don\'t follow a trend, I set new trends." मोदी ट्रेंड फॉलो करते है, योगी ट्रेंड सेट करते हैं, क्रिएट करते हैं। यू हैव राम इन त्रेता, यू हैव कृष्ण इन द्वापर। यू हैव बोथ इन

I suppose you can see where I\'m going with this. Because most things posted here are kind of hateful towards some community that\'s not religiously Hindu.\n\nI, too, am someone whom most here might call a "librandu" or some other derogatory name although I don\'t consider myself a liberal at all. I am hindu, but mostly because I am a citizen of Hindustan. I think Indian history, philosophy, and the expertise in math is fascinating. I also think Islam is a book of bad ideas, Christianity too has its fair share of horrible ideas. I\'m just saying all of that to give you a background, because I\'m not the typical user I mostly see on this sub. I\'m also not someone who ignores that Islam is dangerous and says all religions are equal because they\'re clearly not.\n\nI like it when Krishn says I accept worship in any way or in any form devotees offer it to me. I do not like when Christ says I am the only door to god. So in that way I am secular because the most incredible book of knowledge produced in my country says so. And it\'s also practical, it avoids holy wars.\n\nBut coming to why I made this post. The sub says no hate but there\'s a lot of hate. Against liberals, Christians, Muslims, and apparently even Sikhs because they were seen feeding Muslims. And I understand there are some very valid criticisms, but I do not understand the hate. I understand people are angry, rightly so because our liberal leaders of the past have done a great amount of dis-service. Over all, I\'m confused, is this a political sub that respects all or is it just a sub for doing what you can\'t on the other sub (you know which).\n\nAnd if it is really a sub for all, might I request that we criticize ideas, rather than people by calling names like liberandu, rice bags, or something else.

On the other hand, **Sarma** had earlier **said** that **the state government had been spending Rs 260 crore annually for running the madrassas and "the government cannot spend public money for religious teaching".**  \n\n\n"In order to bring uniformity, teaching the **Quran at the cost of government exchequer could not be allowed to continue**," he had said.  \n\n\nHe said that currently there are four Arabic colleges also under the State Madrassa Board and in these colleges and madrassas had two syllabus, one is purely theological subject on Islam, and the other is general syllabus prescribed by higher secondary education council.  \n\n\nHe claimed that besides the guardians and parents, most of the students enrolled in the madrassas, want to become doctors and engineers and are not aware of the fact that these are not regular schools.  \n\n\nA survey conducted by a Guwahati University professor, who happens to be a Muslim, found that the parents and guardians of most of the students of the madrasas are not aware of the fact that their children are not taught the regular subjects but are imparted lessons mostly in theology.  \n\n\nHe claimed that, most Islamic scholars are also not in favour of madrassas being run under the government and added that the madrassas were set up in the pre-Independence era and are a legacy of the Muslim League. \n\n[http://ianslive.in/index.php?param=news/Assam\\_to\\_be\\_Indias\\_1st\\_state\\_to\\_teach\\_Indian\\_civilisation-745276/NATION/1](http://ianslive.in/index.php?param=news/Assam_to_be_Indias_1st_state_to_teach_Indian_civilisation-745276/NATION/1)'<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'kdmhnl'<br />Flair :Bakchod News :news:</li><li>Title: 'I need help'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'someone_you_may_kn0w'<br />id: 'kdm6d1'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Butthurt OP</li><li>Title: 'https://mobile.twitter.com/DanielDumbrill/status/1286262594680938496'<br />Body: "Always play victim card.

I hope you guys love this one as well and stay tuned for more. Cheers)\n\n\n\n\nThe Brahmins and Kshatriyas had since the days of King Sudas and Guru Vashishta, defended the borders of Aryavarta, with iron and blood. Yet, after 500 years of resistance against the Arab Caliphate, between 700AD to 1200AD, the Brahmin domains of Sindh and Kabul had withered away. It now fell upon the Rajputs, to struggle and sacrifice in service of nation and religion. For the next 700 years, the Rajputs stood as the bulwark for the Hindu nation in the face of absolute subjection, displaying standards of chivalry and morality, which have never been surpassed by any other race in any other country.\n\n\n\n\nYet, when the Marathas rose to prominence, the Rajput character had changed. Just as a sword dulls with age and iron rusts with time, so did the nobility and chivalry of the Rajputs suffer the ravages of jealousy, clan rivalry and centuries of war. Emperor Aurangzeb, given his suspicion of non-Muslims, distanced himself from the Rajputs who had served the Mughals since the days of Akbar, as renowned generals and administrators. Hence, they were robbed of court prestige and overseas posts which filled their coffers. The age wasn\'t conducive to the Rajput way of war anymore either. Gone were the days when the sword and the Lance could carry the day, it was the age of muskets and cannons that made so much fodder out of massed cavalry charges. Hence, to prosper, the Rajputs needed to acquire rich lands, outside their barren and poor homelands.\n\n\n\n\nIt was this internal rivalry and constant strife among the great houses of Rajputana, that gave the Marathas an opportunity for expanding their influence. It\'s questionable, whether Maratha policy in Rajputana was a well thought out strategy or, simply fortuitous pragmatism, but what is certain is that the Marathas who were employed by the Rajputs as mercenaries and confederates, in the end reigned supreme.\n\n\n\nThrough their constant interference and employment in Rajput affairs and civil wars, Peshwa Bajirao, his son and Peshwa, Nana Saheb as well as Malharrao Holkar, Ranoji Scindia and Jayappa Scindia managed to extract huge sums our of the Rajput coffers, as legitimate payments, as war indemnity and as plunder out of their lands.\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the best example of the chaos of this period can best be understood from the example of Raja Madho Singh of Jaipur, and the War of Succession for the Throne of Jaipur (1743-1750).\n\n\nMaharaja Jagat Singh of Udaipur, married off his sister to Sawai Jai Singh of Jaipur on the condition that their son would take the throne of Jaipur, even if he had elder siblings from Jai Singh\'s other wives. \nThis son, was Madho Singh.\n\n\n\nSawai Jai Singh died in 1743, and when Madho Singh demanded part of the patrimony, Ishwari Singh declined which led to civil war. Ishwari Singh secured the support of Ranoji Scindia. Madho Singh secured the support of Jayappa Scindia and Malharrao Holkar for a sum of twenty lakhs. The following battles resulted in the two Maratha chiefs getting richer and the two brothers bleeding each other dry. Eventually the Peshwa intervened and after Madho Singh promised him 15 lakhs, Peshwa Balajirao "Nana Saheb" of which he received 10 lakhs when he arrived in person to confirm upon Madho Singh four districts. Ishwari refused the proposal and after being defeated in the subsequent battle that followed, committed suicide in 1750.\n\n\n\nTherefore, Madho Singh became Raja. He proposed to pay 10 lakhs in tribute on top of the 5 lakhs already promised to the Peshwa. But here too, the Maratha appetite for gold, showed its ugly face. The Marathas now demanded cession of at least 1/4th of his country. This was resented by Madho Singh, his nobles and his people.\n\n\n\nTherefore, to escape such unjust demands, Madho Singh plotted and murdered 4000 Marathas in Jaipur, through deceit, including generals and their families.\n\n\nIn response, Raghunath Rao, who was already in the North, settling arrears, proceeded to Jaipur. After a brief war, in 1758, a total sum of Rs. 55,14,962 was imposed on Madho Singh of which he paid only 6 lakhs to Raghunath, promising the rest in installments.\n\n\n\nIn 1759, Malharrao arrived to collect the arrears, but by now, Madho Singh knew, through regular communication with Durrani, that the Afghans would invade and Holkar would have to leave. He therefore held out and paid nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, greed, rivalry, lust for power, land and plunder was what made tha Marathas and the Rajputs into bitter rivals. Though, one must not consider this to characterise the relationship between these two power throughout their history, but certainly this was the picture, before the Third Battle of Panipat.\n\n\n\n\nSources : "Marathas and Panipat" by Hari Ram Gupta\n\n\n\n"Military History of India" by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n\n\n"Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan" by Lt.

His inherent military talent and his ability for diplomacy and sound administration, meant that he rose from being the commander under a Faujdar, all the way to being the Governor of Awadh ( Oudh) and Agra.\n\n\n\n\nWhen he held the Subehdaari (Governorship) of both Agra and Oudh, he was also appointed the Mir Bakshi and Mir-e-Atish, and he was at the zenith of his career. He was a loyal noble, one of the last servants of the Mughals who was loyal to his salt and soil. Above all, he wished for his Subahs to be rich, prosperous and protected. He viewed the Marathas as invaders from the South and adopted a policy of armed resistance against them. Throughout the remainder of his career, he remained loyal to his family, his only wife, to the Mughal Empire and above all to Awadh. He was a veteran of Karnal, being the only Mughal noble to actually inflict any casualties upon the Persians under Nadir Shah. After his death, his son, Safdar Jung, inherited his father\'s titles. \n\n\n\n\nUnlike his father, Safdar Jung, was disillusioned by the Mughal Emperor. He knew, that the only way to secure the peace and prosperity of the realm was for him to become Wazir, he had to ensure that loyal and dilligent Indians were placed in the highest posts of the beaurocracy and the Turanis had to be expelled from the court. He also had to contend with the resurgent Afghan power in Rohillkhand, as well as the Jats, the Sikhs and the invaders from beyond the frontiers. He therefore, wished for the Peshwa Balajirao to be an ally and protector of the realm. \n\n\n\nTo him, being a Shia, he found Hindus to be much better allies as compared to Sunnis. He always made Brahmins his Dewan and Senapati. A practice followed by his father, and all his successors. \n\n\n\nSafdar Jung allied with the Marathas and the Jats, both of whom he brought to his side in return for daily cash payments and with Dattaji Scindia, inflicted heavy defeats upon the Bangash Afghans. By March 1752, the Afghan had lost nearly 20,000 men and were forced into retreat from Awadh. In March of the same year, Durrani captured Lahore. Safdar Jung convinced his Maratha allies with the following treaty :\n\n\n\n1) The Peshwa would defend the Empire against Durrani or any other external threat and internal threats such as the Afghans for a total Rs. 50 lakh\n\n\n\n2) To meet military expenditure, the Peshwa would be granted the Chauth of Sind, Punjab, and a few districts of Upper Ganga Doab.\n\n\n\n3) The Peshwa would be made Governor of Agra, Mathura, Narnaul and Ajmer, though he would not disturb the existing system of administration. Plus, his generals would wait upon the Emperor like other nobles.\n\n\n\nThis pact, was among Safdar Jung\'s greatest national services to date. Sadly, the Mughal Emperor had already formally ceded Punjab to Durrani, and in his hollow confidence, rejected Safdar Jung\'s proposal for the Treaty. The Marathas now demanded Rs.50 lakhs as payment and began plundering. At the same time, their attempt to have a friendly ruler established in the Deccan fell through.\n\n\n\n\nAt this point in 1753, Imad-ul-Mulk, the successor of the arch nemesis of the house of Awadh and leader of the Turanis prevailed upon the Peshwa, through the Emperor, with an offer of Rs. 2 crore and the Provinces of Safdar Jung (Awadh and Allahabad). The Peshwa, took back any support from Safdar Jung, who was attacked by the Mughals as well as the 4000 Marathas in Delhi under Antaji Mankeshwar. Safdar Jung was defeated and was forced to part with his post of Wazir and Mir Bakshi, spoils of the Victors. The former Wazir and perhaps the last patriotic noble in the Mughal Empire died a betrayed and broken hearted man. \n\n\n\nWith this betrayal of trust, the Marathas had turned against them the House of Awadh. The most powerful house in the North which was loyal to its soil. \n\n\n\nShuja-ud-Daulah, was nowhere near as noble as his father Safdar Jung, to speak nothing of his grandfather. He was a man of vice, and average competence. But when he was presented an opportunity to fight against the Marathas, he took it.

I vividly remember holding my hand to my mouth while the composition, which was composed by Ramadasu, that seemingly was insulting Lord Rama was sung.\n\nFor instance, one line in the composition goes  \n“*Neevu kulukucu tirigevu evarabba sommani Ramachandra*”\n\nwhich basically means\n\n“With whose father’s wealth do you think you are shamelessly enjoying and traveling?”\n\nBlasphemous, I thought!\n\nThe next lines went further:  \n“*Mee tandri Dasharatha Maharaju pettena Ramachandra?*\n\n*Leka mee Mama Janaka Maharaju Pampena Ramachandra?*”\n\nHere, Ramadasu was asking Lord Rama if the wealth and jewels Rama was adorned with in Bhadrachalam were paid for by Dasharatha Maharaja or sent by his father-in-law Janaka Maharaja.\n\nMy initial shock transitioned into pondering; I wondered why a devotee that sacrificed freedom to build a Rama temple in Bhadrachalam was questioning the very same divine being.\n\nI didn’t have to think long because I began to understand what I was listening to when the last line from the composition was sung:\n\n“*Bhaktu landarini paripalincedi Sri Ramachandra. Neevu kshemamuga Sri Ramadasuni elumu Ramachandra*”\n\nMeaning?\n\n“You are the one who rules and looks after your devotees, O’ Lord Rama. So please ensure that your very own Ramadasu is also safe and protected, O’ Lord Rama.”\n\nWelcome to Ninda Stutis\n\n **First, what are Ninda Stutis?**\n\nNinda Stuti essentially translates into praising (Stuti) through blame or abuse (Ninda). Confusing? What I also thought. In Ninda Stuti pieces, you question the Divine. Sometimes you scold them or make unflattering comparisons, such as how Sant Tukaram compares Lord Vitthala to a Bhoota (Ghost) in *Pandhariche Bhoota Mothe*.\n\nHowever one chooses to approach Ninda Stutis, one thing is for certain: it always is done out of love. Love for the Divine.\n\nSo evident is this that Purandara Dāsa, who is known as the father of Carnatic Music and for his loving praises to Lord Krishna, composed several Ninda Stutis to express his love in a different, unique manner. Even the great Sadhguru Sri Tyagaraja composed Ninda Stutis, such as *Abhimaanamu Ledemi* in Andhaali Raga. While they may superficially seem like abusive rants, Ninda Stutis are a unique way for great devotees of the Divine to praise them and show their love for them.\n\nIn a world so sensitive to so many topics relating to blasphemy in religious matters, it speaks well of Hindus, Hinduism and Hindu deities that Ninda Stutis have found a notable place in Indian Classical Music, particularly in Carnatic Music and the Varkari Genre. When I asked my guru why Ninda Stutis have not been shunned, she relayed that the deities are not so weak that they get offended when their dear and beloved devotees choose to express their love creatively.\n\nAt the same time, she rightly stated that Ninda Stutis are not a license to insult with malignant intentions. Let me say that again: they are not licenses to insult Hindu deities with malignant intentions. Those who think so miss the point of Ninda Stutis entirely. Ninda Stutis are simply praises of love and admiration composed and performed in the quest to seek unity with Brahman, which is the ultimate divine reality for Hindus. Let them be heard and sung. Let them bring us closer to the Divine.\n\nSource- [https://www.hindustudentscouncil.org/2020/06/14/ninda-stutis-praising-the-divine-through-scolding/](https://www.hindustudentscouncil.org/2020/06/14/ninda-stutis-praising-the-divine-through-scolding/)'<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'kbif9q'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li><li>Title: 'limited offer: Free copy of The Holy Geeta with commentary by Swami Chinmayananda in celebration of Geeta Jayanti'<br />Body: ' You can purchase this copy of The Holy Geeta with commentary by Swami Chinmayananda for free at Google Play Books here: [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mv4MEAAAQBAJ&amp;rdid=book-Mv4MEAAAQBAJ&amp;rdot=1&amp;source=gbs\\_vpt\\_read&amp;pcampaignid=books\\_booksearch\\_viewport](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mv4MEAAAQBAJ&amp;rdid=book-Mv4MEAAAQBAJ&amp;rdot=1&amp;source=gbs_vpt_read&amp;pcampaignid=books_booksearch_viewport)'<br />Author: 'ChinmayaMission'<br />id: 'kbhim5'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'Modi is Nice Guy , We need Yogi the bad boy.'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'LonelyWait'<br />id: 'kbg77k'<br />Flair ::shit: Shitpost</li><li>Title: 'Tamil friend wants to learn Hindi, what do?'<br />Body: 'I kept telling my buddy how much of the Viraat dialogues he’s been missing out on due to him not being able to understand hindi.
