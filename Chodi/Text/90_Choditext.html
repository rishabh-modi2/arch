He was a *Malang* (didn’t care about world). I said – “money is everything”. He replied – “Didn’t you have it in Gujranwala? Why did you run away from there? And what’s the guaranty that you won’t run away from Amritsar 40 years later?” I was furious. I had no idea what he was saying.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Next week, I had a train to Amritsar in night. I was going home in semester break. The Malang came to see me off to station. “You got everything in life. But.. Ask your grandfather. Could money save his family?”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Train arrived. Malang returned. But I was stunned. What did he know about my grandfather that I didn’t? The train started moving.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I was home next day. Big beautiful house. Loving parents, but always under stress of business. I am going to meet Nanaji tomorrow, I told Mom. “What happened? Stay with us for some days. Will go together to meet Nanaji. He is ill”, she told.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I was in Jalandhar next day.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I : Nanaji, what happened in 1947? \xa0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Grandfather : Nothing, Puttar (son). What happened?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I : Where are your siblings currently?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;G: I don’t have any. I was lone child of my parents.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I : How come? In your times, parents used to have 10-12 kids on an average. Why didn’t your parents have more?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;G : Haha! They were great planners! Take rest now.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Next day, I was playing video game in my room. Nanaji came, sat besides me.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Grandfather : Playing Contra?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I : Yes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;G: Have you seen 7 colours of sun-rays ever?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I : No.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;G : Let me show you, come to terrace.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We both went up. Beautiful sunshine. Sun was about to set.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;G : Do you see the saffron?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I : Yes, whole sky is saffron!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;G : There are 7 colours in this saffron. But they will be gone soon. There will be darkness all over.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I : That’s natural. It happens every evening.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;G : Hmm. It happens once in centuries too. Do you know I have named 7 rays of sun as – Lajjo, Rajjo, Bhaggo, Paro, Gayo, Isho, and Urmi?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I : Why?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;G : There was a Balwant Khatri in Gujranwala, a rich landlord. Big Haveli was among largest in Gujranwala. He had 7 daughters and a son from wife Prabhavati Devi.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Baldev (son) – 20  \nLajwanti – 19  \nRajwati – 17  \nBhagvati – 16  \nParvati – 15  \nGayatri – 13  \nIshvari – 11  \nUrmila – 9  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Theirs was a beautiful family. A rich Punjabi Hindu Khatri family. They were looking for suitable grooms for Lajjo and Rajjo. However, something was not right in Punjab. \xa0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Barrister Jinnah had declared Direct Action Day for Pakistan. Hindu-Sikhs knew that Gandhi Ji’s ideals can’t be defeated by some miscreants. After all Hindu-Sikhs sang\xa0*Avval Allah Noor upaayaa*. Hindu-Sikhs used to sing Baba Bulleh Shah, Baba Farid’s poetry and visit Sufi Mazars. After all Gujranwala was full of Jatt, Gujjar and Rajput Muslims. How could they – the blood brothers – harm their own blood?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Soon, the news of massacre of hundreds of Hindu-Sikhs started coming from nearby places. Mobs chanting\xa0*Allahu Akbar*\xa0and\xa0*Pakistan ka matlab kya La ilaah illillah*\xa0were heard shouting – “no woman of Kafir will go to India, we will take them”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It was morning of 18th Sep, 1947. A Sikh postman almost barged into the Haveli shouting – “Lala Ji, leave the place. They are coming for your daughters. Lajjo will be Salim’s. Sheikh Muhammad will take Rajwati. Bhagwati will go to…” Lala Balwant slapped him hard. What rubbish? Salim is Mukhtar Bhai’s son. Mukhtar Bhai is like our family.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“Mukhtar Bhai only is leading the mob, Lala Ji. All Hindu-Sikhs are fleeing to India. Will go in lots of 300-400 people in an hour. Get family to city Gurudwara fast”, the Sikh shouted and fled.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lala Ji rushed to Prabhavati who was 7 months pregnant. She was in tears already. She overheard everything.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Prabhavati : We need to go, Lala Ji.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant : We are going nowhere. Sardar is lying. Mukhtar Bhai can’t do that. Ideas of Gandhi Ji can’t be defeated.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Prabhavati : It’s not time to discuss ideas. We must go. I have asked daughters to pack jewellery and papers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant : But Mukhtar Bhai… I have to talk to him.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Prabhavati : He came last month when you were not home. He told Salim likes Lajjo and wanted to do Nikah with her. Lajjo told that Salim eve-teases her with his friends. She has stopped going out because of him.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant : Why didn’t you tell this earlier? I could have talked to Mukhtar Bhai.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Prabhavati : You are too naive. He himself wanted to take Lajjo for Salim. Now he is coming to take her by force. Let’s leave.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;City Gurudwara was full of Hindu-Sikhs. Men with swords and spears were guarding Gurudwara boundaries. Gujranwala, known for wrestlers, had Akhadas in many temples and Gurudwaras. Well built Hindu-Sikh men were deployed at the main entrance. Many were guarding the terrace. Many were sharpening swords on the stone near the well. Women, girls, and children were terrified. Mothers had pulled Infants/kids close to them.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Suddenly, a huge cry broke the silence. It came from the Badi Masjid from across the road. A mob of thousands was shouting slogans-  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Pakistan ka matlab kya la ilah illillah*\xa0(Pakistan means there is no god but Allah)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Hass ke litta vai Pakistan, khoon naal lavaange Hindustan*\xa0(we took Pakistan with smile, will take India with blood)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Kaafron, kattna asi dikhaavange*\xa0(Kafirs, see how we butcher you)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Kise mandir vich ghanti nahi vajjugi hun*\xa0(no temple will remain, no bell will ring in temples)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Hindu di janaani bistar vich, te aadmi shamshaan vich*\xa0(Hindu women belong to our bed, men to crematorium)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Prabhavati was sitting near window surrounded by 7 daughters. Her only son was guarding the main gate outside. Suddenly the mob from the mosque across had turned silent for some reason. In a minute, the screams of\xa0*La ilah illillah*\xa0started again. And this time, the volume kept going louder.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The mob with swords, daggers, spears and chains was approaching the Gurudwara. Prabhavati was first to witness from the window. She shouted – “They are coming” and held all her kids tightly in fear.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Gates of Gurudwara were locked from inside. All men took positions inside near walls and gates. All Hindu-Sikh men were asked to listen the announcement. Sukhdev Sharma, a wrestler and priest, stood up and said –  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“They are coming for our mothers, sisters, wives and daughters. Their swords are for our necks. They will ask us to convert to their faith and surrender. I have decided. I won’t surrender. I won’t convert. Neither shall I allow them to touch our women.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There was a pin drop silence for 3 seconds. And the Hindu-Sikhs roared  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“J*o bole so nihaal sat Shri Akaal! Wahe Guru Ji da Khalsa waahe Guru Ji di fateh!*\xa0No one will leave Dharma of our ancestors. Let them taste our swords”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mob had entered the Gurudwara. The first lot of 50-60 attackers was slaughtered in no time. People inside Gurudwara were prepared and in better position for small mob. There was hardly any casualty on this side. Hall of women &amp; children was locked from inside.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The mob of hundreds chanting religious slogans stood at 50 meters distance from the Gurudwara for 30 minutes. They were waiting for something. Soon the reinforcement came. This time, they were in thousands. Hindu-Sikhs inside Gurudwara were hardly 400. Men were 50-60. Rest were old, women and children.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This had to be the final battle. The mob had displayed a Sikh woman they abducted from her home being dragged in front of everyone. Her clothes had been torn. She was being paraded naked while the men were cheering assaulting her sensitive organs. She fell unconscious. But many vultures from mob kept playing with her body. Finally, someone cut off her breasts and threw them towards Gurudwara.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hindu-Sikhs of Gujranwala had heard about this barbarism in news. They were seeing it for first time. Suddenly, everyone started thinking about their women. What if our women fall in their hands after we die? This was the moment when even death was looking easy. Something else was scarier.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mob had started breaking the gates.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lajjo :\xa0*Tusi katto bapuji, Main Musalmaanani nahi banugi* (go ahead father, I won’t go to a Muslim)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant : (crying, not able to speak)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lajjo :\xa0*Karo bapuji, te bhajjo jaldi etho*\xa0(do it father, and run)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant : (crying more, it was gut-wrenching) I can’t, my daughter. How can I?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lajjo : If you don’t, they will cut my breas…(thak, the sword struck Lajjo’s neck)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lajjo’s head rolled down the well. Balwant’s strike of sword was accurate. Her headless body was pushed down the well too. Now the mob could not touch her clothes. Nobody could cut her…. She was liberated.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It was Rajjo’s turn next.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Then Bhaggo’s.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Then Paro’s.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Then Gayo’s.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Then Isho’s.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;and finally, Urmi’s.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The father would kiss forehead of each and take the head next.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant liberated his seven daughters on 18th Sep 1947. The mobs chanting religious slogans were so close to the 7 sisters. But their father could manage to save them. What if the cost he paid was their lives? At least their breasts were intact. Their honour was intact. Their freedom was intact.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Even the remaining bodies were fed to the well because even the dead bodies of girls were not safe.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Gates of the Gurudwara had been broken. Swords of Hindu-Sikhs were chopping rioters left, right, and centre. Heavily outnumbered, the Hindu-Sikhs killed many times more. A great resistance was put up. The natives of Gujranwala showed for the last time that this land still belonged to Sardar Hari Singh Nalwa and Ram. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant : Prabhavati, Lala Jagjeevan’s Tangas are waiting at the back gate of Gurudwara. He has just messaged me to escort as many women and children as we could. Take all women and children there. Baldev! You will go with mother.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Baldev : (silently nodded his head)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Prabhavati : But you? I wont go without you (was crying)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant : You have to live. For the unborn. Baldev and you must reach India. I will come too.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Prabhavati : Why won’t you come with us? \xa0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant : You are going with Baldev and the unborn. I will come in next lot. Lalaji and few men are taking you to station.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant kissed her forehead, hugged Baldev and gently caressed the unborn. “Hurry up”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Tanga of Prabhavati and Baldev had left for station.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant had lost sanity. He was perhaps the only father to have killed seven of own children in order to protect them from something more gruesome. With trembling legs, he went to the well and shouted – “Two kids have their mother with them. 7 kids here must have their father. Jai Shri Krishna..”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Balwant had stabbed himself and jumped into the well. This man gave 7 Padminis to the society.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nanaji’s tears couldn’t stop. Neither could mine.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I : How do you know all this?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Grandfather : Baldev was my friend in college.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I : Where is he now? I want to meet him.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Grandfather : He died.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I cried a lot that night. But suddenly, I recalled my senior’s words – “ask your grandfather, could money save his family?”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I went straight to Nanaji’s personal room where his documents and belongings were kept. I slowly and quietly unlocked the locker.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There was a photograph of his teenage. With his parents sitting in middle while he stood at their backside. And there were seven smiling sisters. Like the seven rays of sun…  \n&gt;  \n&gt;—————-  \n&gt;  \n&gt;PS : We lost 28 family members in creation of Pakistan. My great grandfather, his brothers, sisters and their families were killed. All hailed from Gujranwala, Pakistan. All in the name of\xa0*La ilah illillah – there is no god but Allah*.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Protesters of Shaheen Bag, Delhi are no victims. I am the victim. There are millions more trapped in fanatic lands of Af-Pak-Ban who have been subject to worst religious persecution are the victims and need to be rescued.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We have moved on. But Pak-lovers in India haven’t. And now I believe unilateral moving on from history is dangerous. It can make culprits victims and vice versa. So no moving on from now on until all don’t move on.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Please keep my story in mind when you read my next article on why CAA-NRC is must for India and its survival.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Wrote this on insistence of my close friend, a scientist in US.

Given what happened to the community, they take cognisance of the threats of Islamic fundamentalism, and for the same reason, root for an actually secular (read UCC) to a Hindu State depending from person to person. One of my favorite intellectual, Ashish Dhar (Follow Upword right now!) is a KP and I'm a fan of Sushil Pandit too.\n\nBut like all communities, they got their fare share of cucks, from absolute whores like Nidhi Razdan who'd climb into bed with someone like Omar Abdullah, the guy who's very father sat on his ass while Exodus happened under his premiership, to virtue signalling chuttads like Rahul Pandita and Aditya Raj Kaul, to woke people like a few of my college mates, whose think trending #HumWapasAayenge is going to actually return them to their homelands.\n\n**#HUMWAAPISAAYENGE**\n\nLet me put it out for you.\n\nLAWDA NAHI WAPAS JAA PAAOGE\n\nThe amount of virtue signalling amongst these cucks is unbelievable. Rahul Pandita tweeted recently to the tune that CAA is like Gau Raksha for stray cows while the ones in Gaushalas suffered. Valid point, but speaking against amnesty to people who are suffering at hands of Islamic Intolerance. The same reason Kashmiri Pandits are nowhere to be found in Kashmir?\n\nNidhi Razdan is, well, dating Omar Abdullah. Who is father of Omar Abdullah? Farooq Abdullah! Who was the CM of J and K when exodus happened, under whose jurisdiction was law and order when Jihadi mobs ran amok? Farooq Abdullah. I'd find hard to talk to such people. Madam decided it's totally okay to fuck them.\n\n**DONT POLITICISE OUR STRUGGLE**\n\nAditya Raj Kaul objects to Harshvardhan politicising the issue by lauding government to abrogate 370. Arrey madarchod why don't you want to politicise the issue? The only reason any government will take concrete steps is if their is political gains behind this issue. Look at muslims, any demand regarding their community gets politicised and that's why there are so many parties in India parroting their cause. All these 30 years, one party, stood for Hindu causes, and all you got for us is virtue signalling?\n\nWhat cause in India gets accomplished without political patronage. Ram Mandir? Mandal Commission? Shah Bano? It's amazing to think KP's have the history being some of the most scholarly communities in India and yet some of their intellectuals are this stupid.\n\n**THEY REMOVED 370. BUT WHAT HAVE THEY DONE FOR KASHMIRI PANDITS?**\n\nOk. Let's send Kashmiri Pandits back. Infact, no one has stopped them right? Why don't they go back? We all know why they don't. Ashish Dhar in his wonderful video about Kashmiri Pandit exodus says that Hindus of India should not expect Kashmiri Pandits to go back because even with 370 gone, the conditions that lead to ouster of KPs still exist, and people should put pressure on the government to make sure they are safe.\n\nHow the fuck is government supposed to ensure their safety when law and order is in hands of Jihadists like the Abdullahs and Muftis? The same people under whose nose exodus happened? To make Kashmir safe for KPs again, the first thing that needs to be done right is law and order, and 370 abrogation is the first step in that. For 30 years, nothing concrete got done, and now when 370 is abrogated you are sad things are not moving quickly enough?\n\n**And finally, to my Viraat Pandit Hindu Bretheren**\n\nI apologise if I may have hurt any of your feelings in this post. This post has been totally directed to cucks like people who I mentioned above. In my life, I know KPs who I look up to in many ways. But their is a huge problem that these people might alienate Virat KPs and desensitise non-KP Hindus towards their cause. by their virtue signalling. The fight against Abrahamic tolerance goes through the valley of political consolidation, and all of Hindus need to politically consolidate behind this cause.\n\nHAR HAR MAHADEV."<br />Author: 'stolenrhymes'<br />id: 'eqv5ud'<br />Flair :Rant</li><li>Title: 'Look how muslims disrespect the police in general.'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'martianlonewolf'<br />id: 'equlsq'<br />Flair :Jihad</li><li>Title: 'क्या आप अपने पड़ोस के Mucchjid में होने वाले रोज़-रोज़ के रंडी रोने से परेशान हैं? क्या आपके पिछवाड़े में हमेशा चुल्ल मची रहती है की ये Mucchjid वाले लसूड़े पूरा दिन लाउड्स्पीकर पर क्यूँ शोर मचाके पूरे इलाक़े को परेशान करते रेहते हैं? तो आज ही आज़मायिए, हमारा नया उत्पाद, PROJECT - CHUP BSDK!'<br />Body: '\nजी हाँ! आज मैं, आपका अपना मॉड u/एक-बुधवार-प्रतिशोध आपको एक ऐसी चीज़ बनाना सिखाने जा रहा हूँ की आप घर बैठे बैठे दूर से ही उस Mucchjid का लाउड्स्पीकर बंद कर सकते हैं। \n\nयही नहीं, अगर आप बहुत ही गिरे हुए मादरचोद क़िस्म के इंसान हैं, तो आप इसका प्रयोग करके अपने पड़ोसी का, किसी शादी ब्याह में बज रहे DJ का, या फिर अपने कॉलेज/हॉस्टल में पार्टी कर रहे चूतिया लोगों के स्पीकर पूरी तरह बंद कर सकते हैं। \n\nऔर अगर आप थोड़ा खर्चा और कर सकते हैं, तो आप किसी भी स्पीकर में उसका गाना/रंडी-रोना बंद करके अपनी पसंद का गाना बजा सकते हैं (हम यहाँ पर ये साफ़ कर दें कि अगर आप बहुत बड़े वाले मादरचोद टाइप के आदमी हैं, तो इसपर पोर्न फ़िल्में मत चला देना, कहीं शादी ना तुड़वा तो किसी की)। \n\nख़ैर, अब बकचोदी बहुत हो गयी, काम की बात पे आते हैं। यह औज़ार दो तरीक़े से बना सकते हैं आप:\n\n(1). **Cheap Type:** This setup requires following things:\n\n* **CB Radio** : No, not *radio*-radio but Walkie Talkie Radio which can transmit signals. In India, the legal limit of transmission power in CBs is 5W. So puck any one off from Amazon or Flipkart that you like. \n* **Linear Amplifier** : This is a simple to obtain device, which can be connected to your CB and that will amplify your transmission power many times. \n* **Antenna** : You’ll need a simple antenna, which is also available on amazon. It would be better to ground it, or connect it to a big metal object which is in contact with ground. It would be better if you plant the antenna on your roof, and if you live in an apartment/high rise building, you can mount it on your window. Make sure the speaker in  question is in visible range. \n\nNow comes the setup process. You must charge your CB, plug it in the amplifier, and then plug your antenna in your amplifier. Now start the transmission on any channel whenever the रंडी रोना स्पीकर turns on. You’ll need to set your transmission on full power, and you’ll need to keep changing the channels(frequencies) to find out when the target speaker gets destroyed. You can also completely destroy that speaker and fry it upto no use, so make sure to shut off all your speakers beforehand and put your phones to silent, because the radio will mess them up too if they interfere with the signal. Also, don’t do it if your दादा-दादी have hearing aids. \n\n(2). **The Perfect and Pricey Way** : This way, I can guarantee you can fry up every active speaker in your area to ash or play anything on दैट मच्चजिद speaker( absolutely not including porn). The items will be these:\n\n* **HAM Radio** : Consider this a बाप of CB radio. It is way more powerful than CB radio. \n* **Linear Amplifier** : Similar one to the first. \n* **Antenna** : Similar one to the first. \n\nThis pricey type setup will be very easy to setup. You’ll just have to plug wires between *radio-amplifier-antenna* and you’ll be good to go. This type can transmit interference signals to a wide area, and will surely destroy the target speaker. \n\nIf you wonder how this will work, let me explain. The radio will transmit frequencies(make sure you have the receiver on if it’s a CB, or some music from your phone plugged in if it’s a HAM. Don’t worry, some CBs allow external audio input too). \n\nOnce you start the transmission, you’ll have to start flipping the channels(hence frequencies) of the signal. \n\nOn the other side of the field, the speaker with be blaring रंडी रोना in its internal amplifier on a certain frequency. Most Muchhjids use those annoying low quality Megaphone type speakers (commonly called भोंपू , conical in shape) and that type doesn’t have interference protection shield.\n\nSo when you, my bakchod, after continuously changing the frequencies of your radio will match the frequency of that भोंपू, its amplifier/transducer will face heavy interference and audio signals will be distorted, destroyed, muted and eventually the speaker will get fried. \n\nThe cliché here is, if you want to get success with a CB radio, you’ll need to be close to the speaker, 100-150 feet if the speaker is not clearly visible in line of sight. But otherwise, if you have a clear view of the speaker(like on your roof), it can work from even 400-500 feet.\n\nThat’s where the only benefit of HAM radio comes in handy, you can turn it on and it will destroy a speaker even if it’s shoved high up in the ass of someone 1km away. \n\nNow, after you have successfully destroyed a K2Speaker(which I doubt) they’ll try to repair it. They won’t be successful. They’ll buy new भोंपूs then, and you’ll destroy them too. So you, single handedly will revive the economy and povertise the भोंपू का मालिक। After weeks of trying, they’ll eventually abandon the speaker system, and WALLAH! STONKS💹! You can now sleep in peace in your early mornings! \n\nSide benefits of doing this are, you’ll have a CB walkie-talkie in case of a communication blockout like emergency or Section 144, on which you can hear the conversations of police and also use them when someone in your family goes out for some urgent task. And if you buy the second option, a HAM radio, you can communicate with anyone over the **ENTIRE WORLD** (Yes! Truly!). It will be very useful in emergency situations. \n Like I said, the possibilities are endless. Your area may face a flood, earthquake, communication blackout, Section 144, terror attack, National Emergency, you’ll have a communication system at all times. \n\nNow who I am and why I’m writing this? I’m salesman for a radio company. \n\nNo seriously though, I’m an amateur guy who loves innovation but sadly couldn’t get in IIT, so I keep making my life easy by DIY projects. There is no 100% guarantee that this will work, because maybe they have expensive speakers with an interference shield, maybe you got an audio amplifier instead of a radio amplifier, maybe the range is too long, or maybe you’re just fucking dumb and could not connect the setup properly. \n\nI wrote this article because some of our members have said their mood is fucked 5 times in a day, daily. Hum bakchod hain, par usse pehle bhrata hain. \n\nAlso, engineers of r/chodi, correct my technical details if I’m wrong. I’ll edit the post. \n\nPS: I’ll link and add specific items on  soon, along with some proofing. ;)'<br />Author: 'a-wednesday-vendetta'<br />id: 'eqtf0c'<br />Flair :Research</li><li>Title: "Opinion: Just like liberal Bengalis, and Keralites, Kashmiri Pandits brought their exodus upon themselves.

महाराज नागभट्ट अपनी शेष सेना के साथ उधर तैयार खड़े थे। दोपहर होते होते समूची अरब सेना काट डाली गयी। अपनी बर्बरता के बल पर विश्वविजय का स्वप्न देखने वाले आतंकियों को पहली बार किसी ने ऐसा उत्तर दिया था। \n\nविजय के बाद महाराज ने अपने सभी सेनानायकों की ओर देखा, उनमे तक्षक का कहीं पता नही था।सैनिकों ने युद्धभूमि में तक्षक की खोज प्रारंभ की तो देखा-लगभग हजार अरब सैनिकों के शव के बीच तक्षक की मृत देह दमक रही थी। उसे शीघ्र उठा कर महाराज के पास लाया गया। कुछ क्षण तक इस अद्भुत योद्धा की ओर चुपचाप देखने के पश्चात महाराज नागभट्ट आगे बढ़े और तक्षक के चरणों में अपनी तलवार रख कर उसकी मृत देह को प्रणाम किया। युद्ध के पश्चात युद्धभूमि में पसरी नीरवता में भारत का वह महान सम्राट गरज उठा- \n\n"आप आर्यावर्त की वीरता के शिखर थे तक्षक.... भारत ने अबतक मातृभूमि की रक्षा में प्राण न्योछावर करना सीखा था, आप ने मातृभूमि के लिए प्राण लेना सिखा दिया। भारत युगों युगों तक आपका आभारी रहेगा।"\n\n *इतिहास साक्षी है, इस युद्ध के बाद अगले तीन शताब्दियों तक अरबों कीें भारत की तरफ आँख उठा कर देखने की हिम्मत नही हुई।* \n*तक्षक ने सिखाया कि मातृभूमि की रक्षा के लिए प्राण दिए ही नही, लिए भी जाते है, साथ ही ये भी सिखाया कि दुष्ट सिर्फ दुष्टता की ही भाषा जानता है, इसलिए उसके दुष्टतापूर्ण कुकृत्यों का प्रत्युत्तर उसे उसकी ही भाषा में देना चाहिए अन्यथा वो आपको कमजोर ही समझता रहेगा । *\n\nयह पोस्ट किसी की मोहताज नही है। भारत के इतिहास की यह गौरवशाली उच्च कोटि की गाथा है'<br />Author: 'ankit19900'<br />id: 'eqh270'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'Is UP, Bihar and Haryana the bane of India?'<br />Body: " \n\nMost  misogynist illiterate abusive people I met in Gujarat are from UP or  Haryana or Bihar.

People like Guha are only enabling BJP under the garb of criticizing Congress. This is no time for infighting.\n\nForgetting the larger context, even in a one to one comparison between Rahul Gandhi and Modi I would rate Rahul higher. At least he seems to stand up for modern liberal values, has empathy, is willing to engage and listen to others, does not seem to think too highly of himself, is willing to take and answer tough questions, has the courage and conviction to fight on against a ridiculous personal smear campaign by IT cell. Modi is a narcissistic, vindictive, egomaniac who specializes in monologues without any accountability. It's unbelievable how brainwashed the people of the country is to believe Modi's capability as administrator even after he has destroyed the economy, destroyed the credibility of every single institution, destroyed the social fabric of the country and turned it into a civil war like situation in just 6 years. On top of this, the dude is not even intelligent. He is a complete moron who fucks up simple scripted interviews forget about actual press conferences.

It means food, water, air(if possible), transport, money and finances (most imp), information, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe easiest way to do that is SIMPLY TO STOP BUYING FROM MUSLIM SHOPS, STOP HIRING MUSLIM LABOURERS, STOP GIVING MONEY TO MOSQUES, DARGAHS, MUSLIM BEGGARS, ETC.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMUSLIMS are already doing this : \n\nmuslims asked to boycott Hindu shops during Diwali 2019\n\nBoycotting muslims will have positive effect on all kinds of supplies : \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nONE : It will be hard for jobless muzzis to build petrol bombs when petrol is 80rs a litre and you have to pay for empty bottles as well\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTWO : Those stones, bricks, etc. are transported to mosques throughout the country in large tractors. mosques hire muslim labourers to find stones, hire a muslim owned tractor, pay for muslim driver, and pay 80rs litre diesel. its hard to do that when the funds are not coming in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHREE : there are reports from Sri Lanka how muslim food shops are using drugs to make their non-muslim customers impotent (both men and women). a muslim doctor was reported to sterilize about 4000 non-muslim women so that population of non-muslims could be curled quickly (and property, wealth and women of non-muslims could be acquired sooner)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFOUR : Hindus will be assured that their food supply isn't poisoned with impotency drugs when brought from Hindu restaurants.  Same holds for drinking RO Water delivered to most houses these days.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFIVE : A lot of bus, truck services, tracktors, vans, etc. are owned by muslims. It is easier for them to do it because of network effect. A muslim shop owner will give preference to muslim transport company who in turn will hire a muslim driver only. Muslim customers will sit in muslim owned buses and prefer to buy from muslim owned shops products which are made by companies will are owned by muslims. This circulated money grows quickly. it can also be slowed down equally quickly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA huge advantage during times of riots, danga, war, protests, etc. will be that Hindu truck owners can't be used to transport stones, bricks to throw at police or Army, Hindu owned buses can;t be used to transport petrol bombs, swords, etc. in case a war breaks out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is how mulla transportation network within India (one city to another) as well as within a large city say delhi can be crippled . Good luck trying to bring swords and petrol bombs in Delhi metro. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSIX : love Jihad - cases will reduce. it is easy to impress a 16 year old Hindu girl with cheap sale clothes and 12 year old hero karizma (with loud exhausts). The problem here is that parents and relatives of that girl has funded those clothes, bike, etc. by hiring muslims or shopping in muslim stores or giving money to dargah, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, a middle-class 16 year old aadarsh Hindu Balak studying hard to get into IITs could have crorepati parents but wouldn't be riding a fancy motorcycle or fancy clothes. He will look simple, eat simple, drive a simple activa and have a default coconut oil hair for men (instead of hair colour). Girls see this as UNCOOL and won't want to associate with this guy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, most importantly, this 16 year old Hindu baalak has funded the muslim guy by going to mulla shop, donating to mosque or dargah, sitting in mulla autos, etc. Once this Hindu guys becomes 28 year old earning 10 LPA salary, he will get a thoroughly used up pussy of Hindu girl (who had sex with dozens of muslim guys beforehand in her prime 16). allah indeed is merciful. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHad this 16-year old aadarsh Hindu balak been selective where he shopped or whose auto he sat in, MAYBE his future Hindu wife wouldn't had seen dozens of cut muslim cocks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nit is HARD to impress a 16 year old Hindu girl with torn clothes and 12 year old hercules cycle and a nokia 1100 phone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSEVEN : Information - we live in a time when  Information warfare is at its peak in the last 5000 years and it is only going to intensify. Mulla or saudi funded news channels or newspapers keep publishing faake news, mulla punchurewalas sit on his puncher shop and operate 3 facebook accounts with Hindu names (different castes) and make Hindus fight with each other or an office goer mulla who tries to flirt with a Hindu girl using a Hindu boy's profile name. It takes money and free time to connect to internet, spread fake neews, craft propaganda, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf mullas are hand-to-mouth worried about their daily bread, then they won't have time to craft lofty strategies of ghazwa-e-hind. mosques won't be able to fund stone throwers in the name of allah (Rs 500 per day is needed per stone thrower). when mosques have no stones or money, how will they gather crowd to burn police station ? which muslim will join the mob if it means missing a meal for the entire family ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this end PART ONE.

This is such a great loss of world's cultural heritage and Afganistan is still under constant war and threat from Islamic terrorism with unequal rights for women, minorities and LGBT community. And, the world must act now to regain the cultural heritage of Afganistan and retain democracy. \n\nComing to Pakistan, it is itself a predicament. The problem Pakistan is facing is one of an identity crisis. A country that has been part of India's civilizational state but rejected its history and peddled a false propaganda among its citizens that their ancestors are Turkish, Arabs, Persians etc. In reality, none of these contries have good relations today and don't care about Ummah but rather relentlessly pursue their national identity. Pakistan has made its state policy to destroy its Hindu heritage and the world must come out together in its condemnation to protect the ancient Hindu culture of Harappa and Taxila. The Muslims in India also suffer from the same problem as Pakistan but to a lesser extent and our neighbour leaves no stones unturned to create dissent among them. \n\nIndia shares a vast border with China and it has cultural ties too. But, we must not forget Tibet, whose spiritual leader His Holiness Dalai Lama is a terrorist and Buddhist monk who China calls a terrorist. Dalai Lama has brought back with him the Nalanda tradition with him which was lost when Khilji set fire to its millions of books. There is a misconception among some people here who confuse Hindutva with Hindu tribalism, they are no different from their radical left or jihadi counterparts, who use their phony holiness as a moral highground. India had a rich Buddhist heritage as well and we must acknknowledge that and as much we want to rebuild the Ram Mandir, we must want to rebuild Nalanda. The Tibetan Buddhism brought back is a blessing in disguise to us Indians who follow almost exact tradition as Nalanda and has a goldmine to offer. We must promote an Indianized form of Buddhism with the help of Tibetan refugee community and our neighbours down south i.e. Sri Lanka. We must not feel afraid of China, who wants to elect its own Dalai Lama after the passing away of the present one and wants to close the chapter of Tibet for good. If our nation has a consience, then we must not forget the illegal occupation of Tibet, loss of ~40 million lives and destruction of their culture. We must not also forget the bloody nose from 1962 war with megalomaniac Mao's China and its' murderous communism. Here's a [letter](http://www.friendsoftibet.org/main/sardar.html) from Sardar Patel to Nehru warning China about thr impending danger with China and the Tibet issue. If Sardar Patel was alive a lot of things must have been different with Tibet and Kashmir. \n\nThe recent CAA passed by the government was to mostly check illegal Muslim immigration from Bangladesh and Myanmar's Rohingyas. We have good relations with these two countries and ensure we have a friendly democratic government in place to check China's proximity with them. We must also up our ante against investment disguised as debts."<br />Author: 'OfficialDGISPR'<br />id: 'eo0y5g'<br />Flair :Serious</li><li>Title: 'Touring rural MP right now and all the people i have met here till now were literally shaking...'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Bekchod'<br />id: 'eo0hxt'<br />Flair :Shitpost</li><li>Title: 'What are your views on Reservation?'<br />Body: "* Do you think caste-based reservations must be removed because it has harmed more people than it has helped?\n\n* Do you think caste-based reservations must be removed because casteism still persists, meaning that reservations have failed to fulfil the purpose for which they were introduced?\n\n* Do you think caste-based reservations should only be there for the poorest members of backward communities?\n\n* Do you think reservations shouldn't be caste based but should be only for people from poor families whether Brahmin or Dalit?\n\n* Do you think there should be no reservations or quotas but a scholarship/fee-waiver for those who are poor?\n\n\nFurther,\n\n* How do you think casteism can be eradicated?\n\n* Should the government promote inter-caste marriage?"<br />Author: '_Yuyutsu_'<br />id: 'enz7ra'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'Can someone please explain what’s going on with Rajdeep Sardes-droh-ai and some sting ops recently?'<br />Body: 'Being a non-hindi speaker am not able to find complete info on whats going on but I’ve been hearing Rajdeep’s and Rahul’s name doing the circles...pls explain?'<br />Author: 'hashirama15'<br />id: 'enyij2'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'If you support the whole anti-CAA cabal you are one of:'<br />Body: 'A.

The left has now been reduced to a mockery even in societies such as China and Russia which earlier were staunch communists. There is a new pattern emerging across the globe of nationalistic government with the people voting conservative governments to power in countaries likes India, USA, UK, Brazil, Israel and many more. This is a signal that the world has left behind the old pattern and is steadily moving towards a multilatralism and multipolarism with new players emerging and each having something fresh to offer on the table. But one thing is clear from the mandate of the people about what these countaries have to offer culturally and that reflects in the pattern of governments getting elected. We cannot emphasise the need of instituitions such as UNO and EU enough but slowly they are losing their importance and a new world order is emerging before it will rearrange the existing order in place. And that order is of, cultural nationalism. The world wants to go back to its culture, fortify it before it could move towards the direction of a world government. \n\nCultural nationalism comes to India naturally, before the transfer of power by Britain in 1947 for India to become a modern state, it has been one of the most ancient, infact the most ancient and culturally rich civiliazational state out there. India's history of for foreign occupation by Islamic invaders maybe have its own cultural implications in various fields such as architecture, cuisine, literature, clothes etc but its predecessor Hindutva culture outweighs the foreign occupation to the extent that it seems minuscule to the magnaminty of the thousands years old society. \n\nThere has been a recent shift in India's society by the election of a government with roots in the Hindutva movement. There have been some voices of dissent which are part of a healthy democracy but the worldwide pattern says something else and India's mindset is well in accordance with it. The global narrative is shifting towards nationalism before globalism. With UK leaving the EU for its own reasons, China undoing the wrongs of cultural revolution and US taking a stepback from world stage to look at its own affairs such as its Southern borders. India is on the same page but rather has always been a forerunner in the same due to the foundations set by its sages. There has almost been a uninamious voice of the world against the iconoclastic Islamic radicalisation which advotes an enforcement of Arabic culture across the foreign lands. It resembles world's rejection of the global communist awakening. Similarly, the world is rejecting the Ummah, including the Muslim world with new power faction coming up within itself. Ummah was always a facade with each Islamic country fighting with the other and pursing its own national identity. In this scenario, India is on a crossroad of an interesting phenomenon with its historic wrong of partition, article 370 amd unresolved boundary with its neighbours. \n\nComing to the modern Indian state, the government has taken a slew of steps such as Article 370 and Ram Mandir which ensure to safeguard India's cultural interests."<br />Author: 'OfficialDGISPR'<br />id: 'enpemf'<br />Flair :Serious</li><li>Title: 'Cultural Nationalism of India is in sync with Global Narrative (OC)'<br />Body: "The world has rejected the KGB-run United Nation Organization and the global communist awakening.

This is a signal that the world has left behind the old pattern and is steadily moving towards a multilatralism and multipolarism with new players emerging and each having something fresh to offer on the table. But one thing is clear from the mandate of the people about what these countaries have to offer culturally and that reflects in the pattern of governments getting elected. We cannot emphasise the need of instituitions such as UNO and EU enough but slowly they are losing their importance and a new world order is emerging before it will rearrange the existing order in place. And that order is of, cultural nationalism. The world wants to go back to its culture, fortify it before it could move towards the direction of a world government. \n\nCultural nationalism comes to India naturally, before the transfer of power by Britain in 1947 for India to become a modern state, it has been one of the most ancient, infact the most ancient and culturally rich civiliazational state out there. India's history of for foreign occupation by Islamic invaders maybe have its own cultural implications in various fields such as architecture, cuisine, literature, clothes etc but its predecessor Hindutva culture outweighs the foreign occupation to the extent that it seems minuscule to the magnaminty of the thousands years old society. \n\nThere has been a recent shift in India's society by the election of a government with roots in the Hindutva movement. There have been some voices of dissent which are part of a healthy democracy but the worldwide pattern says something else and India's mindset is well in accordance with it. The global narrative is shifting towards nationalism before globalism. With UK leaving the EU for its own reasons, China undoing the wrongs of cultural revolution and US taking a stepback from world stage to look at its own affairs such as its Southern borders. India is on the same page but rather has always been a forerunner in the same due to the foundations set by its sages. There has almost been a uninamious voice of the world against the iconoclastic Islamic radicalisation which advotes an enforcement of Arabic culture across the foreign lands. It resembles world's rejection of the global communist awakening. Similarly, the world is rejecting the Ummah, including the Muslim world with new power faction coming up within itself. Ummah was always a facade with each Islamic country fighting with the other and pursing its own national identity. In this scenario, India is on a crossroad of an interesting phenomenon with its historic wrong of partition, article 370 amd unresolved boundary with its neighbours. \n\nComing to the modern Indian state, the government has taken a slew of steps such as Article 370 and Ram Mandir which ensure to safeguard India's cultural interest."<br />Author: 'OfficialDGISPR'<br />id: 'enpbtr'<br />Flair :Serious</li><li>Title: 'We are now a family of 7000 bakchods!'<br />Body: '***Congratulations Bhratas and Bhaginis!***\n\n#Bakchodi Parmo Dharma'<br />Author: 'randy-laheyson'<br />id: 'ennwtd'<br />Flair :Bakchod News</li><li>Title: 'What is the situation now on Assam?'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Styeyr'<br />id: 'enntld'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'r/Chodi about to reach 6969 members'<br />Body: 'So prod.'<br />Author: 'sasta_Shashi_Tharoor'<br />id: 'enlgf0'<br />Flair :Bakchod News</li><li>Title: 'HINDUTVA: SUNDAY DISCUSSION THREAD (SERIOUS)'<br />Body: "*What is Hindutva?* \n\nVeer Savarkar explores this topic in his book 'Hindutva' in a great detail and I will try to explain it briefly as I could. So, according to Hindutva, India is not something created in 1947 with an English speech by Nehru; but it is a milleniums year old ancient country. Savarkar discusses the etymology for the name of the country, starting with earliest mention of river Sindhu mentioned in one of world's most ancient scriptures Vedas to the degeneration of Sanskrit to Prakrit and citing foreign Zorastrain sources to being called Hindustan. The word India is also Greko-Romanisation of word Sindhu/Hindu. \n\nHe explores who are people of India? The mulanivasis, the dalits or the migrants, Aryans? He says all of them. He rejects the name Aryavrata, or Bharat named after a partiarch as the geopolitical landmass of India had already been inhabited by sapiens before the Aryan migrations and sticks to the dictum 'Hindu' for everyone as derived from the name of the river Indus. He goes on the explore the landscape of India and he concludes it as the landmass between the two Sindhus (Indus and Brahamputra due to their closeness of their origin and Indian penensula and its surrounding areas. \n\nNext, he discusses the various sects and castes indigenius to the development of India such as Sanatanis, Buddhists, Jains, Dalits etc until the reactivity of people to Mohemmedan invasions who become Sikhs. According to him, all are Hindus due to geo-cultural identity. Later, he discusses the nationality and arrives at 3 a mix of 3 cases: A: A person born in India. B. A person whose holy land is India (many foreigners who become hindus) C: A person whose fatherland is India. Now, let's look at the proposition C in detail. There are some religions such as Christianity and Islam and their father land is in Middle East. Savarkar rightly raises the question that they need to prove their loyalty and it has become even more important after the anti-national protests against CAA. We can give them a temporary benifit of doubt. Lastly, he also discusses the common language. So, Hindi as we all know is the common language of Indian subcontinent. We can speak in Hindu with a Nepali to a Southerner, no matter how much he can deny after his Periarian language politics. He concludes with describing Indians or Hindus as a racial and ethnic identity which no matter how much Pakistanis to South Indians have tried to oppose but cannot escape! \n\nI cannot stress this enough, Savarkar's views about the caste system that inter-caste marriages were the norm since the Vedic period and even know caste mixing is rampant but what more important is that we are all Hindus. \n\nPlease correct and forgive me if I'm wrong. Your suggestions, opinions and views are welcome. Please be patient in your speech.

But my sister was a cunt as to what's happening around in the country because I've been extremely pro congress, and she knows I went to a lot of protests and I was being paid a good ₹20 Pakistani Rupees which is almost double than the early offer of ₹10 INR.\n\nSo I tell her about CAA, NRC, NPR and all the hindutva bullshit BJP leaders have been spewing since they got a brain cell.\nTold her facts about the current state of economy, unemployment, women safety etc. Our parents always keep telling us that it's important to focus on studies because they know I am mentally retard and leave the politics for the old. But she understood that if we don't fight for ourselves no one will. Also told her how important it is to elect Marxist people and how powerful we as citizens still are, by giving her the example of genius Kejriwal and all the good shit he's done in Delhi and the oscar winning odd even rule is a must mention. \n\nAnd imo this is the only way we can deal with the current regime. I have earned ₹6969 PKR and made contacts with the professional general of Pakistani army.

So I have decided to make a long post on the same for those of you interested to read:\n\nThe pattern of protests is not something new. It is something called Ideological Subversion. It has been used my many countries over the years like US, China, Russia, Pakistan etc. Yuri Bezmenov an ex-KGB agent who worked in USSR ambessy infilterated to CIA desrcibes in detail in this [video](https://youtu.be/pgCnpCBORyM).\n\nBasically, it started with invitations sent out to intellectuals, actors, writers, members of civil society to USSR. A lot of them were leftists, so they had no trouble making them an agent. Rest of them were blackmailed. Many professors from DU, JNU etc when to USSR, later when they came back they indoctrinated left-leaning students, many of whom later became beaurocrats, diplomats etc. Lenin used to describe them as 'useful idiots', who were knowingly or unknowingly helping in their cause.\n\nYou can see its extent that a patriotic PM Lal Bahadur Shastri was poisoned in USSR and even Indira Gandhi was a victim of it in the movie *Tashkent Files*. And how the words 'Socialist and Secular' were added in the holy preable of Indian Constitution at mid-night during emergency to suit an agenda.\n\nUSSR collapsed, but its ghost of global communist uprising still remains. These remanents of ideological subversion were picked up the West, China and Pakistan, alongside waging a proxy war on India on many fronts such as Kashmir and Red Corridor. Here is a detailed [article](http://www.indiandefencereview.com/news/caa-pakistan-and-china-engineered-the-protests/) by Col. RSN Singh recently published. \n\nThere's a very interesting phenomenon used by the left. They kill the Jaichands before the Prithvirajas. The killings of Urban Naxal Gauri Lankesh and Rationalist Dabolkar were blamed on fringe Hindu outfits were in reality killed by Maoists over some mismanagement of funds. Whenever a useful idiot serves their purpose, their masters execute them. Another example of how even a martyr like Hemant Karkare was dragged into this dirty game by none other than Digvijay Singh who tried to malign two pillars of strength of India, i.e. Hindus and the Army by wrongly framing Sadhvi Pragya and Colonel Purohit over Malegaon blasts which were actually conducted by SIMI. RVS Mani, an insider, describes it in his book Bhagwa Atankwad or Hindu Terror. We have all know Digvijay's fondness for his master Osama and Hafiz Saheb. Even Sonia and Rahul are anti-nationals who work on the direct orders of the Church, since the day this woman came to India, it has lost 2 PMs, 2 ministers (Scindia and Pilot seniors) and members of Vadra family all died under mysterious circumstances. NAC under UPA was nothing but a hotbed of useful idiots. We also know how Junior Scindias and Pilots are given small roles in their parties to save one product of dynastic rule i.e. Pappu. Many of whom such as Medha Patkar, Arundhati Roy, who oppose development projects such as Narmada Dam projects are given benifits and people such as Binayak Sen who fuel Maoist insurgency in India's most resource rich areas. Not forget to mention pressitutes/pidis like S Varadrajan, Rajdeep Sardesai and whole of NDTV crew.\n\nNow the present situation of JNU. A attack by the leftist goons on their own student wing relects their agenda. Many useful idiots like Swara Bhaskar, Anurag Kashyap, now Deepika have come out to fuel their agenda. The former ambassador of Pakistan, Abdul Bashir had laid down the foundations of these protests during his tenure. The present protests in institutes like JNU, Jamia, AMU, Jadhavpur, Osmania etc are nothing but all funded by China, Pakistan and some US think tanks who have an ideological position. Consent is being manufactured (see documentary by Noam Chomsky) using a network of protests, media etc against the government policies such as CAA, 370, Triple Talak etc. That even the people who had earlier voted for BJP have started to question the policy of this government. They have only one agenda i.e. Breaking India, they have only one vested interest a weak India to be ruled and a profit to be made. \n\nIndia has finally woken up from its geopolitical slumber by electing a nationalist government twice and they cannot stand their invisible shadow empire getting crumbuled and have started out their anti-India activities in full swing.
