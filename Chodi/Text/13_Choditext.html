<li>Title: 'Moment of sudden pride towards north Indian Bharateey bhratas. Let me explain a perspective I realised on the Indian perception of Aryan Invasion Theory....'<br />Body: 'Every society has been trying to attach themselves to a society they perceive as greater than them. Europeans associate with Greeks and Romans even though a lot of them aren\'t, Indian subcontinental Múslíms associate themselves with Arabs, Mongols (Khans), Turks, Iranians, Afghans (and what not) although none of them purely are, Chinese associate with Hans although most were just peasants and so on. Northern Indians when they were at their worst, beaten and trashed for hundreds of years, they were given one such rope to a high lineage- the "great" Aryans. One would have expected from them to immediately latch on and say yes, we are indeed descendants of that great conquering bloodline of Europeans (who were at the time seen as rich civilised nations).  But for some reason that poor and frail defeated northern society refused to buy into the attractive offer of racial pride and great knowledgeable lineage. The propagandists must\'ve been confused as to how come these brown men not want to associate with us, the great strong civilised white Europeans? This in my eyes shows the depth of a massive underground current of brotherhood in the Indian society, for which they said No sir, we are good with status of our forefathers as they were. This also shows the foolishness of the Dravidian movement, since those they call oppressive conquering Aryans are denying that they won anything. Whom the Dravidians call racists have stomped their feet deep and said NO, our fathers are one and we are brothers, we aren\'t the descendents of some great white conquerers, we are the same little brown men as you. To this day, that resistance towards de-Indianising Indians continues with Indians taking onto themselves the task of proving that they did not descend from some fabled supreme race but are just plain original Indians. A moment of relief for me, bhratas, to know that our people value integrity more than racial pride, lineage pride and supremacy, on this social value all other cultures I know have failed but us.

<li>Title: 'My ideal Dictator'<br />Body: "Make me the PM. Here are the things I would do\nDont dovnvote before reading\n\n1. Give Kashmir to pak. You heard that right . But with a treaty that any further escalation , we would nuke you.\n\n2. Declare India a Dharmic rashtra , so provide all incentives for population exchange . Incase you want to remain in India ,you will have to convert to any Dharmic religion.\n\n3.Increase nuclear arsenal manyfold and at the same time cut down heavily on military so that it can be diverted to nations growth.\n\n4. If above works out fine , create a robust SAARC alliance with a free Trade agreement.\n\n5. Strict population control. \n\n6. Impose multiple language policy on education cos that will be the only diverging factor for our nation.\n\n7.Compulsory military service and NCC activities. \n Strict focus on school children to be disciplined.\n\n8.Complete prohibition of alcohol, drugs , cigarettes.\n\n9. Police to be a central subject , so that it is not misused.\n\n10. Politicians to have mandatory graduation to be eligible for elections.\n\n11. Death penalty for rapes, caste violence, murders, corruption that directly impacts commoners.\n\n12. Judiciary to be overhauled. Lie detection, truth serums and all modern tools be allowed to establish crimes.\n\nIf I manage to achieve the above ,here would be the next set of steps:\n\n1. Reform agriculture . Import grains from other countries . Grow only cash crops for export.\n\n2.Incentivize scientific thinking. Money saved from above could be used to build world class research centres.\n\n3.Every job ,be it public or private have minimum standard wage and compulsory appraisals. No one can slack off.\n\n4. Use human resource to establish massive infrastructure.  Tax collection be very strict \n\n5.Focus on skilling everyone. Be it plumber, carpentar,machine operator, welder etc so as to enable job creation.\n\n6.Education be completely skill based . For instance technical courses should have 70:30 waightage of practical skill to theoretical understanding.\n\nCourses such as humanities should be more introspective. Rather than rote learning ,it's modern day implications should be the focus.\n\n7. Revival of ancient Indian teachings but not blindly but with thorough scientific vigour.\n\nI have a 1000 more ideas but will anyone listen?"<br />Author: 'trumptyonawall'<br />id: 'mx2r7h'<br />Flair :Wholesome Bakchodi :danklaugh:</li>

Since then a lot of precautions, initiatives and counter measures have been taken by the govt as well as the people. Yet future remains uncertain as to when this crisis will come to an end. From the very beginning global observers from across the world had predicted a deep crisis in India due to the pandemic . And eventually but gradually this is turning into a reality. \n\nBut what if the pandemic stays for another year or two? Can people endure another prolonged lockdown? \n\nIt is said that when death looms 24/7 above a person, he becomes immune to the fear of death.

<li>Title: 'An analysis of what India has/ has not done during COVID.'<br />Body: "Tl; dr; centre, states, people have all messed up.\nThis might be a long post, please bear with me. \nWe are seeing sickening, heartbreaking scenes from various cities. People are dying a painful death. Doctors are pleading with people to stay indoors, pleading for oxygen supply in their hospitals. We are all bickering about Modi, Uddhav, Kejriwal, Yogi, who's done what and what not.\n\nBut from what I see a huge blame lies with the centre. They got complacent after the first wave came down and vaccination started. Did they assume that vaccination would fix things? How long will it take vaccinate more than 60% population? \n\n Centre was always in the backfoot. They allowed opponents and lobby groups to go against COVAXIN, which lead to vaccine hesitancy. People are still saying COVAXIN isn't safe and I don't say a messaging from the govt to counter this. During polio vaccination and swach bharath, people were a catalyst for change. Govt has to clamp down hard against vaccine hesitancy and improve awareness amongst the masses. \n\n Centre must have asked states to strictly enforce mask wearing and sanitation. Not implementing centre directives is reason enough to put president's rule but half of the states are ruled by bjp itself. States have been found lacking in enforcing COVID protocols, maybe the had done something to improve capacity but if huge population becomes sick, capacity will get stretched fast. So Covid deniers, non mask wearers, have all lead to booming of cases and stretching of whatever capacity states had.  \n\nCentre cannot be bickering with opposition on matter of rallies. Even if opposition is doing them, modi-shah shouldn't be doing rallies. Modi is the leader of the nation, he has to be in Delhi to get us over this mess. If people including supporters are questioning, it's because they know that leader can do whatever it takes to find solutions. \n\nStates have responsibility over health. No state can abdicate that responsibility. Capacity addition- isolation centres, hospitals, more beds, oxygen supply, strengthen local governments\n- should have been the priority last year. The urge to resort to lockdown shows that this is the only armoury available to do anything. I will go easy on delhi because a large population from other states also rely on delhi hospitals. But Maharashtra, the fuck up since first wave has been unbelievable, needless to say, migrant exodus back will affect UP, Bihar badly.  \n\nThe fixing of accountability, which is a common thread to the all the above points. We need to fix accountability at centre and state level because both haven't done enough to prevent the second wave.  Centre should have continued to keep vigil, direct states to do more tests, enforcing COVID standards. States should have proactively done more tests, trace, isolate, strengthen Covid protocols, sensitise population. \n\nLastly, people need to mask up, sanitise and avoid crowds unless important. Everyone has to urge our family and friends to take the vaccines.  Large section of the population don't have the fortune to isolate like so many of us do. The section of population that can stay home, should do so, otherwise we are looking at another lockdown, economic crisis, starvation, death. We're all in this fight together. \n\nI have not included lots of subjects- local self govt, gst payments, financing methods for states, kumbh, farmers protests, not even the positive side of first wave. \nThankyou for reading."<br />Author: 'upscaspi'<br />id: 'mw9oxh'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Why Covid cases are so low in Gujarat?'<br />Body: 'It was February 27,2002 when Shri Modiji were CM of Gujarat. He arranged a meeting with senior police officers and home department officials to brainstorm about possible Chinese attack on the country in the future. While the consensus was on a nuclear strike by China, Modiji with his brilliant mind suggested that the attack can be in the form of a pandemic. This is the same meeting that some anti national officers like Sanjiv Bhatt are alleging that Modiji called in for inciting riots. While in reality Modiji were preparing for a possible attack on the country. The meeting was top secret and hence they are denying it ever happened.\n\nWell, to the point, In this meeting, a Gujarati origin NASA scientist named Dr Chunilal Tikamdas Yagnik was present. He suggested a copper radiating tower, the height of Eiffel tower to be installed in the middle of Gujarat. Everyone knows how effective copper is to kill the the virus. Dr Chu.Ti. Yagnik had a Ph.D from Gujarat University in Entire Rare Earth Metal Filtration Using Cow Dung. He had devised a plan to decontaminate the state of Gujarat using a copper emitting tower built using some Rare Earth materials produced in China itself. But there was a problem. If Modiji asked China to supply this Rare Earth material for such a tower, China will never allow it. Also we needed Solar technology from USA and Germany for emitting this copper using a solar operated reactor. This technology was procured by Adani Greens Ltd, a subsidiary company that time was part of Adani Enterprise. They supported the government in this noble cause to save Gujarat from future pandemic caused by China and incompetence of the Gandhi family. The question of buying Rare Earth material from China was still open. The next day, amid rising violence by the peaceful community, Modiji thought of an idea of building a copper statue at the middle of Gujarat near sardar sarovar dam, and hide this copper emitting technology inside it. This one idea of the great man opened the doors for us to buy copper and other Rare Earth materials from China. In the years to come, Gujarat built this ramban yantra, installed on the banks of Narmada as the Statue of Unity. Fast forward to 2020, this work of the genius is saving millions of lives in Gujarat from covid. I thank the god for taking birth on the lands of vadnagar, in the form of Narendra Damodardas Modi, to save millions of lives of Gujaratis.

<li>Title: 'Right-wing media seriously needs to work otherwise an entire generation will be spoilt with wokeness'<br />Body: 'Let me explain.\n\nI believe most of the young educated English-speaking folks in India tend to use social media where their political beliefs are formed. There is no discussion, no discourse, just spoonfeeding of news and ideologies from the content they follow and consume. Moreover, social media just repeats the type of content you show interest in at least once, and then you are into the rabbit hole or an echo chamber of the same school of thoughts.\n\nOn the other side, this is clearly a "war of narratives". The social media narrative is largely controlled by media houses who (not sure about left-leaning but definitely against a single political party) and can go at any length or any level of selectivity just to put a single political party in a bad light.\n\nRecently, Instagram accounts like [The Tatva](https://www.instagram.com/thetatvaindia/?hl=en), [The Pulse](https://www.instagram.com/thepulseindia/?hl=en), [redpillmeplease](https://www.instagram.com/redpillmeplease/) are some of the places trying to do some work. \n\nObv we have Swarajya and OPIndia, but seriously think they need to do a lot more work in SEO and being out there on social media. Sorry to say, but news article does not work in present days. People mostly consume the headline they read on twitter, Instagram stories, or posts.\n\nThis is sad that an entire generation is being trained to form an opinion not based on deep research and analysis but based on few images, few statements and what-masses-think (as this is what becomes most shared on social media). It\'s sad, but it\'s the reality and we have to evolve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat we should do instead?\n\nWe should have a proper presence on Twitter and Instagram and same sure we share a counter to every BS these spoilt media houses are doing. For me personally, most of my counters to any BS from left-leaning-woke media comes from the replies to the tweets they share, and that is the place I get the irony and the argument as to why their narrative makes no sense.\n\nI\'d be really happy if there\'s some thread just below of such BS news (like r/IndiaRWResources) so that other can read a dense content in 2-3 tweets and be aware of the. bias being presented to them.'<br />Author: 'duniyamadarchodhai'<br />id: 'mw0u31'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
<li>Title: 'Lob Jhaddd'<br />Body: "I'm not speaking for everyone on the sub, but mostly men in this sub (and Hindu men in general) have a strange inferiority complex that Bslim men are more attractive and that's the reason of love Jihad. All I want to say to these Hindu men: Abe Gadhe ho kya be? There are some arguments that Bslim men are more attractive because of their genes. Saalon ancestry test karwa lo, tumhare andar Irish/Japanese genome mil jayega magar saalon ke andar Arab ya Turkey ka ek molecule nahin milega. Secondly, physical good looks play an important role in arrange marriage but at least for girls, when the question is of infatuation/crush, it's entirely independent of physical appearance but more about the attitude. Even the TV or movie actors we crush on,. it's more dependent on the fictional characters they play (Confession time: I have a crush on a Bslim TV actor but I never found him handsome earlier). On one hand you say girls run after money yet how would you explain how puncturewallahs and fruitsellers persuade educated girls to elope with them? And to the question girls prefer Muslim men because they are more masculine then sabse zyada Indian ladkiyan paglayi hui hain Kpop stars and Kdrama actors and in my limited knowledge, Hindu boys are at least more masculine than them. Problem is these M guys have been trained in Foundation course of grooming girls since their teenage. Jab ek banda saalon taiyyari karke exam dega and aap bina course tak jane exam doge to chahe aap kitne talented ho, usse jeet nahin paoge. Bslim ladkiyan Burke me rehkar bhi patthar se itna sateek nishaana laga leti hain and Hindu Ladkiyan to dhang se patthar utha bhi nahin payengi. The reason is not genome difference but because Hindu girls didn't learn the art of pelting stones. Unless Hindus cut open the web of inferiority complex, no one can prevent love Jihad.

According to news reports, the UK, Canada, and the European Union are among those who have overbooked vaccines, more than required by their populations.\n\nThus vaccine production in India, which banks on raw materials from countries like the US, takes a hit.

This would mean doses are accessible and affordable to low- and middle-income nations.

<li>Title: 'Strengths of Islam i have observed'<br />Body: "Hindus are too emotional when looking at Islam and seem to be unable to look at it objectively. On one hand Liberal self hating hindus will praise Islam just because it is positioned in India as opposing Hindus. And on the other hand Raita wingers and nationalist types are also emotional about Islam and are unable to look at Islam and do a competitor analysis and appreciate its strengths.\n\nIn business successful companies do not spend time crying about the historical atrocities of their competitors and/or their historic losses to these competitors. They conduct a competitor analysis and see what the strengths and weaknesses of their competitor are. Based on the information derived the company will re-evaluate their strategy. Sometimes they will even adopt some of the practices of the competitor, which is necessary to stay in business. \n\nTo give some context I am an 'ABCD' but I am not a liberal chut. Since I do not reside in India I am not emotionally invested in the Muslim/Hindu divide. I try to be as objective as possible but I also may have some biases. My post will be very brief and here i will describe what I believe some of the strengths are of Islam and/or behavior of Muslims I have observed. This is not a competitor analysis since I dont have the time to do so nor am I knowledgable enough on Islam to give it its full due. \n\nStrength 1: Tawheed. The Islamic concept of the oneness of God is very valuable. I am not advocating for Abrahmic monotheism but I think it is far superior to explicit polytheism which is what a large plurality/majority (not all) of Hindus follow. Polytheism and monotheism are not the only two religious systems. There is Monism which is found in Advaita. There is also Panentheism found in Sikhism and multiple hindu sects. All of these systems of belief I find are superior to explicit polytheism. In fact the Sanskrit concept of *Aikyam*, stresses the oneness of the divine and is millenia older than Abrahmic faith. The oness of God is much more simple to understand and less confusing for the average person to understand. One divinity can also serve to unite people more efficently. I also believe avatars is a slipperly slope that causes degeneration. To illustrate this example I will use Christianity as an example and how the deification of Jesus to the status of a God degenerated that religion. When Christians elevated jesus to the status of God/part of god/whatever term you want to use they prescribed jesus characteristics to God. No offense to Jesus he has many positive qualities but he is also passive, too forgiving, and accepting of degeneracy to a degree ( defending prostitutes, etc.) You see now in the west in Christianity is just jesus fixated. THey say Jesus died for your sins. So westerners use this as a free pass to just sin and not care. They deified jesus and only focussed on the aspects of God that Jesus represented forgiveness/passive nature. Islam is concise and easy to understand for their followers wheras different strains of Hindu dharma is not. Most Hindus do rituals without knowing the reason behind these rituals or they read puranas without knowing the meaning or metaphors behing the stories. THis creates stupid people who cannot defend their religion when attacked. I personally dislike the Puranas since they have confused the masses which was the opposite of their intention. The westernersand abrahmics  have the tradition of apologetics due their nature as missionary religions. There followers understand their traditions better although not great. \n\n2. Islam is political in nature. Islam has laws, rules and regulations tied into its theology. Wheras hindus explicitly do not. Theology and politics should not be separate. Our morals come from theology. Islam combines these 2 in a way that has been effective historically for meeting their goals. Islamic Jurisprudence is in tact wheras hindu law has been deciminated. Hindus basically follow British common law with no reverence for any dharmic concepts. \n\n Sure hindus have manu smriti, dharma shastras, etc. But hindus do not follow these. The Manu smriti has some great concepts but even Hindu  'right wingers' want to completely throw it due to liberals hating select translated passages of the text. I am not saying adopt the manusmriti but take some of the concepts from manusmriti that stand the test of time and put it into a new smriti for this age. Even the hindu rishis say that the Manusmriti is not fit for the age of Kali Yuga. But there are concepts in there that stand the test of time.\n\n3. Love Jih\\*\\* is a 3/4 myth 1/4 true. I will elaborate why I think its part myth part true. Love Ji\\*\\*d is a half- myth the fact of the matter is muslim dudes have better game, fitness, and social skills than your average Hindu guy. I see this in multiple countries. USA, Canada, UK, India, Malaysia,etc. Hindu dudes just suck at attracting women and when they see hindu women with Muslim men they complain like a loser. Growing up all the hindus were nerds wheras the muslim dudes played sports and their mosque had lots of sports competitions. Muslim dudes also didnt have social awkwardness. THese things just help make better more masculine men which women are attracted too. All of these countries I have been i observed the Muslims were just better equipped socially and exhibited more masculine characteristics. The only truth in Love Jih\\*\\* is that there are multiple cases of Muslim dudes lying about their religion to the women they are courting Lying is not good and lying should be condemned. But again I personally think its the fault of these girls and their fathers for just letting them out in the world unsupervised to be courted by guys the family does not know. Blaming Islam for the biological imperative all dudes have is stupid. Hindus would do the same if they were on the same lvl as Muslim dudes in the attraction game.\n\n4. Muslim Men are the last men  (barely) standing up against degeneracy in this world. (and some women). Yes there is a weird alliance in the west between western born 'muslim feminists' and the liberals. But when I objectively look at all groups in the world it appears that Muslims have the highest proportion of both men and women standing up against western degeneracy. Muslims are unashamed to be patriarchal. Patriarchy makes strong civilizations. Hindu nationalists arnt real right wingers imo. All hindu nationalists do is SIMP for westerners and say look at us we are against the mudslims too. I see Hindu nationalists championing feminism which Is beyond stupid.  I understand that certain Muslim dynasties like the Mughals have committed terrible attrocities against people in the subcontinent. But the strongest enemy right now is modernist western values. These values are opposed to 90+% of traditional cultures out there. The fact that Muslims are resisting these more efficiently has made me grow an appreciation for them."<br />Author: 'ginobili6'<br />id: 'mvt2s2'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Just had a realization'<br />Body: 'This is long post please be patient\n\nAs i was browsing through againsthinduphobia subreddit, i observed that some stories are altogether missing like discovery of mass grave of Rohingya Hindus, Delhi riots attack on Hindus and Christians attack on temples in Andhra(yes one story was covered but approx. 200 attacks happened in last year alone ). This lead me to research all  attacks on Hindus in recent years, whether it was  forced conversion and rape of Hindus in Pakistan or destruction of temples in Bangladesh, not a single politician in world has raised concern in global forum (yes even our own country\'s "Hindu nationalistic party ").only single politician in entire world has raised concerned that was Tulsi  gabbard. So i was discussing the same with some people about the same in my state (Andhra ),  when i asked why are you voting for the guy who was destroying temples, their response was temples are temples but he is giving us the most cash. This was not a unique experience I have seen Dalit Christians mocking Dalit Hindus, even openly discriminating against them .Hell even CD CBI ADGP(Andhra ) called for culling of Hindus, another top IPS officer in Telangana openly called to eliminate false idol worshippers. Funny thing is no one seems to give a shit. Hell i am tired of arguing with people, fuck it i can be either be tired and frustrated  or energetic and frustrated , I am choosing the second one.\n\nSo my realization was how situation in Kashmir went total balls up ,  it was not the intelligence of ISI or competence of Islamic terrorists, it was just that we don\'t just give a shit about other Hindus or even our temples ,if 99 people mass grave  of another religion(Rohingya Hindus ) was found or were discriminated against as Hindus are in  Pakistan  and Bangladesh ,this could have been international news but because its Hindus we can\'t even break top news in a country with 80% Hindus.'<br />Author: 'logically_dumbguy'<br />id: 'mvnuyh'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>
<li>Title: 'Some Redpills for some extremists larping here who might get this sub banned'<br />Body: "1. Muslims are the first victims of Islam. Majority of Indian Muslims in India had Hindu ancestors who were converted by the sword, lies etc.\n2. There are approx. 200 million Muslims in India. Calls to genocide all of them or putting them in concentration camps is inhumane and impractical. Poisoning your mind with such evil ideas will only affect your mental and physical health and turn you into the person you're fighting against.\n3. The fight is against Islam not Muslims. Each Hindu converted to Islam isn't an ally lost but an adversary gained. Collecting and imparting knowledge about Hinduism, Islam and Christianity to your friends and families goes a long way to help them see the true picture and remain in the dharmic fold.\n4. Present Muslims don't have any role in the atrocities committed against Hindus by Muslims in the past. The Christian Portuguese killed and tortured a lots of Hindus in goa. Why isn't there a similar outrage against Indian Christians? They aren't responsible for past crimes.\n5. The reason there are so many Hindu atheists right now is because there are no gurukuls or sanskrit scholars left to retain them in the dharmic fold. If they don't know their scriptures or history they would cease to be hindus.\n6. All enemies aren't only external but also internal. These victims of macaulayism should be opposed vehemently.\n7. Don't support anyone blindlessly. BJP and RSS have been known to backtrack on hindu causes. Support a party which will serve you best. \n\nI will now highlight the goals I think one should strive towards for the benefit of himself and those around him in the long run:\n\n1. Gain knowledge of your History and scriptures. Arming yourself ideologically is what every person here should strive towards.\n2. Cut funding to Christian and Muslim schools or religious places by the government and implement UCC. This is a secular country.\n3. Gain knowledge of what you're at arms against. Reading scriptures of Islam, Christianity and Communism will help you understand how the other side thinks and plan an ideological defense.\n4. Vote in every election. Your vote is your biggest power as a citizen. Muslims use their votebank to make all political parties appease them. Make your votebank have enough power that every political party stops appeasing Muslims.\n5. Remove the places of worship act. Every masjid built on a temple should be removed."<br />Author: 'horrorlover2'<br />id: 'mvnt0q'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

And every government including BJP keeps endorsing such though. When Govt need Airlines, Hijack Tata Airlines and make it Indian Airlines. When government wanted a telecom company, they hijacked Reliance resources and made BSNL. But wasn't able to run any of those things. Many such incidents happened since the independence and failed miserably. Any why shouldn't it fail, A government has conflict of interest in running a company, they can't fire bad management, they can't price it at sustainable level because they interest is to win election.\n\nNow Current Modi govt arrogantly monopolised vaccination supply that I will give vaccine to everyone for free. And nobody questioned it. (our stupid opposition party and media who will criticize Modi for all wrong reasons but never for a sensible reason).\n\nWhy do everyone have to get vaccine from Central govt only? Why can't people who can afford get it from private hospitals. Who is stopping govt to give it for free, but atleast they could have allowed companies to sell to private institutions. But what is logic against arrogance.\n\nNow finally Modi did some course correction all opposition party are crying to go please go back to wrong way. We don't like to pay for anything. Why private company is earning profit. They are Modi friend.\n\nDude, private company is meant to make profit. I never imagined that Indian company will be able to make vaccine, but they did unimaginable. Otherwise most people are hoping that US or Russia will make it and we will get some bikh out of pity. But it didn't happen that way which was miraculous. Why so much hate for private institutions, if such attitude will continue why will not every Indian will open and do buisness in foreign land. Why even Indian company do research in risky works in which they can loose money but if they get success they can't earn. We will forever be underdeveloped, labour for advanced research doing countries.\n\nIf you want cheaper things from private companies please go forward and make some deal. It's perfectly okay, no need to do politics on it.\n\nTLDR: Rahul Gandhi Chutiya hai"<br />Author: 'FewSatisfaction1024'<br />id: 'mvk3j7'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

<li>Title: 'AURANGZEB: Book: Audrey Truschke'<br />Body: 'Anyone else read that despicable book "Aurangzeb" by Audrey Truschke. I was kind of intrigued by the social media storm surrounding her and her book. I felt she wrote with an agenda to rehabilitate Aurangzeb\'s image and defang the Hindutva revival predicated on past atrocities by Muslim rulers. I also felt she highlighted small slivers of Aurangzeb\'s life that would make him seem a little more agreeable. For example, she makes a huge deal of his continuance of a Hindu custom of being weighed in a commodity, known as the weighing ritual. This makes no sense. Like is this supposed to redeem him ? She also claims that an earlier historical portrayal of Aurangzeb by Jadunath Sarkar was unfair because he used the word crescent. Lol..Why is she considered a scholar.. Excerpt from the book *For Sarkar, Aurangzeb was a tragic figure. Moreover, in line with other colonial-era thinkers, Sarkar viewed Aurang-zeb  as  a  religious  zealot  (hence,  “the  Mughal  crescent”)  and  thought that his dedication to a specific sort of Islam spelled utter catastrophe for the empire.* \n\nIn order to fill pages in her useless book, she talks about Aurangzeb\'s love for mangoes...Lol...WHAT??\n\nWTF...Is this what passes as scholarly work in History ? \n\nAnother theme I feel she comes back to again and again in the book is that rulers used to use violence and desecration of temples as a political tool to supress revolts. There was no sense of loyalty among people for each other. She cites Shivaji\'s betrayal by a Hindu as proof of this. She presents it as a Way of the world argument.\n\nMy response is that if you can justify at a later date Muslim actions of temple desecration and forced conversion as a political tool, why can you not accept the Hindu\'s right to also use MoSqUe destruction as a political tool. Well, this is the way of our world. Accept it.\n\nAll in all, I thought the book was written to brainwash and bait Indians. Padhni hai to padh lo. Illegally download karlo LiBGeN par.

They are weak and cannot prepare food for themselves currently. \n\nMy natural response was - you can use Swiggy / Zomato. However she was not very comfortable in ordering from these websites since her parents prefer homemade food and she was not sure if ordering from restaurants for such prolonged period will be a good idea. Later, we managed to find her a guy from a Facebook group who catered to her demand. \n\nThis got me thinking, that with rise in COVID cases this exact situation must have been faced by so many people and there is a need for website from where you can order homecooked food from your neighbors. With the limited technical skills I have, I have created a website https://covidfood.in on shopify with a few apps and extensions. I am waiting for google maps api approval post which it should be functional. \n\nA simple website wherein you can list if you can provide food to anyone in your neighbourhood and get it delivered. We will not charge any commission and the buyer can pay directly to the seller once they receive the food. \n\nEven though I wanted to take up this task all by myself, I realized that I won’t be able to make amy significant impact working alone. \n\nSo I am here looking for someone (preferably from IT background to polish the website a bit) who can help me run this website so that we can help those in need.

Slept naked with young girls in his family to test his 'sexual' experiments\n2. Corrupted Hindu hymns and texts and insulted Hindu gods like Ram among other insults to the Hindu fold. \n3. Was racist in his early life towards black people. \n4. Started the non violence and appeasement trend which led to unwanted deaths and injury of thousands of Hindus in the country.\n5. Most of his non violence movements were failures. His methods had a very low success rate. His ideology wasn't successful.\n6. Was misogynistic towards his wife\n\nThe list can go on and on. I have almost zero knowledge of the British period of Indian history nor do I have the time or patience to go through the countless volumes of gandhi's writings. \n\nBut if people more competent than me are upto this task and come together to publish a booklet about all his faults from his life and his writings we can successfully remove the saintly status about him from this world. \n\nI'm sure there's a lot of objectionable things he would have penned down in his writings.

<li>Title: 'Had posted this on R/indiarwresources, thought you guys might like to look it into as well (OC)'<br />Body: 'We all know the background, so I will keep the introduction short. For those who don\'t know, Shastri Ji had signed the Tashkent peace treaty along with the President of Pakistan, Ayyub Khan, in Tashkent, Uzbekistan (then Russia) on 10th January, 1966, and officially ended the 1965 Indo-Pak war. Just a few hours later, he died of an alleged cardiac arrest on 11th January, some time around 1:30 AM. There were several suspicions, but no committee was set up, no investigation was done, and even a postmortem wasn\'t conducted. The very next day, he was cremated, with 1 million people attending the funeral, (some sources stating twice the number) crying on the great Man\'s fate. \n\nThis was suspicious due to several reasons. First of all, Shastri ji was a pretty healthy individual. He had survived two heart attacks before, but recovered fairly quickly. He was fit, and in a good mood on the fateful night. When his body arrived: His mother exclaimed, “Mera Bituwa ko zeher de diya rey!” (they poisoned my son!). His family has been alleging for over 55 years that he was poisoned. It was confirmed by observers that there were white spots on his head, which could have only happened through either poisons that affect the brain or snakebite. His body had turned black, contrary to the natural bluish colour that the body turns during a natural fatality in such cases. When the body arrived, it was soaked in blood and blood was continuously flowing from a cut under Shastri ji\'s head, behind his neck, acoording to bystanders and his family members. There are several reasons this death is mysterious. There were just two witnesses of the incident present on the scene, both of whom were killed in road accidents on different occasions.\n\nCIA:\n\nRobert Crowley, a retired CIA officer, the book "Conversations With The Crow”, alleged that the CIA was responsible for the death of Homi J Bhabha,( a renowned scientist that brought nuclear programming to India, and died in a plane blast just a few weeks after Shastri ji\'s death) as well as Lal Bahadur Shastri. He alleged that Homi J Bhabha had come too close to developing a nuclear bomb, because of the help of Shastri ji. To make the world a safer place, the CIA assassinated both of them. \n\nKGB:\n\nThe most renowned theory is that of the KGB\'s assassination of Shastri ji. The KGB was notorious for cutting out organs to remove traces of the poison used to assassinate people by it. This is a plausible theory, considering Shastri Ji\'s wound under the head. The death took place in Tashkent, which was Russian territory. Although Shastri was socialist himself, it can\'t be denied that he would never let any foreign power rule over India, which maybe the reason behind his death. \n\nINC:\n\nJust 10 years after the death of Lal Bahadur Shastri, the words, “Secularism and Socialism” were added to the Indian constitution under the 42nd Amendment by the Indira Gandhi government. In the book, “The World And The KGB: The world was going our way”, based on the best counterintelligence report in the world: the Mitrokhin Archives, a book written by Christopher Andrew, it was alleged that several politicians, media houses, and even the Prime Minister herself had been on KGB\'s payroll, and were bribed to spread socialism in India. At least 5-7 million roubles were personally delivered to the Prime Minister according to the book. It was also alleges that media houses were paid to spread Congress and Communist propaganda. The CPI was said to have been funded by the KGB in the book too, along with several other revelations being made.\n\nSeveral RTIs were filed by historian Anuj Dhar, and Veteran Journalist Kuldeep Naiyyar to declassify the files regarding Shastri ji\'s death and the CIA, but each was rejected citing danger to foreign relations.\n\nThe mystery still remains unsolved to this day. \n\nSources used: \n\n1. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.dailyo.in/user/1136/anujdhar&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi82YW8oorwAhU6zjgGHVfiBbwQFjAIegQIBRAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw24C5U-YVC6AFPHoyfFA51V\n\n2.\n\n“Your Prime Minister is Dead”- Book by Anuj Dhar\n\n3.\n\n“The Tashkent Files”- movie by Vivek Ranjan Agnihotri\n\n4.\n\n“Coversations with the crow”- a book based on an interview with Robert Crowley by Douglas\n\n1. \n\n“The World Was Going Our Way: The KGB and the World, The Mitrokhin Archives II” (Chapter 17 and 18)- book by Christopher Andrew.'<br />Author: 'pineapple_pizza1112'<br />id: 'mu3p6f'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

These are qualifications of the pure devotee for whom the Lord is most easily attainable.\xa0Bhakti-yoga\xa0is the system that the\xa0Gītā\xa0recommends above all others. Generally, the\xa0bhakti-yogīs\xa0are engaged in five different ways: \n1)\xa0śānta-bhakta,\xa0engaged in devotional service in neutrality; 2)\xa0dāsya-bhakta,\xa0engaged in devotional service as servant; 3)\xa0sākhya-bhakta,\xa0engaged as friend; 4)\xa0vātsalya-bhakta,\xa0engaged as parent; and 5)\xa0mādhurya-bhakta,\xa0engaged as conjugal lover of the Supreme Lord.\n\nMother Srimati Yashoda was eternally engaged as a Vatsalya bhakta and Srimati Radhika Parameshwari was in Madhurya Bhava. Arjuna was engaged in sakhya rasa, as a friend.\n\nAll of the three personalities are most dear to Bhagavan. There is no hierarchy. Yashoda, Radhika and Arjuna, three of them loved Krishna the most in different rasas. \n\nWhat Sadhuru said in that talk is absolutely abominable and complete distortion and should be called out as false.'<br />Author: 'nkdataster'<br />id: 'mu2kzq'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm 🕉️</li>

Although the app was designed for Parkinson's patients, it may also be beneficial to those trying to improve their gait and coordination, let that be stroke patients, Huntington's disease patients, and others. The app does so through audio cueing, which allows movement to be synchronized with sound. This rhythm allows patients to match their gait or movements with the rhythm. Our app has two different audio cueing rhythms: gravel and cueing beats. Gravel features a steady rhythm of the sound of walking on gravel, and cueing beats features a steady rhythm of the sound of beats. Both audio cueing rhythms have five different speed settings.\n\n[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/medicue/id1563252653](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/medicue/id1563252653) .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAndroid version coming out soon!"<br />Author: 'nbaruss0'<br />id: 'mtqg0i'<br />Flair :Wholesome Bakchodi :danklaugh:</li>

<li>Title: 'A History of Mughal-Rajput Relations between the early 16th and mid 17th centuries'<br />Body: '(People can find this text in my answer over at r/ AskHistorians as well)\n\n\nTo understand the history of Mughal-Rajput relations we must understand the history of three dynasties who would come to dominate the Northern part of the Indian subcontinent between the 16th, 17th and early 18th centuries. To begin with we must take a look at the Mughals.\n\nAt the time when Babur first contemplated the idea of invading India he had already conquered Kabul. Zahir-ud-din Mohammed Babur, was the eldest of Umar Sheikh Mirza, who was governor of Ferghana, which is a region in eastern Uzbekistan. Babur was by lineage the great-great grandson of Timur. Babur\'s early military career was full of frustrations. Born in 1483, he had assumed the Throne of his father at age 12, in the year 1494. He conquered Samarkand two years later, only to lose Fergana soon after. In his attempts to reconquer Fergana, he lost control of Samarkand. In 1501, his attempt to recapture both the regions failed when Muhammad Shaybani Khan the founder of the Shaybanid dynasty, defeated him. He conquered Kabul, in 1504, after having being driven away from his patrimony and homeland. He formed an alliance with the Safavid Shah Ismail I, to take parts of Turkestan as well as Samarkand itself only to lose them again to the Shaybanids.\n\nHence, he had decided to give up on the dreams of taking back Ferghana and Samarkand and set his eyes on North India. At the time he had only thought of conquering the Punjab region. A task he accomplished in his second campaign in 1525, after a short campaign in 1519. Thus, at this juncture, we the political situation in North India was ripe for conflict and power changes. In Punjab, Babur prepared for a march towards Delhi to take it and all the realms under the rule of the Lodi Dynasty from Ibrahim Lodi who was currently the sultan of the Delhi Sultanate, whose own relatives, Daulat Khan Lodi and Alauddin had invited Babur to invade the Delhi Sultanate. Under the Lodi Dynasty the Sultanate had lost most of its eastern and southern as well as western territories and Ibrahim ruled over merely the Upper Gangetic plains. Meanwhile, a third contender for power and perhaps bigger threat to Babur\'s rise was looming in the Rajputana, in the form of the Rajput Confederacy, which was the first of its kind since the reign of Prithviraj Chauhan. This Confederacy was formed under the auspicious leadership of Rana Sangram Singh, of House Sisodiya of Mewar which had risen in prestige and power at the cost of neighbouring Malwa and Gujurati Sultanates during the reign of Rana Sangram other wise known as Rana Sanga.\n\nThe following events are well known, Babur defeated the Lodis at Panipat and then faced the Rajputs at Khanwa in 1527. However after his victories at Chanderi and at Ghaghra, he soon died leaving the Empire to his son Humayun whose reign was turbulent and prospects uncertain until his son Akbar assumed the Throne.\n\nNow let us look at the Sisodias of Mewar. This house of Rajputs traces it\'s origins from the legendary Suryavnshi lineage. But while records to back up such claims are obviously questionable, the historical foundation of this dynasty lies in the rise of Rana Hammir Singh, the founder of the Sisodiya Cadet Branch of the Guhila dynasty. The Guhila dynasty was extinguished by Alauddin Khalji after he besieged and conquered Chittor in 1303, their capital. But Rana Hammir Singh had taken back Chittor and since then reclaimed control of the region and re-established the dynasty under its cadet branch of the Sisodias by 1326. Owing to the legendary exploits of their kings and being one of the few Hindu noble houses that had remained independent during the successive reigns of various dynasties at the helm of the Delhi Sultanate, the House of Mewar carried weight amongst Rajput nobility.\n\nApart from Rana Hammir Singh, two rulers in particular, Rana Kumbharna Singh (1433-1468) and his great grandson Rana Sangram Singh (1508-1528), had raised the prestige of the House of Mewar to astronomical heights by not only defeating neighbouring Sultanates in Gujurat, Nagaur, Delhi and Malwa, but infact under the reign of Rana Sangram, actually conquering Gujurat and Malwa. Therefore, by 1526, most Rajput states had formed a Confederacy under the leadership of Rana Sanga. Ofcourse, following his defeat the Confederacy fell apart and while the house of Mewar still held a high place on the Rajput and indeed the Indian sociopolitical stage, there would never again be such a untied political front offered by the Rajputs. \n\nIn terms of the motivations and objectives of the Confederacy, it could be said that the Confederacy was buoyed together towards the political wills of the Rana of Mewar. Rana Sanga had made a policy to attack and acquire the territories of his kingdom\'s old enemies such as the Sultanates of Delhi, Gujurat, Nagaur and Malwa, and at the same time remove any traces of Turkic or Afghan dominion in North India. Therefore, it would be safe to say that had Babur not invaded Delhi and taken the Upper Ganga Valley, the Rana would have quite soon. Among the many noble houses that had joined the Rajput Confederacy was the next dynasty which will complete the puzzle to understanding the key players in North India and Mughal-Rajput history.\n\nThis was the Kachwahas of Amber. This dynasty claimed it\'s descent from the son Kush of the legendary King Rama of Ayodhya. Their ancestors allegedly migrated from Rama\'s kingdom of Kosala and established a new dynasty at Gwalior. After 31 generations, they moved to Rajputana and created a kingdom at Dhundhar. Dullah Rai, one of the ancestors of the Kachwaha rulers, defeated the Meenas of Manchi and Amber and later completed the conquest of Dhundhar by defeating the Bargurjars of Dausa and Deoti. However, in the early 16th century, they were conquered and vassalised by the Rathore ruler Maldeo of the kingdom of Marwar.\n\nIn 1527, the ruler of Amber who had joined the Rajput Confederacy was Prithviraj Singh I. Prithviraj had fought at Khanwa and like Rana Sanga, died soon afterwards, being succeeded by his son Puranmal. After Puranmal\'s succession, which was quite controversial, the Kachwaha domain became unstable over disputes regarding the succession of Puranmal to the Throne. This problem was only further exacerbated by neighbouring Rajput kingdoms that sought to capitalise on the situation. While accounts about Puranmal seeking the aid of Humayun are varying and quite contradictory we know for sure that after Puranmal, his brother Bhim Singh assumed the Throne. Bhim only reigned three and a half years before dying on 22 July 1537. He was succeeded in quick succession by two sons, Ratan Singh and Askaran, before the throne eventually passed to his younger brother Bharmal in 1548.\n\nIt is here that we arrive at a crucial juncture in Mughal-Rajput relations. In Mewar, the reigns were assumed by the 4th son of Rana Sanga, Maharana Udai Singh II, under whose reign the capital of Chittor was lost to Akbar in 1568 and the capital was shifted to Udaipur. Here his son, Maharana Pratap assumed the Throne after Udai died in 1572. Meanwhile, Akbar had overthrown his guardian Bairam Khan who had grown too ambitious and controlling and at the age of 18, the young Baadshaah of the Mughal Empire removed Bairam from service and continued his expeditions by directly controlling all affairs from 1560 onwards. Meanwhile, in 1562, the situation became critical for the Kachwahas of Amber when Mirza Muhammad Sharaf-ud-din Hussain was appointed Mughal governor of Mewat. Mirza led a large army to Amber which Bharmal could not resist. Mirza forced the Kachwahas to leave Amber and live in forests and hills. Bharmal promised a fixed tribute to Mirza and handed over his own son, Jagannath, and his nephews, Raj Singh and Khangar Singh, as hostages for its due payment. When Sharaf-ud-din was preparing to invade Amber again, Bharmal met Akbar\'s courtier, Chaghtai Khan. Fortunately, for Bharmal, Akbar was at Karavali (a village near Agra) on his way from Agra to Ajmer (on a pilgrimage to the dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti). Bharmal himself met Akbar at his camp at Sanganer on 20 January 1562. Here, Bharmal proposed a marriage between Akbar and his eldest daughter Hira Kunwari. Therefore, when Akbar agreed, the Kachwahas were now relatives of Akbar, Bharmal was his father-in-law and was in par with the highest Muslim nobles of the Empire. Hence, Sharaf-ud-din Mirza, returned to Bharmal his lands and relatives and in the following years, the Kachwahas rendered unwavering service to the Mughals while they themselves enjoyed the highest salaries, status and prestige the Empire had to offer.\n\nHence, The House of Mewar, still held in the highest esteem by all Rajput nobility was in a period of decline and The House of Amber had united with the Mughals. Raja Bharmal was succeeded by his son Raja Bhagwant Das in 1574. He served as Akbar\'s General and was awarded a rank or mansab of 5000 along with the title of Amir-ul-Umra. He fought battles in Punjab, Kashmir where he decisively defeated the Kashmiri King Yousuf Shah Chak and Afghanistan as well and he held the governorship of Kabul. His daughter Manbhawati Bai was married off to the Mughal Prince and future Emperor Jehangir. He died in 1589 being succeeded by his son Raja Man Singh.\n\nRaja Man Singh, assumed the Throne of Amber in 1589, but he had served with distinction at the Battle of Haldighati 1576 against the Maharana of Mewar, Maharana Pratap in a legendary battle, and in other campaigns as well. The reason why Akbar wanted to conquer Rajputana and especially Mewar was because with Mewar and the Rajputs at his flanks, his empire would never be secure, a fact he had learned by learning about the experiences of the Delhi Sultanate and their fruitless tussle with the Sisodiya dynasty. Yet, in his lifetime, Akbar could not conquer Mewar. Even after being defeated at Haldighati, where his army of 3000-4000 Rajputs and allied Bhils (400 men approx.), was defeated by Man Singh who commanded the Imperial Mughal Army roughly 8000-10,000 in numbers, Pratap Singh endured and by the end of his reign, he scored a decisive victory against the Mughals at Dewair in 1582 and took back Western Mewar including Kumbhalgarh, Udaipur and Gogunda through guerilla warfare and even destroyed newly built mosques in these regions in retaliation. He died in 1597.\n\nAfter his death, his son Maharana Amar Singh I (r. 1597-1620) assumed the Throne and followed his father\'s policy of resisting Mughal overlordship. Amar Singh continued to resist the Mughals and it was clear that he could not be taken in a battle, so  Mewar was devastated financially and in manpower due to the policy of Shah Jahan (son of Jahangir, Jahangir had become Emperor in 1605 after Akbar\'s death) , to scorch the lands of Mewar and make it incapable of supporting the efforts of Amar Singh. Finally, in 1615, Amar Singh submitted to the Mughals. Mewar including Chittor was assigned to him as Watan Jagir or hereditary patrimony. He secured a favourable peace treaty and it was ensured that Mewar would never bend his knee to the Mughal Emperors or serve at his court personally nor would the House of Mewar enter into matrimonial relations with the Mughals.\n\nHence, we see a clear policy emerging from the Mughals towards the Rajputs since the reign of Akbar. The first, religious tolerance and engagement at a political level, treating them as warriors and nobles on par with the Iranis or Turks in the Imperial service. The second, realising that the prestige of Mewar and the potential of the Rajputs uniting once again was an ever present threat and therefore it was better to assuage them. Third, following a policy of providing high posts and port folios to Rajput nobles who allied or accepted Mughal suzerainty. Fourth, matrimonial relations were never the prerequisite for such alliances as many Rajputs had previously simply accepted Mughal suzerainty and had acquired high posts for themselves.\n\nFinally, the attitudes in Rajputana and in general accross North India were shaped by the actions and decisions of the Rajput houses of Mewar and Amber. While Mewar only grew in prestige as the last stronghold and symbol of strength and resistance for the more conservative elements in Hindu society, the House of Amber was universally recognised as a house which produced some of the finest administrators and generals the Empire would ever know. And yet, the more conservative elements in Hindu society saw the House of Amber as traitors, ofcourse such opinions were never discussed in front of the Amber Rajas. \n\nUntil the reign of Aurangzeb, the Rajputs were more or less, united under the Mughal cause. They fought and led expeditions as far west and Afghanistan and Qandahar and as east as Bengal and Odissa. In 1585, Man Singh I was sent to conquer Afghanistan and silence the rebels there. Man Singh decisively defeated five major tribes of the Afghans including Yusufzai and "Mandar" tribes. The flag of Amber was changed from "Katchanar" (green climber in white base) to "Pachranga" (five colored) to commemorate this victory. This flag continued in use until accession of Jaipur state in India. This permanently crushed the revolt and the area remained peaceful thereafter.\n\nIn 1586 CE, Akbar sent another army under Raja Bhagwant Das, father of Prince Man Singh I to win Kashmir. Kashmir was included in the Mughal Empire and made a Sarkar (district) of Kabul province.\n\nMan Singh I also conquered Bihar in similar fashion. Abul Fazl has described Man Singhs campaign in Bihar in the following words. "The Raja united ability with courage and genius with strenuous action".\n\nMan Singh after conquering Bihar was ordered to defeat the Afghan Sultan Qatlu Khan Lohani of Orissa, Man Singh set out for Orissa on April 1590. By 1592, Odissa was also conquered by him.\n\nHis grandson Jai Singh I (r. 1621 - 1667), was another great General of the Mughal Empire. He was the second Raja to receive the title Mirza Raja, the first being his grandfather Man Singh I who received it from Akbar. During his career he served first in the Deccan, subduing the Gonds and then in Central Asia, fighting at Kandahar in the Mughal-Safavid wars and at Balkh.\n\n\nJai Singh, who had begun his own military career in the Deccan, was then appointed to lead a 14,000 strong army against Shivaji. And in 1665, he forced Shivaji to sign the Treaty of Purandar being the only noble in the. Empire to subdue the Maratha King. Although the opportunity his victories provided were made meaningless thanks to Aurangzeb\'s inability to compromise on his orthodox beliefs and accept Shivaji into his court with proper honours.\n\nIn conclusion, until the reign of Aurangzeb, whose interference into the succession matters of Rajput states, a matter which was left to the Rajputs by Akbar himself, the Rajputs, especially the house of Amber, continued to serve the Empire with loyalty and distinction. Both to serge the larger interests of the Empire and the interests of their own houses and their kingdoms. \n\n\nSources :\n\n\n"A History of Jaipur" by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n"Shivaji and His Times" By Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n" Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals (1206–1526) Part 2" by Satish Chandra\n\n\n"Akbarnama" by Abu\'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, Henry Beveridge (Trans.) \n\n\n"A Military History of India" by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n"History and Culture of the Indian People Volume VII : The Mughal Empire" by R.C Majumdar'<br />Author: 'MaharajadhirajaSawai'<br />id: 'mtf1ee'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>

Diwali mat manao pollution ho jayega, Holi mat manao pani waste hoga, Sankranti mat manao chiriya mar jayengi, Karwa Chowth mat manao patriarchal hai, falana dhamkana lóda làssàn etc etc. \nWe need to mark these fúckers with a suitable name, like we have the name Lutyens gang for anti national media, like we have the name Tukde Tukde gang for separatist rats in colleges. My request to you is, kindly do 5 minutes of brain storming and come up with names for this anti Hindu festival gang. With a name selected, we eill makes memes with it to popularize it  Dhanyawad.

<li>Title: 'Did India commit a strategic/humanitarian blunder by not allowing a complete partition in 1947 and are we seeing the ripple effect of it today?'<br />Body: 'For the premise, lets set up some data first:-\n\nPopulation percentage of muslims in undivided India - 23.4%( as per census of 1941, lets extrapolate it to 24% in 1947)\n\nPopulation percentage in 1951 - 10% (is around 17% in present times)\n\nThis means that around 14% moved(or were already present) in present day pakistan and bangladesh. \n\n\nNow lets look at the landmass distibution\n\nLandmass of pakistan - 881 K sqkm\nLandmass of bangladesh- 148 K sqkm\nLandmass of present india ( including the whole of J&amp;K)- 3.7 mil sqkm\n\nDoing simple maths tells us that the land allocated was around 26% of undivided India\'s landmass.\n\nFocus on the nunbers 24% muslims and 26% (increases to 28% if calculates pok) landmass designated for them. But only 14% actually lived over there.\n\nBoth jinnah(and the muslim league) as well as many prominent leaders like patel and ambedkar were of the view that parition has to be complete so as to remove the possibility of riots permanently. The muslim league actually wanted all the muslims to come to pakistan (as was done by them in awarding freebies like promoted posts and stuff in pakistan) and that was their actual demand. Thats why they wanted states like sindh and baluchistan to house the incoming muslims from india( remember that partition only took place in punjab and bengal, sindh was given wholeheartedly despite having a significant hindu population, currently known as sindhi. \n\nBut both gandhi and nehru were opposed to this and in their way to make up to the muslims who "chose" to stay in india , were awarded freebies like a personal law board, tax free madrassa and masjid setups etc, basically a way to make them stay back in india itself.\n\nIn short, muslims chose to stay in india, hindus and sikhs were expelled from pakistan,  so shorter landmass taking influx of more and more people. The muslims in pakistan filled up that void by having a birthrate of around 3.5, while hindu population in india has around 1.8.\n\nSo when they say that muslims are only 16% of india,  they hide the fact that its on 26% lower landmass. This has resulted in the balance ratio being 4:1  in 1947 to 4:3 in the indian subcontinent currently.\n\n\nP.S if you\'ve read it this far please give it an upvote so that it reaches max people on the sub.

<li>Title: 'Why are we so passionate about claiming sikhs are hindus? This is damaging relations with our sikh brothers and is theologically flawed. (Please read the whole thing before casting judgement) Thankyou, Jai Shri Ram🙏🏾'<br />Body: 'Hey brothers and sisters my aim here is to create an open discourse and I\'m curious to see your opinions. I use blunt language but I mean no offence 🙏🏾. \n\nI have messaged about this previously however I did not articulate my points very well, therefore I\'ve added information to make my point clearer. Ultimately my goal here is to highlight that it is a waste of time to keep imposing that Sikhism is a sect of Hinduism. I have two main reasons why I think it is a bad idea to go down the route of claiming Sikhs as Hindus. 1. It does not benefit us and is actually a hindrance. 2. The theology behind it is flawed. (Read the reasons before judging) \n\n1. It damages the reputation of Hindus: \nSikhs, Muslims and even english people are using the term "Hindu extremism" to reference Hindus calling sikhs a sect of them. They say that we are imposing our beleifs on others. (I dont know why Muslims are getting involved, Ahmadi Muslims constantly claim Guru Nanak was a Muslim you can read their articles online). Even many Hindus are saying we are imposing our beliefs on them. So from a PR\xa0 standpoint this is a really bad look for Hindus and actually hinders us. Because they look at us as just another abrihamic religion trying to control or appropriate the faiths of others. (Our religion does not teach this) \n\n\n2.\xa0 The ideology behind this argument is flawed:\nWhen I was looking at arguments of whether Sikhism was a sect of Hindusim, firstly I was looking only at ideologies (presented to me from fellow hindus) which imposed the idea that Sikhism is indeed a sect of Hinduism. After this I was convinced and I started to debate with some of my close Sikh friends, ultimately this didn\'t end well for me 😂. They encouraged me to go and look from the Sikh perspective. Which seems reasonable as I wouldn\'t go to a mosque and talk to an Imam to try and understsnd Hinduism, I would go to a pandit. So I researched the Sikh perspective and tbh it completely blows away the argument that Sikhs are a sect of Hinduism and highlights just how faulty this ideogy is. That is why I\'ve come to conclusion that this is a losing battle. \n\nWhen I look at the ideology behind claims that Sikhs are a sect of Hinduism it is ultimately flawed. I know the intentions are good but ultimately it falls apart when you have a conversation with an educated sikh. When I look into the arguments claiming that sikhs are a sect of hindus they are extremly selective and do not look at the wider concept. Lets leave the scriptures for now and start with the lives of the gurus "Guru Nanak was born into a Hindu family". This is not a valid argument Christ was born into a Jewish family, that doesn\'t\xa0 make him a jew or mean that Christians are jews. Guru Nanak heavily criticised many aspects of Hinduism he also did this with Islam. His religion was so ambiguous that Muslims and Hindus fought over how to bury him. Guru Nanak does not claim inspiration from Hindusim but claims it from God himself and as he explains it, this god is the same god Muslims beleive and the same god Hindus believe. He states and Sikhs themselves beleive that he reflects god in human form and is above all previous prophets. From a Sikh perspective it is clear that Guru Nanak himself is saying that none of his teachings are derived from Hindusim and any correlation that there is with hinduism e.g. reincarnation reflects the truth that is in hinduism and not from hinduism itself. \n\n(Be under no illusion Hindus, Sikhs themselves make very bold claims and believe their religion is the ultimate truth derived from god). When I look at sources that claim Sikhs are Hindus they often strawman what sikhs beleive to make the gurus seem more in touch with Hindusim. They fail to mention that the first sikh convert was muslim (bhai mardana). They try to state that as a people Sikhs have solely hindu ancestry or 95%. This is factually untrue and when reaserched it is closer to 50/50 or at the very, very least 70/30 (hindu to muslim) there are recorded cases of mass conversions of muslims to sikhism from mughal and Sikh sources. Guru nanak converted many sufi saints and their followers. Guru Arjan converted big groups of muslims as referenced by the mughal king Jahangier in his autobiography (even if they were all hindus which they weren\'t thats akin to me saying all Christians should become jewish it\'s not a sound argument). Guru Gobind Singh Jis army was 20% muslim (when I found this out I was gobsmacked and didn\'t know what to say). Even after the gurus, Banda Singh Buhadur (a sikh warrior who converted from Vaishnava to Sikhism under guru gobind) when he took punjab he converted many muslims on mass (by free will). Also there is a Hindu obsession with Guru Tegh Buhadur because he stuck up and helped Hindus in Kashmir. This argument is based on a reference in which he calls himself a "hindu". This Is a really bad reference that was made in the 19th century and secondly It is a reference to his heritage being past the indus river a "hindu" (the word hindu did not even exist in a religious context then, only in a geographical sense so he is saying he is an Indian). Many sufis such as Bulleh Shah refer to Guru tegh Buhadur as a ghazi (meaning a warrior of Islam and Allah) again idk why we tend to miss these points out and cherry pick the ones that suite us. (Bulleh Shahs sufi poetry at the time of the Sikh gurus clearly distinguished sikhs, hindus and muslims as separate\xa0 religous groups).( It is clear that guru Tegh Buhadur was neither a muslim or a hindu but a sikh and to represent him differently is extremely disrepectful. This is espically so considering all the things he did for hindus.)\n\n\nThe ideology that sikhs are hindus also crumbles when you look at the Sikh scriptures. The guru granth sahib rebukes all hindu texts multiple times including the vedas and the purans "He is beyond the world of the Vedas, the Koran and the Bible. The Supreme King of Nanak is immanent and manifest". The guru granth sahib also qoutes "Rama, Mohammad, eighteen Puranas (Books of the Hindu faith), and Quran (muslim faith) say a lot about their own religions but I do not follow any one of them". (Again highlighting Sikhs believe guru Nanak is god and his teachings are not derived from Hinduism. This also highlights that the sikh scriptures themselves are presenting the idea that they are different/distinct from Islam and Hindusim) "The great volumes of the Simritees and the Shaastras only extend the extension of attachment to Maya". "One may read all the books of the Vedas, the Bible, the Simritees and the Shaastras, but they will not bring liberation". (Guru Granth Sahib Ji, Ang 747). Sikhs beleive indisputably that the guru granth sahib contains a higher level than all the hindu and islamic books that have come before it so therefore there must be something deeper in it than both hindus and muslims can supply. This is what we hindus are missing, we will never convince sikhs that they are hindus because they believe their teachings are deeper than ours. Guru Gobind Singh Ji openly states this, that compared to hinduisim and islam "the new way of the khalsa is supreme". This idea that Sikhism holds Hindu theology in a high regard and above other faiths is a made up concept and is highlighted again when pir Bhiken shah (a muslim saint) prayed to guru gobind when he was a baby (as he saw the light of Allah in him). Pir Bhiken shah then held out two sweets one from a muslim shop and one from a hindu shop, to see which one the guru preferred Hindusim or Islam. Guru Gobind Singh Ji then put his hands on both to symbolise they are the same. This is what\'s not understood by many hindus, though on a theological level Sikhism and Hinduism are more similar to each other than Islam, Sikhs and their gurus themselves veiwed Hinduism and Islam (Sufism) the same while stating that their own religion is superior ( what I mean by this is Sikhs believe that belief itself is not important. They beleive that for a human good actions and connecting to god is the most important thing one should do. So believing they are the "superior" in this sense means they believe that their path and teachings are the best out of any to facilitate that connection to the one and good actions. They do not beleive their path is the only path to do this, so in this case "superior" is not the same "superior" that Islam has where they are exclusive.) Any theology you try and pin on them will fall apart such a reincarnation (yazdis believe in that and so do arab nostics they aren\'t sects of hindusim, agian they believe any similarities that are apparent are a reflection of truths that hindusim has and not from them). \n\nThe issue of Ram comes up alot too, but Sikhs openly say they believe in Ram and revere him but that doesn\'t make them hindu (just as us revering the sikh gurus doesn\'t make us sikh). Just as swami vivekanad writes about his reverence for jesus, this does not mean he is now a Christian. Muslims also revere Jesus that doesnt make them Christian either. Sikhs do not beleive, however that Ram or Krishna are on the same level as their gurus and claim their gurus to be perfect (the gurus hold this view too). They also use the word Ram in two situations one to represent the historical figure and one to represent the one god. They use this representation to compare him to Allah saying they are one in the same (speaking up for hindus being persecuted because of their beleifs, saying to the muslims the allah you pray to and the Ram they pray to are one in the same. Sikhs use the names Allah and Ram interchangeably for the name of god. Sikhs also have their own distinct names for god such as Waheguru and Akal Purakh). \n\nThe issue of the Dasam granth (a book written by Guru Gobind Singh ji) also comes up to reinforce the narrative that sikhs are hindus but again this is destroyed by context and education. It is claimed that Guru Gorbind Singh Ji worships Durga, how can this be the case when in the dasam granth it also says “I have killed hill Rajas (kings) who are bent on mischief. They are stone idol worshippers, I break idols and I worship ONE lord.”\n(Zaffarnama, Guru Gobind Singh Ji).( Hindus shouldn\'t really be too worried about this line I know it sounds extreme but the hill rajas were bad hindus that sided with the mughal government and were complicit in the forced converstions of other hindus). Even though Sikhs are against idol worship (im sure no hindu would disagree with that) when I speak to my sikh friends they say that the word idol in this verse is a metaphor for greed and pride as these were the things that the hill rajas worshiped and so these are the things guru gobind singh ji came to destroy (not an idol in the physical sense we know it). So how do we reconcile a praise to Durga in dasam granth with "I worship ONE lord". The sikh perspective is this, hindus aren\'t taking into account context. Just as the Bhagvad Gita is presented in the context of Krishna having a conversation with Arjan (a hindustani living in 1500BC). The dasam granth is presented in the context of a sikh who has already read guru granth sahib and achieved moksha. (Dasam granth is an important text to the sikhs but not as important as the guru granth sahib). Guru Gobind wrote this text to then embolden the sikhs and give them "bi ras" to fight the mughals at overwhelming odds. So unlike the context of the guru granth sahib where Sikhs argue that the text is universal across time and culture (individuals from two completely different cultures can read it and understand it such as hindus and muslims). So in the instance of the dasam granth the storys told arent factual stories, Sikhs OPENLY say this (such as the story of krishna with muslims in it when islam wasn\'t even a relgion). But it does not matter to the sikhs because the overall purpose of the dasam granth is not to educate or reach moksha ( it presumes you have already reached that level at this stage) its purpose is to inspire sikhs to be active, fight injustice and to not fear death ( maybe this is the reason behind sikh over representation and their rather large effect on India in comparison to their small numbers 2%.\xa0 They had a big impact on the mughals despite their numbers and during the struggle for independence against the British 80-90% of people who recieved life imprisonment or were hanged were sikhs). \n\nSo no Sikh scholar or intellectual sikh accepts worship of Durga for it would contradict the guru granth sahib and even the dasam granth "I worship ONE lord". They exclaim that the poem chandi di var is worship of the khalsa and not Durga ( I see many hindus singing chandi di var on navarati, beware we are not singing in praise of mata ji but in praise of the khalsa) they reference Durga as Bhagauti which means weapon. What does every khalsa memeber have at their side? A Bhagauti (kirpan). What is Bhagauti (Durga) sitting on? A lion or better known in punjabi as a "singh". What does the kirpan sit on? A singh (Durga symbolises a singh going into battle being lead by his shasta/kirpan). The story is a metaphor for the khalsa. Bhagauti fighting the demons is a metaphore for Sikhs fighting the mughals. (I can go deeper into how it relates more to the khalsa but I think you get the gist). \n\nThere is a real historical story to back this up from guru gorbind singh ji. Guru Gorbind after saving a mundir was encouraged by the pandits to pray to Durga for she is the protector of dharma and the sikhs can win any battles with her on their side. Guru Gobind humours the head pandit Keshav das and asks him how is this the case? Keshav das replies I can summon her for you. He would reveal the goddess by reciting the “Chandi Mantra” one lakh times but would need a ridiculous amount of samagari for a havan (thinking this would be too tiresome for the guru to do). The Guru surprises the pundit and asks his sikhs to get all the samagari for the Havan. When the items are gathered the Guru goes up to Keshav das and asks him to summon Durga for all to see. Keshav das begins to get visibly stressed as he knows he cannot summon Durga and exclaims that to summon Durga a sacrifice of your most beloved son is needed (looking at guru gobinds eldest son) the guru laughs and touches Keshav das saying anyone who would go through this trouble for me is my most beloved son. Keshav Das soon after this runs away with the pandits. Guru Gobind Singh Ji then asks his sikhs to grab all the samagri and and dump it into a fire creating a massive havan near the mundir. Soon hindus and sikhs begin to gather as a great flame arose. The hindus ask the guru is Durga here to which he replies yes, Guru enters his martial form and raises his sword in the air and exclaims "This is Chandi”. This is the real Durga which vanquished enemies in battlefield, this is the Kaalka which drinks blood of enemies and destroys them, this is the Bhagauti which protects Dharam and destroys evil”. (The message here to the hindus is if you want to protect your faith from the mughals pick up the sword and fight) he is also exclaiming that he does not beleive in the same Durga we hindus beleive, which takes the form of a beautiful women sitting on a lion but in the form of a man/woman raising the sword to protect dharma (to a sikh the real protector of their faith is themselves this is why sikhs use imagery and metaphors to describe worship of "the sword or Bhagauti" in the sense that we use metaphors and imagery through worship of the "mother cow"). \n\nSo this argument that sikhs worship Hindu gods is false \n“I do not adore Ganesha in the beginning and also do not mediatate on Krishna and Vishnu; I have only heard about them with my ears and I do not recognize them; my consciousness is absorbed in the feet of the Supreme Kal (the Immanent Brahman).434". When a Sikh uses the word Brahman or Ram in reference to God it is in reference to one formless god. For a Sikh it is not stating any special relations with Hinduism as it can be interchangeable with Allah and many verses in the guru granth sahib use reference to arabic words for god such as Allah instead of the hindu or Sanskriti words for god ( the word "khalsa" itself is an arabic word meaning pure). This may be obvious to most but when I read arguments or watch videos based on arguments for sikhs being a sect of hindusim. They don\'t seem to realise the fact that the gurus were indian and of course they are going to use Indian concepts to explain god such as Brahman otherwise their followers would have no idea what they were talking about. (Remember alot of their converts if not a majority were hindu). Just as Arab Christians refer to god as Allah, this does not make them muslim. A better argument I think for us to make is that Sikhism comes under the dharmic branch of faiths and just like Christianity shares ancestory with Judaism and they are under the same abrihamical branch. So is Sikhsim and Hindusm under the same dharmic branch. But it is without a doubt evident that the Sikh gurus preached a religion seperate from Hinduism. Not one educated sikh or scholar of Sikhism accepts the claim that Sikhs are a sect of Hinduism and that in itself is a very bold statement that I think we should consider. We are not convicing anyone but ourselfs, not one Christian, Muslims or Sikh accepts this perception of Sikhism not even many Hindus. This concept of dividing Hinduism if sikhs aren\'t apart of us is absolutely silly, sikhs being a seperate religion doesn\'t weaken Hindusim our culture is distinct and more than beautiful enough as it is. We also need to let go of our pride it\'s not worth dying on this hill arguing that sikhs are Hindus. No one is convinced and we are talking to ourselfs, the only ones outside of hinduism that are listening are mocking us and using this flawed ideology as fuel to propagate the term "hindu extremism" WE NEED TO STOP.\n\n\n(In reference to Sikhs thinking their religion is the best just because they think this does NOT mean they are entitled to talk down and disrespect other faiths and this is referenced In their guru granth sahib. I have no problem with them thinking their relgion is the best because I beleive Hinduism is the best and I beleive that we should he more confident in saying that. To each their own and we should not be disresptecting the faith of others unless they attack us first Jai Shri Ram 🙏🏾)'<br />Author: 'jujuubaaa'<br />id: 'msblio'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

Think a person is a transphobe if he refuses to date a trans person. A person is a racist if they refuse to date a black or white person. Their chimp brains incapable of understanding it's the person's choice and they don't have any right to judge people on how they want to spend their life.\n20. Think we should make unisex bathrooms to accommodate trans people. This means allowing men and women to use the same bathrooms. Think men should be allowed to compete in women sports championships and avail scholarships for women if they identify as a woman.\n21. Think that a 7yo boy is actually a girl and dress him in girls clothes and mentally torture him into thinking he's a girl just because he played with a doll once in his life.\n22. Jail people for not calling them ze/zer or their preferred pronouns.\n23. Fire people and label them communal and destroy their career for being islamophobic but champion and sponsor Hinduphobia calling it as a fight against hindutva.\n24. Think instances of Hindus eating beef in ancient India proves that cows aren't sacred to hindus despite it being said clearly in Hindu sacred texts. Make every bit of an effort to get that included in textbooks in India to hurt religious sentiments of hindus. Don't talk about Allah and God being pagan words adopted by Abrahamic Religions. Don't talk about sex slavery being practiced by Christians and Muslims. \n25. Think supporting Hinduism and criticizing Islam means being a modi supporter. \n26. Don't know that 99% of terrorist organizations fight for Islam. Still say terrorists have no religion. Become complete hypocrites when they call every bjp and rss worker hindutva terrorists.\n27. Live in privilege without knowing how minorities are treated in Islamic states. Think Hijab is empowering.\n28. Try to justify rape and hide rape cases by Islamic grooming gangs in their country so they don't appear communal. Choose to support pedophiles and rapists instead of pointing out crimes by Muslims just so they can be politically correct.\n29. Think it's fine if 1000s of Hindu girls are raped and converted in Muslim countries every year. Think making special provisions for easier access to citizenship for these prosecuted minorities is being communal. And outright 'villainous'. Living in privilege in their homes while not knowing anything about the pains of being raped or being abducted and married off to a Muslim man.\n30. Refuse to see how bollywood has become urduwood. Every Bollywood actor has been known to mock Hinduism on screen or praise Allah. \n31. Haven't read a single Hindu scripture. Become the figurehead for all Hindus when a muslim is oppressed. Stay silent on attacks against hindus.\n32. Think it's okay to mock hindus under the garb of hindutva. Think mocking Islam is communal and fascist\n33. Think all the crimes by muslims is because of culture instead of a religious dogma. Refuse to see clear signs of crimes committed by muslims invoking the name of Islam in every corner of the world.\n34. Think ram mandir trust should be used for welfare of people. Think people should make hospitals instead of temples. Refuse to say anything about waqf board or people creating masjids and churches all around India\n35. Show their utter idiocy and lack of brain cells when they compare polytheistic and Abrahamic religions together. Don't know how they differ completely.\n36. Are quick to list crimes by other religions under news reports of crimes by people holding Islamic ideologies. Refuse to do the same for other religions. \n37. Fail to raise voices for making Islamic states secular. \n38. Cry tears and make a million posts for hijab ban in France. Stay silent on concentration camps for Muslims in China.\n39. Will cry tears over BLM. Black athletes making public announcements in support of BLM. The same black athlete refuses to cut ties off with Chinese companies sponsoring him to protests against concentration camps for Muslims in China.\n40. Think murderers and rapists should be given lower life sentences. Cry human rights violations for such monsters. \n41. Will support communism despite it having killed more people than world wars.\n42. Think speaking English is a sign of being educated. Don't know it's a basic language and absolutely pathetic compared to scholarly languages like Sanskrit.\n43. Think speaking Hindi is backward. Lick white boots and seek white validation. Think criticizing Hindu practices like Karwa Chauth is being progressive and cool.\n44. Think India didn't exist before British rule. Have no Idea India was culturally connected for thousands of years having been unified under several empires before the Britishers like Mauryas, Gupta-Vakatas.\n45. Think India isn't a Hindu country because allegedly aryans 'invaded' India thousands of years ago. Fail to see that logic applies to every other country geographically defined today. All cultures country claim as their own has been brought to them by invaders\n46. Think Indians were backward and peasants in the past while Europeans were advanced. Have no idea Europeans lived in poor conditions in the past and were barbarians while Indians were civilized booming with trade and having vast amount of resources.\n47. Goes abroad to see a broken colosseum calling it a technological marvel. Fails to see the culmination of human artistry and skill in Kailash Ellora Temple in his own country.\n48. Thinks temples are useless failing to see the welfare causes and donations they make for people all throughout India.\n49. Thinks Islamic invaders were not religious bigots and writes 1000s of books trying to prove that without reading the 100s of contemporary accounts by the same invaders where they are overcome with extreme tears of joy at killing Hindus and making their women their sex slaves. Such barbaric Muslim mentality isn't found anywhere else in the world. Nobody else in known history has been so proud or happy at killing and torturing other people and razing their temples to the ground than followers of these abrahamic religion whose dicks these liberals are sucking now.\n50. Has an inferiority complex and thinks Indian culture is backward without knowing about their contributions to literature, architecture, medicine, science, maths, astronomy, music, philosophy etc."<br />Author: 'horrorlover2'<br />id: 'mrrhi0'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

<li>Title: 'Hindu, Sikh relations: we need to stop imposing on the faiths of others (please read the whole thing)'<br />Body: 'There is a constant bombardment of idelogy promoting that Sikhism as a sect of Hindusim (correct me if im wrong this is just what ive seen and heard).I am currently saddend by the direction hinduism is moving in, a core principle of our faith is that we do not impose on others but this is exactly what we are doing in todays times. This ideology is no better than the mughals, or muslims saying that Muhammed is prophesied in the vedas so you all should be Muslim. We have lost our way. No Sikh that I know accepts this and it is clear from speaking with my sikh friends that gurbani teaches, objectively a new faith, they believe guru Nanak is god on earth. It is not for me to judge their faith this is their own path and is not for us to impose on them. The 10 gurus were objectively sikh and sikhs beleive they are god on earth and that\'s what the sikh gurus themselves preached. Can you not see that we are disrepecting these great gurus, that we as hindus also revere. How can we lie about them and try and appropiate them as hindus when they\'ve done sooo much for our faith. I am a Punjabi hindu and I can boldly say that I would not be a hindu if not for Guru Gorbind Singh ji, my family wouldve have been killed or converted by the mughals if the sikhs did not stand up and protect us. \n\nThis is one of the reasons why khalistan still has traction, because they point at hindus who say the "sikh gurus are hindus" and say look they are disrepecting sikhism and brothers are they wrong? (I certainly would be extremely annoyed if someone was to constantly call Ram ji Muslim) We need to have a long look at ourselves in the mirror the world is watching I live in the UK and when I speak to english people about hinduism they\'ve started to bring up "hindu extremsism" what???? Our faith isn\'t extreme! They cite us imposing our faith on sikhs as one these issues, this is a PR nightmare and not benefiting hindus in anyway we need to stop this tomfoolery and stop saying that sikhs are hindus IT DOES NOT BENEFIT HINDUS IN ANY WAY. We have our own culture and practices and should be more than proud of them jai shree Ram 🙏🏾. You can agree with the concept of a Hindu India without appropriating the faiths and the religions of others. In fact I would go so far as to say it is truly not a hindu nation if we impose and misappropriate the beleifs of others. (Sorry if I came across blunt or rude this has been festering on my mind for a long time and I needed to share it I dont want hinduism to become another "religion" we should keep what makes us distinct and special and remove this nonsense from our ideology)'<br />Author: 'jujuubaaa'<br />id: 'mriern'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

I am an armchair travel enthusiast and whenever I get time, I watch Travel Channels and I've subscribed to many travel blogs.\n\nSo what? You must be thinking.\n\nPatience, ma boi, Patience! Since one or two years, I've observed a surge in articles praising the beauty of Bislamic countries emphasizing how ancient and unique is their culture, how blessed they are in natural beauty, how they have embraced modernization. The same shows which only show half-naked, impoverished children and families in India take gorgeous pictures of skyscrapers in Azerbaijan and Turkeministan. Even there is a very intense effort to showcase how Pakistan is the best and most beautiful country to explore for a female traveller and India is full of rapists, eve teasers and cons. The travel bloggers who get diarrhoea in the first hour they land India relish eating Pakistani cuisines.\n\nNow, you'll say, I'm sweating the subatomic stuff. Nope! Tourism is a major source of income and forex for many developed countries and those who think, we are against a group of illiterate, stupid people are wrong. They are very smart, more than any Indian realizes, and they are fighting on many fronts and have a huge lead on us. We are seeing only what they want us to see but their behind the scene strategy is so cunning."<br />Author: 'dreamerimagine1'<br />id: 'mr9dkv'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
