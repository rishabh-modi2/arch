<li>Title: 'Help me escape this marriage invitation!'<br />Body: "Hello All!\n\nI'm using a throwaway account as my main account username is my real name (I know it was stupid of me).\n\nBackground:\n\nI (43M) have been abandoned by the relatives (uncles, aunts, and by that extension all of my cousins) ever since I was in my teens because a girl accused me of making sexual advances towards her. It was during a marriage in the family in some other city. \n\nAt that time there was a lot of slander campaign against me due to all the drama happening around. \n\nThis incident, frankly, broke me. My closest, trusted, loved people chose to throw me away like one throws away a tissue after wiping their ass. And not one person in the family (including my mom and dad) asked me if I was alright. \n\nAnyway, since then most of my extended family keeps away from me. I also shut down anyone who may try to contact me (this happens extremely rarely like once in 5 to 7 years). I'm happier this way, away from the drama, nonsense and family politics/appeasement.\n\nNow the eldest daughter of my eldest cousin is getting married in June and my mom has told me that my cousin will be inviting me for the wedding. I would rather not go because it would be traumatic being with my relatives for an extended period of time.\n\nHowever I'm not able to think of good excuse for not going to the event.\n\nI need your help here because firangs won't understand the dynamics of Indian culture and family so no use asking in relationshipadvice or askreddit. \n\nI want to have an excuse that seems credible and saves me from going there, doesn't make them feel bad, doesn't make me look bad, and doesn't give an opportunity to the drama-lovers in the family to escalate and revel in the drama.\n\nAny ideas?"<br />Author: 'IfIMoveOut'<br />id: 'tkia64'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Holi is celebrated in the **month of Phalguna of the Hindu calendar** and the festivities start on the evening of the **Purnima (Full Moon day).** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why do we celebrate Holi?\n\nAccording to the Bhagavata Purana which reveals all the **Holi festival history**, Hiranyakashipu was the king of demonic Asuras and had earned a boon which made him gain five special powers which are let death do not come to him either by :\n\n1. **Man or Beast,** \n2. **Nor Devil, nor God shall cause his death by** \n3. **Day or by Night with Steel or Stone or Wood,**\n4. **Indoors or Outdoors,**\n5. **or Earth or in Sky.** \n\n[Hiranyakashipu](https://preview.redd.it/lnib04ag8zn81.png?width=1150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b52710e4b3d439c966fdd7e7e4a3f23c8eeebb6)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe wanted everyone to worship him but his son, Prahlada disagreed and devoted Lord Vishnu. Infuriated Hiranyakashipu gave cruel punishments and finally Holika, Prahlada‚Äôs evil aunt tricked him into sitting on a pyre with her. As the fire roared, Holika burned while Prahlada survived.\n\n[Prahlad with Holika](https://preview.redd.it/4lbsshfj8zn81.png?width=695&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24ea4bab4652e6315cc609c0f5d523e7ff1683ce)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHiranyakashipu eventually becomes so angry and upset went to meet Prahlada as he refuses to acknowledge his father as the supreme lord of the universe and claims that Vishnu is all-pervading and omnipresent.\xa0To which Hiranyakashipu points to a nearby pillar and asks if \'his Vishnu\' is in it. The king got up from his throne in fury and hit the pillar with his mace. And to his surprise! The pillar cracked with a thundering sound and\xa0Vishnu\xa0appeared there in the form of Narasimha. **One half of his body was of a lion and the other half of a man. He had matted hair on his head, large moustaches on the face and terrible teeth in the mouth. His paws had terrible nails on them.** \n\n[Narasimha Avatar of Vishnu killing Hiranyakashipu](https://preview.redd.it/n0gqcknv8zn81.png?width=1355&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8049a602fddddc0f647fc6cc3bb974f5d7afb9b7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNarsimha roared angrily. The demon king Hiranyakashipu tried his best to escape from Narsimha. But at last, Narsimha caught hold of him and dragged him towards the threshold. **There, he put Hiranyakashipu on thighs and tore his belly with his terrifying nails.**Even after killing Hiranyakashipu none of the gods(Lord Shiva, Brahma) were able to calm Narasimha\'s fury, So all the gods and goddesses called His consort, the goddess Lakshmi, but she was also unable to do so. Then, at the request of Brahma, Prahlada was presented to Narasimha. He was pacified when Prahlad touched his feet.\xa0Lord Narsimha then asked Prahlad to seek some boon. Prahlad said: **‚ÄúYou are my true Lord. If you wish to grant me a boon, kindly bless me that no desire may arise in my mind for anything.‚Äù\xa0Pralada also prayed for his father.** \n\n[Prahlad with Lord Vishnu \\(Narasimha\\)](https://preview.redd.it/djix0hw59zn81.png?width=559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e7f6638170468cedc7d5494e1860fad1fd4a7d7)\n\n.................................................\n\nOne more story related to Holi\'s history is that..  \n\nOne day Bal kanaiya asked his mother, "Maiya mori Radha Kyun Gori aur mein Kyun kaala?"\n\nMaa Yoshodha told him, "what difference does it make, even if Radha is Kaali she will still be Radha and if you are gora you will still be my Kanha... She said if u want to check for yourself why don\'t you apply any colour at Radha"\n\nNext day our Kanha took some colours and splashed on his Radha. And then Radha also took some colours and splashed on her kahna, looking at this fun activity all their friends joined in.\n\n[Radha and Krishna playing Holi](https://preview.redd.it/ncuwhobmczn81.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c4bbca386150bde7916d2c1c713e5b38ddfed1c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# How Holi is played in different states?\n\n**1)  Lathmar Holi &amp; Holi Milan - Uttar Pradesh**\n\n In Mathura and Vrindavan areas, women run after men with lathis or canes and playfully hit them during this celebration. The men come prepared with a *‚Äòdhal* or shield.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qzlzs12jizn81.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddcfa32b192941cb8c9f07587138da9f1cf0296c\n\n \n\n**2) Holla Mohalla- Punjab**\n\nThe celebration exhibits a profound display of martial arts, horse-riding, and reciting poetry, primarily to pay homage to the bravery of Sikh warriors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e9xzaa2gkzn81.png?width=595&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=130a624d2267dea37b7a8776f67fac5229f47550\n\n**3) Rang Panchami ‚Äì Maharashtra**\n\nIn Maharashtra, Holi is also known as Shigma or Rang Panchami (colour on the fifth). The celebrations start after the sunset on Purnima by lighting up a pyre of firewood (burning Holika), symbolizing the victory of good over evil. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3n7tnw7mkzn81.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a1ee5d4abc060d526b7c18e03d2a9c82ee70932\n\n \n\n**4) Shigmo- Goa** \n\nThe spring festival in Goa is called Shigmo. It is organized as a massive carnival with traditional folk songs and street dances, apart from playing with colours \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eh5jmswbjzn81.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e982ac04bb8e1794b78e8b78fa2195b4d44561c2\n\n**5)  Dol Yatra- Bengal**\n\nBengal, Holi is called Dol Yatra, or the swing festival. Traditionally the festival is celebrated with idols of Krishna and Radha are placed on swings and devotees take turns to swing them. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w78taorpkzn81.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e749f160a0a5dca0a07c7e80abc66861bb4750c\n\n \n\n**6) Kumaoni Holi - Uttarakhand**\n\n This festivity is more of a musical affair than of colours as in the other states, and signifies the start of the sowing season for the farming community. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u1tr0h81kzn81.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=863a11f1b0ac674c0c517eed2dea3dd4e8ee0558\n\n \n\n**7) Manjal Kuli- Kerala**\n\nThe celebration happens only in a handful of temples and is a rather peaceful one where locals, especially from the Konkani and Kudumbi communities (that migrated from Goa), visit the temple on the first day and continue with the festivities on the second day. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g3mie67ukzn81.png?width=285&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d27817d00ac4e914756365aec466505bafe697e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So Happy Holi to everyone, drink thandai and play with colors ...spend time with friends and family.**'<br />Author: 'Masulipatanam'<br />id: 'tgh08g'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm üïâÔ∏è</li>

<li>Title: 'My review on The Kashmir Files'<br />Body: 'As a Kashmiri pandit myself, I urge everyone to see this movie. Reasons for it have been stated below.\nThe hard work done during research and interviewing the families of victims for this movie was clearly visible in every scene. There is not a single scene in the movie which has been made up, everything shown in the movie is exactly how it happened. In the past few years I had heard about these stories from my parents but seeing it visually in the movie was very disturbing and emotionally taxing to say the least. I can‚Äôt even imagine what my family and other families from my community must‚Äôve gone through that time.\n\nIn the past whenever a movie was made on Kashmir(Mission Kashmir, Haider, Shaurya, Shikara) it always reversed the victims and aggressors. Muslims were shown as the victims whereas that is far from reality. Few years ago, a Kashmir Hindu director made a film called Shikara and we all expected it to show our genocide as it happened but it was just another propaganda movie on Kashmir by that lobby.\n\nBefore seeing this movie, I had seen videos of people coming out of the theatres crying because of what they saw, some felt guilty and angry that they didn‚Äôt know about what happened with their fellow Indians until now. After the movie got over, I myself heard some people cry and as we all were leaving the hall‚Ä¶ there was silence and everyone‚Äôs facial expression explained the reason behind it. \n\nThe characters in the movie from Pushkar Nath Pandit to Krishna Pandit felt so relatable that at times i felt as if i knew those characters personally. This movie showed how propaganda is done in the name of sympathy, how we have enemies of the nation living amongst us, the so called leftist and Islamist ‚Äòintellectuals‚Äô in the system, media etc. The climax scene of the movie will leave you shattered. There was a lot of depth, meaning and agony behind every word and slogan especially some kashmiri words used that I think the non-Kashmiris will not be able to understand even with the subtitles.\n\nTo all critics saying Kashmir Files is creating hatred, calling out hatred is not creating hatred. Our story deserved to be told as it happened. \n\nI liked how through the movie they said that what happened with the Kashmiri pandits was a GENOCIDE. We were FORCED to leave out homes, we didn‚Äôt leave by choice. We were FORCED to become refugees in our OWN country. It shows how a certain community chooses religion over everything(even moral and ethical values) and is willing to do anything in the name of religion, from raping and killing their own neighbours to not even sparing small children. From the local moulvis to our neighbors, all of them were involved in this. They did not even spare those from their own community who chose to oppose them. \nJust 2 days ago, 3rd village sarpanch was SHOT DEAD this month and last week a bomb was hurled in a market killing 1 and hurting over 20.\n\nMy family or others from my community could‚Äôve lived a good life back in Kashmir, they just had to convert and give up on their dharma but they did not. Despite being a Kashmiri, I have been to Kashmir only once and that too was as a visitor. We still cannot return as it is still not safe for us. My grandparents couldn‚Äôt return back to Kashmir in their lifetime but I hope my parents and I can return back to Kashmir. Today I can proudly wear my Janeu and call myself a Kashmiri Hindu but there is a story of resistance and sacrifice behind it for which I will forever be indebted to my parents and grandparents. \n\nIt has been 32 years since our 7th genocide but there is a 8th one which is going on which then, this time it is the Indian state, Indian media and fellow Indians who have ignored to address what happened with us. It has been 32 years and people responsible for our genocide still haven‚Äôt been punished. Even today many Indians continue to deny that a 1990 happened. The Supreme Court denied opening files related to the Kashmiri Genocide. Those who killed us.. gave open interviews on TV and attended parties with Prime Minister. If there is any shame left in our Judiciary, they should hear our plea and give us justice as soon as possible.\nWe still haven‚Äôt gotten justice even after 32 years. \nIs 32 years not enough for this blind state and system to give justice to a persecuted community? \n\nI would urge everyone to see this movie to know about what we Kashmiri Hindus have gone through and learn lessons from it. Show this movie to your family and friends, talk about this with them. There are so many topics like this that can be picked by directors but that will happen only when movies like this do well in the theatre so the onus is on the audience to make sure they watch such movies.\n\nHonestly, there is so much to say about Kashmir but I will keep this one short. I would just like to end this by again urging you all to watch this movie in large numbers and ensure that this does not happen again with anyone else.\n\n\nJaha shiv, saraswati, Rishi kashyap hue \nwoh Kashmir Hamara hai \n\n‡§ú‡§π‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§∂‡§ø‡§µ, ‡§∏‡§∞‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§§‡•Ä, ‡§ã‡§∑‡§ø ‡§ï‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§™ ‡§π‡•Å‡§è\n‡§µ‡•ã ‡§ï‡§∂‡•ç‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§∞ ‡§π‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ ‡§π‡•à\n\n\nHum bhi dekhenge\n\n‡§π‡§Æ ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ‡•á‡§Ç‡§ó‡•á'<br />Author: 'khubus_15'<br />id: 'tdex8c'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Maha Shivratri'<br />Body: "https://images.app.goo.gl/yW43eFGgmDKCeBMZ9\n\n#WHY DO WE CELEBRATE MAHASHIVRATRI?\n\nIn the daily hustle and bustle of life, we forget our source of energy - that which is running us. Mahashivratri is a festival to remember and to take our awareness to the basis of our existence: Shiva.\n\nBut, why is Shivratri celebrated? There is more than one Mahashivaratri story surrounding this occasion. Here are a few:\n\n‚Ä¢One is that Lord Shiva married Parvati on this day. So, it is a celebration of this sacred union.\n\n‚Ä¢Another is that when the Gods and demons churned the ocean together to obtain ambrosia that lay in its depths, a pot of poison emerged. Lord Shiva consumed this poison, saving both the Gods and mankind. The poison lodged in the Lord‚Äôs throat, turning him blue. To honor the savior of the world, Shivratri is celebrated.\n\n‚Ä¢One more legend is that as Goddess Ganga descended from heaven in full force, Lord Shiva caught her in his matted locks, and released her on to Earth as several streams. This prevented destruction on Earth. As a tribute to Him, the Shivalinga is bathed on this auspicious night.\n\n‚Ä¢Also, it is believed that the formless God Sadashiv appeared in the form of a Lingodhbhav Moorthi at midnight. Hence, people stay awake all night, offering prayers to the God.\nThese are some of the stories that can possibly answer why we celebrate Shivratri. But, what do we do during Shivratri?\n\n \n#WHAT TO DO ON MAHASHIVRATRI?\n\nMahashivratri is the day to honor and celebrate Lord Shiva‚Äîhonor life and celebrate existence. Most people spend the day of Mahashivratri in prayer, meditation and celebration. Here is a list of what to do on Mahashivratri:\n\n\n(1) *Observe fasting* \nOn the day of Mahashivratri\nFasting detoxifies the body and curtails the restlessness of the mind. A mind that is not restless slips into meditation easily. Therefore, fasting on Mahashivratri serves to detoxify the body and aid meditation. It is recommended to fast with fruits or foods that are easily digestible. Learn more about Mahashivratri fasting guidelines.\n\n(2) *Meditate on Mahashivratri*\nThe position of the constellations on the night of Mahashivratri is considered very auspicious for meditation. So, it is advisable for people to keep awake and meditate on Shivaratri.\nIn ancient times, people used to say, 'If you cannot meditate every day, do so for at least one day in a year - on Shivratri day - keep awake and do meditation'.\n\n(3) *Chant Om Namah Shivaya*\n‚ÄòOm Namah Shivaya‚Äô is the perfect mantra to chant on Mahashivratri, as it immediately elevates your energy.\n‚ÄòOm‚Äô, in the mantra, refers to the sound of the universe. It means peace and love. The five letters, ‚ÄòNa‚Äô, ‚ÄòMa‚Äô, ‚ÄòShi‚Äô, ‚ÄòVa‚Äô, ‚ÄòYa‚Äô in ‚ÄòNamah Shivaya‚Äô indicate the five elements - Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Ether.\nChanting ‚ÄòOm Namah Shivaya‚Äô harmonizes the five elements of the universe. When there is peace, love and harmony in all the five elements, then there is bliss and joy.\nAlong with OM Namah Shivay Chanting you can chant - Shiv Tandav Stotram and Kaal Bhairav Ashtakam\n\n(4) *Attend Mahashivratri Puja or Rudra Puja*\nRudra Puja or Mahashivratri Puja is a special ceremony performed to honor Lord Shiva. It involves singing special Vedic mantras accompanied by certain rituals. Rudra Puja brings positivity and purity to the environment and transforms negative emotions. Participating in the Puja and listening to the chants helps the mind slip into meditation effortlessly.\nMeditate to the chants of the auspicious Mahashivratri Puja at The Art of Living International Center, Bengaluru.\n\n(5) *Worship the Shivalinga*\nThe Shivalinga is a symbolic representation of the formless Shiva. Worshipping the Shivalinga includes offering ‚ÄòBel Patra‚Äô (leaves of the bel tree) to it. Offering ‚ÄòBel Patra‚Äô represents offering three aspects of your being - rajas (the aspect of you that is responsible for activity), tamas (the aspect of you that brings inertia) and sattva (the aspect of you that brings positivity, peace, and creativity). These three aspects affect your mind and actions. Surrendering the three to the Divine brings peace and freedom."<br />Author: 'Masulipatanam'<br />id: 't3nqgi'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm üïâÔ∏è</li>

My neighbors are Muslim and it confuses me.\n\nThe father looks like a typical minthu with his beard while the mothers looks normal. I saw that they have two daughters and while the mother and one daughter do not have hijab on, the other daughter is hijabi. The thing is they all look happy and i dont see that anything  bad is happening to the daughters.\n\nThey invited me to dinner and it all looks like a normal house. Even though I was scared they might trey to convert, I went as I didn't want to offend. Honestly, it seems less formal than the hindu house I grew  up in. Again recently they had a function in this s house and I saw that the hijabi daughter had brought a friend that looked like a transgender or some LGBT.\n\nEven though I am a single Hindu woman living far away from my small village, they haven't tried to convert me or do anything like that. I don't understand. I know that they pray, but they haven't tried to convert me.\n\nNormally, Muslim men here pray on Hindu girls so they can increase the Muslim population and genocide hindus, like what is happening in Europe where Muslims try genocide and replace european people. however, they have no son, so I'm thinking whether the father will always try convert me, but they don't. They never tried to convert.\n\nI don't understand, doesn't their religion ask them to convert everyone. By not trying to convert me, are they not committing sin? Doesn't that religion want to convert everybody?\n\nI really don't understand As they look like normal people, but how can they be normal people when they are following that religion. Also, the daughters look happy, soo I don't know what is happening. Why one girl wear hijab and other doesn't? Isn't hijab mandatory? if so, why isn't the father making the wife and both girl wear hijab?\n\nAre the not following their religion and therefore living is sin as the father does not make both the daughters wear hijab, also because the hijab daughters has a friend who is an lgbt and also because they have not tried to convert me?\n\nOr are they playing the long game, acting like normal people and then convert me?"<br />Author: 'Lucky_Celery5780'<br />id: 'sw9yqr'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Feminism, Women, and Jobs - The Irony.'<br />Body: 'Possibly a controversial post. So if you have a affinity for even the most basic form of feminisissym, please stay away. The post is quite simplistic for everyone to understand - don\'t nitpick stuff.\n\nAn economy\'s progress is highly dependent on its labour force. Very simplistically, a motivated and productive labour force helps to increase production of goods and services. A larger labour force usually corresponds to building a larger economy. In recent years, countries have faced a major issue - a significant segment of the population has grown older, and there aren\'t enough young people to replace them in the labour force. Fertility rates have been falling all over the world.\n\nEarlier, the labour force was made up predominantly on men, but as people get older, there aren\'t enough young men to replace the older ones. As a result, economic production is likely to slow down over time, while demand stays high as older people die much later (due to higher life expectancy).\n\nThe solution - include more women in the work force. The media called Shinzo Abe\'s strategy to include more women - "womenomics".\n\nThe irony is that women\'s rights activists, who usually bat for strong independent women, are ultimately making way for the elite to exploit women. The entire empowerment thing is a sham promoted by the global elite to lower the cost of labour, while keeping productivity high. Their experiments with robots didn\'t work out as well as they expected. \n\nBut ultimately, women working probably has more negative effects than positives, on a more granular level. \n\nAnd ultimately, even if you\'re worried about the economy, you\'re doomed - higher work means lower birth rates - implying that we\'re probably just borrowing economic growth from the future - unless we find another way to augment productivity.\n\nIn all, I just want everyone to understand the true nature of women empowerment. Rather than focusing on "Bhagwa feminism" like some idiots on here do, eschew it altogether. Placing economic growth above all else, is not the purpose of life - like the elites probably want you to think.'<br />Author: 'bhagwa_millenial'<br />id: 'sdwwpz'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: '1984 : Kaha Phas gaye yar !!'<br />Body: '  \n\n‚ÄúWar Is Peace. Freedom Is Slavery. Ignorance Is Strength. ‚Äú‚Äì George Orwell. \n\nPublished in 1946, Orwell describes a dystopian future (for his time) in the year 1984. Nukes have gone off and the world is divided between Oceania (Current USA &amp; UK), Eurasia (EU and Russia), and Eastasia (China &amp; Japan). Oceania is ruled by the ‚Äò‚ÄôINGSOC‚Äô‚Äô party (Short for English Socialism) and has Big Brother as the head of state. The book is written from the perspective of Winston Smith. It follows his futile attempt at breaking certain rules, his capture, and a total submission to the Big Brother at the end.\n\nThe book draws heavy parallels between Nazi Germany, and Stalin‚Äôs Russia. INGSOC is the worst of communism mixed with the worst of fascism. Big Brother as the totalitarian head of state with a heavy propaganda machine at his disposal is clearly inspired by Hitler. The mechanisms employed by INGSOC to control its population is Stalin‚Äôs playbook. People getting erased even for minute deviations from the normal, general hysteria for a never-ending war, citizen spies, and constant propaganda is straight out of the World War II era.\n\nWhat makes the book relevant in 2022 is the concept itself. Governments across the world have in the past and are in the present and will in the future watch its people. The irony is that people actually pay companies to track their information. (Cell phones and the Internet). Hyper-nationalism has made people gullible to anything the state wants them to believe. It is in the benefit of the state to keep its population distracted from facts to hide its failures.  Every state has a bogeyman to keep mass hysteria going. (USA: Communism &amp; Immigrants, India: Religion &amp; Pakistan). North Korea has gone on to copy INGSOC (Persecution for laughter).\n\nThe Oceania regime Orwell has described in 1946, can already be paralleled with 2022 politics. The top one percent controlling the narrative for the remainder of the population is no longer an imagination. Big Brother is watching every step that you take, and is influencing every decision you make. One needs to see through the state-run propaganda and focus on facts. Failure to do so would be no different than being a citizen of Oceania. Orwell quotes ‚ÄúThe Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power ‚Äì pure power.‚Äù. It was true for INGSOC, and it is true for every state power.'<br />Author: 'Pure_Plum_836'<br />id: 'ryk31l'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

OPPO also wants to add NavIC SMS (One-way messaging service - where people can be messaged - through satellite communication - even when the cellular network is not available) - again the messages are not sent by oppo - but by various government organizations - that handle the data - like INCOIS can send high wave/tide warnings etc.\n\n**So what is the security concern here :**\n\nWell none, tbh. Like phones support GPS (US), BDS ( **BeiDou Navigation Satellite** \\- China) - some manufacturers are coming up - to support - IRNSS -  **Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System /NavIC.**\n\nThis is not the first/one-of-a-kind deal - Xiaomi and Realme - already have NavIC support.\n\nIn January, Qualcomm announced that the devices powered by **Snapdragon 720G, Snapdragon 662, and Snapdragon 460 system**\\-on-chip (SoC) models will support Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) designed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). \n\n**What OPPO gets out of this :**\n\nGood PR - that\'s it. You can build NavIC support - without any such deal - but with such deal, you get the expertise of ISRO - to build the NavIC support in mobile. \n\n**What we get out of it :** \n\nPromotion of Indian technology and support - NavIC is indigenous - and we need to make sure more and more devices have inbuild NavIC support. \n\nAlso Oppo promise to build rapid, ready-to-use, end-to-end application-specific solution by integrating the NavIC messaging service with the mobile handset - which can lead to an increase in NavIC support amongst other manufacturers.  \n\n\nAnother question arises here - why are *western companies* (US giants) not actively perusing such a deal with ISRO ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Keep reading if you are a Tech Nerd and want to know more...***\n\n**Working of IRNSS:**  \n\nIRNSS space  segment consists of seven  satellites .In  this four satellites are available in free spaced to receive and transmit the Indian data within coverage area.\n\nThe  four  launched satellites  are  Geosynchronous satellites - there are  IRNSS 1A,  IRNSS  1B,  IRNSS 1C, IRNSS 1D . These  satellites are working in L  and S band frequency  and with carries navigation payload and C-band ranging transponder  used to determine the space craft  range  accurately. \n\nThree  IRNSS  satellites  are  geo-stationary and 4 IRNSS satellites are geo-system and two satellites are spare in free space. The IRNSS user segment consists of the IRNSS receiver and user community. The IRNSS receiver convert IRNSS signal into position velocity and time estimates.\n\n In a tracking operation minimum four satellites is required to find the exact position of a tracked object with an accuracy position.  The four satellites are required to validate for dimensions  of  x,  y,  z  (position)  and time arrival. The IRNSS-user receiver is placed at SET-JU to track the IRNSS satellites, GPS satellites and hybrid which are available in free space. IRNSS coverage area about 1500km around the Indian land mass (image credit from ISRO) The  IRNSS  satellite  is  used  for  tracking,  mapping, navigation and other services for users within the1500km coverage  area.  In  GPS  satellites  the  accuracy  of tracking  is  20m,  when  IRNSS  satellites  is  used  for analyzed the tracking accuracy reduce to 13.04m.\n\nSource : [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311216047\\_A\\_Comparative\\_Study\\_and\\_Performance\\_Analysis\\_Using\\_IRNSS\\_and\\_Hybrid\\_Satellites](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311216047_A_Comparative_Study_and_Performance_Analysis_Using_IRNSS_and_Hybrid_Satellites)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**NavIC Messaging Service (One Way Messaging) :**\n\n  \nNavIC Satellites have a message ‚ÄúType 18‚Äù in secondary navigation data for broadcasting text message.\n\nNavIC 1A satellite has been dedicated to messaging service .\n\nMessage data length can be ranging from 220 bits to 2220 bits.

<li>Title: 'In light of the recent "accident" involving the CDS Gen Bipin Singh Rawat, let\'s not forget the 1733 nuclear scientists, space scientists and armed forces engineers who have died of mysterious and unnatural causes.'<br />Body: "\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\nI am reminded of the Pulwama attacks and someone asked a dignitary after the maddening incident, what could be done to prevent it, and the man replied that this incident was given attention because many soldiers died on a single day, while one or two soldiers die every day in Jammu and Kashmir, and if we count their dead bodies from all the slow news days, the toll is higher than Pulwama.\n\n\nThe same has happened yet again. With the passing of General Rawat, spotlight will be again on the maintenance schedules of the helicopters and the pilot error and whose government put in the requisition of the helicopter and all that, but the point remains that General Rawat is just another body on a pile of corpses that have bit the dust for serving Bharat. \n\n\n##A whopping 1733 staff and scientists and armed forces personnel have died under mysterious conditions in just the past 20 years ‚Äì \n\n**680 scientists and allied staff from Bhabha Atomic Research Centre** have died of mysterious causes in the past. Most of these have been suicides. \n\n\n**10 scientists of Department of Atomic Energy** have died due to murders and other unnatural causes that include mysterious fires.\n\n\n**684 personnel of ISRO** have died of unnatural causes in the last 20 years. This includes 387 dead in the associate units of ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Centre, Space Applications Centre, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre.\n\n\n297 high level administrators have died working in the ISRO Headquarters itself.\n\n\nThe death toll may be way higher since the related organizations never reveal their staff who die of mysterious deaths.\n\n\nEven their death certificates do not specify the cause of death for security reasons.\n\n\n\n##Many of the causes of these strange deaths are disturbing and seem to be lifted from a cheap spy movie ‚Äì \n\nTwo Naval officers assigned as engineers to the freshly inaugurated nuclear submarine INS Arihant were found dead on railway tracks, run over by a train.\n\n\nMore than 100 staff and scientists of Kaiga Atomic Power Station at Karwar, Karnataka died and were hospitalised after drinking poisoned water from a water cooler in their office. Coincidentally Karwar also houses one of Indian Navy‚Äôs most expensive Naval Stations and also the most secretive one.\n\n\nL Mahalingam, a senior scientist from the same nuclear station went for a morning walk and never returned.\n\n\nMahadevan Padmanabhan Iyer, an engineer at BARC was found dead and heart attack was declared the cause of. But the autopsy later confirmed murder. He was allegedly a victim of a dreaded assassination experiment that caused a brain hemorrhage.\n\n\nOne such senior scientist has even survived a poisoning attempt when his dosa dish was laced. Fortunately the scientist working for the ISRO survived.\n\n\n##India has a history of losing important people to sabotage - \n\nAnd with regards to the government response, it seems that none of the governments want to reveal any foul play it seems. But this is not new. We know for a fact that Subhas Chandra Bose‚Äôs death was not natural and the government itself had admitted that declassifying that information would be detrimental to foreign relations with major ‚Äúallies‚Äù. He is reported to have died in a plane ‚Äúcrash‚Äù too.\n\n\nThen comes the deaths of Dr. Homi Bhabha and Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, who died of mysterious circumstances when away from the country. No government has attempted to declassify the investigations behind their deaths either. \n\n\nA few years after Homi Bhabha‚Äôs death, Vikram Sarabhai, the father of the Indian Space program was found dead in his hotel room.\n\n\nIt is to be noted that both Shastri and Bhabha died discussing the possibility of India‚Äôs first underground nuclear test. \n\n\n**It is to be also noted that Jawaharlal Nehru and M K Gandhi were both vehemently against the nuclear bomb and hence India never pursued it.** It was Shastri who wanted India to develop one after 1965 war. And when he flew to Tashkent to sign the armistice with General Ayub Khan of Pakistan, he was dead a day after the signing of the peace treaty.\n\n\nIt does not seem a surprise that a sitting prime minister has been betrayed by the Pakistani counterpart after signing a peace treaty. Vajpayee suffered the same result after coming from Lahore and then there was the Kargil War. Here too a General of the Pakistani Army backstabbed.\n\n\nThere is no question that a foreign hand is at play in the deaths of these esteemed individuals. The motive is simple ‚Äì to limit the capabilities of India as a space and nuclear power. The trend is very simple - kill the people who want India to progress forward, be it the leaders or the scientists taking the responsibility in themselves to further India's Nuclear and Space research.\n\n\n**There are multiple reports where foreign entities have meddled with India's capability to develop a cryogenic engine for itself, making deep space missions possible.** A report claims that Indian Space Program was set back by a whopping 20 years because of this sabotage. We are still working on perfecting the cryogenic engine.\n\n\nThe Indian Government must make sure that these sleeper agents trying to sabotage India‚Äôs sovereignty by assassinating key personnel must be apprehended and caught and dealt with a critical hand. \n\n\nWe cannot take this lightly anymore.\n\n\n*Aum Shanti Shanti Shantihi.*\n\n\n\nSources ‚Äì \n\n24 scientists and allied nuclear staff die due to mysterious circumstances - \n\nhttps://www.theweek.in/news/india/2021/01/06/from-the-archives-when-several-indian-nuclear-scientists-died-mysteriously.html\n\n11 top nuclear scientists died between 2009 to 2013, as per government data -\n\nhttps://www.ndtv.com/india-news/11-indian-nuclear-scientists-died-unnatural-deaths-in-4-years-1229793\n\n684 ISRO staff died in 15 years in this story filed in 2011 ‚Äì\n\nhttps://www.rediff.com/news/report/isro-mum-on-how-684-of-its-staff-died/20110113.htm\n\nA whopping 680 unnatural deaths at BARC - \n\nhttps://asiatimes.com/2019/07/indias-vanishing-nuclear-scientists/\n\nGregory Douglas, a journalist claims CIA hand - \n\nhttps://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/unnatural-deaths-1502589589.html\n\nSabotaging Indian Space Program's development of a cryogenic engine - \n\nhttps://www.rediff.com/news/column/who-killed-the-isros-cryogenic-engine/20131118.htm\n\nSenior ISRO scientist claims to be poisoned -\n\nhttps://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/someone-definitely-wanted-to-harm-isro-scientist-on-claim-of-being-poisoned/story-lcT2c9N3q7beGgWgeDQqKP.html\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0"<br />Author: 'Critavarma'<br />id: 'rbrgco'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Man does not live by bread alone. It is unwise to attribute all human behaviour to economic factors alone.\n2. The industrial age should be welcomed. Although handicrafts have their role in national economy and should be encouraged, machines should do national production on a large scale.\n3. Peasants and workers are the backbone of the society and should get reasonable share of national income, so that they can lead an average life, free from wants. Their villages need to be invigorated. Since they are part and parcel of the nation they should share the common duties and obligations.\n4. The interest of both the Capital and the Labour should be subordinated to the interests of the Nation as a whole\n5. The State would take every step to protect national industries from foreign competition.\n6. Key industries, manufactures and such other items should be nationalized if the National Government can afford to do so and conduct them more efficiently than private enterprise. The same principle applies to agriculture.\n7. All strikes and lockouts, which undermine and cripple national industries or production should be referred to State arbitration and settled or quelled if serious.\n8. Private property, in general, should not be violated. In no case, the State should appropriate private property without reasonable recompense.

There are 8 levels of recognition in the United Nations for any country, The topmost recognition is held by 5 countries only - the US, China, UK, France, Russia; Even India is not on this list. KAILASA has the PRELIMINARY nation recognition at the United Nations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nH.E. Sri Nithya Mokshapriyananda, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, Permanent Representative of Kailasa Nation to the United Nations representing the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism (SPH) Jagat Guru Mahasannidhanam (JGM) His Divine Holiness (HDH) Bhagavan Sri Nithyananda Paramashivam and the Permanent Mission of Kailasa Nation to the United Nations, is addressing the United Nations live.\n\nVideo link to the full LIVE video from the official UN website ( From 1 hr 24 min to 1 hr 26 min 20 sec ) :\n\n[https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1n/k1nlz2keec](https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1n/k1nlz2keec)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn behalf of all 2 billion Hindus, the KAILASA Nation presented to the United Nations about the persecution of Hindu Sampradayas in India during the 14th Session of the OHCRC\'s Forum on Minority Issues, Geneva, 2 and 3, December 2021.  The United Nations accepted the  KAILASA Nation and allowed KAILASA to present its case after the presentation from the Permanent Mission from India to the UN which focused on how Islamic and Christian minorities are safeguarded by the Indian Government.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Transcript of the presentation:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRespected Chairperson, esteemed delegates, and colleagues\n\nI represent the KAILASA Nation led by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism Sri Nithyananda Paramashivam which speaks on behalf of 2 billion practicing Hindus around the world who do not have a voice representing them in these International Forums.\n\nI want to specifically bring to light the attack on minority Hindu traditions inside India. Hinduism is not a monolithic religion but a collection of thousands of unique, enlightenment ecosystems called Sampradayas. In recent times many Hindu Gurus, Hindu minority traditions, and Temples have come under attack by majority ideologies and a large number of traditions have virtually disappeared.\n\nThere has been no recognition of the attacks in the first place by International Human Rights groups as in these cases it is difficult for outsiders to distinguish the attackers from the attacked.\n\nFor the past 10 years the KAILASA Nation and SPH Sri Nithyananda Paramashivam, have been attacked and silenced in India as a religious minority and a linguistic minority and because extremist elements are opposed to KAILASA‚Äôs stance when it comes to the rights of women, including otherwise marginalized Dalit women, and the rights of members of the LGBTQ+ and transgendered communities.\n\nIn 2019 KAILASA approached the OHCHR presenting the case of persecution. When this document reached the Indian media a well-funded defamation campaign was started by news sources supportive of the union government alleging treason and sedition on the part of Kailasa Nation. Again, a number of false cases were subsequently registered against the SPH and other KAILASA leaders, and one of our university campuses for women in the state of Gujarat was razed to the ground in a matter of days by mobs with the support of the Local Government.\n\nKAILASA has since submitted a number of reports on the persecution to various forums available within the UN but without much action taken.\n\nIn June 2021 KAILASA made a submission on the attacks on the ASMT women in the session by the UN Committee on Elimination of Discrimination against Women on the rights of indigenous women and further submitted reports on the steps to end Femicide and on Gender Justice. Later, in September,  KAILASA‚Äôs report, ‚ÄúMedia Disinformation in India‚Äù was accepted by the Special Rapporteur for the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the report on  the effect of COVID on minorities and the multilateral solution to the COVID crisis was accepted by  the UN Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order\n\nAttacks on minorities span multiple dimensions and early identification of these attacks is critical. We present the following recommendations based on our experience as a persecuted minority tradition.\n\n1.

We literally have female gods that are the centrepiece of Hinduism. This is the history of India up until very recently ~1608\n\n- Not sure of the statistics but the British took some trillions of dollars (adjusted for today) worth of jewels and resources\n\nNot only did they subject the innocent population of the nation to famines, extreme poverty, torture, slavery but they took away our advanced education systems, burnt our libraries and even threw in the occasional massacre.  \n\nSo such a drastic and traumatic event would obviously have caused generational trauma beyond calculation. \n\nOn top of all that they split the Hindus and Muslims into seperate nations before they left. Smart play because if they actually stopped fighting they could easily be the superpower but I digress \n\nI agree that this type of mentality is disgusting and needs to be addressed but what can you expect when most of these mfs can‚Äôt feed their kids let alone have the time to think about the rights of others and what they can wear \n\nI think the reason why videos like this hit us is because we live in a western first world bubble. We deal with people who are mostly politically correct and our issues are completely different. \n\nIt will take ages just how it has taken ages of negativity for it to get to this point but awareness should definitely be spread. Personally I think it starts with the education system but that‚Äôs a whole different topic. \n\nI also think these mentalities exist everywhere that there is poverty and ignorance but they are highlighted when it comes to India because of the sheer population and the negative filter of western media. I mean if you look at per capita stats India isn‚Äôt even top 30 and all of these so called developed nations have a higher rate.‚Äù\n\nI got bits and pieces of information from this sub over the months so just wanted to share this and say thanks for the inspiration. Honestly as a young expat, subs like these help bring me and I‚Äôm sure many others like me closer to our heritage.'<br />Author: 'skoobydoo_99'<br />id: 'r79ugj'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>
