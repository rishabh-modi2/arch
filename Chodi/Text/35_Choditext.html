<li>Title: 'The Ramayan TV show has ruined Hindi film songs for me forever'<br />Body: "I don't watch much TV and I haven't listened to the radio since my commute got cancelled due to WFH. I thoroughly enjoyed the rerun of Ramayan on TV with my family, and since then whenever I listen to the radio I can't help but notice that every single one of Hindi film songs is from Urdu-derived Hindi. Sanskrit-derived Hindi is basically nonexistent. I have observed a change in my own enjoyment level of a song just because of the words from the peaceful language. Anybody else notice this?"<br />Author: 'NewUser5391'<br />id: 'hy113f'<br />Flair :Rant</li>

<li>Title: 'Consistent downright denouncement of people who presented facts as Hindu Chauvinist or in present terms Bhakt/RSS/Hindutva'<br />Body: "I am currently reading **Hindu Temples, What Happened to them** \n\nThis text from chapter 10, vol 1 is strikingly similar to what we see nowadays whenever people try to debate and present facts.\n\n&gt;Many a time they have to resort to their imagination for supplying what should have been there but is missing.\xa0 All they seem to care for is building their own reputations as historians of Hindu art.\xa0If one draws their attention to the mutilations and disfigurements suffered by the subjects under study, one is met with a stunned silence or denounced downright as a Hindu chauvinist out to raise 'demons from the past' with the deliberate intention of causing 'communal strife'.\n\nThere is a major Stockholm Syndrome among Hindus which the authors described in this text from chapter 6, vol 1. The striking similarity in present times is baffling.\n\n&gt;Hindus have lived under very trying circumstances for many centuries and during this time their psyche suffered much damage.\xa0 Short term tyranny may prove a challenge but long-term, sustained tyranny tends to benumb and dehumanize.\xa0 Under continued military and ideological attack, many Hindus lost initiative and originality; they lost naturalness and self-confidence; they lost pride in themselves, pride in their past and in their history and in their nation.\xa0 They learnt to live a sort of underground life, furtively and apologetically.\xa0 Some tried to save their self-respect by identifying themselves with the thoughts and sentiments of the rulers.\xa0 They even adopted the rulers contempt for their own people. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not ready to accept the cost of distorted historical facts taught as part of curriculum for some utopian idea of secularism and social harmony."<br />Author: 'sochaAccountBanaLoon'<br />id: 'hxroah'<br />Flair :Butthurt OP</li>

All under the same symbol, the so called, holy, Christian cross.\nSame goes with the Islamic phrase "Allah ho Akbar" and the famous Shahada(displayed on Saudi flag),  Most tyrannical of the regimes today, who strip minorities and women of their rights, use it as symbol and they exist in this modern world.

<li>Title: 'CCP exit plan'<br />Body: "This is pure speculation.\n\nThe CCP officials are planning their exit.  Like the nazis who hid out in Argentina and other places in South America, the CCP are moving their funds, manufacturing identities and undergoing facial reconstruction, so that they can hide in plain view in friendly countries.  \n\nMore importantly, the CCP is taking advantage of the floods and the droughts and they are making things worse every day till it reaches a humanitarian crisis level.\n\nThey have their extraction teams in guise of rescue workers ready across the world.  When other countries realise that CCP has abdicated, and people are suffering, they will swoop in to help the chinese people.  In that process, amid the general confusion, all the criminal CCP officials, will get extracted and moved to their new identities.\n\nOne big reason to think this is how gradually there are posts that are saying 'chinese people are not ccp' and 'blame the ccp but not the chinese'.  The sentiment is not the problem.  The problem is that the sentiment goes without saying.  No one equated the german people with the nazis.  No one equated the iraqis with Saddam Hussien.  No one equated the Cubans with Marco Polo or whatever that guy was called.  The point is that nobody has to say it. The fact that there are people saying this on social media points directly at the CCP propaganda machinery at work.  Only they would think of running a campaign to influence the people so that they would pressure their governments to go help the chinese people.\n\nAnyone who says 'Chinese people are not CCP' is both a moron and a CCP shill."<br />Author: 'ekdhyan'<br />id: 'hvpbv3'<br />Flair :CKMKB</li>
<li>Title: "Let's settle this once and for all. Should hinduism be a religion or not. Should we lump ourselves into the group of the abrahamics by calling ourselves a religious people or call it a spiritual way of life which is aimed at utmost freedom of an individual."<br />Body: 'I am of the opinion that by calling our dharma as a religion we lump it together with the dogmatic abrahamic religions that force their followers to follow some random rules without any tarka(logic) behind any of those rules. They do it just because some book contains it.\n\n\nHinduism has never had a book or a dogma. I\'m pretty sure all of you already know that the word hindu itself is a foreign word and doesn\'t originate in samskritam. The culture has evolved a lot through many years and many schools of thought. It is vast, diverse and inclusive of many different thought processes. All of these ideologies were made to describe human existence and were methods to realise the self. \nPeople who did realise their self became mahapurushas(rama krishna etc) and are now worshipped by us in temples. \n\n\n\nOther than these mahapurushas we worship the vedic deities that are personifications of nature and other important stuff that is responsible in one or the other way to sustain human life like wealth and weapons and so on. \nThis is blasphemy under any "religion". A religion requires to completely submit yourself to this all powerful god and nothing else. \n\n\n\nNow why is it important that we do ont lump ourselves with these dogmatic losers. \nThe world now is fastly turning into an atheistic society solely dependent on science. The youth all over the world are rejecting religions. In these times the great scientific, philosophical and spiritual work done by our  ancestors will all be rejected by the young people of today because to them it will seem like religion. \nNo matter how logical and beneficial stuff from our culture is, it will seem like senseless dogma to the common public and they will be encouraged to reject without even giving it a chance.\nMost of all, by calling it a religion we will be working against the cause of what we were born in bharata to do. People are born here to attain moksha by completely freeing themselves not by tying themsleves down to rules.\n\n\n\nSome arguments I hear for why we should call ourselves a religion is to protect our places of worship. \nLet\'s be real here, no govt is willing to do anything for the Hindus in terms of places of worship. Temples are a vast resource of wealth which are flooded with the donations of the devotees. This is a major income booster the govts and they will never let the temples be independent.\nJust by calling ourselves a religion we will gain absolutely nothing. \nThis is all I have to say, what are your thoughts? Let me know I\'m still very open minded about this.'<br />Author: 'SantaphiliaHUB'<br />id: 'hvlaea'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li>

<li>Title: 'United as Hindus. Not by Varna or Jāti.'<br />Body: "Just pasting my comment here from one of the posts to make more people aware. The topic is that many people in the sub are holding ideology of following varna or caste system. And I think we must not divide ourselves in varnas because the time has changed.\n\nPeople from different varnas are doing different jobs. And they are no way willing to accept it. They recognize themselves according to modern caste system. Are Brahmins going to accept Dalits who are in higher position in various sectors? I'm sure Dalits would accept Brahmins doing labour work (which itself is hard to find).\n\nPlease dont spread this Varna ideology. We have already been divided enough. Savarkar's work shouldn't be wasted. Kindly read his 'Six Golden Pages of Indian History'. He brilliantly points out what mistakes we Hindus have been doing till today. And caste is the major factor in it. Savarkar called it Seven Shackles. \n\nAccording to Savarkar, the Hindu society was bound by seven shackles ( bandi ) viz. prohibition of touch (sparshabandi) of certain castes, prohibition of interdining (rotibandi) with certain castes, prohibition of intercaste marriages (betibandi), prohibition of pursuing certain occupations (vyavasayabandi), prohibition of seafaring (sindhubandi), prohibition of rites sanctioned by the Vedas (vedoktabandi), prohibition of reconversion (shuddhibandi) to the Hindu religion."<br />Author: 'boywhospy'<br />id: 'hvddoy'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: 'Oh dont mind me im just passing by..(um ok i sent this to my friend. She is secular)'<br />Body: "Fun fact: all the mųslims  residing in bharat(bharat a.k.a india, pakistan, afghanistan, bangladesh, mayanmar and neighbouring countries) were all hindus once. These poor people got forcefully converted to įslam by the invaders. They havent realised that yet. Their ancestors were hindus infact. I really pity them. Knowingly or Un-knowingly they follow ïslam even though their past were horrendous. They are the ones who truly sufferrd from this genocide of   îslam. It is our duty to educate them because we are lucky that we did not get converted. Know this.. there wer no müslims b4 the invasion. Můslim ppl did not come from sky and settled here. They carry the blood of hindus. Its only logical to think that they wer hindus once. Tbh this scene looks like a disaster to me. But them being ignorant is what aches the most. Such blind faith in any religion is dangerous to humanity itself. That is y hinduism(sanatan dharm) is beautiful. It allows every question and provides answer. No intolerance. Although i think at this age of kaliyug a hindu must become a militant. At this age it is a threat for their own identity. I mean have u ever given it a thought? Y the world's oldest civilisation is still alive? Because we have dharma . A law to be followed for the welfare of the society. There was a fuckin bloody war to save dharma. Can u give me any name of a country at this age wer hindus are a majority or population atleast more than 30%?  The only country left is india .  Understand that fact. Only 1 country in this world for hinduism. Either others are atheistic or islam or christian country. The dharm which taught the whole world has no place. Yes hinduism is the only religion in the wolrd which talks about the universe. Bhagawat gita is the only book wer krishna says I AM GOD. With a given identity. No other books says this. We had to fight for freedom for our country? From foriegn invaders we had to save our land?\nTemples give money for govt. for tax but no church and mosques are allowed to give? Is this secularism? Is this y u sent me that photo of a man hugging a muślim? In mosques it compulsary for kids to learn quran but it is prohibited in temples to learn vedas and upanishads. Wtf? Why? Why us?u know why? Because we are peaceful. This is wer tge problem lies. Jainism is kept in high regard for non violence. But wat will u do if u wer born in pakistan. No church no temples. U are a kafir. In quran it is permitted to have a kafur woman as a sex slave if she isnt accepting islam.u me and all hindus are fortunate to have been born in this land. Eevn if u put up non violrnce against such action will this stop happening? These laws are ancient. It was held for people wen there was only our dharm. Times have changed. U wud have eating beef if u wer in pakistan or u wud be killed or u wud be kept as sex slave(sorry for abrasive langiage but its the truth). My mssg to īslam is do watevr u want but dont convert and dont kill. We are not kafirs. And then they will play victim card that minority are opressed . Hear this out: the day they become majority it is the end of dharma, end for u and me and all tge loved ones.pls stop secularism and save culture. Wat was the take away from this mmsg? *We are fighting for our own rights*\nIsnt it?\nDo you know wer the problem lies? We are not taught wat has been written in the scriptures. Atleast not me. We just want to sit and watch FRIENDS and other series, idealise the west. Eat french fries,  do make up. Travel europe and join iit, ditch the country and work in a foriegn firm like a slave and we question y india is still a developed country. Y all people here are money mongers.

<li>Title: 'How to bring out the truth?'<br />Body: "**Let’s  discuss some things, which are very important to keep our country  safe  from internal threats. Yes, despite what you think we are in a  great  danger and I will explain how.**\n\nRight  now, as I see it there is a  temporary pact between the anarchists,  communists and certain Religious leaders which is really unstable. All  of them are trying to fool one another. Communists see this pact as  their way to power. Anarchist see it as their way to Freedom and  Religious leaders see it as their chance  to realize their prophecy and  dreams. ***In The 2020 Delhi Riots***,  the  Anarchists and Communists lost their control which they had on  religious leaders, The religious community hijacked it by planning their  own deadly stunt,  Which resulted in deaths of many people.\n\n**Why are they, so powerful?**\n\nThey  have a political ecosystem which is funded by many enemies of our  country. Money is laundered with the help of N.G.Os and religious  donations.Not just that, They pay celebrities, activists, influencers,  reporters and news networks to further their plan. They have to show  their loyalty from time to time by responding, so they don’t lose their  perks. While most people are blindly supporting these ideologies, as  they have been fed the wrong information. The people who are at  forefront of this are  doing it for power and money.\n\n**What is Political Ecosystem?**\n\nPolitical Ecosystem: It is a community of people, Individual networks which help each other to propagate their ideas.\n\n**Why should we be worried about this “Political Ecosystem”?**\n\nToday  many  Indians have access to fast Internet connection which helps  spread  information quickly. But the most used Platforms are already  filled with propaganda spreading Individuals. Countless news websites  and news  networks are also doing this, and they are all part of this  Ecosystem,  If you don’t agree with them, they will attack your personal  life. They  literally have control over trends on social media. Day by  day critical  thinking is being perceived as hateful. Unless of course  you do it  selectively against, the majority population.\n\n**Do we need this kind of structure too?**\n\nYes,   but it will be nearly impossible for someone like us to do something  this huge. I have heard the arguments made against it by Anand  Ranganathan, but I think it is naive to think that way. Having no   ecosystem is the reason why people hesitate to go against   pseudo-secularists. People like True Indology can’t even reveal  themselves because as soon as they do that, They will be attacked. Our  country does not allow full freedom to express ourselves either.\n\n**What can we do?**\n\nWe can build a small community. which will play a bigger role.\n\n**How to start?**\n\n1. First step is to create content.\n\na)  Get into writing and write  articles with sources and data. There are  many websites which accept  articles from individuals who write opinion  posts. Write cultural blogs,  make news websites.\n\nb)  Make YouTube channels and either report or talk about the related   topics. If Again, you are not confident enough about your safety, make   just voice-overs or if you don't want to make voice over use text with   pictures and explain the topic. Please do it anonymously because the   last thing you want is to be arrested.\n\nc)  People who are good at debates and making points should write cheat   sheets to help others argue on topics but please don't try to prove something which is false into truth. The last thing we want is people   cherry-picking our arguments and portraying us in bad light.  I will   help to answer some arguments. Maybe start compiling arguments from the hijacked subreddit and make a list?\n\nd) Create surveys and create statistics with that data ! The more data sources you create the better it will be.\n\ne)  Make memes like you always do! Many people don't like to read long  paragraphs like these but they do get influenced by humor. Red pill  everyone with your awesome memes.\n\nf)  Gather artists who can produce stuff in bulk when needed. Cartoonists,  concept designers, music producers everyone should be welcomed. Support  them if you can.\n\ng) There is lot  of fake information on Wikipedia which needs to be fixed but for it to  stay there for long time we need some old Wikipedia accounts with good  records. Makes yours now and wait.\n\nh)Document  everything on Twitter, learn to archive even Reddit and  YouTube. Many  people just protect their tweets and comments which expose  their  hypocrisy so instead of just screenshotting it which can be  faked,  learn to archive it. I remember a famous political YouTuber  making fun a  person with disability. I did not archive it and I think he  deleted  that comment Now.\n\n2) Organize Funds\n\nSave money because you will need it for leasing servers and domains, paying artists, supporting your favorite content creators.\n\n3)Organize  yourselves.  Plan ahead of time. You guys have discord right? Start  from there. Just  make sure there are no snitches in that chat who will  screen shot it.\n\n4) Be active in online debates or public if you can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(Note when you pay a PayPal user his first and last name is revealed so please use fake name if you don't want unwanted attention from vultures. Don't disclose private information when buying domain.

<li>Title: 'Liberandu satire from The Hindu, posted today on r/india'<br />Body: '&gt;The Chairvirus of the COVID-19 Task Force explains the reasons behind their spectacular success in India in this exclusive tête-à-tête  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I’m thrilled to present to you my greatest journalistic coup yet: the world’s first interview with SARS-CoV-2-XUV-700. This is not just any coronavirus but the Chairvirus of the virus community’s COVID-19 Task Force. I must record here my gratitude to Potangoli Pvt Ltd for sharing with me a special bio-genetic software that enabled me to bypass the communication barrier between humans and viruses and conduct this historic interview. Edited excerpts:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** Thank you Mr…should I address you as Mister or Ms or..?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** The virus community is stringently opposed to any form of discrimination or identification based on gender, sexual orientation or heteronormativity. We are fully LGBTQIA-plus-plus-compliant. However, to keep things simple, you may call me Shrimati Shrimati SARS-CoV-2-XUV-700-ji.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But if that causes symptoms of breathlessness, say ‘Corona Madam’.  \n**Me**: Corona Madam, let me start with a personal question. In the good old days, viruses had such exotic names — Chikungunya virus, Chandipura virus, Uukuniemi virus, West Nile virus. I mean, who wouldn’t want to meet the West Nile virus? Or get a taste of Tuscany from the Toscana virus? But nowadays you’ve gone fully alphanumeric! It’s all HIV, HAV, H1N1, SARS-CoV-2. You have 10 gorgeous species of rotaviruses. But their names? They are called A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. Why?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** We viruses have long outgrown the primitive human proclivity for names loaded with meaning. Some human societies, for instance, call themselves a democracy. Does that mean they actually are a democracy? On the other hand, a virus by any name would be as infectious.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me**: It’s nearly six months since you entered the Indian market. How has the journey been?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** Well, the April-June numbers have just come in and I’m happy to share that our quarterly results have exceeded our top line and bottom line projections. On all the key growth parameters — number of infections, mortality, rate of transmission, and public relations — India has been our biggest success story.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** What’s the secret behind the COVID-19 success story in India?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** Before coming to your country, we’d heard a lot about Indian hospitality. *Atithi devo bhava*, right? But none of us expected such a fabulous reception. All the clapping, the lighting of candles, the sheer human warmth, and everywhere we went, encouraging chants of “Go, corona, Go!” — you guys made us feel at home. We finally realised what your PM meant when he said the ‘ease of doing business’ in India is unmatched by any other country.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** Really?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** Yours is the only country that has implemented every single one of our recommendations.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** What recommendations?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** India is a large country, but its cities are not well connected with the hinterlands. We needed help in rapidly expanding our geographical footprint. So we suggested a unique lockdown model wherein migrant workers in cities are forcibly held back for a few weeks in overcrowded conditions where chances of infection are high, and then gradually allowed to disperse to villages across the country. Your government loved our suggestion. India’s unique, zero-notice lockdown gave us the initial boost we needed — a generous seed fund of infections — in order to become *Atmanirbhar* in India.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** You mean, India’s lockdown was your idea?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus***(smiling):* We do our homework.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** But the logic of a lockdown is that it makes it difficult for you guys — sorry, you girls — to infect more people. So why would you recommend it?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** We figured that whether it’s a pandemic or Pangong Tso, so long as we let your government score propaganda victories, we can do whatever we want.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** Why does this logic sound familiar?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** Back where I come from, it’s common sense. Anyway, to answer your question, we made a deal with your government. We said, “Look, we’ll save you from having to spend big money on public health, hospital beds, testing capacity, nurses’ salaries, etc.” How, they wanted to know. We said, “Do a draconian lockdown — it will cost you nothing, but it will look like you’ve taken decisive action. We’ll manage the rest.” So, we let your government control the narrative, and in exchange, our best ever performance came under your lockdown.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** I see. So you really are a Chinese virus, aren’t you?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** Viruses don’t subscribe to national identities. But yes, I do sometimes consult for the PLA.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** You betrayed us!And to think we trusted and encouraged you!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** I’ll say this much. Despite my place of origin being China, I’ve never felt discriminated against in your country. All I’ve ever received, from the people and the government, is love, and for that, every single coronavirus will always have a soft corner for India in its RNA.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** Ok, this interview is over.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus** (*laughing*):Cool.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** Why you laughing?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** Your mask!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** What’s so funny about my mask?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Virus:** It’s the way you Indians wear masks. And then you blame us when you die!\n\n*G. Sampath is Social Affairs Editor*, The Hindu.'<br />Author: 'rothi_mantra229'<br />id: 'hu16mb'<br />Flair :Randia Simulation</li>

I am not comparing India and Pakistan, of course India is way ahead in everything and in my opinion we should compare ourselves with the likes of China, Japan, USA etc.\n\nPakistan has nearly 9 times the area of South Korea and yet its GDP is 17 percent of that of South Korea.\n\nThey could have established themselves as a manufacturing hub, given their young population and being part of OIC. They have a stable demography, their minority don\'t impede government schemes and mooch off from welfare unnecessary.\n\nPakistan could have been a tourism hub with developed sites like Taxila, they could have made big bucks by facilitating Hindu pilgrimage sites like Punch-Mukhi Hanuman Mandir in Karachi. \n\nA famous museum could be built with various historical artefacts found across Pakistan. Instead of breaking centuries old statues just because some illiterate maulvi told them to, they could have placed that statue inside that non-existent museum. I am sure they would find large amount of historical evidences given their "Indus Valley" roots.\n\nSindh could have been made world largest financial hub, something like Hong-Kong. A world class port could have been developed in Karachi, given its location.\n\nInstead they kill poor minorities and blame everything as "yahoodi sazish".\n\nI guess, Madarsa grade education combined with 7th century mindset produces a failed state like Pakistan.'<br />Author: 'Frosty_War'<br />id: 'htl4zc'<br />Flair :Rant</li>

<li>Title: "BBC with it's anti-indian coverage"<br />Body: "British Indian here, my hindi isn't that strong.\n\nThis article and video was published recently:  [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/newsbeat-53395935/south-asian-anti-black-racism-we-don-t-marry-black-people](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/newsbeat-53395935/south-asian-anti-black-racism-we-don-t-marry-black-people) \n\nWhile I agree with some of the points, I hate how this is perceived to be only an Indian problem, they don't want to ruffle feathers with any other country (read Chinese Asian or Muslim countries). Furthermore they have taken well a meaning Gujarati man to deliver this message, he makes good points and it's good to nip this intolerance in the bud however they don't look into why these views are there? He doesn't know and just thinks it starts with the Indian community.\n\nHow about 200 fucking years of colonialism from the whites? Who ran slave trades out of India, where white was right, similar to how 100s of years of slavery has left a mark on the black community, so has the brutal ruling of India. I will concede that the caste system may have something to do with it, as people who would be darker in India would've worked manual labour as opposed to the former who wouldn't be as dark.\n\nAlso these views on black people specifically, where did they come from? Aside from the minuscule black community that the majority of India hasn't interacted with, many Indians wouldn't have come across black people. So where did they get these thoughts from? From other racist white people, that's who. Who had golliwogs, cartoonised black people and a propaganda of anti black rhetoric? White people. The British Indian community that immigrated learnt this from the locals and american Hollywood, same with the Indians back home, all they saw from america was white people in lead roles and all this old racist subtle messaging. \n\nI am wanting to right a letter/email to the BBC about this, not to silence them because the substance is true and silencing makes us seem weak, we have to accept our mistakes but i will not stand for the propaganda, we need to correct them about where this came from. I know this isn't the oppression Olympics but my god did they and the afghans fuck our beautiful country for far too long to not be held acceptable for it.\n\nApologies for any mistakes in the typing, i'm too heated rn to care. \n\nJai Hind."<br />Author: '1337k1d'<br />id: 'hrtix5'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: 'Flip Side of Mahatma Gandhi'<br />Body: "Reasons for killing Mahatma Gandhi:\n \nDuring the trial justice Khosla had allowed Nathuram Godse the killer of Gandhi to read his own confession in the court.\n\nHowever the Indian government had banned the confession of Nathuram.\n\nNathuram's brother Gopal Godse fought a 60 years legal battle after which the Supreme Court removed the ban.\n \nNathuram had given 150 reasons for killing Gandhi; some of which are as follows:\n \n1. In 1919 people of India wanted General Dyer to be tried for the Massacre of innocent people at Jalianwalla Bagh. Gandhi refused to support this demand.\n\n2. Whole of India wanted Gandhi to intervene and save Bhagat Singh,Rajguru and Sukhdev from the Gallows. Gandhi stubbornly refused on the grounds that they were misguided freedom fighters, and theirs was an act of  violence.\n\n3. On 6th May 1946 on public platform, Gandhi asked Hindus to sacrifice and not fight the members of Muslim league. In Kerala Muslim league members killed over 1500 Hindus and converted 2000  to Islam. Instead of protesting Gandhi expressed that it was a brave act of Allah's followers.\n\n4. On several occasions Gandhi called Shivaji, Maha Rana pratap and Guru Govind Singh as misguided nationalists.\n \n5. Gandhi advised Raja Harisingh of Kashmir to abdicate as Kashmir had Muslim majority ,and settle down in Kashi. Raja Harisingh on the other hand he supported the Nizam (Osman Ali Khan ) of Hyderabad to join Pakistan , even though the state of Hyderabad\n(Andhra , Telangana ,Karnataka and Berar) had Hundu majority. Sardar Vallabh bhai Patel however over ruled Gandhi. When Nehru heard of Patel's police action in Hyderabad (operation POLO) he disconnected his telephone with Patel.\n \n6. In 1931 the congress committee on designing of Indian flag suggested that the flag be only in saffron. Gandhi insisted changed it to a tri-colour flag.\n\n7. During the Tripura congress , Subhash Chandra Bose was elected as president with majority however Gandhi supported Pattabhai Sitaramayya forcing Bose to resign.\n \n8. On 15th June 1947 during congress conclave it was decided to resist the partition of India but Gandhi went to the meeting at the\nlast minute and supported the partition. Infact it was Gandhi who had declared earlier that partition will take place only over my dead body.\n\n9. Sardar Patel was elected by majority as the first Prime Minister but Gandhi insisted on Nehru .\n \n10. Nehru government had decided to reconstruct Somnath Mandir at its cost but Gandhi without even being a member of the ministry forced the Govt. to reject this proposal. At the same time on 13th January 1948 he went on a fast to allow Muslims to repair the mosque in Delhi at govt's cost.\n \n11. When Hindus refugees returned to India after partition, some of them took shelter  in some mosques temporarily. When Muslims objected ,Gandhi forced all such Hindus children,ladies and the old to leave the mosque and live on the streets.\n \n12. In October 1947 Pakistan attacked Kashmir, Gandhi went on a fast and forced the Indian Govt to pay Pakistan a compensation of Rs.55 crore. Gandhi did not mind hurting Hindu feelings to win over the Indian Muslims.\n\nNathuram Godse and Narayan Apte were hanged on 15th November 1949 in the Ambala Jail in Punjab.\n\nFound this at a post somewhere, and would appreciate if chodi bhratas can help find references to these from respective books"<br />Author: 'ManikManson'<br />id: 'hrjp50'<br />Flair :Unverified</li>

<li>Title: 'Tiger Parenting / Authoritarian Parenting'<br />Body: 'The very moment I see \'Indian\', I know you have been abused. In India, you will be judged by the Indian society as horrible and ungrateful if you tell them that your parent might have abused you. Indian parents often resort to physical, verbal, mental, emotional abuse; mostly because they have been raised that way. This is a stupid backward society which keeps on practising the authoritarian system of parenting despite being a democracy. Your parents are pure narcissists who I know for a fact are highly toxic and simultaneously brainwash you into being grateful for providing you with basic amenities, something which all parents do and are legally bound to. Oh, btw, you were simply meant to be your parents\' retirement plan that they have invested in you, nothing more than that, if you have Indian parents that is. Just cut off all contact from your toxic af Indian parents. \n\nThey show you off to their peers and ironically, claim that your achievements are a result of their excellent parenting. It like beating the shit out of a dog to train him jst to win the local dog competition and bear the "best dog trainer" title. Everything revolves around reputation in India. This has created self-centred bastards everywhere in India who can go to any extent in order to uphold/improve their reputation and to flaunt/boast themselves by being condescending to others. This is also misused by a lot of Indian parents. Initially they shout at and beat the child when the kid makes a mistake. Later on in their lives they become completely intolerant and start abusing their kids for almost no reason whatsoever. They derive pleasure by bullying their kids. As an excuse they say that they have a short temper and can\'t control it. Do not fall for their shit. They think of you as mere extensions of themselves and ignore or crush you individuality. Your parents are horrible, abusive, toxic, inhuman and rotten to the very core of their existence. Avoid contact with them as much as possible or even better, cut off those toxic bastards out of your life, go NC (no contact). I hope you have a happy future.\n\n\\~Best wishes from a fellow Indian sufferer'<br />Author: 'singhabhisekh'<br />id: 'hqx1ug'<br />Flair :Rant</li>

<li>Title: 'We need to change out education system. Now!!'<br />Body: "I was recently shocked to know that Islam and its philosophy is taught as a history chapter in class 11 in the CBSE curriculum. Although I don't object to that specifically but what beats me is that there is no mention if Hinduism anywhere, leave alone its philosophy, or the vedic culture from ancient India. How can we expect children to be aware of their true identities if they are being taught philosophies that are not only controversial and contradictory but also inflammatory, misleading, and extremely brainwashing. \n\nThe need of the hour is to significantly change our school education system so that it accurately reflects our profoundly rich ancient culture and wisdom from the vedas. An education that brings values and wisdom from the vedas and intermixes them with modern day technological ideas and sciences will not only eclipse the knowledge that we are able to access today but it will eventually make better human beings out of the next generations. An education of such a kind will ensure that the next generations are not only innovators and world leaders but they are responsible and good human beings who cherish their values more than their money and property. \n\nBefore learning how and when an another religion came into being, we must be aware of what our culture and traditions are and how they came into being. Instead of begin taught how and why the taj mahal was made, we must be informed about how and why the Ellora caves and the sun temple were built. Instead of learning what Ramzaan is, we must be taught what navratre and karva chauth really are. In place of killing and eating animals for religious celebrations we must learn to respect and treat them well. Instead of marrying four wives to increase population for religious gains, we should be taught to love and respect one person while responsibly conserve the resources of mother earth for future generations. \n\nWe need to change our education system. And we need to do it NOW!"<br />Author: 'eucliditorian'<br />id: 'hqau21'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>

<li>Title: 'Thoughts on Vikas Dubey case'<br />Body: ' As someone from the region, I’d like to share few thoughts on the entire episode. No, these aren’t some hidden stories that hitherto have eluded the public narrative, but more as a commentary on present socio-political discourse of the state.   \n \n\nFew things first-\n\n1. A criminal has a finite life cycle. So while it is important to realize the moment to seize opportunity to ride the coattails of power echelons, equally vital is to know when you are beat—that is, to understand when your ‘services’ are no longer useful. Failure to realize this ensure that the cold confines of the morgue is the only destiny of the said criminal, with how many body part remain intact being the only variation. \n\n2. Yes, criminal has a finite life cycle, but not the crime. It will remain till the time power struggle, and in turn humanity, remains. Truth be told, some people are needed to enter the underbelly of the society, just as sanitation workers are needed to clean the sewer beneath the beautiful cozy societies. \n\n3. But these underbelly dealing can often be ugly, to the society that is increasingly been softened by the easy technology fueled lifestyle. After all, the last thing the powers that be need for these dealings going wrong out in the open, resulting in gore, splattered brains and entrails, and thus the PTSDs in masses. So you need intelligent methods of power struggles, dealings and negotiations, bait, buy and sell and what not—to minimize the sordidity in the open.  As an example, watch this video to understand how these things happen--   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yttc5-3KG0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yttc5-3KG0) \n\n4. Lastly, order is very important for the society to function. Yes, chaos are important at times for the Khadi-Tie (politician-businessman) but in a controlled fashion. To be honest, a lot of drama is controlled, events managed (and sometimes staged) for several reasons. Funnily, even Societies need some Masala to function, as too much ‘stability’ can lead to depression—Denmark, Iceland, I am looking at you. De-escalation ramp is managed so that everyone has something to gain. And this holds true for small time politician-mafia-business nexus gone wrong, to larger geopolitical tussle such as the current India-China face off. After all, what is the use if things go uncontrolled to the point of no return? Instability is good for none.  \n\n\n(Contd. in comments)'<br />Author: 'PaKtionablevidence'<br />id: 'hov02s'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion</li>

Reservation is for representation and only representation.**\n\n\nIt's not me who's saying this, it's all those people who says that Creamy Layer SC/STs still discriminated.\n\nA peon refused to share his water with IAS officer who belonged to SC category because peon is a upper caste.\nThe IAS officer got benefit of reservation and still got discriminated is shows that reservation doesn't stop discrimination.\n\nIf a person is studying with me in same class and I am not discriminating against that person it's not because the person got the seat because of reservation, but because I find it morally wrong to discriminate, my parents don't teach me to discriminate, it's not because of reservation but moral ethics.\n\nI show even these types of arguments on our President Ram Nath Kovid's video where he's touching the feet of his teacher that ***Bjp forced him to touch the feet of the teacher who are actually the teacher's from RSS sponsored school (Adarsh vidhya Mandir),to show Indians that even a Dalit becomes the President he still has to touch the feet of uppercaste***\n\nIt's not reservation which decreased the reservation in last 70years but the social campaigns which are there to show/teach the wrongs happened to a person because of his caste.\n\nAbout marriages, same thing is applied reservation will not help inter-caste marriages.\nThere are government initiatives which promotes intercaste marriages, reservation has nothing to do with this.\n\nAnd today there are many people in every caste , I am stressing every caste including SC category in which there is sub-caste discrimination exist (there's a part of it in Article 15 movie), believes in caste but doesn't believe in caste based discrimination.\n\n It's same as religion , most of the Hindus has no problem with Jains they don't discriminate them , there's no common inter-religion marriage among these religions. But they believe that it's different religions. \n\nAlso even Tamil Brahmins will not marry a Brahmin from North India, this doesn't mean it's discrimination.\n\n***Reservation is not for to end castes, or discrimination based on them. Reservation is for representation and only representation.***"<br />Author: 'RandomCitizenOfMars'<br />id: 'hol4qn'<br />Flair :OC है बे!</li>

First add creamy layer in General category. - *General is not a reserved category, and there's EWS reservation*\n\n2. I support creamy layer in SC/ST from all the categories, some reserved category candidates shared there own experiences.\n\n3. I don't support this because there's still discrimination and people don't marry into another caste - *reservation is not for matrimony and discrimination, reservation is for giving more representation to particular communities and to give resources and opportunities. There's SC/ST atrocities prevention Act for discrimination*\n\n4. There are very few rich people in SC/ST category, most examples in.comment are anecdotal. Not more than 1% of SC/STs are rich and have all the resources to compete.\n\n- **Okay I believe you only 1% of SC/STs are rich and have resources. So What about creating separate reservation for those 1% people . Today at central level 22.5% is reserved for SC/STs , 1% of 22.5 is 0.225, but let's make it 10% 2.25 , okay just round it to 2.5%.**\n\n\n****So, what if 2.5% is given to those anecdotal 1% SC/STs and remaining 20% to rest of poor SC/STs(99%).\nWhat's your Opinion now??****"<br />Author: 'RandomCitizenOfMars'<br />id: 'hnuzmj'<br />Flair :OC है बे!</li>

<li>Title: 'Why the idea of adding creamy layer to SC/STs is so hated?'<br />Body: "TL;DR  \nI don't get why if someone talks about adding creamy layer to SC/ST is labelled as castist or just privileged if the person belonged to same group.  \n\n\nI know that reservation is for representation and not a poverty eradication program, but giving more opportunities to poor SC/STs doesn't decrease the representation from that group.  \n\n\nbecause the idea of reservation is to give a equal platform to people who are not given platform in past and who are completely deprived from that opportunities and resources.  \nBut now we all know things has changed a lot from the past although not completely but significantly.  \n\n\nwe can take many examples but I would take the most famous example, because it makes me sad when a person thinks that he/she is there not because of their hardwork and talent but because of the caste they are born in which is just labels IMO.  \nTina Dabi - her grandfather both maternal and paternal are working in government offices. Both of her parents are engineers , father in Indian Telecom Services and mother is IES.  (she took voluntary retirement , so she can help Tina give more time to her studies. I can see \\*\\*Brahminical Patriarchy\\*\\* here), and I am assuming that if you have that background , you are fairly rich and maybe come in the top10% rich in India.  \nso , she's not a SC person who can't afford resources and facing major daily life problems which a poor SC person faces.  \nI know she's a Topper, but she still cleared the CSE Pre just because of SC reservation, she only cleared the SC cutoff (that's her strategy she didn't give Pre that much weightage because she want to focus on Mains and just want to clear the cutoff for Pre).  \n\n\nSo, my question is why a person who have almost same resources as any other caste/religion/tribe person needs reservation more than a person who don't and belongs to SC/ST community.  \n\n\nI don't have problem with Tina Dabi , I respect her , she has done wonderful job in Bhilwara during Covid early stage.  \nMy problem is we have limited college seats , limited jobs , limited opportunities . So why a person who benefited or not need that extra push get those benefits and who don't have the resources has to compete with them.  \n\n\nA poor SC candidate who's working hard for the one seat one job is not competing against a General OBC ST candidtae but competing against the rich SC who has all the resources to get benefit of 15% quota.  \nAnother example of Rajasthan there is 12% ST reservation but of this reservation most of the beneficiary are from single caste which is even not a Tribal caste i.e \\*\\*Meena\\*\\*. (Meena caste included by typist mistake as a Tribal caste)  \nSo, Is it not unfair to other Tribal caste in Rajasthan that all the fruit of reservation is taken by a single caste which has enough resources which they (other tribal castes) don't have.  \n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*I will give one more example. There are 100 apples, and the distributor set aside 25 apples for a particular village because it's far away from the distribution center. \n\nSo, the policy of distribution is first come first serve. So, that particular village which is far away from the center has 500 people who wants that apples\n\nBut the thing is out of these 500 peoples some has Cars , some has Bikes, some has cycles and most of them are just walking towards the center, and some are they want the apple but can't leave their house because they had to take care of family members. \n\nSo as we know there's only 25 apples are there specially for the village they can take more than 25 if they reach first there, So people who came in Cars and Bikes took the all 25 apples.  \n\n\nAnd the rest of people who came on bicycle or just bare foot walking , are as it is before there were apples , with no apples. And because they know all the apples will be taken by the people who have Cars and Bikes, they not gonna try again because why would you walk so much to get nothing.  \n\n\nSo, even after many attempts by the distributor there are many people who can't get any apples, and still thinks that the apples are not in their reach.  \n\n\nNow, questions may arise why there's only 100 apples, why everyone doesn't have a car, why there's no bus service, why the village is so far away from the distribution center etc etc. Yes , having only 100 apples is also a problem, Yes have no bus service is a problem. And we should improve these things.\n\nBut it still doesn't solve the present problem of a few people enjoying the fruit because they have resources to reach those places fast.\\*\\*\\*\\*  \nTL;DR  \n\n\nBy applying creamy layer in SC/ST will not hurt SC/ST but will do more wider benefit to newer people who don't have resources."<br />Author: 'RandomCitizenOfMars'<br />id: 'hne0xx'<br />Flair :OC है बे!</li>

Russia will deliver S-400 Missile Defence Systems a year early to India, despite strong objections from Beijing. China had been pressuring Moscow against the early shipments.

<li>Title: 'India DID NOT WIN the 1971 war with Pakistan. Read below.'<br />Body: 'India did not win the 1971 war. It just stopped fighting in the middle of the war. And as such it was a total failure for India and a long term victory for Pakistan.\n\nPakistan surrendered in Bengal. Not in punjab. We did not even make the return of PoK as a condition of ending the war. We did not impose any economic or military sanctions on West Pakistan as a condition of ending the war.\n\nSuch conditions are the perogative of the victor. To ensure that the enemy, in exchange for being spared, has to concede to a number of terms that take away its power to cause trouble for you again.\n\nWe extracted no such concessions. \n\nWe could have demanded that the return of PoK, unlimited access for Indian trade to cross Pakistan to Iran and central Asia, opening up of the Pakistani economy to Indian trade, restriction on the Pakistani military in the number of soldiers, officers, tanks and aircraft it could have, disbanding the Pakistani navy permanently and acknowledgement from Pakistan that Kashmir was an integral part of India, including PoK. \n\nWe did nothing. Nothing. We just ended the war. And gave back 90,000 Pakistani prisoners of war for a worthless agreement that the Kashmir dispute would be solved bilaterally.\n\nWhat the hell was that? If nothing else, we could have ended the Kashmir issue there and then. We didn\'t even do that. \n\nWe just accepted the surrender in east Pakistan and closed the chapter. \n\nBecause the reality is that Indira only wanted enough to establish herself as the iron lady in the minds of Indians. She achieved that. She threw India and its future under the bus. And left Pakistan able and free to acquire nuclear weapons, which ensured we would not get the chance again, not for 50 years, perhaps never, and left Pakistan able to start terrorism campaigns across India, which it did, from punjab to kashmir to SIMI. \n\nAnd now we run around stroking ourselves about our supposedly great "victory".\n\nIt was not a victory. It was a betrayal. And has cost us so heavily that today we are surrounded and besieged internally and externally totally by the intense and devastating terrorist and diplomatic operations that Pakistan has been running against us after we ran away in 1971.\n\nWake up.\n\n*Taken from Harbir Singh\'s Facebook Post*'<br />Author: 'dukegabon'<br />id: 'hkl51a'<br />Flair :CongressKMKB</li>
<li>Title: "A rebuttal to liberals' charge that Brahmins monopolized and controlled knowledge and education in India"<br />Body: "On the universality of knowledge in India, some say that the Vedas and their recitation were ‘monopolized’ by Brahmins *(paraphrased)*.\n\nThis is an absurd charge, and not because it is wrong.\n\nThis is like saying that scientists monopolize NASA; or molecular biologists monopolize molecular biology; or quantum physicists monopolize quantum physics.\n\nIn a classic division of labor, India had divided society into four Varnas and Brahmins’ lot was to further the knowledge tradition of India.\n\nThis DID NOT mean that others were barred from having knowledge.\n\nThis only meant that a particular way of pursuing knowledge: that is by reciting the Vedas and conducting Yajnas was reserved for the Brahmins and not others.\n\nOthers could gain knowledge in many other ways from Kathas, from Ramlilas, from other Natyas, from music, from poetry, from story-telling, from architecture, from sculpture, from other fine arts, for every discipline in India was geared towards Advaita, towards the Ultimate Knowledge.\n\nIt was just that a particular technical way of conducting a very technical ritual: that is Yajna and another very technical activity: that is reciting the Vedas was prohibited to all except the Brahmins.\n\nAnd what is wrong in that?\n\nThis is like saying that anyone with no study and degree of science should be published on quantum physics or molecular biology in their esteemed journals! Or that a poet or a businessman should be allowed to design the rocket to take our satellites to Mars!\n\nDoesn’t that sound ridiculous?\n\nThen why all this fuss over ‘Brahmins monopolizing knowledge’?\n\nTo repeat, they did not monopolize knowledge, but certain technical means of furthering it. To put it in other way, once an aspect of knowledge had been codified and researched, everyone could take benefit from it through the agency of various vehicles designed specifically to take knowledge to the masses – like Natyashastra which has its stated goal to take the knowledge of the Vedas to the masses.\n\nBut to let anyone interfere with the process of creating and codifying knowledge would have meant the very destruction of the tools to gain knowledge. It would be like a postman designing the rocket at NASA.\n\nPursuing knowledge was considered not just a very important activity in India, but THE most important activity and an entire class was dedicated to it. For pursuing it in the most refined manner this class evolved a complete way to do it, an elaborate terminology, a vast repertoire of various different ways to approach ontology and epistemology, a grammar to comprehend it, a language to express it. It was impossible to do it for any other person who was employed in earning the daily livelihood. Only someone completely dedicated to the study of knowledge would be able to do it. Letting others do it would just mean the destruction of the means of gaining knowledge. This is why there was a prohibition on the 'means of knowledge' - but NEVER on knowledge itself.\n\nBut who cares about logic when ideology is at hand?\n\n*Taken from Satish K.

And another of my rants which a lot of you could find "rAnDiA SiMuLaTiOn? "\n\nSo, I have been following bhagwa feminism sub for a while now and I just got to know its creator and mods are men! I feel cheated. I am shaking and angry after knowing this. They have been insinuating that it is for women and though I saw a few men commenting I thought it was fine, maybe some are following out of "curosity". I also do not know if this subs mods and that ones are same or know each other and I do not care if I get banned from both.\n\nDear women on this sub, if you follow that sub please know this truth, that men are moderating it. I am angry because I was almost going to share a personal  experience which was similar to the incident mentioned in the news.\n\nI dont understand why men feel entitled to give direction to women? As an aware Hindu Sanghi woman, I feel, I have to battle on two fronts, I have to battle misogyny and ignorance from men whom I share my ideology with and then simultaneously fight left liberals too.\n\nThis doesn\'t arise from just a one off incident. I am a part of one of the sister organisations of RSS and recently there were some developments there, which irked me and irritated too and while the men in the group felt differently, I talked to my female professor-like mentor, quite aged, about it and we both felt the same. Even when the first seminar concluded, I could see women of all age groups, still left unanswered because main speaker ne wohi purane ghise pite dialogues chipka diye aur ye nahin bataya ki woh sab, jo required h krna, woh krne ke baad bhi unn questions ko, unse arise hone wali problems ka kya karein? Kyunki woh sirf male community ko address krke change ki ja skti hai. \n\nDecade after decade, I see the same old tradition of schooling women about the culture and the traditions and umpteen number of rules to abide by. While I find it extremely absurd, because all around me I see aware Hindu women, doing that and much more already. What I don\'t see is men modifying for better, even the ones that I share my ideology with! They\'re the same, entitled kinds! They don\'t want to be sensitized, they don\'t want to end their ignorance or aware themselves about a number of everyday problems faced by women and just, look through a different perspective.\n\nDear centre to right, aware Hindu men, you could be different from liberals. You could behave differently and act mature. However I do understand it is quite impossible to achieve on social media platforms, but if you want to stand out, you should try. When women vent their frustration about the unfortunate-biased-ghastly incidents of their life, don\'t parade around with "this is misandry" and "not all men". Ofc not all men, it is a given. WE KNOW THAT. But this absolutely looks like you are belittling her struggles and the disgusting experiences she has to carry all her life.\n\n#enough of gaslighting'<br />Author: 'paharganj2paris'<br />id: 'hje21c'<br />Flair :Rant</li>

<li>Title: 'What a Genius of a Poet Bhāravi is!'<br />Body: '  \n\n**Bhāravi (**भारवि)\\~ A 6thCE Sanskrit poet. His famous work is Kirātārjunīya ( Of Arjuna and the Kirāta) which is in 18 cantos.\n\nIt is noted among Sanskrit critics both for its gravity or depth of meaning, and for its forceful and sometimes playful expression. \n\nHis poetry is characterised by its intricate styles and ethereal expressions. Like **Kālidāsa-**Upamā Kālidāsasya and **Daṇḍin**\\-daṇḍinaḥ padalālityaṃ similarly his work is said to be arthagauravam (Weight of meaning).\n\nThe *Kirātārjunīya*  "is regarded to be the most powerful poem in the Sanskrit language". A. K. Warder considers it the "most perfect epic available to us", over Aśvaghoṣa\'s *Buddhacarita*, noting its greater force of expression, with more concentration and polish in every detail. Despite using extremely difficult language and rejoicing in the finer points of Sanskrit grammar, Bharavi achieves conciseness and directness. His alliteration, "crisp texture of sound", and choice of metre closely correspond to the narrative.\n\n**The literary Genius of his work Kirātārjunīya\\~**\n\nThe work is known for its brevity, depth (*arthagauravam*), and verbal complexity. At times, the narrative is secondary to the interlaced descriptions, elaborate metaphors and similes, and display of mastery in the Sanskrit language. Notably, its fifteenth canto contains *chitrakavya*, decorative composition, including the fifteenth verse with "elaborate rhythmic consonance" noted for consisting of just one consonant: \n\nन नोननुन्नो नुन्नोनो नाना नानानना ननु ।      na nonanunno nunnono nānā nānānanā nanu ।  \nनुन्नोऽनुन्नो ननुन्नेनो नानेना नुन्ननुन्ननुत् ॥       nunno\'nunno nanunneno nānenā nunnanunnanut ॥ \n\n *Translation*: О ye many-faced ones (*nānānanā*), he indeed (*nanu*) is not a man (*na nā*) who is defeated by an inferior (*ūna-nunno*), and that man is no man (*nā-anā*) who persecutes one weaker than himself (*nunnono*). He whose leader is not defeated (*na-nunneno*) though overcome is not vanquished (*nunno\'nunno*); he who persecutes the completely vanquished (*nunna-nunna-nut*) is not without sin (*nānenā*). \n\n The 25th verse from the same canto is an example of the form of verse that the Sanskrit aestheticians call *sarvatobhadra*, "good from every direction": each line (*pada*) of it is a palindrome, and the verse is unchanged when read vertically down or up as well: \n\n \n\nदेवाकानिनि कावादे                                                                                 **de  vā  kā   ni   ni  kā  vā          de**    \nवाहिकास्वस्वकाहि वा ।                                                                           **vā**   hi kā  sva  sva  kā hi            **vā**   \nकाकारेभभरे का का                                                                                **kā**  kā  re  bha  bha  re  kā        **kā**     \nनिस्वभव्यव्यभस्वनि ॥                                                                              **ni**  sva  bha  vya  vya  bha  sva  **ni** \n\n(and the lines reversed) \n\ndevākānini kāvāde                                                                            **ni**   sva  bha  vya  vya  bha  sva  **ni**   \nvāhikāsvasvakāhi vā ।                                                                      **kā**    kā  re  bha   bha   re     kā    **kā**   \nkākārebhabhare kā kā                                                                     **vā**    hi   kā   sva    sva   kā    hi    **vā**   \nnisvabhavyavyabhasvani ॥                                                             **de   vā   kā   ni      ni      kā   vā   de** \n\n *Translation*: "O man who desires war! This is that battlefield which excites even the gods, where the battle is not of words. Here people fight and stake their lives not for themselves but for others. This field is full of herds of maddened elephants. Here those who are eager for battle and even those who are not very eager, have to fight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n The 52nd verse of the 15th canto is an example of *Mahāyamaka*, or the great *Yamaka*, where all four feet of the verse are the same, but each foot has a different meaning \\~\n\n विकाशमीयुर्जगतीशमार्गणा विकाशमीयुर्जगतीशमार्गणाः ।         \nविकाशमीयुर्जगतीशमार्गणा विकाशमीयुर्जगतीशमार्गणाः ॥ \n\n vikāśamīyurjagatīśamārgaṇā vikāśamīyurjagatīśamārgaṇāḥ |  \n vikāśamīyurjagatīśamārgaṇā  vikāśamīyurjagatīśamārgaṇāḥ ॥ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n *Translation*: "The arrows (*mārgaṇāḥ*), of the king (*jagatīśa*) *Arjuna* spread out (*vikāśam īyuḥ*).

<li>Title: 'BEWARE : CHINA will just remake the banned apps under a different name and market to the same people boycotting them.'<br />Body: "These 59 banned apps served a purpose. As long as people need that functionality, developers will keep making them. China is already known for copying other countries' state secrets. How long will it take for them to copy their own apps, and sell them under a different name ?\n\nJust be aware of the country of origin of each app and it's developer before installing. We can proactively ask each app publisher to display an 'About Me' page verifying their credentials."<br />Author: 'waeva2'<br />id: 'hi6eit'<br />Flair :CKMKB</li>
<li>Title: 'Help needed. I missed Mahabharat on TV. YouTube print has issues like missing audio and syncing on some episodes. Can someone post a link please?'<br />Body: "YouTube has that pen watermark and SRK's face before every episode, which is very irritating. In some of the earlier episodes, entire acts of an episode had no audio and had to rely on subs. Also, when something moves too fast, everything gets all wavy. \n\nWere these issues in the Broadcast as well? I couldn't watch it because we don't have cable in my house.\n\nIf someone can post a link here, or PM me it would be really nice. A download link would be more preferable. I don't care if it's technically illegal. I don't mind large sizes if the quality is also good.\n\nI hope mods don't remove my post."<br />Author: 'chintan22'<br />id: 'hi5z0p'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li>
