One that spans from Afghanistan to Burma.\n\nMy input would be that as a true Sanatan Dharm Rashtra, we should be inclusive of everyone and anyone (religion included), with certain exceptions such as people who wish to defeat the purpose of this Bharat (as an example).\n\nInstead of Death Penalties, we need to have rehabilitation and de-radicalization programs, instead, focus on community service so that every person serving in "jail" will also be a member of building our society and being responsible for it.\n\nSTEM subjects need to be given great importance with the motivation of old scholars like Aryabhata, Panini, and others. However, we should also give equal importance and focus to other areas of education like Arts and Commerce.\n\nWe also need to be a beacon of hope to cultures other than our own, such as the old African religions, and Native American religions, because I personally believe that they are another sect of Sanatan Dharm due to what they believe in (such as the Sun, Animals, etc).\n\nLet\'s keep this civil and hear inputs from everyone'<br />Author: 'AQuarantine'<br />id: 'k2m352'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

With Current Muslim fertility rate, look at area after 200 years. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 If you have no problem with constantly living in fear like Pakistan/Bangladesh and your daughters/sisters being forcefully abducted and clad in burqa, ignore this msg.  I have no problem with any religion but it is about Survival now! In many part of India rural areas Muslims are making Masjid next to the the temple, this is all being done in a planned way so that they can demolish the temple and take it over when time comes. We are keeping snake in our home and its just a matter of time, I am pointing to the radical Muslims, but guess what a secular Muslim also never criticize the wrong doing of a radical Muslims which bothers me. Within Hindu community you won't find that. By the time Hindu realizes it will be too late. It is very high time to bring the common civil law on the table because with this fertility rate of Muslims in our country Hindustan will soon become Muslistan. Please share your views and comments regarding our survival."<br />Author: 'mangames'<br />id: 'k21x9w'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li>

<li>Title: 'Seizing the means of production'<br />Body: "We often see how the leftist claim that for the revolution to be successful, the proletariat must seize the means of production from the bourgeois.\n\nIt is true, and we must listen to this advise. The bourgeois are a group of unelected induvidual who decide what to produce, how to produce, when to produce. They live off the exploitation of the proletariat, who are the majority in the world.\n\nIn the modern India the same is happening. The academic printing press and institution like colleges and think tanks are run by a small elite whose ideology is defunct and is rejected by the electoral. The total seats all the communist combined won in Lok Sabha after all the efforts were 5 seats. But most of the Prof who are living of Govt salary are communist, the newspapers are run by leftist editors, the academic press succumbs to the leftist pressure. \n\nThis must change, the many should gain control over the means of production. There is no issue with people have opinion, but the issue is when the small elites suppress the voice of the majority. Two prominent examples are coming to my minds. \n\nThe first is a recent one of Jordan Peterson wanting to publish a self help book, and the leftists literally started crying and wanted to cancel his book publishing [https://www.foxnews.com/media/penguin-random-house-staffers-reportedly-breaking-down-crying-over-publishers-release-of-jordan-peterson-book](https://www.foxnews.com/media/penguin-random-house-staffers-reportedly-breaking-down-crying-over-publishers-release-of-jordan-peterson-book)\n\nThe second one is the Delhi Riots book that was pulled out in the 11th hour [https://www.thehindu.com/books/bloomsbury-says-it-wont-publish-book-on-delhi-riots-after-social-media-backlash/article32420501.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/books/bloomsbury-says-it-wont-publish-book-on-delhi-riots-after-social-media-backlash/article32420501.ece). \n\nIn Peterson's case, his previous book was a mega hit with 5 million books sold, making it one of the best sellers of this century, so it was a common sense decision to give him a new contract 50 lakh legally purchased books. Mazak thodi hai. Delhi Riots book was a super hit by Indian standards as well. The authors were not known public figures, yet their book crossed the 30,000 mark within the first few days, and I am not sure about the exact details, but people in online were saying books above 15,000 sales are considered as hits.\n\nIf the few elite wield enough power to shut down the voice of many, then should't by the communist logic they must be opposed. What do you think the outrage would be if book publishers stopped leftist writers from publishing because the right wing did not like? \n\nThere is only solution that I could think of. The majority must not buy books from the institution that panders to the elites. The book publishers who give equal opportunity to the many must be accepted. \n\n**You already vote with your feet when you move from a socialist city/state to a capitalist one like Bangalore, Hydrabad, Mumbai.** \n\n**You vote with your eyes when you made all the elitist visual media journalist lose TRP and start their own Youtube channel because no one was watching them and they were fired.** \n\n**You already vote with your hand every five years in the election.** \n\n**Now start voting with your wallet, and only support the printing press that supports your views.  Be it in form of purchasing books, or giving ads to print sources.** \n\n**Denounce the other sources like the leftist elites denounce yours.**"<br />Author: 'RKO_12'<br />id: 'k214wz'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

It took me more than a week to get back to normal. \n\nThe worst part was when I got the details like how Burkha Dutt was giving away the information to Pak handlers, Mahesh Bhatt, Digvijay Singh etc releasing a book blaming RSS for the attacks. This pissed me off and kept me angry for several months. I'm still fuming as I think about the events that occurred.\n\nWhere were you at the time when the attack happened and how did you cope up with that?"<br />Author: 'deeplead'<br />id: 'k178t6'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: 'Why do Right-wingers not understand this simple thing?'<br />Body: " \n\nThackeray Sr. was just an all talk guy and only used Hindutva for his selfish need for power. He was just an opportunist, he first tried to garner power and support using Marathi-regionalism, but after Bombay-state dissolution via Mahagujrat Movement and Samyukta Maharashtra movement, the public didn't care much about that topic. Later on he noticed, Hindu Nationalism was on the rise, so he jumped on this bandwagon of Hindutva. Again once the issue of Bihari/UP immigrants came, he started using the Marathi-regionalism for his benefit. If he was so virat, he wouldn't have allowed 26/11, 93' blasts and many other radical islam-induced things to happen, or if it was out of his control, at the least he wouldn't have allowed so many Bangladeshi Rohingyas to enter Maharashtra (Mumbai folks especially know what I'm talking about). Not only this, Shivsena totally hindered the progress of Mumbai's development by their control on BMC (which is probably the shittiest municipal corporation ever, probably even some poor country of Africa would have a better municipal corporation). Also, it's no open secret that many Mumbai politicians (including Shivsena) were hand in glove with Underworld crooks like Haji Mastan, Dawood, etc. With so many flaws, I don't understand why the right-wing community praises this guy so much that he's now considered a Hindutva icon. Maybe it's because there are very less Hindutva icons so we always look eager to declare a personality as one at the slightest opportunity.\n\nTL,DR : Thackeray Sr. was all talk, no action opportunist and only slightly better than current ShivSena"<br />Author: 'PotentialBattle'<br />id: 'k0ye3x'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li>

Everyone work under him except Sonia Gandhi.\n\n2. He was owner of most of the madarsas in India. His family members are VC of Deoband institutions. His cousins run chain of madarsas.\n\n3. He and Farooq Abdullah share family relations. He had links in Kerala. He was  gateway of Arab money to India.\n\n4. He controlled entire media chain. He is the one on whose command Vineet Jain thrown Arnab out from Times Now. His people are placed in all the channels.\n\n5. There are fleet of corporate cadres under his influence like Nilekani, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Narayan and many NGO runners.\n\n6. He was  the one who backtracked three orders when RAW had got Dawood. From Samjhauta, Ajmer to Mumbai blast, he managed everything from media narrative to Home ministry.\n\n7. He recruited everyone between 2004-2014 from judiciary, secretary to media editors.\n\n8. You can imagine his power that he jailed sitting Home Minister Amit Shah for more than 4 months and his entire state\n intelligence team for 8 years led by DIG Vanzara. He was so powerful that he grilled sitting CM Narendra Modi for 13 hours. He compelled Amit Shah to leave Gujrat.\n\n9. He was the man behind Augusta Westland to Spectrum. He was prime broker. Sonia Gandhi favored Ahmad Patel more than Rahul Gandhi.\n\n10. He openly captured 44 MLA and had wasted crores in resort. Neither media nor law asked him how he could do that.\nHe is not in power though he had shown his power when he required 45 votes knowing that he would get 44 votes only. He went to EC and EC disqualified 2 votes within hours. Video shows no malpractice and one can check the video. Despite the presence of NDA cabinet ministers Ahmad Patel made sure EC make him winner.\n\nThis is equal to winning of a state election. He reduced Congress from 57 to 42 but Congress made sure he wins. He was the lifeline of Sonia Gandhi\n\nRIH'<br />Author: 'civ_gandhi'<br />id: 'k0uq94'<br />Flair ::Whatsapp: WhatsApp Forward</li>

<li>Title: 'PES University Bangalore taking major health concerns'<br />Body: 'Greetings bhratas.\n I am a student of PES University, Bangalore. \nI am writing this mail because of decisions taken by our college management which I feel have not been appropriate from an academic point of view as well as keeping the current pandemic in mind. These are some key points:\n\n1) There are two mid-semester exams in each sem taken by our college. Till last semester it was computer based mode but from this semester itself they have made it pen-paper mode. Though they have given an option to skip it and directly give End Semester exams (ESA) with an increased weightage, but it\'s still all in OFFLINE MODE. Best of two offer for the first time has been announced for college for students giving ISA, leaving us in dilemma to go to campus or not. 2nd ISA is currently happening in campus.\nLabs have also been made offline.\n\n2) ESA is scheduled in December MANDATORY IN OFFLINE MODE. For the namesake of giving option, they have given us a chance to either give it in December or in next semester along with that semester exams. It is almost impossible for a student to give 2 semesters\' exam together. So practically it\'s not an option and forcibly all of us have to give exams in December in campus. \n\n3) When most other colleges have much before declared that all of their college activities would happen via online mode, PES has chosen not to even consider the option. A huge number of students study here and from all across India which makes it very difficult as well as risky to go to college.\n\n4)  Since August, Hostel Management have taken decisions that are not student-friendly. Today most students have paid the hostel fees and are in hostel right now. No SOP is being followed in the hostel, students are sharing rooms, attendance daily and mess coupons distribution weekly through queueing or grouping. No social distancing is being followed/enforced.\n\n5) Consent form is being taken from student\'s parents but the form is very unclear. It talks about classes but not exams however, the exams are the issue. College clearly wants to force people to make a decision but not have any liability on themselves. \n\n6) College is allowing students to enter even WITHOUT COVID TEST report. People are even producing month old tests which college is encouraging/ accepting. There have been numerous incidents where students are gathering as they believe college is taking precautions. There is no enforcement of Social Distancing either.\n\n7) Covid Testing was done on the college campus in one location with no social distancing. However one student from that area has tested positive and many students are yet to get their results, yet college is still allowing them to write their exams. The college has been completely ignorant about the fact and does not respond to us. \n\n8) Since a long time, we students are trying to contact our college management and convey our concerns. But each time they neglect us. There has been minimum communication whereas, during a pandemic, it should be ample. The only communication is a monthly live session where they have a one-way conversation with the students. \n\n9) Parents and students have sent mails across to our higher management as well which have been ignored. There has also been a case where one student received a reply in error where the pro-chancellor has asked the faculty to ignore the mail and "move it to spam"\n\nAll these things have led to a lot of fear among students and parents. It is adamantly clear that the management is not following the SOP\'s in place and therefore are putting our health at risk. \n Students have to travel all across from India risking their lives just to write exams when there is an alternate option available (online), which is being taken by other colleges. The Covid situation in Bangalore is not very good. We have seen and even have photos of people gathering in college but college authority takes no action regarding it.\nThe entire student community is very tensed right now. People living away from home are afraid of what to do if something were to happen to them. \nI am writing to you in hope that you will surely look into this matter and help all of us and our guardians. \nWould eagerly wait for your response.\nThanks'<br />Author: 'apookash55'<br />id: 'k05ve1'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li>

<li>Title: "The sad reality of the Indian 'Independence' Movement"<br />Body: "When we Viraats think of the the Swatantrata Andolan we are quick to blame Gandhi, Nehru, INC in general, CPI, Muslim League. However, we won't talk about Subhas Chandra Bose. Unfortunately the sad truth is that apart from Savarkar, a few Hindutva thinkers, and some crypto-Hindutva people in the INC (who generally had limited influence in the grand scheme of things), most of the major leaders had been either socialists of idealists. I had thought Bose was better but always had a sneaky feeling that he wasn't given that he had approached the USSR first and that Azad Hind Fauj's name and many songs were in Urdu. Recently I was send this blogpost about him on social media, I suggest you take the time to read it as it is quite big in multiple parts. [https://bharatendu.com/2011/02/10/subhas-chandra-bose/](https://bharatendu.com/2011/02/10/subhas-chandra-bose/)\n\nAmbedkar in his book on the partition had studied the Islamist mindset in depth and that is why the book provides a very logical understanding of how partition and the idea of Pakistan came to be and why most Hindus felt betrayed or were refusing to believe what was happening. (Not read all of it but got this much from the first two chapters). This limited understanding of the world stems from the idea of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam as we keep thinking that we should bring everyone along with us on our journey while others have already 'othered' us and not only want nothing to do with us but are even willing to be malicious against us. Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam is an idea with merit but it requires Hindus as a society and India as nation to be in a position of power. It is an ideology that may be adopted and promoted once India is a superpower in her own right not when we are working on an equal level with other countries. Sorry to digress, my main point is that while Bose certainly did damage the loyalty of the Indian army to the British, his ideology was bad and some of the actions that resulted from this had far-reaching negative consequences even in achieving his own aims (read the part of the blog that goes into what happened during the war)."<br />Author: 'thesaffronarmy'<br />id: 'k02u7i'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: 'What ambedkar said about a hindu sangathan or Hindu unity and the problems which make hindu sangathan impossible.'<br />Body: 'I know some here don\'t like ambedkar because he was critical of hinduism and hindus.\nLet\'s keep that aside for a moment and see what he had to say on hindu unity /sangathan.\nHe does have a point here about why hindus and "a hindu" is weak.\n\nShuddi here means reconversion or ghar wapasi\n\n&gt;The reasons which have made Shudhi impossible for Hindus are also responsible for making Sanghatan impossible. The idea underlying Sanghalan is to remove from the mind of the Hindu that timidity and cowardice which so painfully make him off from the Mohammedan and the Sikh and which have led him to adopt the low ways of treachery and cunning for protecting himself. The question naturally arises : From where does the Sikh or the Mohammedan derive his strength which makes him brave and fearless ? I am sure it is not due to relative superiority of physical strength, diet or drill. It is due to the strength arising out of the feeling that all Sikhs will come to the rescue of a Sikh when he is in danger and that all Mohammedans will rush to save a Muslim if he is attacked. The Hindu can derive no such strength. He cannot feel assured that his fellows will come to his help. Being one and fated to be alone he remains powerless, develops timidity and cowardice and in a fight surrenders or runs away. The Sikh as well as the Muslim stands fearless and gives battle because he knows that though one he will not be alone. The presence of this belief in the one helps him to hold out and the absence of it in the other makes him to give way. If you pursue this matter further and ask what is it that enables the Sikh and the Mohammedan to feel so assured and why is the Hindu filled with such despair in the matter of help and assistance you will find that the reasons for this difference lie in the difference in their associated mode of living. The associated mode of life practised by the Sikhs and the Mohammedans produces fellow-feeling. The associated mode of life of the Hindus does not. Among Sikhs and Muslims there is a social cement which makes them Bhais. Among Hindus there is no such cement and one Hindu does not regard another Hindu as his Bhai. This explains why a Sikh says and feels that one Sikh, or one Khalsa is equal to Sava Lakh men. This explains why one Mohammedan is equal to a crowd of Hindus. This difference is undoubtedly a difference due to caste. So long as caste remains, there will be no Sanghalan and so long as there is no Sanghatan the Hindu will remain weak and meek. The Hindus claim to be a very tolerant people. In my opinion this is a mistake. On many occasions they can be intolerant and if on some occasions they are tolerant that is because they are too weak to oppose or too indifferent to oppose. This indifference of the Hindus has become so much a part of their nature that a Hindu will quite meekly tolerate an insult as well as a wrong. You see amongst them, to use the words of Morris, " The great reading down the little, the strong beating down the weak, cruel men fearing not, kind men daring not and wise men caring not." With the Hindu Gods all forbearing, it is not difficult to imagine the pitiable condition of the wronged and the oppressed among the Hindus. Indifferentism is the worst kind of disease that can infect a people. Why is the Hindu so indifferent?

Now I have seen you guys say it is bad and all but oh boy it is beyond repair. I saw all sorts of comments and it seems like these people have a lot of intellect but no culture, values and foundations. They may be materialistically very happy but their relationships, emotional affairs and other subtler aspects of life will remain below average if not bad. I don't even feel sorry for them but I am scared that many young people will head in that direction and there's nothing we can do. They're the very reason India's culture is destroyed. Theure the pests left behind by invasions, and they still destroy the culture in their own way. Americans and westerners are adopting sanatan dharm and yoga and whatnot and these asses are still tuning behind licking the buttholes of their British masters. Truly horrid.

Still, we remained connected to our roots. My siblings\nDoordarshan. So someday, I wanted my kids to imbibe our culture, but in their own way. We were at my parent\'s house a week before my due date, when my brother asked, Why aren\'t there any Hindu plush toys available? His wife was also expecting, so he\'d gone from store to store looking for a gift for her; there was nothing online either! There were unicorns &amp; Yodas but no Ganesh or Krishna. That got us thinking-maybe there were other parents Iike us; we could solve this. But was stressed about being a new mom along with my job-l wasn\'t ready to dive into a new venture. But my brother was passionate-by our daughters\' 1st birthday, he had a prototype created!\nMotivated, I eventually took the leap myself. My day would begin at 6 AM, l\'d drop my daughter to school &amp; go to work. Whenever found time, be it while commuting or bathing my daughter, I\'d work on our venture. After some to &amp; fro, we tested the prototype on my daughter &amp; niece; they loved their Baby Ganesh\'s &amp; hearing \'Ganpati Bappa Morya\' every time they squeezed it. That\'s when we launched Modi Toys. And the reviews since have been overwhelming! But honestly, it\'s about the comfort people have found in these toys. This one time a mom shared an image of her 4 year old who took his Baby Hanuman &amp; Ganesh for all his chemo sessions. Seeing his photo, I couldn\'t stop my tears.\nIn less than 2 years, we\'ve shipped to over 20 countries &amp; we\'ll start shipping to India soon too! But the best part is that people of all ages find solace in them. One lady gifted Baby Ganesh to her husband to announce her pregnancy, while another buried her stillborn alongside Baby Krishna. How does one put a price to that?\nIt\'s made me believe that what we\'ve created is more than a toy; it\'s a feeling. For some it signifies a new beginning, for others it\'s a source of strength. But when see kids play with a toy inspired by our roots, my heart fills with joy. I\'m a mother, a co-founder but most importantly, I\'m a proud Indian."\n\nFound this is interesting. please remove post if it is againt the rules.'<br />Author: 'los7cau53'<br />id: 'jziii8'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li>
