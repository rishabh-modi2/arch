In just one and half month, we gave 3.5L cases per day. Our healthcare system already collapsed when we reached 1L cases per day. Also, that's all the reported ones, I won't be surprised if 8k-10k people are dying everyday.\n\nThis is a double/triple mutant, more contagious, more life threatening and yet, we only have **two vaccines**. We are really the poorest performers in the world, people are dying without getting beds, outside hospital. Everyone of us have lost family, relatives and friends. \n\nNow the government is arranging Oxygen and beds (let alone ventilators) in last minute? Then what was the point of lockdown last here? Ek sal bad hum vahi akr khade ho gaye.\n\nLast year we were really, really lucky. We did two months nation wide lockdown, when there was about 150 cases, and national lockdown wasn't even necessary back then. \n\nLet's not talk about Politics on Oxygen, Blocking tweets...Weddings, Elections, Kumbh, Ramdan etc. And yes people's negligence too.\n\nBJP has surely put the final nail in their coffin with this blunder. Their lack of strtegic planning and accountability, has made them villains even where they ain't. With very few achievements and more controversies, they have lost their faith. Even their good work has become questionable.\n\nI see UPA with small regional parties including TMC, AAP, INC, AIMIM, SS... Making the next government and that's going to be a lot more horrible, unstable and corrupt, to fuck us, more than BJP, even undoing a little good work BJP did."<br />Author: 'AayushBoliya'<br />id: 'mye343'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Over a long period of time, Hindus were attacked, Hindu festivals were attacked, Hindus were massacred, RSS workers were assassinated in huge numbers. These tribals were funded by the same vested interests who also fund the Naxalites till date. There's been a whole Chrislamocommie nexus well established inside India, with branches spreading everywhere. Whenever people talk of riots in India, they remember 2002. What about the Bagber Massacre, Singicherra Massacre, Kamalnagar? The NLFT also used to abduct and kill tribals, indigenous villagers, CPM leaders, so it was anything but a tribal insurgency or a native separatist movement.

Some are upset because the government‚Äôs review will not be made public. ‚ÄúAfter a deliberative process that cost $1 million for [a consultant‚Äôs] external study and consumed countless weeks and months of time for many scientists, we are now being asked to trust a completely opaque process where the outcome is to permit the continuation of dangerous experiments,‚Äú says Harvard University epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch. \n\n\n\nIn 2011, Fouchier and Kawaoka alarmed the world by revealing they had separately **modified the deadly avian H5N1 influenza virus so that it spread between ferrets.** Advocates of such gain of function (GOF) studies say they can help public health experts better understand how viruses might spread and plan for pandemics. **But by enabling the bird virus to more easily spread among mammals, the experiments also raised fears that the pathogen could jump to humans.** And critics of the work worried that such a souped-up virus could spark a pandemic if it escaped from a lab or was intentionally released by a bioterrorist.

We can argue that what if we stop and opposition don't but it doesn't matter. Modi is PM of india and his first duty is towards country and not BJP. Atleast he and Amit shah could have avoided it.\n\nYou see everything has a breaking point. Remember 2011? All the Anna Hazare protests and all. Whether they were right or wrong is different discussion, but it was the breaking point of INC. 3 years later they were gone. Now look at us, All this covid, Farmers Protest, CAA NRC, and all that shit has done plenty of damage. \nThere is no coming back from this to be honest. This is going to come and haunt BJP forever.\n\nPS: Before labelling me as randian please go check my post history"<br />Author: 'Bhartiya_bro'<br />id: 'mxsioy'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

So far I'm finding the subjects, particularly Legal Reasoning very intersting.\n \nNow, like any other aspirant I started watching videos, and browsing about the top colleges, like Nlsiu, Nalsar, etc. According to what I saw it seems that these law colleges are extremely left leaning. I found some articles that said that students who have  right ideology are even abused there. I found articles that they opposed CAA and stood with JNU and AMU, and some student representative was even forced to issue a statement opposing CAA. Even I found an article of the interview of a senior history teacher at Nlsiu, and she openly said that she taught Marxist history and she liked it (wtf?) \n\nAnd now I'm terrified af and don't know what to do. If I get admission there, I don't know how I'll survive 5 years there.

<li>Title: 'Moment of sudden pride towards north Indian Bharateey bhratas. Let me explain a perspective I realised on the Indian perception of Aryan Invasion Theory....'<br />Body: 'Every society has been trying to attach themselves to a society they perceive as greater than them. Europeans associate with Greeks and Romans even though a lot of them aren\'t, Indian subcontinental M√∫sl√≠ms associate themselves with Arabs, Mongols (Khans), Turks, Iranians, Afghans (and what not) although none of them purely are, Chinese associate with Hans although most were just peasants and so on. Northern Indians when they were at their worst, beaten and trashed for hundreds of years, they were given one such rope to a high lineage- the "great" Aryans. One would have expected from them to immediately latch on and say yes, we are indeed descendants of that great conquering bloodline of Europeans (who were at the time seen as rich civilised nations).  But for some reason that poor and frail defeated northern society refused to buy into the attractive offer of racial pride and great knowledgeable lineage. The propagandists must\'ve been confused as to how come these brown men not want to associate with us, the great strong civilised white Europeans? This in my eyes shows the depth of a massive underground current of brotherhood in the Indian society, for which they said No sir, we are good with status of our forefathers as they were. This also shows the foolishness of the Dravidian movement, since those they call oppressive conquering Aryans are denying that they won anything. Whom the Dravidians call racists have stomped their feet deep and said NO, our fathers are one and we are brothers, we aren\'t the descendents of some great white conquerers, we are the same little brown men as you. To this day, that resistance towards de-Indianising Indians continues with Indians taking onto themselves the task of proving that they did not descend from some fabled supreme race but are just plain original Indians. A moment of relief for me, bhratas, to know that our people value integrity more than racial pride, lineage pride and supremacy, on this social value all other cultures I know have failed but us.

But with a treaty that any further escalation , we would nuke you.\n\n2. Declare India a Dharmic rashtra , so provide all incentives for population exchange . Incase you want to remain in India ,you will have to convert to any Dharmic religion.\n\n3.Increase nuclear arsenal manyfold and at the same time cut down heavily on military so that it can be diverted to nations growth.\n\n4. If above works out fine , create a robust SAARC alliance with a free Trade agreement.\n\n5. Strict population control. \n\n6. Impose multiple language policy on education cos that will be the only diverging factor for our nation.\n\n7.Compulsory military service and NCC activities. \n Strict focus on school children to be disciplined.\n\n8.Complete prohibition of alcohol, drugs , cigarettes.\n\n9. Police to be a central subject , so that it is not misused.\n\n10. Politicians to have mandatory graduation to be eligible for elections.\n\n11. Death penalty for rapes, caste violence, murders, corruption that directly impacts commoners.\n\n12. Judiciary to be overhauled. Lie detection, truth serums and all modern tools be allowed to establish crimes.\n\nIf I manage to achieve the above ,here would be the next set of steps:\n\n1. Reform agriculture . Import grains from other countries . Grow only cash crops for export.\n\n2.Incentivize scientific thinking. Money saved from above could be used to build world class research centres.\n\n3.Every job ,be it public or private have minimum standard wage and compulsory appraisals. No one can slack off.\n\n4. Use human resource to establish massive infrastructure.  Tax collection be very strict \n\n5.Focus on skilling everyone. Be it plumber, carpentar,machine operator, welder etc so as to enable job creation.\n\n6.Education be completely skill based . For instance technical courses should have 70:30 waightage of practical skill to theoretical understanding.\n\nCourses such as humanities should be more introspective. Rather than rote learning ,it's modern day implications should be the focus.\n\n7. Revival of ancient Indian teachings but not blindly but with thorough scientific vigour.\n\nI have a 1000 more ideas but will anyone listen?"<br />Author: 'trumptyonawall'<br />id: 'mx2r7h'<br />Flair :Wholesome Bakchodi :danklaugh:</li>

Only a few news get the coverage. This too happen with some viral incidents only, for ex. Dasna temple incident.\n\nWe lack the ecosystem to make any news/in incident Viral on purpose. Imagine we had a reach of a few thousand Sanatanis who take actions on issues presented in front of them, supports Virat bhratas\' initiatives in the intial stage so they can make bigger impact for Dharma. For ex:  "Code for dharma" initiative? How much they can help achieve as a community if we get them support in thier intial journey? We need some "Amplifiers" who can bring good initiatives and important news in front of a larger audience. \n\n\nI want to start a newsletter which will act as one of these amplifier. \n\nThe newsletter will include 5 curated news articles from sites in similar line as OPIndia and two text section which can promote either upcoming /past webinars on dharma, book recommendations with a brief about it, introducing dharma related initiatives doing great work so more and more people can support them.\n\nTo start with weekly newsletter, I need some monetarily support so that I can work on it without investing my life savings especially during such an uncertain time. I need one time support of $1,000 to start this. There is a cost attached to the email service provider which I need to take care of. \n\nSuggest me a good way to raise fund for this. Shall I create the first newsletter and send it to those who will subscribe and add button to donate money button?\n\nPlease share your constructive feedback and do mention if you are willing to donate a small amount to help me start this initiative or are willing to subscribe.\n\nps. I am afraid to use a mailchimp free plan since its 2,000 subscribers limit may reach within a week or so upon promotion'<br />Author: 'khshtriyawarrior'<br />id: 'mwcus1'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'An analysis of what India has/ has not done during COVID.'<br />Body: "Tl; dr; centre, states, people have all messed up.\nThis might be a long post, please bear with me. \nWe are seeing sickening, heartbreaking scenes from various cities. People are dying a painful death. Doctors are pleading with people to stay indoors, pleading for oxygen supply in their hospitals. We are all bickering about Modi, Uddhav, Kejriwal, Yogi, who's done what and what not.\n\nBut from what I see a huge blame lies with the centre. They got complacent after the first wave came down and vaccination started. Did they assume that vaccination would fix things? How long will it take vaccinate more than 60% population? \n\n Centre was always in the backfoot. They allowed opponents and lobby groups to go against COVAXIN, which lead to vaccine hesitancy. People are still saying COVAXIN isn't safe and I don't say a messaging from the govt to counter this. During polio vaccination and swach bharath, people were a catalyst for change. Govt has to clamp down hard against vaccine hesitancy and improve awareness amongst the masses. \n\n Centre must have asked states to strictly enforce mask wearing and sanitation. Not implementing centre directives is reason enough to put president's rule but half of the states are ruled by bjp itself. States have been found lacking in enforcing COVID protocols, maybe the had done something to improve capacity but if huge population becomes sick, capacity will get stretched fast. So Covid deniers, non mask wearers, have all lead to booming of cases and stretching of whatever capacity states had.  \n\nCentre cannot be bickering with opposition on matter of rallies. Even if opposition is doing them, modi-shah shouldn't be doing rallies. Modi is the leader of the nation, he has to be in Delhi to get us over this mess. If people including supporters are questioning, it's because they know that leader can do whatever it takes to find solutions. \n\nStates have responsibility over health. No state can abdicate that responsibility. Capacity addition- isolation centres, hospitals, more beds, oxygen supply, strengthen local governments\n- should have been the priority last year. The urge to resort to lockdown shows that this is the only armoury available to do anything. I will go easy on delhi because a large population from other states also rely on delhi hospitals. But Maharashtra, the fuck up since first wave has been unbelievable, needless to say, migrant exodus back will affect UP, Bihar badly.  \n\nThe fixing of accountability, which is a common thread to the all the above points. We need to fix accountability at centre and state level because both haven't done enough to prevent the second wave.  Centre should have continued to keep vigil, direct states to do more tests, enforcing COVID standards. States should have proactively done more tests, trace, isolate, strengthen Covid protocols, sensitise population. \n\nLastly, people need to mask up, sanitise and avoid crowds unless important. Everyone has to urge our family and friends to take the vaccines.  Large section of the population don't have the fortune to isolate like so many of us do. The section of population that can stay home, should do so, otherwise we are looking at another lockdown, economic crisis, starvation, death. We're all in this fight together. \n\nI have not included lots of subjects- local self govt, gst payments, financing methods for states, kumbh, farmers protests, not even the positive side of first wave. \nThankyou for reading."<br />Author: 'upscaspi'<br />id: 'mw9oxh'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Why Covid cases are so low in Gujarat?'<br />Body: 'It was February 27,2002 when Shri Modiji were CM of Gujarat. He arranged a meeting with senior police officers and home department officials to brainstorm about possible Chinese attack on the country in the future. While the consensus was on a nuclear strike by China, Modiji with his brilliant mind suggested that the attack can be in the form of a pandemic. This is the same meeting that some anti national officers like Sanjiv Bhatt are alleging that Modiji called in for inciting riots. While in reality Modiji were preparing for a possible attack on the country. The meeting was top secret and hence they are denying it ever happened.\n\nWell, to the point, In this meeting, a Gujarati origin NASA scientist named Dr Chunilal Tikamdas Yagnik was present. He suggested a copper radiating tower, the height of Eiffel tower to be installed in the middle of Gujarat. Everyone knows how effective copper is to kill the the virus. Dr Chu.Ti. Yagnik had a Ph.D from Gujarat University in Entire Rare Earth Metal Filtration Using Cow Dung. He had devised a plan to decontaminate the state of Gujarat using a copper emitting tower built using some Rare Earth materials produced in China itself. But there was a problem. If Modiji asked China to supply this Rare Earth material for such a tower, China will never allow it. Also we needed Solar technology from USA and Germany for emitting this copper using a solar operated reactor. This technology was procured by Adani Greens Ltd, a subsidiary company that time was part of Adani Enterprise. They supported the government in this noble cause to save Gujarat from future pandemic caused by China and incompetence of the Gandhi family. The question of buying Rare Earth material from China was still open. The next day, amid rising violence by the peaceful community, Modiji thought of an idea of building a copper statue at the middle of Gujarat near sardar sarovar dam, and hide this copper emitting technology inside it. This one idea of the great man opened the doors for us to buy copper and other Rare Earth materials from China. In the years to come, Gujarat built this ramban yantra, installed on the banks of Narmada as the Statue of Unity. Fast forward to 2020, this work of the genius is saving millions of lives in Gujarat from covid. I thank the god for taking birth on the lands of vadnagar, in the form of Narendra Damodardas Modi, to save millions of lives of Gujaratis.

<li>Title: 'Right-wing media seriously needs to work otherwise an entire generation will be spoilt with wokeness'<br />Body: 'Let me explain.\n\nI believe most of the young educated English-speaking folks in India tend to use social media where their political beliefs are formed. There is no discussion, no discourse, just spoonfeeding of news and ideologies from the content they follow and consume. Moreover, social media just repeats the type of content you show interest in at least once, and then you are into the rabbit hole or an echo chamber of the same school of thoughts.\n\nOn the other side, this is clearly a "war of narratives". The social media narrative is largely controlled by media houses who (not sure about left-leaning but definitely against a single political party) and can go at any length or any level of selectivity just to put a single political party in a bad light.\n\nRecently, Instagram accounts like [The Tatva](https://www.instagram.com/thetatvaindia/?hl=en), [The Pulse](https://www.instagram.com/thepulseindia/?hl=en), [redpillmeplease](https://www.instagram.com/redpillmeplease/) are some of the places trying to do some work. \n\nObv we have Swarajya and OPIndia, but seriously think they need to do a lot more work in SEO and being out there on social media. Sorry to say, but news article does not work in present days. People mostly consume the headline they read on twitter, Instagram stories, or posts.\n\nThis is sad that an entire generation is being trained to form an opinion not based on deep research and analysis but based on few images, few statements and what-masses-think (as this is what becomes most shared on social media). It\'s sad, but it\'s the reality and we have to evolve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat we should do instead?\n\nWe should have a proper presence on Twitter and Instagram and same sure we share a counter to every BS these spoilt media houses are doing. For me personally, most of my counters to any BS from left-leaning-woke media comes from the replies to the tweets they share, and that is the place I get the irony and the argument as to why their narrative makes no sense.\n\nI\'d be really happy if there\'s some thread just below of such BS news (like r/IndiaRWResources) so that other can read a dense content in 2-3 tweets and be aware of the. bias being presented to them.'<br />Author: 'duniyamadarchodhai'<br />id: 'mw0u31'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

All I want to say to these Hindu men: Abe Gadhe ho kya be? There are some arguments that Bslim men are more attractive because of their genes. Saalon ancestry test karwa lo, tumhare andar Irish/Japanese genome mil jayega magar saalon ke andar Arab ya Turkey ka ek molecule nahin milega. Secondly, physical good looks play an important role in arrange marriage but at least for girls, when the question is of infatuation/crush, it's entirely independent of physical appearance but more about the attitude. Even the TV or movie actors we crush on,. it's more dependent on the fictional characters they play (Confession time: I have a crush on a Bslim TV actor but I never found him handsome earlier). On one hand you say girls run after money yet how would you explain how puncturewallahs and fruitsellers persuade educated girls to elope with them? And to the question girls prefer Muslim men because they are more masculine then sabse zyada Indian ladkiyan paglayi hui hain Kpop stars and Kdrama actors and in my limited knowledge, Hindu boys are at least more masculine than them. Problem is these M guys have been trained in Foundation course of grooming girls since their teenage. Jab ek banda saalon taiyyari karke exam dega and aap bina course tak jane exam doge to chahe aap kitne talented ho, usse jeet nahin paoge. Bslim ladkiyan Burke me rehkar bhi patthar se itna sateek nishaana laga leti hain and Hindu Ladkiyan to dhang se patthar utha bhi nahin payengi. The reason is not genome difference but because Hindu girls didn't learn the art of pelting stones. Unless Hindus cut open the web of inferiority complex, no one can prevent love Jihad. Are Hindu ladke to itne bade simp hote hain ki Bslim bandi se shaadi karne ke liye rehmat Khan bhi ban jante hain.

<li>Title: 'Strengths of Islam i have observed'<br />Body: "Hindus are too emotional when looking at Islam and seem to be unable to look at it objectively. On one hand Liberal self hating hindus will praise Islam just because it is positioned in India as opposing Hindus. And on the other hand Raita wingers and nationalist types are also emotional about Islam and are unable to look at Islam and do a competitor analysis and appreciate its strengths.\n\nIn business successful companies do not spend time crying about the historical atrocities of their competitors and/or their historic losses to these competitors. They conduct a competitor analysis and see what the strengths and weaknesses of their competitor are. Based on the information derived the company will re-evaluate their strategy. Sometimes they will even adopt some of the practices of the competitor, which is necessary to stay in business. \n\nTo give some context I am an 'ABCD' but I am not a liberal chut. Since I do not reside in India I am not emotionally invested in the Muslim/Hindu divide. I try to be as objective as possible but I also may have some biases. My post will be very brief and here i will describe what I believe some of the strengths are of Islam and/or behavior of Muslims I have observed. This is not a competitor analysis since I dont have the time to do so nor am I knowledgable enough on Islam to give it its full due. \n\nStrength 1: Tawheed. The Islamic concept of the oneness of God is very valuable. I am not advocating for Abrahmic monotheism but I think it is far superior to explicit polytheism which is what a large plurality/majority (not all) of Hindus follow. Polytheism and monotheism are not the only two religious systems. There is Monism which is found in Advaita. There is also Panentheism found in Sikhism and multiple hindu sects. All of these systems of belief I find are superior to explicit polytheism. In fact the Sanskrit concept of *Aikyam*, stresses the oneness of the divine and is millenia older than Abrahmic faith. The oness of God is much more simple to understand and less confusing for the average person to understand. One divinity can also serve to unite people more efficently. I also believe avatars is a slipperly slope that causes degeneration. To illustrate this example I will use Christianity as an example and how the deification of Jesus to the status of a God degenerated that religion. When Christians elevated jesus to the status of God/part of god/whatever term you want to use they prescribed jesus characteristics to God. No offense to Jesus he has many positive qualities but he is also passive, too forgiving, and accepting of degeneracy to a degree ( defending prostitutes, etc.) You see now in the west in Christianity is just jesus fixated. THey say Jesus died for your sins. So westerners use this as a free pass to just sin and not care. They deified jesus and only focussed on the aspects of God that Jesus represented forgiveness/passive nature. Islam is concise and easy to understand for their followers wheras different strains of Hindu dharma is not. Most Hindus do rituals without knowing the reason behind these rituals or they read puranas without knowing the meaning or metaphors behing the stories. THis creates stupid people who cannot defend their religion when attacked. I personally dislike the Puranas since they have confused the masses which was the opposite of their intention. The westernersand abrahmics  have the tradition of apologetics due their nature as missionary religions. There followers understand their traditions better although not great. \n\n2. Islam is political in nature. Islam has laws, rules and regulations tied into its theology. Wheras hindus explicitly do not. Theology and politics should not be separate. Our morals come from theology. Islam combines these 2 in a way that has been effective historically for meeting their goals. Islamic Jurisprudence is in tact wheras hindu law has been deciminated. Hindus basically follow British common law with no reverence for any dharmic concepts. \n\n Sure hindus have manu smriti, dharma shastras, etc. But hindus do not follow these. The Manu smriti has some great concepts but even Hindu  'right wingers' want to completely throw it due to liberals hating select translated passages of the text. I am not saying adopt the manusmriti but take some of the concepts from manusmriti that stand the test of time and put it into a new smriti for this age. Even the hindu rishis say that the Manusmriti is not fit for the age of Kali Yuga. But there are concepts in there that stand the test of time.\n\n3. Love Jih\\*\\* is a 3/4 myth 1/4 true. I will elaborate why I think its part myth part true. Love Ji\\*\\*d is a half- myth the fact of the matter is muslim dudes have better game, fitness, and social skills than your average Hindu guy. I see this in multiple countries. USA, Canada, UK, India, Malaysia,etc. Hindu dudes just suck at attracting women and when they see hindu women with Muslim men they complain like a loser. Growing up all the hindus were nerds wheras the muslim dudes played sports and their mosque had lots of sports competitions. Muslim dudes also didnt have social awkwardness. THese things just help make better more masculine men which women are attracted too. All of these countries I have been i observed the Muslims were just better equipped socially and exhibited more masculine characteristics. The only truth in Love Jih\\*\\* is that there are multiple cases of Muslim dudes lying about their religion to the women they are courting Lying is not good and lying should be condemned. But again I personally think its the fault of these girls and their fathers for just letting them out in the world unsupervised to be courted by guys the family does not know. Blaming Islam for the biological imperative all dudes have is stupid. Hindus would do the same if they were on the same lvl as Muslim dudes in the attraction game.\n\n4. Muslim Men are the last men  (barely) standing up against degeneracy in this world. (and some women). Yes there is a weird alliance in the west between western born 'muslim feminists' and the liberals. But when I objectively look at all groups in the world it appears that Muslims have the highest proportion of both men and women standing up against western degeneracy. Muslims are unashamed to be patriarchal. Patriarchy makes strong civilizations. Hindu nationalists arnt real right wingers imo. All hindu nationalists do is SIMP for westerners and say look at us we are against the mudslims too. I see Hindu nationalists championing feminism which Is beyond stupid.  I understand that certain Muslim dynasties like the Mughals have committed terrible attrocities against people in the subcontinent. But the strongest enemy right now is modernist western values. These values are opposed to 90+% of traditional cultures out there. The fact that Muslims are resisting these more efficiently has made me grow an appreciation for them."<br />Author: 'ginobili6'<br />id: 'mvt2s2'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Just had a realization'<br />Body: 'This is long post please be patient\n\nAs i was browsing through againsthinduphobia subreddit, i observed that some stories are altogether missing like discovery of mass grave of Rohingya Hindus, Delhi riots attack on Hindus and Christians attack on temples in Andhra(yes one story was covered but approx. 200 attacks happened in last year alone ). This lead me to research all  attacks on Hindus in recent years, whether it was  forced conversion and rape of Hindus in Pakistan or destruction of temples in Bangladesh, not a single politician in world has raised concern in global forum (yes even our own country\'s "Hindu nationalistic party ").only single politician in entire world has raised concerned that was Tulsi  gabbard. So i was discussing the same with some people about the same in my state (Andhra ),  when i asked why are you voting for the guy who was destroying temples, their response was temples are temples but he is giving us the most cash. This was not a unique experience I have seen Dalit Christians mocking Dalit Hindus, even openly discriminating against them .Hell even CD CBI ADGP(Andhra ) called for culling of Hindus, another top IPS officer in Telangana openly called to eliminate false idol worshippers. Funny thing is no one seems to give a shit. Hell i am tired of arguing with people, fuck it i can be either be tired and frustrated  or energetic and frustrated , I am choosing the second one.\n\nSo my realization was how situation in Kashmir went total balls up ,  it was not the intelligence of ISI or competence of Islamic terrorists, it was just that we don\'t just give a shit about other Hindus or even our temples ,if 99 people mass grave  of another religion(Rohingya Hindus ) was found or were discriminated against as Hindus are in  Pakistan  and Bangladesh ,this could have been international news but because its Hindus we can\'t even break top news in a country with 80% Hindus.'<br />Author: 'logically_dumbguy'<br />id: 'mvnuyh'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>
<li>Title: 'Some Redpills for some extremists larping here who might get this sub banned'<br />Body: "1. Muslims are the first victims of Islam. Majority of Indian Muslims in India had Hindu ancestors who were converted by the sword, lies etc.\n2. There are approx. 200 million Muslims in India. Calls to genocide all of them or putting them in concentration camps is inhumane and impractical. Poisoning your mind with such evil ideas will only affect your mental and physical health and turn you into the person you're fighting against.\n3. The fight is against Islam not Muslims. Each Hindu converted to Islam isn't an ally lost but an adversary gained. Collecting and imparting knowledge about Hinduism, Islam and Christianity to your friends and families goes a long way to help them see the true picture and remain in the dharmic fold.\n4. Present Muslims don't have any role in the atrocities committed against Hindus by Muslims in the past. The Christian Portuguese killed and tortured a lots of Hindus in goa. Why isn't there a similar outrage against Indian Christians? They aren't responsible for past crimes.\n5. The reason there are so many Hindu atheists right now is because there are no gurukuls or sanskrit scholars left to retain them in the dharmic fold. If they don't know their scriptures or history they would cease to be hindus.\n6. All enemies aren't only external but also internal. These victims of macaulayism should be opposed vehemently.\n7. Don't support anyone blindlessly. BJP and RSS have been known to backtrack on hindu causes. Support a party which will serve you best. \n\nI will now highlight the goals I think one should strive towards for the benefit of himself and those around him in the long run:\n\n1. Gain knowledge of your History and scriptures. Arming yourself ideologically is what every person here should strive towards.\n2. Cut funding to Christian and Muslim schools or religious places by the government and implement UCC. This is a secular country.\n3. Gain knowledge of what you're at arms against. Reading scriptures of Islam, Christianity and Communism will help you understand how the other side thinks and plan an ideological defense.\n4. Vote in every election. Your vote is your biggest power as a citizen. Muslims use their votebank to make all political parties appease them. Make your votebank have enough power that every political party stops appeasing Muslims.\n5. Remove the places of worship act. Every masjid built on a temple should be removed."<br />Author: 'horrorlover2'<br />id: 'mvnt0q'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

When government wanted a telecom company, they hijacked Reliance resources and made BSNL. But wasn't able to run any of those things. Many such incidents happened since the independence and failed miserably. Any why shouldn't it fail, A government has conflict of interest in running a company, they can't fire bad management, they can't price it at sustainable level because they interest is to win election.\n\nNow Current Modi govt arrogantly monopolised vaccination supply that I will give vaccine to everyone for free. And nobody questioned it. (our stupid opposition party and media who will criticize Modi for all wrong reasons but never for a sensible reason).\n\nWhy do everyone have to get vaccine from Central govt only? Why can't people who can afford get it from private hospitals. Who is stopping govt to give it for free, but atleast they could have allowed companies to sell to private institutions. But what is logic against arrogance.\n\nNow finally Modi did some course correction all opposition party are crying to go please go back to wrong way. We don't like to pay for anything. Why private company is earning profit. They are Modi friend.\n\nDude, private company is meant to make profit. I never imagined that Indian company will be able to make vaccine, but they did unimaginable. Otherwise most people are hoping that US or Russia will make it and we will get some bikh out of pity. But it didn't happen that way which was miraculous. Why so much hate for private institutions, if such attitude will continue why will not every Indian will open and do buisness in foreign land. Why even Indian company do research in risky works in which they can loose money but if they get success they can't earn. We will forever be underdeveloped, labour for advanced research doing countries.\n\nIf you want cheaper things from private companies please go forward and make some deal.

I was kind of intrigued by the social media storm surrounding her and her book. I felt she wrote with an agenda to rehabilitate Aurangzeb\'s image and defang the Hindutva revival predicated on past atrocities by Muslim rulers. I also felt she highlighted small slivers of Aurangzeb\'s life that would make him seem a little more agreeable. For example, she makes a huge deal of his continuance of a Hindu custom of being weighed in a commodity, known as the weighing ritual. This makes no sense. Like is this supposed to redeem him ? She also claims that an earlier historical portrayal of Aurangzeb by Jadunath Sarkar was unfair because he used the word crescent. Lol..Why is she considered a scholar.. Excerpt from the book *For Sarkar, Aurangzeb was a tragic figure. Moreover, in line with other colonial-era thinkers, Sarkar viewed Aurang-zeb  as  a  religious  zealot  (hence,  ‚Äúthe  Mughal  crescent‚Äù)  and  thought that his dedication to a specific sort of Islam spelled utter catastrophe for the empire.* \n\nIn order to fill pages in her useless book, she talks about Aurangzeb\'s love for mangoes...Lol...WHAT??\n\nWTF...Is this what passes as scholarly work in History ? \n\nAnother theme I feel she comes back to again and again in the book is that rulers used to use violence and desecration of temples as a political tool to supress revolts. There was no sense of loyalty among people for each other. She cites Shivaji\'s betrayal by a Hindu as proof of this. She presents it as a Way of the world argument.\n\nMy response is that if you can justify at a later date Muslim actions of temple desecration and forced conversion as a political tool, why can you not accept the Hindu\'s right to also use MoSqUe destruction as a political tool. Well, this is the way of our world. Accept it.\n\nAll in all, I thought the book was written to brainwash and bait Indians. Padhni hai to padh lo. Illegally download karlo LiBGeN par.

They are weak and cannot prepare food for themselves currently. \n\nMy natural response was - you can use Swiggy / Zomato.

Later, we managed to find her a guy from a Facebook group who catered to her demand. \n\nThis got me thinking, that with rise in COVID cases this exact situation must have been faced by so many people and there is a need for website from where you can order homecooked food from your neighbors.

<li>Title: 'Can we stop pretending?'<br />Body: "Can we stop pretending that we are on the path. We can do all 'one step at a time' and 'satya always prevails' bs but at the end, population wins. And they're winning at population like anything &amp; don't forget conversions, which we have done nothing to counter. Our leaders are corrupt and we fail miserably to take any action. Unity, you already know it. All we do is, call their hypocrisy now, only thats the difference. Got everyone against us, heck even hInDuS against us. Pretending shit this way will only make us die a slow death. We can all dream about akhand bharat, hindu rashtra, but the reality is we can't even save our temples. Ugh, hate to think about the day, they overtake. CAA-NRC failed, bangladeshis all over, leftists eating us. Do we even have a plan, or we just have people who call themselves 'unapologetic hindus' and say 'one day'."<br />Author: 'Murli_12'<br />id: 'muwl4q'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

I fucking give up. Let sleeping dogs lie."<br />Author: 'saveme4mabdulbowwow'<br />id: 'mushdy'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

<li>Title: 'The laws of the universe require a reason behind every existence.'<br />Body: 'There is a purpose for your life. It may be difficult to understand why you are here but the laws of the universe require a reason behind every existence. Every person, from the least to the greatest, is a unique mind with its own individual part to play in this universe‚Äôs design. Though there are many colours in the grand tapestry of life, all people are equal strings.\xa0\n\nYou may feel as if you are lost in your own skin ‚Äî unsure of where you are supposed to go and what you are supposed to do. But even the wisest spend their lives searching for this meaning. Even the wisest cannot fully answer this great conundrum.\xa0\n\nLife is not about a beginning or an end. It is a journey of many steps. Only when you reach the end and look back will you finally see the full truth of your purpose.'<br />Author: 'rabbi9'<br />id: 'muq5y5'<br />Flair ::oc-: OC ‡§π‡•à BC!üí°</li></ol>
