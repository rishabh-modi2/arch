<li>Title: "Here's an idea to fix the losses of air india."<br />Body: 'Air India was originally founded and was  run under the leadership of the Legendary JRD Tata. They were part of the golden age of flying untill our beloved commie chacha and his entourage acted like absolute dolts and made it into a government owned entity merging some smaller airlines like indian airlines and vayudoot.\n\nThough initially JRD Tata was allowed to manage the company, he was eventually kicked out. See the hypocrisy here, the government took control of a private company and merged it with other companies that were not profitable and they kicked out the founder. I cannot see a better example why the state has no businesses deciding what to do with a private company, same thing happened with the nationalization of banks by our beloved "When a big tree falls, the earth shakes" sahiba.\n\nThis is only one example, there are many more such examples where the nehruvian socialist policies wrecked our economy.\n\nThat being said the government should give air india back to the Tatas, cause govt can keep on pumping tax payer money into a sinking ship with the hopes that it will keep the ship afloat. \n\nAlthough the tatas have air Asia, this will do some good to the employees of air India, plus tatas can have all the slots in all the airports that belong to air india. Maybe with their financial muscle and business acumen they can turn this company arround.\n\nMaybe it\'s time for india as country to go private.\n\nWhat do you think of this?

Don't drag India down in this crucial time with the excuse of Pakistan/Muslims.\n\n Keep the harmony and use proper tools to fight your whatever cause. Daily/selectively picking a random article from a random corner of the country and radicalizing each other isn't gonna help the country. Learn to be liberal and strong at the same time. When you force something on such a diverse country, you will not only vilianize the country but everyone else with the same identity as yours. The word Hindu would evoke negative emotions if things go the same. This ain't 7th century anymore. Past invasions cannot be an excuse to satisfy your inner demons anymore. \n\nFinally stop making Jai Shree Ram the same as Allah hu Akbar. It will become that, eventually.

The INA soldiers means all the soldiers that were arrested in the battlefield, they were given to Subhas Candra Bose, either by the Japanese or by the Germans. So the soldiers took this opportunity; they voluntarily surrendered to the enemy. So when the Britishers understood that the soldiers, Indian soldiers, are now noncooperating, then they decided, "No, no more. It is not possible." So they voluntarily withdrew, that Sir Sirpiting(?)

Because, it's kinda true. 'Hindus are very insecure people'. The more hardcore we are ideologically, we are that much more insecure. We seem to sense danger everywhere, be suspicious of others, not trust anyone - not even ourselves. We become extremely defensive and even vile when outsiders criticize our culture and practices but gleefully troll them without expecting retaliation. Let's take LJ for instance, this is a real and existential problem but we are so focused on faulting Ms that we may be getting unhinged. There is a sense of self-confidence and dignity that is very visible to me in the disposition of ppl from other religions that I find we really lack. Could this be cuz our principles are not firmly agreed  upon and the constant exploration is actually hindering us in a way ? Please share your thoughts if you feel like it.

<li>Title: 'The Bhupinder Singh Files (Source: Freedom at Midnight by Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins) Also, search about who is his grandson. There is a treat for you after you do this.'<br />Body: "   \n\n&gt;Bhupinder Singh demonstrated a remarkably refined aptitude for an equally worthy princely pastime, sex. As he came into maturity his devotion to his harem eventually surpassed even his passions for polo and hunting. He personally supervised the steady accumulation of its inmates, selecting new recruits with a connoisseur's appreciation of variety in appearance and accomplishment in action. By the time the institution reached its fullest fruition, it contained 350 ladies.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;During the torrid Punjab summers, the harem moved outdoors in the evening to Bhupinder's pool. The prince stationed a score of bare-breasted girls like nymphs at intervals around its rim. Chunks of ice bobbing in the pool's water gave the hot air a delicious chill while the Maharaja floated idly about, coming to port from time to time to caress a breast or have a sip of whiskey.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The walls and ceilings of Bhupinder's private quarters were covered with representations of the erotic temple sculptures for which India was justly famous, a catalogue of copulative possibilities to exhaust the most inventive mind and athletic body. A wide silk hammock slung in one corner of the room allowed Bhupinder Singh to suspend the laws of gravity while attempting to perform in that state some of the more complex maneuvers suggested by his ceiling.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To satisfy his insatiable habits, the imaginative Maharaja embarked on a program that would allow him to remodel the charms of his concubines as his own taste changed. Sir Bhupinder opened his harem doors to a parade of perfumers, jewelers, hairdressers, beauticians and dressmakers. He even kept a team of French, British and Indian plastic surgeons on standby to alter the physiognomies of his favorites according to the Maharaja's fluctuating tastes or the dictates of the London fashion magazines, which reached the palaces in a regular flow. To further stimulate his princely ardors, he converted one wing of the harem into a laboratory whose test tubes and vials produced an exotic blend of scents, cosmetics, lotions and philters.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;All those piquant refinements ultimately only served to screen the fatal weakness in the Maharaja's Oriental pleasure dome.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What man, as handsomely en- downed by nature as Sir Bhupinder was, could satisfy the 350 highly trained and motivated ladies lurking behind the harem's grilles? A recourse to aphrodisiacs was inevitable. His Indian doctors worked up a number of savory concoctions based on gold, pearls, spices, silver, herbs and iron."<br />Author: 'Meet_Me_In_Heaven'<br />id: 'l3ceku'<br />Flair ::oc-: OC है BC!💡</li>

My maternal family and Netaji\'s family used to be very well-off, both of them being super rich, owning multistoreyed bungalows at the time. My mother\'s grandfather used to be the President of the All India Business Group. They also had relations with the big Congress leaders. All of this was in the 1930s.\n\nOwing to this, my grandmother\'s (my mother\'s mother), uncle\'s, mother-in-law was friends with Netaji\'s mother, Prabhadevi Bose, who was also a social activist and a politician. The mother-in-law had a Narayan\'s idol, made of stone, in her house\'s temple. Once, after the death of Netaji hit the news in 1945, Netaji\'s mother visited the mother-in-law\'s home, and told her that "If I get the news about Subhash being alive, I\'ll come and install an umbrella (chhatra) made of gold for this Narayan\'s idol. Well, a few days later, Netaji\'s mother visited the mother-in-law\'s home and installed a gold umbrella for the Narayan\'s idol 😉🙂'<br />Author: 'maithunmama'<br />id: 'l3a76q'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>

<li>Title: 'Farmers have given the government the upper hand by rejecting the 18 month suspension of farm laws offer.'<br />Body: "In what exposes the farmers movement as bare faced obstructionism and dirty extortion, the farmers have rejected the government offer to meet their demands half way by suspending the farm laws for 18 months.\n\nThis is just the latest of the governments offers to be rejected.  Initially the government offered to discuss specific provisions of the farms laws which the farmers found wrongful and to negotiate the language for those provisions.  The farmers insisted that they wanted the farm laws to be repealed.\n\nWhen the matter went to the supreme court, the court instituted a panel to explain the farm laws to the farmers.  While this has been represented as the court abdicating its responsibility, it actually shows that the supreme court finds nothing untoward in the laws.  They carefully selected eminent lawyers who understood the laws to explain the provisions to the farmers, the way only a lawyer can explain the law to their layman clients.  The panel was rejected by the farmers and liberals were quick to point out that the panel was comprised of people who were always in support of the farm laws.\n\nwell, duh!  what the court was looking for was lawyers who understood the farm laws.  the fact that they agreed with the laws only shows that the laws were good.  it is worth noting that the panel members were, in addition to being lawyers, understanding the farm laws, and supporting the farm laws, also not really fans of the ruling government.\n\nthe agitating farmers have rejected each and every offer made by the government.  this last offer to suspend the laws for 18 months was an effort to get the confidence of the farmers and get them disband from their protest site while negotiations continue with the government.\n\nthe farmers did not outright reject this offer.  if they had done that, they could have been given benefit of doubt besides points for conviction.  instead they asked for a day to respond.\n\nwhat did they do in this day?  it is very likely that the government offer to suspend the law for 18 months was something the farmers had not foreseen and were unprepared for.  the fact that they asked for a day to respond confirms two things.  one, that the farmers sitting across the table with the government does not have the autonomy to negotiate with the government.  two, and more importantly, the fact that they were not prepared for government offer of moratorium means they have a different game in mind.\n\nso it is very likely that the farmers communicated with the people who are managing them.  the fact that the farmers asked for a day to respond made it inevitable that they will reject the offer.  the people who are managing them told them nothing doing.  they want what they paid for.\n\nthe protesting farmers now find themselves trapped.  the reasonable offer of 18 month moratorium should have been accepted.  by rejecting this offer, the farmer protests are now that much more difficult to defend.\n\nthe next action by the indian government would be 'our every offer was rejected.  now we are withdrawing from the talks.'\n\nthe government will not ask the farmers to disband.  nor will the government force the protest to disband.  they will just walk out of the negotiations and let the farmers continue their peaceful protests for as long as they need.  the emphasis on peaceful.\n\nthe farmers have three moves left.  disband and go home, continue protesting peacefully, or become violent.  if the farmers are really autonomous, they will do the first thing.  if they have some measure of control over their actions, they will insist on doing the second thing.  but, as is becoming evident, if they are puppets completely under control of some other powers, they will be forced to do the third thing.\n\nso government walks out, farmer protests turn violent.  what next?  well the world has seen that the farmers are irrational and unwilling to negotiate.  the world has also seen that farmers all over the rest of the country are reaping the benefits of the new farm laws.  if this farmer protest turns violent, it will be impossible to support them.\n\nunfortunately that is all that is left to happen.  so people in delhi best move out of there for a month or so."<br />Author: 'homeyside'<br />id: 'l2hry4'<br />Flair ::news: Unverified</li>

The ambulances donated by a Calcutta businessman were, in fact, used by her nuns as taxis to ferry around in Calcutta. Her nuns refused to pick up dying persons within even 200 meters of the compassion house. (Chatterjee has recorded his telephone conversations with the nuns and reproduced them verbatim in the book). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; In this book, Chatterjee brings to our notice that scores of persons whose criminality has already been established and exposed have been declared saints by the Vatican (i.e., the Popes). In Mother Teresa’s case, the Catholic Church in Calcutta ascribed the miracle of curing an Adivasi woman, Monica Besra, with an abdominal tumour caused by tuberculosis to the grace of Mother Teresa. The miracle cure was announced on 1 October 2002. That it was not a miracle cure but the outcome of a medical treatment was asserted by the doctors who medicated her and by the Superintendent of the Balurghat Hospital. \n\nBook Name:  *The Untold Story* \n\nBook Author: Aroup Chatterjee\n\nInfo credit: Swarajyamag'<br />Author: 'Meet_Me_In_Heaven'<br />id: 'l1wkcj'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'About the Bhagavad Gita and why I think equating our gods with others is completely wrong'<br />Body: "I used to think Krishna said that other gods are the same as him and that worshiping other gods is the same as worshiping him. \n\nNot exactly. There are a couple of times that Krishna says quite clearly that other than him, all are lesser and worshiping them will not lead you to him.\n\nI am doing this because according to me, there is no fucking way in hell that those abrahamic cult gods are the same as ours. \n\nBhagavad Gita verses, using Ramanujan's translation: \n\n7:07\n\n&gt;मत्तः परतरं नान्यत्किञ्चिदस्ति धनञ्जय।  \nमयि सर्वमिदं प्रोतं सूत्रे मणिगणा इव।।   \n&gt;  \n&gt;I am absolutely superior to all in two ways: 1) I am the cause of both the Prakrtis and I am also their controlling master (Sesin). This controllership over inanimate nature is exercised through the animate Prakrti (the Jivas) who form the inner controller (Sesin) of their bodies which are constituted of inanimate nature. 2) I am supreme to all in another sense also - as the possessor of knowledge, power, strength etc., in an infinite degree. There is no entity other than Me with such attributes of an eal or superior nature. The aggregate of all the animate and inanimate things, whether in their causal state or in the state of effect, is strung on Me who abides as their Self, as a row of gems on a thread. They depend on Me.  \n\n7:20\n\n&gt;कामैस्तैस्तैर्हृतज्ञानाः प्रपद्यन्तेऽन्यदेवताः।  \nतं तं नियममास्थाय प्रकृत्या नियताः स्वया।।  \n&gt;  \n&gt; All men of this world are controlled, i.e., constantly accompanied by their own nature consisting in the Vasanas (subtle impressions) resulting from relation with the objects formed of the Gunas. Their knowledge about My essential nature is robbed by various Karmas, i.e., by objects of desire corresponding to their Vasanas (subtle impressions) born of their Karmas and constituted of Gunas. In order to fulfil these various kinds of desires they take refuge in, i.e., seek and worship, other divinities who are regarded as different from Me, such as Indra and others, observing various disciplines, i.e., practising rituals which are specially meant to propitiate only these divinities. \n\n7:23\n\n&gt;अन्तवत्तु फलं तेषां तद्भवत्यल्पमेधसाम्।  \nदेवान्देवयजो यान्ति मद्भक्ता यान्ति मामपि।।   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The men of small understanding means those whose understanding is poor, who worship only Indra and other divinities. The fruit of their worship is small and finite. Why? The worshippers of divinities like Indra go to the divinities. And Indra and other divinities possess limited joy and live only for a limited time. So if they attain eality of enjoyment with them, they also fall down along with them in due course; but My devotees, knowing that their acts are of the nature of My worship, renouncing attachment for finite, fruits, reach Me, having for their purpose the pleasing of Me alone. That is, they never more return to Samsara. \n\n8:16\n\n&gt;आब्रह्मभुवनाल्लोकाः पुनरावर्तिनोऽर्जुन।  \nमामुपेत्य तु कौन्तेय पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते।।   \n&gt;  \n&gt;All the worlds, from the realm of Brahma included in the Brahmanda (cosmic sphere), are spheres in which experiences conferring Aisvarya (prosperity and power) can be obtained. But they are destructible and those who attain them are subject to return. Therefore destruction, i.e., return is unavoidable for the aspirants for Aisvarya, as the regions where it is attained perish. On the contrary there is no rirth to those who attain Me, the Omniscient, who has true resolves, whose sport is creation, sustentation and dissolution of the entire universe, who is supremely compassionate and who is always of the same form. For these reasons there is no destruction in the case of those who attain Me. He now elucidates the time-period settled by the Supreme Persons will in regard to the evolution and dissolution of the worlds upto the cosmic sphere of Brahma and of those who are within them. \n\nTl;dr - Just because Vishnu/Brahma/Shiva/Shakti can be the same does not mean lesser beings like the christian god or islamic god are the same. \n\nAt least, this is what I think after reading these verses.

Keep in mind this is speculation.\n\nThe bill, if put on hold, will be reinstated shortly before the 2024 elections, where Modi or the BJP can use it as a rallying call - the Punjabi unions, knowing this, would know they wouldn’t have enough political capital to continue the protests given that in a likely BJP win, they would have mass support for the bills.\n\nIn addition to their arrogance in denying talks and compromise, I suspect the Punjabi unions will reject this, and ask the government to never instate these types of bills again, or to give more concessions which the gov cannot give, thus - empowering the government.\n\nOr the government is a cuck, you decide'<br />Author: 'SmashRockCroc'<br />id: 'l1lyaq'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

My reasons for leaving are personal, but understand that I'm not leaving out of spite or contempt, rather simply to persue personal goals in life and to accomplish goals that have been otherwise sidetracked as of late, because of what I feel is an overindulgence in online debates that go nowhere and ultimately mean nothing.\n\n\n\nI have participated regularly and extensively in debates against those who have provided false information about history or those who have made incoherent and nigh malevolent representations of history.\n\n\n\nAmong the many topics that I have debated so stubbornly on is AMT, which for those of you who don't know is Aryan Migration Theory. It's what I believe in, it's what the facts prove to me and its what I'll continue to believe in. I won't make a point to leave behind an encyclopedia of data and information as a last hurrah, that would be childish and spiteful.\n\n\n\nThere have been many of you who have appreciated my posts, my comments and have expected me to remain active and to those I say, do not expect me to leave forever, there's a small chance I might come back. Take that for what you will.\n\n\n\nAnd to the friends I've made on this sub and on another we may call our own, I'd say, hopefully, in a while, when and if I do return, I'll have achieved what I wanted and the reason for my absence will have been fulfilled.\n\n\n\nWith all that said, I'll be signing off, with a couple of lines, that I feel have always uplifted my spirits and truly define the way I look at life.\n\n\n\n“Aaqabat  Manzil-e-Ma Wadi-e-Khamoshan-e-Ast\n\n\nHaliya Ghughula Dar Gunbad-e-Aflak Andaz”\n\n\n“The end of all our lives is the cemetery, \n\n\nPresently, raise tumult in the sky’s vault”\n\n\n\nFarewell."<br />Author: 'PushyamitraShunga1st'<br />id: 'l0xmsm'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

<li>Title: "It's very difficult to convert a liberal/secular to nationalism."<br />Body: 'Tried converting a communist supporter from Kerala by having some conversation. Here are some highlights.\n\n* She defended the KP genocide by saying it was the fault of the government and not that of Kashmiri Muslims.\n* When I showed her GemsofBollywood Twitter handle, she said what the Muslims did was justified because they constitute the majority in the industry. She said anti-Hindu content is justified because it is the fault of the Hindus that they did not get involved in the industry on a large scale.\n* She said I was brainwashed when I brought her attention to things that are happening in coastal Andhra and Nooh, Haryana. As per her, Hindus have never been under threat for the last 70 years. She denied that even after I presented her with evidence of Muslim riots against Hindus.\n* As per her, there has been no communal violence in Kerala to date, she is silent when I showed her instances when Muslims had in fact attacked Hindus in Kerala.\n\nHence, converting a secular is a difficult and near impossible process. To the randians who are reading this and laughing. Laugh all you want, but I am not going to give up. \n\nI am gonna keep trying till I succeed. Secularism is a drug and getting saffronpilled is the rehab.

<li>Title: 'Reincarnation in Hinduism [My Thoughts]'<br />Body: 'One of the most popular theory in Hinduism is Reincarnation of Soul and it\'s so much popular that even non Hindus believe it\n25% of Americans believe in Reincarnation even though bible doesn\'t have any concept of it.\n\nWhen i start reading Upanishads i always thought how is it even possible mainly because in most of the Hindu sacred texts it\'s clearly written that there is no individual soul like in Christianity and Islam\nIn Hinduism there is a single cosmic soul called Atman.\n\nThere are multiple verses in multiple Upanishads here are some examples\n\n&gt;The wise man beholds all beings in the self and the self in all beings; for that reason, he does not hate anyone. – Isha Upanishad\n\n&gt;He who perceives all beings in the self alone, and the self in all beings, does not entertain any hatred on account of that perception. – Ishavasya Upanishad\n\n&gt;That which is consciousness alone which is all-pervading, which is eternal, which is all-full, which is of the form of bliss and which is indestructible, is the only true brahman (infinite consciousness). – Varaha Upanishad\n\n&gt;These (sixteen names) destroy the Avarana (or the centripetal force which produces the sense of individuality) of Jiva surrounded by the sixteen Kalas (rays).  - Kali-Santarana Upanishad\n\n&gt;By mistaking the self to be the individual soul,\nas a rope for a serpent, one is subject to fear.\nBut if he realises, "I am not the individual soul,\nbut the Supreme Self," then he is free from fear. - Atmabodha\n\nThe Kali Santarana Upanishad literally tell us to break the thought of individuality \n\nIn Bhagwad Gita Shree Krishna said it doesn\'t even matter if you think soul exist or not (individual soul lives forever or die)\n\n&gt;BG 2:26 - If, however, you think that the soul is perpetually born and always dies, still you have no reason to lament, O mighty-armed arjuna.\n\nSo one thing is clear that there is no individual soul but a single cosmic soul.\n\nSo how is it possible for reincarnation?\n\nIn Abrahamic Religion people bury the Dead because they believe that one day there will be a judgement of God and everyone will wake up from the coffin\nthatswhy they protect the body and bury it \n\nHowever in Hinduism we cremate the body because we want the body to be fully decompose and spread to the environment because the ashes of the body will get mixed with soil where trees, bacteria, food grow and technical you became that tree or bacteria or that food which others will eat and you become part of them the water in your body will be evaporated and get mixed in atmosphere which get back in form of rain and the cycle continues\n\n\n&gt;Arvin Ash has made a video on that \nhttps://youtu.be/nTH1t-ZuRjs\n\nAnd yeah technically you get reborn again as different creatures and after million of years that part of you can again become a complex creature maybe even human (Thatswhy it\'s Written in many purans that human life is very hard and rare)\n\nThere is no individual soul which is going to transfer from one body to another your whole body is going to transform.\n\nSo what about the Theory of Karma?\n\nDoes it means our actions doesn\'t affect our next life? \n\nIf you think karma affect next life or you are facing bad things because of bad karma in your past life i think you have not understood the doctrine of karma properly.\n\nRead my Article on Casteism -\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/ev1ek8/casteism_in_hinduism_important/'<br />Author: 'fringehindu'<br />id: 'l0dz9w'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm 🕉️</li>

I believe that we should alienate art from sentiments and divorce it from the artist to allow creative freedom and genuine appreciation of good ideas. I would like to hear dissenting opinions by this community as to why it is bad to ridicule Hindu deities.  \nFrom what I've understood, in the sanatan culture. criticism and ridicule were always accepted even in ancient India. Apparently the carvakas were known to ridicule and insult the vedas and adopt a materialistic approach to the world and this was accepted as intellectual diversity has always been welcomed in the sanatan culture. As for insults, there have been multiple instances in our religious scriptures and books where the mere men as well as kings have insulted the gods and even fought with them sometimes even claiming victory so if the gods themselves are not immune to such disrespect then why is it that we have to take offence on their behalf ?  \nThis is not a criticism aimed at people who get offended but rather a genuine introspection as to why any such disrespect is offensive"<br />Author: 'FightPatriotFight'<br />id: 'l0bcly'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Is to get peacefully divided into friendly states... Kinda like balcans. \n\nModi tries but it's futile..
