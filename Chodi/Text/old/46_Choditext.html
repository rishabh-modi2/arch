<li>Title: 'Is Hinduphobia a correct term?'<br />Body: 'It‚Äôs more like Hindu-‚Äúhatred‚Äù or whatever the Latin of hatred is.\n\nThere doesn‚Äôt seem to be fear of Hindus (which ironically does exist for a particular community who has record of blowing stuff up and thus is definitely feared if they say a certain phrase on a flight)\n\nThere is deep rooted hatred and definitely not a single ounce of fear. Same could be said about things like homophobia too. There‚Äôs not a single ounce of fear but pure hatred alone. But I digress. Let‚Äôs stay on hinduphobia. \n\nIf there was fear, dare they‚Äôd have ridiculed any deity or symbol of Hinduism on comedy stage, Twitter or any public platform otherwise like Dawoodwood or web series, but obviously. \n\nNow it‚Äôs not possible to do so with certain communities which will detach these FoE evangelists‚Äô head from bodies when they do it. So is it really correct to call it hinduphobia lit. Fear of Hindus, and not Hindu hatred?'<br />Author: 'shresth2004'<br />id: 'l96yd9'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Why large scale organized conversion is cancerous to India.'<br />Body: " Hinduism is not an organized or expansionist belief system. We are not in the same category as Christianity and Islam. We are unprepared to face their organize, mobilize, preach and proselytize approach + aggressive jingoism that they bring. How the hell do liberals expect us to overlook this ? why does the supreme court not take this into consideration ? Also, Hinduism is the only thing that most people in most states innately have in common. Neither do we all speak the same language, nor do we have the same sub-cultures, clothing, food, literature, empires or history (pre-1947). We have unique regional characters and are an extremely intricate and complex society. Abrahamic religions by their very nature will always try to straitjacket our society as they are fixated on unity. Since there is no unity in diversity they will cut quantity for quality to make it happen. They are dualist, conformist and orderly. They have no patience or consideration for our pluralistic world view. They are just not viable for India. If they reach a significant enough population, their respective thresholds for harmony will break, making them more emboldened, pushing them to consolidate their positions and push further and further until none of us are left and rip the country is ripped apart in the process. Now if we jeopardize our only pan identity, what do we relate to each other with ? To those armchair philosophers and 'rational' atheists who say, 'religion doesn't matter only constitution does' Why do you think Kashmir is an issue ? why do you think that the NE are so disconnected and feel so distant from mainland India ? Why for that matter are Khalistan or Dravida Nadu even being entertained at a political level ? Do these places have an entirely separate constitution ? The sheer lack of grit of our people to get our asses in order is so frustrating. Our first priority should be banning dubious NGOs which are just front businesses for evangelical and groups to launder money and run their illicit hot gospel conversion racketeering. If we don't resist the breaking India forces...we will be bred our converted out of existence.**Show less**"<br />Author: 'Anime-X-Kshatriya'<br />id: 'l8z2qs'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

<li>Title: 'Is Democracy actually suited to India?'<br />Body: 'I actually don‚Äôt think Democracy is the right form of government for India. The main reason why I believe this is because all policies, laws or decisions that government makes are to have political gains. No matter which party forms the government, winning the elections has become their main priority. All the policies are made for the vote banks of the political party, and not for the overall benefit of the country. Politics based on religion, caste, still exist only because the government fear of losing the next election. \n\nI think if a government doesn‚Äôt make a law which is actually beneficial for the country, only because of the fear of losing the next election then that‚Äôs not at all justified. What I believe is that a single person should rule the entire country for a particular duration of time without being afraid of getting voted off in the next election. A committee should be made to guide that person, but the ultimate power should lie in that one person‚Äôs hand. All that we would have to do is find that one person who can run a country without being self-centered and with a dedication to India and its diversity. \n\nThis may be sounding absurd but I say this because I don‚Äôt think any party currently existing in India has any motivation than to have personal gains. We have to agree that people of India are not so well educated to fully understand politics and are often used by political parties to win elections. Also, it takes infinite time to make a law or give justice to a case. No firm policies are made. No one follows the law. Even anti-national elements are entertained in the country. \n\nI am not taking side of any political party. I just said what I wanted to say. I don‚Äôt exactly know the alternative if not democracy, but I sure believe that democracy is not the form of government suited for India. Maybe a new type of Govt., After-all Democracy is an age-old concept.'<br />Author: 'shinigami0099uyyuo'<br />id: 'l8me3z'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'How Kejriwal and AAP involved with Pro Khalistan and how they do financial fraud!'<br />Body: ' \n\nIn November 2015, AAP‚Äôs Sanjay Singh and Ashutosh went to Canada and the USA along with few other leaders for a donation drive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img vvjfwceb8be61...*\n\n \n\nAbout this trip, Ashutosh said that "The Indians working in Canada not only hold economic power because of the money they send back but can also influence voters. More importantly, they are also a major source of funds for the party" They receive major funds from USA, Canada &amp; UK.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/veoysjmg8be61.jpg?width=680&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=084e1e98b4d036c7bfc6497b5fafc6de3e30a20a\n\n \n\nIn 2015 Sanjay Sing visited Canada 2 times. But interestingly you won‚Äôt find any details about his second visit to the public domain! In that visit, they met so many pro-Khalistani leaders and discussed the future plan Pro-Khalistani Leaders have promised them huge financial support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/38o1nlcl8be61.jpg?width=680&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83326306ea9c48642bc1589b55b95701c28709fb\n\n \n\nNow let‚Äôs see how AAP is involved in Farmer\'s protest on the ground. In December 2020 few NRI reached to Protest site by claiming that they are here to support farmers, but actually, they are AAP‚Äôs Canada Unit! They all were here during the Punjab election, you can see it in the below news.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pefv2imw8be61.jpg?width=680&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4886d283e1213c4c4417d8c582883fe3bf4e79d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0m40mphx8be61.jpg?width=680&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbe317856d875b0b4ed49748ed3241c0aad677ca\n\n \n\nDuring Election in Punjab Kejariwal stayed in the house of Khalistan Liberation Front (KLF) terrorist Gurwinder Singh. Not only that, terrorists were openly campaigning for AAP in the Punjab election.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12ox4z339be61.jpg?width=680&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1629ed3d6cf7bcfe7af52c1f06f689b6f312e35f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lv6mtd049be61.jpg?width=680&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5531c6956c6612ec11ac52f7a6329794f3196d49\n\nKejriwal was in IRS before starting AAP and was working as a Joint Commissioner of IT in New Delhi. During his job, he knows how shell companies were used to route the money from tax heaven countries! He used this knowledge to route the illegal money for him as an AAP‚Äôs donation.\n\n \n\nEarlier [@KapilMishra\\_IND](https://twitter.com/KapilMishra_IND) exposed Kejriwal‚Äôs hawala connection where AAP had taken 2 crore donations through shell companies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1zhlgo5e9be61.jpg?width=680&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7a1145d3d574b6e3378d4b0117fc89c4b74b815\n\nIn August 2020 Mukesh Kumar and Shudhansu Bansal have been arrested by Delhi Police for this fraud. They were running four shell companies  SKYLINE METAL AND ALLOYS PRIVATE LIMITED Goldmine Buildcon Pvt Ltd, Sun Vision Agencies Pvt Ltd, and Infolance Software Solutions Ltd.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img g7ziqulj9be61...*\n\n As per the police report, There was a huge infusion of money in these companies by way of share premium amount, but the sources from where the money had come were not disclosed. Kejriwal knows this is just the tip of his fraud and soon his all frauds will come out. \n\nHe has misused his experience of IRS to create shell companies to route the money. After demonetization, he had fears that he will be exposed very soon. That‚Äôs why he is supporting all propaganda that harms our country. \n\n[Bogus donations came from / and how AAM AADMI PARTY  tried to manage/manipulate in the most deceitful manner.](https://sites.google.com/site/liesaapspreads1/aam-aadmi-party-nexus-vs-demonetization/ongoing-investigations-into-hawalaatmidnight/aap-ka-bogus-donations) \n\nCredit goes to @/vijaygajera on Twitter'<br />Author: 'bibyanaman'<br />id: 'l7zi02'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Is tarah ek brotherhood ban jata hai ye dikha ke ki hum sab oppressed hain sabka maqsad ek hai. Hum milke fateh hasil karege. Aur misguided youth aur Guided youth(you know who) ek dusre ke lie kuch bhi krne ko tayyar ho jate hain.\n\n\nüëáüèΩ\n\nAb aap maan lo Pakistan ko hara dia chalo china USA hara dia dunia jeet li. Lekin in farzi Che Guevara ka kya karoge? Aap poori duniya se lad sakte ho lekin jab baat ghar ki aati hai to akhir me honi aapki haar hi hai. Is baat ko thande dimag se sochie. Kya inse aap lad paoge? Kabhi nahi kyuki yahi youth aage chal kar scientist,Dr , Army, Police, IAS etc banega. Yoon keh lo ki system ka hissa banega aur apne yahi views aage leke jayega.\n\nüëáüèΩ\n\nAb jab ye log apni soch sabke saamne layege to Videshi taqate lapak ke iska fayada uthate hai.

Inki jagah un Jaychandon ka kuch karna chahiye jo is poore cycle ko peddle krte hain.\n\nDono surato me hum itne kamzor ho jayege ki desh ladkhada jayega.\n\nYe kuch vaisa hi hai ki ek tree ki apne roots kaat di ab ya to ped ka girna pakka hai.\n\nüëáüèΩ\n\nAb faisla apko krna hai, aap us mod pe khade hain jaha apka lia faisla desh ka apka ya apke bachho ka nahi balki ane vali generations ka future decide kerege.'<br />Author: 'Nuclear-Purge'<br />id: 'l7rdm3'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'How to contact Modi Ji?'<br />Body: 'I have seen lot of people being frustrated and ranting on the subreddit about the state of hindus, India and how BJP is not doing anything on the root level (eg. narrative building or supporting scholars, researchers, youtubers, journalists, think tanks etc). I get their concern and frustration, because I feel the same helplessness. \n\nWe are posting these rants on this sub. No doubt these posts help keep the fire of patriotism and sense of duty toward rashtra and dharam ignited within the people who genuinely want our country to be a "Vishwa guru". But my concern is that these posts are only limited to the members of this sub. The voice and cry of people like us should and must reach the people in power who can be the catalyst of the indic renaissance.  These powerful people can be at political, bureaucratic and economical positions.\n\nI am not confident if this is the case. According to my reading of all these protests and 6 years of the govt. there is no significant narrative building by Modi Ji or the BJP. They are always in the trap of "western media kya kahegi" (I hope I am wrong).  One guy earlier posted that the farmers in UP are thinking the govt. will take away their lands. This is the miscommunication between the citizens and the govt. You cannot always blame the oppositions and vested interest groups for spreading misinformation among the people. If they are drawing a 10 cm line then you have to draw 11 cm line. I want to say if they (western media + communists + islamist + khalistanis + ISI + evangelists + chinese+ ghar ke bhedi) are making a narrative about us (hindus and BJP govt), then we have to counter that narrative with our own narrative which is currently lacking.  If not then we are trying to fight a loosing battle.\n\nAt last I want to  ask all of you, please if you have family members or connections in BJP or govt. or IAS or big business houses, please ask them to convey the concerns to the BJP high command. Also how can we send these rants directly to modi ji, amit shah, yogi ji etc so they are made aware of the will of the sanatanis.'<br />Author: 'helloworld090'<br />id: 'l7n010'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Hindu Weakness'<br />Body: 'This is somewhat of a rant but bear with it.  I\'m sick and tired of seeing posts on social media by so-called right wingers about how great India is for providing millions of vaccines to countries like Banglastan (where they regularly destroy temples and kill Hindus) and Nepal (which is an anti-Hindu communist state).  These countries will take a photo with Modi then go back to persecuting Hindus, and that genius will continue to ignore the persecution of Hindus and serve them like a dog.  India doesn\'t need these countries and they wouldn\'t help India even if it did need them.\n\nThe fundamental mistake Hindu losers make is that they think others see an act of kindness as just that and not a weakness to be taken advantage of.  This is easily observed in personal interactions as well.  No one likes the nice guy no matter how much he bends over for people who hate him.  They will use him then laugh at him.  This is also evident with the way the filthy leftists treat Modi despite all the good things he has done.  They will always slander him and Hindus so why not just be "oppressive right wing Hindus" like they portray us to the world?  Modi has done a lot of good for Hindus, but he still seems to have the "Hindu" mentality of a slave and not that of an Aryan.\n\nThis isn\'t even to mention that several more will die in India because those doses could have gone to them (India isn\'t a rich country where it can afford to hand out doses to everyone without opportunity costs; it is a zero sum game).  Why the hell is a so-called right wing Hindu party continuing to be pacifist pushovers without any sense of shame?  Are they really that stupid? Now is the time to be aggressive.  We need more of Yogi Adityanath (and even more fierce than him).\n\nTo add to this, when close to 3 million Hindus were killed and hundreds of thousands raped in Banglastan in 1971 (yes, just 50 years ago), and Indian soldiers could have punished porkis and bongis and conquered the land, why did we give it up and do nothing (a vast Hindu majority voted for Indira gandi\'s party of deshdrohis or other leftist parties and continued to do so).  Are Hindus really that dumb?  After millenia of buddu, goat-loving, and rice-bag rule, why are Hindus so self-defeating and dense?  Animals have much higher self-preservation instincts than 90% of Hindus.  Even now, the majority of Hindus vote for anti-Hindu parties.  You don\'t see this level of self-hatred and stupidity anywhere else in the world or in any other community.'<br />Author: 'Arya4948'<br />id: 'l7mcu2'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

<li>Title: 'The Story Of The Shiva Tandava Stotra'<br />Body: "We all know that King RƒÅvana was a great devotee of Lord Shiva. Some of you might even know that the Shiva Tandava Stotra was composed by Ravana. But how and why? Let us go through the events. \n\nThe events happen a long time ago, before the events of the Ramayana. \n\n&gt;RƒÅvana, who was then known as Dashanan was flying around the universe in his Pushpak Vimana. But when he got near a certain spot, his Pushpaka Vimana abruptly stopped.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Dashanan was disturbed by this. This had never happened before. So he went to investigate. He soon found that it was due to Mount Kailash that his Pushpaka Vimana had stopped.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Mountain(Kailash) asked Dashanan to change his route since Lord Shiva and Devi Parvati are resting on the top of the mountain.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Of course, Dashanan did not listen. He dismissed the mountain's words and lifted the mountain to move it somewhere else. Due to his immense strength, this was even possible. For a moment, Kailash was lifted, and the universe was in imbalance as Kailash is said to be the center of the universe.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;As you can imagine, Lord Shiva was not pleased. In fact, he was furious that someone dared to try and move *him* from his place. As much as he is Bholenath(*one who is easily pleased*), perhaps Dashanan forgot that Lord Shiva is also Bhairava(*the manifestation of pure rage*).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lord Shiva stopped meditating and placed one toe on the ground. The pressure from Shiva's toe sent Dashanan straight to Patala. The pressure from Shiva's toe caused immense pain to Dashanan and *his cry of pain shook the three worlds***.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Raav/RƒÅv means 'crying in agony', and since this cry of agony shook the three worlds, Lord Shiva gave Dashanan a new name. RƒÅvana.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, Shiva did not lift his toe. He kept it pressed to the ground, and even RƒÅvana with all his strength was not able to even budge it.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;RƒÅvana realized he had greatly angered Lord Shiva, and upon the advise of Narada Muni, he chanted stotras for 14 days straight, begging for Lord Shiva's forgiveness, but Lord Shiva still did not lift his toe.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;On the 14th day it was Pradosha, and during the sunset, RƒÅvana chanted the Shiva Tandava Stotra with such devotion and perfect rhythm that Devi Parvati felt pity for RƒÅvana and asked Lord Shiva to free him. Lord Shiva finally lifted his toe from the ground. \n\nThis is a link to the Shiva Tandava Stotra: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_crtZ3lSXqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_crtZ3lSXqY)\n\nThe Shiva Tandava Stotra and the meaning of each verse:\n\n&gt; Jatatavigalajjala pravahapavitasthale  \nGaleavalambya lambitam bhujangatungamalikam  \nDamad damad damaddama ninadavadamarvayam  \nChakara chandtandavam tanotu nah shivah shivam\n\nWith his neck consecrated by the flow of water that flows from his hair,  \nAnd on his neck a snake, which is hung like a garland,  \nAnd the Damaru drum that emits the sound ‚ÄúDamat Damat Damat Damat‚Äù,  \nLord Shiva did the auspicious dance of Tandava.

Like the jaats there were convinced that they are going to loose their land if the bill doesn't get repealed. They actually believe they will loose their lands. And if a farmer believes they will loose their lands they will go to any length to protect it. Government has to change the perception in villages first, it's completely radical.

<li>Title: 'Farm Bills ( Detailed Analysis )'<br />Body: 'The new farm bill was created by the BJP government to promote more buyers for Farm products so the Indian agriculture industry can move forward which seems to be stuck in a cataclysm. It includes three acts Farmers\' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.\n\nExactly how does this bill tend to achieve that? Well, the government has made plenty of changes.\n\nFarmers will be able to sell their crops outside of APMC yards / Mandis. Farmers will have no restriction on where they want to sell their product. This bill is designed to expand the areas for farmers to trade, with this the Farmers can trade anywhere in the country in "any place of production, collection, aggregation". It also gives farmers access to inter-state and intra-state trading. But it does not make APMC yards / Mandis obsolete as they will be functioning as always.\n\nProhibits State government to collect any market fees from trades, farmers or traders that happens outside of govt designated Mandis. This is done to make trades easier and cheaper.\n\nIt provides a legal framework for the contracts that are made between farmer/farmers and the buyer/buyers/buying firm. The government has taken care to ensure that farmers will not be taken advantage of as such as:-\n\n1. The farmer may only enter the agreement if it includes the time of supply, quality, grade, standards, price, and such other matters; and it includes the terms related to supply of farm services.\n\n2. The length of an agreement is a minimum of one crop cycle / one production cycle and up to 5 years maximum unless farmer and buyer agree on extending the length.\n\n3. Both parties can adopt a quality and grade standard and the buyer can check on crops during their cycle to ensure no problems arise on the day of deliver.\n\n4. The buyer will guarantee to pay for the produce which is mentioned in the agreement. The buyer will agree to pay a sum of a guaranteed amount to the farmer. An additional bonus or premium can be also specified to ensure the best value to the farmer and such price may be linked to the prevailing prices of APMC yard / Mandis, or any other suitable benchmark prices.\n\n5. The responsibility of picking up the trade at the designated time at the trade gate and make necessary arrangements for picking up the produce falls on the buyer.\n\n6. The payment to farmers should be done. In most cases, the farmers should be paid at the time when the buyer is accepting the produce and issue a receipt to farmers unless. In cases Where it relates to seed production, in which 2/3 of payment should be done when the agriculture produce is handed over and 1/3 of payment should be done after certification or within 30 days of trade.\n\n7. The agreement cannot be made to modify the land or erect a structure / change structures within it unless it is agreed upon and the structure is removed by the buyer by the end of the agreement. If the structure is not removed by end of the agreement than the structure will be owned by the farmer  \n\nIt makes a conciliation board to help with any disputes that arise within the agreement, the board will have the power to settle the dispute with the agreement of both parties. And if the dispute is not solved by the said board then the case will be taken to Sub-District Magistrate in which the Sub-District Magistrate shall have the authority of the civil court. This process is done so the farmers may not end up in the long battles in courts which usually drags for months if not year, and in this time the produce can go array.\n\nIt removes the limit added to cold storage for storing cereals, pulses, potatoes, onions, edible oilseeds, and oils, by removing it from essential commodities except under ‚Äòextraordinary circumstances‚Äô. Rather than base the stock limit on the type of produce it tries to restrict it based on its increase in produce‚Äôs price.\n\nWhat are the concerns of farmers and people?\n\nQ) The MSP will be affected by removing the role of APMC yard / mandis.\n\nAns) False as the bill does not make APMC yard / mandis absolute and merely gives an option to farmers to trade their produce outside the mandis and also do electronic trades. Since doing this will not have any charges on trades by the government. The farmers can sell in APMC if they wish to. The mandis are removed so the farmers can sell anywhere they wish. This bill also removes the restrictions on inter-state trades and pushes the idea of ‚ÄòOne India, One Agriculture Market‚Äô.\n\nQ) The government will not buy crops or will not buy crops under MSP.\n\nAns) The government mainly buys wheat, paddy, and pulses. This bill mentions nothing of as such about govt not buying the wheat, paddy, and pulses as they used to buy and it is likely government will not stop doing it since they need these crops for various schemes they run.\n\nQ) The government wishes to trade land to big corporations\n\nAns) False, as this bill bars any modification to land in its agreements. And farmers will always have the choice to not trade with these corporations if they chose to.\n\nQ) The states that have abrogated the APMC act has degraded their agriculture industry\n\nAns) Contrary to popular belief many states allow contractual farming and have made changes to APMC. The example that many people give to point out faults in allowing these changes is Bihar. As even Rahul Gandhi tweeted how Bihar was ruined due to these changes. But let‚Äôs see some facts.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/cvs6ok342e461.png?width=961&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bda615d8d6694bdca5857e5b58af4ad5b54ea5db](https://preview.redd.it/cvs6ok342e461.png?width=961&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bda615d8d6694bdca5857e5b58af4ad5b54ea5db)\n\n(Source: The Print) \n\nAs you can see Bihar is doing better than the national average in spite that Bihar has less land for cultivation as compared to let‚Äôs say Punjab. Yes, the Bihar‚Äôs farmer earns less as of now but they used to earn even lesser and now their industry is growing at an exponential rate as compared to Punjab‚Äôs growth which is regressing. The cycle of wheat -paddy ‚Äì wheat is what is destroying many state\'s land and agricultural produce. This law tries to push a variety of crops for production.\n\nQ) Farmers will not receive their due.\n\nAns) As mentioned above the law covers the basic right of farmers, which is to ensure they get considerable profits from their produce, and it has given many guidelines to ensure that. Like Farmers getting the price of their produce at the exact time of selling it, unless it is seed production in which they will receive 2/3 of their price on trade and 1/3 within 30 days at most.\n\nQ) Removing the limit on storage will increase the price for wheat, etc.\n\nAns) The bill states that the crops for which the storage limit has been removed are food items including cereals, pulses, potato, onion, edible oilseeds, and oils. The government has also ensured that the restrictions will be imposed but not pre-determined from start but will be imposed based on the increase in the price of crops. So, if the price of a certain crop for example if the price of Potato increases by a lot then the government will impose restrictions on its storage so more potatoes will be sold in the market.\n\nQ) The government is taking the right of farmers to go to civil court in case if a dispute arises between buyer refuses from conditions of agreement made.\n\nAns) The government has not taken the right of Farmers but the government has given the power of the civil court to SDMs since it can take very long to reach the case in courts and SDMs will act and hold the authority of the civil court in their decrees to settle the disputes. This will ensure that farmers will receive justice in due time.'<br />Author: 'TheManWhoSayHello'<br />id: 'l6tbje'<br />Flair :National üì∞</li>

BJP knew it, opposition knew it and so did common people.  \nAb dekh ke lagta hai jese the only plan BJP have is to wait for such protests to become violent so  \n that they can have upper hand. Same shaheen bagh ke sath hua tha nd same aaj hua hai.   \nIts obvious ki ab ye protest zada din tikne wala nahi hai. \n\nBut my problem is ki ye govt kaand hone se pehle he cheeze solve nhi kr pati. Ye log intentionally wait krte hain kab ham upper ground claim kr sake.  \n\n\nMe kabhi nahi chahta tha ki farm bills vapas ho kyuki agar 1 bar kr dia to har dusre bill ko  erase krne ke lie har koi protest pe bethne lagega aage se. Jese ki same cheez ho chuki hai protest ko leke. Ab ye common ho chuka hai desh me ki aap aao or sarke raste block krdo protest ke naam pe nd govt wo krne degi. Shaheen bagh me agar protest itna lamba na chalne dia hota to aaj ye protest dekhne ki nobat he na aati. \n\nUpar se modiji to har samay chuppi saadhe bethe hote hai. 1st term me to aake mast bolte the.

<li>Title: 'Viewing Indian Politics through the Western Lens'<br />Body: 'Indian politics are being viewed through a western lens and it does not do them justice.  \nThe concept of "Left wing - Right Wing" are western concepts and I don\'t believe Indian politics should be viewed through that perspective.  \nNow firstly there is no economic right wing in India. Elections are won on promises of subsidies and reservations. Secondly people just believe that certain parties are right wing and the others are left because the media consistently refers to them like that however they wouldn\'t be able to tell you even 3 policy decisions of those parties that justify their position on the political spectrum.  \nFor Instance, BJP is traditionally viewed as a "right wing" party but are they though ? ask yourself if you can think of 3 policy decisions that have been enforced by the BJP that can be identified as traditionally right wing ? You might say that the farmers bills could qualify as one such decision but lets not forget those reforms had been on the congress manifesto as well.   \nAs for the repeal of section 377 from the IPC that has now led to the decriminalisation of homosexuality, the supreme court had written a letter to the congress as early as 2012 asking them what their opinion was on the section and the congress explicitly replied that it should still be a crime. However when the BJP was in power and the SC asked them for their opinions, the BJP didn\'t have a strong opinion and it allowed the court to take a decision themselves which eventually led to its decriminalisation, a decision which the BJP happily accepted.  \nThis is just among many examples that I can think of where policies have defied the apparent stance that parties are believed to have.'<br />Author: 'FightPatriotFight'<br />id: 'l4ts7x'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
