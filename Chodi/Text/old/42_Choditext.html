Today most Pvt banks in India are owned  from HDFC, ICICI, Axis, Bandhan Bank imagine most of the profit is going outside of India rather than staying within. Why do you think China has not allowed any foreign banks to have large stake in Chinese pvt banks? It because they want to keep the money within china and help China grow.

Ever since Rinku Sharma passed away, instead of protesting in Delhi with all his karyakartas, he is busy campaigning for WB elections and in Hyderabad, he raised money for the family. Is he trying to silence the poor family with such a huge amount of blood money so that they keep quiet? He actually has the power to make this into a mass scale agitation in Delhi, but he's busy roaming elsewhere. Delhi BJP seems to be doing just lipservice on social media platforms. Tejasvi Surya who staged big protests and even got attacked while protesting seems mum upon this. What's stopping Tejasvi Surya from making this into a mass scale agitation?

<li>Title: 'The reason P Chidambaram is relevant even today and how Congress still has money to spend.'<br />Body: "Chidambaram is a silent partner in Kalyan Jewellers. This is not official, for obvious reasons, but ask any jeweller or stock market trader to also traded in gold. They all know. Now PC, during his term as finance minister manipulated the stock market to artificially jack up the price of gold in the past 10 years or so. Gold has grown 5 fold just in the past 5 years. \n\nThere is nothing in the stock market that can guarantee this kind of growth over such a short period of time. As a result PC made thousands of cores, not hundreds mind you. And in a trade like this, you always take your friends along, and I believe he marked positions for the Congress party too.\n\nSo whenever you hear news saying Congress just has a few hundred cries in its party fund left, think Chidambaram and AK Antony and A Raja. Congress is swimming in cash, and a fund like this only grows over the years. It never depreciates. That's the money they use to fund unrest. Foreign funds I don't know, but Congress made more than enough during their regime with all the scams they had running.\n\nThis is also in response to all the Nirmala bashing I see on Indian subs. She's a saint compared to that thief Chidambaram. I prefer her as the FM any day over that swine.

<li>Title: 'Willoughby Wallace Hooper: Photographer of Death'<br />Body: "Hooper started photographing the famine around 1887. Zahid R Chaudhary has suggested in Afterimage of Empire (2012) that his photographs were sold commercially and circulated in private photograph albums. We know they were made into postcards.\n\nIn recording the victims of a great monsoon-driven famine in 1876-78 in which 10.3 million people starved to death, it was reported that Hooper had the skeletal sufferers brought to him in groups, neatly sorted by age and gender and that after photographing them, he sent them back, with no attempt to help them.\n\nSome of the photographs were shot outdoors, either in villages or more likely, in relief camps. In a few photographs the subjects are made to hold their poses in front of public buildings with neo-classical balustrades, while others appear to be shot in semi-studio setups. Evidently these are extremely fragile lives. ‚ÄúHe [Hooper] one evening selected seven persons whom he wished to photograph,‚Äù The Times of India reported, ‚Äúbut the light not being favourable he said he would come in the morning and photograph them. The next morning he came, and found that they had all died during the night.‚Äù\n\nWhile his motivations and ethics in producing and distributing the famine photographs remain moot, other Hooper images are more problematic still.  In 1885 he took part in the Third Burmese war as Provost Marshall of the Burma Expeditionary Force, recording the expedition in photographs. This was later published as Burmah, A series of one hundred photographs illustrating incidents connected with the British Expeditionary Force to that country from the embarkation at Madras, 1st November 1885, to the capture of King Theebaw, with many views of the surrounding country, native life and industries, and most interesting descriptive notes by Lieut-Col W W Hooper (1887). In the course of this campaign, Hooper recorded (and perhaps ordered) executions of prisoners. In one case he had his camera ready to record the moment the bullets struck their bodies.\n\nI'll end by saying that while it is easy to moralize about the action of Hooper at the time its worth keeping in mind that without this photographic record, we would not have visual record of what our people suffered. \n\nLinks:\n\n[Conscience](https://onthisdateinphotography.com/2017/04/21/april-21/) \n\n[Scroll Article](https://scroll.in/magazine/855532/who-was-the-photographer-who-took-these-dehumanising-images-of-the-madras-famine)\n\n[The Better India on twitter](https://twitter.com/thebetterindia/status/1189192672436719616)\n\n[Google](https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/willoughby-wallace-hooper/g11cmfh17y8?hl=en) some photos\n\n[Wiki Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Willoughby_Wallace_Hooper) - more photos.\n\n\nThe most ghoulish thing in the [Conscience](https://onthisdateinphotography.com/2017/04/21/april-21/) article is a pillow with a photo of starving Indians being [sold on Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/painting-Colonel-William-Willoughby-British/dp/B01GJH46L6).

They also make jokes on mostly the Hindu religion, which is offensive for many. However, accroding to me, religion and especially Hinduism is so strong a faith and is so great that one cannot even try to harm it by mocking it in any way. Many are saying that these comedians want to spread their propoganda and should be curbed, but this won't help in easing the situation. According to me, most of the audiences are nobody but harmless edgy teens. Lodging an FIR against someone's joke isn't the solution. The best thing to do according to me is to ignore them.

<li>Title: 'When someone tells you Hindus just defend - Remind them of the Hindu conqueror Rajendra Chola'<br />Body: "Dharmics always like to say they never went to war. They just fought when someone invaded them. The invaders called themselves conquerors with pride. But that was ok. Hindus were not conquerors. They fought back when invaded. Never mind the fact that the entire area from Afghanisthan to Burma were followers of Dharma. But Hindus were nice and docile. This narrative has contributed massively to the mental constitution of Hindus.\n\nThis narrative is what has led to the marginalization of the greatest Hindu **conqueror** \\- Rajendra Chola I, the son of the great Chola emperor Raja Raja Chola. The man who commanded a force of sixty thousand elephants. The man who reached the banks of the Ganga to take her water back to perform abhisheka at the Bridhadeeshwara temple. The man with an impressive navy that allowed him to spread Dharma all the way to Maldives, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The man who was the commander in chief of his own army leading the force from the front in true warrior fashion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img xg4b4hktagh61...*\n\nHe built numerous temples to Shiva, Vishnu and even Buddhist viharas. He also built Gangaikonda Cholapuram among many other temples. Contrary to some claims designed to split Hindus, he never destroyed places of worship from other faiths or even other sects. Kanchipuram's ancient temples and viharas are a testament to this.\n\nDear Hindus, no matter what your persuasion, I ask you one thing. Today, you bow your heads for a second in adoration, respect, or prayer to this great Emperor who spread Dharma. This king of kings who was written out of the history books. This Hindu conqueror.\n\nAnd when someone tells you that Hindus were not conquerors, imagine this son of Dharma charging with his army of 2 million cavalry units and 60,000 elephants..."<br />Author: 'dharmavaan'<br />id: 'ljp243'<br />Flair :Viraat Sanataniüö©</li>

The most beautiful temple city. A city where Sangam literature thrived. The sound of tiruppugazh and thiruvasagam rendering the air in the evenings along the beautiful holy river Tamaraparani. All this ended when the forces of the Delhi sultantae invaded Madurai. Malik Kafur the eunuch servant/general of Khilji invaded Madurai in 1311. The Meenakshi Amman temple was destroyed. Only one of the gopurams stood the remaining three demolished. Srirangam was captured and desecrated. The Madurai sultanate was established by Jalaluddin. The atrocities began.\n\nIbn Batuta, a Muslim traveled to Madurai in around 1340 BC. He speaks thusly of the atrocities of the killed Ghiyasuddin Dhamagani. Here are his excerpts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The Hindu prisoners were divided into four sections and taken to each of the four gates of the great catcar. There, on the stakes they had carried, the prisoners were impaled. Afterwards their wives were killed and tied by their hair to these pales. Little children were massacred on the bosoms of their mothers and their corpses left there. Then, the camp was raised, and they started cutting down the trees of another forest. In the same manner did they treat their later Hindu prisoners.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;One day whilst the Kadhi (Kazi) and I were having our food with (Ghiyazu-d-din), the Kazi to his right and I to his left, an infidel was brought before him accompanied by his wife and son aged seven years. The Sultan made a sign with his hand to the executioners to cut off the head of this man ; then he said to them in Arabic : 'and the son and the wife.' They cut off their heads and I turned my eyes away. When I looked again, I saw their heads lying on the ground.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost of us cannot even comprehend this evil. A more depraved bunch we could not envision. At that point most Hindus had lost hope. But as always, on the side of Dharma a warrior arose. The son of Emperor Bukka of Vijayanagara - Kumara Kampana Udaiyar. The warrior who would stand up nay charge against this incredible evil. The warrior who would risk it all to put an end to this evil and restore Dharma.\n\nHis exploits are chronicled in Madura Vijayam an epic poem. Legend says that he was visited by an old woman when he was in Kanchipuram. She implored him to liberate South India from the sultanate. More importantly, she asked him liberate the Meenakshi Amman temple and restore its sanctity. The prince decided. He would stand up to the barbarians. He would rescue Madurai. He would personally battle this evil.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis meant going to war against the barbarians and in modern day terms a group more psychotic than ISIS . Bukka and Kampana knew well what would happen to the prince in the event of a defeat. But prince Kampana in modern parlance was a badass - a legendary one at that backed by Dharma. Legend (and we Hindus for sure dismiss it as myth) says that the prince received a sword from the goddess Gangadevi.\n\nKampana began the battle. Troops of the Sultan fell in scores and finally the sultan himself arrived to fight. In an epic combat, Kampana destroyed the banner of the sultan, then the bowstring of the sultan. Finally, he beheaded the sultan. This is recounted in Madura Vijayam\n\n**The sultan incandescent with ire flung his bow and seized a fearsome sword. King Kampa in turn took hold of his sword sent to him by Agastya to vanquish the king, a blade dreadful as the dark lord of death. Kampa riding at a great gallop lpped off the sultan's head with his sword. The head of the sultan that had bowed to none now lay on the ground.**\n\nA fitting end for the evil tyrants. Kampa and the other vijayanagara Kings then restored the Srirangam temple and finally gained possession of Madurai.\n\nThis man was a Viraat Sanatani - in the words of you youngsters a legendary badass. \n\nThis prince who stood up to an unparalleled force of evil. This prince who spent his life battling for the adherents of Dharma whose descendants (though 1 billion in number) chose to throw him out of their collective conscious. Take a bow in reverence."<br />Author: 'dharmavaan'<br />id: 'lj1778'<br />Flair :Viraat Sanataniüö©</li>

And those who indulge in it will either go to hell or reborn as animals which is where there rightful place is so that they can indulge in free sex. \n\nThe prime reason for people ousted from Brahmin and Kshtraiya Varna was sexual morality . People who indulged in sexual immoral behavior were classified as lower caste and animals.\n\nIf Hinduism approves of sex outside of marriage then why do you think Hinduism is strictly against widow remarriage even if a woman is widowed at the age of 16 , she can't remarry. The reason is sexual purity and that a woman who has indulged in sex with one man is considered as impure and unfit for marriage .\nThis shows that in Hinduism sexual purity of woman is of prime importance. \n\nHinduism in no way approves of premarital sex.

It was refreshing to say the least, the memes were interesting, and the content was, at least 50 percent stemming from the truth, even when funny. \n\nAs the pinned message indicates, this is probably the most participated Indian sub on Reddit. Which is great for the regular centrist/RW leaning individual to visit.\n\nHowever, lately I have started observing that there is an influx of the whatsapp, facebook janta of India, which really deepfries the content presented here, and even the thin veil of respect, or acknowledgement is dissapearing.\n\nThe sheer treatment of other religions on here, makes me ashamed to call myself an emergent of Hinduism. I am not an Islam/Christian apologist, not even close (check my comment history), but dehumanising any group of people IS the first step towards fascism. It might note for you, but it WILL be for the 100s of participants joining in from Whatsapp and Facebook. Will they be able to show the same restraint?\n\nI read somewhere on Reddit, where they compared this sub with Donald, it was honestly heartbreaking, because I realise that the need and content of this sub is stemming from a reactionary standpoint where 'enough is enough' is a common underlying theme.\n\nI understand that we can see biases taking place in our country day-in day-out, I can see our friends getting braindrained due to Western propaganda, but calling them out in a way which makes them feel inhumane, worthless, will get you exactly the opposite of what you're trying to achieve. This is the same mistake that led to the Presidentship of Trump, because the left couldn't unite well and ended up creating so much differences amongst themselves that the problems still persist even under the administration of Biden.\n\nThe TLDR of this long rant is probably this, if you want to make jokes/memes, make intelligent ones, that don't make the sub seem like fanatical place for hindu radicals(believe it or not, it does seem like the case right now). The agitations in the country will lead to the influx of more rural and toughened whatsapp janta, if there is no reigning in of content right now, we will surely witness the definition of Hindu extremism very soon. And from what I know, Hinduism isn't about that.

This is not a sub I‚Äôd usually be in, but someone recommended that I discuss my experiences with others and get their opinions. The aim of this post is not to offend anyone, and I apologize in advance if this post were to be construed as offensive by some people. \n\nOver the last few years on social media, I have had certain experiences that have made me dislike Upper caste Hindus quite a lot. I did not grow up hating upper castes, even though my friends and classmates in school always joked about how easy life was going to be for me(cause reservations). I always assumed this to be light hearted ribbing among friends. \n\nAll this changed when I joined social media. Over the last few years, I have routinely faced casteist abuse(people telling to clean sewers like my ancestors, even though my family members were milkmen), I have been told how ‚Äúmy kind‚Äù want to trap upper caste girls(as if love happens only after knowing someone‚Äôs caste), I have been told how my people are only good for being slaves, and how women from my community can only be wh*res for UC men. \n\nWhen I first started receiving such abuse, I would always ask the abuser if not all Hindus were part of the Brahman? Wasn‚Äôt caste decided by your karma?\n\nThe responses I got for these questions were along the lines of:\n1. Caste is by birth alone, Krishna himself says your birth is decided by karma of your past lives. \n2. A shudra can only serve the other 3 varnas, him taking over roles of other varna will lead him to hell. \n\nThese were bitter pills to swallow. Who wants to live life as an indentured servant? Not me. And I doubt any else does either. Why shouldn‚Äôt I as a shudra not try to seek wealth? Why shouldn‚Äôt I try to achieve a life as comfortable as possible?\n\nIn response to these enquiries of mine, someone said(I will be repeating what they said in Hindi, I don‚Äôt know if I can translate this):‚Äù‡§Ø‡§π ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•á‡§µ‡§≤ ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§£‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≠‡•ã‡§ó ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§π‡•à, ‡§è‡§ï ‡§∂‡•Ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§π‡•ã‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•á ‡§®‡§æ‡§§‡•á ‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ‡•ç‡§π‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§π‡•à ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§£‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∏‡•á‡§µ‡§æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡§æ, ‡§á‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ ‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ ‡§Ö‡§ó‡§≤‡•á ‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§â‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡§ø ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§≤‡•á‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§≠‡•ã‡§ó ‡§∏‡§ï‡•ã‡§ó‡•á‡•§‚Äù\n\nNow that I have shared some of my life experiences, I seriously want to ask all of you, why should I support Hinduism if Hinduism wants to me to become an unpaid slave?

Living with your parents is the best way to control your wife and take care of your parents and have more savings. She gets busy with house chores and won't have time for feminist bullshits, while you can have ample amount of freedom to sleep with other women(if you are into that) or maybe do anything else you want, maybe a small side business. You get to have the cake and eat it too. Why on earth will a guy give that up to live separately with his wife? Is it due to a scarcity mindset? If your girlfriend isn't willing to take care of your parents then you can just ditch her and not marry her.

<li>Title: 'Dear, Ram Bhakts(‚ùÅ¬¥‚ó°`‚ùÅ) today I am here to introduce to you the Pancharatna Kriti. These are harsh times and music is the best solution for hurting the soul. Here are the greatest masterpieces of music that are all composed by pure bhakti and spirituality. I urge you all to give this listenüïâ ‚ô™(¬¥‚ñΩÔΩÄ)'<br />Body: ' The ***Pancharatna kritis***  ([Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit): *pancha* "five" + *ratna* "gems") are a set of five [*kritis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti) (songs) in [Carnatic classical music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_classical_music), composed by the 18th-century Indian composer [Tyagaraja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyagaraja). All the *kritis*, as is the case with almost all of Tyagaraja\'s compositions, are penned in [Telugu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language), except the first one, which is composed in [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n \n\n### JagadƒÅnanda kƒÅrakƒÅ\n\nIn this song, Tyagaraja praises [Ramachandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramachandra), one of the incarnations of Lord [Vishnu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu). He eulogizes [Ramachandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramachandra) as one who is the cause of all bliss in the universe. This is the only *Pancharatna Kriti* that was composed in [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit). All the other *kritis* were composed in [Telugu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language), which was used in the court of the Maratha king [Sarabhoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serfoji_II) who ruled this area in the 18th century. Rama was Tyagaraja\'s favorite god.\n\n### Du·∏çukugala nannƒì dora ko·∏çuku br≈çchurƒÅ yent≈ç\n\nIn this second *Pancharatna Kriti* composed in [Telugu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language), Tyagaraja lists all the errors he has committed in his life and asks who but Rama could redeem such a sinner. The sins described include: just wandering around as though being satisfied with a full meal, giving sermons to people who are not interested in listening or who do not have the capability to understand, self-styling oneself as a great person, and mistaking the dross for the real thing. He lists four categories of people to whom he has made the claim of greatness; the ignorant, the riff-raff, the low social folk, and women. In a play on words, he reproaches those who desire wives and progeny.\n\n### SƒÅdhinchane ≈ç manasƒÅ\n\nThis *Pancharatna Kriti* was composed in [Telugu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language) and has been set to Arabhi raga. It is written in a playful tone, rich with metaphor and simile without a surfeit of adjectives - all the while arresting the attention of the singers. In this *kriti*, Tyagaraja sings the greatness of Lord [Krishna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna) in a lucid manner. The style adopted in this *kriti* is very sweet in comparison with the other four.\n\n### Kana kana ruci rƒÅ kanaka vasana ninnu\n\nThis is the least sung or performed of the five *Pancharatna Kritis* composed in [Telugu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language), but it is considered by some to be the most haunting and beautiful. It describes the divine beauty of Sri Rama, whom Tyagaraja worshiped. He says that the more he \\[Tyagaraja\\] looks upon His beautiful features, the more his mind is attracted to Him. This composition is rarely taught and rarely heard in concerts, owing to the raga it is set in, Varali.\n\n### Endar≈ç mahƒÅnubhƒÅvulu\n\n*Endar≈ç mahƒÅnubhƒÅvulu* is believed to be one of the earlier *kritis* Tyagaraja composed in [Telugu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language). The song is a salutation to and praise of all the great saints and musicians down the ages. Tyagaraja clearly delineates and lists the *Mahanubhavalu*, or great ones, in the *kriti* itself, mentioning the saints Narada and Saunaka, among others. In this poem, Tyagaraja describes the greatness of devotees of the Lord. The belief in [Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala) and [Tamil Nadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu) is that Tyagaraja composed the *kriti* spontaneously in his joy upon hearing the divine music of the [Malayali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayali) singer [Shadkala Govinda Marar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadkala_Govinda_Marar). But according to the Walajapet disciples\' version of the origin of the *kriti*, it was composed and learnt by Tyagaraja\'s disciples before the arrival of Marar. This, according to P. T. Narendra Menon, was the legendary, historically significant meeting between two great musicians. Since *Endharo mahanubhavalu* is said to have been composed by Tyagaraja at a young age, it is possible that after hearing Marar sing and in appreciation of the greatness of Marar, Tyagaraja could have asked his disciples to sing the *kriti* on this occasion. Humility is the foundation of all.'<br />Author: 'Euphoric_Dimension62'<br />id: 'lijv5r'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>
<li>Title: 'Novel idea to ban Twitter?'<br />Body: "The mofos at Twitter have STILL not banned the accounts - only 97% banned and the main ones are still spewing hatred and fake news. So here's a novel idea -\n\nUsers acces Twitter through ISPs. What if the government brings in a law to get ISPs to ban access to Twitter? üòÅ\n\nGovernment provides a list of accounts for Twitter to ban. If they're not banned in 12 hours, Governments instructs ISPs to block access to Twitter IMMEDIATELY. Access to Twitter is BLOCKED until Twitter has banned all accounts and Government has verified it.\n\nSo this solves 3 problems -\n1. Twitter is NOT banned but access is BLOCKED - wording make a huge difference if media goes crazy\n2. US government is OK as we can telk them, look we haven't banned Twitter - as soon as they remove the accounts, it goes back online\n3.

<li>Title: 'What Hindus should do now?'<br />Body: "Rinku Sharma's death made me realise we are sitting on a ticking time bomb. Sorry to break the news but if we keep sleeping as we are now, Hinduism will become extinct by fifty years.\n\n1. This is for especially young men. Choose a particular day and visit your nearby temple in group. The mistake Hindus are doing since the beginning is separating religion from politics. No doubt, we offer prayers and visit temples but only on individual level. Though some senior citizen visit temples in group but I've seldom seen young men visiting temple in groups. \n\n2. Be unapologetic about your Hindu identity: People from peaceful religion don't hesitate to go for nimaz during office time, but due to influence of missionary schools, if a Hindu wears kalawa or has tilak it's considered against discipline. Wear kalawa and tilak without any hesitation. Keep a picture of Ram Darbar, Shiv Ji, Ganesh Ji in your cubicle or as screen wallpaper.\n\n3. Adopt two language policy: To make it easy to communicate, learn two languages Hindi from north India and Telugu/Kannada from south India.\n\n4. Make people (both men and women) more masculine and less concerned about things like love, booze, party: Ok, you may downvote me for this, but have you ever thought about the purpose of festivals like Muharram where boys break tubelights with their heads, walk on pieces of glass or burning coal. The purpose is to make them physically and mentally strong and prepared to tolerate pain for their aim. Bollywood is leaving no stone unturned for subliminal messaging that you only need love to fulfil you and the ideal of metrosexual.\n\n5. Don't virtue signal- Two days ago, I came across a comment on the sub that Bajrang dal members are incels that's why they disturb lovey dovey couples during Valentine's day. Dude! It's Bajrang dal members who are sacrificing their lives for our cause. We find flaws in everyone who supports the Hindu cause then wonder why there's no Indic ecosystem. Bhai Taliban rule ayega to public places me lovey dovey karne par seedhe patthar milenge. In the pursuit of absolute freedom, we are giving ourselves for slavery.\n\n6. Don't be dependent on government: Kuchh bhi hota hai to we blame on government but peacefuls have more purusharth than us. They are not dependent on government that's why with even BJP at centre, they have stronger case.
