सीजन का टेम है, लाखों की बिक्री है, ज्वेलर साब अपनी दुकान बंद थोड़े न करेंगे)\n\n6वें दिन ज्वेलर को बुखार आया। उसके घर वालों को भी बुखार आया। घर वालों में बूढ़ी मां भी थी।\nसबकी जांच हुई। जांच में सब पॉजिटिव निकले।\n\nयानि विदेश से आया आदमी खुद पॉजिटिव।\nफिर उसने घर वालों को भी पॉजिटिव कर दिया।\n\nइसके अलावा वह दुकान में 450 लोगों के सम्पर्क में आया। जैसे नौकर चाकर, ग्राहक आदि।\nउनमें से एक ग्राहक राजू था।\n\n\nसब 450 लोगों का चेकअप हो रहा है। अगर उनमें किसी में पॉजिटिव आया तो भी यह सेकंड स्टेज है।\n\nडर यह है कि इन 450 में से हर आदमी न जाने कहाँ कहाँ गया होगा। \n\n\nकुल मिलाकर स्टेज 2 यानी कि जिस आदमी में कोरोना पोजिटिव आया है, वह विदेश नहीं गया था। पर वह एक ऐसे व्यक्ति के सम्पर्क में आया है जो हाल ही में विदेश होकर आया है। \n*******************************\n\n*स्टेज 3*\n\nमनोज को सर्दी खांसी बुखार की वजह से अस्पताल में भर्ती किया, वहां उसका कोरोना पॉजिटिव आया। \nपर मनोज न तो कभी विदेश गया था।\nन ही वह किसी ऐसे व्यक्ति के सम्पर्क में आया है जो हाल ही में विदेश होकर आया है। \n\nयानि हमें अब वह स्रोत नहीं पता कि मनोज को कोरोना आखिर लगा कहाँ से??\n\nस्टेज 1 में आदमी खुद विदेश से आया था।\n\nस्टेज 2 में पता था कि स्रोत सेठजी हैं। हमने सेठजी और उनके सम्पर्क में आये हर आदमी का टेस्ट किया और उनको 14 दिन के लिए अलग थलग कर दिया।\n\n\nस्टेज 3 में आपको स्रोत ही नहीं पता।\n\n स्रोत नहीं पता तो हम स्रोत को पकड़ नहीं सकते। उसको अलग थलग नहीं कर सकते।\nवह स्रोत न जाने कहाँ होगा और अनजाने में ही कितने सारे लोगों को इन्फेक्ट कर देगा।\n\n*स्टेज 3 बनेगी कैसे?*\n\nसेठजी जिन 450 लोगों के सम्पर्क में आये। जैसे ही सेठजी के पॉजिटिव होने की खबर फैली, तो उनके सभी ग्राहक,नौकर नौकरानी, घर के पड़ोसी, दुकान के पड़ोसी, दूध वाला, बर्तन वाली, चाय वाला....सब अस्पताल को दौड़े। \nसब लोग कुल मिलाकर 440 थे।\n10 लोग अभी भी नहीं मिले।\nपुलिस व स्वास्थ्य विभाग की टीम उनको ढूंढ रही है।\nउन 10 में से अगर कोई किसी मंदिर आदि में घुस गया तब तो यह वायरस खूब फैलेगा।\nयही स्टेज 3 है जहां आपको स्रोत नहीं पता।\n\n\n*स्टेज 3 का उपाय*\n14 दिन का lockdown\nकर्फ्यू लगा दो।\nशहर को 14 दिन एकदम तालाबंदी कर दो।\nकिसी को बाहर न निकलने दो।\n\nइस तालाबंदी से क्या होगा??\n\nहर आदमी घर में बंद है।\nजो आदमी किसी संक्रमित व्यक्ति के सम्पर्क में नहीं आया है तो वह सुरक्षित है।\nजो अज्ञात स्रोत है, वह भी अपने घर में बंद है। जब वह बीमार पड़ेगा, तो वह अस्पताल में पहुंचेगा। और हमें पता चल जाएगा कि अज्ञात स्रोत यही है।\n\nहो सकता है कि इस अज्ञात श्रोत ने अपने घर के 4 लोग और संक्रमित कर दिए हैं, पर बाकी का पूरा शहर बच गया।\n\nअगर LOCKDOWN न होता। तो वह स्रोत पकड़ में नहीं आता। और वह ऐसे हजारों लोगों में कोरोना फैला देता। फिर यह हजार अज्ञात लोग लाखों में इसको फैला देते। इसीलिए lockdown से पूरा शहर बच गया और अज्ञात स्रोत पकड़ में आ गया।\n\n*क्या करें कि स्टेज 2, स्टेज 3 में न बदले।*\nEarly lockdown यानी स्टेज 3 आने से पहले ही तालाबन्दी कर दो।\nयह lockdown 14 दिन से कम का होगा।\n\nउदाहरण के लिए\nसेठजी एयरपोर्ट से निकले\nउनने धज्जियां उड़ाईं।\nघर भर को कोरोना दे दिया।\nसुबह उठकर दुकान खोलने गए।\n(गजब आदमी हो यार! सीजन का टेम है, लाखों की बिक्री है, अपनी दुकान बंद कैसें कर लें)\n\nपर चूंकि तालाबंदी है।\nतो पुलिस वाले सेठजी की तरफ डंडा लेकर दौड़े।\nडंडा देख सेठजी शटर लटकाकर भागे।\n\nअब चूंकि मार्किट बन्द है।\nतो 450 ग्राहक भी नहीं आये।\nसभी बच गए।\nराजू भी बच गया।\nबस सेठजी के परिवार को कोरोना हुआ।\n6वें 7वें दिन तक कोरोना के लक्षण आ जाते हैं। विदेश से लौटे लोगों में लक्षण आ जाये तो उनको अस्पताल पहुंचा दिया जायेगा। और नहीं आये तो इसका मतलब वो कोरोना नेगेटिव हैं।'<br />Author: 'Shakuni_'<br />id: 'fnim2b'<br />Flair :WhatsApp Forward</li>

My heart was beating faster, adrenalize was oozing throughout my body. I got literal goosebumps. I called all my friemds and they told that most of them had heard and did the same thing as me. This gave me new inspiration. I started doing Tandav on the corpses of the scared liberandus in my class. One boy didn't participate because he was afraid people would make memes abiut him. So I made a meme about him because he didn't participate. Man libtards neber thought something like this would happen. Theu wefe making fun even one minuite before it started.

<li>Title: 'Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose is still a war criminal.'<br />Body: ' \n\nNetaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s name is still a part of the Indian war criminals’ list in the United Nations, and no Indian government has made any efforts to get his name removed, says the freedom fighter’s great-grand-niece, Rajyashree Chaudhuri. The British had included Netaji’s name in the United Nations’ list of Indian war criminals because he fought against them during World War II. Even Jawaharlal Nehru described Netaji as a “war criminal” while corresponding with British Prime Minister Clement Attlee after Bose’s disappearance in 1945. According to Chaudhuri, India did not ask the UN to remove the name when the world body ratified the war criminals’ list in 1971.\n\nWhen a Bangalore-based RTI activist, Choodamani Nagendra, asked the Central government this year about the efforts if any, it was making to remove Netaji’s name from the list of war criminals, she was told that no information on the matter was available. Choodamani had also asked for a number of UN records relating to Netaji’s war criminal status that was with the government. Has the Indian representative in the UN taken up the matter of removing Netaji’s name from the list, she had asked.\n\nRajyashree Chaudhuri has now written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to get the “war criminal” tag removed, before starting the process of declassification of files on 23 January 2016. She has received an acknowledgment from the Prime Minister’s Office on the matter.\n\n“Does it make any sense to open the secret files of a ‘bad person’ who is a ‘war criminal’?” asked Chaudhury, who has started a signature campaign under the banner of Jatiya Jagran Mancha, asking the Centre to ensure the immediate removal of the tag by the United Nations.\n\nChaudhuri and a group of experts, professionals and social thinkers organized a signature campaign and protest meeting at Hazra More in Kolkata on 14 November on the matter.\n\n \n\n“Though he was declared a ‘war criminal’ by the British, no effort was made by successive Indian governments to get this tag removed. This was done deliberately to ensure that Netaji did not appear before his countrymen. The government should honour him by getting this tag removed before files related to him are declassified,” said Chaudhury.\n\nThe war criminal tag was given by the British for Netaji’s association with the Germans and the Japanese during World War II. Significantly, Jawaharlal Nehru too used this tag to describe Netaji on 26 December 1945, after Netaji disappeared after the so-called plane crash on 18 August 1945.\n\nIn a deposition before the 1970 Khosla Commission to probe Netaji’s disappearance, Shyamalal Jain, the confidential steno of INA Defence Committee, had said, “Jawaharlal Nehru gave four papers from his writing pad to make four copies of a letter, which he would dictate to me on the typewriter, which I also complied… The contents of the letter, as far as I could remember, were as follows.\n\n*“Clement Attlee*\n\n*“Prime Minister of Britain*\n\n*“10, Downing Street, London*\n\n*“Dated: 26 December 1945*\n\n*“Dear Mr. Attlee,*\n\n *“I understand from the most reliable source that Stalin has allowed Subhas Chandra Bose, your war criminal, to enter Russian territory. This is clear treachery and betrayal of faith by the Russians as Russia has been an ally of the British-Americans, which she should not have done. Please take care of it and do what you consider proper and fit.*\n\n*“Yours Sincerely*\n\n*“Jawaharlal Nehru”*\n\nChaudhury feels that the situation has now changed and it should not be difficult for the Indian government to get the tag deleted by the UN. “The government should write to the UN Secretary-General in this regard. Nations have progressed since our Independence and they should not hesitate in supporting our endeavour,” Chaudhury added.\n\nHistorians and experts have reacted sharply to the matter. Defence and security expert Wing Commander (Retired) Praful Bakshi demanded that an independent committee be set up to find out the “status” of Netaji in the eyes of the government. “The committee should find out whether Netaji continued to remain a ‘war criminal’ even after Independence. If yes, it should be found out what crimes he committed for which he was given the tag of ‘war criminal’. The committee should find out his present status,” he said.\n\n \n\nHowever, Prof Kapil Kumar, a noted historian, said that there was no need to remove the tag as it was not given by “our government”. “People like Bhagat Singh or Sukhdeo were ‘terrorists’ for the British government but ‘freedom fighters’ for us. Similarly, Netaji might have been a ‘war criminal’ for the British government, he was a ‘national hero’ for us,” said Kumar, who is also the director of the Indira Gandhi Centre for Freedom Struggle Studies and chairperson of Faculty of History, School of Social Sciences, IGNOU.\n\nFor details see\n\n[70 years on, Netaji still a war criminal in UN records - The Sunday Guardian Live](https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/2313-70-years-netaji-still-war-criminal-un-records)'<br />Author: 'RealMan193'<br />id: 'fmjxmc'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>

<li>Title: 'There was this girl in my tuition'<br />Body: 'There was this girl in my tuition. \n\nVery sweet, heart of gold and a cute innocent voice. \n\nWe kept talking to each other. She laughed at my jokes and I laughed listening to her fun stories. \n\nAlways knew there was something special between me and her but was afraid to confess. \n\nTime passed quickly and soon it was one of the last days of school\n\nI knew time was running out. I really wanted to confess. \n\nOne day, we were both walking together in a secluded area after our classes. This was the perfect opportunity for a confession\n\nNot many people around.\n\nWith my stomach constantly churning, I quickly told her in an awkward fashion, "I love you" \n\nShe looked at me but no words came out of her mouth. I thought I messed up. \n\nThen she said "I don\'t think this is the right time for anything between us. This is the time to study. I won\'t be comfortable"\n\nI was crushed. \n\nThe walk back was quite awkward. None of us spoke to each other. \n\nWhen we reached her house, she suddenly grabbed my hand \n\nShe told me to follow her\n\nI was confused. What was happening? \n\nShe took me to a quite spot behind her house.\n\nI was about to say some thing but she turned around and placed her soft finger on my lips. Gave me a small smile which melted my heart. \n\nOur foreheads touched each other. And our tongues twirled around each other. Her soft lips felt like sweet jelly. The smell of her lipstick invading my nose.\n\nHer hand wrapped around my neck, and my hand around hips. It felt great, it felt as if the whole world was at my command. \n\nShe was the wheels to my car, she was the charger to my phone, she was the pillar to my flyover. \n\nMy hands kept wandering all over her. She didn\'t complain. \n\nBut it all came to an end. Like all good things do. \n\nI was asked, what happened that brought an end? \n\nAfter years of this question being repeated over and over again by my friends, I finally relented and answered. \n\nWhile the intensity was rising up, I just realised. A deep realisation that changed the dynamics between us. Her boner was rising up. ☹️'<br />Author: 'DeadBodiesinMyArse'<br />id: 'flw04s'<br />Flair :OC है बे!</li>

<li>Title: 'My Sort of Bhagwa pill story.'<br />Body: "Someone asked about my personal story on the first smooch story thread and I posted it there. Thought it would work as a Bhagwa pill story more.\n\nSo here it goes.\n\nI somehow fell in love with a Rich Elite State of The Art muslim girl and she loved me too.\n\nI was everything for her. Her family liked me alot. She kept telling things about me and how I know Allah and her religion better than everyone else. I used to take care of her all day when we were together. \n\nWe somehow managed to keep a relationship going for a few months. My life was like a dream back then. Our pain and love could only be expressed through our hugs and kisses.\n\nShe never wanted to be together because she comes from a Rich Elite Conservative Muslim family. This girl was really rich believe me. I was too small infront of her but she never made me felt like an poor guy.\n\nThen college finished, I kept clinging while she started distancing herself. Then we regularly got into fights and every good thing, every fucking thing went to shambles. We were so perfect but because of her stupid religion and her backward family we became like this. \n\nI never thought she would treat me like a begger but she did. Because her religion had taught her to be like this. It was easy for her to justify the hate for me under the burqa of her rwligion.\n\nI accept that I was the one who started the fights but she took everything on another level. She made me delete our convos, our photos and evertything. In the end, she thought that I will destroy her life, I want her family to hate her and stuff and it really broke me into pieces. I never could think stuff like that. \n\nI still love her because I'm not an idiot. I agree things go out of hands when people are possessive and trying to save their own skin. But she couldn't understand this simple thing.\n\nThe whole point of me loving her so much was I found some sort of purity and joy that I lack in myself. I cannot imagine her being with a crazy rich guy who will just use her as a toy. I cannot imagine her marrying one of her cousins. She used to get sick sometimes and it used to make my heart sunk. I never want her to be a burden on someone. But guess I'm a kaafir at the end of the day.\n\nMy family was ready, my friends were ready but she was too much into her religion. \n\nI hope she will get married to a crazy rich guy who isn't her  cousin and will love her very much. One thing is for sure, she will never find a better Musalman than me even though I an not a Muslim and she knows it very well.\n\nI always loved Islam for sufism and puritan aspects of the religion but once we fell apart I started getting angrier day by day and I started hating Islam and every Musalman. As a leftist and Anarchist I felt very guilty so I tried making new Muslim friends and going into Mosques to understand the religion better. All that I could found was hate for others. Some people were actually good but till that point I had made my mind that Islam inherently is bad. And everyone is being brainwashed."<br />Author: 'pranam_bhrata'<br />id: 'flv2yx'<br />Flair :MyBhagwaPillStory</li>

Like I saod in a comment before .My mother didn't understand Hindi  But he literally made her understand every word in his speech. She now respects hin even more than before. This is one thing that really makes a leader shine-his ability to communicate with people. Liberandus have been caught offguard by this. There is no hinf of CAA/NRC now, no mentions of muslims or anything anywhere in the speech  And they also know the people have understood what he said. If they protest now, the whole public will understand that they are hypocrites. So they are supporting him. Also the threat of covid-19 is perhaps too huge and people are realizing that if they carry on their bs then they might be the ones to suffer because of it. I can see Javed Akhtar supporting Modi. He has to give his daily dose of Taquia. He had done this before many times too. But Shehla Rashid suporting Modi is really awkward.

Most likely follow Doctors and other educated people of this field and Gov. They know far better than me at every scale. Mostly these steps don\'t have many risks except the last one and that is why I am sharing.\n\nKeep in mind while fighting the pandemic don\'t be selfish, and think about others and they may have a need for things more than you, so be kind and helpful. \n\nYoung people can fight this better but don\'t be reckless as it can affect anyone. Youth will also be able to help others in this tough period.\n\n**These preparations DO NOT help you avoid or cure Coronavirus, these are just a few steps that may help you (if needed) to get through until Gov. and more educated help can be reached.**\n\n\\-First and foremost, as everyone knows, if you have symptoms start a self-isolation and **inform the Gov. as soon as possible.** Only they (Govt., Doctors and educated people) can help you.\n\n\\-Keep any medicine that you or your loved one have been taking or prescribed for other conditions unrelated to the virus, keep a backup handy, but do not overbuy as others who may need it may meet the shortage, so be considerate.\n\n\\-Keep Paracetamol at home, as Corona causes fever it can help you keep the fever in check. Do not overbuy, please.\n\n\\-Keep nasal drops/Spray at least two (because you can\'t use the same one being used by the person who may have the virus), as Corona effects breathing of the patient, the drops may help in breathing a bit easier. Don\'t overbuy.\n\n\\-Vitamin-D may aid in fighting the virus (Not proven), so if you think/know someone may have Vitamin-D deficiency, please think of buying a Vitamin D3 supplement, it may not help much but every bit helps. Keep in mind to take them with food as they will be absorbed better that way. Again don\'t overbuy.\n\n\\-CAUTION- This is for last resort only- hydroxychloroquine tablets are a Malaria vaccination, but S.Korea have been using them against the Corona, they have shown to be okay at combating the virus (it is just premature, and not a proven study yet), so you may keep it as last resort option. KEEP IN MIND this is just to be taken as last resort in case the patient can\'t somehow get Gov. aid, FIRST STEP should be to inform the Govt. as they will provide the appropriate medicine. The tablet is fairly secure and common but may have some side effects so please read before taking. BEST way if you have to take it, is to ask a nearby doctor for guidance and usage restrictions. **DO NOT take if you have Skin or liver problems, like psoriasis, porphyria or if you have a history of alcohol misuse/refrain.**\n\nIf you have other things please add in the comments below. \n\nHelp everyone and don\'t spread panic, we can and will fight this. Memes are fun and necessary but don\'t joke about this somewhere, where it can start panic or hurt others, don\'t be "it was just a joke" kind of guy in though times.\n\nEven if the country goes in full lockdown it is not a bad thing and help others see the same, stop/counter (nonviolently) those who will spread misinformation. Always double check any news or information yourself before believing and spreading it (including this one), as sometimes we may spread false information unknowingly. Liberal, Sanghi, Right or left every life matters so do not refrain to help anyone who needs it, no matter what you idealogy. \n\nTake care and be safe.'<br />Author: 'BadCogs'<br />id: 'flarvz'<br />Flair :Unverified</li>

<li>Title: 'What is Hindutva? Why Hindutva alone is our form of Indian Nationalism?'<br />Body: 'Hindutva= Hinduness.  While most people some how think that 1st partition of Bharat happened in 1947, 1st partition actually happened in the year 711, when Raja Dahir was defeated by Mohammed Bin Qasim established a mini Islamic state by forcibly converting Hindus. As converted Hindus felt that only one God named Allah should exist and other Gods should not be allowed to exist, And Hindus could no longer access certain parts of Sindh. And hence, this is the 1st partition of Bharat. It is not compulsory for Britishers to draw a artificial line to do partition.\n\nRSS will destroy caste system using Hindutva movement started by Swami Vivekananda.\n\n1st part of Hindutva says “Ekam Sath Vipraha Bahuda Vadanti” which means “truth is one and there are multiple names given to truth and multiple ways to reach the truth” Some people claim atheism is the truth. Some claim agnosticism is the truth. Some claim Allah,Jesus,Vishnu are the truth.However all people following different paths belong to one large family called Vasudaiva Kutumbakam. So, you can be an atheist but call yourself as Hindu. You can pray to Allah,Jesus and Vishnu but still call yourself as a Hindu.\n\n2nd part of Hindutva says, Hindu should be the only caste everyone everyone should have. All castes of Brahmin,Kshatriya,Vaishya,Shudra and Dalit have to destroyed and replaced with one caste called Hindu. This 2nd part was given by Veer Savarkar.\n\n3rd part of Hindutva says, there should be political unity and military unity of Hindus and that all Hindus should get organised and have political meetings every week similar to how Muslims have political meetings every Friday Afternoon. This was given by Swami Vivekananda. This is the main goal of RSS which is Hindu Sangathan. When entire Hindu Samaj comes under RSS, RSS will cease to exist.\n\n\nAll Hindus naturally follow 1st part of Hindutva  but not 2nd and 3rd part of Hindutva. RSS has all religious groups working for it. Abdul Kalam used to visit RSS headquarters in Nagpur. Please join it and preach Hindutva to everyone you see offline.'<br />Author: 'phanisai97'<br />id: 'fl93on'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>
<li>Title: 'Do you support or oppose sedition law? Why so?'<br />Body: 'I oppose sedition law because it is used to control the movement of our lips and is full of ambiguity and legal loopholes. Freedom with restriction is not freedom. Sedition was used to shut down criticism of the British, then Nehru misused it against Romilesh Thapar, then Congress misused it against 9000 people etc. \n\nMany people get confused, thinking that removal of Sedition will legalize violence. It won’t. Rioting and destroying public property (eg renaming that street in JNU to Jinnah Marg) is already illegal and is covered under violence. \n\nDon’t forget that all forms of criticism of any Government is a key part of democracy. A lot of people say that Sedition is used to prevent “anti-Nationalism”, but forget that control of Nationalism was the reason this law was introduced. Baggage Singh, Vinayak Sarvarkar etc were all arrested thanks to this law. \n\nI find it funny that any political party that opposes sedition law become the first ones to use it when they come to power. \n\nWhat do you guys think?'<br />Author: '0x4f0x770x610x690x73'<br />id: 'fl7jjg'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li>

We know about violent history of proselytizing nature of Islam, we know that these Muzzies can go to any extent to adhere by the Philosophy of Islam. If you question them and their ideology they will bomb you, rape you, torture you in the most violent way.\nThis is the reason why most of standup comedians, actors, intellectuals who questions the Sanatan Ideology and Indic way of life shits their pants if they unintentionally questions the Islamic faith.\nIt is like that funny kid of the class who makes fun of everyone but class bully because he knows quite well what will be the consequences.\nSo it is the intensional hypocrisy of Leftists and Liberals because they want to show themselves as modern and open minded by making fun of religion but as they have fear of Islam in their subconscious minds they refrain themselves from making fun of it. \nWhat you guys think about it.'<br />Author: 'PeshwaBajiraoBallal'<br />id: 'fl5g2k'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li>

<li>Title: "In an article about India's great response to COVID, New York Times ensures they mention cow urine"<br />Body: "Article here. Full text below\n\n&gt;NEW DELHI — Over the weekend in Lucknow, one of India’s bigger cities, young people packed into pubs. Despite the Indian government scrambling to lock things down, few on the bar scene were taking the coronavirus very seriously.\n\n&gt;“I am not scared. I eat, party, sleep,’’ said Akshay Gupta, an accountant who was bar hopping on Saturday night. “The scare is overhyped.”\n\n&gt;India has reported around 125 cases of the coronavirus, and it is a bit of a mystery how the world’s second-most-populous nation, with 1.3 billion people, has remained relatively unscathed while the number of cases explodes to its east and west. That has spawned a sense of almost disbelief about the crisis in some quarters.\n\n&gt;Doctors say it is either that there are many more cases in India than have been detected, because of the difficulties of getting tested, or that India has indeed managed to so far escape the worst, possibly because of quick and strict efforts right from the start.\n\n&gt;In Kerala, in the south, the authorities used GPS technology, CCTV footage and mobile phone records to trace the movements of one Indian family believed to be among the first infected here. They returned from Italy in late February, and within days, medical teams fanned out to all the places they had visited including banks, restaurants and churches and quickly quarantined just about everyone they had come in contact with — nearly 1,000 people.\n\n&gt;India was also one of the first nations to essentially shut its borders, canceling visas and denying entry to all but a select few foreigners. Some states, such as Kerala, are beginning to beef up internal borders, taking the temperature of passengers in cars and screening people on trains.\n\n&gt;So far most if not all of India’s coronavirus cases have come from travelers — an Italian tour group visiting Rajasthan single-handedly spread many of the cases. But public health experts fear what will happen if community transmission begins to take off, especially in packed urban areas with poor sanitation and where so many people live face to face.\n\n&gt;“The challenge of a large country like India with overcrowding is that some people will always slip the net, wherever you put it,’’ said Dipanjan Roy, an Indian epidemiologist who has worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization.\n\n&gt;He also worried about what he called the “let’s wait till tomorrow” attitude. Indian health officials should have put harsher quarantines into effect in February, he said.\n\n&gt;“That month cost them,’’ Dr. Roy said.\n\n&gt;But he and other doctors said India offered certain advantages, including a decent track record containing flu epidemics and the fact that India is the one of the world’s largest producers of generic drugs.\n\n&gt;Antibiotics are often dispensed here without prescriptions, worrying some medical professionals. But in a situation like this, experts said it might help: Many of the people dying from the coronavirus succumb to secondary infections, and some of those can be treated with antibiotics.\n\n&gt;Demographics also work to India’s advantage. The population here is considerably younger than in the countries worst hit, and younger people have a much better chance of weathering the virus. Another possible factor is that India’s weather is warmer — and it is about to get really hot — though that has not been clinically proved to have a major effect.\n\n&gt;State authorities across India are now ordering the same kind of restrictions as in the worst-hit nations. Schools are shutting. So are swimming pools, gyms, athletic arenas, malls and movie theaters. Weddings and other public gatherings are being banned — though people continue to do them.\n\n&gt;In many places it’s life as usual. In New Delhi, the capital, and other large cities like Lucknow, restaurants might be a little more deserted, but many people are still going out. There are still traffic jams, though on Monday traffic was noticeably lighter in Mumbai and commuter trains were largely empty. Online shopping services like Amazon and the digital grocer BigBasket saw a surge in orders as shoppers rushed to stock up on food and supplies without leaving their homes.\n\n&gt;Dr. Henk Bekedam, the World Health Organization’s representative in India, said coronavirus cases in the country were all “traceable” and that there was no evidence yet of community transmission or a higher unofficial patient count.\n\n&gt;He said India had so far managed to keep cases low by responding fast and aggressively to the coronavirus, and urging people to practice social distancing.\n\n&gt;“I have been quite impressed with India,” Dr. Bekedam said. “From the onset they’ve been taking it very seriously.\n\n&gt;The government has tried to get ahead of the rumors — the line from India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, is “Say No to Panic, Say Yes to Precautions.” But some of Mr. Modi’s supporters and even officials in his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., are confusing people.\n\n&gt;**Over the weekend, a well-known Hindu nationalist group held a cow urine drinking party, saying that the urine had medicinal properties and drinking it could ward off the coronavirus. A lawmaker in Mr. Modi’s party has uttered similar things, leaving many people wondering if it could be true. Other party leaders continue to hold large rallies, with people flocking in.**\n\n&gt;Across India, poultry markets are taking a huge hit. Many Indians believe you can catch the coronavirus from eating chicken. Wholesale chicken prices have crashed by over 50 percent as misinformation has circulated on social media that eating chicken or other meat can spread the coronavirus. Various government agencies have issued statements to assure people there is no link between the coronavirus and chicken, but it hasn’t helped.\n\n&gt;Testing has also been a problem. Until last week, it was difficult to get tested in India for the coronavirus unless a patient showed symptoms and had traveled abroad or was close to someone who had. While South Korea has tested more than 4,800 people per million and Italy more than 1,000, India has tested around 5 per million.\n\n&gt;But government scientists insist that India has scaled up its testing kits from 20,000 in January to now approximately one million, and that the tests are more widely available and can be processed in a few days at a network of more than 50 national labs.\n\n&gt;Still, one doctor in Kerala lost her job this month after trying to get a patient tested.\n\n&gt;After Dr. Shinu Syamalan, a general medicine practitioner, referred a patient who had a fever and had returned from the Middle East to the government health department, the owner of the private clinic where Dr. Syamalan worked fired her.\n\n&gt;“The owner said people would stop coming to my clinic if they knew a coronavirus patient was here. He was very harsh to me,” Dr. Syamalan said.\n\n&gt;The state health department refused to take the case seriously, she said, and the patient walked away untested.\n\n\n&gt;Shalini Venugopal contributed reporting from New Delhi and Vindu Goel from Mumbai.\n\n&gt;Updated March 16, 2020\n\n\n\nIt could've been a pretty normal article about the challenges India faces, what it has done so far, what remains to be done, and the comment by the WHO resident. But no! We can't have that! We must throw in something negative! We must take a bunch of lunatics that 90% of the country does not take seriously, and make a headline out of their loony doings! We must, otherwise we'll have an article that shows India in a positive light, and we can't have that!\n\n\nFuck the Western media."<br />Author: 'nogs897'<br />id: 'fk20fq'<br />Flair :Bakchod News</li>

The work gets done. Productivity is higher. You are available online. All of that. And so you get paid for your labour. \n\nAnd just as you do get paid, think of those who may not be able to deliver their usual work because their jobs are different. If you employee people in unskilled jobs, would you offer them the same courtesy that you expect from your employers?\n\nI know the answer is not easy. But these are not easy times either.\n\nIt may take a month, it may take more for the coronovirus crisis to get over. The people most affected would be the ones who are in unorganised sector jobs. All of a sudden you will not need a driver because you are grounded home. The maid will not show up for work because her children are at home and her husband does not have his daily work. The person who works in a roadside eatery has nobody to serve and thus is not needed. Labourers are likely get laid off for no fault of theirs.\n\nDuring a period like this, it is the weakest who suffer the most. If they don't get their daily wage, they won't have enough savings or find money or the credit to put bread on the table. And God forbid if they do catch the virus, they will not have the same level of care and comfort that you and I are so fortunate to have. \n\nYes we will survive this. Emotionally, financially, socially. Question is will they?\n\nThe best of humanity shines through during worst of the times. It is at this time we must all think of those who are dependent on our incomes for their daily livelihood. If you continue to get paid, please pay them too. Whether they are able to work or not. It isn't about whether this is fair, it is about what is the right thing to do in times like these.\n\nThis crisis was not of their making. Do not punish them if they aren't able to do what they need to do during this challenging time. They will only be grateful.\n\nToday is the time for us all to commit to stand up for each other and give everyone the confidence that you will be there for them during this tough time. Just as they are for you. Every single day.\n\nGod bless!\n\nPS: I would love if you are able to share this.

<li>Title: 'How do you think children of Bollywood/Hollywood actors or actresses react when they see the intimate photos or scenes of their parents?'<br />Body: "Some people were discussing in a whatsapp group how Kareena is arrogant and rude all the time. Someone was yelling that we should boycott her movies or behave in the same way as her to teach her a lession. But then someone suggested not to do anything as she will get her Karma when Taimur will see Dabaang 2, Heroine or Kurbaan. \n\nNow this got me thinking. I have read in an old interview that Ranbhir Kapoor used to hate his mother if she ever did romance with another man in a movie. I am pretty sure it holds true for most human beings in general. Sanjay Dutt was also bullied because of his mother's affair with Raj Kapoor. What really goes through a child's mi d when they are surrounded by beautiful or intimate pictures of their parents with other people all the time. Is that the reason why most pornstars opt not to have a baby or live in extremely troubled lives? If Sunny Leone's child ever searched her mother on pornhub (or even on wikipedia) then how would he react with what he would see? Now the actresees of the past generation didn't do such intimate scenes. Juhi Chawla, Kajol, Madhuri or even Aiswarya's children will never have to face all these I guess. But what would the children of Bipasha Basu, Kareena Kapooe or even Zeenat Aman (I know she doesn't have a child) ever think of their mothers when they see these things? Is it the reason why they end up so different than normal people or just too much detached from the world in general. Now you might love or hate the Tatas or Ambanis but they are also rich but they hardly make any stupid statement in public. Even their children don't do that. So money is perhaps not the only thing that makes these people so detached from the world. Is this the reason why they are so craxy?"<br />Author: 'Styeyr'<br />id: 'fjg8fd'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li>

That was a period of a great change there. \n\nTwatter had been, till then, dominated by librandu chuttads. Most of the right wingers at that time were raitas. But one guy decided this wasn’t good enough. The narrative had to change. \n\nThat guy was pegun cat. You might have read his answers on quora. If not, please do. He will blow your mind. \n\nPegun, as we fondly called him, was much smarter than everyone else there. While there were, and still are better read people than him, Pegun had a gift. You see, while others read history, Pegun perceived things differently. It was as if he could actually talk with historical figures, glean their experiences, he could draw insights from random texts that seemed so obvious, but only once they had been disclosed. \n\nPegun was sick of librandu chuttads setting the narrative, and he scoffed at raitas who could only whimper in response. Hindus needed to take control of the wheel, he decided. We had to be the ones writing our history. \n\nBut how?\n\nSimple answer, dear Bhratas, is expanding the overton window, in our favour. \n\nCan we replicate it here?\n\nYes. By doing one small thing, we can.

No matter how ‘extreme’ his opinion, do not censure him in public, in front of &lt;redacted&gt; or librandus. Defend him, let him set the narrative. \n\nYou will hear the same shrieking howls from leftie chutiyas, “fascist”, “n*zi” but don’t back down. Don’t go around talking how we aren’t what they accuse us of. Embrace their slurs. \n\nThis happened on twatter when all looked lost, and we  won against overwhelming odds.

This is exactly the grounds on basis of which it was banned.\n\nBtw mass reporting by cyber bots could be the reason too. A recent video of balakot air strike by ark films which was really very high good quality triggered Pakistanis. They mass reported it and it was taken down. They posted it again though but it happened."<br />Author: 'PuppyPushups'<br />id: 'fitlox'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li>
