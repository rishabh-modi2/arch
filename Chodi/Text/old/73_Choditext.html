<li>Title: 'I wrote an article regarding the phrase that many people use, day to day which is,"It is your opinion man!", the problems with the phrase are shown in the article below'<br />Body: '# Ridiculing The Phrase: It is your opinion\n\nIn my opinion, this phrase is very much related to the words which belong to the phrase itself, the most important of which is “opinion”, an opinion is pretty much your thinking on a topic or subject.\n\nBut where do we draw the line between opinions and tyrannical thought?\n\nHere, the line is drawn on the opinion you have itself and its relation to the fact, which has been researched upon and proven. The farther away it is from the fact the more it reaches a conspiracy or in some places tyrannical thought on a subject.\n\nSo, saying the phrase “It is your opinion, man”, may be right in some places, the key word some needs to be pressurized, mainly because this phrase is, as far as I have seen, used for the thought related to conspiracy and less well-thought out opinion, which takes facts into consideration.  \n\nSo, the end message in this article is that, just think out when this phrase is used, because you may just use this on someone who’s opinion differs wildly at times even hurting the facts’ integrity itself.'<br />Author: 'Generocide'<br />id: 'hcp82o'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>
<li>Title: 'What happened at China border'<br />Body: 'There is only 2 possibilities - China either took our land, or they didn\'t.\n\nWhichever happened, Modi has 2 choices - Tell the truth, or lie.\n\nWhatever Modi says, you have 2 choices - believe him, or disbelieve.\n\nWhatever you decide, there are 2 outcomes - you either vote for him, or not.\n\nDo permutation, combination, flowchart of these options to keep yourself busy.\n\nYou and I have zero visibility into what\'s going on there. There is no border fence. Chinese and Indian troops cross into each other\'s territory all the time, even right now incursions are going on throughout the 3000km long porous border. Then they both go back to patrolling other areas.\n\nMaybe they did enter our land, Maybe they were beat back after.\nMaybe Modi has read ArthaShastra which ordains how to deal with a weak enemy (Pakistan) and how to deal with a strong enemy (China), how to project strength during weakness, and weakness during strength.\n\nWould you be happy if he said *\'they did enter/grab land\'* ?  \nWhat will the next set of questions be ?  \nHe has to then manage public opinion which might end up curtailing or forcing the Army into doing something they didn\'t plan for.  \nModi is not obliged to reveal full information to everyone everytime.  \nYou think PoohPing does it ?  \n*"But China is dictatorship and we\'re not REEE"* - Go back to point 4 above - either vote for him, or don\'t.\n\nWe armchairs can do only one thing useful right now. **Keep quiet**.  \nSo those that are actually thinking are not distracted. Same dramabaazi happened with Balakot strike, did we cross LAC, did JeM die or only some trees, did Abhi shoot down F-16..\n\nHave you dealt with a IT production issue during an outage ?  \nThe best help that those who can\'t affect the outcome can do, is stay silent.'<br />Author: 'waeva2'<br />id: 'hcp1o3'<br />Flair :CKMKB</li>

Or on yahoo (or askjeeves, or galaxy.einet.net, or dogpile, or altavista or even astalavista) being the one true search engine.\n\nthese things are temporary and tend to wither away and get replaced by something new.  no matter how you feel about this, the way WANG computers disappeared, the same way IBM computers are also going to disappear.  The way that Digital Research DOS or Control Program/Microprocessors, disappeared, the same way Microsoft is also going to disappear.  Apple, Google.  They are all going to vanish without a trace.  Islam, Christianity, Buddhism... they are all going to end.\n\nWhat makes something perennial?  Something that is fed from the never ending source. Glaciers, Ice, TRUTH.  Anything that is the words of men, delivered to them by angels, sent by god.... is going to get corrupted, is temporary.

<li>Title: "MUST READ: An Excerpt from today's ToI editorial on India-China relations"<br />Body: 'Next time a decision is being considered in the economic or political sphere that may displease Beijing, many voices around Modi will advise caution. No one wants to be in the position of dealing with a new incursion of Chinese troops across the border. These same voices will likely push for a more active posture in all four sectors of the border. This gets things exactly wrong. If it wants to avoid falling into the strategic trap that has been laid for it, India needs to de-escalate tensions at the border while increasing activity where the real game is being played: in the Indian Ocean, in the race to develop the key technologies of the future, and in the battle to control critical infrastructure.\n\n\nThe first and most important lesson in the “new great game” is not to be distracted from the main prize. The second lesson is to preserve your margin of action.\n\n\nThose who consulted the Chinese press over the last week must have noticed an interesting fact: The recent battle between Indian and Chinese troops in Ladakh was nowhere to be seen. The possibility of war was not created and managed for domestic consumption. It was created for the Indian mind, a strategy of war psychology.\n\n\nBy Bruno Macaes, The writer, a former Secretary of State for European Affairs in Portugal, is the author of Belt and Road: A Chinese World Order'<br />Author: 'rangilarasool'<br />id: 'hch08v'<br />Flair :HQ Text Bakchodi</li>

It describes the part of Mahabharata when Shri Krishna went to Hastinapur as the Shantidoot (messenger) of the Pandavas &amp; requested Duryodhan to accept peace in exchange of giving the Pandavas nothing more than 5 villages. But Duryodhan instead tried to capture Shri Krishna. Shri Krishna then revealed his vishwaroop in Dhritarashtra\'s Court.\n\nRamdhari Singh Dinkar writes-\n\n\u200b\n\nवर्षों तक वन में घूम-घूम,\nबाधा-विघ्नों को चूम-चूम,\nसह धूप-घाम, पानी-पत्थर,\nपांडव आये कुछ और निखर।\nसौभाग्य न सब दिन सोता है,\nदेखें, आगे क्या होता है। \n\nमैत्री की राह बताने को,\nसबको सुमार्ग पर लाने को,\nदुर्योधन को समझाने को,\nभीषण विध्वंस बचाने को,\nभगवान् हस्तिनापुर आये,\nपांडव का संदेशा लाये। \n\n‘दो न्याय अगर तो आधा दो,\nपर, इसमें भी यदि बाधा हो,\nतो दे दो केवल पाँच ग्राम,\nरक्खो अपनी धरती तमाम।\nहम वहीं खुशी से खायेंगे,\nपरिजन पर असि न उठायेंगे! \n\nदुर्योधन वह भी दे ना सका,\nआशीष समाज की ले न सका,\nउलटे, हरि को बाँधने चला,\nजो था असाध्य, साधने चला।\nजब नाश मनुज पर छाता है,\nपहले विवेक मर जाता है। \n\nहरि ने भीषण हुंकार किया,\nअपना स्वरूप-विस्तार किया,\nडगमग-डगमग दिग्गज डोले,\nभगवान् कुपित होकर बोले-\n‘जंजीर बढ़ा कर साध मुझे,\nहाँ, हाँ दुर्योधन! बाँध मुझे। \n\nयह देख, गगन मुझमें लय है,\nयह देख, पवन मुझमें लय है,\nमुझमें विलीन झंकार सकल,\nमुझमें लय है संसार सकल।\nअमरत्व फूलता है मुझमें,\nसंहार झूलता है मुझमें। \n\n‘उदयाचल मेरा दीप्त भाल,\nभूमंडल वक्षस्थल विशाल,\nभुज परिधि-बन्ध को घेरे हैं,\nमैनाक-मेरु पग मेरे हैं।\nदिपते जो ग्रह नक्षत्र निकर,\nसब हैं मेरे मुख के अन्दर। \n\n‘दृग हों तो दृश्य अकाण्ड देख,\nमुझमें सारा ब्रह्माण्ड देख,\nचर-अचर जीव, जग, क्षर-अक्षर,\nनश्वर मनुष्य सुरजाति अमर।\nशत कोटि सूर्य, शत कोटि चन्द्र,\nशत कोटि सरित, सर, सिन्धु मन्द्र। \n\n‘शत कोटि विष्णु, ब्रह्मा, महेश,\nशत कोटि जिष्णु, जलपति, धनेश,\nशत कोटि रुद्र, शत कोटि काल,\nशत कोटि दण्डधर लोकपाल।\nजञ्जीर बढ़ाकर साध इन्हें,\nहाँ-हाँ दुर्योधन! बाँध इन्हें। \n\n‘भूलोक, अतल, पाताल देख,\nगत और अनागत काल देख,\nयह देख जगत का आदि-सृजन,\nयह देख, महाभारत का रण,\nमृतकों से पटी हुई भू है,\nपहचान, इसमें कहाँ तू है। \n\n‘अम्बर में कुन्तल-जाल देख,\nपद के नीचे पाताल देख,\nमुट्ठी में तीनों काल देख,\nमेरा स्वरूप विकराल देख।\nसब जन्म मुझी से पाते हैं,\nफिर लौट मुझी में आते हैं। \n\n‘जिह्वा से कढ़ती ज्वाल सघन,\nसाँसों में पाता जन्म पवन,\nपड़ जाती मेरी दृष्टि जिधर,\nहँसने लगती है सृष्टि उधर!\nमैं जभी मूँदता हूँ लोचन,\nछा जाता चारों ओर मरण। \n\n‘बाँधने मुझे तो आया है,\nजंजीर बड़ी क्या लाया है?\nयदि मुझे बाँधना चाहे मन,\nपहले तो बाँध अनन्त गगन।\nसूने को साध न सकता है,\nवह मुझे बाँध कब सकता है? \n\n‘हित-वचन नहीं तूने माना,\nमैत्री का मूल्य न पहचाना,\nतो ले, मैं भी अब जाता हूँ,\nअन्तिम संकल्प सुनाता हूँ।\nयाचना नहीं, अब रण होगा,\nजीवन-जय या कि मरण होगा। \n\n‘टकरायेंगे नक्षत्र-निकर,\nबरसेगी भू पर वह्नि प्रखर,\nफण शेषनाग का डोलेगा,\nविकराल काल मुँह खोलेगा।\nदुर्योधन! रण ऐसा होगा।\nफिर कभी नहीं जैसा होगा। \n\n‘भाई पर भाई टूटेंगे,\nविष-बाण बूँद-से छूटेंगे,\nवायस-श्रृगाल सुख लूटेंगे,\nसौभाग्य मनुज के फूटेंगे।\nआखिर तू भूशायी होगा,\nहिंसा का पर, दायी होगा।’ \n\nथी सभा सन्न, सब लोग डरे,\nचुप थे या थे बेहोश पड़े।\nकेवल दो नर ना अघाते थे,\nधृतराष्ट्र-विदुर सुख पाते थे।\nकर जोड़ खड़े प्रमुदित,\nनिर्भय, दोनों पुकारते थे ‘जय-जय’! \n\n[Vishwaroop](https://images.app.goo.gl/GuxBXEZwuo5c85vt9)'<br />Author: 'Loweowe'<br />id: 'hc0adl'<br />Flair :Hindi Poetry</li>

What Aurangazeb could not do, the secular supreme court achieved. \n\nThe state govt showed reluctance since the start but allowed the pre-yatra rituals to contiue, including construction of the chariots, which started 12 days late but ended 4 days early.\n\nNow, with Rath Yatra mere 4 days away, the SC bans it.'<br />Author: 'Catappa_mama'<br />id: 'hbtfs2'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: 'Guys and Girls, Please Stop Using RIP for the dead ones.'<br />Body: 'WHY RIP IS NOT THE CORRECT FORM OF CONDOLENCE TO A HINDU FAMILY\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nR.I.P means Rest in Peace-\n\nIn Christianity, this short epitaph signifies wishing rest and peace to someone who has died. Christians bury the dead ones and the soul rests in peace in that grave until the judgment day arrives. On the Judgment day, the Lord will decide who goes where- Heaven or Hell. They believe that on the Judgment day the dead will rise again. Until that time, the soul has to remain inside that coffin. Hence the blessing Rest In Peace (until the judgement day)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, Hinduism does not have any concept such as that of rising of dead ones. Hinduism believes in reincarnation. It says that the cycle of birth and death are governed by the Karma of individuals. The deceased individual would take another birth based upon the Karma of this life. So there is no rest and hence, the concept of RIP is not valid in Hinduism. Hinduism believes in Moksha that is liberation- Liberation from the endless cycles of birth and death. That’s why instead of using RIP we should say, “Om Shanti” or “Aatma Ko Sadgati Prapt Ho (May Soul attain Moksha)” or simply "Om Sadgati". Sadgati means salvation or liberation. We always pray that may the soul get liberated from the cycle of life and death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn fact, the concept of RIP would remotely come close to the concept of Preta (Evil, hungry ghosts) which is basically a curse in the Hindu way of life. An individual after leaving his/her body becomes Preta. When we say RIP , we are praying for the soul to remain locked into a standstill on Earth as it becomes Preta for eternity. That’s why in Hindu way of life there is a concept of Terahvin (13 days). For 13 days family members of deceased persuade the Pretas every day with various invocations and offerings requesting them to leave this earth and move on to their next destination which could be either incarnation or salvation (moksha). By saying Om Sadgati we prompt the soul to move on and not remain in \'peace\' here..'<br />Author: 'Dhruv_Colossus'<br />id: 'ha8yid'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>

<li>Title: 'You need to read this!'<br />Body: "It's great to be proud of our country and its culture but from what I have seen on this sub, most people really underestimate China. Let's get real, our large percentage of population is still facing poverty, we're really lagging behind in every aspect, our education system is fucked, corruption is still common, people still throw garbage on streets, yes we're growing but our growth is no where near to be dominant power in Asia.\nThat's the current state our country. Just accept it \n\nChina on the other hand, has most risen from poverty and corruption despite the population still large than of India, CCP has mostly solved basic problems and is  now going in direction of being a superpower.\n China was always the wealthiest country throughout ancient, medival, and early modern period, it wasn't India it was China. You're not immune to any type of propaganda.\nMoving on current situation, it's the China who is actually winning, it has even started building it's new silk road, it will stretch from Asia to Europe and Africa and its centre will be China. They're really on their way to gain their old throne and unlike America china already has gained powerful ways to silent any voice against it. \nTheir government and companies invest in every single country and especially in Africa, they control the media!! Look at how YouTube, reddit, tiktok shadow people and if it continues like that every voice against it will immediately will be shut. \nThis is how far they've coming into in just 20 years. \nThey're even building ports in Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Look how our old friend Nepal is now no more different than Pakistan. At this point do we have any allies left? \nChina will control Indian Ocean, central Asia, sub saharan Africa and south China sea if it keeps continuing, they will get every influential region it the world. We only had Indian Ocean to be dominant in as our paths to central and east Asia were blocked by China. It shame how some Indians seem so confident with indo China issue.

Also they don't want me to eat outside as I was doing before cause no cooking skills. \n\nNow the problem is I don't know how many more months this pandemic is going to last and how long my office is going to be work from home.\n\nSo what should I do?\n\n1. Move my stuff back to my parents house and work from here. Though if this pandemic ends early or my office opens, I have to find another flat or travel :(\n2. Move back there and cook for myself. My parents will definitely be worried about me catching the virus. Also no cooking skills, will have to learn from scratch.\n3. Keep paying the rent and stay in my parents house till this pandemic ends. Most of my family is suggesting this and frankly I don't want to waste money for the flat I am not using.\n\nPS: I kind of want to move back there as I miss my solitude but I worry for my parent's worries about me."<br />Author: 'Frosty_War'<br />id: 'h8xyss'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li>
