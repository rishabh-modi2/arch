His bio from wikipedia.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;Jaffrelot works at the Centre for Studies in International Relations (CERI)-Sciences Po and has served as its Director from 2000 to 2008.\\[3\\] He is currently a senior research fellow at CNRS and a professor at Sciences Po. He is also a visiting professor at the India Institute, King\'s College London, and has taught at Columbia University, Yale University, Johns Hopkins University, the Universit√© de Montr√©al, and as a Global Scholar at Princeton University.\\[2\\] Since 2008, he has been a non-resident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;Jaffrelot was awarded the CNRS Bronze Medal in 1993, has served as editor or editor-in-chief of several scholarly journals on politics and sociology, and is a Permanent Consultant at the Direction de la Prospective of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\\[4\\] He also chairs the Scientific council of the six research centers of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and CNRS in Asia since 2007. Jaffrelot is the president of the Political Science section of the French National Committee for Scientific Research (CoNRS) since 2012.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPretty influential man, pretty big roles. But \\*\\*his most interesting role for me is his being fellow at Carnegie Endowment. Same Carnegie Endowment which has been listed by the most authorattive book on Cold War as one of the big CIA fronts (evidenced by constant exchange of positions by officials between the 2 organisations)\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Globally acclaimed book on ColdWar "Cultural Cold War" elucidates how from the era of 1930s, how US came to be a nation whose policies, particularly foreign policies, were determined by the plutocrats, for the plutocrats. And the means of determination would come to be the plutocratic &amp; corporate funds featuring swivelling doors with CIA with CIA donating its officials for these megafunds and the megafunds donating money and a respectable, non-hostile channel for achieving CIA\'s foreign policy objectives.\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;\\*\\*In the early 20th century, the United States legalized endowed foundations. They were the new lifeguards of Imperialism, or call it Capitalism, under threat from Communism. Among the first to be set up was Carnegie Corporation, endowed in 1911 by profits from Carnegie Steel Company. The Rockefeller Foundation was endowed in 1914 by JD Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil Company.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;\\*\\*The use of philanthropic foundations was the most convenient way to pass large sums of money to Agency projects without alerting the recipients to their source. By the mid 1950s, the CIA‚Äôs intrusion into the foundation field was massive. Although figures are not available for this period, the general counsel of a 1952 Congress committee appointed to investigate US foundations concluded that ‚ÄòAn unparalleled amount of power is concentrated increasingly in the hands of an interlocking and self-perpetuating group. Unlike the power of corporate management, it is unchecked by stockholders; unlike the power of government, it is unchecked by the people; unlike the power of the churches, it is unchecked by any firmly established canons of value.‚Äô\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;\\*\\*In 1976, a Select Committee appointed to investigate US intelligence activities reported on the CIA‚Äôs penetration of the foundation field by the mid-1960s: during 1963-6, of the 700 grants over $10,000 given by 164 foundations, at least 108 involved partial or complete CIA funding. More importantly, CIA funding was involved in nearly half the grants made by these 164 foundations in the field of international activities during the same period.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;\\*\\*‚ÄòBona fide‚Äô foundations such as Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie were considered ‚Äòthe best and most plausible kind of funding cover‚Äô. A CIA study of 1966 argued that this technique was ‚Äòparticularly effective for democratically run membership organizations, which need to assure their own unwitting members and collaborators, as well as their hostile critics, that they have genuine, respectable, private sources of income‚Äô. Certainly, it allowed the CIA to fund ‚Äòa seemingly limitless range of covert action programs affecting youth groups, labor unions, universities, publishing houses, and other private institutions‚Äô from the early 1950s.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;‚ÄòThere was a cover branch at CIA whose job it was to help provide cover, like the foundations we used for our operations,‚Äô Braden explained. ‚ÄòI paid no attention to the details. The Finance Department would handle it, and talk to the cover officer. It was just a mechanism which you used. The Farfield Foundation was one of them. I don‚Äôt know the names of all of them, I can‚Äôt remember. But it was a criss-cross of money. There was never any danger of the CIA running out of money.‚Äô\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore can be read here:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/op8nmj/antimodi\\_article\\_in\\_mit\\_fechnology\\_review\\_by/](https://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/op8nmj/antimodi_article_in_mit_fechnology_review_by/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*What more, the tradition of Carnegie supplying CIA directors continues to this day!\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (CEIP) is a nonpartisan (lol) international affairs think tank with centers in Washington D.C., Moscow, Beirut, Beijing, Brussels, and New Delhi.\\[1\\] Founded in 1910 by Andrew Carnegie, the organization describes itself as being dedicated to advancing cooperation between nations and promoting active international engagement by the United States.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;In the University of Pennsylvania\'s "2019 Global Go To Think Tanks Report", Carnegie was ranked the #1 top think tank in the world.\\[3\\] In the 2015 Global Go To Think Tanks Report, Carnegie was ranked the third most influential think tank in the world, after the Brookings Institution and Chatham House.\\[4\\] It was ranked as the top Independent Think Tank in 2018.\\[5\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;#\\*The chairperson of Carnegie\'s board of trustees is former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker,\\[6\\] and the organization\'s interim president is president is Thomas Carothers,\\[7\\] who replaced former Endowment president and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns\\[8\\] after Burns\' nomination\\[9\\] and confirmation as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\\[10\\]\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChistophe Jaffrelot has also just published a book on Hindu nationalism, so his attack on Hinduism &amp; nationalism- the 2 glues binding India is not fleeting, it is persistent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Somebody working at CIA front promoting demonisation of Hindus isnt unexpected, given Truschke herself is being funded by cold war linked federal agencies to write book on Indian history.\\*\\* And so many universities suddenly uniting in demonisation of a people who would be considered as having native rights, minorities in global politics &amp; more importantly who are facing &amp; have faced genocides having right to protect themselves in "woke" climate. Then again is it even sane to expect justice and fairness from countries whose power institutions feed off neocolonialism?
