I am going through some existential/midlife crisis now and want to get rid of distractions so that I can analyze my life, introspect a bit and plan for future. Unfortunately, browsing Reddit is a huge time sink (borderline addiction ngl) and I am uninstalling the app today until I can get my life back on track. \n\nThis sub has been really fun for me and a major reason for me being on reddit. Really thank you everyone on this sub for the bhagwa virat memes and kwality bakchodi. Hope this sub keeps growing forever.

Apparently, maintaining a distance is a hard fucking concept to grasp. Not only they were just an inch apart from each other, but were also holding on the bamboos that was there to help us maintain the line. Constantly breaking line, handing out currency to the one in front line, so that they can buy them liquor without having to get in line. Even they walk so close that I have to yell at them to keep away from me. The rich brought the Corona, and now the poor is spreading it like a wild fire. We are fucking doomed.

<li>Title: "It's something that I wrote after 2014 elections. My grammar is bit poor here but please give it a try!"<br />Body: "Once\xa0upon a time in a land far far away, there was a kingdom where the Champion of town was chosed by a game of chess and he was deemed worthy to rule them all. Yes, you heard me right, it was a\xa0 town of intellects and their Champion and Ruler was chosen by a Game of Chess. There were three contenders who set their claim to the Champion's Throne. All of three were different in their talent, background and ideology. First one was a Champion already but of smaller region who wanted to become the best of them all. Little low in formal education but highly skilled in practical knowlesge, he was A Messiah to some. As legend have it, he burned all his enemies alive. This was reason that he was hated by some but loved by many. Of all the talents he possessed, his speech was most finest and with smartest of council to guide him, he surely was everyone's bet. The Second Champion was highly qualified and who has better chances to win a Game of Chess then who had finest education. He was a nobody few time before but his Revolutions guided by his Saint Guru made him a household name. He was so dedicated to win the throne that he abandoned his previous throne to give full effort in biggest match of his life. Legend says about him that he had a Revolutionary Idea which was guaranteed to reform the world as we know it. The Common folk loves nothing more than a revolution so The Second Champ was sure their favourite pick. The Third Champ came from a House of Champions whose history was older than time. He was the youngest of them all. He grew up in a World of Champions hearing about the tales of his legendary ancestors. His plans to win the game were doubted but he not even once doubted himself and who can defeat one who believes in himself. So now let's arrive at The Judgement Day i.e. Day of Championship. Now the dilemma was that chess is a game of two people and contenders were three so who were to start the game. The First Champion started his treacherous tricks even before the game and asked the other two contenders to show their pair of dice which were must in a Game of Chess or so he claimed. The Second Champ understood the plot and asked the first champ not to worry about his fate. The Third Champ was confused and embarrassed on how he forgot to bring\xa0 the dice. So he apologised and left The Championship so that he could prepare for next fight. As stupid it seems but First Champ trick worked because his stupid trick outwitted The Third Champ. Now with Two Final Contenders decided Board and all it's pieces were set and so the match began. First Champion plan was simple to win the match based on the facts and methods of book but with his little touch. The Second Champion plan was unclear to all as during most of the game he was whining and crying over foul play of The First Champion while Judges could spot none. As history have it Stupid tricks won over Real methods on very rare night and unfortunately to The Second Champ, it was not one of those nights. Hence The First Champion won the Game with Checkmate and almost all his peices intact. Hence he was crowned the Champion of them all hence One worthy to Rule them All. The Second Champ was still whining and crying while whole kingdom laughed to his face. Many claimed that the reason of his defeat was that he deflected from paths of his Saint Guru. So for coming years The First Champion ruled over the Kingdom and as he used to say Good days didn't seem so far away.\nNow I want to thank you for being a patience reader and would like to ask you to read this story again. Also this time bear in mind that it is not my original work but a story inspired from Great Indian Politics.

<li>Title: 'TULIP: New Government Initiative, Aimed At Professional Development, Opens Doors For Fresh Graduates'<br />Body: "On 4th June 2020, Union Human Resource Development (HRD)\u2009minister Dr Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, minister of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA)\u2009Hardeep Singh Puri and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) jointly inaugurated The Urban Learning Internship Programme (TULIP) to provide internship opportunities to thousands of fresh graduates and engineers of the country under the ‚ÄòSmart City‚Äô projects.\n\n#Background of TULIP\nTULIP has been conceived pursuant to the Budget 2020-21 announcement by the Finance Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman under the theme ‚ÄòAspirational India‚Äô. \n\n&gt;&gt;‚ÄúThe Government proposes to start a program whereby the urban local bodies across the country would provide internship opportunities to fresh engineers for a period up to one year.‚Äù \n&gt;&gt;\nGovt. Announcement\n\nSuch a program will help reap the benefits of India‚Äôs demographic dividend as it is poised to have the largest working-age population in the world in the coming years.\n\nGeneral education may not reflect the depth of productive knowledge present in society. Instead of approaching education as ‚Äòdoing by learning,‚Äô our societies need to reimagine education as ‚Äòlearning by doing.‚Äô\n\nTULIP- ‚ÄúThe Urban Learning Internship Program‚Äù would help fulfill twin goals of providing interns with hands-on learning experience as well as infusing fresh energy and ideas in the functioning of India‚Äôs ULBs and Smart Cities.\n\n#What is TULIP ?\nThe Urban Learning Internship Program (TULIP)‚Äô is a program for providing internship opportunities to fresh graduates in all Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and Smart Cities across the country.\n\nThe TULIP portal has been developed by AICTE. Under the internship programme students will get to work for 100 smart cities under ministry of housing and urban development.\n\nThe platform is customizable and provides immense flexibility to both ULBs/ Smart Cities and interns to enable convenient access. Security features have been thoroughly tested and the platform has been made scalable, federated and transparent by design.\n\nAn MoU has also been signed between MoHUA and AICTE. The MoU, inter alia, lays down roles and responsibilities of AICTE and MoHUA over a period of 5 years. Technical support for the platform shall be anchored by AICTE and the programmatic non-technical support shall be anchored by MoHUA.\n\n#Who are Eligible to apply ?\nThe internships under TULIP are open to Indian Citizens who graduate from an undergraduate program can apply within 18 months from graduating. It is open to courses and streams as prescribed by ULBs/smart cities in their requirements and both AICTE affiliated and non-AICTE college graduates can apply.\n\n#What will be the Stipend of such internships ?\nThe stipend and its amount are under the scope and purview of the specific ULB/smart city one is applying to. Any stipend or allowance amount, if provided or not, will be mentioned in the perks and allowances section of the internship posted by the ULB/smart city.\n\n**[FAQ's](https://internship.aicte-india.org/module_ulb/Dashboard/TulipMain/faq.php#accordion)**\n\n**[Webportal](https://internship.aicte-india.org/index.php)**\n\n**[TULIP Portal](https://internship.aicte-india.org/module_ulb/Dashboard/TulipMain/index.php)**\n\n**[PDF Brochure](https://internship.aicte-india.org/module_ulb/Dashboard/TulipMain/Handbook.pdf)**\n\nSource: https://www.rajras.in/index.php/the-urban-learning-internship-program-tulip-launched-by-union-govt/"<br />Author: 'CholiMein'<br />id: 'gwn6q5'<br />Flair :Bakchod News</li>

So what happen in city /towns and it's surrounding was never effect the villages as they have to gave tax to a fix authority( local landlords) . So major actrocities were done in so called city/town and trade routes of those time and that's why you will see Muslim culture influence mostly limited to urban areas. Muslim where-ever have a strong hold tried to penetrate that self sufficient village structure by forced conversion which was mostly limited to North India that's why castism is still equally present in Muslim because they changed only religion of that self suffcient society that's why presence of Islam in rural India mostly limited to North India or bengal. Muslim doesn't provide any new opportunity. They tried where ever they can try to spread islam forcefully according to their limited capability. They were barbaric Islamic fanatics. We all knew about jajiya tax and not a single 300 old temple in North India.....all the remaing one are either hidden or burried for eg kujrao or sachi stupa.\n\nAlso with partition a population shift happen if we take account the population of Indian subcontinent then our share decrease to 55-60%. As our nation divided on base of religion India was the nation for Hindu. We all knew 95% &amp; 90% majority countries pakistan and bengladesh respetively  were once 100% dharmic. So Muslim were barbaric Islamic fanatics not some sugar coated ruler these leftist try to potray.

Although if a general hate for non northeastern Indians(there\'s a lot of it) counts as racism, I\'d say a small percentage of the northeast is racist. In Arunachal Pradesh, there\'s a term used to describe any non northeastern Indian - haaring. To me, it\'s the equivalent of being called chinky. The word "haaring" or in some cases "nipak" is used in a derogatory sense. The problem is that this word has been around for some time. Idk where and how it originated exactly, but the entirety of the generation before ours seem to use it. Bc mere hi maa bap use karte hai iss word ko. I did too, until I had some sense knocked into me. And a huge percentage of, if not, the entire state uses this word on any non northeastern Indian. The thing that bugged me the most is that some of my former female classmates(mostly) put up stories on IG  a few years back, complaining that people were being racist, calling them chinky or momo and all that crap. I understand that this is a bad thing but like, bro, you do that too. To the same people. To another Indian. And you expect it to stop? Kaun sa maal fuk raha hai tu? \n\nFor me personally,  I was just racially profiled once- in that school excursion i mentioned. Some kid called me chinky and a nepali. Bhai chunky bula le, mind nahi karunga. Bc nationality change mat kar mera, haath jodta hu. Even in college, I have friends and they horse around with me and vice versa. They call me corona I call them AIDS and Ebola(not the most accurate comeback but comeon ,chamgadar kaun khata hai bhai?). \n\nAnyway, that\'s my opinion on racism against northeasterners (esp my bros from Arunachal). Let me know your thots in the comments. Jai hind.'<br />Author: 'vobsnbegana'<br />id: 'gvy26y'<br />Flair :Rant</li>

I see a lot of people predicting that this country will be go down the drain and the radical left and pseudo liberals will take over. Well my friends, this had already been happening from 8th Century B.C. (First Islamic Invasion) to 2014. \n\nWe are hearing more and more about forced conversion and anti-Hindu propaganda nowadays. But the reason behind it is that people are now calling it out fearlessly and reacting against it. Anti-Hindu propaganda has always existed and will continue to exist until the end of time.\n\nBut we won't be taken down by such a small thing. WE are the first and last of the great ancient civilizations, we have withstood the test of time, calamities, atrocities, war and every other imaginable hurdle known to mankind. You can't ideologically enslave 100 crore + people forever. The statistics prove it. A nationalistic govt. won for a second time with an even greater margin. Numbers don't lie, they are the absolute truth of the universe and the closest thing to the handwriting of god. \n\nSlowly but steadily we will overcome these problems and deal with these idiots trying to bring us down. But we all have to play a part in it. The govt. can't and won't do everything on it's own.\n\nWe will be there when humanity becomes an interplanetary civilization, we will be there when humanity becomes a galactic civilization and we will be there when humanity becomes an inter-galactic civilization.\n\nSo my brothers and sisters, hold your head high and fearlessly, be proud of your identity and work together for the development of this great nation.\n\nJai Hind, Jai Bharat"<br />Author: 'tundra_tea_party'<br />id: 'gvqmcw'<br />Flair :HQ Text Bakchodi</li>

There are a lot of issues pertaining to Indian family culture and values and role of men in a family, what do they think of women working, being career driven, should there be equal distribution of house chores if the lady of the house is also working, would you be okay if your wife worked more than you and earned more than you?\n\nThen there are other sets of issues, like in this lockdown the load of family has fallen onto women and sisters more, with no help or schools, women are juggling between work, home, kids, elders, and social work.\n\nShould men dictate if a women is to reveal her monthly menstruation cycle and talk about it, aware others or not? Do men know what is leading to evolution? Is it just copulation or the monthly periods too, that a vast majority of women find painful for almost their entire lives?\n\nShould men/boys for their "pleasure" accept commercialization of women in pornography and advertisements or not? If a women is wearing clothes not acceptable by the men or larger part of the society, should men stare and feel it is ok to do so? Because the may probably be doing it to show them only?\n\nTl/dr: A sanghan is trying to stir questions among aware Hindu men that have been a topic of discussion amongst Indian women for centuries\n\n\nYou can give elaborate answers/discuss on these issues, make different questions surrounding the whole idea of it and post it at various platforms, talk about it.

Things India should do instead:\n\nBan any further new companies coming from China to India. Ban any new subbrands creating by already existing Chinese companies in India. \n\nGovt should subsidise Indian companies so that they can raise.
