<li>Title: 'Since the police inspector investigating Delhi riots was murdered the other day, I thought to bring up some names which were brought up by multiple locals at the time of riots, but I have yet to see a single charge against them, even after 3 months.'<br />Body: 'Some old posts which were made documenting testimonies of locals immediately following the riots.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fax95t/mother_of_a_victim_blames_aap_mla_haji_younous/\n\n&gt;**Mother of a victim blames AAP MLA Haji Younous for sending men for killing**..says the previous day, all Muslim women &amp; children had blocked roads in Khajuri Khas &amp; were chanting "Hum cheen ke lenge azadi"..going from door to door, saying join us in the crowd or you are against us.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fbcb9l/one_more_person_blames_aap_mla_haji_yunus_for/\n\n&gt;One more person **blames AAP MLA Haji Yunus for violence &amp; attacking Hindu families** Says azadi slogans went on for 2 months, on 25th Yunus took out a peace march in Hindu area, had a meeting in masjid &amp; immediately later followed with attack. No damage to Muslims, all Hindu properties burnt to rubble\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1233679057046269952\n\n&gt;Third person blames Haji Yunus for bringing in riot mobs. **"Ye toh hota rehta hai" said AAP\'s Haji Yunus &amp; Sher Mohammad to Hindus in Brijpuri area when they started questioning the killings** of children. Many were injured by stone pelters that came from a Muslim neighborhood across a drain\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1233685506866597888\n\n&gt;Fourth person blames AAP MLA Haji Yunus for the riot mobs. "Since Haji Yunus has taken charge things have worsened for Hindus. A Muslim\'s showroom was cleared ahead of the riots &amp; some men came &amp; burnt it to frame us. They climbed atop the nearby mosque &amp; desecrated the school,\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fbuzeb/for_5_years_this_place_was_under_a_bjp_mla/\n\n"For 5 years, this place was under a BJP MLA, nothing ever happened between the two communities. **Newly elected AAP MLA Mohd. Haji Yunus** turned things around in 15 days &amp; they attacked us"\n\nEven after all these public testimonies, name of Haji Yunus hasn\'t come up so far in official police investigations.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fhc9d1/antihindu_riots_aap_mp_sanjay_singh_congress/\n\nAnti-Hindu riots: **AAP MP Sanjay Singh, Congress leader Udit Raj\'s** name emerge as ED interrogates radical Islamist outfit PFI members\n\n\nEven after emergence of deeper role of PFI in Delhi riots, one of the chief actors responsible for conspiracy to burn schools adjacent to the school owned by him, is charged to have links with PFI, Tablighi Jamaat &amp; Deoband, no further progress on Sanjay Singh\'s or Udit Raj\'s role (if any) in the riots which burnt Delhi as Modi was hosting Trump.\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gox6hd/delhi_riots_times_now_accesses_report_from_delhi/\n\n&gt;Times Now accesses report from Delhi police of evidence of group of "Leftist-Islamists" including **Delhi University professor pre-planning the riots** to malign India/Modi; Whatsapp evidence of "hidayat" to "Hindu-Muslim karwana padega", chose 19 spots in NE Delhi for its population comp.\n\nThis report from Delhi police about DU professors pre-planning the riots is pretty recent. However, given most DU professors are backed by pretty powerful foreign NGOs, like those of Soros (OSF), Ford Foundation, Oxfam (Evangelical), it remains to be seen whether the DU professors who were supposedly a part of "Hindu Muslim karwana padega" chats would be chargesheeted. \n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fdx30z/via_cnnnews18_the_rioters_attacking_the_police/\n\nhttps://www.organiser.org/Encyc/2020/3/5/Latest-video-evidences-prove-violent-Muslim-mobs-attacked-police-.html\n\n&gt; Via CNNNews18: The **rioters attacking the police** are actually coming from the set of protestors against CAA, who were** led by an AAP MLA.** These protesters were carrying guns, sickles. They were adopting the Middle-East strategies of planting women at front so men can attack the police.\n\nThe above report by CNN implicates an AAP MLA Mohammad Athar in the Chandbagh riots where the mobs attacked the police forces &amp; killed Constable Ratan Lal &amp; almost killed DCP Amit Sharma. Athar is alleged to have brought the protesters who were carrying guns, sickles, etc. \n\nHowever, yesterday, when the chargesheet of murder of Ratan Lal was released, there was no Mohammad Athar in the chargesheet. Now maybe because it\'s because Athar is innocent &amp; locals were wrong.\n\nBut let\'s also remember that Inspector Vishal isn\'t the first police officer who was involved with investigating Delhi riots investigators to ~~be murdered~~ died under mysterious circumstances. Even IB officer Ankit Sharma who was performing duty incognito in Tahir Hussain\'s locality was the first to be not just murdered, but brutally murdered, stabbed 51 times &amp; then thrown into the drain as a targeted killing of the IB/police force. What nexus had Ankit Sharma uncovered that he was tortured so much before death?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gy62q2/a_police_officer_who_was_part_of_delhi_police/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gvpvdg/big_delhi_police_chargesheet_says_ib_official/\n\nLet\'s also remember that up till 2 days before ~~murder~~mysterious death of Inspector Vishal, Kejriwal government was fighting a legal battle to let AAP lawyers represent Delhi police force in prosecution cases against ex-AAP MLA Tahir Hussain &amp; other Delhi case riots. \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gtxeo9/these_articles_explain_why_inspite_of_delhi/\n\nAmanatullah Khan even today is trying to save Tahir Hussain saying the only reason Tahir Hussain has been charged by Delhi police is because he is a Muslim. [Just before the riots, Tahir Hussain had called Amanatullah 56 times, Sisodiya 18 times &amp; Kejriwal 3 times.](https://www.organiser.org/Encyc/2020/3/3/Tahir-Hussain-trail-leads-to-Arvind-Kejriwal-and-Manish-Sisodia.amp.html) Yet even today, even with multiple AAP leaders being named by locals in bringing the riot mobs, Tahir Hussain is painted by the media to be the sole mastermind of riots. Maybe a plain corporator indeed is the sole mastermind of the riots planned the exact days current PM was in global spotlight, maybe no other PM aspirants were involved in/had knowledge of these riots.\n\nAfter Epstein **killed himself**, all the pedo-ring investigations in US went cold. Given now even police officers investigating the case are being murdered, would the big names, the real names behind the riots be charged?'<br />Author: 'brackenlassie'<br />id: 'h084xb'<br />Flair :Jihad</li>

<li>Title: 'Serious discussion :)'<br />Body: 'Bhratao, I just want to ask some questions on some serious topics I hope we\'re going in this together :)\n\n[   -Please go slower to understand it better :)-   ]\n\nNote : I haven\'t read any Geeta, puran, Vedas, vedaanta etc. I haven\'t read any scriptures of any organized religion. I\'m a average person who knows some Mahabharat and ramayan coz I have watched some shows.\n\n-( When you answer a point please add --answer of 1. ,2. , 3. Etc so I can understand your views/answer fully )-\n\n1. What\'s your views on SADHGURU? Do you have any understanding of what he\'s talking about?\n\n2. What\'s your views on attachment?\n\n3. What\'s your views on enlightenment?\n\n4. What\'s your views on sprituality? \n\n5. If you\'re a person who only believe in something or know that there is this thing(big bang, Black hole etc) that\'s because there\'s some "scientific evidence" how do you view life,God,Truth, enlightenment, attachment, pleasure?\n\n6. Sir, when we see some people "converting" to Hinduism/sanatan dhram don\'t you think that HOW THE HELL CAN SOMEONE "CONVERT" TO Hinduism/sanatan dhram?? I have seen some videos of pandits/pujaaris saying some mantr or doing something (rituals).. to "convert" them BUT sir, i have small knowledge of scriptures so help me to understand WHEN DID ASIAN RELIGIONS BECOME ORGANIZED RELIGIONS???\n\n7. WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ON EDUCATION? DO YOU THINK IF SOMEONE KNOW HOW TO DO MATH OR WRITE AND READ SOMETHING THEY\'RE EDUCATED? In world there are millions of people who knows how to do math, write something,read something but still all of them are suffering.. there are wars, violence in everyday life, don\'t you think education is to see things as they are? what is real education? \n\n8. What\'s your views on love? Do you think love is just sex? Or do you think it\'s something more? Sir, what is love? Do you think love of a mother/father is love? Does love have any boundaries or is it limitless?\n\n9. Sir, what\'s your views on pleasure? Don\'t you think we\'re always looking for some pleasure? Pleasure of knowledge, position,power, possession, etc.\n\n10. Sir, don\'t you think we have to face our daily life problems rather than running away from it by watching movies, drinking alcohol, sex, violence.. do you see sir what I\'m saying?\n\n11. In your views/understanding what is God? I\'m not asking what Geeta, puranas, Quran, science says.. I\'m asking what do you think about God? \n\n12. Sir, fear is Necessary for something to survive but after surviving there\'s no need to be afraid.. people always depends on religion because they are afraid, they\'re afraid of coming to an end.. they have all these problems instead of solving this they go on into their lives their daily life which is miserable.\n\n13. What is it that you truly want? I\'m not talking about your daily needs.. I\'m asking WHY are you living? Why are you here reading this? What are you seeking?\n\n14. Have you heard of SADHGURU talking about confidence? If not in short he said "confidence without clarity is disaster" which is true, we\'re taught to be more confident.. peoples like Sandeep Maheshwaari have some clarity I\'m not denying that but he doesn\'t have full clarity which is absolutely needed to understand the truth/god,etc he and many more people say go fight for your success, do more work to become successful.. does successful mean have money?  they don\'t ask the basic question which is why are you seeking?\n\n15. I\'m not a follower of anything I\'m asking WHY you follow something at all isn\'t because you\'re afraid? Isn\'t because you want others to decide your life? Yes people have taught you how to stand, talk ,walk, eat, which is needed to be a functioning member of society but that\'s it. After knowing this and that that\'s it. but after this you stay dependent on others because they have taught you all of this and you assume they know better and that\'s where the game of following begins..\n\n\n\n\n\n( If you\'re not interested it\'s ok ignore it like u have always been ignoring it. If you\'re offended ignore it coz for you I\'m just a barking dog.)'<br />Author: 'imsimplynobody'<br />id: 'h07i33'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion</li>

I don't know why maharashtra BJP is not acting on such serious issues despite of being in opposition? \n\nBJP has to pressure MVA govt over this issue. BJP used to have an image of party of lower and middle class people in Maharashtra, BJP was the one who fought for dalits and OBCs in state but now situation is very different BJP is silent not uttering a word on serious atrocities despite of being in opposition.

<li>Title: 'Right Media, Left media. Wtf is this?'<br />Body: 'Long post, please read if you care about a fellow. \n\nI am awfully dejected by the dirty politics and the acts of media. \nThe right-wing does not want to realize its flaws and the left-wing, words will be less to describe its evil nature and the doom it is planning to bring in our country. I can never fathom to be a leftist. \n\nBefore coming to my rant, let me give you guys a brief intro, So you guys dare not to think of me as from the other side (because thats all you guys do when someone points out a fault in your belief system)\nI am a Hindu,19, avid reader/learner of Veda and Mahabharat, and a proud believer of the omniscient nature of Vedas. Look up to great sages like Swami Dayanand, Bhishma Pitamah, and also the recently passed Rajiv Dixit(Up for a debate on this name). \nI took birth in a Dalit family. (Which is actually not Dalit because caste is not birth right but derived by the occupation according to manusmriti) \nNow, Our Hindu texts and Manusmriti(which was used as constitution till few thousand years) are the most well constructed guidelines which leaks only minimal crimes/wrong doings. \nI assume it is well known in this sub that these texts have been altered and entered with nefarious addings since the Mughal invasion and primarily in the British raj times. \nThese editing were only successfully due to greedy pandits. The seemingly rigid system cannot fall unless the the man in power lets it. \nYou dare not assume that I talk about every pandit in this context. \nAfter the independence, our system has divided into two parts in public, the people who want to bury our religion and the people who has agreed on the addings and practice it there on. \nYou don‚Äôt have to be too smart to name who‚Äôs who. \nI am in no mood to care about the left so I‚Äôll just say about the remaining that has taught themselves to believe\n\n* Hanuman was a monkey and / not a Vanar (‡§µ‡§® =forest + ‡§®‡§∞ =man) the man living in forest\n\n* Shri Krishna was a womanizer, left Radha at early age and / not realizing the fact this is just foul play from the addings to ruin our gods character while there is no mention of the existence of Radha and stealing of butter /maakhan etc in Shuddh Mahabharat\n\n* Panchali was wife of 5 pandavs  and / not caring to read the actual sanskrit shloks which reveal, Panchali was handed to Yudhishtra from Arjuna after he won the swaymvar\n\n* The existence of fantasies like Aakashwani (voice from sky) and characterization of nature bodies (like ganga river to Ganga mother of Bhishma) and / not realizing that these addings are only to take you further from your own  religion, they translate Aakashwani from ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§¶‡•Ç‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∂‡§ø‡§§‡§Æ which means the messenger of dev(the learned man) speaks. \n\nand many more, these were made to give a wonderland image to our religion so we intend on converting. \n\nBut most of all, these addings were aimed to divide us. They targeted the weakest link, the laborers, the dalits. \nTo cause a havoc and showcase the cruelty on the hardworkers to wake the emotional counterpart. \n\nTherefore, they absolutely abused our books with rules and limitation within the varna-occupation system. Filled it with filthy and sinister ‚Äúpunishments‚Äù. Led crimes against your own people, killings on Dalits. Bred ever-longing hatred towards the poor and untouchability. \nAnd to completely polarize, the britishers made the dalits ‚Äú‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§≤‡§®‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§∏‡•Ä‚Äù, to image the aggressor as invaders.  \nThey even formulated restrictions against women. \n\nNow, my problem lies with people forgetting our own religion and burgeoning from the roots of britshers‚Äô deeds. \nThe hate towards dalits still seeps in our country. \nStates like UP, have the most killings against Dalits. \nThey are still untouchable in some areas, murdered if entered mandir in villages. Are you serious? Every human had the right to perform Agnihotra hawan twice a day and now even the entry in mandir is restricted. \n\nOn 8th June 2020, A 17 year old dalit boy was killed in one of UP‚Äôs village for temple rules. Look up the internet and you‚Äôll find whats dreadful. \nNone of this so called right wing media posted even an article on this crime while you all find almost all the left wingers articles ranging from ndtv to quint. \nMuch of their news is fake, but these killings are real. \nThe hatred in people‚Äôs eyes is real. Media reflects the ideologies of people to great extent.\nI am speaking about this because it is often overlooked. I am not just another dalit seeking of your worthless sympathy, but just to unite us Hindi, the arya we are, to fight the other side.  \n\nIn the wake of BLM in America, let‚Äôs reassess our beliefs against casteism. \nCasteism is not foul, but the perception is. \n\nP.S I can debate on anything I said.'<br />Author: 'theconcentrated'<br />id: 'gzwekp'<br />Flair :Rant</li>

<li>Title: 'Fact check'<br />Body: 'Shahrukh Pathan, who was seen aiming a gun at a policeman during the riots in Delhi in February, along with four others has been found to be a part of a deep-rooted conspiracy which triggered the communal riot at Maujpur Chowk. The investigating agency will be submitting chargesheets before the courts on Tuesday (9 June), including the one which pertains to the alleged role of Pathan and others in the riots.\n\nOn Tuesday, the investigating agency will file three chargesheets in three different cases before various courts. The three cases are: Maujpur Chowk riot case, Kardampuri Pulia riot case and the Kardampuri government dispensary riot case.\n\nIn the Maujpur Chowk riot case, the police found that on February 24 at about 11 a.m., two groups clashed at the chowk.\n\nOne group was supporting the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens and the other group was opposing it. Initially the protest was peaceful but soon it became violent and led to incidents of stone pelting, brick-batting, arson, firing and sabotage from both sides.\n\nThis led to injuries to several policemen as well as other people and created an atmosphere of fear among the public. On that day, one person Vinod Singh lost his life in a related incident and a separate case of murder was registered against his killers.\n\nFive accused, including Shahrukh Pathan, were arrested in this case. "During probe it was found that Pathan is the main accused in another case in which he had brandished his gun and shot at Head Constable Deepak Dahiya in full public view," the police said.\n\nHis illegal firearm, a 7.65 mm pistol along with two live rounds, was recovered from him. Several shots had been fired by him and three empty shells were recovered from the spot, the police said.\n\nThe Kardampuri Pulia riot case is about the murder of Mohammad Furkan, gunshot injuries to four other people and injuries to 17 policemen because of the heavy stone pelting on 24 February.\n\nDuring the probe, the police found that the closed-circuit television in the area was damaged by the rioters on 23 February. They, however, managed to get some video footage. Based upon the statements of the eyewitnesses, video evidence and other technical evidence, four people were arrested. "Today chargesheet is being filed against all the four accused persons and further investigation is being carried out to identify and arrest more accused," the police said.\n\nThe Kardampuri government dispensary case pertains to the communal riots on 25 February behind Ambedkar College on the service road where the rioters set fire to two parking lots and stabbed 32-year-old Deepak. The deceased Deepak was a e- rickshaw driver.\n\nBased upon statements, video evidence and other technical evidence, so far four accused persons have been arrested in this case.\n\n"Today chargesheet is being filed against all the accused persons. Further investigation is continuing to identify and arrest more accused," the Delhi Police said.'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'gznfgy'<br />Flair :PKMKB</li>

<li>Title: 'Incredible Hindu Temple - Ancient Temples are MACHINES with MOVING parts?'<br />Body: "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TWQZHef11w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TWQZHef11w)\n\n Hey guys, ancient temples in India have moving parts. You may not believe me, watch this. Yes, this is a column made of stone in a temple in India. Normally, you will not even think of trying to touch or rotate this stone block, but someone accidentally discovered or re-discovered that it could be rotated.  What could possibly be the reason to have something like this installed in a temple? To set up something like this there has to be a rotating mechanism and it is not easy to set this up in stone because you cannot open it afterwards and put lubricant inside. \n\nTo have a rotating mechanism made of stone, you need to have advanced knowledge in engineering. No, this is not the only temple with moving parts, look at this one. Here is a column which has small holes through which, you can insert your finger. Inside, there is a ball, a stone ball and you can move it up and down. Of course, you cannot pull the ball out through these tiny holes, you can only move it inside the hollow column. How was the ball put inside in the first place? If you claim this is carved, how did they manage to scoop out the rock which was inside through these small holes? There is another ancient temple in a place called Uthirakosamangai, this is at least 1200 years old. There is a ball inside a lion's mouth. You can roll the ball, you can rotate it, but you cannot pull it out of the lions' mouth. What's more bizarre? the lion is made of solid granite, but the ball inside is made of a type of rock called Onyx. So how was this ball put inside the lion's mouth, and why are we not able to pull this ball out? More and More young people are becoming interested in Indian temples and they are sending some incredible videos to my email. Here is a snake‚Äôs mouth wide open, and the mouth is held open because Lord Vishnu‚Äôs Conch shell is placed between its upper and lower jaw. But you can rotate this Conch. \n\nIt spins very well, much better than some modern rotating devices. But the real question is: why were these moving parts set up in temples? Some say that if you move these parts in a certain rhythm, in a certain order or a certain speed, secret chambers can be opened which are hiding in plain sight. Now what do I mean by this?  Let us look at this one, this is a safe box to keep money and boxes like these were used in India for many centuries. There is a type of safe used by a group called Chettiyars, they have mastered the art of safe making. It is so complex, it is uncrackable even today, unless you know which knobs to turn, in which order, to open the safe. In fact, when a normal person looks at this for the first time, he will not even realize that this as a safe that can be opened, he will just think that this is a decorative piece made of solid metal.  But now, look at this ceiling in an ancient temple in a place called Vettuvan Kovil. This is made of stone, and of course it has these fabulous and complex pattern of the 9 Influencers called Navagraha, and 12 Zodiac signs and other features of astrology. But look at this area in the center, this is a door knob, which means you can open this. \n\nThis is also a very ancient temple, and because of time, you can now see the gaps between the door and the rest of the chamber. And look at these protruding circular knobs. I believe that if you rotate them in a particular pattern, just like the metal safe u saw, you can open this secret chamber in the ceiling of this temple. I mean clearly this is a door which leads to something. In ancient Indian temples, there are many many mysteries hidden in plain sight. We have not even started to understand them.  Now, let us look at one of the most iconic megalithic structures in the world Heritage site of Hampi. \n\nThis is a gigantic stone Chariot standing about 15 feet tall and 10 feet wide and weighs more than 120 tons. It is so awe-inspiring, it is even printed on Indian money. Even by conservative archeological accounts, it was built at least 500 years ago. But, In spite of being very popular among tourists, this Chariot remains shrouded in mystery. Google and Wikipedia give blatantly false information, for example Google calls this a monolithic chariot. If you examine this structure, you realize it is not Monolithic at all, it is not made of one stone. Look at how each wheel is made of a separate stone block and they are setup on the axles, like a real working chariot. The chariot appears to be not built as a decorative or religious structure. Rather, it is built like a real vehicle, made of several parts which are assembled together. I know this is a weird question to ask, but is it possible that this chariot has moving parts?"<br />Author: 'NapoleonAK'<br />id: 'gz2bfn'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>

The 4 year old girl was severely wounded in the attack too."<br />Body: 'In a viral video which would haunt humanity for years to come, an inconsolable 4 year old is seen crying and repeating the same word again and again, "Amma" (mother). She\'s fresh out of surgery herself and hasn\'t got out of her hospital bed yet, but little does she know that her beloved "amma" can now never return.\n\nThis hapless child is little Bramsh Baloch, a native of Balochistan, whose mother, Malik Naz was murdered in cold blood for refusing to bow down to the evils of the militants backed by the Pakistani state. More than a week has passed, and the alleged leader of the squad is still "nowhere to be found". It has become routine for the Pakistani State to use the local death squad militants to rape, abduct and kill Baloch Political and Human Rights Activists.\n\nLittle Bramsh\'s story, however gave leeway to an online campaign, #JusticeForBramsh. Hundreds of people from from Balochistan and abroad participated in the campaign and demanded justice for the poor child. June 1 saw a large number of protestors gathering at Turbat city\'s "Shaheed Fida Chowk". On June 2, citizens of Washok and Bulaida rallied to question the provincial government. The port city of Gwadar also saw similar protests on May 30. Similar protests were announced in the capital city of Quetta on June 4.\n\nThe Internet and cellular services have been cut off in the capital city of Quetta since June 1. According to the locals, the Internet shutdown comes after another 23 year old Baloch man, Bilal Noorzai was brutally beaten to death by an angry mob of vigilantes . It is pertinent to mention that cellular services have been cut-off in the Panjur, Kech and Kalat districts of Balochistan for the past 5 years. Internet accessibility remains a major issue in Balochistan.\n\nI request all of you to help in spreading little Bramsh\'s story.\n\n#JucticeForBramsh\n https://www.opindia.com/2020/06/justice-for-bramsh-baloch-murder-pakistan-balochistan/amp/'<br />Author: 'huicups'<br />id: 'gywbo5'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion</li>
