<li>Title: 'OSInt about Islamic organisations and institutions of the country'<br />Body: "So, you just read the title right? OSInt. It stands for Open Source Intelligence. \nRecently while going through a video, I came to understand the fact that internal intelligence apparatus of the country, isn't very keen on gathering OSInt regarding the madarsas, Islamic universities, schools like Darul Uloom Deoband, various dargahs etc, let alone their surveillance. Let's get familiar to this term OSInt. By now you already know the full form. In detail it means the intelligence and analysable information that is collected using 'available to all' sources. Broadly speaking, newspapers, media, public statements. With reference to the Islamic religious institutions/organisations, the sources of OSInt can be the Urdu newspapers, the Fatawas, the statements of prominent Islamic ( preachers/public figures/politicians/Bollywood folks ), their unnoticed activities, like meetings with foreign leaders. Urdu newspapers and Magazines and Fatawas give the insight into the minds of the Islamists, or the narrative they are trying to build or sell. Like it or not, after partition, the scarcity of people who can read Urdu, has alienated us and made it difficult for us to monitor their activities. \nI'm looking for interested folks who can read Urdu and may be we can think of watching them."<br />Author: 'Raktcharitra'<br />id: 'kb83ps'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: 'The current Indian national political scenario'<br />Body: " \n\nThere are farmer protests going on this very moment, Bengal elections next year, TN has a very fickle political scenario with whatever the fuck Rajni is gonna do, bollywood just came out of a very ugly political situation (idk how that devolved to that) and we are probably on the brink of an all out religious war.\n\nDisclaimer: I don't really have any political party i support, i support all of them for different ideologies, so don't get butthurt or ban me from here because i don't support the party you like.(Talking from personal randia experience here)\n\nBJP:\n\n1.Privatization of several government organizations (the latest casualty being the railways). Yeah, it might help the trains safer, more hygenic and whatnot but nobody can deny the fact that the ticket pricing is gonna be too high. It is easily the most viable mode of transport for the lower middle class and now they probably cannot afford it anymore. Spending taxpayer money on Statue of Unity, the new parliament and whatever else. I mean, the cost of building this shit is probably not so astronomical and most of it is probably now in some politician and his builder buddy's pocket, but thats how this country has operated for a long time and its not gonna change anytime soon. Instead of draining that kind of money on the statue or whatever, i feel like they could have done a lot more good if they just stuck to building a hospital or a school or heck, even help ISRO with its future missions (thanks, Mission Mangal). The whole Pakistan rhetoric: Everyone who criticizes the government is labelled anti-national, tukde-tukde or whatever and their image is tarnished by Republic TV and the others. (No, Republic is not neutral). They are also advised to go to Pakistan because clearly you are not allowed to stay in this country if you don't support the ruling party.\n\nCONGRESS:\n\nI mean its caste and religion based politics has now done enough to destroy the country. I can't imagine how this country could have been if Nehru and is descendants would have atleast tried to develop the country instead of focusing on making sure that there is steady flow of money to their pockets and that they cover up all the wrongdoings and scams that have plagued most of their reign( since the late 80s atleast). These dumbfucks are still trying to project Pappu as a mass leader and the party's face on the sole privilage of having a PM daddy (and granny and great-granddaddy). Clearly that plan is not working and they are probably gonna fade out of existence by the end of this decade.\n\nMAHAGATHBANDHAN:\n\nI mean who the hell let this bunch of illiterate bunch of school bullies become national leaders (Arvind Kejriwal is an exception: He is smart and knows how to avoid letting the public see his hindutva self, while letting them realize it). Mayawati is a crazy bitch who had Lucknow laden with elephants when she had CM post. Akhilesh and his father are a bunch of patriarchal cunts who don't want to condemn rape, Lalu and his family needs no introduction in field of crime or politics and Didi is a genuine psycopath. Down south we have confused Kumaraswamy who doesn't know whether he likes the BJP or not and Shiv Sena has an extremely violent brand of hindutva."<br />Author: 'ketchupwithchocolate'<br />id: 'kb6t16'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: 'Hinduism is not just a way of life. IT IS A RELIGION'<br />Body: 'Hinduism is a way of life is an apologetic label used by coward Hindus to please Marxists and westerners who think Hinduism is nothing more than chanting Om or doing yoga. \n\nThis label is used to preemptively defend yourself against any potential criticism or shaming you may face from someone who hates Hinduism as a religion. \n\nBy calling it a way of life you give rise to pseudo hindus who are Hindu in name only but ideologically want Hinduism gone which is how you allow people like Kanhaya, Ravish etc to say they condemn something despite being "Hindus". \n\nThis flexibility is the downfall of hinduism in 21st century. A belief in paramaatma, reverence towards trimurti, avatars, vedas, goddesses has to be a must for you to be allowed to call yourself a Hindu.'<br />Author: 'K2ASikhIsaiBhaiBhai'<br />id: 'kb6ls1'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li>

<li>Title: 'A case in the favour of Sadashivrao Bhau'<br />Body: 'I plan on making a few posts such as this one, before I make a post on the Third Battle of Panipat.\n\n\n\n\nOn the 3rd of August, 1730, the younger brother of Bajirao Ballal, Chimaji Appa was blessed with a son. This boy, he named Sadashivrao. Though, in time, he would earn the nickname Bhau. The young boy\'s father died when he was a mere ten years old. His education and nurturing being taken care of by his aunt Kashibai and his grandmother Radhabhai.\n\n\n\nAt the age of 16, in 1746, he undertook his first campaign. The campaign continued till May 1747 mostly in the western Karnatak region. In January 1747 he won his first battle at Ajra, south of Kolhapur. All together 36 parganas were captured in this campaign.\n\n\n\nAfter the death of Chhatrapati Shahu, Sadashivrao Bhau, would be made the Dewan of Peshwa Balaji Bajirao otherwise known as Nana Saheb. He successfully led the Battle of Udgir which weakened the Nizam of Hyderabad. It was here that Bhau first used a more European method of war, employing his Gardis and artillery to good use and winning the day. Thus, he grew suspicious of the old geurilla way of war and promoted a European model of pitched battles. \n\n\nA few words must be said about these early successes and the effect they had on a man of Bhau\'s temperament and his estimation of his own capabilities. Grant Duff draws a good picture of the young triumphant yet amateur Bhau in these words :\n\n\n" The natural violence of Bhau\'s temper was increased by the family jealousy he had experienced, and the factious intrigues to which it gave rise. His pride was augmented by his extraordinary good fortune in the late campaign, and the spirit of military enthusiasm so dangerous in a general without experience, took complete possession of his mind. Success had inspired him with a blind confidence, which salutary reverses in a humble sphere would in all probability have amended."\n\n\n\nAdded to this mental disposition, was the material factor of war, which was again unfortunately inadequate for the task Bhau was meant to accomplish.\n\n\n\nIn term of soldiers and equipment, he had been supplied with 10,000 of Peshwa\'s own household troops 12,000 of the subordinate chiefs, 8000 disciplined Gardis and 20,000 Pindaris (freebooting raiders). He was provided 8,184 cannon balls out of 19,000 required. 160 maubds of lead and 800 maunds of gunpowder, 99,150 flints for muskets, and an inadequate quantity of 65 sheets against 2000 requisitioned, of European paper for charging the muskets.\n\n\n\nThe Peshwa expected a Maratha army to supply itself with plunder and therefore gave Bhau a mere Rs. 1,88,000 while the monthly expenses exceeded 5 to 6 lakhs. Added to the miserable condition of his supplies and the unsatisfactory composition of his troops, Bhau had one more problem facing him.\n\n\n\nBhau, had too little time to prepare. He had never been to North India, didn\'t know its climate and people or culture. He had with him many families who wished to visit the sacred sites in North India. He didn\'t have boats to ford the rivers in the North. The Marathas fought the Afghans in winter when the Afghans are at their finest, instead of the summer when the climate would have sapped the Durrani of his vitality, this too happened due to delays.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I will say this, yes, there are many aspects that led to the defeat of the Marathas at Panipat, but Bhau is not solely responsible for this. The choice of picking a general lay in the hand of Nana Saheb, who even against the advice of his court should have ocjed Raghunath Rao. The only reason why Bhau was sent to the North instead of Raghunath, who was experienced in the North having led two successful expeditions there, was because the success of Maratha campaigns was judged in monetary terms, and in thus realm, Bhau overtook Raghunath who had brought debt to the Empire. This added with the fact that the army, it\'s supplies and composition also lay in the hands of the court, which also, wasn\'t optimal.\n\n\n\nI\'m open to any discussions in the comments.\n\n\n\n\nSources : Military History of India by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n"Marathas and Panipat" - Hari Ram Gupta\n\n\n\n"Military System of The Marathas" by Surendra Nath Sen\n\n\n\n"Ahwal-e-Jang-e-Bhau-va-Ahmad Shah Durrani" by Pandit Kashiraj, Dewan of Shuja-ud-Daulah.'<br />Author: 'PushyamitraShunga1st'<br />id: 'kay508'<br />Flair :इतिहास :H:</li>

The donkey owners would charge people for carrying them up and down for a fee and would also pay 10% to the society from the revenue they earned. It was a very happy situation for all involved.\nAfter sometime the society management changed, the new management decided to install a lift for carrying people up and down.\nAll hell broke loose and everyone started protesting, this is not fair, society will loose revenue, the donkey owners will be jobless and no food for them (human rights issue), the donkeys will be worthless (animals rights issue), all were angry.\nSociety management clarified, the lift is available to all but the gentlemen who wanted to use the donkeys could still do it. But no, the agitation continued and so finally the new management had to succumb to the pressure.\nThe final arrangement was arrived and so anyone who wanted to climb the building could still use the donkey. The donkey would carry a person, go in the lift and carry people up &amp; down. All were happy.\nDisclaimer: any resemblance of this with the farmers agitation is a coincidence.'<br />Author: 'TejasaK'<br />id: 'ka6ncx'<br />Flair ::Whatsapp: WhatsApp Forward</li>

<li>Title: "Before I sign off for tonight, a representative of the so-called 'Kisan Protests'......."<br />Body: 'He mentioned that the proposed solution while allows for state governments to tax private markets but does not regulate trade in those markets. This is wrong on so many levels: \n\n1: For starters, the fact that a tax is being levied in itself implies state governments will frame rules of regulation of these markets. That there will be mandatory registration of traders (though bad decision as it restricts entry) further require some regulations by states\n\n2: The larger point here is that there are no defined market-places for most products in our economy - but there are standard contract regulations that are levied and that when we speak of unregulated trade, that does not do away with such regulation under standard-contracts.\n\n3: So this entire defence of lack of regulation even in what has been proposed by the government makes little sense and it ignores basic principles of law &amp; econ. It has become increasingly clear that this is not a farmers protest but a political protest\n\n\nIf the government buckles and gives in to guaranteeing MSP, it would be an UNMITIGATED DISASTER for this country'<br />Author: 'Pewdsubzero'<br />id: 'ka10ua'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li>

This is at the same time when the govt is making an active effort to become more digital, which seems a little paradoxical.\n\nIn some instances the high taxes has positive effect such as Samsung opening Asia's biggest smartphone manufacturing centre in India.\n\nAlso this is happening at a time of economic distress due to Covid. \n\nThe govt other than buying 2 VIP commercial jets (although I guess the orders for that were placed long before Covid), is also building a new parliament building.\n\nTypically during such times any Keynsian follower would advise on investing in infrastructure that can be monetised. This would also act as short term stimulus for the daily wage earner.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on tax increases and the agenda of the govt expenditure?"<br />Author: 'tryingmybest8'<br />id: 'k9zbvq'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

You can downvote me to hell, I don't really care, but just think and introspect for a second. Jokes are all fine, but constantly targeting a community (you all know which community) and making non-constructive degrading jokes, such as those of incest and bestiality, as if these things don't happen in Hindu society as well stinks of hypocrisy at worst and self-indulgent ignorance at best.\n\nI am a right-winger, but whenever I see a repulsive meme of Muslims and now recently the Punjabi Farmers Protest, labelling them all as Khalistanis and stuff, I don't want to be connected to the poster in any way, even though we might espouse similar politics. I am not saying that we should become some sort of intellectual opposition to randia(and if we are, we are doing a horrible job of it), as this subreddit is for memes and jokes, but we should not make our subreddit exclusive to a political spectrum. I honestly can't imagine myself being a Muslim being felt welcome to this subreddit. If jokes were pointed at all communities, then it would be a different matter. Jokes are supposed to be something both the recipient and the giver should be able to laugh over. If I am wrong about any assumptions or experiences that I have mentioned here, I will be more than happy to correct myself.

Even when you don't  turn on cloud syncing.\n\n&gt;Personal data can be misused in multiple ways. Some time ago, I was in a company of lawyers who were putting their criminal minds to work and I eavesdropped. \n\n&gt;Suppose you are a judge or an govt official in a responsible position. You could be blackmailed into doing something illegal or unlawful. That would  undermine the confidence of citizens in the system, which in a long run would cripple our institutions. China would be selling all these personal data to ISI funded criminal gangs in our country. It's a very serious situation which is still not getting enough attention.\n\n&gt;For example, look at whats happening i Australia.

I don't get the recent protests, I don't even consider them as farmer protests now. \nI understood in the starting, the doubts regarding msp and well whenever a reform as such happens people are bound to be a little scared. Here the blame goes to the government for not being a good communicator, even if they did try it was very dhella dhalla, shouldn't the government be aware that these things blow out of proportion and now with Yogendra Yadav and his fellow people are going to block delhi even stopping essential commodities! It has become a national security threat. \n\nIf they want to protest, plz do but don't hurt the public and public property. You can do fasting to pressurise the government if you just want a yes or a no, which is so dumb either you tell the government these are the laws and bills you can bring and here's how the ones you brought won't work, one can understand.\n But a yes or no?! And nobody has any issues with the iPhone and bmw farmer's? Cause caste and super duper class privilege doesn't matter here, they must have earned that much shit ton of money by only hard work and not totally by crushing poor farmer's. \n\nAs much as I am angry at the usual suspects, I am furious at the government and it's handling,the so called nationalist media as well, can't you do one proper world class report/documentary of one hour or a series on this. Be honest and practice journalism but nahi hum tob studio mein bheite kar Chilayegein. \nThe government can't communicate for shit. Can't talk for shit. But this is the time to stand your ground.

But just to give a context to my post, \n\nTyagaraja Swamy was a renowned composer of Carnatic music, a form of Indian classical music. He was prolific and highly influential in the development of India\'s classical music tradition. Tyagaraja and his contemporaries, Shyama Shastri and Muthuswami Dikshitar, were regarded as the Trinity of Carnatic music. Tyagaraja composed thousands of devotional compositions, most in Telugu and in praise of Lord Rama, many of which remain popular today. Of special mention are five of his compositions called the Pancharatna Kritis (English: "five gems"), which are often sung in programs in his honour. \n\nEvery Year on his birth Anniversary there is a huge program in Tiruvallur in Tamil Nadu, they call it Tyagraja Aaradhana Ustsavams and it is a very big event for Carnatic singers and general Hindu populous of this nation. \n\nSo Tyagaraja Swamy used to do  **Uncha Vritti,** which is an ancient practice similar to bhikshatan except that the grihastha can do uncha Vritti whereas a sanyasi or a brahmachari can do bhikshatan.\n\nHe used to collect food grains and used them to perform the Sri Rama Aardhana on Rama Navami etc. and thus feed the people.\n\nNow here\'s the issue \n\n[https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/kamal-haasan-s-comment-on-tyagaraja-irks-carnatic-musicians-1675295-2020-05-07](https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/kamal-haasan-s-comment-on-tyagaraja-irks-carnatic-musicians-1675295-2020-05-07)\n\nThis moron kamal Haasan called Tyagaraja Swamy a beggar who sings about Rama. Normally I\'d brush such type of things aside because I know better. But this time they have crossed a line when I first heard about this news I wanted to do something so that these type of things don\'t go unpunished\n\nBut the time has come, we\'ll not let issues like this go very easily. \n\nFYI Kamal Haasan has made tons of money using the Hindu angle in his films, but once he has finished using that angle the actual colours come out.\n\nWhat do you think??'<br />Author: 'sprx7767'<br />id: 'k7aqil'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Butthurt OP</li>

The pandering is such a way that proud Muslim Aimim supporter will never see eye to eye with Rss supporter. While Congress culture was sitting and talking problem is it's hijacked into factions of pan Islamism and soft hindutva. \nAimim targets congress for Rss.  I feel Bjp needs a strong alliance .

<li>Title: 'Not only was repeal of APMC &amp; Essential Commodities Act in Cong 2019 Manifesto, but a look into what UPA installed Planning Commission had recommended over the years'<br />Body: 'CONGRESS\' HYPOCRISY ON FARM REFORMS\n\n&gt;In its 2019 manifesto, Congress promised to "repeal the Agricultural Produce Market Committee’s Act &amp; make trade in agri. produce-including export and inter-state trade-free from all restrictions"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335158208621514752\n\n&gt;Right before 2014 elections, Congress gvot asked Congress-led states to de-notify fruits &amp; vegetables from the APMC Act. In pursuance, Congress ruled states of Karnataka, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Meghalya &amp; Haryana de-notified Fruits &amp; Vegetables!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335158778623246336\n\n&gt;Did you know? UPA govt also formulated the Model APMC Rules 2007 for implementation of Model APMC Act. After coming to power in 2004, Congress-led UPA persuaded states to adopt the Model APMC Act 2003 to liberalize state agricultural marketing laws.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335159164654391297\n\n&gt;UPA constituted ‘Committee of State Min. In-charge of Agriculture Marketing to Promote Reforms’ under Harshvardhan Patil, Cooperation &amp; Parliamentary Affairs Minsiter in Maharashtra. In 2013 it proposed the following bill for barrier free markets:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335159625700687872\n\n&gt;The Planning Commission in its 2011 report also over mulled the policy option of enacting an “Inter-State Agriculture Produce Trade and Commerce Regulation Act” under entry 42 (Inter-State Trade and Commerce) of the Union list.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335160034091618304\n\n&gt;In April 2011, then Cabinet Secretary while considering the Note for COS suggested to promote Inter-State Trade &amp; Commerce of agriculture produce across States/UTs through the instrument of Central Legislation. Guess who was in power? Congress-led UPA!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335160345854283778\n\n&gt;In pursuance, DAC in consultation with Ministry of Law prepared draft Bill titled as “Agricultural Produce Inter State Trade &amp; Commerce (Development and Regulation) Bill 2012”. However, it was not pursued further. So Congress also wanted barrier free trade of agriculture produce.\n\n&gt;Contract farming has been recognized as a chief enabler in various reports of the Planning Commission &amp; has been implemented by several states under the State APMC Acts. The 11th Five Year Plan, 2007–12, released during the tenure of Congress-led UPA govt mentions:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335160907035410434\n\n&gt;Planning Commission report XII Five Year Plan 2012-17: “There\'s a need to promote both pvt invt &amp; alternative marketing channels to improve marketing system of agri produce by way of direct marketing contract farming &amp; setting up of markets in pvt &amp; co-op sectors, e-trading, etc“.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335161055299870721\n\n&gt;While discussing ‘Issues in Expanding Agricultural Marketing and Processing’, the 12th Five Year Plan  (2012-17) prepared by Planning Commission during UPA years advocates contract farming!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335161336716644353\n\n&gt;Haryana (2007, INC), Karnataka (2003, INC), Maharashtra (2006, INC-NCP), MP (2003, INC), Odisha (2006, BJD), &amp; others made provisions for contract farming under state APMC Act. Punjab (2013, SAD), Tamil Nadu (2019, AIADMK), Odisha (2020, BJD) passed separate Contract Farming Acts\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335161724320710656\n\n&gt;In 2019 Lok Sabha Elections Manifesto, Congress promised to replace the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 by an enabling law that can be invoked only in case of emergencies. The same reform, when bought by Modi is being opposed today!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335162145432952832\n\n&gt;Mid Term Appraisal of Eleventh Five Year Plan during UPA suggests reforming the \'archaic\' APMC Act &amp; abolishing the Essential Commodities Act to \'trigger private sector investment\'! Now when Modi brings it from paper to reality, Congress is opposing it!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335162624695103488\n\n&gt;UPA constituted ‘Committee of State Ministers, In-charge of Agriculture Marketing to Promote Reforms’ under chairmanship of Harshvardhan Patil, then Minister for Cooperation &amp; Parliamentary Affairs, Govt. of Maharashtra. In its 2013 report it spoke of Essential Commodities Act:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335162838080372747\n\n&gt;Planning Commission in its 2011 report also mentioned about the reduction of list of commodities from the purview of Essential Commodities Act &amp; recommended imposition of trade &amp; marketing restrictions only during the emergency. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335163084671909890\n\n&gt;Congress &amp; other anti-social forces have been vehemently opposing the pro-farmer reforms &amp; Congress’ current stand &amp; actions totally stand opposite of their past actions. It is clear that Congress is misleading public at large &amp; protesting only for the sake of opposing Modi!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335166201001984001'<br />Author: 'alubonda'<br />id: 'k79b9x'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: 'Who is provoking farmers?'<br />Body: "The way they are protesting it's clear that someone is provoking them as they are not ready to co-operate neither they want to listen anything that government is saying, punjab government can play an important role here but I don't think so they have such a potential to convince them. We have to think who is close to these farmers and who will be effected the most by this bill, according to my personal views the actual role players are the middle men they are the closest to the farmers and due to years of dealing they have a full control over farmers mind and if we see clearly they are the ones who will receive the highest possible loss as there will be a rise in pricing of buying. Now because government is not doing anything to counter these middle men as there complete focus is on congress this can be the reason why even after so much of cooperation by government they are failing to convince these farmers. No one is focusing on them... Maybe that's where the loophole is...\n( I am not sure how true my theory is but I want a positive discussion as a solution has more potential than just questions)"<br />Author: 'Deablose'<br />id: 'k78vkq'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li>
