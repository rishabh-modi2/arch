<li>Title: 'Some unpopular, unsolicited advice'<br />Body: "1. Respect Heroes, but don't engage in hero worship-\n    Sanatanis love simping over a brave hero like Shivaji, Maharana Pratap etc. but never ever make a person or a community larger than life. We did the same mistake with hailing Guru Gobind Singh and Ranjit Singh giving Sikhs the superiority complex. Every region, community saved itself and no one community or person is solely responsible for upholding Bhagwa Pataka. Bow your head only in front of Shri Ram Ji, Bhole Baba, Maa Bhavani not a mortal.\n\n2. Stop the cringy #IndialovesJews or #IndialovesJapan shit- No one is our friend except ourselves. Audrey Truschke is a Jew. Just because Jihadis hate them doesn't mean they are our friends.\n\n3. Men, please start working on physical fitness and women, please work on self defense, physical and mental strength:\n\nLately I've been seeing that Indian boys are becoming less masculine both by their body and mind. Maybe it's due to Indian parents' emphasis only on studies, but seeing sixteen year old Hindu boy screaming at a lizard and cockroach is not done. Now compare yourself to greenhouse boys who break tubelights on their heads during Moharram, who slit the throat of a goat when they're as young as 14. Now imagine if a situation comes when you both are facing each other, who'll win.\n\nAnd girls please stop thinking that riding a motorcycle is the only thing to make you strong. Learn to have a punch that can break teeth in one hit, learn to defend and learn to attack. Burkha clad women have attacked and killed many during riots. You should be at least able to save your brothers when the need comes.\n\n4. Economic boycott and economic biasedness is a thing. Learn to use it.\n\n5. Be unapologetic If anyone calls you regressive shit, own it with pride.\n\n6. Don't let TV dilute our gods: Prime examples Radhakrishna show, My friend Ganesha movies. Don't fall in their lure thinking them to be dharmic"<br />Author: 'dreamerimagine1'<br />id: 'q1wdlw'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Debunking the "hindu genocide in Bangladesh" claim by Indian right wing Hindu Nationalists.'<br />Body: 'Hi, I am a Bangladeshi, and I will be debunking the myth of "Hindu genocide" in Bangladesh \n\nRight wing Indian hindu nationalists on twitter and on the comment section of Indian channels claim that there is/was a "Hindu Genocide" and "ethnic cleansing of Hindus" in Bangladesh. Some of the comments are like [this](https://instagram.fdac13-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/e15/242579539_392067089196126_8791516978593213521_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fdac13-1.fna.fbcdn.net&amp;_nc_cat=106&amp;_nc_ohc=5Ggz9P6zcDUAX8Pp_2l&amp;edm=AJXOVykBAAAA&amp;ccb=7-4&amp;oh=d59b5e61da5321ca263c4bdf6ad12489&amp;oe=615FAAC4&amp;_nc_sid=9c1db7&amp;ig_cache_key=MjY2ODgyMTQ3NzY4MzM1NTY0Nw%3D%3D.2-ccb7-4). Their proof? The percentage of Hindus dropped from 22% in 1971 from 8% in 2011.\n\nNow notice, they only talk about the % not the *number* of Hindus in Bangladesh. If we look at the numbers of hindus in Bangladesh from 1951 to 2011, then it doesnt support their narrative.\n\nAccording to the [stats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism_in_Bangladesh#Demographics), there was roughly 9 million hindus in Bangladesh in 1951, and in 2011, there is roughly 13 million Hindus in Bangladesh. Now, if there was a "hindu genocide" or "ethnic cleansing of hindus" then how come the hindu population increased by 4 million within these 7 decades? This is a question that will stop the keyboards of indian fanatics on twitter.\n\nNow you may ask why did the % drop from 22% to 8%? The answer is pretty simple: Muslims have a higher birthrate than Hindus, thats why. There was no "ethnic cleansing" to reduce the Hindu population.\n\nNow I wouldnt care less about these people, but what is sickening and infuriating is that, Tulsi Gabbard, a very well known US politician, who was a Presidential nominee for the 2020 election, is also [buying this bullshit](https://www.tbsnews.net/feature/panorama/who-tulsi-gabbard-and-why-she-suddenly-interested-bangladesh-227020). She made a video on twitter, and re iterating the narrative of indian hindu nationalists that the % of hindus has dropped and therefore they are being persecuted. As usual, she did not bring up the *number* of Hindus in Bangladesh.\n\nThis is not surprising btw, cuz she herself is a right wing hindu nationalist as she has documented connection with RSS (according to the article I linked). But I dont think that she will be able to make an impact on the Bangladeshi hindu communities, cuz the US ambassador to BD [knows the genuine condition of Hindus in Bangladesh.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WeEXHX_JfE&amp;t=285s)\n\nUpodesh- Eishob right wing indian hindu nationalists der sathe online e torker joraben na. Tader sathe torko kore kono labh nai. Apni taderke kono bhabei convince korate parben na. Tai eder sathe torko kore shomoy nosto korben na.
