<li>Title: 'Hindu apologetic!'<br />Body: 'Hello guys! I\'m not a super practicing hindu, i go to holy sites rarely, and hardly i\'ve read religious scriptures.\nBut i wanted to let out my personal opinion on certain topics non-hindus use to brainwash hindu youngsters in order to brain waah them into self hatered.\n1. "If mohommad was a pedophile(he was 6 when he married aisha and did s‚Ç¨x with her when she was 9, his age was 54), then so was Lord ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ as he married godess sita when she was 7".\nSo, yes, godess was underage at the time of marriage, but so was lord ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ! He was 12 or something, after 14 years of vanvaas, lord lav and kush were born. So according to current era, things were legal. \nYou know even today in India, many families do certain marrige ceremony which is considered to be partial marriage/marriage, after marriage the bride gets to remain with her actual parents, and is sent to her inlaws only when she\'s an adult. \n2. " hinduism has awkward polygamy ". (anyways, the most perfect prophet had 11 wives with whom he\'d have sex on a single night but bath only once, +he had numerous underage sex slaves as well). \nSo., afaik we do not worship pandavas, they ended up in hell, it was taboo back then too, and they were bound by the promise to their mother. Apart from that, they ended up in ‡§®‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï except for ‡§Ø‡•Å‡§ß‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§†‡§ø‡§∞. \n3. Godess ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§§‡§æ had to give the "purity" test. \nI have herd various things on this matter, but, as an apologetic i\'d say, who sits in the throne, MATTERS, the prince MUST be blood heir to the king. Nature\'s rule. So pressure by the citizens of ‡§Ö‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ to lord ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ for godess ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§§‡§æ was VALID imo. \n I\'d say, lord ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ took extreme decisions in his life, but they were perfect. You must know when you have to choose your family, and when you have to choose the ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ú‡§æ, and HE DID, wo we worship him. \nIn the future i\'ll post some Quran texts as well, because you have to know them, as the one pointing fingers at you, has to be clean himself, and peacefuls "aren\'t" clean. \nSpread awareness, ‡§ß‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶!'<br />Author: 'queueue_ueueue'<br />id: 'j1aez8'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li>

<li>Title: 'Tax'<br />Body: "Modern Economics.  Your money is weight by supply and demand.  \n\nThink of tax as a way to remove money from a country. You pay tax to make money keep its current value.  \nThink of it as this way. Tax is a way to remove money from the system to keep inflation in check. The more Hands money goes though, the less valuable it becomes. When the same amount of money gets used by more people it artificially increases its quantity.  \nThis is why Tax is imposed on every goods thus whenever money is transferred from one hand to other its quantity decreases to keep up with its increase in use.  \n  \nQuite a head cracker.  \nlet me explain in the most layman terms.  \nSuppose a pack of lays cost **Rs 10 when the total amount of money in India is Rs100 and population of India is 6**.  \n\n1. Case 1 if no tax is levied.  \nlet's say that Government prints Rs 100 this year so the net amount of money is Rs200.  \nAnd the transfer of money is.  \nA(200)-&gt;B(200)-&gt;C(200)-&gt;D(200)-&gt;E(200)-&gt;F(200).  \n**Total usefulness is Rs 1200 and thus the price of lays next year would be Rs120**.    \n\n  \n2. Case 2 if a Rs 25 tax is imposed on every sale  \nA(200)-&gt;B(175)-&gt;C(150)-&gt;D(125)-&gt;E(100)-&gt;F(75).  \n**Total usefulness is Rs 825 and thus the price of lays next year would be Rs 82.5**.    \n\n  \n1. Case 3 if a Rs 25 tax is imposed and the population in India is increased 8.  \nA(200)-&gt;B(175)-&gt;C(150)-&gt;D(125)-&gt;E(100)-&gt;F(75)-&gt;G(50)-&gt;H(25).  \n**Total usefulness is Rs 900 and thus the price of lays next year would be Rs 90**.  \n\n\n1. Case 4 if a Rs 25 tax is imposed and people save Rs 25 in the bank, while the population of India is increased to 8.  \nA(200)-&gt;B(150)-&gt;C(100)-&gt;D(50)-&gt;E(0)-&gt;F(-50)-&gt;G(-100)-&gt;H(-150).   \n**Total Usefulness is Rs 200 and thus the price of Lays will remain Rs 10 next year** . Negative money is loans.    \n\n\n1.   Case 5 if a Rs 50 tax is imposed, while the population of India is increased to 8.  \nA(200)-&gt;B(150)-&gt;C(100)-&gt;D(50)-&gt;E(0)-&gt;F(-50)-&gt;G(-100)-&gt;H(-150).   \n**Total Usefulness is Rs 200 and thus the price of Lays will remain Rs 10 next year** . Negative money is loans. This is exactly why saving money gives you a discount on taxes.    \n\n\nHope you can get it now. Not having tax blooms inflation, having slight tax reduces it, Having a population increases cause inflation.  \nThus the government can either ask people to save money in a deposit or Increase tax to reduce money and keep the inflation in check.  \nI do not think I can simplify it more.  Government Does not use tax money to fund the budget. It prints as much money as needed and then has to find a way to remove it.  \nGovernment is printing money to take care of corona and stimulate the economy. They have to Increase tax and savings to get this money to remove before the inflation kicks in. \n\nYes, the government does not need your money to do works. It is the opposite, they give money so that you can work.  \n  \nWelcome to the 21st. \nI got a migraine."<br />Author: 'Rakesh1995'<br />id: 'j0v5zl'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li>

A white guy in my university tried to belittle Indians by callously stating that my english was "better than most Indians." I told him that my english was better than his, as I had learnt it from scratch. Moreover, most of us know at least three languages, while native English speakers confuse "should have" with "should of" to this day. \n\nSelf-loathing Indians liberals/ABCDs/commies can continue to hate themselves and propogate nonsense on the internet. That is beyond our control; however, that should not stop us from putting racist trash in its place. Be it racist Americans from backwater shitholes or Eurotrash, always be unapologetic in our defense.\n\nWe as a people are culturally and morally superior and we can be even better only if we focus inwards.

This essentially punishes south states who have TFR &lt; 2. Meanwhile UP will get double digit increase. Bihar and WB benefits from this too. \n\nThis makes south irrelevant in policy making with soo few seats and dont take them (us) for idiots. \n\nThe only way india will stay united: \n- Parliament for south Indian states, all laws passed by national Parliament must get approved inhere too. (Kashmir situation) \n- UP and bihar are exempted from delimitation. Bihar can be discussed and dilimited to a certain extent if necessary. \n\nWhat do you think guys?

Child labour basically.\n\nFirst mistake, I met Ram Kumar Ramamurthy, CEO of Gemini Communications Ltd. He was a LITERAL sanghi. Why? Because he had a pretty high position in this "RSS" thingy. He also donated money to establish a paatashaala (or gurukul) that forced innocent children to leave their education and to read age-old irrelevant texts like the Vedas. He forced me too to leave my non-vegetarian diet and now I am really sad because I can\'t convert back to the original. \n\nI met a HUGE group of bhakts, sanghis, Nazis, and islamophobic terrorists with sole purpose of uniting Indians. What a narrow-minded thought! What about Pakistanis? What about antarticans? And what about people from Jupiter? Can\'t they deserve to be unified? When will they realize that internationalism &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nationalism? Ok, coming to the actual point, let us see what they do in RSS. \n\nFirst - Prarthana. I don\'t think I have to say much, what can you say about the fact that an idiotic organization assumes everyone and everything to be theist and more importantly, "Hindu"? NOTHING.\n\nSecond - Games. First I thought their games will something like Running and catching where the runners would be labelled as Muslims and Catchers as Hindus, I was relieved THAT kind of cringe didn\'t happen. What happened was even more cringe - Mandala Kho-Kho. The same old stuff we did in school days, somehow they managed to make it even more boring! \n\nThird - rules and responsibilities. It would go like "Anand Ji, your thing for the week is to distribute CDs of Bharat Mata songs in the nearby streets. XYZ Ji, your job is to give some vegetarian food to the other streets". I slept off because I don\'t want to hear all NGO stuff. What matters to me is how beautifully they have managed to build a right-wing echo-chamber, shutting down all other thoughts that goes against their narrative and propaganda.\n\nAnd the saddest part of that? I came to know the name of the organization (RSS) only after coming to my house. I remember that day my liberal mom had a fight with my dad because he took me to RSS. I love my mom.\n\nConclusion: r/MudiBad\n\nSource: The book which is worshipped by Hindu Brahmin Males Only - Manusmriti'<br />Author: 'abhinavram2002'<br />id: 'ixiy8g'<br />Flair ::HighIQ: Randia Simulation</li>

I said I believe in god and not religion, and that I am not a part of the idiot brigade that posts shit on other religions. I removed the pic of us at Badrinath given by my girlfriend from my desk later that day because I realised that it made people think bad of me as a Hindu."*** \n\nThis randia post just made me lose it. Leftist media has been running our image through the ground and finally this autist realizes it, but he is stuck so deep in the narrative that he blames BJP and RSS for it. So the people in his country are getting the fake news from RSS? Or your dalaal media houses who don\'t give a shit about our image and will readily spread false propaganda for money?\n\nIf that retard has to remove his pic from Badrinath, maybe it\'s a problem with the people around him who are targeting him for his religion. But instead of exercising his right to practice his religion freely, this apologist asshole is hiding his religious identity, and of course it is because of Modi, cause that\'s all he has been taught.\n\nGuys I genuinely feel this is a big issue that needs to be handled. Some people are just falling deep into propaganda and can be bhagwapilled easily if approached correctly. People are gullible and will keep falling for any bullshit that they are fed. Reddit being a leftist shithole certainly doesn\'t help.

Most of us retained slave mentality to this day. \n\nWhen we hindu's make fun of Bangladesh, Vietnam,Turkey etc.. I can only pity how stupid one can be. These countries have better GDP percapta then us. They share the same colonial heritage, yet are hard workers and know the meaning of family planning.\n\nMuslim are respected because of numerous war heroes, what atrocities they did is secondary.

<li>Title: 'What are the 3 "controversial" Agri- reforms that were passed by the govt?'<br />Body: '**What are APMCs?** \n\nAfter Independence to overcome the vicious cycle of debt and exploitation of farmers at the hands of moneylenders/traders who controlled all the supply &amp; distribution of the agri produce, Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) were introduced by states.\n\n\nThese APMCs are managed by Market Committees (constituted by the state governments). \n\nA Market committee comprises of 15-20 members who were either elected/nominated by the govt (elections were very rare). \n\nPolitical parties like NCP dominate 80% of APMCs in Maharashtra. \n\n\nThe entire state is divided into market areas, and each area is under a market committee. \n\nOnce this is done, NO person or agency is allowed to freely carry out the wholesale marketing activities in the agriculture produce.\n\n\n**Licensing:** Market committees authorise commission agents/ traders to carry out procurement &amp; distribution activities through Mandis. \n\n**Thus, even after the abolishment of License Raj in 1991, it is still prevalent in the agricultural sector.**\n\n\nNot only this, APMCs charge license fee from warehousing agents, loading agents commission agents, etc. \n\nFee is also charged from both the seller (farmer who comes to sell) and the buyer (wholesaler).\n\n\nSome hidden charges also include legal fee, Mandi Tax, etc. \n\nLet‚Äôs say a farmer sells his produce like - potatoes to the APMCs for ‚Çπ10/Kg, he will first pay plethora of taxes to the agents, who in turn are going to charge similar set of taxes even from the wholesaler.\n\n\nThus, in the end, a common man pays ‚Çπ60/kg for potatoes, whereas the farmer takes home only a meagre sum, based on say, ‚Çπ5 per kilo (after taxes). Only the middleman is at profit. \n\nThe middleman here refers to agents of APMCs, who collect all the commissions. \n\n\nAlso, when a farmer sells his produce to the APMC Mandis, there is NO immediate payment. Rather, he has to wait for a couple of days before the amount gets credited to his account. \n\nThis means - a lag in payment and liquidity.\n\nAPMCs play a dual role of ‚Äúregulator‚Äù and a ‚Äúcontrolled market‚Äù. \n\nMost of the states even impose restrictions on the interstate selling and procurement of agricultural produce. Hence, barring market integration.\n\n\n**What are the "controversial" bills introduced to tackle this?**\n\nThe three bills introduced that are all set to bring a sea change in this sector are - \n\n1) **The Farmers‚Äô Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020**- The act ends the monopoly of APMCs to exclusively procure from the farmers.\n\n\nIt however has NOT ENDED THE FARMER‚Äôs choice to keep selling to APMCs if he gets good return. \n\nFarmers will now have a CHOICE to sell in the open market or keep selling to APMCs. \n\nThis act provides a level playing field to all sellers, hence paving way for a free market.\n\n2) **The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020**-\n\nTo ensure a fair treatment to farmers outside APMCs, this bill provides for price assurance &amp; trade agreement during sale/ purchase of farm produce through a written agreement.\n\n\n\n3) **The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020**-\n\nTo ensure free market mechanism, this act will remove cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onions, and potatoes from the list of essential commodities to prevent regulation in production, distribution &amp; movement.\n\n\nHowever, the government is still authorised to regulate the supply &amp; distribution of these commodities during emergencies.\n\nAPMCs in major states have only served few political goons for decades. Introduction of free market in agriculture is definitely going to produce some friction, but it is beneficial in the long run.'<br />Author: 'Set1Less'<br />id: 'iwdaof'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: "I (18 M) am fearing for my parent's lives. Please tell me what to do next."<br />Body: " \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpelling will be horrible, not a native speaker, so please excuse that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo months ago my grandmother, who had been mentally unstable for a few months, died in our home. My mother is a general physician and as she had died in our arms, she saw clear signs of kidney failure that caused septisemia. Grandma had already been diagnosed and treated for a kidney infection 2 years prior. However due to personal reasons, we didn't get her tested for covid post-mortem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past few weeks, my mom and dad have been very sick. Mother's pulse has been rising suddenly for a few days now, reaching the 100-150 range. Dad has been suffering from diarrohea, and some sort of gastroentitis problem. Me and my dad have a slightly strained relationship so I'm not very sure of his problems. Whatever I know is what I could muster from my mother. I have heard them discussing about the gall bladder, a bladder stone and removing the gall bladder.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday my mom confided in me that she has been having pain in her lower back, near her kidneys, just like my grandmother did before she passed away. She had a urine culture test done, which she says indicates a possible kidney infection and indirectly told me that whatever happened to grandma could happen to her too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom's pulse reached 150 a few days ago and dad rushed her to the hospital, but it had already reduced to a normal level by the time they left home. However, her pulse still rises to 100 nearly every day since. She says she's not feeling alright, but is not able to put it in words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey have done a few tests,but I'm of the view that they haven't done enough. I am not able to bring myself to ask them about the results, as I'll explain why. They visited the hospital twice and always came back with a much better mood, but their problems once again start the next morning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realize I'm not very clear with explaining their ailments, but this is all I know at the moment. It is not easy to discuss this at home without one of us breaking down. Dad already has been on the verge of tears many times when he thought me and my younger brother weren't looking. I'm fearing for their life and literally have no idea what to do. With all that's happened this year, my anxiety is through the roof and I'm extremely tensed. If any, any of you out there who has experienced or known someone who experienced these health problems, please advice and suggest me what to do now. I am clueless and in constant fear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my panic, I posted this in each and every sub that I thought would be helpful. Dad and Mom are trying to be as optimistic in front of me as possible, but even their facade is cracking. I have no idea why I'm reaching out to strangers who read this, but please, please, please- If you can be of any help, please do. It would mean the world right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;DR- My parents are both quite sick, but they aren't able to convey about it to me and neither I am able to ask about it to them. I only know the following key terms. Dad- gall bladder, bladder stone, diarrohea, endoscopy and gastroentitis. Mom- suddenlr rising pulse(reaching 150), lower back pain that is caused by(as a urine culture test indicates) kidney infection."<br />Author: 'marvel_fanboy_4ever'<br />id: 'iupogt'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: 'Dr Li-Meng, a Chinese researcher and whistleblower has published a paper explaining how SARS-CoV-2 was designed in a lab. Here is an ELI5 ‚¨áÔ∏è'<br />Body: 'Link to Dr Li-Meng et al\'s research paper: https://zenodo.org/record/4028830#.X1_G1mhKg2z\n\n\n**Summary**: She alleges that there is no way a wild bat coronavirus could evolve or mutate into the human-infecting strain that appeared in late 2019 naturally. The paper brings up a number of possible scenarios that were proposed (direct mutation, intermediary infection, etc.) and shows how they are not feasible, at least in a manner that produced what we see today. Covid-19 appeared out of the gate perfectly formed to infect human cells, and there\'s no way to explain that other than genetic engineering.\n\n\n**The genomes for COVID-19 and the coronaviruses ZC45 and ZCX21 are very similar.**\n\n1. COVID-19 (technically named, SARS-CoV-2) is a coronavirus. If you look at the NCBI database that shows the gene sequences of other coronavirus, it closely matches two related coronaviruses known as ZC45 and ZXC21. (Those particular viruses also happened to be discovered by Chinese researches in 2015.)\n\n2. Other bat-type coronaviruses are similar to COVID-19, but they come in at about 89% identical over the entire genome. ZC45/ZCX21, however, are in the range of 94%-100% identical to COVID-19, depending on the section you\'re looking at.\n\n**Like really, really, unusually similar...**\n\n3. There are two particularly interesting gene sequences to look at in COVID-19 and ZC45 (and ZXC21). They are the sections that code for the Orf8 protein and E protein...\n\n4. Orf8 exists in other coronaviruses, but the sequence will vary a lot between different types. If you look at all other coronaviruses, their Orf8 sequences match COVID-19 with a 58% correspondence. However, ZC45 matches COVID-19\'s Orf18 with a 94.2% correspondence. This is weird, because all the other data suggest that Orf8 is a sequence that just plays loosey-goosey between strains, but here we have an unnaturally close identicality. It\'s like catching two students cheating on a test because their written answers are so similarly worded.\n\n5. As for the E protein sequence, it mutates relatively quickly, meaning you\'ll find genomic differences even between close generations of the same virus. However, they\'ve found some COVID-19 E protein sequences that have a 100% match with ZC45./ZXC21. To put that in perspective, no other coronavirus has been observed with a 100% match to either COVID-19 or ZC45/ZXC21.\n\n**There\'s this other "natural" virus that supposedly matches COVID-19, but it seems like a fabrication to lead people away from ZC45/ZXC21**\n\n6. The virus is called RaTG13. It\'s supposed to be a 96% match to COVID-19. The reason why they think this is bullshit is because RaTG13 is supposed to be found in horseshoe bats but third party researchers found out that the sequence as described probably can\'t actually infect horseshoe bats.\n\n\n**Ok, so COVID-19 and ZC45/ZXC21 are nearly identical. What does that prove?**\n\n7. Given their nearly identical nature, two possibilities exist. COVID-19 naturally evolved from ZC45/ZXC21 or ZX45/ZXC21 was used as a template for COVID-19. But which possibility is it? It can\'t be evolution because...\n\n8. There\'s a protein in all coronaviruses known as Spike proteins. Spike proteins allow coronaviruses to "spear" the host cell and infect it.\n\n9. If you compare Spike proteins between COVID-19 and ZC45/ZXC21, they are very similar as expected...BUT they differ in one very significant way. There\'s one section that helps give COVID-19 the ability to infect humans instead of bats. This one section "coincidentally" looks a lot like the same section of the virus that caused the 2003\'s SARS epidemic.\n\n10. This one section could not have evolved naturally because if it did, you would expect to see other "evolutionary" changes around that section and throughout the whole protein. Instead what you\'re seeing is almost like a copy-and-paste. One part of the protein closely matches the ZC45/ZXC21 virus and the other part closely matches the SARS virus. It\'s like a bad photoshop where someone neglected to use the smudge and blur tool.\n\n11. There is another possibility this not-matching section just popped in through a natural gene swap (like trading Pokemon cards)...which does happen occasionally with viruses. But in order for that to happen, the two trading viruses need to infect the same host at the same time. This is impossible because SARS infects humans but ZC45/ZXC21 only infects bats. Pokemon cards thus cannot be swapped because the otakus aren\'t even in the same house.\n\n12. A final nail in this Spike protein coffin is that if you look at the beginning and end of the not-matching sequence, you find short sequences that happen to be "restrictions sites" that are commonly used in genetic engineering. (A restriction site is a genomic sequence that is easily cut through and pasted into using genetic engineering techniques.) While it\'s possible that these sites could just randomly be there, it\'s more than extremely unlikely and very suspicious.\n\n13. One last thing about the COVID-19 Spike protein is that there\'s a thing in it called a "furin-cleavage site". It\'s a little complicated, but basically, furin-cleavage sites don\'t exist in the particular line of coronaviruses that COVID-19 is associated with, and the ones that do exist are about 60% different from the furin-cleavage site in COVID-19\'s Spike protein. Basically, it\'s like COVID-19\'s furin-cleavage site came out of nowhere.\n\nTake home message: ZC45/ZXC21 appears to be the template that COVID-19 was based on. One particular sequence in COVID-19 appears to be copy-and-pasted from the 2003 SARS virus. It\'s nearly statistically impossible and equally illogical that COVID-19 could just randomly evolve a genome that happens to look like a patchwork copy of other viruses.\n\n\nPlease read the paper when you have time, it is very informative. They actually delineate a possible workflow through which you could derive COVID-19 from ZC45/ZXC21. At that point, it\'s like rubbing it in everyone\'s faces that this is exactly what happened and they\'re going to show how they did it.
