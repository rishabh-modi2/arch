There are so many issues where we can checkmate the Government but nobody is capitalizing on that. \n\nTake example of donation drive of Ayodhya Temple. Recently, President of India has donated Rs. 5 lakh. What is happening to the secular framework of our country? Why did everyone become silent? What happened to everyone? Had it been in any other functional democracy, the president would have resigned for his blatant Un-Secular Act.\n\nIt's just distressing to see the opposition so quiet and not willing to act against the Govt. I'm just baffled at the current state of affairs and have started wondering if everyone, including the opposition parties have become puppets of this ruling Govt and this whole acting like an opposition is just a scam to fool the public and the rest of the world to make them think that India is still a democracy. \n\nDon't they know that only Faftar Parties have to celebrated in Rastrapathi Bhavan?

The fresh and tender leaves on the trees look like tongues of fire; nights appear as dreadful as the night of final dissolution and the moon scorches like the sun. Beds of lotuses are like so many spears planted on the ground, while rain-clouds pour boiling oil as it were. Those that were friendly before, have now become tormenting; the cool, soft and fragrant breezes are now like the hissing serpent. One’s agony is assuaged to some extent even by speaking of it, but to whom shall I speak about it? For there is no one who will understand. The reality about the chord of love that binds you and me, dear, is known to my heart alone; and my heart ever abides with you.

<li>Title: "I really don't think i want Akhand Bharat. And i don't see why anyone else should."<br />Body: "Before you downvote, let me establish the fact that i do, with all my heart, want the reunification of Bharat. I want Indians to have _Indus_ otherwise whats the point. I want the Afghan mountains to mark our boundries once more. I want all of the lands watered by Ganga and Brahmaputra to be Indian again. I do want the whole Ram Setu from that end to ours. I do want Lanka, the land where God himself walked and battled King Ravana. So don't downvote thinking me as a Librandu or troll. Infact do upvote so more people can contribute.\n\nNow i am sure most of you all want the same things that i reiterated above. But theres one problem, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh are not mere lands..they _inhabited_ lands. Inhabited by the same people who found it all too easy to mutilate their own motherland in 1947. If such circumstances were to present themselves that we had the possibility of Akhand Bharat, that would mean addition of their mostly muslim population with ours. That would make India a country of over 600 millions. That is upwards of 60 crores. That'd put their population at around 43% of total population.\n\nWith less than 20 crores we have such many problems right now. Only this much are enough to plague us in our every step. Imagine what havoc that number three times over would raise. Also if by some miracle we managed to keep the country a democracy, We'd still be in troubling waters because Hindus are shit at uniting. As we all can see clearly. But muslims are radicalized and united in an instant. We can be sure that out of those 43% atleast 35%-37% will vote as a single block. With this much and a divided Hindu population (between centrists and others as we always are) it won't be long before an all muslim party comes in centre. How long do you think will it be before they go full islamic? Hindus are already sidelined and silenced, in this universe our situation would deteriorate a milliom times faster. Also with the breeding habits of the desert cult it will only be a few decades before they overpopulate us and the land of Chattrapati Shivaji, Rana Pratap and Guru Gobind would be proclaimed a Islamic nation. Aryavrat will be ruled by the wet dreams of desert Mlecchas.\n\nTo say it in short, Akhand Bharat, although  glorious and beautiful is not practical for the sustenance of Dharma. Atleast in the state Hindus are now. So untill we can think of either converting or shifting atleast 60% of their populations in the case of Akhand Bharat, it won't work. Would love to hear your opinions. And would love even more to be proven wrong here.\n\n_Tldr;_ Akhand Bharat has too many problems if implemented."<br />Author: 'ssc11'<br />id: 'kzb6on'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Do Shows like Tandav, Patal Lok, Welcome Home and General Hinduphobic content actually help us?'<br />Body: "I have been thinking about this point since the new Saif OTT Randirona show released. Though, it itself is said to be a garbage show even by leftist publications that agree with their politics, it does bring into question if they are accomplishing the exact opposite of what they're trying to achieve.\n\nWhenever such content is released, doesn't it prove a bias against Hindus exists in the media. I can't tell you how much these movies/shows have helped me realize that since I have been politically aware. A youtuber *Tried and Refused Productions* who is a leftist himself is now admitting in his reviews that the leftist agenda is becoming a little too much.\n\nSecondly, it provides us with endless ammunition to throw at our political opponents. Since they never question anything Islamic and only point against Hindus as some backwards barbarians, it becomes fundamentally clear that they are motivated by their hatred for us rather that anything else. Gems of Bollywood is getting really popular just for pointing things out.\n\nThirdly, the SSR fiasco has turned an incredible amount of normies against BollyDawood. The images of actors with Pakistani officials, Kashmiri separatists and their past deeds were all put into the forefront when the case was at its height and the anger amongst the general public still hasn't died down. That whole fiasco was a great radicalization against BollyDawood, and it continues to help us against them.\n\nSo does this media Jihad actually work in our favor? I myself was able to convince my cousin about it just by giving him examples of their absolute bias."<br />Author: 'HeuyLewis'<br />id: 'kz28dg'<br />Flair :DawoodWood (Entertainment) 🎥</li>

swastika**\n\n**the people there hated me a few agreed its a religiously important symbol**\n\n**as important as the cross is to them but let\'s just say the western people\'s little annoyance is more important than anything we have**\n\n**but his excuses of saying that it is not common in their area which I also proved wrong by googling Pennsylvania and showing him all the Hindu temples there**\n\n**he then argued that its a cultural thing and very hurtful to their eyes**\n\n**to which i reminded them its religious**\n\n**then he said its a minority**\n\n**so i showed him the population chart of India Sri Lanka china**\n\n**Pakistan Afghanistan**\n\n**Bangladesh barma**\n\n**Nepal Bhutan**\n\n**and Thailand**\n\n**which made him stop his rant for a bit**\n\n**and then he said he is going to eat beef and all**\n\n**to which i replied you can do whatever you want you are free**\n\n**let\'s just say facts outweigh their snowflakes so i was kicked from the group "**\n\nhello everyone it\'s a serious issue the western media will not show and highlight\n\nbut the swastika is a symbol that is not respected\n\na cartoon of Mohamad can cause terrorism and any words of symbols f Islam causes a lot of outage among them\n\nthe reason for Swastik being a hate symbol is well known\n\nHitler used it in hate speech\n\npropaganda flags and sybmols\n\nand to show jews are an inferior race\n\nhis hate didn\'t stop to those only his opinions of India were also not very nice using India as an example of a good colonization example and resource grab.\n\npresent-day racist who believes his ideology is called neo-nazis\n\nthere are people who will see a swastika and call you a nazi fascist and what not\n\nbut the origins of the symbols are very old older than these countries\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika)\n\nsee here\n\nthe sign has Eurasian origins and in some European countries it\'s used\n\nthe sign has been trained in the western world by one group\n\nnow you might say why am I ranting about it\n\nits 2 reasons one is\n\nI was called a nazi sympathizing crazy autistic person for posting a pic of my home temple area with a swastika on a picture\n\nthere is no respect for Hinduism and the older religions like Jainism Zoroastrianism\n\nSikhism and Buddhism\n\nwe are made fun of everywhere except Southpark which doesn\'t make fun of Hindus\n\nnow the site or organization that keeps track of all hate symbols and speech is called adl anti-defamation league which is a nonprofit Jewish organization notice the term Jewish\n\nso if a nonprofit is linked to any religion it will be biased\n\nthere are many differences between Hitler\'s swastika and the Hindu swastika that these people don\'t seem to see\n\n*Processing img bxdqdhmseub61...*\n\nlike the four dots being missing from his one\n\nhis choice of colors which are considered unauspicious here\n\nhis one is anti-clockwise as well\n\nwhich is also considered inauspicious.\n\non this site the pitbull which is a breed of dogs known for its face and aggressiveness\n\nthe person who said so many things has a pet pitbull and is white which is also a hate symbol\n\nbut he said how can a dog be a hate symbol so I showed him the Wikipedia page\n\nthe religious swastika\n\nthe cross should also be a hate symbol as\n\nmany regional religions have been destroyed by the crusade of colonization by the European empires\n\nmany millions of people were killed by the extreme torture slave labor and just wiping their face of planet earth the indigenous people of the Americas and Africa their culture was replaced\n\nwas that just for simple profit or the motive was getting more followers for their religions\n\nthey were considered unfit for civil society\n\nthey have become extinct the 2 people who hate jews most are Christians who hated them for killing Jesus which is their god\n\nand Muslims who hate them for not accepting their prophet as a messenger\n\nbut are their religious symbols part of this adl thing\n\nno, they are not .\n\ni feel this is not justified\n\ni am not saying that what happened to the jews was justified or what still happens to them\n\nbut the symbol has had a different meaning for ages and if one person misuses it doesn\'t mean we lose our independence to practice our religion\n\nyes we may be cringy and dance a lot but the hatred against this symbol is overwhelmingly ignorant\n\nand if everything becomes a hate symbol what will we use to communicate\n\nbelow is the link for all\n\nplease educate people about being less ignorant\n\nanother thing India has welcomed jews even before America was a thing so thats that\n\n[https://www.adl.org/](https://www.adl.org/)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_symbols\\_designated\\_by\\_the\\_Anti-Defamation\\_League\\_as\\_hate\\_symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_symbols_designated_by_the_Anti-Defamation_League_as_hate_symbols)'<br

On opening the email, I found that I have been offered the position of Associate Professor of Bakchodi at Harvard University, UK. Although, I know that neither Harvard has a Department of Bakchodi not Harvard is in UK, but the email id seemed so legit that I wholeheartedly beleived it to be true. \n\n\nThe faculty relations department at Harvard, UK has asked for 1 lakh rupees to process my Visa. I immediately used Google Pay to transfer the amount as they were kind enough to provide me their UPI ID for their Indian Bank account. \n\n\nThereafter, I received a call on Whatsapp where a lady asked me share an OTP (this was for verification of my phone number). I was suspicious of the Whatsapp call, but the lady on the call explained that as International calls are expensive, they have resorted to free Whatsapp calling. Another thing that made me suspicious was that the Whatsapp call was from an Indian number but the Australian accent of the lady totally assuaged my suspicions. Thereafter, I used my investigative bakchodi skills and found that the the DP was of a White girl. Now, I am totally convinced of the genuiness of the job process. \n\n\nI am so happy right now. I will be finally emigrating to a White majority country where I will have freedom to listen racial abuses, which has been my long time dream. \n\n\nPS: I have received multiple SMS from my bank showing large debits.

There are woke Hindus who are opposing the Love Jihad bill as well even though there have been in fact cases where this has happened. The same goes for Digvijay Singh. The guy had the audacity to blame the RSS for 26/11.\n\nSo my question is, what is the motive behind the things which these people do even when they know that they are acting against the interests of their own people? Why are doing it? Is it money, power, or indoctrination?'<br />Author: 'Meet_Me_In_Heaven'<br />id: 'kyd985'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: '“I Could Not Be Hindu: The Story Of A Dalit In The RSS”'<br />Body: 'The summary of the book \n\nAt the age of 13, Bhanwar Maghwanshi joined RSS. Instead of playing, learning and exploring, he opted to do something ‘bigger’ in his life. But, unfortunately, he was shocked to learn how RSS practices casteism without using the term ‘Dalit’ in its shakhas.\n\nHe was active with RSS, as a sevak, during the so-called Janmbhoomi movement of Ayodhya in the late 1980s. In his panchayat in Rajasthan, he never listened to azan or interacted with any Muslim – in person, but developed strong abhorrence for the Muslims when he was learning ‘skills’ in RSS.\n\nHis dad was a Congress activist and discouraged him to join RSS (because, for him, RSS would never want ‘brahmin’ sevaks to sacrifice their lives) but Bhanwar Meghwanshi – on a positive note – entered RSS.\n\nBhanwar’s ethnographic encounter in his book “I could not be Hindu – the story of a Dalit in the RSS” is essential to refute the pseudo-science of RSS or Hindutva trollers on the subjects of Islam, untouchability and other narratives. The book sheds a detailed light on what RSS is, casteism in the RSS, and how RSS makes its ground in the society.\n\nNavayana Publishing House mustered the courage to publish the book, unlike other ‘popular’ publishing houses, according to Bhanwar. He dreamt of becoming a ‘pracharak’ but was stopped to become a ‘vistarak’ because of his ‘caste’ and this is where he learned that he is a lesser Hindu than other Hindus in RSS.\n\nHe left RSS after a very bitter experience. He writes, “We had organised an event of Sangh in my hometown, I was heading the event as I was the most active and passionate worker in my area. I had planned to make food at my home only for the senior guests and the priests who would join the event. My father strongly opposed and said that they would never eat food cooked by us. I did not listen to him. I cooked good Rajasthani food with pure ghee and invited them. They did not come home but said that ‘you just pack the food we will eat it in the next village, as we are running out of time’. I packed the food for them, I later learned that they did not have my food but threw it in a naala (gutter). As the district chief, I got angry with them and asked the reason, but did not get satisfactory answers. I was reminded of my father’s words that ‘people like us did not own any place in the Sangh’, it solely belongs to the upper castes.”\n\nThe book smashes the rosy picture of RSS and explains that the Dalits’ role in RSS is mere foot soldiers for the communal polarisation and Hindutva activities. In an interview to Caravan magazine (14th March 2020), Bhanwar Meghwanshi made it clear that\xa0“In the eyes of the Sangh, the Hindu Rashtra is a Brahmin nation with the varna system, the four vedas and the Manusmriti. The Sangh wants to run the nation on this very base. I feel that in the Sangh’s Hindu Rashtra, shudras or untouchables will be slaves, and Muslims, heretics or foreigners, will be given a second-class status.”\n\nIn this memoir, Bhanwar also writes that in his village, low caste people joined the RSS in large numbers: “Of the fifty or so children who attended the shakha in my village, most were OBCs—Kumhar, Jat, Gurjar, Mali and so on.”\xa0They joined because of the Sanskritization processes and because of the games they played in the\xa0shakha, but they resided for ideological reasons too as, slowly, they learnt that “hindu khatre main hai” (Hindus are in danger) because of Muslims and Christians. He also recalls that, while in the Sangh, he “heard a lot about weapons being stored in the basements of mosques” and that getting rid of the Babri Masjid was like “a second battle for independence”.\n\n\nBhanwar is not new in this race. A sarcastic letter authored by a Dalit activist P.D. Shelare, on 13/1/1934, published in ‘Janata’ divulged about casteism or caste segregation practices in some\xa0shakhas\xa0of RSS. Shelare ratiocinated that RSS was aware of the practices but it did not react.\n\nI Left Hinduism In 2018\n\nIt’s obvious to learn that Hinduism is incomplete without\xa0casteism. The caste practices made me leave Hinduism too, on 30th December 2018. I\xa0adopted\xa0Buddhism, on par with Dr Ambedkar’s\xa0teachings. While reading the book, I could resonate my experiences too. In the current landscape, interactions and social relations have changed a lot. Caste dynamics too.\n\nTo add to the woes, love jihad law will further strengthen more endogamy and discourage intercaste marriages. Dining with Dalits alone would not bring about social changes. The ‘safe space’ for the dissents and Dalits is diminishing, whereas love for hatred is openly normalized.\n\n\nIf this is true , how an OBC leader Modi became prime minister of India ?'<br />Author: 'lucifersci'<br />id: 'ky8q3j'<br />Flair ::oc-: OC है BC!💡</li>

Tolerant societies need to be intolerant of intolerance to preserve tolerance.\n\nAnd if this comment gets me banned again, not an issue.

The takeaway, the lesson, let\'s recount it together. But some history first-\n\n*The year is 1818*\n\nA Christian priest,  British Baptist minister, missionary, abolitionist and Harvard professor named William Adam, after taking his inspiration from churchman Thomas Chalmer  decided to venture into India.\n\n With the help of American friends, Adam sent his family and left himself years later in 1838. There he met abolitionists and his background qualified him to be sent by the Americans as their representative to the anti-slavery meeting in London of the [British India Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_India_Society&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1).\n\nBoston East Indian merchants were so impressed by his linguistic skills that they arranged for his to be made a Professor of Oriental Linguistics at [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University), but by 1840 he was publishing public letters to [Thomas Fowell Buxton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fowell_Buxton) warning of British complacency of assuming that because the West Indies no longer had slavery it did not mean that the British Empire had renounced slavery whilst India was unchanged.\n\n In 1840, Adam was sent with a large number of other Americans to the [World\'s Anti-Slavery Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_Anti-Slavery_Convention) in London, where he presented a paper about India. After the convention was completed the more notable people were recorded in a large painting for the [Anti-Slavery Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Slavery_International)  .\n\n Reputedly they had been voted from the floor by clergyman who were generally not from the Church of England. In protest the four men took up seats with the sidelined women delegates. Adam said at the convention "If women had no right there, he had none, his credentials were from the same persons and the same society." \n\n Later after many discussions on Christianity and Indian thoughts on God, he found himself unable to resolve the doubts on Jesus Doctrines and logically felt defeated. (The life and letters of Raja Rammohun Roy by Collet, Sophia Dobson, 1822-1894, Page-68)\n\nAdam lost interest in the Baptist Mission, but not India, and with Roy and a mix of locals and Europeans formed the Calcutta Unitarian Society. The society ended in an unusual way when the Hindu membership became interested in the emerging ideas of [Brahmo Somaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmo_Somaj). In 1830,Adams was appointed by the colonial government of Bengal to carry out a census and analysis of native education in Bengal.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Adam_(minister)#cite_note-2)\n\nAnd it is this venture of his into India, while carrying out the analysis and census is what we\'re going to talk about-\n\n Following his investigations that lasted over two years (1836-8), William Adam submitted three reports which “remain to this day an extremely important source of information regarding the state of indigenous education in early nineteenth century Bengal. \\[2\\] Four editions of [Adam’s work,](https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.135582/2015.135582.Reports-On-The-State-Of-Education-In-Bengal1835-38_djvu.txt) including the original reports that were submitted to the government from 1835-38, have been published at various junctures of time. \n\n Adam’s first report was based on a preliminary investigation and a review of pre-existing materials. It is the second and third reports of Adam that contain the results of his fieldwork and reveal a great deal of information. In his second report (which pertains to the district of Rajshahi in Bengal), Adam reveals that every native school has but one teacher. Adam’s second report also informs us about the number of pupils, the usual age of admission as well as of leaving school, the medium of instruction, the curriculum, the school building and the remuneration of the teacher as well as the teacher’s name, caste and age.\\[4\\] Adam’s third report pertained to three districts of Bengal (Burdwan, Beerbhoom and Moorshedabad) and two districts of Bihar (Tirhoot and South Bihar). This report reveals for each district, the number of schools categorised according to the medium of instruction. \\[5\\] It is beyond the scope of this article to list all of the statistics compiled by Adam. So, we will only highlight the most noteworthy points that will help us get a fair idea of the state of education in those days. \n\n Let us look at some numbers to begin with. **In his first report, Adam observed that almost every village had a school. So, there were more than 100,000 village schools in Bengal and Bihar and there was a village school for every 400 persons. \\[6\\]**\xa0Adam’s subsequent investigations looked at different kinds of schools in specific districts. For instance, his second report reveals that the district of South Bihar had a total of 286 Hindi schools in which 3,090 scholars received instruction. \\[7\\] \n\n(Let that sink in for a second, a 100,000 rural Gurukuls in the two states combined, let that sink in, because the same two states today lag behind and have less than that much no. of rural education institutions today, about 15%(or more) of rural areas in these 2 states till date still lack proper schooling facilities as per MHRD and RMD data from 2018) Moving on....\n\n**William Adam and "*****Brahminical Hegemony"*** **in the past**\n\n Adam’s reports also give information about the social composition of students and teachers of indigenous elementary schools.It is interesting to note that these reports contradict the modern notion of Brahminical hegemony. \n\n Much ink has been spilled on the hegemony of Brahmins in indigenous institutions and the inaccessibility of education for the socially backward classes. \\[8\\] But Adam (like his counterparts in the Madras Presidency) found that a significant percentage of students belonged to low castes such as *Malo, Chandal, Kahar, Luniar, Dhoba* and *Kalu*.  \n\n \\[9\\] These castes were also found to be well represented amongst the teachers of elementary schools, the majority of whom were non-Brahmins. For instance, Adam observed that in the district of South Bihar vernacular instruction was *“almost wholly in the hands of the Kayastha or writer caste, and that the institutions of the country are still in this respect in almost unabated force. There are no brahman-teachers.”* \n\n \\[10\\]\xa0**There is now a vast body of evidence in the form of colonial surveys indicating that nearly all sections of pre-colonial Indian society enjoyed comfortable access to mass elementary education.** \n\nSo much for the "Brahminical Patriarchy down-down",right?\n\nQualitative aspect-\n\n Adam found that a scholar typically went through four stages of instruction during the course of his studies in a Bengali *patshala*.\\[12\\] Amongst the textbooks taught in Bengali schools, the *Subhankar* was found by Adam to be commonly used for basic arithmetic. Elementary grammar was taught through books such as *Sabda Subanta* and *Ashta Sabdi.* In addition, the Sanskrit verses of *Chanakya* (a book on statecraft and general principles by the ancient philosopher named Chanakya who lived between 371 and 283 B.C.) containing pithy maxims and general precepts of morality were read and memorized. Other general instruction included compositions in praise of various gods and goddesses such as *Data Karna* (on the altruistic nature of Karna, a hero in the *Mahabharata*), *Ram Janma* (on the birth of Lord Ram), *Ganga Bandana* (on the qualities of the river Ganges) etc. as well as extracts from religious epics such as the *Sundar Kand* of the *Ramayana,* or the *Adi Parva* of the *Mahabharata* etc. \\[13\\] \n\nHence it will not be wrong to conclude that the Gurukul system was what kept Pre-colonial India well rooted for its culture and the youth was not left astray.\n\nAs a matter of fact, contradicting the "Brahminical hegemonical" narrative that the left/liberals like to spit out like air everywhere, in all of the provinces that Adam surveyed, the lower caste students in Gurukuls, outnumbered the "upper-castes" by a ratio of almost 2:1 and even greater than 3:1 in some provinces.\n\nAll this while, Adam, while on his survey didn\'t encounter a single child who wasn\'t familiar with basic arithmetic, not a single person who he could call iliterate.\n\nEventually the same Gurukul system that kept us well connected to our roots and united as a society was chopped down by the English Education Act, 1835 but that\'s a story for another time.\n\nTherefore, after understanding the takeaways from the history we just dwelled into, I would like you all to come back to the first two *slokas* that I cited at the beginning, both verses are from the Manusmriti, the same code of law that haunts the left/liberal brigade like their worst nightmare, they keep quoting one single verse to try and establish the text as casteist, but the fact remains that all they can do is nitpick, because the slokas I cited indicate otherwise  hence demolishing their narrative of the solid nature of caste, I assert, again here that caste was not something solid, birth based, it only became so after the EEA,\'35 was passed and everyone was told to get their castes put down on paper and the same narrative and law continues till date in the form of colonial hangover because many other colonial surveys like Adam and Monroe clearly establish the difference between the caste and the Varna system.\n\nFurthermore, if a 3000 year old code of law/jurisprudence (dated as assigned by  Sir William Jones and Karl Wilhelm, Friedrich Schlegel)  indicates that the Varna system was fluid and it was possible for a *Sudra* to turn into a *Brahmin* by being learned and then carrying on the family legacy as a *Brahmin* itself then no modern narrative or bashing is enough to break this hard truth down. Yes, there were and have always been once-in-a-blue-moon precedences of discrimination, but most of the evidences,foreign accounts of India and surveys indicate otherwise, and the fact that Ancient India as a society lacked caste discrimination seems clear, no matter how many Guhas and Thapars keep shouting, the truth won\'t change this solid fact.\n\nWhat\'s to be noted here is that endogamy among Varna lines and Exogamy among Gotra lines was still persistent since the last 2000 years and should be excluded from what I stated above, in addition, Marriage restrictions across communities are something debatable and I see Varna endogamy (&amp; Gotra based exogamy, because Hinduism prohibits inbreeding) as purely a means established to maintain the stability of our gene pool intact as a community over time.\n\nSo on a concluding note, I would say, that it\'s a plot of the left/liberals to make us demolish our Varna identity with our own hands, [the first stage of subversion has already set in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9TviIuXPSE), and many Hindus have fallen prey to it, don\'t let them tell you otherwise because on their face is a smile, on their lips is a slogan but in their hearts is pure hatred for you and your identity, because when they couldn\'t win, they found their punching bags in the Brahmins/Kshtriya community and invented a hegemonical oppression narrative. Because then again, what is the left without the word "Oppression" in their dictionary and a victim card instead of an Aadhar?\n\nWhat I would like to end with is, let\'s unite as one, as Hindus,but also embrace our glorious past, and do not let go of your identity, if you\'re a Brahmin, say Jai Parshuram proudly, if you\'re a Kshtriya, hail Pratap, Vaishyas,your money still controls most of the modern world today,because what would we be without businessmen? And my *Sudra* mates,remember, the father of our constitution was one of you, a man who, by the way was also an unapologetic Hindu,a very proud one indeed and so is our President today.\n\nEmbrace your identities, embrace the blood of your ancestors and we shall emerge brighter, and don\'t let anyone tell you otherwise and that your identity is regressive, because they aren\'t anything but a wolf in sheep\'s clothing waiting to pounce on you and your ideals, because once you and I, my Hindu Friend let go of our identity and pride for our bloodline, we will not have a shield, a sense of belongingness and commune for each other anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*May Dharma prevail for eternity!*\n\n*Hare Krishna!*\n\n*Jai Parshuram!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources and References**\n\n1.

<li>Title: 'A really important message to the youth of India for protecting democracy.'<br />Body: 'History always repeats itself. Studying history is one way to predict the future accurately. I have studied the fall of the Soviet Union really well. Currently, the USA is on its way to becoming a communist state. How do I know this? The majority of the youth in the USA are communists now. It won\'t happen overnight but it will happen eventually, it may take some years if not decades. Free speech is the mechanism by which we keep our society functioning. We have to be able to say what we have to say badly. I have studied totalitarianism for a long time and I know how it starts, it always starts with restrictions on freedom of speech. We can already see these restrictions being implemented in the USA. You can\'t even lift the national flag of your country in public anymore in America without being called a Nazi, white supremacist, etc.\n\nIt\'s best to learn from others\' failures then fail and see them for yourself. That is why I am taking the example of the USA and relating it to our country so we can avoid the same mistake they made.\n\nHow did a superpower like the USA, which made the world safe for democracy ended up like this? I don\'t have any proof to say this but I think some communist countries planned the implosion of the USA by corrupting the youth. Universities in America are very left-leaning. I watched a video of this American dude, who studied in an Ivy League college talked about how all the universities would be teaching crazy politically biased stuff, all of it anti-American, and students believed them and followed their professor\'s knowledge blindly. Barely anyone opposed what was being taught. People who agreed with what was being taught were very vocal and eventually, they became the majority because conservatives never opened their mouths because they risked being hated for what they believe in. Some years later, Free speech in universities was dead. You\'d be labelled something you are not if you didn\'t have the same opinion as them. Now, free speech in the entire country is dying. Finally, these conservatives realized that they need to say something but it was too late. I don\'t want my country to land in the same situation in the future.\n\n"Who controls the media, controls the masses." We can see a live example of this:- Facebook, Twitter, Google, Amazon erasing Parker app from the internet because it promoted freedom of speech. See how the "India" subreddit literally bans anybody with opposing beliefs. That is exactly what we want to avoid. I won\'t be surprised if some non-Indian is running that sub. I really don\'t want my country to land in the same situation as the USA.\n\nSo what do I suggest? Be vocal about what you believe in. Express your opinions whenever required. Also, let people with opposing views talk. Don\'t hate on them for having that belief, I say respect them for having that opinion. Hear them out and tell them what you think, that\'s how one can reach a final conclusion. EVERYBODY TALK. Don\'t be ashamed to tell your friends if you support Modi or Rahul and state your reasons for that. Don\'t be afraid to be called a Hindi nationalist or liberandu. That way, at least you wouldn\'t be called a coward.\n\nOur right for freedom is speech is what makes Democracy amazing. Use that right.'<br />Author: 'Iworkhard7'<br />id: 'kxnl98'<br />Flair :National 📰</li>

I have been getting a lot of letters from aware daughters from across the country asking for an early decision on the matter. They ask why has the committee’s report not come yet. I assure all those daughters that very soon the report will come and as soon as that happens, the government will study it and work on its recommendations,” he said.\n\nCommittee led by Jaya Jaitly giving final touches to report\n\nThe PM’s remarks came during his speech at the release of a commemorative coin to mark 75 years of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, where he spoke on the government adopting an “integrated and multidimensional approach” to tackle the problem of malnutrition. TOI has learnt that the committee headed by Jaya Jaitly is giving final touches to the report. The task force constituted in June was to originally give its report by July 31. The committee was formed after an announcement by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Union budget for 2020-21.\n\nhttps://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-45522,msid-78714734/78714734.jpg\n\n\nThe task force has the mandate to examine matters pertaining to age of motherhood, imperatives of lowering maternal mortality rate, improvement of nutritional levels and related issues. It will also suggest suitable legislations or amendments in existing laws and a detailed rollout plan with timelines to implement these recommendations.\nOn August 15, in his speech from the Red Fort, the PM said a decision on “what should be the right age of marriage for girls” would be taken as soon as a committee set up to study the issue gave its report. As of now, the legal age of marriage is 18 years for girls and 21 years for boys. The age of marriage has been a point of debate for long with some civil society organisations opposing the move to raise the age of marriage.'<br />Author: 'CholiMein'<br />id: 'kx0yj9'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'We all know what is happening in the Mewat region to the minority Hindus. I found a really interesting article about it which I would like to share with you all. Sharing the original article too in the comments. Please do read this article. It explains why these things are happening in Mewat'<br />Body: '\xa0Nuh is different from the rest of Haryana because of its religious demography. While Muslims constitute 7.06 per cent of the State’s population (as per Census, 2011), they constitute 75 per cent of the district. As per the 1971 census, the Muslims constituted 62 per cent of the population in the five tehsils that now form Nuh. This reversal of the majority-minority relationship has had its consequences, particularly in the polarised context prevailing in the rest of the country. That’s why Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar declared that his Government would bring a law against forced conversions and set up a board to protect Hindu properties.\n\nThe Mewat district was renamed as Nuh in 2016. Earlier in 2001, Mewat (1,507 sq km) was carved out from Gurgaon district. Nuh has been in the news for the wrong reasons. Mewati gangs are notorious for **cattle smuggling, automobile thefts and highway robberies**. Jails in Gurugram and Faridabad districts have a disproportionate number of Mewati inmates. **Terror suspects have been arrested from Nuh**. There have been reports of communal disturbances.\n\nYet things need not have played out like this. The Meo Muslims were a different lot; they were more or less Hindu in custom and culture until the beginning of the 20th century. Their syncretism could have been an example for the rest of the Muslims of the subcontinent. Major Percy William Powlett wrote about the Meos of Alwar (then a princely State) in Alwar Gazetteer (1878). He said: “The Meos are half-Hindu by their habits. Mosques are rarely to be seen in their villages. There are only eight mosques in the 50 villages of the tehsil of Tijarah. Leaving aside the temples, the places of worship of the Meos are very much similar to those of Hindu neighbours. They are known, for instance, as Paanch Peera, Baisa and Chahand.”\n\nMewat, as a historical region, extends into Alwar and Bharatpur districts of Rajasthan and Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh beyond its heartland, that is Nuh. One has to cross the region while going to either Agra or Jaipur from Delhi. It lies at the heart of the “golden triangle” tourist circuit comprising Delhi, Agra and Jaipur.\n\nIt is barely known to the outsiders how this region, merely 70-80 km away from Delhi, acted as the laboratory of Islamic alienation over the last century. Maulana Mohammad Ilyas (1885-1944), who started the itinerant Tabligh movement (Tablighi Jama’at), chose Mewat as its nursery in the 1920s. The movement has been run from its headquarters in the Banglewali Masjid in the Nizamuddin area of Delhi. Since Maulana Ilyas was a product of Dar-ul-Uloom at Deoband (in fact, a pet student of its co-founder Ahmed Rashid Gangohi), the imprint of its orthodoxy is evident in the Tabligh movement.\n\nTabligh is an outreach movement by Muslim missionaries to take authentic Islam to the doorsteps of the believers. It encourages nominal Muslims (Momin) to become true Muslims (Ihsaan/Muhsin). The process involves disavowal of all “Kafiresque” (that is not sanctioned by Islam) practices, which might be the legacy of the pre-Islamic past. The recital of six Kalimas (six verses of Quran) and performing namaaz form the foundation of Tablighi practices. The six Kalimas are avowals that there is “no God but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.” The sixth Kalima is especially a rejection of disbelief and polytheism. The Kalimas constitute disavowal of associating Allah with any other divine authority. Naturally, syncretism is not merely out of place, but sinful, to be practised alongside Islam.\n\nWay back in 1970, Hashim Amir Ali, Director, Rural Institute, Jamia Millia Islamia, had, by examining the features of the movement, stated that the “institution of Tabligh has begun to blow a wind of change for the worse in the hitherto tranquil and uniquely syncretic culture of the Meos” (The Meos of Mewat: Old Neighbours of New Delhi, P.41). Ali feared that orthodoxy, championed by Tabligh, would be ruinous for the economic life of the Meos. The religious injunction against interest might discourage them from accepting loans from banks, opening bank accounts or even joining cooperative societies. It might be remembered that Dar-ul-Uloom at Deoband has pronounced several fatwas against any kind of borrowing/lending which involves payment of interest. It is high time that fresh sociological studies are undertaken to ascertain how far the Islamic prohibitions on certain issues (like interest on lending/borrowing and family planning methods) have kept the Muslim community backward and impoverished.\n\nThe result of the Tabligh movement manifested during the tumultuous times of 1946-47 when a popular demand for a **separate “Meostan” was raised**. Interestingly, it was pitched by the **Communist leader Kunwar Mohammed Ashraf**. Its boundaries were envisaged as extending from Mehrauli in Delhi to Bandikui in Dausa district of Rajasthan. The Meos of Alwar and Bharatpur had formed the Rajputana Muslim League. One of its sections was determined to achieve Meostan, envisaged as adjacent to Pakistan, by the power of guns. This naturally culminated in a riotous situation where Meos suffered heavy losses due to the Hindu backlash. Narayan Bhaskar Khare, the Congressman who was then the Dewan of the Alwar State, had described the situation in detail in his memoirs (My Political Memoirs or Autobiography, 1959).\n\nHowever, Lord Mountbatten’s Partition declaration, dated June 3, 1947, which stipulated the division of both Punjab and Bengal, knocked out the plan for a Meostan. **Beleaguered, a large number of Meos fled to Pakistan but only to be invited back to India by the Jawaharlal Nehru Government**. **Stopping them from migrating to Pakistan also became an article of faith for Mahatma Gandhi**. Khare, therefore, was not certain that permanent peace had returned to Mewat. He was apprehensive that communalism could still rear its ugly head. Time has vindicated Khare as the discontent continues to simmer.'<br />Author: 'Meet_Me_In_Heaven'<br />id: 'kwztk1'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

How many you can find in your circle?'<br />Body: '**What/Who is a Dhimmi?**\n\nSee later if you do not know what this term means.\n\nThis video shows some examples that Hindus/Jains/Buddhists still do that are reminiscent of Dhimmitude.\n\n\n\n**Example 1 (When someone posts something on social media):**\n\nhttp://streamable.com/qedeh9 \n\n\n\n**Example 2 (something we see in society) :**\n\nhttps://streamable.com/tjeghh \n\n\n**Example 3:**\n\nhttps://streamable.com/pg1swg\n\n\n\n**What/Who is a Dhimmi?**\n\nFor people who are unaware of what is Dhimmi (called Jimmi in Hindi). Generally, it refers to Jews or Christians living in Muslim-majority countries. They are given choice of death or Islam. However, if they pay tax "(called jizya, they can live). In India, it was extended to Hindus/Jains/Buddhists as well.\n\nIt is not just about the tax but certain restrictions that come with it. For e.g.\n\nan integral aspect of the dhimma was that, being an infidel, he had to openly acknowledge the superiority of the true believer--the Muslim.\n\nThe "tribute" (or jizya), paid as a yearly poll tax, symbolized the subordination of the dhimmi. Later, the inferior status of Dhimmis was reinforced through a series of regulations that governed the behavior. Dhimmis, on pain of death, were forbidden to mock or criticize the Koran, Islam or Muhammad, to proselytize among Muslims or to touch a Muslim woman (though a Muslim man could take a non\xadMuslim as a wife).\n\nDhimmis were excluded from public office and armed service, and were forbidden to bear arms. \n\nThey were not allowed to ride horses or camels, to build synagogues or churches taller than mosques, to construct houses higher than those of Muslims or to drink wine in public. \n\nThey were not allowed to pray or mourn in loud voices-as that might offend the Muslims. \n\nThe dhimmi had to show public deference toward Muslims-always yielding them the center of the road. \n\nThe dhimmi was not allowed to give evidence in court against a Muslim, and his oath was unacceptable in an Islamic court. To defend himself, the dhimmi would have to purchase Muslim witnesses at great expense. This left the dhimmi with little legal recourse when harmed by a Muslim.\n\nDhimmis were also forced to wear distinctive clothing. In the ninth century, for example, Baghdad\'s Caliph al-Mutawakkil designated a yellow badge for Jews, setting a precedent that would be followed centuries later in Nazi Germany.'<br />Author: 'pyaarkiaag'<br />id: 'kwefno'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>

<li>Title: '"It is for YOU to thank ME" - Swami Vivekananda, after John D. Rockefeller\'s large public donation on his suggestion'<br />Body: 'John D. Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil, and legendary miser, turned into one of the world\'s biggest philanthropist later in his life. His first meeting with Swami Vivekananda in 1894 (Swamiji\'s Chicago speech was in Sept. 1893) went as follows:\n\nhttps://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_9/Conversations_and_Interviews\n\n----\n\nFIRST MEETING WITH JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER\n(An excerpt from Madame Verdier’s journal quoted in the New Discoveries, Vol. 1, pp. 487-88.)\n\n[As told by Madame Emma Calvé‚ to Madame Drinette Verdier]\n\nMr. X, in whose home Swamiji was staying in Chicago, was a partner or an associate in some business with John D. Rockefeller. Many times John D. heard his friends talking about this extraordinary and wonderful Hindu monk who was staying with them, and many times he had been invited to meet Swamiji but, for one reason or another, always refused. At that time Rockefeller was not yet at the peak of his fortune, but was already powerful and strong-willed, very difficult to handle and a hard man to advise.\n\nBut one day, although he did not want to meet Swamiji, he was pushed to it by an impulse and went directly to the house of his friends, brushing aside the butler who opened the door and saying that he wanted to see the Hindu monk.\n\nThe butler ushered him into the living room, and, not waiting to be announced, Rockefeller entered into Swamiji\'s adjoining study and was much surprised, I presume, to see Swamiji behind his writing table not even lifting his eyes to see who had entered.\n\nAfter a while, as with Calvé, Swamiji told Rockefeller much of his past that was not known to any but himself, and made him understand that the money he had already accumulated was not his, that he was only a channel and that his duty was to do good to the world — that God had given him all his wealth in order that he might have an opportunity to help and do good to people.\n\nRockefeller was annoyed that anyone dared to talk to him that way and tell him what to do. He left the room in irritation, not even saying goodbye. But about a week after, again without being announced, he entered Swamiji\'s study and, finding him the same as before, threw on his desk a paper which told of his plans to donate an enormous sum of money toward the financing of a public institution.\n\n"Well, there you are", he said. "You must be satisfied now, and you can thank me for it."\n\nSwamiji didn\'t even lift his eyes, did not move. Then taking the paper, he quietly read it, saying: **"It is for you to thank me"**. That was all. This was Rockefeller\'s first large donation to the public welfare. \n\n----'<br />Author: 'Librandu_Lefticle'<br />id: 'kw4kgb'<br />Flair :Viraat Sanatani🚩</li>

<li>Title: 'An accident of history:'<br />Body: 'In the year 1920, two books were distributed from all the mosques of India. One book was named "Krishna Teri Geeta Jalani Padegi" &amp; the second book was titled "Nineteenth-Century Lustful Maharishi" \n\nBoth books were "anonymous" There was no author or publisher\'s name, and both these books r very vulgar, extremely abusive things were written on Lord Shri Krishna, Hinduism, etc. And in these books very obscene sketches of various deities were also made. \n\nAnd slowly, both these books started being distributed from every mosque in India. When this matter reached Gandhi, Gandhi made it secondary by saying that "freedom of expression", and said that everyone in India has the right to speak.  \n\nBut with both of these books, India\'s public was boiling a lot. Then in 1923, "Mahasaya Rajpal Ji", the owner of Lahore-based "Rajpal Publishers", published a book called "Rangeela Rasool"The author of that book was named a secret and in place of the author it was written "milk of milk, and water of water"  Although the real author of that book was Pandit Champupati, a well-known scholar of Islam. And the best part was that there was no lie in that book.  \n\nBut with all the evidence, many things were written, giving the rectangle number, hadith number, etc.  "Rangeela Rasool" was sold all over India for one and a half years!  Somewhere, there is no ruckus. But one day suddenly on 24 May 1924.  \n\nGandhi, in his newspaper "Young India", by writing a long article, strongly condemned the book "Rangeela Rasool", and finally wrote 03 lines like this:  "Muslims should punish those who write such books themselves..! \n\nBy reading this article of Gandhi, Mu$l!ms from all over India were agitated. And the owner of "Rajpal Publishers", Mahashiya Rajpal Ji was attacked 05 times in 03 years, but Gandhi did not condemn the attack even once... \n\nInterestingly, some Mu$l!m scholars filed the case of that book "Rangeela Rasool" in the Lahore High Court.  High Court standing four I$lam!c scholars in court, asked them which line of this book is not correct, you tell that. \n\nAll four Islamic scholars agreed that there was nothing wrong with this book. Then the Lahore High Court dismissed the case against Mahashah Rajpal Ji &amp; acquitted them of the crime. Then after that, on 03 Aug 1924, Gandhi wrote another provocative article in the "Young India"  newspaper, and in this article, he wrote in the gestures that "when a person does not get justice from the courts, he should try himself must be judged.\n\n After that, there were two more assaults on Mahashiya Rajpal Ji, and finally the attack of 06 April 1929 proved fatal in which a young man named Mohammad Ilm Din made several attacks against Maasya Rajpal Ji from whom he was attacked. Lost my life. Gandhi was in Lahore 7 days after the day he was assassinated, but Gandhi did not go to the house of Mahashiya Rajpal Ji to condole. \n\nNor is any of his editorials condemned the murder of Mahashiya Rajpal Ji. After that, the British prosecuted and sentenced Ilm Din, the murderer of Mahashah Rajpal Ji, to death in just 6 months.  And that is also because the whole Hindu society in this country was boiled. \n\nAnd the British felt that if they did not hang fast, then the British rule could also be threatened. After that, on June 4, 1929, Gandhi wrote a letter to the British Viceroy and requested to forgive the execution sentence of the murderer of Mahashah Rajpal Ji. \n\nAnd the next day, an article was written in his newspaper "Young India", in which Gandhi tried to prove that this murderer was innocent, immature, because he did not tolerate an insult to his religion, and he got angry and decided to commit this murder. \n\nOn the other hand, the then renowned barrister Mohammad Ali Jinnah, in the Lahore High Court, as a barrister, while appearing in the case, had said that the culprit is only a boy of 19 years, but he has committed a heinous crime. \n\nHave done its crime cannot be underestimated, but looking at its age, its hanging sentence should be changed to life imprisonment or he should be sent to the Black Water Jail.  But the British executed Mohammed Ilm Din, the murderer of Mahashah Rajpal Ji, in Lahore jail on 31 October 1929.  On 02 November 1929, Gandhi wrote the black day of history to hang Ilm Din in "Young India"!

<li>Title: 'Unpopular Opinion : Preoccupation with cows is regressive.'<br />Body: "It's very evident that Hindus have a thing for the cow. Although I personally think it's dumb and have tried to rationalize it off as 'pastural country with reverential people' I believe in respecting other people's right to revere and living in harmony with the beliefs of fellow Hindus. As any good Hindu should. However, this unhealthy and unhygienic obsession with this animal is just repulsive. As per the scriptures, along with Gou-Hatya = Cow slaughter and Brahmana-Hatya = killing knowledge keepers, Bhruna-Hatya = feotocide, infanticode and abortion is also a Maha Papa = Major sin. Yet, why is abortion a non-issue in Hindu society ? Why do we worship dung ? Why do we allow cows to walk in the middle of the roads, disrupt traffic and relieve themselves making such a mess ? The infatuation with this creature is so bizarre and gross. Championing nonsense like 'cow science' is retarded. This obsession has gotten out of hand, is too superstitious and is keeping us backward.\n\nI want to help gen-z usher our culture into the roaring 20s.
