<li>Title: 'Full letter of ISRO senior scientist Tapan Mishra of the series of assassination attempts on him, what all they tried and the approach by Indian Amercian professors from top US universities to silence him for remuneration. This needs to be read by every Indian.'<br />Body: '#Long Kept Secret\n\nWe, in ISRO, occasionally heard about highly suspicious death of Prof. Vikram Sarabhai in 1971. Also heard occasional doubts about sudden death of Dr. S Srinivasan, Director of VSSC in 1999. Case of Shri Nambinarayanan in 1994 is well known. But I never thought that I will be at the receiving end of such mystery.\n\nI was poisoned with deadly Arsenic Trioxide on 23rd May 2017, during promotion interview from Sci/Eng SF to SG in ISRO HQ at Bangalore. Fatal dose was probably mixed with chutney along with Dosai, in snacks after lunch. What followed was nightmare lasting for almost two years Severe loss of blood to the tune of 30-40% through anal bleeding. I barely could come back from Bangalore and was rushed to Zydus Cadila hospital in Ahmedabad. It was followed by severe breathing difficulty, unusual skin eruptions and skin shedding, loss of nails on feet and hands, terrible neurological issues due to hypoxia, skeletal pain, unusual sensations, one suspected heart attack and Arsenic depositions and fungal infections on every inch of skin and internal organs. Treatment was received in Zydus cadilla, TMH-Mumbai and AIIMS-Delhi over a period of two years. Famed forensic specialist, Dr. Sudhir Gupta told me that in his whole career, for the first time he was seeing a live specimen of a survivor of assassination attempt with fatal dose of assassination grade molecular As2O3. Otherwise his experience was limited to cadavers.\n\nI am thankful to one of my Director colleagues, present at the same meeting, who warned me on 5th June 2017, of possibility of poison given to me. Probably, I guess, he witnessed poison mixing in my food. On 7th June, MHA security agency personnels met me and alerted me of Arsenic poisoning. I am thankful to them, as their info helped doctors to focus on exact remedy instead of scratching their heads with unusual signatures of my ailment. Security agencies took me to different cities. I am sure, without their intervention, I would have been dead with multiple organ failure within two to three weeks.\n\nI learnt that this poison is given in molecular level suspension (crystal level is harmless) just after heavy meal. It is a colourless, odourless, tasteless suspension and hence cannot even be suspected. It gets absorbed through stomach during food ingestion, kills RBCs immediately to such large extent that the fine blood vessels are clogged, leading to heart attacks and strokes within two to three hours and the victim can easily be passed of as heart attack death. Fortunately, that day, I did not take lunch. Arsenic passed directly to colon region and most of them got rejected through bleeding. The small remnant created so much damage to my health that I only know and I kept my morale high to face the danger with poise.\n\nThe motive appears to be espionage attack, embedded in the Government set up, to remove a scientist with critical contribution of very large military and commercial significance, like expertise in building Synthetic Aperture Radar. I will also not rule out it also as a new modus operandi of adjusting seniority and clear me who was perceived as obstacle. Whatever may be the reason, it was a great shame for the country and our security apparatus.\n\nWhat pains me is that ISRO hierarchy and my colleagues tried to shun me as pariah. I pleaded with two successive Chairmen to help me in getting justice. Kirankumar tried his best to convince me that my earlier case of squamous cell carcinoma is resurrecting. I personally talked to Dr. Kasturirangan and Shri Madhavan Nair and they developed cold feet. What followed was a series of nightmares, alongwith severe deterioration of health. I was bombarded with hundreds of threatening emails to keep my mouth shut. I was saved by whiskers, due to alacrity of security agencies, from massive explosive incident, in which Rs. 100 cr. lab was destroyed. This happened on 3rd May 2018.\n\nOn 19th July 2019, an Indian American professor of one of the topmost US university suddenly appeared in my office. He requested me not to utter a word in future. As a quid pro quo, my IITK grad son will be accommodated in a top notch college in USA. I declined and he left my office at 1430 hrs. And my thirty plus years contributing career was consigned to sinecure position at 1630 hrs. on the same day. I was removed from all responsibilities, including SAC Directorship.\n\nMy security was breached and I was poisoned with gaseous poison, probably Hydrogen Cyanide, which hypoxiates leaving no trace, on 12th July 2019. I was hypoxiated severely, leading to convulsion, loss of senses and memory. I survived because of NSG training of my PSO. I was transferred immediately to hospital, administered ozonised oxygen and had to spend couple of days in ICU. Hospitalization was followed by a long treatment for hypoxia, which is still continuing. Curiously it happened just two days prior to planned launch date of Chandrayan 2 on 15th July. Probably to prevent me to be present there on this occasion.\n\nThere was a plan to defame me by doctoring the CCTV recording of my room on 23rd and 24th Jan, 2020. It still baffles me how this high security recorder, located in the room of Director, SAC was accessed, contents were digitally edited and played back in analog for rerecording. CCTV recorders are special recorders which can only be fed in analog and can be digitally retrieved. The attempt was foiled because of alertness of security agencies. I still marvel at the cinematographical quality of editing of such an unimpressive fellow like me.\n\nFor last two years there were mysterious appearances of poisonous snakes like cobra, krait at a regular intervals of a few days in my quarter. Karbolic acid vents are put every 10 ft. Yet nobody could prevent intrusions of the snakes. Fortunately because of my four cats and my security staff, they could be killed or caught alive. Only three months back, we accidentally discovered a carefully laid secret tunnel in my compound and hidden in a trove of banana plantations. Once we blocked the tunnel, all snake intrusions stopped. Two incidents convinced me that the mysterious people are after me and probably going to hit me hard before my superannuation at the end if this month. They want my mouth shut forever.\n\n1. All the signatures point to deliberate poisoning of my mentally challenged son with Covid 19. The poor boy, who cannot even speak or eat or carry out hygiene activities himself, had to be hospitalized for 10 days, followed by months of complications.\n\n2. There was a failed attempt in poisoning me with Arsenic, probably in first week of September 2020. It failed, but it was enough to create signature of quite good amount of poisoning, leading to skeletal pain, skin peeling and nail dying.\n\nEnough is enough. I have faith in our security apparatus and men. But these mysterious men are much more equipped, trained, lethal and determined to snuff out living witness of the most shameful incident of Indian science. I put forward to Government, intellectuals and fellow scientists and my classmates and teachers, spread across the world, that all efforts should be made to keep me and my family safe and punish these mysterious men. I am convinced that these are the men, embedded in our system, are leading to mysterious deaths of scientists and destruction of our institutions. These incidents should be wake up call to prevent such nefarious happening to many of our bright minds in future. The nation, which cannot protect their own people who made contributions in building it in the first place, is destined to suffer.\n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2021/01/former-isro-sac-director-tapan-misra-reveals-he-was-poisoned-arsenic-trioxide/'<br />Author: 'BalHanumanJi'<br />id: 'krput3'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

If you check any newspaper or online news we will see people affected by caste discrimination across the country. The problem is any media loves to show negativity because people also like it.

<li>Title: 'Massacre, Election and a group of amnesic people. The Stockholm syndrome of East Bengali refugees: My perspective'<br />Body: "I have tried to keep it as short and to the point as possible so that it does not become boring for you guys. \n\nThe 2019 Lok Sabha election was a clear indication that BJP is going to the possible contender for winning 2021 Assembly election. The whole North Bengal, western Bengal and Bangladesh border areas of Nadia district has given BJP a clear mandate, paving way for BJP's inroad in West Bengal Assembly.\n\nInterestingly, the Kolkata and sub-urban area has remained almost untouched by BJP while TMC has retained its stronghold. The middle bengal (Birbhum and Murshidabad) however has been easier for TMC due to large Muslim population, despite having oldest RSS presence in this part of WB.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Parliament seat distribution 2019](https://preview.redd.it/koslg5360p961.jpg?width=1199&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40ff610b6e81513631f8bc8c273153d1086a2cd7)\n\nEast Bengali Hindu refugees have been settling mostly in the Kolkata and sub-urban part. CPIM did a great job convincing them to be their vote bank. Remember, Jyoti Basu (CM for 23 years) was a East Bengali refugee. Despite committing atrocities and mass murder of refugees they whitewashed them and did not allow the facts to come out in public. All the history of atrocities has remained only in the private life of individuals who suffered. Its a very strange factor that they don't want to remember the atrocities that has been caused upon them. They just want to move on and not speak about them. Unless there is a long sustaining tradition of keeping the stories alive, we forget and make the same mistakes again and again and again. Ayodhya has been able to celebrated Diwali after 492 years. Because They kept the stories alive.\n\nThe East Bengali voter base has switched towards TMC, which is why BJP is yet to gain a mandate in this area. You will probably never find another group of people that has forgotten atrocities that has been committed on them by Muslims and communists. We have studied in the leftist education system. So imagine how much whitewashing and indoctrination has been done through school education. Also, recruiting teachers from party cadre base has been a common feature of CPIM and TMC. So we have been indoctrinated by our curriculum, our teachers, even our religious institutes spread the non sense of Sarv dharm Badapav. Probably I was lucky that I grew up in a sanghi household and studied in a cultural environment.\n\nProbably everyone of us have been taught from childhood not to speak about politics in public. The red terror of CPIM is so ingrained in the Bengali psyche that it is taking time to come out of that. Due to the Neo-cultural renaissance of Hindutva, availability of information (Thank you Jio, democracy owes you a lot) and inter connectivity due to Social Media a new batch of assertive Hindus are emerging. We may be Aastik, we may be Nastik, we may be vegeterian or non-vegeterian, we may be Shakta or Shaiva or Vaishnav or nirishwarvadi, but we all are proud of our culture, our heroes and our heritage. \n\nBharat mata ki Jay."<br />Author: 'Straight_Razor007'<br />id: 'krlmub'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

India was independent from the britishers, but still ruled by Congress.\n\n1. **Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose** was considered a **CRIMINAL** by our First Prime Minister(NEHRU-The darling of liberals) The Original letter from the **National Archives of India** says it all\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/anlijpplio961.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=124be2cfd981c68b5efae017b73249684b0d79ec\n\n  **2.

He said: Look here; Scotland Yard has not yet written off Subhas as dead or gone disappeared never to come. If that is so, if Subhas comes back to India, will you be the Prime Minister or Subhas will be? That was Question No 1. Question No 2 was, supposing the country is not partitioned, will Bengal contribute the Prime Ministership or will UP contribute the Prime Ministership? The hint was very clear and the vacillating great leader agreed to Partition.***\n\n3. After winning the 1971 elections, KGB approved establishment of a secret fund of 2.5 million rubles (approx. Rs. 7.5 Crore in 1971, *check link in source*) for the operations in India for the coming years.\n\n4. Indira Gandhi was totally against the CIA (obvious her being sponsored by KGB), she sent a letter to the then PM of Sri Lanka, Bandarnaike, attaching fake/forged CIA documents and planted articles in the Indian Newspapers by the KGB. As a result PM Bandarnaike setup a committee to investigate CIA threat to Sri Lanka.\n\n5. There were irregularities in the 1971 elections which invalidated Mrs. Gandhi‚Äôs election as MP. Later she persuaded the President and the cabinet towards declaring a National emergency.\n\n6. On 26th June, she declared National Emergency - Media was censored, opposition leaders were jailed/house arrested.\n\n&gt;More than 110,000+ people were arrested and detained without trial.  \nReports from the New Delhi main residency, headed from 1975 to 1977 by Leonid Shebarshin, claimed (probably greatly exaggerated) credit for using its agents of influence to persuade Mrs Gandhi to declare the emergency.\n\n7. Till 1975, more than **10 million rubles** (Back then Rs. 30 Crore = Rs. 3000 Lakh) were spent to support Mrs. Gandhi and to undermine her opponents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nl9lke84io961.png?width=495&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=959d58a12aa89603bd553bec59fdb3546ae8ee1d\n\n 8. There were claims that Mrs Gandhi tried to prevent the Janata Party from taking the power with the backing of Indian Army High Command but failed.\n\n9. Under Janata Party, the active measures of KGB became difficult.\n\n&gt;Articles planted by the KGB in the Indian press declined sharply from 1,980 in 1976 to 411 in 1977.\n\n10. In 1984 after Mrs. Gandhi sent troops into the Golden Temple at Amritsar, there was evidence concluding the planned assassination of Mrs. Gandhi by the Pakistan and Afghanistan Intelligence.\n\n&gt;On 31 October she was shot dead by two Sikh guards in the garden of her house. Predictably, some conspiracy theorists were later to argue that the guards had been working for the CIA. Though the Centre probably did not originate this conspiracy theory, attempting to implicate the Agency in the assassination of Mrs Gandhi became one of the chief priorities of KGB active measures in India over the next few years.\n\nIt was also revealed that  The Soviets supplied clandestine money to the Congress and individual politicians, with up to 40% of Indira Gandhi‚Äôs parliamentarians receiving political contributions from Moscow, a recently declassified CIA says, mirroring similar assertions in highly classified KGB records leaked in 2005.\n\n The CIA report dated December 1985, on the prevailing Soviet influence in India, is heavily redacted but says that Moscow was deeply involved in the Indian political process through covert contributions to parties and individuals.  \n\n\n ‚ÄúAs many as 40% Congress MPs in Mrs Gandhi‚Äôs last government had received Soviet political contributions,‚Äù the report titled ‚ÄúThe Soviets in India‚Äù reads, adding that ‚Äúthe Soviet embassy maintains a large reserve of rupees for various uses ‚Äî including clandestine payments to Congress politicians.‚Äù  \n\n\n The CIA report was similar to claims in a 2005 book by former KGB operative Vasili Mitrokhin who smuggled thousands of secret documents out from the Soviet Union. The documents claimed that Indira Gandhi was sent money in suitcases for the Congress party and the KGB had funded election campaigns of former defence minister VK Krishna Menon, besides four other Union ministers in the 1970s.  \n\n\n The CIA documents accessed by ET allege Soviets provided kickbacks to the Congress party through arrangements with Indian businessmen. It also named the CPI and CPM as major benefactors of Soviet funding. ‚ÄúSoviet funding reaches the two Communist parties, the CPI and CPM through a combination of kickback schemes, normal business transactions and direct cash payments,‚Äù the report said.  \n\n\n The CIA‚Äôs assessment then was that the funding by the KGB gave ready access to many leaders and helped Moscow influence Indian policies. In the leaked KGB papers revealed by Mitrokhin too, India is described as a model of the KGBs infiltration in third world governments, with scores of sources across the government.  \n\n\n Or as the Telegraph describes the Mitrokhin Archive leaks from the former Soviet spy, "Even the Soviets were amazed by the workings of the INC, It seemed as if the whole country was up for sale."\n\nSource :[Documents reveal Nehru govt shared information on Netaji\'s family with MI5](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/documents-reveal-nehru-govt-shared-information-on-netaji-s-family-with-mi5/story-ITBOB2mIlEXIDe8YdJoITL.html)\n\nSource: [Why Did the Government Spy on Netaji‚Äôs Kin for More Than Two Decades?](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-did-the-government-spy-on-netajis-kin-for-more-than-two-decades)\n\nSource: [Nehru spied on Bose family for 20 years, declassified papers reveal](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-3032682/Nehru-spied-Bose-family-20-years-Declassified-papers-reveal-IB-snooped-family-s-letters-followed-tracked-visitors.html)\n\nSource: [Historical currency converter with official exchange rates from 1953](https://fxtop.com/en/historical-currency-converter.php?A=1&amp;C1=RUB&amp;C2=INR&amp;DD=17&amp;MM=08&amp;YYYY=1971&amp;B=1&amp;P=&amp;I=1&amp;btnOK=Go!)\n\nSource: India‚Äôs biggest cover-up\n\nSource: The Mitrokhin Archives I and II ([https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/collection/52/mitrokhin-archive](https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/collection/52/mitrokhin-archive))\n\nSource: [Secret government papers raise mystery of Netaji\'s missing treasure](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-3082358/Mystery-Netaji-s-missing-treasure-Secret-government-papers-reveal-Nehru-told-Bose-s-missing-war-chest-100kg-gold-jewels-former-PM-failed-order-probe.html)\n\nSource : [http://netajipapers.gov.in](http://netajipapers.gov.in/)\n\n[https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/the-kgb-papers-it-seemed-like-the-entire-country-was-for-sale/cid/1023636](https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/the-kgb-papers-it-seemed-like-the-entire-country-was-for-sale/cid/1023636)\n\nSource:[https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP86T00586R000400490007-7.pdf](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP86T00586R000400490007-7.pdf) (CIA Source,open at your own discretion)'<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'krkmzq'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'The Manusmriti was heavily altered. No I am not speaking out of my ass. Please read the post.'<br />Body: "I've noticed many people have this wrong impression that Manusmriti is casteist and against women. \n\nYou are right. THE CURRENT VERSION of Manusmriti definitely has verses that are casteist and against women. \n\nHowever, there are also a good number of verses that are totally opposite to this. There are two explanations. Either Manu was completely insane and wrote down contradictory verses. \n\nOr the Manusmriti was later altered. \n\nWe have one instances in which it was plausible that the Manusmriti was altered. Max Muller's translation. He was a German working for the British. Coincidentally, *his* translation is currently the ONLY AVAILABLE version of the Manusmriti. Interesting eh? We have alternate versions of pretty much all Hindu texts, but somehow there's only one for Manusmriti. \n\nI claim that the Manusmriti has been altered by the British because if you read through this, you'll see that the altered verses are so utterly different in ideology and thought that they really seem like they belong in a separate book.\n\nI have listed below all the contradicting verses I could find. There are many of them so this comment is going to be LONG. I won't hold it against you if you wanna just skim through it. But I highly suggest you please read this through. \n\nGet a glass of water. This is a fairly long read for a reddit post. \n\nLet us look at all the casteist verses. \n\n&gt;For the welfare of humanity the supreme creator Brahma, gave birth to the Brahmins from his mouth, the Kshatriyas from his shoulders, the Vaishyas from his thighs and Shudras from his feet. (Manu‚Äôs code I-31,)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;God said the duty of a Shudra is to serve the upper varnas faithfully with devotion and without grumbling. (Manu 1-91) Manu is not satisfied with this. He wants this servile status of the Shudras to be expressed in the names and surnames of persons belonging to that community.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Manu says:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Let the first part of a Brahman‚Äôs name denote something auspicious, a Kshatriya‚Äôs be connected with power, and a Vaishyas with wealth but a Shudra‚Äôs express something contemptible. (Manu II. 31.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The second part of a Brahmin‚Äôs name shall be a word implying happiness, of a Kshatriya‚Äôs (a word) implying protection, of a Vaishya‚Äôs a term expressive of thriving and of a Shudra‚Äôs an expression denoting service. (Manu II. 32.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A hundred year old Kshatriya must treat a ten year old Brahmin boy as his father. (Manu 11-135)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Brahmin should never invite persons of other varnas for food. In case, the latter begs the Brahmin for food, the Brahmin may give them some left-over. Even these left-over must be served not by the Brahmin but by his servants outside the house. (Manu II2).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He who instructs Shudra pupils and he whose teacher is a Shudra shall become disqualified for being invited to a shradha. (Manu III. 156.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A Shudra is unfit of receive education. The upper varnas should not impart education or give advice to a Shudra. It is not necessary that the Shudra should know the laws and codes and hence need not be taught. Violators will go to as amrita hell. (Manu IV-78 to 81)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;‚ÄúLet him not dwell in a country where the rulers are Shudras.‚Äù (Manu IV. 61)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He must never read the Vedas in the presence of the Shudras. (Manu IV. 99.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Any country, where there are no Brahmins, of where they are not happy will get devastated and destroyed. (Manu VIII-20 to 22)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A Brahmana who is only a Brahman by decent i.e., one who has neither studied nor performed any other act required by the Vedas may, at the king‚Äôs pleasure, interpret the law to him i.e., act as the judge, but never a Shudra (however learned he may be). (Manu VIII. 20.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Kingdom of that monarch, who looks on while a Shudra settles the law, will sink low like a cow in the morass. (Manu VIII. 21.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Any Brahmin, who enslaves or tries to enslave a Brahmin, is liable for a penalty of no less than 600 PANAS. A Brahmin can order a Shudra to serve him without any remuneration because the Shudra is created by Brahma to serve the Brahmins. Even if a Brahmin frees a Shudra from slavery the Shudra continues to be a slave as he is created for slavery. Nobody has the right to free him. (Manu VIII-50,56 and 59)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A Shudra who insults a twice born man with gross invectives shall have his tongue cut out; for he is of low origin. (Manu VIII. 270.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If he mentions the names and castes of the (twice born) with contumely, an iron nail, ten fingers long, shall be thrust red hot into his mouth. (Manu VIII. 271.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If a Shudra arrogantly presumes to preach religion to Brahmins, the king shall have poured burning oil in his mouth and ears. Manu VIII. 272.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A Shudra who has an intercourse with a woman of the higher caste guarded or unguarded shall be punished n the following manner; if she was unguarded, he loses the offending part; if she was guarded then he should be put to death and his property confiscated.‚Äù (Manu VIII. 374.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A Brahman may compel a Shudra, whether bought or unbought, to do servile work for he is created by the creator to be the slave of a Brahmana. (Manu VIII. 413.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;No Shudra should have property of his own, He should have nothing of his own. The existence of a wealthy Shudra is bad for the Brahmins. A Brahman may take possession of the goods of a Shudra. (ManuVIII-417 &amp; X129)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A Brahman may seize without hesitation, if he be in distress for his subsistence, the goods of his Shudra. The Shudra can have only one occupation. This is one of the inexorable laws of Manu. says Manu. (Manu VIII. 417)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A Shudra who wants to just fill his stomach may serve a Vaishya. If he wants a permanent means of living he can serve a Kshatriya. But if he wants to go to heaven or wants higher or superior birth in the next generation he must serve a Brahmin. (ManuIX334 &amp; 335)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The most sacred duty of a Shudra is to serve the Brahmins, always, reciting the words ‚ÄúBrahman‚Äù with utmost devotion. Such a Shudra will get salvation. Otherwise he will die a worst death and will go to the worst hell. (Manu X-121)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But let a (Shudra) serve Brahmans, either for the sake of heaven, or with a view to both (this life and the next) for he who is called the servant of a Brahman thereby gains all his ends. (Manu X. 122.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The service of Brahmans alone is declared (to be) an excellent occupation for a Shudra for whatever else besides this he may perform will bear him no fruit. (Manu X. 123.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They must allot to him out of their own family (property) a suitable maintenance, after considering his ability, his industry, and the number of those whom he is bound to support. (Manu X. 124.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Brahmins to give Shudras food leftovers, old torn clothes, spoiled grain and old utensils (Manu X-125)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;No superfluous collection of wealth must be made by a Shudra, even though he has power to make it, since a servile man, who has amassed riches, becomes proud, and, by his insolence or neglect, gives pain to Brahmins. (Manu X. 129.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A Brahmin shall never beg from a Shudra, property for (performing) a sacrifice i.e., for religious purposes. All marriages with the Shudra were prescribed. Marriage with a woman belonging to any of three other classes was forbidden.\n\nBut you knew these. Now let us look at the stuff that contradicts these verses. \n\nHere are the verses from Manusmriti which says that Varna is based on qualification not on the basis of Birth. It also tells us Shudras are not supposed to be some lower caste but merely uneducated. \n\n&gt;2/157. As an elephant made of wood, as an antelope made of leather, such is an unlearned Brahmana; those three have nothing but the names (devoid of virtues respective to their kind).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2/28. This (human) body is made fit for (union with) Brahman by study of the Vedas, by vows, by burnt oblations, by (recitation of) sacred texts, by (acquisition of the) threefold sacred science, by offering (to gods, sages and manes), by (procreation of) sons, by great sacrifices, and by (the  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Srauta) rites.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(The above texts lays the qualifications to be acquired, with great dedication and effort at specified works, in order to become a Brahmin, and not merely by being born to a Brahmin father.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Varna of a person (caste or status in society) was decided after completion of his education.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Two births were considered for a person in Vedic period : first, when he was born to his parents, and, next, when he completed his education with due thoroughness. It was after second birth (twice born) that the Varna of person was determined.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2/148. But that birth which a teacher acquainted with Vedas entire, in accordance with the law, procures for him (the student) through the Savitr (Sun), is real and exempt from his birth, age or death.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2/146. Between him to whom one is physically born and him who gives (the knowledge of) the Vedas, the giver of the Veda is the more venerable father; for birth through arising in the knowledge of the Veda (ensures) eternal (reward) both in this (life) and that (afterlife).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A person who remained uneducated and devoid of the knowledge of Vedas was considered a Shudra. That is, the Shudra Varna was not based on birth but on merit.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;10/4. Brahmana, Kshatriya and the Vaisya castes (Varna) are twice-born (educated) but the fourth, the Shudra, has one birth only; there is no fifth (caste).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2/172. He who has not been initiated with teaching of the Vedas is like a Shudra.\n\nThen there is this verse in which Manu says not to insult someone for their circumstances of birth or their intelligence etc.\n\n&gt;4/141. Let him not insult those who have redundant limbs or are deficient in limbs, nor those destitute of knowledge, nor very aged men, nor those who have no beauty or wealth, nor those who are of low birth.\n\nAnd these verses explain why the varna system even exists.\n\n&gt;1/31. But for the sake of the prosperity of the worlds he caused the Brahmana, the Kshatriya, the Vaisya and the Shudra Varna origin in form of the body of the society : as its mouth, its arms, its thighs and its feet, respectively.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(Only the ignorant consider the Shudra as being originated from the feet of God.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1/87. But in order to protect this universe He (God), the most resplendent one, assigned separate (duties and) occupations to those as done in a body by mouth, arms, thighs, and feet.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1/88. To Brahmanas He assigned teaching and studying (the Vedas), sacrificing for their own benefit and for the welfare of others, giving and accepting (of alms).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1/89. The Kshatriya he commanded to protect the people, to bestow gifts, to offer sacrifices, to study (the Vedas), and to abstain from attaching himself to sensual pleasures;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1/90. The Vaisya to tend cattle, to bestow gifts, to offer sacrifices, to study (the Vedas), to trade, to lend money, and to cultivate the land.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1/91. One occupation only the Lord prescribed to the Shudra: to serve these (other) three castes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Manu considered anyone who is without knowledge or capacity for skilled deeds as a Shudra. So any uneducated person is fit only for being in the service, under the guidance, of others who have the requisite knowledge and skills.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Isn‚Äôt that how we are organised even today? According to Manu, all those blue collar workers would be Shudras. Bankers, CEOs, white collar jobs etc. would be Vaisyas. The Kshatriyas would be the military and ruling class. Brahmins would be the scientists and knowledge experts.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Manu also advises people to exert in order to acquire a higher Varna, and change his or her allotted Varna. The advisory leaves Varn Vyastha changeable, fluid, and not based on birth but on merit alone.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;10/65. (Thus) a Shudra attains the rank of a Brahmana, and (in a similar manner) a Brahmana sinks to the level of a Shudra; and know that it is the same with the offspring of a Kshatriya or of a Vaisya.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9/335. (A Shudra who is) pure, accompanies his betters and is gentle in his speech, free from pride, and always seeks a refuge with Brahmanas, attains a higher Varna (Brahmana, Kshatriya or Vaisya) based on his qualities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;4/245. A Brahmana who always connects himself with the most excellent (ones), and shuns all inferior ones, (himself) becomes most distinguished; by an opposite conduct he becomes a Shudra.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Is it not said : the company one keeps makes a man better or worse ?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2/103. But he who does not worship in morning, nor in the evening, is like a Shudra and he shall be excluded, just like a Shudra, from all the duties and rights of an Arya (one of noble qualities).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2/168. A twice-born man who, not having studied the Vedas, applies himself to other (and worldly study), soon falls, even while living, to the condition of a Shudra; and so do his descendants (after him).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2/126. A Brahmana who does not know the form of returning a salutation, they must not be saluted by a learned man; they must be considered as a Shudra.\n\nA Sudra too can teach the other castes.\n\n&gt;2/238. He who possesses faith may receive pure learning even from a man of lower caste (Shudra), the highest law even from the lowest, and an excellent wife even from a base family.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2/241. It is prescribed that in times of distress (a student) may learn (the Vedas) from one who is not a Brahmana; and that he shall walk behind and serve (such a) teacher, as long as the instruction lasts.\n\nSuperior rights given by Manu to Shudras.\n\n&gt;2/136. Wealth, kindred, age, (the due performance of) rites, and, fifthly, sacred learning are titles to respect; but each later-named (cause) is more weighty (than the preceding ones).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2/137. Whatever man of the three (higher) castes possesses most of those five, both in number and degree, that man is worthy of honour among them; and (so is) also a Shudra who has entered the tenth (decade of his life).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In above text Manu gives respect to any Shudra who is in tenth decade of life. That is, anybody who lives long enough transcends the Varna Vyavastha.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3/116. After the Brahmanas, the kinsmen, and the servants have dined, the householder and his wife may afterwards eat of what remains.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Householders are advised by Manu to dine after Shudras or the servants.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;8/335. Neither a father, nor a teacher, nor a friend, nor a mother, nor a wife, nor a son, nor a domestic priest must be left unpunished by a king, if they do not keep within their duty.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;8/336. Where another common man would be fined one karshapana, the king shall be fined one thousand; that is the settled rule.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;8/337. In (a case of) theft the guilt of a Shudra shall be eightfold, that of a Vaisya sixteen fold, that of a Kshatriya two-and-thirtyfold ‚Ä¶  \n&gt;  \n&gt;8/338. ‚Ä¶ that of a Brahmana sixty-fourfold, or quite a hundredfold, or (even) twice four-and-sixtyfold; (each of them) knowing the nature of the offence.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Manu advises strict punishment for a higher Varna : punishing the Brahmana many times more than a lower Varna, say, a Shudra.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The above text is evidence of Manu‚Äôs unbiased social hierarchy and structure. He considered a behavioural error as being more unpardonable in case of the learned one than for the ignorant.\n\nFollowing are the examples of changing of Varn Vyastha in the past:\n\n&gt;1. Rishi Brahma, son Manu Swayambhu himself, was born to a Brahmana but became a Kshatriya king.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2. Manu‚Äôs eldest son, Priyavrat, became a king, a Kshatriya.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3. Out of Manu‚Äôs ten sons seven became kings while three became Brahmanas. Their names were Mahavir, Kavi and Savan. (Ref Bhagwat Puran Chap. 5)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;4. Kavash Ailush was born to a Shudra and attained the highest Varna of a Rishi. He became mantra-drashta to numerous hymns in Rig Veda : 10th Mandal.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;5. Jabala‚Äôs son, Satyakaam, born from unknown father became Rishi by his qualities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;6. Matang became a Rishi after his birth in low Varna.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;7. Maharishi Valmiki was born in inferior Varna and became a Rishi.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;8. Mahatma Vidur was born to a Dasi (maid) and became the prime minister to king Dhritarastra.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9. Raja Vishvanath, a Kshatriya, became a Brahmana ‚Äì Rishi Vishwamitra.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There are many examples of Varn Vyastha to inferior level:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1. Ravan king of Lanka, who was son of a Brahmana Rishi Pultasya, became a Rakshasa.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2. Shri Ram‚Äôs ancestor, Raja Raghu‚Äôs son, Pravidh, was declared of inferior Varna due to lack of qualities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3. Shri Ram‚Äôs ancestor, Raja Samar‚Äôs son, Asmanjas, was declared a Shudra due to his bad qualities.\n\nIf you've read till here, then there's still a little more. Now let us come to women. \n\nBelow are all the verses that describe women in a derogatory fashion. \n\n&gt;1. ‚ÄúSwabhav ev narinam ‚Ä¶..‚Äù ‚Äì 2/213.

Do you all remember that the Christian Inquisition targeted red haired women because they were assumed to be witches?! And by the way, since when did India have red haired women? Why would the Manusmriti say red haired women if redheads are not ethnic to India? Hmmm?   \n&gt;  \n&gt;5. ‚ÄúNraksh vraksh ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..‚Äù ‚Äì 3/9.

In case a Brahman man marries Shudra woman, their son will be called ‚ÄòParshav‚Äô or ‚ÄòShudra‚Äô because his social existence is like a dead body.\n\nNow let us look at the verses which directly contradicts all of this and praises women.\n\nImportance of happy women\n\n&gt;3.55. A father, brother, husband or brother-in-law should keep their daughter, sister, wife or sister-in-law happy and pleased through gentle words, respectful behavior, gifts etc. Those who desire prosperity should ensure that women in their family are always happy and do not face miseries.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3.57. A family where women remain unhappy due to misdeeds of their men is bound to be destroyed. And a family where women are always happy is bound to prosper forever.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3.58. A family- where women feel insulted or discriminated against and curse their menfolk- is destroyed in same manner as poison kills all those who eat it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3.59. One desiring glory should ensure that he keeps women in the family by giving them respect and pleasing them with good ornaments, dresses, food. Women should always be revered under all circumstances.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3.62. A person who does not keep her wife happy causes misery for entire family. And if wife is happy, entire family appears as happiness incarnate.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9.26. Women give birth to next generation. They enlighten the home. They bring fortune and bliss. Hence women are synonymous to Prosperity.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This shloka forms the basis of women being called Ghar ki Laxmi or ‚ÄòGoddess of Fortune in Home‚Äò in India even till today.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9.28. Woman is the source of all kinds of happiness in all generations ‚Äì be it from children, or from noble benevolent deeds or through conjugal bliss or through service of elders.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In other words, woman is the primary source of bliss in many forms ‚Äì sometimes as mother, sometimes as daughter, sometimes as wife and sometimes as a partner in spiritual deeds. It also means that participation of women is necessary for conduct of any religious or spiritual activity.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9.96. Man and Woman are incomplete without each other. Hence the most ordinary religious duty would demand participation of both.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thus, those who deny Vedas or Vedic rituals to women are anti-Hindu and anti-Humanity.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;4.180. A wise man should not indulge in fights and arguments with his family members including mother, daughter and wife.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9.4. A father who does not marry his daughter to a deserving groom deserves condemnation. A husband who does not fulfill just demands of her wife deserves condemnation. A son who does not take care of her widow mother deserves condemnation.\n\nPolygamy is a sin\n\n&gt;9.101. Husband and Wife should remain together till death. They should not approach any other partner, nor commit adultery. This, in summary, is the Dharma or religion of all human beings.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thus those societies which justify polygamy or sex-slavery or temporary marriage are bound to suffer miseries because they neglect the core tenet of Dharma.\n\nAutonomy of Women\n\n&gt;9.11.  Women should be provided autonomy and leadership in managing the finances, maintaining hygiene, spiritual and religious activities, nutrition and overall management of home.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9.12. A woman who is kept constrained in a home by noble men (husband, father, son) is still insecure. Thus it is futile to restrict women. Security of women would come only through her own capabilities and mindset.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This shloka explains the futility to attempting to restrict a woman to home in name of providing her security. On contrary, to secure her, she should be given the right training so that she can defend herself and avoid getting misled by bad company. The prevailing notion of cornering women within a small home is against Manu‚Äôs ideology.\n\nProtection of Women\n\n&gt;9.6. Even a weak husband should attempt to protect his wife.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9.5 Women should keep themselves away from vices. Because when women lose character, the entire society is destroyed.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;5.149. A woman should always ensure that she is protected. It is duty of father, husband and son to protect her.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Protection is not restriction. See the section on Autonomy of Women. Verse 9.12 tells that you should not constrain women in a home. \n\nMarriage of Women\n\n&gt;9.89. It is better to keep the daughter unmarried than force her to marry an undeserving person.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9.90-91. A woman can choose her own husband after attaining maturity. If her parents are unable to choose a deserving groom, she can herself choose her husband.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thus the concept of parents deciding the groom for their daughter is against Manu. A mature daughter has full rights to choose her husband. Parents should act as facilitators for the marriage and not final decision makers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And this is supported in ancient texts. Mahabharata and Ramayana. Draupadi and Sita both chose their husbands through Swayamvara. Male suitors had to go through a selection process and the final choice was in the woman's hand for whom she wanted to marry. \n\nProperty Rights of Women\n\n&gt;9.130. A daughter is equivalent to a son. In her presence, how can any one snatch away her right over the property.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9.131. A daughter alone has the right over personal property of her mother.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thus, as per Manu, while daughter has equal share as her brothers over property of her father, she has exclusive rights over property of her mother. The reason for this special treatment of women is to ensure that women are never at mercy of anyone. After all happy dignified women form the foundation of a happy society!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9.212-213. If a person has no kins or wife, then his wealth be distributed equally among his brothers and sisters. If the elder brother refuses to give due share to other brothers and sisters, he is punishable by law.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To further ensure safety of women, Manu recommended harsh punishments for those who rob away wealth of a woman, even if they are her relatives.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;8.28-29. If a woman is alone because she has no children, or no men to provide for her security in her family, or is widow, or whose husband has gone abroad, or who is unwell, then it is duty of the government to ensure her safety and security. If her wealth is robbed by her relatives or friends, then the government should provide strict punishment to the culprits and have her wealth returned back.\n\nProhibition of Dowry\n\n&gt;3.52. Those relatives who rob away or thrive on wealth, property, vehicles or dresses of a woman or her family are wiliest of people.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thus any kind of dowry is a strict NO NO as per Manu Smriti. No one should dare attempt to take away the property of a woman.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The next shloka takes this concept further and states that even slightest exchange of tangible items amounts to sale/purchase and hence against principles of noble marriage. In fact Manu Smriti suggests that a marriage along with dowry is marriage of ‚ÄòDevils‚Äô or Asuri Vivah.\n\nStrict Punishment for harming Women\n\n&gt;8.323. Those who abduct women should be given death sentence.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9.232. Those who kill women, children or scholarly virtuous people should be given strictest punishment.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;8.352. Those who rape or molest women or incite them into adultery should be given harshest punishment that creates fear among others to even think of such a crime.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;8. 275. One should be punished if he puts false allegations or demeans mother, wife or daughter.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;8.389. Those who abandon their mother, father, wife or children without any reasonable reason should face severe punishments.\n\nLadies First\n\n&gt;The concept of Ladies First seems to originate from Manu Smriti.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2.138. A man in a vehicle should give way to the following ‚Äì aged person, diseased person, one carrying burden, groom, king, student and a woman.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3.114. One should feed the following even before feeding the guests ‚Äì newly married women, girls, and pregnant women.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThere is such overwhelming evidence that the Manusmriti was altered. Just looking at the contradictions should tell you which verses are original and which are not.\n\nI am very sorry for the extremely long post but this HAD to be said. It is infuriating to see people ignorantly commenting shit about the Manusmriti without knowing how much alterations have been done to it. \n\nThere is one user I want to personally thank for opening my eyes to this since I too had once hated Manusmriti thinking it ruined Hinduism. Now I know it is a victim of distortion. \n\nI really hope this opens your eyes too. History is not what was told to us. Even our own texts must be scrutinized carefully, lest we end up believing wrong things."<br />Author: 'Darkstorm999'<br />id: 'kr4a72'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm üïâÔ∏è</li>

And if these patriotic libs actually want to see a better India, why are they so hell bent at Americanizing/Westernizing the country by compromising our own Culture instead of improving ourselves and adopting the better parts from western culture? Like i won‚Äôt say we‚Äôve got the best and most perfect culture. But instead of adapting the best from both, these guys are advocating to adopt something else directly. \n\nI bet every leftist would say India has the best culture if we purely followed what the West does blindly. No one would have any issues at all.'<br />Author: 'Carl_Johnson_Grove'<br />id: 'kqvtv9'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'MGTOW'<br />Body: 'We all know about the reality of third wave Feminism, I don\'t need to explain that. In the west, as a response to that wicked idealogy, they chose to bring about the "Men Going Their Own Way(MGTOW)" movement . It\'s basically a male philosophy which asks men to simply pull away from marriages and serious relationships and focus on themselves because they say the situation is completely biased against men - live in to divorce, the laws are meant just to screw men and give women immense power to completely screw men , which they don\'t hesitate to use.\n\nSo that\'s what MGTOW is , briefly. Many of you many be knowing of it.\n\nThe third wave Feminism in India is what the libtards have directly copied from their western counterparts and our country isn\'t untouched by it at all. \n\nSo what should be our response to this , if it grows to that extent in the future owing to the WOKE generation?\n\nI don\'t support MGTOW. It ruins society. Men and women have to work together for a functional society.

<li>Title: "The Three Strike Rule - Here's how you and me, average non-political Hindus can handle the people who vilely insult our culture and religion with no sense of shame for the act"<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j1elvtdtrb961.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f17c232470a2a69fdf6d9b87fc3ad4e76d69d7f\n\nIf you\'re not much in-depth aware with the Mahabharata you might be wondering why this image? What\'s the context here and even if there\'s a context then what relation does this image have with those who mock and insult our culture with the vilest of words?\n\nThe answer we seek lies in the  Shishupal-vadh episode of the Mahabharata.\n\n The [Mahabharata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata) states that Shishupala was born with three eyes and four arms. His parents were inclined to cast him out but were warned by a voice (Akashvani) not to do so, as his time had not come. It also foretold that his superfluous bodyparts would disappear when a certain person took the child into his lap and that he would eventually die at the hands of that same person. Coming to visit his cousin,Lord [Krishna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna) placed the child on his lap and the extra eye and arms disappeared, thus indicating Shishupala\'s death was destined at the hands of Krishna. In the Mahabharata, Shishupala\'s mother persuaded her nephew,Lord Krishna, that he would pardon his cousin Shishupala for a hundred offences/insults.\n\nWhen [Yudhishthira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yudhishthira) undertook the [Rajasuya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasuya) Yajna, he sent [Bhima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhima) to obtain the fealty of Shishupala, now king after his father\'s death. Shishupala accepted Yudhishthira\'s supremacy with no protest, and was invited to the final ceremony at [Indraprastha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indraprastha).\n\nAt that event, the [Pandavas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandavas) decided that Krishna would be the special honoured guest of the sacrificial ceremony. This angered Shishupala and he started insulting Krishna, calling him a mere cowherd and worthless to be honoured as a king.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shishupala#cite_note-3) He also started insulting [Bhishma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhishma), calling his vow to remain a [celibate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibate) throughout life as an act of cowardice. Bhishma became furious and threatened Shishupala, but Krishna calmed him down. Through this act, he committed his 100th sin and was pardoned by Krishna. When he insulted Krishna again, he committed his 101st sin. Krishna then released his [Sudarshana Chakra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudarshana_Chakra) on Shishupala, killing him on the spot.\n\n( www.wisdomlib.org (9 January 2015). ["Shishupala\'s Liberation \\[Chapter 6\\]"](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/mahabharata/d/doc118386.html))\n\nSo what is it that we gather from here? When even Krishna(The Supreme Lord of the universe) only held back from liberating Shishupal for the vile words he used for the lord himself 100 times only because of the promise he\'d made to his aunt, The lord himself didn\'t forgive the 101th vile insult thrown at him and here we are, mere humans with not enough patience to bear these insults even once,let alone a 100 times and henceforth, I propose the *Three-strike rule* which any of us ordinary working Hindus can use against these animalistic nonsensical creatures. And in the words to follow, I will be illustrating through example to you how we use this rule against these people-  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA user on Indiadisscussion sub   under a meta post was having the time of her life, user was a satrangi bengalin and the whole thread was a garbage can of her throwing insults upon insults on people, labeling people from other states as foreigners, fools, demonising Hinduism, calling all Brahmins as devil\'s own incarnations and although I had no business there, I couldn\'t stand my own culture and country being vilified by a grown up child with such an abusive and hateful mindset.    \n\nSo I tried reasoning with the woman/whoever "it" was since "it" hadn\'t identified it\'s gender.\n\nStrike 1- The first time I tried arguing politely, the user called me a demonic Aryan for my Brahmin identity\n\nStrike 2- The user went on to say that all languages except Bangla in the country were perverted form of Islamic languages and all North-Indians except the Bengalis with mongoloid features (which the user for some weird reason seemed proud of) were sub-humans because they were all Aryans.\n\nStrike 3- The user goes on to say, on a totally irrelevant topic to the argument i.e Kashmir, and how Kashmir would be indepedent one day from us North Indian pigs and the Kashmiris and "it" (the user) would walk on all our graves to achieve this goal. That\'s a separatist comment and that\'s it.\n\nThe user\'s three strikes are now over and it deserves the punishment I\'m going to give it.\n\nSo I went on to file a cyber-complaint for the separatism and the anti-India agenda that the user endorsed openly on the Internet while having the benefits of an Indian citizenship. I also tagged the NIA and the Delhi Police Cyber Cell on twitter to the link to the user\'s comment.\n\nThen I inform the user that its comment has been reported to the authorities and the creature replies "Oh really, nothing will happen" and "I will not be silenced by the likes of you, you\'re the scum of the earth", these are not the exact quotes but the gist of it.\n\nEventually the creature deleted its comments 10-15 minutes later and I went on to take my complaint back and delete the tweeted which tagged the NIA and MHA because the lesson had been taught well. Now the creature would think twice before abuse the anonymity it has online,simply because she/it knows that there can be consequences. So much for "I\'ll not be silenced by the likes of you" brave satrangi didi.\n\nAll we need to do is act bhratas and bhaginis,nobody will come with a magic wand to wipe these people out for us, it\'s high time we took matters into our own hands. The only prime reason why we still face so much vile abuse from these indecent creatures is because we don\'t act and hence they don\'t have to bear any consequences and therefore, the moment we start acting on ground, actually giving them consequences for their actions, it is that very moment when they will stop spewing horseshit without thinking twice, even when under an anonymous user when online.\n\nAnd that\'s the Three Strike Rule that we all can follow as a simple grassroots solution to counter, reduce  and eventually stop all the Hinduphobia both online and in real life(like the "stand-up artist" who has finally faced consequences for his words under the same rule, unsaid,but still the same rule)\n\nMy only request to y\'ll who want Hinduphobia to end as well, visit their subreddits,their forums, the places where these vile offenders are active in, engage with them, try to reason with them, and do so very politely until they have used up their three strikes, and then take action, and finally remind them of the consequences now that you have already taken actions and there\'s a high chance the offender won\'t repeat this mistake in life again if they really like roaming free instead of the hassles of visiting the Police stations or even going to prison.\n\nAnd if you\'re not aware of what actions you should take in what specific scenario, here\'s a basic list of what you should do-\n\n1. Hateful post/comment against Hinduism/Sanatana culture - File a cyber complaint with your state\'s police\'s cyber cell, it\'s convenient,easy for everyone to file while staying in the comfort of their homes without much hassle. State Section 95 ,Section 124A or Section 153A or Section 153B or Section 292 or Section 293 or Section 295A of the Indian Penal Code as the reason, here are what the sections say-\n\n Section 153(A)\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hate_speech_laws_in_India&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3)\\]\n\nSection 153A of the Indian penal code says,[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_in_India#cite_note-IndianPenalCode-153A-Valinko-4) *inter alia*:\n\nWhoever (a) by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise, promotes or attempts to promote, on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, caste or community or any other ground whatsoever, disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities, or (b) commits any act which is prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities, and which disturbs or is likely to disturb the public tranquillity, . . . shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.\n\n### Section 295(A)[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hate_speech_laws_in_India&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4)]\n\nSection 295(A) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) enacted in 1927[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_in_India#cite_note-Insult_to_religion-5) says:[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_in_India#cite_note-IndianPenalCode-295A-Valinko-6)\n\nWhoever, with deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of any class of \\[citizens of India\\], \\[by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise\\], insults or attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of that class, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to \\[three years\\], or with fine, or with both.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_in_India#cite_note-7) \n\nTLDR- All these parts of the Indian Constitution all kinds of hate speech/literature including the ones with religious ground and it very well covers Stand-up comedy and social media posts and comments. All of these laws have a prison sentence for the offender if found guilty of violation.\n\n2.Hateful post/comment on India or any kind of seperatist endorsements/anti-India agenda - There are two ways to counter this- \n\n1. Follow the three strike rule\n\n2. Take action after the third striike-\n\n2.(a) File a cyber complaint citing anti-national activities and seperatist agenda as the reason\n\n2.(b) If you don\'t want to take 10 minutes out of your busy day to file a complaint/FIR, just tag the MHA,NIA, you\'re state\'s police cyber cell and a few MPs(the ones whose offices are active on twitter) of the central govt. to the link of the hateful post/comment on twitter and then inform the offender that you\'ve reported them to the authorities.\n\n3. Do not reply to them anymore,I repeat do not respond to any of their "I\'ll not be silenced" rants anymore, the key here is fear. If you respond to their rants it just sends across the notion that you might not be serious with your action, your objective here is to not send the offender to jail or make them pay a fine but rather to teach a lesson that nothing is without consequences and hence when you do not reply to any of their rants later,it\'ll just send across a message that you\'re serious and would ignite a feeling of fear insider the offender. The result being that they\'ll think twice before spreading hate/Indophobia even under anonymous IDs from the next time onwards.\n\nOn a concluding note,stop being Gandhis my fellow trad Hindus, Gandhi had nothing to do with our cultures, and neither does Pacifism need a place in our hearts right now when our very civilization is under threats from all sides by various enemies. No better time is going to come for us all to be Krishnas and make these vile,abusive, animalistic and indecent Shishupals learn their lesson once and for all.\n\nSo take action as devout Hindus my fellow Bhratas and Bhaginis I plead you,take action.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **Jai Shri Krishna!**'<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'kqaz50'<br />Flair :Viraat Sanataniüö©</li>

<li>Title: 'The Purbiya Brahmins : A Short Military history'<br />Body: 'Throughout the history of the Indian subcontinent, many warrior peoples have graced the landscape and have established their hegemony in the regional military labour market. Indeed, the Marathas themselves, before carving out an autonomous territory for themselves, found profitable employment in the armies of the Bahmani Sultanate, the Vijaynagar Empire, the Deccani Successor Sultanates and eventually the Mughal Empire.\n\n\n\nAmong these many groups, one rose to prominence at the dawn of the 1st millennium AD, and remained on of the most dominant mercenary and landholding groups in the Northern half of the Subcontinent. These were the Purbiyas. The term itself, means the "Easterners" yet, the majority of these men came from Awadh, Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Baksar region. Hence, they were technically part of the North Western Frontier. \n\n\n\nRecruitment :\n\n\n\nThe Purbiyas were recruited from among the Kanyakubja and Bhumihar Brahmins of Awadh, Bhojpuri and Baksar regions as well as the Rajputs of these regions.\n\n\n\nThe process of recruitment itself is shrouded in the fog of history, but what we do know, is that the strong caste affiliations of the Kanyakubja and Bhumihars, allowed them to acquire employment in large numbers in Medieval Armies. The local Brahmin and Rajput zamindars, recruited men from within the Kanyakubja, Bhumihar and to a lesser extent the Rajputs clans and presented these levies to the Nawabs, Subehadar or Imperial recruiters themselves and assured their participation in the coming campaigns at a cost, which would be the combined salary of the soldiers and would also be used to pay for their equipment, if they didn\'t bring their own.\n\n\n\nUnlike the eastern Hindu warrior caste of Rajputana\'s Rajputs who were famous for their cavalry charges and skills on the saddle, the Purbiya Brahmins gained recognition as reliable infantry troops and dragoon-type troops.\n\n\n\nWith the introduction of gunpowder in warfare, these Brahmins, who were in close proximity to sources of saltpeter, which was essential for gunpowder production, became renowned as musketeers and dragoons.\n\n\n\n\nWe find massive contingents of Purbiyas beung recruited in the armies of Marwar, Nawabs of Awadh, the rulers of Malwa and Rajputana, the Mughal Emperors and eventually the East India Company.\n\n\n\nWe find that once their military traditions were established by the 17th century, English and Mughal officials noted, how the Brahmin youth would be sent into a "tiger tank" where he would only be allowed to emerge out once he had slain the beast, being reborn as a "fearless warrior".\n\n\n\nThis recruitment drive from Malwa saw the large influx of Purbiya soldiers into the region. Many of the local chieftains in Malwa depended heavily on Purbiya soldiers such as Silhadi who eventually became known as a Purbiya himself. The presence of Purbiya mercenaries in Gujarat are referenced in 16th and 17th century Persian chronicles including many Purbiya gunners serving in the army of Bahadur Shah of the Gujarat Sultanate in 1535.\n\n\n\nPrior to 1857, the British East India Company preferred to recruit Purbiya Brahmins, who they designated as "The military arm of the Brahmin caste" , or simply "Easterners". The Bengal Army of the East India Company preferred to recruit its sepoys from the Brahmins of Awadh and Bihar, in part because they had an average height of 5\'8", an important consideration in an army that valued impressive appearance amongst its soldiers.\n\n\n\nWe find that during the 17th and 18th centuries, until the revolt of 1857, these Brahmins held a monopoly in the Bengal Army. Between 1814-1815, Brahmins constituted roughly 42% of the Bengal Army, while the Rajputs were roughly 34% and the remainder were Ahirs, Jats and Muslims.\n\n\n\nTheir Own Kingdom :\n\n\n\nWhile the Purbiya Brahmins had been great zamindars and landholders in the Medieval period in the Awadh and Bhojpur and Baksar region, their aspirations for autonomy would find expression in the rise of the Narayan Dynasty and the emergence of the King of Benares. \n\n\nMost of the area currently known as Varanasi was acquired by Mansa Ram, a zamindar of Utaria. His son Balwant Singh, the ruler of Utaria in 1737,took over the Jagirs of Jaunpur, Varanasi, and Chunar, in 1737 from the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah of Delhi . Other places under the kingship of Kashi Naresh were Chandauli, Gyanpur, Chakia, Latifshah, Mirzapur, Nandeshwar, Mint House and Vindhyachal. With the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Kanyakubja and Bhumihars Brahmins under the leadership of Kashi Naresh strengthened their sway in the area south of Avadh and in the fertile rice growing areas of Benares, Jaunpur, Gorakhpur, Basti, Deoria, Azamgarh, Ghazipur, Ballia and Bihar and on the fringes of Bengal. \n\n\n\nThe strong clan organisation of the Purbiya Brahmins, brought success to the Kings of Benares .There were as many as 100,000 Brahmins backing the power of the Benares rajas in the districts of Benares, Gorakhpur and Azamgarh. This proved a decisive advantage when the dynasty faced a rival and the nominal suzerain, the Nawab of Oudh, in the 1750s and the 1760s. An exhausting guerrilla war, waged by the Benares ruler against the Oudh camp, using his troops, forced the Nawab to withdraw his main force. The region eventually ceded by the Nawab of Oudh to the Company Rule in India in 1775, who recognized Benares as a family dominion. Benares became a princely state in 1911. \n\n\nTheir Decline :\n\n\n\nThe Purbiya units of the Bengal Army played a major role in the Indian Rebellion of 1857 against the British. Mangal Pandey, a notable figure during the start of the mutiny, was a Purbiya serving in the 34th Bengal Native Infantry. Following the suppression of the uprising, British authorities decided not to recruit troops from the eastern plains, and the new Bengal Army was to be recruited primarily from the Sikh and Muslim communities of the Punjab.\n\n\n\nWe find that the vilification and vitriol that the British held for the "Pandies" gained more ground and began with a religious fervor post this period as they felt that the Brahmins were among the greatest threats to their rule.\n\n\n\nHence, the most influential and sought after mercenaries/zamindars/martial race of the medieval period, lost their prominence, until the first and second World Wars, when the war demanded more men and finally the Purbiyas were recruited in greater proportions once again.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\n\nThe Purbiyas were excellent soldiers and this  was evident in the fact that they were recruited from the times of Rana Sanga to the Revolt of 1857, in almost any army, that wanted a reliable and proficient infantry component.\n\n\n\nIt was their string caste affiliation that brought them recruitment, regional autonomy and influence.\n\n\n\nYet, it was this very caste affiliation, that sprouted within them the roots of rebellion, when the English threatened their caste, their race, their identity. Hence, the Purbiyas set the company ablaze and were the main driving force behind the First Indian War of Independence. And while they did not gain independence, they forced the end of the Company rule, decades before it would have.\n\n\n\nTheir struggle also inspired many more generations to come, to take up the gun and purge colonial rule with iron and blood.\n\n\n\nThese valiant blood-brothers and descendants of Lord Parshuram, hold a special place in Indian military history and since they are often ignored, I felt this as a good opportunity to tell their tale.\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\nSources :\n\n\n\n"Peasants fighting for a living in early modern North India" by Dirk H.A Kolf\n\n\n\nNaukar, Rajput, and Sepoy: The Ethnohistory of the Military Labour Market of Hindustan, 1450-1850 by Dirk H.A Kolf\n\n\n\nRecruiting, Drafting, and Enlisting: Two Sides of the Raising of Military Forces by Peter Karsten\n\n\n\nA Matter of Honour by Philip Mason'<br />Author: 'PushyamitraShunga1st'<br />id: 'kq4tn8'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture (Bharatiye Itihaas aur Sanskriti)</li>

<li>Title: 'THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MODERN LEFTISM AND EXPLORING THE TIES BETWEEN LEFTISM AND ISLAMISM IN THE 21ST CENTURY- THE UNABOMBER MANIFESTO FOR THE TRADITIONAL INDIAN HINDU -'<br />Body: '  \n\n**THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MODERN LEFTISM**\n\n1. Almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled society. One of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world is leftism, so a discussion of the psychology of leftism can serve as an introduction to the discussion of the problems of modern society in general.\n\n2. But what is leftism? During the first half of the 20th century leftism could have been practically identified with socialism. Today the movement is fragmented and it is not clear who can properly be called a leftist. When we speak of leftists in this article we have in mind mainly socialists, collectivists, ‚Äúpolitically correct‚Äù types, feminists, gay and disability activists, animal rights activists and the like. But not everyone who is associated with one of these movements is a leftist. What we are trying to get at in discussing leftism is not so much movement or an ideology as a psychological type, or rather a collection of related types. Thus, what we mean by ‚Äúleftism‚Äù will emerge more clearly in the course of our discussion of leftist psychology.\n\n3. Even so, our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less clear than we would wish, but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any remedy for this. All we are trying to do here is indicate in a rough and approximate way the two psychological tendencies that we believe are the main driving force of modern leftism. We by no means claim to be telling the WHOLE truth about leftist psychology. Also, our discussion is meant to apply to modern leftism only. We leave open the question of the extent to which our discussion could be applied to the leftists of the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n4. The two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we call ‚Äúfeelings of inferiority‚Äù and ‚Äúoversocialization.‚Äù Feelings of inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole, while oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of modern leftism; but this segment is highly influential.\n\n**1.FEELINGS OF INFERIORITY**\n\n1.(a) By ‚Äúfeelings of inferiority‚Äù we mean not only inferiority feelings in the strict sense but a whole spectrum of related traits; low self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, depressive tendencies, defeatism, guilt, self- hatred, etc. We argue that modern leftists tend to have some such feelings (possibly more or less repressed) and that these feelings are decisive in determining the direction of modern leftism.\n\n(b) When someone interprets as derogatory almost anything that is said about him (or about groups with whom he identifies) we conclude that he has inferiority feelings or low self-esteem. This tendency is pronounced among minority rights activists, whether or not they belong to the minority groups whose rights they defend. They are hypersensitive about the words used to designate minorities and about anything that is said concerning minorities. The terms ‚Äúnegro,‚Äù ‚Äúoriental,‚Äù ‚Äúhandicapped‚Äù or ‚Äúchick‚Äù for an African, an Asian, a disabled person or a woman originally had no derogatory connotation. ‚ÄúBroad‚Äù and ‚Äúchick‚Äù were merely the feminine equivalents of ‚Äúguy,‚Äù ‚Äúdude‚Äù or ‚Äúfellow.‚Äù The negative connotations have been attached to these terms by the activists themselves. Some animal rights activists have gone so far as to reject the word ‚Äúpet‚Äù and insist on its replacement by ‚Äúanimal companion.‚Äù Leftish anthropologists go to great lengths to avoid saying anything about primitive peoples that could conceivably be interpreted as negative. They want to replace the world ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù by ‚Äúnonliterate.‚Äù They seem almost paranoid about anything that might suggest that any primitive culture is inferior to our own. (We do not mean to imply that primitive cultures ARE inferior to ours. We merely point out the hypersensitivity of leftish anthropologists.)\n\n(c) Those who are most sensitive about ‚Äúpolitically incorrect‚Äù terminology are not the average poor ghetto- dweller, illegal-immigrant, abused woman or disabled person, but a minority of activists, many of whom do not even belong to any ‚Äúoppressed‚Äù group but come from privileged strata of society. Political correctness has its stronghold among university professors, who have secure employment with comfortable salaries, and the majority of whom are heterosexual males and females from middle- to upper-middle-class families.\n\n(d) Many leftists have an intense identification with the problems of groups that have an image of being weak (women), defeated (Muslim ghetto-dwellers and other minorities), repellent (homosexuals) or otherwise inferior. The leftists themselves feel that these groups are inferior. They would never admit to themselves that they have such feelings, but it is precisely because they do see these groups as inferior that they identify with their problems. (We do not mean to suggest that women, muslims,xtians etc. ARE inferior; we are only making a point about leftist psychology.)\n\n(e) Feminists are desperately anxious to prove that women are as strong and as capable as men. Clearly they are nagged by a fear that women may NOT be as strong and as capable as men.\n\n(f) Leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being strong, good and successful. They hate India, they hate the idea of a united Aryavrat, they hate  males, they hate rationality. The reasons that leftists give for hating the Hindutva driven nation, etc. clearly do not correspond with their real motives. They SAY they hate Hindutva because it is warlike, imperialistic, sexist, ethnocentric and so forth, but where these same faults appear in socialist/communist-totalitarian countries or in primitive cultures(for example pre-oil boom Arabia), the leftist finds excuses for them, or at best he GRUDGINGLY admits that they exist; whereas he ENTHUSIASTICALLY points out (and often greatly exaggerates) these faults where they appear in the Post-Vedic Indian civilization. Thus it is clear that these faults are not the leftist‚Äôs real motive for hating India and the Hindutva. He hates a united Bharat and the idea of it because they are strong and successful in contrast to what his own conscious tells him.\n\n(g) Words like ‚Äúself-confidence,‚Äù ‚Äúself-reliance,‚Äù ‚Äúinitiative,‚Äù ‚Äúenterprise,‚Äù ‚Äúoptimism,‚Äù etc., play little role in the liberal and leftist vocabulary. The leftist is anti-individualistic, pro-collectivist. He wants society to solve everyone‚Äôs problems for them, satisfy everyone‚Äôs needs for them, take care of them. He is not the sort of person who has an inner sense of confidence in his ability to solve his own problems and satisfy his own needs. The leftist is antagonistic to the concept of competition because, deep inside, he feels like a loser.\n\n(h) Art forms that appeal to modern leftish intellectuals tend to focus on sordidness, defeat and despair, or else they take an orgiastic tone, throwing off rational control as if there were no hope of accomplishing anything through rational calculation and all that was left was to immerse oneself in the sensations of the moment.\n\n(i) Modern leftish philosophers tend to dismiss reason, science, objective reality and to insist that everything is culturally relative. It is true that one can ask serious questions about the foundations of scientific knowledge and about how, if at all, the concept of objective reality can be defined. But it is obvious that modern leftish philosophers are not simply cool-headed logicians systematically analyzing the foundations of knowledge. They are deeply involved emotionally in their attack on truth and reality. They attack these concepts because of their own psychological needs. For one thing, their attack is an outlet for hostility, and, to the extent that it is successful, it satisfies the drive for power. More importantly, the leftist hates science and rationality because they classify certain beliefs as true (i.e., successful, superior) and other beliefs as false (i.e., failed, inferior). The leftist‚Äôs feelings of inferiority run so deep that he cannot tolerate any classification of some things as successful or superior and other things as failed or inferior. This also underlies the rejection by many leftists of the concept of mental illness and of the utility of IQ tests. Leftists are antagonistic to genetic explanations of human abilities or behavior because such explanations tend to make some persons appear superior or inferior to others. Leftists prefer to give society the credit or blame for an individual‚Äôs ability or lack of it. Thus if a person is ‚Äúinferior‚Äù it is not his fault, but society‚Äôs, because he has not been brought up properly.\n\n(j) The leftist is not typically the kind of person whose feelings of inferiority make him a braggart, an egotist, a bully, a self-promoter, a ruthless competitor. This kind of person has not wholly lost faith in himself. He has a deficit in his sense of power and self-worth, but he can still conceive of himself as having the capacity to be strong, and his efforts to make himself strong produce his unpleasant behavior. \\[1\\] But the leftist is too far gone for that. His feelings of inferiority are so ingrained that he cannot conceive of himself as individually strong and valuable. Hence the collectivism of the leftist. He can feel strong only as a member of a large organization or a mass movement with which he identifies himself.\n\n(k) Notice the masochistic tendency of leftist tactics. Leftists protest by lying down in front of vehicles, they intentionally provoke police or ethno-segregationists to abuse them, etc. These tactics may often be effective, but many leftists use them not as a means to an end but because they PREFER masochistic tactics. Self-hatred is a leftist trait.\n\n(l) Leftists may claim that their activism is motivated by compassion or by moral principles, and moral principle does play a role for the leftist of the oversocialized type. But compassion and moral principle cannot be the main motives for leftist activism. Hostility is too prominent a component of leftist behavior; so is the drive for power. Moreover, much leftist behavior is not rationally calculated to be of benefit to the people whom the leftists claim to be trying to help. For example, if one believes that affirmative action is good for Abrahamics/other minorities/lower caste people, does it make sense to demand affirmative action in hostile or dogmatic terms? Obviously it would be more productive to take a diplomatic and conciliatory approach that would make at least verbal and symbolic concessions to upper caste Hindus who think that affirmative action discriminates against them. But leftist activists do not take such an approach because it would not satisfy their emotional needs. Helping Abrahamics/other minorities/lower caste people  is not their real goal. Instead, communal tensions serve as an excuse for them to express their own hostility and frustrated need for power. In doing so they actually harm Abrahamics/other minorities/lower caste people, because the activists‚Äô hostile attitude toward the upper caste Hindu majority tends to intensify communal hatred.\n\n(m) If our society had no social problems at all, the leftists would have to INVENT problems in order to provide themselves with an excuse for making a fuss.\n\n(n) We emphasize that the foregoing does not pretend to be an accurate description of everyone who might be considered a leftist. It is only a rough indication of a general tendency of leftism.\n\n**2.OVERSOCIALIZATION**\n\n2.(a) Psychologists use the term ‚Äúsocialization‚Äù to designate the process by which children are trained to think and act as society demands. A person is said to be well socialized if he believes in and obeys the moral code of his society and fits in well as a functioning part of that society. It may seem senseless to say that many leftists are oversocialized, since the leftist is perceived as a rebel. Nevertheless, the position can be defended. Many leftists are not such rebels as they seem.\n\n(b) The moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think, feel and act in a completely moral way. For example, we are not supposed to hate anyone, yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time or other, whether he admits it to himself or not. Some people are so highly socialized that the attempt to think, feel and act morally imposes a severe burden on them. In order to avoid feelings of guilt, they continually have to deceive themselves about their own motives and find moral explanations for feelings and actions that in reality have a non-moral origin. We use the term ‚Äúoversocialized‚Äù to describe such people. \\[2\\]\n\n(c) Oversocialization can lead to low self-esteem, a sense of powerlessness, defeatism, guilt, etc. One of the most important means by which our society socializes children is by making them feel ashamed of behavior or speech that is contrary to society‚Äôs expectations. If this is overdone, or if a particular child is especially susceptible to such feelings, he ends by feeling ashamed of HIMSELF. Moreover the thought and the behavior of the oversocialized person are more restricted by society‚Äôs expectations than are those of the lightly socialized person. The majority of people engage in a significant amount of naughty behavior. They lie, they commit petty thefts, they break traffic laws, they goof off at work, they hate someone, they say spiteful things or they use some underhanded trick to get ahead of the other guy. The oversocialized person cannot do these things, or if he does do them he generates in himself a sense of shame and self-hatred. The oversocialized person cannot even experience, without guilt, thoughts or feelings that are contrary to the accepted morality; he cannot think ‚Äúunclean‚Äù thoughts. And socialization is not just a matter of morality; we are socialized to conform to many norms of behavior that do not fall under the heading of morality. Thus the oversocialized person is kept on a psychological leash and spends his life running on rails that society has laid down for him. In many oversocialized people this results in a sense of constraint and powerlessness that can be a severe hardship. We suggest that oversocialization is among the more serious cruelties that human beings inflict on one another.\n\n(d) We argue that a very important and influential segment of the modern left is oversocialized and that their oversocialization is of great importance in determining the direction of modern leftism. Leftists of the oversocialized type tend to be intellectuals or members of the upper-middle class. Notice that university intellectuals \\[3\\] constitute the most highly socialized segment of our society and also the most left-wing segment.\n\n(e) The leftist of the oversocialized type tries to get off his psychological leash and assert his autonomy by rebelling. But usually he is not strong enough to rebel against the most basic values of society. Generally speaking, the goals of today‚Äôs leftists are NOT in conflict with the accepted morality. On the contrary, the left takes an accepted moral principle, adopts it as its own, and then accuses mainstream society of violating that principle. Examples: communal equality, equality of the sexes, helping poor people, peace as opposed to war, nonviolence generally, freedom of expression, kindness to animals. More fundamentally, the duty of the individual to serve society and the duty of society to take care of the individual. All these have been deeply rooted values of our society (or at least of its middle and upper classes \\[4\\] for a long time. These values are explicitly or implicitly expressed or presupposed in most of the material presented to us by the mainstream communications media and the educational system. Leftists, especially those of the oversocialized type, usually do not rebel against these principles but justify their hostility to society by claiming (with some degree of truth) that society is not living up to these principles.\n\n(f) Here is an illustration of the way in which the oversocialized leftist shows his real attachment to the conventional attitudes of our society while pretending to be in rebellion against it. Many leftists push for affirmative action, for moving women and lower castes/tribals/religious minorities into high-prestige jobs, for improved education in Islamic schools and more money for such schools; the way of life of the Islamic ‚Äúunderclass‚Äù they regard as a social disgrace. They want to integrate the black man into the system, make him a business executive, a lawyer, a scientist just like upper-middle-class Hindus and some prosperous minorities(Jews,Jains,Sikhs etc.). The leftists will reply that the last thing they want is to make the muslim man into a copy of the Hindu man(allegedly extremist, misogynist  and intolerant); instead, they want to preserve Islamic culture. But in what does this preservation of Islamic culture consist? It can hardly consist in anything more than eating Islamic-style food, clothing and going to a mosque(anything further plays right into the faith‚Äôs mainstream goal of the supremacist agenda of world domination and the genocide of the ‚Äúinfidels‚Äù and results in radicalization of the masses that follow Islam). In other words, it can express itself only in superficial matters. In all ESSENTIAL respects most leftists of the oversocialized type want to make the Hindu man conform to, poorer-class tribal ideals. They want to make him study deny science for a document that advocates flat-earth, become an tolerant or ‚Äúsilent‚Äù and ‚Äúobjective‚Äù to Islamic violence, spend his life respecting and admiring the tribalistic,primitive and perverted idea of an Islamic civilization to prove that staunch Islamic minorities are as good as the idea of a post-vedic Hindu civilization. They want to make Hindu fathers ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù like their Islamic counterparts, they want Hindu organizations to become ‚Äútolerant‚Äù, etc. But these are exactly the values of the cruel-tribalistic-regressive and a primitive system. The system couldn‚Äôt bother anyone more than it already does with what kind of halal music a man listens to, what kind of clothes the family females wear or what religion he believes in as long as he studies in an islamic school, holds an unquestionable belief in the Quran(and the Hadiths), disrupts the progress in communities of other religions, is a ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù man when it comes to being a ‚Äúgood husband‚Äù, is silent on the vast amount of precedences of Islamic extremism that have killed millions till date and so forth. In effect, however much he may deny it, the oversocialized leftist wants to integrate the Hindu man into the Islamic/Abrahamic system and make him adopt its values.Conversion either by fraud or sword is the main agenda of this leftist-Islam conjunct.\n\n(g) We certainly do not claim that leftists, even of the oversocialized type, NEVER rebel against the fundamental values of our society. Clearly they sometimes do. Some oversocialized leftists have gone so far as to rebel against one of modern society‚Äôs most important principles by engaging in physical violence. By their own account, violence is for them a form of ‚Äúliberation.‚Äù In other words, by committing violence they break through the psychological restraints that have been trained into them. Because they are oversocialized these restraints have been more confining for them than for others; hence their need to break free of them. But they usually justify their rebellion in terms of mainstream values. If they engage in violence they claim to be fighting against racism or the like.\n\n(h) We realize that many objections could be raised to the foregoing thumbnail sketch of leftist psychology. The real situation is complex, and anything like a complete description of it would take several volumes even if the necessary data were available. We claim only to have indicated very roughly the two most important tendencies in the psychology of modern leftism.\n\n(i) The problems of the leftist are indicative of the problems of our society as a whole. Low self-esteem, depressive tendencies and defeatism are not restricted to the left. Though they are especially noticeable in the left, they are widespread in our society. And today‚Äôs society tries to socialize us to a greater extent than any previous society. We are even told by experts how to eat, how to exercise, how to make love, how to raise our kids and so forth.\n\n\\#to be continued.....'<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'kpngob'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion (Vichaar-Vimersh)üó®Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è</li>

Do you guys agree that Brahmins might be the modern day Dalits?'<br />Body: "I have seen at many places and even at chodi that many times brahminism is labelled as bad, evil and promoting oppression against lower castes. But how are all those accusations verified? Where and what part of brahminism verifies the allegations on it? As a result of this still many intellectuals and activists generalise and call all brahmins evil. Isn't brahminism important for sanatan dharm to exist as it protects and preserves the hindu culture, traditions, rituals and the spirit of hindu rashtra? Would it be possible for sanatan dharm to have survived for so many centuries without brahminism protecting and preserving its spirit? Whenever our lands were invaded, did brahmins give up their culture and rituals? Did brahmins betray all of us hindus when our invaders looted us? Did brahmins never fight for independence or protect fellow hindus and our culture? Many brahmins are denied opportunities because of something they never did in their life but because they were born into a brahmin family. Isn't this caste based discrimination? Shouldn't the constitution and government then provide opportunities to empower brahmins? Today around 64% brahmins live below poverty line and work in all occupations that were once thought of and designated as something a person from lower caste would do. The temples are still under the control of government hence leading many pandits to live in poverty. In this country the anti brahmin forces are much stronger than many of us might think. Government has stopped releasing caste based census since 2011 but it was estimated that brahmin population is now severely declined and its barely even 2.5% hence making them a minority. Does this all lead to the conclusion that brahmins might be today's dalits living in the only country they could live in without any support and opportunities? If so then isn't it possible that in the future brahmins may get wiped out of existence? Is this also the reason why many brahmins dream of settling on foreign lands with the hope that they may get a future with equal opportunities as anyone else? If so then how can we expect brahmins to be patriotic and fight for a country that denies them opportunities and oppress them? And at last what wrong has brahminism done to any hindu that its labelled as evil and bad. My intentions of discussing about these is to not instigate any division within us hindus or discriminate against anyone else but to bring these genuine worries and issues into light. I am sorry if this post violates any rules of this sub but chodi is the only place where we can all unite hindus and talk about some genuine issues and concerns which can be resolved in the future."<br />Author: 'petermishra420'<br />id: 'koz205'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion (Vichaar-Vimersh)üó®Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è</li>

If things don't change in the next 5 years, civil was will follow up right after that. We need our country back and shit has to happen now, this might just be the only chance to not have a dark future. We nees to take matters into our hands and it needs to be done now.

( For instance Kashmir is considered to be devoted to devi Kashmira,  in himachal we have famous temple of Devi hadimba and so on and so on, there are countless cases) \n\nTo be honest I consider myself as a believer of parmatma or the parm bhraman(the supreme brahman). As sanatanis we should know that parmatma is the greatest and the three major manifestations of him are bhrama, vishnu and shiv. \n\nPoint of discussion is what should we consider our religion to be?\nMonotheistic? Polytheistic? Henotheism? \nAnd what do the members of this sub think of themselves to be? Do they believe only on parmatma, or they treat everything around them like God(just like in Hinduism we treat various things as God) \nAnd if your answer is the later, kindly explain how much manifestations of parmata to consider and to be believed on are healthy. \n\nAt last this is post for learn something new myself and so that other people can learn something about too. ‡§ï‡•ã‡§à ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§≤ ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ó‡§≤‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•Å‡§à ‡§π‡•ã ‡§§‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§´‡•Ä‡•§'<br />Author: 'FatalConfusion0'<br />id: 'knn9m3'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion (Vichaar-Vimersh)üó®Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è</li>

In the first year itself, more than 460 squatters were sent packing out of their cosy Lutyens‚Äô bungalows in the first year.

Then they investigated further and it was found that the registrar was ordered from above that Teesta's case should be sent to the bench of Justice Aftab Alam and for this the muster roll and roster should be changed. Then he further investigated that it was learned that Justice Aftab Alam's real daughter Arusa Alam is a partner in Teesta's NGO Sabrang and also the wife of the then cabinet minister and senior advocate of Supreme Court Kapil Sibal.\n\n He then sent a letter to the Chief Justice against this and detailed the 10 rulings of Justice Aftab Alam and Justice Abhilasha Kumari, daughter of Congress leader and Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh, by elaborating in eight thousand pages.  \n\n Then, this gang was separated from every single case in Gujarat\n\n If Justice MB Soni was not there, then the Congress government had done its entire planning to implicate Narendra Modi\n\nHave you ever heard Rahul Gandhi, Lalu Yadav, Sitaram Yechury, Mayawati, Akhilesh, Mamta, Mehbooba, and opposition leaders calling each other thieves?\n\n No !!!\n\nWhile some of them have been convicted, some are in jail, some are on bail and some are facing trial in court but they do not call each other a thief!\n\nBut Modi who has no official charge, no FIR, no trial is going on, no court has even ordered any investigation, all these leaders are calling him a thief!\n\nBlessed Understanding and a sense of responsibility towards the country.

<li>Title: 'The Third Battle of Panipat, 14th of January, 1761'<br />Body: '(This is the last post in the series. I\'ll post relevant related posts, but not all, as I expect you all to lol for them in my profile. Thanks for reading these posts and I hope you enjoy this last one as well.)\n\n\n\nWe resume our story where the two armies were faced off against one another, the Maratha Army as an imperfect inverted crescent and the Durrani as an imperfect crescent itself.\n\n\n\nThe Two Armies at Panipat :\n\n\n\nAccording to Kashi Raj, the Shah had inspected a muster of his troops a day after Dussehra, October 20. The number then, was 41,800 horse and 38,000 foot. Of these 24 \'dastas\' of 1200 men each, or 28,800 men along with 10,000 foot were composed of the Shah\'s regular Afghan force, along with their 200 camel swivels, 40 pieces of artillery and some "shaturnaals". This along with Najib-ud-Daulahsl\'s 6000 horse and 20,000 foot, Hafiz Rahmat and Dunde Khan\'s 15,000 foot and roughly 4,000 horse. Allowing for the fact the pre battle skirmishes had claimed the lives of soldiers on both sides, the Abdali army in the field may be estimated to a total of 60,000\n(this estimate being borne out by Sir Jadunath Sarkar himself)\n\n\n\nNow, we look at Kashi Raj\'s record of Bhau\'s muster at Kunjpura, on October 19, 45,000 horse, 15,000 foot, latter including 9000 Gardi sepoys. Allowing for casualties, estimates show that at Panipat, the army had 45,000 total men on the field.\n\n\n\nDeployment of Forces :\n\n\n\nMaratha Forces \n\n\n\nThe Maratha camp had debated all night regarding a plan of action, yet most historians agree with the conclusion that the conduct of the Battle shows that such a plan did not materialise.\n\n\n\nHence, Bhau\'s army was deployed in part, according to the political situation in the camp and in part, owing to the confidence Bhau placed in individual commanders. He placed Gardi closer to the enemy, at the left, himself in the centre and the Maratha Sardars, whose troops and they themselves were low on morale due to previous defeats, furthest away from Durrani on the left. \n\n\n\nIbrahim Gardi occupied the extreme left wing with 8000 (approx) musketeers. Heavy Maratha cannon were placed in front of the infantry, in 3 deep columns in the form of a spear head, to lead their march. To support him stood, Damaji Gaikwar (2500 horse) and Vithal Shivdeo (1500 horse) and some petty captains (2000 horse) with their light horse.\n\n\n\nBhau and Vishwasrao occupied the centre with their persona Huzurat (13,500 Huzurat cavalry) \n\n\n\nThe Right being formed by Antaji Mankeshwar (1000), Pilaji Jadav\'s son, Satvoji (1500), Yashwantrao Pawar (1500) and Shamsher Bahadur (1500) with Jankoji Scindia (7000) and Malharrao Holkar (3000) contingents, all horse, along with petty captains (2000 horse) at the extreme end. Light artillery was placed in front of these positions.\n\n\n\nDurrani Forces\n\nGiven that Abdali commanded absolute control, he placed his forces in the centre, as a wedge between his Indian Allies to avoid defection. He also held back reserves and himself observed and commanded from his observation post close to his camp.\n\n\n\nThe Durrani Right facing Ibrahim, was under Barkhurdar Khan (3000 Kabuki Infantry) and Amir Beg with Persian Horse. Along with Hafiz Rahmat Khan and Dunde Khan ( 14,000 of which 1/4th was cavalry) followed by Ahmad Khan Bangash (1000 foot) .\n\n\n\nThe Centre was under Wazir Shah Vali Khan with 15,000 troopers, 2,000 camel swivels and 1,000 Kabuli Infantry.\n\n\n\nThe Afghan Left was under Shah Pasand Khan (5000 Persian horse). Najib-ud-Daulah with 15,000 foot and dismounted cavalry followed by Shuja-ud-Daulah with roughly 4000 men 1/3rd of whom were musketeers.\n\n\n\nThe Battle of Panipat 14th of January, 1761 :\n\n\n\nFirst Phase (9 AM to 12 PM noon)\n\n\n\nThe Battle began, as was custom in those days, with a salvo from both sides. The was followed by a Maratha cannonade, meant to carve a way for the Gardi Infantry, yet the inherent faults of Maratha cannons, made the cannonade ineffective. This fiasco continued for an hour, until Ibrahim sized the initiative, halted the cannonade and advanced his musketeers towards the Afghan left. He detached 2 batallions to keep a watch on Barkhurdar Khan and Amir Beg, covering his flanks. The remaining 7 batallions, marched under him personally, slowly towards the enemy. Yet, the infantry outpaced the heavy guns mean to support them.\n\n\n\nThus, the Gardis, now marching towards the enemy fell upon them, killing many in Rohillas, though they were outnumbered. Just then, Vithal Shivdeo, commanding the light horse, made a charge upon the Rohilla foot in front of him, yet the hail of Rohilla bullets, meant that he soon had to retreat. He had broken the order of battle, euffered casualties and had nothing to show for it. Instead, he sapped his soldier\'s morale as well.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Gardis had inflicted a loss of 8-9000 men on the Rohillas. Yet in the exchange, he had lost almost all of 6 battalions. Had Vithal Shivdeo held back, a tremendous charge could have routed the Rohilla left now, yet, as we have already seen, the Maratha commanders and the army had fallen from their disciplined days of old.\n\n\n\nThe Second Phase (12:30 onwards) \n\nIn the centre, Bhau\'s light artillery in front of his troops fired its rounds and Shah Vali Khan, took this as a signal to commence the attack. Soon his camel swivels took down the Maratha light artillery and Bhau knew that he had to reply.\n\n\n\n With their traditional war cry of "Har Har Mahadev!" the pride of Maratha Cavalry, the Huzurat began and impetuous charge so ferocious that the Afghan forces of the centre were swept before them, despite being armed with muskets and Matchlocks. The over-powering and irresistible charge of a sea of 13,500 swords and spears that flashed in the sun, fell like tornado of fury and inflicted heavy casualties on the Afghans. As Kashi Raj himself says "The fighting was so violent that the earth and sky couldn\'t be seen and the eye of heaven became dazzled at the beholding spectacle".\n\n\n\nAnd yet, despite this, the advantage of an Afghan centre in retreat or a beaten Afghan left, couldn\'t be pressed home. The Marathas lacked good cavalry in reserve which could drive home these gains and hold the territory gained, plus, how could Bhau abandon his position, given the camp full of women and civilians in his rear and the Abdali reserves in the enemy camp?\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, when Abdali heard news of these events, he took the following steps. He ordered his "Zenana" to mount their steeds and wait inside his pavilion. Next he commanded the 500 "nasaqchis" or military provosts to drive out by brute force, both retreating and reserve forces. Hence, within an hour, Abdali had reinforced his position with 4-7000 men. On the other hand, such communications were not maintained by Bhau.\n\nThus, by 1 PM, Durrani had fresh troops in the field.\n\n\n\nThe Final Phase (post 1:30 PM)\n\nDurrani had reinforced his lines with fresh troops against the Marathas who were famished for a fortnight not to mention exhausted. He had also commanded all position to advance and take down the enemy before them.\n\n\n\nAll this while the Afghan left had remained silent as well as the Maratha right. However, Najib-ud-Daulah, was the exception this. He was brave, cunning and adventurous. His tactical acumen showed itself here. \n\n\nHe commanded his cavalry to dismount with their muskets and thus instead of cavalry and foot he now had 15,000 musketeers, in total. Next, he ordered his rockets, 2000 of them, to fire at once, to create a thick wall of smoke. Behind this wall, he moved his infantry, quarter of a mile at a time, and they would throw up breast works of sand in front of their lines. Thus, he covered his movement, disorientated  and froze the enemy and advanced in order at the same time. By 1 PM he stood only within a long range musket shit of the Maratha Right.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the centre, Shah Vali Khan had made an attack into the Maratha centre, being reinforced by the Abdali Guard cavalry and foot. He attacked with no restraint and it was during the attack, that an unfortunate zamburak, hit 17-year old nominal commander of Maratha army, Vishwasrao, who now lay dead in his uncle Bhau\'s arm. \n\n\n\nNews of his death spread in the camp and the left and right wings, demoralising all men, which now being raised by a detachment of rebellious Afghans who had been recruited before the Battle. Gardi was overcome by sheer numbers and the impetus of Najib-ud-Daulah\'s attack, forced the right into rout. Here Holkar, Scindia and others retreated with what civilians they could take.\n\n\n\nAnd so, there he was, Sadashivrao Bhau, holding the lifeless corpse of the graceful pride of the Chitpavan Peshwa\'s manhood in his arms, his own nephew, a warrior like his ancestors were, who had died in that hell on Earth called Panipat.\n\n\n\nIn his last desperate and vengeful assault, Bhau charged and rallied his men three times, changed his mount thrice, killing as many Afghans as his strength would allow, until finally he was wounded by a spear and musket shots. He was lurching on the ground when some Durrani horsemen attacked him. "The wounded lion, now cornered" killed 2 of the 3 men attacking him, until he was killed himself. And beheaded.\n\n\n\nI will not say anymore, than this, that both Bhau and his nephew, were given proper Hindu last rites, by the Brahmin Prime Minister of Awadh, Kashi Raj himself. Marathas casualties in terms of troops is estimated 30,000. While the Abdalis suffered 10-20,000 themselves. Surajmal Jat, fed and clothed 50, 000 Maratha men and women fleeing the site. More could be said, but the Battle is what we are interested in.\n\n\n\nSources : "Marathas and Panipat" by Hari Ram Gupta\n\n\n\n"Ahmad Shah Abdali in India" and "Fall of Mughal Empire Vol I and II" by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n"Military System of the Marathas" by S.N Sen\n\n\n\n"Ahwal-eJang-e-Bhau-va-Ahmad" by Kashi Raj\n\n\n\n\nLinks to related posts :\n\n\n\nA Case in Favour of Sadashivrao Bhau - https://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/kay508/a_case_in_the_favour_of_sadashivrao_bhau/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\n\n\nThird Battle of Panipat, 1761.

I feel great satisfaction where I am but also a pain that's crippling. It looks like I'm alone in a valley of despair but my inner sky is musical and happy.\n\nEssentially I've embarked on a journey where I'll have to travel alone. My family tells me I'll fail. The world tells me I'll fail. But my heart vibrates with joy at what I'm about to do. There are moments of doubt in which I almost cede control and surrender. Its probably divine providence that confers on me wisdom in such delicate moments. It's exceedingly difficult to march forward while the world's trying to fetter you. Unrestrained criticism, condemnation from loved ones and the prospect of a spectacular failure do bother me.\n\n\nI've embraced an entrepreneurial mission which is daunting to say the least. I've made all the preparations and the rubber is ready to hit the ground. I believe there's potential in my business. But noone else thinks so.
