<li>Title: 'Hindutva Vs. Alphabets'<br />Body: "Been seeing a lot of pro LGBTQUVWXYZ self-congratulatory, naive and dangerous rhetoric on this sub. Okay deviants, let's get something straight (pun intended) there needs to be a fine distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva. Hinduism, via scripturea does in fact validate and sanction Alphabet behavior. However, we must understand that this extreme open mindedness requires a society to NOT internalize standards. This, when externalized into disposition has sever adverse consequences like inability to enforce law and order and even maintain ethical, moral and aesthetic standards. The mind has to learn to conform to be disciplined and hold itself up to high standards. This is where Hindutva comes in. Hindutva is about structure, order, systems, institutions, homogeneity, one community and only with these will we reach our goal - Hindu Rashtra. \n\nHinduism - Acceptance. Hindutva - Tolerance \n\nHinduism - What is Valid. Hindutva - What is Viable.\n\nHinduism - My logic. Hindutva - Our experience.\n\nHinduism - Unbiased. Hindutva - Explicitly biased.\n\nHinduism - Non political. Hindutva - Very political.\n\nHinduism - Alphabets r ACCEPTED cuz they FEEL a certain way.\n\nHindutva - They are TOLERATED. That's it. \n\nHinduism - Marry anything with a pulse.\n\nHindutva - Male + Female only \n\nHinduism - Liberal. Hindutva - Conservative."<br />Author: 'Ashen-Canto'<br />id: 'nqgs6a'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

But what I didn't know was that, this thought had crossed the minds of mha officials way before it arose in my mind, the mha had already introduced a mechanism/programme in feb that us citizens can be a part of. The aim is to negate insta handles , Reddit profiles and other social media accounts which are promoting anti national content. Ran*#ian mods can be booked under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. I am convinced since there is no legal framework that one can look up to understand what aspects makes a post anti national, r*#dia can easily be took down, since most of the post seems anti national to me and lot of us other folks\n\nIf anyone wants to be a cyber volunteer heres the redirection to the MHA link. \n\nhttps://cybervolunteer.mha.gov.in/\n\nY'all can register, well the procedure might seem a bit complicated but since it's for the greater good please don't retract the application under any circumstances. Since I am not an adult I cannot do anything. Since this programme is new, I am expecting immediate response from the side of the authorities. So strike the rod when the iron is hot. \n\nAlso we need to filter our posts as well. Posts demolishing b*#la might cause us damages. This might even result in the termination of our sub.

<li>Title: 'Hinduism‚Äôs approach to LGBTQ'<br />Body: 'Namaste! \n\nI came across a few people who said Homosexuality is a sin in Hinduism. They said the concept of third gender is a foreign import and is not inherent in Hinduism. \n\nBut I want to believe otherwise. As far as I know, according Hindu epistemology God/Brahman is presented as being both immanent and transcendent, pervading all that is sentient and inanimate within the Creation and yet existing beyond the creation. Brahman/God is beyond description, without name, without form, without shape and without gender. They state that every being is an eternal soul/atman, incarnate and that the ultimate goal of life is not heaven, but rather ‚Äúmoksha‚Äù, freedom from the cycle of birth and death. Moksha is attained by one‚Äôs real self, or atman, which is distinct from one‚Äôs physical body and personality as well as outer attributes such as race, caste, gender, and sexual orientation. So I believe that gender has no role in attaining moksha and that Hinduism entirely supports the notion that gender is a fluid as opposed to a fixed concept.\n\nAnd I also don‚Äôt want to believe that third gender is a foreign import since, Hindu epics mention several characters which demonstrate a range of sexual orientations and gender identities, including Shikhandi, Chitrangada (wife of Arjuna and mother of Babruvahana), and Brihannala from the Mahabharata. None of these characters are discriminated against because of sexual orientation or gender identity.  Rather, they are all treated with respect, and judged by their abilities rather than by their sexuality.\n\nLong before US activists, feminist brigades and academics ‚Äòdiscovered‚Äô the rights of gender variants and started marching with rainbow flags, India had already been celebrating ‚ÄúKoovagam transgender festival‚Äù and created gender specific empowerment spaces for genders beyond the conventional.\n\nIn essence I believe Hindu teachings hold the inherent spiritual equality of all beings, regardless of outer attributes. \n\nI want to know the opinion of sub or what you believe the Hindu stance on LGBTQ+ is?\n\nThank you.'<br />Author: 'Im_impossible'<br />id: 'nqd69j'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Role of Christian missionaries against Indian nation'<br />Body: "Any kind of insurgency always needs an intellectual ground or say intellectual backing. Enemies of Indian state, or the enemies of Indian/Hindu nation, look for an intellectual backing too. They get their intellectual backing by disproving or falsifying the narrative of India as a nation or a Hindu nation at times. Best way to do it is prove that India was systematically invaded by people from times immemorial, including the very Hindus who claim to the ancient custodians of this nation.\n\n\xa0Further they try to create a narrative that India was never a nation at all, South India was always different, North India was always different, North East was always different, cleverly bypassing the fact that within today's India's boundaries people used to roam freely, without having a hint of being in some foreign land. Because the entire region was tied together by the civilizational thread, if not a political one. Christian missionaries, are not only responsible for conversion of tribals, but they're also responsible for igniting separatist tendencies in these regions. Currently\xa0 India is dealing with (non Islamic) insurgency in two regions- North East and the Red corridor,i.e. Chhattisgarh, parts of Jharkhand, tiny part of Maharashtra. These regions are facing left wing extremism in the name of tribal Revolution. They get their legitimacy by all the forces who can or try to prove the illegitimacy of Indian nation. When it comes to their own identity, Christian missionaries, help them to prove that their identity is entirely different and they aren't and were never a part of Indian nation.\n\n\xa0In Southern parts of the country, so called Aryan invasion theory is well vocalised, at the top of their voices, by Christian missionaries because they have to prove, why the people in that region shouldn't be Hindu or why are they different from Hindus. This is a ticking bomb, eventually will lead to insurgency.\n\nIf you liked the article, check it my blog and subscribe it. Thank you.

<li>Title: '[Real] reason why Christianity is spreading in Punjab'<br />Body: "Hi r/chodi. I am a Sikh. I often lurk this subreddit, to see what's the perspective of the indian RW on ongoing events. I wanted to make one thing clear to you guys, the title. \n\nThe reason Christianity is spreading in Punjab because Sikhs are no longer walking on the path told by our gurus.  **LOWER CASTES FORM MORE THAN 95% OF CHRISTIAN CONVERTS.**\n\nOur gurus taught lessons of equality and no caste based discrimination. But Upper caste sikhs, majorly Jatts(Punjabi version of Jats) are too obesessed with caste, to the point that almost 90% punjabi songs contain the word Jatt. I am myself a Jatt and find it too cringey. Lower caste sikhs are not treated as equals by them. Lower caste sikhs came into sikhi fold because it promised them equal rights and better treatment, but the majority sikh population instead of treating them as equals still sees them as lower. \n\nAlso lower caste sikhs generally tend to be poor, and christian missionaries offer them money. Free education for their children, etc. Heck I have seen a Hindu guy who wasn't Dalit but converted, wasn't practicing tho. He mentioned all the benifits of converting for the sake of it. \n\nTLDR : Converts are lower caste people, who also happen to be poor, who think by converting they will get better status in society, and also lots of benifits are provided to them by the missionaries like free schooling, money on conversion etc. \n\nI am not a fan of you guys' beliefs like hating on Muslim among others. But I felt, as you guys are always talking about rising christianity in Punjab, you guys should be told the real reason."<br />Author: 'SnooWalruses2544'<br />id: 'nprdj8'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
<li>Title: "Speech delivered by Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893 at the First World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago"<br />Body: 'Sisters and Brothers of America, It fills my heart with joy unspeakable to rise in response to the warm and cordial welcome which you have given us. I thank you in the name of the most ancient order of monks in the world; I thank you in the name of the mother of religions, and I thank you in the name of millions and millions of Hindu people of all classes and sects. My thanks, also, to some of the speakers on this platform who, referring to the delegates from the Orient, have told you that these men from far-off nations may well claim the honor of bearing to different lands the idea of toleration. I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance. We believe not only in universal toleration, but we accept all religions as true. I am proud to belong to a nation which has sheltered the persecuted and the refugees of all religions and all nations of the earth. I am proud to tell you that we have gathered in our bosom the purest remnant of the Israelites, who came to Southern India and took refuge with us in the very year in which their holy temple was shattered to pieces by Roman tyranny. I am proud to belong to the religion which has sheltered and is still fostering the remnant of the grand Zoroastrian nation. I will quote to you, brethren, a few lines from a hymn which I remember to have repeated from my earliest boyhood, which is every day repeated by millions of human beings: "As the different streams having their sources in different paths which men take through different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight, all lead to Thee." The present convention, which is one of the most august assemblies ever held, is in itself a vindication, a declaration to the world of the wonderful doctrine preached in the Gita: "Whosoever comes to Me, through whatsoever form, I reach him; all men are struggling through paths which in the end lead to me." Sectarianism, bigotry, and its horrible descendant, fanaticism, have long possessed this beautiful earth. They have filled the earth with violence, drenched it often and often with human blood, destroyed civilization and sent whole nations to despair. Had it not been for these horrible demons, human society would be far more advanced than it is now. But their time is come; and I fervently hope that the bell that tolled this morning in honor of this convention may be the death-knell of all fanaticism, of all persecutions with the sword or with the pen, and of all uncharitable feelings between persons wending their way to the same goal.\n\n\n\nhttps://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS3EuBhFc7McSgLlN00KH_yKxg1NE6SVX05TA&amp;usqp=CAU'<br />Author: 'seedsaver777'<br />id: 'npr99d'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm üïâÔ∏è</li>

( This *shataghnii* literally is 'that which can kill a hundred people'. Its just called cannon so its easy to imagine) \n\nThat city Ayodhya accommodates groups of danseuses and theatrical personnel, and she is surrounded everywhere with the gardens and brakes of mango trees, and her wide fort-wall is like her cincture ornament. \n\nThat Ayodhya is an impassable one for trespassers, or for others invaders, owing to her impassable and profound moats, and she is abounding with horses, camels, likewise with cows and donkeys. \n\nWith the throngs of provincial kings who come hither to pay dues pervade that city, and she is verily lustrous with residents of various other countries, and with traders, too. In such a city Dasharatha dwells. \n\nBuildings are ornamentally studded with precious gems, and with such multi-storied mountain-like buildings she is adorned, and filled with them she is like Amaravati, the capital of Indra. \n\nAmazing is Ayodhya for its lay-out is like a game board called *aSTapadi*, and with its flocks of beautiful women moving thereabout, where all kinds of precious gems are heaped up, and where its seven storied buildings are picturesque. \n\nThe housing is very dense and there is no place or ground unutilized, and all are constructed on well-levelled lands, and rice-grain is plentiful while the drinking water tastes like sugar cane juice. \n\nThat city is sounding with the drumbeats of great drums, and with musical rhythm instruments like mridanga, cymbals, and with string instruments like Veena etc., and on earth she is uniquely the best city. \n\nAyodhya is like a hovering vimƒÅna attained by sages by their ascesis, and its edifices are well planned and it is teeming with best people.\n\nThey the skillful archers of that Ayodhya will not kill a lone one with their arrows, one that does not have either a predecessor or a successor in his family, a fleeing one, or by listening to the sound of the target, as is done in sonic-archery, and their skills, acumen and handiness are thus benevolent.  \n\nThey kill the fattened and roaring lions, tigers and wild boars with the might of their sharp weaponry, or even with the might of their own arms alone. \n\nWith that kind of thousands of archers, and with speediest chariot-warriors she that Ayodhya is filled with, and King Dasharatha made his abode in such a city. \n\nShe that Ayodhya is encompassed with Vedic scholars who always worship the ritual fire by enkindling the three kinds of ritual-fires continuously, virtuous Brahman scholars in Veda-s and their six ancillary subjects, and other great souls that are in similitude with great saints, and who are just like sages that are charitable donors, and that abide by the truth."<br />Author: 'Darkstorm999'<br />id: 'nppm2w'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm üïâÔ∏è</li>

He said whereas jews whom muslim considered to be their biggest rival are much more ahead in science compared to Arabs. Israel has won 12 Nobel prize in which 7 is in field of science and infact it's per capita nobel prize is highest in world more than india,china,us and Germany. Whereas, muslim (mostly Arabs and middle East) countries combined have only won 8 And only 1 out of 8 is in field of science and literature other just bias nobel peace prize. He also said average kid in Israel and other non muslims sees Albert Einstein,Neil Bohr and Newman as his inspiration whereas average muslim kid sees people like ertigul Gazi, Aurangzeb and other muslim conquers and barbarians as his ideals and we can see it in India as well where average hindu sees Apj kalam, Swami Vivekananda, Ramanujan, Chandrasekhar,cv Raman  as their idols whereas muslims youth sees babur ,akbar and Aurangzeb as their idols and come to think of it in recent sacchar committee report also suggested muslim are most backward community of india. In short if we don't help  them then they will biggest burden to our nation. I believe modi government should focus on muslim education and bring reforms in their society just as chad Ataturk did and encourage them to produce Apj abdul kalam not Ajmal Kasab."<br />Author: 'aashu_122'<br />id: 'np2neg'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

There were some Quora answers, and some Stack Exchange discussions - all were barren except a few comments hither-thither.\n\nNow I could\'ve left this thing as it is, thinking that it might be just some scientific-mumbo-jumbo, but I came across this: **"it is a major violation that agitate the minds of the public: exhibition of an "S" certified film to persons other than those for whom it is meant."** ...What?\n\nWell, now if something is made primarily for an educational purpose, I don\'t think it\'s wrong for it to be of such a seemingly-classified nature.\n\nThe same [stackexchange discussion](https://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/5785/what-is-the-cbfc-s-certification?newreg=b9aeea6459f34ea6b64c6d33bd83e88d) had a user saying that a film called "The Birth" was certified as "S." Again, I never found any film named "The Birth" in this short-research of mine.\n\nI\'ve finally come to Reddit, to share this pile of some interesting facts/findings of this "Elusive S," I hope you all have some answers to this certificate, like any examples that I can see (just to satiate my thirst). Is it some sinister thing like nuclear bombs and genetic engineering? Or they\'re just some tutorial video?'<br />Author: 'ZodiacReaderY'<br />id: 'noicco'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Contextualization and religion, why it is important'<br />Body: "\n  I wrote this paper sometime back. It was for a different audience and hence I didn't include Hinduism. However we should be proud that contextualization happened in Hinduism and we didn't borrow it from the Greeks\n\nIn recent years we have been subject to diametrically opposite arguments regarding Islam. For ISIS, Islam is a religion that permits use of medieval practices like polygamy as well as barbaric punishments such as beheading and stoning. Islam for such extremists does not permit co-existence with any other belief systems. On the other hand, majority Muslims in civilized world argue that Islam is a religion of peace and do indeed live in peace with people from other religions. This is a contradiction and a dilemma that needs to be explained.\n\nBoth Christianity and Islam evolved out of the same set of books, and both religions were born in similar geographical location as well similar era. Yet, both religions have evolved on a completely different trajectory. Citizens of most countries where Christianity is the dominant religion enjoy a better standard of living. On other hand, most Muslim majority countries have not been able to generate any wealth except that from oil.  When we look at Muslim majority countries, we also see large scale social unrest. If we remove the veneer of oil wealth, then we hardly see any Muslim Majority country that has managed to generate wealth and facilitates a decent standard of living to its citizens. Some notable exceptions might perhaps be UAE and Iran. Iran enjoys the same advantages that Christians had. Iran is covered in detail below. As to UAE, if we look closely then we can see that wealth generated by UAE is closely tied up to wealth creating abilities of the Christian world. \n\nSo the question is, why is there such a huge difference in standard of living between Christian and Islamic world?\n\nThe short answer to this is contextualization. Christians (especially Catholics) actively embraced contextualization. Most peaceful Muslims in the western world have internalized this skill as well. On the other hand, many Muslims in the majority Muslim countries and the violent Jihadists actively walk away from it. \n\nWhat exactly is contextualization?\n\nLet us look at the change in attitude towards money lending as an example to understand contextualization. Jesus and Mohammad both abhorred the concept of money lending and both banned it. They saw money lending as taking advantage of the ill fortune of poor people. This attitude never changed in Islam (concept of profit sharing in Islam does not really work well). On the other hand, something else happened in Christianity. The late middle age saw an important development, the formation of business as a distinct entity than the people who floated the business. (This concept of distinct entity itself originated from colleges such as Oxford established by the Church and allowed to have an existence distinct from the sponsoring Church.) The Church soon recognized a major problem with this development, the principles of  *damnum emergens (*Loss occurring) and *lucrum cessans* (profit ceasing). These principles recognize the fact that people who lend money to a business are taking the risk. Further, if the lenders had invested money themselves then they would have earned profits which they are now foregoing. It is natural to conclude from this that people need incentive to lend to for-profit organizations. Trade and Commerce is not going to flourish unless finance becomes available to businesses. The Church contextualized and concluded that since the concept of ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô did not really exist during the times of Christ, it is acceptable to modify his command and make money lending acceptable as long as the money is being lent to businesses. This availability of finance kick-started the age of Capitalism in Europe. This is one of the major reasons why European powers achieved global supremacy. Imagine starting and running a business without a loan. It is important to note that the Church still makes the distinction between money lending to Business and individuals, with money lending to individuals still banned in Christianity.\n\nMoney lending to business is important since it allows businesses to grow and create jobs. Everyone as a result enjoys a better standard of living. On other hand stunted business activity means fewer jobs. This in turn breeds poverty and becomes a breeding ground for extremist elements.\n\nThe process of contextualization in Islam was happening during the life of Mohammad. The so-called contradictory verses in Koran are examples of contextualization. For example, Mohammad did say initially that a man should only take one wife. However, later during the wars with the Meccan tribe when the number of men in Ummah (the whole community of Muslims bound together by ties of religion and which does not recognize national boundaries. ) depleted, he had to allow men to take more wives. Without this decision there was no way Ummah was going to survive. \n\nWhat exactly happened that Christianity embraced contextualization, but Islam did not? The answer lies in what happened after the death of both prophets.\n\nLet us begin with Christianity. \n\nBefore there was contextualization, there was allegory. We know that the concept of allegory started with the Greeks, perhaps with the works of Homer.  Wikipedia best defines allegory as follows - ‚ÄúWriters and speakers typically use allegories to convey (semi-)hidden or complex meanings through symbolic figures, actions, imagery, or events, which together create the moral, spiritual, or political meaning the author wishes to convey.‚Äù  Perhaps it is not surprising that allegory started with theatrical work. \n\nContextualization is an extension of allegory. It provides justification to re-interpret the stories in the scriptures to make them more aligned with changing socio-economic circumstances. It makes sure that the religion does not remain stagnant. This is exactly how, in the example above, moneylending was re-interpreted. Without this re-interpretation, the religion becomes stagnant and is unable to face challenges of modern society. Lack of moneylending is one such example where Islam does not differentiate between money lending to people and money lending to businesses.\n\nWith Christianity (I am basically talking of Catholicism, the largest branch of Christianity), after the death of Christ the religion was shaped by Saint Paul and Saint Augustine of Hippo. In fact, Saint Paul shaped Christianity so much that it is even said that Christianity is a religion of Saint Paul as much as of Jesus. Saint Paul as well as Saint Augustine were well versed in Greek Philosophy and they made sure that Christianity became compatible with classical Greeks such as Plato and Aristotle leading to opening the doors for contextualization. We can see a similar process in Judaism as well where the concept of allegory being introduced around the time of Jesus Christ. We also see the influence of Allegory and Contextualization in Shia‚Äôs of Iran who retain Greek influence.  Shia‚Äôs (unlike Sunnis) believe that Hadith (the life stories of Mohammad) are open for re-interpretation. It is not a surprise that of all Muslim countries Iran is perhaps the most developed country with a large industrial base. In this respect Shia‚Äôs enjoy the same advantage that the Christians had, exposure to Greek philosophy. Iran had deep ties with Greece. In military matters they might be adversarial but there is no doubt that Greeks have had a big influence on Iranian culture. Even in modern times, Ayatollah Khomeini was fascinated with Plato and Aristotle. These two philosophers are part of education for Shiite clergy of Iran even today.\n\nLet us look at Islam now. The reason why contextualization did not happen in Islam was that Arabia before Mohammad did not have a rich history in Philosophy and no Greek influence. Arabia before Mohammad consisted mostly of warring, revengeful tribes. They had a little concept of civilized, sedimentary society (apart from a few exceptions such as Mecca). World was not exactly a peaceful place during the medieval period. However, Arabia with its blood thrusting cruelty stands out even during the violent period. Simply speaking there was no one in Arabia capable of understanding the real message of Mohammad and carrying forward the tradition of contextualization after the death of Mohammad.\n\nThus, we can see how lack of contextualization has paid a big role in what we see happening in Muslim countries today.\n\nHow does this explain the golden period of Islam during which numerous scientific discoveries were made? This period lasted from 9th century to 12th century AD and prima facie, contradicts everything that is said so far here. Baghdad was the scientific center of the world during this period and came to an end in the middle of the 13th century when Baghdad was overrun by Mongols. \n\nSo how did this golden period start and how did it come to an end and the progress was lost? Muslims generally tend to blame Mongols who they claimed to be barbarians that were largely responsible for this event. However, when we start looking into details, we see certain fundamental reasons why this Golden Period came into existence and why it withered away. First and foremost, there is an important distinction between scientific discoveries in Muslim world and Christian world. Science in Christian world was heavily promoted by the Church (More on this below). Compare this with Muslim world where science was promoted by the kings. Royal dynasties are short-lived. When science is supported by the royal degree then it will wither away once the royal patronage is lost.  Compared to the royal decrees, religious traditions last for a very long time and if religion supports science then the effects are felt over a longer period.\n\nIn Muslim world the discoveries were localized in Bagdad to the Abbasid Caliphate and started with sponsorship by Harun-Al-Rashid. This kingdom had a lot of Persian influence. This is important to note since Persians as mentioned above retained a lot of Greek influence. The push to scientific glory in Baghdad started with translation of Greek scientific work and was done mostly by Christians, Jews and other people of the book (people of the book refers to religion other than Islam that are mentioned in Quran) such as Sabians. The state sponsored golden age in Baghdad was started by these people who had a knowledge of Greek and hence Greek science. For e.g. Al-Battani (858 AD - 929 AD) was a Harranian and a renowned astronomer as well as mathematicians who produced several trigonometrical relationships during the golden period of Islam. \n\nSince science was sponsored by the king, this inspired next generation of Muslim thinkers and scientists who naturally wanted to better their life in the court of the king. This generation carried forward the science from its Greek routes to new heights. Unfortunately, Muslim religion became stronger as the golden age progressed. As the religion became stronger, so did the fundamentalist Islamists. These fundamentalists never shared any scientific traditions and once Mongols destroyed Baghdad there was never any revival of science in the Muslim world. The only exception to this decline is that of health-science since Mohammad himself had opined about the importance of good health in the Koran.\n\nLet us now understand Christianity and the role of the Church in the development of science. This is where we can see how St Paul and St Augustine of Hippo shaped Christianity and the role of contextualization. They adapted the thinking that God has created nature. Hence, the study of nature aka science, is the study of god (We can see the influence of Plato in this line of thinking). Everything that happens, for e.g. sickness has two causes, secondary cause is something that has gone wrong which can be corrected temporarily like a virus infection. However, the primary cause is the fundamental force of nature which can only be unleashed by god. The thinking being that there should not be any problem with investigating the secondary causes.  \n\nThis leads to us to the next question. We can see that Christian countries suddenly dominated world commerce starting with 1300 AD. What was Christian world doing before 1300 AD?\n\nImportant thing to understand is that when we say the dominance of Christian countries, we are talking about Western Europeans. Not Eastern Europeans, not Syriac Christians. \n\nOne important distinction to note is that unlike Eastern Europeans or Syriac, Western Europe was dominated by Catholics and it was Catholic Church that actively kept the traditions of interpretations and secondary reasons alive prior to this period. It was the Church that founded the universities such as Oxford and Cambridge. It is a great misconception that Catholic church blocked science during the dark ages. In fact, Catholics were so influential for the development of science that almost every scientist in the Christian world was associated with the Church and most of them were priests themselves.\n\nAfter the fall of Roman empire by 4rth century AD, Western Europe was occupied by various tribes such as Goths, Vandals, Jutes, Angles, Saxons to name a few. We know these people today as French, Germans, British, Scandinavians etc. These tribes during those times were Pagans and spoke their own languages. This meant after the fall of Rome the knowledge of Greek was completely lost and entire Western Europe was deprived of ancient Greek knowledge and scientific discoveries in Europe mostly stalled. By the 7th century AD, Catholic Church had converted most of these tribes to Christianity, and we do see development in science throughout this period. Granted that most advances during this period in Europe were technological in nature with significance on day to day life. For example, major improvements were made in plows used for agriculture, crop rotation, water mill, windmills. We also see improvements in fighting technology such as horse stirrup, collar, horseshoes etc.\n\nWhat happened in 1100 AD is the discovery of Greek science and culture. Prior to this period, Western world had heard about the Greek civilization but did not have access to the culture or discoveries of the Greeks. During 1100 AD Western world found out that most Greek scientific books were translated into Persian during Islamic golden age and were preserved. This led to a tremendous effort to translate Persian Greek works back into Western European languages leading to massive explosion of science and culture in Western Europe. We commonly know this period as Renaissance. Other branches of Christianity did not have the principle of contextualization and hence the religion in this case strictly limited advances in science. \n\nAs you can see contextualization has played a very important role in Christianity and how contextualization keeps religion compatible with modern values.\n\nThis does not mean that Christianity was completely free of blemishes. For e.g. it certainly bears responsibility for sanctioning of slavery (this is another long discussion but slavery sanctioned around 1500 AD is the one that really needs to be blamed).. However, largely we can see that Christianity has been self-correcting so far thanks to the ability of contextualize.\n\nIt seems things are changing in the world of Islam as well. The changes, though small, are very promising. Feminist movements within Islam are growing. This makes sense since women enjoyed a lot of freedom during the life of Mohammad. The Musawah movement is one such example of a movement that strives for equality and justice within the framework of the Koran. Let us hope that movements such as Musawah continue to grow and capture a mindshare. Let is hope that Islam will finally revert to it‚Äôs core message of equality, justice and peace as preached by Mohammad.\n\nLet us hope that all Muslims embrace the concept of contextualization soon. \n\nCredits: Whatever I have mentioned above, the thoughts are not mine. All I have done is to borrow ideas of others, consolidate them and put it in a narrative form to understand why the development of two great religions have been so at odds to each other. I have used many books to formulate my thoughts put forward in the article above. First and foremost I must mention ‚ÄòHeretic‚Äô by ‚ÄòAyaan Hirsi Ali‚Äô. This book introduces the concept of Islam of Mecca and Islam of Medina and opined strongly why Islam needs to go back to its roots in Mecca. ‚ÄòAslan Reza‚Äô in his fabulous work ‚ÄòGod but no god‚Äô explains Islam and the early life in Mohammad in great details. ‚ÄòMohammad and the believers‚Äô by ‚ÄòFred M Donner‚Äô turned out to be an interesting read. ‚ÄòIn the shadow of the sword‚Äô by ‚ÄòTom Holland‚Äô portrays a vivid picture of Mediterranean and Arab world before the rise of Islam. ‚ÄòGenesis of Science‚Äô by James Hannam expels the myth of non-development of science in Europe during dark ages and proves beyond doubt, how the Church promoted science. ‚ÄòHeirs to Forgotten Kingdoms‚Äô by Gerald Russel is a fascinating narrative of religious diversity in Middle east and in part explains how Greek theory survived in Muslim world. ‚ÄòAladdin‚Äôs lamp‚Äô by John Freely is an interesting narrative of how Greek Science travelled to Europe through Muslim world. ‚ÄòWhat went wrong‚Äô by ‚ÄòBernard Lewis‚Äô is an interesting take on the same subject. For those with a background in Science, I would recommend ‚ÄòScience in Translation ‚Äì Movement of knowledge through cultures and time‚Äô by ‚ÄòScott Montgomery‚Äô who himself is a physicist and narrates in abundant details how science moved from Greece to Europe through Muslim world. ‚ÄòHow Greek Science Passed to the Arabs‚Äô by De Lacy O‚ÄôLeary, though having elements of European superiority complex, has a lot of details on the spread of Greek science at a political level. Ancient Greek Civilization by Jeremy McInerney (The great courses) is a definitive guide on Greeks of classical era and earlier. Christianty by Diarmald MacCulloch is highly recommended reading for someone interested in the history of Christianity as a religion.  Finally, ‚ÄòNabeel Qureshi‚Äô in his book ‚ÄòAnswering Jihad‚Äô provided the partial solution to this complex problem."<br />Author: 'hdeshp'<br />id: 'nny3c9'<br />Flair :National üì∞</li>

<li>Title: 'Prepare for the June 1st alien reveal - take down abrahamic religions in India.'<br />Body: 'Abrahamic religions are the result of something like a deity who used a \ngross distortion of the truth to gain devotees, created\na "heaven" which is just a storage unit for souls/spirits\nto do with as he wants for whatever reason. There is likely no singular entity \nknown as satan/shaitan, etc., or if there is, the deity was\nfueding and ascribed all chaotic aspects on it. \nThe deity is known as El, Allah, etc. Yahweh is apparantely subordinate. \nI can\'t find the source where I read this, but many people who go on trips, DMT or something similar, \nrecall encountering serpents, and not just the Ayahuasca serpent. Some encounter \na cosmic serpent who reveals "secrets" that he escaped from some things to earth eons ago \nand has been hiding here ever since, affecting the evolution of life here. It\'s strongly believed\nthat Yahweh appears as a dragon to people. Are these deities collecting us for war?\n\nAbrahamic religions aren\'t entirely without merit.\nOccasionally, some people are able to get closer to a truth than the religions normally allow.\nThat\'s how Wa·∏•dat al-wuj≈´d managed to develop, and comes far closer to a truth than islam normally permits.\nIt is slowly being revealed that some higher beings seem to \nconsider us as vessels/containers. Yes, I\'m talking about alien\nencounters. You should pay more attention to what\'s gonna be \nrevealed on June 1st. Perhaps, the beings want to experience\nenhanced human life. There are interpretations of the bible that\nsay heaven is supposed to appear on earth - meaning they want to\nexperience earth. However, this ultimately means that these beings are\nstill tied to our physical world in a specific way.\n\nThere are so many different paths to take. Abrahamic religions, under \nfalse pretenses and artificial introduced language limitations (https://www.quora.com/If-Allah-means-God-why-then-does-the-Quran-in-many-places-say-that-There-is-no-God-but-Allah-and-not-There-is-no-other-God-but-Allah), \nlike "There is no God but God" -&gt; "There is no God but Allah" -&gt;\n"There is no Allah but Allah!?", limit what we can do and tie us to some uppity deity. And what\'s worse\nis that they have proven to be extremely mentally limiting. Look at what it \ndid to muslims. So many among them are the most simple-minded dronish people in the world,\nunable to think deeply on subjects. Those who historically did think deep\nwere either killed off for leaving islam, kept quiet about no longer being muslim,\nor managed to escape to nonmuslim lands. Christians managed to become uppity ecocidal maniacs who idiotically ruined the world and still think they are perfect.\nJews largely managed to escape this fate because genetic selection from persecution made them too smart to \nbe limited by their beliefs.\n\n\nThis is rambling, and not formatted well, but I had to say it in time and I‚Äôm having reddit technical issues.'<br />Author: 'throwaway941285'<br />id: 'nnx5ro'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihaad_Halal Certified</li>

<li>Title: 'Regarding recent controversy over veganism and milk'<br />Body: "I am a proud hindu, I love all animals(specially cows) and go to shelters to care for them.\n\nI am also a vegan, and don't use animal products like milk, cheese, leather, wool, fur etc.\n\nYou might be wondering why don't I drink milk, despite milk being an integral part of our culture and even lord Krishna drinking milk, I will explain why.\n\nToday's milk industry is not the same one it used to be in our ancestor's times, it has changed drastically. For a cow to give milk, she has to be pregnant, and she only gives milk for 9-12 months after having a baby. So, she needs to be pregnant every year to constantly produce milk, often, dairy farmers use artificial insemination to make cow pregnant. As the cow produces milk for her child and humans want her milk, they will separate her calf and send him to **slaughterhouse**, the milk made for the calf will be taken and given to humans. \n\nIf lord krishna were here, he would've cried seeing the poor conditions of cows and ask us to be a vegan, he protected cows first, then drank milk, Here are some videos which will help you Understand how milk is made better. [Local Farms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX7icGuF3sE), [Cruelty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ant7lkXUIeA), [Khal baccha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74rgN4fff_g)\n\nAlso, India is largest exporter of beef in the world, where do you think this Beef comes from? It comes from old cows/buffaloes and male calves. Leather and beef industries are thriving despite being illegal. Milk and beef industries are sides of the same coin. Even if some cows manage not to be killed, they are left on streets to eat plastic and die, the way we can end all this suffering is by drinking [Plant Milks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5iKxcSNnQw), I personally make coconut milk at home. If we stop drinking milk and using cheese, demand for milk will go down, and more animals will not be bred into existence for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAsk me anything you want to ask, please be civil(no abuses or trolls)"<br />Author: 'One_Walrus_4153'<br />id: 'nni5uu'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

We will set the internet right for generations to come, and this, is just the very beginning.\n\nWe will call ourselves Hindu Sainiks, our identities will forever be unknown and one sainik will never know the others, except by a Sainik ID we will assign to ourselves so that we may recognize ourselves in the wild and on the battlefield. Our anonymity will be our strongest weapon and every sainik will be trained with highest degree on remaining anonymous for our own security.\n\nApplying to join the Hindu Mahasena will be referral based so one Hindu sainik can recruit more Hindu sainiks and so on so forth. We will assimilate out of nothingness and destroy anti-hindu content in a way that they won\'t know what hit them. No matter who the target is, our anonymity allows us to systematically disrupt the internet ecosystem of Adharmiks, once and forever.\n\nI am in contact with Hindu Influencers beyond reddit to also recruit Sainiks in this dharmayudha - so rest assured, we\'ll have a lot of power and lot of sainiks.\n\nEverything will be done, we\'ll achieve everything and far beyond what is written down below. But remember, it won\'t happen in a day, so don\'t expect to be making visible changes in a day. Stick with the Army and in 2 months we\'ll make visible change and in 2 years we\'ll be controlling the media narrative and also posses political power. It will only be made possible by selfless dedication towards the cause and continuous participation. When we\'re beginning we\'ll probably only be able to conduct small strikes and one at a time, but we\'ll keep growing because I\'m contacting many influencers with 50k+ followings and others which will help us get more numbers. This will also be known as the Great Hindu Renaissance for generations to come. \n\nHere are just some of the things we\'ll work on:\n\n1. Destruction of the Internet, as a safe haven for Anti-Hindu content and propaganda - All Social Medias included.\n2. Complete annihilation of the Anti-India propagators - this is the greatest thing we\'ll be doing and you\'ll see this make the highest amount of impact in the shortest amount of time, but I won\'t mention in right here, it will be revealed as we go. We\'ll use wokeism the right way!\n3. Undoing of the propaganda embedded into the education system of India by christian missionaries, librandus and sickulars.\n4. Spreading of the teachings of the Shrimad Bhagwad Gita and reconnecting modern day youths with our past so they are better informed about our own country and it\'s history and don\'t get bamboozled by stupid westerners.\n5. Spreading and having a cultural and traditional celebrations and a non apologetic fascist Hindu approach.\n6. Making Hindus realize that "modern" day scientific narrative is already known to Hindus since millennia.\n7. Promote how the government is actually doing things to help and develop India and thereby destroying the nihilistic and defeatist narrative put forward by librandus that government is "doin\' nothin\' "\n8. Cancelling all Hindu phobic companies no matter how small. We will make people think twice before daring to say anything that derogates us.\n9. Make it cool to be a religious, cultural and traditional Hindu rather than some whacky zero knowledge uncultured westernized rebel.\n10. Undo the monopoly of western science over Hindu religious teachings, our values and our beliefs.\n\nWe\'ll be doing all this and one step at a time and we\'ll never know when we ended up climbing the Everest. Of course beginning will be slow and laggy but we will only get better and better.\n\nThese are just some of the things we\'ll be doing when we\'re just starting out, as we grow and accumulate more members and voices we\'ll be making impacts on real life politicians and even have politicians affirming to HinduMahasena, journalists etc this is just the beginning of the Great Hindu Revolution. \n\nIn the future, we will be having real life political influence and a control over narrative and media. Now we\'re just assembling and forming. \n\nLet the anti nationals know that they\'ll be paying for each and every thing.\n\n# Join HinduMahasena \n\nSo, here\'s the first step of this part one - Creation and Assimilation of Hindu Army!\n\nHere\'s very basic 1st step what you need to do to join the HinduMahasena and stay anonymous: \n\nDo these on your mobile \n\n^(These steps are not all compulsory, you may directly skip to Step 5 after Step 1)\n\n1. Choose a 6 digit alphanumeric code for yourself it will be your Sainik ID. Ex: 2dq16r or any such code that you can remember.\n2. Download ProtonMail App and create a new mail account with your Sainik ID, so for example you\'re mail id should look like \\[SainikID\\]@protonmail.ch - choose the .ch extension rather than .com one!\n3. Download ProtonVPN App create a account with the ProtonMail ID.\n4. Activate VPN at all times - it is a full speed VPN and will not reduce your speed. Keep it activated at all time if possible.\n5. Download Element Messaging App App - signup with ProtonMail ID |Element is a blockchain based decentralized encrypted messaging app much safer than even Signal|\n6. Complete creating your account on Element\n7. When done, click here to Join the HinduMahasena space ^((Link in comments)) this space is temporary to filter out librandus from joining us. A simple quick verification and I\'ll share a link to the real space!\n\n^(/End of step 1)\n\n# Next Step\n\nOnce we all have assimilated in the Element and verified, duties will be assigned to each one of us. We will have people to find Anti-Hindu content and targets, we\'ll have people to create weapons (Finding Data, Memes, Narratives etc) on the target, we\'ll have a central planning space where future course of actions will be decided and strikes will be conducted against anti-hindus, that is, attack conducted so strongly on the online presence of such people that it will be impossible for them to live on the internet with any dignity, and that\'s just one type of strike. We\'ll also be defining our cultural, traditional and religious goals in further details in the next part on Element Messaging App.\n\nThis is just 10% of the whole plan, execution and fun comes next!\n\nThat\'s all for this Bhratas, in next 48 hours I\'ll reach out to many people beyond Reddit and try to get as many as people as possible. Only the 1st step is a bit lengthy due to it being a "Setup Step"\n\nI would love to see you on the Element Space Bhratas! This is the beginning of the Hindu Revolution that will navigate this country away from libralism, anti-cultural, anti-tradtional and vicious woke culture. We can save our country now before many are affected - let\'s not fall in the trap of Comfort Coma.\n\nI would like to end this post with a quote from Shrimad Bhagwad Gita:\n\n&gt;*"Why this lifeless inaction in the hour of trial? Hopeless inaction wins neither heaven nor fame. When destruction stares at you in the face and truth looks to you for protection of dharma and victory of religion, how can you display such cowardice? Strong men do not loose themselves in hopelessness. In this war of Dharma and Adharma and at this hour of trial, do not become impotent. Doubts and hopeless inactions are un-aryan, they will throw you out of Heaven and you will hate yourself for this inaction. This Dharmayudha is yours and the outcome of this Dharmayudha are also yours, so it\'s your duty to decide what you will do. Rise above your individuality and fight for what is right for the greater good of society and future generations."* \n\nAlright Bhratas, See you on the Element Space!\n\nJai Shree Ram!'<br />Author: 'ResistWokeness'<br />id: 'nnguig'<br />Flair ::cshivajim: VirArt</li>

<li>Title: 'Regarding the WhatsApp issue'<br />Body: "Many people have been wondering if the government's going to be able to read our messages now that Whatsapp would have to agree to tracing messages of concern. I wanted to add my own opinion towards this issue as to why I think this should be a cause of concern for us. \n\nFirst, lemme talk a bit about the e2e encryption in WhatsApp. It's the same rsa algorithm which banks use to send otp's and by organizations to send encoded messages. The messages are encoded using 2 huge prime numbers (one secret key from each device and one public key) (100's of digits in each), so to decrypt one would need to know the secret key for the recipient which is theoretically impossible. One would have an easier time guessing the secret key. \n\nNow the I adress the issue at hand. According to the encryption system, no one except the sender and reciever can view the message. Only other exception is the parent app: WhatsApp, which can employ a spying system in place. So if the government did try to spy on our messages, then they'd have to take control over whatsapp and if they do get our messages then that'd mean that WhatsApp is actually keeping in place a spying system because there's no other way WhatsApp could keep a record of the actual messages that we sent. I believe this issue which WhatsApp raised actually shows how WhatsApp is keeping a record of our messages.\n\nSo as I've stated that no one can actually see our messages, now we wonder as to how whatsapp can provide the original location of a text sender. Simple, I believe that it can be done by locating the area from where a server request came for sending the concerned message. This system has actually been in place in Facebook and Twitter for a long time wherein people have been located through their posts/tweets. \n\nOne more flaw I'd like to address is that the gov will only be tracing messages which come under it's highlight. So a message would actually have to be mass forwarded and that message would have to be a part of a criminal plan. So it's not the case that our daily messages between peers is something that the government would trace and even if it did, they would have to go through the judiciary (which acts as an independent body).\n\nNow, I'll highly appreciate whatever you guys have to say and I'd like to have a proper discussion regarding this issue."<br />Author: 'absman00700'<br />id: 'nn5slp'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

<li>Title: "India's soft power and the potential of video games and movies"<br />Body: "With culture and tradition as deep layered as ours, it surprises me that we as a country don't invest much in video games and movies. Imo these mediums of entertainment can really help enhance our soft power and attract even more investors into the country. For instance, just look at countries such as the United States and Japan. Through movies and games they have created this utopia esque image of their countries in the minds of millions of people and because of that, many people are attracted to go there and live (yes their economic prowess also helps) I am quite baffled tbh that we don't showcase our culture and mythologies neither on the big screen nor on gaming platforms(I would legit play games related to Mahabharata or Ramayana or an open world game set in New Delhi). Even when its done its done quite poorly(just look at bollywood for instance). Our government is really missing out in terms of projecting their strengths and showcasing their brand to the rest of the world and imo its ample time for them to start investing in these forms of entertainment. What do you all think tho?"<br />Author: 'sr2003'<br />id: 'nn4no7'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li></ol>
