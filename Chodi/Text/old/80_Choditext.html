<li>Title: 'Sanskrit- The viable alternate to English as connector language'<br />Body: "Listen up Mahajans,\n\nSanskrit's glory has been a subject of scholarly debate in not just Virat Hindu circles but also even in staunchest Internationalist discussions. It is without a doubt was one of the most classical invention of Ancient India, probably of entire Ancient history.\nThere are manuscripts in museum and libraries all around the world which are yet to be compiled owing to the vastness of it.\nIt has influenced people from Thoreau and Mueller to Twain, Oppenheimer and Mendeleev.\n\nBut my idea is of realizing it as the connector language of India. Supporting arguments:\n1. It will help us reconnect with Our roots and understand the multi layered philosophy of Dharma more appropriately.\n2. It is directly connected to all Uttarpath languages: Hindi, Bengali, Dogri, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Assamese, Odia, and even Urdu. \n3. It is indirectly connected to 2/4 Dakshinpath languages to a very high degree. Tamil and Malayalm also have words from Sanskrit in their lexicon but the verbs(main building blocks of language) are non Sanskritic. \n4. It works well with the 2 language argument for all states. One local language and one national language. \n5. It was initially written in Brahmi, which is the mother of all scripts of India from Himalaya to Indian ocean(except Urdu), and of South East Asia. Thai, Laotian, Burmese, are to varying degrees have their scripts made from Brahmi. Brahmi can become Our connector script.\n\n\nNow the biggest issue: Scientific terminologies. \n\nMost of the scientific discoveries and technological advancement happened in West which made sure all chemicals, rocks, machines, are derived from them.\n\nA lot of them have words in Sanskrit like \nSurgery: Shalya-chikitsa\nMedicine: Aushadhi\nPhysician: Vaidya\nPhysics: Bhotiki\nChemistry: Rasayaniki, Rasayan Shastra\n\nBut these are quite inadequate.\nEspecially for things like Biological and Chemical nomenclature\nNow two path arise, \n1. We can directly write English terms in Sanskrit with same cognates. \n2. We can follow Chinese example and make Our own terms for it. They have completely rejected the Latin scheme of Biological names and made Mandarin terms for it but taking inspiration from them.\nSo, Mango = Mangifera Indika. Here Mangifera is genus name and Indika is species name(derived from Latin term for India)\n\nIt can become something like Aamram Bharatye\nCow - Bos Indika- Gau Bharatye\n\nNow remain biggest challenge area: Chemical nomenclature.\n\n\nWhat words can really replace say: Mitochondria or Diethyl Phosphate. \n\nIt is such a large area of cultural research that even 1 million Indians are not enough to explore it.\nChinese have done tremendous job in doing it. They only use Chinese derived terms for eveything, from Chemical, disease to sub atomic particles.\n\nWe can also make it happen, owing to the vast fluidity and vocabulary of Sanskrit. \n\nI am putting it out there for your thinking. Feel free to comment and criticize. It sounds ridiculous but if we ever wish to establish a Dharmic society, language must take great precedence."<br />Author: 'helmuthxz'<br />id: 'gcxcsa'<br />Flair :Research</li>

<li>Title: 'The Upcoming India'<br />Body: 'Amid lockdown let\'s take a look at the major ongoing Mega projects in India\n\n# INFRASTRUCTURE:\n\nThe most important aspect of a country\'s economic growth, There are a lot of huge infrastructure projects going on in India.\n\n**1. SAGARMALA PROJECT (OCEAN NECKLACE)**\n\n* It is an initiative by the government of India to enhance the performance of the country\'s logistics sector.  \n*  The Sagarmala Programme is the flagship programme of the Ministry of Shipping to promote port-led development in the country by exploiting India’s 7,500 km long coastline, 14,500 km of potentially navigable waterways and its strategic location on key international maritime trade routes. \n\n![img](g4losm0wygw41)\n\n![img](8kdtjpeyygw41)\n\n**2. BHARATMALA PROJECT**\n\n*  It is a centrally-sponsored and funded road and highways project of the GOI. \n*  The total investment for 83,677 km (51,994 mi) committed new highways is estimated at ₹5.35 lakh crore (US$77 billion), making it the single largest outlay for a government road construction scheme. \n\n![img](jnct22281hw41)\n\n![video](b3ji66ub1hw41)\n\n **3. Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC)** \n\n* 23 industrial hubs, 24 smart cities, two power plants, six airports, two ports and a six-lane expressway stretching 1,500km connecting the industrial cities of Delhi and Mumbai\n* time to transport goods from Delhi factories to shipping ports will reduce from 14 days to 14 hours\n* expected to create 25 million jobs in 7 years\n* one of the world’s largest infrastructure project with total project cost of $100 billion. Phase 1 planned to be completed by 2019\n\n![img](ix1m47y63hw41)\n\n![img](88181c1a5hw41)\n\n**4. A BOON FOR JAMMU AND KASHMIR- ZOJILA TUNNEL**\n\n* The Zoji La tunnel will be the longest bi-directional road tunnel in Asia. Its construction period will be five years because of a very difficult terrain where in some areas the temperature drops to minus 45 degree Celsius.\n* Planned as a smart tunnel, it will have the latest safety features such as fully transverse ventilation system, uninterrupted power supply, emergency lighting, CCTV monitoring, variable message signs, traffic logging equipment and tunnel radio system.\n* The civil construction cost of the project is Rs.49 billion. The total capital cost of the project is Rs.68 billion. It includes the cost of land, resettlement and rehabilitation and other pre-construction activities as well as maintenance and operation cost of the tunnel for four years.\n* Defense forces have to face a hard time ensuring supplies to border posts during winters across Zoji La pass which is most strategic for the entire Kargil sector which has seen intrusion and war in the past. The tunnel will help keep the highway open the entire year.\n\n![img](ls428gg35hw41)\n\n**5. Mumbai Ahmedabad Bullet Train:**\n\n* 508km high speed track, including 7km undersea tunnel\n* train speed of 320km/h, will reduce travel time between business-critical cities of Mumbai and Ahmedabad from 7 hrs to 2 hrs\n* planned to be operational by 2022\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](aky3w2v86hw41)\n\n![video](99xlu3ka6hw41)\n\n**6 By Far the most Ambitious project- The E-highway project of India**\n\n* The Indian Government is planning to trial an electric highway (e-highway) on the proposed Delhi-Mumbai expressway within the next three years to boost electric mobility in the country. \n* Gadkari said: “Trucks of 80t will be deployed and these will have electric cable to draw power from the overhead cable network. There will be two tracks and trucks with containers can run at 100km/h.\n* “The trucks will run on electricity for 20km and the battery will get charged to run on stretches where there is no overhead wire. Again, after some kilometres, these can tap the overhead wire and simultaneously get charged again while running.”\n\n![img](58qbqj0q7hw41)\n\n# TOURISM:\n\n**1.

<li>Title: 'Aarogya Setu : 45 organizations and more than 100 prominent individuals push back against the coercion Policy/Economy'<br />Body: ' 📷\n\nAarogya Setu : 45 organizations and more than 100 prominent individuals push back against the coercion\n\n[**Help IFF fight mass surveillance. Fund our work**](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/)**!**\n\nTl;dr\n\nToday, we sent a[ joint representation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ELi-Q9FG-eapNFEzVeuJqTROFFrUflT3/view?usp=sharing)  to the Prime Minister\'s Office that is endorsed by 45 organisations and  more than 100 individuals against the mandatory use of the Aarogya Setu  App dated May 1, 2020. This joint representation becomes all the more  urgent given yesterday\'s [direction by the Home Ministry](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wXzfI9uPv0Qr4YZBKXwk_1Z1M2skYfzl/view?usp=sharing)  for the mandatory use of Aarogya Setu and for it\'s "100% coverage"  especially in all workplaces. Violation of this direction can lead to  criminal penalties thereby Aarogya Setu now not only impacts the data  privacy of workers, or can lead to risks of exclusion and  misidentification, a person not having it on their phone can also be  charged with a criminal offence. This marks a dramatic and clear shift  in government policy on Aarogya Setu from, "encouragement" towards  coercion and increases the legitimacy of the demands articulated by the  joint representation.\n\nA joint representation co-signed by 45 organisations and more than 100 people\n\nIn [yesterday\'s post](https://internetfreedom.in/workers-privacy-during-covid-19/)  we released a joint representation signed by 37 organisations and 75  individuals against mandating the use of the Aarogya Setu on workers.  After we opened it for further sign-ons this number has grown to 45  organisations and more than 100 individuals who have expressed  solidarity against the mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu on workers.  The endorsements are from a broad swathe of Indian society including  trade unions, people\'s movements, digital rights organizations, public  health experts, former civil servants and bureaucrats, activists,  academics, technologists, journalists, lawyers etc.\n\nA copy of the [joint representation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ELi-Q9FG-eapNFEzVeuJqTROFFrUflT3)  was sent today with a covering letter to the Prime Minister\'s Office  with a copy to Ministry of Home Affairs and other central government  ministries.\n\nTo this we attached [a covering letter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RR3tBnJCSkQvSDp0uVcMQr6C2RILgqg4/view?usp=sharing)  dated May 2, 2020 which further notes with concern yesterday evening\'s  development of the issuance of Order No 40-3/2020-DM-I(A) has been  issued on May 1, 2020 around 6:00 PM by the Ministry of Home Affairs  requiring mandatory installation of Aarogya Setu. This goes against the  core demands of the joint representation which is attached to this  covering letter.\n\nAarogya Setu : Not only mandatory but also criminal penalties\n\nThe  Order No 40-3/2020-DM-I(A), which has been issued under Section  10(2)(I) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 mandates for the mandatory  installation and operation of Aarogya Setu in two specific ways:\n\n1. First,  after classification of the districts into three zones, for the Red  (Hotspots) Zones, a further sub-classification has been made for, “*containment zones*”. As per the Order under Section 3(iii), “*The local authority shall ensure 100% coverage of Aarogya Setu app among the residents of Containment Zones*”.\n2. Second, at Para 15(i) further reference is made for, “*all the district magistrates*” to, “*strictly enforce the lockdown measures*” for, “*public and workplaces, as specified in Annexure I*”. This direction extends to all three zones. Annexure I further states at Point No. 15 that, “*Use  of Aarogya Setu app shall be made mandatory for all employees, both  private and public. It shall be responsibility of the Head of the  respective Organisations to ensure 100% coverage of this app among  employees*”.\n\nPresently  here are no exceptions or conditionality provided in these directions  which place emphasis on 100% coverage in effect meaning total and  complete mandatory installation of Aarogya Setu for all workers, all  across the country. The order further indicates criminal penalties for  non-compliance in Paragraph No. 16 that states, “*Any  person violating these lockdown measures and the National Directives  for Covid-19 Management will be liable to be proceeded against as per  the provision of Section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005,  besides legal action under Section 188 of the IPC and other legal  provisions as applicable*”. The specific provision that may be  attracted for prosecution under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 is  Section 51(b) that provides for a maximum punishment of up to 1 year for  disobedience, and 2 years when such actions may lead to a loss of life.  The penalty for conviction under Section 188 of the IPC extends to 6  months imprisonment.\n\nHence, the  mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu is not only an issue of data  privacy but second order harms which spring from it now includes loss of  urban mobility, use of public spaces and transit, livelihood and  personal liberty for millions of Indians all over India. Specially those  without smartphones devices given the lack of any exemption categories.\n\nIntention for further action\n\nWe  at IFF in continuation of this Joint Representation dated May 1, 2020  and through this covering letter have requested specific review of Order  No 40-3/2020-DM-I(A) and will also be shortly reaching out to each one  of the co-signees and collaborators urging them to send individual  letters of concern as much as examine further advocacy actions against  this grave breach.\n\nWe also remain  open to any suggestions and advice on what we can do better, or  different not only through our collaborators, but even members of the  public. We invite you to write to us, or discuss these issues over at  the [Internet Freedom Forum](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/).\n\nAs  stated before we at IFF will continue conducting public advocacy,  awareness especially through digital media as well as continue to engage  pro-actively with all government institutions on the issues concerning  Aarogya Setu. This includes representations, RTI requests as well as  other legal remedies which may be examined at an appropriate stage in  consultation with IFF\'s legal team and several lawyers who continue to  volunteer thier time and labour towards protecting fundamental rights.\n\nWe  remain committed working with more organisations and individuals to  broaden the scope and improve the impact of interventions around Aarogya  Setu. Please do feel free to reach out to us.\n\nImportant Documents\n\n1.

Its construction period will be five years because of a very difficult terrain where in some areas the temperature drops to minus 45 degree Celsius.\n* The project aims at construction of 14.2\xa0km long two-lane bi-directional single tube tunnel with a parallel 14.2\xa0km long egress tunnel. The western portal is at [Baltal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltal,_Jammu_and_Kashmir) at about 3,000\xa0m altitude (about 400\xa0m lower than the altitude of the existing highway there), about 15\xa0km east of Sonmarg. The eastern portal after Zoji La is at Minamarg towards the Dras / Kargil end. The length of the tunnel does not include the lengths of the approach roads to both ends of the tunnel from the existing highway.\n* Planned as a smart tunnel, it will have the latest safety features such as fully transverse ventilation system, uninterrupted power supply, emergency lighting, CCTV monitoring, variable message signs, traffic logging equipment and tunnel radio system.\n* The safety features will include emergency telephones and fire-fighting cabinets at every 125 metre, pedestrian cross-passages at every 250 metre and motorable cross passages and lay-bye at every 750 metre.\n* The civil construction cost of the project is Rs.49 billion. The total capital cost of the project is Rs.68 billion. It includes the cost of land, resettlement and rehabilitation and other pre-construction activities as well as maintenance and operation cost of the tunnel for four years.\n* Defense forces have to face a hard time ensuring supplies to border posts during winters across Zoji La pass which is most strategic for the entire Kargil sector which has seen intrusion and war in the past. The tunnel will help keep the highway open the entire year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9okr4we4qcw41.png?width=798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42d4221dad689ebdbf405674be1f3e635ac0134d\n\n***And by far the most ambitious and undisputed infrastructure project of India***\n\n# 6.

Don't be aggressive, if someone replies in anger or a derogatory manner, ignore him or just give him the \\*hands folded\\* emoji, some people will try to provoke you by using wrong facts or misinterpretations of facts .Remember, the aim is to spread awareness about our own culture to people who are willing to learn about it or people who aren't really keen but wouldn't mind learning about it. Unfortunately there will be some people who are so brainwashed that they wouldn't care even if you post the greatest archaeological findings from our culture, so just don't mind them. You don't know how much effect this is going to have in long term. Instead of posting polarizing content, keep it subtle.\n\nThe reason the content should not be polarizing is that many of you might be having jobs/careers which might be affected badly if you post hard-hitting Hindutva content. But posting about your own culture instead of demonizing the others is better, since no one can then accuse you of being a bigot etc.\n\nAssuming that chodi has about 1k regular members and about half of them use social media regularly,  if 400-500 people share these posts daily, subconsciously, there will slowly develop a sense of enlightenment and attachment towards our Sanatani culture.\n\nIn short: Read title."<br />Author: 'PotentialBattle'<br />id: 'gc298f'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>

Also, why does every onw hink that we ran away from the Muslim invasions? There are many upper caste people in Uttarakhand because we simply are not natives and were imported from Kannauj and West UP by the Hindu Katyuri and Chand kings to serve as administrators, priests, etc, etc. Only several families came from Rajasthan or Maharatshtra, and that too in the 1800s. Also, why does every mainland indian think we "intermarried" with the locals. I swear every anthropology forum users always classify people from Uttrakhand( even the brahmins) as "tibetid influenced" even if they look completely cuacassian or Desi (I even have seen people say Anushka Sharma looks East Asian). WHY? BRAHMINS DIDN\'T MARRY THOSE MONGOLOIDS OVER THERE FFS. We don\'t even want to associate with Tharus or Kirats or whatever, we would rather be south Indian than mongoloid. Just look at this website claiming us to be from the Plains and Maharatshtra : [https://dpuckjo8.wixsite.com/kumaon](https://dpuckjo8.wixsite.com/kumaon) .

They seem to be a couple of weeks away from saying that one of Rajiv Gandhi’s dreams was that India would never have a Bullet Train?\n\nIf MMS took himself seriously as an economist, he would know that in times of recession, it is for the government to spend money on large public projects.\n\nIndeed, when the Great Depression hit the United States in 1929, the government put people to work as part of a massive public works program. This came to be known as the “New Deal.” Under the formidable Franklin D Roosevelt, the US government created the Public Works Administration (PWA) in 1933. The PWA completed some of the most iconic infrastructure projects in the US, including the legendary Hoover Dam. The infrastructure that the US created in that decade laid the foundation of the post WW2 boom when the US began a 70 year reign as the world’s pre-eminent economic, military and industrial power\n\nIn fact, the economic crisis triggered by the Wuhan Coronavirus could be the moment for India to launch its own “New Deal.” This is the time to build those bullet trains, dams and super highways that could last us for several generations.\n\nAnd considering that the bullet train is financed with a near interest free loan from Japan, it’s a no brainer.\n\nIt is not difficult to imagine why the Congress is so obsessed with scrapping the Bullet Train and Central Vista. They are probably worried that India might end up with landmarks on which they won’t be able to stick the names of their one great dynasty. With no workers, no organization skills and no ideology, the Congress is just a brand name. Without everything being called “Jawahar this” or “Indira that” or “Rajiv Gandhi XYZ,” the Congress would have to shut down.\n\nIt’s bad enough that the Congress is being taunted for spending its decades in power allocating Bharat Ratnas rather than building toilets. What if tomorrow India has a bullet train and nobody gives credit to Rajiv Gandhi for dreaming it up? What would the Congress do then?\n\nBeware!'<br />Author: 'tushar_soni_01'<br />id: 'gbom93'<br />Flair :HQ Text Bakchodi</li>
<li>Title: "How the Demon possesses someone's body and mind."<br />Body: "Disclaimer: Long Post, have something to eat, and relax.\n\nSo recently I was watching the movie called Conjuring( 2013) in this movie there was a scene in which Ed Warren( one of the character) was giving a lecture on Demonic possession at a University, he says that each Demonic possession has three stages Infestation, Oppression, and Possession. I believe that the same analogy could be used for a Liberandu whose mind and body have been possessed by the Demon called Liberandunism, which an amalgam of pseudo-liberalism, pseudo-secularism, communism, hate for his country, Dharma and culture.\n\nInfestation which is the first stage where the victim( Liberandu) is introduced with the subtle Communist propaganda in the form of pop culture, education system, and social media. The Demon( Liberandunism) is so sly that it doesn't even show its presence but it is present everywhere. The demon preys on the most psychologically vulnerable beings, people who have no understanding of Dharma and the rich Indian culture and history, people who are politically ignorant. And once the demon gets its prey we would have our next stage, i.e. Oppression.\n\nIn Oppression the victim's mind is further filled with filth by the fellow Demon's worshippers( Liberandus). The Demon tries to break the will of the victim by giving him false theories viz Aryan Invasion Theory, How Muslims are our brother theory, How Brahmins have oppressed us theory, How great is Communism and bad is Capitalism theory etc. While the Demon is playing its game our victim would start showing the early signs of possession, he will start watching the videos of Dhruv Rathee, he will start following the Feministflowercrown, Sanitarypanels, fuckBJP, etc on Instagram. On Twitter, his favorite handles will be Rana Ayyub, Nidhi Razdan, Kunal Kamra, Swara Bhaskar, etc. These are the same people who have been previously possessed by the Demon and now the Demon will use the same possessed individuals to get more recruits. The victim could also be seen reading the works of Karl Marx and other communists, he could also be seen admiring Zakir Naik. The victim will start showing interest in Adharmic cultures and will start using phrases like Mudi bad reeee, Saffron Fascism reeee, RSS Conspiracy reeee. By the end of this stage, the victim will start shivering whenever someone who is not possessed starts giving his opinion or showing him the truth, which brings to us our third and final stage the Possession.\n\nNow in the Possession stage, the victim is now completely possessed by the demon, and just like a person possessed by the real demon stays away from anything which is Godly or Dharmic or Holy in the same way Liberandu will stay away from anything closely different from his demonic opinion. He won't participate in Poojas, starts criticizing and mocking Sanatani Gods, starts eating beef, or talks about eating beef. He would also start participating in Devil rituals like Anti CAA protests and starts singing Adharmic songs like the poem of Faiz. If you bring him inside a Temple or a dharmic place he will start showing the signs of withdrawal and will start shivering. Showing him the correct news and facts is like showing a possessed person a picture of Lord Hanuman. Words like RSS, IT Cell, Bhakt, Hindu Fascist, Nazi, Zionist, etc will become his constant companion. By this stage, it is too late to bring him back and now the Demon will use him to recruit more Liberandus.\n\nThe Demon is now everywhere, it has occupied each and every social media space and with each day with more and more recruits it is becoming more and more powerful.

You can\'t convince him no matter what.\n\nHe\'s an ex-NRI i.e. he used to stay in america but now came back to india for some reason.\n\nI\'ve had a few heated debates with him in the past. But this time I observed something VERY VERY INTERESTING!\n\n**I posted a screenshot of TrueIndology\'s instagram post**. It was photo of excavations of 9200 years old skeleton recently found in Serbia. It was special because the posture of that skeleton looked just like a yogi had taken mahasamdhi!\n\n**Now this had NOTHING at all to do with politics and was purely ARCHAEOLOGY!**\n\nHe made a very vulgur comment on that. I ignored and then I posted few other archaelogical/historical proofs of ancient India in the group (e.g. 3000 year old pipeline recently found in Gujarat, Ramayana proofs, etc.\n\nHe was pissed once again and here\'s the biggest joke. He said and I quote, **"This is an RSS conspiracy"!**\n\n**Can u fking believe that?**\n\nWhen I asked how did he come to that conclusion, he obviously had no answers. He seemed very frustrated but couldn\'t call me bhakt or sanghi as the posts were absolutely non political.\n\n**So here\'s the new strategy:**\n\nBURN THE FKING LIBRANDS WITH MORE ARHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL PROOFS!\n\nPour ancient Indian content on their head so much that it must haunt them in their dreams and they can\'t stop themselves but believe it.\n\nNow I\'ve even started posted about true indology\'s - Akbar and Birbal Stories are fake, Akbar had 300 wives and none of them was Jodha or my personal research on 32,000 year old Dwarka excavations found, Kailasa Temple architecture, etc and he has been burning like nothing else. And he can\'t even call me out.\n\nI fking love this strategy.\n\n**1 tir se 2 nishan**\n\nSo I request all of you to take time and post archaeological and historical proofs of the ancient hindu civilization in your whatsapp groups, stories, instagram, etc.\n\nNobody is going to call you a bhakt or sanghi.\n\nAnd if someone asks why you \'suddenly\' started posting this kind of stuff, then say "I came acorss Praveen Mohan on YouTube or may be TrueIndology on twitter and ancient Archaeology fascinates me!"\n\nGO BURN!\n\nHar Har Mahadev.'<br />Author: 'johnkarter767612'<br />id: 'gar5g7'<br />Flair :Research</li>

By taking your time with the experience and letting your rookie hand do the work, the whole thing could last longer, and of course, “the longer the build up, the harder the blow,” Hope says.\n2. ***Allows Multitask*** : helps in browsing quality vids while touching oneself\n3. ***Can cure porn addiction*** : AskMen claims that masturbating with your non-dominant hand may be a way to mitigate the effects of a porn addiction, including erectile dysfunction.

<li>Title: 'Ithihas Time : When Lord Brahma guarded the stage to protect freedom of Speech and Expression'<br />Body: "&amp;#x200B;\n\nSource : Natyashastra written by Bharatmuni.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story is the time of Treta-yuga, under the King Vaivasvata, people fell prey to lust, greed, jealousy and anger. Hence their pleasures became admixed with sorrow, their happiness with misery. A delegation, led by lndra, was formed in Jambudvipa to represent Devas, Danavas, Gandharvas, Yakshas, Rakshasas, Urugas and human beings who inhabited it to seek a remedy. The delegation felt that a universal, diverting entertainment within the authorization or conformity of the Veda was the answer, and approached the creator god Brahma to create for them such an audio-visual art mode. Accordingly, Brahma created the art of the theatre, Natya from the four Vedas eclectically and gave it to them.  \n\n\n The task was then delegated by Brahma to the sage Bharata who, with his 'sons' playing the different roles, produced a play on the theme of Amritamanthana (churning of the milk ocean for obtaining the immortalizing elixir) highlighting the triumph of gods over demons. He dramatized a theme in which the gods vanquished the demons and tore them limb to limb. The play was performed; Brahma and the other gods were delighted. So were Gandharvas, Yakshas, Rakshasas and Pannagas. However, when it came to the part when the danavas and daityas were massacred, they (who had gate-crashed) could not stomach the humiliation. They instigated and let loose on the stage obstructive, malevolent spirits which with witchcraft paralyzed all activity on the stage and struck the actors and even the director dumb. Indra discovered the reason for this thespian calamity, seized the banner staff itself and beat to a pulp the invisible obstructive forces (vighnas) and their leader Virupaksha as well as the daityas and danavas who had aided and abetted. Then the play went on smoothly. The gods were pleased, offered gifts to the performers and the director. For at the next performance, the remaining Vighnas again terrorized the dramatis personae and brought the play to a stop. To counter this various gods were assigned the task of safeguarding the players and also various parts of the stage. Brahma himself took over the protection of the stage.  'It is for this reason that flowers are scattered on the stage (Pushpanjali) the beginning of a performance.'"<br />Author: 'sharmaji_ka_CA'<br />id: 'g9qifq'<br />Flair :Research</li>

<li>Title: 'Me and Internet Officer’s mom'<br />Body: 'Hello everyone! This is Bank_Holiday a Shia Tamil guy of Nair heritage age 20, with a height of 6ft. 4inch and a gym body. I have a black brown complexion. I always get lucky when it comes to sex. And most of the times its with gorimems. This has made me feel more attracted towards gorimem but sex is sex. I hope you guys loved my first story about how I got to fuck my hot and sexy InternetOfficer mother\nLet’s s come to story. When I had a semester end break for a month I and my friends had planned to go on a trekking trip. It was supposed to be a four day trek. And the place we decided to go was Ooty. We reached Ooty on the evening of the day before trekking. We checked in at a hotel in the locality. I went to get Tea for us. When I got out of our room I saw a beautiful lady playing with her kid outside their room. I saw her and gave a smile and she too smiled. I left from there to get tea. I was recalling her in my mind. She was fair enough, a height of around 5ft. 8inch, very slim and curvy body profile. South Indian dressing style with a yellow saree. In total a total sex goddess.\nI came back from the canteen and she was still out there with her kid. Again we both smiled. I told, “Hi!, I am Bank_Holidays Shia Tamil guy.” She told,”I am Priya, and this is my son InternetOfficer.” I waved a hi to the kid. She asked me,” Have you come on a tour with your family.” I replied, “No, I and my Tamil boys have come on a trekking trip”. I then called out my friends and introduced them to her. She too introduced me to her group. Now I say “her group” and not family because she hadn’t come with her husband, but only her kid. She called her friends out and said, “this is my friend Anitha and her husband Pradeep and their two kids”. I asked, “didn’t your husband come along?”. She replied, “no, he is busy with his job, always busy”. Then one of my friends asked them to join us in dinner to which they agreed. We went back to our respective rooms then.\nIt was 8pm when me and my friends knocked on their room door. They were all set and we left for a restaurant near by. On the way my friends were talking to each other. Priya aunty’s friend was busy with her family, so Priya aunty was alone. I went to her and asked, “why didn’t her husband come?”. She said, “i told you, he has some important job at his office, he rarely spends some time with us”. I asked, “not even on a tour so far from home”. She replied, “let’s put this matter aside. So, what do you do?”. “I do bakchodi”, I replied. She said, ” Oh! Good. Am just a house wife”. With a cheeky smile I said, “I have great respect for house wives, they are hard working, loving and very good”. She smiled like she was being appreciated for the first time in years.\nWe finally reached the restaurant and me and my friends sat on one side of a table and Priya aunty and her friends sat on the other side. My friends were busy deciding what to order. During this time I was checking out Priya aunty. She wore a red saree, a matching blouse and very light jewelry. She had a really great abs curvy body. The curve on her hips could not be compared to anyone. Her boobs were huge and shaped so well. When she got up to go to the wash I checked out her ass. There were so huge and curvy. I was wondering how could her husband not spend enough time with such a beautiful sweet woman. I wanted to have sex with her so badly. Our food was served and we were eating. I was staring at Priya aunty’s boobs now and then. She suddenly saw me staring at her boobs. I didn’t realize she was watching me until a few seconds. When i did realize I got scared and immediately broke my stare. I was feeling bad that she might feel I was taking advantage of her.\nWe were done with our dinner and were walking to the hotel back. On the way me and Priya aunty were silent until she decided to ask me, “were you staring at what I think you were staring at?”. I was stuck, ” no i wasn’t staring at… I mean i don’t know what your talking about”. She said in a calm voice, “don’t worry relax, am not angry, many men stare at me. I hate them for it. But I liked the way you were staring at me”. I was shocked as well as happy. I asked, “you like me staring at you?, then do you like me Priya?”. She didn’t say anything but blushed. This was the submission. We reached our hotel and I told my friends that I’ll go to the terrace and asked Priya also to give some excuse and come to the terrace.\nI was waiting for her in the terrace. It was a semi open terrace with lights. But now it was all alone. I thought to myself that it was an awesome location. She then entered the terrace. We both were staring at each other not knowing what to do. I then asked her, “You still didn’t answer me, do you like me?”. She replied, “I left my kid, my friends and all just to be with you here alone, don’t you understand”. I didn’t wait for a second I hugged her and kissed her naval. I moved my lips to her face and started giving it kisses in a teasing manner. She was liking it and could not wait for it, so she pulled my face and locked her lips with mine. We were fondling with each other’s mouths. The kiss was so wet and sweet. We explored our mouths for over 15 minutes. My hands were eager to cup her breasts. I started to rub her boobs\neven now in a teasing manner. She was giving me ecstatic looks. I finally caught them with a strong grasp. She moaned, “Ah, Bank_Holidays”. I removed the saree and blouse and she wearing a white bra. Her huge cleave made me more horny. I just ripped her bra off. She giggled and told, “you naughty boy, your very excited”. I caught those huge melons and squeezed them so hard. Her nipples were hard and was rubbing them. I buried my half mouth into her breasts and started sucking it. Her body started shaking heavily and her moans grew loud. She suddenly caught my dick over my track pant and stated jerking it. It was time I reveal my dick to her. I removed my shirt and track pant\nand I don’t wear undies at night. So there I stood with my eight inch dick hard as a rock. Also my dick is curved. She saw my dick and said, “wow, you have such a big and curved thing”. I was wondering why does the curve intrigue her so much. I couldn’t wait to ask her, I continued to suck her boobs and she caught my dick and started jerking it.\nI wanted to see her naked and so I undressed her completely. She had little hairy pussy. I made her lie on the floor and started to lick her navel. Then I moved down to her cunt. It was already so wet. The minute my mouth touched her pussy lips she gave a huge moan. I got excited by this and started to increase the pressure slowly. Her body started shaking hardly and then I understood she was about to come. I started to finger her hard and came all over my hands. I licked the juices in her pussy. She told me, “this is my first oral sex, my husband would never do it because he felt it was disgusting”. I knew what I had to do. I got up and gave her my dick. She slowly licked it like a lollipop. I couldn’t control it, I pushed my dick deep into her mouth. She started sucking it so hard I started moaning like a girl. Suddenly my dick felt a high blood rush and I knew I was about to cum. She knew and increased the speed and I finally came inside her mouth. She drank it all.\nI was so energized by the blowjob. I made her sit in doggy position and pushed my dick into her pussy. I was moving in and out slowly, then increasing the speed slowly. She was moaning, “ah Bank_Holidays, ohhh.. Aahh ahh..”. I was about to come and so was she. She came a few seconds before me. I then was about to come and then I pulled my dick out and came on her ass. Then we did it again.\nAfter few hours of lying naked on the floor and staring at stars she again gave me a blowjob. We then got dressed and left for our room. Next day our paths separated. But we did exchange numbers and we often have phone sex.'<br />Author: 'BanksLuvsTurbovirgin'<br />id: 'g8xhwp'<br />Flair :HQ Text Bakchodi</li>

I fear for the worst on the day Ramzan ends when all the Muslims come out in the open and spread the virus more.."<br />Author: 'p1wdc'<br />id: 'g8voa3'<br />Flair :Rant</li>

<li>Title: 'Controversial: Tired of posts discouraging and promoting certain religions?? Have something about our politics! and how our secularity is being ruined. (DO NOT OPEN THIS IF YOU WILL BE OFFENDED WITH YOUR EXTREMIST IDEALS)'<br />Body: ' \n\nAt home and abroad, one of postindependence India’s defining characteristics is that the nation has managed to sustain democratic governance in the face of striking ethnic, linguistic, and religious diversity. In the early years after independence, the country’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and the ruling Indian National Congress (or Congress Party) advocated for an Indian brand of secularism designed to hold the country’s disparate communities together under one roof. Indeed, Nehru often pronounced that India’s composite culture was one of its greatest strengths. The Hindu nationalists who later came to populate the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its various ideological affiliates have consistently harbored a starkly different view; they envision India as a majoritarian nation-state, not a multicultural one. The tensions inherent in these competing visions of Indian nationhood have come to the fore in recent years, especially since the BJP’s landmark electoral victory in 2014.\n\nTo understand these dynamics, it is necessary to define basic concepts and review relevant history. This is because political entrepreneurs who promote ethnoreligious identities—especially Hindu nationalist ideologues—have created much confusion around the notion of secularism, claiming that its proponents have endeavored to make the state hostile or indifferent to religion. That was certainly not the intention of the architects of modern India, whose enemy was not religion, but communalism.\n\nNationalist forces aside, all is not well with Indian secularism. Even before Hindutva forces began attacking India’s secular tradition, the Congress Party had already started undermining secularism by cynically jockeying for the support of different voting blocs and by stoking divisive issues of social identity (a practice known as vote banking). In parallel, the judiciary—especially at the lower levels—has adopted a majoritarian undertone on certain controversial cases. Whether secularism can maintain its hold as a defining ideology for the country will depend in part on a combination of political forces—namely the BJP’s future electoral success and the strategies the opposition adopts to counter the ruling party.'<br />Author: 'SNUBB3D'<br />id: 'g892kz'<br />Flair :Rant</li>
