<li>Title: 'Why I support some sort of reservation, even though I am a Jain.'<br />Body: 'I see a lot of people hate the reservation system in India. Many of my friends do. And I rarely try to explain to them that why reservation is a good thing. Be it reservation for women, for the backward classes, or STs. Today, I do the same. I\'ll put my arguments as logically as possible so that it\'s easy to follow and question them.\n\nIndex:\n\nWhy reservation exists:\n\nPoint 1: inequality exists.\n\nPoint 2: Government can\'t be capitalistic.\n\nPoint 3: Reservation system works. \n\nPoint 4: Job yet not completed.\n\nWhy it shouldn\'t bother you:\n\nPoint 5: no effect on efficiency\n\nPoint 6: India\'s love for government jobs.\n\nPoint 7: Government jobs are very small compared to private-sector jobs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPoint 1: **Some sort of inequality always exists.** \n\nSome sort of inequality always exists in society. That\'s human nature. Some or other sect of the society gets the bitter end of the growth. I am not supporting it. But it exists. There is no evidence that you can create a society where everyone is on the sweet end of growth and benefits. Some sect will always be left behind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPoint 2: **Government\'s job is to "*****try"*** **to reduce inequality**\n\nFirst, we need to understand that Government isn\'t a company. It doesn\'t seek profits. And it shouldn\'t. Thus, when employing people it can\'t be capitalistic. It shouldn\'t. When a capitalist looks for employees, he tries to find the candidate that will give him the most profit. When a government looks for employees, it should try to find the candidate that can get the job done AND is also marginalized. \n\nPoint 3: **Why people questioning the reservation system is a sign that it works.**\n\nWhen India had its first peak everyone wanted Vaccines, asap, but as it faded away in Jan people forgot that Covid can kill you, so people started questioning the vaccines, they thought Covid will give me cough at max. Conspiracy theories started to come up. Now that it has returned with a bigger wave, people are again resorting to vaccines.\n\n*People start questioning the very system they created when people start forgetting what the original problem looks like.* \n\nThe same is the reason behind people questioning reservation. The general public questioning reservation is a sign that it worked.  We have successfully brought untouchability to record lows in cities.\n\n*I can\'t say this enough, our reservation system has worked wonders.* \n\nPoint 4: **But its job hasn\'t yet completed.** \n\nOur population isn\'t industrialized yet. People still have to do in-humane jobs. Most of our population is still in villages. And villages are still stuck in the 1960s. According to them, untouchables are still untouchables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPoint 5: **There\'s no evidence of reservation decreasing efficiency.** \n\nSo far we have talked about four points, some sects are left behind, it\'s the government\'s job to try to bring them up and governments shouldn\'t be capitalistic, sign that it works and that its job hasn\'t yet completed. Now the efficiency of systems.\n\nThere\'s no scientific evidence of the efficiency of an employee employed based on the reservation being less than that of a general candidate. None, nill, nada. A similar argument is put against corporates\' diversity program in the west. But there\'s no evidence to support it. Maybe our general candidate was better prepared for the entrance test, but he isn\'t better prepared for what comes afterwards. Both are equally prepared.  \n\n\nThis solves all the questions from why reservation exists, to does it reduce efficiency. Now coming to a bigger problem in the country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPoint 6: **India\'s Loves For Government Jobs.** \n\nThanks to our over-protective past governments, there was no private sector, at all, and all the jobs that existed were in PSUs. Nehruvian socialism. "Thank you, Mr Nehru, I say" /s\n\nGovernment an omnipresent god. It had telecom, mobiles, petrol, cars, everything. Basically, Government was an all-pervasive, all above, omnipotent god. And India\'s love for god and god figures is well known. We put them on a high pedestal. Thus was created the love for government jobs. You want to be associated with the government.\n\nThat\'s not the case anymore. \n\nAll our countries\' job is in the private sector. The private sector is the fortune maker in the country now, not the government. But people are still living in nostalgia. Government job is like *amrit* in India that you feel cheated if you don\'t get one. This nostalgia and love for government jobs is the reason that our youth feels cheated due to reservation. But ideally, they shouldn\'t even care. Government jobs, colleges, and schools should be looked down upon not put on a high pedestal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPoint 7: **The effect of the reservation is virtually insignificant in modern India.** \n\nWe need to understand that there are only a ***few thousand*** government job openings every year. We are giving the backward classes an edge "only" on a few thousand jobs. All other millions of job are created in the private sector where there\'s no reservation.  Basically, less than 0.01% of the jobs created have reservation. That\'s virtually insignificant. But we Indians make it look that only these good jobs. Which is not the reality.'<br />Author: 'frrrrrro'<br />id: 'n20r1a'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'COVID: MISSING FACTS, MISDIRECTED DISCOURSE'<br />Body: "\\*\\*Stolen\\*\\*\n\nONE-FIFTH of Indian districts have not reported any Covid 19 cases for the last seven days. We seem to have flattened the Covid curve,‚Äù declared Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan two months back, on February 15. By then the daily infections that had peaked to 90,000 cases last year, were down to less than 9,000. But things changed dramatically into an unprecedented disaster in April (see table). The grim situation called for a huge national resolve to deal with the crisis. But the unfortunate deaths caused by the shortage of oxygen in Delhi made the ecosystem so emotionally surcharged that all facts and reasoning became irrelevant. The missing facts misdirected the public discourse, distorted the narrative on Covid and damaged the national will to face the challenge. Look at what crucial facts were missed. \n\n***Profiteers‚Äô complaint*** \n\nThe oxygen shortage-induced deaths first occurred in Delhi‚Äôs corporate hospitals. These hospitals made huge profits, even more last year, thanks to the pandemic. That provoked the National Herald site to write an article titled Profit in times of COVID-19: Is it time to take over private hospitals? (20.6.2020). The report said ‚ÄúRs 25,090, Rs 53,090, Rs 775,590, Rs 5,00,000, Rs 6,00,000, Rs 12,00,000 ‚Äî these are not random numbers. These are the per day costs and cumulative two-week costs for a bed in private hospitals in Delhi if one gets Coronavirus.‚Äù Adding the cost of the personal protection equipment (PPE), tests and medicines, the bill equalled Indians‚Äô annual income, it said. Home treatment fee was no less; it varied from Rs 5,700 to Rs 21,900 a day plus cost of tests. The Herald report cited a writ against this loot in the Supreme Court. \n\nAlarmed by the writ, the Association of Healthcare Providers (AHPs) and FICCI members agreed to self regulate. What were the self regulated fees? AHP‚Äôs daily fee for general wards was Rs 15,000 plus Rs 5,000 for oxygen; for ICU Rs 25,000 plus Rs 10,000 for ventilators. The FICCI‚Äôs rates were even higher - Rs 17,000 to Rs 45,000 per day. And more. Hospitals bought PPEs at Rs 375-500 apiece and sold them to patients at 10-12 times more. Chennai and Mumbai were no exceptions, said the Herald. \n\nIt is these hospitals that now filed writs under the constitutional right to life, for oxygen supply by governments ‚Äî for which they charge the patients Rs 5,000 per day! Anyone heard of these horrendous facts of the loot in the uproarious debate on oxygen shortage causing deaths? This is important because the profiteering hospitals could have set up their own oxygen plants at minuscule cost. Read on. \n\n***O2 privatised, unregulated*** \n\nThe production, trade, stocking and use of oxygen is privatised. The trade in medical oxygen is not controlled or regulated in India ‚Äî though its prices are controlled by the National Pharma Pricing Authority (NPPA)an autonomous body under the chemicals and fertilisers ministry. Producers enter into private contracts with industries, hospitals and also governments to supply oxygen. \n\nHospitals plan how much oxygen is needed for an emergency, estimate the lead time for delivery and order accordingly. Their supply chains were long both in distance and time, particularly for Delhi hospitals, which are thousands of kilometers away from their production sources spread across several states. Supplies have to be trucked in from industrial zones in eastern India. This needed meticulous advance planning to ensure timely deliveries even during normalcy. But hospitals did not plan stocks for contingent needs and saved on costs. Did anyone hear any of these facts in the noise of the last 10 days? \n\n***No shortage*** \n\nSecond, there is no shortage of oxygen. We produce 1,00,000 tonnes a day, with one company in Gujarat alone producing a fifth of it. Of the total produced, only a minuscule part, some 1%, is medical oxygen. Even in the Covid crisis, it may not top 5-6%. The production of oxygen, mostly captively used, is concentrated in far off areas. Oxygen in liquid form is traded and transported through heavy, safe tankers, each of which costs Rs 45 lakh. Worse still, oxygen worth Rs 300 is stored in a cylinder that costs Rs 10,000! The distant production and multiple trade chains in oxygen, transport in tankers and stocking in cylinders created huge logistic issues even in normal times. In times of pandemic, this supply chain wouldn‚Äôt withstand stress, particularly when Delhi, where the deaths occurred, is several hundred kms away from where the oxygen has to be transported. \n\n***Profiteers failed, but shifted the blame*** \n\nAfter the Covid first wave last year, each (Delhi) hospital should have set up their on-thespot oxygen producing unit. A report by The Print says that a 240-bed hospital with 40 ICU beds uses oxygen worth about Rs 5 lakh per month in normal times. It costs some Rs 50 lakh to set up a Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen plant, which they could recover within 18 months. Every Delhi hospital could afford it. But none was ready to allocate the precious space to house an oxygen plant. They opted to buy oxygen from a thousand kilometres away instead and not make it in their backyard. The supply chain risks of oxygen were brought out last year by Cherish Paul, John Paul and Akhil Babu of the Department of Anaesthesia and Critical Care, Jubilee Mission Medical College and Research Institute, Thrissur, Kerala. \n\nIn an article in the Indian Journal of Respiratory Care titled ‚ÄúHospital oxygen supply: A survey of disaster preparedness of Indian hospitals,‚Äù the three experts concluded that most of the hospitals rely on a single pipeline from a single location, inviting mishaps during disasters. They recommended multiple sources of oxygen depending on the size and the hospital‚Äôs proximity to a liquid oxygen plant. Apply this caution to the Delhi hospitals. They could themselves produce oxygen but did not. They never planned for an uninterrupted supply of oxygen during a disaster. When their supply lines for oxygen on which they profiteer failed, they cited the constitutional right to life and asked the court to direct governments to give oxygen! The off-hand and emotional response of the court actually helped to shift the blame on to governments. That changed the very discourse and narrative on Covid. Did the public have any hint of these critical facts in the last few days? \n\n***Hospitals thwarted 129 on-spot oxygen plants*** \n\nThe current stentorian discourse sans facts, which shifts the blame on to the government for the supply chain failures of hospitals, misses a more critical fact. Anticipating a contingency like this, the Modi government had ordered 162 PSA plants at a cost of over Rs 200 crore in October last for government hospitals all over India. This could have produced 80,500 litres of medical oxygen per minute. This translates approximately to one ton of liquid oxygen per day per plant. But out of plants ordered for 162 hospitals, only 33 got installed. Why? Even state government hospitals thwarted the Centre‚Äôs plan for on-thespot oxygen production facili ties. The Print says, orders were placed in December but when vendors reached the hospitals for installation, many ‚Äúfaced resistance‚Äù from them, pretending ‚Äúno space‚Äù ‚Äî the real reason being vested interest to procure oxygen rather than generating the entire requirement onsite. This showed how advance planning for on-thespot oxygen supply by the Centre was thwarted by even the state-run hospitals. In the contemporary shouting and counter shouting in the media and social media, has anyone heard about this farsighted move of the government, beyond the feeble voice of The Print? \n\n***New Covid Tsunami Isn'ta return of the old*** \n\nAn even more critical fact that is absent in the discourse on oxygen deficit, is that the present Covid Tsunami is not the return of the old, but a totally unanticipated new one massifying like hell. The Covid curve, which began rising from March first week, gathered pace through March, rose fast in the first two weeks of April and became a Tsunami later. In just seven weeks, Bihar saw a rise of daily new cases by 522 times, UP by 399 times, Andhra by 186 times, Delhi and Jharkhand by 150 times, West Bengal by 142 times and Rajasthan by 123 times ‚Äî disaster of a size, a Tsunami, beyond anyone‚Äôs anticipation. This is not the repeat of Covid 1.0 last year. It is a new, double mutant Indian variety that got generated in each place where Covid 1.0 had gone before. No expert could anticipate this. This was bound to flood hospitals and ICUs throwing all plans awry. \n\n ***Need national will*** \n\nThis unprecedented Tsunami called for shared responsibility and collective will to face it and not to miss the facts or misdirect the discourse and shift the blame. That even in the face of a national disaster like Covid we showed the lack of collective will is a matter of concern. How the opposition parties branded the vaccine, Covaxin, approved by the government for emergency use exposed this national deficit. Except Rajasthan, opposition-ruled Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, West Bengal and Jharkhand created doubts in people‚Äôs mind about vaccines. Result, the people hesitated for the jab. In January only 33% beneficiaries were willing for the shot, 40% preferred to wait and 16% said ‚ÄòNo‚Äô. In March, those willing rose to 57%, those who preferred to wait halved and naysayers reduced to 6%. Three precious months were lost. \n\nAgainst an average daily vaccination of 30 lakh, making it 9 crore a month, only 10.8 crore had first jabs, and 1.6 crore had double jabs till March, which could have been double that number had vaccine hesitancy not crept in. Also, as a nation we let down our guard. As the Google mobility data shows, despite Covid continuing we began leading a near normal life ‚Äî 78% in entertainment, 87% in parks and public places, 92% in transportation, and 120% in shopping as compared to the pre-lockdown period. And mostly without social distancing and without wearing masks. Now we have a huge challenge ‚Äî to face up to which we need collective national will. Are we capable of it?"<br />Author: 'notorious_kitten'<br />id: 'n14n5m'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Curious Case Of /R//India Moderators And Why It Is Anti-India &amp; Anti-Hindu!'<br />Body: 'I have been using Reddit for nearly ten years when there were hardly a few hundred users of the sub, named after India. In fact, I had my username /u/deepaktiwarii for the simple reason that I had not paid any attention to privacy or witch hunting from moderators or any Reddit user for that matter. Then came the 2014 Loksabha elections and all of sudden the sub became a den of AAP trolls, anyone who supported nationalist ideas was banned. But another interesting development was also taking shape all this while.\n\nEver since I was banned from the sub and reading the comments of other redditors who were all banned from the sub, I started seeing a pattern in it. There are 10 moderators in  r//India going through their post and comments all over Reddit you can see 3 of them are Non-residents, whether they are Indians is also doubtful. What appears quite clear is they live in Pakistan, Germany, UK and Switzerland. Rahulthewall lives in Switzerland and Kashif who works as a wedding photographer lives in London. Interestingly, Kashif is married to a Hindu girl Anika Sood, a clear case of Love Jihad.\n\nThere are two other moderators out of which at least one lives outside India that makes it four out of nine moderators don‚Äôt live in India. Regarding other moderators of that sub at least one is from Delhi and one from Bangalore. Two others from their comments look to be from Kolkata and Chennai.\n\n## Gang Of A Few Not Letting Nationalist Voices Have A Say\n\nThe totalitarian practices of banning nationalists is not limited to /r//India, they have started doing this in /r//worldnews as well since two of the moderators are also moderators in /r//worldnews. These moderators are also squatting on Indian city subreddit like \xa0/r//Delhi, /r//Kolkata, /r//Bangalore, /r//Mumbai, /r//Kerala and hence, there is a chance that you might be banned from other big and small subreddit for your actions in r//India.\n\nIt has also come to notice that a lot of traffic comes from Pakistan. Needless to say the fear is that Pakistanis may also be in control of the sub because all the time it is Pakistani, pro-Muslim and anti-Hindu propaganda is on in the subreddit. This discussion in Reddit shows that initial moderators sold their usernames and this may have given [Pakistanis a control over the subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiadiscussion/comments/ljn26f/what_so_apparently_the_only_way_to_become_a/)\n\n## /R//Rahulthewall Came With Alt To Moderate And Ban Users\n\nSince, he was doxxed he had to trick the users and for that first he announced that he was leaving Reddit for some time and so he should be out from the moderators team. Interestingly, at the same time a new user was added to the moderation team, his style and pattern of language is exactly like one from Rahulthewall. Since, he had accepted that he was one of the earliest donors to Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi, we can summarily accept that he works for AAP IT cell in some capacity. This is where the whole issue of banning anyone other than AAP and to some extent Congress supporters came up.\n\n## Traffic Of The Subreddit Not Coming From India\n\nSeveral posts have come up over the years exposing the fact that since 2015, there has been a significant fall in the traffic from India users in the subreddit and the major reason is almost all active users and the most vocal nationalist users have been banned by the subreddit moderators and then by the site administrators who are in cahoots with these moderators. I can guarantee r//India moderators are working in tandem with the Reddit moderators for the simple reason that as soon as you are banned from the subreddit, your account is suspended permanently.\n\nNot just that, I also emailed and complained about the dictatorial moderation of the subreddit, no rule based moderation and less Indian users representation but it appears the words go to deaf ears.\n\n## Other Subreddit Have Caught Popularity\n\nReddit being one of the better discussion forums, especially if you like anonymity forced so many users to stick with it even when we were treated badly by the /r//india subreddit and the admins of the website. Some users started **/r//Indianews** which is another fantastic subreddit for India specific discussion. Another right wing meme subreddit is /r/chodi which has become a battleground where anti-Hindu and anti-India ideas are slaughtered at buds.'<br />Author: 'SHIVANSH_RTX'<br />id: 'n10ob2'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Masks are just to show the authorities but not for actual use in homes and places where you socialize\n2. People attend iftar parties, marriages and other stupid functions thinking that the virus might be sleeping that time and it won't affect them\n3. If they are doing something religious like a pooja or traveling to a temple, then automatically covid is not a concern anymore as God will save them.\n4. Thinking that most of the precautions, like keeping a track of things you touch, sanitizing any deliveries or asking the clingy neighbor to stay 6 feet away are stupid and for pussies.\n5. My community (marwari), a lot of people, just go home after business and don't take a bath or sanitize themselves after meeting a shit ton of customers before meeting their families. It is their complete stupidity to not isolate themselves from their families.\n\nThey basically think that a generally applied 6 feet distance and a mask worn casually will eliminate all risk, and things like touching things at a local supermarket and picking their nose are all safe. \n\nMy rant is, if you are not prepared to take precautions as best as you can, just don't fucking complain. If you say your dad is dying due to oxygen not being available, ask yourself, had your dad followed the precautions, would you be in this position? If your answer is no, accept that the current situation was born out of your own or your dad's stupidity and shut up.\n\nYou are the one straining the country and its resources, not the government, or the healthcare providers or anyone else. If you are of the type who disregarded all covid guidelines and got covid, just die quietly in your house or somewhere remote, and save the others.\n\nTl;dr; Just don't fucking get infected.

If so, why do you not blame other parties like TMC and Congress on same grounds?\n\n2) Where did Kumbh Mela take place? How did it effect situation in Kerala, Maharashtra and Delhi? Yeah, I know your answer - no masks, no social distancing etc., then can you answer my next 2 questions?\n\n3) Can you list places where the Ramazan was being offered? Where these peace loving people following COVID guidelines during their festival?\n\n4) What about farmer protests? I know there were people joining from foreign countries and came out openly in support of the so called 'farmers'? Where they also following COVID guidelines in Delhi? Did this particular event not lead to crisis in Delhi?\n\nThis seems to be propoganda to defame India, Hindu, BJP and all our country men as a whole. It is a well planned series of events - planned by Western riches and political parties who have control over international media and is being framed/executed by political parties including Congress, AAP and Indian media houses to overthrow BJP and defame Hindus as a whole.\n\nI really hope these Western powers get the taste of their own medicine in years to come. America will not be a superpower in years to come.\n\nAnd finally to my like-minded brothers, VOTE FOR - BJP. THEY ARE SCARED OF BJP AND WANT TO OVERTHROW THEM FOR A REASON.

<li>Title: 'Cred points finally useful, oxygen shortage solved'<br />Body: 'Kunal Shah has been vilified a lot about the usefulness of cred points in the recent past. But his multibillion dollar start-up has set in motion a novel plan not only to address the oxygen shortage India is facing and the economic quagmire it has fallen into.\n\nMr. Kunal Shah addressing the press about this said, ‚ÄúWe have received a lot of bad press about our business model. Everyone‚Äôs saying that, Cred is just a marketing company. It has no product to sell. This is to put an end to all these speculations.‚Äù\n\nThe plan in simple words goes like this:\n\n1. Get a credit card\n2. Spend money\n3. Pay bill using Cred\n4. Get Cred Points\n5. Use Cred Points to get oxygen\n\nExplaining further he said. ‚ÄúI was pained looking at everything going wrong in the country. I decided to put all problems that the country is facing once and for all.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPeople would have to spend money, thus ensuring that the consumer demand during the pandemic would remain high. To earn Cred Points, they would have to pay for their spending as well ensuring that NPAs in our banking system decrease. And later on, for every 10,000 Cred Coins people give me, I would give them 1,000 liters of oxygen. This would solve the oxygen problem. Thus ensuring that the country comes back on its feet as soon as possible.‚Äù\n\nHowever, this has led to a lot of issues amongst the customer base.\n\nTake the example of Raj, his father was been admitted in Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi which has been facing Oxygen shortage. Raj took his fathers credit card and used it to buy the new iPhone 12. He paid the bill from his fathers savings and used the cred points to get oxygen. But later on he realized that the oxygen would be donated to someone else. His father has now been kicked out of the hospital because he couldn‚Äôt pay the bill. The money his father had saved was already spent on the phone.\n\nRaj has posted his problems on twitter asking Cred to refund his money. Cred representatives have contacted him and appreciated the photo quality of the selfie.\n\nAnother issue that has cropped up is black marketing of cred points. Currently, black marketers in Delhi are selling 10,000 cred points for Rs. 20,000. We had a word with a black marketer, (Name redacted) about this. (name redacted), said, ‚ÄúCred has a very tough qualification criteria. A lot of people cannot get cred coins. Market Price just reflects the same.‚Äù\n\nBhavya, a cred point investment expert agreed with (name redacted) that, ‚ÄúCurrently ,only a few people have access to cred. On an average, these people have collected over 5 lakh cred coins over the past two years. We believe that you should book some profits now and keep buying these points on dips. For people with long term goals, I would advice them to hold onto it unless they require oxygen now.‚Äù\n\nKunal Shah has blamed these issues as teething problems and has promised to sort these issues out after the next funding round.\n\nOn being asked about his future political plans, Mr. Shah said, ‚ÄúWith the technology we have currently, we are trying to print my picture on the oxygen atoms we would be giving the patients. If politicians can win elections with promises of Free food, electricity, jobs, laptops, dosas and uttapams, I believe that I would have a significant advantage over them with free oxygen.‚Äù\n\nOn hearing about Mr. Shah‚Äôs entry into politics, Mr. Shah(Not related), a leader of a national political party said that he would move to Supreme Court against Mr. Shah‚Äôs entry into politics. He said,‚ÄùMr. Shah can just buy the entire country given his unlimited supply of cred coins. These cred coins are not legal and have been sourced from China‚Äù\n\nUpdate:\n\nMr. Bhavya, our resident cred point expert has added that, ‚ÄúFor now, spend all your cred coins on oxygen for the needy. It might not be legal tender in a few days.‚Äù'<br />Author: 'kejriwal4pm'<br />id: 'mz4qcm'<br />Flair :Bakchod News :news:</li>

<li>Title: 'This helped me to fight the virus and has helped my friends and family members'<br />Body: ' This  can be dismissed as "fraud" but I have lost patience and am going to  share what worked for me and my friends and family who got infected with  the virus. I do not suggest to "not to go to hospitals" or "not follow  the government / health care industry protocol". Do not leave any option  out.\n\nI am only sharing what worked for me and can work for you and can potential save a lot of damage if not fully cure you.\n\nThis is what you have to do -\n\nAll  you need to do is make Haldi / Turmeric paste (roughly five parts Haldi  and three part water) and apply on your throat and entire chest cavity  and back (as anything applied on skin permeates it). This will result in  constant administration of turmeric (which is one of the few anti virus  agents known to man) and it seems to help kill the virus as suggested  by fever going away after 1 hour of applying the paste. So in 1 hour you  should see fever going away and temperature returning back to normal.\n\nWhile  you rest, you can have hot water (not just warm, but hot, like tea /  coffee) sip by sip as it induces heat into your throat which also kills  the virus. You can sprinkle little Haldi in the the water too. You will  see immediate improvement (within 5-10 minutes) as you\'ll start sipping  hot water - this immediate improvement will also give you confidence in  this "treatment". Though the symptoms will return as soon as you stop  sipping it. So repeat this hot water intake after five minutes break  once you empty a glass. Continue this for one hour and you will recover  even faster.\n\nLeave the Haldi on you0r body even after 1 hour when the fever goes away. And wash it off after 4-5 hours and apply again.\n\nApply it every days for two three hours for one week until all symptoms go away.\n\nIf  it works for you or helps others to a substantial degree, please  comment and share this cure so others can also build conviction and try  it out for themselves.'<br />Author: 'Jobhi'<br />id: 'myskib'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
<li>Title: 'Time to sort out our priorities'<br />Body: "Suppose your leader isn't doing enough with a concerning situation. What should you do? Should you double down on your support or should you join your opponents and face your leader? The answer is- what is at stake. We stood with ModiJi in anti CAA protests and anti farm bill protests. It is time again to make a decision in Covid resurgence. Think of what is at stake if we join his opponents and for some reason. What if this time it sticks to the public and voters turn against him in next election because there is no wall of hia supporters between him and anti Modi propaganda? As Hindus, this will be a blow to us like of which we haven't seen in some time. His opponents are p√≠ss√©d at us already and when they come back to power, b√∫ttf√∫ck√≠ng us will be the first thing on their list and the little growth in our voices that we have seen will be lost before it matures into strong ecosystems. For the first time in centuries we have leadership which is sympathetic to us, don't forget that and that is what we stand to lose if Modiji is taken down. In 2010 we were already marked Hindu extremists/Hindu t√©rrorists. Imagine what we will receive this time from infuriated Khangress, burned librandoos and frothing leftists. So make this decision right now, no matter what Covid leads to, stick with Modi Ji like your life depends upon it (it does) and to ease your mind into it, knowing dedication of Modiji towards nation, do you really think he isn't doing his best?

Barkha bibi is intruding upon people\'s private lives, taking pics of funerals and is gleefully sharing the pics \n* Western media - Death porn, blaming it on Modi, Exaggerating the crisis - when the cases per 100k are much better than any western country although we\'re having a difficult time catering to the patients (can\'t be denied)\n* "Intellectuals" like Dhruv Tatti are sharing unsolicited medical advice \n* Some people are silently contributing without making much fuss. People who benefitted are sharing out of gratitude. This is a very small percentage. \n* World leaders and countries are sending help to India: Afghanistan, Iran, Israel, Germany, France, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Mongolia have sent help; (Please add any i missed) \n* US cracked under pressure and is finally open to business with us.. probably sending help as well.'<br />Author: 'civ_gandhi'<br />id: 'myq58k'<br />Flair :Bakchod News :news:</li>

<li>Title: 'COVID New Digest and paranoia'<br />Body: 'Covid situation is worse. Every known and usual suspect of a media house is writing about how Indian Govt failed to control the whole thing.\n\nSo I started doing a check to know what are the sources being quoted about it. \n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/news/national/global-oxygen-aid-effort-as-india-appeals-for-help/article34401882.ece\n\n0 sources. Everything is written that someone said something or did something without source.\n\nhttps://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/video/aiims-delhi-oxygen-shortage-1794635-2021-04-24\n\nA video of India today new streams saying AIIMS raised alarm. No link or video of AIIMS press release.\n\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/24/india-sees-new-record-covd-19-death-toll-as-shortages-bite\n\n1 source which actually routs to another of their own article without source.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/uk-56841381\n\n3 sources - all take to another articles on their own page which do not have sources.\n1 edited video for effects to reflect grim picture of cOVID situation.\n3 pics - which can‚Äôt be verified for timeline.\n\n\nAny how, there are two things to note which can‚Äôt be denied and you don‚Äôt have to look to news for that just look around you and your local govt hospitals:\n\ni) Covid situation is actually worse.\nii) While media has been on govt throat constantly and a gazillion articles are out how India is bad, it doesn‚Äôt make situation at ground any more or less dangerous. \n\n\nMedia reporting has been questionable on both sides in last decade or so. But googling the status of covid and you seeing a million articles how govt is incompetent doesn‚Äôt add anything of value to solution. It just adds to paranoia of people when all they see is news about shortages and deaths.\n\nIt is same people media claims to protect. And any sane people will know that these articles which have closed looping of sources i.e. one article quoting another in the name of source, are critical of government irrespective of truth.\n\nIf you search IPL and covid, you will notice how media doesn‚Äôt like IPL at all and broadly there are two reasons:\ni) a significant number of people are watching IPL at prime time peak hours instead of their news streams.\nii) IPl might be only source of little detour they can take from daily news of covid, which doesn‚Äôt sit well with ‚Äúscaring people to oblivion‚Äù strategy.\n\nSo I wanted to say two things:\ni) Situation is serious. Do not go out unless absolutely needed or there is no way for you stay at home. \nii) Do not give in to paranoia being shoved down your throat. Be reasonable. You being paranoid doesn‚Äôt help a single soul. Feel free to watch IPL if its ON, sitting through news cycles 24 hours a day won‚Äôt change truth.\n\nProtect kids and elders.\n\nPeace, love and respect to everyone involved in this willingly or unwillingly.'<br />Author: 'imsaurabh3'<br />id: 'mypzns'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

India will overcome this situation. \n\nWatch out for the vultures from ‚Äúofficial Indian sub‚Äù who propagandize this situation how we should vote for pappu gandhi/kejruddin instead of modi. These are the same people disappointed that many Indians didn‚Äôt die in first wave and now are so excited and happy that they got a chance to show that ‚Äúmodi caused this‚Äù. Forgetting the fact that this surge is caused by Maharashtra/Delhi/Kerala state government‚Äôs incompetence and corruption.\n\nThe same vultures who don‚Äôt credit modi for handling first wave of coronavirus better are so adamant that same modi is responsible for this second wave. This is part of 5 lakh social media ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù recruited by anti Indian forces like congress and kejruddin.\n\nIndia is now handling this crisis better with oxygen mobilization. In coming days we will understand what‚Äôs the trigger for this second wave and understanding reasons behind it. \n\nIgnore the Indian &amp; western liberal death porn coverage. As an individual make sure you and your family &amp; friends wear masks and don‚Äôt go outside unless necessary. \n\nWe have positive trend emerging with frequent mobilization of medical supplies and oxygen. \n\nMera Bharath Mahan.
