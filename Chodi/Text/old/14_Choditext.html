But why no one talks about the collective well being of mankind? \n\nI see people talk about positivity (we suddenly heard a lot of it during the pandemic and lockdown) but as things are returning to a new normal, we are back to our old ways. Is "positivity" just a fancy term to milk or it holds any meaning in all seriousness? I get that it feels good to win a argument, but how is it going to do any better to us?\n\nHow is it too difficult to be neutral and question things objectively without clinging to a basic manifesto of someone else telling how we should lead our lives.\n\nI\'m no nostalgia merchant of how times were simpler, because they never were. But we can surely contemplate about how to go ahead. If I\'m being ignorant or delusional then please correct me, I\'ll look forward to know your opinions.
