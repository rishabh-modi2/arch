Is "positivity" just a fancy term to milk or it holds any meaning in all seriousness? I get that it feels good to win a argument, but how is it going to do any better to us?\n\nHow is it too difficult to be neutral and question things objectively without clinging to a basic manifesto of someone else telling how we should lead our lives.\n\nI\'m no nostalgia merchant of how times were simpler, because they never were.
