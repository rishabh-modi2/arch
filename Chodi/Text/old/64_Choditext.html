I'm growing tired of the usual compound lifting with isolation and HIIT at the gym. I found an amazing unconventional channel that focuses on traditional akhada based exercises using body weight or tools. I must say, I under-estimated Hindu Squats/Push ups and sapates. Did them yesterday and I currently am having a hard time walking. The channel has tons of other interesting traditional workouts and the dudes doing them are total beasts.

Right.. \nOK first of all in India nobody can arrest you if you have less than 1 KG ganja on your person.. Rhea was arrested by NCB not because she smoked weed, Miranda and others have confessed getting hard drugs like Crack, MDMA and LSD for her.. she is suspected of being involved in peddling of these substances... For God's sake she was denied bail, Do these idiots think the judge was idiot, he denied bail because someone smoked joints? Fuck man , how thick can these people be... \nNext , Patriarchy..  yeah the fans of SSR are blaming Rhea because they hate women... Barkha dutt just now wrote on WaPo about extreme patriarchy in Indian society in lieu of Rhea's arrest.. \nYeah , Mumbai police did an amazing job, no one should question that, there were indications of foul play, nobody should question that, A state govt was fighting tooth and nails to stop any other agency from taking a look at the case, that's not suspicious, The bechari GF was not coming forward to clear any doubt was in hiding, noone must question her because if you do so You are promoting Brahminical Patriarchy... But Kangna Ranaut's safety is in jeopardy because of the things she said (I do not endorse her opportunist attitude) , That is not patriarchy because she is a RW , and RW are not human beings.. \nSpeak Up because they are maligning us in front of the whole world.. imagine how deep the rot goes.. because the entire Bollywood and dalaal media is leaving no stones unturned to play the reverse uno card.. \nDo not let them win this time\nDo not"<br />Author: 'RaktimSoul'<br />id: 'iscfvj'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: "Tablighi Jamaat: Whitewashing of South Asia's largest COVID-19 vector"<br />Body: 'I\'m sure by now we all have read several news articles that seem to vindicate the Tablighi Jamaat from earlier accusations of having willingly spread COVID-19 in India. The verdict reportedly comes Aurangabad bench of Mumbai HC &amp; is now being repeatedly &amp; widely quoted by the far-left to further whitewash Tablighi Jamaat\'s image. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to spend some time bringing up relevant points &amp; starting a healthy debate on the same to better understand the verdict &amp; perhaps shed some more light on the entire fiasco.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst &amp; foremost, we as Indians know that there are several pockets of the judiciary that are known to be pro-Congress &amp; hence such uncharacteristically strong wording on a judicial verdict is hardly surprising and can be inferred to have been clearly meant for a certain audience. In fact, one can even assume that the verdict was meant more as a headline-worthy \'media fodder\' than any real rebuttal coming from a position of jurisprudence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext, I don\'t think a lot of people understand how exponential growth works when it pertains to highly infectious diseases. One can draw analogies with how a single neutron leads to a massive chain reaction in nuclear fission reactions to possibly understand how even 300 "active spreaders" (people not following quarantine directives, hiding symptoms, moving freely &amp; interacting with a large number of people) can now be attributed to having been the source of a large chunk of current active cases. However, what remains incontrovertible in the fact that at one point in time, TJ was directly attributed to more than 1/3rd of COVID cases in ENTIRE SOUTH ASIA. It was arguably much higher in India. Authorities of several different countries have expressed their disapproval of how TJ has operated in light of the COVID outbreak.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/world/asia/coronavirus-malaysia-muslims-outbreak.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/world/asia/coronavirus-malaysia-muslims-outbreak.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I know that just like the negative GDP figure, all commie-jihadis are gonna keep beating on this dead horse of a "verdict" until everybody forgets what ACTUALLY happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNevermind what you hear on the news, most people now actually have been given to understand that despite strict quarantine instructions, TJ sent its preachers to all corners of India &amp; literally asked them to gather people at mosques for prayers. Search "belgaum mosque covid" on YT and you can actually hear the guys admitting that they came straight from markaaz. They aren\'t locals &amp; they don\'t speak a word of Kannada. This has been one of the most self-evident &amp; shocking revelations for me. It\'s pretty much common knowledge in these parts now &amp; no amount of intellectual "whitewashing" is going to change that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\'m guessing BJP is going to let this one slide because it doesn\'t want to give even more reasons for stupid shitheads to screech "iSlaMOpHoBiA!!!!". Moreover, it\'s evident from their policies, that no matter what other parties say, they actually care about muslims in India and are unwilling to stir up a hornet\'s nest when they clearly aren\'t interested in vote bank politics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurther points to ponder/read up on:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- A person in ahmedabad(?) who made a presentation mathematically explaining how TJ is a major vector for COVID spread in India &amp; was arrested.\n\n\\- TJ\'s Wikipedia page which extensively documents their involvement in terrorist activities across the globe &amp; also has info on COVID related events. Imagine an organization so wrought in controversy that even Wikipedia can\'t scrub it clean from their pages.\n\n\\- The fact that foreign TJs were on illegal visas. They were supposed to be on missionary visas while actually being on tourist visas. This was one of the major reasons why they were detained.\n\n\\- TJs willfully staying in high population density areas like Dharavi\n\n\\- Chief Mulana spreading hateful rhetoric about how COVID is "allah ki NRC" &amp; further encouraging people to gather in mosques. The latter phenomenon was even observed in pakistan &amp; you\'ll find several posts regarding the same in relevant subreddits.\n\n\\- Well documented (on video) cases of bad behaviour by TJs while under quarantine/treatment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question to you guys is: Should an organization like Tablighi Jamaat, which has been deeply linked with terrorist activities across the globe &amp; whose stated goal (very explicit -- as indicated by their very name) is proselytization, be allowed to operate in India?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould love to hear you guys\' thoughts/inputs on this.'<br />Author: 'DanKoder1337'<br />id: 'irynkn'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: "You Can't Blame The People For POOR HINDI IMPLEMENTATION!"<br />Body: 'Please Note : I am from northern India, and many of the things I talk about in this article, are also partially and/or completely limited to the Hindi speaking/writing states. I want to make it clear that I don’t believe in forceful Hindi teaching, to places with regional languages that contain both vocal and written  forms. We have 22 languages for a reason.\n\nAlong with Hindi, I suppose that regional languages can also be included into the category of “poor implementation”, but I believe that Hindi is the one that has gotten the highest push back, obviously Sanskrit is much behind, and their is little to no implementation of it into studies, but I suppose that is a topic for another day.\n\nHindi, though it may be a language used everyday, has been really pushed down if you were to ask me. It became from a language, which was, absolutely fluent and dare I say beautifully spoken, to bringing it down to being limited to casual talks, and the least of government works. Many people also use this phrase along with the line, look at countries like Japan and China, where many people are proud of their language, and look at us who are stuck in indirect British Raj, in the form of education, jobs and just everything overall. And, they aren’t wrong, they are absolutely correct, but as I wrote two things in two separate articles of mine, which talk about implementation and root cause. Both of them are interconnected, and I will try my best simplify it, even though, I don’t have the best track record of keeping it all simple...\n\nThe root cause goes long back to the time of independence, even though India became its own country, the new people in power, weren’t eager in changing the nature of education nor government from completely English based to partial/complete move to Hindi, and I do get the point, the politicians obviously didn’t want to bring in such a drastic change into the newly, not so stable independent India, but all actions have consequences, and the consequences that came afterwards were grave and unexpected, to say the least. The reason to become a Hindi Graduate, or even taking interest in Hindi overall, became more of a force till class 8, than be it a norm, in a country, which’s northern part, mostly speaks in Hindi. Now that is the root cause, with a tad bit of introduction regarding the implementation, by implementation, I try to pressure upon the very importance of the step and, why it may have been a contributing factor, to degradation of the Hindi Language as a whole.\n\nThe implementation, is the step that I see many people talking about when they speak regarding the following subject, and they also use it to justify the degradation, as to how can it be so easy to change something which was a norm for 200 years(The norm is using English as a language in all subjects)\n\nI have a simple answer against it, look at this:\n\nWhen the British rule ended in India in the year 1947 the literacy rate was just **12%**. Over the years, India has changed socially, economically, and globally. After the 2011 census, literacy rate India 2011 was found to be **74.04%**.  \n\nI rest my case, and the “judges”(you, the reader) shall decide whether my statement is legitimate enough to be justify the incompetence of the government post-1947 specifically in this subject.'<br />Author: 'Generocide'<br />id: 'irwohx'<br />Flair ::swamivivek: High IQ</li>
<li>Title: 'The never ending Reservation'<br />Body: 'Reservation is bad.\n\nOk now what is the right way to make life less unfair of those who were discriminated and some are still being highly discriminated in society. And make a society where people feel more equal.\n\nThere are two types of Equality - 1. Equality of Opportunity   2. Equality of Outcome\n\nReservations are 2nd type of Equality - Equality of Outcome, what we need in our society is Equality of Opportunity. But equality of opportunity requires efforts and a good intention.\n\nFor understanding let me give you a analogy-\n\nIf we give some people Aata, Water and Ghee. We will get different results like Roti, Bati, Parantha, and bread. Some will just add sugar and can make Halwa and Laddu, some will make some other things.\n\nGiving everyone Aata, Water and Ghee is Equality of Opportunity.\n\nAnd if we say there are less production of Bati and Bread, and there are large production of Roti and Parantha .So we control the result and say that this much Roti and Paranthas should be produced.\n\nThis is Equality of Outcome.\n\n(Now wait before bashing me in replies and read the whole thing)\n\nNow come to the caste system. Caste system is not a process which is we evolve into as a society. It\'s not like everyone is making what they like to eat and that\'s why the production of Bati and Bread is less and Roti and Parantha is high, But some people are forced to choose and allowed only to eat Bati and Bread. And if they try to eat Parantha they were killed and beaten up.\n\nWhat reservation does is gives marginalised community a fixed number of seats which is the lower limit and seats can be higher than that and no one can steal those seats from them. That\'s it.\n\nWhat reservation don\'t do is - End discrimination and attrocities, Intercaste marriage, Financial empowerment of whole community, and other caste related issues. Then what is the thing which do all these things which Reservation can\'t do? Those things are - SC/ST attrocities (prevention) Act, Social campaigns and Awareness, Welfare Schemes.\n\nBut we have all these things and still there are discrimination in society, then what\'s missing? - What is the thing that is missing is "Equality of Opportunity". We have all these things but there\'s no intention to remove caste based discrimination. What we have is polarisation and appeasement, there\'s equality only on paper.\n\nWhat we have -\n\nReservation, Free schools, Very less or non at all fees in forms, colleges and hostels, loan schemes for business, Prevention of Attrocities Act\n\nWhat we don\'t have -\n\nBetter facilities ( some don\'t have basic facilities) in those Schools and Colleges, No environment for even thinking of doing somethings else what currently doing, worst law and order system and many many other very important things which is required to have a Equality of Opportunity.\n\n(Most of the marginalised community people loose at School level itself, only "financially sound and very few dedicated" people from these community enjoy the benefits of reservation. And for most of them there is atleast one more generation which is at same place)\n\nSo, in the end I only wanted to say is that if there\'s no or enough Equality of Opportunity no matter how much years and with any percentage of reservation , discrimination will not end.\n\nSo if you want to end this "unfair and anti-merit" reservation, first demand Equality of Opportunity, without these nothing will change. Don\'t vote for who will give your community how much reservation or who will end reservation, vote who will create environment for Equality of Opportunity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit - Also read this I find these interesting -  [In countries with higher gender equality, women are less likely to get STEM degrees](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/02/does-gender-equality-result-in-fewer-female-stem-grads)\n\n[The More Gender Equality, the Fewer Women in STEM](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/the-more-gender-equality-the-fewer-women-in-stem/553592/)\n\nAnd in India -  [India tops the world in India tops the world in producing female graduates in STEM but ranks 19th in employing them](https://www.businessinsider.in/careers/news/india-tops-the-world-in-producing-female-graduates-in-stem-but-ranks-19th-in-employing-them/articleshow/74117413.cms?utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=Click_through_social_share)\n\nWomen in India are at the bottom in hierarchy in every caste/religion/tribe.

<li>Title: 'Byjus and WhiteHatJr are harassing me. Please help ..'<br />Body: ' \n\nI posted a video on youtube and Byjus stooges got it removed for copyright infringement. They got my quora also banned for speaking against them. Please see the video and see if I violated any copyright infringements. This text below is the appeal I have done to Youtube for removing the ban on me.\n\n*"*\n\n*The removal of the video was not just a mistake, it was in fact an intentional and direct attack on my freedom of speech.*\n\n*1. The content in the video was original and I recorded it from my phone. The background audio was the natural audio, it wasn\'t any music or something like that.*\n\n*2. Aiplex software works on behalf of Byjus and they are trying to suppress all opinions raised against Byju\'s company. On Quora also they are banning everyone who has raised any voice against them. This is totally wrong and it is against my freedom of speech. I have full right to express my review of Byju\'s company. They target 6-year-old kids with their false advertisements and I can\'t even speak against it?*\n\n*3. The video was COMPLETELY mine and Aiplex has no right to remove it. They did it so that now they can get my personal information to harass me. But let\'s make it clear that I wont be suppressed. I will move to the courts and go all the way to get my freedom to express my opinion.*\n\n*4. Byjus is looting people and forcing them to take loans. In fact, Byju\'s and WhiteHat Jr themselves are violating copyright infringements of Google, Elon Musk, BlueOrigin, Barak Obama, Bill Gates, and the list goes on. They are using their names illegally in their youtube ads. How come you YouTube guys didn\'t see any wrong in that? How is that allowed and you are banning my channel for expressing my opinion about them?*\n\n*WhiteHatJr has been selling false pipe dreams of 150 crore INR salary to 6-year-old kids, and I can\'t express my opinion about that?*\n\n*Reviews of WhiteHatJr on Google Play store are all Fake, copy paste, and repeat. Hey Google, how is that allowed and you are banning me? Under IPC section 416, fake reviews are illegal in India. Still, google play store isn\'t looking into it and banning my account for speaking this out loud!*\n\n*WhiteHatJr is using Barak Obama\'s video which he made for non-profit organization* [*code.org*](https://code.org/)\n\n*.*\n\n*This is the original video:*\n\n*Hey Google, how can anyone use Barak Obama’s video in their ads and I can\'t even post a video of a balloon?*\n\n*WhiteHatJr seems not to care about copyright infringements and has gone completely shameless in selling their course which is already freely available on the internet.*\n\n*Youtube people please look into this closely and please dont let them harass me like this again because in the future also I will keep posting about their false advertisements and fake reviews.*\n\n*I will also be posting this entire ‘Counter Notification’ on social media to make it public.*\n\n*"*\n\nThe video which got removed from youtube was this: [https://twitter.com/whiteHatSnr/status/1304298709916639232](https://twitter.com/whiteHatSnr/status/1304298709916639232)\n\nPlease support us at [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJuE85w2kyFapd5\\_J9NDFPA/](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJuE85w2kyFapd5_J9NDFPA/)\n\n[https://twitter.com/whiteHatSnr](https://twitter.com/whiteHatSnr)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNew here in Reddit, suggestions are welcome.\n\n [\\#ByjusBubble](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/byjusbubble/)  \n[\\#WhiteHatJrScam](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/whitehatjrscam/)  \n[\\#ByjusFraud](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/byjusfraud/)  \n[\\#ByjuScam](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/byjuscam/)  \n[\\#Byjus](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/byjus/)  \n[\\#whitehatjr](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/whitehatjr/)'<br />Author: 'whitehatsr'<br />id: 'irulvy'<br />Flair ::star: OC है बे </li>

<li>Title: 'Ancient Bharat #1 : The Sarasawati Civilization'<br />Body: "Thought I'd share something about our history. Lemme know if you'd like me to share more and give feedback \n\nSource: Michel Danino's On the Trail of Sarasawati\n\nResearchers have officially accepted the existence of the mythical Saraswati river mentioned in the rigved. The current channel of Ghaggar-Hakra basin in Rajasthan is the remnants of the ancient river. This basin and the whole channel was discovered by the British Archaeologists back in the early years 1900s. This only positive outcome from the British era I believe. \n\nAlso, later it was found that in total 3781 Harrapan sites have been found across Pakistan and India. Out of this 2378 found on the Sarasawati basin and only 835 found in the Indus river basin. The other 568 sites have been found in the Gangetic plains. This clearly shows the vastness of our civilization and the scale at which governance and logistics occured in a time which is atleast 4000 years old. The oldest site is supposedly Rakhigarhi which dates back to 8000 BCE. \n\nOne of the sites found is under the walls and premises of Delhi's Purnana Qila (Old Fort) but not many are aware about obviously because of the propagandist education system. Harrappan style wells have been found there and there was a proposal to create a shed there for people to visit but nothing has been done yet. \n\nAlso some of the artifact's found from all of these sites are pottery, jewelry (made of shells similar to what Rajasthani women wear as bangles even today), dice, shivlings, fire alters in the shape of yoni of the shiv ling, hunting spears etc. \n\nLater research in the 20th century showed satellite images of the course of the river and revealed that Sarasvati's width would have been 22 kms ( Amazon river width is 24 kms) so it was a huge river, no wonder it was known as the birthplace of Vedic knowledge since the river is mentioned 22 times in the rigveda and Ganga is mentioned only 3 times. \n\nThe concept of globalisation is also not new since Indus Sarasawati Civilization used to trade with Iran and central asian civilization. \n\nThe writing and script of the civilization has not been decoded yet but work is ongoing. \n\nThe 2 major mysteries of the Civilization\n 1. In all the excavations and research, historians and anthropologists have not been able to find any mention of a King or one ruler or who governed the region. \n\n2. NO proof of warfare, conflict and weaponry has been found in any of the sites creating a big mystery as to how a primitive civilization survived without any conflict from outside intervention or internal rebellion. The case rests kn the fact that was no rebellion or any outside intervention. The societal structure was such that conflict was not existent. \n\n\nRecent discoveries of chariots and swords in Sanauli, U.P give a new turn in the art of warfare in the region. (Remnants of Mahabharata?) Research is ongoing. \n\nI am an avid reader of history, non fiction and Archaeology. Let me know if you guys want me to share more stuff like this. I have a lot to share. :) And yes I'll share the source too. \n\nजय श्री राम।   🏹"<br />Author: 'siddhantprakashsingh'<br />id: 'irhnfk'<br />Flair :इतिहास :H:</li>

Vignesh scored 370/720 in 2019 while the cutoff for MBBS for 600+ However 2 reserved category students could easily have passed with half the marks since cut off for reserved categories is 100+.\n\nThis reminds of the case of S anitha a dalit NEET aspirant who committed suicide in 2017 who was apparently from the same region. Anitha had filed a case in the Supreme Court against NEET after scoring 86/720, while the cutoff was 100..\n\nThen we wonder, why intelligent and deserving individuals leave the country.

<li>Title: 'मिथ्या'<br />Body: '\nअजीब सी फिल्मों में से एक फिल्म थी “मिथ्या” जिसे रजत कपूर ने 2008 में बनाया था। इसमें एक फिल्म में एक्स्ट्रा का काम करने वाले की शक्ल बिलकुल स्थानीय डॉन राजे भाई से मिलती थी। राजे भाई के दुश्मन राजे को मारकर उसकी जगह इस एक्स्ट्रा को बिठा देना चाहते थे। उनका ही गुर्गा दुश्मन की सल्तनत का मुखिया हो तो पूरे इलाके पर कब्ज़ा करने में उन्हें आसानी होती।\nपूरी कहानी में झोल ये होता है कि वो एक्स्ट्रा को राजे की जगह डाल तो देते हैं मगर एक दुर्घटना में उसके सर पर चोट लग जाती है। उसकी याददाश्त जाती रहती है और जैसे जैसे वो एक्स्ट्रा ठीक होता है, वो अपने आप को सचमुच का राजे भाई और उसके परिवार को अपना परिवार मानने लगता है। यही कहानी का ट्विस्ट है कि अब विरोधी गुट क्या करेगा? क्या वो अपनी ही हरकत की पोल खोले? या नकली राजे भाई को झेले?\nफिल्म में कई अच्छे कलाकार हैं जैसे रणवीर शौरी राजे भाई के किरदार में है, उसके अलावा विनय पाठक, सौरभ शुक्ला, हर्ष छाया, नेहा धूपिया और नसीरुद्दीन शाह भी हैं। दिमाग के अगले हिस्से में इंसान की अपनी एक छवि होती है, वही उसकी पहचान होती है। वो बदल जाये तो आदमी बदलेगा या नहीं, ऐसे दार्शनिक सवाल पर फिल्म बनी है। कलाकारों ने अच्छा काम किया या बुरा उसपर भी अलग चर्चा की जा सकती है।\nलेकिन हमारा ध्यान फ़िलहाल फिल्म के सिर्फ एक दृश्य पर है। इस दृश्य में विरोधी गुट यानी सौरभ शुक्ला और विनय पाठक वगैरह मिलकर एक्स्ट्रा रणवीर शौरी को राजे भाई की तरह बर्ताव करना सिखा रहे होते हैं। उन्हें पता था कि ये एक्स्ट्रा मामूली आदमी है और वो बड़े गुंडे इसलिए बीच बीच में वो उसके साथ बदतमीजी भी कर बैठते थे। नेहा धूपिया के सामने पीटना या बेइज्जत होना रणवीर को पसंद नहीं आ रहा होता।\nअचानक वो पिस्तौल उठा लेता है और बिलकुल राजे भाई वाले किरदार में आ जाता है। एक गुर्गे की कनपटी पर पिस्तौल टीकाकार वो बिलकुल राजे भाई के से अंदाज में उसे धमकाता है। आखिर वो राजे भाई वाले अंदाज में कहता है, “बोल! बोल कि मेरा नाम झंडूलाल है और मेरी अकल मेरे पिछवाड़े में घुस गयी है!” मरता क्या ना करता? गुंडा दोहराता है, “मेरा नाम झंडूलाल है और मेरी अकल मेरे पिछवाड़े में घुस गयी है!”\nकुछ साल पहले की बात है जब 19 नवम्बर 2012 को बाल ठाकरे की शवयात्रा निकली और पूरी मुंबई बंद रही तो दो लड़कियों ने सोशल मीडिया पर कुछ लिख दिया। बिलकुल निरीह, बिना कोई नॉटी जैसा शब्द इस्तेमाल किये बिना, बस शहर बंद क्यों, इतना ही पूछा था। इतने पर लड़कियों को मुंबई की तेज-तर्रार पुलिस ने गिरफ्तार कर लिया था। कड़ी पूछताछ और कानूनी करवाई के बाद, माफ़ी-वाफी मांगकर लड़कियां जैसे-तैसे छूटी थीं। इस मामले में किसी को नारीवाद नहीं सूझा था। कोई सूरमा “रोजेज आर रेड, वायलेट्स आर ब्लू...” करता हुआ नहीं निकला था।\nबाकी मसला बड़ा मजेदार है क्योंकि\n# बाबरसेना का नाम आते ही तमाम शेखुलर, बुद्धिपिशाच, लिबटार्ड और नारीवादी अपना नाम झंडूलाल बताने लगते हैं और उनका नारीवाद उनके पिछवाड़े में घुस जाता है! ऐसा ही है न?'<br />Author: 'jhaansi_rani'<br />id: 'iqlbrt'<br />Flair ::snoo_trollface:Bait molana Bait</li>

<li>Title: '[OC]Is the war between India and China Imminent due to the fact that the 15th Dalai Lama has to be incarnated soon?'<br />Body: " S*ome preface:*\n\nDalai  Lamas are important monks of the Gelug school, the newest school of  Tibetan Buddhism. The Dalai lama can only be incarnated in Tibet and the  14th Dalai lama fled off to India to avoid persecution in 1959 China  Uprising. Since then China has been cracking down various religious  figures especially Buddhists in Tibet. China also hates India due to the  fact that the Dalai Lama lives as a refugee there.\\[[s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama)\\]\n\nWhat I did:\n\nI  calculated the birth date difference between every Dalai Lama to exist  yet. The maximum difference of years between two consecutive Dalai Lamas  was 84 years between the First and Second Dalai Lama. If we consider  the birth date of the current Dalai Lama(1935), he should have died and  the new Dalai Lama should have been incarnated(does not necessarily mean reincarnated) before 2019. But that's not the case, and thus this Dalai Lama becomes the highest reigning one.\n\nThe  difference between the death and the birth of next consecutive Dalai  Lama has never been more than 2 years. The current Dalai Lama is 85  years old. With the recent Sudden Flare up of tensions among India and  China, and also with almost the whole world due to the Chinese Pandemic,  I think War in imminent and it will should lead to the liberation of  Tibet. The consecutive Dalai Lama would be born within 2 years of the  death of current Dalai Lama(the 14th)[\\[s\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dalai_Lamas)\n\nnote: Dalai Lama cannot be reincarnated until the previous one dies."<br />Author: '--I-love-you-'<br />id: 'ipd016'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li>

You wants to open a Gurukul to teach the kids of the village about Vedas and Upanishads. But as this hurts the sentiments of Muslims and also because the previous verdict was in your favour the Sarpanch didn't let you build the Gurukul ON YOUR OWN LAND, WITH YOUR OWN MONEY. So in short he didn't let you do your +ve.\nAnd while the Sarpanch was able to revert back the - ves of Muslim community and their rate of doing destructive activities have come to a low value, it didn't stop.\nAre you getting it.
