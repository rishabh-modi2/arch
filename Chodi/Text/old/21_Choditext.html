<li>Title: 'Help my Mom fight Ovarian Cancer'<br />Body: "Hello everyone, I'm writing this post with a heavy heart. A week back my Mom was diagnosed with Ovarian cancer.\xa0 My Mom is the strongest woman know, who has faced numerous hardships in her life, but watching her go through such pain now is gut wrenching. \n\nMy Mom is a educator, she has devoted 38 years of her life to teach the young. She always told me that her job saved her life, when I was young I didn't think much of it. As I gained life experience, I understood what she actually meant by it. \n\nMy parents separated when I was in the 4th grade, my sister was away in boarding school for the pyshically challenged. Mom was burdened with our care. With house chores, her job and taking care of my short comings she never got the time to take care of herself.\xa0 My father was a normal man, abusive towards my Mom, sister and me, whenever he had alot on his mind. He would never share what's going on with him. I don't blame him though, even he has suffered alot in his life and still does. \n\nThe silver lining of this situation was our Mom's and Dad's side of the family, with whom we had minimum contact. They came together to express emotional and financial support. But, the resources they were able to pool together was not enough to complete the required treatment. To help my Mom, I've created a fundraiser through Ketto. \n\nI kindly request all of you to help as much as you can, Please share this among your friends and family. \n\nThank you.\n\nLink for the fundraiser: https://www.ketto.org/fundraiser/my-mother-is-fighting-for-her-life-and-we-need-your-support-to-save-her-447172?utm_source=external_ct&amp;utm_medium=whatsapp&amp;utm_Campaign=sm_campaigner_sac_w4"<br />Author: 'PantsyrSAM'<br />id: 'ocu4kc'<br />Flair ::oc-: OC है BC!💡</li>

What if all these years the things they told us about what our Tricolour represents was all wrong.\n\n  \nYou know how they denote Saffron stands for sacrifice/strength, White stands for peace, and Green stands for fertile lands. We can skip the Ashoka Chakra's significance for this context.  \n\n\nWhat if Saffron stood for Hindus, White stood for Rice Bags and Green stood for the globally-hated-self-proclaiming-peacefool-cult. I believe they twisted the fact about the tricolour all these years. They wanted to show that India belongs to these 3 religions, which is an unfair depiction in my opinion, because India was the land of Hindus before these 2 religions entered the land. But since they couldn't outright tell that the land belongs to 3 religious groups they came up with the notion of Strength, Peace and Fertile lands.  \n\n\nThis is just something the voice inside me pointed out.

The Imams says it's women's fault for getting raped. He says that a women needs to cover herself if she doesn't want to get raped. The dude goes on to say that if a women is not covered up and then a man will catch her eyes and than do nasty things with her because he can't control his desire. Like WTF.\n\nWhat is more messed up is that males don't feel guilty and the police are brainwashed too and conditioned that way. I see such behaviour in Muslim dominated areas in India too. They feel embolden in raping girls and then forcefully concert them to protect their dignity. Women are literally thought of as objects of pleasure and it just gave me chills that there are people like that. \n\nLink to the documentary. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/XY7QOlqirns"<br />Author: 'Legionoo7'<br />id: 'oaa8fg'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
