<li>Title: 'Will BJP win 2024 Elections'<br />Body: "I know its a bit early to discuss this but by looking at the current BJP's stance, am worried about it. You can say am overthinking but nothing bad about having a thought.\n\nAlthough the Bengali election result was a mixed bag for me, i am at peace with myself. Initially I thought didi will be dethroned but never gave a thought about the (B)uslim majority (second (B)angladesh) and their inclination towards political parties. So, was ok with the results. But again, coming from 3 to 70+ in a (B)uslim dominated state is quite encouraging at the end.\n\nBut the present stance of our PM-Mota bhai duo against some liberandus, jihadis, anti-nationals, rice-bag conversions, love-jihaads, abusing of hindu temples and gods, and the protection of their own karyakartas is a bit disappointing. \n\nIts now or never. Justice delayed is justice denied.\n\nYes, yes, there are plenty positive things happened but equally bad things or on high rise and govt ain't doing shit. I cannot pin point some examples where govt is failing miserably but agree they are there. \n\nSo my dear chads.. whats your opinion? Can we see BJP V 3.0 in 2024 or no?"<br />Author: 'pocketreviewer'<br />id: 'nig2bv'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'I just reading Ayurveda and realized that Ramdv Baba is con man (kind of)'<br />Body: 'That\'s right. That\'s a bold statement.\n\n**Baba Ramdv doesn\'t know Ayurveda.** And if you are think that "rAjiV dIxiT" knew ayurveda, you are still wrong my friend. ***He was as big if not a bigger fool.***\n\n**People like Baba Ramdv, Rajiv Dixit are an insult to Ayurveda.**\n\nHe could\'ve turned this corona into a fantastic possibility by REALLY studying ayurveda and making the CLASSIC ayurvedic medicines and not just making up his own trash like coronil and call it "ayurvedic".\n\nThat\'s right. **Coronil is NOT a Classic Ayurvedic formula. It\'s his "own" creation.**\n\nThere are only a few truly Ayurveda experts left today. One of them is **Nityanandam Shree** on YouTube. He knows TRUE ayurveda.\n\nIn one of his recent videos he cured a corona positive old lady whose oxygen level was 84 within a matter of days.\n\n**It is 100% possible to not only cure but cure severe covid cases MUCH faster and safely** without any side effects (like black fungus is seen in people who used steroids) using Ayurvedic medicines.\n\nThere are some **INCREDIBLE and Strong** medicines in Ayurveda that are used in **emergency**.\n\nThese medicines are called as **\'ras\'** and are generally in tablet form. E.g. Laxmi Vilas Ras, Grahani Shardool Ras, Nav Jivan Ras, etc.\n\nThese medicines which have the word \'ras\' in them have some really strong ingredients like **purified mercury, purified Sulphur, abhrakh bhasma (mica), purified shilajit**, etc.\n\nYou may think "but mercury is dangerous, right?" Yes.\n\nBut **\'purified mercury\' acts FOR you** and not against you when taken in right fomurla/combination and quantities. These medicines are completely safe and have little to no side effects.\n\n**These medicines are so damn powerful that they literally even cure 2 decades old chronic ailments within few months** which the modern medicine can never do.\n\nRamdv baba doesn\'t make these medicines like \'ras\' because, first of they are hard to make, take a lot of time and effort and the profit margins are thin.\n\nRamdv baba is pure businessman. Most of Patanjali\'s products are highly deceptive. For e.g. they claim to have zero Maida in biscuits but the very first ingredient is "refined wheat flour".\n\n**DO NOT EVER underestimate Ayurveda** just because of idiots like Ramdv baba and his stupid medicines like coronil. TRUE Ayurveda is still till this day the most advanced, most evolved, most effective and most complex medical system on the planet.'<br />Author: 'johnkarter767612'<br />id: 'nia9ej'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>

<li>Title: 'Losing all my Hopes. Either READ till the END or IGNORE.'<br />Body: 'To be honest, I don\'t have any hope left for Hinduism. Seems like this century will be our end. Of course I am not talking about complete eradication, definitely there would be some Hindus practising their Dharma but as a world religion which we were for thousands of years, we would surely be reduced to a small minority in future.\n\nEven at present, I hardly see any Hindu men and women teaching Dharma, Adhyatma and about Islamic invasions, genocide of Hindus to their children. Half of these children would grow up to be Hindu hating Pro Islamists and leftists. Another half would probably convert to Christianity and Islam even though their own Hindu parents are deemed for eternal hell according to these bigoted cults.\n\n**You are a fool if you think there are 100 crore Hindus. Just having a hindu name doesn\'t make you a Hindu. I can show you hundreds of "Sitaram" who are hardcore communists. Hundreds of "Ramkrishna" who denigrate Hinduism in every way possible and sympathise with those same Muslims who plundered our land, looted our wealth, desecrated temples and try to demean, mock,threaten, murder, dehumanise practising Hindus in every way possible.**\n\nTo all those who say there are good Muslims too, those good Muslims ain\'t going to save you and your family when the radical jihadis will attack. They won\'t raise their voice . They would be spectators secretly wishing every single kafir to either die or convert. Where were the good Muslims when Kashmiri Hindus were driven out? Don\'t get me wrong. I too have muslim friends but I very well know they will never raise their voice against radical Muslims while hurling every possible abuse to Hinduism. They won\'t, my viraat brothers and sisters. They won\'t.\n\nDespite knowing their intentions clearly, if Hindus still don\'t unite and save their Dharma, then it would be the final end of us. I am from West Bengal. After elections, there was a huge violence against Hindus who voted for BJP. Men, women, children, even animals, mercilessly stoned, raped, stabbed to death. And do you know what was the reaction of my leftist "Hindu" friends and teachers????\n\n&gt;*"Haha, they deserve it. Idiot Bhakts"*\n\nI am not exaggerating. How can we so blind is beyond my understanding. Even liberal Christians in Western countries are not that cucked. A single "*Samuel Paty Incident*" was enough to trigger a retaliation even among the most liberal French citizens.\n\nPolice, media, government, Judiciary, schools, universities, filled with such kind of scum. I am really tired, yaar. The most violent are being called the most peaceful. How? How is this possible? Is this the maya of Kaliyuga our scriptures warned about? I am completely lost. The world doesn\'t make any sense.\n\nWe Will Keep Posting and Posting and they would keep doing their real stuff on Ground Zero.\n\nThe only thing we could do is "Abhi Tandav hoga", "Jago Hindu Jago".'<br />Author: 'vacationinParadis'<br />id: 'nhtj7g'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Please hear me out first . Women need not be soldiers .'<br />Body: " \n\nI present my arguement based on the  authority of Lord Shiva , Sage Vashishtha , Lord Parshuram , Sage Ved  Vyas and Agni Puran . Why so because it is knowledge from Lord Shiva  consolidated and spread by other's which forms Dhanurveda .\n\nIt  is in the ethics of war that any fleeing enemy ,an unarmed ,an  unconscious ,a surrendered enemy and children and women are not to be  fought with nor to be struck down . The only basis in which this can be  countered is with the tale of Mata Kali being the only one to kill  Raktbija and showing that women are also allowed to wage war .\n\nHowever from two cases we can infer that it is not true .\n\nFirst  is the Tripurasur war when Lord Shiva uses the penultimate essence of  half the deites as an arrow , Lord Vishnu and the other half of deities  as a chariot and Lord Brahma as a bow . The reason why the tripurasurs  could not be destroyed was that they had a boon which caused them to  have three floating cities which would align only once in a thousand  years and had to be destroyed all at once . So before they aligned in  front of all heavenly beings Lord Shiva destroyed and reconstructed them  within a span of  a second proving that although boons have power he is  still supreme however to uphold the sanctity of Lord Brahma's word he  destroyed them once and for all when they aligned .\n\nFor  this Shivas word is supreme (the same which in Dhanurveda forbods women  from going to war ) and he also could have taken care of Raktbija .\n\nThe  other is when Andhaka Asur attacks Goddess Parvati she and all the  other goddess take avatar and battle him but are not able to defeat his  army . However when Lord Shiva strikes he within a single blow defeats  Andhaka Asur who is also his son . In that single strike Andhaka gains  wisdom and decides to stay as a Gana"<br />Author: 'Sage_of_Saffron'<br />id: 'nho0t3'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>

The campaign was "support democracy in china".**\n\nBut of course he couldn\'t do sh!t as it is china.\n\n**2) In one of his interviews with rNDTV during the congress regime, he said "India is doing great" (irony)**\n\n**3) In one of Strings video, Vinod talks about "gene sharp theory". The guy gene sharp wrote a book named \'from dictatorship to DEMOCRACY\'.**\n\nNow what does that tell you?\n\n**These people are "socialists" (anarchists too whatsoever).**\n\nThey **WANT** democracy. ***But they are fking blind***. They think hindus in India are oppressing the minorities.

Then these idiots send large amounts of money to India to ***"fight nationalism"*** without even knowing facts or history. They don\'t know it\'s actually the Hindus who are in danger.\n\nAnd by the way, s0ros is just one of the names. I\'m sure there are MANY such people, you just don\'t hear about them.\n\n**What is the solution?**\n\nQuite Simple. Only 2 Steps:\n\n**1) History** \\- The ultimate red pill is the history. Even in mahabharata somewhere Krishna says "the knowledge of history will wipe out ignorance". We need to HEAVILY invest to tell the world about the REAL Bharatiya Itihas. Praveen Mohan is doing a great job in this.\n\nWe need to make documentaries talking about atrocities by Mughals, Britishers in India. How pakistan, afghanistan, bangladesh, kashmir, etc were once Hindu but "something happened" and now they are not.\n\n**2) Economy -** Get out of the "job" mentality. Start swadeshi businesses. Solve local problems. Create swadeshi products, apps, software, etc. Make use of the immense workforce we have. This will give us the money to tackle the international fake narratives and to create our own.\n\nThese two things will avoid the creation of future s0ros and will ensure safety and stability.'<br />Author: 'johnkarter767612'<br />id: 'nhjvg8'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Fallacies of "Hindu Atheists"'<br />Body: 'A. The misconception of Charvaka\n\nI have seen a trend of "so-called-atheists" larping under the banner of Charvakas/Lokayatas. It shows a clear misunderstanding of what Charvaka philosophy actually stood for, and rest is just contradictory projection of wishfulness. People who call themselves Charvaka, but do not reject Sanatan Dharma do not understand the contradictory nature of their talks.\n\nCharvakas are regarded as the most radical of the Indian philosophical systems.\xa0 **It rejects the existence of other worldly entities such an immaterial soul or god and the after-life**.\xa0 Its primary philosophical import comes by way of a scientific and naturalistic approach to metaphysics.\xa0 Thus, it **rejects ethical systems that are grounded in supernaturalistic cosmologies, and consequently the vedas.**\n\nB.  Nastik\n\nIn *Nyāyasūtra (* 1.1.2 )*, i*n course of explaining what is meant by false knowledge *(mithyājñāna),* Vātsyāyana enumerates how evils produced under the influence of attraction and repulsion lead to moral lapses: “Driven by the evils and through the agency of the body one commits violence, theft and incest. Through words (one is led to) plotting against others, covetousness and *nāstikya.*”. Vātsyāyana adds that motivations like these are sinful, resulting in *adharma,* lack of merit. \n\nAcross scriptures, *nāstika* have been associated with irreligiosity.\n\nThe Manusmriti very succinctly explains *nāstika* as ‘a defiler of the Veda’, ***nāstiko vedanindakaḥ*** (2.11).      \n Defiling the Veda is one of the worst sins in the eye of Brahminical orthodoxy. By including *nāstikya* in the enumeration of vices, Vātsyāyana records his unflinching devotion to the Veda as well as his own orthodoxy. \n\nIt is, however, well known that the term, *nāstika,* is also employed by the Buddhists and Jains to designate those who, instead of denying the validity of the Veda, used to deny the existence of the other-world or after-life (*paraloka*) and hence the concept of virtue and vice. \n\nSince the Buddhists and Jains had nothing to do with the Veda and hence had no concern in upholding it as a sacred text, they had to put forward their own meaning of *nāstikya* in order to brand the common enemy of all religions, namely, the materialists  ( Charvaka and co. )\n\nIn whichever sense we take *nāstikya*, there is no room for doubt regarding the moral disapproval that goes with the word.    \n\nThe Buddhists and the Jains also call the materialist *nāstika* or *ṇāhiyavādī,* because he does not believe in rebirth and the notion that the meritorious and sinful acts of previous birth would influence the course of future life. Denial of rebirth and hence of after-life *(paraloka)* is another characteristic position of the Indian materialists.\n\nFunnily enough, A Charvaka aphorism runs as follows: ***paralokino \'bhāvāt paralokābhāvaḥ****,* “There is no other world because of the absence of any other-worldly being” (i.e. the transmigrating self).'<br />Author: 'ViciousPhilosopher'<br />id: 'nhc156'<br />Flair ::oc-: OC है BC!💡</li>

<li>Title: 'Aryan invasion of India'<br />Body: "Hello, I read somewhere that Hindu culture is not indigenous to India but was brought in by Sanskrit speaking Indo-Europeans in about 1500BC. They were white people with blue or brown eyes and they wrote the Rig Veda. I read that indigenous Indians at that time were a mix of Iranian farmers and (very dark skinned) hunter gatherers, but they had a great Indus valley civilisation that was very peaceful.\n\nThis is very interesting if it is true. Can somebody who understands about this (and isn't too politically biased) give an honest and reasonable opinion about this issue?\n\nThanks"<br />Author: 'pengostarxxx'<br />id: 'nh27oh'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>

They are united, watchful and close in when they see us weak.\n\nThe years we have spent trying to become a better human being, they have invested to become more persistent and gotten better at hiding their intentions. Anyone can protect their loved once when they are alive, but what about after you die? This is systematic, calculated and pure evil.\n\nI've always been taught to give them a benefit of the doubt, and I've seen the payment for that. If nothing else then learn to maintain distance and  maintain distinction of friend and foe. JAI HIND!"<br />Author: 'platinum_member'<br />id: 'ngfho7'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Hilarious story - Israeli Dog and Arab Dog'<br />Body: 'Time for some laughter.... The Israelis and Arabs realized that, if they continued fighting, they would someday end up destroying the whole world. So they decided to settle their dispute with an ancient practice: a duel of two, like David and Goliath. This "duel" would be a dog fight. The negotiators agreed each side would take 5 years to develop the best fighting dog they could. The dog that won the fight would earn its people the right to rule the disputed areas. The losing side would have to lay down its arms for good.\n\n The Arabs found the biggest, meanest Dobermans and Rottweilers in the world. They bred them together and then crossed their offspring with the meanest Siberian wolves. They selected only the biggest, strongest puppy of each litter, fed it the best food and killed all the other puppies. \nThey used steroids and trainers in their quest for the perfect killing machine. When the 5 years were up, they had a dog that needed steel prison bars on its cage. Only expert trainers could handle this incredibly nasty and ferocious beast. \n\nWhen the day of the big dog-fight finally arrived, the Israelis showed up with a very strange-looking animal, a Dachshund that was 10 feet long! Everyone at the dogfight arena felt sorry for the Israelis. No one there seriously thought this weird, odd-looking animal stood any chance against the growling Arab beast. \n\nAll the bookies took one look and predicted that the Arab dog would win in less than a minute. \n\nAs the cages were opened, the Dachshund slowly waddled toward the center of the ring, watching the Arab dog. The Arab dog leaped from its cage and charged the giant wiener-dog. As he got to within an inch of the Israeli dog, the Dachshund opened its jaws wide and swallowed the Arab beast whole in one go! There was nothing left but a small puff of fur from the Arab killer dog\'s tail floating to the ground. \n\nThe stunned crowd of international observers, bookies and media personnel let out a collective gasp of disbelief and surprise. \n\nEventually, the Arabs along with the press approached the Israelis, muttering and shaking their heads in disbelief. "We do not understand," said the Arabs\' leader, "Our top scientists and breeders worked for 5 long years with the meanest, biggest Dobermans, Rottweilers and Siberian wolves, and they developed an incredible killing machine of a dog! What did you do?"\n\n \n*\n \n*\nThe Israelis replied. "We gave a team of our Plastic surgeons 5 years to make a Crocodile look like a Dog."😜😜😀'<br />Author: 'mainhoonmadrasi'<br />id: 'ng5pfc'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihaad_Halal Certified</li>

The media Indian and Western ones really like to make article about this particular subject. They know it will shared and all.

So can someone tell if it’s that prevalent? \n\nEven if I’m not Hindu I always respected the religion, but I have to say that some practice are weird/backwards and it should be reformed for modern times. Because it’s used against us Indians to mock us and they don’t care about what religion you are (like I am Christian and don’t practice that) for them we all do that, they see that as more of a cultural practice than a religious one. That don’t help our international image. \n\nLike I was saying I’m not Hindu but always respected it and I see it as part of my history. And it’s hard for me to go in the comment section of the articles that talks about cow dung/piss, most of them is filled with racist comments and all. So I want know what most of the Hindus think about this issue?

<li>Title: 'Whatever, Israel vs. Palestine is still a Abrahamist vs. Abrahamist thing. We got no skin in the game, so stop sucking Israel ¢o¢k.'<br />Body: "Judaism, Xtianity, Islam are Abrahamic religions, in that they follow the same god, believing in His unitariness and solitariness. Consequently, their understanding of divinity is quite different from our Vedic view. We, the followers of the Vedas, have follow a different concept entirely, in that we believe in the omniscience of god, and see him inside everyone and everywhere.\n\nI know that this is a territorial dispute between them with origins in history/mythology, and you may ask how is this relevant in the present context. Well, you must know, because it matters, that Abrahamic religions, by default, are intolerant of non-believers and idol-worshippers (which includes Paganism); they are intolerant, because it is so mandated, towards other faiths, chief among them Vedic faith, for reasons already stated - there is no god except God. It's only because they're on the backfoot, due to various reasons, that the Jews are unable to follow the teachings of the Torah to the T, else they would not be any different than the Peacefuls if they set out to spread their faith.\n\nIsrael-India friendship is a marriage of convenience. Period. But, as people with morals, we must acknowledge their past favors and try to support them whenever we can possibly, but we should be wary of them for you never know what the future holds; we might want to accommodate them and pursue a peaceful course, but may not see the favor returned.\n\nThere's no need to fall all over ourselves to convey our support to the Jews. They're incomparably better than us, and can take care of their own shit; which means staying silent won't be that bad an idea. It's Abrahamist vs. Abrahamist at the end of the day.\n\n---\n\nवसुदेवसुतं देवं कंसचाणूरमर्दनम् | देवकीपरमानन्दं कृष्णं वंदे जगद्गुरुम् ||"<br />Author: 'ProfessorSW'<br />id: 'nf02ad'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Took whips of the white man and spend their life in servitude. Not all of them, but most of them did, until someone lead them to fight oppression. Let's not forget that they were weak nonetheless.

The Guru is the dispeller of the darkness of ignorance. There can be no greater good than the removal of ignorance.

During his rule, the majority was treated badly &amp; the whole state was into lawlessness due to his faulty policies\n\nThen the people of state selected another king from majority class\n\nThe king, true to his nature &amp; believes in the majority established rule of law in the state while upholding his own beliefs of his dharma. He secured the fort of his state and made it strong. This made the old king upset as his time seems to be over &amp; majority of people in state were not listening to him and he stands exposed\n\nThe state goes in an election every 5 years &amp; new elections were knocking on the door. The old king knew that without engineering a divide in majority, he can’t come back to power. To regain power the old king along with his key partner in-country hatched an idea to break the majority community\n\nHe sends in a Trojan Horse, his old untrained soldier into majority community. This soldier starts talking in favor of the majority community by abusing the minority community in worse language.\n\nThe majority community welcomed him with open arms and he touched the nerve center\n\nThis Trojan Horse lives in an area surrounded by a minority. While he abused the minority community openly, none in the minority community spoke against him or posed any harm to him. Even the minority supportive media who jump never miss a chance to abuse and insult the majority community stays silent. just no words from them\n\nBut one intelligent guy inside that fort from the majority community was closely watching this trojan horse. He exposed him to the majority community. Slowly the mature people start understanding the game of this trojan horse and understood that he is placed inside the majority community to break it from inside\n\nThis made the old king and his partners insecure and worried as the pack of cards had started falling. So they hatched a new plan. This time they send another one but from a minority community (The kind of supari killer available on rent). His task was not to kill the Trojan Horse but to pose as if he came to kill him and get arrested by fort guards. As planned the Guard arrested this guy with a local weapon and the news flashed inside the fort and the majority community.

He is even believed to be close to Modi. He recently filed a case to cancel Jagan's bail in corruption case. He is very vocal on YouTube. He was even granted Y security quoting threat to his life from his own party members.\n\nIn a cinematic fashion, 30 CID officers from Andhra Pradesh entered Telangana, entered MP's house , took him from the CRPF protection overnight, transported him to AP. MP was rejected bail but he accused 5 masked people entered his cell and assaulted him. He said, they kept on hitting his insoles repeatedly asking him in between to walk and hitting him again until he couldn't walk. His feet turned purple in the pics released by media. Government countered the argument that MP has Psoriasis hence his feet turned purple. Jagan's government didn't even care court's verdict of keeping MP in the hospital. He was transferred to jail. \n\nAlong with him, two tv channels were accused of the conspiracy to destabilize the government and were included in the affidavit. Now his family filed a bail petition in supreme court, fearing for his life. Imagine if a MP can be almost dragged /kidnapped from his house in broad daylight, and assaulted in the cell, what will be the state of a common man? Supreme court ordered to transfer him to army hospital for medical examination to determine the assault on him. \n\nNot much discussion in national media or here, hence posting."<br />Author: 'CoolCabinetMinister'<br />id: 'nedajj'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: "Hard Truth : Center's job is to protect constitution, not the people of Bharat"<br />Body: 'A lot of us right wingers are blaming Modi govt (and rightly so) for NOT protecting the killings / exodus / r@pes of bengali Hindus.   \n\n\nBut we must not forget that all the center could do is enable president\'s rule in bengal. That wouldn\'t change anything.  \n\n\nJust like mamta didi mentioned that what will you do when CRPF goes back ? who will protect you ? (openly in one of her rallies). she isn\'t wrong.  \n\n\n**99% of middle class aadarsh Hindu baalak (good boy) have been taught WRONG by our parents, teachers and NCERT books.**   \n\n\nHindus should NOT depend on center / state / UN for our safety.  \n\n\nIts the job of police / Army to follow orders. They followed orders (did nothing) in 1991 kashmir exodus and did nothing in 2021 bongol killings.   \n\n\nDharma / Rightousness is different. Just like during british times, a signboard read "dogs and Indians not allowed" was legal (but immoral), so is Indian govt just watching the killings of Hindus in cold blood.  \n\n\nA follower of Dharma would call out injustice even if he stood to benefit from it (imagine a muslim refusing to take minority scholarship  or christian americans acknowledging the role of church in slavery). Legal status is secondary, **morality** (what you think is right, treat others how you want to be treated) **is first.**  \n\n\n[https://captajitvadakayil.in/2021/01/04/sanatana-dharma-hinduism-exhumed-and-resurrected-capt-ajit-vadakayil/](https://captajitvadakayil.in/2021/01/04/sanatana-dharma-hinduism-exhumed-and-resurrected-capt-ajit-vadakayil/)  \n\n\n(its a long series on Dharma. try reading as many parts as you can and write in comment below how many parts you read out of 138)\n\n  \nSo what can Hindu Indians like us to make sure the followers of popat mohamed (PUBG) don\'t burn down our house at midnight and r@pe our women ? Rely on Indian police ? lol.  \n\n\nONE : Its the moral right of every creature to live freely. Hindus eat only plants because we need food to survive and because plants have lower frequency of conciousness compared to animals (humans have highest).   \n\n\nThis means that right to live of all Humans is paramount. Including you.   \n\n\n**Your survival is the topmost priority**. Not the headlines of NYT or following copy paste Indian constitution.  \n\n\nIts well within Dharma (righteousness) to adopt legal as well as illegal means to ensure your family\'s survival.  \n\n\nkilling someone who wants to fatally hurt you or your family is called \'Vadh\' in Sanskrit (its your dharma to protect your family).  \n\n\nTWO :  Its the moral duty of Hindus to finish the war which was thrust upon us for a thousand years. Take back every temple which is occupied (or destroyed). Correct the wrongs. Take back control of our nation (from foreign media, children of invaders, flawed Indian constitution).  \n\n\nThere is a reason why Nostradamus predicted Hindu Rashtra after WW3. There is a reason why Veer Savarkar was the most feared Patriot by the british. They knew it.  \n\n\nMecca was a 12000 year old Hindu temple taken over by mohamed by deceit. Mandir wahan bhi banana hai.  \n\n\n[https://ramanisblog.in/2016/05/06/vedic-practices-in-kaaba-islam/](https://ramanisblog.in/2016/05/06/vedic-practices-in-kaaba-islam/)  \n\n\nRigveda said not to leave these 4 things unfinished : disease, enemy, fire and debt. There was a reason why Pandavas killed every single enemy. It is written in Mahabharata that 138Cr Warriors died during that tragic war.  \n\n\nThere simply is no other way.  \n\n\n  \nNote : this post doesnt advocate violence but self defense.
