<li>Title: 'A request to people here....'<br />Body: "Negative articles about india are posted regularly on worldnews subreddit. But rarely positive articles. And in the comment section of these articles many negative comments about india are posted by chinese and pakistani people using english sounding profile names. For example: One commenter (presumably pakistani) exaggerated that gang rapes happen daily in india and minorities are lynched daily in india. He even said punjab not just kashmir, should be 'liberated' from india.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWorldnews subreddit is a big subreddit visited by more than 25 million people all over the world. And these pakistani and chinese commenters are destroying indias' image in that subreddit. There are indian commenters on that sub reddit too, but they mostly downvote stuff rather than comment.\n\nAnd the indian commenters are called as bots,BJP IT cell etc. This is shutting up indian commenters over there.\n\nSo i request people here to visit that subreddit and give fitting replies to anti-india comments in the comment sections of anti- india articles. When/if they call you bots call them pakistani bots, if they call you BJP IT cell....call them pakistani IT cell. If they say punjab and kashmir should be liberated reply that balochistan, sindh, pakistani punjab and PoK should be liberated. If they say gangrapes happen in india daily, say gangrapes happen in pakistan hourly. If they talk about minorities in india...talk about minorities in pakistan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am banned from that subreddit so i am not able to reply or post articles.

Hindu religion does not receive any benefits from state/center.\n4. The truthfulness of the above statements dont need to be prove.  We just need to keep repeating them till it becomes such a huge thing that everyone knows about this.\n5. Short term self goal:  Stop donating to temples.  Force the government to step in to provide for upkeep and maintenance of temples, not as 'advance' or 'loan' but for free.\n6. Post images of garbage and filth outside temples, say that the government is happy to tax temples but is unwilling to keep the outside of those same temples clean.\n7. Post photographs of beggars outside temples.  Point out that the amount of tax the government takes from temples could be used to rehabilitate these beggar, instead the government is building churches and mosques and paying salaries for those priests.\n8. Double taxation of Hindus.  Hindus pay tax on income, and after that they donate money to temples.  When the government taxes temples, that is effectively double taxation.\n9. Slowly move from taxation to looting.  Equate the current indian government with the mughal and british invaders who robbed indian temples.\n10. Every incident of attack on temple/hindu temple should be highlighted as government is happy to take away the money from the temples but is unwilling to provide the protection for the same.\n11. Till the time that the government does not stop taxing temples, start pressuring them to spend more for maintenance, upkeep and security of \\*all\\* hindu temples.\n12. Start talking about restitution, that is returning of all the money taken from temples till now as tax, with interest.  Talk about liability for repayment extending to all MLAs/MPs (past, present and future), and their family.  Cash, gold and land.\n13. Term the government officials administering the temples, and the ones involved in collecting/receiving tax from the temples are enemies of hindus and enemies of gods (danava).  Ask all hindus to pray for death and disease of these officials.\n14. Get every hindu sadhu or sant, and every hindu organisation to take a public stand against temple taxation.  And get them to inform their followers about how hindus are being robbed.

His NY warehouse had more than $100 million worth of stolen Indian art! The pair of Nataraja and Sivakami (900 yrs) fetched him $ 8.5 million, the idols belonged to the Chola Era'<br />Body: "**Background:**\n\nThe Udayarpalayam taluk of the Ariyalur District, in Tamil Nadu, India has nearly 463 ancient temples, of which 200 belong to the Chola period dated 9th to 10th century AD. Most of these temples haven't seen maintenance for many decades and have lax security. Local thieves used to target the idols for their metal content, usually melting them. Some idols are pure gold, silver and panchaloha ‚Äî five precious metals. However, the entry of international smuggling cartels has changed the situation. With antique Chola art being worth millions in the international market, idol thieves were recruited to lift them from the temples. In 2008, one such gang allegedly recruited by New York-based art dealer Subhash Kapoor was responsible for stealing eight idols from the Brihadeeswarar temple at Sripuranthan, 18 idols from the Varadharaja Perumal temple, and in 2010, 6 panchaloha idols from Chozeeshwarar temple at Vikiramangalam.\n\nAnd when the US authorities subsequently raided Kapoor's warehouses in New York more skeletons came tumbling out of his closet. They recovered no less than $100 million worth of stolen Indian art! This was just Kapoor's inventory - he had been in business for close to four decades and the true scale of his loot is incalculable. The US declared Kapoor one of the most prolific commodities smugglers in the world.\n\n[ Idol Chase](https://preview.redd.it/saallmlkq9j61.png?width=785&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c54fa54eafb5f519d21291304f61da8f01751638)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ State of one our Temples in Tamil Nadu, 800-year-old Sundareswara Temple in Suthamalli](https://preview.redd.it/cuqpjbdsq9j61.png?width=650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfac9fe0947aceef298861ee01c110cc4f646169)\n\n \n\n**Idols Returned from Museums across the World**\n\n* **Australia**\n\nThe Sripuranthan Natarajan Idol, is a 900-year-old statue of Natarajan ‚Äî the dancing Shiva ‚Äî that was stolen from the ancient Brihadeeswarar temple of Sripuranthan, smuggled to the United States, and then sold to the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra with a false provenance, for US$5.1 million. In March 2014, Ron Radford, the director of the National Gallery of Australia, removed the idol from display. In September 2014, the Australian government returned the Natarajan idol to India, along with another stolen antique idol of Shiva as Ardhanarishvarar which was displayed at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. The two were handed over by the then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 5 September 2014, at New Delhi\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ This 900-year-old bronze statue of Dancing Shiva, shown on display at the National Gallery of Australia, was stolen from a temple in Tamil Nadu , $5 million.](https://preview.redd.it/o4yc6yrxq9j61.jpg?width=650&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cda8f53700f2c2553bf142a87044db7ea8e1f86f)\n\n \n\n[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Stolen-Nataraja-Ardhanariswara-idols-return-to-the-land-of-temples/articleshow/42282580.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Stolen-Nataraja-Ardhanariswara-idols-return-to-the-land-of-temples/articleshow/42282580.cms)\n\n* **Germany**\n\nThe Linden Museum in Germany returned to the Indian government a 9th-century AD idol of Mahishasumardini, stolen from Pulwama district in Jammu and Kashmir in the 1990s, which had been acquired from Kapoor.\n\n* **USA**\n\nThe Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio returned four artifacts acquired from Kapoor, including the Vinayagar statue stolen from Sripuranthan. The other antiques are a stone idol of Varaha Rescuing the Earth (acquired 2001), Mughal origin 18th-century enamel with gold box (acquired 2008), and a watercolour Rasikapriya from the Samdehi Ragini (acquired 2010).\n\nIn November 2015, the United States returned a chola period bronze of Shivan and Parvathi, which was sold to the David Owsley Museum of Art at the Ball State University in 2005 by Subhash Kapoor. Here also, the sculpture was sold with a false provenance which placed it back to an American collection of Leo Figie, dated to 1969. The idol was recovered by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement‚Äôs (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).\n\nIn June 2016, the United States returned **nearly 200 antiques to the Indian Government, in the presence of the visiting Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi at Washington DC.** Among the antiques returned were the Chola period (850 AD to 1250 AD) bronze of the Tamil Shaivite poet Manikkavacakar stolen from the Sivan Temple in Madras and the 1000 year old Sripuranthan Vinayagar which was displayed at the Toledo Museum of Art.\n\n* **Singapore**\n\nIn March 2016, the Natarajan idol was re-united with its consort Uma Parmeshwari, at the ASI Icon Centre, Kumbakonam, after nearly 8 years. The Singapore Civilisation Museum had finally returned the Uma Parmeshwari after long negotiations with the Indian Government.\n\nOverall four of the eight statues stolen from Sripuranthan were traced, with three to the United States and one to Singapore.\n\n**Work on getting the Gods Stolen was not Easy**\n\nHowever, the **National Gallery of Australia, continued to deny that the artwork was stolen, refused to return it, and continued to display it in the gallery, without any note of its doubtful provenance.** This stand was criticised by the Australian media, with Duncan Chappell, criminology expert from University of Sydney, calling it in-appropriate and an international embarrassment. **The Government of India formally requested the artwork to be returned, under the UNESCO** **convention on stolen antiquities**\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n**How did he Succeed for so long without getting caught**\n\n**Subhash Chandra Kapoor** main man who made him from selling terracotta to idols where big money is Sanjeevi Asokan an art dealer based out of Chennai.\n\nThe plan involved identifying villages in and around TN, look for temples which remained closed or neglected for years. The Cholas love for bronze idols were immense even small temples in remote villages has great idols.\n\nSubash Kapoor used 3 main books where he sourced which temples to rob and which temples had what idols, the books were,\n\n* The Chola Temples, S.R Balasubrahmanyam\n* Early Chola Bronzes, Douglas Barrett\n* Bronzes of South India - P.R Srinivasan\n\n**Problem :**\n\n1. Neglect some temples have been closed for years, rituals happen once a few years\n2. No Photographic evidence of what idols are in what temples\n3. No of idols in each temples is not documented\n4. ASI was sleeping along\n5. Diplomats and moles who sold their soles to sell our gods\n6. Worst was the robbery was not detected even after years after it was robbed and the Statues had already been sold museums and were displayed in the Galleries\n\n**Who is Vijay Kumar**\n\nAuthor Vijay Kumar was one of the prominent person who studied and exposed the idol trade business of Subash Kapoor. He has exposed the relationship between Subhash Kapoor and Sanjeevi Ashokan which goes beyond thee bronzes, the loopholes and contacts in the entire system helps them route the idols from Indian shores across the word without being caught. But despite many corrupt officials the Indian bureaucracy also has some good honest officers on its payroll.\xa0 Being art enthusiast used his study and source along with the enthusiastic group (An officer from US Immigration and customs who encountered an abandoned shipment earlier) did a magnificent job of identifying the stolen Bronzes, across museums in the world, and establishing the proof which eased the efforts of the Police. The author and his team studied various pictures from Museums and collated the data with historical information about the location of the idols and iconography in various Temples to prove the thefts.\n\nHis two pertinent questions for us:\n\n* To the top Museums of the world, what‚Äôs the point of curating and documenting systematically when the Murtis are basically stolen from Ancient Temples of India that has survived invasions over 800 plus years? Quite shameless.\n* Specifically to all my fellow Indians, what exactly are you proud of as a Hindu/Indian? If not for our Temple structures, exquisite sculptures, what then? A reader can get a clear picture on the global network and their greed towards our precious and how apathy from our side to even have a photograph makes it difficult to establish evidence. Even though it is a Pan-India problem, I assume it is more in Tamil Nadu.\n\nInspiration\n\nThe Idol Thief - Book by S.

Every Islam country has a strict fascist  regime. The freedom people (especially women) hold in countries like Iran is just complete fucking 0.\n* The middle east has been in a constant war be it a civil war, or a war with Jihadi Terrorists or with Nations such as Russia and the US\n* Imagine if a country like India had a \\~30% muslim population and shares a border with Iran, we would have attracted more Islamic Terrorists to provoke violence here.\n\nJust wanted to share something with you guys. I am really happy for the fact that our country isn't in the hands of M\\* like other Asian countries.

<li>Title: 'LEARN SAMSKRTAM'<br />Body: 'NamaskAra, I posted this earlier, but with the recent bans over using certain terminology, I have to post this again.  Also mods, since you will be scrutinizing this post, is there any way to add this to a resources tab where people can refer to this?\n\nAs long as we eat the invaders\' food, speak their language, and wear their clothes, we are still their slaves like our Hindont ancestors were because they would rather fight amongst themselves over jati and language (ironically b\\*stardizing their language in the process).\n\nI always hear AryAs (Hindus) say we should revive the DevabhAshA, but very few actually take the time to learn it. I am currently learning this beautiful language and suggest all fellow believers to do the same. Start with [learnsanskrit.org](https://learnsanskrit.org) and [https://www.sanskrit-trikashaivism.com/](https://www.sanskrit-trikashaivism.com/) for grammar, wikipedia (for nouns and pronouns) and other sources and spend at least 30 minutes a day consistently learning. I also hear Samskrita BhAratI is very helpful.  Encourage family and friends to do the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the meanwhile for all the Hindi speakers, or even speakers of other languages, stop using videshi/whoredu words and speak Shuddha Hindi or Shuddha other regional languages. Again, encourage people you know to purge their languages of filth. You can usually distinguish some of the whoredu words if they have "fa", "qa", "za" sounds in them  (‡•ò, ‡•ö, ‡•õ, ‡•û, ‡•ô) because Samskrtam DOES NOT have these sounds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelow are a few of the commonly used whoredu words I\'ve heard people use (even on this sub) and their Shuddha Hindi / Sanskrit counterparts (I might not get them exactly right).  Try to go through/memorize 10-20 word substitutions every day and be conscious of your language every time you speak.

<li>Title: 'Fair doubt on NDA govt'<br />Body: "Ok so first of all I was listening about privatization of govt sectors but hadn't took them seriously thought modiji will do best they can do for youths. But today I thought that I should know about it because it can affect my future.\n\nSo then I got to know that privatization of railways and banks and all. After that It became serious for me. Then I watched a video about this stuff. There I got to know that UP govt is implementing samvida inspired by Gujrat govt. So that horrified me coz in that it became corrupt and all to get a permanent job and after of years of preparation you'll still have to work 5 more years licking asses of your senior to get permanent there.\n\nOK so I think this should not be done and pls don't suggest that I'll make economy better, imo personal satisfaction of people living in a country matters the most. Also if someone knowing this matter genuinely please tell me will it affect future of govt jobs and if yes then what wil happen to those preparing for competitive exams for years now will have to suffer a totally different process.\n\nI request to please present factual points on this and don't lean on bjp just because we like it."<br />Author: 'literalYAMRAJ'<br />id: 'lpvqyr'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: "Serious question for you'll how can you make a farmer earn more money from his small 1 acre land?. Today a farmer can earn up to 80000 rupees( with MSP procurement) per 6 months from his harvest. This is based on the farmer growing and harvesting wheat. What can the farmer do or even a pvt company?"<br />Body: 'I can think of 2 things \n\nFirst out of the 1 acre of land take up  small patch of land with the aid of a pvt company and its investments to grow lettuce, spinach, corriander, methi, Bhaji etc. (Hydroponic plants)\n\nSecond either a company comes in and starts collectibg the organic waste left behind after the harvest and pay farmers for that or they can get into a revenue share program. Why because the organic waste can be used to produce Bio gas and compost soil ( which could then be sold to consumers and revenue generated from it can go to farmers) \n\nThese are 2 things I could think of post new farm law implementation. If you guys have any idea please recommend.'<br />Author: 'Legionoo7'<br />id: 'lpufs2'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li></ol>
