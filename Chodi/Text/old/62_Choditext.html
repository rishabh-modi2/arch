<li>Title: "[Rant] People who complain about 'Love Jihad' and Indian men being emasculated in the media really need to learn some game."<br />Body: "By game here I mean the way you talk to girls and maintain your social status. There's a reason why we arent as popular among the librandu janta, its because the typical 'bhrata' image is of someone who has a resting angry face with a teeka. The love jihad situation is because we as brothers and fathers don't teach the young populace how to talk to women and win them over. Which is by 1. Looking good (Fitness/Grooming), 2. Being socially active and suave (done through talking to max people and learning from whoever it works for). This is the easiest thing in the world for those with the right mentors, and the hardest for vice versa. Game is what usually seperates the men who easily influence women/men who don't. Thing is in the popular media mux men are shown as attractive whereas we really need to fight the stereotypes of being fatter than average etc. The case abroad is even sad for us where white guys literally take the best piece of the pie while Indian men are emasculated in the media to no extent. Dating sucks for us and it's about time we bring a change. There are tons of amazing YouTube channels out there on how to learn the skill, how to go to a club and (NON CREEPINGLY) talk to a woman. Indian men are really creepy while talking to girls (staring and trying to escalate too soon are rampant in the guys, plus us giving 0 shits about our grooming doesnt help either) so learn from the best of the best and make a change. An important thing here is not to be someone who is a crab in the bucket for other Indians, if someone is getting a girl (out of their league or whatever, plus if you approach and talk to girls long enough you'll realize leagues for us is way different than them) just support them, hi5 them, fist bump them. Be supportive and they'll be equally so. I learnt game from a black guy while traveling in Russia, so to learn this skill the best way is to travel and meet good guys (usually from other countries). They have the best and the most practical advise. Latinos are the BEST for this.\n\n\n\nWe need to teach our kids and ourselves how to look good, groom well and talk to girls. What the librandu and mux crowd has a upper hand in is being attractive. If in general we can work on ourselves then most of our problems might get sorted. Learn from Punjabis, they dont even have to worry about any of that shit because, and thats the truth of society, EVERYONE LISTENS TO ATTRACTIVE GUYS. Let's encourage our bhratas to go to the gym, take up sports and go to debate classes.\n\n\n\nAlso regarding LJ and the cases that happen: It's because when you're busy studying they're busy trying to learn how to be smooth with the ladies. The muxes take care of their looks, usually talk nicely (Urdu's romantic reputation usually helps) and the worst thing is they don't make it a taboo out of learning how to talk to girls. It's literally a need in their community, so we need to have it the same way. Lately due to cases of cheating and infidelity becoming so common (especially in corporates and even small houses) we really need to train the coming generation how to deal with it and how to be someone who is man enough to get some.\n\n\n\nI have also started a discord server for Indian guys to learn dating. If you guys wanna join you're most welcome. Feel free to DM for the same. It's for everyone's good."<br />Author: 'justice4ssr'<br />id: 'j9jkdt'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li>

<li>Title: 'The curse of being a Pro-Hindu...'<br />Body: 'There is no Right Wing, or Centre Wing or any other wing in India for being Pro-Hindu. There\'s Hindu Rashtrawad; either you subscribe to it or you don\'t.\n\nThe problem with several Pro-Hindu ( and I count all the subsidiaries of Sanatan Dharma - Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism) is not that we do were less in number or that we cant fight for our liberation; it\'s the very basic fight that though we are all on the same side, we are so divided by our ideologies, that unlike Left Wing, we have no common goal to achieve.\n\nHere\'s a fun activity to try this around.\n\n1. Gather a few pro- Hind Rashtrawad in a room and introduce a topic on how Left wing and Liberals have destroyed our culture and kept our younger generations from learning about their own history.\n2. Watch the topic spiral out of "Left Wings rule over mind of Indians" to how each pro -Hindu Rashtrawad person has his own version to implement and what they think is correct according to their ideologies.\n\nThe left wings doesn\'t suffer from such division. For one, they are too delusional and mentally incapable to ever have a though of their own as their common cry is a cry of propaganda which can be easily debunked with very mild and small facts. In a even of facts, a debate with Left Winger turns to a blame game where Left Wingers only objective is to conclude you as fascist and communal.\n\nLeft Wing only one agenda - "to destroy the indigenous" culture of Indian Subcontinent, which had stood the test of time since ages and has found a way to stand up no matter how many invaders tried to subdue us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a event like this where you enemy has a common goal, its time for Pro-Hind Rashtrawad groups to come to a conclusion, just for the sake of achieving their target of uniting as a single group and take control. Because while we are busy fighting ourselves, the enemy has very cleverly started using our this weakness against us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: I am planning to post well researched and informative post in this sub once per week. I see all the pro-Hindu people here with good intentions, but mostly our efforts are limited to rant and abusing R-andia.'<br />Author: 'General1_Kobi'<br />id: 'j93e3x'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: 'Time to take control in out own hands.'<br />Body: "This might be a long post.\n\nI see a lot of pro-Hindu and pro-Indian subs on reddit. Yes I term -pro-Indian as well because only the Hindus are bound to their mother land and treat it that way. For everyone else, it has always been a land of people who are culturally so vast and different than them that the only way they could think of controlling us was to destroy us completely.\n\nSeveral subtle crusades, and mass invasions later, Bharat (Hindu and Bharat are one and the same) is the only culture in the world which had withstood the test of time and the onslaught of several enemies whose sole purpose in life was to destroy our great culture.\n\nBut the times have changed now, and so has the enemy changed their ways of working; crusades and invasions have taken a new shape of secret funding and guerilla warfare, where the enemies have adopted a way of targeting the Bharat and it's people in secret and through the things we hold so dear to us - law and order. Bharatiya people have always been a staunch follower of law and order; let it be the law of the land, the king or the religion. But what happens if the laws are rigged against you? According to 2011 Census, [Hindus are minority in eight states](https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-give-hindus-minority-status-in-eight-states-bjp-leader-petitions-apex-court-2777162) i.e. Lakshadweep (2.5%), Mizoram (2.75%), Nagaland (8.75%), Meghalaya (11.53%), J&amp;K (28.44%), Arunachal Pradesh (29%), Manipur (31.39%) and Punjab (38.40%).\n\nThe problem is not with the outside world which is affecting us. We had suffered the onslaught for a more than 500 years and still managed to keep our culture intact. The enemy is fighting us from within. Infiltrating our system and driving us out of the positions we so casually took for granted.\n\nThere have been several reports how the enemy has tried to infiltrate the controlling power positions in India, and in return what did we get- a mere pale response from the Hindus who yet stood divided on the topic.\n\nWhile the Hindus are busy fighting themselves (by getting divided in several Wings), the enemy has taken it their freedom to trample on us. A fact which is clearly visible by the fact that there are several small subs instead of a large one.\n\nAnd still what is the most we do - rant, accuse, deny the facts and go back to sleep.\n\nIt is time when we use this collective groups to plan and take back what belongs to us rightfully. It is high time we create a atmosphere where we can place our people in high decision making powers. We need to uplift our people so that they can fight for themselves."<br />Author: 'General1_Kobi'<br />id: 'j80p94'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li>

<li>Title: "Mumbai Police isn't fooling anyone. The math doesn't add up."<br />Body: "Mumbai police, the lapdog of maulana uddhavailuddin tharkiye pulling this kind of stupid shit and believing people will really fall for it. Lets try to do the math here for a bit:\n\n\\---&gt;So mumbai police says republic tv increased their trp by first bribing the company that moniters the trp (by installing a trp monitoring device in some household tv connections) and then bribing some of the households (with that device installed) into keeping republic tv channel always open on their televisions to increase the trp.\n\n\\---&gt;Population of mumbai is around 2 crore. Its safe to assume around 30% people must have tvs, which is 60lakh connections.\n\n\\---&gt; Now to accurately measure the trp atleast 10% of these connections must be installed with those trp measuring devices (because I dont see how anything less than 10% could give the correct trp figures). That means around 6 lakh of those tv connections must have those trp devices. Heck, lets undervalue it to 2 lakh devices just to be sure we aren't overestimating. \n\n\\---&gt; Now for republic to actually sway the ratings of their channel they must atleast control 20% of those 2 lakh devices(which again is gross underestimation). So that means republic has to bribe 40,000 households INR500 per month. which amounts to **INR 2 crore per month.**\n\n\\---&gt; Now of course even mumbai police is not that stupid to believe that the trp of mumbai ( just 1 city out of 4000 cities in india) alone will sway the trp of whole india so they said republic is doing it in other places too.\n\n\\---&gt; Now there are a total of 4000 cities in india. Lets say republic is doing the same in 25% of the other cities too which is 1000 cities. That means money spent by republic to bribe all over india is 2croreX1000 = **2000 crore per month.**\n\n\\---&gt; **And this figure is after undervaluing figures in many places, only taking 1000 out of 4000 cities and not counting the 6.5 lakh villages in india at all.** \n\n  So republic tv makes so much money that they can pay 2000 crore per month just as bribes.

<li>Title: "Threats, Hate speeches and Systematic Suppression of RW folks on Twitter - True Indology's Testimony!"<br />Body: 'I am just copy-pasting the whole statement written by True Indology on his Facebook Page about recent and old events. \n\n# Twitter scam: the price of speaking truth.\n\n&gt;Yes, it has happened to me. Something very extraordinary and shocking. Read on.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I have been active on twitter since July 2019 and my ID is u/tiinexile (with two \'i\'s). This is my only account on twitter. ([https://twitter.com/TIinExile](https://twitter.com/TIinExile)). Every other account is fake.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Two weeks ago, I got a death threat from an Islamist handle who has been impersonating me as "True Indology" from a very long time.  The purpose of that handle is two fold. While the handle impersonates as "True Indology" mostly to gain followers in my name , it shows its real face in a few tweets condemning me to death because I dared speak unflatteringly about Mughals.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The impersonator  handle wrote "People like you don\'t deserve life.  You have not seen my hospitality yet. You deserve a brutal death in public which will horrify all anti class enemies" (notice the communist-Islamist class conflict language in the threat).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This handle has been impersonating me for more than a year now. I had sent several reports to twitter and so had my followers. But all in vain. Nothing has ever happened. I had long lost any faith in twitter. So, I rather filed a cyber complaint.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;This incident happened two weeks ago. It really cast apprehensions in my mind about my own security. After all, we all know what happened to Kamlesh Tiwari. All said and done, we are fighting our own battle and are ultimately responsible to our own selves. I also had a lot of things going on at my professional front. I did not want any mental disturbance. So I thought it wise to deactivate the handle for a while and concentrate on my professional life.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Two days ago, I reactivated my handle as I had been told that it would permanently be lost in the event of not reactivating within 30 days. To my surprise, my handle had not shown  the correct count of my followers and following list on reactivation. Granted, there is a Twitter policy that it takes time for the correct follower and following count to show up on reactivated accounts. But twitter makes it clear on its policies forum that it should not take more than 48 hours.  At the time of writing this post, it has well been more than 60 hours since I reactivated my handle.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But there is more. Twitter does not allow anyone to follow me. If any account follows me, it will automatically be unfollowed on a simple page refresh. How? Why should anybody following me find himself unfollowed on page refresh? This has NEVER happened. No, this is not any twitter policy. This is not even a twitter bug or issue. I do not find any such issue on twitter complaint forums.  This is simply inexplicable behavior by twitter. And it happens in broad daylight. TWITTER DOES NOT ALLOW ANYONE TO FOLLOW ME.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There is more still. My follower count has been fluctuating. It shows 10k at one instance. It shows 10 at the very next. If anybody types my ID (@tiinexile-with two ‘i’s), it simply does not show itself on Twitter.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yet, twitter did something extremely shocking and inexplicable. It has allowed the fake accounts and impersonators to run freely on my ID. Let me give you an example. Let us say your ID on twitter is u/hari. Imagine finding someone else on twitter using u/hari? You would think whether it is even possible? Even deactivated and suspended accounts do not have their ID available for others to usurp. But twitter has freely distributed my handle to impersonators. It has promoted ID theft. This does NOT HAPPEN at all. This is again not just a twitter bug.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;As it stands now, while my follower count keeps fluctuating even after 48 hours, the person who sent me the death threat is active on twitter and he assumes my identity. Twitter has given away my original ID u/trueindology to him.? How and why? This is downright fraudulent behavior by twitter. It has enabled identity theft. The account cunningly calls himself “back up” to seem original and gain followers in my name while sending death threats to me. People who mistakenly fall for the impersonator handle that had sent me death threats continue to follow his account. This includes prominent people like Mohandas Pai, Smita Deshmukh, Prafulla Ketkar, R Vaidyanathan and Gaurav Sawant. Just imagine the extent of this twitter scam!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As I helplessly write this post now, twitter still tells me ‘‘You do not have any followers”. It still does not show my ID among the people. If anybody types “True Indology” in the people section of twitter, Twitter does not show my real account. It only shows the fake impersonator who has sent me the death threat. He has gained 3800 followers in a day and his account has more than 4000 followers as it stands now while twitter does not allow ANYONE to follow my account. This is a true story and these events have simply left me appalled. This is the price I pray for speaking truth.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Remember. This is NOT about me. This has happened to me because I dared speak up the truth. This could very well happen to you tomorrow. Just imagine yourself in my shoes. Does not the prospect of enabling identity theft by huge MNCs sound scary? Suspension is one thing. But a scam on this level is unprecedented and has not happened  so publicly and blatantly as far as I know.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Here are some details.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My real and only active account on twitter: u/tiinexile (ti in exile : with two is) [https://twitter.com/TIinExile](https://twitter.com/TIinExile)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The fake impersonator who sent me death threats:  u/TruelndoIogy  \n&gt;  \n&gt;([https://twitter.com/TruelndoIogy](https://twitter.com/TruelndoIogy))  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Screenshots and video proofs:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://twitter.com/ProjMattersIN/status/1313618788361752576](https://twitter.com/ProjMattersIN/status/1313618788361752576)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://twitter.com/VideshiKes.../status/1313613599366025216](https://twitter.com/VideshiKes.../status/1313613599366025216)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://twitter.com/VideshiKes.../status/1313613735735422977](https://twitter.com/VideshiKes.../status/1313613735735422977)\n\nSource : [https://www.facebook.com/trueindology.org/posts/1506993732834474](https://www.facebook.com/trueindology.org/posts/1506993732834474)'<br />Author: 'DrunkEpsilon'<br />id: 'j6p0g0'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li>

<li>Title: 'पप्पू के पापा की मौत'<br />Body: '\nसाल 2013 ... मैं पहली बार श्रीलंका की राजधानी कोलंबो गया था ... नई दिल्ली से डायरेक्ट फ्लाइट थी श्रीलंकन एयरलाइंस की ... डायरेक्ट फ्लाइट साडे 3 घंटे की ... मैं रात को 10:00 बजे कोलंबो पहुंचा ... इमीग्रेशन - कस्टम क्लियर कर के मैं 11:00 बजे एयरपोर्ट से बाहर निकला ... होटल की टैक्सी मुझे लेने के लिए खड़ी थी ... एयरपोर्ट से होटल की दूरी लगभग 35 किलोमीटर थी ... उन दिनों एक्सप्रेसवे नहीं बना था ... शहर के ट्रैफिक से निकलते- निकलते मैं लगभग 12:30 बजे होटल पहुंचा ... सोते-सोते रात में 1:00 बज गई ... सुबह 8:00 बजे नींद टूटी ...\n\nतैयार होकर मैनें डिस्ट्रीब्यूटर को फोन किया ... उसने कहा आज पोया डे है ... पब्लिक हॉलिडे हैं आप चाहो तो रिलैक्स कर सकते हो ... काम कुछ नहीं होगा ... खैर होटल में नाश्ता कर ... मैं गंगा रामा टेंपल पहुंच गया ... गंगा रामा टेंपल और सीमा मलाका टेंपल आस पास में ही है ... दो-तीन घंटे समय गुजार कर ... मैं अपने होटल वापस पहुंचा ...\n\n लंच का समय हो गया था ... मैंने सोचा आस-पास के कोई फूड जंक्शन को ट्राई किया जाए ...\nहोटल से निकलकर मैं इधर-उधर घूम रहा था ... अचानक मुझे एक फूड जंक्शन का बोर्ड दिखाई पड़ा ... छोटा सा रेस्टोरेंट था ... साफ सुथरा ... अंदर पहुंचा तो देखा एक वृद्ध सज्जन ... जो सफेद हाफ शर्ट में अपने काउंटर पर बैठे हुए हैं ... माथे पर बहुत ही खूबसूरत तिलक लगा था ... उनके पीछे दीवार पर ... श्रीगणपति - श्री लक्ष्मी - श्री दुर्गा - श्री शिव - श्री तिरुपति और श्री सरस्वती की बेहद आकर्षक कांच के फ्रेम में फोटो लगे हुए थे ... जिनमें रंग बिरंगी बत्तियां जल बुझ रही थी ... बेहद सुगंधित अगरबत्ती का खुशबू चारों ओर फैला हुआ था ...\nजैसा कि मेरी आदत है ... \n\nमैनें दोनों हाथ जोड़कर मैंने भी उन्हें नमस्कार किया ... उनके चेहरे पर मुस्कान आ गई ... फिर मैंने उनसे अंग्रेजी में पूछा पूछा क्या मुझे शाकाहारी खाना मिल सकता है ... उन्होंने टूटी-फूटी हिंदी में कहा ... अन्ना जरूर मिलेगा ... आप बैठो ... कहकर वह अपने काउंटर से बाहर निकले ... मुझे एक टेबल पर बिठाया ... वे अंदर किचन में पहुंचे ... उनके साथ एक वेटर स्टील की थाली लाकर मेरे सामने रखा जिसमें केले का पत्ता रखा हुआ था .. उसने चावल ... सांभर ... रसम ...दो तरह की चटनी पापड और एक कटोरी में थोड़ी दाल लाकर दिया ... उन्होंने कहा ....यह प्योर वेजीटेरियन खाना है आप अच्छे से खाओ ... खाना खाने के बाद मैंने पैसे देने के लिए उनके काउंटर पर पहुंचा ... उन्होंने मुझसे टूटी-फूटी हिंदी में पूछा .\n\n.. क्या मैं दिल्ली से हूं ... मेरे हां सुनते ही वह मुस्कुराए ... और बोले वह एक बार दिल्ली गया था ... लेकिन पराठे खा खा कर परेशान हो गया ... और बहुत गर्मी थी ... मैंने उनसे पूछा आप श्रीलंका से ही है ... उनका कहना था जी ... हमें पता ही नहीं कि हमारे पूर्वज कब इंडिया से इधर आया ... लेकिन कम से कम 1000 साल तो हो ही गया है ... फिर उन्होंने पूछा मुझे उनका खाना कैसा लगा ... मैंने कहा खाना बहुत अच्छा था ....\nऔर मैं रात में फिर आऊंगा खाने के लिए ...\nशाम को लगभग 7:00 बजे फिर मैं पहुंचा ... मुझे देखते ही उन्होंने हाथ जोड़कर नमस्कार किया ... मैंने उनसे इडली देने को कहा ... वेटर ने इडली दाल सांभर वाइट चटनी और यलो चटनी सर्व की ... मैंने इडली खाना शुरू किया ... वे मेरी टेबल पर आकर खडे हुए ... मैंने उन्हें भी डिनर के लिए इनवाइट किया ... वह हंसने लगे ... और बोले मैं रात में 10:00 बजे खाता हूं ... घर पर वाइफ के साथ ... मैंने बातचीत शुरू करने के लिए पूछा ... आप तमिल हो ... सिविल वार के समय आपको तकलीफ नहीं हुई ...\n\n वे अचानक चौकं करअपने दाएं बाएं देखा फिर एकदम धीरे आवाज में मुझसे कहा आप इस विषय में कोई बात मत करना आप सीरियस प्रॉब्लम में पड़ जाओगे ... खाना खाकर मैंने उनसे विदा ली...\nदूसरे दिन में अपने डिस्ट्रीब्यूटर के साथ था ... हमने लंच एक इंडियन रेस्टोरेंट ली ... डिनर के लिए मैं वापस वही पहुंचा ... एक दूसरे को नमस्कार किया ... उन्होंने कहा अन्ना आज दोपहर में नहीं आया ... मैंने कहा सर मैं डिस्ट्रीब्यूटर के साथ था ... खाना उधर ही खा लिया ... अभी क्या खाएगा उन्होंने पूछा... मसाला डोसा बनवा दो मैंने कहा ... ठीक है इस तरह से दो-तीन दिन गुजर गया ... एक दिन जब मैं पहुंचा तो उनके रेस्टोरेंट में कोई नहीं था ... तो उनके काउंटर पर खड़े खड़े बातचीत शुरू हुई ... उन्होंने काउंटर से अपना सिर आगे किया ... लगभग मेरे चेहरे के पास लाकर बोला ... अन्ना आप जब तक श्रीलंका में हो ... तब तक आप सिविल वार ... एलटीटीई ... प्रभाकरण ... तमिल ... के बारे में कोई भी बात ... किसी से भी नहीं करोगे ... \n\nकाफी पुलिस और इंटेलिजेंस के लोग होते हैं ... अगर किसी ने भी आपकी बात सुन ली ... और पुलिस को इन्फॉर्म कर दिया ... तो आप बहुत ही सीरियस प्रॉब्लम में फंस जाओगे ... मैंने उनसे पूछा आप ही बता दो क्या हुआ था ... उन्होंने कहा मैं यहां कुछ नहीं बता सकता हूं ...\nएक शाम उनकी धर्मपत्नी भी थी ... कीमती साड़ी और बहुत सारे जेवर पहने हुए ... उन्होंने अपनी धर्मपत्नी को मेरे बारे में कुछ अपने लैंग्वेज में बताया ... उनकी धर्मपत्नी को हिंदी नहीं आती थी .... उन्होंने मुझसे टूटी-फूटी अंग्रेजी में घर आने को कहा ... मैंने भी कह दिया जल्दी आऊंगा ...\nदूसरा दिन शाम को मैं उनका रेस्टोरेंट पहुंचा ... वह मुझे लेकर अपने घर ... उनका घर लगभग 300 मीटर दूर था ...उनकी धर्मपत्नी मुझे देखकर बहुत खुश हुई ... उन्होंने हमें पानी दी ... और थोड़ी देर में बेहद शानदार कॉफी भी ... इधर उधर की बातें हो रही थी ... घर की परिवार की ...\n\nमैंने उनसे पूछा आप तो तमिल हो ... इतने साल से श्रीलंका में हो ... इतनी बड़ी सिविल वार हुई ... आप बहुत कुछ जानते होंगे ... मुझे कुछ नहीं बताएंगे ... उन्होंने कहा अन्ना जो हो गया उसे भूल जाओ ... हमारा सब कुछ खत्म हो चुका है ... सिर्फ हम पति-पत्नी हैं ... हमारी उम्र 75 से ज्यादा है ... हम कितने दिन बचेंगे पता नहीं ... जब तक हाथ-पैर चल रहा है ... मैं रेस्टोरेंट चला रहा हूं ... मरने के बाद वह भी बंद हो जाएगा ....\nउनकी आंखों में आंसू आ गए थे ... उन्होंने आगे कहा ... दो बेटियों के पैदा होने के 11 साल बाद एक बेटा हुआ ... मेरे तीनो बच्चों की हत्या कर दी गई मेरी तो आवाज ही बंद हो गई ... मैं अवाक रह गया ... एक घूंट पानी पीकर उन्होंने कहना शुरू किया ... इंडिपेंडेंस के बाद श्रीलंका से लगभग पांच लाख तमिल भागकर इंडिया चले गए ... \n\nऔर लगभग दश लाख तमिलों की नागरिकता समाप्त हो गई ... हम स्टेट लेस हो गये ... इस देश में हमारा कोई अस्तित्व नहीं रहा ... हजारों तमिल जो सरकारी नौकरी में थे ... उनकी नौकरी समाप्त कर दी गई ...\nसरेआम तमिलों की हत्या होती थी ... महिलाओं के साथ बलात्कार ... तमिलों के घर में आग लगा दिया जाता था ... उनकी दुकान और मकान लूट ली जाती थी ... हमारी कोई रिपोर्ट दर्ज नहीं होती थी ... ना ही हमें कोई सुरक्षा प्रदान किया जाता था ... हम जीवित थे तो सिर्फ अपने अड़ोस पड़ोस के लोगों के बदौलत ... पुलिस हमें प्रोटेक्ट करने नहीं आती थी ... हम अपने ही देश में सेकंड क्लास सिटीजन हो गये थे ... हमारा भविष्य अंधकार में था ...\n\n मेरी दोनो बेटियों की शादी ... ईस्ट श्रीलंका में हुआ था ... और बड़ी बेटी का एक बेटा भी था 3 साल का ... उनके परिवार पूरे परिवार को गोलियों से भून दिया गया ... मेरी बेटा जो स्कूल स्टूडेंट था ... उसकी की हत्या कोलंबो में कर दी गई ... जब स्कूल से लौट रहा था ... उसकी आईडेंटिटी कार्ड देख कर .. उसे point-blank रेंज से गोली मार दी गई ... उसके सर के टुकड़े टुकड़े हो गए ...\nहे भगवान ... मेरे मुंह से आवाज निकलना भी बंद हो गया था ... उन्होंने कहना जारी रखा ... चुन-चुन कर दुकानों में आग लगा दी जाती थी ... और सामने से दरवाजे बंद कर दिए जाते थे ... तमिल दुकानदार अंदर ही जलकर राख हो जाते थे ... बाहर से चीखते चिल्लाते उनकी महिलाओं के साथ सड़कों पर बलात्कार होता था ... साथ में नारा लगा जाता था .... हम तमिलों की हत्या कर देंगे ... और उनकी औरतों से अपने बच्चे पैदा करेंगे ...\n मेरे रोंगटे खड़े हो गए ... हम दोनों के हीं आंखों में आंसू थे\nउनकी पत्नी को हिंदी समझ में नहीं आ रही थी ... लेकिन वह हाव-भाव से समझ पा रही थी ... उन्होंने कहा एक लाख से ज्यादा तमिल सिविलियंस ही हत्या हुई ... 25000 से ज्यादा तमिल महिलाओं की बलात्कार के बाद वीभत्स हत्या कर दिया गया ... खिड़की से उन्होने बाहर की लेन दिखाइ ... चुकी कोलंबो समुद्र के किनारे हैं ... तो बारिश अधिक होती है ... लेन के दोनों और नालियां थी ... उन्होंने नालियों की तरफ इशारा करते हुए कहा ... वह ड्रेनेज सिस्टम देख रहा है ... अभी कवर्ड है ... उस समय कवर्ड नहीं होता था ... और उन ड्रेनेज सिस्टम से सिर्फ खून बहते थे ... \n\nकोलंबो में ऐसे ऐसे जगह थे .... जहां सड़क पार करने के लिए खून के सैलाब को पार करना पड़ता था ... हमें पता नहीं होता था ... कब हमें एक गोली आकर लगेगी ... और हम समाप्त हो जाएंगे ... एक गोली मेरे बेटे को लगी ... वह स्कूल स्टूडेंट था ... मेरे बेटे का सर का परखच्चे उड़ गया था ... मैंने सिर्फ उसका शरीर का अंतिम संस्कार किया ... मेरी दोनों बेटियां अपने पूरे परिवार के साथ समाप्त हो गई थी ... कोई नहीं बचा ... हम दोनों के सिवा ... अन्ना बुरा मत मानना ... आप मेरे बेटे के जैसे हो ... बाहर कभी भी इस सिलसिले में किसी से बात मत करना ... मेरे बहुत से रिश्तेदार थे कोलंबो में ... और आसपास ....अधिकांश मारे गए ..\n\n. पूरी की पूरी एक कम्युनिटी का सर्वनाश हो गया और दुनिया देखती रही ... कुछ लोग इसको बर्दाश्त नहीं कर पाए ... उन्होंने लड़कर मरना पसंद किया ....बहुत सारे छोटे छोटे विद्रोही गुट बन गए ... उन विद्रोहियों का एक संगठन बना ... जिसको एलटीटी के नाम से जाना जाता है ... अगर एलटीटी नहीं होती तो आज एक भी तमिल हिंदू ....श्रीलंका में जिंदा नहीं होता ... प्रभाकरण मर गया ....उसका खानदान समाप्त हो गया ... लेकिन यह उसकी संघर्ष का परिणाम है ... कि कुछ तमिल आज भी श्रीलंका में जिंदा है ...\nभूख समाप्त हो चुकी थी ... \nफिर भी उनके जोर देने से ... मैंने थोड़ा सा खाना खाया ... वापस मुझे मेरे होटल तक छोड़ने आए ... रात भर मैं सो नही पाया ... उसके बाद जब भी श्रीलंका जाता था ... उनके रेस्टोरेंट मैं जरूर जाता था ... 2017 में उनका देहांत हो गया ... तीन महीने के बाद उनकी पत्नी का भी ... उनका रेस्टोरेंट और उसके आसपास के दुकानों को तोड़कर एक सुंदर सा कंपलेक्स बन गया ... आज भी स्थित है कोलंबो बाम्बलापिटिया में ...'<br />Author: 'niharika-neelkamal'<br />id: 'j5g6rq'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li>
<li>Title: 'Should there be a psychiatric analysis of rape convicts ??'<br />Body: "Bhratas and bhrajanis, this is an opinion which I have held for quite some time now. But should there be a psychiatric analyis of rape convicts nationwide, or atleast gather enough samples to make a reasonable report ??\nBecause for the last 8 years, since the 16/12 incident, almost every 8 months, we hear new case. With a different degree of twist. And then I see people barking on social media of giving them the most macabre punishment, but ask yourself, would it fix it ?? Many crimes carry the death penalty, would someone who wants to commit a crime think of its consequences ?? Because imo, I don't think it will get us anywhere, all this cribbing on who can come up with the most macabre of punishment for rapist/s.\nWhat do you think ?? Should there be a psychiatric analysis ?? Anything else you would like to tell me, good, bad or ugly. Anything will be appreciated"<br />Author: 'burmesefalcon'<br />id: 'j5g1u5'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li>

मैं खुद ही आटोरिकशे में बैठ कर चली जाऊंगी?’\n\nमीना को तो अकेले सफर करने का जुनून था. यहां आने से पहले उस ने राहुल से भी यही कहा था, ‘मैं बूआ के यहां गीत गाने जा रही हूं.’ ‘चलो, मैं छोड़ आता हूं.’\n\n‘नहीं, मैं चली जाऊंगी,’ मीना ने अनमने मन से कह कर टाल दिया था. तब राहुल बोला था, ‘जमाना बड़ा खराब है. अकेली औरत का बाहर जाना खतरे से खाली नहीं है.’\n\n‘आप तो बेवजह की चिंता पाल रहे हैं. मैं कोई छोटी बच्ची नहीं हूं, जो कोई रावण मुझे उठा कर ले जाएगा.’ ‘यह तुम नहीं तुम्हारा अहम बोल रहा है,’ समझाते हुए एक बार फिर राहुल बोला था, ‘जब से दिल्ली में चलती बस में निर्भया के साथ…’\n\n‘इस दुनिया में कितनी औरतें ऐसी हैं, जो अकेले ही नौकरी कर रही हैं…’ बीच में ही बात काटते हुए मीना बोली थी, ‘मैं तो बस गीत गा कर वापस आ जाऊंगी.’ यहां से उस की बूआ का घर\n\n3 किलोमीटर दूर है. वह आटोरिकशे में बैठ कर बूआ के यहां पहुंच गई थी. वहां जा कर राहुल को फोन कर दिया था कि वह बूआ के यहां पहुंच गई है. फिर वह बूआ के परिवार में ही खो गई. मगर अब रात को सड़क पर आ कर आटोरिकशे का इंतजार करना उसे महंगा पड़ने लगा था.\n\nजैसेजैसे रात गहराती जा रही थी, सन्नाटा पसरता जा रहा था. इक्कादुक्का आदमी उसे अजीब सी निगाह डाल कर गुजर रहे थे. जितने भी आटोरिकशे वाले गुजरे, वे सब भरे हुए थे. जब कोई औरत किसी स्कूटर के पीछे मर्द के सहारे बैठी दिखती थी, तब मीना भी यादों में खो जाती थी. वह इसी तरह राहुल के स्कूटर पर कई बार पीछे बैठ चुकी थी.\n\nआटोरिकशा तो अभी भी नहीं आया था. रात का सन्नाटा उसे डरा रहा था. क्या राहुल को यहां बुला ले? अगर वह बुला लेगी, तब उस की हार होगी. वह साबित करना चाहती थी कि औरत अकेली भी घूम सकती है, इसलिए उस ने राहुल को फोन\n\nनहीं किया. इतने में एक सवारी टैंपो वहां आया. वह खचाखच भरा हुआ था. टैंपो वाला उसे बैठने का इशारा कर रहा था. मीना ने कहा, ‘‘कहां बैठूंगी भैया?’’\n\nवह मुसकराता हुआ चला गया. तब वह दूसरे टैंपों का इंतजार करने लगी, मगर काफी देर तक टैंपो नहीं आया. तभी एक शख्स उस के पास आ कर बोला, ‘‘चलोगी मेरे साथ?’’\n\n‘‘कहां?’’ मीना ने पूछा. ‘‘उस खंडहर के पास. कितने पैसे लोगी?’’ उस आदमी ने जब यह कहा, तब उसे समझते देर न लगी. वह आदमी उसे धंधे वाली समझ रहा था.\n\nवह भी एक धंधे वाली औरत बन कर बोली, ‘‘कितना पैसा दोगे?’’ वह आदमी कुछ न बोला. सोचने लगा. तब मीना फिर बोली, ‘‘जेब में कितना माल है?’’\n\n‘‘बस, 50 रुपए.’’ ‘‘जेब में पैसा नहीं है और आ गया… सुन, मैं वह औरत नहीं हूं, जो तू समझ रहा है,’’ मीना ने कहा.\n\n‘‘तब यहां क्यों खड़ी है?’’ ‘‘भागता है कि नहीं… नहीं तो चप्पल उतार कर सारा नशा उतार दूंगी तेरा,’’ मीना की इस बात को सुन कर वह आदमी चलता बना.\n\nअब मीना ने ठान लिया था कि वह खाली आटोरिकशे में नहीं बैठेगी, क्योंकि उस ड्राइवर में अकेली औरत को देख कर न जाने कब रावण जिंदा हो जाए? ‘‘कहां चलना है मैडम?’’ एक आटोरिकशा वाला उस के पास आ कर बोला. जब मीना ने देखा कि उस की आंखों में वासना है, तब वह समझ गई कि इस की नीयत साफ नहीं है.\n\nवह बोली, ‘‘कहीं नहीं.’’ ‘‘मैडम, अब कोई टैंपो मिलने वाला नहीं है…’’ वह लार टपकाते हुए बोला, ‘‘आप को कहां चलना है? मैं छोड़ आता हूं.’’\n\n‘‘मुझे कहीं नहीं जाना है,’’ वह उसे झिड़कते हुए बोली. ‘‘जैसी आप की मरजी,’’ इतना कह कर वह आगे बढ़ गया.\n\nमीना ने राहत की सांस ली. शायद आटोरिकशे वाला सही कह रहा था कि अब कोई टैंपो नहीं मिलने वाला है. अगर वह मिलेगा, तो भरा हुआ मिलेगा. मगर अब कितना भी भरा हुआ टैंपो आए, वह उस में लद जाएगी. वह लोगों की निगाह में बाजारू औरत नहीं बनना चाहती थी. मीना को फिल्मों के वे सीन याद आए, जब हीरोइन को अकेले पा कर गुंडे उठा कर ले जाते हैं, मगर न जाने कहां से हीरो आ जाता है और हीरोइन को बचा लेता है. मगर यहां किसी ने उस का अपहरण कर लिया, तब उसे बचाने के लिए कोई हीरो नहीं आएगा.\n\nमीना आएदिन अखबारों में पढ़ती रहती थी कि किसी औरत के साथ यह हुआ, वह हुआ, वह यहां ज्यादा देर खड़ी रहेगी, तब उसे लोग गलत समझेंगे. तभी मीना ने देखा कि 3-4 नौजवान हंसते हुए उस की ओर आ रहे थे. उन्हें देख वह सिहर गई. अब वह क्या करेगी? खतरा अपने ऊपर मंडराता देख कर वह कांप उठी.\n\nवे लोग पास आ कर उस के आसपास खड़े हो गए. उन में से एक बोला, ‘यहां क्यों खड़ी है?’’ दूसरे आदमी ने जवाब दिया, ‘‘उस्ताद, ग्राहक ढूंढ़ रही है.’’\n\nतीसरा शख्स बोला, ‘‘मिला कोई ग्राहक?’’ पहले वाला बोला, ‘‘अरे, कोई ग्राहक नहीं मिला, तो हमारे साथ चल.’’\n\nमीना ने उस अकेले शख्स से तो मजाक कर के भगा दिया था, मगर यहां 3-3 जिंदा रावण उस के सामने खड़े थे. उन्हें कैसे भगाए? वे तीनों ठहाके लगा कर हंस रहे थे, मगर तभी पुलिस की गाड़ी सायरन बजाती हुई आती दिखी.\n\nएक बोला, ‘‘चलो उस्ताद, पुलिस आ रही है.’’ वे तीनों वहां से भाग गए. मगर मीना इन पुलिस वालों से कैसे बचेगी?\n\nपुलिस की जीप उस के पास आ कर खड़ी हो गई. उन में से एक पुलिस वाला उतरा और कड़क आवाज में बोला, ‘‘इतनी रात को सड़क पर क्यों खड़ी है?’’\n\n‘‘टैंपो का इंतजार कर रही हूं,’’ मीना सहमते हुए बोली. ‘‘अब रात को 11 बजे टैंपो नहीं मिलेगा. कहां जाना है?’’\n\n‘‘सर, सांवरिया कालोनी.’’ ‘‘झूठ तो नहीं बोल रही है?’’\n\n‘‘नहीं सर, मैं झूठ नहीं बोलती,’’ मीना ने एक बार फिर सफाई दी. ‘‘मैं अच्छी तरह जानता हूं तुम जैसी धंधा करने वाली औरतों को…’’ पुलिस वाला जरा अकड़ कर बोला, ‘‘अब जब पकड़ी गई हो, तो सती सावित्री बन रही हो. बता, वे तीनों लोग कौन थे?’’\n\n‘‘मुझे नहीं मालूम सर.’’ ‘‘झूठ बोलते शर्म नहीं आती तुझे,’’ पुलिस वाला फिर गरजा.\n\n‘‘मैं सच कह रही हूं सर. वह तीनों कौन थे, मुझे कुछ नहीं मालूम. मुझे अकेली देख कर वे तीनों आए थे. मैं वैसी औरत नहीं हूं, जो आप समझ रहे हैं,’’ मीना ने अपनी सफाई दी. ‘‘चल थाने, वहां सब असलियत का पता चल जाएगा. चल बैठ जीप में… सुना कि नहीं?’’\n\n‘‘सर, मुझे मत ले चलो. मैं घरेलू औरत हूं.’’ ‘‘अरे, तू घरगृहस्थी वाली औरत है, तो रात के 11 बजे यहां क्या कर रही है? ठीक है, बता, तेरा पति कहां है?’’\n\n‘‘सर, वे तो घर में हैं.’’ ‘‘मतलब, वही हुआ न… तू धंधा करने के लिए रात को अकेली निकली है और अपने पति की आंखों में धूल झोंक रही है. तेरा झूठ यहीं पकड़ा गया…\n\n‘‘अच्छा, अब बता कि तू कहां से आ रही है?’’ ‘‘बूआ के यहां गीतसंगीत के प्रोग्राम में आई थी सर. वहीं देर हो गई.’’\n\n‘‘फिर झूठ बोल रही है. बैठ जीप में,’’ पुलिस वाला अब तक उस पर शिकंजा कस चुका था. ‘‘ठीक है सर, अगर आप को यकीन नहीं हो रहा है, तो मैं उन्हें फोन कर के बुलाती हूं, ताकि आप को असलियत का पता चल जाए,’’ कह कर वह पर्स में से मोबाइल फोन निकालने लगी.\n\nतभी पुलिस वाला दहाड़ा, ‘‘इस की कोई जरूरत नहीं है. मुझे मालूम है कि तू अपने पति को बुला कर उस के सामने अपने को सतीसावित्री साबित करना चाहेगी. सीधेसीधे क्यों नहीं कह देती है कि तू धंधा करती है.’’ मीना की आंखों के आगे अंधेरा छाने लगा था कि तभी अचानक राहुल उसे गाड़ी से आता दिखाई दिया. उस ने आवाज लगाई, ‘‘राहुल… राहुल.’’\n\nराहुल पास आ कर बोला, ‘‘अरे मीना, तुम यहां…’’ अचानक उस की नजर जब पुलिस पर पड़ी, तब वह हैरानी से आंखें फाड़ते हुए देखता रहा.\n\nपुलिस वाला उसे देख कर गरजा, ‘‘तुम कौन हो?’’ ‘‘मैं इस का पति हूं.’’\n\n‘‘तुझे झूठ बोलते हुए शर्म नहीं आती,’’ पुलिस वाला अपनी वरदी का रोब दिखाते हुए बोला, ‘‘तुम दोनों मुझे बेवकूफ बना रहे हो. अपनी पत्नी से धंधा कराते हुए तुझे शर्म नहीं आती. चल थाने में जब डंडे पड़ेंगे, तब भूल जाएगा अपनी पत्नी से धंधा कराना.’’ यह सुन कर राहुल हाथ जोड़ता हुआ बोला, ‘‘आप यकीन रखिए सर, यह मेरी पत्नी है, बूआ के यहां गीत गाने अकेली गई थी. लौटने में जब देर हो गई, तब बूआ ने बताया कि यह तो घंटेभर पहले ही निकल चुकी है.\n\n‘‘जब यह घर न पहुंची, तब मैं इसे ढूंढ़ने के लिए निकला. अगर आप को यकीन न हो, तो मैं बूआ को यहीं बुला लेता हूं.’’ ‘‘ठीक है, ठीक है. तुम झूठ तो नहीं बोल रहे हो,’’ पुलिस वाले ने जरा नरम पड़ते हुए कहा.\n\n‘‘अकेली औरत को देर रात को बाहर नहीं भेजना चाहिए,’’ पुलिस वाले को जैसे अब यकीन हो गया था, इसलिए अपने तेवर ठंडे करते हुए वह बोला, ‘‘यह तो मैं समय पर आ गया, वरना वे तीनों गुंडे आप की पत्नी की न जाने क्या हालत करते. फिर आप लोग पुलिस वालों को बदनाम करते.’’ ‘‘गलती हमारी है. आगे से मैं ध्यान रखूंगा,’’ राहुल ने हाथ जोड़ कर माफी मांगते हुए कहा.\n\nपुलिस की गाड़ी वहां से चली गई. मीना नीचे गरदन कर के खड़ी रही.\n\nराहुल बोला, ‘‘देख लिया अकेले आने का नतीजा.’’ ‘‘राहुल, मुझे शर्मिंदा मत करो. रावण तो एक था, मगर इस 2 घंटे के समय में मुझे लगा कि आज भी कई रावण जिंदा हैं.\n\n‘‘अगर आप नहीं आते, तो वह पुलिस वाला मुझे थाने में बैठा देता,’’ कह कर मीना ने मन को हलका कर लिया.\n\n‘‘तो बैठो गाड़ी में…’’ गुस्से से राहुल ने कहा, ‘‘बड़ी लक्ष्मीबाई बनने चली थी.’’ मीना नजरें झुकाए चुपचाप गाड़ी में जा कर बैठ गई.'<br />Author: 'Ola-Uber'<br />id: 'j4c8yl'<br />Flair ::atalji: Hindi Poetry</li>

<li>Title: 'On 2nd Oct I am a follower of Mahatma Gandhi And Sardar Bhagat Singh Ji'<br />Body: 'Followers of these two have always tried to pull down the followers of each other. But I think India needs both the ideologies to function properly.\n\nOne side will simply say we don\'t support the violence.\n\nThe other side says Gandhi is given the whole credit of fighting for our independence. Because of him India got divided and he could have saved Bhagat Singh Ji. I agree Gandhi could have done better in handelling this particular case.\n\nNow I do subscribe to the idea of Akahnd Bharat and really hope someday we will get there and aware that Gandhi is also accused of favoring one religion over other at the time of partition. Also it is said that he had illicit relations with females, but don\'t know much about it.\n\nIt is said he even changed the song "Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram" and added/modified some of the verses, but isn\'t this the Indian culture that allowed us to have several versions of Ramayan depending on the time, social scenarios and current beliefs, same way he may have tried to create harmony changing the song between the two religions which was the root cause of partition in the first place.\n\nI have no problems(infact support) if pictures of other freedom fighters are used on currency notes.\n\nHad it not been for Gandhi, Indian people would not have come together so easily for any cause such as self employment, cleanliness, equality and also the right to freedom.\n\nNo doubt some of his choices could have been better but after all he too was a human and was bound with the situation at hand at that time. We do not know in what scenarios which decision was taken.\n\nIn the current time people are misusing his name to gain political advantage, but somehow they are ruining his name.\n\nIf Rabindranath Tagore calls him Mahatma, then he must have got something in him. If thousands of people start following his footsteps he must have got something in him.\n\nI may not have much idea about several of the things I said above about him, but one thing is for sure that it doesn\'t stop me to use Ji after his name, so Gandhi Ji.\n\nAs a citizen or followers we should acknowledge his failures and bad choices, nothing can stop for having respect for him.\n\nSome people will say I forgot Lal Bahar Shastri Ji, but no.\n\nSo happy Gandhi Jayanti, happy Shastri Jayanti, happy International Day for Non-violence.'<br />Author: 'NullandRandom'<br />id: 'j3lvc9'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li>

So my fellow REAL country loving Indians, never let these people make you doubt the fact that you were born in the greatest country in the world and that one day people from western countries will be dying to immigrate to India. Never let these people make you question your love for your country and never EVER forget that you all (and I) are fortunate to call ourselves INDIANS.\n\nJai Hind'<br />Author: 'collegeboy2007'<br />id: 'j3ci4f'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li>
