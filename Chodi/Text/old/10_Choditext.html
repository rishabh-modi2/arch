We need to understand historical developments to know how we landed in this current situation.\n\n* Left in India is inherited from Colonisers, whose social theories were designed to justify their rule (white man\'s burden). However, Its been 78 years and we should own up our faults. \n* Left got a head-start in Independent India. Nehru and Gandhi were influenced by left academics of their time.\n* Lack of opposition (or enough to be heard), has led Congress to continue Nehruvian Sociology ideas.\n* UPA: Congress + Left regime. This regime saw the biggest change, left leaning parties started controlling education institutes from primary to higher level, most of our text books got really biased at this time.\n* Economic liberalisation: Much needed thing, that congress was forced to do as directed by World Bank, did helped us economically but this is also the time that many external forces with political, religious and other malign intentions started entering India. These foreign NGO\'s directly or indirectly recruit JNU/TISS (or similar) students for their think tanks. The loop is complete, job options for left wing students are not limited to academia any more, they are hired by big International think tanks, media houses, etc..  \n* The current situation at mentioned Social Studies university: Its the former left academician who guides new comers, dictates what is allowed and what not. There are restrictions on what is qualified to be used as reference (citations). So these universities have left leaning academicians, attract more such people.\n\nOur current approach will not work.\n\n* We Engineers, Doctors, people of occupations can teach our future generation about all the glory, they ultimately have to study in schools and universities where left dominates. There are enough instances that we read and hear about on Internet where kids of a really cultural parents end up hating their own roots. This has led to conventional wisdom: "The more a person spends time on university, the chances are he/she will be a leftist".\n* Participating in Social Media reactions (twitter trends, rating on Google Play store), can teach manners and make understand the ground realities to companies for now, but the left has a real good grip on them and it will not break for our hashtags.\n\nThat being said, I\'m not denying current government is not aware of it or doing anything to damage control [article](https://swarajyamag.com/ideas/jnu-is-beyond-hope-but-ashoka-and-krea-can-learn-from-new-university-of-austin). These efforts are equal to adding a new fish to a rotten pond, it ultimately dies.'<br />Author: 'branthebroken__'<br />id: 'qw2vxn'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

We are slowly losing everything to them. Is it too late?"<br />Body: 'Ok so hear me out. this particular issue is very close to my hear. Infact this issue is literally the only reason I support BJP.\n\n**I wouldn\'t have any problem with them if this issue was somehow solved. However, no party is doing anything about this, and I\'m just feeling more and more helpless and dejected with every passing day.  Idk what I can do as a teenager to change any of this.**\n\nSo here\'s the deal. Muslims grow A LOT faster than any other religion in our country.\n\nHindus made up 79.8% of IndiaтАЩs 1.2 billion (120 crore) total inhabitants in the most recent census, conducted in 2011. That is 0.7 percentage points less than in the previous census in 2001, and 4.3 points below the 84.1% recorded in 1951. Meanwhile, the share of Muslims grew from 13.4% in 2001 to 14.2% in 2011 тАУ up by a total of 4.4 percentage points since 1951, when the census found that Muslims comprised 9.8% of IndiaтАЩs population.\n\n[https://www.pewforum.org/2021/09/21/religious-composition-of-india/](https://www.pewforum.org/2021/09/21/religious-composition-of-india/)\n\nWant to know the estimate for 2020?   According to Pew Research Center, there can be 213 million Muslims in 2020, India\'s 15.5% population.  That leaves Hindu to less than 79 percent.\n\n**So basically, Hindus went from 85 percent of the population to just 79 percent, and Muslims went from under 10 percent of the population to more than 15.5 percent. And they are showing no signs of stopping.**\n\nBuddhists, Sikhs and Jains all have fertility rates well below the national average and are therefore projected to shrink as a share of the population.\n\nc[https://www.pewforum.org/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/](https://www.pewforum.org/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/)\n\nLet me make it clear that Muslims were just around 25 percent of the whole subcontinent at the time of partition. We are headed for the same dark path again.\n\nI wanted to highlight the 2 most dangerous states.  Assam, and Kerala.\n\nHere are the stats for Assam. In 2901, Muslims were just 12 percent of the population.  **By 2001, they were 30.92%, in 2011 they became 34.22%, and FINALLY in 2021, they numbered at 40.03%**\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam\\_in\\_Assam#Population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Assam#Population)\n\nTHIS IS FRIGHTENING. THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF ASSAM ARE CLOSE TO BECOMING A MINORITY IN LITERALLY A FEW DECADES.  THE TRIBES THEIR ARE AFRAID OF THEIR WAY OF LIFE BEING DESTROYED.\n\nThat is why they are electing BJP.  But liberals cannot see their plight, because poor tribes or minorities that aren\'t Abrahamic don\'t matter to them. Unfortunately, it\'s too late for them.  All we can do now is learn from their demise, and make sure this doesn\'t happen again.\n\nThe second victim is - Kerala. The case of Kerala is even more tragic, because unlike Assam which was fucked over by Migration, Kerala was destroyed because of the low birth rate of it\'s Hindus, and their high conversion.   Hindus were 68.5 percent of the population in 1901, today, they were just 54 percent of the population in 2011.\n\nThat\'s not even the most tragic part. The thing is that Kerala Hindus will soon be outnumbered by Muslims, who were 24 percent of the population in 2011. You might ask, how tf will that happen? I\'ll show you a shocking stat.\n\n**In 2018, 43.80% of the total reported births in the state were to Muslims, 41.61% to Hindus, 14.31% to Christians and 0.25% to others, according to the vital statistics published by the Government of Kerala.**\n\n[http://www.ecostat.kerala.gov.in/images/pdf/publications/Vital\\_Statistics/data/vital\\_statistics\\_2018.pdf](http://www.ecostat.kerala.gov.in/images/pdf/publications/Vital_Statistics/data/vital_statistics_2018.pdf)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion\\_in\\_Kerala#Demographics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Kerala#Demographics)\n\nSo basically, **24 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR 44 PERCENT OF BIRTHS, WHILE 54 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR JUST 41 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL BIRTHS?**\n\nWTFFFFFF\n\nThese states are the two biggest victims. West Bengal has 30 percent Muslims, but their 70 percent Hindu majority is so pathetic that I don\'t even feel like mentioning them.  They deserve everything that\'s coming to them.\n\n**There\'s also the fact that Hindus are overcounted A LOT**.   According to the National Family Health Survey, most Indian households (75%) belong to a caste category that is eligible for government reservations, but this varies widely by religious affiliation, ranging from 15% of Jains to 98% of Buddhists. About three-quarters (76%) of Christians belong to a historically disadvantaged caste, including 21% who say they are members of a Scheduled Caste. **However, on the Indian census, Christians are not able to identify as members of a Scheduled Caste, which may lead to an undercount of Christians in the census.** In the same survey, smaller shares of Muslims identified as belonging to a Scheduled Caste or Tribe, but over half said they were members of OBCs.\n\nSo a lot of Dalits are crypto Christians or Muslims, who mark themselves as Hindus just for the reservation.\n\nThis addresses  the main issue, which is demographic change thru high birth rate. There\'s also the second issue, which is conversion.  It is no secret that most of the Northeastern states went from having negligible Christians to A LOT of them becoming one in the last 50-70 years, primarily due to missionaries.\n\nThere\'s also the fact that Indians culture is always demonized. Our gods are made joke of by "minorities" but if we get angry it\'s an attack on "free speech".\n\nHowever, all atrocities committed by Muslim and Christian rulers is whitewashed.  Even well known tyrants like Aurangzeb are being called "innocent" nowadays. Our genocide and erasing of our culture is being denied. The growth of Muslim population is being seen as "paranoia\' and "not a big change".\n\nIndian culture is being attacked from all sides. The demographics are quietly being changed. Our tribals are getting converted. Our languages and religious texts are being erased. Our temples are being controlled by the govt.  Nothing is going our way. BJP isn\'t doing shit either.\n\nThey are also creating cracks in our society, by dividing us again. Hatred is being created between south and north Indians, between Sikhs and Hindus, between Dalits an UCs, between different castes, between Gujratis and Marathis.  Between Banias and other castes. Our unity is slowly getting destroyed.\n\nOur country is getting demonized on the world stage for it\'s treatment of Muslims, even though WE are the actual victims.  And out future looks very bleak.\n\n**What should be done? HOW DO WE SAVE OUR COUNTRY? KYA KARE HUM?**Ok so hear me out. this particular issue is very close to my hear.

<li>Title: 'sAinT xAviEr lOvEd uS'<br />Body: '###Saint Francis Xavier on Temples and Idols:\n\nтАЬFollowing the baptisms, the new Christians return to their homes and come back with their wives and families to be in their turn also prepared for baptism. After all have been baptised, I order that everywhere the temples of the false gods be pulled down and idols broken. I know not how to describe in words the joy I feel before the spectacle of pulling down and destroying the idols by the very people who formerly worshipped them.тАЭ Xavier did this after the Hindu Raja of Quilon had given him a large grant to build churches!\n\nOn baptising and inducting children into Christianity, he wrote in 1543 to the Society of Jesus in Rome: тАЬThese children, I trust heartily, by the grace of God, will be much better than their fathers. They show an ardent love for the Divine law, and an extraordinary zeal for learning our holy religion and imparting it to others. Their hatred for idolatry is marvellous. They get into feuds with the heathen about it, and whenever their own parents practise it, they reproach them and come off to tell me at once. Whenever I hear of any act of idolatrous worship, I go to the place with a large band of these children, who very soon load the devil with a greater amount of insult and abuse than he has lately received of honor and worship from their parents, relations, and acquaintances. The children run at the idols, upset them, dash them down, break them to pieces, spit on them, trample on them, kick them about, and in short heap on them every possible outrage."\n\n\n###Saint Francis Xavier on Brahmins:\n\nIn his letters to the Jesuits in Rome, Xavier wrote: тАЬThere are in these parts among the pagans a class of men called Brahmins. They are as perverse and wicked a set as can anywhere be found, and to whom applies the Psalm which says: тАШFrom an unholy race, and wicked and crafty men, deliver me, Lord.тАЩ If it were not for the Brahmins, we should have all the heathens embracing our faith.\n\nLord Minto, Governor General of India from 1807 to 1812, submitted a Note to his superiors in London when the British Parliament was debating whether missionaries should be permitted in East India CompanyтАЩs domain under the Charter of 1813. He enclosed with his Note some тАЬpropaganda material used by the missionariesтАЭ and, referring to one missionary tract in particular, wrote: тАЬThe remainder of this tract seems to aim principally at a general massacre of the Brahmanas.тАЭ (M. D. David (ed.), Western Colonialism in Asia and Christianity, Bombay, 1988, p. 85). тАУ Koenraad Elst,\xa0Indigenous Indians: Agastya to Ambedkar, Voice of India, New Delhi, 1993.\n\n\n###Saint Francis Xavier\'s way of introducing Christianity to India:\n\nFrancis Xavier sent this letter to King John III of Portugal on May 16th, 1545: тАЬThe second necessity for the Christians is that your Majesty establish the Holy Inquisition, because there are many who live according to the Jewish law, and according to the Mahomedan sect, without any fear of God or shame of the world. And since there are many spread all over the fortresses, there is the need of the Holy Inquisition and of many preachers. Your Majesty should provide such necessary things for your loyal and faithful subjects in India.тАЭ тАУ Joseph Wicki, Documenta Indica, Vol. IV, Rome, 1956.\n\nHistorian Paul Roberts describes what went on in the InquisitionтАЩs Goa court that had been housed in the SultanтАЩs old palace and had a huge plaster image of Christ overlooking the scene: тАЬChildren were flogged and slowly dismembered in front of their parents, whose eyelids had been sliced off to make sure they missed nothing. Extremities were amputated carefully, so that a person could remain conscious even when all that remained was a torso and head. Male genitals were removed and burned in front of wives, breasts hacked off and vaginas penetrated by swords while husbands were forced to watchтАж. And it went on for two hundred years.тАЭ тАУ Paul Williams Roberts,\xa0The Empire of the Soul: Some Journeys in India, New York, 1997.\n\n----Francis Xavier SJ: The man and his mission'<br />Author: 'Mister-Pottasium'<br />id: 'qsob1m'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
