Meaning i need huge amount of data which is hard to collect and also very time consuming. I'm making a discord channel where members can join and send data sources like links, photos, files, folders or any other form of data. Alot of searching and verification from the internet is required.\n\nAs i said before, the website needs data. I don't mind if we are slow to display data, but this may get boring and people may not even want to look into posting or sharing any data just cause its tiring and boring. \n\nSo I want to know how many of you have alternatives in mind? How many of you would be willing to post through the website? How many of you would help collect and verify data on the discord server for the website?"<br />Author: 'kenwaysharma'<br />id: 'hite31'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: "Bhaiyo, this is a petition on an important matter let's not drag it into 'communal oppression' agenda, if you can support it then it can be helpful"<br />Body: 'http://chng.it/tGTMBH5kWh\n\nWhile entire India is dealing with coronavirus crisis, mine is compounded by shrill noise coming from the loudspeakers of nearby masjids, 5 times a day. Though I am not against any religion still the consequences of piercing noise compelled me to inquire from others residing in my locality at Bandra as to the effect that this noise is having on them. I learnt that children and old people are the most affected. Of course, their immunities are compromised with stress levels increasing and blood pressure rising. Others also were compelled to listen to things which they have no interest or reason to listen to. The practice of calling azaan originated hundreds of years ago when people did not have watches and clocks to guide them as to the time to pray. Nowadays everyone has not only watches &amp; clocks but smartphones with alarms. Therefore not only is making noise at such high volume against the law but it is not practically justified by any need or emergency or exception necessitating it. This forced me to widen the gamut of my research wherein I found that Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules 2000 has been promulgated and the use of loudspeakers and amplifiers without permission is banned. Even with permission, noise is required to be kept within permissible limits and breach thereof is an offence. I also learnt that Supreme Court and Bombay High Court have passed judgments directing police authorities to enforce the law. However, for reasons best known, the police authorities have done little and rarely took action against this illegal act. Through this petition, I seek support of everyone to urge the police machinery to take strictest action as per law so that peace and quiet that is our right as citizens can be restored in our lives.'<br />Author: 'braVishi'<br />id: 'hgt6un'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li>

We are making them available online as they form an essential resource for the public and researchers. As per our initial analysis a majority of website blocking being done due to copyright claims and court orders.\n\nPublic Disclosure: reducing secrecy and opacity\n\nWebsite blocking is a complex issue which seems to be growing in severity only with time. Ordinary Indians who access the internet --- which is a public resource -- still do not know the reason why a specific website is blocked. Sometimes, even the persons who run these websites do not have knowledge as to the reasons and the legal authority which has directed the blocking of websites.\n\nWe have earlier explained the legal position in respect of [**porn websites**](https://internetfreedom.in/whattheblock/), how sometimes [**blocking is inconsistently done at the ISP level**](https://internetfreedom.in/what-the-block-iff-has-heard-your-complaints-and-is-taking-action-savetheinternet/), and done a preliminary analysis of the [several orders we had received through RTIs](https://internetfreedom.in/a-tale-of-rogue-pirates-ashok-kumars-and-isps-caught-in-the-middle-rti-data-on-court-ordered-website-blocking-reveals-worrying-trends-whattheblock/). Our continuing attempts to increase transparency around this issue received a boost. A whistleblower has [**provided orders**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XtWN1FGTnalCIOiEdCLtIbuGM-d_3IYR?usp=sharing) sent by courts and government authorities to Internet Service Providers across India. These contain more than 64 documents and provide explanations for the blocking of about 4398 websites. Today we are publishing them for public knowledge and the wider research community.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8xt7sd8z0f751.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef94165a3195c54f6d582103a5026617443bb8f3\n\nPreliminary inferences\n\nWe have three preliminary inferences to share on these orders. While offering these inferences we would like to point out that this is a limited data set and is likely to display a bias given the total data field of all blocking orders is not publicly available. At the same time, we find value in providing an initial analysis that confirms several points on the reasons for blocking, or the more recent instance of how the [**WeTransfer block** ](https://internetfreedom.in/we-urge-the-dot-to-unblock-wetransfer-whattheblock/)was effected without proper transparency.\n\n* **Courts are primary actors:** The public authorities from which most of these orders arise are from courts situated in Delhi and Chennai. This is principally the High Court of Delhi and the High Court of Madras. The nature of the orders are interim injunctions on claims by content owners. Here quite often file sharing and movie streaming websites are being blocked. Here processes for specific takedowns on URLs is not the preferred route but entire websites are blocked. A casual read through the list of URLs confirms this.\n* **Website blocking is inconsistent:** Internet users all across India who use different ISPs have very different experiences on website blocking. This may be due to the technology used, the nature of blocking that is affected and varies from each ISPs compliance in each specific region where they may be offering services through a different technical infrastructure. This is specifically through Document No. 59 which is a non-compliance report in which correspondence was specifically directed to ISPs to block websites in terms of an earlier order.\n* **Lack of opposition and transparency:** Despite the large impression carried that a majority of blocking orders are affected by Government, as stated these primarily occur through infringement claims made by private parties. In most of these cases, the defendants are a few websites, ISPs and Government Departments. It is not clear whether any opposition is presented and whether a high level of scrutiny is visited prior to the directions for blocking being made. While many of such claims may be legitimate there do exist legitimate arguments on proportionality and how over-broad intellectual property enforcement results in deprivations of the public‚Äôs right to access materials online. This issue is further compounded by the insufficient notice to people as there does not exist any central, or government repository for housing and publishing their directions for blocking websites.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xvei86x01f751.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93cc4182e9e4ea14998798683f60633c2a3f8720\n\nThe Tanul Thakur Case\n\nWe have identified that it is a lack of proactive publication and transparency in India‚Äôs blocking process whether through courts or executive bodies which is causing a fracture of public trust in the exercise of this power. At present, there is a writ petition pending before the High Court of Delhi regarding the blocking of the satirical website, ‚Äú[**Dowry Calculator**](https://internetfreedom.in/delhi-hc-issues-notice-to-the-government-for-blocking-satirical-dowry-calculator-website/)‚Äù.\n\nWe have been working with Tanul Thakur, the petitioner and the creator of this website since May 2019 with drafting and filing RTI applications and we also assisted with the writ petition. Our hope through this intervention is that it helps support greater transparency and the norms of proper notice to website creators, hearings in which they can put forward a defence followed by public disclosure of the decision.

<li>Title: 'Peddling half-truths is centuries old habit of Muslim historians'<br />Body: 'V. K. Rajwade was a veteran Marathi historian, who perhaps contributed most to shed light on Maratha history by compiling historic Marathi and Sanskrit documents and making commentaries. He wrote his commentaries in the preface, one such preface to a 17th-century manuscript called "Radha Madhav Vilas Champu", which is essentially a biography of Chhatrapati Shivaji\'s father Shahaji written by someone during his lifetime. \n\nThe following paragraph is a word to word translation of paragraph 48 of that preface.\n\n\\---\n\nMir Jumla was Abdullah Qutb Shah\'s vizier. He was famous for his wealth and diplomacy all over India. He attacked south Karnataka in 1652 CE. Karnataka was desired by both Adilshah and Qutbshah since it was adjacent to their realm and strategically important. Adilshah sent Shahaji from his side. Mij Jumla fought a bloody war with Shahaji after entering Karnataka, in which Mir Jumla was routed by Shahaji. Finally, Mir Jumla ran off to the fort of Gooty. Shahaji sieged the fort and Mir Jumla had to surrender and sign the treaty.  Contemporary Muslim chroniclers don\'t even mention this vastly successful campaign of Shahaji. They occasionally mention some Muslim generals of Adilshahi carried out a successful campaign with flying mentions or secondary attributes to Shahaji. The same chroniclers then complain Shahaji got stronger. Conclusion of these accounts is clear. The Muslim chroniclers did not write the painful(for them) reality of Maratha general winning wars and getting stronger.\n\n\\---'<br />Author: 'nanafadanavis'<br />id: 'hgpmxw'<br />Flair :Research</li>

<li>Title: 'THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MODERN LEFTISM'<br />Body: 'Almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled society. One of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world is leftism, so a discussion of the psychology of leftism can serve as an introduction to the discussion of the problems of modern society in general.\n\n7. But what is leftism? During the first half of the 20th century leftism could have been practically identified with socialism. Today the movement is fragmented and it is not clear who can properly be called a leftist. When we speak of leftists in this article we have in mind mainly socialists, collectivists, ‚Äúpolitically correct‚Äù types, fminsts, gy and disability activists, animal rights activists and the like. But not everyone who is associated with one of these movements is a leftist. What we are trying to get at in discussing leftism is not so much movement or an ideology as a psychological type, or rather a collection of related types. Thus, what we mean by ‚Äúleftism‚Äù will emerge more clearly in the course of our discussion of leftist psychology. (Also, see paragraphs 227-230.)\n\n8. Even so, our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less clear than we would wish, but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any remedy for this. All we are trying to do here is indicate in a rough and approximate way the two psychological tendencies that we believe are the main driving force of modern leftism. We by no means claim to be telling the WHOLE truth about leftist psychology. Also, our discussion is meant to apply to modern leftism only. We leave open the question of the extent to which our discussion could be applied to the leftists of the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n9. The two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we call ‚Äúfeelings of inferiority‚Äù and ‚Äúoversocialization.‚Äù Feelings of inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole, while oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of modern leftism; but this segment is highly influential.\n\nFEELINGS OF INFERIORITY\n\n10. By ‚Äúfeelings of inferiority‚Äù we mean not only inferiority feelings in the strict sense but a whole spectrum of related traits; low self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, depressive tendencies, defeatism, guilt, self- hatred, etc. We argue that modern leftists tend to have some such feelings (possibly more or less repressed) and that these feelings are decisive in determining the direction of modern leftism.\n\n11. When someone interprets as derogatory almost anything that is said about him (or about groups with whom he identifies) we conclude that he has inferiority feelings or low self-esteem. This tendency is pronounced among minority rights activists, whether or not they belong to the minority groups whose rights they defend. They are hypersensitive about the words used to designate minorities and about anything that is said concerning minorities. The terms ‚Äún,‚Äù ‚Äúor,‚Äù ‚Äúhandicapped‚Äù or ‚Äúchick‚Äù for an African, an Asian, a disabled person or a woman originally had no derogatory connotation. ‚ÄúBroad‚Äù and ‚Äúchick‚Äù were merely the feminine equivalents of ‚Äúguy,‚Äù ‚Äúdude‚Äù or ‚Äúfellow.‚Äù The negative connotations have been attached to these terms by the activists themselves. Some animal rights activists have gone so far as to reject the word ‚Äúpet‚Äù and insist on its replacement by ‚Äúanimal companion.‚Äù Leftish anthropologists go to great lengths to avoid saying anything about primitive peoples that could conceivably be interpreted as negative. They want to replace the world ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù by ‚Äúnonliterate.‚Äù They seem almost paranoid about anything that might suggest that any primitive culture is inferior to our own. (We do not mean to imply that primitive cultures ARE inferior to ours. We merely point out the hypersensitivity of leftish anthropologists.)\n\n12. Those who are most sensitive about ‚Äúpolitically incorrect‚Äù terminology are not the average black - dweller, Asian immigrant, abused woman or disabled person, but a minority of activists, many of whom do not even belong to any ‚Äúoppressed‚Äù group but come from privileged strata of society. Political correctness has its stronghold among university professors, who have secure employment with comfortable salaries, and the majority of whom are heterosexual white males from middle- to upper-middle-class families.\n\n13. Many leftists have an intense identification with the problems of groups that have an image of being weak (women), defeated (American Indians), repellent (homosexuals) or otherwise inferior. The leftists themselves feel that these groups are inferior. They would never admit to themselves that they have such feelings, but it is precisely because they do see these groups as inferior that they identify with their problems. (We do not mean to suggest that women, Indians, etc. ARE inferior; we are only making a point about leftist psychology.)\n\n14. Fminsts are desperately anxious to prove that women are as strong and as capable as men. Clearly they are nagged by a fear that women may NOT be as strong and as capable as men.\n\n15. Leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being strong, good and successful. They hate America, they hate Western civilization, they hate white males, they hate rationality. The reasons that leftists give for hating the West, etc. clearly do not correspond with their real motives. They SAY they hate the West because it is warlike, imperialistic, sexist, ethnocentric and so forth, but where these same faults appear in socialist countries or in primitive cultures, the leftist finds excuses for them, or at best he GRUDGINGLY admits that they exist; whereas he ENTHUSIASTICALLY points out (and often greatly exaggerates) these faults where they appear in Western civilization. Thus it is clear that these faults are not the leftist‚Äôs real motive for hating America and the West. He hates America and the West because they are strong and successful.\n\n16. Words like ‚Äúself-confidence,‚Äù ‚Äúself-reliance,‚Äù ‚Äúinitiative,‚Äù ‚Äúenterprise,‚Äù ‚Äúoptimism,‚Äù etc., play little role in the liberal and leftist vocabulary. The leftist is anti-individualistic, pro-collectivist. He wants society to solve everyone‚Äôs problems for them, satisfy everyone‚Äôs needs for them, take care of them. He is not the sort of person who has an inner sense of confidence in his ability to solve his own problems and satisfy his own needs. The leftist is antagonistic to the concept of competition because, deep inside, he feels like a loser.\n\n17. Art forms that appeal to modern leftish intellectuals tend to focus on sordidness, defeat and despair, or else they take an orgiastic tone, throwing off rational control as if there were no hope of accomplishing anything through rational calculation and all that was left was to immerse oneself in the sensations of the moment.\n\n18. Modern leftish philosophers tend to dismiss reason, science, objective reality and to insist that everything is culturally relative. It is true that one can ask serious questions about the foundations of scientific knowledge and about how, if at all, the concept of objective reality can be defined. But it is obvious that modern leftish philosophers are not simply cool-headed logicians systematically analyzing the foundations of knowledge. They are deeply involved emotionally in their attack on truth and reality. They attack these concepts because of their own psychological needs. For one thing, their attack is an outlet for hostility, and, to the extent that it is successful, it satisfies the drive for power. More importantly, the leftist hates science and rationality because they classify certain beliefs as true (i.e., successful, superior) and other beliefs as false (i.e., failed, inferior). The leftist‚Äôs feelings of inferiority run so deep that he cannot tolerate any classification of some things as successful or superior and other things as failed or inferior. This also underlies the rejection by many leftists of the concept of mental illness and of the utility of IQ tests. Leftists are antagonistic to genetic explanations of human abilities or behavior because such explanations tend to make some persons appear superior or inferior to others. Leftists prefer to give society the credit or blame for an individual‚Äôs ability or lack of it. Thus if a person is ‚Äúinferior‚Äù it is not his fault, but society‚Äôs, because he has not been brought up properly.\n\n19. The leftist is not typically the kind of person whose feelings of inferiority make him a braggart, an egotist, a bully, a self-promoter, a ruthless competitor. This kind of person has not wholly lost faith in himself. He has a deficit in his sense of power and self-worth, but he can still conceive of himself as having the capacity to be strong, and his efforts to make himself strong produce his unpleasant behavior. [1] But the leftist is too far gone for that. His feelings of inferiority are so ingrained that he cannot conceive of himself as individually strong and valuable. Hence the collectivism of the leftist. He can feel strong only as a member of a large organization or a mass movement with which he identifies himself.\n\n20. Notice the masochistic tendency of leftist tactics. Leftists protest by lying down in front of vehicles, they intentionally provoke police or racists to abuse them, etc. These tactics may often be effective, but many leftists use them not as a means to an end but because they PREFER masochistic tactics. Self-hatred is a leftist trait.\n\n21. Leftists may claim that their activism is motivated by compassion or by moral principles, and moral principle does play a role for the leftist of the oversocialized type. But compassion and moral principle cannot be the main motives for leftist activism. Hostility is too prominent a component of leftist behavior; so is the drive for power. Moreover, much leftist behavior is not rationally calculated to be of benefit to the people whom the leftists claim to be trying to help. For example, if one believes that affirmative action is good for black people, does it make sense to demand affirmative action in hostile or dogmatic terms? Obviously it would be more productive to take a diplomatic and conciliatory approach that would make at least verbal and symbolic concessions to white people who think that affirmative action discriminates against them. But leftist activists do not take such an approach because it would not satisfy their emotional needs. Helping black people is not their real goal. Instead, race problems serve as an excuse for them to express their own hostility and frustrated need for power. In doing so they actually harm black people, because the activists‚Äô hostile attitude toward the white majority tends to intensify race hatred.\n\n22. If our society had no social problems at all, the leftists would have to INVENT problems in order to provide themselves with an excuse for making a fuss.\n\n23. We emphasize that the foregoing does not pretend to be an accurate description of everyone who might be considered a leftist. It is only a rough indication of a general tendency of leftism.\n\nOVERSOCIALIZATION\n\n24. Psychologists use the term ‚Äúsocialization‚Äù to designate the process by which children are trained to think and act as society demands. A person is said to be well socialized if he believes in and obeys the moral code of his society and fits in well as a functioning part of that society. It may seem senseless to say that many leftists are oversocialized, since the leftist is perceived as a rebel. Nevertheless, the position can be defended. Many leftists are not such rebels as they seem.\n\n25. The moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think, feel and act in a completely moral way. For example, we are not supposed to hate anyone, yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time or other, whether he admits it to himself or not. Some people are so highly socialized that the attempt to think, feel and act morally imposes a severe burden on them. In order to avoid feelings of guilt, they continually have to deceive themselves about their own motives and find moral explanations for feelings and actions that in reality have a non-moral origin. We use the term ‚Äúoversocialized‚Äù to describe such people. [2]\n\n26. Oversocialization can lead to low self-esteem, a sense of powerlessness, defeatism, guilt, etc. One of the most important means by which our society socializes children is by making them feel ashamed of behavior or speech that is contrary to society‚Äôs expectations. If this is overdone, or if a particular child is especially susceptible to such feelings, he ends by feeling ashamed of HIMSELF. Moreover the thought and the behavior of the oversocialized person are more restricted by society‚Äôs expectations than are those of the lightly socialized person. The majority of people engage in a significant amount of naughty behavior. They lie, they commit petty thefts, they break traffic laws, they goof off at work, they hate someone, they say spiteful things or they use some underhanded trick to get ahead of the other guy. The oversocialized person cannot do these things, or if he does do them he generates in himself a sense of shame and self-hatred. The oversocialized person cannot even experience, without guilt, thoughts or feelings that are contrary to the accepted morality; he cannot think ‚Äúunclean‚Äù thoughts. And socialization is not just a matter of morality; we are socialized to conform to many norms of behavior that do not fall under the heading of morality. Thus the oversocialized person is kept on a psychological leash and spends his life running on rails that society has laid down for him. In many oversocialized people this results in a sense of constraint and powerlessness that can be a severe hardship. We suggest that oversocialization is among the more serious cruelties that human beings inflict on one another.\n\n27. We argue that a very important and influential segment of the modern left is oversocialized and that their oversocialization is of great importance in determining the direction of modern leftism. Leftists of the oversocialized type tend to be intellectuals or members of the upper-middle class. Notice that university intellectuals [3] constitute the most highly socialized segment of our society and also the most left-wing segment.\n\n28. The leftist of the oversocialized type tries to get off his psychological leash and assert his autonomy by rebelling. But usually he is not strong enough to rebel against the most basic values of society. Generally speaking, the goals of today‚Äôs leftists are NOT in conflict with the accepted morality. On the contrary, the left takes an accepted moral principle, adopts it as its own, and then accuses mainstream society of violating that principle. Examples: racial equality, equality of the sexes, helping poor people, peace as opposed to war, nonviolence generally, freedom of expression, kindness to animals. More fundamentally, the duty of the individual to serve society and the duty of society to take care of the individual. All these have been deeply rooted values of our society (or at least of its middle and upper classes [4] for a long time. These values are explicitly or implicitly expressed or presupposed in most of the material presented to us by the mainstream communications media and the educational system. Leftists, especially those of the oversocialized type, usually do not rebel against these principles but justify their hostility to society by claiming (with some degree of truth) that society is not living up to these principles.\n\n29. Here is an illustration of the way in which the oversocialized leftist shows his real attachment to the conventional attitudes of our society while pretending to be in rebellion against it. Many leftists push for affirmative action, for moving black people into high-prestige jobs, for improved education in black schools and more money for such schools; the way of life of the black ‚Äúunderclass‚Äù they regard as a social disgrace. They want to integrate the black man into the system, make him a business executive, a lawyer, a scientist just like upper-middle-class white people. The leftists will reply that the last thing they want is to make the black man into a copy of the white man; instead, they want to preserve African American culture. But in what does this preservation of African American culture consist? It can hardly consist in anything more than eating black-style food, listening to black-style music, wearing black-style clothing and going to a black- style church or mosque. In other words, it can express itself only in superficial matters. In all ESSENTIAL respects most leftists of the oversocialized type want to make the black man conform to white, middle-class ideals. They want to make him study technical subjects, become an executive or a scientist, spend his life climbing the status ladder to prove that black people are as good as white. They want to make black fathers ‚Äúresponsible,‚Äù they want black gangs to become nonviolent, etc. But these are exactly the values of the industrial-technological system. The system couldn‚Äôt care less what kind of music a man listens to, what kind of clothes he wears or what religion he believes in as long as he studies in school, holds a respectable job, climbs the status ladder, is a ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù parent, is nonviolent and so forth. In effect, however much he may deny it, the oversocialized leftist wants to integrate the black man into the system and make him adopt its values.\n\n30. We certainly do not claim that leftists, even of the oversocialized type, NEVER rebel against the fundamental values of our society. Clearly they sometimes do. Some oversocialized leftists have gone so far as to rebel against one of modern society‚Äôs most important principles by engaging in physical violence. By their own account, violence is for them a form of ‚Äúliberation.‚Äù In other words, by committing violence they break through the psychological restraints that have been trained into them. Because they are oversocialized these restraints have been more confining for them than for others; hence their need to break free of them. But they usually justify their rebellion in terms of mainstream values. If they engage in violence they claim to be fighting against racism or the like.\n\n31. We realize that many objections could be raised to the foregoing thumbnail sketch of leftist psychology. The real situation is complex, and anything like a complete description of it would take several volumes even if the necessary data were available. We claim only to have indicated very roughly the two most important tendencies in the psychology of modern leftism.\n\n32. The problems of the leftist are indicative of the problems of our society as a whole. Low self-esteem, depressive tendencies and defeatism are not restricted to the left. Though they are especially noticeable in the left, they are widespread in our society. And today‚Äôs society tries to socialize us to a greater extent than any previous society. We are even told by experts how to eat, how to exercise, how to make love, how to raise our kids and so forth.'<br />Author: 'dhtura'<br />id: 'hg97df'<br />Flair :Randia Simulation</li>

Now, if you look at the location of South Korea you understand its importance to China. I\'ve timestamped the video but watching it in full is quite instructive in light of the news of Congress party signing MOU with CCP.  Highlights if you want to know the gist of it.\n\nBTW, I worked in South Korea for a while and I kind of understand the country and its politics a bit more than an average Indian.\n\n1. China is building a large complex in south-west island of South Korea where it plans to bring in native Chinese and house them. They get voting rights after 3 years of residency\n2. China has been building multiple "China Town"s throughout the country. This way it got its foot in the door and started political brainwashing of commoners. Why is this brain washing possible? There are divided families between NK/SK and China tells them that presence of US in SK is stopping them from uniting them with their families. This argument has genuine currency.\n3. China bought top politicians and signed MOU with Democratic party (and not the govt). Now those party members are saying things like -"We should nationalize the land". Over a period of time, this will become a mainstream idea. And then, when "nationalization" happens, CCP will walk in and buy the country up.\n\nCCP does this kind of things everywhere. There is no need to work with WHO when you can buy people who work there for cheap. There is no need to work with the govts when you can buy people belonging to national parties for cheap. And this is where congress comes in IMO. It appears to my eyes that congress has already sold our country - hadn\'t BJP come to power unexpectedly, all the selling could have unraveled in front of our own eyes and we could do nothing about it. Yes, it\'s that scary!\n\nNow I understand why European countries are saying China is a threat to democracies all over the world.'<br />Author: 'ennis-jahsiah'<br />id: 'hegs9f'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion</li>

Fake news creates impression and beliefs \n\nbased on\n\nfalse premises leading to divison, misunderstanding and further exacerbating \n\notherwise\n\ntenuous  relations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe distribution of false information through fake news has become easier in \n\nthe age\n\nof internet, where anyone can post a report or a statement to resemble a news \n\nstory and claim\n\nit as true and factual. Fake news or information cause or intend to cause \n\npanic, division,\n\nchaos, violence, hate or must exhibit or intend to exhibit a propaganda to \n\nblacken or discredit\n\none\'s reputation. A large number of incidents of mob lynching have reported \n\nfrom various\n\npart of the country due to the spread of fake news in the social media like \n\nwhatsapp, Facebook,\n\nTwitter, etc. Studies have also found evidence of political parties spreading \n\npropaganda on\n\nsocial networks during elections in the country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the India being one of the most virtually-connected countries in the world \n\nwith\n\nmillion active social media users, we have access to platforms of media and \n\naccess to any\n\narray  of  information  available  on  the  web,  some  with  questionable  \n\nsources.  While  the\n\nresponsibility of discerning lie from truth falls with the person using the \n\ninformation, it is a\n\nmoral duty of the State to protect its people from such lies in the first \n\nplace. There is need to\n\ncurb the existence of disreputable news sources and prevent established mass \n\nmedia outlets\n\nfrom careless publishing of unverified or false content.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt present, India does not have a specific law to deal with menace of fake \n\nnews. Other\n\ncountries have taken strides in preventing the spread of false information \n\nthrough legislations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe need is to nip the cause of fake news in the bud by prohibiting the \n\ncreation and\n\nmalicious distribution of false information.

<li>Title: 'This is my personal opinion. I would love to know your view on this.'<br />Body: "**I am a proud and devout Hindu.**  \n**I am a proud and devout Hindu.** **I am a proud Indian.**  \n**I am a supporter of BJP.**   \nBut now my view is changing. Now I know that what I truly support, and what I truly believe is not in BJP, but right-wing ideology.  Let's be honest. There is only one party in the right-wing in India, i.e., the BJP. Uddhav Thackeray (Shiv Sena), betrayed us. The only party that is truly right-wing in India is the BJP. The rest are too small to consider. However, the left-wing has a huge list of parties. INC, BSP, CPI, AAP, AITC, etc. The leftists have a large set of options to choose from. The leftists have a choice. They can promote left-wing ideology by voting for any party that they choose. This is something right-wing followers don't have.  \n\n**We don't have a choice.**\n\n If we want to support right-wing ideology, we have to support BJP. There is no other way, simply because there is no other party we can choose from that supports right-wing ideology! When I have debates with leftists, I put forwards my points on right-wing ideology, and they keep countering my points by showing mistakes of BJP. Let's admit it. BJP brings out things with the best of intentions, and sometimes they are highly necessary, but they suck at the implementation of these. I want to promote a right-wing ideology, but when everybody imagines the right-wing of India with BJP and its mistakes, it is hard for me to do so. \n\nI support the right-wing. I want an Akhand Bharat. I want to live in a Hindu Rashtra. I want to live in a country that loves me for my religion, and where my religion does not become a problem for me.  When BJP makes mistakes, the image of the right-wing gets damaged. Statements of some of their politicians, allegations against some, comments on some issue, not raising a voice on some issue are all things that hurt the right-wing of India. \n\n **What we need now is a political party that endorses right-wing ideology and philosophy, no bullshit of trying to include all people.** We need a political party that supports Hindu's. We need a party which does not bring people who have huge allegations against them. We need a party that will help India become very serious competition for the USA and China. We need a party which doesn't allow BJP and it's politicians mistakes to tarnish the image of the right-wing.  \n\n**What we need, my friends is a choice.**  We need to have political parties on the right-wing that allow the Hindu's of our country to know that if not BJP, they have other right-wing parties to choose from.  \n\n**I will keep supporting BJP**, till a party/parties like this come forward. The reason for this is that currently, BJP is the only party that works for the betterment of the Hindu's. BJP is a good party, but giving it the complete control over the image of the right-wing is something I, and I hope a lot of you will not be ready to give. We need more options. We need more parties on the right-wing. We need more parties that work for Hindu's. \n\n **Jai Hind.** **Jai Bharat.**"<br />Author: 'AKartikeya'<br />id: 'hd4ggb'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion</li>
<li>Title: 'My father called me an anti-national'<br />Body: 'So, I am watching zee news and times now. Zee news shows we captured their colonel and he was released after high level meetings between both the countires. Times now, navika is interviewing Ram Madhav. She is asking questions about not telling the masses enough "non-confidential information". She says, \n\nNavika: "there was no information about chinese withholding our 10men and releasing after 30hours".\nRam Madhv : "I believe there was" \nNavika: "sir we have been burning the midnight oil and I am confirmed that there was no information about it, the mea revealed that none of our men habe been captive and that the head count is complete"\nRam Madhav jad to agree. \n\nIn yesterday\'s debate also, Major General G.D.Bakshi said due to Modi  government\'s extremely centralized structure, there is room for speculation because every person from down to top level looks above for information and confirmation, which I think he was hinting at de centralizing a bit. He has been posted in grave terrorist, toughterrains and I feel if someone like GDB is siggesting or implying something it should be paid heed to, and also that rahul gandhi, chest beating about we have given our land is false information, because from finger 4 to finger 8 in Galwan valley, there has been a yearly transgression from their side, because of their perception of LAC.\nI try explaining all this to my dad and he refuses to believe and trust anyone except the government.\n\nI understand the secrecy and security point of view. I understand there is a protocol and we can\'t be shelling out any and every information in the public domain but the information that is in the public domain, has to be clarified on the govs part. If Maj. Gen. G D Bakshi knows, if independent nationalist journalists and media houses like Zee News know then either you hide it well or you tell people who really want to know if their country is safe and we have all our men. \n\nBut for my dad, there is no grey area, it is either white or black. Either I am Rahul Gandhi or I am not. He says that I am talking like Rahu Gandhi and says my feelings and words are that of an anti national. It fuckin hurt like anything and  IAM NOT TALKING TO MY FATHER UNLESS HE TAKES HIS WORDS BACK!\n\nOH AND ALSO WHEN I SAY I DON\'T WANT CERTIFICATES FROM HIM, HE GETS UPSET. HE SAYS INHE MA-BAAP KI BAAT HI NAHIN SUNNI, UNKE BAAT NAHIN MANNI, BATAMEEZI KRNI H AND ALL THAT \'ol shit Indian parents say.\n\nI AM NOT AN ANTI NATIONAL!!! I LOVE MY COUNTRY. I\'LL FUCKIN PROVE IT ACTUALLY, I AM LEAVING MY JOB. I WILL GIVE CDS AND BE AN OFFICER.'<br />Author: 'paharganj2paris'<br />id: 'hd1uoc'<br />Flair :Rant</li>
