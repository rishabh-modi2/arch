Excess hate Hindus they like those Hindus who monkey balance or feel inferior. Bjp lost gosamahal. \nI feel Bjp has made Hindus alot communal towards issues . Muslim were always the same depending on sects and how they grow up . \nWhile owaisi have invested in Muslim education and healthcare.. What MIM plans is shift money nicely under the bed for Muslim areas more so than Hindu areas even if it's not legally procured. \nThey will make things look legal. While AIMPLB is communal which plays secular.  Owaisi doesn't hide his face just plays smart. \nBjp RSS needs nationalism yes but they need greater orators and those who know facts and can express it fearlessly without politically correctness without  hating any religious group.\n\n\nOwaisi doesn't understand Hindu culture at all and wants India to be a islamic republic slowly and slowly  so he will try truth and nail to not let India be a dharmic rashtra for this he nicely hides Muslim crimes . The patterns and many pan Islamist ideas . Which is far more dagerous than Hindu trolling Muslim in fb and then sleeping back. .\nFor example Owaisi knows Hindus have dumbfuck people like Dhruv rathee to break them .

<li>Title: 'Regarding the farmer protests.'<br />Body: " \n\nHi!\n\n[r/Chodi](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/)\xa0lurker here.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed here are my own.\n\nI have noticed a considerable uptick in memes about Sikhs, Sikhism, and the Sikh Empire due to the ongoing farmer protests.\n\nI have always enjoyed the content on this sub, but I must say this has been particularly vexing, the reasoning for which I have listed below-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Out of the 200,000-300,000 protestors from Punjab who are protesting the farm bills, there may have been just 10-20 or even a 100 who would've raised pro-Khalistani/anti-Hindu slogans.  \n \n2. Social Media and sensationalized news outlets blow stuff waayyyy out of proportion, to make it seem like the protest is more about the failed initiative that was Khalistan than genuine grievances about the bill. Keep in mind that the MSP system is the lifeblood of the Punjab economy, so even though many of you may support the bills, the grassroots farmers' opinions have precedence.  \n \n3. Even if some farmers who have 0 actual power show up with a picture of Bhindranwale, why is this subreddit giving any heed to their arguments by giving them so much importance? There are \\~30 million Sikhs in India and a neighbor that has openly lead operations to radicalize our brothers for years. There will always be a small group that has extremist views. The mainstream Sikh and Hindu reject all of this fundamentalism. Let that handful of extremists be ignored. That's the best way to handle fringe elements. Keep in mind that there has been virtually no violence between our communities for the past two decades since both are Dharmic faiths that espouse peace.  \n \n4. We're better than this. Due to the anti-Hindu sentiments of a few vague fellows among lakhs of peaceful farmers (the backbone of our nation), this subreddit has been tolerating a lot of anti-Sikh posts. Pro-Sikh organizations then feed off of this to cite a growing intolerance among the Hindu right-wing, even though they do not know the ground reality of a strong bond among all Indians.  \n \n5. Regardless of what is happening, or what may happen, it isn't cool how some have attacked the history, culture, and heritage of the Sikh faith. I may not be a Sikh, but I regard the Gurus with the same reverence as any other Great Hindu Saint. How do you think someone who has no knowledge about current affairs would feel if s/he scrolls through this sub, only to see hateful posts about his/her faith on the largest Hindu subreddit? I know I'd feel emotionally disenfranchised. Right now, we are doing to Sikhism what\xa0[r/india](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/)\xa0does to Hinduism.  \n \n6. As a nation, we must uphold our maturity. Remember the anti-Hindi protests of the '60s? Tamil Nadu was burning, and there were definitely some people in some hinterland villages who would've voiced separatist views. But what did the Central Government, and the rest of India do? Ignored it. Addressed the genuine grievances about linguistic hegemony, and ensured that all Indian languages are preserved and given equal importance. That was more than 50 years ago. Today, some of the most Virat Hindu and proudest Indians are my Tamil classmates. Let's uphold our Indian way to finesse the most daunting sociopolitical issues by making us even stronger as a nation.  \n \n\nI really hope that as a progressive online community, we can shirk any such posts that are crude generalizations and focus on the real problems at hand, rather than promulgating hatred.\n\nThat ends my 2 am rant.\n\nGoodnight :)"<br />Author: 'BaryonAsymmetry'<br />id: 'k72t2a'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Butthurt OP</li>

They can easily be confused with a good sold narrative. .\n\nI like a channel called civil beings. PROPOGANDA against govt is too high. \nPro modi means godi even if factually correct.\nThe protestors most aren't really genuine but some don't want free market as it ends monopoly of mandis and corporatism fear is being used.\nProblem is mandis are semi private structures who hold them . \nAlso deep propoganda using manipulated data and voices are being used.\nI feel there strong need of political neutrality . And also fact based info needs to be done tathery than emotional rheotric. .\n\nSikh divide is conditionally being created by Akalis and Congressis combined to push Bjp on backfoot.\nProblem is There are no real sikh supporters who get equal respect from Sikhs and hindus.\nHighly educated Hindus will not vote Bjp as much as Muslims suffering from unprogressive preachers especially women . \nI advise to stop anti Muslim rheotric become wiser."<br />Author: 'Trilokjit-Dey'<br />id: 'k72qg5'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li>
<li>Title: 'I have this feeling (I am a librandu, but read my post)'<br />Body: 'This sub being "viraat hindu", "proud of culture" and all is OKAY, but what bothers me is that sometimes you guys take pride/idolize people who act like complete REBELS. Like easy example is Kangana Ranaut. You think she is a "virat Hindu" ? NOOOO. She is just yet another anti-bollywood person. That\'s not bad. But she literally changes her stance based on bollywood. Bollywood supports Rhea, she is against Rhea. Bollywood against XYZ, she supports XYZ.\n\nNext day if bollywood says "Hindu culture is great" she will make tweets like "Stupid bollywood supporting degenerate Hindu culture" and you all will start trending #BoycottKangana and then other group of ppl will be like #IAmWithKangana and shit. Now all my statements may appear baseless but it is just to reinforce the fact that choosing online Trolls like celebrities and so called "History Rewriters" and "Stand-up Comedians" as "protectors of Hinduism" while ignoring the likes of Vivekananda, Sringeri, etc is just really ignorant of you.'<br />Author: 'No-Suggestion-9504'<br />id: 'k72jpo'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li>

<li>Title: 'How can art help to revive Sanaatan Sanskriti'<br />Body: "I remember during college, despite always being right-leaning, I loved watching TV show Jodha Akbar and when I visited Agra fort during vacation, I was (guilty face) feeling elated that I was standing in Akbar's room. This happened when I knew about the atrocities of Aurangzeb, Taimur, Changez Khan (While watching TV show, my father asked me once if Akbar was such a great monarch, why did he organize Meena Bazaar every year?) but I was fooled by History books and the great Indian Saneema and TV. Now I think, when a person with a Sanatan upbringing can be misguided by books, movies, TV shows, music, games then why can't we use the same means to make inferior complexed youth realise the glory of our ancient heritage? And no, we can't expect everything to happen by itself. Foreign powers have invested decades, millions of money to subliminally condition the minds of Indians. Here are some pieces of art which can help your liberal gf/bf/daughter/son to view the glimpse of our culture. Please feel free to add more to the list:\n\n1. Upnishad Ganga: If you could see just one series in your lifetime, make it this one. Such a beautiful episodic journey full of gems from our shastras.\n\n2. Ramayan: It is incomparable. There's a sanctity in the first television adaptation of Sri Ramayan Ji which could not be found in later adaptations.\n\n3. Chanakya: This series is really crucial if you are in your early twenties as it'll help you to understand many life lessons.\n\n4. Ram Ki Shakti Pooja by Suryakant Tripathi Nirala: \n\n5. Pushp Ki Abhilasha by Maithili Sharan Gupt\n\n6. SL Bhyrappa: I've read only recently about him and looking forward to read his books.\n\nPlease mention in the comments the artists who present Sanaatan in their true glory.

Answer me while putting yourself in the shoes of a head of a 4-5 member family who is unable to put adequate food on the table. If bowing in front of one statue instead of the other feeds you and your family, won’t you go for it? We are trying very hard to stop religious conversions and doing ghar-wapsi and stuff.

They wanted to thwart it. this protests is message to modi back down or we will come after you heavily.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has happened so many times i wonder why modi and shah back down every time. Pappu is legitimately identified as scamster in national herald case. all links points delhi high court is compromised and saves pappu and sonia every time. Look at current cases. why Bollywood prefer delhi high court over mumbai high court ? why judge who was supposed to rotate from delhi high court every six months was able to attain same high court seat for 14 effin years. Delhi high court gives judgements after judgements in support of anti national elements and saves congress members every effin time. be it chidambram who  got bail for 80+ times or pappu they are saved by delhi high court.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter investigating all of this i was able to find links between delhi high court judges and open society foundation members(george soros organization). I even sent to this to an online publication but they denied to publish this as they suspect court will file contempt notice to them. I gave them how those judges sons or nieces gets scholarships from Open society foundation and how regularly judges went to OSF functions and happy to talk about anti india elements. there was one photo were judges wife was with all OSF member with anti india brigagde but they took it down from twitter so many times. here is that image : [https://imgur.com/a/vGVJFrR](https://imgur.com/a/vGVJFrR). twitter tried to remove this so many times but someone uploads it. OSF have a huge army of social media bots that they frequently use to take down anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically we are dealing with corrupt judiciary helping old friends to bring down modi. Modi and shah finds so much evidence against them but are not able to do anything because these guys are keep coming with protest card. I think its time to take a stand and not bow down everytime. in the name of farmers what we are seeing will be everytime as they know that this govt backdowns against protests."<br />Author: 'hd-86'<br />id: 'k5t3tz'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

Modi has elevated cronyism to party ideology, as he dismantles the country one brick at a time. Donald Trump was thrown out of a second term, despite all his rigging, and I credit the robust American media, which did not cave in to his threats and litigations, and remained, in the main, a powerful check on his excesses and falsehoods. By buying up India's mediahouses (esp through two of modern India's most powerful business firms, the two Monsantos of India, Ambani and Adani) and settling cronies at strategic posts in the judiciary and upper executive (gubernatorial positions), Modi has ensured that all resistance has to be at the grassroots level where he can then bring down the whole battery of law in a crushing display of overreach.

It will include trade at  \n\nany place like the farm gate, (processing) factory premises, warehouses, cold-storages \n\netc. or any online market platform \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt; No market fee/cess/levy, or any other charge, shall be levied on any farmer/trader in physical mandi or electronic trading platform for trade/commerce happening outside the state APMC mandi  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;The trader should make payment to the farmer on the same day of the transaction \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;Separate dispute resolution mechanism where the farmer or the trader may seek conciliation from a Conciliation Board appointed bybSub-Divisional Magistrate \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n▪️IMPACT: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;Will help in the creation of “one nation one market” by directly connecting farmers with  buyers without any intermediary  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt; Will reduce wastage, increase efficiency and will unlock value for our farmers and help  in increasing their income \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;Will result in timely payment to farmers and will reduce exploitation of farmers \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;Since, outside the APMC mandi trade, will not have any tax by States, it will result in  \n\ncompetition for State APMC Mandis and will force them to improve \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt; As there will not be any tax outside the APMC mandi, it will result in cheaper agri- \n\nproducts for the consumer without reducing the prices for the farmers \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt; As there will be more private mandis, it will result in better prices for farmers due to  \n\nincreased competition \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt; Opening of private mandis will result in more business opportunities for the Commission agents (arathiyas) and other stakeholders (who already have experience of  \n\nAgri trade) where they can venture out to offer additional services that can be useful to  \n\nlocal farmers like seed/soil testing facilities, sorting/grading facilities, warehousing,  \n\ncold storage and processing facilities and hence job creation.\n\n \n\n\\&gt; Timely settlement of disputes'<br />Author: 'roomba_boss64'<br />id: 'k5r1v5'<br />Flair :Bakchod News :news:</li>

<li>Title: 'Farmer Protests - Did some personal research'<br />Body: 'Having family and friends in Punjab, and farmer cousins in UP. I asked them what their thoughts are on the whole farm bills issue. Here is what I learnt. \n\n\n1. This will be bad for small farmers as they are getting rid of MSP. The government’s rational to go forward with this is that the farmers will get a higher pay for their output, but it not guaranteeing MSP is an issue. \n\n\n2. Right now the farmer has the MSP guarantee so he knows how much his inputs will cost and how much his output would be worth. Not having MSP is an issue there. They are afraid the Adani/Ambani will negotiate for lower rate. \n\n\n3. Quality of produce is not considered at Mandis. Farmer can give sub standard product and it gets purchased by PDS system. This would no longer fly with the private sector. This is concerning for everyone and really shitty on behalf of the farmers, but then, no farmer wants to purposely produce bad crop, things happen. What would the farmer do in such a scenario? Suicides will rise.  \n\n\n4. Restrictions on land holding from previous governments from decades ago - no farmer could own more than 17 acres, and as families grew and split, the land size became smaller and smaller. - so the small farmer who can barely automate his farm, how could he compete with the bigger guys? They still need the consolidators who can take their crop to the Mandi and sell on their behalf. \n\n\n5. Finally, TIMING: being in the midst of a pandemic, is it really necessary to piss of such a large section of our population, and one that has been given so much honor and respect in the past?\n\n\n\nWhile personally, I am always supportive of change and progress from old traditions of doing business. This time, I am against these new rules, not just because of the weird timing, but also because it will only alienate an already hurting population.\n\n\nWe need reforms, but they need to be thought about more from POV of all stakeholders not just the corporates. \n\n\nThis is my analysis. I am sure not everyone here would be on the same side as me. We love Modi, but when he is wrong, we need to call out on that. Not every thing a government does is good when your person is in power. \n\n\nPS. Fuck this Khalistanis and Pakistanis who are just there for their own ulterior motives. \n\n\nRemember, many of these farmers have their kids proudly serving in the armed forces. So generalizing them all as Khalistanis is VERY WRONG.'<br />Author: 'chidsak'<br />id: 'k5mcf0'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li>

The country is being run under a dictatorship- from demonetisation, to the sudden lockdown, and now the farmers bill- there is just no logic, rational or justification- Modi is just being used as a puppet by the oligarchs and mega rich. Privatisation is now occurring in many sectors, including food as a result of this farmers bill. The mega rich continue to find more ways to make money and exploit the people.\n\nSince partition, generations have been fantasising and dreaming of a life abroad. I suspect that today, in 2020, the numbers of people with such ambitions is at its highest ever. With the basic inalienable right to peacefully protest even being denied, it is no wonder. Gandhi must be wondering what went wrong.\n\nSo over to you. The world is watching.

<li>Title: 'The reason why farmers are protesting (no political opinion or biasness).'<br />Body: 'Someone asked to explain why farmers are protesting, so I have tried to explain it here.\n\nWhat the ammended APMC act effectively does is that it frees farmers from selling their produce to APMC mandis alone as it allows private players to participate in that process. Now for the reason of the protest, the reason they are citing is that once these bills take over, market might yield better income for farmers initially ( due to involvement of lot of private companies competing to buy the goods from farmers rather than a single entity in an area aka APMC mandi and it\'s middleman monopolising the entire market) and due to which farmers won\'t have to sell their yields to fci at msp as they must be getting good prices from the market itself but THEIR ARGUMENT IS THAT ONCE THE MSP FADES AWAY (AS SEEING THAT NO ONE IS GETTING THEIR PRODUCE TO FCI, GOVERNMENT MIGHT NOT OFFER MSP AS THERE WILL BE NO NEED FOR IT), THEN THE PRIVATE PLAYERS WILL START DOING WHAT APMC DOES AND THEN THEIR WILL BE NO MSP TO SAVE FARMERS. SO THEY WANT ASSURANCE THAT MSP STAYS NO MATTER WHAT. THEY WANT WRITTEN ASSURANCE IN THE ACT ITSELF THAT GOVT WILL OFFER MSP IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT HAPPENS. but the funny thing is that there was no legal backing for msp even before these acts with exception to sugarcane (under essential commodities act guaranteeing the fair and remunerative price for it every year). BUT in my opinion ( I am no expert in economics), it\'s not that easy to monopolise a free flowing market given that agriculture products are needed by a lot of companies ( pickle, chips, ketchup, jam, and whatnot). So it\'s totally baseless to criticize an act on the ground that may very well never happen and on that note there is no end to "what aboutery" and every act and every policy of the govt can be paralysed by this sort of argument.\n\nNow comes the real reason that they are not citing, they don\'t want their crutches to be removed as they are happy with APMC and msp system with most of big farmers in haryana and punjab already having an understanding with the middlemen and middlemen themselves are acting like farmers in these protests as their entire dirty business will be dismantled. This is the very reason no farmer is protesting outside these two states. \nIf any correction, feel free to point it out.

<li>Title: 'Justine Trudeau &amp; his advisor’s incompetence to process India’s Agriculture Bills.'<br />Body: " As an Indian born Canadian citizen, I am in an utter disbelief in regards to how current government of Canada has responded to India’s Agriculture Bills -- which are nothing short of a **CALCULATED MASTERMOVE! -- The agriculture bill not the PM Trudeau's response.**\n\nIn 2019, **10,281 suicides** were reported from the farming sector by National Crime Records Bureau of India. That on average is **28 suicides per day** or at least one suicide/per hour. If this statistic does not call for an immediate **change in India’s farming sector** then I don’t know what else does.\n\nCanada’s ill-informed prime minister and some news agencies were very quick to address and take sides but, a simple search of the agriculture reform bills of India tells a story that a no democratic nation should object against. Unless of course, there is an agenda that Canadian citizens are unaware of that prime minister is advocating on their behalf.\n\nIn two days, at a cost of researching from home, and about two large double-double coffees from Tim Hortons, I have concluded the following,\n\n1. Prime Minister Justine Trudeau &amp; his advisors are ill-informed.\n2. Prime Minister Justine Trudeau &amp; his advisors are incompetent at analyzing bills that empowers India’s farmers.\n3. Prime Minister not only is quick to condemn actions, but **often** when being proven wrong–staying silent instead of correcting one’s mistakes is the choice this elected leader makes.\n4. The focus is on the agriculture reforms happening in India, not on black face or financially colluded WE charity practices supported by Prime Minister. So, for the purpose of this post, racial and financial incidents related to the Prime Minister are purposefully ignored.\n\nThere are three agriculture bills that need to be summarized here so I have compiled my findings from all three and have concluded them below in a point form,\n\n1st reform bill/act \\[Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce Act 2020\\]\n\n* The act gives farmers freedom of **choice of sale** and purchase of agriculture produce. \\[Prior this was only done through a committee called APMC - Agricultural Produce Market Committee.\\]\n* It will promote barrier free trade within and outside of the states. \\[Prior farmers were required to sell their produce through only APMC designated market areas and **NOTHING ELSE**.\\]\n* Farmer no longer to be charged any cess or levy for the sale of their produce. \\[No longer need to bear transportation cost as purchaser is required to arrange their appropriate transportation for the amount of produce/crops they are purchasing.\\]\n* India to move all the trades and transactions to digital platform knows as E-NAM (National Agriculture Market) - - The digital platform E-NAM will also function for previously ran practices under APMC. \\[**It is for all, not just for a selective group.**\\]\n* Freedom to trade at farmgate, cold storage, warehouse &amp; processing units…**it is a FARMER’s choice**.\n* **No more middlemen** required for a farmer to sell their crops. \\[Can you imagine the opposite of such that was in place? And such is the side PM of Canada has chosen to support. Hang in there…\\]\n* Some agitated and ill-informed farmers have requested that Minimum Support Price (MSP) to exist – The government has clearly stated that if a farmer wishes to sell through the same practice that has been in place prior, so be it. **To each their own.**\n\n2nd reform bill/act \\[Contract farming\\]\n\n* Farmers can now interact directly with processors, wholesalers, aggregators, large retailers, exporters, etc. **No longer farmers have the only option to sell at only APMC**. Freedom?\n* Government assures price assurances to the farmers before they sow the crops. Under any circumstances the farmers are entitled to the minimum price. If at such point in time, market price is high, well **farmers should reap the benefits! NOT THE MIDDLEMEN.**\n* Reduces risks taken by farmers in India as contracts are signed digitally leaving a clear demands agreed upon by both sides.\n* Farmers to be shielded by unpredictable rise and fall of market prices.\n* This act also enables farmers to have access to modern technologies, better seed and other tools.\n* Reduces middlemen costs will improve income of farmers.\n* Introduced a dispute resolution mechanism that can help settle disputes. No need to repeatedly go to a court over a dispute. A local dispute redressal mechanism to help.\n* Impetus to research and new technology in agriculture sector.\n* Under this bill, a farmer will have complete control in a contract to fix sale price of his/her choice for the crops they are growing.\n* Expedited payments within 3 days! **\\[Heck, how long before your cheque gets processed here?\\]**\n* Over 10,000 Farmer Producer Organizations being created to bring together small farmers and to ensure **remunerative** pricing for farm produce.\n* Upon using the digital platform, once a contract is signed, the purchasing consumer will pick up the produce directly from the farm.\n\n3rd reform bill/act \\[The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020\\]\n\n* Removes commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes from list of essential commodities.  \n\n   * \\[Prior there was a restriction as to how much a purchaser can buy when it comes to above listed items. This resulted in waste of crops, often resulted in associated costs that had forced farmers to look towards growing something else. The point is, until you grow at mass scale, you cannot reduce your prices. Once you do, not only the nation but trading partners can enjoy the benefits too!\\]\n* This act also removes fears of private investors enforcing excessive regulatory rules on farmers and farmer’s day to day operations.\n* The free and fair market practice will allow for modernization of cold storage and food storage facilities.  \n\n   * India currently loses about 35%-40% of crops due to lack of appropriate storage facilities. This cost is directly on farmers. This loss to farmers is 35,000 crore or **$6,167,400,881.06 Canadian at current exchange rate of 56.75 Rupees.**\n* Government also indicates that during time of war or natural calamity when prices tend to rise, the consumers are also protected with their investment. **Ensuring fair trade for both sides.**\n* Doubling farmer’s income by 2022. Currently they make about **$2/hour** (in a best-case scenario.)\n* Government will aim to create markets where farmers can sell their crops not only digitally but physically **every 80km!**\n\nThe noise over the internet -- farmers and their fight for MSP,\n\nLets start with statistical data so that we are not just fighting with words.\n\nIn India, two committees were formed to study the harsh realities imposed on poor farmers,\n\n1. M S Swaminathan Committee in 2006\n2. Santha Kumar Committee in 2015\n\n* Findings from both these committees concluded that the laws that help farmers have been passed in early 2000s but **NOT IMPLEMENTED!** even in 2015!  \n\n   * I urge you to look into their statistics and then urge you to look into Prime Minister Justine Trudeau’s response.\n* 86% of farmers in India are small/medium farmers and remaining 14% are medium/large/mega farmers. Only the 14% are getting the advantage of MSP laws set out in early 2000s. **Would you believe me now if I were to say that our Prime Minister is supporting the rich of the India but not the poor? Does it remind you of the troubles of Justine Trudeau’s India visit?**\n* What makes it worse is that over 75% of paddy growers and over 65% of wheat growers didn’t even know that there was such plan where a government can help them! **When they are not aware of MSP, how do you expect them to get the right price?**\n* Only **1/6** of India’s total rice and wheat output is bought by the government. The remainder…..\n\nSuch is my finding on the agriculture reform bills that Indian government introduced. Instead of bashing such moves, a progressive country such as Canada should applaud the way Indian government is trying to uplift its farmers earning less than $24/day and committing 1 suicide/hour in India.\n\nI totally understand if Prime Minister and his advisors are incapable of processing such simple bills but, making mockery of a country that is trying to uplift its most suppressed citizens is **inhumane**. If this is what current government of Canada is saying about a foreign country and its policies, wonder what their opinions of Canadian farmers are. **Even a rotten apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.**\n\nStay at it Prime Minister Modi &amp; India.

<li>Title: "Farmers' Protests or anti-Sikh riots in the making?"<br />Body: "If you have observed the general public sentiments on social media lately, you will notice that the Left is actively pushing the narrative to Hindus against Sikhs, making the Sikh community in India feel insecure. Similar instances were observed during the anti-CAA protests in which the Left caused a mass hysteria by spreading misinformation about the act, gaslighting the minorities, which ultimately lead to riots in Delhi.\n\nThe Farmers' Bill is going to affect all farmers in India then why are we seeing only the Sikhs protesting in the media? It really makes one wonder about the Left's actual intentions. For those who are totally oblivious to how this evil nexus of anarchists operate, this isn't about any bill. This is a sinister conspiracy to pit the Indic faiths against each other. Bleed India by a thousand cuts. Every faction against the other battling out until only a balkanized India remains.\n\nIslamists and foreign powers were deeply involved in the CAA protests, from spreading misinformation to doing intifada in Shaheen Bagh to violence in North East Delhi to coverup. If one thinks this was spontaneous then he/she is deluded at best. Khalistani outfits have vested interests in these farmers' protests and their involvement is evident to all. This wouldn't be the first time Sikh separatists and Islamists are working together.  Bhindranwala was backed by Pakistan's ISI in 1984.\n\nThink about it."<br />Author: 'DontBeCucked'<br />id: 'k4m95u'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li>
