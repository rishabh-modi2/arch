<li>Title: 'A sincere request to r/Chodi and the brigading force from r/India and other Indian verse subreddit'<br />Body: "To all the bhratas and their bhaginis, the brigading force from Indian verse subreddits, \n\nOur respectable Prime Minister **Narendra Damodardas Modi JI** has ***requested***(civil disobedience doesn't apply here dumbass) the citizens to turn off their lights (just lights specifically) at 9 pm for 9 minutes and to light either diyas, candles, flashlight(not fleshlight) or torch as a symbol that we a country of 1.3 billion stands together in this dark time of COVID-19. \n\n***SENSIBLE*** People who are criticizing this request are putting forth mainly two points as I have seen please correct me in comments if I am wrong.\n\n1) Modi Ji should be discussing PPE kits, status on testing and abuse on doctors rather than this. I totally agree with this but there is a specific ministry, particularly for this i.e. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and they are regularly holding a press conference headed by joint secretary Lav Agarwal @ [https://www.youtube.com/user/pibindia/videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/pibindia/videos). The information is literally a click away. Personally I think Modi Ji should have mentioned the abuse on doctors.\n\n2) A Blackout Possibility. About this Ministry of Power has released a statement and advisory that they will be able to handle it([https://pib.gov.in/newsite/pmreleases.aspx?mincode=52](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/pmreleases.aspx?mincode=52)). But the criticism is also valid because we have seen a blackout in 2012(unrelated but still). We should not underestimate it and there is a worst-case scenario.\n\nEveryone has their own opinions on whether to do this or not and I respect that. ***The request I want to make is that please don't pray that our country sees the worst-case scenario today.*** Taali/Thaali bajao was a highly successful event except for some dumbfucks who came on the roads but people from the richest to the poorest had that smile that we are in this together and we will fight it. \n\nThis request is coming from an incident where my friend who is a proper Anti-Modi literally prayed while we were on a conference call that worst-case should happen. Whatever fraction you belong to please don't pray or wish this, Indian lives will be lost from this and we have already lost 104 lives and 3332 are still fighting. I still back this idea because lives are tough right now and unity gives us the strength to fight. \n\nThank You, Please Stay Home and Stay Safe.\n\nJai Hind."<br />Author: 'UselessSadistic'<br />id: 'fvaipu'<br />Flair :Rant</li>

I want to do it too. I am sick and tired of my current job.'<br />Body: 'Before you dumb triggered people think I am being sarcastic and start attacking me by calling me mullah/librandu; let me just give you a brief introduction of myself to you. \n\nTill the age of five I believed in Lord Shiva. Then became a cynical, nihilistic atheist as I grew older and read science. Till the age of.....I guess 14-15, really hated Muslims and thought all Muslims were terrorists. But ever since modi came to power and all the shit broke loose ( mob lynching, hate crime, asifa case, hate speech, demonetization, rise in corruption) I started going from seeing all Muslims as terrorists to seeing them as humble, poor, innocent victims. I was like, " Hey! Right wingers are so evil. Why are they targeting Muslims? Surely not all Muslims are bad. " I began sympathizing with mob lynching and rape victims (asifa) and started leaning more and more towards AAP like parties. It should be noted that before modi I actually hated Muslims. Only after modi, I started feeling sorry for Muslims. \n\nRecently an actress had said that BJP politicians are hypocrites for viewing porn in Parliament themselves but asking others to watch ramayan. And all you bhakts started accusing her of comparing ramayan to porn. Like seriously.... Wtf... Lol. Whatever. Because of this corona virus shit now that Muslims are showing their true colors, the dormant hatred for Muslims inside me has started to get awakened again. \n\nI am going through such a dilemma. Accepting that I hate Muslims would mean accepting defeat in front of bhakts like you. All these years I fought you with my moral authority, code of conduct and this holier than thou attitude. All that would go to waste. I never really identified with liberals, feminists and shit. I always saw myself as somebody who is above all( both leftists and righties). I hated feminists/liberals just as much as I hated fake and evil dhongi bhakts who in the name of religion spread so much bullshit. I am still gonna have that sense of moral superiority over you. That my hatred is pure. Where as yours comes with a pricetag. You do it for money.

I‚Äôm not sure if i had read this somewhere in an article online or on a sub where someone had posted it. I was looking for the post where, in case, it had been posted but couldn‚Äôt find it and thought i‚Äôd post it here if anyone is interested or like me, has been trying to find this. This is not mine and i do not take any credit for it. What i do know is that this study was done by an American researcher. I have no knowledge about this so please do enlighten me incase you know anything about this. It‚Äôs an interesting read.\n\n\n\nWhen the Muslim population remains under 2% in a country, they will be seen primarily as a peace-loving minority and not as a threat to other citizens. This is the current situation in:\n\nUnited States ‚Äî Muslim 0.6%\n\nAustralia ‚Äî Muslim 1.5%\n\nCanada ‚Äî Muslim 1.9%\n\nChina ‚Äî Muslim 1.8%\n\nItaly ‚Äî Muslim 1.5%\n\nNorway ‚Äî Muslim 1.8%\n\nAs the Muslim population reaches 2% to 5%, they begin to recruit from ethnic minorities and disaffected groups, within prisons and street gangs. This is happening in:\n\nDenmark ‚Äî Muslim 2%\n\nGermany ‚Äî Muslim 3.7%\n\nUnited Kingdom ‚Äî Muslim 2.7%\n\nSpain ‚Äî Muslim 4%\n\nThailand ‚Äî Muslim 4.6%\n\n‚ÄúFrom 5% on, they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population,‚Äù Dr. Hammond notes. ‚ÄúFor example, they will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic standards) food‚Äù and increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature such food on their shelves ‚Äî along with threats for failure to comply. This is happening in:\n\nFrance ‚Äî Muslim 8%\n\nPhilippines ‚Äî 5%\n\nSweden ‚Äî Muslim 5%\n\nSwitzerland ‚Äî Muslim 4.3%\n\nThe Netherlands ‚Äî Muslim 5.5%\n\nTrinidad &amp; Tobago ‚Äî Muslim 5.8%\n\nSoon they begin to apply pressure to allow Sharia law within their own communities (sometimes ghettos).\n\n‚ÄúWhen Muslims approach 10% of the population, they tend to increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions,‚Äù Dr. Hammond notes. ‚ÄúIn Paris, we are already seeing car-burnings. Any non-Muslim action offends Islam, and results in uprisings and threats, such as in Amsterdam, with opposition to Mohammed cartoons and films about Islam.‚Äù These tensions are seen on a regular basis in:\n\nGuyana ‚Äî Muslim 10%\n\nIndia ‚Äî Muslim 13.4%\n\nIsrael ‚Äî Muslim 16%\n\nKenya ‚Äî Muslim 10%\n\nRussia ‚Äî Muslim 15%\n\nThe violence increases when the Muslim population reaches 20%. ‚ÄúAfter reaching 20%, nations can expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations, sporadic killings, and the burnings of Christian churches and Jewish synagogues,‚Äù such as in:\n\nEthiopia ‚Äî Muslim 32.8%\n\nAt 40%, nations experience widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks, and ongoing militia warfare,‚Äù such as in:\n\nBosnia ‚Äî Muslim 40%\n\nChad ‚Äî Muslim 53.1%\n\nLebanon ‚Äî Muslim 59.7%\n\nFrom 60%, persecution of non-believing ‚Äúinfidels‚Äù rises significantly, including sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia law as a weapon, and Jizya, a tax placed on infidels, such as in:\n\nAlbania ‚Äî Muslim 70%\n\nMalaysia ‚Äî Muslim 60.4%\n\nQatar ‚Äî Muslim 77.5%\n\nSudan ‚Äî Muslim 70%\n\nAfter 80%, expect daily intimidation and violent jihad, some State-run ethnic cleansing, and even some genocide, as these nations drive out ‚Äúinfidels,‚Äù and move toward a 100% Muslim society, which has been experienced to some degree in:\n\nBangladesh ‚Äî Muslim 83%\n\nEgypt ‚Äî Muslim 90%\n\nGaza ‚Äî Muslim 98.7%\n\nIndonesia ‚Äî Muslim 86.1%\n\nIran ‚Äî Muslim 98%\n\nIraq ‚Äî Muslim 97%\n\nJordan ‚Äî Muslim 92%\n\nMorocco ‚Äî Muslim 98.7%\n\nPakistan ‚Äî Muslim 97%\n\nPalestine ‚Äî Muslim 99%\n\nSyria ‚Äî Muslim 90%\n\nTajikistan ‚Äî Muslim 90%\n\nTurkey ‚Äî Muslim 99.8%\n\nUnited Arab Emirates ‚Äî Muslim 96%\n\nA 100% Muslim society will theoretically usher in their version of peace ‚Äî the peace of ‚ÄòDar-es-Salaam‚Äô ‚Äî the Islamic House of Peace. ‚ÄúHere there‚Äôs supposed to be peace, because everybody is a Muslim, the Madrassas are the only schools, and the Koran is the only word,‚Äù such as in:\n\nAfghanistan ‚Äî Muslim 100%\n\nSaudi Arabia ‚Äî Muslim 100%\n\nSomalia ‚Äî Muslim 100%\n\nYemen ‚Äî Muslim 100%\n\n‚ÄúUnfortunately, peace is never achieved, as in these 100% states the most radical Muslims intimidate and spew hatred &amp; satisfy their blood lust by killing less radical Muslims, for a variety of reasons.‚Äù'<br />Author: 'thatlankyfellow'<br />id: 'fv08ib'<br />Flair :Research</li>

<li>Title: 'Obsession with Pakistan.'<br />Body: "For a long period of time I have been feeling that we Indians are getting over obsessed with tention with Pakistan. I am not downplaying the threat that Pakistan is to India, but we are seriously ignoring a much severe threat that is expanding ambitions of China. We all know Pakistan is nothing compared to India, in all fields, sports, arms and armies, economy, growth, intellect, etc. but to feel supirior we always focus on Pakistan, and China is using our obsession, they are building belt &amp; road initiative, strings of pearls, etc. to strip India of the control and power that we still have in the region. China has infiltrated our markets to deep extent (how many of you are reading this on a chinese phone?). They are not only becoming more powerful but also stripping India of it's existing power. And we are not even aware of it. We are constantly comparing ourselves with Pakistan (even in the time of this pandemic crisis), but why? To feel supirior. China is much more powerful than us in economics and world influence (no offense), and slowly we are even loosing our current influence. In some recent years influence of India has surely increased, but still we have a long way to go. For every news channels, youtubers, media outlets they publish almost 20 sources which bashed Pakistan to one against China. Seriously we need to take china seriously or else we will become just another nation on the globe. Even USA which is arguably most influential nation in world is taking China seriously, but we, who share a boundary with China are not. We all know the expanding ambitions that china has, it did invade Tibet and destroyes their culture and their people. I have complete faith in our Indian armed forces but still if we continue to ignore China, we will loose Arunachal Pradesh to them(China claims Arunachal as South Tibet and has ambitions to invade it just like Tibet). China invaded Tibet when China was not even a super power, and still world didn't retaliated, what makes you think that the world whould now retaliate now given now China is indeed a super power. There is a serious need for us to realise the real threat is to the sovereignty of India. We lost Aksai Chin and no one came to help india, but we still are obsessed with POK. If there was no China threat, POK can be taken back within a weak( I know Pakistan has nukes, but still we have defence mechanisms and mostly our intelligence knows the location of these nukes in Pakistan, we can quickly neutralize them. Pakistan doesn't have nuclear submarines or aircraft carriers. They only have stationary nukes, which can be dealt with). The only threat that India has while attacking POK is China, as we cannot handle both Pakistan and China simultaneously. Our aim should be either to weaken China or form good relations with them(like USA-Canada), so that if we try to fight Pakistan,  China should not intervene. What do you think is greater threat to India's sovereignty, Pakistan or China?"<br />Author: 'dev_me1'<br />id: 'fujnkh'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li>

With hushed steps, he came inside. After a clamorous while, he came inside. \n\nHe is damp in sweat as he gets up to heedlessly step on a flower. He puts on his sherwani back while looking at the flower he just mangled beneath his feet. As he closes the door to leave the room, he\'s startled by presence of his mantri. \n\n"Zenaab ye halla kyun ho rha tha", Mantri asks in a voice with a high pitch and muddled with  bemusement on account of Shah Jahan\'s face soaked with perspiration and former uproar in Jahanara\'s royal room. He looks at his mantri with eyes wide open, still and unsettled. His pupils are about dilate with shame when he turns around and walks away, ignoring mantri\'s existence. \n\nAt this precise moment, mantri is mystified when his inner voice thinks out loud, "Waah! zenaab toh betichod nikle."'<br />Author: 'Aurghmhulane'<br />id: 'fudg01'<br />Flair :Shitpost</li>
<li>Title: 'Watching Ramayana has made me realized a very important thing'<br />Body: "Half of the words we think of as Hindi are bastardization of Persian/Arabic words, and are essentially Urdu. I have no reason to hate Urdu, but pure Hindi, in the way the characters in Ramayana speak is such pleasant to listen to. It so pure, full of respect and love, and it clearly deserves more place in our everyday vocab. \n\nMost of the songs that are used in Bollywood movies are 60% Urdu, I wonder what's the reason. I don't remember the last time I watched a Bollywood movie with a overtly Hindu setting, Telegu movies do this all the time. Except Agneepath's Deva Sree Ganesha, I can't recall a devotional song in a big budget movie. Man it really sucks when our own people do not appreciate the beauty in our own heritage and culture. Wish things change soon.\n\nThis was more of a rant rather than a constructive post I think, and I am curious to what other people think. \n\nAgain a massive shout-out to Telugu bros for keeping the culture strong. [This fight scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5Z3ie4hK6k) in front of the temple is one of my favs. I watch almost every Telugu movie that gets dubbed into Hindi and uploaded to Youtube.

<li>Title: 'In defence of ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä RƒÅma‚ÄïThe ‡§Æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§¶‡§æ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å‡§∑‡•ã‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§Æ'<br />Body: 'Today marks RƒÅmanavamƒ´, Lord RƒÅm\'s birthday. The same Lord RƒÅma who, on the one hand, is upheld as the very embodiment of justice and righteousness by Hindus (especially Vaishnav\'s) and yet, is reviled as a misogynist and a "custodian of patriarchy" by the dominant Marxist intelligentsia on the other. Who exactly is right, then???\n\nIn Vaishnava theology, the all pervading Godhead, *NarƒÅyana* which encompasses everything and yet is beyond is said to take birth from time to time amongst various sentient beings as an act of *LilƒÅ* ‚ÄîDivine Play. As a part of this divine play, the Lord sets aside His "glory" and "forgets" Himself upon entering this world. He is then limited and conditioned by the same three *gunƒÅs* of our world‚ÄîSattva (mode of purity, calmness), Rajas (mode of passion, activity) and Tamas (mode of ignorance, lethargy).\n\nIn the Scion of IkshvƒÅk≈´, we see the very embodiment of one of these gunƒÅs, Sattva. RƒÅma is NarƒÅyana incarnate, but He doesn\'t *know*; and frankly, couldn\'t care less. He has not a moment\'s hesitation before giving up the entire kingdom despite being raised His entire life believing that He would be it\'s rightful inheritor. Indeed, RƒÅma proceeds to take the blessings of the very "mother" who had separated Him from His father before leaving for His exile. Because in RƒÅm\'s worldview, there is no place for hatred or revenge, especially not towards his elders, howsoever wrong they may be.\n\nRƒÅma takes no time to adjust to the simple life of the forests because he has always been a renunciate, totally detached from worldly pleasures. He refuses the advances of S≈´rpanakhƒÅ in the guise of a beautiful woman despite her subtle taunts about His masculinity and it being in vogue for men (especially royal ones) to have multiple wives. For RƒÅma, masculinity is not about having multiple wives with unending sexual virility, but doing the right thing without expectations for fame and glory. For RƒÅma (who otherwise is an ocean of compassion and love), there is but one space in his heart when it comes to love of the romantic kind, and it has already been occupied by JƒÅnakƒ´.\n\nAfter the SitƒÅ Haran, we get to see RƒÅma in his full glory‚Äîhuman as well as divine. We feel His *vyƒÅkultƒÅ* while searching for Bh≈´mƒ´ S≈´tƒÅ. We see the Prince of Ayodhya willing to ask help from anybody and everybody who can help Him be united with His *ardhangini*. And yet, we also see RƒÅma not wavering from His DharmƒÅ, even in these testing times. We see Him being steadfast and *sanyamit* even when S≈´griva forgets his promise of helping Him find SitƒÅ. We see Him eating the j≈´than of Shabrƒ´ with elation, as if He has never eaten a more delicious meal in His life. For RƒÅma, *karunƒÅ* and *dharma* are second nature. It\'s not a fa√ßade put on to gain "popularity". It\'s ingrained in His very *core*. There is no RƒÅma without *karunƒÅ* and *dharmƒÅ*.\n\nFor RamƒÅ, DharmƒÅ is *sarvoparƒ´* and people could take all His credit for it\'s upholding whilst simultaneously casting aspersions on His character, and He wouldn\'t care one bit. As long as DharmƒÅ is being upheld, our RƒÅma would gracefully accept all the criticisms hurled at Him.\n\nSuch is *SiyƒÅvar* RƒÅma. Such is our MaryƒÅdƒÅ Pur≈´shottamüôèüèª.'<br />Author: 'TerryMcGinnis1999'<br />id: 'ftl71d'<br />Flair :Research</li>

<li>Title: "Telegraph Article about China's Reckoning (We must treat China like a hostile state)"<br />Body: "Link: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/04/01/coronavirus-means-must-now-treat-china-like-hostile-state/\n\n(Full text here because it's paid site)\n\nWhen the Government says that there needs to be a ‚Äúreckoning‚Äù with China once the coronavirus emergency is over, its focus must be much broader than simply examining Beijing‚Äôs culpability in creating the pandemic.\n\nThe deliberate lack of transparency and cooperation that has characterised the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs (CCP) response to the outbreak since the virus was first identified in Wuhan constitutes nothing less than a fundamental breach of trust between China and the rest of the world.\n\nDespite Beijing‚Äôs attempts to cover up the true scale of the outbreak in China, British scientists are now warning Downing Street that the CCP has probably downplayed the number of cases by a factor of 15 to 40.\n\nTo make matters worse, Beijing has compounded its reprehensible behaviour by launching a disinformation campaign that seeks to portray China as the victim, rather than being the instigator of a global health crisis that has so far claimed almost 40,000 lives worldwide, and caused the greatest slump in global economic activity since the Second World War.\n\nChina‚Äôs attempts to blame the initial outbreak on an American military delegation that visited Wuhan last October have received short shrift in Washington, while British ministers have privately expressed their disgust at Beijing‚Äôs attempts to exploit the pandemic for economic gain with what they call ‚Äúpredatory‚Äù offers of help for affected countries.\n\nNor, as Beijing declares ‚Äúvictory‚Äù in its own campaign against the virus, is there any evidence that China has learnt its lesson. The reopening of live animal markets, where bats and scorpions are offered as traditional medicine, suggests China‚Äôs rulers have no intention of fulfilling their pledge to close the markets, which is where the virus is believed to have originated.\n\nAt every level, the CCP‚Äôs response to the coronavirus challenge has been contemptible, to the extent that, once the present crisis is over, there needs to be a radical rethink in Britain and other Western countries about our future dealings with Beijing.\n\nCertainly, the idea that it will be business as normal so far as our trade ties with Beijing are concerned will be totally unacceptable to the vast majority of the British public.\n\nThere is a deepening resentment among ordinary citizens that China is ultimately to blame for the disruption the pandemic has inflicted on their daily lives, for causing the greatest assault on their personal freedoms in peacetime, for millions of workers losing their jobs or taking pay cuts, and for victims of the coronavirus ending their days alone and isolated from their loved ones.\n\nChina‚Äôs appalling conduct from the outset has led ministers to warn that the country risks becoming a ‚Äúpariah state‚Äù, and this assessment must be at the heart of how Britain shapes its future relationship with the CCP.\n\nThe first, and most obvious, casualty of Britain adopting a more robust approach to Beijing should be Boris Johnson‚Äôs questionable decision to allow the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei access to Britain‚Äôs new 5G telecoms network. Even if Mr Johnson persists with the flawed assessment that Huawei can maintain its involvement without jeopardising national security, the Prime Minister will face renewed Cabinet pressure to terminate the arrangement.\n\nSerious consideration must also be given to Britain‚Äôs broader trade links with China, which are currently worth around $25 billion a year. For too long British politicians and business leaders have kow-towed to Beijing and ignored the CCP‚Äôs repressive rule in the hope of landing lucrative contracts. This has resulted in important sectors of the British economy being out-sourced to the Chinese, from the manufacture of car components to vital pharmaceuticals.\n\nChampions of these profitable trade ties, such as former chancellor George Osborne, who once enthused about a ‚Äúgolden era‚Äù in Sino-British relations, worked on the assumption that Beijing did not pose a threat to British interests.\n\nThe naivety of this approach has been exposed through China‚Äôs response to the coronavirus, with the CCP at one point threatening to withhold the export of key medicinal supplies. If China can no longer be trusted to honour existing trading arrangements in our hour of need, then industry leaders must give serious consideration to relocating key manufacturing back to Britain.\n\nThe Government‚Äôs forthcoming integrated defence and security review is another area where we need to take heed of the threat China poses to our well-being. The last defence review, in 2015, worked on the assumption that Russia was the state that posed the biggest threat to our security.\n\nThis assessment will need to be reviewed in the light of the immense damage Beijing has inflicted on the nation‚Äôs economy and health. In future, we will need to focus our attention as much on the inner workings of the CCP‚Äôs Central Politburo as we do the Kremlin.\n\nThe era when gullible politicians in the West could give China‚Äôs motives the benefit of the doubt is well and truly over."<br />Author: 'brohan28'<br />id: 'ft8y5p'<br />Flair :Bakchod News</li>

It‚Äôs funny that with his logic the Kerala guy should also be brought to Punjab along with other terrorists. Or it took an attack on the Sikh community for them to realise that?
