<li>Title: 'People who bash Sadhguru and the people who say bashing such public figures is bad for hindu unity-- both of them have valid points and both concerns are genuine'<br />Body: "This is in regards to a previous post here on chodi \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/mlyxwx/sadhguru_is_stupid_osho_was_greedy_iskon_is_a/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\n- both sides have genuine concerns \n\nPeople who bash Sadhguru are right in pointing out the facts that many times what Sadhguru says does not make sense. \n- he says he has not read scriptures and then goes on to talk about what's written in them. Why is he even doing that. even a person who has just a basic knowledge of puranas and ithihasas passed down in the form of grandma stories would understand something is wrong in what he said about krishna and yashoda. \n- it seems he believes in Aryan invasion theory which is absurd. \n- he seems to support Dravidian movements, and it's politics. \n- he says yoga isn't hindu and he says he himself does not identify with Hinduism\n- he says india is a godless society which is a thoroughly absurd statement to make \n- he acts like a crypto budhist ( not that j am against budhism ) and says shiva is nothingness and seems to support shunya Vada which is against the traditional understanding of shiva as sat chit ananda swaroopa.\n- he goes on saying Mahashivratri is not a religious festival -- hello what else should it be -- \n- although I don't agree to many things jn this thread this thread summaries the many objectionable statements of Sadhguru \nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/home\nRead this article also -- how Sadhguru doing all this could inturn gives ammunition to western hindu hating indologists\nhttps://dharmachaara.blogspot.com/2021/04/sadhguru-agent-of-western-indological.html\n\nOkay now the side that supports Sadhguru \n- I understand this side also as I am a practitioner of Shambhavi mahamudra taught by Sadhguru and I have done inner engineering, the yoga he teaches is really effective and has had life changing effect in me so I respect him a lot.\n\n- Sadhguru has done amazing work in bringing yoga to the average hindu. And made yoga really popular \n- his rally for rivers has had huge impacts \n- his free temples movement has definitely had huge impacts and has raised the general awareness of sleeping Hindus.\n- his cool and new age presentation makes it palatable to \nThe woke segments of young Hindus and keeps them within the fold \n- he has an answer for everything ( though I don't know if that's actually a good thing) and satisfies the curiosity of Hindus. \n- he has brought a huge community of people together who works on the ground devoting time and energy, which is the need of the hour ( to do grass roots hindu and high level elite hindu ) to raise general hindu consciousness.\n- he has brought about a general positive perception about yoga. Which is really important as most people like me before did not even care about yoga but now because of him does yoga and completely loves yoga.\n\nSo these are my general points feel free to add more positive or negatives ; the places where Sadhguru has created a positive impact or the ones where he has made statements that even a person basic scriptural understanding would find absurd;  in the comment section. \n\nI feel both the sides have genuine concerns I don't really have a way forward. But I just wanted to put this out there, as I belong to both the sides, I love Sadhguru but   he says things that sometimes does not make sense.\n But as a general inference I think Sadhguru has done more good than bad to the average hindu. And as in my own case as I gained more knowledge and understanding I started to notice the points of contentions in what he says myself. So I personally feel Sadhguru is doing some really good work and to the average hindu he can be really helpful and as a person grows in understanding he can discern the points of contentions himself and will automatically choose a   narrative in favour of Dharma in the end."<br />Author: 'avashyahimsa'<br />id: 'mm3txq'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

<li>Title: "Tulsi Gabbard's existence demonstrates Hindus should not snipe at ISKCON"<br />Body: 'Tulsi Gabbard is not Indian by ethnicity but she is born a Hindu to parents that converted to Gaudiya Vaishnava sampradaya (within which ISKCON is a group) over fifty years ago. \n\nI am not personally of ISKCON nor of the larger Gaudiya Vaishnava school as I am more mainstream Bengali Hindu (Shakta-Brahmo continuum), but I always felt some of the sniping and suspicion from Hindus at ISKCON as "Abrahamized" or "undercover Christians" as incorrect. What ISKCON is giving is a good template for the missionary aspect of Hinduism, one that has at least fifty years of solid practice now in the West although one can draw origins of it going back to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu doing conversions of Muslims into Vaishnava. By the way, Acharyas from that line are also responsible for groups like Meitei in Manipur as well as a good chunk of the Hinduism in Assam. \n\nThe various other Indic groups that are exporting Hindu practices to the West and other parts of the world should incorporate this particular aspect of ISKCON, that is, full out conversion and create a community of believers in the host nation\'s society. Too many Hindu gurus are going around saying "yoga is just a tool, not necessary to convert to Hinduism to become a yogi". What it\'s doing is that the soft power of yoga is not translating into political capital for Hindus and Hindutva. Think on the other hand, a simple qawwali song is, even if not converting a Hindu straight up into a Muslim, is at least setting up fertile ground for "same-same". Similar with mainstreaming of Christian rituals whether its Christmas or showing Bollywood actors and actresses doing marriage in church etc. \n\nISKCON by the way also does hold the line that "we are not Hindus, that is just a geographical term, we are Vaishnava". That\'s okay by me. At least on the global stage we still see it translating into a Tulsi Gabbard batting for us. \n\nWhen it comes to the above line of "we are not Hindu we are xyz" I think a lot of us trads are burnt by it because of the experience from inside the Indian subcontinent, particularly groups like Sikhs or Arya Samajis or Brahmo Samaj. We don\'t like that line because it causes political division within the house when there wasn\'t any previously. However, my opinion from seeing ISKCON at work is that it is a useful tactic abroad with non Indians as it can create true allies for us.\n\nFinally, I also wish to mention that the above writeup can easily offend a true ISKCON bhakta since I am trivializing an entire group and its sadhana to being politically useful or not etc. I want to say that I am only writing the above from the mayavaadi plane (which we do need to pay attention to for the sake of Dharma and its survival in kaliyug). I completely accept the actual spirituality of ISKCON and Gaudiya Vaishnava sampradaya as fully legitimate path of bhakti towards mukti.'<br />Author: 'korolabhaja'<br />id: 'mlz9u9'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Saw in a previous post), Africa etc. I don\'t know if they are converting to Hinduism or just picking up what they connect to and integrating it with the faith they are following.\n\nBut the way Christianity and the west digests the good practices of other culture and religion by repackage as it\'s own indigenous product; I fear the good aspects of Hinduism will be taken away by the west and use it for their own growth and maybe against us or even worse sell us as their own product.  \n\n\nExample- \n\n1.

In one of the discussion Rajiv Malhotra with Sanjay Dixit about RM\'s book on AI and its impact, he was saying that we are way behind in the field of AI as compared to the west and china. And that in second book on AI he will be giving solutions from the vedas and sanatan ideology on how to accelerate the AI research and development in India despite being a late starter (and that too with a very low capital budget for research).    I fear that the west and china will pick up his solution book before we do and implement it in their systems. While we being the asslicker of the west, throwing our ancient books to trash by labeling them as unscientific and useless along with the state of political and bureaucratic incompetency will again lag behind by ignoring his early warnings like we did with the Breaking India book.\n3.  One of the institute in America had come up which gives yoga certification to institutes and teachers. While we did on have any organization as such at all. In response the AAYUSH ministry started the same thing. What the hell is this kind of reactionary response. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE EARLY BIRDS GET ALL THE WORMS.**\n\n**That is why I am a bit anxious about the spread of Sanatan to west as they picking best of our culture and progressing while we are busy picking worst of their culture for the "coolness quotient" and becoming degraded as a society and nation.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo let me know how you reflect on my thought.'<br />Author: 'helloworld090'<br />id: 'mlx1gg'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

You are today reading what I write  because all your forefathers had sex.\xa0\xa0If we all abandoned sex the  human race would fizzle out in one generation.\xa0The great yogi Vasista  several children, yet he was called a brahmacari. It is when sensory  pleasure is the sole motivating factor that brahmacarya is encroached  upon.\xa0The life force, which finds sexual expression, also serves to find  the warmth of one’s emotions,. It is the creative relationship of  purusa and prakriti which leads to freedom. Renunciation is a positive  process of disengagement, not a sterile rejection. In the ancient past,  almost all our maharishis\xa0\xa0were householders.\xa0The religious or  educational studentship of adolescence is also termed brahmacarya  ashrama. That is because the enormous outburst of energy, which is  released by puberty, needs to be controlled and channelled for the  child’s all-round growth. If a child were to indulge in sexual activity,  the moment he or she was biologically ripe, a large part of his or her  human potential would be thrown away.\xa0It is OK to have sex with the  appropriate life partner but\xa0\xa0in moderation.  \n\n\nfrom Capt.

These 2 parties created such good propaganda that people are willing to fight for them.**They are using religion and secularism to divide and rule and that\'s just one of the ways how they are owning us. People are so indoctrinated by either of these parties that they fail to see the bigger game; it\'s not just one but two of them playing the same game. They don\'t want a better India, they are just looking for quick votes, in fact both of them are just trying to sedate people with ideology-based security by feeding them an ominous soup of "secularism" or "one-state religion", apart from that they are just playing around with taxpayers money and our worst fears. They want this religious blabber to go so deep-rooted in our politics that people forget to ask better questions like poverty, education, job opportunities, development, economy and they are doing one hell of a job at it.** \n\nThey have IT cell people working for them for further indoctrinating citizens that\'s why people who are die-hard fanboys and fangirls of Modi and Rahul Gandhi and even Kejrival exist among us. We have new words coming up like chintu, librandu, bhakt etc all just part of the same poisonous soup they created.\n\nIdeology based security isn\'t going to take us much far and as long as you identify with the buzzwords they created, you are in a bunch of the same rabble as the people you love to hate only difference is that you are feeding yourself from a different media source. They have given you a fake dummy to fight within the face of manufactured librandu and bhakts. \n\nI am not denying the fact that religion is becoming problematic in India, but rather want your attention on these political charlatans that are profiteering from it and maybe they are behind igniting this religion-based violence and advertising it, I am talking for both sides. I don\'t want to be ruled by these greedy uneducated charlatans. Why don\'t you see?\n\nEdit : just a request, join r/AnarchyIndia if you are interested in debating people feeding from different soups, without getting banned.'<br />Author: '2Oth_Century_Fox'<br />id: 'mkmxsh'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

One day my Bhakt dad and guests were talking about ram mandir and how hindus got justice after 500 years which is godi propaganda , i just ignored him ...... after a few weeks , bhakts from around the building came to ask for donations for ram mandir , i know the Court also gave madjid but no one can to ask donations for the masjid , i knew that the building was filled with fascists  and my sanghi dad gave 2000 rupees for that mandir , can you imagine the fascism ? I felt like looting that money and giving it ti the masjid ti preserve secularism in India . Two days later my dad and i were watching tv and he switched to Zee news to watch that Nazi Sudhir Choudhry , sudhir was talking about mandir construction and my dad was visibly happy so i told him why not make a hospital instead of Mandir and how hospital  is more important for development  , he told me that the land given to masjid can be used for building a hospital ........ I screamed 'Fascist' at him , why are hindus only targeting peaceful minority  , is development more important than Masjid ? NO ....... My dad slapped me and told me to leave the house , now im a 28 year old communist and i don't apply for a job so that poor Dalits can get opportunity  plus my dad is quite rich so why not use his money? I left and went to my friend Rajiv's bungalow who also left his job for dalits , his father is an NRI Capitalist pig and rajiv lives in his bungalow  ,  I need to give an interview about this fascism anyone know unbiased media houses like The wire or Quint reporters Here?"<br />Author: 'mandrake2307'<br />id: 'mkil5y'<br />Flair ::HighIQ: Randia Simulation</li>

They have a uniform ideology , most if not all are socialists, they have many books to read about their ideology which is a luxury we currently lack since hindutva is a broad spectrum and between a kattar hindu and a centrist one you can add a whole political compass  because some of us may lie in between of these two , this makes are arguments weak as two guys from our sub might have a very different opinion when asked the same questions by a leftists and it breaks us from within.\n\n2. Some of them are very well read , if you ask questions  they might succeed to counter you because they know their ideology and doctrine very well whereas we have know such way to defend our ideology , you can't deny questions or point out the flaws in islam and muslims because it becomes easier for them to discredit us as fascists , uneducated beasts and islamophobics which trust me , they already do all the time. If we want to bring new people in our ideology we must not succumb to their discredit of our ideology  because people who are not aware of politics might shift on their side  \n\nIn conclusion , we need to clarify and refine our beliefs  into a piece of information like a book or an online article , so our people can study and refer to and which makes us all fall under ONE proper ideology , not bits and pieces. \n\nIf possible, learn their ways and how they work it will be a lot easier for you to dismantle them in an argument \n\nI have pointed out these problems hopefully we can come up with a solution quickly and organize proper countermeasures"<br />Author: 'mandrake2307'<br />id: 'mkel2a'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

A section of the Hindus don't consider Sai to be a Hindu god and want him to be removed while a section considers him to be one of the pantheon gods of Hinduism.\n\nSo,does it make sense to legally identify Sai Bhakts as minorities so that they can build Sai Temples of their own (they're pretty much like the Deras of North). They can build Sufi Shrines for Sai. They will be classified as Muslims in the census.

Why do you think the US intervenes so much in the middle-east? Because of OIL. Any country with oil that oppose Saudi and US, face their wrath. Either you bend to them, or get ready to face "consequences". The US media first brainwashes it\'s population with atrocity literature. It starts publishing "human rights abuses" happening in these countries. Within a year or two, they end up sending forces and destroying the entire country. \n\nThis phenomenon is observed in everyday life too. Take the liquor business for example. No liquor store ever goes into loss. Demand is always high. That is why it is impossible to get liquor license without paying bribe to govt authorities.

(Source : A telegram channel, guy is banned on twitter and social media) \n\n\n\n"Please give me back my Rajiv, I will return to my country, and if you cannot let me die here so that my remains is also part of this earth - Sonia Gandhi"\n\nIf you look at the activities of Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, who is saying this, then you understand on what mission she is actually engaged in.\n\nSonia\'s hold was not as strong on the system until Rajiv Gandhi\'s assassination. Then came PV Narasimha Rao, who continued to do his work, ignoring Sonia Gandhi.\n\nAtal Bihari Vajpayee was Prime Minister from 1999 to 2004 and during this time Sonia was also kind of helpless. But as soon as congress came to power in 2004, although she could not become the PM Sonia via her National Advisory Council started the mission she was waiting for, ever since she came to India.\n\nIn 2005, under the pressure of Sonia Gandhi, the Manmohan government made the 93rd amendment to the constitution. This amendment meant that the government could take over the educational institute of Hindus but could not even touch the institutes belonging to SC and ST or minority institutions.\n\nThis was Sonia Gandhi\'s biggest move to separate Dalits and Adivasis from Hinduism. The effect of this was that it became very difficult for Hindus to run their educational institutions. Sonia enacted the Right to Education Act in 2009 on the advice of the Church. Through this, it was made necessary to enroll 25 percent poor students in general educational institutions whereas there is no such obligation on other institutions belonging to ST/SC and minority institutions. Infact minority institutions were even exempted from giving reservation to scheduled castes and tribes.\n\nSonia\'s stakes have fatal effects:\n\nThe 93rd amendment of the first constitution and then the Right to Education (RTE) Act made it much cheaper for Christians and Muslims to run educational institutions. \n\nOn the other hand, educational institutions belonging to Hindus were being closed.\n\nMany medical and engineering colleges run by people of the Lingayat community in Karnataka. When the crisis arose in front of them, they started demanding recognition of the Lingayat community as a separate religion different from Hindus. A similar demand also arose from the Sai devotee community. \n\nActually, it was the bet of Sonia Gandhi, so that on seeing this, different communities of Hinduism started demanding the status of separate religion themselves calling themselves different from Hindus. The plan even went so far as to give vent to the demand for recognition of a separate religion to communities like Kabirpanthi, Nath sect, Vaishnavism. \n\nAt the time of independence with similar stakes, the Congress separated the Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists from Hinduism.\n\nIn fact, since 2004, at the behest of Sonia Gandhi, the Congress governments took many decisions which were really an attack on the backbone of Hinduism. Surprisingly, the media fully supported the Congress in all these.\n\nAffidavit on Ram Setu:\n\nIn 2007, the Congress government gave an affidavit in the Supreme Court that since Ram, Sita, Hanuman and Valmiki are fictional characters, Ram Sethu cannot be considered of any religious significance against a case filed by CM of TN JJ and not Swami as he claims\n\nWhen the BJP took up the matter (not Swami) and fought vigorously, the Manmohan government had to pull back.\nHindu terrorism term was coined to discredit Hindus in their own land:\n\nEarlier the word terrorism was never used with Hindus. After the Malegaon and Samjhauta train blasts, contrary to the evidence the Congress governments, in a very deep conspiracy, wrapped up Hindu organizations in this blast and expressed that the threat of Hindu terrorism was looming in the country. \n\nThey falsely implicated and tortured an army officer and a Hindu monk for over a decade. Whereas the truth was far from it. These conspiracies of the Congress have been dismantled in the court.\n\nTrying to divide the army on caste lines:\n\nDuring Sonia Gandhi\'s time, there was a great effort to divide the Indian Army into caste and religion. Then, based on the recommendation of the Sachar Committee, a survey was conducted on Muslims in the army. The matter was suppressed after the opposition of the BJP, but it is still seen as a serious attempt to break the forces of the country. Also the upgradation needed for the army in terms of equipment and machinery was denied seriously hampering their preparedness\n\nGovernment help to the church:\n\nLittle will be known that wherever the Congress government was formed, to what extent the government-funded the church from tax payers money. This was revealed by the RTI in Karnataka, where the Siddaramaiah government in the name of repairing and maintaining the church Crores of rupees were distributed.\n\nOur sage Shankaracharya arrested:\n\nIn 2004, when the Congress came to power, Shankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati of Kanchi Kamakoti Peeth was arrested on the night of Diwali, which was considered to be the work of the then Jayalalithaa government of Tamil Nadu. But the former President Pranab Mukherjee later mentioned the incident in his book, which showed that the game was actually created by the Central Government. \n\nShankaracharya was a hindrance for the Christian missionaries in their conversion of Hindus. He was implicated by the Congress to defame Hindus.\n\nObject to the prayer of the Kendriya Vidyalaya:\n\nThis is the case of 2019 when an application was filed in the court to change \'Asato Ma Sadgamay\' through a lawyer as this was the daily prayer in Kendriya Vidyalaya schools. It is claimed that Sonia Gandhi\'s mind was behind this. She had tried to put an end to this even before her reign of 2014 but could not succeed.\n\nDoordarshan logo:\n\nThe logo of Doordarshan was "Satyam Shivam Sundaram" which was also removed during the Manmohan government, at whose behest, we can very well guess.\n\nThere is so much more behind the scenes perhaps we will never know which died with pappu\'s father and AHMED PATEL (Sonia Gandhi).\n\nJai Hind'<br />Author: 'Aye_chup'<br />id: 'mjujsv'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
<li>Title: 'Representing against the new Re-registration &amp; Fitness Tax hike proposals for older cars'<br />Body: "The proposed hikes in taxes to sustain the older (15 years or older) private motor vehicles are quite draconian and the [attached notification](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/indian-car-scene/2139100d1617192010-representing-against-new-re-registration-fitness-tax-hike-proposals-older-cars-scrapping-media-handout-1-.pdf) by the Transport Ministry dated 15.03.2021 is evidence enough that the government is now coercing old motor vehicle owners to either pay more or scrap. Many gullible owners will try to avoid paying such huge fees and maybe fines to retain their respective motor vehicles and will under duress succumb and hand over his or her otherwise fit old vehicle to the scrap yard. The [Media Handout](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/indian-car-scene/2139099d1617191966-representing-against-new-re-registration-fitness-tax-hike-proposals-older-cars-2021-cf-fees-draft-gazette-notification.pdf) was released by the Transport Ministry to justify the scrapping policy and is coloured and distorted with fudged figures and statistics, much to the old vehicle owner's disadvantage.\n\nThe hike in taxes, huge fines for delays in fitness can be represented against to the Ministry of Road Transport and our representation will reveal how much damaging the proposed measures are to nearly destroy our automobile history in one go. Hence, owners, enthusiasts and well-wishers of the targeted 15-49 year old motor vehicles need to positively send representations within 30 days w.e.f. 15.03.2021 i.e. by 13.04.2021, the date of issue of the draft notification no. G.S.R. 191 (E) to comments-morth@gov.in, their designated email id for the purpose. Confirmation copy can be also sent to director-morth@gov.in, the Director (MVL). MVL stands for Motor Vehicle Legislation.\n\nA draft is appended herewith which may please be edited according to your choice. But please positively send as many representations for the cause. Reading through, the potential damage it is capable of can be well fathomed. Read with the Scrapping Policy, the combination of the two in unison is lethal for the well-being of our poor old automobiles.\n\n**Draft**\n\nTo\n\nThe Joint Secretary (MVL)\n\nUnion Road Transport and Highways Ministry,\n\nNew Delhi 110 001\n\nDated ...\n\n\nSubject:- Objections and suggestions with regard to Re-registration Fee Hikes and Vehicle Scrapping Policy\n\nReference:- Your Draft Notification no. G.S.R. 191 (E) dated 15.03.2021 read with the Scrapping Policy\n\nSir/Mam,\n\nThis is to register my objections and suggestions with regard to the above draft notification for re-registration and fitness fee hikes in respect of 15-49 year old private motor vehicles, under the non-transport category.\n\nSection A - THE PROPOSED FEE HIKES\n\n(1) The proposed fee hikes listed under para 3 (ii) Sr. No. 4 pages 5 and 6 TABLE in respect of renewal of registrations for private/ non-transport motor cycles as in Sr No. 4(b) (Rs 1000=00) , as in Sr No. 4 (c) three-wheelers (Rs 2500=00) , as in Sr No. 4 (d) light motor vehicle (car/jeep) Rs 5000=00 and as in Sr 4 (g) also those for imported motor cycles (Rs 10,000=00) , as in Sr No. 4 (h) imported light motor vehicles (Rs 40,000=00) and as in Sr. No. 4 (i) for any vehicle not mentioned above (Rs 6000=00) are extremely high, inequitable, irrational, unreasonable and not at all commensurate with the services provided or for the enhancement in the existing services provided by the concerned authority.\n\nThe levy of such astronomical amounts of fees is uncalled for. You may appreciate the fact that the owners of such motor vehicles older than 15 years belong to the lower class, daily wagers, retired persons who could have bought their last vehicle before superannuating and also enthusiasts, who treasure the family owned motorcycle or car, sometimes since more than one generation.\n\n(2) We have to bring to your notice that such old vehicles do not ply like regular vehicle on the road, particularly the Vintage and Classic vehicle. On the contrary, they are preserved and cherished as heritage and maintaining such vehicle by itself is very costly. At any rate, the levy of fees and taxes on such vehicles in astronomical proportion as compared to new vehicles defeat very purpose of term “Quid Pro Quo”. The Services provided by the state are not utilized by such vehicles proportional to fees levied on them and therefore, the increase in fees is contrary to the principle of quid pro quo and is rendered confiscating in nature. Such impression of confiscating fees is unconstitutional and cannot stand scrutiny of law.\n\n(3) The classification made also does not have any rational with the objective sought to be achieved. The unreasonableness in the classification is writ large from the categorization which clearly depicts that the same has been fixed without application of mind and in most unreasonable and irrational manner. Before making such classification, it would have been proper for ministry to have obtained information from experts and such exercise would have helped in making a reasonable classification or categorization. Such classification, therefore, cannot stand scrutiny of law.\n\n(4) The additional fees referred to in the draft notification in para 3(ii) Sr. No. 4 in the contents of Note 2 : on page 6 states:-\n\n“case of delay in applying for renewal of certificate of registration , an additional fee of three hundred rupees for delay of every month or part thereof in respect of motorcycles and five hundred rupees for delay of every month or part thereof in respect of other classes of non-transport vehicles shall be levied.”\n\nIt is brought to your notice that referring to your additional fees proposed to be levied vide notification no. GSR 1183 (E) dated 29.12.2016,the Hon’ble Madras High Court in W.P. nos 1598, 1067, 2117, 3519 and 4939 and five other W.M.P.’s of 2017 on 03.04.2017, ruled that :-\n\n“We fail to see any justification for the levy of an additional fee in the nature of the penalty when there is no change in the nature of service rendered by the authority under the Act particularly in the absence of any statutory backing for the same. The purpose, as is apparent from the recommendation of the committee is the fond hope that such levy would act as a deterrent for non-compliance of various provisions. Such non compliance is however, a matter to be addressed using such powers as have been extended to the authorities. The Motor Vehicles Act and the Central Motor Vehicles Rules at present, only contain a provision authorizing the levy of a fee and nothing more.”\n\nThe proposed additional fees are irrational, inequitable and illegal and beyond your jurisdiction. This could be out of reach for many classes of persons owning such 15-49 year old vehicles as already stated in para (1) above.\n\n(5) In para 3(iii) Sr. No. 4. page 6, the fees for conducting tests indicated in the Table at 10 A. of a vehicle for grant and renewal of certificate of fitness for such older vehicles stated in (a) (i) and (ii) for Motorcycle for manual (Rs 400=00) and automated tests (Rs 500=00) and in (b) for Three wheeled or LMV or quadri-cycle for (i) for manual (Rs 800=00) and (ii) automated (Rs 1000=00) are irrational, inequitable and unreasonable and are solely meant like other clauses to frustrate and coerce old vehicle owners to either pay huge and uncalled for enhanced fees and additional fees or surrender their otherwise fit and non-polluting vehicles under compulsion to the scrapping centres.\n\n(6) The total amounts as stated above in paras (1) and (5) inclusive of all new levies payable by old vehicle owners for fitness and re-registration thus works out to Rs 2400=00 for Indian motorcycles, Rs 11,500=00 for Imported motorcycles, Rs 13,300=00 for Indian cars and Rs 48,500=00 for Imported cars, once every five years. These amounts do not include any fines for delays. This is lawfully contrary to the principles of natural justice.\n\nSection B - THE SCRAPPING POLICY\n\nThe proposed hike in fees with levies of additional fees read with your scrapping policy indicate the link between these two documents, that are solely meant to discourage owners of older (15-49) year old privately owned vehicles from owning them by falsely and with malafide intentions labeling them as unsafe and polluting. The reality is much different. You may please note that:-\n\n(1) The Delhi and NCR ban on 10 and 15 year old diesel and petrol private cars w.e.f. 2016 has resulted in not removing pollution from the areas. In fact, the smog and AQI (air quality index) of the winters of 2019-20 and 2020-21 were the worst ever in history. Before apportioning the blame on old motor vehicles , you need to identify and penalize the other main polluters.\n\n(2) Such old vehicles are very less used on a regular basis as daily drivers. Not more than 5 to 10 % of such old vehicles are visible in any traffic jam or parking lot as you may infer through studies by accredited institutions. On the other hand replacements with newer vehicles will entail usage of five to ten times more causing more pollution and increases in oil import bills.\n\n(3) We will be eliminating a substantial part of our automobile, industrial and mechanical history. We have had automobiles with truly 100 % Indian made components and with Indian brand names like Yezdi, Bajaj, Premier, Ambassador, Vijai, Lamby, Mahindra, Allwyn, Luna, Kinetic, Badal, Sipani and more since the late 1960’s and mostly from the early 1970’s. The Ambassador and Rajdoot as brands were in vogue much earlier. The natural rates of attrition are very high presently and usually older vehicles are discarded by most owners after 10 to 15 years.\n\n(4) All developed Western countries in are encouraging preservation of 30 year or older vehicles, labeling them as Historic or as Young Timers and are valuing their worth as a part of their national wealth. Germany, U.K. and France lead the other nations here. The U.K. estimates that its 1.2 million such old vehicles to be worth 17.8 Billion pounds (Rs 167,000 crores). The US has accorded a special status to 30 year old vehicles aiming at preservation and estimates that it has about 21 million such old vehicles/cars.\n\n(5) China is among the rarest of nations that has a compulsory automobile scrapping policy. The Chinese are known for the disdain to preserve their own history. Hence, if we follow the coercive and deterring methods for owners to compel them to scrap old private vehicles, we could be emulating the Chinese model.\n\n(6) The handing over of an otherwise fit and non-polluting vehicle for scrapping by any owner should not be under duress or after being throttled, due to such high and disproportionate fees. In fact, the owner needs to hand over the vehicle to the scrap yard with a smile and with his own willingness.\nWith such a coercive and deterring levy of fees and additional fees vide the draft notification of 15.03.2021 under reference will only punish the daily wage earners, poor, lower class, lower middle class, retired persons and also automobile enthusiasts. Some among the enthusiasts are maintaining the older cars/bikes for generations in the best possible conditions, which form a part of the family heirloom. Moreover, the present state of the economy due to the pandemic has paralysed the earnings of many of the owners of such older automobiles.\n\nHence, it is to request you that the above points as listed in Sections A and B may please be sympathetically looked into and the extremely high, inequitable, irrational and unreasonable proposed hikes be done away with.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\n(Name)\n\n( City )\n\n(contact number)\n\n[source](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/indian-car-scene/235180-representing-against-new-re-registration-fitness-tax-hike-proposals-older-cars.html)\n\nTL:DR : The proposed hikes in taxes to sustain the older (15 years or older) private motor vehicles are quite draconian. Many gullible owners will try to avoid paying such huge fees and maybe fines to retain their respective motor vehicles and will under duress succumb and hand over his or her otherwise fit old vehicle to the scrap yard.

My family moved from Bangladesh to west Bengal in 1946 (paternal family 1947), due to "atyachar" carried out by muslims on Hindu families in that era. \nMy maternal family lost all the land they owned in Dhaka because they were Hindus and no legit paperwork. My maternal grandfather\'s father died because he didn\'t accept Islam, my maternal greatgrandmother escaped with my grandfather and his brothers to India. \nMy paternal grandfather moved back to Bangladesh in 1960s and started taking part in movement against Pakistan along with his own brother Biswajit Nandi (A freedom fighter for Bangladesh in 1971, u can search about him on internet) leaving his indian wife here. He had all the land paperworks so he didn\'t face much quarrel during that time. He used his power against Pakistani forces to fight for the freedom of Bangladesh! Biswajit Nandi, was given a death sentence from pakistani gov. For his contribution to Bangladesh freedom! My grandfather had to sell most of his land to keep up with lawyer and court cost! Many of my family members were killed by muslims during that time. Later after freedom of Bangladesh he settled in mymensingh his homeland with his wife, leaving my dad in some boarding school in kolkata because he feared that my father may get killed by Muslims if some civil war breaks out! Just because he fought for freedom of Bangladesh, he\'s not much of a target of current muslim motherfuckers. When I call him he always tell me how our Hindu brothers in bangladesh are getting killed or converted by muslims. \n\n(No I don\'t have any problem with NRC. My dad was born in India in 1970 and my mom in 1979)\n\nI can\'t accept Muslims as my brothers because they are the reason my family suffered so much. I am HINDU and I am proud of it just like my great grand father who sacrificed his and never accepted Islam!'<br />Author: 'accomplisheddickhead'<br />id: 'mjbmc0'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

People can be manipulated to favour a certain movement or political belief , the KGB achieved this in America where in the 60's and 70's college students were introduced to the idea of soviet socialism , and these people now hold positions of power in the government, how did they get in there?

<li>Title: 'Peopling Of India'<br />Body: 'I know some theories and discussions regarding the peopling of India, who we really are and stuff keep revolving on this sub. I\'m a history student and I\'ve been studying the peopling of India for quite some time now. So I\'m basically gonna discuss that in this post. Idk how the people of this sub are gonna take it but here it goes.\n\n\n\n\nFirst things first, the Aryan Invasion Theory is bullshit, yes. It was discarded a little while after it was actually proposed. Anyone who still believes in the theory needs to get their facts checked. However, the *Aryan Migration Theory* (or the Indo Iranian Migration Theory) , is pretty valid. And it\'s the most accepted and likely theory about India\'s peopling. Not saying that it\'s the truth, because obviously it\'s just the theory, but most of the evidence points towards it. \n\n\n\n\nNow obviously because of the uncertainties regarding and surrounding the term "Aryan" , the proper term to use here(and the one that is used in the actual studies anyways) is "Indo-Iranian". The Indo Iranian Migration theory has its basis mainly on the differences between the genetic structures of North Indians and South Indians, the cultural - linguistics differences between them, the highly similar genetic structure and ethno - cultural classification that North Indians share with Iranians, the smooth genetic(and somewhat linguistic) progression of the Indo - Middle East - Eurasian - European belt and some other stuff. \n\n\n\n\nTo put the theory in simple terms, it basically proposes that after the decline of the IVC, some of its people moved southwards, mixing with the "AASI"(Ancient Ancestral South Indians) to form the "ASI"(Ancestral South Indians). Now, Indo Iranians might\'ve people of this cultural complex existing in west Eurasia called the "Sintashta Culture". Around 2200 BCE, the Indo Iranians migrated towards the Indo Iranian belt, where they split into two groups, one the Iranians and other, the Indo Iranians. The Indo Iranians migrated towards North India where they mixed to some extent with some of the remaining IVC people and formed the "ANI"(Ancestral North Indians). The theory is a lot bigger and explains a lot of other things as well(like Hinduism, charriots and vedas), this was just a rough overview of it. \n\n\n\n\nOver the years obviously a lot of mixing has happened, with the same genes being reinforced and other outer genes coming in as well, and as a result now modern Indians for the most part have a roughly similar genetic structure. However, the difference between the general structure of North Indians and South Indians is visible, and it increases as you go further north and further south and compare the two. The Indo Aryan gene pool is found predominantly in North Indians, and only in little amounts in South Indians. Also the fact that North Indian languages and South Indian languages belong to a different family of languages. \n\n\n\n\nBasically we need to accept that our gene pool is diverse and mixed and our peopling is complex. Our ancestors weren\'t all indigenous to this land and this land only, like they just magically appeared in India. There have been migrations in our country.'<br />Author: 'babatundethegreat'<br />id: 'mitszd'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Why havent we been able to retaliate in events like these and just run away all the times. \n\nEven the sikhs have hold their ground when needed despite being a minority, but we hindus have always faced the axe both here and across the border while the perpetrators walk away freely or get lifelong access to food and shelter in prisons. \n\nSome mahant had said on youtube that our blood has become water and that is why it flows like water.

There is a simple solution to this and it doesn't revolve around abolishing the reservation system, I say keep the reservation system till every Hindu child has enough support to get out of poverty , remove the OBC status of Muslims and uplift the Hindu's. We have to be be honest with ourselves, even in the communist state of Kerala I have seen children of other caste being denied education in certain Hindu schools. We will only win this war from Rapid Islamisation only if we treat the lowest rung of Hindu's well ( economic and caste). I have so many reports of Dalits and other lower caste converting to Islam because they didn't require the right help from the Hindu community, we can all argue that the help was present but they didn't take it etc, that doesn't change the facts that we have one less family in India which practices Hinduism now.\n\nThe only way India will survive this rapid Islamisation is if we help uplift the lowest rung.\n\nP.S : The crimes against Hindus in our own country has gone through the roof, it's high time the Government introduce a Hindu police or something similar to that, a branch that helps Hindu's when they are being systematically targeted because of thier religion."<br />Author: 'Ashutosh66ii'<br />id: 'mihdst'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: '[Note: Mature Content] A question regarding which there have been countless debates and arguments: Did Ravan have sex with Sita in Lanka after he abducted her?'<br />Body: "So this is quite a controversial topic, considering it's about one of the major characters of the ancient epic Ramayan by Valmiki, and involves a lot of sexuality.\n\nHistorians and writers who've explored the Ramayan have almost always avoided this subject, which isn't surprising at all, since most Indians are still uncomfortable about sexuality even to this day. Since the text in question is the Ramayan, it only makes sense for annalists to gloss over this segment of the goddess Sita's abduction and enslavement in Lanka.\n\nWhile it may be open for debate, the fact remains that, according to Valmiki's Ramayan, Sita indeed engaged in sexual intercourse with her captor. Although Valmiki does not provide any details or particulars regarding the extent of her physical relations with Ravan, there is an *explicit* description of sex between the two characters. Furthermore, there are quite a few references to this incident by various characters of the epic, such as Jatayu, Hanuman, Mandodhari, and Sita herself. The amount of dispute on Ravan and Sita being involved in such a scandalous affair is akin to the dispute on whether or not Draupadi was dragged to the Kuru Sabha. To sum it all up, I believe there's a high probability that Ravan did have sex with Sita(which was non-consensual, of course.)\n\nI would like to begin a discussion on this point, and know what different opinions members of this subreddit could possibly have on it.\n\n(Warning: if this question disturbs you, please do not engage and stay away. There's enough controversy already, we don't need more.)"<br />Author: 'TanatanDonut'<br />id: 'mhtczo'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: "*Posting this on request from my personal archive. I wrote this critique of Mahua Moitra's 14 sign of fascism speech in LS at that time. It was a long time back. So excuse my underwhelming and somewhat unsound response. Also it was mainly intended for librandu audience. So keep that in mind."<br />Body: 'Deconstruction: The Mahua Moitra Chapter  \n \\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nNothing beats a cup of chai or a cup of black coffee or a thought  provoking battle of narrative. I find truth in every narrative, and  lies, and the logical fallacies attached with it. The inherent nature of  setting a narrative is based on some assumption, some pre-conceived  notions and some agendas. Not only I welcome every voice, but I actually  like to see it gets its due respect. But the problem arises when I see  only the truth is recognised but the lies and the fallacies goes  unnoticed. It creates a new set of "Bhakts".  \n \n\nRecently the  speech of Mahua Moitra in LS has garnered a lot of buzz. I consider it  very healthy for democracy and I welcome it when I saw it the first  time. But seeing people are going gaga over this I thought I should  bring out the fallacies I noticed.  \n \n\nFirst of all, shouting does not make your case and  point, your arguments do. Now let’s go and break down the arguments  point by point.  \n \n\nIntroduction:  \n "Constitution is under  threat" - is not backed by any example. Just going with the confirmation  bias that is present in mainstream media. Just check how many  constitutional amendment bills have been presented in the house in last  five years and how many got mandate from opposition as well. A case of  circular argument.  \n Carefully choosing words - "The sun will never  set on this Indian empire that the government is seeking to build" -  trying to draw analogy from British Empire.   \n \n\n1. "Powerful and  continuing nationalism" - uses adjective like \'superficial\',  \'xenophobic\' and \'narrow\' and links it with Nationalism, which I find  problematic, although, I agree with the argument about NRC.  \n Also I agree that there cannot be one slogan, one symbol for the diversity that India has.   \n  But Indian Nationalism is different from western construct. Just like  the State and Nation-state in Europe, where Nation-state has a broader  connotation, India has the Concept of Rajya and Rashtra. The Republic of  India is "Bharat Ganarajya" (Check your Passport), which is defined by  the border, emblem, flag etc. But the Rashtra of India is broader than  the Republic of India. Heck even the emblem is a symbol of \'Ashokan  State\' not of \'Kautilyan State\'. It encapsulates the cultural and  historical idea of Bharat.  \n \n\n2. Disdain for human Rights  violation: She mentions that there is 10X increase of hate crime from  2014 and 2019. I am not sure where she got this data from. I don’t think  there is any profiling of criminal case based on hate crime. I do not  know what IPC or CRPC sections could be classified as hate crimes. This  seems to be a case of hyperbole and Hasty Generalisation. Please give me  an authentic source of information where this claim can be  substantiated. I am willing to reconsider my position.  \n She mentions  Pehlu Khan to Ansari. Now there are few other incidents that she is  missing. I can give you a list of 50 cases where the victim is not from  minority community. So this is clearly a Law and Order issue, which is a  state subject. Instead of voicing for police reform she is giving it a  communal colour.   \n Instead of talking about what police reform could  be facilitated she is implying it is a case of communal violence. A case  of Appeal to Pity.  \n It is not that all hell broke in 2014 and people  started lynching. It is a law and order issue which needs to be fixed  ASAP. And why would you do that? After all out of the 545+245 members of  both the houses of parliament, probably 100+ are out on bail and 200+  have criminal case registered against them. Who would axe their own  feet?  \n \n\n3. Controlling mass media:  \n 5 of this media house is  directly or indirectly controlled by one man in this country. She does  not mention who this person is, but that is Ok.   \n TV channels played  propaganda for the ruling party. You mean both Namo TV and ABP Ananda,  right? Just like those unreported riots that were influenced  politically, right?  \n She is asking for ad spent per media house.  Which is good enough argument. I think we all agree with that. Now would  you support the demand for bringing the National Parties under RTI?  Would you support the same argument for the political parties? Let\'s not  form a smog and create an illusion of making a good argument. I don’t  have problem with the points that have been raised, rather I have  problem with people calling you a good debater. Don\'t worry, I am not  going into nitty-gritty of what you do in a debate. That would be Ad  hominem on my part.  \n Now let’s come to the point that 120+ people are  recruited for I&amp;B Ministry, whose job is solely to check the  contents of TV every day. Now, as per my knowledge, I&amp;B ministry is  mainly responsible for running only government channels, i.e., LSTV,  RSTV AIR News etc. My information might be wrong. But content is subject  matter of each individual private media. And even in Government  channel, there are coverage for all significant parties. Have you ever  even watched a government channel? Have you ever watched the debates  conducted on RSTV? Let\'s talk about facts, not  assumption. You are going all Strawman over this topic.  \n Election was  fought on fake news and Whatsapp. Telling a lie a thousand times and it  becomes truth. Gabble doctrine. Again false equivalence drawn between  Hitler and current regime. Now please madam, decide what do you want to  call this legislative body out for? For being a imperialist Britain or  Fascist Germany? However I understand the point you are trying to make.   \n  36 Dynasts of Congress vs. 31 of BJP. That is a party wise tally, I  should not get into that. But this is what I like about BJP and CPIM.  Both the party has cadre system. Anyone can work their way up and reach  the top position. Not in congress I guess. It also seems that in future  AITC will turn into a dynastic party. And there is a difference between  "MP ka beta MP" and "PM ka beta PM".  \n \n\n4. National Security: Fear  pervading everywhere. Kalabhoot? Where is this argument going madam? It  is going all red herring. You mentioned 106% increase of death of Army  Jawans in J&amp;K. Now is the data based on Year on Year basis? Or based  on 5 years term? I also think that is possible given 44 Jawans died in  Pulwama and several other incidents but please specify the details. What  have you done to co-operating when action is needed? What are your  stand on cross border human trafficking, Cattle smuggling in Bengal  border? WB ranks number one in girl child trafficking. Why are you not  pressuring Central Government to fix porous border? Why are you not  improving Law and Order situation in WB? Who is stopping you? Why don’t  you file a PIL to SC if the Central government is not cooperating? Get a  mandate from SC and pressurise the government. 22 MP seats are good  enough to disrupt LS in case you are really willing to work.  \n  Religion and government has already been intertwined. If you don’t  agree, go read Article 30 of Constitution, Hindu Marriage Act, Muslim  Personnel Law to name a few. It is a shame that instead of being  \'secular\' country, India still has separate civil law based on religion.  You forgot to mention Article 44 of the Constitution of India.  \n \n\n 5. You said that only one community is targeted via Anti-Immigration  law. First of all, it is not anti-immigration law, it is Citizenship  Amendment Act. You are twisting words just to inflate the gravity of the  situation.   \n Now what does the Citizenship Amendment Act says? It  says that is applies for prosecuted Religious Minority of Pakistan,  Afghanistan and Bangladesh. What are the provision? It is just that the  norms for citizenship for these prosecuted minorities are a bit relaxed.  It does not prosecute minorities of India.   \n And let’s not confuse  between NRC and Citizenship Amendment Bill. NRC pact was signed between  Rajiv Gandhi and Assam Students Union in 1985.  \n I guess you have some  confusion over Ram Mandir Land and rest of India. While Ram Mandir land  is Nationalised land, govt has yet kept this for consideration of SC so  that democratic right of all the concerned parties can have a voice.  What security do you want? Law and Order or Border Security? Govt is  trying enough to strengthen Border security. What are you doing to  strengthen Law and Order situation?  \n \n\n6. Disdain for  Intellectuals and art. O ho ho ho ho! Let\'s not even dig an inch deeper  what happens in the field of intellectual and art. Let’s not try to link  who\'s who in there. Who is whose cousin, brother, sister, father,  mother, husband etc., who is patronised by whom. Let’s not try to find  out how and why historians like RC Majumdar was side-lined. Let’s not  argue how curriculum and historical perception has changed since  independence. Just go and check NCERT Secondary History text books how  many time Netaji was mentioned.  \n \'Secondary school textbook are  manipulated\'. First of all, that is a blatant and white lie. Last  amendment was done during UPA rule.   \n I agree with you that there is a  severe crisis of research facility. Where government is keen on  investing only on space, defence, We need a massive infrastructure and  huge funding on RnD. Without strong RnD facility we will remain  dependent upon foreign countries in matters of modern technologies. Just  merely mentioning Lack of Scientific Temperament does not provide a  solution.   \n \n\n7. Erosion of independence of EC: Government has  introduced EVM, VVPAT. Have invited political parties to come and try to  figure out if there is any flaw in the machine. And about the  independence of EC, I cannot help you if you are deliberately blind to  the actions EC took against parties other than yours, or ruling party  for the matter.  \n \n\nWe have thousands and thousands of \'experts\'  who can criticise, censure the actions of governments, but very few can  provide constructive criticism and alternative mode of governance. I  would like you to see as a responsible MP and provide constructive  argument on how the government should work. Merely pointing fingers can  produce a lot of fan boys and fan girls, but that ultimately contributes  nothing to the society.'<br />Author: 'Straight_Razor007'<br />id: 'mhrmdk'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
