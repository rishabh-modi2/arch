<li>Title: 'Was the demolition of Babri Masjid illegal?'<br />Body: 'Yes. It was illegal. It was also *right*. The two are not mutually exclusive.\n\nFacts: \n\n* Babri Masjid was built over a Temple\n* The site was at one of the holiest sites to Hindus, meaning the temple was likely the Ram temple.\n* The Masjid was a symbol of centuries of brutal oppression by Mughals.\n* The first records of legal claims against the structure were filed TWO CENTURIES AGO, in the 1820\'s, to the Colonial courts (under the British Raj), which repeatedly refused to look into the matter.\n* There were several subsequent attempts at legal recourse, over *decades*, by the Hindus. \n* Illegal demolition was NOT their first option.\n* The ASI has repeatedly conducted excavations (since the 70\'s) with religiously-mixed groups of archeologists, and eminent historians, and the conclusion has always been the same: There is a massive temple that was demolished to build the Masjid.\n* Their findings were always *intentionally suppressed* by the politically-powerful Left.\n* Legal avenues were intentionally stalled, pressurized, mired in controversy, and misled by propaganda and distortions, despite clear evidence presented by the plaintiffs.\n* The public debate was further poisoned by selective disinformation, and the factual findings of the ASI continued to remain heavily suppressed. \n* The media sowed further seeds of the communal divide, becoming a willing participant in the disinformation campaign.\n\nNone of these facts are even remotely disputed by anyone with an ounce of intellectual honesty. There is enough documentation and evidence to back up each fact multiple times over, from various angles and sources.\n\nNow here is my opinion, based on these facts:\n\nIf you deny a person or community any recourse to justice, and **sabotage every sincere effort of theirs to amicably (and legally) resolve a situation**, you leave them no other choices, aside from either submitting to your whim, or choosing a path of vigilantism.\n\nThe Hindu community in India is a docile behemoth. They played nice, tried doing things by the book, had a legitimate claim, and were willing to make concessions towards an amicable solution. All they got in return was to be spurned, have lies and propaganda about them printed, have their legitimate claims mocked and ridiculed, have every reasonable effort stonewalled, and to top it all off, while they were treated like dirt, the propagandists, the anti-Hindu communal bandwagon, misinformation-peddlers pretending to be historians ^([link removed for subreddit rules]), were all paraded as heroes, as intellectuals, as being secular, as being honest, and as reliable sources.\n\nThe silent behemoth got fed up of playing fair with people who cared nothing for playing nice, and decided to get justice the dirty way. And that cursed building was reduced to rubble in hours.\n\nWhy care about what is legal or not, when the people opposing you have no such concerns and have no qualms about derailing legal proceedings, denying you access to a legal verdict, and abusing that advantage to suppress you?\n\nThere\'s a myth being spread around that "they could have just shifted the Masjid" as some people claim "Just like Tipu\'s armory".\n\nLeaving aside all the theoretical stuff about how feasible such an option was, given that it was not a free-standing structure, but had an entire *building* buried beneath it, let\'s look at the *practical* side of it.\n\n* Such an option may certainly have been explored, had the rabid propagandists actually acknowledged the factual claims of the Hindus.\n* Such an option might have been considered, had these people not seen fit to stall the process of *justice*.\n* Such an option might have been executed, if there had been some amicable agreement they were willing to reach.\n\nBut no. They decided to demonize Hindus instead. Now, tell me, how exactly might Hindus have gone about the rather time-consuming and complex task of moving the building (or getting the resources and permissions needed for such a task), when their opponents had no interest in even hearing them out. Do you imagine the Muslims would have taken any unilateral attempt by Hindus to *move* their structure with good grace? The same Hindus that were being demonized in the media?\n\nNo.\n\nThe Hindus had no option but to simply tear down this edifice of oppression, regardless of what names people called them, and how the \'secular forces\' and \'intellectuals\' ranted and raved against them.\n\nThis \'illegal act\' is squarely on the heads of every person, party, and organization, that conspired and colluded to deny Hindus their justice for the nearly 200 years that the Hindus sought a legal solution to the problem.\n\nThe same ones that never miss an opportunity to bring up justice for historical oppression of lower castes by upper castes, want **all castes** of Hindus to simply forget about the historical oppression of Hindus by Islamist tyrants.\n\nTearing down *every last brick* of that structure was **absolutely** the right thing to do, seeing how every other option was sealed shut.\n\nToday, we finally have a verdict, and while the courts have every right to chastise those that tore down the structure for breaking the law, the fact remains that without such action, the process would never have reached this stage. The verdict correctly allocates the possession of the land back to the Hindus, who have waited nearly 2 full centuries for such a verdict, and have lived for near 500 years under the shadow of the monument honoring those that terrorized them.\n\nJustice delayed is justice denied. Overall, this is a victory for truth, but the people who destroyed the illegal structure were *right* to commit their *illegal* act.'<br />Author: 'fsm_vs_cthulhu'<br />id: 'i51s97'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: "Article on Sri Sri Ravi Shankar ji's role in Ayodhya dispute resolution"<br />Body: ' \n\n*-By Bhanumati Narasimhan*  \nI  was watching the Bhoomi puja at Ayodhya on TV today, like millions of  others in the country. Memories of Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar ‚Äôs  consistent efforts to peacefully resolve this 500-year-old conflict were  flashing repeatedly in my mind. I felt grateful and thought that I  should pen down whatever I know of his work and share it with you all.\n\nMy  first visit to Ayodhya with Gurudev was almost seventeen years ago.  Temples in the south are vast and open. I was excited about seeing the  birthplace of Lord Rama and was wondering how grand and beautiful the  place may look. The closer I went, there were more armed security  walking around than devotees. Narrow railed passages led to a small shed  with a leaky roof under which three little idols were kept. After a  quick darshan one had to move out even more quickly.\n\n‚ÄúAyodhya  is where there is no conflict,‚Äù says Gurudev, ‚Äúand Ram is the inner  radiance, the Self.‚Äù This very same city with such a beautiful name has  been the center for innumerable conflicts claiming hundreds and  thousands of lives in the past few centuries.\n\nFinally,  last year, the Supreme court gave a unanimous verdict for the  construction of the temple and also for the allotment of a separate  piece of land in Ayodhya for the construction of a mosque. The key  points of the verdict bore a remarkable resemblance to the proposal for  out-of-court settlement that I had first heard from Gurudev in 2003. I  can‚Äôt help but wonder how much communal turmoil could have been saved  over the past fifteen years, if this thorn in the fabric of our society  had been removed at that time itself. However, there were hardliners who  refused to accept the solution at that time. They were keen to take it  to court. They wanted a winner.\n\nAyodhya  has been an issue capable of violently stirring people‚Äôs emotions and  sentiments, across the nation; recognising this Gurudev had said, ‚Äúif  the court pronounces any one community as the winner, it is going to  cause heartburn to the loser. The winner cannot enjoy in peace. There  cannot be harmony between the communities.‚Äù Perhaps this was the main  reason why the issue spent a long time in courts without a conclusion in  sight.\n\nPrior to the announcement  of the verdict, Section 144 was imposed in most parts of the country as a  precautionary measure. Gurudev released a statement requesting the  people of the country to remain peaceful and calm and not engage in  celebrations of any kind. Other religious and political leaders also  called for people to maintain peace irrespective of the verdict. It was  thus a reasonably quiet day despite the heightened anticipation and  speculation around the verdict. Why were there no riots, or  demonstrations or insensitive celebrations anywhere post the  announcement? Why is it that no community was pointing fingers at the  other? Except for a few voices who were habituated to dissent, peace and  acceptance prevailed.\n\nThis is  where I would like to share with you the little that I know of Gurudev‚Äôs  untiring and pragmatic approach that has made this phenomenal  acceptance possible.\n\nIt was 2001  .Gurudev landed in New Delhi after addressing the World Economic Forum  (WEF) in Davos. He had a meeting with the then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee  ji. At this meeting, Vajpayee ji requested Gurudev to help resolve the  Ayodhya dispute through dialogue leading to an out-of-court settlement.\n\nSubsequently,  Gurudev drove down narrow lanes towards the AIMPLB office and walked in  wanting to open communication.‚ÄúIf you have come to talk about the  Ayodhya land dispute, forget it. Even after two hours, we will be at the  same place where we begin‚Äù, said Mr. Zaffer Zilani to Gurudev. About 15  members of the PLB were there in the office. The tension in the air was  palpable. He heard them out and then started speaking.\n\nGurudev  proposed that he would have the Hindu saints come together and express  their regret for any hurt caused to the Muslim community and in turn the  Muslims could gift the land, the small piece of land which has caused  so much turmoil in the country. His presence and his words made a shift  in the whole atmosphere. In the end before leaving, he gave a hug to  each one of them. The same evening Gurudev met with the VHP people and  was trying to convince them to drop the demand for Kashi and Mathura.\n\nHe continued meeting leaders from both communities over this issue.\n\nTwo  years later, in 2003, Gurudev placed a 3-point proposal for an  out-of-court settlement to both communities. At that time, it was not  accepted.‚ÄúI have met different members of the AIMPLB separately on  various occasions. Individually they may agree to this solution but  collectively they are hesitating to take a step,‚Äù said Gurudev. A few  who were hardnosed and dogmatic opposed the proposal and said that they  preferred a judicial verdict. A one-sided victory can never bring  brotherhood. A peaceful settlement between both was essential. Without  criticizing anyone, Gurudev persevered to make them understand the  truth.\n\n‚ÄúYou have to keep trying  till you succeed, ‚Äú shared Gurudev in an interview with NDTV, ‚ÄúYou have  to keep on finding new ways, because as time changes strategies will  have to change. And at the same time, when there is a give and take  tendency between both communities it can do wonders. We have to find a  solution that will bring people together.‚Äù\n\nWhat  is the difference between judgement and mediation? Gurudev gives the  example of two parties fighting for an apple. He says, ‚ÄúJudgement is  when you cut the apple and give half to each.They may still compare and  doubt if the judgement was biased. Mediation is when you give the knife  to one and the right to choose to the other. This way they are  responsible.‚Äù\n\nFor the next fifteen  years he repeatedly met leaders from both communities highlighting the  need for harmony more than anything else.\n\nOne  evening, in early 2018, over six thousand people were waiting in  pin-drop silence in the amphitheatre at the Bangalore ashram for over  half an hour. The singing normally begins at 6:30 pm but it was well  past 7:00 on this day. In a small room adjacent to the amphitheatre over  eighty Imams from Bangalore were huddled around Gurudev who was keenly  looking into a laptop where several other Imams and prominent Muslim  leaders from Lucknow were connected. Ayodhya, India, Peace - was still  the topic.\n\nA few weeks later,  Maulana Syed Salman Husaini Nadvi, Exec. Member of the AIMPLB, Shri  Zufar Ahmad Faruqi, Chairman, UP Sunni Central Waqf Board, and religious  leaders and intellectuals from multiple organisations met Gurudev in  person following the skype call in the previous month. Several  newspapers carried their statements saying that they extended their full  support to Gurudev‚Äôs proposal for the settlement. It was unanimously  concluded that there can be no better way to resolve the issue than that  all parties agree to a mutually-agreeable settlement. They decided to  meet again on the 15th of March in Ayodhya to take the issue forward.\n\nThe  mindsets of those involved would swing back and forth , but Gurudev  patiently gave time, consolidated the scattered and diverse views of  people and focused them towards brotherhood and a peaceful solution. He  met and spoke to over five hundred Imams and several hundred Hindu  leaders in 2018 alone.\n\nWhen you  give a new point of view to a person, they need to be given time to  adjust to it. Gurudev knew this very well. He is a Master of the human  mind and knows how to guide it delicately towards decisions that bring  long term happiness for everyone.\n\nIn  March 2019, the court appointed a three-member mediation panel  including Gurudev. Several meetings with all the parties were held in  utmost confidentiality in Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh.\n\nMediation  can be successful only when all parties feel a sense of belongingness,  that you are there for them. This is what a person who comes to Gurudev  feels and this brings about transformation in subtler levels in the  person.\n\nMany times people have  commented that the efforts have failed in the past years. I would wait  to hear what Gurudev would say about it. He looked at it as one step  forward. Communication was opening up. The settlement was coming closer.\n\nFinally,  on the 9th of November 2019, the thorn in the hearts and minds of the  people of India was delicately removed by Gurudev‚Äôs sustained efforts.\n\nA  case that has been repeatedly going into review without a solution  finally came towards a verdict that was welcomed by one and all, a  verdict that draws from Gurudev‚Äôs proposal. His solutions always keep in  mind the long-term benefit of all involved. Over the years, leaders of  both communities had softened and were prepared for the settlement.\n\nI  have heard of mediators coming in to sort out small property issues and  such cases. Further it is between just two individuals or groups.  Mediation between 25 different strong-minded groups with religious  sentiments representing millions of people on an issue of long-standing  national impact is unheard of in history.\n\nThe  Supreme Court also appreciated the efforts of the mediation panel in  coming close to this historic settlement. The critical role of mediation  and meditation is undeniable.\n\nThe  European Parliament in Brussels invited Gurudev to speak about the very  same topic of mediation and meditation. They wanted to hear about his  role as a mediator.\n\nUpon meeting  Gurudev, the Former Prime Minister of Slovenia and member of European  Parliament, Alojz Peterle said, ‚ÄúVery few people believed this was  possible but it happened because someone (Gurudev) came with a different  light. It happened from the heart. Only people who have peace in  themselves can influence peaceful developments around the world.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe  can find roots of cultures of peace in many countries but we need new  ways to rediscover it and we need new leaders to help us do that. And we  have found one in your personality,‚Äù said Dace Melbarde, MEP (Member of  European Parliament) and former Minister of Culture, Latvia.\n\nWhen  the media gave credit to Gurudev for the verdict, he said‚Äù it is the  prayers and sentiments of 1.3 billion people of our country that have  been answered by the verdict.‚Äù\n\nAnother  impediment on the path of the progress of this country has been finally  removed. He wholeheartedly welcomed the historic judgement of the  Supreme court and said, ‚ÄúThis has brought joy and relief to people of  both communities from a long-standing dispute.‚Äù\n\nOne  of the toughest challenges for an individual is to forget a personal  grudge from the past. Here Gurudev has enabled innumerable leaders from  both communities to drop the past and move on, to embrace brotherhood  and harmony.\n\nOnce again, he has led by example and shown the way for bringing about peaceful long lasting solutions.\n\nAfter  Ayodhya, the pandemic was the next big issue. Before anyone could even  fathom the extent of impact, Gurudev had started planning responses and  necessary actions. Food and relief materials for crores of daily wage  labourers and migrants, relief from fear and anxiety through daily  meditations for millions around the world, trauma care and relief for  thousands of frontline workers globally, personally connecting to  hundreds each day who are on the brink of suicide ‚Äì he is responding to  every prayer that is coming up in the hearts of people. Even now,  Gurudev is on a call with the Art of Living volunteers from Tamil Nadu  planning for a massive campaign where people from every village will  come together to chant an ancient prayer that is an armour against all  physical and mental ailments and brings up the spiritual energy and  positivity. I am amazed at his focus and magnanimity. He is the epitome  of dispassion.\n\nIrrespective of  opinions of success and failure, safety or its absence, unmindful of  personal comfort, he moves unhindered at a pace that no one can match.  He clears the thorns and makes the path comfortable and smooth for us to  follow. Through his actions and wisdom he has made life a celebration  for all of us.\n\nWhen truth is honoured and celebrated, nature rejoices. This article is my attempt to celebrate the truth.\n\nSatyameva jayate.\n\nJai Guru Dev!'<br />Author: '845898'<br />id: 'i4lhvb'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: 'Why do some Hindus want to take the side of islamists so badly that building the Ram temple offends them?'<br />Body: 'Im really disappointed with my social media timeline today, despite all the celebrations some Hindus themselves are constantly sharing anti-Mandir propaganda, declaring "tHiS iS nOt mY InDia", some are retweeting pakistani and aitish taseer propaganda, openly declaring their anti- Hindu nature. One post that was shared many times on FB says "India has legitimised hatred" simply because we are retaking our structures. These people never spoke a word when the illegal mosque was standing.\n\n\nI get islamo fascist sharing kashmir narrative, anti mandir narrative, slamming Modi govt etc because one of the strongest holds they had on Indian civilisation crumbled. But Hindus like Sharmas and Iyers sharing this kinda propaganda makes me feel sad for their existence. \n\nYes they need burnol but I dont understand the psyche and logic behind them. Are they trying to impress few muslim friends ? Are they Hindu hating aethists but masquerading with Hindu names? Are they suffering from stockholm syndrome where they start falling in love with their captors? Do they think after watching 2 hollywood movies and listening to 2 english songs they have become woke and thus oppose anything that is pro majority? \n\nWhat is the root cause of this kind of behaviour?

They have been instrumental in stalling the ram mandir case in the court for 70 years in spite of overwhelming evidence that a temple existed in that spot before muslim invaders destroyed it.\n\nRe-building of Ram mandir by Hindus is a big symbol of reversal of so many *centuries* of oppression &amp; manipulation. \nHope everyone recognizes how historical and momentous this occasion is.\n\nüö© *‡§ú‡§Ø ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ* üö©'<br />Author: '845898'<br />id: 'i40d1l'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li>

<li>Title: 'Why the story of Shambuka and the Uttarakhanda is most likely interpolated.'<br />Body: "This is perhaps one of the most heavily debated and criticised part of the Ramayana, and many have used this to call Lord Rama a casteist. I believe, however, that this part could be an interpolation. The writing style of the Uttara Khanda being different to Valmiki's alone should set off some red flags but There is different evidence to this, which I shall present here(Note that this is not mine, It was on quora which I am going to put here).\n\nThe story mentions Shri Ram using Pushpak Viman to find Shambuk, however, it‚Äôs clearly mentioned in Yudhkand that the Viman was returned to Shri Kuber, who was the original owner of the Pushpak Viman. \\[Valmiki Ramayan: Yudhkand 127/62\\]\n\nValmiki Ramayan also mentions Mata Sabari, who was also Shudra from birth, but she revered as one of the most respected Tapaswi. If Shudra were not allowed to do penance in Tretayug, then why Maa Sabari was allowed?\n\nMahabharat Anugita Parv 91/37 clearly states that Brahman, Chhatriya, Vaishya and Shudra, all achieve Heaven by penance. \\[Mahabharat: Anugita Parv 91/3\\]( Note, that in this time, according to the story of Shambuka, that Shudras still couldn't attain penance during Dwapara Yuga).\n\nIn the Shambuk story, a Brahmin man lost his son because a Shudra was doing penance. But Geeta and Vedas clearly state that good/bad, happiness/suffering, success/failure are all caused by the person‚Äôs Karma (acts). So this is also faulty?\n\nShri Ram eats at various Shudra people‚Äôs homes. He calls Nishad Raj a friend and ally. In Ram Charitmanas, Shri Ram gives Bhakti Gyan to Maa Sabari (Navadha Bhakti), Kewat compares his profession to Shri Ram‚Äôs profession, all these beautiful stories clearly shows that Ram didn‚Äôt discriminate.\n\n6. Yajurved states that Shudra is a man who possesses the qualities of a brave, hardworking, loyal man, and one who does the hardest of the work.\n\nGeeta (14.3) states\n\n&gt;*catur-varnyam maya srstamguna-karma-vibhagasahtasya kartaram api mamviddhy akartaram avyayam*\n\nthat all Varnas are defined by Guna (talent) and Karma (Act). It‚Äôs not by birth. I can go on about all the great people who were Shudra but became of Chhatriya, Brahman by work. In King Janak‚Äôs Sabha, Rishi Yagyawalk clearly said that a Brahman is defined by his work, not by his birth. Same goes for every other.\n\n(And especially in this time period people would have followed a varna system, caste system)\n\nAgain, these points are form a person on quora and not me so give him credit not me."<br />Author: 'Accomplished-Ad-6524'<br />id: 'i3z8wf'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Butthurt OP</li>

<li>Title: 'About the draft EIA 2020'<br />Body: 'Post the Bhopal gas leak tragedy, the government realized the need for stronger environmental laws in order to assess the impact of industrial and infrastructure projects on our natural resources and thus the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) norms were rolled out in 1994. Under these rules, it became mandatory to seek Environmental Clearance (EC) prior to the expansion or setting up of new industrial or modernization projects like mining, thermal power plants, river valley, infrastructure (road, highway, ports, harbours and airports) etc. \n\nEarlier in March 2020, when the country was in lockdown, the GoI proposed a new draft for EIA to make the process more "transparent and expedient".\n\nActivists, especially those based in TN, contend that this draft is nothing but a rehashing of the TSR committee report on overhauling environmental laws, which was roundly rejected by the Parliamentary Standing Committee back in 2015 on the grounds that ["it would result in an unacceptable dilution of the existing legal and policy architecture established to protect our environment"](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/parliamentary-standing-committee-rejects-tsr-subramanian-report-on-environmental-laws-50577). You would also remember this as the time when that IB report "leaked" about how foreign-funded NGOs in India like Greenpeace etc are "a threat to national security and development".\n\nCut to July 2020, when Greta Thungberg\'s NGO decided to make a coordinated effort to send mails to the Environment Ministry raising concerns about the EIA draft, they were first booked under the UAPA, which was later deemed to be a "clerical" error and then further booked under the IT Act for "sending too many emails". [Their website is still blocked](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/uapa-charge-in-notice-to-environmental-group-fridays-for-future-due-to-clerical-error-delhi-police-1703716-2020-07-23)\n\nComing to the draft itself, listed below are the most controversial proposed changes -\n\n1. Post-facto clearance - Remember that Vizag gas leak tragedy in May? [That chemical plant was running without an EC for many years](https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/vizag-gas-tragedy-lg-polymers-lacked-environmental-clearance-before-chemical-gas-leak-616707) Under this new change, if LG Polymers had simply sought clearance or paid a fine before the disaster occurred, it would\'ve been a-okay. Oh and funny thing, [in an order on April 1, the Supreme Court held ‚Äúex post facto environmental clearances‚Äù contrary to law](https://www.indialegallive.com/constitutional-law-news/courts-news/sc-sets-aside-ngts-directions-regarding-ex-post-facto-environmental-clearance) but still the govt persists.\n\n2. Suo moto declaration of violation - There are two ways in which flouting of environmental laws can be punished - either the govt catches you red-handed or you self-report and pay a fine. The public can no longer report such rule-breaking. \n\n3. Strategic exemptions - In the list of projects that will not be up for a public consultation, there\'s a new and arbitrary category called "strategic projects" as decided by the Central Govt. Also, border area projects will be exempt too, where "border area" is defined as \'area falling within 100 kilometres aerial distance from the LAC with bordering countries of India." So most of the Northeast, the repository of the country‚Äôs richest biodiversity.\n\n4. Response times shortened while clearance validity extended - In a double whammy, the public only gets 20 days (from the previous 30) to peruse a proposed project plan and make objections or suggestions, if any. OTOH, most projects now enjoy a greater validity for their existing ECs, for ex - a mining company\'s EC validity has been extended 30 to 50 years while nuclear power plants have been bumped to 15 years from the previous 5. Companies also now only have to furnish environmental compliance reports annually instead of bi-annually. \n\nIn an attempt to scupper public discussion about all this, [Prakash Javadedkar went against his own ministry\'s proposal to extend public hearing period by 60 days and set the deadline for 30 June.](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/environment-impact-assessment-draft-prakash-javadekar-deadline-extension-lockdown-6476451/)Thankfully, [the Delhi HC stepped in ](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/draft-environment-impact-assessment-norms-explained-6482324/) and the new deadline is August 11.\n\nI recommend that we all do our bit by sending an email to the ministry by following the instructions [here](https://letmebreathe.in/2020/06/27/sample-letter-to-the-environment-ministry-on-draft-eia-notification-2020/)  because honestly this reads more like a draft for Make In India than for environmental protection.\n\nAlso there is no **planet B** now is there ?'<br />Author: 'Aerowisca'<br />id: 'i3im3n'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

It's the best time to start learning samskrit and here is why you should!"<br />Body: "I'll list some points as to why you HAVE to start learning samskrit NOW: \n\n1. IT'S THE AGE OF BHARAT. It is finally our age and time for us to show the world our culture and heritage and with this ever growing interest among foreigners about our culture, the onus is ON US to make sure that our culture and language is clearly understood by us so that we can teach, and to get close to understanding our culture we need to read our scriptures which are all in samskrit. So we have to make this start to get a better understanding of samskrit.\n2. NATIONAL UNITY: It is obvious that the lack of unity among many states is due to differences in languages and there is severe need of a link language. Here is where we revive the first and only pan India language, our great language samskrit ! Of course we shouldn't depend on the govt to make it our national language and cause unecessary riots, we should instead work silently in increasing the number of samskrit speakers!\n3. OVER DEPENDENCE ON ENGLISH AND ATMANIRBHARTA: English was introduced by colonial powers to replace samskrit as the pan indian language and we have successfully been destroyed by them! BUT THINGS CAN CHANGE. We can revive the mother of all our languages and once again bring greatness to Bharat!\n4. THE BEAUTY OF THE LANGUAGE: I don't think I need to tell you how beautiful the language is. All of us use MANY MANY samskrit words already since all our regional languages are blessed by samskrit. It just makes you feel great and proud to be a bharatiya naagrik! Finally we have an idnetity! \n\nPLEASE DO JOIN ME IN REVIVING SAMSKIRTAM. REMEMBER THE OBJECTIVE IS TO INCREASE THE SPEAKERS THROUGH LOVE AND NOT FORCE.   \n\n\nPeople interested in learning samskritam can join this discord server: [https://discord.gg/ENhwmvz](https://discord.gg/ENhwmvz)  \n\n\nJAYATU SAMSKRITAM!

<li>Title: "Many at times people point out a problem, but they don't tell what causes it or why it happens, so I decided to write an article upon it."<br />Body: 'Root Cause in Politics\n\nMany at times, people point out a problem and create a ruckus, as to seeing how big of a deal it is, it isn‚Äôt acknowledged that way. However, one thing that they always forget to point out is, what is the reason behind the problem, also known as the ‚ÄúRoot Cause‚Äù. This is actually a huge problem, as knowing the root cause and acknowledging it along with the problem, and not acknowledging the root cause drastically changes the outcome, I think there are a few examples, and they are quite controversial, so I will try to keep it simple and to the point.\n\nIn India, there is a common thought that the Muslim ‚Äúminority‚Äù has problems in renting homes and purchasing land.\n\nThis may or may not be, a quote actual problem, but if it is, then you also have to look at, why this happens.\n\nI think, we can also include in this how at times, women wearing hijab or men having large beards, quote have to tolerate racism.\n\nMost people would say that this is wrong, and uncultured, but if you look a bit at the root cause, it may clarify things.\n\nSo, first I would like to justify the part regarding renting.\n\nSee, in many places including India, UK or the USA, you have many Muslim ‚Äúminorities‚Äù who may rebel or protest against the government, even though the government‚Äôs decision may be right.\n\nSo obviously, somebody wouldn‚Äôt want to rent their homes, to somebody who rebels and protests against the government, right?\n\nI am not saying that everybody rebels, but a large majority do, and at most times we generalize things, so why create an exception for this?\n\n\nAs for the Hijab or the beard, it is plain and simple in my opinion, in the modern cities of India, UK and the USA, you don‚Äôt normally see people going around with religious symbols on them, or any sign, to make clear to people that are religious. So, when one specific religion does that, it makes it look out of the ordinary, definitely if somebody were to come in with a priest suit into the office, you can‚Äôt not expect to get some weird looks right?\n\n\nSo that is basically my point, before blabbering on upon something like Muslims are unsafe in India or USA, look at the root cause, look at why people do that, and why they quote aren‚Äôt looked as quote on quote equals.\xa0\n\nBecause, they very much are equal, as these countries are democracies, and secular. Though, there may be some problems with secularism in India, that is a topic for another time.'<br />Author: 'Generocide'<br />id: 'i2fu31'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li>

And I was surprised to see how every TV channel was presenting the same program and how the preparations for Bhoomi Poojan to be held in Ayodhya on 5 August.  Where will be the ritual will be performed, where will attendess sit?\n\nLet me remind you, of 120 people attending this event the Most Prominent names are as mentioned below.\n\n-Yogi Adityanath, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh  \n- Rajnath Singh, Defence Minister  \n- Amit Shah, Home Minister  \n- PM Narendra Modi  \n- Trustees of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirtha Kshetra Trust\n- Many Prominent Figures who have helped that payed way to This fortunate day (name cannot be disclosed for security reasons, A¬Æog¬•a $‚Ç¨tu app $p¬•|ng , \\#3lp.)\n\nAnd you know how the security agencies had issued an alert about how anti-India elements are planning to do something on the same day? It is Highly likely that they will target Bhoomi poojan based upon the people attending it.\n\nI don't understand how someone can be so stupid? Sharing sensitive information on television?\n\nIt's similar to how Barka Dutt and Party reported during the attack of 26/11, Kargil war and recent scuffle between China and India. \n\nOn 26/11, their live coverage led to more loss of life as these live feeds were used by the perpetrators, the mastermind sitting in pakistan, to inform the terrorist of the possible sites where people could be hiding and possible retaliation by Our Brave Armed forces.\n\nIn Kargil war, Barkha carried an iridium satellite phone which could be tracked by enemy forces despite knowing it's consequences.\n\nMore recently, at leh, amidst of border tension between expansionist China and Unyeilding India. Reporting on the activities of security forces to the last details which is best best to gathering a bunch of people with exceptional defence background and making their own version of War Room.\n\nWar room.\n\nLa Indian PM, HM, DM, CDS and Chief Commanders of three forces (Army, Air Force, Navy)\n\n    Insert meme * to main job Chod du? *\n\nIn the end, I would like to say. This govt has comeback with a greater majority in 2019 and please dont try to undermine the word Majority. It is not just a word, it a faith of 1.35 billion People whom participated in election, and they believe and have faith in the current govt that the Government will let anybody mess with India let alone escape without any consequences if one tries to do so.\n\nRant over but you should read the paragraph below as it is actually a news.\n\nPS: they should have covered the actual news like OpIndia is doing.

Or just neutral?'<br />Body: 'I recently visited two of South Indian circlejerks, namely r/kuttichevuru and r/Lal_Salaam ..i found them to be extremely neutral and neither left or right leaning.. it seems both r made to make fun of their respective ruling parties against the current flow.\n\nI saw healthy discussions but in both there seemed to be a hatred of bjp supporters as sanghis or paramboothries... . I know there are many users here in r/chodi who are part of either of them..so can anyone explain what those subs are about, or are they just for fun?\n\nP.S. I couldnt get any telugu or kannada equivalent circlejerks or subs, plz comment if any..would love to visit them'<br />Author: 'Sakata-shi'<br />id: 'i1siya'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li>

<li>Title: 'Need advice: Kesari Tours not issuing refund'<br />Body: 'Need Advice: Tour operator not issuing refund\n\nI had booked a tour through Kesari Tours Pvt Ltd and had paid full amount. But due to the pandemic the tour got cancelled. I had applied for refund and also received a refund approval message from them in March first week well before the lockdown. But they still haven‚Äôt refunded my money nor are they replying to my emails. All their customer care lines are out of service. Such unprofessional behaviour was not expected from such a reputed company. The agent in my town keeps saying that Mumbai offices have not reopened. Are they genuinely not operating or just buying time? Any advice, I am beginning to lose patience.'<br />Author: 'geekygujju'<br />id: 'i1bh3m'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

The book was written in 1906 and in those days, "Assam" referred to nearly all of NE in general, so you can learn about the history of other NE states as well. Please don\'t judge the book by the name of it\'s author. It is fairly unbiased in my opinion.'<br />Author: 'pandawarrior2000'<br />id: 'i144in'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li>
