<ol><li>Title: "PSA: Jalandhar-Brampton train DOESN'T EXIST! 😭 got SCAMMED 😭"<br />Body: '😭 tears rolling on my cheeks as i write this. I want to tell my story so that others won\'t get duped like me 😣 \n\nSince my child hood, I\'m a big of canada. When i was just 3,i drew my first maple tree leaf on a drawing book my unkill from kanada sent me. Before ABCD i have learned the spelling of K A N A D A. Canda is my divine destiny. \n\nAfter my intermediate in 3rd world country of India, i applied for a diploma course in African pottery in canada. My application was mysteriously rejected even though i explained kanada is my destiny. I deduce from this incident that mudi must have played a part in it, he is after all friends with trump who is anti immigration. \n\nSome years passed and my application keeps getting rejected. I emailed mudi (mudi@india.gov.in).he did not reply because he is a coward. \n\nI finally took the red pill. I DECIDED to defeat mudi at any cost. I opened 50 Twitter accounts and called out mudi and retweeted rahul gandhi\'s every tweets. \n\nThen the farm laws came, for the first time, i left my state of punjab to fight the fastism in delhi itself. Thought it may not have yielded that much, mysterious donors donated us daaru biryani through our stay. I later came to know the name of our donor, some guy they called **kejru**.. \n\nDuring my stay, i have seen a poster on a wall advertising visa to Canada. Even though i know mudi is blocking my future. I gave it a a try. A meet was set up the next day by a ditch near singhu border\\s make-shift pucca gym. \n\n---\n\nThe man i met looked professional and well dressed. He said he had been to Canada and showed me some pics. \n\nHe let me in on a grand project that is being developed on *need-to-know* basis. A train is being built from **india** to **canada**, as a part of QUAD. The purpose of this railway is to transport very heavy equipment with each other as a part of tech sharing. \n\nThe train is being called **SNOWPIERCER** and fully runs runs on nuclear power. \n\nhe said that Mudi used his influence to use Russian railway system as relay. A new bridge has been built from alaska to Russian tip. \n\nA train requires staff and i have been offered a job for a price of 50 lakhs Only.\n \n---\n\nI had a lot on my mind when i returned to singhu camp. I opened my imported (from canada) macbook and opened google map and selected "globe view"\n\nIt it indeed true. one can indeed cross russia into alaska and go to canada. I zoomed in to see the pictures of brige, but the internet is very slow because our comrades *burned down all jio 4g towers*. apparently they cause autism or something but some say it will bankrupt ambani and adani. airtel network is trash and probably overloaded.\n\nfrom my blurred macbook screen i could make out a small line, that should be the bridge after all, what else could it be..\n\nThis is the chance of my life. \n\nI parted with my comrades at the camp, they seem to be preoccupied with something something *redfort*. I don\'t care, I\'m ecstatic, I\'m going to my home country. \n\nI came back to my village and convinced my family to sell our ancestor land. It only fetched us 30 lakhs. I also sold off my cows and Buffalo\'s. Took a mortgage on our house to raise the remaining 20 lakhs. \n\nI asked my agent on mode of payment, he said payment gateway is down so bring it in cash. We met a few days later and i handed him hefty bag containing bundles of 2000 notes. He handed me a color printed paper which is my ticket. \n\n**Jalandhar(India) - Brampton(Canada)**\n\n**Crew Quarters - Q23**\n\n\nSatisfied, i thanked him and started packing up. \n\nToday is the day of my journey, it\'s past 8:00PM and there\'s no sight of **SNOWPIERCER** on track 1 at jalandhar railway station. The station staff are not helpful, they are saying no such thing exists. I don\'t understand. \n\n\nGuys, i have a feeling i have been scammed and mudi\'s agencies like CBI ED did not prevent this from happening. My agent is not lifting his phone. My parents are calling me to check if I\'m aboard snowpiercer. I have nothing to go back to. I just opened google maps to see my route once again, i cant see any bridge in between canada and alaska. they seem to small islands packed tightly that gave a illusion of a shape ridge shape on blurring.\n\nI decided to rest for today on platform, i still have hope. Before that, i decided to write this post just in case.\n\nGood luck everyone. \n\n(satirical essay)'<br />Author: 'a45ed6cs7s'<br />id: 'm4bwr9'<br />Flair ::HighIQ: Randia Simulation</li>

As we all know youngsters want to be woke, oppose everything and they just like to bash the government espcially bjp. Twitter is filled with left leaning people. Most of the youngsters in Maharashtra also hate bjp. These ongoing farmers laws. So based on these facts I knew I am gonna hear lots of criticism towards bjp. \n\nBut to my surprise almost all students spoke in support of bjp/modi. Only two students spoke against the government. I was shocked.\n\nI think on the internet left leaning crowd is much more than right wingers but on ground most of the people believe in bjp who don't advertise their support.

<li>Title: "India won't become a muslim majority country"<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur worry is that muslims will eventually surpass hindus due to higher growth rate and treat hindus as kaffirs right ? That isn\'t going to happen.\n\n  \n[https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/5bsICkXvl4t4hXSewk8bkN/Four-out-of-five-Indians-will-still-be-Hindu-even-when-Musli.html](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/5bsICkXvl4t4hXSewk8bkN/Four-out-of-five-Indians-will-still-be-Hindu-even-when-Musli.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nDate : 13.6.2018\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nFears of a rising Muslim population numerically overwhelming India’s Hindu majority seem alarmist and overdone any way you look at it. Indeed, if the growth rates trends seen from the latest census data sustain, Muslims may actually account for a lower proportion of India’s population than at their peak in 2011.The 2011 census puts the Muslim population at 17.22 crore or 14.22% of India’s total population. Some see the Hindu majority falling below the 80% mark as a cause for concern.\n\n# But this ignores the fact that growth in Muslim population is actually falling faster than the Hindu population growth rate.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Base-case scenario\n\n( 404 error, graph not found)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nA scenario analysis using different growth rates shows that Indian Muslims becoming the largest community is quite far-fetched. Assume that the growth rate pattern from 2001-2011, which has been used to suggest that Hindus are somehow falling behind, will persist. Population growth is calculated using an exponential growth rate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nThe Hindu growth rate is 1.55% annually, while Muslims’ is 2.2%. The figures for the previous decade (1991-2001) are an annual 1.8% and 2.6%, respectively. If this decline in growth rates persists (both continue to grow at slower rates), both Hindu and Muslim populations will hit a peak in 2061.  \n**Then, Muslims will number 29.24 crore and Hindus 140.25 crore. India’s overall population at the time would be 173.03 crore with the Muslim proportion at 16.89%. Hindus will actually account for 81.06% at that time.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n\n\n# High Hindu, poor Muslim growth\xa0( Highly unlikely )\n\nScenario assumes Hindu growth rate increases at best ever pace, similar to pattern seen in 1971-81 period.\xa0 Muslim growth rate is assumed to decline\xa0 similar to its\xa0 worst ever phase\xa0(2001-2011). \xa0**But population will have to exceed UN projections for this to happen.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n( Graph is supposed to show, but Error 404 has occurred )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The second scenario** we have looked at is where the *growth rate of the Hindu population doesn’t fall like it did during 2001-11. Instead, growth picks up at the best pace it has ever seen (from 2.12 to 2.56% during 1971-81).* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*And change in Muslim growth rate is the worst-ever as it has been in 2011. Assuming all else stays constant*,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n**Hindus will be 219.95 crore and growing, when the Muslim population stabilizes in 2061. Then, 87.03% of India’s population would be Hindu.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Poor Hindu, high Muslim growth ( IMPOSSIBLE TO HAPPEN )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nScenario assumes Muslim growth rate increases at best ever pace (same as 1981-91 period) and Hindu growth rate fall similar to worst ever phase(2001-2011). Muslims will overtake Hindu population by 1991-**but India\'s total population would have to grow to nearly twice the UN projections for this to happen.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n( Error 404, graph not found )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe also looked at a third case where the reverse happens. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Consider the Hindu growth rate slowing at the worst rate ever, which was in the decade till 2011, and Muslims growth rate increasing in the same way it did for the decade ending in 1991 (from 2.68 to 2.85%, or 17 basis points). One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n**The Hindu population will stabilize in 2071 at 139.43 crore. But Muslims will only account for 91.68 crore of the population or 39.21%.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nIt will be by **2091** that Muslims will outnumber Hindus in India if the growth rate increases by 17 basis points every decade. *But for that pattern to persist, Muslim population will have to grow to 182.91 crore and the Muslim exponential growth rate at that point comes to be over 3.54%.*\n\n  \n\n\n# “That will never happen. The highest exponential growth rates for population do not generally exceed 2%. All communities see a reduction in population growth as the level of education and development increase," said S.K. Singh, professor at the Department of Mathematical Demography and Statistics at the International Institute for Population Studies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To put it in context, global population growth rate peaked out at 2.19% in 1962-63, according to Geoffrey Gilbert’s World Population: A Reference Handbook. Moreover, India’s population would be 311.41 crore by 2091 in the third scenario.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nThe United Nations has projected India’s population to grow to 170.53 crore by 2050, and then decline to 165.97 by 2100. While that is not gospel truth, it also suggests that neither the scenario of Hindu population growing to 219.95 crore, nor the Muslim population growing to 182.91 crore are likely to come true.The UN’s 2050 figure, however, is close to the base-case scenario which estimates a total population of 173.03 crore by 2061. Thus, the scenario where Hindus outnumber Muslims 4:1 seems most likely of the three. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe assumption for that scenario is that growth rates from 2011 will decline in the same way that they did between 2001 and 2011. Why? Simply because literacy and economic well-being are improving, although at a debatable pace.“The pace of convergence depends on a number of socio-economic, political and programme factors, and the process will be hastened with the spread of mass education especially amongst women and girls and a sustained reduction in poverty across all population groups," says the Sachar Committee report released in 2006.'<br />Author: 'itisverynice'<br />id: 'm3k15l'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'How to become Kshatriya -Mysore Case Study'<br />Body: 'Kings and rulers often tried to legitimate the superiority of royal houses over the people they ruled by inventing foreign origins and divine lineages. This is called \'Conundrum of the King\'s authority\' because of the inherent contradiction of them being outsiders and at the same time rulers of the local society. \n\nThe caste of the Wodeyars of Mysore is called  \'Arasu\' / \'Urs\' caste. It means King. According to legend Yaduraya Wodeyar, a young Chandravamshi prince of Dwarka and descendant of Lord Krishna was invited by the Vijaynagar Emperor to rule a small region around the Kaveri River in Karnataka in 1400 CE. When Yaduraya arrives at the village of Hadadana near Mysore, he learns that the local Palegar had renounced his kingship to become an ascetic and that his daughter was being harassed by the army chief Marasa Nayaka . Yaduraya kills the army chief and marries the princess to become the King of Mysore. \n\nThis legend served multiple purposes. It established a chandravamshi kshatriya lineage, it established a connection with the indigenous people through the princess and it could also explain why the descendants of Lord Krishna worshipped the local village goddess \'Chamundeshwari\' as their clan god (Kula Devi). Moreover the villain of the story Marasa Nayaka was a low caste Toreya, this helped further emphasise the pure-blooded superiority of the Wodeyars.\n\nHowever historians noted a lot of inconsistencies. It was extremely far-fetched that the Vijaynagar Emperor Harihara II would invite Yaduraya from Distant Dwarka. Yaduraya would have to risk his life and travel through two hostile Muslim Kingdoms, the Gujarat Sultanate and Brahmani Kingdom to reach Vijaynagar. Epigraphy mentioning the Wodeyars began only 150 years after 1400 CE. The legend of Yaduraya made its advent only in the later half of 17th century. Different versions of the legend had been fabricated by the poets commissioned by  Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar.\n\nHistorians like David Leeming and Aya Ikegame instead suggest that the Wodeyars were local feudal lords and that the \'Urs\' had extremely indigenous origins. \n\nIn the 17th century the \'Vokkaligas\'/\'Gowdas\', the landed gentry and agriculturist caste of Karnataka had the most number of ruling families. Chikkadevaraja strategically united the other feudal lords under the \'Urs\' caste and divided them into hierarchical groups based on their relationship with Vokkaligas and the size of their feudal domains. The Vokkaligas were systematimatically eliminated from amongst the ruling classes. \n\nThen Chikkadevaraja violently persecuted the Lingayats (a community of shaivites of diverse caste origins, that politically dominated North Karnataka) who had risen in insurrection. An invitation was sent to all the Lingayat priests to meet the Raja at the great temples of Nunjengod, in order to discuss the conduct of their follower. Executioners who were lying in wait slaughtered  400 priests. Orders were sent to destroy over 700 Lingayat mutts on the same day. \n\nNobuhiri Ota says the Urs including the Wodeyars belonged to not only the peasant caste but were also from other castes. The Urs adopted vegetarianism, and Sanskrited themseleves as Kshatriyas. But the local Kannada Brahmins refused to coronate the Wodeyars and so they had to import a group of “Tamil Brahmins” from Srirangam to officiate the ceremony.  \n\nThe Vokkaligas and Lingayats considered the Wodeyars of an inferior cowherd caste (possibly even potter caste). Since the Wodeyars did not have kinship with the local elites, their power penetration in local arenas was severely limited. \n\nRoyal schools were set up to train the young urs elite (anglicise them) and courses included history (British version), geography, arithmetic (Traditionally mathematical knowledge was considering unnecessary for Kshatriyas), horse riding and cricket. While this improves the status of the rich urs. The gap between the poor and rich urs grew. \n\nThe wodeyars realised that it was pointless to try to convert the Urs into a powerful landed aristocracy and instead tried unsuccessfully to educate the poorer sections of their own caste members to expand their political power beyond the palace administration.  English boarding schools were also made available for poorer urs to create a gentleman class . But the poorer urs lacked the political ambition to return to the village and instead preferred jobs such as clerks and officers in the city. So mysore kingdom finally resorted to a decentralised administration, taking immense care not to ruffle the sentiments of the dominant landed gentry at the local level.\n\nQuoting James Manor "The Lingayats and Vokkaligas enjoyed an unwritten and unspoken but very real promise of non-interference from the states princely rulers who came from a cow-herding jati-indeed, some believe that they were originally potters, an even humbler caste-and who now claimed Kshatriya status."\n\nIn Part 2: I shall continue the story of how the Wodeyars through matrimonial alliances tried to buttress their mythological origin. \n\n\nReferences:-\n\nIkegame, Aya.

Our British masters have conquered Kabul on the strength of these weak Indian fighters and have put them to use in winning over India itself. Even though the British hesitate to admit it, they have themselves lost many battles against these ‘weak’ Hindus of Maharashtra and equally ‘weak’ Sikhs of the Punjab. Whatever toughness and bravery the Indians may have today, no doubt, is less than what they had in the past. Many years of subjugation have blunted their power.

<li>Title: 'White people aren’t Aryans: Puranic explanation of what happened after the collapse of the IVC'<br />Body: 'I’m reposting the following after rewriting it and making it more clear. I’d earlier posted it on Indiaspeaks but it didn’t generate much interest. I hope it helps you guys handle white supremacists who claim they gave us (a bunch of uncivilised tribals) the Vedas. \n\nA reddit post in a edgy left wing Indian sub (You can find it by searching for Pargiter), got me interested in Ancient Indian History. And when I read it, a lot of puzzles fell in place. His work not only explains how we got the Steppe a.k.a Aryan gene. But also beautifully explains the ‘out of india’ theory and is in line with many Indian Historians who have rejected Aryan Invasion theory too.\n\nThe author says that in India post the IVC collapse there were the non-aryan kings and non-aryan Brahmins (Like Agastya and Kashyapa). The most important of these were the Ishkvaku/Suryavamsha Kshatriyas, located in Ayodhya, the family to which Ram belonged to.\nhttps://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.279548/page/n313/mode/2up?q=non-aryan\n\nHe says the steppe gene/aryan gene was spread across the country by another tribe, the ones who we refer to as the aila/chandravamshi lineage Kshatriyas. Krishna and the Pauravas belong to this tribe. These people did not have a separate Brahmin class initially. But they developed one later.\n\nI believe the Aila/Aryan/lunar race were descendants of a pre-aryan race ( like the Ishkvakus ) who were already very steppe enriched. (whether this was due to mixing with steppe males/females I do not know).  This also explains why the Jats even today have the highest steppe component in the country. The Kuru kingdom, a chandravamshi kingdom was located in present day Haryana/Punjab. Perhaps the Jats being farmers stayed put in the north west preserving their genetics, while the other castes through admixture with their corresponding non aryan communities diluted their steppe genes. (Kshatriyas formed alliances through marriage, Brahmins travelled to spread their Vedic knowledge and Vaishyas travelled for business).\n\nHe says the non-aryan Brahmins who composed the early vedas also seeked the patronage of the Aila/lunar kings who had conquered most of India except the eastern UP, Bihar region. When they moved west from East they recorded the rivers in that order, this is in line with the arguments most Indian historians use to discard Ayan invasion by saying the rig Veda mentions rivers in the east first and then west.\n\nThe unique thing about Chandravamshi Kshatriyas was that many of their Kshatriyas became Kshatriya Brahmins and some even renounced Kshatriyahood to become Brahmins (The most famous of these being Vishwamitra). This was surprisingly a smooth transition and only occasionally was it opposed by the Brahmins when they differed in ideologies (Vasishta and Vishwamitra had a fall out because of this).  But this improved the status of Brahmins in general. The mixing of the lunar race Kshatriyas with the non aryan Brahmins led to the steppe enrichment of Brahmins. \n\nThe solar and lunar tribes often fought each other and this killed off many Kshatriyas. The first solar king to stop the Haihya aryans was Ram and the last was Sagara,  the Brahmins who later wrote these wars down recorded it as Parashurama killing Kshatriyas 21 times.\nhttps://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.279548/page/n275/mode/2up?q=Twenty+one\n\nThe non-aryan suryavamshis and the aryan chandravamshis probably spoke different Indo-European languages.  The lunar race spoke an inner indo European language (Sanskrit) while the Suryavamshis probably spoke an outer Indo European language (Like Pali), the conquests of the lunar race led to sanskritisatiion of the outer indoeuropean languages like it did for the Dravidian languages.\nNote: Outer Indo European languages are  those which are supposed to have predated Sanskrit in India\nhttps://www.brownpundits.com/2021/03/01/the-fair-skinned-sintashta-folks-did-not-spread-indo-aryan-languages-in-india/ \n\nThis also explains why Marathi is the closest modern Indian language we have to Sanskrit. According to Pargiter the lunar hahihyas launched raids from Southern Malwa (Present day Maharastra) across India and on the ishkvakus  much like the Marathas many centuries later.\n\nEventually the lunar dynasty dominated and invaded most of India, they led to sanskritisation of India. Their steppe enriched Brahmins and Kshatriyas would have mixed with the Brahmins and Kshatriyas of other regions leading to the steppe enrichment of these communities across India. This also explains why the term ‘Arya’ came to mean ‘noble’. It was because the Aila tribe quickly expanded and became the noble/elite class. \n\nAfter aryanization of India, a group of Aryans moved out of India to give rise to the Iranians and took some Indic traditions along with them.\nhttps://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.279548/page/n307/mode/2up?q=Iranian\n\nAccording to the Bhagvad Gita and Matsya Purana Shraddhadeva was the king of the Dravida Desa. And he is the progenitor of both Aila and Ishkvaku. Technically both solar and lunar lines are dravidian in origin. (Perhaps they diverged branched off from the Dravidian IVC tribe when migrating into the subcontinent after the collapse of the IVC civilisation.\n\nNote: Pargiter leans heavily towards the Puranas and Mahabharata because he feels the Vedas and Ramayana were exaggerated and embellished by Brahman Rishis who had a bad sense of history and current affairs because they were isolated from civilisation. He says that Kshatriyas had a stronger necessity to accurately record their lineages and their accomplishments in the Puranas.

<li>Title: 'IMPORTANT: Why Jati/Varna is not a part of Sanatana Dharma'<br />Body: 'Hindonts, even right wingers, have for several millennia believed that varna was always a part of Sanatana Dharma. I am here to tell you all that it never was (nope, not even a little bit).  The modern day Hindontism has almost nothing to do with what our ancestors actually practiced.  We always say that the Vedas are the real heart of Sanatana Dharma, but we do not even know what is in them let alone practice what is in them.  \n\nThe varnas are only mentioned once in the entirety of the four Vedas (in the Purusha Suktam), yes, JUST ONCE.  If we look deeper, we realize that even this one mention of varna was put in much later.  These are some quotes I found (yes, most are rice bags but this just solidifies my argument since they have everything to gain by us being divided).\n\n*V. Nagarajan believes that it was an "interpolation" to give "divine sanction" to an unequal division in society that was in existence at the time of its composition. He states "The Vedic Hymns had been composed before the Varna scheme was implemented. The Vedic society was not organized on the basis of varnas. The Purush Sukta might have been a later interpolation to secure Vedic sanction for that scheme".* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*As compared with by far the largest part of the hymns of the Rigveda, the Purusha Sukta has every character of modernness both in its diction and ideas. I have already observed that the hymns which we find in this collection (Purusha Sukta) are of very different periods.*\n\n—\u2009[John Muir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Muir_(indologist))\n\n \n\n*That the Purusha Sukta, considered as a hymn of the Rigveda, is among the latest portions of that collection, is clearly perceptible from its contents.*\n\n—\u2009[Albrecht Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_Weber) \n\n \n\n*That remarkable hymn (the Purusha Sukta) is in language, metre, and style, very different from the rest of the prayers with which it is associated. It has a decidedly more modern tone, and must have been composed after the Sanskrit language had been refined.*\n\n—\u2009[Henry Thomas Colebrooke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Thomas_Colebrooke) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, the true, unadulterated Vedas do not even mention the varna system nor does it mention the four varnas AT ALL.  Our pUrvajAs called themselves AryAs and that is what we should call ourselves as well.  There never was any Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, or Dalits.  This might shatter your world-view but that is because we have been living a lie for several millennia.\n\nNow, let us look at the Manusmrti, or at least the version we have with us today, which is rife with hatred toward "lower castes" (don\'t try to deny this, read the text).  Knowing that the Vedas do not even mention the varnas, why is that a main theme in the Manusmrti and later texts?  Looking at things logically, Vaivasvata Manu (Manu which literally means Man), was the king of Dravida.  After the flood wiped out humanity and he was the only one saved, he reproduced with Shraddha and propagated humanity for this Manvantara.  \n\nModern day Hindontism believes that all Brahmanas are descendants of the Sapta Rshi and everyone else (all the other varnas) are descendants of Manu.  Why would Manu, the King of Dravida and the progenitor of the "lower castes", denigrate his sons and descendants so badly?  Where is the logic in this?  There is no logic and there is certainly not any truth.  All of our texts whether it is the Mahabharata (including the Gita), Vedas, etc have been tampered with extensively.\n\nYou might ask what scumbags would do this and how would they benefit.  The answer is that some treacherous priests wanted to solidify their "superiority" and ensure the same for their children and future descendants.  These traitors went as far as altering our Holy texts (even the Vedas) to further their agenda.  The consequences of that was not just the immense suffering of fellow Aryas who were deemed to be inferior, but the subjugation of our civilization by the desert cults.\n\nOnly Kshatriyas and to some degree Brahmanas were allowed to pick up weapons against the peaceful hordes.  Combined, they make up around 15% of all Aryas.  Varnas also splintered further into Jatis/clans.  All of whom despised one another and could not see that they were all Aryas.  When Cchatrapathi Shivaji Maharaja forcefully unified believers, he allowed all believing men to serve in his military regardless of this made-up concept called varna/jati.  He started the reconquest of AryAvarta and brought us back from the brink of extinction. What was his reward by filthy, treacherous, castist priests for his undying devotion to the Devas?  They would not coronate him as Chhatrapati since his ancestors were Shudras (again, a made-up concept).  These filthy traitors would rather be masters among slaves than be their own masters, free of peaceful rule. They were the ultimate cucks and bootlickers.\n\nI write this because varna and jati have brought our civilization to its knees. It is a poison and we gain nothing by bowing down to it.  It is why we have dozens if not hundreds of political parties.  It is why despite centuries of fighting amongst ourselves and letting peacefuls and rice bags screw our women and destroy our temples for centuries, we have let a leftist party rule us for six decades and why Tamilnadu and other states will never be ruled by BJP despite being majority Hindont.  \n\nKnow one thing. Despite leftist scumbags pretending to be against this evil and false concept of jati, they ABSOLUTELY F\'ING LOVE IT. I remember watching a news show with that filthy Burqa Butt where a VirAt Arya was talking about uniting all believers regardless of their jati.  That filthbag Butt lost it and kept attacking him for wanting to rid caste discrimination.  This is because jati is their biggest weapon, and it isn\'t even a weapon they have to wield.  Hindont society wields it for them.\n\nVarna is the biggest enemy of AryAvarta.

By sheer luck, we come in contact with Mr. Ahmad Balti and his daughter Sherine Balti who also waned to promote their culture (which generally gets overshadowed with Ladakhi culture). I will divide this post in 2 parts: first about the video and seconds about the tool used for this video.\n\n**Part 1**:\n\nDo you know Balti people of India got freedom from Pakistani invaders in 1971 and are fearlessly patriotic. I have made a small video (target audience 10-15 yrs) based on pictures and  videos available:\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/man-of-panda3d/Balti\\_video\\_memeer/blob/main/Balti%20-%20India.mp4](https://github.com/man-of-panda3d/Balti_video_memeer/blob/main/Balti%20-%20India.mp4)\n\nYoutube: [https://youtu.be/ELx9iHNEqtQ](https://youtu.be/ELx9iHNEqtQ)\n\nThe story of the video is at [https://github.com/man-of-panda3d/Balti\\_video\\_memeer/blob/main/stories/gilgit\\_video.txt](https://github.com/man-of-panda3d/Balti_video_memeer/blob/main/stories/gilgit_video.txt) \n\nIf you want to help, would like to extent this story, addon any extra model/ action - we (me personally and our Balti countrymen too) will be grateful.\n\n**Part 2**:\n\nThis video is made from MeMeer ([https://github.com/man-of-panda3d/memeer](https://github.com/man-of-panda3d/memeer)). The reason for this tool (python3, panda3d, ffmpeg) creation was:\n\n1. We wanted to make videos of places and people which are geographically distant and otherwise costly (T&amp;M wise) to visit.\n2. We also wanted  to make videos in house (as in not uploading videos/ pics to other sites as most probably content will not be owned by us), free from all royalty/ watermarks, with unlimited iterations with options for motion graphics, 3d/2d animation, subtitles, picture and video elements available in public domain or allowed to use\n3. Story is the code: Keep the story in simple English (the person of the regions can change the video and do modification by himself as much as possible)\n4. Advanced users (as some of you are very well) can create models and animations (in blender for example and converted to panda3d) and use them liberally in the video, frame by frame, and pixel by pixel\n5. For simple educational videos, motion graphics are a great way and have been shown for ice drafting in above video\n6. Support for audio has not been included as yet, though it is expected to be simple change.\n\nHonestly, there is a lot still needs to be done, but with everything in life, this tool takes a backseat. \n\nDo you think something like this will help you? Would you like to use it? Do you have any plans for making such videos on various cultures? \n\nThanks in advance for your comments :)'<br />Author: 'assholistic'<br />id: 'lxfqac'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>

Drona did not reply the correct Dharma on friendship to him. So do we assume that this is the truth?"<br />Author: 'Hindustanibhau_copy1'<br />id: 'lxavga'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'The govt needs to do two things to bring people out of poverty. First is providing jobs with decent pay. The second thing is ensuring the price of goods is low. Those 2 things need to work together to ensure a decent living. What do you guys think of this idea?'<br />Body: "Today one could be employed with a pay of 30000 rupee/ month. But if the cost of goods are high then even a person with a job and such salary  is still under poverty. The problem becomes do you bring in more competition or efficiency to reduce the price of goods. Both have their ups and down. With increased competition comes lower prices and jobs. But at the same time the risk of failure and exploitation is high as companies fight to survive. But with increased efficiency there is Job loss as more things get automated or standardized at the hands of lower goods prices. Also the idea of businesses having to bring in stellar growth in profit needs to stop. 1-2% profit is okay. The higher the profit that means the lower the labour cost and other cost that may indirectly generate more jobs. May it be in production, transportation etc. Today not just India but the entire faces a conondrum where inflation is skyrocketing. But people's salary is still not rising in accordance with inflation."<br />Author: 'Legionoo7'<br />id: 'lx0dkq'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
