<li>Title: 'The Greatest Heist in Indian History. How Indian History was changed &amp; We didn’t even notice. PART 1:THE LOST EON 6TH CENTURY B.C TO 1174 A.D'<br />Body: "Remember those long-staying, TV-remote hogging, serial TV-serial watching distant relatives who used to arrive unannounced when you were a kid. And then stopped you from watching cricket in favour of their crappy TV serial. What were your feelings towards them? Whatever it was, it did not resemble love and affection.\xa0 Now replace those crummy, intractable relatives of yore with your school subject of History or Social Sciences. Weren’t your feelings towards History kinda similar? I stake all the contents of\xa0 my nearly empty wallet, that at least for the most of you, it was. \n\n[ However, There is one thing that tops the 'I hate' list by a distance.](https://preview.redd.it/ubnmqj9riny61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04e904cd0722f66b2f466be8aa821df019e95543)\n\nHistory for most of us, was always a major impediment, an obstacle, an immovable object opposing our unstoppable drive towards knowledge ( Read Maths and Science). Useless questions like\xa0 ‘how does Babar’s fun and frolic in 1476 affect my future’ were raised, without an iota of\xa0 hope for a definite answer. What we used to get was a growl or a scowl or perhaps both. What we could only do was utter the choicest expletives under our breath, memorize those never ending dates and practice our artistic talents on the unfortunate photographs of the great souls printed in our textbooks.\n\n[ How will this dead dude help me get ahead in my life?](https://preview.redd.it/f1ifznmfjny61.png?width=1537&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=921e5549607b43e92d066613c9352f6d80226f5b)\n\nIn our academic pecking order, Maths and Science always figured at the top,\xa0 subjects that we had to master. History mostly figured somewhere at the bottom of this list, lower than drawing, craft, value education and even Aayo Naga perhaps. Has our monumental indifference towards History enabled our educationists and academicians to disfigure, hell mutilate our own history and actually get away with it? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v7k73d17kny61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f5f38ff193a5e3cfd4d355b0ab6627935592aa8\n\n Let me begin this by recalling a small conversation with a tenth grader relative of mine.\n\n This is India’s history from that persons point of view\n\n1. Harappans were the first people in India, and they had a fetish for building abnormally large bath-tubs.\n2. Their asses were then kicked by the some unknown invading Aryans.\n3. Somewhere down the line, Alexander and his badass gang of Greeks came calling.\n4. Chandragupta Maurya with his adviser Chanakya, did some awesome 420giri to take over from the Greeks.\n5. They were then\xa0 succeeded by the Guptas who brought the ‘Golden Age’ with them.\n6. Mahmud of Ghazni, however, looted all that gold. He needed a sum total of 17 visits to complete his gold quest.\n7. Mohammad Ghauri followed him with similar intentions, but decided to avoid the trouble and simply stay back. And then he died.\n8. He left his slave Qutub-ud-din Aibak to do all the ruling. His most significant achievement was to build one pointless tower.\n9. Then came a Muslim queen, underlining our credentials in female liberation.\n10. It was then the turn of Tughlaq and his gang of idiots. They moved national capitals around because they hated the weather.\n11. From somewhere, Babar, a descendant of a lame, one eyed king from Central Asia landed in India.\n12. He and his sons, calling themselves Mughals,\xa0 ruled India for the next 350 years.\n13. Their party came to an end when Englishmen arrived, redcoats and all, and took a strong fancy to our country.\n\nI am not making the above stuff up. Of course, I might have taken liberties with some of the descriptions, but then this was more-or-less what a tenth grader summarized about pre-British Indian history. I would have appreciated this individuals grasp of Indian history if not for the fact that this version is completely and utterly **bullshit.**\n\nYes IT IS\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3rzwuqchkny61.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=febb4986363a232e15bbcb7c4067c525f02e04e6\n\nPeruse that list again, in case you did not read it carefully. Till the advent of the British, how many Indian emperors, kings have been mentioned in the above list? How many of them have been highlighted and glorified in our history despite some seriously awesome stuff they did? Has our History been modified to such an extent that our own ancestors have been left out of out of it?\n\n## The one word answer to the last question: YES\n\nIf you see, India is one of the very few countries to have a civilization which goes back to about 3000 BC. No other country has this big a history. To put it in perspective, India’s last golden age was in the 6th century BC. Wonder what were the others in the world doing at that time……….\n\n**The Angrez**\n\n[ No comments!](https://preview.redd.it/wzufkxbfony61.png?width=1705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25deb7acab378308322ef64c286e09a78b78e5ee)\n\n **Americans**\n\n[ America... What the hell is that?](https://preview.redd.it/l8tenmpsony61.png?width=2678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28dd37ac0d835cbeecf54f1d50316bb8586a0023)\n\n \n\nWe are a civilization that was so advanced, that we were actually celebrating our golden age when Brits still hadn’t figured out what ”Being Clothed’ meant and the Americans could have been the name of an opium brand. So isn’t it kinda surprising that only two Indian emperors were considered to be worth remembering by a tenth grader in an eon or so? Would have been humorous, if it wasn’t our civilization. And because it is, it becomes deeply distressing and disturbing.\n\nThe Gupta dynasty as a dynasty, ended in about 6th century AD. However, the last meaningful king that our History textbooks bother to mention is Chandragupta II, whose reign ended in 4th Century AD. And then, the scene is fast forwarded to the point where Mohammad Ghauri invaded India in 1191, to start the Delhi Sultanate which would then metamorphose into the Islamic Empire. What does the above line tell you?\n\nIt tells you that an average tenth grader actually knows nothing about what happened in India in the intervening period between the Guptas and the Delhi Sultanate (A time period of about 800 years). At least they do not think it was worth remembering. To be fair they are not to blame, especially when you consider our academicians have dedicated ONE\xa0 single Chapter in the Seventh standard History textbook, to cover the period when it was Indians who ruled the land..\n\nYes… ONE CHAPTER, COVERING A PERIOD OF A THOUSAND YEARS ENCOMPASSING THE WHOLE OF THE INDIAN CIVILAZTION. One Chapter from history lessons stretching across the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and the tenth grades of CBSE. One insignificant chapter in over five years of schooling dealing with a period of more than one thousand years.\n\n**Now why only one chapter,** is known only to the enlightened souls who designed those textbooks. And as a result of either their deliberate oversight or perhaps pure ineptitude, most of the school children do not know have any idea about\n\n**The Harsha Empire**\n\nThis empire was founded by King Harshavardhana. This guy ascended the throne immediately after the Gupta dynasty, at an age when we aren’t allowed to have a driving license or have a drink. He became an emperor at the age of\xa0 **sixteen** in about 606 AD. He went on to capture what is today called North India (Including Kashmir) and Pakistan, His empire at its greatest extent looked something like this\n\n[ He actually united all these states, something that we struggle to do even today!](https://preview.redd.it/xd29iw2bpny61.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f7d1494ae5cd300604111233656fe88d7bd0b94)\n\nHe fought almost 300 battles in the 41 years he ruled with a win loss ratio that even Novak Djokovic would envy;\xa0 299-1. Uniting all these states, I guess was trouble even then.\n\nNot only was he adept as a fighting machine, but actually authored three full length Sanskrit plays Ratnavali, Priyadarsika and Nagananda, while he was busy conquering. \xa0Nagananda especially is considered one of the greatest plays ever written in Sanskrit literature. It is thought to be the first play ever to have five acts where the tone changes midway from Romance to horror and ends with the villain turning into the hero. This guy introduced plot twists and ‘[cut to the chase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_to_the_chase)‘ in the 6th century AD. And all of that was probably thought in the middle of a battle.\n\nAmongst Harsha’s other achievements, was that he was the first to abolish Sati as a rule in his kingdom, some 800 years before Raja Ram Mohan Roy was even born. He was a major patron of the Nalanda University, and was the title sponsor of the ramparts around it, for protection from invaders and other pricks. No wonder Nalanda expanded singularly because of this guys patronage.\n\nHarsha was the first King to have ever established a diplomatic relationship with China, with ambassadors and gifts being exchanged in 630 AD. And last but not the least the guy in the pic below lived\xa0 in the kingdom of Harsha, and was patronized by this emperor so that he could work on his field of expertise.\n\n*Processing img mzoa234jpny61...*\n\nSurely Emperor Harsha deserves more than the 10 lines that he currently gets in our history textbook."<br />Author: 'SHIVANSH_RTX'<br />id: 'nakfcx'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>

Stop spreading this self defeating message.'<br />Body: 'I know BJPs sweep across India was spectacular, compared to that the recent defeats in Punjab, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Bengal looks like BJP is on the back foot. \n\nBut if you look at these states individually you will notice that they show that things are really not bad, but just a few exceptions. \n\nPunjab: When was the last time BJP won on it\'s own? BJP supporters know its better to have Captain in charge if BJP is not part of the coalition. BJP on it\'s own never had a chance and until the farm bill starts showing results don\'t expect any change here. \n\nMaharashtra: we all know what happened and Mota bhai tried his best to still squeeze in a BJP government. We won\'t know how things stand till next election\'s. \n\nRajasthan: "Modi tujhse bair nahi, Raje teri khair nahi", nned I say more?\n\nNow lets move to the most recent and painful for many.\n\nBengal: To get an idea of BJPs performance here let\'s look how they did I  Karnataka over the years. With about 3 seats in 90s to almost half the seats continually  for the last decade and a half. Once BJP puts their foot in a state they will always be in first or second position, in Bengal they went from mere 3 seats to 77 seats, an increase of 25 times, not percent but times. I\'ve never seen a party do this in recent times not even BJP. I know that the campaign made it look like it will be much closer contest but that\'s simply how BJP goes to war.. hmm elections, its always all or nothing for them. Regarding the post poll violence, have you guys been paying attention, that\'s always how a communist mentality state works, if BJP had won there would still be blood on the streets, but hopefully not this much. One of the reasons I was hoping for a BJP win was that the cycle of violence would end.\n\nSo my brothers and sisters we are here for them long haul, losing an election is not end of the world.\n\n\nFor now let\'s give the government a chance to fight the virus. Also please note Modi doesn\'t breathe out 90% pure oxygen, its also the responsibility of the states to arrange for medicine and oxygen. People blaming Modi for lack of vaccine, please read up why we are having a lack of vaccine, we still have the most vaccinated people in absolute numbers in the world after US.

<li>Title: 'Why did Sri Krishna really kill Shishupala?'<br />Body: 'I posted this few months back in the Hinduism subreddit but thought it should reach a larger audience as it is a common misconception among Sanatanis - \n\nPeople think that Krishna was some intolerant person who killed Shishupala just for being insulted 100 times.  I see even many Hindus think that this is what happened and try to justify it.  I don\'t know why TV serials only show this much, they are to blame for this misconception to be so prevalent. People think Shishupala just said 100 words against Krishna and then Krishna suddenly got up and hurled Sudarsana at Shishupala without warning. \n\nThe misconception is that Shishupala insulted Him 100 times there or the insults were the offences Krishna considered - no. Shishupala\'s mother asked that Krishna not kill her son for 100 offences , she was quite sure he wouldn\'t commit 100 offences against Him, but there the insults were considered to make the number go up to 100.  That does not mean that he did not commit offences before. Krishna wanted to kill him before but did not in order because of the promise and possibly for other reasons like wanting to kill him in Rajasuya only. \n\nFirstly, Shisupala , inflamed by the words of Bhishma against him, challenges Krishna to a duel, and tells Krishna that he is going to kill Him -\n\n"The ruler of Chedi endued with exceeding prowess, desirous of combating with Vasudeva addressed him and said,--O Janarddana, I challenge thee. Come, fight with me until I slay thee today with all the Pandavas. For, O Krishna, the sons of Pandu also, who disregarding the claims of all these kings, have worshipped thee who art no king, deserve to be slain by me along with thee."\n\nThen Krishna responds - \n"Ye kings, this wicked-minded one, who is the son of a daughter of the Satwata race, is a great enemy of us of the Satwata race; and though we never seek to injure him, he ever seeketh our evil. This wretch of cruel deeds, ye kings, hearing that we had gone to the city of Pragjyotisha, came and burnt Dwaraka, although he is the son of my father\'s sister. While king Bhoja was sporting on the Raivataka hill, this one fell upon the attendants of that king and slew and led away many of them in chains to his own city. Sinful in all his purpose, this wretch, in order to obstruct the sacrifice of my father, stole the sacrificial horse of the horse-sacrifice that had been let loose under the guard of armed men. Prompted by sinful motives, this one ravished the reluctant wife of the innocent Vabhru (Akrura) on her way from Dwaraka to the country of the Sauviras. This injurer of his maternal uncle, disguising himself in the attire of the king of Karusha, ravished also the innocent Bhadra, the princess of Visala, the intended bride of king Karusha. I have patiently borne all these sorrows for the sake of my father\'s sister. It is, however, very fortunate that all this hath occurred today in the presence of all the kings. Behold ye all today the hostility this one beareth towards me. And know ye also all that he hath done me at my back."\n\nTo summarise, he raped multiple women. He burnt down a city. He stole the sacrificial horse. And this is all when the Yadavas did not provoke him, he only did it when Krishna wasn\'t there. \n\nWould you not kill such a person when they expressly challenge to a duel and threaten you? With so many offences it\'s a great thing he was allowed to be alive till then. Because those days there weren\'t courts or anything, Kshatriyas only used to stand up for the innocent and punish the wicked. Especially a kshatriya like Krishna who had expressedly come for dharma-samsthapana!\n\nBlasphemy simply was not a thing in Vedic times. \n\nEven logically speaking Krishna would not have killed Shishupala just for insults, because many people used to insult Krishna as either a cowherd or a coward back then. It isn\'t like it is the first time someone insulted Him to anger Him so much.  So it is out of the question. \n\nJai Sri Ram\n\nSource - [Shishupala Vadha Parva](https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02044.htm)]'<br />Author: 'jai_sri_ram108'<br />id: 'nagpzy'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm 🕉️</li>

<li>Title: 'The RSS should pull back from Kerala, Bengal and in places where the BJP has lost ground'<br />Body: 'Before you oppose it, hear me out. \n\nBengal elections were a massively damp. If anything, it sends a signal of Hindutva not finding acceptance among the Bengali masses in West Bengal. Of course, the routine argument would be that the BJP won 80 seats, but there is more to it than what meets the eye. \n\nThe BJP attracted disgruntled CPI voters. So popular was it that the CPI voters were saying  "Pehle Ram Phir Bam" (First Ram then Bam). This has been focused upon countless times - \n\nhttps://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/left-supporters-voted-for-bjp-in-bengal-admits-sitaram-yechury-voters-found-bjp-a-credible-force-says-congress-mp/story-PHiYFh6NkXCewiSoen0B0M_amp.html\n\nhttps://www.indiatoday.in/amp/elections/west-bengal-assembly-polls-2021/story/-aage-ram-pore-baam-former-leftists-form-bjp-s-backbone-in-bengal-2021-1789571-2021-04-11\n\nA population of the size of Bengal can not have a massive ideological change in merely 5 years. They can not turn themselves from simps to self assertive people. Perhaps the BJP did not realise this. It read the CPI transfer of votes as an ideological change. \n\n\nWhile we can not fault them for misreading public sentiment, what we can rather do is advice the RSS on its post poll strategy. Mamta had been tightening screws on the RSS ever since she was in power. No guesses that she will double down and RSS guys will be killed in political fights. However, pause here for a minute and think if it is worth it. Why so you think precious RSS lives should be lost in places where ideological change is not forthcoming  ? These men can be better utilised in other states to uplift the society instead of losing their lives in a pointless war in a foreign state. \n\nKerala and West Bengal will never vote for BJP, both due to ideological reasons and also due to demographic compulsions. Therefore it only makes sense for the RSS to pull back. \n\nMoreover, since the RSS serves as a check to the IUML, the pullback by the RSS will bring the Islamists of PFI, SDPI and IUML in face to face warring against the CPI cadres in Kerala. While the RSS would save the lives of its cadres, it would also stop being a buffer between two contrasting ideological cadre forces who were merely finding a common enemy in the RSS. The IUML and the CPI would then turn against each other in greater numbers (they already have), and as evident in history, the Islamists always win when they are opposed to communists. The same goes for Bengal too. If the RSS were to withdraw tomorrow, with the Left having collapsed in Bengal, the TMC would be one single dominant entity. This situation would lead to the TMC being increasingly assertive and bizzare with the Muslims becoming even more emboldened, brazen and outrageous since there is no one to check them. Non Muslims, slowly but surely would be repulsed by what they will see as Muslim upper hand in Bengal and would either want to float an alternative political party or would try to change the TMC from within. In either case, TMCs base would naturally erode because people can tolerate assaults on their identities only for some time. \n\nFor the BJP and the RSS would be seemingly advantageous oft the following reasons  -\n\n1. Purges then of undesirable seemingly liberal individuals\n\n2. Saves lives. \n\n3. Saves resources\n\n4. Their absence would make the Bengali Hindu population and the Keralite population idolize them, since they will be willing to overlook their flaws in order to praise them for their merits (happens everywhere) as they realise that the communists stand no chance when standing against Islamists. \n\n5. Would serve as a long term "lesson" for those who did not vote against the TMC. \n\nThe RSS serves as a sponge for all the Islamists on the ground. If the RSS is absent, the next thing that the Islamists will target are normal hindu households. This will benefit the RSS since till when the RSS exists, the Hindu households, free from the worries of ensuring the security of his or her family, pontificates and criticises the RSS for being  "facist", " Bully" and for not holding higher moral ground. However, with the RSS gone, the Hindu families will start fearing for their family members and will realise as to what the RSS offered them, safety. This realisation needs to come.'<br />Author: 'normienahi'<br />id: 'naebfx'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Is this true?\n*A*: Heart only good for so many beats, and that\'s it... Don\'t waste time on exercise. Everything wear out eventually. Speeding up heart not make you live longer; its like saying you extend life of a car by driving faster. Want to live longer?\nTake nap.\n\n*Q*: Should I reduce my alcohol intake?\n*A*: Oh no. Wine made from fruit. Fruit very good. Brandy distilled wine, that means they take water out of fruity bit so you get even more of goodness that way. Beer also made of grain. Grain good too.\nBottoms up!\n\n*Q*: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercise program?\n*A*: Can\'t think of one, sorry.\nMy philosophy: No pain...good!\n\n*Q*: Aren\'t fried foods bad for you?\n*A*: YOU NOT LISTENING! Food fried in vegetable oil.\nHow getting more vegetable be bad?\n\n*Q*: Is chocolate bad for me?\n*A*: You crazy?!? HEL-LO-O!! Cocoa bean! Another vegetable!\nIt best feel-good food around!\n\n*Q*: Is swimming good for your figure?\n*A*: If swimming good for figure,\nexplain whale to me.\n\n*Q*: Is getting in shape important for my lifestyle?\n*A*: Hey! \'Round\' is also a shape!\n\nWell... I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had about food and diets.\n\nAnd remember:\n\nFinally the Japanese Doctor summed up: Look mister, Life should NOT be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in an attractive and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways - Beer in one hand - chocolate in the other - body thoroughly used up, totally worn out and screaming "WOO-HOO, what a ride my life was"!!!!!😂\nEat whatever you like because you will still DIE, don\'t allow motivational speakers deceive you.\n\n1. The inventor of the treadmill had died at the age of 54\n\n2. The inventor of gymnastics died at the age of 57\n\n3. The world bodybuilding champion  died at the age of 41\n\n4. The best footballer in the world Maradona, died at the age of 60.\n\nBUT\n\n5. The KFC inventor died at 94.\n\n6. Inventor of Nutella brand died at the age of 88\n\n7. Imagine, cigarette maker Winston  died at the age of 102\n\n8. The inventor of opium died at the age of 116 in an earthquake\n\n9. Hennessey inventor dies at 98. \n\n How did these doctors come to the conclusion that exercise prolongs life?\n\nThe rabbit is always jumping up and down but it lives for only 2 years and the turtle that doesn’t exercise at all, lives  400 years.\n\nSo, Take some rest, Chill, Stay cool, eat, drink and enjoy your life.

<li>Title: 'We should learn from the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict.'<br />Body: 'I opened up my Facebook today, and as I scrolled down, 1 off 10 posts was regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict. Most of the International Media houses like BBC, AJ+, NYT etc covering this sided with the Palestinians which was expected. Same with twitter and even Reddit, Palestinians seems to be the favourites. But i asked myself, why is it? Why do people tend to support the Palestinians and not the Israelis. The only answer i could come up with was the muslim brotherhood. A muslim living in an entirely different continent has the same fervour as the Palestinians. Even in India, the trend follows. If anything, the media houses know whom to appease thanks to the worldwide support and they\'re just doing what is going to earn them accolades. \nThese people talk about the Israeli forces clash with the people at Al-Aqsa mosque, what they don\'t talk about is the sinister plans that are usually made in mosques, ask the Kashmiri Pandits. Its almost like a safe haven for these miscreants to later play the victim card about how policed barged into their "holy" mosque. And from what i have read, not one person was killed in this clash, the Palestinians were the ones to start the missile attacks on Israel yet the support pouring in internationally is just illogically immense. \nAnd then we come to our people, who give no fuck of what\'s going on in the other street. We should learn from the muslim brotherhood, and bolster our community and stay together.'<br />Author: 'Futerefu'<br />id: 'na282q'<br />Flair :Indo-International 📰</li>
<li>Title: "Discussion on BJP's current state and it's possible future."<br />Body: 'Let me start with a hard truth : BJP is in a dump right now along with Narendra Modi.\n\nBoth the credibility and charisma of Narendra Modi seems like gone.\n\nSince coming to power, Modi led central government has tried to play their own game which in turn has angered a lot of people.\n\nNirmala Sitaraman madam has presented three budgets so far and in all those three, privatisation was in majority which has led the common people to believe that Modi Government is "selling the country"! \n\nNow the problem is that the reasons behind these decisions should be clarified by the government because there are so many anti BjP elements are there spreading falsified facts about these.\n\nThen came Farm Laws along which came the protests and the result of that is going to reflect in Punjab, Haryana and UP elections.\n\nBefore the Covid situation escalation last year, the economy was already in pretty shitty situation and although we made a recovery from a "-23%" GDP last year, looks like we are heading another ecomical disaster. Also, due to this escalation, the prices of essential goods are increasing rapidly, further infuring discontent among the common people.\n\nAlthough the state governments are responsible as well, but Narendra Modi as a PM cannot escape criticism for the current Covid situation in India and I think that the handling of second wave of Covid has sealed BJP\'s future for next two years.\n\nThe prices of Petrol, Disel, Cooking gas, Edible oils and many other essential goods\' prices are increasing and it seems that soon enough these will get out of control. The interest rates are being lowerd each year. \n\nSo, I think Modi Government should now reflect their policies and decision making. Because if they continue in this path of reforms and privatisation and giving no relief to the common people, (for starter, they should move the petrol and disel under GST) they will lose every freaking election from now on and untill 2024.\n\nAnd to be honest, I can\'t imagine an India without BJP at power because we simply cannot afford it.'<br />Author: 'a_curious_introvert'<br />id: 'na1on9'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'An Unpopular Opinion. Long Read'<br />Body: 'So while goin through my sm feed I noticed too many women bikni clad women. I was carefull , and knew touching it would make matters worse. Once I did that with one of those Islamic  posts and the next time I logged in, the feed was filled with ola stuff...But I then thought , why do most actressesa and actors wear western clothes while doing photoshoots and other stuff, never seen any of their photoshoots with them in Indic clothes , except when they post on the occasion of some festival , national holidays like independence day republic day\n\nSo..Is a narrative being synthesized and spread that to look good ( if maximum attraction is being focused onto them then that itself the assertion that they look good) one must always wear western outfits..how much true is that, most of the gen x folks can be seen complaining that saree makes their arse uncomfartable whereas men have already stopped wearing kurtas and other Indian clothes as formals way way back....We are moving towards an era where like I said wearing traditonal clothes would become an act that people would only indulge in, on the occasion of festivals. Just to remind you folks, while we are working hard for revitalising our culture, slow deterioration is happening parallalelly. \n\n\nI am convinced that ours is going to be futile attempt. It just isnt about clothes , it\'s almost everything that ultimately we use as means for the derivation of pleasure and happiness, the white being superior even when it comes to external beauty is something that we unknowingly have acknowledged , all thanks to porn. \n\nMost of us are more interested in enjoying the comforts that modern technology offers as ( which gora sahed might already have in possesion ) . I mean a gora life looks so perfect, don\'t you think?? Another fuckery thats being encouraged these days is teaching English to toddlers , if theres someone who already did that I would urge you to suck your pipi and stfu..you have no rights to give opinion here.\n\n\n I have the abstract idea in my mind but the thing is I suck in articulation. Gora lifestyle is elitism, being a w"*# /fuck BOI before marriage is progressiveness, Goras are the like...the baap of andolan jeevi so let\'s also become andolan jeevis, Gora shit activism in social media so let\'s do the same, # - 👈 Mofo was introduced by Gora , and all of a sudden we see this being extensively used , holding plackcards again Gora shit,  gora clothes are good rest bad and regressive , imitate Gora lifestyle progressiveness , use Gora brand again progressiveness, spend tons on buying things of trivial importance again, Gora shit ...speaking gora language is empowerment. \n\nThen there are coconuts , you know what I mean.\nI have heard people asserting that it\'s their choice but choice and the reason why you are preferring gora clothes over rest lately is because the idea that gora dress = make me.beautiful has solidified inside your minds , again credit goes to bullywood and white imperialism....\n\nforget imposition the gora aura is some serious threat, we just need to flipp the pages of history books , one sulthan of some islamic state prior to the islamic revolution used to stripp  women and force them to wear western outfits , WHY cause the Gora aura he believed reeked of progressiveness , copy Gora and suddenly you are the most advanced society in the world..\n\nWith each passing day anything ( whether it be artforms , movies , structures etc) that reminds us of our ancestors , our culture and our heritage is dwindling. Everything ranging from outfits to the kind of stuff we watch is remotely Indian..the term Indian is going to dissolve into name tag that one would be assigned at the time of birth ( like its name )...not an identity..'<br />Author: 'Jingochauver357'<br />id: 'n9zhs9'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

<li>Title: 'Ravana was a rapist and Sri Rama never doubted Mata Sita - some misconceptions answered'<br />Body: 'There are tiring misconceptions which need to be cleared here. \n\nI was seeing some debate between two people on the internet in the comment section, one was arguing against Sanatana Dharma, say A, and the other, say B, was follower of it. So A told "first rapist in the world, Ravana is from your religion only right" and B said "Who said Ravana was rapist, he was great jnani, he just took away blah blah blah". \n\nOkay first of all the initial objection was foolish one. Ravana was killed by the Maryada Purushottam of Sanatana Dharma then how is this a fault on Sanatana Dharma? What foolishness? \n\nBut rather than pointing out this simple fact, defending Ravana is wrong. Because Ravana is indeed a rapist, and he himself admits it.\n\nraavaNam kruddhamaajJNaaya mahaapaarshvo mahaabalaH |\n\nmuhuurta manusa.ncintya praaJNjalirvaakya mabraviit || 6-13-1\n\nPerceiving Ravana enraged, a very strong demon named Mahaparsva thought for a while and with joined palms, spoke as follows:\n\nbalaatkukkuTavR^ittena pravartasva mahaabala |\n\nakramyaakramya siitaam vai taam bhuN^iksva ca ramasva ca || 6-13-4\n\n\nO, ruler endowed with a mighty prowess! Act in the mode of a cock, forcibly against her. Enjoy that Sita, by charging on her again and again and revel with her.\n\nevamuktastadaa raajaa mahaapaarshvaena raavaNaH |\n\ntasya sampuujayanvaakyamidam vacanamabraviit || 6-13-9\n\nAppreciating the words spoken thus by Mahaparsva, King Ravana spoke the following words: (notice that he appreciates such words)\n\npitaamahasya bhavanam gacchantiim puJNjikasthalaam |\n\ncaJNcuuryamaaNaamadraakshamaakaashe.agnishikhaamiva || 6-13-11\n\nOnce I saw a celestial nymph, Punjikasthala(by name) flashing like a flame, concealing herself in the sky and proceeding towards the abode of Brahma.\n\nsaa prasahya mayaa bhuktaa kR^itaa vivasanaa tataH |\n\nsvayambhuubhavanam praaptaa lolitaa nalinii yathaa || 6-13-12\n\nShe was made unclothed by me and was enjoyed forcibly.

What is the use of studying scriptures and doing penance when he freely rapes women like that? Even tried to force himself on Vedavati as he says in Yuddha Kanda but this should suffice. Even when he is speaking about what he did to Punjikasthala he feels no remorse. \n\nThis has nothing to do with Sanatana Dharma. Rather it is great because our God is the one who went and hunted down the rapist for his sins. \n\nSince someone may bring up Sri Rama and Sri Sita Mata Agni Pravesha etc etc as some weak counter, let me quote Sundara Kanda directly for this. \n\nshrutvaa tat vacanam kruuram aatma apaharaNa upamam || 5-53-26\n\nvaidehii shoka samtaptaa huta ashanam upaagamat |\n\nHearing that cruel news (that Hanuma\'s tail had been lit on fire) which created as much sorrow as when she was carried away by Ravana, Seetha was tormented with grief and started to pay homage to the fire-god.\n\nmangalaa abhimukhii tasya saa tadaa aasiin mahaakapeH || 5-53-27\n\nupatasthe vishaala akShii prayataa havya vaahanam |\n\nThen, the large-eyed Seetha, wishing for the welfare of Hanuma, prayed the fire-god with her devoted self.\n\nyadi maam vR^itta sampannaam tat samaagama laalasaam || 5-53-30\n\nsa vijaanaati dharma aatmaa shiito bhava hanuumataH |\n\nIf that virtuous Rama recognises me as one,, who is endowed with a good moral conduct and who is ardently desirous of meeting him, please be cool to Hanuma.\n\ntataH tiikShNa arciH avyagraH pradakShiNa shikho analaH || 5-53-32\n\njajvaala mR^iga shaava akShyaaH shamsann iva shivam kapeH |\n\nThen, the fire-god, as though informing the fawn-eyed Seetha about the well-being of Hanuma, shone brightly with sharp flames, undisteurbed and shooting out pointed flames towards the right.\n\n- [Valmiki Ramyana Sundara Kanda Sarga 53](http://www.valmikiramayan.net/sundara/sarga53/sundara_53_frame.htm)\n\nSo obviously this proves that Sri Rama always knew that Mata Sita was of good conduct.

<li>Title: 'Why you are struggling so much hard in this material existence?'<br />Body: "Why you are struggling so much hard in this material existence? For happiness. Why you are after sense gratification? For happiness. Why you want to possess? For happiness. Why you want to become beautiful? For happiness. Why you want to eat so many things? For happiness. You go on. The happiness, your ultimate goal.\n\nBut the happiness which you are now deriving from the sources you have manufactured, that is temporary. If you want to become happy by intoxication, how long? That is temporary. Any way. If you want to be happy by sex indulgence, how long? That is also for a few minutes, few seconds. But if you want eternal, continued happiness, then you have to purify your existential condition, you have to place yourself in the transcendental position, and you will feel that happiness.\n\n- From Srila AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's lecture on Srimad-Bhagavatam 5.5.1 on September 12th 1969 at Tittenhurst Park, near London.

As reported by the New York Times(who would\'ve thought), there are basically three reasons why it was manufactured instead of natural:\n\n1. First of all, viruses escape labs under which such research goes on almost routinely.\n2. In previous cases in which the virus has jumped from animals to humans, it was possible to catch the "Patient-Zero" very easily. This has not been achieved in the case of the Wuhan Virus until now.\n3. Scientists who have looked at the virus under a microscope have immediately identified it to be artificial and unnatural.\n4. The person who ran the first petition to declare Wuhan Virus not originating from China and debunk the "lab leak" hypothesis, has earlier worked at the Wuhan Institute and was the same person who also "investigated" the Chinese origin on behalf of WHO.'<br />Author: 'ravise7en'<br />id: 'n9ax5g'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

I was in school and 2010 it was. And Facebook was famous. I can still clearly remember it like it\'s yesterday. When i was filling up my personal details it asked me about my religion and First typed HINDU but idont know what made me remove it with the word Humanitarian. I believe at that time i was ashamed of being a hindu i might have thought is isnt cool to be a hindu. But let me clarify i never thought of being anything else. \n\nYes being a young boy who doesn\'t want to be accepted as a cool e\'stud. But not for long i was ok looking and was good in my field too. Acceptance was no more a bait for me. i had a gang and we still are. \n\nBut what made me proud of what i am today. It was 2012, an engineer does everything in hostel except engineering. So binge watching was a habbit. Then i came across some muslim stuff let me tell you it was the time when Zakir Hussain was just about be a trend. Yes I use to watch his videos and by some point i use to agree with him but couple of days later i came across his video of downgrading my gods and saying they are myths and nothing more and i didn\'t stopped there i watched more with a thought in the head "yeah may be he is right". But after constantly listening this shit in many videos. It was over now i was pissed now. How this dikhead who doesn\'t even have a pants of his size can tell his god is the only god. Now i was watching more but this time with anger and frustration that can\'t he just say one time that my gods are good too. Cant he say just once that we all are brothers and sisters yess why can\'t he cos thats what my school has tought me that we are all together. I have never downgraded anyone or any other religion then why is he doing that. Yes why is he say that about mine\'s. Yes i was seeking validation from that guy just  to hear once that we are good people too but soon my old ego came in between. Now i was pissed and wanted to know why he did that. Why he didn\'t say good thing to my community my people my god. That is day i found that it is my identity, they are my god they are my people and No fuking one can say anything, to my gods, no fucking one. \n\n(Sigh) And then started the exploration of my identity. Who I am what I was who are we. The child how use to think science is the only subject of standards now became a history book worm.

Finding yourself in this world is literally like needle in a haystack. During this exploration i came across many facts many of you might know not even know and some that you might not even like. I will come up with those things later.\n\nMy father still taunt me when sometimes we discuss politics that "ki tu hi tha jisko Kejriwal pasand tha" yes it was the time when he was with anna.

Spreads false narratives and insults on Hindu gods and goddesses, propagate jihad, sympathise terrorists and so on.\n\n\n\n2) Marxists/communists - always talk and cry about the privileges of real hard working people while themselves sitting in AC rooms enjoying the benefits of capitalism. Hates business and wants to spread propaganda to people so as to create an environment of hatered against businesses. They reproduce any propaganda to meet this end like bots like climate change (creating fear), fake propaganda on big businesses, that labour are being oppressed and so on. Basically anything and logic don\'t appeal to them. When you try to counter them with logic, they\'ll call you an intolerant privileged fascist bigot and use terms like hyper nationalism, jingoism, Xenophobic and so on. They even don\'t believe that India cannot exist as one nation and that every state in India should be independent and propagate false narratives like Aryan Invasion theory and so on. The real Andolan Jeevis.\n\n\n\n3) Missionaries - Want to convert Hindus to Christianity. Mainly do subversion through promoting false narratives as research. Extremely dangerous. As they have billions of funding both research and at ground level from foreign powers like the US. Example: To subvert dalit identity from Hindus, they started brainwashing Dalits using fraud afro dalit studies trying to represent false equivalences like African slaves and Dalits were similar and were oppressed always which is far from the truth. So many NGOs and Human rights organisations have their funding and work for them. And these liberal bots further and amplify that propaganda in Social media.\n\n\n\n\n4) Media - Lutyens media , the real Godi media. Heavily funded by Congress and opposition and anti national elements too and are an integral part of the eco system that holds all the other 4 categories described here as a glue to amplify the propaganda and brainwash people.\n\n\n\n5) Macaulay Putras - South Delhi / South Bombay ki Lavanya types and bollywood/influencers and so on. These are the bots that are brainwashed or even paid and senselessly without even thinking share their "esteemed" opinions and are used by the above 4 Makkaars described above to further their narrative and amplify it in social media. These social media tweets/posts by these Macaulay Putras are again used by Mainstream media to widen their narrative and take forward that narratives to the public.\n\n\n\n\nAll the secular liberals reproduce the narratives by all the above Panch Makkaaars like bots and are absolute idiots who are a threat to the nation because they can\'t even think.'<br />Author: 'charaniv'<br />id: 'n99t4p'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

I am no big fan of Modi (much more of Dr. S. Jaishankar) but the move was a good descison.\n\nLet us partake in a thought experiment: \n\nThink, India produces 60000 vaccines daily (the no. is random, this is a thought exp.) and can administer 45000 vaccines daily all over India. Now what other bhratas are applauding the US for doing is that US will first keep a stockpile of vaccines that they will use to vaccinate their own population then, donate and send vaccines to other nations. But this is bad, as derivimg from the video, that this could be much more efficient and the efficient way is what India did: \n\nStockpile for a certain percentage of the population while sending vaccines around the world.\n\n\nSince the vaccine production is not going to decline soon, our population shall have no problem, while we also acquire soft power around the world. If you are a S. Jaishankar fan, you would know that this type of soft power acquiring vaccine diplomacy is what the QUAD is doing to counter Chinese influence in the Southeast Asian nations. QUAD has promised 1 billion Covid vaccine doses by the end of 2022.\n\nI donot approve of other management than this, vaccine management by state and centre both have been horrible and the situation could have been managed better but the move of vaccine diplomacy was a good one.\n\nThank You\n\n\nAlso another video, unrelated about what they think God is( yes, there is reincarnation, the way they view it.

<li>Title: 'Hindu conversion: How Hinduism is being turned more Islamic and Christian'<br />Body: 'Hinduism is often described as a way of life. But the Sangh Parivar seems bent on turning it into a way of strife. The Dharama Jagran Samanvay Vibhag, an offshoot of the RSS, is reportedly going into the bounty-hunting business. It has been distributing pamphlets in and around Aligarh seeking donations from the public to help fund a ‘reconversion’ – ‘ghar wapsi’ (homecoming) – ceremony that the saffron outfit is planning to hold on Christmas Day and during which it will seek to bring Muslims and Christians back into the Hindu fold from which they have allegedly strayed.\n\nAccording to the pamphlet, the ‘bounty’ involved in converting a Muslim is Rs 5 lakh while in the case of a Christian it’s Rs 2 lakh. The price differential is presumably based on the premise that Christians are a much smaller minority than Muslims, and so pose less ‘samasya’ (problem) to the body politic than do followers of Islam. Even as its protégé, the BJP, has initiated a country-wide drive to recruit members and overtake the Chinese Communist Party as the world’s largest political association, the RSS has set a target of annually converting 1 lakh each of Muslims and Christians to Hinduism.\n\nThat individual proselytisation, let alone mass conversion, has no place in the live-and-let-live ethos of the Hindu faith is blithely ignored by these saffron crusaders, who have mounted a concerted campaign to ‘semitise’ Hinduism and turn it into a religious ideology based, in the manner of Islam and Christianity, on the concept of ‘One book, one congregation, one people’.\n\nCompared with the semetic beliefs of Islam and Christianity, Hinduism is perceived by the Parivar as effete and weak because of its internal divisions of caste and regionalism. This perceived ‘weakness’ is what enabled first the Mughals and then the British to impose their rule on the country. To be like Islam and Christianity, which are seen to be ‘muscular’ religions that enjoin proselytisation to swell their ranks, Hinduism, as viewed by the saffron brigade, needs to gird up its loins to project a more virile and vigorously assertive persona.\n\nThis felt need to stiffen the sinews of Hinduism and reformulate it as an all-pervasive national culture lies behind the proposal to make the Bhagwad Gita India’s ‘national book’, in much the same way as the Bible and the Quran are for Christian and Islamic countries. The move has been decried not only by secularists – who argue that the only book which could have national status is the Constitution – but also by those who subscribe to the view that Hinduism has always been an eclectic agglomeration of ‘smaller traditions’ rather than a monolithic structure that can be represented by a single text, no matter how seminal it might claim to be.\n\nAnother step towards remoulding Hinduism into semetic form is the promotion of a congregational faith. Despite mass gatherings like the Kumbh Mela, Hindus have traditionally never practiced congregational worship. There is no daily call to prayer, no Sunday morning sermons. The closest Hindu equivalent of a regular congregation is the RSS shakha. The mass conversions which are being planned are part of a strategy to bring in congregationalism through the back door.\n\nThe third attribute of semetic tradition – that of creating a bond of ‘one people’ – is sought to be achieved by replacing the turbulent river of history, with its diverse tributaries and distributaries, with a mainstream mythological narrative based on the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.\n\nThis fabricated India is not a land of different people who settled in different places at different times, and had different ways of living and different forms of worship. Instead, the recreated India is sought to be made into a nation of total homogeneity, cultural, ethnic, and religious, a nation of ‘one people’.\n\nWill the saffron strategy of turning India into a national equivalent of undifferentiable sliced white bread succeed? Perhaps not. The Parivar’s Achilles Heel could be the Dharama Jagran Samanvay Vibhag ‘bounty’ of Rs 5 lakh and Rs 2 lakh. With the demonstrated Indian genius of turning all schemes involving money into scams, Coalgate and Spectrumgate might soon yield headlines to Conversiongate.'<br />Author: 'illbindlli'<br />id: 'n8h784'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Where this committee will conduct a survey about the percentage of creamy layer, non creamy layer and below poverty lined families all over the world. Perhaps this committee must segregate all of the castes individually and there shouldn\'t be any specific categories left. After the survey is over, experts must analyse the average condition of all castes. And then government, with the supervision of supreme court must rearrange these castes in their suitable economic condition group. And thus we might have a perfect category system for providing the reservations. \n\nIdk this might be some stupid idea or whatever. \n\nP.S.

<li>Title: 'Modiji must go...'<br />Body: "′′ Modi ji has to be brought to his knees, government has to be proved unsuccessful ′′ This kind of thinking has created so much havoc.\n\nIf you don't believe then read..........\n\nYou will be shocked to know this truth.\n\nIt is notable that the country has a total of 36 states including 28 complete states and 8 union territories (UT).\n\nBut the shocking fact is that as of 8 am today, out of the 208330 deaths due to Corona in the country, more than 107602 (51.65 😵 deaths have occurred in only 6 states. Out of these 6 states, 5 states are ruled by Chhattisgarh (8312,) Punjab (8909) Rajasthan (4084) Jharkhand (2540), and Maharashtra (67985) Congress and Congress alliance. The sixth state is that Delhi (15772) whose Chief Minister is Kejriwal. Isn't it shocking that the number of deaths due to Corona in these 6 states is more than the remaining 30 states in the country. The fact is even more shocking because the total population of these 6 states (34 crore) is only 24 percent of the country's current estimated population (139 crores). Let me mention that the 6 states ruled by BJP with the highest number of deaths due to Corona are Karnataka (15306) Uttar Pradesh (12238), Gujarat (7010), Madhya Pradesh (Haryana (4118) and Uttarakhand ( 2502) There have been a total of 46693 deaths as of 8 am today. There have been 60909 (130 😵 more deaths in 6 states ruled by Congress and Congress alliance and Kejriwal. Another more shocking fact is that the total number of deaths due to Corona in 17 states ruled by BJP and its alliance and 7 union states (UT) is 57820 The was. This number is only 27.75 percent of the total 208330 deaths due to Corona in the country.\n\nThe above conditions put the policy and intentions of the governments of the Congress and Congress alliance and Kejriwal ruled 6 states into the room of serious questions and doubts. We have all seen how the Chief Ministers of Congress-ruled states stopped people from getting vaccinated by continuously spreading fear and confusion about the corona vaccine. The Maharashtra government itself accepted the truth of wasting 5.5 lakh doses of vaccine in such a difficult situation. Yesterday, the shameful and dangerous truth was revealed in the court that Kejriwal government kept hiding 52000 doses of remdesivir injection and kept talking about only 2500 injections. But the truth came out in court. \nYesterday it was also revealed that the Kejri government closed the factory which supply 500 cylinder oxygen daily in Delhi, which is craving for a single drop of oxygen, without any reason. The truth was also revealed in the court that Kejri's government had not handed over the complete and accurate list of hospitals to the company which supply oxygen till yesterday. All the above deeds had the same terrible result and the havoc of Corona in the above 6 states kept increasing day by night. Why did these governments do this.?

He proposed the following economic activities as the main job of the followers: Looty and Plunder, Dacoity, High-way Robberies, Kidnapping, Hijacking, Lies, Cheating, etc. The new religion also proposed any number of rapes can be committed by the followers. Thousands started joining the new religion as the economic activities suggested were easy to follow. If anyone questioned the new religion the founder \'Dubakur\' asked his followers to hack such people. He also instructed them that their death should be so horrendous, terrible, dreadful, atrocious and any onlookers should get frightened to the extent that they never question them. When some people asked him who he was and why he is passing dicta. For more acceptance \'Dubakur\' attributed the provisions in the new religion to the God called as "Lord Labakku Das". When asked how he got such information from \'Lord Labakku Das\', the founder Dubakur said he got them in the form of whispers from \'Lord Labakku Das\'. Somebody suggested that \'whispers\' in the medical history refer to a patient with Schizophrenia. Then Dubakur gave a new name to the information which has been attributed to the so-called God \'Lord Labakku Das\' as \'revealings\'. Since the activities are easier to follow millions joined the new religion. Some time later ‘Dubakur’ told his friend ‘Jerky’ that those were not revealings from ‘Lord Labakku Das’ but the entire nonsense was his own creation and those ideas he himself got when he was under the influence of marijuana. But to make people believe he has used attributed all the nonsense to “Lord Labakku Das”. Dubakur also instructed his followers to turn towards Arctic region during prayers as “Lord Labakku Das” lives there. Dubakuar told his followers that in future our religion should maintain growth of population under check by hackings. Next day when Dubakur got up he could not believe whether it was a Day dream, Night dream, Nightmare or a reality.'<br />Author: 'SecularSlave'<br />id: 'n7vf2d'<br />Flair :🔥 ROAST 🔥</li>

Western media and west in general has influenced our society and made it into a 'Global Society' not that it's wrong but it did have a drastic effect on how the Hindu Society functioned as one. This can be best learnt from the example of Schools. We had gurukuls which were predominantly boarding schools meaning they (Students) had to live for large amounts of time with their teachers who were educated in the Ancient Hindu literature and our way of life. Their kids learnt how and what defines as and separates us from others. Why Hinduism is what it is? Why are our beliefs such as Cows are mothers come into existence? These questions were addressed and students from ground zero learnt about their past.   \nFast forward to today, where the Indian Society follows the West Model of Education where no preference is given to the past, and if it is then it's about random things from around the world and they don't have the depth but just surficial learning. Today kids can talk back to their teachers, which could never happen in a Gurukul. Nothing about HINDU past is taught in schools, but about other cultures which allows kids not to respect their own culture but focus on others. The western media has had the old habit of degrading our culture because of the feelings of Supremacism  and when kids are exposed to such media outputs they learn to hate their own culture and then they call out Hinduism to make a place for themselves in the society. They are supported by those who hate us solidifying their belief that beliefs like 'Not eating meat, worshipping animals and trees' is in fact wrong.   \n***What do we do to reverse this?***"<br />Author: 'Significant-Bar8048'<br />id: 'n7qzu5'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'AMA About Western Civilization'<br />Body: "Hi guys!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, thanks for the much larger than expected amount of responses to my last post. I didn't expect the sheer amount of responses, and the essential welcoming of my perspective. I noticed a lot of commentary about both Indic and Western civilization, and as a Westerner whose a prolific reader and engaged student of history, I wanted to engage with you guys about the West, and perhaps give you another perspective than what you might have in mind right now. Keep in mind that the education of both your country and majority of the world is dominated by either leftist or nationalistic perspectives, and so the proper perspective(s) I think miss out in this mixture, this flurry, the soul of the discussion. I am very much an independent student of history, so most of my knowledge is self read (though I read only proper sources; nothing crank. When I have discussions regarding history with other very knowledgeable people, they may disagree with my perspective, but they do not doubt the quality of the arguments, the soundness of the knowledge and the efficacy of the facts), and thus I can say in good faith that my understandings are not contaminated by ideology. One of the reasons this is important for you guys is that your liberal elites have a certain view of the West and its history and heritage, just like most westerners, that is highly skewed (both the left and the right, and essentially everybody in general, are guilty of this). It is this perspective that I think highly skews what you guys think of the West. My goal here isn't to make you worship the West or think its the best; not at all. If you're going to be honest with yourself, you have to admit that every civilization has its highly commendable aspects, as well its severe drawbacks. And besides, you all belong to a great and ancient civilization that is to be admired and respected. But I just feel that a discussion would be a very proper thing to do. I hope to clarify any misunderstandings, and given that your opponents tend to look up to the West as a model, even if they suggest in public they don't, I think this will be very helpful for you guys in political discussions, but that's not really my aim here. I don't wish to turn this into something political.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing so fascinating about Indian nationalism is that unlike most nationalisms, its really more of a civilizational nationalism than a nation nationalism. It's not about the glory of a specific nation, but about the unity and shared heritage of an ancient civilization. So because you guys think in civilizational terms, I felt that this was a great place to have this discussion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am also more than willing to discuss Indic civilization with you all as well, and just have a proper and healthy civilizational dialogue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd this is only an AMA about Western civilization, not anything personal or just random stuff, though we can just discuss civilizations and cultures in general."<br />Author: 'TheWiseSquid884'<br />id: 'n7ga0k'<br />Flair :Indo-International 📰</li>

<li>Title: '108 for Bharat - An Idea'<br />Body: '- Not Mine, but already started working on several\n\n108 = 8 steps for 1 objective\n\nBut first, the importance of 108, \n\n108 appears as a number of significance within various Eastern religious traditions.\n\nFor example, in the Hindu tradition, there are 108 attendants of Shiva. In Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Lord Krishna in Brindavan had 108 followers. The words of the Buddha are recorded in the Tibetan Kangyur in 108 volumes. A bell is chimed 108 times in Buddhist temples in Japan to finish the old year and welcome the new one.\n\nPlacing significance on the number 108 connects us to the divine source of all things.\n\n108 and the human body\nAs we focus in on the human body, the number 108 holds special significance.\n\nFor example, there are 108 marma points, considered to be sacred places in the body. In Ayurveda, these pressure points are seen as vital for giving life to living beings for it is at these points that consciousness and flesh intersect.\n\nPlacing significance on the number 108 embraces the life-giving energy so vital for human existence.\n\nProposed 8 Simple Steps\n\n1. I love Sanatan but i will not insult others and will look after Sanatanis who are not blessed as me\n\n2. I will contribute and look after to temples around me\n\n3. Will spend time with my kids, local community &amp; teach them Sanatan\n\n4. Will participate in my Local Sanatan festivals as traditional as it can be\n\n5. Will be open, transparent, and friendly with my daughters and will encourage Kids to spend time with family \n\n6. Will  buy from those who celebrate Sanatan festivals at their homes and will not abandon a Veg fruits vendor to save few pennies\n\n7. Will not watch Bollywood, Cricket and Media who do my brain washing\n\n8. Will vote for Nation and Sanatan only. My personal benefit is meaningless and will Not promote anything against Sanatan even as joke\n\nyou can add, modify any steps you feel are in the interest of Sanatan but quietly without insulting others.'<br />Author: 'indiannarwhal'<br />id: 'n75cbw'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Why is communism popular among the youth, when in reality, it acts as a constraint towards fast economic developments?'<br />Body: 'Revolution has a certain allure. You look around and see so many problems. You don’t have the time to change it one by one. You feel you can remove it all in one go. Since we don’t really understand the root of those problems when we are young, it seems quite possible that you can change it all overnight.\n\nIn all those euphoria you don’t look closely into the methods that brought Lenin or Mao into power. Or those used by people like Stalin. Hey, revolution requires a few sacrifices you say. Especially those who don’t comply. Like a love story in a movie, you focus on the “romance” that leads to the wedding and not the thing that comes after you get successfully married.\n\nCommunism seems to fight *the Man* — of those in power, of those controlling religions, of those who are rich — and these are appealing especially in the youth time when you feel powerless, feel impeded by religion and feel poor.\n\nMany people go through that stage. For a long time I used to have Che Guevara flag as my desktop and used to read the works of Marx and Lenin. I spent a lot of time understanding Mao and Ho Chi Minh through books.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xanqm7n39qx61.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33151b60c8eb696c86eaa63886818baf2632d4a1\n\nThen there comes a point, when you are not fighting *the Man* \\- but you are the *Man*. You are no longer as poor or as powerless. You are no longer impeded by religion, but feel empowered by it. You no longer feel the need to uproot the system, but actually have the power to change from within.\n\nYou see a devil far worse than authoritarianism — that is anarchy. Once you understand the perils of anarchy and how hard it is to bring things back into control, your love for revolution goes away.\n\n**That’s the time most grow out of communism.**'<br />Author: 'Time_Traveller_69'<br />id: 'n72yb1'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Youth is being brainwashed and IT cell is just chilling around.'<br />Body: "Modi is clearly loosing his reputation and the pandemic is not the major reason for that. IT cells way of doing things are getting older and tricks are over used. \n\nTo put it in simple perspective votes can be divided in 3 groups 25% Pro BJP voters, 25% against BJP and 50% that can swing any way. These 50 are getting out of our hand thanks to IT cells failure and Modi thinking he can fkup and no one will notice. IT Cell hasn't been able to counter the PM Cares fund used for mandir and many more issues. But on the other hand the left ecosystem is taking a completely new way of doing things each month or so a new news outlet with a clear intention of anti-BJP and anti-Hindu agenda is being made and the problem is that people cannot see their true face. Digital news is becoming a nuisance. These outlets are very properly spreading their propoganda without the person reading it notice this bc they want to be called intellectuals, we need to get rid of this intellectual wannabe fantasy of the youth. Whereas news outlets like op and swrajya are not considered valid by these 50% public bc these outlets are very open about their ideaology, they seem to be mouthpieces of hindutva. We need more centerist right leaning type outlets.\n\nSocial media influencers like Dhruv Tatti and right influencers like Sham Srhma. See if a alien had to sort their videos then he'd most likely put Dhruvs video in informational videos and shams video into a rant/funny videos category. That is bc the way dhruv does it. We lack such influencers. We need someone like Jordan Petersen, a lot of people have this potential of doing it. In simple words we already have Ben Shapiro we don't need more of them."<br />Author: 'BigBoy_Kid'<br />id: 'n6sddo'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
<li>Title: 'TIL : In 2008 Modi (BJP administration in Gujarat) demolished 300 temples in Gandhinagar that were illegally encroaching public space to make way for roads.'<br />Body: "He also arrested protesting VHP men and had them jailed, including the party's general Secretary .\n\nSuch Hindutva, such temple worship, so much communalism!\n\nNow imagine, ONE MOSQUE had been demolished by him in Guj for the same reasons? The shit storm that would have been raised would have been one of epic proportions!\n\nSources, [1](http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/vhpmodi-faceoff-on-demolition-of-temples/388528/). \n\nHe also evicted the BKS (farmers wing of the RSS) from it's Gandhinagar office for protesting the hike in power tariffs.\n\nSo let me repeat this,\n\nHe hikes power rates for the agricultural sector, something no other CM would dare do for fear of upsetting the farmer votebank\n\nHe then takes action against the RSS (a wing at any rate) because they protested against this decision?\n\nClearly, he is a man who takes a hard call and brooks no intra party dissension!\n\n[3](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/bks-forced-to-vacate-office/articleshow/398723.cms)\n\nThis is not OC.
