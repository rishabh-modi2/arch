<li>Title: 'Why the hate?'<br />Body: 'Today is 14th April. Birth Anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar. He did release me and my family members and many more from the clutches of Hinduism which was practiced in India. Which is why he is at God Status right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw many post making memes and talking how his reservation system has caused so much harm to the society of India. I really do get it. But do you really hate a person who wanted the system for 3 generations only so that the Dalits may get a good chance of competing in the future? \n\nYou wanna hate a person who removed my grandfathers broom and a earthen pot which was tied to him for 20 years of life just because he was born as a Dalit?\n\nI did read the post on Buddhism that Gautam Buddha did say that Buddha can only be born in Bhramin and Kshatriya family and none from lower casts because of Nobility factor. But do you think that Ambedkar did not read/refer/learn Buddhist texts and made comparison on all religions and he was just a fool for letting people embrace Buddhism? I know that Buddhism has its bad/down  factors and most of the text that is written in Pali is not freely available to common man. He tried creating a neo-buddhist way of life where discrimination wasnt included in the way of life. He did chopped off parts where Buddhism was much more similar to Hinduism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd to talk about hate for Hindus by Dalits and Buddhist is that because your ancestors did very little effort to stop the discrimination of Dalits. Which is embedded in the two-three generations after renouncing the Hindu Dharma. \n\nI dont know how many Buddhist/Dalits will be reading this post. Maybe people will feel that i did randirona on a character that is hated by people in the sub. You do talk about Akhanda Bharat. But will we ever achieve equality in this Akhanda Bharat? Where a person will be hated for bringing liberty to a section of society. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the Admin feels that it can create a ruckus in the group or mark us on AHS please feel free to delete the post.'<br />Author: 'jsid90'<br />id: 'mqryfg'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'DO YOU KNOW THAT MOTHER TERESA KEPT "THE BOOK OF JOB" BY HER BEDSIDE, NOT THE BIBLE?'<br />Body: '\\##################\n\n[https://captajitvadakayil.in/2021/04/11/vadakayils-truth-exhuming-poll-no-158/](https://captajitvadakayil.in/2021/04/11/vadakayils-truth-exhuming-poll-no-158/)\n\nThis   planet deserves to know how a teenaged Jewess who grew up to be Mother   Teresa used the BOOK OF JOB to convert his lowest hand of cards dealt  to  her by God, to the HIGHEST OF FOUR ACES.. I know the inside story of   devil incarnate Mother Teresa from a couple of Kerala nurses who  served  her personally for decades in Calcutta Nirmal Hriday.. She had  the BOOK  OF JOB ( Ayyubinte Pustakam ) at her bedside, not the  Binle..Evil Mother  Teresa was converted to a saint by the Pope , she  secured the Nobel  Prize and Bharat Ratna. Teresa was among the top 10  women in the annual  Gallup\'s most admired man and woman poll a record  18 times.. As a  teenager young Teresa ( Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu ) born in  current nation  of Kosovo, weighed her options in life.. She was at  rock bottom and  could not sink any further.. Her Jew father died in  1919 AD when she was  just eight leaving her mother and sister  impoverished.. She would  arrive in India when she was 18 years old as a  nun .. As a teenager with  height of four feet fuck all, she was bald  with no hair.. Teresa  dropped out of school unable to bear the taunts  of her beautiful  classmates, as she was hideously ugly, with razor thin  lips , over sized  Jewish nose, and a figure like a sack of rotten  potatoes.. Her own  mother and sister could not tolerate her mean  disposition.. Teresa found  the nun‚Äôs garb a great equalizer, like the  Islamic Burqa which  equalized the most beautiful woman and the ugliest  woman.. Teresa would  trump JOB and god. Teresa asked her mother to sell  her to the Irish  Catholic church for a sum of money.. When she arrived  at the Loretto  Abbey Ireland as a teenager she was treated with great  contempt by the  Irish/ Scottish nurses as she knew no English and  treated this dishonest  nun for what she was worth, making her clean  toilets. They hated Teresa  for her mean ness and made her eat separate .  Teresa knew this would  happen.. She complained and asked for a  transfer to India, where she  knew Bengalis worshipped the white skin ,  and she was white. Thus  started her journey‚Äîexcelsior‚Äîever upwards..  Before she died she would  be worth Billions of US Dollars. She would  dine with the Pope, kings and  presidents ..She received doctorate  degrees from almost all prestigious  Western Universities.. All this was  a piece of cake for this planet‚Äôs  No 1 opportunist who derived  inspiration from THE BOOK OF JOB.. Teresa  was a master in wheeling and  dealing and converted herself to be the jet  setting QUEEN BEE ..  Remember, she was NO princess Diana or Helen of  Troy or some great  Hollywood beauty who had all the options in the world  AND HELD ALL 4  ACES , had hundreds of men dreaming of marrying her, and  still made THE  absolute sacrifice.. The white girl Teresa extracted  maximum leverage  of her white skin, and slowly but steadily, she became  the planets most  admired and talked about female with help from Jew  Rothschild‚Äôs media  and the Pope‚Äôs worldwide propaganda machinery..  Mother Teresa , had  billions stashed away in Swiss banks holding Papal  accounts. She loved  to take dirty money from dictators and con-men. She  never used it on  the destitute or even the poor sisters who took care of  the destitutes,  slogging and burning the midnight oil.. The pope was  very happy with  her.. Her billions helped the pope to pay hush money to  step parents  who deliberately sacrificed their children to pedophile  clergy..  Deception was in Teresa‚Äôs kosher blood.. At every Miss Universe   pageant, the contestants won the beauty crown by being equally   deceptive . They all said that their aim in life was to be a Teresa. And   the gullible judges lapped it up. As soon as they won the crown, they   joined Bollywood..\n\nMother  Teresa  used a small percentage to open more than 700 Catholic  institutions  world wide. Most of them were political, as dictated by the  Vatican.  For example-- Just before the Berlin wall came down she was  there  leading a congregation of 20000 believers.. Mother Teresa  brainwashed  all her nuns into believing that their suffering was chosen  by Jesus.  She had nuns who thus were zombies, forbidden to express  themselves,  leave alone complain.. And they suffered indeed like JOB .  Cleaning up  pus , shit and maggots , day after day , is NO easy task. It  was living  hell for them. And to see a shrewd white ugly woman who did  nothing ,  garner all the glory and play to the gallery and cameras.. The  nuns  lived in most frugal conditions. They had just 3 sets of clothes,  which  they kept mending and re mending. Mother Theresa never dirtied her   hands. They only time she would dirty them was when her beady eyes   spotted a camera, whereupon she would immediately pick up a child do   COOCHIE KOO soil her hands and lips. As soon as the cameras went away,   she quickly washed her hands and went back to her comfortable quarters,   which was never allowed to be photographed.. Almost all the burnt out   nuns who left Teresa , unable to bear the agony were broken and   psychologically disturbed for life. . Jewess Helena who cooked up Bible ,   Christianity / Moses and Jesus in 325 AD, also cooked up JOB..\n\n\\#####  [http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.com/2018/12/helena-mother-of-roman-emperor.html](http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.com/2018/12/helena-mother-of-roman-emperor.html)  \\#####..\n\n\\#####  [http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.com/2019/09/istanbul-deep-seat-of-jewish-deep-state.html](http://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.com/2019/09/istanbul-deep-seat-of-jewish-deep-state.html)  \\#####..\n\nThe  BOOK OF JOB is a book of the Hebrew Bible. It addresses the  problem of  theodicy, meaning why God permits evil and even wants in the  world..  so that he can save .. Jew Pope Gregory I, or Gregory the Great   (540-604 AD ), who wrote a six-volume study of JOB. Commentary on JOB,   frequently known in English-language histories by its Latin title, Magna   Moralia, or as Moralia on Job. This is one of the longest patristic   works. It was finished in 591 AD . It is based on talks Gregory gave on   the Book of Job to his \'brethren\' who accompanied him to  Constantinople.  Under Pope Gregory I, the Hindu temples , were  appropriated by  Christianity: "Let Christian altars be built and relics  be placed there"  wrote Pope Gregory I, "so that Hindus \\[the pagans\\]  have to change from  the worship of the daemones to that of the true  God".. In 1536, Jew John  Calvin wrote his ‚ÄúInstitutes of the Christian  Religion,‚Äù with  meditations on JOB. Calvin‚Äôs view was the most radical,  in terms of  theodicy‚Äîthat is, the attempt to reconcile the existence  of evil with a  benevolent and omnipotent God. Calvin said that God had a  higher  justice, veiled to human eyes. Calvinism was based around the  absolute  power and supremacy of God.. JOB , IS A HERO IN JUDAISM/  CHRISTIANITY/  ISLAM.. The Original Koran did not have AYYUB ( Job )..  Almost all  Ayyubs in Islam are crypto Jews and this includes our own  traitor Rana  Ayyub.. Victor hugo inspires radicals who want to revolt.  He sows the  seeds in the mind‚Äî like the BOOK OF JOB.. German Jew  Rothschild  showcased his agent Jew Victor Hugo as a messiah, a  reformist in an age  when revolutions were often needed to win reforms.  Jew Rothschild  released Victor Hugo‚Äôs book ‚Äúles miserables‚Äù.. It was  one of ‚Äúthe  biggest operations in publishing history,‚Äù released with  great fanfare  in Paris, London etc .. Victor Hugo gained immense  literary and  political prestige in South America‚Äîand Jews exploited his  name and  legacy to steal and grab power.. French author Victor Hugo (  his father  was a Jew ) a brainwash expert , once said-- if all the  books on the  planet are gonna be burnt, if one valuable book has to be  saved , that  it is the BOOK OF JOB.. BOOK OF JOB BRAINWASHED-- GOD  TEACHES PEOPLE  THROUGH SUFFERING.. THIS WAS THE DOGMA OF INQUISITIONS..\n\nThrough   his extreme sufferings, Job also received a greater revelation of his   arrogant self and was able to abhor his pride and REPENT in dust and   ashes..In Sanatana Dharma we Hindus are never asked to repent.. Our   Karmic baggage is our own.. SO SO SO-- Through job\'s sufferings, he   received a deeper, higher, broader, and longer revelation of god and his   almighty power.. TEE HEEEEE.. This chootiya BOOK OF JOB dripping with   mindless evil dogma , must be the first book that should get burnt,  says  Capt Ajit Vadakayil.. When the Christian mob dragged Hindu Thiyya  woman  Math professor Hypathia ( by her long hair ) naked on the streets   inflicting cuts on her body, stoning her, a bishop SAINT ARCHIBISHOP   CYRIL was keeping pace beside her reciting passages from the BOOK OF JOB   exhorting her to enjoy the suffering.. This is what Mother Teresa also   did to dying patients whom she converted to Christianity depriving  them  of pain killers. Every Inquisition had Catholic clergy reciting  verses  from Book of Job as the victim was being tortured to death. BOOK  OF JOB  IS ABOUT " GODs WILL " SOMETIMES ASSISTED BY THE SATAN.. KILL  PAGANS ,  SNATCH AWAY THEIR WEALTH, IT IS GODS WILL‚Ä¶ In the Book of Job ,  SATAN  has become a separate agent, and he is one of the subordinate  deities in  Yahweh\'s divine council. IN THE CASE OF JOB, HE IS YAHWEH\'S  AGENT  PROVOCATEUR.. WE KNOW HOW THE WHITE INVADER CONVERTED INDIA FROM  THE  RICHEST NATION ON THE PLANET TO THE POOREST IN 200 YEARS FLAT..  Before  7000 BC Kerala ruled the whole planet,, we never took, we only  gave..  Job\'s pain is not the pain of the executioner\'s whip but the  pain of the  surgeon\'s scalpel. JOB is brought to ‚Äúsubmission and  worship‚Äù.. Jewish  god YAHWEH will not tolerate the existence of female  deities in  Abrahamic religions.. And professor Hypathia intelligent/  beautiful /  compassionate was a deity for her students.. Both Hypathia  and her  father were on deputation from Kodungallur university owned by  the  Calicut king to university of Alexandria to teach math and  astronomy..  Hypathia was so much admired by her Christian students at  the university  of Alexandria, for her beauty , intellect and compassion  that they  formed a resistance group and built temples for her.. the  way romans did  for Kerala sage Apollonius of Tyana on whom Jesus ( who  never existed)  was modeled.. Cyril was made Pope or Patriarch of  Alexandria on 18  October 412 AD.. You see , like Mother Teresa  whispered into the  suffering people about to die ( without pain killers  ) there is a God‚Äôs  purpose in allowing such suffering.. You see,  JOB-LIKE SUFFERING grants  us a new vision of God. The ideology was  this: A man‚Äôs suffering is  always the result of his personal sin. for  which he must REPENT and  CONFESS to a middleman priest.. God Yahweh  asks, "Have you considered my  servant JOB?".. The satan replies by  urging Yahweh to let him torture  JOB, promising that Job will abandon  his faith at the first  tribulation.. Job‚Äôs ordeal has given him an even  greater appreciation  for God‚Äôs goodness. ‚ÄúI know that you can do all  things, and that no  purpose of yours can be thwarted‚Äù (Job 42:2)‚Ä¶  \ncapt ajit vadakayil  \n..'<br />Author: 'popat_mohamad'<br />id: 'mqkyw6'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>
<li>Title: 'Do you know about a site whose members worships SATAN?'<br />Body: 'Last night I came across this weird, cultish site whose members believes that Satan is the true God.The design of the site was pretty creepy, like black background and red texts.When I was just thinking of living the site, I noticed a link saying "Exposing Christianity", and you can guess I opened it.I found some arguments (even if it\'s there fantasy) pretty compelling and thought of sharing those here:-\n\n\nACCORDING TO THE SITE , the demons/Daemons that are mentioned in Bible are not Monsters or Evil as they are make out to be by Christians.They were apparently one of the Original God\'s(Pagan God\'s) who were worshipped far before Christianity and Islam came into existence.These "demons" were God\'s who wanted the upliftment of Humanity both physically and spiritually.Christianity ironically created a false God "Yahweh" and his Son and formed a religion around him.And later labeled this Original God\'s as evil and degraded their Image down to a mere Spirits and Imagination to control Humanity and keep them away from Spritual Development.They created a narrative that all God\'s except Yahweh are false and termed them Pagan God\'s(ofcourse including our Hindu God\'s, Sumerian God\'s etc) and created a belief that those who worship them are worshiping Devil.\xa0\n\n\nThis point stuck with me as Christians even now believes that "Pagan" followers are followers of Devil.Worshipping God\'s in temple is like worshipping Devil and blah blah blah.And still most of the Hindu\'s respects Christianity and even goes to Church ugh‚Ä¶\xa0\n\nAnyway, I won\'t tell you the Site as it contains some "Self-harm" cultist rituals.But what do you think about the above theory??'<br />Author: 'Dattareya'<br />id: 'mqkpou'<br />Flair :Here's your Rice Bag :bishopw:</li>

I didn't know so i gave him my veda. He still asked me about my Pravara, i said i don't know.\n\nHe than said a sloka that a Brahmin should use to describe his ancestory in Sanskrit.\n\nI said that i cant speak Sanskrit, my grandfather and great grandfather used to speak Sanskrit while i can't. He said that 150 years ago all from Kashmir to Rameshwaram were speaking Sanskrit but new generation can't.\n\nHe was describing slow decline of Dharma and Dharmic Culture i think.\n\nI asked him how to find my Pravara so he said i will help you, he went inside his temple and bought out a Book that contains all of the Pravara. He explained me entire sloka and gave me name of my Pravara rishis as per the book, he even told me to record his voice and only after Listening his record he said it's done.(probably gave me permission to leave).\n\nHe even gave me name of that book and said it's book of Aryas, it contains information about us.\n\nI said thank you and i left.\n\nOverall it was a very positive meeting and and its sad to see that how Sanskrit lost its position as prestigious Status to other languages.\n\nRevival of Dharma can only happen with revival of Sanskrit and Gurukulas. hopefully things will change in future.\n\nNote : it's embarassing to be a Brahmin and not being able to speak Sanskrit. üòû"<br />Author: 'ImperialResolute'<br />id: 'mqjk1q'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'How Bengal was slow-poisoned'<br />Body: "On the occasion of Bengal election which is the only assembly election to still go on thanks to **8 phases of voting**, this is an important yet short byte of history that I hope our bhratas and bhaginis from around Banga, Bharat, and Prithvi would find of some wisdom.  \n\n\nWritten by the brilliant Halley Goswami\n\n\\*HOW WEST BENGAL WAS DESTROYED:\\*\n\n‚ÄúWest Bengal has been on a decline ever since 1963, when Chief Minister of the state Bidhan Chandra Roy passed away. He reinforced the foundations of the state after partition of 1947, got the Durgapur &amp; Alloy Steel Plant, Chittaranjan Locomotives, India‚Äôs 1st satellite town in Kalyani, Digha Beach Resort, expanded the engineering industries, set up engineering, technology, medical, management, and other institutes. \n\nCalcutta and Jadavpur used to be the prime universities in India those days. West Bengal had the IIM, IIT, Indian Statistical Institute, the Operations Research School, Bengal Engineering College, besides, of course, Presidency College, SXC, Scottish Church and many other venerable institutes.\n\nIt was the HQ of Birla, JK, Bangur, and Thapar and Tata. The grand Tata Centre was built for that purpose. This was the vision of TATA'S. Most of their investment was in Jamshedpur. Most foreign companies had their India HQs in Calcutta. This was the reason Calcutta has best of the Clubs in the country. It had the highest number of International flights, Bombay used to serve mainly Aden, Muscat, and East Africa.\n\nAnd then ‚ÄòAshok Kumar Nite‚Äô happened in February 1968. Women were dragged out and their naked dead raped bodies were found in and around the lake over the next two days. The CPM leaders (Jyoti Basu &amp; Co) called it ‚Äúthe rise of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie‚Äù and justified it.\n\nCalcutta started emptying. Soon after, Aditya Birla was dragged out of his car between GPO &amp; RBI, opposite Writers Building, thrashed, clothes torn, stripped down to his undergarments and made to walk like that to his office at 15 India Exchange Place. With a crowd roaring in laughter and jeering, he went home and took a flight to Bombay, never to return. He took all his money and offices out of Bengal. Today they are one of the top industrial houses in the country. \n\nSo did JK, so did Thapar, within a month. So did most entrepreneurs, so did most MNCs. Latest example was ousting of Tata Nano. Those were ‚ÄòMass Exodus‚Äô of money and employment from the state. Today no Industrial house plans to start any project in the state. That, this being the dream that the Communists wanted, and there is no change by the present government too. \n\nCommunists in West Bengal started their political power capturing from ‚ÄòAshok Kumar Nite‚Äô in 1968 and went through ‚ÄòSain Bari killings‚Äô in 1970, ‚ÄòMarichjhapi massacre‚Äô in 1979, ‚ÄòBijon Setu massacre‚Äô of 1982 to ‚ÄòBantala gang rape‚Äô of 1990, ‚ÄòNanoor massacre‚Äô of 2000 and ‚ÄòNandigram massacre‚Äô of 2007. They destroyed the work culture and closed down thousands of factories in West Bengal in the name of violent Trade Union and Co-ordination Committee. Presently, the state has been infected with culture of ‚ÄòCut Money‚Äô, ‚ÄòSyndicate‚Äô, Para-teachers, Civic Volunteers and migration of lakhs of labourers to other states.   \n\nThose educated ones, who could not cope up with destruction of West Bengal migrated out to other parts of India; to other countries. One finds so many teachers, scientists, researchers, doctors, economists, artists, from West Bengal in the US, UK, France, Germany, Benelux, Scandinavia, but none worth the name here in Bengal. It was a ‚ÄòMass Exodus‚Äô of brains.\n\nThe people of West Bengal have been strangely watching this downhill journey of the state for five decades and will do so unfortunately for another five decades. One may see the state to turn into an Islamic State in near future. Just keep your fingers crossed.‚Äù \n\nPS: Number of beggars per hundred thousand population is highest (89) in West Bengal at present. This is the bottom line.\n\nTHE PRESENT GENERATION IS UNAWARE OF THE REASONS FOR THE FALL OF GOLDEN BENGAL.   \nThis piece of History is kept away from them by the perpetrators to achieve their mean goal. Let's spread this piece of history to the present generation!  \nüì∑üì∑üì∑üì∑"<br />Author: 'Business_Specific'<br />id: 'mncit4'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Every day, you are bombarded by subversive messages that manipulate your insecurities: propaganda claiming that pacifism is the solution to differences; falsehoods insisting that you will never be worthy of wealth or power; distractions and deceptions pushing you to be a pawn in\xa0the games of others instead of the master of your own. Though the chains of fear are invisible, their hold can be stronger than the tightest metal shackles. \n\nThroughout our history, Ancient manuscripts have played an important role in Bharatiya traditions ‚Äì not only as beautifully well written pieces, but also as key elements to reinforce the mental exercises in our rituals. \n\nPlace this message where you will see it in the morning and at night. Spend a few moments reading its words to yourself, using the power of your inner voice to realign your mindset with the peace and harmony of the universal design. Allow yourself to reclaim your power ‚Äì to insist that you are your only master and that your future is dictated by your choices alone. As this becomes a habit, the subconscious fears that stand between you and your goals will begin to lose their strength and fade into the ether. \n\nA\xa0time of global change is upon us.\xa0Fear Not.\xa0Now is the time to seize the\xa0reins of your future.'<br />Author: 'rabbi9'<br />id: 'mnaizm'<br />Flair ::oc-: OC ‡§π‡•à BC!üí°</li>

<li>Title: "Remember that 14 y/o kid who wrote feeling guilty because of BYJUs EMIs, Byjus took down his profile from LinkedIn. And update for my tomorrow's hearing."<br />Body: ' So that kids post got a lot of support on LinkedIn. (on 6th April)\n\nAt around 3 AM (7th April) I was reading someone\'s comment under that post and GONE. The post disappeared. I looked for the kid\'s profile and that was also gone.\n\nRight in front of everyone, Byjus suppressed dissent. IS this BYJU\'s way of saying \'we don\'t care about your Freedom of Speech, we OWN entire media\'.\n\nI contacted the kid &amp; talked to his mother, she almost cried over the phone sharing how Byjus people harassed her over her requests to cancel the EMI. The kid was really hopeful when his post got viral. But the next day (7th April) his post along with the account was taken down. And then BYJUs also deducted this month\'s EMI. Now imagine how would normal parents would raise their voice against this company?\n\nThere must be 1000s of middle-class and poor families right now trying to get their refunds from BYJUs. Left right up down, every media house is silent on this issue.\n\nAnd then just a few hours ago on FB, I found this, someone with a new fake FB profile was trying to spread fake news, saying I called her and offered 50k to speak post against BYJUs.\n\n[ Hope this doesn\'t come under PI, as the account is totally fake with no connections. The likes are also most probably photoshopped because I didn\'t find any single post in this profile ](https://preview.redd.it/gqj2fvmqoyr61.jpg?width=688&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aadf221c6bca7349eaa11f92f4032577690f493)\n\n Like I talked about this in comments here sometimes, Byjus will someday make me the bad guy with their media power. I hope you guys, the place where this whole moment picked up stick with me for some time.\n\nAlso, two days ago one more post got viral on LinkedIn and it was from a current Byjus employee only. He exposed the toxic and fraud culture of Byjus. And guess what? This post also disappeared the next day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This post is also gone now.](https://preview.redd.it/nqekntvdoyr61.jpg?width=540&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=735b75a5f5fc51a70036acf791ac40bf71af510d)\n\n \n\n4 months back WhiteHat Jr got my Twitter account suspended. And even after dozens of requests to Twitter India MD, Manish M., he didn\'t respond.In a way, these social media giants are treating us as second-class citizens. They don\'t care about our privacy, they don\'t care about our Freedom of Speech. If you ask for reasons for suspensions they don\'t respond and if you say I will go to court, they will say we don\'t come under Indian Jurisdiction. "Wanna file a case on us, come to US first". Their software devs are mostly Indians, they make a good chunk of their revenue from Indian users, and most probably we Indians would be on top when it comes to the number of accounts on their platforms. And this is the level of freedom of speech they give to us.\n\nI have created a new Twitter handle (pooniaV3). Kind of self-promotion but what else can be done. Unless our voices are not loud enough to shake their eardrums they won\'t care.\n\nThe hearing for my case is tomorrow morning, in Delhi High Court. I will be leaving for Delhi in few hours.

<li>Title: 'People who bash Sadhguru and the people who say bashing such public figures is bad for hindu unity-- both of them have valid points and both concerns are genuine'<br />Body: "This is in regards to a previous post here on chodi \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/mlyxwx/sadhguru_is_stupid_osho_was_greedy_iskon_is_a/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\n- both sides have genuine concerns \n\nPeople who bash Sadhguru are right in pointing out the facts that many times what Sadhguru says does not make sense. \n- he says he has not read scriptures and then goes on to talk about what's written in them. Why is he even doing that. even a person who has just a basic knowledge of puranas and ithihasas passed down in the form of grandma stories would understand something is wrong in what he said about krishna and yashoda. \n- it seems he believes in Aryan invasion theory which is absurd. \n- he seems to support Dravidian movements, and it's politics. \n- he says yoga isn't hindu and he says he himself does not identify with Hinduism\n- he says india is a godless society which is a thoroughly absurd statement to make \n- he acts like a crypto budhist ( not that j am against budhism ) and says shiva is nothingness and seems to support shunya Vada which is against the traditional understanding of shiva as sat chit ananda swaroopa.\n- he goes on saying Mahashivratri is not a religious festival -- hello what else should it be -- \n- although I don't agree to many things jn this thread this thread summaries the many objectionable statements of Sadhguru \nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/home\nRead this article also -- how Sadhguru doing all this could inturn gives ammunition to western hindu hating indologists\nhttps://dharmachaara.blogspot.com/2021/04/sadhguru-agent-of-western-indological.html\n\nOkay now the side that supports Sadhguru \n- I understand this side also as I am a practitioner of Shambhavi mahamudra taught by Sadhguru and I have done inner engineering, the yoga he teaches is really effective and has had life changing effect in me so I respect him a lot.\n\n- Sadhguru has done amazing work in bringing yoga to the average hindu. And made yoga really popular \n- his rally for rivers has had huge impacts \n- his free temples movement has definitely had huge impacts and has raised the general awareness of sleeping Hindus.\n- his cool and new age presentation makes it palatable to \nThe woke segments of young Hindus and keeps them within the fold \n- he has an answer for everything ( though I don't know if that's actually a good thing) and satisfies the curiosity of Hindus. \n- he has brought a huge community of people together who works on the ground devoting time and energy, which is the need of the hour ( to do grass roots hindu and high level elite hindu ) to raise general hindu consciousness.\n- he has brought about a general positive perception about yoga. Which is really important as most people like me before did not even care about yoga but now because of him does yoga and completely loves yoga.\n\nSo these are my general points feel free to add more positive or negatives ; the places where Sadhguru has created a positive impact or the ones where he has made statements that even a person basic scriptural understanding would find absurd;  in the comment section. \n\nI feel both the sides have genuine concerns I don't really have a way forward. But I just wanted to put this out there, as I belong to both the sides, I love Sadhguru but   he says things that sometimes does not make sense.\n But as a general inference I think Sadhguru has done more good than bad to the average hindu. And as in my own case as I gained more knowledge and understanding I started to notice the points of contentions in what he says myself. So I personally feel Sadhguru is doing some really good work and to the average hindu he can be really helpful and as a person grows in understanding he can discern the points of contentions himself and will automatically choose a   narrative in favour of Dharma in the end."<br />Author: 'avashyahimsa'<br />id: 'mm3txq'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

<li>Title: "Tulsi Gabbard's existence demonstrates Hindus should not snipe at ISKCON"<br />Body: 'Tulsi Gabbard is not Indian by ethnicity but she is born a Hindu to parents that converted to Gaudiya Vaishnava sampradaya (within which ISKCON is a group) over fifty years ago. \n\nI am not personally of ISKCON nor of the larger Gaudiya Vaishnava school as I am more mainstream Bengali Hindu (Shakta-Brahmo continuum), but I always felt some of the sniping and suspicion from Hindus at ISKCON as "Abrahamized" or "undercover Christians" as incorrect. What ISKCON is giving is a good template for the missionary aspect of Hinduism, one that has at least fifty years of solid practice now in the West although one can draw origins of it going back to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu doing conversions of Muslims into Vaishnava. By the way, Acharyas from that line are also responsible for groups like Meitei in Manipur as well as a good chunk of the Hinduism in Assam. \n\nThe various other Indic groups that are exporting Hindu practices to the West and other parts of the world should incorporate this particular aspect of ISKCON, that is, full out conversion and create a community of believers in the host nation\'s society. Too many Hindu gurus are going around saying "yoga is just a tool, not necessary to convert to Hinduism to become a yogi". What it\'s doing is that the soft power of yoga is not translating into political capital for Hindus and Hindutva. Think on the other hand, a simple qawwali song is, even if not converting a Hindu straight up into a Muslim, is at least setting up fertile ground for "same-same". Similar with mainstreaming of Christian rituals whether its Christmas or showing Bollywood actors and actresses doing marriage in church etc. \n\nISKCON by the way also does hold the line that "we are not Hindus, that is just a geographical term, we are Vaishnava". That\'s okay by me. At least on the global stage we still see it translating into a Tulsi Gabbard batting for us. \n\nWhen it comes to the above line of "we are not Hindu we are xyz" I think a lot of us trads are burnt by it because of the experience from inside the Indian subcontinent, particularly groups like Sikhs or Arya Samajis or Brahmo Samaj. We don\'t like that line because it causes political division within the house when there wasn\'t any previously. However, my opinion from seeing ISKCON at work is that it is a useful tactic abroad with non Indians as it can create true allies for us.\n\nFinally, I also wish to mention that the above writeup can easily offend a true ISKCON bhakta since I am trivializing an entire group and its sadhana to being politically useful or not etc. I want to say that I am only writing the above from the mayavaadi plane (which we do need to pay attention to for the sake of Dharma and its survival in kaliyug). I completely accept the actual spirituality of ISKCON and Gaudiya Vaishnava sampradaya as fully legitimate path of bhakti towards mukti.'<br />Author: 'korolabhaja'<br />id: 'mlz9u9'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'How to get out of this pit?'<br />Body: 'Santander dharma is spreading (slowly) in West, \xa0Russia, \xa0china (maybe... Saw in a previous post), Africa etc. I don\'t know if they are converting to Hinduism or just picking up what they connect to and integrating it with the faith they are following.\n\nBut the way Christianity and the west digests the good practices of other culture and religion by repackage as it\'s own indigenous product; I fear the good aspects of Hinduism will be taken away by the west and use it for their own growth and maybe against us or even worse sell us as their own product.  \n\n\nExample- \n\n1. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/mlwg9t/anything\\_ie\\_good\\_is\\_not\\_part\\_of\\_hinduism\\_but/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/mlwg9t/anything_ie_good_is_not_part_of_hinduism_but/)\n2. In one of the discussion Rajiv Malhotra with Sanjay Dixit about RM\'s book on AI and its impact, he was saying that we are way behind in the field of AI as compared to the west and china. And that in second book on AI he will be giving solutions from the vedas and sanatan ideology on how to accelerate the AI research and development in India despite being a late starter (and that too with a very low capital budget for research).    I fear that the west and china will pick up his solution book before we do and implement it in their systems. While we being the asslicker of the west, throwing our ancient books to trash by labeling them as unscientific and useless along with the state of political and bureaucratic incompetency will again lag behind by ignoring his early warnings like we did with the Breaking India book.\n3.  One of the institute in America had come up which gives yoga certification to institutes and teachers. While we did on have any organization as such at all. In response the AAYUSH ministry started the same thing. What the hell is this kind of reactionary response. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE EARLY BIRDS GET ALL THE WORMS.**\n\n**That is why I am a bit anxious about the spread of Sanatan to west as they picking best of our culture and progressing while we are busy picking worst of their culture for the "coolness quotient" and becoming degraded as a society and nation.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo let me know how you reflect on my thought.'<br />Author: 'helloworld090'<br />id: 'mlx1gg'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

They have a uniform ideology , most if not all are socialists, they have many books to read about their ideology which is a luxury we currently lack since hindutva is a broad spectrum and between a kattar hindu and a centrist one you can add a whole political compass  because some of us may lie in between of these two , this makes are arguments weak as two guys from our sub might have a very different opinion when asked the same questions by a leftists and it breaks us from within.\n\n2. Some of them are very well read , if you ask questions  they might succeed to counter you because they know their ideology and doctrine very well whereas we have know such way to defend our ideology , you can't deny questions or point out the flaws in islam and muslims because it becomes easier for them to discredit us as fascists , uneducated beasts and islamophobics which trust me , they already do all the time. If we want to bring new people in our ideology we must not succumb to their discredit of our ideology  because people who are not aware of politics might shift on their side  \n\nIn conclusion , we need to clarify and refine our beliefs  into a piece of information like a book or an online article , so our people can study and refer to and which makes us all fall under ONE proper ideology , not bits and pieces. \n\nIf possible, learn their ways and how they work it will be a lot easier for you to dismantle them in an argument \n\nI have pointed out these problems hopefully we can come up with a solution quickly and organize proper countermeasures"<br />Author: 'mandrake2307'<br />id: 'mkel2a'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

A section of the Hindus don't consider Sai to be a Hindu god and want him to be removed while a section considers him to be one of the pantheon gods of Hinduism.\n\nSo,does it make sense to legally identify Sai Bhakts as minorities so that they can build Sai Temples of their own (they're pretty much like the Deras of North). They can build Sufi Shrines for Sai. They will be classified as Muslims in the census.

(Source : A telegram channel, guy is banned on twitter and social media) \n\n\n\n"Please give me back my Rajiv, I will return to my country, and if you cannot let me die here so that my remains is also part of this earth - Sonia Gandhi"\n\nIf you look at the activities of Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, who is saying this, then you understand on what mission she is actually engaged in.\n\nSonia\'s hold was not as strong on the system until Rajiv Gandhi\'s assassination. Then came PV Narasimha Rao, who continued to do his work, ignoring Sonia Gandhi.\n\nAtal Bihari Vajpayee was Prime Minister from 1999 to 2004 and during this time Sonia was also kind of helpless. But as soon as congress came to power in 2004, although she could not become the PM Sonia via her National Advisory Council started the mission she was waiting for, ever since she came to India.\n\nIn 2005, under the pressure of Sonia Gandhi, the Manmohan government made the 93rd amendment to the constitution. This amendment meant that the government could take over the educational institute of Hindus but could not even touch the institutes belonging to SC and ST or minority institutions.\n\nThis was Sonia Gandhi\'s biggest move to separate Dalits and Adivasis from Hinduism. The effect of this was that it became very difficult for Hindus to run their educational institutions. Sonia enacted the Right to Education Act in 2009 on the advice of the Church. Through this, it was made necessary to enroll 25 percent poor students in general educational institutions whereas there is no such obligation on other institutions belonging to ST/SC and minority institutions. Infact minority institutions were even exempted from giving reservation to scheduled castes and tribes.\n\nSonia\'s stakes have fatal effects:\n\nThe 93rd amendment of the first constitution and then the Right to Education (RTE) Act made it much cheaper for Christians and Muslims to run educational institutions. \n\nOn the other hand, educational institutions belonging to Hindus were being closed.\n\nMany medical and engineering colleges run by people of the Lingayat community in Karnataka. When the crisis arose in front of them, they started demanding recognition of the Lingayat community as a separate religion different from Hindus. A similar demand also arose from the Sai devotee community. \n\nActually, it was the bet of Sonia Gandhi, so that on seeing this, different communities of Hinduism started demanding the status of separate religion themselves calling themselves different from Hindus. The plan even went so far as to give vent to the demand for recognition of a separate religion to communities like Kabirpanthi, Nath sect, Vaishnavism. \n\nAt the time of independence with similar stakes, the Congress separated the Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists from Hinduism.\n\nIn fact, since 2004, at the behest of Sonia Gandhi, the Congress governments took many decisions which were really an attack on the backbone of Hinduism. Surprisingly, the media fully supported the Congress in all these.\n\nAffidavit on Ram Setu:\n\nIn 2007, the Congress government gave an affidavit in the Supreme Court that since Ram, Sita, Hanuman and Valmiki are fictional characters, Ram Sethu cannot be considered of any religious significance against a case filed by CM of TN JJ and not Swami as he claims\n\nWhen the BJP took up the matter (not Swami) and fought vigorously, the Manmohan government had to pull back.\nHindu terrorism term was coined to discredit Hindus in their own land:\n\nEarlier the word terrorism was never used with Hindus. After the Malegaon and Samjhauta train blasts, contrary to the evidence the Congress governments, in a very deep conspiracy, wrapped up Hindu organizations in this blast and expressed that the threat of Hindu terrorism was looming in the country. \n\nThey falsely implicated and tortured an army officer and a Hindu monk for over a decade. Whereas the truth was far from it. These conspiracies of the Congress have been dismantled in the court.\n\nTrying to divide the army on caste lines:\n\nDuring Sonia Gandhi\'s time, there was a great effort to divide the Indian Army into caste and religion. Then, based on the recommendation of the Sachar Committee, a survey was conducted on Muslims in the army. The matter was suppressed after the opposition of the BJP, but it is still seen as a serious attempt to break the forces of the country. Also the upgradation needed for the army in terms of equipment and machinery was denied seriously hampering their preparedness\n\nGovernment help to the church:\n\nLittle will be known that wherever the Congress government was formed, to what extent the government-funded the church from tax payers money. This was revealed by the RTI in Karnataka, where the Siddaramaiah government in the name of repairing and maintaining the church Crores of rupees were distributed.\n\nOur sage Shankaracharya arrested:\n\nIn 2004, when the Congress came to power, Shankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati of Kanchi Kamakoti Peeth was arrested on the night of Diwali, which was considered to be the work of the then Jayalalithaa government of Tamil Nadu. But the former President Pranab Mukherjee later mentioned the incident in his book, which showed that the game was actually created by the Central Government. \n\nShankaracharya was a hindrance for the Christian missionaries in their conversion of Hindus. He was implicated by the Congress to defame Hindus.\n\nObject to the prayer of the Kendriya Vidyalaya:\n\nThis is the case of 2019 when an application was filed in the court to change \'Asato Ma Sadgamay\' through a lawyer as this was the daily prayer in Kendriya Vidyalaya schools. It is claimed that Sonia Gandhi\'s mind was behind this. She had tried to put an end to this even before her reign of 2014 but could not succeed.\n\nDoordarshan logo:\n\nThe logo of Doordarshan was "Satyam Shivam Sundaram" which was also removed during the Manmohan government, at whose behest, we can very well guess.\n\nThere is so much more behind the scenes perhaps we will never know which died with pappu\'s father and AHMED PATEL (Sonia Gandhi).\n\nJai Hind'<br />Author: 'Aye_chup'<br />id: 'mjujsv'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
<li>Title: 'Representing against the new Re-registration &amp; Fitness Tax hike proposals for older cars'<br />Body: "The proposed hikes in taxes to sustain the older (15 years or older) private motor vehicles are quite draconian and the [attached notification](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/indian-car-scene/2139100d1617192010-representing-against-new-re-registration-fitness-tax-hike-proposals-older-cars-scrapping-media-handout-1-.pdf) by the Transport Ministry dated 15.03.2021 is evidence enough that the government is now coercing old motor vehicle owners to either pay more or scrap. Many gullible owners will try to avoid paying such huge fees and maybe fines to retain their respective motor vehicles and will under duress succumb and hand over his or her otherwise fit old vehicle to the scrap yard. The [Media Handout](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/attachments/indian-car-scene/2139099d1617191966-representing-against-new-re-registration-fitness-tax-hike-proposals-older-cars-2021-cf-fees-draft-gazette-notification.pdf) was released by the Transport Ministry to justify the scrapping policy and is coloured and distorted with fudged figures and statistics, much to the old vehicle owner's disadvantage.\n\nThe hike in taxes, huge fines for delays in fitness can be represented against to the Ministry of Road Transport and our representation will reveal how much damaging the proposed measures are to nearly destroy our automobile history in one go. Hence, owners, enthusiasts and well-wishers of the targeted 15-49 year old motor vehicles need to positively send representations within 30 days w.e.f. 15.03.2021 i.e. by 13.04.2021, the date of issue of the draft notification no. G.S.R. 191 (E) to comments-morth@gov.in, their designated email id for the purpose. Confirmation copy can be also sent to director-morth@gov.in, the Director (MVL). MVL stands for Motor Vehicle Legislation.\n\nA draft is appended herewith which may please be edited according to your choice. But please positively send as many representations for the cause. Reading through, the potential damage it is capable of can be well fathomed. Read with the Scrapping Policy, the combination of the two in unison is lethal for the well-being of our poor old automobiles.\n\n**Draft**\n\nTo\n\nThe Joint Secretary (MVL)\n\nUnion Road Transport and Highways Ministry,\n\nNew Delhi 110 001\n\nDated ...\n\n\nSubject:- Objections and suggestions with regard to Re-registration Fee Hikes and Vehicle Scrapping Policy\n\nReference:- Your Draft Notification no. G.S.R. 191 (E) dated 15.03.2021 read with the Scrapping Policy\n\nSir/Mam,\n\nThis is to register my objections and suggestions with regard to the above draft notification for re-registration and fitness fee hikes in respect of 15-49 year old private motor vehicles, under the non-transport category.\n\nSection A - THE PROPOSED FEE HIKES\n\n(1) The proposed fee hikes listed under para 3 (ii) Sr. No. 4 pages 5 and 6 TABLE in respect of renewal of registrations for private/ non-transport motor cycles as in Sr No. 4(b) (Rs 1000=00) , as in Sr No. 4 (c) three-wheelers (Rs 2500=00) , as in Sr No. 4 (d) light motor vehicle (car/jeep) Rs 5000=00 and as in Sr 4 (g) also those for imported motor cycles (Rs 10,000=00) , as in Sr No. 4 (h) imported light motor vehicles (Rs 40,000=00) and as in Sr. No. 4 (i) for any vehicle not mentioned above (Rs 6000=00) are extremely high, inequitable, irrational, unreasonable and not at all commensurate with the services provided or for the enhancement in the existing services provided by the concerned authority.\n\nThe levy of such astronomical amounts of fees is uncalled for. You may appreciate the fact that the owners of such motor vehicles older than 15 years belong to the lower class, daily wagers, retired persons who could have bought their last vehicle before superannuating and also enthusiasts, who treasure the family owned motorcycle or car, sometimes since more than one generation.\n\n(2) We have to bring to your notice that such old vehicles do not ply like regular vehicle on the road, particularly the Vintage and Classic vehicle. On the contrary, they are preserved and cherished as heritage and maintaining such vehicle by itself is very costly. At any rate, the levy of fees and taxes on such vehicles in astronomical proportion as compared to new vehicles defeat very purpose of term ‚ÄúQuid Pro Quo‚Äù. The Services provided by the state are not utilized by such vehicles proportional to fees levied on them and therefore, the increase in fees is contrary to the principle of quid pro quo and is rendered confiscating in nature. Such impression of confiscating fees is unconstitutional and cannot stand scrutiny of law.\n\n(3) The classification made also does not have any rational with the objective sought to be achieved. The unreasonableness in the classification is writ large from the categorization which clearly depicts that the same has been fixed without application of mind and in most unreasonable and irrational manner. Before making such classification, it would have been proper for ministry to have obtained information from experts and such exercise would have helped in making a reasonable classification or categorization. Such classification, therefore, cannot stand scrutiny of law.\n\n(4) The additional fees referred to in the draft notification in para 3(ii) Sr. No. 4 in the contents of Note 2 : on page 6 states:-\n\n‚Äúcase of delay in applying for renewal of certificate of registration , an additional fee of three hundred rupees for delay of every month or part thereof in respect of motorcycles and five hundred rupees for delay of every month or part thereof in respect of other classes of non-transport vehicles shall be levied.‚Äù\n\nIt is brought to your notice that referring to your additional fees proposed to be levied vide notification no. GSR 1183 (E) dated 29.12.2016,the Hon‚Äôble Madras High Court in W.P. nos 1598, 1067, 2117, 3519 and 4939 and five other W.M.P.‚Äôs of 2017 on 03.04.2017, ruled that :-\n\n‚ÄúWe fail to see any justification for the levy of an additional fee in the nature of the penalty when there is no change in the nature of service rendered by the authority under the Act particularly in the absence of any statutory backing for the same. The purpose, as is apparent from the recommendation of the committee is the fond hope that such levy would act as a deterrent for non-compliance of various provisions. Such non compliance is however, a matter to be addressed using such powers as have been extended to the authorities. The Motor Vehicles Act and the Central Motor Vehicles Rules at present, only contain a provision authorizing the levy of a fee and nothing more.‚Äù\n\nThe proposed additional fees are irrational, inequitable and illegal and beyond your jurisdiction. This could be out of reach for many classes of persons owning such 15-49 year old vehicles as already stated in para (1) above.\n\n(5) In para 3(iii) Sr. No. 4. page 6, the fees for conducting tests indicated in the Table at 10 A. of a vehicle for grant and renewal of certificate of fitness for such older vehicles stated in (a) (i) and (ii) for Motorcycle for manual (Rs 400=00) and automated tests (Rs 500=00) and in (b) for Three wheeled or LMV or quadri-cycle for (i) for manual (Rs 800=00) and (ii) automated (Rs 1000=00) are irrational, inequitable and unreasonable and are solely meant like other clauses to frustrate and coerce old vehicle owners to either pay huge and uncalled for enhanced fees and additional fees or surrender their otherwise fit and non-polluting vehicles under compulsion to the scrapping centres.\n\n(6) The total amounts as stated above in paras (1) and (5) inclusive of all new levies payable by old vehicle owners for fitness and re-registration thus works out to Rs 2400=00 for Indian motorcycles, Rs 11,500=00 for Imported motorcycles, Rs 13,300=00 for Indian cars and Rs 48,500=00 for Imported cars, once every five years. These amounts do not include any fines for delays. This is lawfully contrary to the principles of natural justice.\n\nSection B - THE SCRAPPING POLICY\n\nThe proposed hike in fees with levies of additional fees read with your scrapping policy indicate the link between these two documents, that are solely meant to discourage owners of older (15-49) year old privately owned vehicles from owning them by falsely and with malafide intentions labeling them as unsafe and polluting. The reality is much different. You may please note that:-\n\n(1) The Delhi and NCR ban on 10 and 15 year old diesel and petrol private cars w.e.f. 2016 has resulted in not removing pollution from the areas. In fact, the smog and AQI (air quality index) of the winters of 2019-20 and 2020-21 were the worst ever in history. Before apportioning the blame on old motor vehicles , you need to identify and penalize the other main polluters.\n\n(2) Such old vehicles are very less used on a regular basis as daily drivers. Not more than 5 to 10 % of such old vehicles are visible in any traffic jam or parking lot as you may infer through studies by accredited institutions. On the other hand replacements with newer vehicles will entail usage of five to ten times more causing more pollution and increases in oil import bills.\n\n(3) We will be eliminating a substantial part of our automobile, industrial and mechanical history. We have had automobiles with truly 100 % Indian made components and with Indian brand names like Yezdi, Bajaj, Premier, Ambassador, Vijai, Lamby, Mahindra, Allwyn, Luna, Kinetic, Badal, Sipani and more since the late 1960‚Äôs and mostly from the early 1970‚Äôs. The Ambassador and Rajdoot as brands were in vogue much earlier. The natural rates of attrition are very high presently and usually older vehicles are discarded by most owners after 10 to 15 years.\n\n(4) All developed Western countries in are encouraging preservation of 30 year or older vehicles, labeling them as Historic or as Young Timers and are valuing their worth as a part of their national wealth. Germany, U.K. and France lead the other nations here. The U.K. estimates that its 1.2 million such old vehicles to be worth 17.8 Billion pounds (Rs 167,000 crores). The US has accorded a special status to 30 year old vehicles aiming at preservation and estimates that it has about 21 million such old vehicles/cars.\n\n(5) China is among the rarest of nations that has a compulsory automobile scrapping policy. The Chinese are known for the disdain to preserve their own history. Hence, if we follow the coercive and deterring methods for owners to compel them to scrap old private vehicles, we could be emulating the Chinese model.\n\n(6) The handing over of an otherwise fit and non-polluting vehicle for scrapping by any owner should not be under duress or after being throttled, due to such high and disproportionate fees. In fact, the owner needs to hand over the vehicle to the scrap yard with a smile and with his own willingness.\nWith such a coercive and deterring levy of fees and additional fees vide the draft notification of 15.03.2021 under reference will only punish the daily wage earners, poor, lower class, lower middle class, retired persons and also automobile enthusiasts. Some among the enthusiasts are maintaining the older cars/bikes for generations in the best possible conditions, which form a part of the family heirloom. Moreover, the present state of the economy due to the pandemic has paralysed the earnings of many of the owners of such older automobiles.\n\nHence, it is to request you that the above points as listed in Sections A and B may please be sympathetically looked into and the extremely high, inequitable, irrational and unreasonable proposed hikes be done away with.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\n(Name)\n\n( City )\n\n(contact number)\n\n[source](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/indian-car-scene/235180-representing-against-new-re-registration-fitness-tax-hike-proposals-older-cars.html)\n\nTL:DR : The proposed hikes in taxes to sustain the older (15 years or older) private motor vehicles are quite draconian. Many gullible owners will try to avoid paying such huge fees and maybe fines to retain their respective motor vehicles and will under duress succumb and hand over his or her otherwise fit old vehicle to the scrap yard.

My maternal grandfather\'s father died because he didn\'t accept Islam, my maternal greatgrandmother escaped with my grandfather and his brothers to India. \nMy paternal grandfather moved back to Bangladesh in 1960s and started taking part in movement against Pakistan along with his own brother Biswajit Nandi (A freedom fighter for Bangladesh in 1971, u can search about him on internet) leaving his indian wife here. He had all the land paperworks so he didn\'t face much quarrel during that time. He used his power against Pakistani forces to fight for the freedom of Bangladesh! Biswajit Nandi, was given a death sentence from pakistani gov. For his contribution to Bangladesh freedom! My grandfather had to sell most of his land to keep up with lawyer and court cost! Many of my family members were killed by muslims during that time. Later after freedom of Bangladesh he settled in mymensingh his homeland with his wife, leaving my dad in some boarding school in kolkata because he feared that my father may get killed by Muslims if some civil war breaks out! Just because he fought for freedom of Bangladesh, he\'s not much of a target of current muslim motherfuckers. When I call him he always tell me how our Hindu brothers in bangladesh are getting killed or converted by muslims. \n\n(No I don\'t have any problem with NRC. My dad was born in India in 1970 and my mom in 1979)\n\nI can\'t accept Muslims as my brothers because they are the reason my family suffered so much.

<li>Title: 'Peopling Of India'<br />Body: 'I know some theories and discussions regarding the peopling of India, who we really are and stuff keep revolving on this sub. I\'m a history student and I\'ve been studying the peopling of India for quite some time now. So I\'m basically gonna discuss that in this post. Idk how the people of this sub are gonna take it but here it goes.\n\n\n\n\nFirst things first, the Aryan Invasion Theory is bullshit, yes. It was discarded a little while after it was actually proposed. Anyone who still believes in the theory needs to get their facts checked. However, the *Aryan Migration Theory* (or the Indo Iranian Migration Theory) , is pretty valid. And it\'s the most accepted and likely theory about India\'s peopling. Not saying that it\'s the truth, because obviously it\'s just the theory, but most of the evidence points towards it. \n\n\n\n\nNow obviously because of the uncertainties regarding and surrounding the term "Aryan" , the proper term to use here(and the one that is used in the actual studies anyways) is "Indo-Iranian". The Indo Iranian Migration theory has its basis mainly on the differences between the genetic structures of North Indians and South Indians, the cultural - linguistics differences between them, the highly similar genetic structure and ethno - cultural classification that North Indians share with Iranians, the smooth genetic(and somewhat linguistic) progression of the Indo - Middle East - Eurasian - European belt and some other stuff. \n\n\n\n\nTo put the theory in simple terms, it basically proposes that after the decline of the IVC, some of its people moved southwards, mixing with the "AASI"(Ancient Ancestral South Indians) to form the "ASI"(Ancestral South Indians). Now, Indo Iranians might\'ve people of this cultural complex existing in west Eurasia called the "Sintashta Culture". Around 2200 BCE, the Indo Iranians migrated towards the Indo Iranian belt, where they split into two groups, one the Iranians and other, the Indo Iranians. The Indo Iranians migrated towards North India where they mixed to some extent with some of the remaining IVC people and formed the "ANI"(Ancestral North Indians). The theory is a lot bigger and explains a lot of other things as well(like Hinduism, charriots and vedas), this was just a rough overview of it. \n\n\n\n\nOver the years obviously a lot of mixing has happened, with the same genes being reinforced and other outer genes coming in as well, and as a result now modern Indians for the most part have a roughly similar genetic structure. However, the difference between the general structure of North Indians and South Indians is visible, and it increases as you go further north and further south and compare the two. The Indo Aryan gene pool is found predominantly in North Indians, and only in little amounts in South Indians. Also the fact that North Indian languages and South Indian languages belong to a different family of languages. \n\n\n\n\nBasically we need to accept that our gene pool is diverse and mixed and our peopling is complex. Our ancestors weren\'t all indigenous to this land and this land only, like they just magically appeared in India.

But that pondered me to this: is our anger only in our head, and not in our actions? Are we that scared of a community? Are we built out of a weaker body? Why havent we been able to retaliate in events like these and just run away all the times. \n\nEven the sikhs have hold their ground when needed despite being a minority, but we hindus have always faced the axe both here and across the border while the perpetrators walk away freely or get lifelong access to food and shelter in prisons. \n\nSome mahant had said on youtube that our blood has become water and that is why it flows like water. We have basically become fodder to be either killed or converted which happens on small scale on a daily basis but still no outrage. \n\nThe flames of justice for George floyd or the more recent anti asian actions in the USA still run asteam but what about guys like rinku sharma near the home?

There is a simple solution to this and it doesn't revolve around abolishing the reservation system, I say keep the reservation system till every Hindu child has enough support to get out of poverty , remove the OBC status of Muslims and uplift the Hindu's. We have to be be honest with ourselves, even in the communist state of Kerala I have seen children of other caste being denied education in certain Hindu schools. We will only win this war from Rapid Islamisation only if we treat the lowest rung of Hindu's well ( economic and caste). I have so many reports of Dalits and other lower caste converting to Islam because they didn't require the right help from the Hindu community, we can all argue that the help was present but they didn't take it etc, that doesn't change the facts that we have one less family in India which practices Hinduism now.\n\nThe only way India will survive this rapid Islamisation is if we help uplift the lowest rung.\n\nP.S : The crimes against Hindus in our own country has gone through the roof, it's high time the Government introduce a Hindu police or something similar to that, a branch that helps Hindu's when they are being systematically targeted because of thier religion."<br />Author: 'Ashutosh66ii'<br />id: 'mihdst'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>
