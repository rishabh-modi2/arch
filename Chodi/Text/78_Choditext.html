If these people choose right kind of “narratives”, Indian cinema would no longer have to tolerate “selmon bhois”. But communists being communists, choose to run morose and surly propaganda about the country at the orders of their overlords. Vivek agnihotri tries to push moderate right wing narrative, with average skills,average budgets and has-been actors as part of the cast, Films try to deliver the truth, but turn out to be jejune like Tashkent Files and The Accidental Prime Minister.

Very few things were taboo, and the assimilation power of this religion was its core strengths. That explains why we have factions like aghoris, goddesses like Chamunda ( which was a tribal goddess later assimilated into hinduism ), even atheists all come under the grand umbrella.\n\nI have also observed that Islam is extremely repressive, demanding absolute control over the lives of its followers, trying to control each and every aspect of it from what they eat to what they wear. This fine grain authoritarian aspect places it in the opposite extreme of Hinduism, but still counts as its power and what makes it widespread.\n\nIndia is somewhat unique, in that Hindus have survived. Countless years of Islamic rule was not enough to absorb us all and make India an islamic country ( how bad would that have sucked, huh ).  But this survival was not without its cost. Islam has influenced the way the way we have lived, somewhat repressed, as second class citizens in our own countries during the Sultanate and Mughal period. And I believe living under fear makes people conservative. I would like to extend this argument that coexisting with Islam has rubbed on to us, making us divert from open-ness. It's not our fault, but it is how it is.\n\nI thus, whatever chance I get, like to publicise open-ness and liberalism, and hope we don't walk the path of extreme fundamentalism that is walked by mo's followers. \n\nSidenote: According to the historian Didorus, Indians favoured love marriages ( \\~ 50 BCE )\n\nEnd-note: I don't claim that everything was a perfect utopia in the past. And I don't think any sane person would claim it either. Humanity in general have progressed in all aspects. But what I talk is relative. \n\n&lt;rant-samapt&gt;"<br />Author: 'candid-paint-slinger'<br />id: 'gnvrt9'<br />Flair :Rant</li><li>Title: 'Secularism Level 100'<br />Body: 'Have anyone from woke liberals condemn the tweet posted by Pankaj Poonia?\nOr this also have been brushed under the carpet like everything else?'<br />Author: 'chutiya_nandan'<br />id: 'gnul7t'<br />Flair :Rant</li><li>Title: 'Just a reminder that the west is not our friend'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'KnaughtyKnight'<br />id: 'gnujow'<br />Flair :Rant</li><li>Title: 'Just a reminder of how the west thinks of us'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'KnaughtyKnight'<br />id: 'gnuhfr'<br />Flair :Rant</li><li>Title: 'Pataal Lok IMDb brigading by IT Cell'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'xxiwisk'<br />id: 'gnthyg'<br />Flair :Randia Simulation</li><li>Title: 'Ban TikTok Petition'<br />Body: '[http://chng.it/TzX4yJpGWC](http://chng.it/TzX4yJpGWC)'<br />Author: 'HardekAilawadi'<br />id: 'gntcdu'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'post your unpopular opinions bakchods'<br />Body: 'go go go..'<br />Author: 'NormalBaba'<br />id: 'gnswr8'<br />Flair :Low Effort</li><li>Title: 'What is the deal with patal lok?'<br />Body: "I don't know why scoop whoop and other meme pages are promoting series like this?\nWho is behind the scoop whoop?\nAnd what content is there in patal lok that is offensive to us Hindus(As I never watch such shows)."<br />Author: 'Corvo777'<br />id: 'gnsb47'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'Jo 6ft and 60 ft ki baat karte they, 6 inch dhul nikalne k bad sachchai bahar aa gayi'<br />Body: 'Translation:Those who used to talk about digging 6ft or 60ft, after removal of dirt from 6 inches the truth came out.'<br />Author: 'The_ZMD'<br />id: 'gns7g4'<br />Flair :OC है बे!</li><li>Title: '*Trigger warning* As a Dravidian, I thank Aryans here for being a meat shield for us against Mughals.'<br />Body: "So, when we were living at the Indus valley, I don't know if you guys invaded us or started co living with us, it seems like Dravidians started moving lower and lower and finally settled in today's South India.\n\n(Proof: There's a Dravidian language called Brahui , still present in Pakistan today)\n\nSo when we finally got locked into a land with oceans on three sides and Aryan gene eventually started mixing with Dravidian gene and before the full damage occurs, Mughals came in as karma but I'm thankful to all r/chodi Aryans for being a shield for me.

And China is the new Saudi Arabia." Kai-Fu Lee, entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and former president of Google China\n\nLong before this Pandemic started China has been collecting and analysing the data it collects, legally and otherwise, through all the channels it has available to it.\n\nOne of them is TikTok. Downloaded 1,98,35,170 times just from Google Play only.\n\nTikTok calls itself "not your ordinary destination for short-form mobile video. It\'s raw, real, and without boundaries\u200a-\u200awhether you\'re brushing your teeth at 7:45 a.m. or you\'re making breakfast at 7:45 p.m. It\'s from the gut, \'come as you are\' storytelling told in 15 seconds. With TikTok life\'s more fun when you live in the moment and go beyond to explore."\n\nIt has the short but imperatively weighted phraseology of a typical CCP propaganda piece. But maybe it\'s just a Chinese Patriarchal thing.\n\nTiktok treats the millions of videos it gets everyday like a scrap dealer treats scrap.\n\nLike Gold.\n\n| The Data Stripping Assembly Line\n\nMuch like a scrap recovery plant, TikTok channels the videos through a highly specialised assembly line that passes through both AI and Human scanners at a fairly breathtaking clip where each stage of the data recovery process covers a very well-defined metric. If you find yourself employed in one of these lines, what you will see is a clip flashing before you and all you have to do is press a button that identifies the video as either Indoor or Outdoor. The next video appears as soon as you tap the button. The next person in the line identifies if the video contains an AC or a Car or a Bigscreen TV. Thousands of AI scanners identify further useful data nuggets that are prized by various industries in China.\n\nThere\'s a whole section of the assembly line that identifies all kinds of information about the subject. Male or Female? click. Teenager or Adult? click. Short Hair or Long Hair? Click. Make up or Plain? click. Fair or Dark? click. Wearing Gold or No? Click. Urban or Rural? Click\n\nAnd no, they are not looking at TikTok stars, who number in thousands themselves, new ones replacing old ones every month. They are just the 1% of the world who set the aspirations for the millions of others who post their videos hoping, to one day, strike gold. Unironically.\n\nIt is these millions of others that generate data for TikTok. And it\'s not just the uploaders who are being used. Even if you just downloaded TikTok once to view a link someone sent on Whatsapp you\'ve still given a lot away.\n\nXiaomi has granular information about which districts in India use which brands and which regions pick up the latest phones and which ones lag a version or two behind. Once you know that you can plan your product rollouts in the most productive method.\n\nThe Indian government has put in place policies that protect the payment data of Indians. But if the intention is to secure our wealth then we must go further.\n\nThe stage is right for a local developer to replicate the most addictive aspects of the short-form video app and motivate Indians, through just a better product experience, to keep our data to ourselves.

The necessities of human society are food grains, fruits, milk, minerals, clothing, wood, etc. One requires all these items to fulfill the material needs of the body. Certainly one does not require flesh and fish or iron tools and machinery. During the regime of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, all over the world there were regulated rainfalls. Rainfalls are not in the control of the human being. The heavenly King Indradeva is the controller of rains, and he is the servant of the Lord. When the Lord is obeyed by the king and the people under the king\'s administration, there are regulated rains from the horizon, and these rains are the causes of all varieties of production on the land. Not only do regulated rains help ample production of grains and fruits, but when they combine with astronomical influences there is ample production of valuable stones and pearls. Grains and vegetables can sumptuously feed a man and animals, and a fatty cow delivers enough milk to supply a man sumptuously with vigor and vitality. If there is enough milk, enough grains, enough fruit, enough cotton, enough silk and enough jewels, then why do the people need cinemas, houses of prostitution, slaughterhouses, etc.? What is the need of an artificial luxurious life of cinema, cars, radio, flesh and hotels? Has this civilization produced anything but quarreling individually and nationally? Has this civilization enhanced the cause of equality and fraternity by sending thousands of men into a hellish factory and the war fields at the whims of a particular man?\u2060.."\u2060\n\u2060\nfrom Bhagavat Purana 1.10.4, Bhaktivedanta Purport. https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/10/4'<br />Author: 'soulular_energ2'<br />id: 'glnri3'<br />Flair :Wholesome Bakchodi</li><li>Title: 'Should we?'<br />Body: 'I see many people donating to Opindia.

Together we\'ll get through this.\n\nBut as you read the title, this post is about the new series "Paatal Lok" which is streaming on Amazon Prime.\nDuring the lockdown watching movies and series is how a lot of people entertain themselves. So things like these should be brought to light and shared with as many people as possible.\n\nHere goes.\n\nThis entire series is a blatant piece of Propaganda against Hindus. I don\'t have time right now but hopefully, I\'ll be doing a detailed analysis of the series next week.\n\nPreviously I did a complete analysis of the movie [Kedarnath](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/f1b2mv/how_kedarnath_2018_movie_is_biased_against_hindus/). Which helped some people to see the dark side of bollywood.\n\nBriefly,\nIn the series "Paatal Lok" villains are mostly Hindus.\nA sub inspector (muslim) is shown to be preparing for UPSC who is treated miserably by Hindus in the police station. It\'s shown that there\'s huge prejudice against Muslims in UPSC.\nIt\'s also shown that muslims are framed as terrorists.\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nI request you to please not contribute to Amazon in any way. Try to avoid it as mush as possible.

The biggest Adharma we can do is make ourselves unfit, lazy and complacent. This is why our scriptures say: Aalasyam hi manushyanam sharisya maharipo(Laziness is the biggest enemy of a human). \nI used to smoke cigarettes, eat like a whale, sleep for more than 10 hours and masturbated everyday. Meat was part of my daily diet and used to visit fast food chains every week twice. Used to gulp beer on every instance and had a large beer gut. Exercise was non existent. Body was full of lethargy and pain. Digestion was not clear and used to feel bloated, akward and confused in front of everyone. I used to feel shy, unmotivated and in general, weak, angry and compulsive. \nAfter watching videos after videos on Fitness and Yoga, I never moved even a finger and used to feel dopamine surge just looking at people becoming better but never thought about improving myself.\n\nIt was a dark, spiritless and unmotivated existence.\n\nMotivation came when my Mother told me to realize the duty. \nI started taking tiny steps by changing my diet, sleeping habits and stopping absolute evils like Masturbation, alcohol and fastfood.\n\nPlease Bhratas, its been just couple of months but I already feel much more energetic and happy. Semen Retention works. Please follow it. Dont masturabate. \n\nI have not become a teetotaler or a Vegetarian but limiting them to scarce occassions will help you live life more happily and concentrate on work more. I have not eaten meat or consumed alcohol since last 2 months and I feel no ceaving. I feel I can leave it.\nI have also tried to curb my chain smoking and have reduced from Earlier 4/day to presently 5/week. Its still a lot and I have a long way to go but I know I will persevere.\n\nPlease, As Your Brother, I wish to advise all of you, take good care of your health.

They appear to espouse, defend and protect the left, but they are doing precious little material activity in their own personal life.  They cut their bais wages, they have servants to wash their car.  They maintain their elite status.  They are not egalitarian at all.\n\nIt is easiest to call them out on this.  Next time some leftist does an gyantweet, counter them with what they are doing in practice.\n\nThe other thing is attacking the institutions, not the ideology.  The press council of india needs to be asked why they are not speaking out against the attacks and threats to journalists.  The bar council of india needs to be asked why they are not calling for inquiry into deaths of lawyers.  The medical council of india needs to be asked why they did not condemn the attacks on doctors and nurses.  \n\nThese institutions are in relative obscurity and they do jump in under specific circumstances.  Now when they are called to condemn things that are in fact condemnable, no one can defend them.  It forces these institutions to take positions that they are uncomfortable with.  It allows things to go on record.  It forces discussion.  It results in publicity.\n\nThese are the two techniques to attack the left.

Afghanistan is a Muslim majority country with a strong Persian culture. \n\nMost of the country is either of Iranic or Turkic background. The people themselves feel closer to Iran and Tajikistan, and for some Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The only country to have an indirect relation with India is Pashtuns, and they are far from being dominant culturally in Afghanistan, since it's Persian culture that dominates. \n\nEven besides that Pashtuns are barely the plurality in Afghanistan, and since no census has ever been made because Pashtuns don't want we don't know exactly the ethnic composition. We can just assume that Tajiks, Hazaras and Pashtuns are the most dominant, with a strong Uzbek presence besides smaller ethnic groups like Sayyids, Qizilbash, Kirghizs, Türkmen etc...\n\nAs you can see the country is mostly composed of Central Asian and Middle Eastern ethnic groups, heavily influenced by both those regions. Kids in Afghanistan reads Shahnameh, and heroes like Rostam and Sohrab are highly praised. \n\nThe most talked language is Dari (Persian) the Persian variety of Afghanistan. Besides that, the second most talked is Pashto, and the third most talked is Uzbek. \n\nNow Indians, please, stop including Afghanistan insides Indian cultural sphere it's not logical, Afghans can't even name any Hindu God or can't even put in a map where Delhi is. \n\n[Average looking man from Afghanistan, a Tajik from Panjshir](https://www.flickr.com/photos/anutele/31206394227)"<br />Author: 'Hephtalite'<br />id: 'gk025a'<br />Flair :High IQ</li><li>Title: '[Deleted]'<br />Body: 'Carryminati: YouTube vs TikTok, The End.'<br />Author: 'Meyank_15'<br />id: 'gjxrx4'<br />Flair :Bakchod News</li><li>Title: 'Some users are posting homophobic and transphobic content in this sub.'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'cutestkittylol'<br />id: 'gjw1el'<br />Flair :Rant</li><li>Title: 'Ganga ulti disha beh rahi hai ....'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'gjtesf'<br />Flair :From Twitter</li><li>Title: 'The print?'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'gjsxsy'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'Maar do diya jo tumne Hindu banglaio ko, kal ko agar wo new channel pe aajaye toh ye mat kehna ki Bengali left liberal hote hai.'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'ImaginaryLibrary1'<br />id: 'gjsvl0'<br />Flair :Jihad</li><li>Title: 'A 3 part deep dive on literary ghazis in the garb of historians.

I have decided to build a 2D game( cause I don't have a high-end laptop to make 3D) based on the life of Maharana Pratap Singh. I want to portray him as he was in reality not how our books showed him. It would be a story game. \n\nSee, it would be a 2D game so the graphics won't be that intriguing like the one our mate has build, But I am sure enough you will love the story. My main aim is to educate our new generation by this game about our marvellous past and kings so the game would be free.\n\nI would be thankful if you would help me providing some feasible and original data on the Life of Maharana Pratap as it would help the game look more intense and cool. Also please provide some ideas to be included in the game. Since it would story game, at least 2 months would be required to build it(also I have to prepare for my exams). \n\nRemember, the main thing about this game is its story ,not its graphics, also I am not a good graphic designer :p"<br />Author: 'Dhruv_Colossus'<br />id: 'gj05td'<br />Flair :OC है बे!</li><li>Title: 'Remember!

The Bhitari inscription testifies to the gravity of this invasion, however, Skandagupta rose to the occasion and crushed the Hephtalite/Kidarite Invasions (we can assume that there were at least 4 to 5 as the Hunas most definitely came into contact with the Guptas more than once). The reasons for this success are simple, Skandagupta placed heavy emphasis on Cavalry archery, and this, along with the war elephants and heavy cavalry cataphracts (which formed the core of the Gupta army) made the Guptas a formidable force. The Hephtalites were defeated so decisively that they pestered the Sassanians, but would not bother the Guptas until about 490, when the next Gupta-Hunnic war would occur. R.C. Majumdar called Skandagupta as the "Saviour of India".\n\n**2nd Gupta-Hunnic War:**\n\n***Belligerents:*** *Gupta Empire (Along with it\'s feudatories Malavas, Parvirajakas, etc), Alkhon Hunas (part of the Hephtalite confederation)*\n\n***Commanders and Leaders:***\n\n***Gupta Empire (and it\'s fuedatories):*** *Budhagupta then later Narashimagupta Baladitya, Bhangupta (Governor of Malwa) Prakashadharman of the Malavas*\n\n***Alkhon Hunas:*** *Toramana*\n\n***Result:*** *Huna Victory, Alkhons under Tormana penetrate south all the way up to Malwa, and east as far as Kausambi.*\n\n**Details:**\n\nWhen Skandagupta died, Purugupta and Kumaragupta II succeeded him. These two emperors had unsually short reigns for about 6 and 3 years respectively, so there must have been some sort of civil war or conflict within the empire that forced the Gupta to weaken their attention on the frontiers. Furthermore, the Roman Empire had fell in about 476 AD, and the Gupta enjoyed trade with the Romans. This seems to coincide in the fact that the coins of the monarchs following Skandagupta seem to be of lower quality and quantity. Seeing this, the next wave of Hunas, the Alkhons, then began their campiagn into India. The Alkhons, led by Toramana, broke through the weakened Gupta frontiers and began conquering the western territories of the Gupta all the way up to Eran in Madhya Pradesh, where the First Battle of Eran was fought in 510 . This Battle resulted in a decisive victory of the Alkhons, and Bhanugupta was vanquished. However, he attempted to advance further south, but was finally defeated King Prakashadharma of the Aulikaras, which were a clan of the Malavas. Toramana then decided to campaign eastwards to end the Guptas, while several of his disheartened soilders retreated to the Panjab. Tormana is said to have died in Varanasi while campaigning against Narashima Gupta Baladitya.\n\n**3rd Gupta-Hunnic War:**\n\n***Belligerents:*** \n\n*-Gupta Empire\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0-Alkhon Hephtalites (Hunas)*\n\n*-Aulikaras of Malwa/Rajputana*\n\n*-Parvirajakas*\xa0\n\n\\-*Other ex-feudatories*\n\n***Commanders and leaders:***\n\n*- Yashodharman\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 -Mihirakula*\n\n*-Narashimagupta Baladitya*\n\n*-Maharaja Hastin*\n\n***Result:*** *Coalition led by Yashodharman Victory, Hunas retire back to Central Asia*\n\n**Details:**\n\nFollowing the Second Gupta-Hunnic War, Tormana was finally stopped by the Aulikaras under Prakashadharman, and he continued his campaign eastwards when he died in Varanasi. Mihirakula, his son and successor, continued his campaign eastwards against the Guptas, where he was finally checked by Narashimagupta and repulsed. Xuanzang credits Narashimagupta with capturing Mihirakula through guerilla warfare. This is obviously a fantasy, but Narashimagupta does seem to have checked the Hephtalites in about 520. In Central India, the Aulikaras had risen up against the Alkhons and challenged Mihirakula in the 520s, where they decisevely defeated the Hunas in the Battle of Sodani. This army had also included other ex-feudatories of the Guptas, like the Parvirajakas. Maharaja Hastin, King of the Parvirajakas, is credit with many military victories and most probably took part in the alliance led by Yashodharman. The army of the Gupta, Aulikaras, and other allies, which was led by the great king Yashodharman regained their confidence and began their campaign and reconquer most of the territories once held by the great Guptas. By about 534-540, the Alkhons were pushed back into Central Asia, where they soon lost power.\xa0\n\n**AFTERMATH:** Following their defeat at the hands of the Indian alliance, the Huna presence in India was successfully crushed, although they did survive in Afghanistan as the Turk Shahis. The Hoon clan of Rajputs may also have been the leftover remnants of the Hunas, as many of their survivors retired into the Panjab/Potohari Plateau.\xa0\n\n**SOURCES:**\n\nKailash Chand Jain:\xa0*Malwa Through the Ages*\n\nR.
