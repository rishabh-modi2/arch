He also reminded that court cannot stay a legislation unless the court finds that (1) law is passed without legislative competence (2) law violates fundamental rights (3) law violates other provisions of constitution.\n\n&gt;However, the CJI said he was not interested in discussing Constitutionality of the laws, but was concerned about lack of progress in negotiations at this time. If one reads the transcript of what transpired in court today as live-tweeted by legal site LiveLaw, one cannot escape the conclusion that the SC bench’s overriding concern was how the Court’s role would be perceived by protestors, and how to prevent any blame falling on SC if the protests turn violent.\n\n&gt;CJI also seemed worried with media reports about parties placing onus on courts to decide on the new farm laws. This should be seen in context of the Agriculture Minister’s request to protestors to ‘wait for the court’s decision’, after being repeatedly frustrated by the unions’ intransigence and adamant demand to completely repeal the 3 laws. The CJI also took offence to another newspaper article which reportedly mentioned one political party’s (BJP?) stance that ‘Supreme Court should not decide on the policy of the law’.\n\n&gt;In today’s hearing, the CJI kept going back to his preferred ‘solution’: appoint a ‘neutral’ committee to discuss with farmers and then submit a report to SC, and the laws to be withheld till then. Of course, the choice of committee members suggested in December by CJI like veteran The Hindu journalist and known Modi-baiter like P Sainath really bring into question the judiciary’s understanding of ‘neutrality’.\n\n&gt;When the SG tried to intervene, the CJI remarked, “We don’t know if you are part of the problem or solution.” When the SG told the court that many farmers organizations are telling the government that the laws are progressive and good, the CJI said, “We don’t have any single petition before us saying that the laws are good.”\n\n&gt;The SG reminded the court that just to appease a minority group of vocal protesters, it cannot stall laws which are beneficial to the majority.\n\n&gt;While the CJI was dismissive of the government lawyers, he was very deferential to senior Lutyens’ advocates like Dushyant Dave, Colin Gonsalves, HS Phoolka and Vivek Tankha appearing for protesting farmers groups. Addressing them, the CJI requested them to move protest site once the laws were stayed, stating “We are not against protests. Don’t understand that the Court is stifling protests. But we ask. If after the laws are stayed, will you move the site of protests to accommodate people’s concerns?”\n\n&gt;The threat of violence was clearly uppermost on the CJI’s mind, when he stated, “Each one of us will be responsible if something goes wrong….We don’t want anybody’s blood on our hands.” The court seemed to have forgotten its own ruling after the protracted and illegal Shaheen Bagh sit-in protest culminated with the anti-Hindu Delhi riots, where it said – “public places cannot be allowed for indefinite protests which must take place at designated sites. In a parliamentary democracy, there is an avenue of debate.”\n\n&gt;For that matter, protests are not new in Bharatiya public life – Jat, Maratha and Gurjar protests for  reservation benefits comes to mind in recent times. Some resulted in violence, while others were resolved through negotiations with government or by approaching courts. But no where did one see this kind of blackmail of the entire state machinery, and bypassing the legislative entirely to set up court-appointed Committees to decide on laws.\n\n&gt;When senior advocate PS Narasimha, appearing for an intervenor, argued that there are many other farmers organizations which see the laws as beneficial, and the court did not have their perspective, the CJI said, “Mr.Narasimha, even if your argument is valid, it does not help the situation which is on ground now.”\n\n&gt;Pleas by others like Adv. MP Devnath, appearing for Confederation of All India Traders, who demanded the implementation of laws, or another counsel appearing for Consortium of South India Consumers who also urged courts not to stay implementation of laws, were dismissed by the CJI, stating, “Can you persuade the Punjab farmers who have been protesting for two months? No, right? Let the committee look into it…..We are staying the implementation only to facilitate the talks before the Committee.”\n\n&gt;When the AG remarked whether farmers would show the same adamance and churlishness in front of the Committee that they have displayed in multiple rounds of talks with the government, and questioned the utility of the Committee unless protestors revealed their exact grievances (which they have refused to divulge to the Government), the CJI said, “We trust senior advocates like Prashant Bhushan, Dave, Phoolka, Gonsalves etc will tell the farmers about the real purpose of the Committee. We are not creating an alternative forum.”\n\n&gt;In essence, the CJI is trusting one of the same lawyers (Prashant Bhushan) who the SC itself had found guilty of contempt of court a mere 4 months back!\n\n&gt;CJI then asked for suggestions for a previous CJI to be part of the Committee, to which Dushyant Dave suggested former CJI RM Lodha’s name. Lodha, who was CJI from April to Sept 2014, had clashed with the Modi government during his brief stint over the NDA government’s rejection of UPA-era Solicitor General Gopal Subramanium’s candidature as SC judge. Post retirement he has also been critical of the signature CAA law passed by the Modi government.\n\nhttps://www.hindupost.in/featured/farce-in-supreme-court-over-farm-reforms-shows-how-lutyens-arm-twists-judiciary/'<br />Author: 'BalHanumanJi'<br />id: 'kv8w3s'<br />Flair :National 📰</li><li>Title: 'LOL..

He also wanted a section on the fixing scandal which happened. Now I am just a normal content writer nothing fancy so I started to research things and guess what, I made some really crazy discoveries which I would like to share with ya all.\n\n* Hansie Cronje had 70 offshore bank accounts in the Cayman Islands! (Imagine the extent of fixing which he must have carried out)\n* He **cried while pleading guilty** and named Azhar Babu to be the person who introduced him to the bookies.\n* Cronje freaking dies in an air crash in 2002. The whole case against him closed by the SA authorities.\n* In the CBI inquiry that followed, Azhar was found guilty and thus was banned by the BCCI.\n* Now when Azhar was asked why he was being named by Cronje, here was his answer "**Because I am from a minority community"**\n* Further twist, Hyderabad court in 2012 decides that the ban was \'hastily implemented\' and overturns BCCI\'s decision.\n* Azhar Babu currently the President of the Hyderabad Cricket Association.\n* Azhar also won the 2009 Lok Sabha elections!\n\nAnother interesting point, all the websites all throughout the internet are defending him on the basis of the 2012 judgment but no one has dared to look at that CBI report. I suggested to my client that we write an entire well-written article on that freaking report! And yes he has agreed to that.'<br />Author: 'Meet_Me_In_Heaven'<br />id: 'kv8896'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'हरी तुम हरो जन की भीड़'<br />Body: "I just heard to a meerabai bhajan called Hari Tum Haro Maan ki Bheed\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9v38feFMQc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9v38feFMQc)\n\nIt has lifted my spirits and I can't even describe my emotions.

His view was British rule was necessary to keep Islamic rule out of its way. And the time was not right to fight war against British, that time would come. And after so many years the British rule (and the residual of British rule) the Hindu renaissance is finally happening. Lets just do our part. Read and train your mind, train your body, Earn more.

Else, here is English Translation.\n\n&gt;SATYANANDA Thakur left the battle-field without telling anything to anybody and came to Anandamath. There on the Vishnumandap at dead of night he sat in deep meditation. Just then that doctor made his appearance there. Seeing him Satyananda got up and made his obeisance to him.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The doctor said, “Satyananda, today is Maghi-Purnima.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Satyananda: Let us go, I am ready. But He Mahatman! deign to remove a certain doubt from my mind. At the very moment when I have succeeded in making the Santan dharma safe through war, why do you come and recall me?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He who had come said, “Your work is accomplished, the Mussulman kingdom is destroyed. You have no other work now. Further slaughter of living beings is useless.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Satyananda: The Mussulman Rajya is done away with but no Hindu Rajya has yet been established. The English are strong in Kalikata (Kolkata) now.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He said, “The Hindu Rajya is not destined yet to be established. Your presence here will mean useless loss of human life. So come away with me.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hearing this Satyananda felt acutely distressed. He said, “He Prabhu! If the Hindu Rajya is not established, then who will rule here? Will the Mussulman again get the upper hand?”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He said, “No, the English will rule India now.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Tears flowed from both of Satyananda’s eyes. Turning towards the pratima of Matrirupa Janmabhumi, he began saying in tear-choked voice with joined plams, “Hai Ma! I have failed to rescue you, you will again fall into the clutches of the Mlechhas. Do condone the failing of your Santan. Why did I not die in the battle-field today?”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The doctor said, “Satyananda, don’t be broken-hearted. Due to your error of judgment you gathered money through robbery and thus won the war. Out of sin does not come pure achievement. So you will necessarily fail to rescue your country. Moreover, whatever will happen will be for the best. Unless the English rule this land, there is no chance of the renaissance of the Sanatan dharma. Listen patiently. I shall explain to you as it has been seen and understood by the Mahapurushes. *The worship of Thirty Three Koti Devatas is not the Sanatan dharma; that is a Loukik Apakrishta Dharma. Under its influence, the true Sanatan Dharma, as the Mlechhas call it Hindu dharma, is lost. The true Hindu dharma is Knowledge(Gnyan) based, not Karma based. That Gnyan is of two kinds: — secular or external and spiritual or internal. The inner spiritual knowledge is the chief part of real dharma. But unless secular knowledge about the outside world comes, the other knowledge about the inner world cannot grow. Unless one knows what the Sthula, one cannot arrive at the Sukshma. For a long time this Sthula knowledge has been lost in this country — so the true Sanatan dharma is also lost. In order to restore the Sanatan dharma, at the outset knowledge of the material world must be preached. There is not much material knowledge in the country now, there is none capable of teaching it. We are not adepts in spreading popular education. So the necessary knowledge has got to be brought and introduced from other countries. The English are past masters in the knowledge pertaining to the material world. They are adepts in the art of teaching. So we shall make the British our rulers. Through English education our people attaining knowledge of the material world will also be made capable of understanding inner knowledge. There will then be no obstacle against preaching the true eternal dharma. True dharma will, under the circumstances, grow spontaneously. So long as that does not happen, so long as the Hindus do not become wise, worthy and strong, British rule will endure. The subjects will be happy under the British control. They will pursue their religious life without hindrance. So, wise one! Desist from fighting the British and follow me.”*'<br />Author: 'Straight_Razor007'<br />id: 'kv2uza'<br />Flair :Viraat Sanatani🚩</li><li>Title: 'Worst is about to come !!!'<br />Body: "Biden's government would want China to arm Pakistan to launch an invasion force into India.

The government has already connected 100 percent of villages and cities through roads and provided a decent public transport along with metros. By increasing petrol prices, we can force other people to use more and more public transport. The introduction of BS6 engines has increased the cost of vehicles and private ownership will decrease which would significantly reduce carbon monoxide levels. I wish modi could increase the petrol prices by atleast Rs.500 per litre (only for private vehicles) and within a year, we could be like Netherlands where people would start preferring cycles/public transportation. By the end of 2030, only electric vehicles should be allowed imo and people should pay pollution tax for owning a vehicle. This will help us fighting climate change for the long run.

How much time do you give for physical exercise. \n\nTomorrow is 12th january, Swami Vivekananda\'s birth day, National Youth Day. As he said in VEDANTA IN ITS APPLICATION TO INDIAN LIFE: হে আমার যুবক বন্ধুগণ, তোমরা সবল হও - তোমাদের নিকট ইহাই আমার বক্তব্য । গীতাপাঠ অপেক্ষা ফুটবল খেলিলে তোমরা স্বর্গের আরও নিকটবতী হইবে। আমাকে অতি সাহসপূর্বক এই কথাগুলি বলিতে হইতেছে। কিন্তু না বলিলেই নয়। আমি তোমাদিগকে ভালবাসি। আমি জানি, সমস্যা কি - কাঁটা কোথায় বিঁধিতেছে! আমার কিছু অভিজ্ঞতা আছে। তোমাদের বলি, তোমাদের শরীর একটু শক্ত হইলে তোমরা গীতা আরো ভালো বুঝিবে। তোমাদের রক্ত একটু তাজা হইলে তোমরা শ্রীকৃষ্ণের মহতী প্রতিভা ও মহান বীর্য ভালো করিয়া বুঝিতে পারিবে। যখন তোমাদের শরীর তোমাদের পায়ের উপর দৃঢ়ভাবে  দন্ডায়মান হইবে, যখন তোমরা নিজেদের মানুষ বলিয়া অনুভব করিবে, তখনই তোমরা উপনিষদ ও আত্মার মহিমা আরো ভালো করিয়া বুঝিবে। (Be strong, my young friends; that is my advice to you. You will be nearer to Heaven through playing football than through the study of the Gita. These are bold words; but I have to say them, for I love you. I know where the shoe pinches. I have gained a little experience. You will understand the Gita better with your biceps, your muscles, a little stronger. You will understand the mighty genius and the mighty strength of Krishna better with a little of strong blood in you. You will understand the Upanishads better and the glory of the Atman when your body stands firm upon your feet, and you feel yourselves as men. Thus we have to apply these to our needs.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo it is great if you are going to the gym/sports/yog-byam. If not, Start today by doing some stretching, five dand (pushups) and ten Baithak (squats). I don\'t care if you are a male or female, exercise is important for everybody.  Take the pledge and start acting from today itself, so that Tomorrow, National Youth Day starts with a new mission. Viraat bano. Sharir se aur man se.

India is a very collectivist society. We are huge on maintaining the status quo, there is a strong focus on respecting the elders , obeying them and so on. This naturally means as a society we don\'t create a conducive environment for anything that challenges the status quo to take root. \n\n&gt;2.) Educational institutions and the campus culture in India. You\'d be surprised to learn that most institutions of higher learning in india are just an extension of school life. There\'s no culture of part time work , kids are dependent on their parents well until they graduate and get a job. 90% of colleges in my city have extremely regressive policies like no participation in political activites. (I had to sign a declaration that I will not engage in political activism while in university) , no free mixing of the sexes, strict curfew in hostels ( women had to be back in their hostels before 8 p.m in my college). There is an enormous focus on academics and every other activity takes a back seat.\n\n&gt;3.) The social cost of being an exmuslim. You will always be a Muslim to the Hindus and Christians , you will never be Muslim enough for the muslims. Religion is an Identity in India, it\'s something you inherit from your parents. No matter how much you want to say you are not a Muslim , you are one riot away from running to the arms of muslims for safety. I\'ve faced this myself - at the end of the day this is the only community I have, and in a collectivist society where people ask your family name and caste before asking your name - you can\'t give up your identity so easily. I still have to hide my apostasy from everyone because it will affect even my brother\'s life if I were to bring "dishonor" to my family through my actions , so I stay in the shadows and it\'s not like I\'m gonna face any issues for being an openly non-practising muslim or a cultural muslim so most people just choose the easy way out and stay cultural muslims. We drink, we fuck , get into all sorts of haraam activities and we maintain our identity as muslims. \n\n\n\n3rd point is important. While an Ex Hindu or an Ex Christian literally shits on his people. In America, SJWs shit on Whites like hell. Idhar ki Ex Hindu sub ko dekhoge toh exactly edgy atheist subs ke tarah lagega. It is expected. They left their religions. They will be critical. \n\nThen come the hypocritical Ex Muslims of India. They openly say that they will never leave their community. These Ex Muslims often say that they are considered Muslims by Non Muslims even though they are Apostates but prove us right just in the next line when they say that they run back to the Muslim community. These guys would even side outright with Al Qaeda and give the same reason. Ex Muslims won\'t condemn Islamic attacks and supremacism because they VOLUNTARILY ALLY WITH THE MUSLIMS.'<br />Author: 'gaybabe5789'<br />id: 'kui42x'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihaad_Halal Certified</li><li>Title: 'Wake up Bakchods.'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Vishnu_Avatar2020'<br />id: 'kuhdlb'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm 🕉️</li><li>Title: 'Gibberish: All आह Who एक बार'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'kugpaw'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: 'Alhamdulillah!!!!!!!!!'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'naaah_man'<br />id: 'kufhqw'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihaad_Halal Certified</li><li>Title: "Upar se neeche poora padhe, Don't click on spoiler part before reading all"<br />Body: 'P - A person who has a profession or a job which require high intellectual ability and high level of knowledge like in science, research and technology eg.

Now under the governance of the saffron party, India is facing a similar situation. And citizens of our country are completely numb about it, the main problem of people in India is they forget what happened in the past and form their opinions on the present situation. Some politicians are found talking stupid things on national television and they are not even firm on their own points, you can watch it here https://youtu.be/F2zEH7VrKVs.\n    \n    The saffron party is trying to manipulate us by using the media. I don\'t support any political party, manipulation through media was even their during the time of congress,\nbut it was not much. Now sometimes I feel that the Indian media is only working for the saffron party. And if any journalist tries to criticize them on national television they end up like Punya Prasun Bajpai. You can see the case of Punya Prasun Bajpai here https://youtu.be/wfF5Q17lYy4 . Owning multiple news channels gives you the power to form public  opinion and reliance group owns 72 channels which reach out to more than 800 million Indians. Reliance group is owned by Mukesh Ambani and we all know how close he is with our honorable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.\n   \n   Lets leave manipulation  on  national television aside and look towards our social  media. Well our social media is too not that clean. Operation \'karaoke\' conducted by Cobra Post says it all. It was a sting operation in which some journalist went to interview some popular celebrities, after interview they faked going off air but still kept their camera and microphones on. They asked them a question about whether they are paid for their posts on social media. And to the journalist\'s astonisment most of them said that the saffron party pays them above 1 crore for their every tweet they made in favor of the saffron party. To your surprise, the celebrities who agreed that they were paid are Krishna Abhishek, Raju Srivastav, Sonu Sood ,Vivek Oberoy, Jackie Shroff , Mika Singh and 40  more. This operation was so huge that the news channels should have been filled with it but no one even knew that such operation was conducted. You can learn more about  operation karaoke here https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtIitJsHQm64G-lHSe4tuutWWJe7XQfAs .\n\n    While talking about social media how can we forget about the BJP IT cell, if you criticize the saffron party on social media, then get ready to be trolled. There are in total 20,000 members and theres a meeting held every month of the top 150 members of the BJP IT cell. Guess what this meeting is attended by our honorable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the pictures about the meeting is openly available on the top 150 member\'s Instagram and twitter account and our Prime Minister follows them too. You can get more information about it from Quint\'s article https://www.thequint.com/tech-and-auto/tech-news/twitter-trolls-among-super150-invited-by-pm-modi\n\n   We all love watching movies but what if I tell you that Bollywood is manipulating you to form a political opinion in favor of the saffron party. From quit some time movies are made about political figure, one of these movies was Indu sarkar. The movie talks about Indira Gandhi and her evil side during emergency. "What we see, is what we believe", 70% of the movie was based on fiction and it was not mentioned anywhere in the movie. Less than 1% of the audience knew this fact.\n  \n   Young Minds are the most easy targets to manipulate and these Young Minds are the vote banks of the future . Political manipulation has not even spared our education system. A kid\'s world is small it\'s all about going to school, play with friends, etc. They feel everything printed in their textbooks is true but is it? Let\'s look at case in Rajasthan,  during rule of the saffron party in the state. There were some changes in the textbooks, before it was  क for कौआ but it was then changed to क for कमल and the image used for कमल was exactly similar to the saffron party\'s emblem. There was one more change in its history books which showed image of freedom fighters of Congress during the time of British in bad light and from textbooks of standard first to standard tenth it was not mentioned anywhere that Mahatma Gandhi was murdered by Naturam Godse and Naturam Godse was a part of the RSS. Lets not go so far in Rajasthan and look at our NCERT textbooks, demonetisation which was a huge economic failure which disturbed India\'s economic growth, it was glorified in the NCERT textbooks. There was poem in its English book on lotus that said victory of lotus is victory of Indian culture. You can get more information about it herehttps://youtu.be/48OyyhpIGZk\n\n   Why is the saffron party doing it? Why are they manipulating us through education system, Bollywood, social media and our Television. It is because if their public image is not getting better, at least it should not be bad. What can we do about it? The only thing we can do is to not believe anything around us and remember everything around us is fake.'<br />Author: 'Fine_Principle_7755'<br />id: 'ksxjh9'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Tips to battle Hinduphobia'<br />Body: "Some tips to battle Hinduphobia:\n\n1. Stop being apologetic: I've never seen a religion more apologetic than Hindus. Even after being victims for thousands years, they are apologetic for everything under the sun. In the temple outside my house, there was Bhandara almost every month but yet Hindus feel apologetic for Bhandaras at Gurudwaras. And if someone asks why so much milk is 'wasted' in temples, ask the person how dared the person plan a trip to Paris/Australia or had his destination wedding at Timbaktu when so many countrymen were starving. Hindus are apologetic to Northeastern Christians if they raised a ruckus on supposed discrimination in mainland but are completely silent when they threaten and physically assault not only Biharis and Bengalis but also other north eastern Hindu or non-Christian tribals.\n\n.\n\n2. Take care of your words: Hindus are worst examples of subconscious conditioning. Since childhood, through movies and casual remarks, it is being fed into our minds that Punjabi and Pathan boys and girls are more beautiful and 'fair' which results in our boys changing their religion to marry the girl from other community and our girls simping over Fawad Khan and Turkish soaps.\n.\n\n3. Be aware: If you are aware, no one will be able to guilt trip you over so-called Brahminical patriarchy or Manusmriti for so called oppression of dalits, you can point out how the provisions of Indian Constitution and government are highly favorable towards these castes while in Pakistan, still the position for cleaning washrooms is only for Hindu Dalits.\n.\n4. And if any foreigner tries to guilt trip you, remind them about massacres of aboriginal people who were the rightful owners of the land they've built their houses on."<br />Author: 'dreamerimagine1'<br />id: 'ksx0eh'<br />Flair :Magga Balti Vichar :Shwr:</li><li>Title: 'Tips to battle Hinduphobia'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'dreamerimagine1'<br />id: 'kswyjd'<br />Flair :Magga Balti Vichar :Shwr:</li><li>Title: 'If Ambedkar and Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj belonged to same "caste", why was one untouchable and other a king ?'<br />Body: 'English word "caste" came from portuguese word, casto, which means class in english.   \n\n\nDifferent classes in school, post office, railway station, govt offices, etc are still used today.  \n\n\nBoth Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Bhimrao Ambedkar belonged to Mahar "caste", Maharashtra state is named after Mahars.  \n\n\nSo why did lineage of kings and rulers suddenly turned into shit cleaners (after 1857) ? Why are most prostitutes in South mumbai and sonagachi areas still belong to mahar caste ?  \n\n\nHow did bhimrao ambedkar support the british in World war 2 ?\n\n  \nHow did his father, Ramji Maloji Sakpal support the british in World war 1 ?   \n\n\nHow did his grandfather, Maloji Sakpal support the british in 1857 ?  \n\n\nWhat decisions did his family took for mahar community which made them \'untouchables\' ?  \n\n\nAmbedkar\'s father held the rank of subedar, similar to collector today. Ask yourself, is it possible today that son of a collector is discriminated in school and made to sit separately ?  \n\n\nIf mahars were not allowed to study, how did bhimrao get his school admission ? if they were, did the children of mahar kings faced similar discrimination ?   \n\n\nbhimrao was admitted in Elphinstone High School, bombay (est   \n1822) and Elphinstone College (est. 1834). these schools were started by the british for white children and to train brown civil servants. He had no problem getting admission here.   \n\n\nInterestingly, this school was started by Mountstuart Elphinstone, governer of bombay, who acted as a broker with peshwas and Marathas. (due to which Maratha kingdom went from Emperor Shahu (son of Shivaji) to Peshwas and then to mughals).  \n\n\nHe then went to columbia uni, USA where he was influenced by John Dewey, who converted the english word, depressed to dalit.   \n\n\nAmbedkar\'s father helped recruit most of the mahar soilders during WW1, and ambedkar himself recruited them in WW2.   \n\n\nThere was no caste / jaati system before british came to Aryavart, no surnames (related to occupation).

(Book review)"<br />Body: "India’s Secularism penned down by Sita Ram Goel further translated in English by Yashpal Sharma. \n\r\nTo preach Secularism to this Hindu society, was like showing a lamp to the Sun. ~ Sita Ram Goel. \n\r\nCan there be a religion without spirituality? \n\r\nThese words Secularism, Socialism, non-alignment etc etc sounds beautiful, But we all know what the garbs of secularism has done to India. \r\n\r\nThe title of the book is aptly chosen,  “India’s Secularism” not “Indian Secularism” because there is nothing Indian about Nehruvian Secularism. \r\n\r\nIn the chapter named “What is Dharma”, The author has talked about What Dharma is, Types of Worships and has deeply discussed the propositions of Advaita and Monotheism. \r\nIt gave us an understanding that both are different to each other and they aren't even comparable. Differences arise when different individuals espouse the opposite traditions of Advaita and Monotheism intellectually and cherish them consciously. Then the tradition of Monotheism gives birth to Aurangzeb and the tradition of Advaita to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.\r\n\r\nThe author has discussed how secularism, Rise and developed in Europe. And how India is different from Europe, India where there is no sign of bloodshed of dharma before Mughals invasions. And Europe where Jews whom the Church had stigmatized as the “Killed of Christ” and deprived of all citizenship rights. Also he talked about the challenge of Islam and Hindu Response in differnt phases. First phase - Mahmud Ghaznavi, Second - Mahmud Ghauri, Third - Akbar and the Fourth - after partition. Talking about “The Basic Blunder” to recognize Islam as a dharma. (ofc it’s a religion). And also talked about how thinkers (Such as Adi Shankaracharya) of Arab invasion periods have not talked about the invasion. All these thinkers could not entertain any proposition beyond  ब्रह्म सत्य है, जगत मिथ्या (Brahma alone is Real, the world is an illusion). Perhaps evil conduct in this unreal world was no more than an illusion for them. Perhaps they could see no reason for discussing an illusion.\r\n \r\nFurther has also talked about Treatment of these Diseases. That we have to go back to the ideals and goals laid by our leader during the Swadeshi movement. In order to emerge as the leading nation and as an exemplary example to the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nA new meaning of Secularism began to be fortified - Secularism, that is, applause for Islam and Christianity. And Hindu society began to be denounced as a nest of narrow-minded and aggressive communalism. All political parties also began to swear by this Secularism.\r\n\r\nSita Ram Goel criticized Hindus as we failed to re-establish the dharmic way of life. \r\nAnd he was also criticized, other religions after a deep understanding of their scriptures. Though this book is written against the backdrop of the political developments in India parallels can be drawn when one sees the goings on in Europe. Even though this book was written almost 35 years ago its relevance has certainly not diminished. \r\nReligion has to suffer due to Religious fanatics of conflicting religions leading it to systematic disintegration. Someone then has to speak up. \r\nThank You, Sita Ram Goel Ji. \r\nJai Shree Ram."<br />Author: 'runawayharish'<br />id: 'ksveth'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: "The guy raising the Indian flag yesterday in the Trump protest was a Mallu Christian from the 'liberal model state' of Kerala."<br />Body: "Find the post here that confirms who raised the Indian Flag\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/vijnad18/posts/10225110958905593](https://www.facebook.com/vijnad18/posts/10225110958905593)\n\nHis Facebook Profiles :\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/VinsonXPalathingal](https://www.facebook.com/VinsonXPalathingal)\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/vinson.palathingal](https://www.facebook.com/vinson.palathingal)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis guy is a staunch Mallu Christian.

An incident happened in my village during jat arakshan protests, as you know that to counter that protest there were protests by reserved category people, all is fine , this happens everytime, but the problem started when thes reserved category people in the name of protest started hitting/throwing slippers/shoes on idol of lord hanuman to hurt sentiments of jats. If the protesters were from a different religion, it would still have made sense but being from the same religion and hitting your own god just to hurt your own people doesn’t make sense. I thought people can’t be that stupid until I met my secular classmates in college, the most anti-Hindu people I’ve ever seen , by anti Hindu i mean anti-uppercaste. The people you see on r India are nothing in front of them, they are the kind of people who will give you a billion reasons why Ram mandir is a bad idea or why we need congress back or why the people on top are all brahmins. Why am I writing this today? Because yesterday while I was talking to my so called “**secular** **unreserved** friend” (who actually supports reservation) his tongue slipped and he told me he actually belonged to SC/ST category and turned Out most of them were when i asked him. There will be some of you who would ask how his tongue slipped , was talking about ssc-cgl and I said “fees zyada hogi” and he replied “hamare liye to free hai aur vaise 100 hai”. I feel betrayed that I had friends who tried to look secular but couldn’t help themselves when it was time to disrespect Hinduism, these guys were happy when the sadhus were lynched.  Lied about their category for 3 fucking years , avid Muslim supporters ,anti-CAA supporters ,  in short real life pro secularism guys Who are only secular at times. I don’t think people like them would ever support Hindus if they were being lynched right in front of them. But they always forget that Muslims are not their brothers, if the 30% unreserved minority is lost (hypotheticall)  they won’t stay alive for a single decade here in India. Please don’t say not all of them are like that , yes I know but most of them are , only one guy in my class who belongs to category is extremely pro Hindu, so much so that sometimes I feel secular in front of him. But that’s just one guy. Sorry for the rant, I feel angry. I thought I had friends who would have my back but I don’t feel so anymore.

But here\'s the mind blowing part, the word \'rape\' isn\'t even a Indian word it\'s a English word imported in India by British and propagated by leftists. In fact no Indic languages originally have words for rape, leftists were successful in injecting some made up words for rape in indic languages but even a child can tell they sound so different from normal words and aren\'t original.\n\nNow you would understand why Indian society doesn\'t talk about rape because it\'s a totally foreign concept, the society home to thousands of great men, vast wishdom, knowledge, peace and love can\'t even imagine a thing as bad as rape. No person following indic religion can even think about rape.\n\nFurthermore there isn\'t a single written evidence of rape in ancient India, the mughals and other foreigners of course did mass rapes of Hindu women. Hindus were totally stunned by those horrible acts, they didn\'t know how to respond to such a terrible acts, so as a result they started child marriage ([source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage_in_India#:~:text=Child%20marriage%20in%20India%2C%20according,in%20poor%20socio-economic%20conditions.&amp;text=Child%20marriage%20was%20outlawed%20in%201929%2C%20under%20Indian%20law.)). \n\nBritish took advantage of this and framed Hindus as pedophiles and rapists, even today the people who say India has rape capital are mughal and Britain sympathizers.

Heres mine'<br />Body: "It happened when I was a wee young lad, bounding up the twelfth class. I remember it clearly to this day.\n\nThe city I used to live at was somewhat weird in its planning. Well which city isnt in India barring a few exceptions. So for the tuition classes I used to go to the other part of city and there was a bridge which joined both parts. \n\nThe bridge was an important construction as it was the only thing which joined both the parts of the city. And weirdly even after being in the smack middle of the city there was no human settlement near one kilometre vicinity of the bridge, on either side. \n\nAnd it wasnt devoid of a reason. Its an ancient city and since time immemorial, the bridge or the area near it was known to be haunted. \n\nI never paid any heed to such old wives tales. Until that fateful night. \n\nI had planned to stay back on the other side of the bridge at a friend's place as early in the morning next day, we had a test at the tuitions at 6.00 am. Bring the winter season it was a lot of trouble crossing the town on my moped, teeth chattering all the while to reach the tuitions. \n\nBut as my misfortune would have it, someone from my friends family was critical following a major accident. So the family had to leave urgently, my friends protest to stay back fell on deaf ears and I was in a precarious position. \n\nBut not wanting to be a point of bother for the family I decided myself to get back to my home. \n\nMust have been around 12.30 pm I bade farewell to the family and self started the moped. I tucked myself well with the jerkin, pulled its hoodie above my head and tied it. \n\nIt was especially foggy that night. As I crossed the slumbering city, I found myself the only dweller on the roads. The air was icy cold. \n\nAs I neared the bridge I thought to myself look at this bridge looking so innocent and harmless, people just get spooked cause of the  deserted place, thats all.\n\nJust as I finished this thought I felt a significant drop in power of the moped, its engine started sputtering. I was already on the bridge by now, no matter how much throttle I gave her, she gave feeble signs of life and died exactly at the middle of the bridge. \n\nI tried the self, I tried the kickstarter, nothing worked. Before the engine had stalled I had managed to get it near the wall of the bridge, to avoid collision in case of incoming traffic. Because the fog had really thickened up by now.  The golden light of the streetlights were the only sign that there were street lights. \n\nThe place was eerie, with the halos of light formed around the street lights and no sound from any direction. It was weird for an open space to be this silent, I thought. \n\nJust as I moved towards the wall of the bridge to see if there was water flowing below, because I couldn't hear anything, I heard a  whisper, inside my left ear. It was just a sound, as if someone had exhaled near my ear. \n\nWhat bothered me was that both of my ears were well covered. I had made sure no wind could pass in. I looked sound warily, there was nothing, nobody. \n\nFor a moment I thought of making a break for it. It was impractical, I wasnt thinking straight. My home was long way from there and the cold was biting. I took a deep breath, grabbed the handles of the moped and started dragging it. There was a slope just where the bridge ended which I thought could jump start the engine. \n\nAs soon as I started walking away from the spot, I felt as if mutiple cold needles were piercing my body. I had never experienced anything like this, it was almost too painful to bear. I felt I was burning up, by cold. I took every ounce of energy I had and didnt stop. I kept pulling the moped. It wasnt getting better,  I felt as if I was getting pierced more and more as I went further.\n\nAs soon as I reached the end of the bridge I jumped on the moped gave it a mighty push with everything I had. The moment I left the bridge, the sensation stopped. But the remember trying to self start the moped like a madman, somehow it started on the first try. \n\nI zoomed so fast till home that I didnt even realise I was at the front gate. Once inside I pulled up my shirt and saw multiple small red indurations on my skin. For once I thought I may have got chickenpox. But it wasn't. \n\nI didnt tell anyone about it. And to this day you can always hear water flowing when you stand near the walls of the bridge.\n\nBut that night, that night was different."<br />Author: 'chayenchabilo'<br />id: 'krwelr'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Help!

You get the answer when you try to dwell into the origins of secularism as a trait of a governance system. The history of Secular govt. goes back to Europe in the late medieval period, not because the European people loved welcoming other religions to their country but because their governments and kings didn\'t like the Church\'s rising influence in governance and hence govts. and kings all over western Europe introduced systems and laws in their country to seperate all kinds of religious organizations, values and influence from seats of power and governmental decision-making, because obviously,tell me would you like it if you were a 16th century nobleman who worked for the king but an old-baldy from the church could bypass all your decisions? In case you\'d like to explore the history,you can do some more reading here in this really excellent journal- [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40972199?seq=1](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40972199?seq=1)\n\nIn contrast to that,there was no church in India, and even if there is one now,they haven\'t ever really been much strong enough to influence any kind of politics and no similar organizations exist as well whereas most Hindu seats of authority (the different *maths*) have largely always remained apolitical and hence the secularist trait is rendered useless when it comes to India. \n\nThere\'s a reason why Ambedkar didn\'t add the term "Secular" into the original constitution and we were not a secular nation upto \'74 when Indira Gandhi used her authority during the emergency and added the terms "socialist" and "secular" unilaterally, it is suspected that she did that under the influence of the KGB as the Mitrokhin archives reveal because the soviets wanted a place in the Indian govt. and Congress in return for helping India win the \'71 war, I\'ve already done a very detailed post on how the Congress technically sold the whole country to the Soviets and KGB, not going into more detail on it-[https://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/krkmzq/the\\_legacy\\_of\\_bose\\_and\\_how\\_the\\_nehruand\\_congress/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/krkmzq/the_legacy_of_bose_and_how_the_nehruand_congress/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  \n \n\n*There\'s a reason why Ambedkar didn\'t add the term "Secular" into the original constitution* Coming back to my previous point,yes you heard that right, the father of the constitution didn\'t want us to be secular, and he was not bigoted,you want to know why he thought so? Because he suspected a future islamization of the country could happen if we adopted a secular nation\'s traits (which he foresaw and his words aged well), the same case is being seen with many parts of Europe, which didn\'t forsee the evil of Secularism and how it could be twisted and used by Islamic radicals, if you don\'t believe me,maybe you\'ll believe Ambedkar\'s own words from some of the constitutional assembly debates when they were making the decision whether the country should be "secular" or not, here are some extracts of what he said-\n\n\\- Dr Ambedkar says:\n\n“*There can thus be no manner of doubt that the Muslim Society in India is afflicted by the same social evils as afflict the Hindu Society. Indeed, the Muslims have all the social evils of the Hindus and something more. That something more is the compulsory system of purdah for Muslim women.*”\n\n\\- Dr Ambedkar says:\n\n“*The existence of these evils among the Muslims is distressing enough. But far more distressing is the fact that there is no organized movement of social reform among the Musalmans of India on a scale sufficient to bring about their eradication. The Hindus have their social evils. But there is this relieving feature about them—namely, that some of them are conscious of their existence and a few of them are actively agitating for their removal. The Muslims, on the other hand, do not realize that they are evils and consequently do not agitate for their removal. Indeed, they oppose any change in their existing practices.*”\n\n\\- Dr Ambedkar says.\n\n“*The third thing that is noticeable is the adoption by the Muslims of the gangster’s method in politics. The riots are a sufficient indication that gangsterism has become a settled part of their strategy in politics. …. So long as the Muslims were the aggressors, the Hindus were passive, and in the conflict, they suffered more than the Muslims did. But this is no longer true. The Hindus have learned to retaliate and no longer feel any compunction in knifing a Musalman. This spirit of retaliation bids fair to produce the ugly spectacle of gangsterism against gangsterism*.”\n\n\\- Dr Ambedkar says:\n\n“T*he second thing that is noticeable among the Muslims is the spirit of exploiting the weaknesses of the Hindus. If the Hindus object to anything, the Muslim policy seems to be to insist upon it and give it up only when the Hindus show themselves ready to offer a price for it by giving the Muslims some other concessions. Another illustration of this spirit of exploitation is furnished by the Muslim insistence upon cow-slaughter and the* *stoppage of music before mosques. Islamic law does not insist upon the slaughter of the cow for sacrificial purposes and no Musalman, when he goes to Haj, sacrifices the cow in Mecca or Medina. But in India, they will not be content with the sacrifice of any other animal.*”\n\n\\- **But at least Islam teaches universal brotherhood, right?**\n\nWrong! Dr Ambedkar has this to say\n\n“*The brotherhood of Islam is not the universal brotherhood of man. It is brotherhood of Muslims for Muslims only. There is a fraternity, but its benefit is confined to those within that corporation.*”\n\n**But what about the “idea of India?” Is it right to question the patriotism of Indian Muslims?**\n\nLet’s find out what Baba Saheb has to say\n\n“*The second defect of Islam is that it is a system of social self-government and is incompatible with local self-government, because the allegiance of a Muslim does not rest on his domicile in the country which is his but on the faith to which he belongs. …. Wherever there is the rule of Islam, there is his own country. In other words, Islam can never allow a true Muslim to adopt India as his motherland and regard a Hindu as his kith and kin.*”\n\n*There goes an ouch from The Wire and Quint*\n\n**How do the Muslims of India see the Hindus? Do they see Hindus as equals and treat them with respect as per Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb?**\n\nDr Ambedkar says:\n\n“*The realist must take note of the fact that the Musalmans look upon the Hindus as Kaffirs, who deserves more to be exterminated than protected. The realist must take note of the fact that while the Musalman accepts the European as his superior, he looks upon the Hindu as his inferior.*”\n\n“*If the representative government can help the Muslims, they will demand it, and fight for it. … The dominating consideration with the Muslims is not democracy. The dominating consideration is how democracy with majority rule will affect the Muslims in their struggle against the Hindus. Will it strengthen them or will it weaken them? If democracy weakens them, they will not have democracy*.”\n\n**But don’t the vast majority of Muslims condemn all acts of violence? Isn’t Islam a religion of peace?**\n\nYou could listen to NDTV. Or you could listen to Dr Ambedkar:\n\n“*whether the number of prominent Hindus killed by fanatic Muslims is large or small matters little. What matters is the attitude of those who count, towards these murderers. The murderers paid the penalty of law where the law is enforced. The leading Moslems, however, never condemned these criminals. On the contrary, they were hailed as religious martyrs and agitation was carried on for clemency being shown to them.* ”\n\nGo ahead, read Baba Saheb\'s **PAKISTAN OR THE PARTITION OF INDIA** and you\'ll find how much the man leftists, islamists and liberals champion so much today, the very Father of the Indian Constitution would\'ve laughed these jokers off in a debate about secularism and opression os Islam as a minority today ([http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar\\_partition/](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/))\n\nAnyway, if we don\'t have a society suitable for being secular, the father of our constitution didn\'t want such a trait for our democracy (because he foresaw Islam as a future evil that it is today, and he was way ahead of his time on this one because no one in the west was focusing on this then) and he also very well knew how a secular society would mean a doomsday for Hindus (No he wasn\'t an anti-Hindu like they claim so, in fact he compiled the Hindu code of conduct and Laws very passionately himself and seeked to reform Hindu society for the better), and after all of that,what makes you think that the principle is good for us?We might not feel threatened right now but as per the classic Game Theory model ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game\\_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)) we\'re already losing this infinitely long civilizational war, and we\'re not far away, most research papers and social scientists agree that once the Islamic population in a country reaches 16% nobody can stop the country from getting Islamized in the next 100-150 years (backed by Harvard and Pew peer-reviewed papers published in reputed social science journals- [https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4481625/Norris\\_MuslimIntegration.pdf](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4481625/Norris_MuslimIntegration.pdf) , [https://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/the-future-of-the-global-muslim-population/](https://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/the-future-of-the-global-muslim-population/) , Note-if that link doesn\'t work on your IP by any chance, PM me your email for a PDF copy if you want to read the whole paper)\n\n So to recap it for you- We\'re not a suitable civilization for being Secular, we\'re threatened by the Islamic community (radically,not just demographically,although they did increase from 13% to 20% in 10 years,and that\'s hugely bad for us,just waiting for the 2021 census) and the Father of our constitution didn\'t want us to be one, since Ambedkar believed that Muslim society has more ills than Hindu society, that Muslims are more resistant to positive change, that Muslims believe neither in democracy, nor in treating Hindus as equals, nor do Muslims condemn crimes against Hindus. That Muslims can never owe allegiance to India.\n\nSuffice to say, Baba Saheb would certainly have lost the elections for the post of JNUSU President to "Dr." Kanhaiya Kumar.\n\nSo my question to you dear liberal friend being, one,if we weren\'t originally secular when we got independence and two, when we got our first constitution two years later,three, the principle was forced into our throats by a neo-dictatorial regime (because that\'s what the emergency basically was) and even most of the fathers of Modern India (including Ambedkar and Patel) believed that secularism wasn\'t a suitable principle for us to blindly follow as a civilization, then mate,what makes you think it is good for us into a long run? The way I see it, if it keeps being misused and twisted by people like this, we\'ll for sure one day end up in a communal civil war with multiple sides fighting for themselves, and that would be a true doomsday for us as a country.\n\nI think I need not say furthermore why secularism is not a principle suitable for India as a civilization in the long run mate.\n\nWith this I rest my case.'<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'kruh6p'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Let me get this straight.'<br />Body: 'Countries that approved their vaccines before India:\nUSA, China, Russia, UK.

The Gau-Mutar jibes, earlier used for just Bhakts are used for Hindus as whole now. Instead of arguing with them rationally, people resorted to mocking them and labelling them as anti-nationals. You people just see the Pizza, foot massager whereas you should question the government as the new bill does have loopholes. \nInstead of questioning the government about the laws, you guys started mocking the whole movement. The early sentiments of the movement were against government only, but slowly it turned towards Hindus as people started calling them Anti-nationals and Khalistani supporters. \nI really used to think that the BJP fanbase will not be "Andh-Bhakt", as is the fanbase of Congress. But no, the level of andh bhakti seen here is bewildering. Don\'t forget at the end of the day faith is faith only. It will not solve your modern day problems.'<br />Author: 'Noidea337'<br />id: 'krsqh8'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Questions on secularism'<br />Body: 'Liberal Hindu here, why is secularism bad?
