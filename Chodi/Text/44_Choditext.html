Because, they all follow *Zohnerism*!!!\n\n\nWhat is this notorious concept of  *Zohnerism*?\n\n\n *Zohnerism* -  is all about twisting of simple facts to confuse people!\nTo know more about it, please read this:\n\n\nIn 1997, 14 year old Nathan Zohner presented his science fair project to his classmates, seeking to ban a highly toxic chemical from its everyday use.\n\n\nThe chemical in question? Dihydrogen monoxide.\n\n\nThroughout his presentation, Zohner provided his audience scientifically correct evidence as to why this chemical should be banned.\n\n\nHe explained that dihydrogen monoxide:\n\n\nCauses severe burns while it‚Äôs in gas form.\n\n\nCorrodes and rusts metal.\n\n\nKills countless amounts of people annually.\n\n\nIs commonly found in tumors, acid rain etc.\n\n\nCauses excessive urination and bloating if consumed.\n\n\nZohner also noted that the chemical is able to kill you if you depend on it and then experience an extended withdrawal.\n\n\nHe then asked his classmates if they actually wanted to ban dihydrogen monoxide.\n\n\nAnd so, 43 out of the 50 children present voted to ban this clearly toxic chemical.\n\n\nHowever‚Ä¶ this chemical isn‚Äôt typically considered toxic at all.\n\n\nIn fact, dihydrogen monoxide is simply H2O, which is nothing but water. \n\n\n\nNathan Zohner‚Äôs experiment wasn‚Äôt a legitimate attempt to ban water, but instead an experiment to get a representation of how gullible people can really be.\n\n\n\nAlso, all of the points that Zohner used to convey his point were 100% factually correct; he just skewed all of the information in his favour by omitting certain facts.\n\n\n\nIn recognition of his experiment, journalist James K. Glassman coined the term "Zohnerism" to refer to "the use of a true fact to lead a scientifically and mathematically ignorant public to a false conclusion".\n\n\n\nAnd this occurs a lot more often than you think, especially when politicians, conspiracy theorists, etc., use proven facts to persuade people into believing false claims and facts.\n\n\n\nThe fact that people can mislead, and be misled so easily, is highly unsettling.'<br />Author: 'BabuBhaiya84'<br />id: 'lc9eni'<br />Flair :Indo-International üì∞</li><li>Title: 'aah gaye gore loog saale bakchodi karne'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'lc965v'<br />Flair :Removed-07-LowQua:stop:</li><li>Title: 'I love Palki she is always for the nation and always stands by truth.

Will any international celebrity speak up for vegetable farmers who don\'t get proper prices for their produce every year in mandis?

Can someone influential who has already started a petition in the past start this one as well? \n\nHere's the petition draft.

These tweets gained popularity really quickly and were a topic of discussion all over the world\n\nAdditionally, Greta Thunberg tweeted another tweet with a toolkit document which was a well-planned itinerary that had all information about planned TwitterStorm, On-Ground Protests, Social Media Campaign, Signing of Petitions and divesting Indian Business with exactly planned timestamps occurring in the month of January and February 2021.\n\nThis tweet was later deleted by Greta but the toolkit document shared by her has been archived and is [available here](https://archive.is/9oF4n). She later [tweeted another toolkit document](https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/view/ehTz+drfKPwi4fP5dn0mivwVCKhwNe7OD1YHDiBUj0Y/) after removing all anti-India planned illustration and information and removed the names of those involved in this plan.\n\nIn order to fight against this social media war started by anti-India elements overseas, Government of India shared facts and asked these influential figures and others to ascertain their facts and have a proper understanding of the issue before commenting on it. MEAIndia shared a tweet corresponding to the same with a Twitter [\\#IndiaTogether](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IndiaTogether) and [\\#IndiaAgainstPropaganda](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IndiaAgainstPropaganda). On the support of this, many Indian influential celebrities like [Sachin Tendulkar](https://twitter.com/sachin_rt/status/1356959311075934215),  [Akshay Kumar](https://twitter.com/akshaykumar/status/1356884526815842304?s=20), [Lata Mangeshkar](https://twitter.com/mangeshkarlata/status/1357006983480700928), [Virat Kohli](https://twitter.com/imVkohli/status/1357016154108166144) and many more also tweeted about this and asked Indians to stay united and repel these anti-India elements.\n\nThis petition is to let the Government of India know that we, **the citizens of India**, are all are now aware of their plan and will repel all the adversaries that are being plotted against Republic of India and Indians internationally.\n\nWe, **the citizens of the Republic of India**, would also like to thanks Indian News Media, Social Media and other Information Media outlets for thwarting this ill-devised plan and sharing this news with facts to every common citizen of India.\n\nPhoto  \n=====  \nhttps://twitter.com/MEAIndia/status/1356853835361259520"<br />Author: 'pkludakgaya'<br />id: 'lbxyyk'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: "Just a week or so back, I heard Ram Guha and Shashi Tharoor say that India needs a leader like Rahane.

I went in depth about all the encounters and sub operations of Blue Star, but one thing really stuck out to me.\n\nWhen I was in 8th grade, my history teacher had told us about Operation Blue Star and she told the class that the Indian Army was trying to get militants hiding in the Golden Temple and came in the complex to do so. The Sikhs in the complex told them to remove their boots and did not allow them to go any further and that this resulted in the army firing upon innocent pilgrims. \nShe did not mention whether this was true or not because all the sources I looked into had nothing on this incident. She didn't speak about any other incident and made it look like that this single story was the entirety of Operation Blue Star.\nShe also did not mention the context for Operation Blue Star at all and made it sound like the army just barged into the Temple with no reason.\nI will say that the army did fire upon pilgrims fleeing from the complex but this does not mean that it was their intention of doing so.\n\nFor years I believed this story to be the truth and did not even bother to check it's authenticity. Only now when I looked into the operation did I come to know that what she was saying was a blatant lie. \n\nTo me this comes across as a blatant attempt at presenting us with false information and trying to get us to sympathise with the khalistani terrorists.

Now I know that it may seem to be bad (Take Kashmir pre 370 Abolishion) but still I find it to be a good idea. \n\nThe Indian Constitution allows states to have their own Flag and Constitution. But this "Constitution" Isn"t the exact definition of a Constitution. It\'s more like a legal document that dictates the relationship and modus oprendai between the state government and the central government and laws concerned to that state particularly. \n\nIt may seem as anti national to some but I think it will be a great idea to strengthen both the regional and national identity! \n\nIndia is a union of many kingdoms that have merged together to form a single sovereign entity. And I feel like refusing to express your states own culture and tradition on a legal level kills the diversity of India. If states actually take time and make their own "Constitution" And flags and nurture their own heritage and traditions on the state level as well as the nation narrative then the mindset of an individual will be happy for both his state and country.\n\nI get it that most (if not all Indians) hate the idea cuz of the Kashmir thing and a few stupid decisions of politicians to put the national flag below their own. But I still find the Idea of presenting the original Dharmic traditions and religion of a state put front on a legal level to be amazing! \n\nLet me know what you guys think about it. \n\nJai Badhri Vishal Lal!'<br />Author: 'Berserker_boi'<br />id: 'lbmc98'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'A weird feeling I had today .'<br />Body: 'Today I went to buy pizza from local place . \n\nI saw a delivery van driver , van was parked on the roadside  and he busy on his smart phone . \n\nEarlier this morning , I was watching Aero India livestream .

These migrations are thought to have spread WSH ancestry and\xa0Indo-European languages\xa0throughout large parts of Eurasia.[1][2][3]\n\nWSHs are considered descended from\xa0Eastern Hunter-Gatherers\xa0(EHGs) who received some admixture from\xa0Caucasian Hunter-Gatherers\xa0(CHGs) during the\xa0Neolithic. The\xa0Y-DNA\xa0of the WSHs was mostly types of\xa0R1a\xa0and\xa0R1b, which are EHG lineages, suggesting that CHG admixture among the WSHs came through EHG males mixing with CHG females.[5]\xa0Around 3,000 BC, people of the\xa0Yamnaya culture, who belonged to the WSH cluster, embarked on a massive expansion throughout\xa0Eurasia, which might have resulted in the dispersal of\xa0Indo-European languages. WSH ancestry from this period is often referred to as\xa0Steppe Early and Middle Bronze Age\xa0(Steppe EMBA) ancestry.[b]\n\nThis expansion led to the rise of the\xa0Corded Ware culture, whose members were of about 75% WSH ancestry, and the virtual disappearance of the Y-DNA of\xa0Early European Farmers\xa0(EEFs) from the European gene pool, significantly altering the cultural and genetic landscape of Europe. During the\xa0Bronze Age, Corded Ware people with admixture from Central Europe remigrated onto the steppe, forming a type of WSH ancestry often referred to as\xa0Steppe Middle and Late Bronze Age\xa0(Steppe MLBA) ancestry.[b]\xa0Through the\xa0Sintashta culture,\xa0Andronovo culture\xa0and\xa0Srubnaya culture, Steppe MLBA was carried into\xa0Central Asia\xa0and\xa0South Asia\xa0along with\xa0Indo-Iranian languages, leaving a long-lasting cultural and genetic legacy.\n\nThe modern population of Europe can largely be modeled as a mixture of WHG (Western Hunter-Gatherer), EEF and WSH. In Europe, WSH ancestry peaks among\xa0Norwegians\xa0(ca. 50%), while in South Asia, it peaks among the\xa0Kalash people\xa0(ca. 50%) and\xa0Brahmins, according to Lazaridis et al. (2016).\xa0Narasimhan et al (2019), which employed a wider range of references in their ancestry models, found lower levels of steppe-derived ancestry among modern South Asians (e.g. ~30% among the Kalash).'<br />Author: 'PleaseAnyoneKillHim'<br />id: 'lbiigt'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Ye kya hogayaaa fe lol'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'lbihit'<br />Flair :Removed-11-Repost:stop:</li><li>Title: 'Aryan Migration, out-of-India shit and dravidians stay away,If you want to learn then you are welcome,trolls stay out'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'lbihhh'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: "I need your help bhratas!
