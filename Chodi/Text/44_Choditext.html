There is sympathy for their plight, there are worldwide protests and rampant Hinduphobia in the media if their interests are even slightly threatened and oftentimes, its the Muslims who are suffering the retribution over something which they instigated in the first place and then the blame game begins and the Hindus are held accountable for retaliation and being intolerant to the atrocious nature of this so called \'peaceful minority\'.\n\nThe genocide suffered by the Hindus of India at the hands of Arab, Turkish, Mughal and Afghan occupying forces for a period of 800 years is as yet formally unrecognized by the World.\n\nWith the invasion of India by Mahmud Ghazni about 1000 A.D., began the Muslim invasions into the Indian subcontinent and they lasted for several centuries. Nadir Shah made a mountain of the skulls of the Hindus he killed in Delhi alone. Babur raised towers of Hindu skulls at Khanua when he defeated Rana Sanga in 1527 and later he repeated the same horrors after capturing the fort of Chanderi. Akbar ordered a general massacre of 30,000 Rajputs after he captured Chittorgarh in 1568. The Bahamani Sultans had an annual agenda of killing a minimum of 100,000 Hindus every year.\n\nThe history of medieval India is full of such instances. The holocaust of the Hindus in India continued for 800 years, till the brutal regimes were effectively overpowered in a life and death struggle by the Sikhs in Punjab and the Hindu Maratha armies in other parts of India in the late 1700’s.\n\nWe have elaborate literary evidence of the world’s biggest holocaust from existing historical contemporary eyewitness accounts. The historians and biographers of the invading armies and subsequent rulers of India have left quite detailed records of the atrocities they committed in their day-to-day encounters with India’s Hindus.\n\nThese contemporary records boasted about and glorified the crimes that were committed – and the genocide of tens of millions of Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhist and Jainist, mass rapes of women and the destruction of thousands of ancient Hindu/Buddhist temples and libraries have been well documented and provide solid proof of the world’s biggest holocaust.\n\n**Quotes from modern historians**\n\nDr. Koenraad Elst in his article “Was There an Islamic Genocide of Hindus?” states:\n\n“There is no official estimate of the total death toll of Hindus at the hands of Islam. A first glance at important testimonies by Muslim chroniclers suggests that over 13 centuries and a territory as vast as the Subcontinent, Muslim Holy Warriors easily killed more Hindus than the 6 million of the Holocaust. Ferishtha lists several occasions when the Bahmani sultans in central India (1347-1528) killed a hundred thousand Hindus, which they set as a minimum goal whenever they felt like punishing the Hindus; and they were only a third-rank provincial dynasty.\n\nThe biggest slaughters took place during the raids of Mahmud Ghaznavi (ca. 1000 CE); during the actual conquest of North India by Mohammed Ghori and his lieutenants (1192 ff.); and under the Delhi Sultanate (1206-1526).“\n\nHe also writes in his book “Negation in India”:\n\n“The Muslim conquests, down to the 16th century, were for the Hindus a pure struggle of life and death. Entire cities were burnt down and the populations massacred, with hundreds of thousands killed in every campaign, and similar numbers deported as slaves. Every new invader made (often literally) his hills of Hindus skulls. Thus, the conquest of Afghanistan in the year 1000 was followed by the annihilation of the Hindu population; the region is still called the Hindu Kush, i.e. Hindu slaughter.”\n\nWill Durant argued in his 1935 book “The Story of Civilisation: Our Oriental Heritage” (page 459):\n\n“The Mohammedan conquest of India is probably the bloodiest story in history. The Islamic historians and scholars have recorded with great glee and pride the slaughters of Hindus, forced conversions, abduction of Hindu women and children to slave markets and the destruction of temples carried out by the warriors of Islam during 800 AD to 1700 AD. Millions of Hindus were converted to Islam by sword during this period.”\n\nFrancois Gautier in his book ‘Rewriting Indian History’ (1996) wrote:\n\n“The massacres perpetuated by Muslims in India are unparalleled in history, bigger than the Holocaust of the Jews by the Nazis; or the massacre of the Armenians by the Turks; more extensive even than the slaughter of the South American native populations by the invading Spanish and Portuguese.”\n\nAlain Danielou in his book, Histoire de l’ Inde writes:\n\n“From the time Muslims started arriving, around 632 AD, the history of India becomes a long, monotonous series of murders, massacres, spoliations, and destructions. It is, as usual, in the name of ‘a holy war’ of their faith, of their sole God, that the barbarians have destroyed civilizations, wiped out entire races.”\n\nIrfan Husain in his article “Demons from the Past” observes:\n\n“While historical events should be judged in the context of their times, it cannot be denied that even in that bloody period of history, no mercy was shown to the Hindus unfortunate enough to be in the path of either the Arab conquerors of Sindh and south Punjab or the Central Asians who swept in from Afghanistan. The Muslim heroes who figure larger than life in our history books committed some dreadful crimes. Mahmud of Ghazni, Qutb-ud-Din Aibak, Balban, Mohammed bin Qasim, and Sultan Mohammad Tughlak, all have blood-stained hands that the passage of years has not cleansed. Seen through Hindu eyes, the Muslim invasion of their homeland was an unmitigated disaster.\n\n“Their temples were razed, their idols smashed, their women raped, their men killed or taken slaves. When Mahmud of Ghazni entered Somnath on one of his annual raids, he slaughtered all 50,000 inhabitants. Aibak killed and enslaved hundreds of thousands. The list of horrors is long and painful. These conquerors justified their deeds by claiming it was their religious duty to smite non-believers. Cloaking themselves in the banner of Islam, they claimed they were fighting for their faith when, in reality, they were indulging in straightforward slaughter and pillage…”\n\nA sample of contemporary eyewitness accounts of the invaders and rulers, during the Indian conquests\n\nThe Afghan ruler Mahmud al-Ghazni invaded India no less than seventeen times between 1001 – 1026 AD. The book ‘Tarikh-i-Yamini’ – written by his secretary documents several episodes of his bloody military campaigns: “The blood of the infidels flowed so copiously at the Indian city of Thanesar that the stream was discolored, notwithstanding its purity, and people were unable to drink it…the infidels deserted the fort and tried to cross the foaming river but many of them were slain, taken or drowned. Nearly fifty thousand men were killed.”\n\nIn the contemporary record – ‘ Taj-ul-Ma’asir’ by Hassn Nizam-i-Naishapuri, it is stated that when Qutb-ul- Din Aibak (of Turko – Afghan origin and the First Sultan of Delhi 1194-1210 AD) conquered Meerut, he demolished all the Hindu temples of the city and erected mosques on their sites. In the city of Aligarh, he converted Hindu inhabitants to Islam by the sword and beheaded all those who adhered to their own religion.\n\nThe Persian historian Wassaf writes in his book ‘Tazjiyat-ul-Amsar wa Tajriyat ul Asar’ that when the Alaul-Din Khilji (an Afghan of Turkish origin and second ruler of the Khilji Dynasty in India 1295-1316 AD) captured the city of Kambayat at the head of the Gulf of Cambay, he killed the adult male Hindu inhabitants for the glory of Islam, set flowing rivers of blood, sent the women of the country with all their gold, silver, and jewels, to his own home, and made about twenty thousand Hindu maidens his private slaves.\n\nThis ruler once asked his spiritual advisor (or ‘Qazi’) as to what was the Islamic law prescribed for the Hindus. The Qazi replied:\n\n*“Hindus are like the mud; if silver is demanded from them, they must with the greatest humility offer gold. If a Mohammadan desires to spit into a Hindu’s mouth, the Hindu should open it wide for the purpose. God created the Hindus to be slaves of the Mohammadans. The Prophet hath ordained that, if the Hindus do not accept Islam, they should be imprisoned, tortured, finally put to death, and their property confiscated.”*\n\nTimur was a Turkic conqueror and founder of the Timurid Dynasty. Timur’s Indian campaign (1398 – 1399 AD) was recorded in his memoirs, collectively known as ‘Tuzk-i-Timuri.’ In them, he vividly described probably the greatest gruesome act in the entire history of the world – where 100,000 Hindu prisoners of war in his camp were executed in a very short space of time. Timur after taking advice from his entourage says in his memoirs :\n\n*“they said that on the great day of battle these 100,000 prisoners could not be left with the baggage and that it would be entirely opposed to the rules of war to set these idolaters and foes of Islam at liberty."*\n\n*“In fact, no other course remained but that of making them all food for the sword"*\n\nTimur thereupon resolved to put them to death. He proclaimed :\n\n*“throughout the camp that every man who has infidel prisoners was to put them to death, and whoever neglected to do so should himself be executed and his property given to the informer. When this order became known to the ghazis of Islam, they drew their swords and put their prisoners to death. 100,000 infidels, impious idolaters, were on that day slain. Maulana Nasir-ud-din Umar, a counselor and a man of learning, who, in all his life had never killed a sparrow, now, in execution of my order, slew with his sword fifteen idolatrous Hindus, who were his captives“.*\n\nDuring his campaign in India – Timur describes the scene when his army conquered the Indian city of Delhi :\n\n*“In a short space of time all the people in the Delhi fort were put to the sword, and in the course of one hour, the heads of 10,000 infidels were cut off. The sword of Islam was washed in the blood of the infidels, and all the goods and effects, the treasure and the grain which for many a long year had been stored in the fort became the spoil of my soldiers.*\n\n*“They set fire to the houses and reduced them to ashes, and they razed the buildings and the fort to the ground. All these infidel Hindus were slain, their women and children, and their property and goods became the spoil of the victors. I proclaimed throughout the camp that every man who had infidel prisoners should put them to death, and whoever neglected to do so should himself be executed and his property given to the informer. When this order became known to the ghazis of Islam, they drew their swords and put their prisoners to death.”*\n\nThe Mughal emperor Babur (who ruled India from 1526 -1530 AD) writing in his memoirs called the ‘Baburnama’ – wrote: ” In AH 934 (2538 C.E.) I attacked Chanderi and by the grace of Allah captured it in a few hours. We got the infidels slaughtered and the place which had been Daru’l-Harb (nation of non-muslims) for years was made into a Daru’l-Islam (a Muslim nation).”\n\nIn Babur’s own words in a poem about killing Hindus (From the ‘Baburnama’ ), he wrote :\n\n*“For the sake of Islam, I became a wanderer, I battled infidels and Hindus, I determined to become a martyr. Thank God I became a Killer of Non-Muslims!”*\n\nThe atrocities of the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan (who ruled India between 1628 – 1658 AD) are mentioned in the contemporary record called: ‘Badshah Nama, Qazinivi &amp; Badshah Nama, Lahori’ and goes on to state: “When Shuja was appointed as governor of Kabul he carried on a ruthless war in the Hindu territory beyond Indus…The sword of Islam yielded a rich crop of converts. Most of the women (to save their honor) burnt themselves to death. Those captured were distributed among Muslim Mansabdars (Noblemen)”\n\nThe Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah Abdali attacked India in 1757 AD and made his way to the holy Hindu city of Mathura, the Bethlehem of the Hindus and birthplace of Krishna.\n\nThe atrocities that followed are recorded in the contemporary chronicle called: ‘Tarikh-I-Alamgiri’ :\n\n*“Abdali’s soldiers would be paid 5 Rupees (a sizeable amount at the time) for every enemy head brought in. Every horseman had loaded up all his horses with the plundered property, and atop of it rode the girl-captives and the slaves. The severed heads were tied up in rugs like bundles of grain and placed on the heads of the captives. Then the heads were stuck upon lances and taken to the gate of the chief minister for payment.*\n\n*“It was an extraordinary display! Daily did this manner of slaughter and plundering proceed. And at night the shrieks of the women captives who were being raped deafened the ears of the people. All those heads that had been cut off were built into pillars, and the captive men upon whose heads those bloody bundles had been brought in, were made to grind corn, and then their heads too were cut off. These things went on all the way to the city of Agra, nor was any part of the country spared.”*\n\nBanda Singh Bahadur was tortured to death after being imprisoned for 3 months. The heart of Banda Singh’s son was put in his mouth in an attempt to humiliate him\n\nWhy we should remember?\n\nThe biggest holocaust in world history has been whitewashed from history.\n\nWhen we hear the word \'holocaust\', most of us think immediately of the Jewish holocaust. Today, with increased awareness and countless cinema films and television documentaries – many of us are also aware of the holocaust of the Native American people, the genocide of the Armenian people in the Ottoman Empire, and the millions of African lives lost during the Atlantic slave trade.\n\nEurope and America produced at least a few thousand films highlighting the human misery caused by Hitler and his army. The films expose the horrors of the Nazi regime and reinforce the beliefs and attitude of the present day generation towards the evils of the Nazi dictatorship.\n\nIn contrast, look at India. There is hardly any awareness among the Indians of today of what happened to their ancestors in the past because a great majority of historians are reluctant to touch this sensitive subject.\n\n**The world seems to either ignore or just does not seem to care about the many millions of lives lost during the 800 years long holocaust of Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists in India.**\n\nThe Indian historian Professor K.S. Lal estimates that the Hindu population in India decreased by 80 million between 1000 AD and 1525 AD, an extermination unparalleled in world history. This slaughter of millions of people occurred over regular periods during many centuries of Arab, Afghan, Turkish and Mughal rule in India.\n\nMany Indian heroes emerged during these dark times, including the 10th Sikh Guru – Guru Gobind Singh and also the Hindu Maratha king – Shivaji Maharaj, who led the resistance against this tyranny and eventually led to its defeat by the late 1700s after centuries of death and destruction.\n\nThe modern world today is facing a global threat from organizations and groups of terrorists such as ISIS, Taliban, and Al-Qaeda whose ideology is chillingly similar to that of the perpetrators of the world’s biggest holocaust in India.\n\nLet us hope that the bloody lessons of the past are learned so that history does not even have the remotest chance of repeating itself.\n\nNever forgive. Never forget. Rise up.'<br />Author: 'TheInsaneM'<br />id: 'fbvmxd'<br />Flair :Research</li>

A flurry of pictures and videos showing brotherhood between people of all religions to ensure that the Tahir Hussain news did not gain too much momentum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Defending Kejriwal, saying he has been made the scapegoat for someone else\'s provocations and actions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.

Ex: BJP knows exactly what Pragya Thakur brings to the table, and they went ahead with her anyway.

They knew it, and AAP and Kejriwal, were right behind him to support him and his plans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, to further deviate from this debate, AAP has given permission to prosecute Kanhaiyya. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.

<li>Title: "Hindus if you want to survive, here's what you need to do even if you live in a Hindu majority area (even if its 100% Hindu)"<br />Body: "1st of all it's important to understand that there are 2 kinds of people in the world (&amp; thus all communities too) - \n\n* about 5% are thinkers (of which 5%-4% = 1% are doers) \n* and the rest are followers without much original thinking (call it circumstances, Karma, genetics, whatever). \n\nBe a thinker &amp; a Doer, the sustenance of Sanatan Dharma requires you to be so! Don't remain a follower alone. Your and Dharmic destiny is in your hands. Hence, you also need to strenghten your hands.\n\nI'll keep it practical\n\n# Accumulate Power\n\n* If you are in college or school, STUDY HARD and WORK your ass off to get into power or to make your thing when the time comes.\n* Do not shun the professions which are generally left-leaning and jihadi sympathizing. The only reason why they are so because we have given ground to them and don't bother to fight to establish ourselves there. \n* So get into Civil/Public Services (all levels bottom to IAS). Wonder why Jamia keeps churning out IAS's ? well bcz they work long term, to occupy power you have to work hard\n* Be lawyers, politicians, journalists, academicians, economists, NGO wallahs,etc. Depending on what you wish to be, choose these careers. Dont stop even if you're the only dharmic stuck in that field. Others will follow.!\n* know this that there will be continuous onslaught of BS in these streams on you and your Dharmic identity. Keep persevering.\n\n# Do not try to avoid risks in life\n\n* Be entrepreneurial, open your own business and employ Dharmic people. This will ensure livelihood security for you and for Dharma. Plus the proceeds from the profits can be utilised for Dharmic causes.\n* Unabashedly use that power for Dharmic well-being (&amp; not personal well-being). Be prudent so that you can remain in power for as long as possible. But power is for Dharma not for you.\n\n# Volunteer\n\n* Whatever your vocation or skills, use a part of that to volunteer at the nearest Gowshala, Mandir, Matth, any other Dharmic cause. \n* Fix a target, say 10% of all weekly work hours shall be volunteered for Dharma. For example, if I am a doctor and if I can visit the local matth to treat/examine people once a week, it'll increase the goodwill of the matth and hence of Dharma. Learn from the Sikhs.\n* Also, join the local shakha of sangh or any other Dharmic cause org. \n* If there's none, then start one!\n\n# Donate\n\n* if you're employed, always donate atleast 10% of your income for Dharmic causes. \n\n# Be a part of and drive community\n\n* Weekly visit your nearest temple and make others visit too. This is the only common places where issues of the Dharmic people can be discussed. Raise and discuss and spread awareness.\n* Know your neighbour, you local politician, local VHP/RSS/other org guys.\n* Maintain a strict vigil on any demographic changes, changes in property constitution\n\n# Be aware and knowledgeable \n\n* Know Dharma. If you don't then you can be easily misled and guilt-tripped into working against Dharma.\n* Don't yield even an inch while defending Dharma. However, be smart and prudent. Know that you (the individual) are an investment for Dharmic cause. The investment must last long.\n* Read a lot. Maintain a reading habit. Start with works of Sitaram Goel, RC Majumdar etc. There are more knowledgeable folks \n\n# Spread awareness \n\n* So that we have as less a percentage as possible of dhimmies.\n* In your families, neighborhoods, classrooms, offices. Don't get into conflicts but also don't just let misled people remain misled.\n\n# Don't fund your own slaughter\n\n* Don't use any halal certified thing (goods or service) even if it is cheaper. Check out the halalanomics talk on Srijan channel on YT\n* Dont watch propaganda channels like NDTV, IndiaToday &amp; aajtak (YES!!), ABP (sorry Rubika Liyaqat), BBC etc even if they might have a few virat anchors. Know that its taqqiya by these agencies. Instead watch Republic, IndiaTV, ZeeNews, Wion, etc \n* Don't buy commie/namazi newspapers or magazines like TheHindu, IE, Tribune, Deccanherald, National herald, Outlook, TIME, IndiaToday. Go for regional chads like Dainik Jagran, Dainik Bhasker etc\n* This is because each view/subscriber/click adds to their traffic which they can use to get more premium for adverts on their network. \n\nWe'll have to do all of this our whole life!!!! \n\nDo this and inspire your kids to do the same for Dharma. There's a price for everything. This is the minimum price for ensuring our security and sustenance"<br />Author: 'Puckshi'<br />id: 'far3pv'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>

<li>Title: 'Do you really think RW is growing?'<br />Body: "*Do you really think the logical RW community is growing on Instagram, Twitter, Reddit etc?* It's upsetting how foreign journalists and media outlets are still siding with the left in every manner possible. I genuinely feel that there are a lot of virat bhratas and bhaginis on Instagram and Twitter that stay silent because they're afraid of being branded a 'bhakt' or because the notion suggests that being RW is somehow regressive and not in vogue. A lot of people I talk with are low-key RW but they won't come out and say it openly. However, if you look at the liberals, they think it's some sort of chip on their shoulder when they throw around baseless words like 'fascist' or 'pogrom'. \n\nAlso, I feel that the recent CAA conundrum has actually solidified the BJP's core voter base which was still somewhat disorganized before. Each riot, each controversial statement by the left, each attempt to malign Sanatan Dharma, our police and military forces, our judiciary strengthens the RW community. *What do you have to say about this?*\n\nOne last point. I really appreciate the memes and posts on this sub but I wish there was more sane and logical discussion.

<li>Title: 'Before Soros - Part 2'<br />Body: '1991 - great depression for India. the economy was in tatters. here is how it unfolded,\n\nfrom Nehru to Indira Gandhi communist thinking to hold all of the resources to state created a policy which was effectively slow poison. it was okayish policy as long as we were not exporting much but as India industrialized itself there were more and more things needed to be imported. be it oil or industrial parts India needed it as it grew. meanwhile, exports were staggeringly low due to draconian policy. \n\nReal Problem started in the 80\'s gulf war. as oil prices jumped our import costs went out of control. exports slumped. investors year after year flagged off. The fiscal deficit grew and it had a spiral effect on the deficit which created a payment crisis of 1990. The foreign exchange reserves had dried up to the point that India could barely finance three weeks\' worth of imports. With India’s foreign exchange reserves at $1.2 billion in January 1991 and depleted by half by June barely enough to last for roughly 3 weeks of essential imports, India was only weeks away from defaulting on its external balance of payment obligations. Yes everyone thought India is lost cause at that time. everyone thought India is going to default. IMF, the world bank said no to India for loans. investors took all most all the foreign investment. GDP for 1991 was 1.1%. So next time someone says to you about GDP let them know this.\n\non top of that corruption played a very vital role during the Rajiv Gandhi era. some of them were, Only four or five licenses would be given for steel, electrical power, and communications. License owners built up huge powerful empires. A huge private sector emerged. State-owned enterprises made large losses.\n\nIncome Tax Department and Customs Department became inefficient in checking tax evasion. Infrastructure investment was poor because of the public sector monopoly. Licence Raj established the "irresponsible, self-perpetuating bureaucracy that still exists throughout much of the country and corruption flourished under this system.\n\nthe situation was so dire that all of our gold reserves needed to be mortgaged in exchange for 500 million USD. Most people think it was Narasimha Rav and Manmohan Singh which took out India and freed India at that time. but here is a reality check for all of you. Liberalization was the first condition of the world bank. other conditions were to relax license raj, allow state resources to be freed and available to businesses.\n\nAt the same time, the USA was fighting war again with iraq and CIA had no interest other than middle east and USSR was gone. So that era was quite free from foreign government interruption. But that was the era when business man\'s started looking at India as something that had massive resources with a huge market. So first time capitalists had eyes on India.\n\nwho are those people? and why are they so much interested in countries politics? it\'s answer is simple - GREED. capitalists want a favorable business environment to grow. if they see there will be any trouble they will use all methods (shaam,daam,dand,bhed) to create favorable positions.\n\nSo our Hero(actually villain) Soros comes to the party right? Nope, he wasn\'t even interested in India until 2005. So what was going on? well as India started recovering from major economic collapse lots of people had an eye set on India. When world bank gives loans to nations they always tangled some sort of businessman with the deal that\'s how business works.\n\nBefore going to detail analysis let\'s understand how they operate? Well they use the same strategy used by communists doctrine. The first one is to create useful idiots who will help them to take foot into country. the second one uses web of NGO\'s to see how good work you are doing but behind the scenes use NGO\'s to do dirty work . third one infiltrates politics of country to capture the root of country. for half a century that was how USA and Russia controlled half the world but in new world order, some individual powerful people emerged who were enjoying this power game. you want to hear it from someone who has executed this strategy here it is video which tells you in great length how to control narrative Russian way( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfvXwuZ-bok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfvXwuZ-bok) full video at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgmg2VFX058](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgmg2VFX058) ).\n\nIn India, ford foundation was the NGO backed by CIA. And there are lots of small NGO\'s which were not classified as ngo but agricultural organizations BY CPI. the strategy was they will buy crops from farmers at cheaper price and russia or china will give them 10x the money for the same crop. that is how cpi was funded for most of the early years. Same hypocrite CPI parties always demanded that NGO\'s should be regularized and should disclose foreign funds during 70 and 80\'s. they wanted to target CIA baked Ford foundation and RSS as well. in 80\'s Indira allowed law which asked NGO\'s to disclose their income. So how did Ford foundation survived that? well, They never registered in India. socked? there are lot of things like that which are going to sock you in the next parts as we move on to capitalists in our next part.'<br />Author: 'hd-86'<br />id: 'faogre'<br />Flair :Research</li>

We had our moments of Kashmir, Ram mandir, Modi 2.0 and we were all so happy. But CAA/NRC randirona was taken lightly by govt and us included. Then that bakchodi sub fiasco happened which reduced our power meanwhile top subs on reddit is basically modded by randians, pakis and liblefts who just want to portray India and Hinduism as evil because they hate BJP. \n\nI see Chodis here complaining that Hindus are not united and siding with islamists. Also how reddit censor pro right content and users just gang up on you for supporting Hindus or BJP. Some even thinking this is end of Hinduism and India.\n\nBs itne m phat gyi? (Got scared by just this). Listen the Muslims are a backward degenerate community which is happy being in that position. Hindus still dominate in almost every aspect of society. Do these riots will stop you from clearing a exam and getting a decent job meanwhile your neighbour Abdul is stuck in his shithole. For once in a while, yes they create ruckus. Some kill and some die. But at the end who still dominates every social aspect of our daily lives. Hindu culture and traditions in one way or other. Heck if they are renovating Aurangzeb's tomb. Let them. Does it change the fact you are sitting in your comfy home with laptop while most of the Muslims are selling fruits, fixing vehicles, running non veg restaurants in some ghetto area. Even if Hindus are not united, at the end of day you and your librandu friend are both well off while the Muslim is still stuck in his ghetto.\n\nReddit and Instagram does not represent shit. Twitter is just randirona and some news. People here occasionally gather to shit on India confirming their already racist bias. They then forget and go back to subs about cats, dogs, sex, memes, etc. Best you can do is ignore the shit about India in political subs and when in non political subs first judge whether users there are racist, lefties or not and then try to defend India. Otherwise, you will just be ridiculed, downvoted and banned.\n\nWho cares what some chutiya sitting in New Orlando, Chicago or London thinks of India and Modi. China cares about goras? Japan cares about goras? Why should we? Okay we got so much shit but don't you think left approving of Muslim everytime will not let them improve themselves and occupy higher positions in society. In the end, it's Hindu who wins. Even if left gives them a push they will still follow their Sharia refusing modern day realities and freebies are shit if the guy eventually does not learn how to catch a fish.\n\nNow there is going to be some randirona about Holi. Water shortage, boycott holi for our victim muslim brothers, holi is patriarchy, etc. Bc let them do it. You will still put that gulal on the hot chick and throw your friend in that mudpool while Rana Ayyub will keep writing in WSJ how holi hurts Muslims. \n\nThey will never Win. Sanatan is eternal.

<li>Title: 'I have a confession to make PART I . This confession is in 3 parts.'<br />Body: 'I always thought that somehow  ,some how some hindus could grow a spine and back up what they say and try to do the right thing according to their DHARMA. But no, they cannot. Why ??? \n\nBecause they don\'t want to. \n\nThey always keep pointing out to the outside  problem i.e. MUSLIMS, XTIANS, CULTURAL MARXISTS,etc. \n\nThe problem is hindus have lost it completely. \n Not many, i think ALL HINDUS HAVE LOST IT. \n\n\nThis is the 1st time i am posting on the topic of hindus , but i know i would get a lot of flak from everyone, even as i am sitting in canada. \n\n\nOk, so lets start with the problems :- \n\n1- ISLAM. Hindus keep getting reminded that they have a mental scar that there women were sold in the markets of Damascus as SEX SLAVES by islamic invaders. \n\nThe point is ,THATS EXACTLY TRUE. We cannot run away from the PAIN we experience from just that realization. However the solution is to fight back , not get disheartened like Chhatrapati SHIVAJI RAO MAHARAJ ji, GURU GOBIND SINGH JI and LACHIT BORFUKAN and Raja Krishna dev Rai, Harihar Rai, Bukka Rai , etc. \n\nAll the hindu temples and sites been destroyed coz hindus were busy fighting each other. We have never been able to become as thick-skinned as muslims who even defend the indefensible and even rapists and cases like LOVE JIHAD, etc. Even their women are RADICAL enough to travel to syria to be a sex slave of a mujahid who is fighting for #ISIS. \n\n\nOn one hand , muslims are that radicalized and on the other hand what do we hindus do ????\n\n\nWe support LGBTQ+ , why ?? Coz RSS chief said so. \n\nIs RSS chief your overlord or what ??? \n\n\nWe support communal harmony, when we exactly know what is happening everywhere. \n\n\nWe support indian laws to be biased towards hindus and especially against HINDU MEN. \n\n\nIn islam polygamy is allowed. \n\nIn hinduism ??? \n\n\nFather of Lord Ram ( for whom every hindu bows down to generally) had 3 wives. \n\n\nLord Krishna had many marriages \nLord Ganesh ji has 2 wives ( ma riddhi and ma siddhi) \nLord Kartikeya ji ( son of lord shiva) has 2 wivrs. \n\n\nWhy hindu men cannot marry and have more children ? Atleast who could afford ????  \n\nDemography is the key to everything. \nFuture belongs to those who SHOW UP. \nThats why all these military age males have invaded EU as well and are raping white european women. \n\nAnd every indian hindu girl is nowadays is a feminist.  Who just wanna emasculate hindu men into submission. \n\nAnd marital laws are shit. Community doesn\'t take care of anyone  of their own and they don\'t wanna have kids. \n\nWhy ???  Are these all problems created by muslims ??? \n\n\nWhats the solution ?? Create a real HINDU PATRIARCHY  and enlist all boys to be trained in gurukul in martial arts. Told to retain their semen and taught the benefits of celibacy. \n\n\nYes in this day and age of bachelorette parties in even small towns and suburbs where male strippers and gigolos are doing good in their business and extra-marital affairs and everything what men do , women do the same and even better (lol,VIVA LA FEMINISM),if womsn could sleep aroujd with many partners , why not men should have multiple wives i am talking about those things from thousands of years ago \n\nWhich need to be re-installed to create a HINDU PATRIARCHY for the protection of hindu women and children. \n\n6\nAnyways, now coming to economics, a gurukul could be built in each of the 632  districts of india with our own money. Seperate school for boys and seperate school for girls. \n\n\n\nNow if  these things are allowed, you would not be afraid of increasing muslim demography, coz your own demography would be increasing and i would say skyrocketing. \n\nNow you would say ,"what about scarce resources ???" \n\nDo you really give a flying f%$k about it ??? \nNobody does , so you should not also. \n\nIf hindus were that red-pilled then india would not had been partitioned and a seperate nation for muslims would had been carved out of india. \n\nWe were blue-pilled then and we are still blue-pilled even NOW.  So you cannot rely on government and politicians to save you coz you DO NOT MATTER since your demography is DYING. \n\nMuslims would not stop having kids, mark my words. They don\'t care about anything in the world. Whether people call them poor, whether people call them jihadi, product of HALALA, etc. They simply don\'t care. \n\nSo lets put on our thinking caps and try to find out the solutions for all this right ??? \n\nCoz hindus pay their taxes to enrich the welfare programmes for muslims. Its not the other way round. Plus they have theur saudi arabian paymasters to bankroll them via ZAQAT (aka khairaat) in the form of aid and mosques and charitable institutions and madarsas, etc. \n\n\nHindus don\'t haveanything but just a hogwash of being elitist and egotistical and trying to appear as if they are educated and civil. \n\nThe world doesn\'t respect anybody. \n\nDoesn\'t matter if you are a CEO of google or whatever, you would still be inferior to those who have the conviction to blow up themselves as suicide bombers in the name of their religion. \n\n\nNow am i telling you to do the same and become a suicide bomber ?? Certainly NOT. \n\nWhat i am saying is to increase your demography. And have polygamous marriages. \n\n\nSo that society gets some babies out of it. As our future generations to keep hinduism alive. \n\n\n\nMuslims have not stopped hindus from doing anything which i have said so far.'<br />Author: 'martianlonewolf'<br />id: 'faah06'<br />Flair :Rant</li>

Fuck you all for making up this bull shit called jobs. You know what i think about your careers? I think it's a waste of time, i think it's just another delusion for adultish children who can't grasp the concept of unemployment. They all want to just believe in something good after college. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is you get a job and start earning. Your body will go fat due to lack of physical activity, your hair will recede and one day get blown out into the universe during a loud fart.\r\n\r\nYou are as significant as the other person next to you in this workplace. You matter only till you put down your papers. But paper itself is being a part of this workplace.\r\n\r\nBut you are here in the now, you are existing in this office where time passes and the SEZ is bigger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing on your boss made stories. There is no hike, there are no appraisals, there is no promotion or demotion. But there is an office where we all work. Jobs have brought us nothing but money and office politics at a scale that would make Bihar assembly like a classroom politics. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless dreams that were lost because your job asked you to do so. None of your jobs are without sweat on your brows. All of your jobs have committed brutal acts of layoffs. And none of your jobs have been able to answer any of the basic questions of love, sex and dhoka. Credit card bill and housing loan installment is what a job is.\r\n\r\nLet go of these adult fantasies people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your bank balance. Believe in the interest rates of banks, have faith on mutual funds. We are all part of this company which is part of a MNC. What determines our job satisfaction is not what you did for your job but what you did for the future of your company which is part of a MNC. Your legacy should always be the betterment of the team.\r\n\r\nA little over 30 years ago we emerged as modern coders in Bangalore. We learnt to code java, tamed python, debugged software and wrote programs and eventually testing. We left Bengaluru 20 years ago, we started drinking beer, driving rashly and getting high. Then we discovered Jio with its cheap internet plan and every chutiya sadakchhap has become a philosopher. So when we are done with jerking off the two drops to porn, we spew shit on internet and demean our country and culture and troll incessantly for a few internet points. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all.But this evil thing called jobs is dead set on taking us humans back to the office.\r\n\r\nLeave your jobs, open your mind and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us other than our Job Titles. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on a degree in liberal arts and free internet and lots of spare time we become better, but the moment we have a job all of humanity's hard work is destroyed. Job is evil and it makes all employed people evil by extension. Fuck all jobs the scourge of humanity.\r\n\r\nEdit.

Remember how Sharjeel Imam, the original organiser of Shaheen Bagh had the same initial aim, which is to make CAA an international issue, which he saw as an  effective strategy for demonisation and hence removal of CAA. Same kind of attention grabbing sit-ins were planned at multiple locations in Delhi, and maybe also other States. This however was just too much for all others. Having spoken with common people of Delhi, even the non-participants in any kind of agitation wanted the anti-CAA protesters to be countered. Pro-CAA rallies took place aimed at protesting against further obstructive anti-CAA protests and sit-ins. Somewhere along the line someone or the other objected to their ideological opposites. Judging from available footage, stone pelting was started by some belonging to Muslim inhabitated areas, especially from roof tops.

Only thing reddit can do is permaban people, they can\'t stop you from making a new account otherwise they\'d be affecting their business. \n\nWhat is our main objective? Bringing the Hindu Rashtra through meme magic (I\'m not even kidding about this) and metaphorically beheading libs and exposing them for the hijdas that they are. Krishna said we must do our duty, not worry about the fruits. I know the kinda guy VTPABHR is, usko jita bhi ban karlo, jitne bhi walls bana do, woh ek bangladeshi migrant ki tarah ghus jayega. \n\nBhratas VTPABHR jaise bano, Lord Krishna ki suno, do not be attatched to your accounts, do not fear bans - just meme and slay. They can take your account away from you but not your creativity, intelligence and general badassness. They hate you because you are better than them so worry not. There is no higher honour that Reddit can give you than the perma ban. \n\nIdeally when you make a second account it\'s better not to have any relation to the first or the same people who reported your old account will report your new one, happened to me is liye bol raha hu. \n\nThey have the sub dedicated to the President of the United States in quarantine for being "toxic" while far more toxic left subs are allowed free reign, do not even for a second forget that you are in enemy territory.

We had already accepted homosexuality (it\'s the Brits who came and criminalised it).\n\nWe had invented zero, trigonometry. We had figured out that the Earth is round way before the Western society. We used to respect each and every component of mother nature and treat it like a god because we were thankful to our creators.\n\nDo me a favour. Go and read Gita. It\'s then when you\'ll really understand the beauty of Hinduism.\n\nThe modern politicization of this beautiful religion is degrading its meaning and it\'s essence.\n\nI really don\'t understand the whole hatred that\'s been brewing between conservatives and liberals in our country. Yes we do have a different opinion but then hating each other because of that is completely senseless. Our political leaders don\'t respect their ideologies. Look at Maharashtra elections. BJP had formed an alliance with NCP, Congress and NCP had formed an alliance with Shiv Sena. These guys have no regard for their ideologies.

VPTABHR's family was personally affected by terrorism. And in one of his first interactions with the Librandu sub, being the inhuman savages they are, they mocked and jeered at that fact. VPTABHR gave it back to them and roasted them hard. They even gave a flair for him on the sub titled 'Family deserved it and more'. He never reported them or anything.\n\nSince then, they were spamming and stalking him, by tagging him in random small subreddits. At each opportunity he roasted them hard. \n\nHe owned them with facts, logic and memes.

I then go to the bathroom\n6:30 AM-\xa0My day always starts with the reading of the Communist Manifesto. After that, I go and prostrate before the images of Marx, Lenin and Nehru.\n7 AM-\xa0I go down to the hall where all of our family sits down for breakfast. My father (The Hindu editor), mom (NDTV anchor), grand father (Congress politician) and my grandmom (NAC member) sit together with me. Together, we have a typical liberal’s breakfast- Chicken, Beef, Mutton. In the background lies a PETA poster.\n7:30 AM-\xa0Me and my mates from the local NGO gather at their meeting place. We all worship our true lord Jesus Christ together. Then, we practice demonizing Hindu Gods so that our secularism score increases.\n8 AM-\xa0Me and my NGO friends set out for a remote village to convert more people into Christianity. Yeah, the same rice bag converts. On the way, I see a few children happily celebrating a Hindu festival. I feel guilty over the same.\n9 AM-\xa0After fulfilling our conversion quota for the day (500), me and my NGO mates return back. I go back to my home. Then, to get rid of my guilt feelings, I go and write articles for The Wire, Buzzfeed, New York Times, The Hindu and Washington Times.\n10 AM-\xa0Go around my neighborhood and litter it. I want to keep people away from the influence of Evil Swacch Bharat campaign. I tell the people how Modi wants to make India a Hindu Rashtra by silently forcing the Hindu way of life on us.\n11 AM-\xa0Make my way to the local office of the Communist Party. Me and my comrades watch Soviet propaganda and yearn for a Communist rule in India. Later, we head out to our local neighbourhood.\n1 PM-\xa0By 1 PM, me and my comrades are done distributing pamphlets on how communism will be beneficial for society. We have successfully brainwashed 40 people today and kept them away from the evil influence of capitalism.\n2 PM-\xa0Go back to my home for lunch. For lunch, I like to have poha with illegal Bangladeshi immigrants who my other liberal buddies helped get into India. After lunch, me and the immigrants like to play a game of cards known as “Victim Card”.\n3 PM-\xa0Attend my school just for one hour. It is always the maths period this time. But since I am keen to show my intellectualism, I always end up blabbering something and making a farrago of the situation.\n4 PM-\xa0Again go back to the local Communist Party office. Me and my comrades go the rich neighborhood nearby and study about the poverty there. We then conclude that the poverty is due to rich people and they need to be taught a lesson. I tweet about how poor people (10 LPA, own Swift dzire, AC, independent house) are suffering in this rich neighborhood. My blind Twitter followers start a campaign on the same.\n5 PM-\xa0Go back to my home and write conspiracy theories on how Swacch Bharat will lead to Hindu Rashtra.\n7 PM-\xa0Go to the house of a terrorist and report on their “human” side. I openly claim that I don’t support any party, but secretly I encourage Kejriwal to contest as PM candidate in 2024.\n8 PM-\xa0Write articles on banning Holi (save water), Diwali (cracker noise), Lohri etc. But at the same time, I write articles justifying other religion’s festivals.\n9 PM-\xa0Watch Ravish Kumar’s prime time on NDTV while eating beef roast (a typical Liberal dinner).\n10 PM-\xa0Prostrate before images of Lenin, Marx and Nehru. Read the Communist Manifesto once again. Photograph myself with sickle and hammer. Blame Modi for not being able to sleep.\n10: 30 PM-\xa0After half an hour of blaming Modi, go to sleep\nSo, thus this is the daily life of a typical Indian liberal.\n\n\nTaken from a quora answer'<br />Author: 'rollexxx_'<br />id: 'f7ry2a'<br />Flair :MyBhagwaPillStory</li>

Do people not train themselves from others? Is it not easier to refer to Muslims as M, as done by others, if it is used 22,000 times within a sub? \n\n*  Is there a consistent pattern? \nYes, as you have revealed with your amusing statistics. \n\n*  Does dynastycrooks have a role within this? \nb O r I n g webpage.

<li>Title: '[Flair Dekho] 16 year old kids on Randia be like'<br />Body: ' So, a bit of context here. I\'m 16, and My parents are regular BJP supporters and a regular watcher of Sudhir choudrey. I don\'t mind that. They voted for BJP in 2019 elections. Don\'t mind that either. Support CAA and basically everything BJP does. That kinda was a shock for me, so in December I sat down with them and had a casual chat, not trying to appear too political in front of them, as they don\'t like it.\n\nBoth my mom and dad said "Beta hum to Andhbhakth Nahi Hain, but modiji Jo Kar rahe Hain desh ki bhalai ke liye hai, congress mein bahut scams hua tha to BJP chun liya"\n\nHmm. Typical Bhakt mentality. Didn\'t really mind that too, didn\'t expect much anyway.\n\nFrom January onwards, I started doing some intense research and factchecking on everything that happened in politics since 2004. My views completely changed. I went from being apolitical to being genuinely worried about the future of our country.\n\nIn mid January, the Indian residents in Colombo (where I live) were having a CAA-NRC protest in the Indian Embassy. Two of my friends were going. But as soon as my parents figured out, they went crazyyy. I got grounded for a week, electronics confiscated, and was called an "antinational, deshdrohi, anti-modi pappu supporter (tho I don\'t support congress )" and so much more I can\'t even put in words possibly.\n\nI let that happen. More things happened, i just let it happen. This was becoming commonplace now. Until today\n\nI was just sitting on my desk, studying for mock exams, when my dad calls me. He asks me why dosent UAE, Saudi and other gulf countries take in rohingyas if they\'re so important to me apparently. He was arguing why rich middle Eastern countries, thousands of kilometres away from the refugees, take in those people if they really are so important. After completely countering his dumb logic, he snapped.\n\n(Btw, my dad had always supported equality. Never seen him like this)\n\nHe got up and started shouting in my face about how Muslims are a plague and they were taking over the damn world. He said that Muslims don\'t migrate to Muslim countries, instead to other non Muslim countries coz there they will have 5-6 children and spread their relegion. Then, they take over the entire govt once their population gets high enough and collapse entire governments. He then started saying about exactly the things godi media says, about how Hindus are in EXTREME DANGER to Muslims and how India will turn into a fascist Muslim state if nothing is done, even if all stats point otherwise. As soon as I pointed it out, ironically I was hit with "YE SAB FAKE NEWS HAI YOU ARE USING WAYY TOO MUCH INTERNET FOR A CHILD". Ironically, I\'d heard Sudhir choudrey say something similar to this, about how children spend too much time researching fake news on politics and the internet, not 3 weeks ago. After his Muslim rant was over, he shifted to Hindus. As "proof", he said all Muslims read Qur\'an and pray in mosque, which according to him, even tho we are from uttar pradesh of all states, less than 1% of Hindus read holy books and go to temple and properly follow our relegion. He continued about Hindu supremacy, about how we should be superior. I\'d never heard him talk that way. To try and calm things down, I tried to remind him I\'m athiest. That was the end to it.\n\nI got dragged by the ears, and got smashed on the head with a steel plate that was nearby. Got slapped and hit, didn\'t do anything. He said that he\'s going to disown me if I don\'t say I\'m a pure Hindu in 5 seconds, which I out of no choice did, and that I will read 30 pages from Ramayana and bhagvad Gita everyday. He called me a terrorist, a failure, a shame on India and consequently locked me in the room and confiscated everything I had. Typing all this from grandmother\'s phone.\n\nAll the emotional weight aside, I feel like I\'ve lost it. I\'ve lost the freedom to speak. The freedom of speech. The right to have an opinion.\n\nEverything I say, I get back a "tum bachche ho, 18 Saal ke hokar Kuch Karna, tumhe Kuch samajh Nahi aata"\n\nSo much more things happened that I can\'t describe. I was hit so bad, and insulted to the face because I had a different opinion. I thought about it and realised all my dad did for past 3 years was watch zee news continuously from 7 pm to 10 pm. Nothing else. Having an opinion is deshdrohi, antinational, and if you don\'t support our great leader mudi, you shall be banished in hell. I\'m emotionally drained.\n\nTl;Dr: had a different opinion than Bhakt parents. Got beaten up and scolded and locked up for that.\n\nI don\'t know where else to post this, I feel like I cannot trust anybody anymore, that I\'ve been stripped of basic rights.'<br />Author: 'abdul_786'<br />id: 'f67crq'<br />Flair :Randia Simulation</li>

Seriously, while western media and Jihadi and Wahabbi-funded news outlets try to justify every wrong of Islam and treat terrorists as 'austere religious scholar', the only people who support Hindus are other Hindus. Even then some Hindus try to be secular and say 'Hindu Muslim Bhai Bhai'. Seriously, fuck them. Kashmiri Pundits who grew up with Muslim friends, were betrayed and killed by those same friends. The biggest mistake of Kashmiri Pundits was trusting others, instead of retreating until matters in the valley settled.  \n\nSometimes some Muslim and Hindu kids hug, or some Muslim guy does something good for a Hindu guy or gets involved in Hindu festivals or processions, and all of a sudden leftists act like now there is no enmity and all communal problems have been solved. They cherrypick incidents, instead of looking through history and seeing the various atrocities committed by Muslim rulers on people belonging to Dharmic religions. Even that's not their fault, our history books are written by the biggest cucks who can only write about how Mughals were great and how it was the 'golden period of India'. \n\nWe have been living a life appreciating foreign culture. We appreciate Taj Mahal and Red Fort, something that isn't even ours. We appreciate Mughlai dishes and cuisine, and have forgotten our own ghar ka khana. Earlier it was Mughal cock sucking, now it is Western cock sucking. Defame your own countrymen for some cheap validation by a gora, and even that isn't received many a times.\n\nGoras are **NOT** our friends. Yes, there have been some great westerners like Srimati Annie Besant who helped us, but let me tell you this: anyone who acts like they support us, which includes conservative politicians like Trump and Boris Johnson, secretly hate us because they think we are uncivilised. The whole world thinks of us as uncivilised, call Bharat Mata a 'shithole', a 'fucking terrible country', and even many of our own people say that for gora validation. \n\nPeople act like every Indian man is a fucking pervert. Little do they know, the Hindu middle class and upper middle class men are some of the most well behaved people. Our women are called ugly, even though many Miss World and similiar pageants are won by them. \n\nWe have endured this for too long. We must rise up, not to show them, but to better ourselves as a society. I know there are problems with our society, but we must embrace our Hindu culture and past, and even improve upon it. I don't care if anyone calls me bhakt, sanghi, islamophobic etc. Yes, I am a bhakt of Mahadev and Janardhan, of my country's glorious past, yes I am a sanghi, yes, I abhor Islam because it is the ideology which resulted in the exploitation and torture of my ancestors. I believe that only if we embrace Hindu culture, we can improve our country.

If that happened, that will be the end of this 1000+ years fight between two religions in India. \n\nAs pointed out by a fellow redditor, that whenever a riot occurs between hindus and muslims, maximum casualties are from the green team. This civil war might ignite anti-muslim sentiments in other countries also, like Sweden, Britain etc. \n\nThis is the most probable event as the population of muslims is rising rapidly as comparison to hindus. PCB and UCC will curb this as well, if they got passed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Breaking of Pakistan**\n\nPakistan is like a fading lamp, it will flicker fast in upcoming years, never to rise again.\n\nIf the partition of Pakistan do happen, POK, Punjab and Sindh might be assimilated back to India. Balochistan will be a separate country. Huge muslim population will be a problem for India.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Full scale war between India and Pakistan**\n\nIt is expected that before Pakistan breaks, it will try to fight its last war with India. This will not be a problem for India due to superior military and firepower.\n\nChina taking advantage of this will be a whole other game. We will have to fight on both ends, protecting Arunachal as well as Rajasthan.\n\nMuslims of India, as expected, might show solidarity with their brothers and cause mini riots throughout the country. \n\nIf a war happens, it will test the unity of Hindus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Another partition of India**\n\nI hope this is the least probable of all, i cant see a part of myself being gutted away like this in my life. Anyway, if this do happen, probably because of extremely high muslim population in that area and coward govt, and if Hindus will still be sleeping, then nobody can save them.\n\n \n\nWhat do you think about this?"<br />Author: 'PrimalIndori'<br />id: 'f5b4ow'<br />Flair :Rant</li>

<li>Title: 'Keep it in your pants, Che.'<br />Body: 'Warning :  user is primarily a lurker in these parts and is unfamiliar with the unspoken rules of Reddit interactions.\n\nI\'ve had it with liberal/commie men trying to gaslight me.\nSome context - I\'m a privileged, city-bred, convent school educated, south-indian who was raised around other, equally privileged kids, a majority of whom are left leaning.\nNaturally, I blend in with this lot. My English is accented, I spend too much time discussing Netflix shows and my mental health, I know more about American culture than I do my own, my self-worth is directly proportional to the number of followers I have on Instagram, I idolize one or more of the morally and intellectually bankrupt cunts that work at the quint/wire/print, spend all my money on poor stand-up and expensive restaurants where I can ridicule you when you mispronounce amuse-bouche.\n\nConsidering my environment, my centre-right leanings make me a rarity, which wasn\'t a problem until I started dating.\nNow, almost every erudite conversationalist on Tinder has an outrageous bio along the lines of \'bhakts swipe left\' or \'rally against capitalist scum\'\nThe liberal [chadbro atheist that hates his Hindu identity, says he wants to spoil you silly because his parents used money as a substitute for love and attention, cannot handle rejection] and the commie [sucks kejru dick, quotes Marx incessantly, wears tie-dye kurtas to pull off authentic hipster look] respectively.\nNow I usually don\'t bring politics into these interactions because the truth is - any additional filters will ensure I die alone.\n(single virat bois, hmu?)\n\nWhen asked about it, these men like to pretend like they\'re invested in the future of this country and offer meaningless, pseudo- moralistic, well-rehearsed platitudes instead of facts during a debate.\nPersonally, I think their unapologetic stance is a desperate bid to stay relevant and an excellent way to conceal how vapid, shallow, pretentious and conceited they actually are. This way, they maybe garner the approval of some unassuming woman who is on the fence or can\'t form opinions of her own.\nWhich brings me to my problem - I can\'t tolerate conversation with these men let alone date or have sex with them. Tbh, I may do a liberal, but sex with a commie is just bad karma. Pretty sure the Ganga can\'t cleanse my soul of that sin.\n\nNow I know there isn\'t a lack of well educated men on the right, but wtf you guys? Where y\'all at?\nWhy don\'t our men unabashedly and unapologetically publicize their affiliation or affection with and for the right?\nI\'m assuming this is another side effect of Indian conservatives being wholly dismissed as "regressive" and "uneducated". Labels like "brown shirt" or "fascist" ensures dialogue and debate remains a courtesy that\'s never extended to us. So much for free speech!\nBut I can\'t be the only one that feels increasingly isolated, right? It\'s gotten so bad that a drunken, frustrated rant on Reddit seemed like a good idea. \nAnyway, I may have teetered off topic here but the point is - if one more commie cunt or liberal fuck tries to proselytize me or thinks he can get away with saying things like \'oh it breaks my heart that a girl like you supports such a dangerous ideology\' or \'hate sex with you would be great\', I\'m going to start doing justice to the labels and begin knifing people in the ribs.\nAlternatively, the right could be sneaky and develop our own system of codes to communicate with each other. And no, the irony of that isn\'t lost on me.\nI know that this comes off as a desperate cry for attention, that\'s because it is.\nOh, also before I get accused of being a randian trying to honeytrap chodis, I\'m willing to go get banned on r/India rn to prove where my loyalties lie.\n\nTL;DR : want to date but can\'t find any right-wing bois.

Even after that there were 27 (correct me if I\'m wrong) were AAP just won by 1000 votes and AAP also had in favour the media houses and academicians on their side. What this does is, it gives a respite to the so called "protestors" who have "saved" India\'s soul. \n\nOkay so what will happen now ?

<li>Title: 'Rules of Jihad'<br />Body: '1. Jihad is sanctioned by Allah. There is no higher authority, therefore it is always justified.\n2. Never abide by any rules or limitations, the ends justify ANY means no matter how shocking. Jihad can be any action which advances Islam or weakens the Kaffirs, whether by a group or an individual. Even donating money to pay for someone else’s Jihad is a type of Jihad itself.\n3. ALWAYS play the victim. Mohammed twisted his situation around. Although he had attacked innocent people without provocation he blamed them because they had “stopped others from becoming Muslims” and had worshiped idols. The attack was their fault, and the Muslims were the victims, not the Kaffirs.\n4. Keep repeating this over and over and people will eventually begin to believe it. If you can persuade the victim to accept the blame you have won, because retaliation requires a sense of injustice. If the victim accepts the blame they will turn their hatred towards themselves.\n5. Inspire your followers to fanatical suicidal bravery.\n6. Deceive and sow discord amongst your enemies (the Kaffirs) whenever possible in order to secure victory.\n7. Never ever give up, even when you are being beaten.\n8. Never ever allow criticism of Mohammed, Allah or Islam - destroy free speech.\n\n[Source](https://thestoryofmohammed.blogspot.com/2013/09/chapter-twenty-seven-more-suicidal-jihad.html)'<br />Author: 'chaturthyam'<br />id: 'f37rdd'<br />Flair :Jihad</li>

So I wanted to share an incident/situation I faced recently which got me thinking. Basically I have a mustache as most teens my age do, you know that weird stupid looking shit. I hate it and I felt like I was looking like an uncle so I decided to shave it off completely and that seriously messed up everything at school for me like I actually got fucking bullied for that. Its not like I was an unpopular kid, people knew me, I had friends, it wasn\'t like I got bullied regularly before but then boys and girls started commenting on how I looked like a \'Hinjda\', \'Chakka\', Transgender etc. and the worst part was my math teacher embarrassed me in front of the whole class by saying I look like the male version of another girl in the glass. He also called me a \'Hinjda\' multiple times. I\'m already skinny and I get told a lot that I should eat more and I sometimes get pushed around but that was fine as I could handle that. But this. This was at a whole other level. I skipped school by making excuses just so I could avoid people. And this whole incident really got me thinking how the people of India (not everyone) are just so fucking toxic. Like why do people have a problem with everything? Its my mustache and I absolutely fucking hate it but no I can\'t cut it anymore because I get bullied if I do so. People here are extremely transphobic too which really pissed me off because why can\'t you just accept someone for who they are? People of India really have problems (again not saying everyone) Like the Indian society is extremely transphobic, sexist and even racist. Its filled with toxicity and people just can\'t let other people be themselves. That\'s why I decided I wanted to leave India possibly after 12th for higher studies, made a post asking for some info on Reddit and sure enough one of the comments said, "Desh drohi" which again comes to why the fuck do you care if I leave the country or not? Its literally a sub-reddit for people looking to study abroad. Why are you even here if you have a problem against that? I\'m not afraid to admit that I don\'t like India anymore. I wanna settle abroad in a country where people have a good mindset. I just can\'t stand this toxic shit hole anymore where I can\'t find like minded individuals who have the same thoughts as me. Anyways just wanted to get this off my mind before my 10th boards start in a few days. What are your thoughts regarding this? Thanks for reading. Sorry for the long post!

Tell them of the many great kings and warriors and their glorious lores, the men and women alike that this soil had produced. History is to be understood and not just read.

It extends to the division of the occupied land into Dar-ul-Islam and Dar-ul-Harb.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the occupation of India, they divided this land into Dar ul Islam (Pakistan) and Dar ul Harb (India).

<li>Title: 'How Kedarnath (2018) Movie is Biased against Hindus and Hinduism. [Long Post]'<br />Body: 'Some people asked my share my breakdown of movies which are biased against the Hindus and portrays them as evil hatemongers.\n\nSo here is the Breakdown of [Kedarnath (2018)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7027278/) by the Director [Abhishek Kapoor](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0438461/?ref_=tt_ov_dr).\n\nHere Goes :  \n\n\n**Mansoor Khan** a Muslim (Sushant Singh Rajput) is a pithu (*people who carry pilgrims on their back or on horses/mules*)  \n**Mukku** a Hindu (Sara Ali Khan) is the daughter of one of the most powerful Pandit of the region.  \n\n\n* At 4:00\n\n**\\*\\*Mansoor walks up to a pilgrim (Hindu Elderly woman, Dadi)\\*\\***\n\nDadi warns her son : "Are koi pooja paath waala bhi to le jaave hme, iske saath hm nahi jaayenge"  \n(*Dadi is shown as a radical Hindu woman who is biased against Muslims*)\n\nMansoor : "Par dadi ghoda na to aarti padhta hai na hi quran."  \n*(Even from the very first scene Mansoor is shown as a tolerant muslim)*  \n\n\n* At 5:15\n\nDadi prays before continuing on the journey : "Jai Shiv Shambho"\n\nMansoor repeats : "Jai Shiv Shambho"  \n*(I have never seen a Muslim, who can utter these words happily at their own behest, they are gradually planting the seed inside our brain, about how tolerant muslim people are, even when they are insulted based on their religion they swallow their pride and ego)*  \n\n\n* At 8:00\n\n\\*\\*Mansoor steals laddoos from his mother\'s shop and offers them to dadi. She refuses to take them\\*\\*\n\nMansoor : "paise nahi lenge aapse"\n\n\\*\\*she then accepts the laddoos\\*\\*\n\nDadi : "muft me koi meharbaan nahi hota, is laddoo ke badle najane konsi jaayedaad maang lo"  \n*(she is shown as a skeptic, and it also show that generous people are very rare to find, and Mansoor is among those few)*\n\n\\*\\*Mansoor\'s mother comes back to her shop and sees him offering sweets to the pilgrims\\*\\*\n\nMansoor\'s Mother :"meharbani karke kuch kma ke le aana, saara kuch yaatrio pe mat luta ke aa jaana"  \n*(implying that Mansoor is an overly generous person who cares more about pilgrims then about money)*  \n\n\n* At 9:50\n\n\\*\\*Dadi comes out of the temple after Darshan, Mansoor come back to her and even goes as far as touching her feet\\*\\*\n\nMansoor : " Dadi, darshan hue?"\n\nDadi : "ha bahot acche, hamesha khus rho"\n\n\\*\\*Mansoor clicks a selfie with Dadi and her family\\*\\*  \n*(implying he love the pilgrims and also forms a deep connection with them. Clicks a selfie as a memento)*  \n\n\n* At 11:20\n\n*(Naga Sadhu is shown as a joke like they are always portrayed in every movie. He chants Shiva\'s name and shown doing stuff that doesn\'t make any sense to any normal person. Which makes you believe that they are lunatic. Almost always Sadhus are portrayed like this in movies.)*  \n\n\n* At 11:55\n\n\\*\\*Mukku is shown praying to Shiva for a cricket match b/w India and Pakistan, she burst at her uncle and warns him not to sit inside the shop\\*\\*\n\nMukku : "kaka aap fir gaddi (a small bed) pe baith gye, aapse kha haina ki aap jab wha baithte hain to ye bhoot (pakistani batsman) aur maarta hai.  \n*(mildly implying how Hindus are superstitious. Whereas Mansoor is shown as a practical person, there\'s a scene where Mansoor doesn\'t look towards the TV while the cricket match was on, which might give you an impression that he\'s also a superstitious person, But later they reveal that after his father died he stopped watching cricket on TV and now only listened to the commentary(audio) on TV or radio.)*  \n\n\n* At 16:00\n\n\\*\\*Mukku is watching cricket at a tea shop along with a lot of people. Mansoor is there too. India needs 6 runs on last ball to win, Mukku gets angry and starts to leave the shop\\*\\*\n\nMukku : "India ko haarte hue nahi dekhungi mai"\n\nMansoor : "aakhri ball pe 6 bhi to lag sakta hai"\n\nMukku : "aaj Shiv Ji mood me nahi hai, out ho jaayega ye (indian batsman), apne allah se hi maang lo"\n\n\\*\\*There\'s a picture of Shiva on the wall in front of Mansoor, he looks at the picture and says\\*\\*\n\nMansoor : "Hey upar waale bachalo" \\*\\*although he joins his hands like muslims do for namaz\\*\\**(Muslims usually utter Allah\'s name with every small thing, and that\'s a good thing but here intentionally he looks at Shiva and says "hey upar waale" while joining his hands for namaz, which show how a muslim can be so open minded that he believes in a Hindu god but at the same time making the namaz hand sign shows that he very much believes in Allah too. They could have simply shown him saying "hey upar waale bachalo" and not make the Namaz hand sign or instead could have joined his hands for namaste, but that would have implied that he believes more in Shiva than in Allah, which would have given the wrong message to the viewers that a muslim person believes in Shiva more than he believes in Allah, and this could have disparaged the image of Allah)*  \n\n\n* At 17:50\n\n\\*\\*Kullu (played by Nishant Dhaiya) is shown as a kattar Hindu.\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*Mansoor is clicking a selfie with the  a toursits\' group when Kullu approaches him and talks to him in an annoyed tone\\*\\*\n\nMansoor : " kitni baar kha hai ki sawari udhar hi utar jaati hai, nahi to dhabe tak be le aao to chlega"\n\nMansoor : "nahi, yatriyon ko to hm 2 km piche hi chodd sakte hain, yha to hm apne liye aate hain, shukrana krne"  \n*(Mansoor is shown as a person who comes to the Hindu Temple to pay respects to Shiva, as Shiva is the reason Mansoor can earn his livelihood, while hindus are shown as consumed by greed who even after being a lot more affluent than Muslims there want to earn even more)*\n\nKullu : "to aur bhi to jagah hai na tum logo ki shukrana krne ke"  \n*(see how kullu is shown as an overly possessive Hindu who doesn\'t like that a Muslim is visiting the Temple)*  \n\n\n* At 19:50\n\n\\*\\*Mukku is travelling to rambara on mansoor\'s horse, and stops at a place to steal a signboard from a wall\\*\\*\n\nMukku : "kaise mard ho? aurat ki madad ka rivaz nahi hai tumhare yha?"  \n*(showing the prejudice of Hindus towards other religion. This can be seen throughout the movie)*\n\nMansoor : "Ji hamari ammi hme chori karna nahi sikhati"  \n*(implying that hindu mothers may encourage their children to steal but Muslims are only taught the best values a human should have)*  \n\n\n* At 21:00\n\n\\*\\*In this scene Mukku\'s father is shown as a cruel conservative father who has fixed her marriage with kullu without her consent\\*\\*  \n*(If a person doesn\'t need something keep showing them that thing incessantly and eventually they\'ll start craving that thing even though they don\'t really need it, or it may not be good for them at all. This is how advertising works. Supermarkets are an ideal example for this.*   \n*This is what Bollywood has been showing in Indian cinema for ages :*  \n*1. A Hindu father pressurize the daughter to marry a man of his choice.*  \n*2. The girl disagrees, she elopes with someone else.*  \n*3. Father then tries to kill the daughter or sever all ties with her and disowns her.*  \n*They have systematically planted this idea that arranged marriage is the cruelest thing in the world, and you should marry the person of your choice by first knowing him, doing stuff and shit. I am not at all against Love marriages, but showing that arrange marriages are bad in every case, no matter the situation isn\'t the way to go. It only creates a false narrative in the minds of youngsters, which eventually comes out in really UGLY WAYS)*  \n\n\n* At 23:00\n\n\\*\\*Watch the barrage of praises and admiration in the conversation b/w Mansoor and his mother. how great they are, how they respect Shiva, how his father respected Shiva and he used to call the valley a "Jannat" etc.\\*\\*  \n *(This seems like a good thing, that a certain religion can love and respect other religions too but why go the extra mile and show that the Hindus can\'t do the same and are filled with hatred towards Muslims. It\'s a blatant abuse of power that cinemas have over young minds.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* At 31:00\n\n\\*\\*Mansoor is portrayed as an innocent guy who minds his own business while Mukku keeps hitting on him.\\*\\*  \n\n\n* At 34:00\n\n\\*\\*A pilgrim forgets their cellphone on Mansoor\'s horse, so he goes on foot to return it which would probably take him 4 hours.\\*\\*  \n*(They are slowly building up his character as generous, humble person, while doing the complete opposite for the Hindus of the Valley)*  \n\n\n* At 35:00\n\n\\*\\*Mansoor is shown feeding his mother, while Mukku is always shown treating her parents as shit.\\*\\*  \n*(Like I said earlier, He\'s a good person, while Mukku rebels against her parents and talks very disrespectfully, which is in trend these days with youngsters because apparently that\'s all the cool kids do. We have the cinema to thanks for that.)*  \n\n\n* At 37:55\n\n\\*\\*Mansoor is shown saying his prayers (namaz) with complete obedience while just a minute ago Mukku in the Kedarnath temple was shown flirting with Mansoor while every other hindu there was aesthetically singing and praying.\\*\\*  \n*(Mansoor is genuinely respectful towards his rituals &amp; prayers and does them at his own behest. No one forces him. But for Mukku these things are just like any other household chores. In reality Muslim kids are forced to go to Masjid and hindus never forces their children to be engaged in Prayers and Rituals.)*  \n\n\n* At 45:20 *(This scene is the most disgusting for me)*\n\n\\*\\*both Hindu and Muslims communities are present and Kullu is addressing them as he\'s one of the powerful people among the Temple Trust members\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*Kullu is shown addressing Muslims as "tum" while they address Kullu as "Aap"\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*Kullu speaks about getting the permit to cater for the increasing number of pilgrims in the valley, for which he asks both the hindu and muslim communities to give up 4-5 shops each.\\*\\*\n\nMansoor : "Lekin vaadi ka bhi to dhyaan rakhna hai, permit nahi milta kyonki vaadi seh nahi paayegi, wo fatt jaayegi"  \n*(showing he knew all along what was gonna happen, and that he cared much more about the valley than the Hindus. Hindus are even shown praising Kullu\'s plan, they are shown as petty materialists)*\n\nKullu : "Naam kya btaya tumne apna?"\n\nMansoor : "Mansoor"\n\nKullu : "Mansoor!!! Tum shraddha (devotion) nahi samjhoge, seva ka bhav nahi samjhoge, yaatri yha aate hain apne bhagwaan se milne, aur unki suvidha hmara dharm hai, par ye tumhe kaise pta hoga?"  \n*(See how Kullu is shown as a kattar Hindu, why just simply hates every Muslim)*\n\n\\*\\*Then every Hindu is shown supporting Kullu\'s idea and discarding Mansoor\'s cautious views.\\*\\*\n\nOne of the Hindus says "Yatra aur vyapar sab saath me chalta hai"\n\n\\*\\*But, Muslims side with Mansoor.\\*\\*\n\nOne of the Muslims say : "Teerth ka vyapar hai ye, aur jis vaadi me bhagwan baithe hain agar uski kadr (respect) nahi hui to kha jaake baithenge wo?"\n\n\\*\\*Mansoor suggest about rationing and allowing only limited pilgrims to visit every year.\\*\\*\n\nKullu rants : "hmara jab mn krege hm darshan krne chle aayenge, aur jitne bhi aayenge unki vyavastha krenge hm, aur TUM KHA SE AA GYE HMARE BEECH"\n\nMansoor : "Beech me? Hm to hmesha se yha hain, Aapke saath. Beech me kha se aa gye? Amarnath ki gufa pehli baar buta Malik ko dikhi thi, aaj bhi unke ghar me chadawa jaata hai har saal, pushte hmari seva karti aayi hain, shraddha me hm unki shaamil hue hain, kandho pe baitha kar teerth karaya hai, Om Namah Shivay ke hullare lgaye hain, yaatrio ke antim waqt me kaano me jaake shiv ka naam phooka hai, hme kaise bahar nikaalenge? teerth hmari rago me hai kullu ji, aur ye baat hmare aapki nahi hai, ye pure kedarnath ki hai."  \n*(Any person, no matter where they are from would instantly jump to the conclusion that Hindus are the most evil people and hate every other religion, although Muslims are the MVP of the society, despite Shiva not being their god they worship him with much more devotion than Hindus. Hindus are only in the "Business" of God while Muslims are in it for "Devotion")*  \n\n\n* At 55:00\n\n\\*\\*Mukku\'s sister Brinda tracks down Mansoor and tells his that Mukku has multiple lovers and every month someone comes down to their house asking for marriage. And for this month Mukku is using Mansoor.\\*\\*\n\nBrinda to Mansoor : "Pandito ki beti hai wo!!" *(implying how pandits consider themselves the elites of the society while muslims are some lowly people for them)*\n\n\\*\\*Mansoor stops talking to Mukku because he feels betrayed, then 10 mins of fight b/w lovers, not talking etc,  \nLong story short, Mukku gets drenched in the rain waiting outside Mansoor\'s house and ends up staying at his house despite Mansoor\'s mother\'s reluctance, while Kullu and Mukku\'s father along with a few more people tracks her down. Other muslim pithu\'s very peacefully and respectfully tries to stop them along the way and asks them to calm down, but Kullu threatens to move all the pithu\'s from the Village.\\*\\*  \n*(classic way to portray brahmins/hindus in Indian Cinema, as being egoists, radical, and violent)*\n\n\\*\\*Then Mukku\'s father slaps her in front of everyone\\*\\*  \n*(again this is how bollywood portrays hindus in almost every story where a girl is a hindu and loves a guy from another caste/religion)*\n\n\\*\\*Mukku\'s father (in a very inhumane way) makes her take a bath in the cold water of the river to in order to wash herself of the sin she just commited by staying at a muslim\'s house for a few hours\\*\\*  \n*(shows how much hindus hate other religions and it\'s a sin for them to marry people of other caste/religion)*\n\n*(At this point it\'s shown that the river starts to ascend, but the previous scene where Kullu talks about getting the permit for making additional reservations for the increasing pilgrims makes the audience believe that this is the wrath of god against the greed of Hindus, while muslims all along tried to prevent this very plight)*  \n\n\n* At 1:10:00\n\n\\*\\*Mansoor comes to Mukku\'s house asking her father for forgiveness, instead he smacks him and kullu and his friends beats him up senselessly, Mansoor\'s friend comes and saves him by begging at Kullu\'s feet for forgiveness, they leave Mansoor half-dead\\*\\*  \n*(slowly and steadily showing the more and more violent side of Hindus)*  \n\n\n* At 1:13:00\n\n\\*\\*Mukku\'s father tells her that she\'s to be married the very next day with Kullu. She refuses\\*\\*\n\nMukku : "Mansoor se shaadi krenge hm..."\n\nMukku\'s Father : "Nahi hoga ye sangam, fir chahe pralay hi kyu na aa jaaye"  \n*(Just wanted to point this out, see how they are slowly trying to put all the blame on Mukku family (and other greedy Hindus) for the Kedarnath floods! In reality they are trying to say that the floods happened due the greed of Hindus of Kedarnath. Ask anyone who comes out of the theater after watching this movie, they\'ll surely have this misconception in their minds that "it was due to the greed of Hindus that Bholenaath wreaked havoc upon us.")*\n\n*(Also this is the final stage of a typical bollywood love story of a Hindu girl where the father either tries to marry the girl to another person or disowns her or tries to kill her. Yes this is what bollywood has planted in the minds of billions of people around the world, that Hindus are the evilest people on the face of the planet, who cares more about their pride then their daughters, whereas In reality truth cannot be farther from this, Womens (be it, mother, daughter, wife or any other women) are worshiped as goddesses in Hinduism, is there any female goddess or prophet in Islam?)*\n\nMukku\'s Father : "Kal shubha 8 baje mahurat, 9 bje bidai, uske baad ye mahus shakal mujhe kabhi mat dikhana"  \n*(proving my point)*  \n\n\n* At 1:16:00\n\n\\*\\*Mansoor\'s Mother decides to leave their home. Meanwhile Mukku cuts her wrists with a razorblade. Kullu and his friends consumed with rage starts beating up muslims, and Mansoor comes to stop them\\*\\*\n\nKullu to Mansoor : "Tujhe aur tere bhagwaan dono ko nahi rhne denge yha pe"  \n*(What the actual f\\*\\*k? Can you stoop any lower than this Bollywood? This what Muslims do to hindus, take Kashmir Exodus for an example and countless other places around the world. See how Pakistani Hindus are raped and murdered. In movies they have completely reversed the roles of Hindus and Muslims from real life.)*  \n\n\n* At 1:26:00\n\n\\*\\*flood water starts ascending and pithu\'s are leaving the place to go atop the mountain for safety. Mansoor takes his mother to a safe cabin on the hill, and tries to leave to get to Mukku\\*\\*\n\nMansoor\'s Mother : "Nahi Mansoor tu kisi ko nahi bacha sakta"\n\nMansoor : "Ammi is baar nahi jaane diya to mai maar jaaunga ammi"  \n*(at this point it\'s almost certain death if someone goes to the valley but still he decides to go there and tries to save people. Good virtuous Muslim Man)*  \n\n\n* At 1:29:30\n\n*(It\'s worth stating that mansoor\'s father is shown to have died because some kid was crying for his shoe which had fallen from the mountainside, he decides to help that kid and goes on to bring the shoe back, but unfortunately meets his demise)*\n\n\\*\\*Everyone gathers inside the Temple, as it\'s the only safe place left there which is still intact. Mansoor manages to get to the temple. After the flood becomes less intense, Mansoor pulls everyone alive in the Temple to the terrace of a house which is nearby, a helicopter is supposed to rescue them from there. Helicopter overloads, two people are still on the roof but only one can be rescued. Mansoor was supposed to go up but the other person is a father, his son yells from above, upon seeing the son crying, Mansoor decide to let the other man go and he himself stays behind. And dies in the flood\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# TL;DR\n\nSo the essence of the movies boils down to this :\n\n1. Hindus are evil, radical, egoist, coward, greedy, hatemonger, muslim hating people who hates other peoples\' religion and would even go as far as killing or ruing their children\'s lives for the sake of pride.\n\n2. Muslims are open minded, Hindu loving, brave, calm, peace loving, sajjan people who puts other peoples\' wishes and comfort before their own. Don\'t mind dying even for some greedy Hindus and uphold the best of moral standards. Basically they are the Backbone of the Society.\n\n3. Kedarnath flood was the consequence of the materialism and greed of Hindus, while Muslim people always only tried to stop this tragedy by staying true to their duty of serving &amp; helping the pilgrims. Even resisting the evil plans of Hindus like getting the permit to build better hotels.\n\n4. Throughout the movie Hindus are shown only caring about the "Business" aspect of Kedarnath and Muslims are shown only doing the service of the pilgrims and Shiva.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Views :\n\nEven though the movie could have been a marvelous piece of art, the writers destroyed it completely trying to push their propaganda.\n\nLove story was completely unnecessary. And instead of blaming hindus for something that you can\'t ever comprehend and possibly blame anyone for, try to write a good script.  \n\n\n#  जय श्री राम'<br />Author: 'maha_kaal'<br />id: 'f1b2mv'<br />Flair :Research</li>

<li>Title: 'Two ways we can end the bs around us for good....'<br />Body: 'Now both of them are crazy and might appear stupid but I think it is the best for whats happening now:\n\n1) We need a conservative leader who can unite all people from all countries together against liberalism. If the conservatives are not united lile liberals, we won\'t acheve any s*it. Look closely, whats hapenning around us (and aroumd every countries) is the almost the same thing.  Minority appeasement, letting Jihadis in as friends and trying to brainwash people in loving them morenthan their religion, deframing all major religions etc. If conservatives sort out their differences and unite then liberals won\'t stand a chance. We just need to make people believe that saying saying whats true for Mullas, immogramts, LGBTQ hypocrites will not make a Nazi, Islamophobe or a Fascist. If we don\'t sort out the problems first, finding a solution will be impossible for us. Think about this, both Nazis and Japaneese had several good people too. They knew what was going on, some turned agaimst their ideals but some still remained quiet. Mullas and libtards also have several good people who changed their ideals and some who know their idelas are s*it but still follow them because of fear. But did we blink even once before making Nazis, Fascists or the Japaneese of WW2 our worst enemies? Did you hear FDR sayimg "What Japaneese did to us was bad but we should not do anything against them, and let them attack us indirectly even more because not everyone in Japan os lilke that" anywhere durimg WW2? US kicked Japaneese ass and even threw nukes twice without any second thoughts. Same thing happened with the Nazos and Fascists. No ome ever tried to sugercoat or change the truth from what they were doing because of a few good men and women. We do repect them now, and we will respect them forever but that doesn\'t mean we will respect their ideology. So Abdul Kalam or A R Rahaman sould not prevent you from saying that it is a s*it religion. But isn\'t our religion s*it too in mamy aspects? Yes it is. Infact every religion or ideology is shit in many apects too. All have their weaknesses. But we and also Christianity amd many other religions have understood our mostakes and are trying hard to rectify them. (I do not hate any ST/SC or OBC because they were treated unfairly for many generations by upper castes). But we and even the Christians have publicly acknowledged that we are not perfect. But they haven\'t. Keep this in mind. I will come back to it later. So the goal of the conservatoves will just be to bring back freedom of speech and remove the concept that "liberalism is always correct". Trust me conservatives aren\'t always correct either but now our main problem is the liberals and the Radicals. Once that is established, the fight will be almost over. One of the most important reasons why we cannot speak against them is that we will be labeled as the "bad guy" if we dare speak against liberalism. So that is one way to win. Now coming to the second one\n\n2) One of my Muslim friends who really hates his religion told me that the only way to destroy this religion is to attack them from the inside. 95% of them are ridiculously hardcore believers who can go to any extent to preserve their religions. You can apply logic to explain why their religion is wrong, you can tell UN to ban them or you can also tell them what they tell the most to Kafirs, "Convert or Die" but they won\'t listen to you. Uighurs of China has faced such a ridiculous amount of oppression and ot would all and if they would just give up their religion, same thing happened with Rohingyas and even incase of Shias and Sunnis (Shias can convert to Sunnis but they won\'t) but they still dodn\'t leave their religion. So many Muslims die during terrorist strikes done by their own groups but still they don\'t convert. Why? Is it only because of fear of dying? Nope. The thing is these people are brainwashed from their childhood into thinking that their religion is always correct. Everyone who tells otherwise are disbelievers and hence their opinions should not matter. See the posts from exmuslim subreddit. They have many posts where the people are feeling tok afraid to convert because they are afraid of eternal hell and torture. Even in this era and having so much of education, they think like this. If that isn\'t a reason why they are so brainwashed then I don\'t know what is. Now you always joke that most of them are inbred, retarded etc. I really agree to you but unfortunately they are winning. And why? Because majority of them are brainwashed to their beliefs too much. They will always increase their poplulation, have a discontent towards Kaafirs, destroy Kaafirs along with their civilization when they become the majority  and repeat this process for another region. This doesn\'t require much IQ and brainpower. If they die then they will simply have another one to xarry out the mission. \n(Doesn\'t this sound like the lifestyle of a virus?)\nNow lets focus on what to do...\nLike I said before, Islam has neber accepted criticism and reform of any sort before. If anyone tries to reform them, they will either get killed or no one will listen to them. This is our chance. Infiltrate the religion in droves. Convert and convert until there are no Kaafirs left. I know it sounds crazy but hear me out. So entering their religion will give us major advantages. Firstly since there will be no Kaafirs or too less of them so these folks will get lazy. They won\'t do their daily terrorism activitites and will not bw that much hardcore followers. Now the people will openly start protesting against their own religion. Years of laziless and lack of competition will take them out completely by surprise. Since their is no more thing to do, some of them will actually become liberals. (Liberalism increases during peacetimes)  They will not be able to do anything much against us. Now ban them, declare war against them and make them a piece of history. Give them what they want amd them take everything away. You will think that its stupid but trust me it isn\'t. Christians were just like that before but years of reforms made them who they are now. But this religions kicked out all these reforms. We are yet to have any Muslims who had openly defied his religion in the face of the world. So they haven\'t changed their medieval mindset at all. This will be our advantage.. We will use the wave of liberalism and logic to openly deframe them. They will be the most hated religion in history. But Hinduism will probably die if we do that, right? Yes. But also understand that the world is slowly moving away from religions. Spirituality perhaps will always stay but religioms will go away. Islam is actually using this weakness and lack of love and respect to gain their ground. So whayever we do, we cannot stop the decay of our religion. But if we go out lile that, then people will praise us in the history books of the future, for being the force to defeat the most hated religion on earth. Perhaps they won\'t follow our religion but it will be preserved perfectly. \n\nThis is a very long post that took 1 hour to complete.

Amazon who is short of qualified manpower who cannot recognise the swapped parts just re-sells them as “renewed” or “open box”. There has to be a way to track such fraudsters and hand them over to the police. Mere banning won’t work as they will simply create another ID.
