I\'m not a super practicing hindu, i go to holy sites rarely, and hardly i\'ve read religious scriptures.\nBut i wanted to let out my personal opinion on certain topics non-hindus use to brainwash hindu youngsters in order to brain waah them into self hatered.\n1. "If mohommad was a pedophile(he was 6 when he married aisha and did s€x with her when she was 9, his age was 54), then so was Lord राम as he married godess sita when she was 7".\nSo, yes, godess was underage at the time of marriage, but so was lord राम! He was 12 or something, after 14 years of vanvaas, lord lav and kush were born. So according to current era, things were legal. \nYou know even today in India, many families do certain marrige ceremony which is considered to be partial marriage/marriage, after marriage the bride gets to remain with her actual parents, and is sent to her inlaws only when she\'s an adult. \n2. " hinduism has awkward polygamy ". (anyways, the most perfect prophet had 11 wives with whom he\'d have sex on a single night but bath only once, +he had numerous underage sex slaves as well). \nSo., afaik we do not worship pandavas, they ended up in hell, it was taboo back then too, and they were bound by the promise to their mother. Apart from that, they ended up in नर्क except for युधिष्ठिर. \n3. Godess सीता had to give the "purity" test. \nI have herd various things on this matter, but, as an apologetic i\'d say, who sits in the throne, MATTERS, the prince MUST be blood heir to the king. Nature\'s rule. So pressure by the citizens of अयोध्या to lord राम for godess सीता was VALID imo. \n I\'d say, lord राम took extreme decisions in his life, but they were perfect. You must know when you have to choose your family, and when you have to choose the प्रजा, and HE DID, wo we worship him. \nIn the future i\'ll post some Quran texts as well, because you have to know them, as the one pointing fingers at you, has to be clean himself, and peacefuls "aren\'t" clean. \nSpread awareness, धन्यावाद!'<br />Author: 'queueue_ueueue'<br />id: 'j1aez8'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'This is IMPORTANT.

Your money is weight by supply and demand.  \n\nThink of tax as a way to remove money from a country. You pay tax to make money keep its current value.  \nThink of it as this way. Tax is a way to remove money from the system to keep inflation in check. The more Hands money goes though, the less valuable it becomes. When the same amount of money gets used by more people it artificially increases its quantity.  \nThis is why Tax is imposed on every goods thus whenever money is transferred from one hand to other its quantity decreases to keep up with its increase in use.  \n  \nQuite a head cracker.  \nlet me explain in the most layman terms.  \nSuppose a pack of lays cost **Rs 10 when the total amount of money in India is Rs100 and population of India is 6**.  \n\n1. Case 1 if no tax is levied.  \nlet's say that Government prints Rs 100 this year so the net amount of money is Rs200.  \nAnd the transfer of money is.  \nA(200)-&gt;B(200)-&gt;C(200)-&gt;D(200)-&gt;E(200)-&gt;F(200).  \n**Total usefulness is Rs 1200 and thus the price of lays next year would be Rs120**.    \n\n  \n2. Case 2 if a Rs 25 tax is imposed on every sale  \nA(200)-&gt;B(175)-&gt;C(150)-&gt;D(125)-&gt;E(100)-&gt;F(75).  \n**Total usefulness is Rs 825 and thus the price of lays next year would be Rs 82.5**.    \n\n  \n1. Case 3 if a Rs 25 tax is imposed and the population in India is increased 8.  \nA(200)-&gt;B(175)-&gt;C(150)-&gt;D(125)-&gt;E(100)-&gt;F(75)-&gt;G(50)-&gt;H(25).  \n**Total usefulness is Rs 900 and thus the price of lays next year would be Rs 90**.  \n\n\n1. Case 4 if a Rs 25 tax is imposed and people save Rs 25 in the bank, while the population of India is increased to 8.  \nA(200)-&gt;B(150)-&gt;C(100)-&gt;D(50)-&gt;E(0)-&gt;F(-50)-&gt;G(-100)-&gt;H(-150).   \n**Total Usefulness is Rs 200 and thus the price of Lays will remain Rs 10 next year** . Negative money is loans.    \n\n\n1.   Case 5 if a Rs 50 tax is imposed, while the population of India is increased to 8.  \nA(200)-&gt;B(150)-&gt;C(100)-&gt;D(50)-&gt;E(0)-&gt;F(-50)-&gt;G(-100)-&gt;H(-150).   \n**Total Usefulness is Rs 200 and thus the price of Lays will remain Rs 10 next year** . Negative money is loans. This is exactly why saving money gives you a discount on taxes.    \n\n\nHope you can get it now. Not having tax blooms inflation, having slight tax reduces it, Having a population increases cause inflation.  \nThus the government can either ask people to save money in a deposit or Increase tax to reduce money and keep the inflation in check.  \nI do not think I can simplify it more.  Government Does not use tax money to fund the budget. It prints as much money as needed and then has to find a way to remove it.  \nGovernment is printing money to take care of corona and stimulate the economy. They have to Increase tax and savings to get this money to remove before the inflation kicks in. \n\nYes, the government does not need your money to do works. It is the opposite, they give money so that you can work.  \n  \nWelcome to the 21st. \nI got a migraine."<br />Author: 'Rakesh1995'<br />id: 'j0v5zl'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li><li>Title: 'Hindus ate cow in ancient Bharat, Brahmans used to sacrifice cow or beef when a guest arrived in their house.'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'AliensExistOnEarth'<br />id: 'j0txms'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li><li>Title: 'I convinced my Pakistani bf that Islam is illogical.'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'carameldesi'<br />id: 'j0tulc'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li><li>Title: 'मैं गरीब हूँ'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'miss_salty1233'<br />id: 'j0t21r'<br />Flair ::shit: Shitpost</li><li>Title: 'which car is this ?'<br />Body: 'I think its BMW but which model ?\n\n[https://youtu.be/5hT4UFmja5w](https://youtu.be/5hT4UFmja5w?list=RDMM5hT4UFmja5w)'<br />Author: 'me_lucky_lips'<br />id: 'j0sszn'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'Please fill this form for assignment perpous'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'alphaQ_42069'<br />id: 'j0qxyb'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li><li>Title: "Help needed - I'm a bookworm struggling to find non-fiction Hindi books"<br />Body: "I want to write about study and college skills in Hindi so that rural kids can benefit from this especially those new to online classes.

My father took me to that place when I was literally 8! Child labour basically.\n\nFirst mistake, I met Ram Kumar Ramamurthy, CEO of Gemini Communications Ltd. He was a LITERAL sanghi. Why? Because he had a pretty high position in this "RSS" thingy. He also donated money to establish a paatashaala (or gurukul) that forced innocent children to leave their education and to read age-old irrelevant texts like the Vedas. He forced me too to leave my non-vegetarian diet and now I am really sad because I can\'t convert back to the original. \n\nI met a HUGE group of bhakts, sanghis, Nazis, and islamophobic terrorists with sole purpose of uniting Indians. What a narrow-minded thought! What about Pakistanis? What about antarticans? And what about people from Jupiter? Can\'t they deserve to be unified? When will they realize that internationalism &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nationalism? Ok, coming to the actual point, let us see what they do in RSS. \n\nFirst - Prarthana. I don\'t think I have to say much, what can you say about the fact that an idiotic organization assumes everyone and everything to be theist and more importantly, "Hindu"? NOTHING.\n\nSecond - Games. First I thought their games will something like Running and catching where the runners would be labelled as Muslims and Catchers as Hindus, I was relieved THAT kind of cringe didn\'t happen. What happened was even more cringe - Mandala Kho-Kho. The same old stuff we did in school days, somehow they managed to make it even more boring! \n\nThird - rules and responsibilities. It would go like "Anand Ji, your thing for the week is to distribute CDs of Bharat Mata songs in the nearby streets. XYZ Ji, your job is to give some vegetarian food to the other streets". I slept off because I don\'t want to hear all NGO stuff. What matters to me is how beautifully they have managed to build a right-wing echo-chamber, shutting down all other thoughts that goes against their narrative and propaganda.\n\nAnd the saddest part of that? I came to know the name of the organization (RSS) only after coming to my house. I remember that day my liberal mom had a fight with my dad because he took me to RSS.

Only the middleman is at profit. \n\nThe middleman here refers to agents of APMCs, who collect all the commissions. \n\n\nAlso, when a farmer sells his produce to the APMC Mandis, there is NO immediate payment. Rather, he has to wait for a couple of days before the amount gets credited to his account. \n\nThis means - a lag in payment and liquidity.\n\nAPMCs play a dual role of “regulator” and a “controlled market”. \n\nMost of the states even impose restrictions on the interstate selling and procurement of agricultural produce. Hence, barring market integration.\n\n\n**What are the "controversial" bills introduced to tackle this?**\n\nThe three bills introduced that are all set to bring a sea change in this sector are - \n\n1) **The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020**- The act ends the monopoly of APMCs to exclusively procure from the farmers.\n\n\nIt however has NOT ENDED THE FARMER’s choice to keep selling to APMCs if he gets good return. \n\nFarmers will now have a CHOICE to sell in the open market or keep selling to APMCs. \n\nThis act provides a level playing field to all sellers, hence paving way for a free market.\n\n2) **The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020**-\n\nTo ensure a fair treatment to farmers outside APMCs, this bill provides for price assurance &amp; trade agreement during sale/ purchase of farm produce through a written agreement.\n\n\n\n3) **The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020**-\n\nTo ensure free market mechanism, this act will remove cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onions, and potatoes from the list of essential commodities to prevent regulation in production, distribution &amp; movement.\n\n\nHowever, the government is still authorised to regulate the supply &amp; distribution of these commodities during emergencies.\n\nAPMCs in major states have only served few political goons for decades. Introduction of free market in agriculture is definitely going to produce some friction, but it is beneficial in the long run.'<br />Author: 'Set1Less'<br />id: 'iwdaof'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'New Twitter Account About Sanatana Dharma'<br />Body: 'Hello Bhratas. \n\nI have opened a new Twitter Account about India, Sanatana Dharma and Indian Politics where I will be posting Hindu artwork and pics of Hindu Temples and also discussing Politics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFollow me if you are interested in that sort of content :-  [**https://twitter.com/DharmaPersona**](https://twitter.com/DharmaPersona)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDhanyavaad :)'<br />Author: '212134'<br />id: 'iwd83a'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'WTF Chinese troops crying on way to LAC'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'invankas_left_boob'<br />id: 'iwcajv'<br />Flair :Bakchod News :news:</li><li>Title: 'Government launched PMcarefund new site for donation please donate for the future of the country.'<br />Body: '[https://pmcares.fund/](https://pmcares.fund/)'<br />Author: 'Nefarious_lad'<br />id: 'iwbzjc'<br />Flair :Bakchod News :news:</li><li>Title: 'How do you like my Halloween 🎃🧟\u200d♀️ T shirt designs ?'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'lordlebu'<br />id: 'iwbt41'<br />Flair ::Twitter: From Twitter Meme</li><li>Title: 'www.pmcares.fund'<br />Body: "Go to [www.pmcares.fund](https://www.pmcares.fund) for latest news and updates about how the Modi Govt. has diligently and efficiently utilized the PM Cares fund for the fight against Covid-19!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm gonna spread this around in my family group chats lmao"<br />Author: 'gekko777'<br />id: 'iwbgsu'<br />Flair ::Whatsapp: WhatsApp Forward</li><li>Title: 'Just a question'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'sayato-sama'<br />id: 'iwaitu'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li><li>Title: "What exactly goes on in an Indian communist's mind?

Please tell me what to do next."<br />Body: " \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpelling will be horrible, not a native speaker, so please excuse that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo months ago my grandmother, who had been mentally unstable for a few months, died in our home. My mother is a general physician and as she had died in our arms, she saw clear signs of kidney failure that caused septisemia. Grandma had already been diagnosed and treated for a kidney infection 2 years prior. However due to personal reasons, we didn't get her tested for covid post-mortem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past few weeks, my mom and dad have been very sick. Mother's pulse has been rising suddenly for a few days now, reaching the 100-150 range. Dad has been suffering from diarrohea, and some sort of gastroentitis problem. Me and my dad have a slightly strained relationship so I'm not very sure of his problems. Whatever I know is what I could muster from my mother. I have heard them discussing about the gall bladder, a bladder stone and removing the gall bladder.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday my mom confided in me that she has been having pain in her lower back, near her kidneys, just like my grandmother did before she passed away. She had a urine culture test done, which she says indicates a possible kidney infection and indirectly told me that whatever happened to grandma could happen to her too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom's pulse reached 150 a few days ago and dad rushed her to the hospital, but it had already reduced to a normal level by the time they left home. However, her pulse still rises to 100 nearly every day since. She says she's not feeling alright, but is not able to put it in words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey have done a few tests,but I'm of the view that they haven't done enough. I am not able to bring myself to ask them about the results, as I'll explain why. They visited the hospital twice and always came back with a much better mood, but their problems once again start the next morning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realize I'm not very clear with explaining their ailments, but this is all I know at the moment. It is not easy to discuss this at home without one of us breaking down. Dad already has been on the verge of tears many times when he thought me and my younger brother weren't looking. I'm fearing for their life and literally have no idea what to do. With all that's happened this year, my anxiety is through the roof and I'm extremely tensed. If any, any of you out there who has experienced or known someone who experienced these health problems, please advice and suggest me what to do now. I am clueless and in constant fear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my panic, I posted this in each and every sub that I thought would be helpful. Dad and Mom are trying to be as optimistic in front of me as possible, but even their facade is cracking. I have no idea why I'm reaching out to strangers who read this, but please, please, please- If you can be of any help, please do. It would mean the world right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;DR- My parents are both quite sick, but they aren't able to convey about it to me and neither I am able to ask about it to them. I only know the following key terms. Dad- gall bladder, bladder stone, diarrohea, endoscopy and gastroentitis. Mom- suddenlr rising pulse(reaching 150), lower back pain that is caused by(as a urine culture test indicates) kidney infection."<br />Author: 'marvel_fanboy_4ever'<br />id: 'iupogt'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: "India, couldn't help but notice you included afghanistan in your map."<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Ok_Buy_2176'<br />id: 'iup2lg'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Butthurt OP</li><li>Title: 'Oh Noes 😭😭😭😭'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'iuorc0'<br />Flair ::star: OC है बे </li><li>Title: 'Modi is Father of India (post dynasty era)'<br />Body: 'Happy birthday Modiji.

Here is an ELI5 ⬇️'<br />Body: 'Link to Dr Li-Meng et al\'s research paper: https://zenodo.org/record/4028830#.X1_G1mhKg2z\n\n\n**Summary**: She alleges that there is no way a wild bat coronavirus could evolve or mutate into the human-infecting strain that appeared in late 2019 naturally. The paper brings up a number of possible scenarios that were proposed (direct mutation, intermediary infection, etc.) and shows how they are not feasible, at least in a manner that produced what we see today. Covid-19 appeared out of the gate perfectly formed to infect human cells, and there\'s no way to explain that other than genetic engineering.\n\n\n**The genomes for COVID-19 and the coronaviruses ZC45 and ZCX21 are very similar.**\n\n1. COVID-19 (technically named, SARS-CoV-2) is a coronavirus. If you look at the NCBI database that shows the gene sequences of other coronavirus, it closely matches two related coronaviruses known as ZC45 and ZXC21. (Those particular viruses also happened to be discovered by Chinese researches in 2015.)\n\n2. Other bat-type coronaviruses are similar to COVID-19, but they come in at about 89% identical over the entire genome. ZC45/ZCX21, however, are in the range of 94%-100% identical to COVID-19, depending on the section you\'re looking at.\n\n**Like really, really, unusually similar...**\n\n3. There are two particularly interesting gene sequences to look at in COVID-19 and ZC45 (and ZXC21). They are the sections that code for the Orf8 protein and E protein...\n\n4. Orf8 exists in other coronaviruses, but the sequence will vary a lot between different types. If you look at all other coronaviruses, their Orf8 sequences match COVID-19 with a 58% correspondence. However, ZC45 matches COVID-19\'s Orf18 with a 94.2% correspondence. This is weird, because all the other data suggest that Orf8 is a sequence that just plays loosey-goosey between strains, but here we have an unnaturally close identicality. It\'s like catching two students cheating on a test because their written answers are so similarly worded.\n\n5. As for the E protein sequence, it mutates relatively quickly, meaning you\'ll find genomic differences even between close generations of the same virus. However, they\'ve found some COVID-19 E protein sequences that have a 100% match with ZC45./ZXC21. To put that in perspective, no other coronavirus has been observed with a 100% match to either COVID-19 or ZC45/ZXC21.\n\n**There\'s this other "natural" virus that supposedly matches COVID-19, but it seems like a fabrication to lead people away from ZC45/ZXC21**\n\n6. The virus is called RaTG13. It\'s supposed to be a 96% match to COVID-19. The reason why they think this is bullshit is because RaTG13 is supposed to be found in horseshoe bats but third party researchers found out that the sequence as described probably can\'t actually infect horseshoe bats.\n\n\n**Ok, so COVID-19 and ZC45/ZXC21 are nearly identical. What does that prove?**\n\n7. Given their nearly identical nature, two possibilities exist. COVID-19 naturally evolved from ZC45/ZXC21 or ZX45/ZXC21 was used as a template for COVID-19. But which possibility is it? It can\'t be evolution because...\n\n8. There\'s a protein in all coronaviruses known as Spike proteins. Spike proteins allow coronaviruses to "spear" the host cell and infect it.\n\n9. If you compare Spike proteins between COVID-19 and ZC45/ZXC21, they are very similar as expected...BUT they differ in one very significant way. There\'s one section that helps give COVID-19 the ability to infect humans instead of bats. This one section "coincidentally" looks a lot like the same section of the virus that caused the 2003\'s SARS epidemic.\n\n10. This one section could not have evolved naturally because if it did, you would expect to see other "evolutionary" changes around that section and throughout the whole protein. Instead what you\'re seeing is almost like a copy-and-paste. One part of the protein closely matches the ZC45/ZXC21 virus and the other part closely matches the SARS virus. It\'s like a bad photoshop where someone neglected to use the smudge and blur tool.\n\n11. There is another possibility this not-matching section just popped in through a natural gene swap (like trading Pokemon cards)...which does happen occasionally with viruses. But in order for that to happen, the two trading viruses need to infect the same host at the same time. This is impossible because SARS infects humans but ZC45/ZXC21 only infects bats. Pokemon cards thus cannot be swapped because the otakus aren\'t even in the same house.\n\n12. A final nail in this Spike protein coffin is that if you look at the beginning and end of the not-matching sequence, you find short sequences that happen to be "restrictions sites" that are commonly used in genetic engineering. (A restriction site is a genomic sequence that is easily cut through and pasted into using genetic engineering techniques.) While it\'s possible that these sites could just randomly be there, it\'s more than extremely unlikely and very suspicious.\n\n13. One last thing about the COVID-19 Spike protein is that there\'s a thing in it called a "furin-cleavage site". It\'s a little complicated, but basically, furin-cleavage sites don\'t exist in the particular line of coronaviruses that COVID-19 is associated with, and the ones that do exist are about 60% different from the furin-cleavage site in COVID-19\'s Spike protein. Basically, it\'s like COVID-19\'s furin-cleavage site came out of nowhere.\n\nTake home message: ZC45/ZXC21 appears to be the template that COVID-19 was based on. One particular sequence in COVID-19 appears to be copy-and-pasted from the 2003 SARS virus. It\'s nearly statistically impossible and equally illogical that COVID-19 could just randomly evolve a genome that happens to look like a patchwork copy of other viruses.\n\n\nPlease read the paper when you have time, it is very informative. They actually delineate a possible workflow through which you could derive COVID-19 from ZC45/ZXC21. At that point, it\'s like rubbing it in everyone\'s faces that this is exactly what happened and they\'re going to show how they did it.

अमर सिंह ने:-\nये बात अमर सिंह ने कुछ वर्ष पूर्व अपने इंटरव्यू में बताई थी । बकौल अमर सिंह - "अनिल अंबानी के यहां एक भोज था. अमिताभ बच्चन ने संदेश दिया कि इस दौरान आप मुझसे मिलें. मैंने कहा कि हमारे आपके संबंध में अनिल अंबानी का क्या काम है ? हम सीधे मिल लें, लेकिन अमिताभ अड़ गए कि वंही मिलते है"\n"तब उन्होंने अनिल अंबानी के भोज में अनिल के सामने कहा कि सहारा के बोर्ड से आप भी निकल गए, मुझे, जया और एश्वर्या को भी निकलवा दिया. आपने सहारा से निकलने के लिए हमें ग़लत सलाह दी और वहां बोनी कपूर को रखवा दिया. आपने कितना ग़लत किया. हम लोग सक्षम लोग हैं और अपनी ज़िंदगी जी सकते हैं."\nअनिल अंबानी यह सुनकर अवाक रह गए. जया बच्चन वंहा खड़ी खड़ी मुस्कुराने लगी.\n\nचूंकि वहां अनिल अंबानी बैठे हुए थे इसलिए अमर सिंह चुप रहे. लेकिन फिर अनिल ने अमिताभ को लताड़ते हुए कहा कि "जब आप चौतरफ़ा क़र्ज़ में डूबे हुए थे और आप ने कुमार मंगलम बिरला और अंबानी से लेकर बसंत बिरला तक का चक्कर काटा और किसी ने आपको एक पैसा भी नहीं दिया, उस समय आपकी सक्षमता का क्या हुआ ? उस वक्त ये अमर सिंह न होता तो आप दर दर की ठोकरे खा रहे होते." अमिताभ ये सुनकर रुआंसे हो गए और सर झुकाकर खड़े हो गए. थोड़ी देर बाद वो अमर सिंह के पास गए और बोले- "जया ने घर मे हंगामा मचाया हुआ है. \n\nउसका दिल रखने के लिए मुझे यह बात आपको अनिल के सामने बोलनी पड़ी. लेकिन आपने अच्छा किया जो उसके सामने सच्चाई बयान कर दी"\nअसल मे अमिताभ सहित उनका पूरा परिवार जया बच्चन की हरकतों ,अड़ियल व्यवहार और बेतुके बोलों से परेशान है. ये बात सब जानते हैं कि अमिताभ बच्चन एक अलग घर \'प्रतीक्षा\' में रहते हैं. जया बच्चन एक अलग घर में रहती हैं और अभिषेक बच्चन एक अलग घर में रहते हैं. एक छोटे से परिवार के तीन लोग तीन जगह रहते हैं, यह बात जगजाहिर है, पूरी मुंबई देखती है.\n\nहाल ही में पूरे परिवार को कोविड 19 हुआ लेकिन जया बच्चन को नही हुआ. क्योंकि परिवार के सदस्य भी जया से यदाकदा ही मिलते है .\nआज जिस फिल्म इंडस्ट्री के बचाव की आड़ में बॉलिवुड के ड्रग्स माफिया का बचाव करने की सीमा भी जया बच्चन लांघ रही है उसी फिल्म इंडस्ट्री के लोग अमिताभ और जया बच्चन की उस भिखमंगई के दौर में अपना बकाया पैसा वसूलने के लिए अमिताभ और जया बच्चन के घर पर गुंडों और लफंगों को भेजने लगे थे. \n\nडिम्पल कपाड़िया ने तो उन्हें इतना परेशान किया था कि अमिताभ ने अपने इंटरव्यू तक मे इसका जिक्र किया. डिम्पल तो अपना पैसा वसूलने के लिए अमिताभ और जया बच्चन के घर में घुसकर जमकर गाली गलौज करने लगी थी.\nअतः रविकिशन और कंगना रानौत पर "जिस थाली में खाने, उसी थाली में छेद करने" का आरोप लगा रही जया बच्चन को यह याद कराना, बताना जरूरी है कि बॉलिवुड के ड्रग्स माफिया के विरुद्ध आवाज उठाने को "जिस थाली में खाना, उसी थाली में छेद करना" नहीं कहते.\n\nइसके बजाय जिन अमर सिंह ने अकेले अपने दम पर अमिताभ और जया बच्चन को उनकी उस भिखमंगई के नरक से निकाल कर सफ़लता सम्पन्नता समृद्धि और सम्मान के शिखर पर दोबारा बैठाया हो. अपनी उंगली पकड़ा कर देश के सर्वोच्च सदन राज्यसभा में ले जाकर बैठाया हो. उन अमर सिंह को जब मदद की आवश्यकता पड़ी तो उनकी मदद के लिए उनके पक्ष में खड़े होने के बजाय जया बच्चन उन अमर सिंह के शत्रु के साथ खड़ी हो गयी थी और जया बच्चन ने अमर सिंह पर प्रहार करने में कोई कसर बाकी नहीं रखी थी.\n\nअपनी उपरोक्त करतूतों को जया बच्चन पता नहीं क्या कहती समझती है, लेकिन इस देश का आम आदमी ऐसी करतूतों को "जिस थाली में खाना, उसी थाली में छेद करना" ही कहता और समझता है.'<br />Author: 'Freeharika'<br />id: 'itvtff'<br />Flair ::snoo_trollface:Bait molana Bait</li><li>Title:

पी रहे हो ... मैंने कहा ... हां ... क्यों आप ड्रिंक क्यों नहीं ले रहे हो ... मेरे यह कहने पर मैं ड्रिंक नहीं लेता हूं ... मेरी सार्वजनिक खिल्ली उड़ाई ... कहा ... आप ड्रिंक नहीं करोगे तो आप कॉरपोरेट वर्ल्ड में ग्रो नहीं कर पाओगे ... मैं दूसरा ग्लास में स्प्राइट लेकर आया ... उन सज्जन को बहुत बुरा लगा कि मैंने उनका जूठा ग्लास को हाथ नहीं लगाया ... और इस बात पर उन्होंने एतराज किया ... मैंने उनसे साफ-साफ कहा यह मेरी पर्सनल हाइजीन चॉइस है ... और अगर आप इस बात को बुरा मानते हैं तो आपकी चॉइस है ... मेरे अपने प्रिंसिपल्स से है और मैं उससे कंप्रोमाइज नहीं कर सकता हूं ... उसके बाद मैंने उस कंपनी में 6 साल गुजारे ... सज्जन ने कभी भी मुझसे बात नहीं किया ...\n\nउसके बाद बहुत से पार्टी ... बहुत से मीटिंग्स में ... मुझे शराब का ऑफर किया गया ... जिसे मैंने विनम्रता पूर्वक मना कर दिया ... मेरे सभी परिचित मेरी इस आदत को जानते हैं ... इसलिए वह मुझे अक्सर लंच पर इनवाइट किया करते हैं ... और कहते हैं आप डिनर मैनेज कर लो ...\n\n2013 में कंपनी की एक ट्रिप 150 डीलर्स के साथ में दुबई की थी ... मैं दुबई 2 दिन पहले पहुंच गया था ... मेरे डीलर थे दुबई में ... मुझे उनसे भी मिलना था ... और कुछ अरेंजमेंट भी देखनी थी ... पूरी टीम डेरा दुबई में होटल मेरियट में ठहरी हुई थी ... शाम की पार्टी क्रूज पर थी ... इस कंपनी को ज्वाइन किए हुए लगभग 10 महीने हो गए थे ... शाम को बस से लगभग 150 लोग वॉटर फ्रंट पर पहुंचे ... और वहां क्रूज़ पर पार्टी शुरू हुई ... जैसा होता है हिंदुस्तान में अगर शराब परोस दी जाए तो लोग हिंदी बोलना भूल जाते हैं ... पूरे हिंदुस्तान के डीलर्स मैाजूद थे ... शराब की नदियां बह रही थी ... लोग नशे में झूम रहे थे ... सिर्फ दो लोग थे जो शराब नहीं पीते थे ... एक किनारे में खड़े होकर बातें कर रहे थे ...\nमेरे कंपनी के मैंनेजिंग डायरेक्टर ... कोई बड़ी महंगी बोतल लेकर के मेरे पास पहुंचे ... वे भी नशे में थे ... उन्होंने बोतल मेरे मुंह से लगाने की कोशिश की ... मैंने उन्हें रोका ... उनका कहना था ... यह 20 हजार की बोतल है तुम एक घूंट तो ले लो ... मैंने कहा चाहे 20 लाख का क्यों ना हो ... मैं इसे नहीं ले सकता ... उन्होने कहा ... यह मेरा ऑर्डर है ... मैंने कहा ... ऐसा कोई आर्डर मैं नहीं मानता हूं ... जिससे मेरे प्रिंसिपल्स कॉम्प्रोमाइज होती हो ... वह चौक गए ... उन्हें ऐसा आशा नहीं था ... कि मैं 150 लोगों के सामने ऐसे स्पष्ट मना करूंगा ... तब तक एक दो लोग और पहुंचे और उन्हें खींचकर किनारे ले गए ..'<br />Author: 'Freeharika'<br />id: 'itsddz'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'Request hai Bhai plis'<br />Body: 'Bhoi idhar Kisi ke pass woh comment hai ?
