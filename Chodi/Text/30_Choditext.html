<li>Title: 'Some facts about the most peaceful guy that ever lived on this planet. The research has been done by a youtuber. Enjoy!'<br />Body: "Top 5 most disgusting facts about mohommad-\n1. (Sahih al'bukhari 5133) mohommad, married aisha, when she was 6 years old, and consummated/did s€x (r@ped her) the marriage, when she got 9 years old. According to mohommad, you must not touch a girl unless she approves you to, and what is considered to be the approval? Her SILENCE.\n2. (Sahih al'bukhari 5456) mohommad said, do not wash your hands after u've eaten, unless you've licked the fingers, or had your fingers licked by someone else. Because if you wash your hands without Licking or getting licked, the 'blessings of 0la might get washed away. (his fetishes were ahead of our time that' s for sure).\n3. (bukhari Al-adab Al-mufrad 1183) mohommad's grandchild came running to him, mohommad held and hugged him, and put his tongue in the kid's mouth, exchanged spit(French kiss) , to give him the blessings of ola.\n4. (sahih al'bukhari 5068) mohommad used to have s€x with all his 9 wives, in a single night, but would take bath only once.\n5. (Sahih al'bukhari 232) aisha/mohommad's 9 years old wife, said that she used to wash mohommad's underwear, scratch the semen out, meaning guy didn't clean himself even after having s€x/f@pping.\n. \n. \n. \nNow... Muslims literally idealize this parasite 🤮 Anyways, if any of you havs knowledge of quran/islam, can you please tell me what did 0la do? Why should he be worshipped? And what was his story? Like did he do anything to be a material to be worshipped? All he did was Licking the boots/b00ty of mohommad."<br />Author: 'UnusualSandwich7'<br />id: 'jduid6'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihad</li>

There is a sub called r/redditrequest where you can apply for moderation of the sub incase the sub\'s mods have been inactive for several weeks.\n\nIf it\'s been a long time and the sub has no mods listed, a request is directly granted by a bot on redditrequest. It\'s how I got gatecs, for example. I noticed that a librandu sub mod has requested for takeover of the sanghistuds sub so I thought of posting here. I can\'t ask for it because there\'s a 15 day post limit between request grants on redditrequest.\n\nIf you guys think there\'s a point to it, you probably can request for the sub. There\'s probably other subs out there in similar situation as well. I only mention this here because this is how librandus target main/official name subs or take the other subs and turn them into pitiful librandu "joke" subs (if it was actually funny, I\'d have understood, but at this point it\'s generally just cope for them).'<br />Author: 'general_landur'<br />id: 'jddi74'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

I have no idea how to go about this. I cant travel to meetups or go for volunteering.

<li>Title: 'Is there any truth in this claim? Could not find verifiable sources. Will knowledgeable rchodis please respond to this claim'<br />Body: '*A TRUE STORY MUST BE KNOWN TO EVERY ONE*‼️👌\n\n*\'His Masters Voice\' (HMV) had once published a pamphlet giving the history of gramophone record.*\n\n*Gramophone was invented by Thomas Alva Edison in the 19th century.*\n\n*Edison, who had invented many other gadgets like electric light and the motion picture camera, had become a legend even in his own time.*\n\n*When he invented the gramophone record, which could record human voice for posterity, he wanted to record the voice of an eminent scholar on his first piece.*\n\n*For that he chose Prof. Max Muller of England (a German by ethnicity), another great personality of the 19th century.*\n\n*He wrote to Max Muller saying,*\n\n*“I want to meet you and record your voice. When should I come?”*\n\n*Max Muller who had great respect for Edison asked him to come on a suitable time when most of the scholars of the continent of Europe would be gathering in England.*\n\n *Accordingly, Edison took a ship and went to England. He was introduced to the audience. All cheered Edison’s presence.*\n\n*Later at the request of Edison, Max Muller came on the stage and spoke in front of the instrument.*\n\n*Then Edison went back to his laboratory and by afternoon came back with a disc &amp; played it on the gramophone.*\n\n*The audience was thrilled to hear the voice of Max Muller from the instrument.*\n\n*They were glad that voices of great persons like Max Muller could be stored for the benefit of posterity.*\n\n*After several rounds of applause and congratulations to Thomas Edison, Max Muller came to the stage and addressed the scholars and asked them,*\n\n*“You heard my original voice in the morning. Then you heard the same voice coming out from this instrument in the afternoon. Do you understand what I said in the morning or what you heard in the afternoon?”*\n\n*The audience fell silent because they could not understand the language in which Max Muller had spoken.*\n\n*It was ‘Greek and Latin’ to them as they say.*\n\n*But had it been Greek or Latin, they would have definitely understood because they were from various parts of Europe.*\n\n*It was in a language which the European scholars had never heard.*\n\n*Max Muller then explained what he had spoken.*\n\n*He said that the language he spoke was Sanskrit and it was the first sloka of Rig Veda, which says "Agni Meele Purohitam”*\n\n*This was the first recorded public version on the gramophone plate.*\n\n*अग्निमीळे पुरोहितं यज्ञस्य देवं रत्वीजम।*\n*होतारं रत्नधातमम।।*\n*(Rig Veda 1.001.01)*\n\n*Why did Max Muller choose this?*\n\n*Addressing the audience he said,*\n\n*“Vedas are the oldest text of the human race. And “Agni Meele Purohitam” is the first verse of Rig Veda.*\n\n*"In the most primordial time, when the people did not know how even to cover their bodies and lived by hunting and housed in caves, Indians had attained high civilization and they gave the world universal philosophies in the form of the Vedas.”*\n\n*When “Agni Meele Purohitam” was replayed, the entire audience stood up in silence as a mark of respect.*\n\n*The verse means :*\n\n*“Oh Agni, You who gleam in the darkness, to You we come day by day, with devotion and bearing homage. So be of easy access to us, Agni, as a father to his son, abide with us for our well being."*'<br />Author: 'NaastikaBhakta'<br />id: 'jdalxg'<br />Flair ::Whatsapp: WhatsApp Forward</li>

<li>Title: 'Epilogue - Defeat'<br />Body: 'Epilogue - Defeat\n\n"How nice of you all to show up!"  Arbaz walked on to the stage with that little microphone cellotaped to his cheek.  The beads of sweat on his face showing up clearly on the monitor behind him.\n\nIn the audience were all the seculars.  They applauded.  This was their moment.  Their declaration of victory.  From this point on life was going to be beautiful.\n\n"Each and every one of you has made an indispensable contribution in to our struggle.  Today we can say that we have won because of you."\n\nThere you go! People in the audience were talking to each other.  Not that they had any doubts.  But they were told that they are the useful idiots and as soon as their side won the battle they would be put aside.  This is proof that they were wrong and we were right.  Not that anyone here had any doubt.\n\nArbaz proceeded to call out one by one these fighters.  They came to the stage.  Arbaz gave them a bouquet of red roses, and sprinkled rose attar on them and they were led off stage.  One by one.  As they got their due commendation, as the audience got thinner, those remaining applauded louder to compensate.\n\nWhen Rajdeep was called up, only Chetan was left in the audience.  He ran up to the foot of the stage and did a celebratory dance.  He shouted \'well done rajdeep\', \'you rock rajdeep\' and so on.  And finally only Chetan was left.  And his name was called.\n\nHe walked up.  Head held high and proud.  Chest swollen with pride.  Arms swinging like a muscled warrior.\n\nArbaz handed him the bouquet of roses.  "Thank you.  I am so proud to be part of the new beginning."  He said.  Arbaz smiled the most gentlest of smiles.  "You are welcome" he said, as he sprinkled attar on him.\n\nAs he turned around to walk off stage, the image of the gentle smile of Arbaz lingered in his mind.  Human beings, being human, he thought to himself.  As he walked through the side door and into the passage, he felt a warm feeling rising from his gut.  He felt amazing.\n\nThrough the door at the end of the passage he walked out to night.  He made out sounds of a crowd cheering.  He was on top of a flight of stairs which led to the parking lot.  He looked up and saw the flyover.  It was lined with people.  As he stood there, it was as if the crowds cheering rose.  Involuntarily, he raised his hand and waved.  The crowd cheered even more wildly.  \n\nThis is what I deserve, he thought to himself, as he walked down the flight of stairs.  He was now more sure than ever that he was on the right side of the fight.  Not that there was any doubt.\n\nHe stumbled on something, and looked down to see it was a sandal.  In his mind he imagined a woman holding up her saaree and running and one of her sandals coming off.  He saw another shoe.  Then few more.  Maybe people left their footwear here to …\n\nHe had reached the bottom of the flight of stairs.  He turned out and looked up at the crowd.  They were still cheering.  He raised his hand again.  It was as if they went crazy… or.. Laughing.  He could not tell.  Why would they laugh?\n\nHe looked ahead and saw one man standing in the middle of the lot, hands behind his back.  Smiling gently.  Four other men stood a little way away.  Hands behind their backs, smiling gently.  Probably to escort me to the car?  Take away the bouquet?  Get an autograph.\n\nThe wispy thin and long beard, the dug in cheeks, the skull cap, did not look like his typical fan.  He felt a gentle nudge.  He realised he had stopped walking.  Why?  He had nothing to fear now.  As he started walking, he tried to give the man a wide berth, but the person who was escorting him from the stage was gently nudging him towards the man.\n\nHe stopped a few feet from the man.  The man smiled at him.  Chetan smiled back.  He felt a gentle downward pressure on his shoulders.  He knew what he had to do.  He fell to his knees.  He realised what was going to happen to him.  He realised that the crowd had been standing out there for hours.  He realised that every single person who walked out faced the same fate.  The ones who had figured it out quicker would have struggled and tried to run.  That was the footwear.  \n\nHe felt disappointed.  He felt disappointed and let down by these people.  He fought for them and now they are dispensing with him.  This not right.\n\nHe kept his eyes open and as the lights started to fade, he tried in vain to say his last words.  \n\nHey Ram.'<br />Author: 'ekdhyan'<br />id: 'jcyctf'<br />Flair ::star: OC है बे </li>

<li>Title: "It's not love jihad, it's rape jihad or woman-trafficking jihad. Call it for what it is."<br />Body: 'What is "love jihad?" Hindu girl loving a Muslim boy, she converting, then marrying him, then living as a Muslim couple for the rest of their lives? Call the girl dumb, call her a traitor to the community, cry over it while the Muslim boys and liberals laugh at Hindu men looking like bitter incels while your hands are tied in the word of the law (and it should be, else we will have many other problems even in normal marriages).\n\nLove is consensual. It\'s a natural human emotion and it implies acceptance. If 2 adults love one another, there\'s nothing you can do. There\'s nothing called "love jihad." It\'s a made-up term by buffoons who don\'t know or are ignorant what the terms "love" or "jihad" mean.\n\nNow there is a non-consensual love, which is simply rape. It\'s defined as:\n\n&gt; unlawful sexual activity and usually sexual intercourse carried out forcibly **or under threat of injury** against a person\'s will or with a person who is beneath a certain age or incapable of valid consent because of mental illness, mental deficiency, intoxication, unconsciousness,**or deception**\n\nWhen Lakshmi goes with Afroz, she doesn\'t expect to be treated like this. On the surface, it looks fine. The secular Hindu family is true to their values and respects their daughters wishes and it looks like the Afroz\'s family is also happy. \n\nBut little does she know that Afroz is not secular and expects her to convert. \n\nMaybe she doesn\'t know that polytheist women can never be a Muslim\'s wife, but at best a rakhel (concubine). Or knowing such, believes that my Afroz is different and not a religious fanatic.\n\nMaybe he first started to date her using the fake name Ashish. Lot of such cases happen like that. \n\nIs that not deception? Did she really consent to this treatment. After she is stuck in an abusive marriage, does she have a choice to leave it? Or is she threatened?\n\nWhy are we calling it consensual "love jihad" then? The intent is akin to rape and human trafficking.\n\nI say woman trafficking because there are cases in Hindi media (and I remember one from Panipat) in which a widow was tricked into vivah with a Muzlim man using a fake Hindu name then forced into a nikah with one of his friends. I will have to search my post history for the story.'<br />Author: 'Shefali_Lamba'<br />id: 'jcchbg'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: 'A hindu apology.'<br />Body: 'I havelaready posted this, And I would like the mods to know that I am responding to wrong claims made on hinduism, so please do not take my post down.  If it breaks a rule please tell me and I will fix the post.\n\nThis is a response to a post made on r.librandu about casteism in hinduism. All the references he made are in bold and my response is below.\n\n**"The Brahman was his mouth, of both his arms was the Rājanya made. His thighs became the Vaiśya, from his feet the Śūdra was produced." (Rig Veda 10:90)**\n\nHow is this casteist? Is it saying Shudra\'s or any other caste are bad? It is describing the creation of the 4 varnas, not necessarily based on birth. And then again, wouldn\'t this mean Shudra\'s are important since people can barely function without feet, thus making Shudra\'s important? More over, Purusha is depicted in the sleeping position, making all parts of the body on the same level, possibly symbolising that all people are equal.\n\n**"I created mankind in four classes, different in their qualities and actions; though unchanging, I am the agent of this, the actor who never acts!” (Bhagavad Gita 4:13)**\n\nThis is just laughable. Krishna is specifically saying that caste is based upon qualities and actions, thus supporting the theory of caste based upon qualities and not birth.\n\n**"A person can never achieve freedom from reactions to activities without first performing prescribed Vedic duties: neither can perfection be attained by renouncing them as well.” (Bhagavad Gita 3:4)**\n\nThis again, is laughable. Where in the world does this mention caste? And the more accurate translation is "Not by non-performance of action does one reach actionless, and nor by mere renunciation does one attain perfection" And if "Vedic duties" is what makes this casteist, then how about the fact that each caste has perscribed Vedic duties, so this applies to everyone.\n\n**"No one exists for even an instant, without performing an action; however unwilling, every being is forced, to act by the qualities of nature.” (Bhagavad Gita 3:5)**\n\nNow, how is this casteist in nature? This is a simple fact that people have to perform action by qualities of nature, or the 3 guna\'s, being goodness passion and ignorance. This isn\'t casteist in the slightest.\n\n**"O Arjuna, the activities of the brahmanas, kastriyas , vaisyas and sudras are clearly divided according to the qualities born of their own nature.” (Bhagavad Gita 18:41)**\n\nNow this verse refers to how certain people are born with a certain nature with specific qualities, which will be better suited for certain occupations. Now, the verse says "born of their own nature" and not born of their family, which is the kind of system present in medieval times. So this means that a person born into a Shudra family can be considered as a Brahmin if he displays the nature and qualities required for that action.\n\nHe then goes on to quotes these verses here.\n\n**"The actions of a brahmana arising from his own nature are serenity, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honest, knowledge of the Vedas, wisdom and firm faith.“ (Bhagavad Gita 18:42)**\n\n**"The actions of a ksatriya born of his own nature are heroism, exuberance, determination, resourcefulness, without trace of cowardice in battle, generosity and leadership.“ (Bhagavad Gita 18:43)**\n\n**"The actions of a vaisya born of his own nature are agriculture, cow protection and trade; also the actions of a sudra born of his own nature consists in service to brahmana, ksatriyas and vaisyas.“ (Bhagavad Gita 18:44)**\n\nThese verses are simply describing the qualities and characteristics of each varna, and does not even talk about any varna negatively .So let us move on.\n\n**"Following each his own activity, a man achieves finally perfection; now hear how the performer of action prescribed according to nature attains perfection.“ (Bhagavad Gita 18:45)**\n\nThis again, can be explained by purpors of previous verses. And the actual verse reads "Devoted each to his own duty, man attains perfection, engaged in his own duty, he attains perfection". This verse talks about the duty of person, or dharma, which extends out of Varnashrama dharma, such as the dharma of a student or son, so we can take this talk of duty as extending to duty outside of caste.\n\n**"From whom is the existence of all living entities, by whom all this is pervaded; through worshipping Him, by one’s own actions prescribed according to nature a man achieves perfection.“ (Bhagavad Gita 18:46)**\n\nAgain, this is explained by previous purports.\n\n**“It is better to engage in one’s own svadharma (occupation), even though one may perform it imperfectly than to accept another’s occupation and perform it perfectly. Duties prescribed according to one’s nature are never affected by sinful reactions.“ (Bhagavad Gita 18:47)**\n\nThis verse confuses me as well, which is why I will try not to explain it without knowledge, so the original quoter can have this one.\n\n**“One should not abandon duties born of one’s nature, even if one sees defects in them, O son of Kunti. Indeed, all endeavors are veiled by some evil, as fire is by smoke.“ (Bhagavad Gita 18:48)**\n\nThis again, has explanations in other purports.\n\n**"It is far better to perform one’s svadharma (prescribed duties), even though faultily, than another’s duties perfectly. Destruction in the course of performing one’s own duty is better than engaging in another’s duties, for to follow another’s path is dangerous.” (Bhagavad Gita 3:35)**\n\nThis is similar to verse 18:47, which I will not answer without full knowledge.\n\n**"With the preponderance of vice, O Krishna, the women of the family become immoral; and from the immorality of women, O descendent of Vrishni, unwanted progeny are born." (Bhagavad Gita 1:41)**\n\nFirst I am going to say, in this translation there is no mention of caste, so I am not sure where casteism came into the picture if he read only from this version.\n\nBut In actuality, the verse talks about intercaste marriage and why they shouldn\'t be done. The word *varnashankara* ( in sanskrit वर्णसंकर) is used here as it means those of mixed castes.\n\nHere is the verse with a proper translation:\n\n**"By the prevelence of impiety, Oh Krishna, the women of the family become corrupted, Oh decendant of the Vrishni clan, giving birth to intermingling of castes". (BG 1.41)**\n\nNow, If I am to explain this properly, I will first need to explain the context. This is spoken by Arjuna in the first chapter, not Krishna, so we need not take this as solid fact. Why we need not take this? Because this is still in the part of the Gita where Arjuna is still ignorant of much of life and its meaning, and will thus have many wrong preconceptions about the truth brought to him by his society.\n\nHowever, the reason why Arjuna speaks against the union of separate castes is because each caste has religious rituals special to that caste, and thus if union is made with different castes, such rituals will not be able to be performed, thus possibly inviting bad karma to the family. Arjuna explains this in the very next verse.\n\n**"An increase in unwanted children results in hellish life both for the family and for those who destroy the family. Deprived of the sacrificial offerings, the ancestors of such corrupt families also fall." (Bhagavad Gita 1:42)**\n\nSo, I don\'t take this reasoning as a particularly bad one.\n\nAfter this, the commenter makes references to the manusmriti, which to me is quit frankly laughable. These people should play a game, go to random hindu\'s, ask them if they have a manusmriti at home, or have heard of it. Maybe even go to a temple and ask them if they have a copy inside. The answers to all these questions will probably be no. This is because the manusmriti is not so much a religious text, but a 2000 year old law book, which the content of which reflects. It is of course filled with casteism and sexism, which is why it is mostly rejected by those who know of it. The Manusmriti is an obsolete text which doesn\'t doesn\'t have an ounce of importance to the hindu tradition, and thus can\'t be used to vilify hinduism.\n\nIn conclusion, none of these claims on hinduism promoting casteism in the Rigveda or Gita have any legs to stand on, and these arguments may be discarded.\n\nMany thanks for listening.'<br />Author: 'Accomplished-Ad-6524'<br />id: 'jc945u'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li>

The series is about feminism and is produced by Shailja Kejriwal who is an Indian and is the chief creative officer for Zee Entertainment, and the show is published on OZEE5. \n[Link](https://eshe.in/2020/10/06/shailja-kejriwal/)\n\nNow I don’t mind if they want to even collaborate with Chinese and produce movies but at least show some consistency. You have Zee News which is going on for Pakistan bad, boycott them and all, and on the other hand, Zee is minting money from Pakistan. All the drama they did for banning Zindagi when URI happened was temporary. Now who is the fool here? We, the right wing or Zee? And then we complain about how the right wing ecosystem is shit.

<li>Title: 'Communists managers are worst.'<br />Body: 'So here is my story. I work in a very big stable company with complete job security (this detail is important for the rant). So there isn\'t any know incident of firing or layoff in recent times.\n\nJust before this Wuhan virus thing, around in February my immediate manager changed (those who are not yet in job, please note that in big organizations, there are several level of management). He is hardcore communist, literally hardcore. His Fb profile is full of anti-govt post (obviously central govt post because non BJP ruled state). He used to regularly participate in dhapli bajao type communist events on weekends before lockdown. Now coming to the rant part he is not manager of the project I am working on and literally every employee is fed up of him. He used to subtly ask to work more than 9 hours when lockdown started (Our organization policy is strictly against this). The people in this project are very cooperative and literally every one gave their best. \n\nnow after few month that subtle part of asking to over work is gone and he is directly saying to work as much as possible otherwise he will have to layoff (He don\'t of any such power and the organization won\'t allow it). He still can\'t say it on any recordable medium (email). Slowly this became very pushy, literally calling everybody and telling that they are not working up to the mark (trust me most of the people are working 12 hours except few of his close people). Now there came the part to send employee to office forcefully (It is not needed for the job, but staying at home will need some extra expenses which if he use, the profit of project will decrease). Some people convinced to office as he promised their will be some solution soon but later most  of them resisted.  "The solution" is still not ready, eventually everyone will have to go to office sooner than all other projects in this organization.\n\nHe regularly delays promotions of people exploiting loop holes of the policies. Removes people from the project if they are too rebellious and easily replacable. The thing is no one want to escalate the issue to higher management or change the job as people are afraid in this situation that what will happen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\'t hate the fact that he is exploiting the people. I hate that, he used to say, fight for people, against the govt/establishment. But the place where is in power, he is doing literally the worst job. His facebook/ whatsapp is still filled with same tone against govt on literally every issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFInal outcome is, if you want people to believe in your ideology, implement it where you can and show that it is better instead of expecting someone else to do it where you have no power.'<br />Author: 'ImaginaryLibrary1'<br />id: 'jakanr'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li>

I came across someone\'s IG account which was suspended within the last week. So they are still targetting others. If anyone of your videos/posts etc were removed, do let me know. Send me snapshots of suspensions if possible.\n2. Please don\'t mention Byjus as BiJuice and WhiteHatJr as barfi etc. Post as much as you can and write their exact name. Do not back out. The issue is hot, we have to break their back. We must write their accurate names ONLY. This is for those parents who don\'t know how Byjus rules the internet, when such parents posts their reviews they don\'t know if they have to write Byjus as Bijuice. Their reviews get removed. We are here to break the myth that Byjus can do any harm, once this myth and their arrogance breaks, lakhs of people will be able to post their honest reviews and our work will be done.\n3. After this article, Karan Bajaj did give a lame reply over LinkedIn. " *I appreciate that every entrepreneur, just as everyone in the public domain, should be exposed to ruthless scrutiny and public debate. "* BS. He got 16 of my videos removed, 2 YT channels, 2 Reddit accounts, 1 Twitter, 1 Quora. And now he says this. It took me 2 months of constant posting content, getting an article published by Ken, and he just casually ignores the issue. \n4. One of their Sales Director started messaging me, over Linkedin. For all the questions his reply was "hehe or smilies". He didn\'t care for anything. Did not answer a single question and kept laughing. Should I share that chat here? I ended up telling him to FO if he doesn\'t stop messaging me. It doesn\'t have any answers but does show their attitude regarding our questions. Let me know if I should post that chat or not. \n5. One another Director of WhiteHatJr started telling me she will file a case of Harassment over me. Somehow I harassed her. She still hasn\'t answered how I harassed her. \n\nAfter [The Morning Context](https://themorningcontext.com/whitehat-jrs-shades-of-grey/) article: \n\n1. Karan Bajaj again didn\'t reply to the actual answers. Their game plan is that because they are in the education sector, they get to lie and play false advertisements. He talks about his daughter, how she loves coding, totally deflections the questions asked in the article. \n2. \'The article is behind a paywall\': Yes. No one else wants to publish such articles. Many journalists from mainstream media houses (which run on ads) talked to me, and in the very end, they drop the articles. All the work, emails, information that I provide, time that is invested gets wasted. I think we can understand what happens behind the scenes. \n3. We need to corner WhiteHatJr on Linkedin now to make them accountable for their lies and false advertisements.

The value of the deal? $250 million.\n\nThese engines were crucial for Indian Space program. especially to graduate from the PSLVs to GSLVs.\n\nPresident Bush was OK with it. But a democrat senator put in an amendment which stated that IF Russia sold the cryogenic engine to India, this aid package would be scuttled!\n\nRussia badly needed this aid. It had no choice but to back down from the deal it already had with India. \nIn the same period, China was taking technology from Russia by the bushels. The US, indeed this Senator, of course preferred to look the other way.\n\nNot just that, there were numerous attempts of Sabotage of the Indian cryogenic program by some 'interested' foreign agencies. It took years, but India developed its own solution, lynchpining on the little help it had gotten from Russia before the deal was scuttled.\n\nThe senator that scuttled the deal was one JOE BIDEN.\nThe whole issue was covered ina 1992 article of the LA times."<br />Author: 'NaastikaBhakta'<br />id: 'ja1v27'<br />Flair ::Whatsapp: WhatsApp Forward</li>

<li>Title: "[Rant] People who complain about 'Love Jihad' and Indian men being emasculated in the media really need to learn some game."<br />Body: "By game here I mean the way you talk to girls and maintain your social status. There's a reason why we arent as popular among the librandu janta, its because the typical 'bhrata' image is of someone who has a resting angry face with a teeka. The love jihad situation is because we as brothers and fathers don't teach the young populace how to talk to women and win them over. Which is by 1. Looking good (Fitness/Grooming), 2. Being socially active and suave (done through talking to max people and learning from whoever it works for). This is the easiest thing in the world for those with the right mentors, and the hardest for vice versa. Game is what usually seperates the men who easily influence women/men who don't. Thing is in the popular media mux men are shown as attractive whereas we really need to fight the stereotypes of being fatter than average etc. The case abroad is even sad for us where white guys literally take the best piece of the pie while Indian men are emasculated in the media to no extent. Dating sucks for us and it's about time we bring a change. There are tons of amazing YouTube channels out there on how to learn the skill, how to go to a club and (NON CREEPINGLY) talk to a woman. Indian men are really creepy while talking to girls (staring and trying to escalate too soon are rampant in the guys, plus us giving 0 shits about our grooming doesnt help either) so learn from the best of the best and make a change. An important thing here is not to be someone who is a crab in the bucket for other Indians, if someone is getting a girl (out of their league or whatever, plus if you approach and talk to girls long enough you'll realize leagues for us is way different than them) just support them, hi5 them, fist bump them. Be supportive and they'll be equally so. I learnt game from a black guy while traveling in Russia, so to learn this skill the best way is to travel and meet good guys (usually from other countries). They have the best and the most practical advise. Latinos are the BEST for this.\n\n\n\nWe need to teach our kids and ourselves how to look good, groom well and talk to girls. What the librandu and mux crowd has a upper hand in is being attractive. If in general we can work on ourselves then most of our problems might get sorted. Learn from Punjabis, they dont even have to worry about any of that shit because, and thats the truth of society, EVERYONE LISTENS TO ATTRACTIVE GUYS. Let's encourage our bhratas to go to the gym, take up sports and go to debate classes.\n\n\n\nAlso regarding LJ and the cases that happen: It's because when you're busy studying they're busy trying to learn how to be smooth with the ladies. The muxes take care of their looks, usually talk nicely (Urdu's romantic reputation usually helps) and the worst thing is they don't make it a taboo out of learning how to talk to girls. It's literally a need in their community, so we need to have it the same way. Lately due to cases of cheating and infidelity becoming so common (especially in corporates and even small houses) we really need to train the coming generation how to deal with it and how to be someone who is man enough to get some.\n\n\n\nI have also started a discord server for Indian guys to learn dating. If you guys wanna join you're most welcome. Feel free to DM for the same. It's for everyone's good."<br />Author: 'justice4ssr'<br />id: 'j9jkdt'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li>

There\'s Hindu Rashtrawad; either you subscribe to it or you don\'t.\n\nThe problem with several Pro-Hindu ( and I count all the subsidiaries of Sanatan Dharma - Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism) is not that we do were less in number or that we cant fight for our liberation; it\'s the very basic fight that though we are all on the same side, we are so divided by our ideologies, that unlike Left Wing, we have no common goal to achieve.\n\nHere\'s a fun activity to try this around.\n\n1. Gather a few pro- Hind Rashtrawad in a room and introduce a topic on how Left wing and Liberals have destroyed our culture and kept our younger generations from learning about their own history.\n2. Watch the topic spiral out of "Left Wings rule over mind of Indians" to how each pro -Hindu Rashtrawad person has his own version to implement and what they think is correct according to their ideologies.\n\nThe left wings doesn\'t suffer from such division. For one, they are too delusional and mentally incapable to ever have a though of their own as their common cry is a cry of propaganda which can be easily debunked with very mild and small facts. In a even of facts, a debate with Left Winger turns to a blame game where Left Wingers only objective is to conclude you as fascist and communal.\n\nLeft Wing only one agenda - "to destroy the indigenous" culture of Indian Subcontinent, which had stood the test of time since ages and has found a way to stand up no matter how many invaders tried to subdue us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a event like this where you enemy has a common goal, its time for Pro-Hind Rashtrawad groups to come to a conclusion, just for the sake of achieving their target of uniting as a single group and take control.

Yes I term -pro-Indian as well because only the Hindus are bound to their mother land and treat it that way. For everyone else, it has always been a land of people who are culturally so vast and different than them that the only way they could think of controlling us was to destroy us completely.\n\nSeveral subtle crusades, and mass invasions later, Bharat (Hindu and Bharat are one and the same) is the only culture in the world which had withstood the test of time and the onslaught of several enemies whose sole purpose in life was to destroy our great culture.\n\nBut the times have changed now, and so has the enemy changed their ways of working; crusades and invasions have taken a new shape of secret funding and guerilla warfare, where the enemies have adopted a way of targeting the Bharat and it's people in secret and through the things we hold so dear to us - law and order. Bharatiya people have always been a staunch follower of law and order; let it be the law of the land, the king or the religion. But what happens if the laws are rigged against you? According to 2011 Census, [Hindus are minority in eight states](https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-give-hindus-minority-status-in-eight-states-bjp-leader-petitions-apex-court-2777162) i.e. Lakshadweep (2.5%), Mizoram (2.75%), Nagaland (8.75%), Meghalaya (11.53%), J&amp;K (28.44%), Arunachal Pradesh (29%), Manipur (31.39%) and Punjab (38.40%).\n\nThe problem is not with the outside world which is affecting us. We had suffered the onslaught for a more than 500 years and still managed to keep our culture intact. The enemy is fighting us from within. Infiltrating our system and driving us out of the positions we so casually took for granted.\n\nThere have been several reports how the enemy has tried to infiltrate the controlling power positions in India, and in return what did we get- a mere pale response from the Hindus who yet stood divided on the topic.\n\nWhile the Hindus are busy fighting themselves (by getting divided in several Wings), the enemy has taken it their freedom to trample on us. A fact which is clearly visible by the fact that there are several small subs instead of a large one.\n\nAnd still what is the most we do - rant, accuse, deny the facts and go back to sleep.\n\nIt is time when we use this collective groups to plan and take back what belongs to us rightfully. It is high time we create a atmosphere where we can place our people in high decision making powers.

Lets try to do the math here for a bit:\n\n\\---&gt;So mumbai police says republic tv increased their trp by first bribing the company that moniters the trp (by installing a trp monitoring device in some household tv connections) and then bribing some of the households (with that device installed) into keeping republic tv channel always open on their televisions to increase the trp.\n\n\\---&gt;Population of mumbai is around 2 crore. Its safe to assume around 30% people must have tvs, which is 60lakh connections.\n\n\\---&gt; Now to accurately measure the trp atleast 10% of these connections must be installed with those trp measuring devices (because I dont see how anything less than 10% could give the correct trp figures). That means around 6 lakh of those tv connections must have those trp devices. Heck, lets undervalue it to 2 lakh devices just to be sure we aren't overestimating. \n\n\\---&gt; Now for republic to actually sway the ratings of their channel they must atleast control 20% of those 2 lakh devices(which again is gross underestimation). So that means republic has to bribe 40,000 households INR500 per month. which amounts to **INR 2 crore per month.**\n\n\\---&gt; Now of course even mumbai police is not that stupid to believe that the trp of mumbai ( just 1 city out of 4000 cities in india) alone will sway the trp of whole india so they said republic is doing it in other places too.\n\n\\---&gt; Now there are a total of 4000 cities in india. Lets say republic is doing the same in 25% of the other cities too which is 1000 cities. That means money spent by republic to bribe all over india is 2croreX1000 = **2000 crore per month.**\n\n\\---&gt; **And this figure is after undervaluing figures in many places, only taking 1000 out of 4000 cities and not counting the 6.5 lakh villages in india at all.** \n\n  So republic tv makes so much money that they can pay 2000 crore per month just as bribes.

<li>Title: "Threats, Hate speeches and Systematic Suppression of RW folks on Twitter - True Indology's Testimony!"<br />Body: 'I am just copy-pasting the whole statement written by True Indology on his Facebook Page about recent and old events. \n\n# Twitter scam: the price of speaking truth.\n\n&gt;Yes, it has happened to me. Something very extraordinary and shocking. Read on.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I have been active on twitter since July 2019 and my ID is u/tiinexile (with two \'i\'s). This is my only account on twitter. ([https://twitter.com/TIinExile](https://twitter.com/TIinExile)). Every other account is fake.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Two weeks ago, I got a death threat from an Islamist handle who has been impersonating me as "True Indology" from a very long time.  The purpose of that handle is two fold. While the handle impersonates as "True Indology" mostly to gain followers in my name , it shows its real face in a few tweets condemning me to death because I dared speak unflatteringly about Mughals.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The impersonator  handle wrote "People like you don\'t deserve life.  You have not seen my hospitality yet. You deserve a brutal death in public which will horrify all anti class enemies" (notice the communist-Islamist class conflict language in the threat).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This handle has been impersonating me for more than a year now. I had sent several reports to twitter and so had my followers. But all in vain. Nothing has ever happened. I had long lost any faith in twitter. So, I rather filed a cyber complaint.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;This incident happened two weeks ago. It really cast apprehensions in my mind about my own security. After all, we all know what happened to Kamlesh Tiwari. All said and done, we are fighting our own battle and are ultimately responsible to our own selves. I also had a lot of things going on at my professional front. I did not want any mental disturbance. So I thought it wise to deactivate the handle for a while and concentrate on my professional life.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Two days ago, I reactivated my handle as I had been told that it would permanently be lost in the event of not reactivating within 30 days. To my surprise, my handle had not shown  the correct count of my followers and following list on reactivation. Granted, there is a Twitter policy that it takes time for the correct follower and following count to show up on reactivated accounts. But twitter makes it clear on its policies forum that it should not take more than 48 hours.  At the time of writing this post, it has well been more than 60 hours since I reactivated my handle.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But there is more. Twitter does not allow anyone to follow me. If any account follows me, it will automatically be unfollowed on a simple page refresh. How? Why should anybody following me find himself unfollowed on page refresh? This has NEVER happened. No, this is not any twitter policy. This is not even a twitter bug or issue. I do not find any such issue on twitter complaint forums.  This is simply inexplicable behavior by twitter. And it happens in broad daylight. TWITTER DOES NOT ALLOW ANYONE TO FOLLOW ME.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There is more still. My follower count has been fluctuating. It shows 10k at one instance. It shows 10 at the very next. If anybody types my ID (@tiinexile-with two ‘i’s), it simply does not show itself on Twitter.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yet, twitter did something extremely shocking and inexplicable. It has allowed the fake accounts and impersonators to run freely on my ID. Let me give you an example. Let us say your ID on twitter is u/hari. Imagine finding someone else on twitter using u/hari? You would think whether it is even possible? Even deactivated and suspended accounts do not have their ID available for others to usurp. But twitter has freely distributed my handle to impersonators. It has promoted ID theft. This does NOT HAPPEN at all. This is again not just a twitter bug.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;As it stands now, while my follower count keeps fluctuating even after 48 hours, the person who sent me the death threat is active on twitter and he assumes my identity. Twitter has given away my original ID u/trueindology to him.? How and why? This is downright fraudulent behavior by twitter. It has enabled identity theft. The account cunningly calls himself “back up” to seem original and gain followers in my name while sending death threats to me. People who mistakenly fall for the impersonator handle that had sent me death threats continue to follow his account. This includes prominent people like Mohandas Pai, Smita Deshmukh, Prafulla Ketkar, R Vaidyanathan and Gaurav Sawant. Just imagine the extent of this twitter scam!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As I helplessly write this post now, twitter still tells me ‘‘You do not have any followers”. It still does not show my ID among the people. If anybody types “True Indology” in the people section of twitter, Twitter does not show my real account. It only shows the fake impersonator who has sent me the death threat. He has gained 3800 followers in a day and his account has more than 4000 followers as it stands now while twitter does not allow ANYONE to follow my account. This is a true story and these events have simply left me appalled. This is the price I pray for speaking truth.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Remember. This is NOT about me. This has happened to me because I dared speak up the truth. This could very well happen to you tomorrow. Just imagine yourself in my shoes. Does not the prospect of enabling identity theft by huge MNCs sound scary? Suspension is one thing. But a scam on this level is unprecedented and has not happened  so publicly and blatantly as far as I know.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Here are some details.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My real and only active account on twitter: u/tiinexile (ti in exile : with two is) [https://twitter.com/TIinExile](https://twitter.com/TIinExile)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The fake impersonator who sent me death threats:  u/TruelndoIogy  \n&gt;  \n&gt;([https://twitter.com/TruelndoIogy](https://twitter.com/TruelndoIogy))  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Screenshots and video proofs:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://twitter.com/ProjMattersIN/status/1313618788361752576](https://twitter.com/ProjMattersIN/status/1313618788361752576)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://twitter.com/VideshiKes.../status/1313613599366025216](https://twitter.com/VideshiKes.../status/1313613599366025216)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://twitter.com/VideshiKes.../status/1313613735735422977](https://twitter.com/VideshiKes.../status/1313613735735422977)\n\nSource : [https://www.facebook.com/trueindology.org/posts/1506993732834474](https://www.facebook.com/trueindology.org/posts/1506993732834474)'<br />Author: 'DrunkEpsilon'<br />id: 'j6p0g0'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li>

... मैं रात को 10:00 बजे कोलंबो पहुंचा ... इमीग्रेशन - कस्टम क्लियर कर के मैं 11:00 बजे एयरपोर्ट से बाहर निकला ... होटल की टैक्सी मुझे लेने के लिए खड़ी थी ... एयरपोर्ट से होटल की दूरी लगभग 35 किलोमीटर थी ... उन दिनों एक्सप्रेसवे नहीं बना था ... शहर के ट्रैफिक से निकलते- निकलते मैं लगभग 12:30 बजे होटल पहुंचा ... सोते-सोते रात में 1:00 बज गई ... सुबह 8:00 बजे नींद टूटी ...\n\nतैयार होकर मैनें डिस्ट्रीब्यूटर को फोन किया ... उसने कहा आज पोया डे है ... पब्लिक हॉलिडे हैं आप चाहो तो रिलैक्स कर सकते हो ... काम कुछ नहीं होगा ... खैर होटल में नाश्ता कर ... मैं गंगा रामा टेंपल पहुंच गया ... गंगा रामा टेंपल और सीमा मलाका टेंपल आस पास में ही है ... दो-तीन घंटे समय गुजार कर ... मैं अपने होटल वापस पहुंचा ...\n\n लंच का समय हो गया था ... मैंने सोचा आस-पास के कोई फूड जंक्शन को ट्राई किया जाए ...\nहोटल से निकलकर मैं इधर-उधर घूम रहा था ... अचानक मुझे एक फूड जंक्शन का बोर्ड दिखाई पड़ा ... छोटा सा रेस्टोरेंट था ... साफ सुथरा ... अंदर पहुंचा तो देखा एक वृद्ध सज्जन ... जो सफेद हाफ शर्ट में अपने काउंटर पर बैठे हुए हैं ... माथे पर बहुत ही खूबसूरत तिलक लगा था ... उनके पीछे दीवार पर ... श्रीगणपति - श्री लक्ष्मी - श्री दुर्गा - श्री शिव - श्री तिरुपति और श्री सरस्वती की बेहद आकर्षक कांच के फ्रेम में फोटो लगे हुए थे ... जिनमें रंग बिरंगी बत्तियां जल बुझ रही थी ... बेहद सुगंधित अगरबत्ती का खुशबू चारों ओर फैला हुआ था ...\nजैसा कि मेरी आदत है ... \n\nमैनें दोनों हाथ जोड़कर मैंने भी उन्हें नमस्कार किया ... उनके चेहरे पर मुस्कान आ गई ... फिर मैंने उनसे अंग्रेजी में पूछा पूछा क्या मुझे शाकाहारी खाना मिल सकता है ... उन्होंने टूटी-फूटी हिंदी में कहा ... अन्ना जरूर मिलेगा ... आप बैठो ... कहकर वह अपने काउंटर से बाहर निकले ... मुझे एक टेबल पर बिठाया ... वे अंदर किचन में पहुंचे ... उनके साथ एक वेटर स्टील की थाली लाकर मेरे सामने रखा जिसमें केले का पत्ता रखा हुआ था .. उसने चावल ... सांभर ... रसम ...दो तरह की चटनी पापड और एक कटोरी में थोड़ी दाल लाकर दिया ... उन्होंने कहा ....यह प्योर वेजीटेरियन खाना है आप अच्छे से खाओ ... खाना खाने के बाद मैंने पैसे देने के लिए उनके काउंटर पर पहुंचा ... उन्होंने मुझसे टूटी-फूटी हिंदी में पूछा .\n\n.. क्या मैं दिल्ली से हूं ... मेरे हां सुनते ही वह मुस्कुराए ... और बोले वह एक बार दिल्ली गया था ... लेकिन पराठे खा खा कर परेशान हो गया ... और बहुत गर्मी थी ... मैंने उनसे पूछा आप श्रीलंका से ही है ... उनका कहना था जी ... हमें पता ही नहीं कि हमारे पूर्वज कब इंडिया से इधर आया ... लेकिन कम से कम 1000 साल तो हो ही गया है ... फिर उन्होंने पूछा मुझे उनका खाना कैसा लगा ... मैंने कहा खाना बहुत अच्छा था ....\nऔर मैं रात में फिर आऊंगा खाने के लिए ...\nशाम को लगभग 7:00 बजे फिर मैं पहुंचा ... मुझे देखते ही उन्होंने हाथ जोड़कर नमस्कार किया ... मैंने उनसे इडली देने को कहा ... वेटर ने इडली दाल सांभर वाइट चटनी और यलो चटनी सर्व की ... मैंने इडली खाना शुरू किया ... वे मेरी टेबल पर आकर खडे हुए ... मैंने उन्हें भी डिनर के लिए इनवाइट किया ... वह हंसने लगे ... और बोले मैं रात में 10:00 बजे खाता हूं ... घर पर वाइफ के साथ ... मैंने बातचीत शुरू करने के लिए पूछा ... आप तमिल हो ... सिविल वार के समय आपको तकलीफ नहीं हुई ...\n\n वे अचानक चौकं करअपने दाएं बाएं देखा फिर एकदम धीरे आवाज में मुझसे कहा आप इस विषय में कोई बात मत करना आप सीरियस प्रॉब्लम में पड़ जाओगे ... खाना खाकर मैंने उनसे विदा ली...\nदूसरे दिन में अपने डिस्ट्रीब्यूटर के साथ था ... हमने लंच एक इंडियन रेस्टोरेंट ली ... डिनर के लिए मैं वापस वही पहुंचा ... एक दूसरे को नमस्कार किया ... उन्होंने कहा अन्ना आज दोपहर में नहीं आया ... मैंने कहा सर मैं डिस्ट्रीब्यूटर के साथ था ... खाना उधर ही खा लिया ... अभी क्या खाएगा उन्होंने पूछा... मसाला डोसा बनवा दो मैंने कहा ... ठीक है इस तरह से दो-तीन दिन गुजर गया ... एक दिन जब मैं पहुंचा तो उनके रेस्टोरेंट में कोई नहीं था ... तो उनके काउंटर पर खड़े खड़े बातचीत शुरू हुई ... उन्होंने काउंटर से अपना सिर आगे किया ... लगभग मेरे चेहरे के पास लाकर बोला ... अन्ना आप जब तक श्रीलंका में हो ... तब तक आप सिविल वार ... एलटीटीई ... प्रभाकरण ... तमिल ... के बारे में कोई भी बात ... किसी से भी नहीं करोगे ... \n\nकाफी पुलिस और इंटेलिजेंस के लोग होते हैं ... अगर किसी ने भी आपकी बात सुन ली ... और पुलिस को इन्फॉर्म कर दिया ... तो आप बहुत ही सीरियस प्रॉब्लम में फंस जाओगे ... मैंने उनसे पूछा आप ही बता दो क्या हुआ था ... उन्होंने कहा मैं यहां कुछ नहीं बता सकता हूं ...\nएक शाम उनकी धर्मपत्नी भी थी ... कीमती साड़ी और बहुत सारे जेवर पहने हुए ... उन्होंने अपनी धर्मपत्नी को मेरे बारे में कुछ अपने लैंग्वेज में बताया ... उनकी धर्मपत्नी को हिंदी नहीं आती थी .... उन्होंने मुझसे टूटी-फूटी अंग्रेजी में घर आने को कहा ... मैंने भी कह दिया जल्दी आऊंगा ...\nदूसरा दिन शाम को मैं उनका रेस्टोरेंट पहुंचा ... वह मुझे लेकर अपने घर ... उनका घर लगभग 300 मीटर दूर था ...उनकी धर्मपत्नी मुझे देखकर बहुत खुश हुई ... उन्होंने हमें पानी दी ... और थोड़ी देर में बेहद शानदार कॉफी भी ... इधर उधर की बातें हो रही थी ... घर की परिवार की ...\n\nमैंने उनसे पूछा आप तो तमिल हो ... इतने साल से श्रीलंका में हो ... इतनी बड़ी सिविल वार हुई ... आप बहुत कुछ जानते होंगे ... मुझे कुछ नहीं बताएंगे ... उन्होंने कहा अन्ना जो हो गया उसे भूल जाओ ... हमारा सब कुछ खत्म हो चुका है ... सिर्फ हम पति-पत्नी हैं ... हमारी उम्र 75 से ज्यादा है ... हम कितने दिन बचेंगे पता नहीं ... जब तक हाथ-पैर चल रहा है ... मैं रेस्टोरेंट चला रहा हूं ... मरने के बाद वह भी बंद हो जाएगा ....\nउनकी आंखों में आंसू आ गए थे ... उन्होंने आगे कहा ... दो बेटियों के पैदा होने के 11 साल बाद एक बेटा हुआ ... मेरे तीनो बच्चों की हत्या कर दी गई मेरी तो आवाज ही बंद हो गई ... मैं अवाक रह गया ... एक घूंट पानी पीकर उन्होंने कहना शुरू किया ... इंडिपेंडेंस के बाद श्रीलंका से लगभग पांच लाख तमिल भागकर इंडिया चले गए ... \n\nऔर लगभग दश लाख तमिलों की नागरिकता समाप्त हो गई ... हम स्टेट लेस हो गये ... इस देश में हमारा कोई अस्तित्व नहीं रहा ... हजारों तमिल जो सरकारी नौकरी में थे ... उनकी नौकरी समाप्त कर दी गई ...\nसरेआम तमिलों की हत्या होती थी ... महिलाओं के साथ बलात्कार ... तमिलों के घर में आग लगा दिया जाता था ... उनकी दुकान और मकान लूट ली जाती थी ... हमारी कोई रिपोर्ट दर्ज नहीं होती थी ... ना ही हमें कोई सुरक्षा प्रदान किया जाता था ... हम जीवित थे तो सिर्फ अपने अड़ोस पड़ोस के लोगों के बदौलत ... पुलिस हमें प्रोटेक्ट करने नहीं आती थी ... हम अपने ही देश में सेकंड क्लास सिटीजन हो गये थे ... हमारा भविष्य अंधकार में था ...\n\n मेरी दोनो बेटियों की शादी ... ईस्ट श्रीलंका में हुआ था ... और बड़ी बेटी का एक बेटा भी था 3 साल का ... उनके परिवार पूरे परिवार को गोलियों से भून दिया गया ... मेरी बेटा जो स्कूल स्टूडेंट था ... उसकी की हत्या कोलंबो में कर दी गई ... जब स्कूल से लौट रहा था ... उसकी आईडेंटिटी कार्ड देख कर .. उसे point-blank रेंज से गोली मार दी गई ... उसके सर के टुकड़े टुकड़े हो गए ...\nहे भगवान ... मेरे मुंह से आवाज निकलना भी बंद हो गया था ... उन्होंने कहना जारी रखा ... चुन-चुन कर दुकानों में आग लगा दी जाती थी ... और सामने से दरवाजे बंद कर दिए जाते थे ... तमिल दुकानदार अंदर ही जलकर राख हो जाते थे ... बाहर से चीखते चिल्लाते उनकी महिलाओं के साथ सड़कों पर बलात्कार होता था ... साथ में नारा लगा जाता था .... हम तमिलों की हत्या कर देंगे ... और उनकी औरतों से अपने बच्चे पैदा करेंगे ...\n मेरे रोंगटे खड़े हो गए ... हम दोनों के हीं आंखों में आंसू थे\nउनकी पत्नी को हिंदी समझ में नहीं आ रही थी ... लेकिन वह हाव-भाव से समझ पा रही थी ... उन्होंने कहा एक लाख से ज्यादा तमिल सिविलियंस ही हत्या हुई ... 25000 से ज्यादा तमिल महिलाओं की बलात्कार के बाद वीभत्स हत्या कर दिया गया ... खिड़की से उन्होने बाहर की लेन दिखाइ ... चुकी कोलंबो समुद्र के किनारे हैं ... तो बारिश अधिक होती है ... लेन के दोनों और नालियां थी ... उन्होंने नालियों की तरफ इशारा करते हुए कहा ... वह ड्रेनेज सिस्टम देख रहा है ... अभी कवर्ड है ... उस समय कवर्ड नहीं होता था ... और उन ड्रेनेज सिस्टम से सिर्फ खून बहते थे ... \n\nकोलंबो में ऐसे ऐसे जगह थे .... जहां सड़क पार करने के लिए खून के सैलाब को पार करना पड़ता था ... हमें पता नहीं होता था ... कब हमें एक गोली आकर लगेगी ... और हम समाप्त हो जाएंगे ... एक गोली मेरे बेटे को लगी ... वह स्कूल स्टूडेंट था ... मेरे बेटे का सर का परखच्चे उड़ गया था ... मैंने सिर्फ उसका शरीर का अंतिम संस्कार किया ... मेरी दोनों बेटियां अपने पूरे परिवार के साथ समाप्त हो गई थी ... कोई नहीं बचा ... हम दोनों के सिवा ... अन्ना बुरा मत मानना ... आप मेरे बेटे के जैसे हो ... बाहर कभी भी इस सिलसिले में किसी से बात मत करना ... मेरे बहुत से रिश्तेदार थे कोलंबो में ... और आसपास ....अधिकांश मारे गए ..\n\n. पूरी की पूरी एक कम्युनिटी का सर्वनाश हो गया और दुनिया देखती रही ... कुछ लोग इसको बर्दाश्त नहीं कर पाए ... उन्होंने लड़कर मरना पसंद किया ....बहुत सारे छोटे छोटे विद्रोही गुट बन गए ... उन विद्रोहियों का एक संगठन बना ... जिसको एलटीटी के नाम से जाना जाता है ... अगर एलटीटी नहीं होती तो आज एक भी तमिल हिंदू ....श्रीलंका में जिंदा नहीं होता ... प्रभाकरण मर गया ....उसका खानदान समाप्त हो गया ... लेकिन यह उसकी संघर्ष का परिणाम है ... कि कुछ तमिल आज भी श्रीलंका में जिंदा है ...\nभूख समाप्त हो चुकी थी ... \nफिर भी उनके जोर देने से ... मैंने थोड़ा सा खाना खाया ... वापस मुझे मेरे होटल तक छोड़ने आए ... रात भर मैं सो नही पाया ... उसके बाद जब भी श्रीलंका जाता था ... उनके रेस्टोरेंट मैं जरूर जाता था ... 2017 में उनका देहांत हो गया ... तीन महीने के बाद उनकी पत्नी का भी ... उनका रेस्टोरेंट और उसके आसपास के दुकानों को तोड़कर एक

Should there be a psychiatric analysis ?? Anything else you would like to tell me, good, bad or ugly. Anything will be appreciated"<br />Author: 'burmesefalcon'<br />id: 'j5g1u5'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li>

<li>Title: 'रावण अब भी जिंदा है : क्या मीना बचा पाई इज्जत'<br />Body: 'r/HindiFic\n\nमीना सड़क पर आ कर आटोरिकशे का इंतजार करने लगी, मगर आटोरिकशा नहीं आया. वह अकेली ही बूआ के यहां गीतसंगीत के प्रोग्राम में गाने आई थी. तब बूआ ने भी कहा था, ‘अकेली मत जा. किसी को साथ ले जा.’ मीना ने कहा था, ‘क्यों तकलीफ दूं किसी को? मैं खुद ही आटोरिकशे में बैठ कर चली जाऊंगी?’\n\nमीना को तो अकेले सफर करने का जुनून था. यहां आने से पहले उस ने राहुल से भी यही कहा था, ‘मैं बूआ के यहां गीत गाने जा रही हूं.’ ‘चलो, मैं छोड़ आता हूं.’\n\n‘नहीं, मैं चली जाऊंगी,’ मीना ने अनमने मन से कह कर टाल दिया था. तब राहुल बोला था, ‘जमाना बड़ा खराब है. अकेली औरत का बाहर जाना खतरे से खाली नहीं है.’\n\n‘आप तो बेवजह की चिंता पाल रहे हैं. मैं कोई छोटी बच्ची नहीं हूं, जो कोई रावण मुझे उठा कर ले जाएगा.’ ‘यह तुम नहीं तुम्हारा अहम बोल रहा है,’ समझाते हुए एक बार फिर राहुल बोला था, ‘जब से दिल्ली में चलती बस में निर्भया के साथ…’\n\n‘इस दुनिया में कितनी औरतें ऐसी हैं, जो अकेले ही नौकरी कर रही हैं…’ बीच में ही बात काटते हुए मीना बोली थी, ‘मैं तो बस गीत गा कर वापस आ जाऊंगी.’ यहां से उस की बूआ का घर\n\n3 किलोमीटर दूर है. वह आटोरिकशे में बैठ कर बूआ के यहां पहुंच गई थी. वहां जा कर राहुल को फोन कर दिया था कि वह बूआ के यहां पहुंच गई है. फिर वह बूआ के परिवार में ही खो गई. मगर अब रात को सड़क पर आ कर आटोरिकशे का इंतजार करना उसे महंगा पड़ने लगा था.\n\nजैसेजैसे रात गहराती जा रही थी, सन्नाटा पसरता जा रहा था. इक्कादुक्का आदमी उसे अजीब सी निगाह डाल कर गुजर रहे थे. जितने भी आटोरिकशे वाले गुजरे, वे सब भरे हुए थे. जब कोई औरत किसी स्कूटर के पीछे मर्द के सहारे बैठी दिखती थी, तब मीना भी यादों में खो जाती थी. वह इसी तरह राहुल के स्कूटर पर कई बार पीछे बैठ चुकी थी.\n\nआटोरिकशा तो अभी भी नहीं आया था. रात का सन्नाटा उसे डरा रहा था. क्या राहुल को यहां बुला ले? अगर वह बुला लेगी, तब उस की हार होगी. वह साबित करना चाहती थी कि औरत अकेली भी घूम सकती है, इसलिए उस ने राहुल को फोन\n\nनहीं किया. इतने में एक सवारी टैंपो वहां आया. वह खचाखच भरा हुआ था. टैंपो वाला उसे बैठने का इशारा कर रहा था. मीना ने कहा, ‘‘कहां बैठूंगी भैया?’’\n\nवह मुसकराता हुआ चला गया. तब वह दूसरे टैंपों का इंतजार करने लगी, मगर काफी देर तक टैंपो नहीं आया. तभी एक शख्स उस के पास आ कर बोला, ‘‘चलोगी मेरे साथ?’’\n\n‘‘कहां?’’ मीना ने पूछा. ‘‘उस खंडहर के पास. कितने पैसे लोगी?’’ उस आदमी ने जब यह कहा, तब उसे समझते देर न लगी. वह आदमी उसे धंधे वाली समझ रहा था.\n\nवह भी एक धंधे वाली औरत बन कर बोली, ‘‘कितना पैसा दोगे?’’ वह आदमी कुछ न बोला. सोचने लगा. तब मीना फिर बोली, ‘‘जेब में कितना माल है?’’\n\n‘‘बस, 50 रुपए.’’ ‘‘जेब में पैसा नहीं है और आ गया… सुन, मैं वह औरत नहीं हूं, जो तू समझ रहा है,’’ मीना ने कहा.\n\n‘‘तब यहां क्यों खड़ी है?’’ ‘‘भागता है कि नहीं… नहीं तो चप्पल उतार कर सारा नशा उतार दूंगी तेरा,’’ मीना की इस बात को सुन कर वह आदमी चलता बना.\n\nअब मीना ने ठान लिया था कि वह खाली आटोरिकशे में नहीं बैठेगी, क्योंकि उस ड्राइवर में अकेली औरत को देख कर न जाने कब रावण जिंदा हो जाए? ‘‘कहां चलना है मैडम?’’ एक आटोरिकशा वाला उस के पास आ कर बोला. जब मीना ने देखा कि उस की आंखों में वासना है, तब वह समझ गई कि इस की नीयत साफ नहीं है.\n\nवह बोली, ‘‘कहीं नहीं.’’ ‘‘मैडम, अब कोई टैंपो मिलने वाला नहीं है…’’ वह लार टपकाते हुए बोला, ‘‘आप को कहां चलना है? मैं छोड़ आता हूं.’’\n\n‘‘मुझे कहीं नहीं जाना है,’’ वह उसे झिड़कते हुए बोली. ‘‘जैसी आप की मरजी,’’ इतना कह कर वह आगे बढ़ गया.\n\nमीना ने राहत की सांस ली. शायद आटोरिकशे वाला सही कह रहा था कि अब कोई टैंपो नहीं मिलने वाला है. अगर वह मिलेगा, तो भरा हुआ मिलेगा. मगर अब कितना भी भरा हुआ टैंपो आए, वह उस में लद जाएगी. वह लोगों की निगाह में बाजारू औरत नहीं बनना चाहती थी. मीना को फिल्मों के वे सीन याद आए, जब हीरोइन को अकेले पा कर गुंडे उठा कर ले जाते हैं, मगर न जाने कहां से हीरो आ जाता है और हीरोइन को बचा लेता है. मगर यहां किसी ने उस का अपहरण कर लिया, तब उसे बचाने के लिए कोई हीरो नहीं आएगा.\n\nमीना आएदिन अखबारों में पढ़ती रहती थी कि किसी औरत के साथ यह हुआ, वह हुआ, वह यहां ज्यादा देर खड़ी रहेगी, तब उसे लोग गलत समझेंगे. तभी मीना ने देखा कि 3-4 नौजवान हंसते हुए उस की ओर आ रहे थे. उन्हें देख वह सिहर गई. अब वह क्या करेगी? खतरा अपने ऊपर मंडराता देख कर वह कांप उठी.\n\nवे लोग पास आ कर उस के आसपास खड़े हो गए. उन में से एक बोला, ‘यहां क्यों खड़ी है?’’ दूसरे आदमी ने जवाब दिया, ‘‘उस्ताद, ग्राहक ढूंढ़ रही है.’’\n\nतीसरा शख्स बोला, ‘‘मिला कोई ग्राहक?’’ पहले वाला बोला, ‘‘अरे, कोई ग्राहक नहीं मिला, तो हमारे साथ चल.’’\n\nमीना ने उस अकेले शख्स से तो मजाक कर के भगा दिया था, मगर यहां 3-3 जिंदा रावण उस के सामने खड़े थे. उन्हें कैसे भगाए? वे तीनों ठहाके लगा कर हंस रहे थे, मगर तभी पुलिस की गाड़ी सायरन बजाती हुई आती दिखी.\n\nएक बोला, ‘‘चलो उस्ताद, पुलिस आ रही है.’’ वे तीनों वहां से भाग गए. मगर मीना इन पुलिस वालों से कैसे बचेगी?\n\nपुलिस की जीप उस के पास आ कर खड़ी हो गई. उन में से एक पुलिस वाला उतरा और कड़क आवाज में बोला, ‘‘इतनी रात को सड़क पर क्यों खड़ी है?’’\n\n‘‘टैंपो का इंतजार कर रही हूं,’’ मीना सहमते हुए बोली. ‘‘अब रात को 11 बजे टैंपो नहीं मिलेगा. कहां जाना है?’’\n\n‘‘सर, सांवरिया कालोनी.’’ ‘‘झूठ तो नहीं बोल रही है?’’\n\n‘‘नहीं सर, मैं झूठ नहीं बोलती,’’ मीना ने एक बार फिर सफाई दी. ‘‘मैं अच्छी तरह जानता हूं तुम जैसी धंधा करने वाली औरतों को…’’ पुलिस वाला जरा अकड़ कर बोला, ‘‘अब जब पकड़ी गई हो, तो सती सावित्री बन रही हो. बता, वे तीनों लोग कौन थे?’’\n\n‘‘मुझे नहीं मालूम सर.’’ ‘‘झूठ बोलते शर्म नहीं आती तुझे,’’ पुलिस वाला फिर गरजा.\n\n‘‘मैं सच कह रही हूं सर. वह तीनों कौन थे, मुझे कुछ नहीं मालूम. मुझे अकेली देख कर वे तीनों आए थे. मैं वैसी औरत नहीं हूं, जो आप समझ रहे हैं,’’ मीना ने अपनी सफाई दी. ‘‘चल थाने, वहां सब असलियत का पता चल जाएगा. चल बैठ जीप में… सुना कि नहीं?’’\n\n‘‘सर, मुझे मत ले चलो. मैं घरेलू औरत हूं.’’ ‘‘अरे, तू घरगृहस्थी वाली औरत है, तो रात के 11 बजे यहां क्या कर रही है? ठीक है, बता, तेरा पति कहां है?’’\n\n‘‘सर, वे तो घर में हैं.’’ ‘‘मतलब, वही हुआ न… तू धंधा करने के लिए रात को अकेली निकली है और अपने पति की आंखों में धूल झोंक रही है. तेरा झूठ यहीं पकड़ा गया…\n\n‘‘अच्छा, अब बता कि तू कहां से आ रही है?’’ ‘‘बूआ के यहां गीतसंगीत के प्रोग्राम में आई थी सर. वहीं देर हो गई.’’\n\n‘‘फिर झूठ बोल रही है. बैठ जीप में,’’ पुलिस वाला अब तक उस पर शिकंजा कस चुका था. ‘‘ठीक है सर, अगर आप को यकीन नहीं हो रहा है, तो मैं उन्हें फोन कर के बुलाती हूं, ताकि आप को असलियत का पता चल जाए,’’ कह कर वह पर्स में से मोबाइल फोन निकालने लगी.\n\nतभी पुलिस वाला दहाड़ा, ‘‘इस की कोई जरूरत नहीं है. मुझे मालूम है कि तू अपने पति को बुला कर उस के सामने अपने को सतीसावित्री साबित करना चाहेगी. सीधेसीधे क्यों नहीं कह देती है कि तू धंधा करती है.’’ मीना की आंखों के आगे अंधेरा छाने लगा था कि तभी अचानक राहुल उसे गाड़ी से आता दिखाई दिया. उस ने आवाज लगाई, ‘‘राहुल… राहुल.’’\n\nराहुल पास आ कर बोला, ‘‘अरे मीना, तुम यहां…’’ अचानक उस की नजर जब पुलिस पर पड़ी, तब वह हैरानी से आंखें फाड़ते हुए देखता रहा.\n\nपुलिस वाला उसे देख कर गरजा, ‘‘तुम कौन हो?’’ ‘‘मैं इस का पति हूं.’’\n\n‘‘तुझे झूठ बोलते हुए शर्म नहीं आती,’’ पुलिस वाला अपनी वरदी का रोब दिखाते हुए बोला, ‘‘तुम दोनों मुझे बेवकूफ बना रहे हो. अपनी पत्नी से धंधा कराते हुए तुझे शर्म नहीं आती. चल थाने में जब डंडे पड़ेंगे, तब भूल जाएगा अपनी पत्नी से धंधा कराना.’’ यह सुन कर राहुल हाथ जोड़ता हुआ बोला, ‘‘आप यकीन रखिए सर, यह मेरी पत्नी है, बूआ के यहां गीत गाने अकेली गई थी. लौटने में जब देर हो गई, तब बूआ ने बताया कि यह तो घंटेभर पहले ही निकल चुकी है.\n\n‘‘जब यह घर न पहुंची, तब मैं इसे ढूंढ़ने के लिए निकला. अगर आप को यकीन न हो, तो मैं बूआ को यहीं बुला लेता हूं.’’ ‘‘ठीक है, ठीक है. तुम झूठ तो नहीं बोल रहे हो,’’ पुलिस वाले ने जरा नरम पड़ते हुए कहा.\n\n‘‘अकेली औरत को देर रात को बाहर नहीं भेजना चाहिए,’’ पुलिस वाले को जैसे अब यकीन हो गया था, इसलिए अपने तेवर ठंडे करते हुए वह बोला, ‘‘यह तो मैं समय पर आ गया, वरना वे तीनों गुंडे आप की पत्नी की न जाने क्या हालत करते. फिर आप लोग पुलिस वालों को बदनाम करते.’’ ‘‘गलती हमारी है. आगे से मैं ध्यान रखूंगा,’’ राहुल ने हाथ जोड़ कर माफी मांगते हुए कहा.\n\nपुलिस की गाड़ी वहां से चली गई. मीना नीचे गरदन कर के खड़ी रही.\n\nराहुल बोला, ‘‘देख लिया अकेले आने का नतीजा.’’ ‘‘राहुल, मुझे शर्मिंदा मत करो. रावण तो एक था, मगर इस 2 घंटे के समय में मुझे लगा कि आज भी कई रावण जिंदा हैं.\n\n‘‘अगर आप नहीं आते, तो वह पुलिस वाला मुझे थाने में बैठा देता,’’ कह कर मीना ने मन को हलका कर लिया.\n\n‘‘तो बैठो गाड़ी में…’’ गुस्से से राहुल ने कहा, ‘‘बड़ी लक्ष्मीबाई बनने चली थी.’’ मीना नजरें झुकाए चुपचाप गाड़ी में जा कर बैठ गई.'<br />Author: 'Ola-Uber'<br />id: 'j4c8yl'<br />Flair ::atalji: Hindi Poetry</li>

<li>Title: 'On 2nd Oct I am a follower of Mahatma Gandhi And Sardar Bhagat Singh Ji'<br />Body: 'Followers of these two have always tried to pull down the followers of each other. But I think India needs both the ideologies to function properly.\n\nOne side will simply say we don\'t support the violence.\n\nThe other side says Gandhi is given the whole credit of fighting for our independence. Because of him India got divided and he could have saved Bhagat Singh Ji. I agree Gandhi could have done better in handelling this particular case.\n\nNow I do subscribe to the idea of Akahnd Bharat and really hope someday we will get there and aware that Gandhi is also accused of favoring one religion over other at the time of partition. Also it is said that he had illicit relations with females, but don\'t know much about it.\n\nIt is said he even changed the song "Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram" and added/modified some of the verses, but isn\'t this the Indian culture that allowed us to have several versions of Ramayan depending on the time, social scenarios and current beliefs, same way he may have tried to create harmony changing the song between the two religions which was the root cause of partition in the first place.\n\nI have no problems(infact support) if pictures of other freedom fighters are used on currency notes.\n\nHad it not been for Gandhi, Indian people would not have come together so easily for any cause such as self employment, cleanliness, equality and also the right to freedom.\n\nNo doubt some of his choices could have been better but after all he too was a human and was bound with the situation at hand at that time. We do not know in what scenarios which decision was taken.\n\nIn the current time people are misusing his name to gain political advantage, but somehow they are ruining his name.\n\nIf Rabindranath Tagore calls him Mahatma, then he must have got something in him. If thousands of people start following his footsteps he must have got something in him.\n\nI may not have much idea about several of the things I said above about him, but one thing is for sure that it doesn\'t stop me to use Ji after his name, so Gandhi Ji.\n\nAs a citizen or followers we should acknowledge his failures and bad choices, nothing can stop for having respect for him.\n\nSome people will say I forgot Lal Bahar Shastri Ji, but no.\n\nSo happy Gandhi Jayanti, happy Shastri Jayanti, happy International Day for Non-violence.'<br />Author: 'NullandRandom'<br />id: 'j3lvc9'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li>

Posts like this really piss me of but whenever I get frustrated with these idiots I just remind myself that-\n\nNo matter how much anti-India propaganda these people spread, no matter how much they try to make us hate our very own country, the fact is they are powerless and they can’t do anything about the fact that BJP is going to get re-elected by winning 500+ seats in 2024 and we will have 5 more years of Modi. So my fellow REAL country loving Indians, never let these people make you doubt the fact that you were born in the greatest country in the world and that one day people from western countries will be dying to immigrate to India.

<li>Title: 'Fuck "muh free speech"'<br />Body: 'We are all horrified by the recent incident. I am also surprised by the amount of leftist parasites who are blaming all rape on Hinduism and Hindus. On reddit some of them are even calling for boycotts against India. They are the literal definition of traitors.\n\nWhy are we tolerating this? Why are these people not in jail?\n\nBefore anyone says "muh free speech", remember that has never applied to us Hindus. Indian leftist traitors and our other enemies have never tolerated our speech. The Indian right-wing\'s worship of "muh free speech" is a recent import from the American right-wing. Stop being like the American right-wing. American-style unlimited free speech will lead to the destruction of India.\n\nIf you want foreign inspiration look at Hungary, Poland and Russia. They are forcible closing down leftist traitor media and NGOs. That is the correct way to deal with the leftist virus growing in India.'<br />Author: 'metalflare'<br />id: 'j2vote'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li>
