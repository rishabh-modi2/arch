Only kṣatriyas, they were tax collector. And śūdra also, they had no property; therefore there was no tax. Only the vaiśya class, the productive class, they had to pay tax. And that tax also was very simple. There was no encroachment. You simply give one fourth of your profit to the government. That\'s all. No more tax. Sales tax, this tax, income tax, excise tax, this tax—simply tax, tax, tax. No. Not like that. Whatever he has got profit. "Got" means whatever profit he has made... If he has no profit, there is no tax. That was the government system. So how he will pay if he has not made any profit this year? Just like we are hearing there is no good monsoon in India this year. So there will be no very much good production. But if there is no good production, the government should not levy any tax. But now, at the present moment, "You go to hell, but you must pay the tax. And we divide the tax amongst ourself." That\'s all. Finished. Or we employ the taxes for fighting, for declaring war. That\'s all. So at the present moment we are in a very, very deplorable condition, no good government. Simply by changing, by so-called parties, the government cannot improve."\n\nSrila Prabhupāda Lecture on Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.3.20 at Los Angeles, September 25, 1972 https://prabhupadabooks.com/classes/sb/1/3/20/los_angeles/september/25/1972'<br />Author: 'sol1869'<br />id: 's8rszi'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm 🕉️</li><li>Title: 'Kya kare ab?'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'BringunHero'<br />id: 's8hxph'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: 'After a long time opened a Twitter account'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'parikshit95'<br />id: 's8hupc'<br />Flair :CKMKB_❤️ day ka Democracy 🇨🇳</li><li>Title: 'Important - Please think and give me your opinion'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'loopcorngaming'<br />id: 's8gcra'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Graphic Design Jobs'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Neurotransmitt'<br />id: 's8f1qq'<br />Flair :Wholesome Bakchodi :danklaugh:</li><li>Title: 'Har cheez Me randirona band karo...'<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ggrypox8csc81.jpg?width=304&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a75b77ee020fb3f94ee6726245625a32d9de0bc'<br />Author: 'frog_fucker3622-1111'<br />id: 's8c4pc'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: 'It’s so disappointing that /India does not reflect India at all, rather it’s a discussion for left wing political ideology.'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'babbsher'<br />id: 's8976l'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: 'Test'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'mustangboss8055'<br />id: 's8117r'<br />Flair :DawoodWood (Entertainment) 🎥</li><li>Title: "I'm a right winger trying to get into the comedy scene.
