<li>Title: 'Fight against Nationalism.'<br />Body: 'I have been thinking for a while about current political scenario around the world. From blatant opposition to Trump by big-tech to ignoring Bernie and actual Left of US and how it relates to India Here are my thoughts.\n\nThe current attack on "BJP" from west isn\'t related to the policies or the actual ground work of BJP as hardly any critical person would call it\'s policies and laws inherently bad or discriminatory. Neither the attack is on "India" as many would like to believe from \'Indic\' side. It\'s basically a war against Nationalism. \n\nAfter the second world war, the Nationalism in Germany and Italy was defeated by "Liberal Democracy" and "Communism". And after 1991, it was a ideological win for  "Liberal Democracy". If you look into recent history, there hasn\'t been any "Nationalist" president of US besides Trump. We all looked how everyone ganged to take him down. Was it because there was a liking for actual economical left? No. If that was the case, Bernie would be in the white house and not Biden.\n\nBut now the question arises why even be against \'Nationalism\' in the first place, why didn\'t west changed it\'s strategy and who is even against Nationalism? The answer is Nationalism is the only think standing against Globalists that want to break the barrier between countries. Nationalists are harder to deal with, as they will keep the country paramount. The only way for Rich to become more richer now is to gain more control over other countries, be it through lobbying or by helping politically and remember most of these rich people are in west. It is reflected on how the wall street who is economically right donated for Biden and not the "Right-winged" Trump. Most of the coups have happened only for the benefit of rich in west and the inward strategy of Trump wasn\'t liked by \'The Rich\'.\n\nModi is a Nationalist, that is hidden to no one. He has banned Chinese apps and even Facebook Free Basics. The only thing standing against this "Neo-colonalism" form west deep state is the sense of Nationalism with Aatm-Nirbharta and stuff. If tomorrow some party comes with more Nationalism, it would be criticized. We Indians realized it way to late about the British impact on India, this can be one of those things. It strange how Richie rich of west suddenly from being a colonizer turned to a bastian of democracy and human rights.

<li>Title: 'Are we really that great as hindus.'<br />Body: "We all know India as a country has been divided between different kingdoms and only a few actually tried to make it into one kingdom. But we weren't successful in maintaining it that way. And the fact that brahmins did persecute dalits and other minorities and by general public of the time. Now what we see is we do not have any option but too stick together or fall apart or become slaves to west ideology by giving up every aspect of our religion. When liberals put such arguments to right wing or nationalists like us how do we even justify all of this other than accepting that our religion did have some bad aspects to it which and that we are trying to compensate it with mixing western ideology of freedom for genders and whatnot which isn't bad, but are we as hindus really that great. I mean take sati as an example. I just need informed people to properly explain to me how we can as nationalist or right wingers have a great inclusive democratic nation when we ourselves have never even asked these questions ourselves and anyone can easily pick us apart."<br />Author: 'depressed2601'<br />id: 'lcmz19'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Hindu Jats (Idk how but Jats consider Pakistani Punjabis as their Bros).\n\nThe fondness of the Hindu Tamils wrt Prabhakaran is crazy. You are talking about Bhindranwale and his remaining memories within Sikhs ? It was not uncommon for us to see Prabhakaran's photo in Tamil temples just after he was executed in a SL army operation. \n\nBengalis retardedly think that India will balkanize and Bengal will unite together. \n\nPunjabis, well.they so fond of Pakistan that thry say that the partition was a blunder. \n\nJats ? Jats have started opposing the CAA, some leaders call for Hinduism to be left in favour of Buddhism. While others are basically unionists. \n\nI attribute this to a weak religuous identity among Hindus which makes us split along caste and tribe lines.

Gretas google doc was just one small piece of evidence.\n\nWe hindus need to coordinate on this.  and we can do so openly.\n\nIf some lawyer type people can pick an issue and post on chodi the full text of a complaint, and give the directions as to what to do (take a print out on plain paper, sign your name, attach a photocopy of your aadhar card etc, and go to the nearest police station and hand it over to the officer of such and such rank and take a receipt, and pay 1500 rupees filing fee, etc. etc. --- i am writing all of that wrong, but i want to give example of what the instructions should look like)... i am sure that many of us will follow it.\n\nI am not well aware of how the legal system works.  If instead of this, I need to go to a lawyer then I will do that.

<li>Title: 'The real reason for Global Support that Farm Protest got has 2 reasons:'<br />Body: "1. It was to create a new normal where Violent Protest become normalised. Shaheen Bagh was Beta test while this is the Version 1. Any sane State would have uprooted everything that undermines its Monopoly on Violemce. But Chacha wants to Noball prize. We are paying for their cowardice. West loves to use Democracy meme to undermine Majority snd empower Traitors in non white nations. Its given.\n\n2. Not many people know that we are producing too much grains and sugarcane which environmentally bad for us in long run with how erratic our Climate has become. Also the State gives incentive to harm the Air (stubble burning), water table(excessive use, rice/sugarcane), Free Electricity (wastage &amp; lead to Business paying higher tariffs to reduce losses), Soil(excessive use of fertilizer)\n\nWe are exporting our water.\n\nWhat Farm laws will do is that Farmers will start moving towards Vegetables which grows rapidly and has higher prices compared to Grains. This can easily solve our import of many Vegetables and can turn us into leading Exporter. With these laws more Cold warehouses and Food processing units will open as India has truly become 1 single market. West doesn't like it as it is major exporter of many Agricultural products. So to protect its Farmers is funding this insidious protests. Imagine Farmers growing legumes/dal instead of Rice, how much they'll earn? Same goes for vegetables.\n\nWe have highly fertile soil, 4 seasons and very low Wages so we can easily compete with West even when they've technology. We have more arable land so we can compete with them on total production if not on yield. This is what West fears as we will be able to undermine them and become major Exporter of agricultural products.\n\nFor reference when Chins banned US's Soyabean, US cried like a 2 year old.\n\nAlso it will increase the Farmer's Income multifold as with increase in Warehouses &amp; Cold Storage the prices will stabilise which will help both farmers and us consumers. \n\nAlso with cheap and easy availability of Insurance Schemes, Irrigation (Drip &amp; Canal), Seeds, Manures, Fertilizer, Power etc farming will effectively become risk free thus more men will have confidence to leave farming and try to get into Service &amp; Manufacturing sector. Lower risk will help farmers in availing grearer credit as they know what income they'll earn from their Produce. Women can take care of Farms and Men can go to city, which will increase their household income.\n\nAlso food processing units will unlock great value of our local products, take Makhaana for example which is grown in Seemanchal. Until few years ago not many people used to eat it but now it is one of the Superfood and the farmers are selling it at high price. We will be able to see a great and favourable change within few years, don't need to wait for even a decade.\n\n\nMy point being this is right hill for Modi to dye and unleash full blown asssaultt on Opposition."<br />Author: 'AwdheshMishra'<br />id: 'lcg3pp'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Because, they all follow *Zohnerism*!!!\n\n\nWhat is this notorious concept of  *Zohnerism*?\n\n\n *Zohnerism* -  is all about twisting of simple facts to confuse people!\nTo know more about it, please read this:\n\n\nIn 1997, 14 year old Nathan Zohner presented his science fair project to his classmates, seeking to ban a highly toxic chemical from its everyday use.\n\n\nThe chemical in question? Dihydrogen monoxide.\n\n\nThroughout his presentation, Zohner provided his audience scientifically correct evidence as to why this chemical should be banned.\n\n\nHe explained that dihydrogen monoxide:\n\n\nCauses severe burns while it’s in gas form.\n\n\nCorrodes and rusts metal.\n\n\nKills countless amounts of people annually.\n\n\nIs commonly found in tumors, acid rain etc.\n\n\nCauses excessive urination and bloating if consumed.\n\n\nZohner also noted that the chemical is able to kill you if you depend on it and then experience an extended withdrawal.\n\n\nHe then asked his classmates if they actually wanted to ban dihydrogen monoxide.\n\n\nAnd so, 43 out of the 50 children present voted to ban this clearly toxic chemical.\n\n\nHowever… this chemical isn’t typically considered toxic at all.\n\n\nIn fact, dihydrogen monoxide is simply H2O, which is nothing but water. \n\n\n\nNathan Zohner’s experiment wasn’t a legitimate attempt to ban water, but instead an experiment to get a representation of how gullible people can really be.\n\n\n\nAlso, all of the points that Zohner used to convey his point were 100% factually correct; he just skewed all of the information in his favour by omitting certain facts.\n\n\n\nIn recognition of his experiment, journalist James K. Glassman coined the term "Zohnerism" to refer to "the use of a true fact to lead a scientifically and mathematically ignorant public to a false conclusion".\n\n\n\nAnd this occurs a lot more often than you think, especially when politicians, conspiracy theorists, etc., use proven facts to persuade people into believing false claims and facts.\n\n\n\nThe fact that people can mislead, and be misled so easily, is highly unsettling.'<br />Author: 'BabuBhaiya84'<br />id: 'lc9eni'<br />Flair :Indo-International 📰</li>

I asked her to find celebrities who can bring "international attention" to India\'s groundwater depletion which is the highest in the world. Or to our fast eroding topsoil, the lack of fertility from broken fertilizer subsidy, or the corruption in grain procurement. Will any international celebrity speak up for vegetable farmers who don\'t get proper prices for their produce every year in mandis? Why not bring "international attention" to everything broken in Indian agriculture?\n\nTo this, she says that I\'m "ignoring the main problem at hand", Rihanna had only shared "an unbiased news article", "She just wanted to start a conversation", people "fear for their life" if they share a different opinion or criticize the leaders of this country, it is not right to make fun of Rihanna "because she just shared an opinion", and many other pointless arguments.

These tweets gained popularity really quickly and were a topic of discussion all over the world\n\nAdditionally, Greta Thunberg tweeted another tweet with a toolkit document which was a well-planned itinerary that had all information about planned TwitterStorm, On-Ground Protests, Social Media Campaign, Signing of Petitions and divesting Indian Business with exactly planned timestamps occurring in the month of January and February 2021.\n\nThis tweet was later deleted by Greta but the toolkit document shared by her has been archived and is [available here](https://archive.is/9oF4n).

MEAIndia shared a tweet corresponding to the same with a Twitter [\\#IndiaTogether](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IndiaTogether) and [\\#IndiaAgainstPropaganda](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IndiaAgainstPropaganda).

The Sikhs in the complex told them to remove their boots and did not allow them to go any further and that this resulted in the army firing upon innocent pilgrims. \nShe did not mention whether this was true or not because all the sources I looked into had nothing on this incident. She didn't speak about any other incident and made it look like that this single story was the entirety of Operation Blue Star.\nShe also did not mention the context for Operation Blue Star at all and made it sound like the army just barged into the Temple with no reason.\nI will say that the army did fire upon pilgrims fleeing from the complex but this does not mean that it was their intention of doing so.\n\nFor years I believed this story to be the truth and did not even bother to check it's authenticity. Only now when I looked into the operation did I come to know that what she was saying was a blatant lie. \n\nTo me this comes across as a blatant attempt at presenting us with false information and trying to get us to sympathise with the khalistani terrorists.

It\'s more like a legal document that dictates the relationship and modus oprendai between the state government and the central government and laws concerned to that state particularly. \n\nIt may seem as anti national to some but I think it will be a great idea to strengthen both the regional and national identity! \n\nIndia is a union of many kingdoms that have merged together to form a single sovereign entity. And I feel like refusing to express your states own culture and tradition on a legal level kills the diversity of India. If states actually take time and make their own "Constitution" And flags and nurture their own heritage and traditions on the state level as well as the nation narrative then the mindset of an individual will be happy for both his state and country.\n\nI get it that most (if not all Indians) hate the idea cuz of the Kashmir thing and a few stupid decisions of politicians to put the national flag below their own.

<li>Title: 'Aryan Migration is real'<br />Body: 'Out of India followers,Trolls stay out.\n\n\nIn\xa0archaeogenetics, the term\xa0Western Steppe Herders\xa0(WSH), or\xa0Western Steppe Pastoralists, is the name given to a distinct ancestral component that represents descent closely related to the\xa0Yamnaya culture\xa0of the\xa0Pontic-Caspian steppe.[a]\xa0This ancestry is often referred to as\xa0Yamnaya Ancestry,\xa0Yamnaya-Related Ancestry,\xa0Steppe Ancestry\xa0or\xa0Steppe-Related Ancestry.[4]\n\n\nScheme of\xa0Indo-European migrations\xa0from c. 4000 to 1000 BCE according to the widely held\xa0Kurgan hypothesis. These migrations are thought to have spread WSH ancestry and\xa0Indo-European languages\xa0throughout large parts of Eurasia.[1][2][3]\n\nWSHs are considered descended from\xa0Eastern Hunter-Gatherers\xa0(EHGs) who received some admixture from\xa0Caucasian Hunter-Gatherers\xa0(CHGs) during the\xa0Neolithic. The\xa0Y-DNA\xa0of the WSHs was mostly types of\xa0R1a\xa0and\xa0R1b, which are EHG lineages, suggesting that CHG admixture among the WSHs came through EHG males mixing with CHG females.[5]\xa0Around 3,000 BC, people of the\xa0Yamnaya culture, who belonged to the WSH cluster, embarked on a massive expansion throughout\xa0Eurasia, which might have resulted in the dispersal of\xa0Indo-European languages. WSH ancestry from this period is often referred to as\xa0Steppe Early and Middle Bronze Age\xa0(Steppe EMBA) ancestry.[b]\n\nThis expansion led to the rise of the\xa0Corded Ware culture, whose members were of about 75% WSH ancestry, and the virtual disappearance of the Y-DNA of\xa0Early European Farmers\xa0(EEFs) from the European gene pool, significantly altering the cultural and genetic landscape of Europe. During the\xa0Bronze Age, Corded Ware people with admixture from Central Europe remigrated onto the steppe, forming a type of WSH ancestry often referred to as\xa0Steppe Middle and Late Bronze Age\xa0(Steppe MLBA) ancestry.[b]\xa0Through the\xa0Sintashta culture,\xa0Andronovo culture\xa0and\xa0Srubnaya culture, Steppe MLBA was carried into\xa0Central Asia\xa0and\xa0South Asia\xa0along with\xa0Indo-Iranian languages, leaving a long-lasting cultural and genetic legacy.\n\nThe modern population of Europe can largely be modeled as a mixture of WHG (Western Hunter-Gatherer), EEF and WSH. In Europe, WSH ancestry peaks among\xa0Norwegians\xa0(ca. 50%), while in South Asia, it peaks among the\xa0Kalash people\xa0(ca. 50%) and\xa0Brahmins, according to Lazaridis et al. (2016).\xa0Narasimhan et al (2019), which employed a wider range of references in their ancestry models, found lower levels of steppe-derived ancestry among modern South Asians (e.g. ~30% among the Kalash).'<br />Author: 'PleaseAnyoneKillHim'<br />id: 'lbiigt'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Most of the protestors aren't paid actors, they are actual Punjabi farmers who don't want to give up their privilege and let farmers from other states become equal to them. \n\n\n2.  There ARE Khalistani sentiments in them, right now, whether it existed from the beginning or just gradually developed in them doesn't matter. \n\n\n3. They are not being misled, they know what they are doing and what consequences it can have, they aren't innocent children. The only ones being misled  are people on social media who are supporting them or thinking that the government actually wants to harm farmers of the country or is trying to benefit corporations. Anyone who says anything against farmers is called out, because farmers have been too glorified, due to which instead of directly calling out farmers, the critics of the protests said that they are being misled.\n\n\n4. No, it's not Pakistan's funding. Khaane ko paise nahi hai unke paas, humare yahaan kya dangey karwaayenge.\n\n\n\n5. The international celebrities who are supporting the protests are most probably not paid, they just believe that the protest is actually justified, peaceful, and necessary and that the bills are wrong. Most of the international media covering this is not telling the full story, and they are probably learning about the protests from these media outlets, and thus think they understand the situation or know the truth. \n\n\n\nDone, ab itna padh liya toh gaaliyaan dena shuru kar sakte ho.\n\n\n\nEdit: Three things bolne waala tha, lekin ab bolte bolte paanch ho gaye, title ke liye kshamaprarthi."<br />Author: 'thisusernamesucks43'<br />id: 'lbi65l'<br />Flair :Sab KHALISTAN Si</li>

It's just anti middle man as they will now be subject to taxation. The constant propaganda by NRIs not living in India needs to be answered. They don't live in India they have zero say as to what happens in India. People likes us deal with the consequences day in day out. Start to go out there and educate each and every farmer you guys come in contact with. The bill takes 20 minutes to read and.if you find any flaws point it out but I have read it have not found anything wrong. \n\nThis is our battle against these western NRIs who come to India for a month once every 3 years or so and can say what is right and wrong screw them. I have started to talk back to these  Indian NRI's cause screw them. They don't live here or pay taxes here so they have zero right over what we do and say. Time to support Modi and the Bill enough of waiting for govt to do something it's our battle for our future. What happens when they target our companies we loose our jobs not them. What happens when they start spreading communal disharmony we get affected not them. So, screw them and start speaking up for what is right.

<li>Title: 'Tax Reforms'<br />Body: ' I heard about Henery David Thoreau(he\'s an American philosopher) in 10th Standard. There was once an episode in his life where he had lived in the woods for many years and then came back to his town. For six years Thoreau did not pay his taxes. He asks, “When I meet a government which says to me, ‘Your money or your life,’ why should I be in haste to give it my money?” And so he went to jail — for a single night. “For someone” — probably his aunt — “interfered, and paid that tax.” This anecdote sets the tone for the rest of my article.\n\nI had been contemplating writing a piece on this touchy subject, but I had some time so here it goes.\n\nThe Income Tax Brackets(for salaried people) are computed largely on the basis of the Whole Sale price index and a multitude of other metrics and are rooted in a stupid principle called the broadest shoulders should bear the greatest burden.\n\nI know that Income Tax helps pay for the Defence needs, Subsidies to farmers etc but there has to be a change in the way these laws are formulated. Btw this is not my personal idea, it was put forward by Dr Subramanian Swamy on multiple occasions.\n\nThe govt should stop squeezing salaried people less. Just because my salary is a fixed number doesn\'t mean you get to take my money and if its a variable number they can hide in a multitude of ways.\n\nThe Whole Sale Price Index-based computation provides justification that since these are prices of the commodities and this is my salary, I can afford to pay x amount of my income as tax. I mean what kind of stupid logic is that. Who are you to decide what my standard of living should be and how much is enough for me?\n\nThe govt should modify these unrealistic tax brackets and revamp the whole tax structure which many intellectuals have been proposing for years together and this makes much more sense in the backdrop of COVID where prices keep increasing day by day.\n\nThe RBI changes the interest rates based on the inflation, why can\'t the govt change tax slabs to be variable as well. When the times are good and there is less inflation and overhead costs we can pay more and when there\'s inflation and added expenses it makes senses to pay less.\n\nThe kicker in the whole tax system is that I have to either stop spending to save money or spend even more (even if I don\'t want to) by taking out loans to save money which is bizarre and outright stupid.\n\nYou may think that are you the only person who thought of this, many before you have thought of this issue. The thing is if you stop asking pertinent questions issues like this become cold and people get accustomed to this and say "arey yaar ye sab chalta hai". My question is why is it acceptable.\n\nThis nonsensical system can be attributed to a lot of Indian legislature and laws being directly imported from the Raj days. And No subsequent government have made any inroads into this issue or at least try to address that this issue is a one worth discussing.\n\nQuite a few businesses can easily escape from the tax chopping block as they have multiple avenues to hide their revenue and launder it, make it harder for them to do that, don\'t give out bad loans only to watch them become bad debt and being written off.\n\nPlease change this obsolete system and replace it with a system that is rooted in reality and that takes the bigger picture into consideration and is more robust.'<br />Author: 'sprx7767'<br />id: 'l9xvs0'<br />Flair :Atmanirbhar Bharat :modi:</li>

Can we start fining people for throwing trash or spitting gutka where they think is alright. I believe there should be a legislation where people are fined for throwing trash in public places (if you catch some throwing trash click their picture and report them. After x amounts of reporting you get tax break or money or access to cheaper fuel for one day). Can we come with a better policy where plastic is easy to recycle, eg. Eliminating the stupid plastic cover on Coco cola, Pepsi, sprite and regular water bottle. Makes recycling 10x easier. Make the plastic potato chips bag into a paper one. Out right ban plastic bags and instead replace them with organic biodegradable ones. Encourages food stalls to use only wood and paper plates instead of single use plastic.

<li>Title: 'The Birth of Durga Devi and The Slaying of Mahishasura'<br />Body: 'To understand the birth of Durga-devi, first we should know why Durga-devi had to emerge in the first place.  \n\nThere were two asura siblings Rambha and Karambh, who were the grandsons of Brahmarshi Kashyapa. They craved power more than anything, and upon their mother Danu’s instructions, they performed tapasya(penance) so that they might obtain a boon from the devas.\n\nKarambh was unfortunately unsuccessful, and he was killed by Lord Indra.  \n\nHowever, Rambha was successful, and received a boon from Lord Agni. Lord Agni granted Rambha the boon of having a powerful son. One powerful enough to rule the three realms.  \n\nSoon after, Rambha fell in love with a she-buffalo asura named Mahishi and he married her. A male buffalo asura named Mahish burned with jealousy. He loved Mahishi, but Rambha taken her. So he tried to kidnap Mahishi.  \n\nRambha and Mahish fought a long and exhausting battle, but at the end, Rambha proved to be weaker than Mahish, and he was killed. Unfortunately for Mahish, he had been severely weakened due to the intense battle, and he was promptly killed by Rambha’s soldiers.  \n\nLater, when Rambha is being cremated, overcome with grief, the pregnant Mahishi jumps into the flames and prevents Lord Yama from taking Rambha with him.  \n\nFrom the flames emerged two asuras of immense power. Raktabeeja, who was Rambha reborn. And Mahishasura, the child of Rambha.\n\nMahishasura waged war on all of the asuras, and displaying his immense powers, he became the king of the asuras.  \n\nHowever, Mahishasura was too ambitious. He not only wanted be the king of the asuras, but the king of all the three realms. But he was not strong enough. His uncle Karambh had been very powerful as well, but Lord Indra killed him with a single stroke. As he was now, Mahishasura stood no chance against the devas.  \n\nRetiring to the mountains of Patala, Mahishasura performed a rigorous and hellish tapasya, praying to the Creator, Lord Brahma.  \n\nA great number of years would pass before Lord Brahma finally appeared before the asura.  \n\nHe said “Child! Your prayers have pleased me. Ask of me that which your heart desires.”\n\nMahishasura promptly said, “Lord, let me become immortal. May I have no fear from death!”\n\nLord Brahma smiled and said, “It is not possible. All creation must have an end. Immortality is not in my power to grant. Anything else, other than this impractical request, ask, and it shall be yours.”\n\nMahishasura said, “Since it is not possible for me to be immortal, may I not die at the hands of men. May I not die at the hands of my foes, the Devas. May I not die at the hands of the great Trinity. If death has to approach me, may it approach me only through a woman. Woman is weak, woman is powerless. How can a woman kill me, the all powerful Mahisha? If you grant me this boon, I shall be as good as immortal.”\n\nThe Lord said, “O best among the Asuras. You shall become all powerful among men and Devas. You shall lead a long life, but it shall come to an end, through the means of a woman. There is no escaping fate. You shall not die, except at the hands of a woman.”\n\nAfter the Creator disappeared, Mahishasura looked to the skies and roared with evil laughter that rang through the earth.  \n\nGathering his armies, the terrible asura launched an assault on the Earth. After conquering the whole Earth, the insatiable Mahishasura set his sights on the heavens. He attacked Amaravati, the abode of Lord Indra.  \n\nThe war between devas and asuras lasted a hundred years, but Mahishasura had been blessed by Lord Brahma that no deity would be able to defeat him. Even Lord Indra’s mighty thunderbolt proved useless. This thunderbolt that slew the mighty serpent Vritra. This thunderbolt that destroyed half of the Himalayas in a single shot. This thunderbolt barely tickled Mahishasura.  \n\nThe Devas had lost, and with no other choice, they approached Lord Brahma, who took them to Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva.  \n\nThey explained how Mahishasura had snatched the rights of the Surya, Indra, Agni, Vayu, Somnath, Yama, Varuna and other devas, and has made the heavens his new home.\n\nNow, the homeless devas roamed on earth like ordinary humans as they had nowhere to go. The devas spoke of how they were now counting on the Holy Trinity to save them from this misery.  \n\nBut due to Lord Brahma’s boon, even Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva would not be able to defeat Mahishasura. It had to be done by a woman.  \n\n“But there is no such woman!”, Indra said.  \n\nLord Vishnu smiled. “Then we shall make one.”\n\nFrom Lord Vishnu, a divine beam of light emitted. Following suit, Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva also emitted blindingly divine light.  \n\nSuddenly understanding what to do, Indra and the other devas followed suit and emitted divine light of their own.  \n\nThe divine light from the Trinity and the devas converged into a blazing star that lit up all the three worlds. Unmatchable, immense, immeasurably powerful energy spewed out of the star in all four directions.  \n\nThe Devas were amazed by this exceedingly massive, infinite power that dwarfed anything the universe had ever seen.  \n\nThis infinitely powerful energy condensed into the form of a woman.  \n\nThe light of Shiva formed her face.    \nThe light of Yama gave her long, lustrous hair.    \nThe light of Vishnu gave her ten powerful arms.    \nThe light of Somnath formed her breasts.    \nThe light of Varuna formed her thighs and calves.    \nThe light of the Bhudevi(Earth) formed her hips and behind.  \nThe light of Brahma formed her feet.  \nThe light of Surya formed her toes.    \nThe light of the Vasus(children of Ganga-devi) formed her fingers.  \nThe light of Kubera formed her nose.    \nThe light of Prajapati formed her teeth.    \nThe light of Vayu formed her ears.  \nThe light of the Sandhyas(Devas of sunrise and sunset) formed her two eyebrows.    \nThe light of Agni formed her three eyes.  \n\nFrom the light of these devas, as well as countless others, the Great Durga Devi was born.  \n\nThe gods then gifted the goddess with their weapons and other divine objects to help her in her battle with the demon, Mahishasura. Lord Shiva gave her a copy of his Trishula while Lord Vishnu gave her a copy of his Sudarshana Chakra.  \n\nVaruna, gave her a conch and noose, and Agni gave her a spear. From Vayu, she received arrows. Indra, gave her a thunderbolt, and the gift of his white-skinned elephant Airavata was a bell. From Yama, she received a sword and shield and from Vishwakarma (god of Architecture), an axe and armor.  \n\nThe god of mountains, Himavat gifted her with jewels and a lion to ride on. Durga was also given many other precious and magical gifts, new clothing, and a garland of immortal lotuses for her head and breasts.\n\nThe beautiful Durga, bedecked in jewels and golden armor and equipped with the fearsome weaponry of the gods, was ready to engage in battle with the fierce and cruel Mahishasura. Her lion\'s thunderous roars shook the three worlds. Oceans boiled and surf poured overland. Continents were torn at their granite foundations as whole new chains of mountains rose, while older ranges crumbled, cracked, and gave way to dust in a thousand landslides. Mahishasura and his demon allies found their attention drawn from heaven to Earth, as Durga\'s power moved its way towards heaven. Though confident of their power and control in heaven, the demons could not help being awestruck.\n\nAs Mahishasura\'s armies were struck down effortlessly by Durga, it became obvious to him that he was not as secure in heaven as he had thought. No demon could fight her and win. Her breath would replenish her armies – bringing back to life all of her soldiers who fell. From Airavata\'s gift, the bell, came a confusing clamor. The demons were in chaos and were easily defeated and captured. The ground was left littered with the broken limbs and body parts of the defeated demon army.\n\nMahishasura was shocked and enraged by the disastrous events on the battlefield. He took on the form of a demonic buffalo, and charged at the divine soldiers of Durga, goring and killing many and lashing out with his whip-like tail. Durga\'s lion pounced on the demon-buffalo and engaged him in a battle. While he was thus engaged, Durga threw her noose around his neck.\n\nMahishasura then assumed the form of a lion and when Durga beheaded the lion, Mahishasura escaped in the form of a man who was immediately face to face with a volley of arrows from Durga. The demon escaped yet again and then having assumed the form of a huge elephant, battered Durga\'s lion with a tusk. With her sword Durga hacked the tusk into pieces.\n\nThe demon reverted once more to the form of the wild buffalo. He hid himself in the mountains from where he hurled boulders at Durga with his horns. Durga drank the divine nectar, the gift of Kubera. She then pounced on Mahishasura, pushing him to the ground with her left leg. She grasped his head in one hand, pierced him with her sharp trident held in another, and with yet another of her ten hands she wielded her bright sword, beheading him. At last he fell dead, and the scattered surviving remnants of his once invincible army fled in terror.\n\nThe Gods bowed to the goddess and showered their praises on the goddess following her victory:\n\n"Mother, you have created this universe. You are the strength of all. Devatas (Gods), Rishis (sages), Yakshas (demi-gods), Kinnaras (heavenly musicians with human bodies and heads of horses) all bow to you. Even Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwar (Lord Shiva) do not know you fully. For the Dharmik (righteous) you are Lakshmi (Goddess of wealth), for the adharmiks (evil) you are Alakshmi (she who brings misfortune). You are buddhi (knowledge), you are lajja (modesty), you are shraddha (respect). You were there always and will be there forever. You are the adhar (source) for all, You are Prakriti (nature).

How the hell do liberals expect us to overlook this ? why does the supreme court not take this into consideration ? Also, Hinduism is the only thing that most people in most states innately have in common. Neither do we all speak the same language, nor do we have the same sub-cultures, clothing, food, literature, empires or history (pre-1947). We have unique regional characters and are an extremely intricate and complex society. Abrahamic religions by their very nature will always try to straitjacket our society as they are fixated on unity. Since there is no unity in diversity they will cut quantity for quality to make it happen. They are dualist, conformist and orderly. They have no patience or consideration for our pluralistic world view. They are just not viable for India. If they reach a significant enough population, their respective thresholds for harmony will break, making them more emboldened, pushing them to consolidate their positions and push further and further until none of us are left and rip the country is ripped apart in the process. Now if we jeopardize our only pan identity, what do we relate to each other with ? To those armchair philosophers and 'rational' atheists who say, 'religion doesn't matter only constitution does' Why do you think Kashmir is an issue ? why do you think that the NE are so disconnected and feel so distant from mainland India ? Why for that matter are Khalistan or Dravida Nadu even being entertained at a political level ? Do these places have an entirely separate constitution ? The sheer lack of grit of our people to get our asses in order is so frustrating. Our first priority should be banning dubious NGOs which are just front businesses for evangelical and groups to launder money and run their illicit hot gospel conversion racketeering.

I  got into depression, did nothing for 4 years.My career was over even  before starting.  \nLuckily I got into this business with my fathers  client and boom I will be earning 10x of what I would have ever earned  in job. My father financed it. Till now I dont really know much about  that business. I am still leaning. But its easy. I get so much time in  my hand now.\n\nI am still studying  another course side by side but I dont feel like having any career now. I  feel like a huge burden got off my head to have a career and get a job.\n\nIs it ok to not have a career?  \nI  want to learn musical instrument, learn to box, cycle everywhere,  meditate, draw something and travel. But I dont want to master all these  thing. I just want to fill in my time.\n\nIs  it ok to be so easy towards life? I feel like I am again taking  everything casually. I feel guilty of not working hard for something.  When I see my friends working hard in their job and studies.'<br />Author: 'okbrok'<br />id: 'l8t60l'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Is Democracy actually suited to India?'<br />Body: 'I actually don’t think Democracy is the right form of government for India. The main reason why I believe this is because all policies, laws or decisions that government makes are to have political gains. No matter which party forms the government, winning the elections has become their main priority. All the policies are made for the vote banks of the political party, and not for the overall benefit of the country. Politics based on religion, caste, still exist only because the government fear of losing the next election. \n\nI think if a government doesn’t make a law which is actually beneficial for the country, only because of the fear of losing the next election then that’s not at all justified. What I believe is that a single person should rule the entire country for a particular duration of time without being afraid of getting voted off in the next election. A committee should be made to guide that person, but the ultimate power should lie in that one person’s hand. All that we would have to do is find that one person who can run a country without being self-centered and with a dedication to India and its diversity. \n\nThis may be sounding absurd but I say this because I don’t think any party currently existing in India has any motivation than to have personal gains. We have to agree that people of India are not so well educated to fully understand politics and are often used by political parties to win elections. Also, it takes infinite time to make a law or give justice to a case. No firm policies are made. No one follows the law. Even anti-national elements are entertained in the country. \n\nI am not taking side of any political party. I just said what I wanted to say. I don’t exactly know the alternative if not democracy, but I sure believe that democracy is not the form of government suited for India. Maybe a new type of Govt., After-all Democracy is an age-old concept.'<br />Author: 'shinigami0099uyyuo'<br />id: 'l8me3z'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'How to contact Modi Ji?'<br />Body: 'I have seen lot of people being frustrated and ranting on the subreddit about the state of hindus, India and how BJP is not doing anything on the root level (eg. narrative building or supporting scholars, researchers, youtubers, journalists, think tanks etc). I get their concern and frustration, because I feel the same helplessness. \n\nWe are posting these rants on this sub. No doubt these posts help keep the fire of patriotism and sense of duty toward rashtra and dharam ignited within the people who genuinely want our country to be a "Vishwa guru". But my concern is that these posts are only limited to the members of this sub. The voice and cry of people like us should and must reach the people in power who can be the catalyst of the indic renaissance.  These powerful people can be at political, bureaucratic and economical positions.\n\nI am not confident if this is the case. According to my reading of all these protests and 6 years of the govt. there is no significant narrative building by Modi Ji or the BJP. They are always in the trap of "western media kya kahegi" (I hope I am wrong).  One guy earlier posted that the farmers in UP are thinking the govt. will take away their lands. This is the miscommunication between the citizens and the govt. You cannot always blame the oppositions and vested interest groups for spreading misinformation among the people. If they are drawing a 10 cm line then you have to draw 11 cm line. I want to say if they (western media + communists + islamist + khalistanis + ISI + evangelists + chinese+ ghar ke bhedi) are making a narrative about us (hindus and BJP govt), then we have to counter that narrative with our own narrative which is currently lacking.  If not then we are trying to fight a loosing battle.\n\nAt last I want to  ask all of you, please if you have family members or connections in BJP or govt. or IAS or big business houses, please ask them to convey the concerns to the BJP high command. Also how can we send these rants directly to modi ji, amit shah, yogi ji etc so they are made aware of the will of the sanatanis.'<br />Author: 'helloworld090'<br />id: 'l7n010'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: 'Hindu Weakness'<br />Body: 'This is somewhat of a rant but bear with it.  I\'m sick and tired of seeing posts on social media by so-called right wingers about how great India is for providing millions of vaccines to countries like Banglastan (where they regularly destroy temples and kill Hindus) and Nepal (which is an anti-Hindu communist state).  These countries will take a photo with Modi then go back to persecuting Hindus, and that genius will continue to ignore the persecution of Hindus and serve them like a dog.  India doesn\'t need these countries and they wouldn\'t help India even if it did need them.\n\nThe fundamental mistake Hindu losers make is that they think others see an act of kindness as just that and not a weakness to be taken advantage of.  This is easily observed in personal interactions as well.  No one likes the nice guy no matter how much he bends over for people who hate him.  They will use him then laugh at him.  This is also evident with the way the filthy leftists treat Modi despite all the good things he has done.  They will always slander him and Hindus so why not just be "oppressive right wing Hindus" like they portray us to the world?  Modi has done a lot of good for Hindus, but he still seems to have the "Hindu" mentality of a slave and not that of an Aryan.\n\nThis isn\'t even to mention that several more will die in India because those doses could have gone to them (India isn\'t a rich country where it can afford to hand out doses to everyone without opportunity costs; it is a zero sum game).  Why the hell is a so-called right wing Hindu party continuing to be pacifist pushovers without any sense of shame?  Are they really that stupid? Now is the time to be aggressive.  We need more of Yogi Adityanath (and even more fierce than him).\n\nTo add to this, when close to 3 million Hindus were killed and hundreds of thousands raped in Banglastan in 1971 (yes, just 50 years ago), and Indian soldiers could have punished porkis and bongis and conquered the land, why did we give it up and do nothing (a vast Hindu majority voted for Indira gandi\'s party of deshdrohis or other leftist parties and continued to do so).  Are Hindus really that dumb?  After millenia of buddu, goat-loving, and rice-bag rule, why are Hindus so self-defeating and dense?  Animals have much higher self-preservation instincts than 90% of Hindus.  Even now, the majority of Hindus vote for anti-Hindu parties.  You don\'t see this level of self-hatred and stupidity anywhere else in the world or in any other community.'<br />Author: 'Arya4948'<br />id: 'l7mcu2'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

<li>Title: 'The Story Of The Shiva Tandava Stotra'<br />Body: "We all know that King Rāvana was a great devotee of Lord Shiva. Some of you might even know that the Shiva Tandava Stotra was composed by Ravana. But how and why? Let us go through the events. \n\nThe events happen a long time ago, before the events of the Ramayana. \n\n&gt;Rāvana, who was then known as Dashanan was flying around the universe in his Pushpak Vimana. But when he got near a certain spot, his Pushpaka Vimana abruptly stopped.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Dashanan was disturbed by this. This had never happened before. So he went to investigate. He soon found that it was due to Mount Kailash that his Pushpaka Vimana had stopped.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Mountain(Kailash) asked Dashanan to change his route since Lord Shiva and Devi Parvati are resting on the top of the mountain.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Of course, Dashanan did not listen. He dismissed the mountain's words and lifted the mountain to move it somewhere else. Due to his immense strength, this was even possible. For a moment, Kailash was lifted, and the universe was in imbalance as Kailash is said to be the center of the universe.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;As you can imagine, Lord Shiva was not pleased. In fact, he was furious that someone dared to try and move *him* from his place. As much as he is Bholenath(*one who is easily pleased*), perhaps Dashanan forgot that Lord Shiva is also Bhairava(*the manifestation of pure rage*).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lord Shiva stopped meditating and placed one toe on the ground. The pressure from Shiva's toe sent Dashanan straight to Patala. The pressure from Shiva's toe caused immense pain to Dashanan and *his cry of pain shook the three worlds***.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Raav/Rāv means 'crying in agony', and since this cry of agony shook the three worlds, Lord Shiva gave Dashanan a new name. Rāvana.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, Shiva did not lift his toe. He kept it pressed to the ground, and even Rāvana with all his strength was not able to even budge it.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Rāvana realized he had greatly angered Lord Shiva, and upon the advise of Narada Muni, he chanted stotras for 14 days straight, begging for Lord Shiva's forgiveness, but Lord Shiva still did not lift his toe.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;On the 14th day it was Pradosha, and during the sunset, Rāvana chanted the Shiva Tandava Stotra with such devotion and perfect rhythm that Devi Parvati felt pity for Rāvana and asked Lord Shiva to free him. Lord Shiva finally lifted his toe from the ground. \n\nThis is a link to the Shiva Tandava Stotra: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_crtZ3lSXqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_crtZ3lSXqY)\n\nThe Shiva Tandava Stotra and the meaning of each verse:\n\n&gt; Jatatavigalajjala pravahapavitasthale  \nGaleavalambya lambitam bhujangatungamalikam  \nDamad damad damaddama ninadavadamarvayam  \nChakara chandtandavam tanotu nah shivah shivam\n\nWith his neck consecrated by the flow of water that flows from his hair,  \nAnd on his neck a snake, which is hung like a garland,  \nAnd the Damaru drum that emits the sound “Damat Damat Damat Damat”,  \nLord Shiva did the auspicious dance of Tandava.
