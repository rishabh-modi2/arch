<li>Title: 'Why is the solution pertaining to Hindu festivals banning them rather than coming up with innovative techniques?'<br />Body: "This has been ingrained to us since childhood regarding Hindu festivals, we have been told that it promotes this evil and that in our society from pollution to harming birds during Makar Sakranti.\n\nBanning these industries justified with emotional blackmailing has been forced onto us as if that is the only the viable solution. But certainly more is at stake, banning industries literally implies throwing millions out to fend for themselves with society against them, with no means of learning new techniques in a such a short span of time to support their livelihood, also millions lost in GDP. And when the numbers come out, we act shocked when the numbers for GDP and employment are lesser than last year. \n\nWhile the rhetoric with Makar Sakranti is that it hurts birds so ban it?, rather look at why it hurts birds, the rope used is Chinese and of a cheap material which literally cuts things, rather cotton threads or other strong but not-lethal threads can be promoted rather than stupidly banning entire festivals.\n\nComing to Diwali, if pollution is such a serious offence, then let us statistically counter this question, higher GDP numbers require higher production(not considering crackers atm), production of any kind requires pollution, so higher the production higher the pollution. Are the environmentalists willing to cut back on their purchases (be it laptops, mobile phones etc.) throughout the year if they really care for the environment, I don't really think so, being the hypocrites they are, I have effectively shut up one such environmentalist in my college. But ofc they hit you up with other emotional stories(such as scared street dogs(we don't hunt dogs to burst at them, due to ingrained survival, they can, and do go away to more open spaces), asthmatic patients(traffic jams sure can be a bummer, anyway its a holiday and nighttime, sit tight at home and hear the boom-boom), and people scared of blinking lights and loud sounds(then good luck surviving outside at nighttime)) so the blame always shifts to us and our traditions. We need to focus on the ethics of Diwali rather than answering as per their narratives.\n\nAnother one I hear is child labour in such industries and people dying due to ingestion of gunpowder, thus the industry should be shut. With this logic, more than half of India's industries could be shut. Again the real problem here is lack of sanitation, proper tools at the dispersal of the workers. And we know how child labour NGOs really work. Was the industry pertaining to Bhopal Gas tragedy shut down, or was more careful inspection and safer environment for workers for industries the need that arose out of it. \n\nAll of this has one motive, to finish the source of income for practicing lower income Hindus and further plunge Bharat into recessions, thus making them effective targets of conversions, further lowering incomes of local Hindu temples, meanwhile successfully carrying out cultural subversion at bureaucratic level, thus systematically making us and our culture more irrelevant and inert.\n\nLike I have said before, we as a Hindu community, lack unity in sense of doing groundwork, online unity is fine, but how serious are we to gather like the Karsevaks of the 90s and sway the government working in our way, for once when this is achieved we would not be cribbing about cracker ban instead only see pseudo-environmentalists aka liberals do so.\n\nMemes and all are fine but if we have such a serious and niche platform for us, let's use it and fight the Adharmis not only online but also through offline work (eventually each member of this subreddit finding other Sanghis in their city and forming a Mitra Mandali or an effective social group, how the mods or even us decide to form city wise groups is up for another discussion)\n\nJai Hind, Jai Bharat."<br />Author: 'brown_vandamme'<br />id: 'juncf1'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: 'Crackers and Delhi'<br />Body: "This is probably going to ge downvoted to oblivion but the ignorance I've seen going around subs I frequent has irked me enough to write this up. Before you read this and just downvote and scroll past, I urge you to continue reading.\n\nDelhi is infamous for its Air Quality which is a direct consequence of Automobile emissions, smoke from stubble burning etc. Just from this the air quality has already taken a hit and is constantly in hazardous or very unhealthy criteria in most of the parts.\n\nPersonally, I love bursting crackers. So much that I've missed them dearly every Diwali over the course of 4 years I've been in South India for my college studies. But is it responsible on my part to burst crackers in a city which deals with hazardous AQI levels on a constant basis? The fault is with the Government obviously, and I hate that because of them I've developed a feeling of moral responsibility to not burst crackers so as to keep the already elevated pollution levels in check, but do we have to make it worse before we get it better?\n\nNow, coming onto personal experience, AQI in my area was maxed out at 999 at 8pm itself and the cracker bursting went till 2am. I have an itchy lump in my throat but no other visible discomfort than that. A fellow redditor has pointed out that it could just be a placebo effect but even if it is, you can't deny that there wont be any unhealthy consequences from an air quality so poor.\n\nTL;DR If you belong to the woke mentality gang looking for a post showcasing cracker bursting on diwali as a main cause for pollution or animal discomfort in this sub, sorry but you're braindead. I might advise going to a good doctor.\n\nI'd urge the rest of you to read the entire thing."<br />Author: 'meyunkrye'<br />id: 'juiyit'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

My simple point: human rights and democracy will be one among many foreign policy concerns in a Biden administration. Not the top issue, but not entirely absent either. (Possible, perhaps, to discuss without ad hominem attacks.) \n\nPratyasha Reply:  Of course I read it.  N there's no 'attack' I made. There's a tendency among many to get that benevolent gaze of the white ruler on lesser mortals coz the democracy here is not considered good enough. The piece did read like that and saying that should not be considered an attack.  Also, I did make a diff point there that irrespective of the itch to interfere (if at all), it is not like the US themselves have the legitimacy to do it. We are also seeing how democratic and egalitarian their own society is, for them to come and interfere in our internal matters \n\nDhume:  Thanks. I don’t think the US can “interfere” in India. But it does get to decide its own foreign policy priorities, and it’s pretty clear that Biden (unlike Trump) cares about the decline of liberal democracy worldwide, including (dramatically) in India. \n\nPratyasha Reply:  Well then, he shd care about his own country n the systemic racism among other issues there. There's no dramatic erosion of democracy in India but the world is seeing what happened in the US this past year.  In fact, we shd care about it and express our concern about that decline! \n\n A man who was part of an administration that started wars in multiple countries, should not be the one anyone looks up to, for concern on the decline of democracy.

They post their annoying Instagram stories, debate about rights, write poetry and rebel against the so-called system, only to join it after they leave college? How many so called \'leftists\' have you known who\'ve left their college to join the corporate world (capitalism is bad) ? How many of their protests have actually changed anything? How many of their open debates have helped the people they are supposed to,except in adding CV points to the debaters? (See: Extracurricular Activities - "Active debater who has won many accolades, skilled in public speaking") \n\nTheir hypocrisy is disgusting. \n\nUnfortunately I\'ll have to end up in such a college, and I\'ll have to deal with such people and fit in. Some if my school friends have already dipped their toes in hypocrisy and they expect me to be like them. I can feel a distance between my old friends already because of their unwillingness to accept my views and my unwillingness to accept them as anything other than hypocrites. \n\nI\'ll be in a new social structure in college, and I don\'t want my political views completely decimating any meaningful relationships I\'ll have. \n\nCan anyone offer me any advice?

If left to me I won\'t watch the channel and you may differ in ideology but* ***Constitutional courts will have to protect such freedoms...*****"**\n\nHere are point made by Justice Chandrchud,\n\n**1. On the limits of defining "abetment of suicide"**\n\nIt may be recalled that Goswami stands accused of abetting interior designer, Anvay Naik\'s suicide on account of failing to pay dues owed. In this context, Justice Chandrachud queried.\n\n"*We are assuming the allegations of FIR as gospel truth but even then, is a case of Section 306 made out?* ***In a matter like this when some dues was not paid, would a suicide mean abetment? Would it not be a travesty of justice if someone is denied bail for this?***\n\nNoting further that the deceased is stated to have been under mental stress, the Judge also remarked,\n\n"*For Section 306, abetment there needs to be actual incitement. Does one owes money to another and they commit suicide - would it be abetment?"*\n\n**2. Constitutional Courts should protect liberty**\n\nJustice Chandrachud proceeded to remark,\n\n"*If we don\'t interfere in this case today, we will walk on path of destruction. If left to me I won\'t watch the channel and you may differ in ideology but* ***Constitutional courts will have to protect such freedoms...*****"**\n\nThe Judge recounted, during the hearing,\n\n"*A woman was hauled up for a tweet in West Bengal as she criticised the lockdown enforcement. She was issued summons under 41A. Is this fair? This cannot happen.*"\n\nHe added,\n\n"Forget Arnab Goswami for a moment, we are a Constitutional court.... If we as a Constitutional Court do not lay down law and protect liberty, then who will?"*Justice DY Chandrachud*\n\n**3. High Court has not dealt with the basic question**\n\nJustice Chandrachud remarked, on this aspect,\n\n*"****Here, is there an active incitement to suicide? Can you say that it is a case for custodial interrogation?*** *High Court has written 56 pages order but had not dealt with the basic question...* ***was an offence made out prima facie?***\n\n**4. If you don\'t like a channel, don\'t watch it**\n\nThe Court today also witnessed arguments made for Goswami that the case lodged against him was politically motivated in view of reports carried by Republic TV, where he is editor-in-chief.\n\nJustice Chandrachud observed,\n\n"*Victim* (Naik\'s family) *is entitled to recourse as in proper and fair probe. But* ***answer is simple. If you don\'t like a channel then don\'t watch it…****Government needs to ignore all of this and we don\'t think elections don\'t depend on all this.*\n\n**5. All should be responsible in matters of free speech**\n\nAppearing for the State of Maharashtra, Senior Advocate **Kapil Sibal** pointed out that the freedom of speech and expression is subject to reasonable restrictions.\n\n"*Article 19 (1)(a) is not an absolute right",* Sibal said.\n\nJustice Chandrachud responded,\n\n"*When this matter was before the CJI, CJI said in a subtle way that* ***responsibility is on all the sides."***\n\n**6. Not a terror case**\n\nAppearing for the State, Senior Advocate **Amit Desai** also submitted that Goswami appeared to have *chosen* a forum suited to him, rather than proceed with an ordinary bail application before the sessions court.\n\nDesai said, "*The petitioners filed a bail application before the Magistrate and then withdrew this and chose a forum that suited them.*"\n\nJustice Chandrachud, however, responded **"***Technicality, this cannot be a ground to deny someone personal liberty. This is not a case of terrorism.*\n\nTaken from,\n\n[https://www.barandbench.com/news/litigation/arnab-goswami-bail-hearing-justice-chandrachud-observations](https://www.barandbench.com/news/litigation/arnab-goswami-bail-hearing-justice-chandrachud-observations)'<br />Author: 'Zura0700'<br />id: 'js6d8i'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

The highly paid scientists causually pass it off for use (remembering failed mars mission). In many organizations, scientists produce virtually nothing of importance. DRDO is the one that produced Bio-toilets for railways. I by no sense mean to critisize the usefulness of those toilets in proper sanitation, water conservation and environment protection, but they should be really be working on advanced weapon and intelligence systems while there are government funded microbiological research institutes who should be one doing the former.'<br />Author: 'bhagwa_sevak'<br />id: 'jrm6bg'<br />Flair ::modi: aatmanirbhar</li>

So Babudom together with Neta, NGT et. al. prescribe severe restrictions or outright banning on fireworks right before Diwali\n2. Small time businesses, who might have paid 20-25 lac towards payments are looking at losses.\n3. Ultimately these cascade towards Sivakasi, a major fireworks manufacturing hub in TN.\n4. From next year onwards, businesses are more hesitant around this time to invest in fireworks. Uncertainty is not desirable here.\n5. If not contested by Hindus, fireworks gets increasingly muted during Diwali.\n6. There, in Sivakasi, many (not all) business close.\n7. Loss of a major employing industry make many people jobless and therefore destitute.\n8. A perfect opportunity for rice bags to go Brrrr...\n9. Having experimented in Coastal areas (Tuticorin, Kanyakumari), it is now time to target the hinterlands (although many such projects have already been executed there).\n10.

Now this is certainly a win for NRIs not Indians. Just like someone said before in a comment i read. Chinese Americans vote for China. Indian Americans vote for themselves. Now its not some surprise that NRIs tend to carry self hatred more than anyone else. They try to compete and belittle other Indians, as well as put up with ‘we’re better than you’ mentality. Biden coming up is a green light for them. As well as for all people who were literally crying to get immigration policy reforms. The next 4 years is gonna involve a shitload of Indians immigrating to fulfil their ‘American Dream’. \n\n2. Its a win for China. Biden isn’t doing shit against China. Its guaranteed. So thats a bad news for India from many angles. \n\n3. Some people are literally talking about empowerment of interracial relationships. Now this sounded stupid. They say that Biden winning would ensure that they’d get to date out of their race freely. And there were some NRIs/Indians saying that more white women would be available to date for them (bruh wtf). \n\n4. Immigration Policies. Biden vows to dismantle trump’s policy and increase the no. of refugees being allowed to US per year. Its around 11K now. It was 110K before. Biden is gonna make it 125K refugees per year. \n\n5. Rise in White Supremacist/Nationalist groups. Its pretty sure that if Immigration/Interracial relationships are getting a boost by Democrats. Its obviously gonna piss off more Conservatives. I’m already seeing many supremacists on Reddit and YT who hold a view that Race mixing needs to end. Almost every non-white man chases white women according to them. And well its the reality too.

<li>Title: 'Help a brother out'<br />Body: "Hi\nI'm going to need some help processing what I'm experiencing. I'm in my early 20s, rudderless and plagued by a smorgasbord of unhealthy emotions. For brevity I'm not going to delve into my past. Will just say that during childhood my mother adored me while my father was distant. Seldom would he express his adoration for me.\n\n\nI've grown to respect him as I consider him an exemplar of rectitude. There are aspects of his personality I look upto and would love to imbibe. But some of his traits seem infernal to me. His unwillingness to tolerate any disagreement and the repercussions of dissent even today make me quiver.\n\nMy environment growing up wasn't the best. Quarrels were commonplace and abuse was considered a run of the mill occurence. One day I chose to leave that house and started living with relatives. My exasperation seemed mysterious to others as I had been treated well. But somehow I just wasn't happy with my father. His negativity drains me.\n\nSome events led to estrangement in my parents' ties. That animosity between them brought me closer to my father. It allowed me to see an alternate facet of his life. His weaknesses, his foibles, his unfulfilled desires and the pain in his eyes. I started caring for him but gradually it dawned on me that I had become his counselor.\n\nHe invariably talks about his pain when we meet. We spend 5 hours together every week and all he can talk about is his pain. Seldom have I seen him interested in my life. Needless to say I'm tired and afflicted by a headache after our chat.\n\nI'm expected to unfailingly visit him once every week. If I express inability I'm now conditoned to expect a flood of complaints and his bemoaning of my indifference towards him. I cant tell him that he leaves me frustrated.\n\nOn my shoulders are filial duties but in my heart is the pain of manipulation."<br />Author: 'shalm12'<br />id: 'jpt1np'<br />Flair ::star: OC है बे </li>

I am just copy/pasting my answer from that post so that it may reach others bhratas and bhaginis.\n\nI  was in one of the most notorious universities of India. And I was among  one of the most respected students not only among other student, but  even among professors.\n\nConfidence comes from knowing exactly what you believe in. let me suggest you some survival tactics:\n\n1. Workout.  Take up calisthenics. You can do it almost without any equipment. And  it is a very nice trick to have. Looks are very important.\n2. Take  up a musical instrument. Not a common one like guitar or flute. Take up  sitar/sarod/any veena/violin. Preferably go to a guru and learn  seriously.\n3. There  are days when everyone wears traditional clothes. Wear dhoti instead of  pyjama. In short don\'t forget to assert your cultural identity.\n4. Read  about indian philosophy. Sarvadarshana sangraha is a good place to  start. There is always an explanation of social issue in Indian  darshana.\n5. Read  Kahani Communisto ki by Sandeep deo. It is a good source to counter  leftist narrative. Read about economy, constitution, History. Knowledge  is the ultimate weapon.\n6. Play  their game to make them feel you are one of them, but with a different  taste. For example, when they suggest to have beef, you say you don\'t  like beef, pork is the juiciest meat. Read social studies, gender  studies and every sort of lingo they typically use. And use that  knowledge against them. Watch Kushal Mehra in Carvaka Podcast. He is a  good source to learn how to talk like a leftist but not be a leftist.  Watch his monologues.\n\nSorry  to say that the college-university scene is full of mediocre people  without any hint of knowledge, they just parrot some utter nonsense that  has been passed on by their seniors and of course those self proclaimed  expert in youtube, you know who I am talking about. So it is very easy  and convenient to be a leftist in college. But to be a non-leftist you  need to stand apart and be far superior than them physically, mentally,  culturally and intellectually. After all they all want to follow the  "cool guy".\n\nForgot to mention, it  does not matter if you are a boy/girl, do not go after one in college.  Once you are seem desperate, you loose respect. If you already have a  BF/GF, then that\'s excellent, but do not seek one in college. Seek  excellence.\n\nLet me know if you need help finding source materials to read.'<br />Author: 'Straight_Razor007'<br />id: 'jnw0hv'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

<li>Title: 'Is Caste system still relevant today?'<br />Body: "In 20th century, in this age of modernisation, why is caste system still prevalent in India. Although in urban areas it is less (not null), but still practised in rural areas. I recently visited a friends village and they still have this untouchables who live outside the main village. \n\nI have seen lot of extreme hindu redditors in this sub, do you still support caste system, if yes, why?\n\nOther day, I saw a meme calling for unity of all Hindu people, and yet in the image, they were differentiated into Brahmin, sharitya, vaishya etc. If you yourself don't see them as one, how do you expect them to unite. I don't know how caste system actually came into our society, there are conflicting articles all over the internet, but in the age I believe it is irrelevant.

As we saw in current scenarios that when oil prices drop the Arab world goes down the drain and increase tax and slash spending on civilians by large amounts as seen in Saudi Arabia , which is causing very distress in Saudi. \nWe know India has lot of waste problem  ( specificaly biodegradable waste and sewage waste)\nwhich is just pumped into landfills or burnt . What the Indian government must do is that they should use it as a fuel . Put the wastes in large underground silos for decay which will produce gas having aprrox 70% by volume of Methane . Pure natural gas is methane with some very trace gases. This cost will be significantly lower than that of importing Gas and we can actually be a producer and exporter of gas.\nOr the other strategy should be that India has funds to import gas so why not bankrupt those who can't survive without oil and gas business i.e. Arab world \nQatar will be first to be hard hit. We can produce  gas in very large amounts and can survive on meagre margin profit per cubic metre of gas cause our production rate is much low but they can't. \nThis will put us into the global oil circle and make indias position against USA and Arab world strong and we can dictate terms to Arab world like Russia did in 2015"<br />Author: 'Lopardest'<br />id: 'jmnkii'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li>

It is not really Tamil language imposition, but Tamil Nadu related stuff imposition.  \n\nRecently I went to Thanjavur Periya Kovil, (Kovil means temple) and Gangaikonda Cholapuram (it was not named after King Rajendra I, who is also known by the title Gangai Konda Cholan, or one who conquered the ganges). \n\nChola rulers were patrons of the arts and architecture . They built the  temple of Gangaikondacholisvara. The temple has sculptures of exceptional quality. The bronzes of  Bhogasakti and Subrahmanya are masterpieces of Chola metal icons. The  Saurapitha (Solar altar), the lotus altar with eight deities, is  considered auspicious.

Rajaraja Chola-1 built the famous  Brihdrishvara temple at Thanjavur between 1003 and 1010 CE. Shiva is  worshipped here. The grandeur of this temple has not been diminished by  age. There is a massive statue of Nandi, the sacred bull of Shiva, in  the central courtyard of the temple. \n\nThe exquisite bronze statues of the Chola period are known the  world over for their grace and lifelike appearance. Many beautiful  figures of Nataraja, or the dancing Shiva, were made during the Chola  era. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Brihadeeshwara temple or Thanjai Periya Kovil, Thanjavur](https://preview.redd.it/20t1y6hxsmw51.png?width=683&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a24b41ba151fa2e685d389b65659daf4e1be951)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This particular horse sculpture alone shows how much effort they have put into in carving the structure.](https://preview.redd.it/c7m0pla2tmw51.png?width=1032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=636c8a3099c4e9eb22995513e5ed440d507fde8f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Bronze Nataraja Statue](https://preview.redd.it/ejorxyrctmw51.png?width=683&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1784c51cc79bfc30506742c1492852b763ece2c4)\n\nThe periya kovil has significant Maratha style constructions too under King Sarabhoji II, which may have been the reason for some dome-style structures within the temple.\n\nOverall this first-time visit to the two temples was extremely good and it made me wonder how such intricate structures had been carved back then in spite of lack of modern technology and how the engineering principles had been applied to the fullest along with creativity to bring out such a massive creation.\n\n தென்னாடுடைய சிவனே போற்றி!   \n எந்நாட்டவர்க்கும் இறைவா போற்றி!  \n\n(Try to interpret the last two lines without using google but with the previous impositions I posted)'<br />Author: 'R_Chodi_is_useless'<br />id: 'jm2i22'<br />Flair ::star: OC है बे </li></ol>
