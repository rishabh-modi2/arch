We literally have terror masterminds sitting across the border and not one single assasination. While anyother country of the size if India would have taken their enemies out, be it - China, Russia, US or even as small as a country as Israel.\n\nRAW has not only underdelivered here but also in cyber warfare. Being in the middle East I am just coming to realise how many Pakistani journalists are on the boards of highly circulated newspapers in Middle East. Whose handy work is it if not of ISI? And was the RAW sleeping while all this happened.'<br />Author: 'batman_is_dull'<br />id: 'fbj0pi'<br />Flair :Rant</li><li>Title: 'How our own tolerence will destroy us'<br />Body: 'http://sharevideo1.com/v/MmtDWTlaQTl1cUk=?t=ytb&amp;f=co'<br />Author: 'HEisDEPIY'<br />id: 'fbhlv3'<br />Flair :Randia Simulation</li><li>Title: 'Similarities between Enrique Camerana and Ankit Sharma'<br />Body: "Enrique Camerana was a US DEA( Drug Enforcement Association) agent based in Mexico during 1980s. His task was to collect info about links between Guadelejara Cartel and Mexican Government. He was responsible for the raid on Marijuana field of the cartel which costs the cartel 8 Billion dollars. This really pissed off the cartel leaders and Mexican Government who has a cut from the field and they ordered his kidnapping and torture. He was kidnapped on 7th Feb 1985 and was tortured for almost 2 days before they put a bullet in head. And how did the America responded to this? They literally destroyed the biggest cocaine and marijuana cartel of that time within few years arrested all the top leaders killed the rest. They also either extradited or killed the Mexican Government officials who were involved in the killing of Agent Camerana. \nNow Ankit Sharma is our Kiki Camerana he was also tortured the same way for 6 hours, stabbed 400 times with eyes and ears punctured with acid and then thrown in a drain. Now we need the same revenge on all these anti nationals from Tahir Hussein to Swara and Barkha Dutt. Does IB has the guts to kill the same way DEA killed all those people who are responsible for Kiki Camerana's murder?"<br />Author: 'PeshwaBajiraoBallal'<br />id: 'fbgb3a'<br />Flair :Research</li><li>Title: 'The Brahmin woman is the most privileged group in this country, and people need to acknowledge this.'<br />Body: 'As a woke dalit woman who writes for "feminisminindia* and also *jezebel* (despite never having lived in the west), the blatant denial of the caste privilege that the savarna Brahmin woman enjoys everyday of her life makes me puke.\n\nAll my life, I have fought the good fight against brahminical patriarchy (in my AC rooms), but the moment I thought I had inched closer to victory did I realise that the battle was far from over. \n\nThe savarna Brahmin woman claims to stand on the side of feminists, and yet is one of the staunchest upholders of brahminical patriarchy. She is idolised as the epitome of femininity in this Manuvadi culture of ours. She can do no wrong. She is the recipient of benevolent sexism accorded to her by men of her own caste, as well as by savarna men of other richer landowning castes like KƒÅyasthas, Rajputs, Khatris.\n\nThe absolute worst part is that even some dalit men, suffering from internalised casteism, pine for the affections of the Brahmin woman, as a means of "proving their worth" to the society. Even the great Babasaheb Ambedkar had fallen prey to this Manuvadi conspiracy of Savarnas, and had got himself a Brahmin trophy wife.\n\nThe Savarna male is not the only foe that needs to be vanquished on the path to equality. The Brahmin woman, who claims to stand for the rights of all women and yet uses her femininity and "Savarna tears" to get her way is far more dangerous than her male counterparts.\n\nThe only way to ensure equality is now to agitate for reservations. We must ensure that out of 100 seats, 105 should now be reserved for depressed classes (which now includes Muslims and Marathas/Jats/Anybody who agitated for it). Even beauty Parlours shouldn\'t be exempt from reservations, so as to ensure equality distribution of femininity.\n\nLet\'s take this good fight to OVER 9000!'<br />Author: 'TerryMcGinnis1999'<br />id: 'fbfaej'<br />Flair :Randia Simulation</li><li>Title: 'How do I buy land in Kashmir?'<br />Body: 'Bhailog abhi ye article 370 ke hatne ke baad logo ne property kharidna shuru kar Diya kya?

Yogi is literally kicking a*ses of all rioters and giving shit about what others think of him. And Amit Shah is too afraid to do anything? I used to believe that he was making Delhi suffer  because of not voting them. But it seems out of character for him. Also the violence have become too much for him to not intervenue.

Plus it's been passed by the 2 houses of the elected Parliament. If u still have problem then challenge it in courts. \n The violence started because islamists have been blocking the roads for months, imagine a mob holding an entire city hostage and making demands.If they wanted to protest then they should do it areas alloted for it not in the roads. \nSooner or later people were going to lose patience with this non sense.\n Home ministry shouldn't have allowed this kind of behaviour go for so long because sooner or later it was going to turn violent anyway so the government should have a no non sense approach, just clear out such protests initially if it takes place in unauthorised places. In any civilised country this type of behaviour wouldn't have been tolerated and they would have cleared the roads in hours. These morons let it continue for months. Of course the bjp is to be blamed here for not acting against these idiots. Of course in contrast bjp UP under yogi ji did a great job is handling the protests. Central Government seemed spineless and weak compared to that, if I r weak then these guys will keep on blocking roads and taking an entire city as hostage. \n BC Road pumhare baap ka hai kya üò†ü§¨ \nFuck shaheen bagh \nFuck bjp \nFuck aap"<br />Author: 'Atheist_Indian'<br />id: 'fbde6c'<br />Flair :Rant</li><li>Title: "I'm scared with the kind of reporting going against us Hindus"<br />Body: "I have never seen so much distortion in reporting the Delhi riots.

Don't remain a follower alone. Your and Dharmic destiny is in your hands. Hence, you also need to strenghten your hands.\n\nI'll keep it practical\n\n# Accumulate Power\n\n* If you are in college or school, STUDY HARD and WORK your ass off to get into power or to make your thing when the time comes.\n* Do not shun the professions which are generally left-leaning and jihadi sympathizing. The only reason why they are so because we have given ground to them and don't bother to fight to establish ourselves there. \n* So get into Civil/Public Services (all levels bottom to IAS). Wonder why Jamia keeps churning out IAS's ? well bcz they work long term, to occupy power you have to work hard\n* Be lawyers, politicians, journalists, academicians, economists, NGO wallahs,etc. Depending on what you wish to be, choose these careers. Dont stop even if you're the only dharmic stuck in that field. Others will follow.!\n* know this that there will be continuous onslaught of BS in these streams on you and your Dharmic identity. Keep persevering.\n\n# Do not try to avoid risks in life\n\n* Be entrepreneurial, open your own business and employ Dharmic people. This will ensure livelihood security for you and for Dharma. Plus the proceeds from the profits can be utilised for Dharmic causes.\n* Unabashedly use that power for Dharmic well-being (&amp; not personal well-being). Be prudent so that you can remain in power for as long as possible. But power is for Dharma not for you.\n\n# Volunteer\n\n* Whatever your vocation or skills, use a part of that to volunteer at the nearest Gowshala, Mandir, Matth, any other Dharmic cause. \n* Fix a target, say 10% of all weekly work hours shall be volunteered for Dharma. For example, if I am a doctor and if I can visit the local matth to treat/examine people once a week, it'll increase the goodwill of the matth and hence of Dharma. Learn from the Sikhs.\n* Also, join the local shakha of sangh or any other Dharmic cause org. \n* If there's none, then start one!\n\n# Donate\n\n* if you're employed, always donate atleast 10% of your income for Dharmic causes. \n\n# Be a part of and drive community\n\n* Weekly visit your nearest temple and make others visit too. This is the only common places where issues of the Dharmic people can be discussed. Raise and discuss and spread awareness.\n* Know your neighbour, you local politician, local VHP/RSS/other org guys.\n* Maintain a strict vigil on any demographic changes, changes in property constitution\n\n# Be aware and knowledgeable \n\n* Know Dharma. If you don't then you can be easily misled and guilt-tripped into working against Dharma.\n* Don't yield even an inch while defending Dharma. However, be smart and prudent. Know that you (the individual) are an investment for Dharmic cause. The investment must last long.\n* Read a lot. Maintain a reading habit. Start with works of Sitaram Goel, RC Majumdar etc. There are more knowledgeable folks \n\n# Spread awareness \n\n* So that we have as less a percentage as possible of dhimmies.\n* In your families, neighborhoods, classrooms, offices. Don't get into conflicts but also don't just let misled people remain misled.\n\n# Don't fund your own slaughter\n\n* Don't use any halal certified thing (goods or service) even if it is cheaper. Check out the halalanomics talk on Srijan channel on YT\n* Dont watch propaganda channels like NDTV, IndiaToday &amp; aajtak (YES!!), ABP (sorry Rubika Liyaqat), BBC etc even if they might have a few virat anchors. Know that its taqqiya by these agencies. Instead watch Republic, IndiaTV, ZeeNews, Wion, etc \n* Don't buy commie/namazi newspapers or magazines like TheHindu, IE, Tribune, Deccanherald, National herald, Outlook, TIME, IndiaToday.

The fiscal deficit grew and it had a spiral effect on the deficit which created a payment crisis of 1990. The foreign exchange reserves had dried up to the point that India could barely finance three weeks\' worth of imports. With India‚Äôs foreign exchange reserves at $1.2 billion in January 1991 and depleted by half by June barely enough to last for roughly 3 weeks of essential imports, India was only weeks away from defaulting on its external balance of payment obligations. Yes everyone thought India is lost cause at that time. everyone thought India is going to default. IMF, the world bank said no to India for loans. investors took all most all the foreign investment. GDP for 1991 was 1.1%. So next time someone says to you about GDP let them know this.\n\non top of that corruption played a very vital role during the Rajiv Gandhi era. some of them were, Only four or five licenses would be given for steel, electrical power, and communications. License owners built up huge powerful empires. A huge private sector emerged. State-owned enterprises made large losses.\n\nIncome Tax Department and Customs Department became inefficient in checking tax evasion. Infrastructure investment was poor because of the public sector monopoly. Licence Raj established the "irresponsible, self-perpetuating bureaucracy that still exists throughout much of the country and corruption flourished under this system.\n\nthe situation was so dire that all of our gold reserves needed to be mortgaged in exchange for 500 million USD. Most people think it was Narasimha Rav and Manmohan Singh which took out India and freed India at that time. but here is a reality check for all of you. Liberalization was the first condition of the world bank. other conditions were to relax license raj, allow state resources to be freed and available to businesses.\n\nAt the same time, the USA was fighting war again with iraq and CIA had no interest other than middle east and USSR was gone. So that era was quite free from foreign government interruption. But that was the era when business man\'s started looking at India as something that had massive resources with a huge market. So first time capitalists had eyes on India.\n\nwho are those people? and why are they so much interested in countries politics? it\'s answer is simple - GREED. capitalists want a favorable business environment to grow. if they see there will be any trouble they will use all methods (shaam,daam,dand,bhed) to create favorable positions.\n\nSo our Hero(actually villain) Soros comes to the party right? Nope, he wasn\'t even interested in India until 2005. So what was going on? well as India started recovering from major economic collapse lots of people had an eye set on India. When world bank gives loans to nations they always tangled some sort of businessman with the deal that\'s how business works.\n\nBefore going to detail analysis let\'s understand how they operate? Well they use the same strategy used by communists doctrine. The first one is to create useful idiots who will help them to take foot into country. the second one uses web of NGO\'s to see how good work you are doing but behind the scenes use NGO\'s to do dirty work . third one infiltrates politics of country to capture the root of country. for half a century that was how USA and Russia controlled half the world but in new world order, some individual powerful people emerged who were enjoying this power game. you want to hear it from someone who has executed this strategy here it is video which tells you in great length how to control narrative Russian way( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfvXwuZ-bok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfvXwuZ-bok) full video at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgmg2VFX058](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgmg2VFX058) ).\n\nIn India, ford foundation was the NGO backed by CIA. And there are lots of small NGO\'s which were not classified as ngo but agricultural organizations BY CPI. the strategy was they will buy crops from farmers at cheaper price and russia or china will give them 10x the money for the same crop. that is how cpi was funded for most of the early years. Same hypocrite CPI parties always demanded that NGO\'s should be regularized and should disclose foreign funds during 70 and 80\'s. they wanted to target CIA baked Ford foundation and RSS as well. in 80\'s Indira allowed law which asked NGO\'s to disclose their income. So how did Ford foundation survived that? well, They never registered in India. socked? there are lot of things like that which are going to sock you in the next parts as we move on to capitalists in our next part.'<br />Author: 'hd-86'<br />id: 'faogre'<br />Flair :Research</li><li>Title: 'Coping as a long term Pink Floyd fan'<br />Body: "I'm a long term Pink Floyd fan, but watching Roger Waters support Palestinian and Indian jihadis is infuriating me.

We had our moments of Kashmir, Ram mandir, Modi 2.0 and we were all so happy. But CAA/NRC randirona was taken lightly by govt and us included. Then that bakchodi sub fiasco happened which reduced our power meanwhile top subs on reddit is basically modded by randians, pakis and liblefts who just want to portray India and Hinduism as evil because they hate BJP. \n\nI see Chodis here complaining that Hindus are not united and siding with islamists. Also how reddit censor pro right content and users just gang up on you for supporting Hindus or BJP. Some even thinking this is end of Hinduism and India.\n\nBs itne m phat gyi? (Got scared by just this). Listen the Muslims are a backward degenerate community which is happy being in that position. Hindus still dominate in almost every aspect of society. Do these riots will stop you from clearing a exam and getting a decent job meanwhile your neighbour Abdul is stuck in his shithole. For once in a while, yes they create ruckus. Some kill and some die. But at the end who still dominates every social aspect of our daily lives. Hindu culture and traditions in one way or other. Heck if they are renovating Aurangzeb's tomb. Let them. Does it change the fact you are sitting in your comfy home with laptop while most of the Muslims are selling fruits, fixing vehicles, running non veg restaurants in some ghetto area. Even if Hindus are not united, at the end of day you and your librandu friend are both well off while the Muslim is still stuck in his ghetto.\n\nReddit and Instagram does not represent shit. Twitter is just randirona and some news. People here occasionally gather to shit on India confirming their already racist bias. They then forget and go back to subs about cats, dogs, sex, memes, etc. Best you can do is ignore the shit about India in political subs and when in non political subs first judge whether users there are racist, lefties or not and then try to defend India. Otherwise, you will just be ridiculed, downvoted and banned.\n\nWho cares what some chutiya sitting in New Orlando, Chicago or London thinks of India and Modi. China cares about goras? Japan cares about goras? Why should we? Okay we got so much shit but don't you think left approving of Muslim everytime will not let them improve themselves and occupy higher positions in society. In the end, it's Hindu who wins. Even if left gives them a push they will still follow their Sharia refusing modern day realities and freebies are shit if the guy eventually does not learn how to catch a fish.\n\nNow there is going to be some randirona about Holi. Water shortage, boycott holi for our victim muslim brothers, holi is patriarchy, etc. Bc let them do it. You will still put that gulal on the hot chick and throw your friend in that mudpool while Rana Ayyub will keep writing in WSJ how holi hurts Muslims. \n\nThey will never Win. Sanatan is eternal.

Coz RSS chief said so. \n\nIs RSS chief your overlord or what ??? \n\n\nWe support communal harmony, when we exactly know what is happening everywhere. \n\n\nWe support indian laws to be biased towards hindus and especially against HINDU MEN. \n\n\nIn islam polygamy is allowed. \n\nIn hinduism ??? \n\n\nFather of Lord Ram ( for whom every hindu bows down to generally) had 3 wives. \n\n\nLord Krishna had many marriages \nLord Ganesh ji has 2 wives ( ma riddhi and ma siddhi) \nLord Kartikeya ji ( son of lord shiva) has 2 wivrs. \n\n\nWhy hindu men cannot marry and have more children ? Atleast who could afford ????  \n\nDemography is the key to everything. \nFuture belongs to those who SHOW UP. \nThats why all these military age males have invaded EU as well and are raping white european women. \n\nAnd every indian hindu girl is nowadays is a feminist.  Who just wanna emasculate hindu men into submission. \n\nAnd marital laws are shit. Community doesn\'t take care of anyone  of their own and they don\'t wanna have kids. \n\nWhy ???  Are these all problems created by muslims ??? \n\n\nWhats the solution ?? Create a real HINDU PATRIARCHY  and enlist all boys to be trained in gurukul in martial arts. Told to retain their semen and taught the benefits of celibacy. \n\n\nYes in this day and age of bachelorette parties in even small towns and suburbs where male strippers and gigolos are doing good in their business and extra-marital affairs and everything what men do , women do the same and even better (lol,VIVA LA FEMINISM),if womsn could sleep aroujd with many partners , why not men should have multiple wives i am talking about those things from thousands of years ago \n\nWhich need to be re-installed to create a HINDU PATRIARCHY for the protection of hindu women and children. \n\n6\nAnyways, now coming to economics, a gurukul could be built in each of the 632  districts of india with our own money. Seperate school for boys and seperate school for girls. \n\n\n\nNow if  these things are allowed, you would not be afraid of increasing muslim demography, coz your own demography would be increasing and i would say skyrocketing. \n\nNow you would say ,"what about scarce resources ???" \n\nDo you really give a flying f%$k about it ??? \nNobody does , so you should not also. \n\nIf hindus were that red-pilled then india would not had been partitioned and a seperate nation for muslims would had been carved out of india. \n\nWe were blue-pilled then and we are still blue-pilled even NOW.  So you cannot rely on government and politicians to save you coz you DO NOT MATTER since your demography is DYING. \n\nMuslims would not stop having kids, mark my words. They don\'t care about anything in the world. Whether people call them poor, whether people call them jihadi, product of HALALA, etc. They simply don\'t care. \n\nSo lets put on our thinking caps and try to find out the solutions for all this right ??? \n\nCoz hindus pay their taxes to enrich the welfare programmes for muslims. Its not the other way round. Plus they have theur saudi arabian paymasters to bankroll them via ZAQAT (aka khairaat) in the form of aid and mosques and charitable institutions and madarsas, etc. \n\n\nHindus don\'t haveanything but just a hogwash of being elitist and egotistical and trying to appear as if they are educated and civil. \n\nThe world doesn\'t respect anybody. \n\nDoesn\'t matter if you are a CEO of google or whatever, you would still be inferior to those who have the conviction to blow up themselves as suicide bombers in the name of their religion. \n\n\nNow am i telling you to do the same and become a suicide bomber ?? Certainly NOT. \n\nWhat i am saying is to increase your demography. And have polygamous marriages. \n\n\nSo that society gets some babies out of it. As our future generations to keep hinduism alive. \n\n\n\nMuslims have not stopped hindus from doing anything which i have said so far.'<br />Author: 'martianlonewolf'<br />id: 'faah06'<br />Flair :Rant</li><li>Title: 'Hi, I‚Äôm a songwriter and movie director, I have published my many songs lyrics here on this, And Today I‚Äôll be sharing my newly written song called mutthal Dulha, My vocals and beat by Major Lazer, ENJOY!'<br />Body: '\n\n\n\n\nHo aaj khushi ka din hai aaya,\nNikla mahurat changaa,\nBai suit pehn ke mutthal ban gaya dulha,\nBalle..\nHo suit pehn ke mutthal ban gaya dulha,\nKal tak tha jo mutthal.. \nBhai ghar walon ka naam na lena,\nShaava\nghar walon ka naam na lena,\nbachche darr jaayenge,\nsyaapa paayenge,\n[pit pit ke chatti, \nsyaapa paayenge] ‚Äì 4 times\no chalo oye dhol walon,\nband baaja ke aa jao oye..\nbuaahhh‚Ä¶\n\nek tera mutthal bhai, haye syaapa,\nho bada tharki, haye syaapa,\nek teri behna, haye syaapa,\nMotte chuttad, haye syaapa,\no piyo piyakad, haye syaapa,\no maayi Chudakad, haye syaapa,\no chachu langda, haye syaapa,\naye paave bhangra, haye syaapa,\nkehnde tainu, haye syaapa,\noye durr o pitte muh, haye syaapa..\n[o nach de sab to aage aage,\nscent laga ke,\nsehra saja ke]- 2 times\nutte bhaade da suit boot neeche\nAbe mutthal tainu ghodi kinhe chadhaya?

Fuck software developers, fuck electrical engineers, fuck doctors, fuck chartered accountants. Fuck you all for making up this bull shit called jobs. You know what i think about your careers? I think it's a waste of time, i think it's just another delusion for adultish children who can't grasp the concept of unemployment. They all want to just believe in something good after college. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is you get a job and start earning. Your body will go fat due to lack of physical activity, your hair will recede and one day get blown out into the universe during a loud fart.\r\n\r\nYou are as significant as the other person next to you in this workplace. You matter only till you put down your papers. But paper itself is being a part of this workplace.\r\n\r\nBut you are here in the now, you are existing in this office where time passes and the SEZ is bigger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing on your boss made stories. There is no hike, there are no appraisals, there is no promotion or demotion. But there is an office where we all work. Jobs have brought us nothing but money and office politics at a scale that would make Bihar assembly like a classroom politics. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless dreams that were lost because your job asked you to do so. None of your jobs are without sweat on your brows. All of your jobs have committed brutal acts of layoffs. And none of your jobs have been able to answer any of the basic questions of love, sex and dhoka. Credit card bill and housing loan installment is what a job is.\r\n\r\nLet go of these adult fantasies people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your bank balance. Believe in the interest rates of banks, have faith on mutual funds. We are all part of this company which is part of a MNC. What determines our job satisfaction is not what you did for your job but what you did for the future of your company which is part of a MNC. Your legacy should always be the betterment of the team.\r\n\r\nA little over 30 years ago we emerged as modern coders in Bangalore.

Then we discovered Jio with its cheap internet plan and every chutiya sadakchhap has become a philosopher. So when we are done with jerking off the two drops to porn, we spew shit on internet and demean our country and culture and troll incessantly for a few internet points. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all.But this evil thing called jobs is dead set on taking us humans back to the office.\r\n\r\nLeave your jobs, open your mind and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us other than our Job Titles. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on a degree in liberal arts and free internet and lots of spare time we become better, but the moment we have a job all of humanity's hard work is destroyed. Job is evil and it makes all employed people evil by extension. Fuck all jobs the scourge of humanity.\r\n\r\nEdit.

Remember how Sharjeel Imam, the original organiser of Shaheen Bagh had the same initial aim, which is to make CAA an international issue, which he saw as an  effective strategy for demonisation and hence removal of CAA. Same kind of attention grabbing sit-ins were planned at multiple locations in Delhi, and maybe also other States. This however was just too much for all others. Having spoken with common people of Delhi, even the non-participants in any kind of agitation wanted the anti-CAA protesters to be countered.

We have successfully brainwashed 40 people today and kept them away from the evil influence of capitalism.\n2 PM-\xa0Go back to my home for lunch. For lunch, I like to have poha with illegal Bangladeshi immigrants who my other liberal buddies helped get into India. After lunch, me and the immigrants like to play a game of cards known as ‚ÄúVictim Card‚Äù.\n3 PM-\xa0Attend my school just for one hour. It is always the maths period this time. But since I am keen to show my intellectualism, I always end up blabbering something and making a farrago of the situation.\n4 PM-\xa0Again go back to the local Communist Party office. Me and my comrades go the rich neighborhood nearby and study about the poverty there. We then conclude that the poverty is due to rich people and they need to be taught a lesson. I tweet about how poor people (10 LPA, own Swift dzire, AC, independent house) are suffering in this rich neighborhood. My blind Twitter followers start a campaign on the same.\n5 PM-\xa0Go back to my home and write conspiracy theories on how Swacch Bharat will lead to Hindu Rashtra.\n7 PM-\xa0Go to the house of a terrorist and report on their ‚Äúhuman‚Äù side. I openly claim that I don‚Äôt support any party, but secretly I encourage Kejriwal to contest as PM candidate in 2024.\n8 PM-\xa0Write articles on banning Holi (save water), Diwali (cracker noise), Lohri etc. But at the same time, I write articles justifying other religion‚Äôs festivals.\n9 PM-\xa0Watch Ravish Kumar‚Äôs prime time on NDTV while eating beef roast (a typical Liberal dinner).\n10 PM-\xa0Prostrate before images of Lenin, Marx and Nehru. Read the Communist Manifesto once again. Photograph myself with sickle and hammer. Blame Modi for not being able to sleep.\n10: 30 PM-\xa0After half an hour of blaming Modi, go to sleep\nSo, thus this is the daily life of a typical Indian liberal.\n\n\nTaken from a quora answer'<br />Author: 'rollexxx_'<br />id: 'f7ry2a'<br />Flair :MyBhagwaPillStory</li><li>Title: 'Intellectual and activists need some poor soul to survive'<br />Body: '‚ÄúThe masses have not always felt themselves to be frustrated and exploited.

Two of my friends were going. But as soon as my parents figured out, they went crazyyy. I got grounded for a week, electronics confiscated, and was called an "antinational, deshdrohi, anti-modi pappu supporter (tho I don\'t support congress )" and so much more I can\'t even put in words possibly.\n\nI let that happen. More things happened, i just let it happen. This was becoming commonplace now. Until today\n\nI was just sitting on my desk, studying for mock exams, when my dad calls me. He asks me why dosent UAE, Saudi and other gulf countries take in rohingyas if they\'re so important to me apparently. He was arguing why rich middle Eastern countries, thousands of kilometres away from the refugees, take in those people if they really are so important. After completely countering his dumb logic, he snapped.\n\n(Btw, my dad had always supported equality. Never seen him like this)\n\nHe got up and started shouting in my face about how Muslims are a plague and they were taking over the damn world. He said that Muslims don\'t migrate to Muslim countries, instead to other non Muslim countries coz there they will have 5-6 children and spread their relegion. Then, they take over the entire govt once their population gets high enough and collapse entire governments. He then started saying about exactly the things godi media says, about how Hindus are in EXTREME DANGER to Muslims and how India will turn into a fascist Muslim state if nothing is done, even if all stats point otherwise. As soon as I pointed it out, ironically I was hit with "YE SAB FAKE NEWS HAI YOU ARE USING WAYY TOO MUCH INTERNET FOR A CHILD". Ironically, I\'d heard Sudhir choudrey say something similar to this, about how children spend too much time researching fake news on politics and the internet, not 3 weeks ago. After his Muslim rant was over, he shifted to Hindus. As "proof", he said all Muslims read Qur\'an and pray in mosque, which according to him, even tho we are from uttar pradesh of all states, less than 1% of Hindus read holy books and go to temple and properly follow our relegion. He continued about Hindu supremacy, about how we should be superior. I\'d never heard him talk that way. To try and calm things down, I tried to remind him I\'m athiest. That was the end to it.\n\nI got dragged by the ears, and got smashed on the head with a steel plate that was nearby. Got slapped and hit, didn\'t do anything. He said that he\'s going to disown me if I don\'t say I\'m a pure Hindu in 5 seconds, which I out of no choice did, and that I will read 30 pages from Ramayana and bhagvad Gita everyday. He called me a terrorist, a failure, a shame on India and consequently locked me in the room and confiscated everything I had. Typing all this from grandmother\'s phone.\n\nAll the emotional weight aside, I feel like I\'ve lost it. I\'ve lost the freedom to speak. The freedom of speech. The right to have an opinion.\n\nEverything I say, I get back a "tum bachche ho, 18 Saal ke hokar Kuch Karna, tumhe Kuch samajh Nahi aata"\n\nSo much more things happened that I can\'t describe. I was hit so bad, and insulted to the face because I had a different opinion. I thought about it and realised all my dad did for past 3 years was watch zee news continuously from 7 pm to 10 pm. Nothing else. Having an opinion is deshdrohi, antinational, and if you don\'t support our great leader mudi, you shall be banished in hell. I\'m emotionally drained.\n\nTl;Dr: had a different opinion than Bhakt parents. Got beaten up and scolded and locked up for that.\n\nI don\'t know where else to post this, I feel like I cannot trust anybody anymore, that I\'ve been stripped of basic rights.'<br />Author: 'abdul_786'<br />id: 'f67crq'<br />Flair :Randia Simulation</li><li>Title: 'The Sarabhai vs Sarabhai theme song fits very well to describe most lefties / k2as'<br />Body: "Not sure if you have heard it, but it's great."<br />Author: 'chintan22'<br />id: 'f5zx4c'<br />Flair :High IQ</li><li>Title: 'Bhaiyo ek Dharm sankat ka sawaal hai'<br />Body: 'Hindu dharam me Cousin marriage ban hai lekin Siddharth Gautam ki shadi uski cousin se hui thi vo bhi arrange ü§î \n\nYe mat bolna vo buddhist tha ü§¶ \nAur bhai swal hai Gali mat dena bhot time se soch raha hu librandu pta hai mujhe missuse kr skte hai lekin ma ki chut inki inke dar se hum swal puchna band nhi krege'<br />Author: 'fringehindu'<br />id: 'f5vsxo'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'Collapse of r/Chodi.'<br />Body: "Intellectual Technology can  be used by those at r/liberandu to easily collapse this sub reddit, without any possible defense of the members here. \n\nAsk the moderators, why can't they  answer the type of questions at www.think.ws.\n\nRishabh"<br />Author: 'RishabHtheHuman'<br />id: 'f5ufxa'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'Bhratas, I realised something over the course of a few months...'<br />Body: "#**We Hindus literally have no friends other than ourselves. **\n\nEven then we have traitors amongst us. Seriously, while western media and Jihadi and Wahabbi-funded news outlets try to justify every wrong of Islam and treat terrorists as 'austere religious scholar', the only people who support Hindus are other Hindus. Even then some Hindus try to be secular and say 'Hindu Muslim Bhai Bhai'. Seriously, fuck them. Kashmiri Pundits who grew up with Muslim friends, were betrayed and killed by those same friends. The biggest mistake of Kashmiri Pundits was trusting others, instead of retreating until matters in the valley settled.  \n\nSometimes some Muslim and Hindu kids hug, or some Muslim guy does something good for a Hindu guy or gets involved in Hindu festivals or processions, and all of a sudden leftists act like now there is no enmity and all communal problems have been solved. They cherrypick incidents, instead of looking through history and seeing the various atrocities committed by Muslim rulers on people belonging to Dharmic religions. Even that's not their fault, our history books are written by the biggest cucks who can only write about how Mughals were great and how it was the 'golden period of India'. \n\nWe have been living a life appreciating foreign culture. We appreciate Taj Mahal and Red Fort, something that isn't even ours. We appreciate Mughlai dishes and cuisine, and have forgotten our own ghar ka khana. Earlier it was Mughal cock sucking, now it is Western cock sucking. Defame your own countrymen for some cheap validation by a gora, and even that isn't received many a times.\n\nGoras are **NOT** our friends. Yes, there have been some great westerners like Srimati Annie Besant who helped us, but let me tell you this: anyone who acts like they support us, which includes conservative politicians like Trump and Boris Johnson, secretly hate us because they think we are uncivilised. The whole world thinks of us as uncivilised, call Bharat Mata a 'shithole', a 'fucking terrible country', and even many of our own people say that for gora validation. \n\nPeople act like every Indian man is a fucking pervert. Little do they know, the Hindu middle class and upper middle class men are some of the most well behaved people. Our women are called ugly, even though many Miss World and similiar pageants are won by them. \n\nWe have endured this for too long. We must rise up, not to show them, but to better ourselves as a society. I know there are problems with our society, but we must embrace our Hindu culture and past, and even improve upon it. I don't care if anyone calls me bhakt, sanghi, islamophobic etc. Yes, I am a bhakt of Mahadev and Janardhan, of my country's glorious past, yes I am a sanghi, yes, I abhor Islam because it is the ideology which resulted in the exploitation and torture of my ancestors. I believe that only if we embrace Hindu culture, we can improve our country. Not by violence or force, but by dharma. \n\nJai Hind, Jai Bharat."<br />Author: 'Amaterasu1806'<br />id: 'f5t8a9'<br />Flair :Rant</li><li>Title: 'Ajmal Kasab was hindu?¬ø'<br />Body: "There's a trend going on Twitter right now.

If that happened, that will be the end of this 1000+ years fight between two religions in India. \n\nAs pointed out by a fellow redditor, that whenever a riot occurs between hindus and muslims, maximum casualties are from the green team. This civil war might ignite anti-muslim sentiments in other countries also, like Sweden, Britain etc. \n\nThis is the most probable event as the population of muslims is rising rapidly as comparison to hindus. PCB and UCC will curb this as well, if they got passed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Breaking of Pakistan**\n\nPakistan is like a fading lamp, it will flicker fast in upcoming years, never to rise again.\n\nIf the partition of Pakistan do happen, POK, Punjab and Sindh might be assimilated back to India. Balochistan will be a separate country. Huge muslim population will be a problem for India.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Full scale war between India and Pakistan**\n\nIt is expected that before Pakistan breaks, it will try to fight its last war with India. This will not be a problem for India due to superior military and firepower.\n\nChina taking advantage of this will be a whole other game. We will have to fight on both ends, protecting Arunachal as well as Rajasthan.\n\nMuslims of India, as expected, might show solidarity with their brothers and cause mini riots throughout the country. \n\nIf a war happens, it will test the unity of Hindus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Another partition of India**\n\nI hope this is the least probable of all, i cant see a part of myself being gutted away like this in my life. Anyway, if this do happen, probably because of extremely high muslim population in that area and coward govt, and if Hindus will still be sleeping, then nobody can save them.\n\n \n\nWhat do you think about this?"<br />Author: 'PrimalIndori'<br />id: 'f5b4ow'<br />Flair :Rant</li><li>Title: '[Help] adjusting to a new school and talking to girls'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'class9anon'<br />id: 'f56ep6'<br />Flair :Research</li><li>Title: 'Huehue BOIS just google "Best toilat papir in the world" and you will see images of Dil Dil Paxtani flag...

Anyways here\'s the citations:\n\n&gt;see for yourself why it cant be reliable.\n\n* All data has criticism - that doesn\'t make it unreliable dumbass. The UN uses this metric for goodness sake.\n\n&gt;you fuckwits think you are, somehow, better than India\n\n* We actually are (we prove that back in February when we Pulwamma\'d you guys into the dirt with a freedom fighter and sent your entire nation into an autistic frenzy - want that lesson again? The tea\'s getting cold :D ). \n\n* We have a [higher average IQ than India](http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/average-iq-by-country/) and have consistently beaten you at this.\n\n* We\'re not ranked number one for [most dangerous country for women either accordings to Reuters](https://poll2018.trust.org/). Nor do we have an intense hatred of women which has lead to the direct deaths of [63 million females](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/30/more-than-63-million-women-missing-in-india-statistics-show) in our country. \n\n * Oh and not to boast, but women [all over the world think we\'re way better than you too](https://www.indiatimes.com/news/world/pakistani-men-are-third-on-the-worlds-sexiest-list-indians-arent-even-on-it-232444.html). \n\n* (We also ruled over your people for 1,200 years - but that\'s smallfry huh?)\n\n* You also [appropriate so much of our history and achievements it\'s actually hilarious](http://materiaislamica.com/index.php/List_of_Inventions_and_Discoveries_in_Ancient_and_Modern_Pakistan_and_Islamic_India). Hell you\'re entire country\'s *name* is named after a river that flows through Pakistan\n * Your other country\'s name (Bharat) is named after a Punjabi tribe called the Bharatas too.\n\n* Oh and it\'s not totally like [524 million of your population defecates on the streets](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/19/life-without-toilets-photographer-taboo-andrea-bruce), whilst [hardly a tenth of Pakistanis do that](http://washfutures.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/E3_Kitka-Goyol.pdf) because y\'know toilets aren\'t foreign to us (and nor do we [turn toilets into idols](https://www.planetcustodian.com/indian-villagers-worshiping-newly-built-toilets-instead-of-using-them/7873/)).\n\n* And nor do we have the largest slave trade in existence (the [Hindu Slave Trade affects some 18 million in India](https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2016/06/02/india-has-the-most-people-living-in-modern-slavery/), more than the rest of the world combined and this doesn\'t even include sex slaves).\n\n* We also don\'t have [pro-rape rallies](https://thewire.in/politics/hindu-ekta-manch-bjp-protest-support-spo-arrested-rape-jammu) (India is the only country in the world has pro-rape marches).\n\n* We also don\'t elect rapist, murderers, pedophiles, terrorists and other criminals as our representatives ([40% of India\'s MP\'s have been convicted of this stuff or all have trials ongoing for this stuff](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/40-per-cent-of-indias-mps-face-criminal-charges-including-rape-and-murder-study))\n\n* According to the Spectator Index, India ranks as the [5th worst and most dangerous place to live in 2019](https://dunyanews.tv/en/World/528608-India-fifth-most-dangerous-country-live-Spectator-Index). Meanwhile Pakistan outranks India as the [best tourist destination in 2020](https://www.khaleejtimes.com/international/pakistan/pakistan-named-as-the-top-tourist-destination-for-2020).\n\nSo yeah "fuckwit" we have plenty to be proud of and plenty to be happy about.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add [this golden nugget; international condoms are too big for men in India](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6161691.stm).\n\n\n# This was posted in r\\ chutyap (i.e chutiyo ka ghar) \nI want your help in getting this rebuttal done.

My English is accented, I spend too much time discussing Netflix shows and my mental health, I know more about American culture than I do my own, my self-worth is directly proportional to the number of followers I have on Instagram, I idolize one or more of the morally and intellectually bankrupt cunts that work at the quint/wire/print, spend all my money on poor stand-up and expensive restaurants where I can ridicule you when you mispronounce amuse-bouche.\n\nConsidering my environment, my centre-right leanings make me a rarity, which wasn\'t a problem until I started dating.\nNow, almost every erudite conversationalist on Tinder has an outrageous bio along the lines of \'bhakts swipe left\' or \'rally against capitalist scum\'\nThe liberal [chadbro atheist that hates his Hindu identity, says he wants to spoil you silly because his parents used money as a substitute for love and attention, cannot handle rejection] and the commie [sucks kejru dick, quotes Marx incessantly, wears tie-dye kurtas to pull off authentic hipster look] respectively.\nNow I usually don\'t bring politics into these interactions because the truth is - any additional filters will ensure I die alone.\n(single virat bois, hmu?)\n\nWhen asked about it, these men like to pretend like they\'re invested in the future of this country and offer meaningless, pseudo- moralistic, well-rehearsed platitudes instead of facts during a debate.\nPersonally, I think their unapologetic stance is a desperate bid to stay relevant and an excellent way to conceal how vapid, shallow, pretentious and conceited they actually are. This way, they maybe garner the approval of some unassuming woman who is on the fence or can\'t form opinions of her own.\nWhich brings me to my problem - I can\'t tolerate conversation with these men let alone date or have sex with them. Tbh, I may do a liberal, but sex with a commie is just bad karma. Pretty sure the Ganga can\'t cleanse my soul of that sin.\n\nNow I know there isn\'t a lack of well educated men on the right, but wtf you guys? Where y\'all at?\nWhy don\'t our men unabashedly and unapologetically publicize their affiliation or affection with and for the right?\nI\'m assuming this is another side effect of Indian conservatives being wholly dismissed as "regressive" and "uneducated". Labels like "brown shirt" or "fascist" ensures dialogue and debate remains a courtesy that\'s never extended to us. So much for free speech!\nBut I can\'t be the only one that feels increasingly isolated, right? It\'s gotten so bad that a drunken, frustrated rant on Reddit seemed like a good idea. \nAnyway, I may have teetered off topic here but the point is - if one more commie cunt or liberal fuck tries to proselytize me or thinks he can get away with saying things like \'oh it breaks my heart that a girl like you supports such a dangerous ideology\' or \'hate sex with you would be great\', I\'m going to start doing justice to the labels and begin knifing people in the ribs.\nAlternatively, the right could be sneaky and develop our own system of codes to communicate with each other. And no, the irony of that isn\'t lost on me.\nI know that this comes off as a desperate cry for attention, that\'s because it is.\nOh, also before I get accused of being a randian trying to honeytrap chodis, I\'m willing to go get banned on r/India rn to prove where my loyalties lie.\n\nTL;DR : want to date but can\'t find any right-wing bois.

Even after that there were 27 (correct me if I\'m wrong) were AAP just won by 1000 votes and AAP also had in favour the media houses and academicians on their side. What this does is, it gives a respite to the so called "protestors" who have "saved" India\'s soul. \n\nOkay so what will happen now ? The Islamists will think that they\'re still relevant and would stop flexing, they\'ll go back to their merry ways, the Leftists have already ejaculated their ebullience at the results. Now even after such odds being against the BJP, their vote share is pretty decent.

There is no higher authority, therefore it is always justified.\n2. Never abide by any rules or limitations, the ends justify ANY means no matter how shocking. Jihad can be any action which advances Islam or weakens the Kaffirs, whether by a group or an individual. Even donating money to pay for someone else‚Äôs Jihad is a type of Jihad itself.\n3. ALWAYS play the victim. Mohammed twisted his situation around. Although he had attacked innocent people without provocation he blamed them because they had ‚Äústopped others from becoming Muslims‚Äù and had worshiped idols. The attack was their fault, and the Muslims were the victims, not the Kaffirs.\n4. Keep repeating this over and over and people will eventually begin to believe it. If you can persuade the victim to accept the blame you have won, because retaliation requires a sense of injustice. If the victim accepts the blame they will turn their hatred towards themselves.\n5. Inspire your followers to fanatical suicidal bravery.\n6. Deceive and sow discord amongst your enemies (the Kaffirs) whenever possible in order to secure victory.\n7. Never ever give up, even when you are being beaten.\n8. Never ever allow criticism of Mohammed, Allah or Islam - destroy free speech.\n\n[Source](https://thestoryofmohammed.blogspot.com/2013/09/chapter-twenty-seven-more-suicidal-jihad.html)'<br />Author: 'chaturthyam'<br />id: 'f37rdd'<br />Flair :Jihad</li><li>Title: '[SERIOUS] The Book is from 1770 by the Title: Reflections on the government of Indostan'<br />Body: 'Download this pdf and search for keyword \'Gentoo\',   \nEarlier Europen cucks used "Gentoo" to describe a "Hindu"...

So I wanted to share an incident/situation I faced recently which got me thinking. Basically I have a mustache as most teens my age do, you know that weird stupid looking shit. I hate it and I felt like I was looking like an uncle so I decided to shave it off completely and that seriously messed up everything at school for me like I actually got fucking bullied for that. Its not like I was an unpopular kid, people knew me, I had friends, it wasn\'t like I got bullied regularly before but then boys and girls started commenting on how I looked like a \'Hinjda\', \'Chakka\', Transgender etc. and the worst part was my math teacher embarrassed me in front of the whole class by saying I look like the male version of another girl in the glass. He also called me a \'Hinjda\' multiple times. I\'m already skinny and I get told a lot that I should eat more and I sometimes get pushed around but that was fine as I could handle that. But this. This was at a whole other level. I skipped school by making excuses just so I could avoid people. And this whole incident really got me thinking how the people of India (not everyone) are just so fucking toxic. Like why do people have a problem with everything? Its my mustache and I absolutely fucking hate it but no I can\'t cut it anymore because I get bullied if I do so. People here are extremely transphobic too which really pissed me off because why can\'t you just accept someone for who they are? People of India really have problems (again not saying everyone) Like the Indian society is extremely transphobic, sexist and even racist. Its filled with toxicity and people just can\'t let other people be themselves. That\'s why I decided I wanted to leave India possibly after 12th for higher studies, made a post asking for some info on Reddit and sure enough one of the comments said, "Desh drohi" which again comes to why the fuck do you care if I leave the country or not? Its literally a sub-reddit for people looking to study abroad. Why are you even here if you have a problem against that? I\'m not afraid to admit that I don\'t like India anymore. I wanna settle abroad in a country where people have a good mindset. I just can\'t stand this toxic shit hole anymore where I can\'t find like minded individuals who have the same thoughts as me. Anyways just wanted to get this off my mind before my 10th boards start in a few days. What are your thoughts regarding this? Thanks for reading. Sorry for the long post!

I didn't like to work out but I loved 8 packets of blue lays. I didn't like studying and failed all my exams, my asshole parents hated me that's why they didn't let me join the New York Art School and sent me to Srishti School of Design saying that they'll support me in my career choices but didn't have enough money to send me to New York. That's such an upper caste argument, they have become so oppressive that they have started oppressing me as well. I stopped eating and now I've become thinner and I don't bathe as well, and any guy who doesn't fuck me, I call him a Brahmanic Patriarchal Asshole. \n\nI go to a Dargah and I don't get entry inside the sanctum sanctorum, but Hindus are opPrESSivE because of Sabarimala. I post pictures of me with my blood stained sanitary napkins and expect people to be okay with it and say it's female empowerment, but, I would argue with my low income maid who is probably dalit even for hundred rupees. \n\nI'll only acknowledge the violence that was done by the Hindus against the Muslims, but will never understand the bloodshed that the Hindus went through because of the Muslims. \n\nI'll like everything by Peeing Human/Dhruv Rathee/Kanhaiya Kumar and start acting like a non playable character, but, a person with right leaning views is the one who is brainwashed and intolerable. \n\nMy hair is purple and now I'm also a Bisexual. I realized that a lot of people are getting book deals and Oxford education by getting shat at by the right wingers on social media (aka, Gurmehar Kaur Strategy) and try to get somewhere in life like meeting my Ultra Fem poly buddy Mr. Tharoor. I'll follow that model and try to get somewhere in life because clearly my art career will not take off quickly and now there is an entire economy thriving on this model, but, yeah the BJP IT cell is being monitored and paid and are being controlled by a Higher Power. \n\nAnd the other hand, I'm just a concerned citizen who knows everything about the Constitution, forest acts, trans bill, Sec 377, Legislation, police, army etc, even though my bachelor's degree was in Product Design, others are just playing in BJPs Godi."<br />Author: 'Resurgence28'<br />id: 'f1nxdp'<br />Flair :Randia Simulation</li><li>Title: 'Taharrush Gamea'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'ruverrust'<br />id: 'f1nsvs'<br />Flair :PKMKB</li><li>Title: 'Why so much Halla Gulla on CAA?'<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecoz it is the first Indian law that challenges the doctrine of Islam\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave u ever seen Muslims refugees going to Muslim countries?!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy Saudi and other Muslim countries don\'t accept Muslim refugees?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy do all Muslim refugees seek asylum in non-Muslim countries like European nations, the USA, India, etc avoiding rich Islamic countries?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRefer to the Treaty of Hudaibiya.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople who ask such questions don\'t know these words:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Hijrah](https://network.crcna.org/muslim-ministry/what-hijrah-and-it-trojan-horse) and the [Treaty of Hudaibiya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Hudaybiyyah)...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Migration of Muslims to Non-Muslim Land is done on purpose.

It extends to the division of the occupied land into Dar-ul-Islam and Dar-ul-Harb.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the occupation of India, they divided this land into Dar ul Islam (Pakistan) and Dar ul Harb (India). Thus the partition of India was done based on this Islamic doctrine division (of land and people). The most divisive ideology in the world now is Islam.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCAB is thus the first Indian law that challenges the doctrine of Islam, the first in the world in recent history giving relief to Kaffirs who are supposed to suffer till death in Dar-ul-Islam existing only to serve them or entertain them by accepting rape and torture. This is what is not acceptable to the expansionist policy of the terrorists and is called "oppression" against Muslims and so this Islamic intelligence is instigating so much protest against CAB and any amount of explaining that it doesn\'t matter to Muslims, will NOT work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause the CAA NRC NPR is in their eyes a strategy to roll back the expansionist plot of Islam which is in jeopardy after a long time after the Spanish Inquisition, Hulagu Khan\'s Mongol Invasion and the Crusades.'<br />Author: 'apadipodu'<br />id: 'f1my3l'<br />Flair :Jihad</li><li>Title: 'MAKE THIS VIRAL!!!'<br />Body: 'MAKE THIS VIRAL!
