Reasons for it have been stated below.\nThe hard work done during research and interviewing the families of victims for this movie was clearly visible in every scene. There is not a single scene in the movie which has been made up, everything shown in the movie is exactly how it happened. In the past few years I had heard about these stories from my parents but seeing it visually in the movie was very disturbing and emotionally taxing to say the least. I can’t even imagine what my family and other families from my community must’ve gone through that time.\n\nIn the past whenever a movie was made on Kashmir(Mission Kashmir, Haider, Shaurya, Shikara) it always reversed the victims and aggressors. Muslims were shown as the victims whereas that is far from reality. Few years ago, a Kashmir Hindu director made a film called Shikara and we all expected it to show our genocide as it happened but it was just another propaganda movie on Kashmir by that lobby.\n\nBefore seeing this movie, I had seen videos of people coming out of the theatres crying because of what they saw, some felt guilty and angry that they didn’t know about what happened with their fellow Indians until now. After the movie got over, I myself heard some people cry and as we all were leaving the hall… there was silence and everyone’s facial expression explained the reason behind it. \n\nThe characters in the movie from Pushkar Nath Pandit to Krishna Pandit felt so relatable that at times i felt as if i knew those characters personally. This movie showed how propaganda is done in the name of sympathy, how we have enemies of the nation living amongst us, the so called leftist and Islamist ‘intellectuals’ in the system, media etc. The climax scene of the movie will leave you shattered. There was a lot of depth, meaning and agony behind every word and slogan especially some kashmiri words used that I think the non-Kashmiris will not be able to understand even with the subtitles.\n\nTo all critics saying Kashmir Files is creating hatred, calling out hatred is not creating hatred. Our story deserved to be told as it happened. \n\nI liked how through the movie they said that what happened with the Kashmiri pandits was a GENOCIDE. We were FORCED to leave out homes, we didn’t leave by choice. We were FORCED to become refugees in our OWN country. It shows how a certain community chooses religion over everything(even moral and ethical values) and is willing to do anything in the name of religion, from raping and killing their own neighbours to not even sparing small children. From the local moulvis to our neighbors, all of them were involved in this. They did not even spare those from their own community who chose to oppose them. \nJust 2 days ago, 3rd village sarpanch was SHOT DEAD this month and last week a bomb was hurled in a market killing 1 and hurting over 20.\n\nMy family or others from my community could’ve lived a good life back in Kashmir, they just had to convert and give up on their dharma but they did not. Despite being a Kashmiri, I have been to Kashmir only once and that too was as a visitor. We still cannot return as it is still not safe for us. My grandparents couldn’t return back to Kashmir in their lifetime but I hope my parents and I can return back to Kashmir. Today I can proudly wear my Janeu and call myself a Kashmiri Hindu but there is a story of resistance and sacrifice behind it for which I will forever be indebted to my parents and grandparents. \n\nIt has been 32 years since our 7th genocide but there is a 8th one which is going on which then, this time it is the Indian state, Indian media and fellow Indians who have ignored to address what happened with us. It has been 32 years and people responsible for our genocide still haven’t been punished. Even today many Indians continue to deny that a 1990 happened. The Supreme Court denied opening files related to the Kashmiri Genocide. Those who killed us.. gave open interviews on TV and attended parties with Prime Minister. If there is any shame left in our Judiciary, they should hear our plea and give us justice as soon as possible.\nWe still haven’t gotten justice even after 32 years. \nIs 32 years not enough for this blind state and system to give justice to a persecuted community? \n\nI would urge everyone to see this movie to know about what we Kashmiri Hindus have gone through and learn lessons from it. Show this movie to your family and friends, talk about this with them. There are so many topics like this that can be picked by directors but that will happen only when movies like this do well in the theatre so the onus is on the audience to make sure they watch such movies.\n\nHonestly, there is so much to say about Kashmir but I will keep this one short. I would just like to end this by again urging you all to watch this movie in large numbers and ensure that this does not happen again with anyone else.\n\n\nJaha shiv, saraswati, Rishi kashyap hue \nwoh Kashmir Hamara hai \n\nजहां शिव, सरस्वती, ऋषि कश्यप हुए\nवो कश्मीर हमारा है\n\n\nHum bhi dekhenge\n\nहम भी देखेंगे'<br />Author: 'khubus_15'<br />id: 'tdex8c'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Rant on IMDb'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'goru69'<br />id: 'tdeoiy'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: 'Kashmir Files Review'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Sh5eyes'<br />id: 'tdela3'<br />Flair :DawoodWood (Entertainment) 🎥</li><li>Title: 'cold war 2.0 ka fayeda uthake kashmir hadap lena'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'MrMlST'<br />id: 'tdcidh'<br />Flair :Magga Balti Vichar :Shwr:</li><li>Title: 'Asking.'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Classicnepal'<br />id: 'td8b2j'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li><li>Title: "Shah Rukh Khan's, Aamir Khan &amp; Salman's most powerful reaction to KASHMIR FILES"<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: '845898'<br />id: 'td6bdg'<br />Flair :DawoodWood (Entertainment) 🎥</li><li>Title: 'Book Suggestions'<br />Body: 'Hey guys,  \nI am trying to understand right-wing thought in India.
