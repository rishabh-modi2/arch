<li>Title: 'Left ultimately wins'<br />Body: '[Rant] *This is in response to questions, that frequently appear on RW subs. I know this sub users are enlightened about all the points I make here, this was originally written as a comment to a post which got deleted.*\n\nContext: Somebody is maligning India. Our own people betraying us, etc..\n\n**What can we do about it?**\n\nLiterally nothing may be in 10-15 years If government pulls its shit together does some heavy handed dirty job, key is controlling "Social Studies" universities. We need to understand historical developments to know how we landed in this current situation.\n\n* Left in India is inherited from Colonisers, whose social theories were designed to justify their rule (white man\'s burden). However, Its been 78 years and we should own up our faults. \n* Left got a head-start in Independent India. Nehru and Gandhi were influenced by left academics of their time.\n* Lack of opposition (or enough to be heard), has led Congress to continue Nehruvian Sociology ideas.\n* UPA: Congress + Left regime. This regime saw the biggest change, left leaning parties started controlling education institutes from primary to higher level, most of our text books got really biased at this time.\n* Economic liberalisation: Much needed thing, that congress was forced to do as directed by World Bank, did helped us economically but this is also the time that many external forces with political, religious and other malign intentions started entering India. These foreign NGO\'s directly or indirectly recruit JNU/TISS (or similar) students for their think tanks. The loop is complete, job options for left wing students are not limited to academia any more, they are hired by big International think tanks, media houses, etc..  \n* The current situation at mentioned Social Studies university: Its the former left academician who guides new comers, dictates what is allowed and what not. There are restrictions on what is qualified to be used as reference (citations). So these universities have left leaning academicians, attract more such people.\n\nOur current approach will not work.\n\n* We Engineers, Doctors, people of occupations can teach our future generation about all the glory, they ultimately have to study in schools and universities where left dominates. There are enough instances that we read and hear about on Internet where kids of a really cultural parents end up hating their own roots. This has led to conventional wisdom: "The more a person spends time on university, the chances are he/she will be a leftist".\n* Participating in Social Media reactions (twitter trends, rating on Google Play store), can teach manners and make understand the ground realities to companies for now, but the left has a real good grip on them and it will not break for our hashtags.\n\nThat being said, I\'m not denying current government is not aware of it or doing anything to damage control [article](https://swarajyamag.com/ideas/jnu-is-beyond-hope-but-ashoka-and-krea-can-learn-from-new-university-of-austin). These efforts are equal to adding a new fish to a rotten pond, it ultimately dies.'<br />Author: 'branthebroken__'<br />id: 'qw2vxn'<br />Flair :Rant :angry:</li>

Their Destiny is to be ruled etc." Regarding the Kashmiri Pandit issue, one of his lines was, "every revolution is built on top of lives. A few lakhs is small number and any revolution in history, led to killings until an equilibrium of power is achieved.\n\nI am curious if other bhratas handed the discussion differently. How did your conversation end? As for me, our discussion ended with both of us shouting on top of each other voices and being restrained by mutual friends in our mutual attempt to kill each other if eyeballing and swearing could kill.'<br />Author: 'TomMorvRiddle'<br />id: 'qvzvjv'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: "What's going to happen to Indian religions and cultures? Abrahamic are literally taking over my country. and I'm powerless to stop it. I'm scared for my life. We are slowly losing everything to them. Is it too late?"<br />Body: 'Ok so hear me out. this particular issue is very close to my hear. Infact this issue is literally the only reason I support BJP.\n\n**I wouldn\'t have any problem with them if this issue was somehow solved. However, no party is doing anything about this, and I\'m just feeling more and more helpless and dejected with every passing day.  Idk what I can do as a teenager to change any of this.**\n\nSo here\'s the deal. Muslims grow A LOT faster than any other religion in our country.\n\nHindus made up 79.8% of India‚Äôs 1.2 billion (120 crore) total inhabitants in the most recent census, conducted in 2011. That is 0.7 percentage points less than in the previous census in 2001, and 4.3 points below the 84.1% recorded in 1951. Meanwhile, the share of Muslims grew from 13.4% in 2001 to 14.2% in 2011 ‚Äì up by a total of 4.4 percentage points since 1951, when the census found that Muslims comprised 9.8% of India‚Äôs population.\n\n[https://www.pewforum.org/2021/09/21/religious-composition-of-india/](https://www.pewforum.org/2021/09/21/religious-composition-of-india/)\n\nWant to know the estimate for 2020?   According to Pew Research Center, there can be 213 million Muslims in 2020, India\'s 15.5% population.  That leaves Hindu to less than 79 percent.\n\n**So basically, Hindus went from 85 percent of the population to just 79 percent, and Muslims went from under 10 percent of the population to more than 15.5 percent. And they are showing no signs of stopping.**\n\nBuddhists, Sikhs and Jains all have fertility rates well below the national average and are therefore projected to shrink as a share of the population.\n\nc[https://www.pewforum.org/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/](https://www.pewforum.org/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/)\n\nLet me make it clear that Muslims were just around 25 percent of the whole subcontinent at the time of partition. We are headed for the same dark path again.\n\nI wanted to highlight the 2 most dangerous states.  Assam, and Kerala.\n\nHere are the stats for Assam. In 2901, Muslims were just 12 percent of the population.  **By 2001, they were 30.92%, in 2011 they became 34.22%, and FINALLY in 2021, they numbered at 40.03%**\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam\\_in\\_Assam#Population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Assam#Population)\n\nTHIS IS FRIGHTENING. THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF ASSAM ARE CLOSE TO BECOMING A MINORITY IN LITERALLY A FEW DECADES.  THE TRIBES THEIR ARE AFRAID OF THEIR WAY OF LIFE BEING DESTROYED.\n\nThat is why they are electing BJP.  But liberals cannot see their plight, because poor tribes or minorities that aren\'t Abrahamic don\'t matter to them. Unfortunately, it\'s too late for them.  All we can do now is learn from their demise, and make sure this doesn\'t happen again.\n\nThe second victim is - Kerala. The case of Kerala is even more tragic, because unlike Assam which was fucked over by Migration, Kerala was destroyed because of the low birth rate of it\'s Hindus, and their high conversion.   Hindus were 68.5 percent of the population in 1901, today, they were just 54 percent of the population in 2011.\n\nThat\'s not even the most tragic part. The thing is that Kerala Hindus will soon be outnumbered by Muslims, who were 24 percent of the population in 2011. You might ask, how tf will that happen? I\'ll show you a shocking stat.\n\n**In 2018, 43.80% of the total reported births in the state were to Muslims, 41.61% to Hindus, 14.31% to Christians and 0.25% to others, according to the vital statistics published by the Government of Kerala.**\n\n[http://www.ecostat.kerala.gov.in/images/pdf/publications/Vital\\_Statistics/data/vital\\_statistics\\_2018.pdf](http://www.ecostat.kerala.gov.in/images/pdf/publications/Vital_Statistics/data/vital_statistics_2018.pdf)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion\\_in\\_Kerala#Demographics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Kerala#Demographics)\n\nSo basically, **24 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR 44 PERCENT OF BIRTHS, WHILE 54 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR JUST 41 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL BIRTHS?**\n\nWTFFFFFF\n\nThese states are the two biggest victims. West Bengal has 30 percent Muslims, but their 70 percent Hindu majority is so pathetic that I don\'t even feel like mentioning them.  They deserve everything that\'s coming to them.\n\n**There\'s also the fact that Hindus are overcounted A LOT**.   According to the National Family Health Survey, most Indian households (75%) belong to a caste category that is eligible for government reservations, but this varies widely by religious affiliation, ranging from 15% of Jains to 98% of Buddhists. About three-quarters (76%) of Christians belong to a historically disadvantaged caste, including 21% who say they are members of a Scheduled Caste. **However, on the Indian census, Christians are not able to identify as members of a Scheduled Caste, which may lead to an undercount of Christians in the census.** In the same survey, smaller shares of Muslims identified as belonging to a Scheduled Caste or Tribe, but over half said they were members of OBCs.\n\nSo a lot of Dalits are crypto Christians or Muslims, who mark themselves as Hindus just for the reservation.\n\nThis addresses  the main issue, which is demographic change thru high birth rate. There\'s also the second issue, which is conversion.  It is no secret that most of the Northeastern states went from having negligible Christians to A LOT of them becoming one in the last 50-70 years, primarily due to missionaries.\n\nThere\'s also the fact that Indians culture is always demonized. Our gods are made joke of by "minorities" but if we get angry it\'s an attack on "free speech".\n\nHowever, all atrocities committed by Muslim and Christian rulers is whitewashed.  Even well known tyrants like Aurangzeb are being called "innocent" nowadays. Our genocide and erasing of our culture is being denied. The growth of Muslim population is being seen as "paranoia\' and "not a big change".\n\nIndian culture is being attacked from all sides. The demographics are quietly being changed. Our tribals are getting converted. Our languages and religious texts are being erased. Our temples are being controlled by the govt.  Nothing is going our way. BJP isn\'t doing shit either.\n\nThey are also creating cracks in our society, by dividing us again. Hatred is being created between south and north Indians, between Sikhs and Hindus, between Dalits an UCs, between different castes, between Gujratis and Marathis.  Between Banias and other castes. Our unity is slowly getting destroyed.\n\nOur country is getting demonized on the world stage for it\'s treatment of Muslims, even though WE are the actual victims.  And out future looks very bleak.\n\n**What should be done? HOW DO WE SAVE OUR COUNTRY? KYA KARE HUM?**Ok so hear me out. this particular issue is very close to my hear.

<li>Title: 'sAinT xAviEr lOvEd uS'<br />Body: '###Saint Francis Xavier on Temples and Idols:\n\n‚ÄúFollowing the baptisms, the new Christians return to their homes and come back with their wives and families to be in their turn also prepared for baptism. After all have been baptised, I order that everywhere the temples of the false gods be pulled down and idols broken. I know not how to describe in words the joy I feel before the spectacle of pulling down and destroying the idols by the very people who formerly worshipped them.‚Äù Xavier did this after the Hindu Raja of Quilon had given him a large grant to build churches!\n\nOn baptising and inducting children into Christianity, he wrote in 1543 to the Society of Jesus in Rome: ‚ÄúThese children, I trust heartily, by the grace of God, will be much better than their fathers. They show an ardent love for the Divine law, and an extraordinary zeal for learning our holy religion and imparting it to others. Their hatred for idolatry is marvellous. They get into feuds with the heathen about it, and whenever their own parents practise it, they reproach them and come off to tell me at once. Whenever I hear of any act of idolatrous worship, I go to the place with a large band of these children, who very soon load the devil with a greater amount of insult and abuse than he has lately received of honor and worship from their parents, relations, and acquaintances. The children run at the idols, upset them, dash them down, break them to pieces, spit on them, trample on them, kick them about, and in short heap on them every possible outrage."\n\n\n###Saint Francis Xavier on Brahmins:\n\nIn his letters to the Jesuits in Rome, Xavier wrote: ‚ÄúThere are in these parts among the pagans a class of men called Brahmins. They are as perverse and wicked a set as can anywhere be found, and to whom applies the Psalm which says: ‚ÄòFrom an unholy race, and wicked and crafty men, deliver me, Lord.‚Äô If it were not for the Brahmins, we should have all the heathens embracing our faith.\n\nLord Minto, Governor General of India from 1807 to 1812, submitted a Note to his superiors in London when the British Parliament was debating whether missionaries should be permitted in East India Company‚Äôs domain under the Charter of 1813. He enclosed with his Note some ‚Äúpropaganda material used by the missionaries‚Äù and, referring to one missionary tract in particular, wrote: ‚ÄúThe remainder of this tract seems to aim principally at a general massacre of the Brahmanas.‚Äù (M. D. David (ed.), Western Colonialism in Asia and Christianity, Bombay, 1988, p. 85). ‚Äì Koenraad Elst,\xa0Indigenous Indians: Agastya to Ambedkar, Voice of India, New Delhi, 1993.\n\n\n###Saint Francis Xavier\'s way of introducing Christianity to India:\n\nFrancis Xavier sent this letter to King John III of Portugal on May 16th, 1545: ‚ÄúThe second necessity for the Christians is that your Majesty establish the Holy Inquisition, because there are many who live according to the Jewish law, and according to the Mahomedan sect, without any fear of God or shame of the world. And since there are many spread all over the fortresses, there is the need of the Holy Inquisition and of many preachers. Your Majesty should provide such necessary things for your loyal and faithful subjects in India.‚Äù ‚Äì Joseph Wicki, Documenta Indica, Vol. IV, Rome, 1956.\n\nHistorian Paul Roberts describes what went on in the Inquisition‚Äôs Goa court that had been housed in the Sultan‚Äôs old palace and had a huge plaster image of Christ overlooking the scene: ‚ÄúChildren were flogged and slowly dismembered in front of their parents, whose eyelids had been sliced off to make sure they missed nothing. Extremities were amputated carefully, so that a person could remain conscious even when all that remained was a torso and head. Male genitals were removed and burned in front of wives, breasts hacked off and vaginas penetrated by swords while husbands were forced to watch‚Ä¶. And it went on for two hundred years.‚Äù ‚Äì Paul Williams Roberts,\xa0The Empire of the Soul: Some Journeys in India, New York, 1997.\n\n----Francis Xavier SJ: The man and his mission'<br />Author: 'Mister-Pottasium'<br />id: 'qsob1m'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

Maybe it's due to Indian parents' emphasis only on studies, but seeing sixteen year old Hindu boy screaming at a lizard and cockroach is not done.

Their proof? The percentage of Hindus dropped from 22% in 1971 from 8% in 2011.\n\nNow notice, they only talk about the % not the *number* of Hindus in Bangladesh. If we look at the numbers of hindus in Bangladesh from 1951 to 2011, then it doesnt support their narrative.\n\nAccording to the [stats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism_in_Bangladesh#Demographics), there was roughly 9 million hindus in Bangladesh in 1951, and in 2011, there is roughly 13 million Hindus in Bangladesh. Now, if there was a "hindu genocide" or "ethnic cleansing of hindus" then how come the hindu population increased by 4 million within these 7 decades? This is a question that will stop the keyboards of indian fanatics on twitter.\n\nNow you may ask why did the % drop from 22% to 8%? The answer is pretty simple: Muslims have a higher birthrate than Hindus, thats why. There was no "ethnic cleansing" to reduce the Hindu population.\n\nNow I wouldnt care less about these people, but what is sickening and infuriating is that, Tulsi Gabbard, a very well known US politician, who was a Presidential nominee for the 2020 election, is also [buying this bullshit](https://www.tbsnews.net/feature/panorama/who-tulsi-gabbard-and-why-she-suddenly-interested-bangladesh-227020). She made a video on twitter, and re iterating the narrative of indian hindu nationalists that the % of hindus has dropped and therefore they are being persecuted. As usual, she did not bring up the *number* of Hindus in Bangladesh.\n\nThis is not surprising btw, cuz she herself is a right wing hindu nationalist as she has documented connection with RSS (according to the article I linked). But I dont think that she will be able to make an impact on the Bangladeshi hindu communities, cuz the US ambassador to BD [knows the genuine condition of Hindus in Bangladesh.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WeEXHX_JfE&amp;t=285s)\n\nUpodesh- Eishob right wing indian hindu nationalists der sathe online e torker joraben na.

But \\*\\*his most interesting role for me is his being fellow at Carnegie Endowment. Same Carnegie Endowment which has been listed by the most authorattive book on Cold War as one of the big CIA fronts (evidenced by constant exchange of positions by officials between the 2 organisations)\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Globally acclaimed book on ColdWar "Cultural Cold War" elucidates how from the era of 1930s, how US came to be a nation whose policies, particularly foreign policies, were determined by the plutocrats, for the plutocrats. And the means of determination would come to be the plutocratic &amp; corporate funds featuring swivelling doors with CIA with CIA donating its officials for these megafunds and the megafunds donating money and a respectable, non-hostile channel for achieving CIA\'s foreign policy objectives.\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;\\*\\*In the early 20th century, the United States legalized endowed foundations. They were the new lifeguards of Imperialism, or call it Capitalism, under threat from Communism. Among the first to be set up was Carnegie Corporation, endowed in 1911 by profits from Carnegie Steel Company. The Rockefeller Foundation was endowed in 1914 by JD Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil Company.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;\\*\\*The use of philanthropic foundations was the most convenient way to pass large sums of money to Agency projects without alerting the recipients to their source. By the mid 1950s, the CIA‚Äôs intrusion into the foundation field was massive. Although figures are not available for this period, the general counsel of a 1952 Congress committee appointed to investigate US foundations concluded that ‚ÄòAn unparalleled amount of power is concentrated increasingly in the hands of an interlocking and self-perpetuating group. Unlike the power of corporate management, it is unchecked by stockholders; unlike the power of government, it is unchecked by the people; unlike the power of the churches, it is unchecked by any firmly established canons of value.‚Äô\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;\\*\\*In 1976, a Select Committee appointed to investigate US intelligence activities reported on the CIA‚Äôs penetration of the foundation field by the mid-1960s: during 1963-6, of the 700 grants over $10,000 given by 164 foundations, at least 108 involved partial or complete CIA funding. More importantly, CIA funding was involved in nearly half the grants made by these 164 foundations in the field of international activities during the same period.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;\\*\\*‚ÄòBona fide‚Äô foundations such as Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie were considered ‚Äòthe best and most plausible kind of funding cover‚Äô. A CIA study of 1966 argued that this technique was ‚Äòparticularly effective for democratically run membership organizations, which need to assure their own unwitting members and collaborators, as well as their hostile critics, that they have genuine, respectable, private sources of income‚Äô. Certainly, it allowed the CIA to fund ‚Äòa seemingly limitless range of covert action programs affecting youth groups, labor unions, universities, publishing houses, and other private institutions‚Äô from the early 1950s.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;‚ÄòThere was a cover branch at CIA whose job it was to help provide cover, like the foundations we used for our operations,‚Äô Braden explained. ‚ÄòI paid no attention to the details. The Finance Department would handle it, and talk to the cover officer. It was just a mechanism which you used. The Farfield Foundation was one of them. I don‚Äôt know the names of all of them, I can‚Äôt remember. But it was a criss-cross of money.

<li>Title: "An excerpt on 'development' from J Sai Deepak's book 'India that is Bharat'"<br />Body: "Reading this amazing book about colonialism, civilization and their effect on the constitution of India by J Sai Deepak. Here's an interesting excerpt on development:\n\n\n**The subversion of the Indic perspective is equally reflected in the manner in which Bharat treats its geography on issues of development. The civilisational logic behind treatment of ecologically fragile or sensitive areas as sacred pilgrimage spots appears to have been completely lost on the ‚Äòmodern‚Äô Indian State. This is because the State seems obsessed with ‚Äòreligious tourism‚Äô and ‚Äòecotourism‚Äô, with diminishing respect for the fundamental matrix of nature, faith and patriotism that informs and makes this civilisation. Critically, this matrix includes respect for the rights of non-humans and their habitat. Bharat‚Äôs civilisation is not one that reduces nature to just another branch of study, namely ‚Äòenvironmentalism‚Äô, to be ticked off as just another box in an environmental impact assessment checklist. Instead, it puts nature right at the heart of its worldview and sees divinity in every aspect, form and manifestation of nature. From such lofty heights that directly affected ecological balance, and therefore survival, for this civilisation to now put development and nature in two different baskets with the former being treated as the priority, is the clearest reflection of the pervasion of colonial consciousness. Pointing this out may invite labels, such as ‚Äòtree hugger‚Äô, ‚Äòluddite‚Äô or being ‚Äòanti-development‚Äô, but all of these are terms typically used in the West, thereby exposing the coloniality even in the reactions. In other words, neither is the contemporary position on development indigenous nor is the response to those who oppose colonialised development. The absence of indigeneity could not have been starker.**\n\n\nThis book is a must read for every Indian.

<li>Title: 'How effective were European-style infantry units as raised in the 18th century in India? With a special reference to the Campoo batallions of Benoit de Boigne and his employ under Mahadji Scindia'<br />Body: 'I think it would be prudent to begin this analysis by first exploring some background into what led to the emergence of these formations in the armies of contemporary Indian states during the 18th century.\n\n\n\n***How and why did these formations emerge?***\n\n\n\nThe realisation of the inherent value of having reliable firepower in the hands of infantry formations in an army, had dawned upon Indian monarchs by the late 16th century, and arming a certain section of one\'s infantry according to how many musketeers one\'s finances would allow them to afford, became a trend in Indian militaries since then. Most states enjoyed limited success or abject failure, but none compared to the predominant power in the subcontinent which was the Mughal Empire. For a century or so, the Mughal Empire, outgunned it\'s neighbours and opponents. Yet, with the advent of trading companies and the opening of the subcontinent and it\'s commercial markets to the world, the military technologies, tactics and systems of Europe and European military adventurers, who would hire out their services to the highest bidders also arrived in India. Hence, when the Mughal Empire fractured, when the Maratha rise under Peshwa Bajirao Ballal from the 1720s onwards made the perception of Mughal invincibility nothing more than an illusion, the states that were once Mughal vassals and allies such as the Rajput kingdoms, the states that had rebelled against and gained autonomy from the Mughals such as the Jats and the Sikhs and Marathas, and the States that had succeeded the Mughal Empire but who still recognised the nominal authority of the Mughal Emperor while for all practical purposes functioned as autonomous entities such as Awadh and Hyderabad, got into the business of acquiring substantial numbers of musket armed infantry, to hold and expand their newly acquired territory and autonomy.\n\n\n\nBut while the realisation that firepower was necessary on the modern battlefield was dawning upon Indian monarchs it would still take until the 1750s and 60s, for any formidable Sepoy trained batallions to surface on the scene in 18th century India. Among these corps was the one commanded by Ibrahim Khan Gardi, a former Commandant de la Garde to Charles Joseph Patissier, Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau, he was trained in the French discipline and way of warfare by the latter during his service under him. He was then employed in the army of the Nizam of Hyderabad and his title "Gardi" was a souvenir from his service under his previous commander, a derogation of "Garde". Under the Nizam he was able to raise 2000 men, trained and drilled in the European/French fashion and had an efficient artillery arm to support his infantry. Having impressed upon the young Sadashivrao Bhau, cousin of the then Peshwa of the Maratha Confederacy Balaji Bajirao, during the former\'s campaign against the Nizam, the value of drilled sepoys and artillery firepower in warfare, he was soon employed in Maratha armies under the direct command of Sadashivrao Bhau, who allowed him to raise between 8000-10,000 "Gardi Musketeers" as his batallions would come to be known and a park of around 60 cannons. Ofcourse, these Gardi Musketeers, while enjoying limited success in the Deccan, they were ultimately destroyed in their entirety at the Third Battle of Panipat, 1761. The battle was an excellent education into the inherent weaknesses of such batallions, but more on that later.\n\n\n\nTherefore, it was first the realisation that a musket armed infantry was crucial and often decisive on a battlefield that prompted Indian monarchs to begin employing such formations in their armies. While some accomplished this under later Mughal rule, almost every monarch of note began trying to accomplish the same once the Empire\'s inevitable demise became apparent after the 1720s. Next, it was the education from harsh experiences such as the Battle of Karnal, the Carnatic Wars where regular European and French/English trained Indian Sepoys made a mockery of the forces of the Nawabs and Rajas of the Carnatic who grossly outnumbered them, that Indian monarchs learned the value and effectiveness of well drilled and disciplined infantry formations. Hence, from the 1750s, onwards, it was considered necessary to have such formations in one\'s armies and the avenues for the acquisition of these formations were several. Monarchs could pay military adventures to train and maintain and lead such troops, they could employ natives who were under the employ of the armies of the trading companies by seducing them with greater monetary prospects, or they could pay these companies to maintain such formations for them in their territory often bearing a huge cost for their maintainance and pasting with some elements of autonomy in trade and authority over their territories in the process.\n\n\n\nIt must be apparent, that any monarch who wished to expand and control his territories, chose one or both of the former options.\n\n\n\n***Mahadji and De Boigne : The Foundations Of An Invincible Army***\n\n\n\nNext, we arrive at the question of how did these troops fare against both - other Indian armies and the armies of the trading companies. For this we must first delve into the issue of how these troops were raised, how were they organised, how did they fit into the army as but one arm of a multi faceted instrument of destruction, and how did the various archaic elements of Indian armies interact with and respond to these troops. I think one of the best examples of a European military adventurer employed by an Indian Prince, to raise and command Indian sepoys drilled along European lines is that of Benoit de Boigne and his employ under Mahadji Scindia. While so much could be said of the life of these two men, we are for now, concerned about the performance of the Sepoy formations raised by the former in their service of the latter. De Boigne had entered Scindia\'s service in early 1784, while the latter in November of the same year, was assigned "Vakil-i-Mutlak" or the plenipotentiary Regent of the Mughal Empire, an office which combined the Wazirhsip and the Mir Bakshi functions. Only once in history had such a post been created by the Mughal Emperor and that was by Muhammad Shah who appointed Nizam-ul-Mulk to this position around the dawn of the 18th century. The task before Mahadji Scindia now, was to bring to submission the many rebellious chiefs, commanders of forts and garrisons, former vassal/allied Rajputs and local zamindars and Jagirdars who had ceased to acknowledge Mughal sovereignty and pay their obligated share of revenue from the taxes they collected from their territories. It would be for this endeavour, and to secure and expand his position and domain in Hindustan (North India) that Mahadji enlisted De Boigne, and had him raise Batallions of sepoys from Oudh and Rohillkhand, which the latter accomplished and raised a force of roughly 12,000 (privates, officers, water carriers and artillerymen included) after initial setback during the Lalsot campaign. This is the force, whose performance and failures should shed some light into the reasons for the military successes and failures of Indian Sepoy formations. For analysing the performance of these troops, we can look at the their actions during a few battles. But first, we must at least look at the organisation of these troops under De Boigne and their overall disposition.\n\n\n\n***De Boigne\'s Campoos, Organisation, Logistics and Equipment***\n\n\n\nThe most accurate description of De Boigne\'s corps, which at it\'s zenith reached two brigades in 1793, exists in an official note prepared for the Governor-General Sir John Shore in the same year. We find that the 2 brigades were subdivided into 10 batallions each, 6 of which which recruited from Oudh and made up of upper castes (Brahmins and Rajputs/Purbiyas) armed with flintlocks and were called *Telingas*. The remaining 4 were recruited from Rohillkhand, they were called *Najibs* and were armed with matchlocks. Each Batallion was made up of 8 companies of 68 men each (52 privates, 12 officers, 2 bandsmen and 2 water carriers otherwise known as *bhistis*) and 23 staff members ( 10 officers, 1 surgeon, 2 clerks, 1 *bhisti* major, 5 musket stock makers and 1 *pandit*), giving the total strength of the battalion as 567 men. This gives the total strength of the Campoos as around 12,000 men. Each batallion had two European officers i.e a Captain and a Lieutenant at Rs. 400 and Rs. 200 a. month respectively. A European Sgt. Major at Rs. 60 a month and the highest Indian officers were the Subahdars at Rs. 40 a month. The salary of each man of the rank and file was Rs. 5 a month.\n\n\nTo each brigade were attached 1000 Ruhellas (Afghans from Rohillkhand), armed with matchlocks, meant to act as skirmishing troops, capable of making use of the terrain and sniping at the enemy in defensive positions.\n\n\nThe cavalry was made up of (A) The Guards Regiment or De Boigne\'s personal guard of 300 regulars (men and officers), mounted on bay colour horses of excellent breed and quality, plus 75 irregulars for skirmishing and 32 mounted gunners for the light "galloper guns" attached to this formation, bringing the strength to 407 men. (B) These were the Cavalry attached to the brigade, 150 regulars (men and officers) and 75 irregulars each. These were all *shiladars* or men who provided their own mounts and equipment, for double pay. There were no Europeans in the cavalry.\n\n\nFinally, was De Boigne\'s magnum opus. His artillery. Each batallion had 5 guns attached to it, making a total of 100 field pieces, plus the 4 (3 pounder) galloper guns of the Guard cavalry and the "Park of Artillery" consisting of 1000 men. The ammunition provided to these formations was at a rate so liberal, it was unknown anywhere else in India. 45 rounds of grape and 12 shells for each howitzer, 400 rounds for each 3-pounder and 300 rounds for each 6-pounder a piece. Each gun was drawn by 8 bullocks and their tumbrill by 12 such beasts. 4 camels carried 240 rounds each for each "galloper gun", the guns being manned by 8 mounted gunners each and drawn by 2 horses each and *never* unlimbered, so as to pour death into the enemy lines at a moments notice. The man in charge of manufacturing De Boigne\'s arsenal was a Scottish watch-maker of great skill and abilities, by the name of Sangster. He was first appointed in charge of the arsenal and factory at Agra and then all other factories/*karkhane* passed under his supervision. According to EEIC observers, his muskets which were produced at Rs. 10 each were equal in quality to EEIC standards. Meanwhile his cannons were superior to all other native powers and almost a match for European ones. Wellington himself marvelled "*The iron guns are European made.... The brass guns, howitzers and mortars have been cast in Indian but the whole have a design and execution of a European artists..... The gun carriages are strong and good, after the French design*" \n\n\n\nIn terms of logistics he hadn\'t slackened either. Each batallion had 2 camels to carry 8 large bell tents for the sick, another 2 camels carried tents for the *Golandazes* and *Khalasis* attached to the guns, and 16 more to carry the sepoy\'s baggage. A total 20 camels per batallion, along with 2 hackery carts to carry the arms of the sick, tools for the sappers and wood cutters as well as other equipment of note.\n\n\n\nFinally, a word on De Boigne\'s consideration for the men who fought for him. He ensured that "any man wounded received a gift, and in proportion to his wound anywhere from 15 days to 3-4 months pay" without any stoppage of salaries during his time of cure. The disabled reiceved a pension for life, equal to half their regular pay, plus lands, and the deceased men\'s families were given the man\'s lands and property as compensation. These measures placed him above any Indian Prince of the era. Caring for his men, something most Indian states ignored. As such, in later campaigns, he commanded more respect and loyalty than most contemporary commanders.\n\n\n\n**BATTLE OF PATAN, 21st of JUNE, 1790**\n\n\nThe seeds for the campaign and battle of Patan were sown in the aftermath of the Battle of Lalsot fought three years earlier in 1787. Mahadji as *Vakil-i-Mutlak*, had demanded from the Jaipur Raja his arrears, due to the Mughal Emperor who was his nominal suzerain to the tune of Rs. 63,00,000. These the Raja refused to pay, and under the guise of negotiations forged an anti-Scindia alliance with Jodhpur state and a few Mughal general such as Ismail Beg. This alliance faced the vanguard and forward detachment of Scindia\'s army at the Battle of Tunga (Lalsot) in 1787. The main body under Scindia being miles away. The Sepoy batallions at this stage had numbered only 1300, yet they gave a good account of themselves, rallying under Boigne despite initial setback and while the battle was tactically indecisive, the event was a strategic failure for Mahadji who was now in worse off conditions. He was already under debt of Rs. 80 lacs at Mathura when he was made *Vakil-i-Mutlak*, his payments for his troops were in more than 30 months of arrears and now his army and morale were weakened. Yet, Mahadji executed a steady retreat yo Mathura. He had struck his own coins, the "Nana-Shahi ruppee", he provided ample funds to De Boigne to raise new batallions and the latter raised, drilled and organised 13 batallions in 6 months. Mahadj had sworn as he retreated from Lalsot, when he turned to face the land or Jaipur and said "If I live I shall burn Jaipur and Jodhpur to ashes".\n\n\nThe campaign had begun in 1790, and the two armies came face to face on 21st of June. Until about sunset, neither side committed its forces in the fighting, exchanging cannon fire and skirmishing with their troopers. By dusk, the Rajputs retreated to their camps, while the Marathas maintained their positions. This was when the realm fighting began, owing to unforeseen events. According to Jadunath Sarkar : *3 hours before sunset, some Maratha Pindaris from the left wing of Maratha lines, managed to seize animals that were a part of Ismail Beg\'s contingent. This inevitably led to a small skirmish with Ismail Beg\'s men. General de Boigne then directed his guns on Ismail Beg\'s contingent. Caught on unaware, the murderous fire of Maratha guns proved to be deadly. Gopal Bhau and de Boigne, sensing victory, went for the kill. Marathas descended upon enemy camps. Taken aback by the suddenness and the ferocity of the Maratha attack, Rajput resistance capitulated, many were slaughtered in their sleep while others were too intoxicated to fight. The only event worth noting was the Rathor charge on the Maratha right wing. The 4,000 strong Holkar contingent was saved by swift reinforcements sent by Gopal Bhau. The Jaipur Nagas were forced in their positions by the two battalions sent by Boigne. De Boigne after routing the centre and left wing of the alliance, turned all of his forces to the right. The Rathors were soon surrounded and routed, resulting in heavy losses and the death of the Jodhpur general Gangaram*. As a result of this action, Ismail Beg\'s forces were completely destroyed around 15,000, and the total losses in the Rajput side was roughly 20,000, including 3,000 Rathores. \n\n\n\n**BATTLE OF MERTA, 10th of SEPTEMBER, 1790**\n\n\nPatan, was not the end of the struggle between the Rajputs and the Scindia. While the Jaipur army was broken, the army of Jodhpur, the Rathores of Marwar, still was willing and able to put up a fight. Once again, a battle was to be fought and De Boigne and his sepoys gave an excellent account of themselves in this action as well. First, by marching before dawn close to the enemy camp, opening fire and breaking the enemy left and infantry. Next, when the Rathores countercharged at Captain Rohan\'s detachment and pushed them back on acccount of the latter having strayed some distance in excitement from the main Sepoy line, the sepoys reformed and stood their ground.\n\n\n\nSeeing an opening between the weakened detachment of Rohan and Boigne\'s main line, the Rajputs attacked in full force, the mounted levies organised into 7 divisions. They wheeled around De Boigne\'s foot, hoping to find the side and exposed rear of the formations, to ride down the infantry. What De Boigne presented instead was a hollow square. Once again, trained and disciplined artillery and musket fire, tore through Rathore lines. Meanwhile the Rathores, failing to break the infantry, charged straight towards the Deccani horse stationed in the infantry\'s rear. This contingent, broke on first impact under Rajputs pressure, but after being relieved and fighting a grim melee for around 2 hours, they managed to push back the Rathores, who were now spent and routed.\n\n\nBut the Battle would not be over before one final tussle. In the words of Lewis Ferdinand Smith, a British officer of the Campoos :\n\n\n***It is impossible for me to describe the feats of bravery performed by the Zard-Kaprawalas or forlorn hope of the enemy. I have seen, after their line was broken, fifteen or twenty men only return to charge one thousand infantry, and advance within ten or fifteen paces of our line, before they were all shot. It is but just to the enemy to acknowledge that, considering the situation in which they were found, and the disorder consequent thereto, they behaved very valiantly, as they actually cut down some of our people at their guns, and two of them with a desperate fury and intrepidity, made at De Boigne himself and might possibly have killed him if they had not been hewn in pieces by his bodyguards***\n\n\n\n**OBSERVATIONS :**\n\n\n\n***Why did the Indian Sepoy formations ultimately fail?***\n\n\n\nSo far we have noted how well the formations were organised, how they conducted themselves in operations and battles. And yet, ultimately, these sepoys failed against the English such as at the Battle of Assaye 1803. So, one must wonder why? Ofcourse, there are reasons such as the fact that De Boigne had resigned and left for France in 1793. That a duo such as Mahadji and De Boigne was rare and could not be imitated. That Perron, the new commander of Scindias sepoys betrayed his employer. But, when we look at the formations of native states in their entirety, certain fundamental problems present themselves and may answer the question as to why the native princes failed to defeat European forces despite having regular infantry formations trained along European lines. \n\n\n\n* ***Their Campoo batallions could never truly hold their own against a determined European force*** : Reason here being, the inherent problems with such a formation. The archaic elements of Maratha armies in the period, namely their Pindaris and their Silhadars, that is, their irregular cavalry, was supported by loot and plunder, while the Campoo were paid regular salaries, often higher than the irrelguar forces, since they were recruited from foreign lands and were obliged to fight in campaigns in foreign lands. The Campoo were recruited from the upper castes of Oudh and Rohilla Afghans, and had a sense of superiority about them, being the backbone of the new model armies. These two elements were always in a state of friction, and the common saying among the archaic irregular elements of the army was *Paltan barbad zhala*, meaning the Paltan was destroyed, which caused massive panic and rout among the older elements, which knew that without support in terms of infantry and artillery firepower, they could be swept from the battlefield like dust. A bitter lesson they had learned after the defeats in the Carnatic wars and the example of Buxar. Therefore, cohesion among the arms of the army was lacking. Cavalry depended on infantry and relied on the latter to take the strongest enemy positions and wouldn\'t mind if losses in life were suffered by the same. The infantry for its part, while an efficient arm, was doubtful of the abilities of the cavalry, whom they considered outdated and Inferior and capability and bravery. This compared with the professional troops, raised and trained in European fashion, disciplined and employed with better cohesion on the battlefield by professional and career officers and veterans, and the answer as to why native armies ultimately lost to European powers becomes clear. \n\n\n\n* ***The inability of Maratha Princes to modernise :*** The Campoo was the product of latest in military thinking. Of complex organisation, costly equipment and professional soldiers and officers. These required deep pockets. Now, keep in mind, that men like De Boigne when given the same land grants as Indian nobles, were able to finance and support a force of Oudh sepoys (Brahmins and Rajputs) and Rohilla Afghans, that conquered kingdoms across north India. Why? Well, because unlike Indian princes who used their treasury to decorate their halls and spent their time in their harems, De Boigne knew, his fortunes could only be realised by the efficient utilisation of his time and energy. Added to this was the fact that Scindia and Holkar were almost illiterate. They were inefficient in matters of administration. While they did conquer vast territories, they failed to check accounts, to curb corruption, to frequently visit their jagirs and ensure peace and stability which was so necessary for good harvest and a happy peasantry. Despite being rulers of such vast territories, they were not gifted with the same understanding and ingenuity of in the realm of development of administration and institutions as De Boigne and European military adventurers were. De Boigne was given *jagirs* by Scindia, when the former complained that his sepoy\'s salary was constantly in arrears and the latter gave him *jagirs* to administer and pay the salaries of his troops and for his own reimbursement. De Boigne raised the revenues realised from these *jagirs*, by regular inspection, vigilant accounting and strict administration, meaning his peasantry was happy, business and trade boomed, cash crops were cultivated and a higher revenue was realised. As an example - De Boigne settled European indigo planters in Aligarh. At Jalali, one such planter was Thomas Longcroft, who managed a factory. He produced between 3000-5000 *maunds* of finished indigo per season, which in 1830, went at Rs. 200 per *maund*, single handedly raising the revenue of the district by Rs. 10,00,000 if we suppose that indigo went by the same rate in 1793. How much could a Rajput or Maratha *jagirdar* realise as revenue from his district? Not even close. \n\n\n\n* ***The inherent problems of the Campoo Corps :*** The problem with these Campoo Corps was that they were created and officered by Europeans. Usually English and French. These men owed no loyalty to the Prince who employed them, save for the loyalty a mercenary owes to his employer, based on money. Therefore, they would always be unreliable. They would be even more unreliable when facing a European foe. These tendencies of switching sides, of treachery and betrayal, required of man of high calibre and moral standards such as De Boigne, to check them. But men like De Bogne are hard to come by. As was inevitable, such a system failed, as this innovation was not the result of Indian, or native ingenuity, but rather a foreign import. Mostly an ornament, rarely a tool. \n\n\n\n* ***No unified Grand Strategy, No cohesion, poor quality of leaders :*** When we look at the Maratha efforts against the British in the Second and Thrid Anglo Maratha wars, we find a few things to be clear. The quality of the leaders on the two sides was skewed in favour of the British. Lifelong professional soldiers and officers, will almost always beat an army, raised and officered by archaic standards, save for a few instances when a truly "heavenly born general" like Bajirao commands the outgunned forces. Maratha princes, weren\'t clear and upto date on the latest in military thinking and strategy. And above all, they simply didn\'t work together. Infighting among the Scindias, the Holkars and the Peshwas, cost them their sovereignty.\n\n\n\n* **The Indian Sepoys were just as effective as their British counterparts** : At a fundamental level, that is, when comparing one soldier to another I might agree that the average Oudh Brahmin Sepoy had the mental and physical courage, and was drilled sufficiently well to be compared to an average British regular. However, the problem here is the comparison of the sepoys as a formation namely the Campoo and the British regulars in their regiments and batallions. Here, the following must be taken into consideration. The sepoys, were officered *largely* by a European corps of officers, most of them military adventurers, some with experience in one army or another, some who were merely tailors or carpenter\'s sons and others yet, sailors or fortune seekers. All in all, given their education, their adherence to the command and organisation of men like De Boigne, these Europeans could and did lead the Oudh and Rohilla sepoys against other "Indian" enemies and managed to prevail upon them especially during the campaigns of Mahadji Scindia where they were directly commanded by De Boigne. However, these successes when analysed in their entirety reflect the absolute reliance that the lower wrung of officers and indeed the rank and file of sepoys placed on the direct leadership and command of De Boigne, or a man like Perron. Without such competent leaders who had at least some combat experience, the batallions could not perform well. In terms of initiative on the part of the lower wrung of officers, European or from Oudh, there was little to none. In terms of morale, *without De Boigne*, or without immediate success, morale crumbled and collapsed when pressured. Compare these situations with the officer corps or the men of rank and file at the disposal of Generals like Lake or Wellesley during the Second Anglo Maratha war and you have a different picture\n\n\n\n**The first and major difference between the British and Indian infantry formations was that the former was born out of indigenous innovation.** It was a result of the gradual improvement and evolution in military thinking and organisational abilities of Western European nations such as England, after the wars they had fought in the 17th century, and a optimisation of their military system and structure to accommodate such elements, institutions and structures as to allow for the regular infantry to be what it was in the mid 18th century. A well-drilled, well officered, well led, well supplied machine, supported by the simultaneous innovations in the realm of administration, commerce, agriculture and industry which allowed nations such as France and England to raise their revenues and budgets and be able to invest into and maintain such expansive forces as necessary to control their Empires and domains. Compare these to the batallions of De Boigne raised for the Scindias. **The very concept was a foreign import. And it was only adopted in earnest owing to the spectacular defeats suffered by Indian powers against trading company forces and Sepoy troops, in the Carnatic wars. This adoption also wasn\'t complemented with the adoption of the latest in administrative and institutional innovations.** Institutions such as a well structured and regulated banking system and sector were absent. And Indian monarchs still heavily relied on land as a major source for their revenues, commercial farming still being a largely ignored idea. Therefore, these infantry formations raised under such circumstances, were usually not paid on time with the payments of the batallions under De Boigne\'s command at the start of the Lalsot campaign in 1787 being in around 30 months of arrears. They weren\'t compelled by a sense of professionalism, but rather a mercenary spirit. They were foreign soldiers (from Oudh and Rohillkhand), serving a foreign entity (Scindias of Gwalior) on foreign soil (central and southern India).\n\n\nHence, you had problems of morale, loyalty, professionalism, competence of the officer corps, leadership, finances and logistics and above all, the difference in their very nature. I have already opined on why when seen as a part/arm of the Maratha armed forces, the latter were essentially disfunctional, owing to the psychological aspects of such a force in Maratha armies, whose largest component (cavalry) was still archaic and outdated and to add to that, could not stand in the field against regular cavalrymen of the British armies.\n\n\n\nSources :\n\n\n"The Fall of the Mughal Empire Vol IV" by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n"New History of the Marathas Vol III" by GS Sardesai\n\n\n"Persian Records of Maratha History Vol II - Scindia as Regent of Delhi 1787 &amp; 1789-91" by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n\n"Poona Residency Correspondence Vol I and Vol VIII and Vol IX" by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n\nPeople may find this in an answer format by me, over at AskHistorians as well.'<br />Author: 'MaharajadhirajaSawai'<br />id: 'p5m55y'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>

[India will ensure safety of Afghan Hindus &amp; Sikhs: MEA](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-will-ensure-safety-of-afghan-hindus-and-sikhs-mea/article35885095.ece)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Rise in Terrorism:** As we all know that due to the theological character of Taliban it will continue to be a safe haven for terrorists around the world &amp; will possibly affiliate itself with terror outfits operating in India i.e  Jaish-E-Mohammed/Tahrik-E-Furqan ,  Al-Umar-Mujahideen ,  Jamiat-ul-Mujahideen ( [Complete list of Banned terror outfits in the 1st schedule of UAPA,1967](https://www.mha.gov.in/node/91173) )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Take on Kashmir:** Leave no doubt that Taliban will make advances towards POK, maybe not immediately but down the line it is bound to happen as they view people in binary sense i.e Kaf'fir &amp; Momin and Jammu &amp; Kashmir fits perfectly under their definition of Occupied land, contrarty to their stance that Taliban is not an expansionary force &amp; this is something that all players know including china which had already began talks with high level Taliban delegation as it has the idea how they could woo the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, although it'll not be of much use as Taliban does not have a unified command structure to begin with.\n\nGood thing that we've already been done away with Article 370 as it would've caused moretrouble for the security forces, yet security needs to be further upgraded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Pakistan:** The worst player which would be affected by the ripple effect would be Pakistan, be it Humanitarian crises, increasing cases of Bomb blasts, stronger demand for Sharia , Tahrek-e-Taliban's attacks from the North (this is the same branch of Taliban that did the **APS Peshawar attack**), Demand for Pashtunistan as Taliban does not recognizes  **The Durand Line +** Stronger support to [Pashtun Tahafuz Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtun_Tahafuz_Movement) by Taliban.\n\nThe reason for discussing Pakistan is that as the ripple effect of Afghanistan instability travelPakistan, it is almost inevitable that Pakistan's instability would also have effect on India, Itdepends on us how much we'll be able to resist it in the long run as this Whole Episode ofTaliban has just speed'end up of the process of breakdown of Pakistan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Loss of Investment:** Now just to clarify Investment is something on which returns are expected &amp; yes these will not be called Gifts as just because the returns **aren't Tangible** does not mean it did not expected returns which is the goodwill &amp; foundation building for long term relations.\n\nBe it  **SALMA DAM** ,  **ZARANJ-DELARAM HIGHWAY,**  **PARLIAMENT** [All Other Project](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-indias-afghan-investment-7406795/) will be lost asthey believe in going back 1400 years &amp; not ahead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Central Asia:** Since the loss of POK, we bet our chances to reach Central Asia was through Chabahar Port(Iran) &amp; then land route majorly through Afghanistan Central Asia is an untapped market and it would also allow to have robust trade with Afghan as well as it is a landlocked country.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nicr379hsmh71.png?width=552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e867497d013483e2ad3f3f04df496c4c38741ece\n\n# Common FAQ's :\n\n*Q. Will the Afghan forces will still be able to turn this around?*\n\nSadly, **No** as their President has handed over the country to them and Afghan forces did not gave much a fight in the first place to begin with.\n\n*Q. Should we take in the refugees?*\n\nThe government has already taken a decision, whether it's right or wrong is a debatable topic.\n\nAccording to me, even if we take the refugees in a limit number we have to see whether they can be a liability or an asset for us as If we take in the people from Major cities who want to leave the country who can actually add something to the economy, it'll be good rather than the Rohingaya types who somehow enter through the eastern side yet settle down in Kashmir near military camps.\n\nI know this sounds really bad from the Social Justice Aspect as in just taking those refugees who can contribute better but we got shit ton of our own to deal with and the *aaka's* of them i.e Saudi Arabia, Qatar etc will never  take even a single refugee.\n\n&amp; for the minorities of other religious communities must be given refuge in totality as Muslims might be able to survive there but leaving other communities would literally mean Instantaneous Death Penalty for them.\n\n*Q. Should India send boots on the ground?*\n\nNo, even bombarding them would also have no effect as the war has already been lost.\n\n*Q. Will the Global Community come together or would UN send it's peace keeping force?*\n\nThere's no such thing as a Global Community &amp; it would require UN Security Council Resolution but I don't think it'll be passed &amp; We need to think for the long term as well, as what will UN Peacekeepers achieve when Russia &amp; America couldn't do anything. Although Afghans were under only 1 ruler i.e **Maharaja Ranjit Singh** \n\n*Q. We have fortified our borders a lot after the Kashmir Insurgency, do we need to do more?*\n\nYes, as Taliban itself is a loosely connected of people &amp; warlords. Not to forget that It took 1 man to do something like Pulwana. so,yes we need to strengthen our defense forces along with upgradation of defense &amp; intelligence infra.\n\n*Q. What does it matter, it's not like it will affect my day to day life?*\n\nTrue, but imagine having something like ISIS(Daesh) in your neighborhood &amp;  Taliban has all the ingredients to make a perfect Daesh recipe i.e Sharia Law + Opium money + Foreign playground \n\n*Q. 3,00,000 Afghan Forces Vs 75,000 Taliban fighters, How is it even possible?*\n\nRampant corruption, demotivated troops, Incompetent leadership, dependent army(on US) but the biggest factor is the attitude. Taliban is not just some group of thugs who are running a coup, It represents a particular mindset which runs through that entire belt &amp; the actual liberal muslims are in very lesser numbers that too restricted to only major cities &amp; the source of that mindset is something which we all know.\n\n........................................................................................................................................................................\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# So Buckle Up, We're in the long haul now."<br />Author: 'Masulipatanam'<br />id: 'p57bi1'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li>

<li>Title: "Understanding the British and how far we've been fucked."<br />Body: 'Tldr : British apni britishness se pareshan hoke bharat aaye, par like any parent trying to understand their child, uski freedom cheen li, rules laga diye, aur khud aiyyashi karke apna system setup karke chale gaye. \n\nI have lived all my life in Delhi. Yahan sabse shandar alishaan jageh, Lutyens Delhi hai, jahan india gate, Parliament, Rashtrapati bhavan, Embessy, Posh 5 star hotel, Chanakyapuri, Pm house, aur 600+ bunglows hain gajab bade each costing more than 150crore, basically a to z power center. Khan market bhi yahin jahan main gadiyan dekhne jata hun ferrari sab weekends pe. \n\nYe sab banaya tha ek Lutyens naam ke admi ne. CP - Connought place, Lutyens delhi ke bahar padta hai, par wo bhi firangi bana gaye. \n\nToh basically, British aaye iska sabse bada thappa roz dekhne ko mila mujhe bachpan se. \n\nUpar se angreji ko hum sabko pel pel ke padhaya hi gaya hai, even ye bhi main roman script me English mixed likh rha hun. \n\nFir schooling system bhi ekdum firangi hai, badi building me bachchon ko kaid karke , teachers manners sikha rhe, teacher ko zabardasti suprabhat aur baaki ki bakwas. Aur hume school ki khushi sirf apne saha kaidiyon se milne pe hoti thi. Ghar wale bhi sab piche padke bhejenge. Upar se khelne nahi denge fir aaj olympic me 3 medal pe roke sunayenge bhi. \n\nFir college ka concept bhi a to z firangi. \nFir sabse badi jo ghatna hai wo ye, ki aap ja ke UPSC CSE dene jao, toh aap ek bureaucrat banenge jo ki poora system firangi. \n\nAgar yaad ho toh, parliament sbka bataya maine, wo poora british hai, aur ye civil services bhi. Subhash Chandra Bose ne exam pass karke naukari chori thi, aur aaj hum shadi ho jaye isilliye ye exam me baith jate hain. \n\nFir aya internet ka zamana, mujhe dekhna tha ye biritsh hote kaise hain. Aur gaadi , engine sabme interested rha hun toh kaafi british youtubers dekhe. \n\nAur fir with time aur older british log bhi aa rhe the, plus major sab television shows discovery ke sabkse british. Top gear, fifth gear, wo david atten.., bear Grylls, aur bhi kaafi. \nAur ek meri didi london me doctor bhi pichle 20-25 saal se, unse bhi puchta rehta tha kya scene.\n\nFir mene samajh liya, coffee sex comfort, beer, hand crafted shit, achche kapde pehen ke posh jageh ja ke slow clap karna, aur ant shant tareeke se baat karna to sound smooth. Ye british fantasy hai. Bas yahan pe wo logon ki soch finish ho jati hai. \nAur ye sab ke piche ek bohot bada arrogance ki wo best hain, isiliye sab jageh ja ke bully karna. Aur sabse badi baat, wo khud is sabse pareshan hain already. Apas me british log ek dusre ko bolne nai dete. Unke yahan apne se zyada taboo raha hai. Aur ye "sexual liberation" sab naya hai. Tange tak dekh inka nikal ata tha till recent times. \n\nInhone jo haal africa ka kiya hai, apni aiyyashi ke liye full istemal. Logon ko as cattle dekhna "resource", aur jitna natural wealth hai sab loot ke le jana. Plus logon ko unke tareeke sikhana locals ko, jisse wo log voluntary gulami kare, chate inko. Pooje ki hume tumne roads di, technology di. \n\nSame isi tarah se america chala hai. Inke hisab se invade karna obvious baat hai, inko khud ke ghar me chain nahi, dusron pe nazar hai ,unka chahiye. India me gareebi aati gayi hai over generations coz yahan ki wealth lootne log aate, aur apan hath pe haath dhare baithe, apni namardi ko hum sugarcoat kar karke batayenge. Par hamare yahan ka khud sorted nahi rha system. \n\nToh aaj main sabse hinglish me baat karte hue ye kehna chahta hun, ki naya zamana hai, jaise dost ke ghar alag mahaul hota hai, alag khane ki khushbu, alag sab, par hota fir bhi apna dost hai, vaise hi aaj hum sabke pass nayi dosti ka mauka hai. Aaj ke british ne apna kuch nahi churaya, haan wo dimag me unke bhi gobar kam nahi i agree, par apne ko differences handle karna zyada behtar. Plus adha canada, adha us sab indian se bhara hai. Toh identity toh hum sabki alag hai. \n \nUpar se ye racism ki bakwas felane wali companiya, sabse jahil racist firangiyon se bhari hai. Lauda inhe koi nahi pasand. \n\nWe don\'t know how good we have it here in India, haan gareebi bohot hai aur dejected si mental state hai. Par khud ko uplift karna hai, aur india ka forte calmness in chaos hai. Iske liye inko illuminati organization karni padti hai. Third eye ki bakchodi karni padti hai. Apne yahan adhyatma (spirituality) elites ke liye nai. Apne yahan aise behtareen log hue hain , jinhone bohot simple methods se jan jan me, bohot valuable life ko fill kar diya hai . Isiliye ye bharat hazaron saalon se aya hai. \n\nIndian individuals, and not the govt coz it is a puppet to the british system,  indian individuals like you and me, apne ko sadagi jo hai na bharat ki. Isko pehle khud experience karna hai, aur khud feel karna hai. Become capable within, and all can be handled effortlessly. \nJai hind'<br />Author: 'DesiFilmkaar'<br />id: 'p4peob'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li>
<li>Title: 'reg : Reservation and new proposals'<br />Body: "With the new policies being proposed like :\n\n1. Increase for OBCs.\n\n2. Removal of 50% limit.\n\n3. Reservation in private.\n\nEffects : \n\n1. It would make more Hindus (likely General category) leave India cuz there aren't going to be many opportunities for them here.\n\n2. More religious conversion. People have an incentive of getting money upfront, getting reservation which increases the chances of better education/job/scholarship etc.\n\n\nAll this leads to reduction in percentage of Hindus in India and increases for others. Slowly we're gonna get doomed.\n\nNo party is even caring about us.\nEveryone playing votebank politics.\n\nTill now, Hindus atleast had the false image that BJP is for us and were united.\nNow with even BJP playing caste games, it probably drives a wedge between us.
