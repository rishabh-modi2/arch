But certainly more is at stake, banning industries literally implies throwing millions out to fend for themselves with society against them, with no means of learning new techniques in a such a short span of time to support their livelihood, also millions lost in GDP. And when the numbers come out, we act shocked when the numbers for GDP and employment are lesser than last year. \n\nWhile the rhetoric with Makar Sakranti is that it hurts birds so ban it?, rather look at why it hurts birds, the rope used is Chinese and of a cheap material which literally cuts things, rather cotton threads or other strong but not-lethal threads can be promoted rather than stupidly banning entire festivals.\n\nComing to Diwali, if pollution is such a serious offence, then let us statistically counter this question, higher GDP numbers require higher production(not considering crackers atm), production of any kind requires pollution, so higher the production higher the pollution. Are the environmentalists willing to cut back on their purchases (be it laptops, mobile phones etc.) throughout the year if they really care for the environment, I don't really think so, being the hypocrites they are, I have effectively shut up one such environmentalist in my college. But ofc they hit you up with other emotional stories(such as scared street dogs(we don't hunt dogs to burst at them, due to ingrained survival, they can, and do go away to more open spaces), asthmatic patients(traffic jams sure can be a bummer, anyway its a holiday and nighttime, sit tight at home and hear the boom-boom), and people scared of blinking lights and loud sounds(then good luck surviving outside at nighttime)) so the blame always shifts to us and our traditions. We need to focus on the ethics of Diwali rather than answering as per their narratives.\n\nAnother one I hear is child labour in such industries and people dying due to ingestion of gunpowder, thus the industry should be shut. With this logic, more than half of India's industries could be shut. Again the real problem here is lack of sanitation, proper tools at the dispersal of the workers. And we know how child labour NGOs really work. Was the industry pertaining to Bhopal Gas tragedy shut down, or was more careful inspection and safer environment for workers for industries the need that arose out of it. \n\nAll of this has one motive, to finish the source of income for practicing lower income Hindus and further plunge Bharat into recessions, thus making them effective targets of conversions, further lowering incomes of local Hindu temples, meanwhile successfully carrying out cultural subversion at bureaucratic level, thus systematically making us and our culture more irrelevant and inert.\n\nLike I have said before, we as a Hindu community, lack unity in sense of doing groundwork, online unity is fine, but how serious are we to gather like the Karsevaks of the 90s and sway the government working in our way, for once when this is achieved we would not be cribbing about cracker ban instead only see pseudo-environmentalists aka liberals do so.\n\nMemes and all are fine but if we have such a serious and niche platform for us, let's use it and fight the Adharmis not only online but also through offline work (eventually each member of this subreddit finding other Sanghis in their city and forming a Mitra Mandali or an effective social group, how the mods or even us decide to form city wise groups is up for another discussion)\n\nJai Hind, Jai Bharat."<br />Author: 'brown_vandamme'<br />id: 'juncf1'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'Upvote this image of the Official Subreddit for India so that it appears at the top of all search results.'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'junaiz'<br />Flair ::danklaugh: Wholesome Bakchodi</li><li>Title: 'Upvote this image of the Official Subreddit for India so that it appears at the top of all search results.'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'jun8if'<br />Flair ::danklaugh: Wholesome Bakchodi</li><li>Title: 'Hindu Rashtra'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'jun7qi'<br />Flair :Removed-07-LowQua:stop:</li><li>Title: 'I am ashamed of my family, this country and this awful religion known as HINDOOISM'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Banabhatta'<br />id: 'jumxac'<br />Flair ::HighIQ: Randia Simulation</li><li>Title: 'Notice the difference.'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'jum7wl'<br />Flair :Removed-12-Slur:stop:</li><li>Title: "Couldn't sleep until 1 AM."<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'julgfg'<br />Flair ::HighIQ: Randia Simulation</li><li>Title: 'When you are a liberandu and hate firecrackers but love Diwali sweets.'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'jukwpd'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'He is just being progressive vroo.

Before you read this and just downvote and scroll past, I urge you to continue reading.\n\nDelhi is infamous for its Air Quality which is a direct consequence of Automobile emissions, smoke from stubble burning etc. Just from this the air quality has already taken a hit and is constantly in hazardous or very unhealthy criteria in most of the parts.\n\nPersonally, I love bursting crackers. So much that I've missed them dearly every Diwali over the course of 4 years I've been in South India for my college studies. But is it responsible on my part to burst crackers in a city which deals with hazardous AQI levels on a constant basis? The fault is with the Government obviously, and I hate that because of them I've developed a feeling of moral responsibility to not burst crackers so as to keep the already elevated pollution levels in check, but do we have to make it worse before we get it better?\n\nNow, coming onto personal experience, AQI in my area was maxed out at 999 at 8pm itself and the cracker bursting went till 2am. I have an itchy lump in my throat but no other visible discomfort than that. A fellow redditor has pointed out that it could just be a placebo effect but even if it is, you can't deny that there wont be any unhealthy consequences from an air quality so poor.\n\nTL;DR If you belong to the woke mentality gang looking for a post showcasing cracker bursting on diwali as a main cause for pollution or animal discomfort in this sub, sorry but you're braindead.

They have a long way to go before they can pontificate to us on human rights, no matter how badly some people want the white man's validation for their pet biases! \n\nDhume:  Did you read the piece before commenting? My simple point: human rights and democracy will be one among many foreign policy concerns in a Biden administration. Not the top issue, but not entirely absent either. (Possible, perhaps, to discuss without ad hominem attacks.) \n\nPratyasha Reply:  Of course I read it.  N there's no 'attack' I made. There's a tendency among many to get that benevolent gaze of the white ruler on lesser mortals coz the democracy here is not considered good enough. The piece did read like that and saying that should not be considered an attack.  Also, I did make a diff point there that irrespective of the itch to interfere (if at all), it is not like the US themselves have the legitimacy to do it. We are also seeing how democratic and egalitarian their own society is, for them to come and interfere in our internal matters \n\nDhume:  Thanks. I don‚Äôt think the US can ‚Äúinterfere‚Äù in India. But it does get to decide its own foreign policy priorities, and it‚Äôs pretty clear that Biden (unlike Trump) cares about the decline of liberal democracy worldwide, including (dramatically) in India. \n\nPratyasha Reply:  Well then, he shd care about his own country n the systemic racism among other issues there. There's no dramatic erosion of democracy in India but the world is seeing what happened in the US this past year.  In fact, we shd care about it and express our concern about that decline! \n\n A man who was part of an administration that started wars in multiple countries, should not be the one anyone looks up to, for concern on the decline of democracy.  Nuisance value is expected but nothing beyond that.
