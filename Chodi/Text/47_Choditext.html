They were part of the golden age of flying untill our beloved commie chacha and his entourage acted like absolute dolts and made it into a government owned entity merging some smaller airlines like indian airlines and vayudoot.\n\nThough initially JRD Tata was allowed to manage the company, he was eventually kicked out. See the hypocrisy here, the government took control of a private company and merged it with other companies that were not profitable and they kicked out the founder. I cannot see a better example why the state has no businesses deciding what to do with a private company, same thing happened with the nationalization of banks by our beloved "When a big tree falls, the earth shakes" sahiba.\n\nThis is only one example, there are many more such examples where the nehruvian socialist policies wrecked our economy.\n\nThat being said the government should give air india back to the Tatas, cause govt can keep on pumping tax payer money into a sinking ship with the hopes that it will keep the ship afloat. \n\nAlthough the tatas have air Asia, this will do some good to the employees of air India, plus tatas can have all the slots in all the airports that belong to air india. Maybe with their financial muscle and business acumen they can turn this company arround.\n\nMaybe it\'s time for india as country to go private.\n\nWhat do you think of this?

The INA soldiers means all the soldiers that were arrested in the battlefield, they were given to Subhas Candra Bose, either by the Japanese or by the Germans. So the soldiers took this opportunity; they voluntarily surrendered to the enemy. So when the Britishers understood that the soldiers, Indian soldiers, are now noncooperating, then they decided, "No, no more. It is not possible." So they voluntarily withdrew, that Sir Sirpiting(?)

As he came into maturity his devotion to his harem eventually surpassed even his passions for polo and hunting. He personally supervised the steady accumulation of its inmates, selecting new recruits with a connoisseur's appreciation of variety in appearance and accomplishment in action. By the time the institution reached its fullest fruition, it contained 350 ladies.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;During the torrid Punjab summers, the harem moved outdoors in the evening to Bhupinder's pool. The prince stationed a score of bare-breasted girls like nymphs at intervals around its rim. Chunks of ice bobbing in the pool's water gave the hot air a delicious chill while the Maharaja floated idly about, coming to port from time to time to caress a breast or have a sip of whiskey.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The walls and ceilings of Bhupinder's private quarters were covered with representations of the erotic temple sculptures for which India was justly famous, a catalogue of copulative possibilities to exhaust the most inventive mind and athletic body. A wide silk hammock slung in one corner of the room allowed Bhupinder Singh to suspend the laws of gravity while attempting to perform in that state some of the more complex maneuvers suggested by his ceiling.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To satisfy his insatiable habits, the imaginative Maharaja embarked on a program that would allow him to remodel the charms of his concubines as his own taste changed. Sir Bhupinder opened his harem doors to a parade of perfumers, jewelers, hairdressers, beauticians and dressmakers. He even kept a team of French, British and Indian plastic surgeons on standby to alter the physiognomies of his favorites according to the Maharaja's fluctuating tastes or the dictates of the London fashion magazines, which reached the palaces in a regular flow. To further stimulate his princely ardors, he converted one wing of the harem into a laboratory whose test tubes and vials produced an exotic blend of scents, cosmetics, lotions and philters.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;All those piquant refinements ultimately only served to screen the fatal weakness in the Maharaja's Oriental pleasure dome.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What man, as handsomely en- downed by nature as Sir Bhupinder was, could satisfy the 350 highly trained and motivated ladies lurking behind the harem's grilles? A recourse to aphrodisiacs was inevitable. His Indian doctors worked up a number of savory concoctions based on gold, pearls, spices, silver, herbs and iron."<br />Author: 'Meet_Me_In_Heaven'<br />id: 'l3ceku'<br />Flair ::oc-: OC ‡§π‡•à BC!üí°</li><li>Title: 'New sub to help freshers in job hunting in the IT sector'<br />Body: 'As a fresher, I know it\'s painful to see even jobs tagged "entry-level" on Linkedin require 2-3 years of experience.

Initially the government offered to discuss specific provisions of the farms laws which the farmers found wrongful and to negotiate the language for those provisions.  The farmers insisted that they wanted the farm laws to be repealed.\n\nWhen the matter went to the supreme court, the court instituted a panel to explain the farm laws to the farmers.  While this has been represented as the court abdicating its responsibility, it actually shows that the supreme court finds nothing untoward in the laws.  They carefully selected eminent lawyers who understood the laws to explain the provisions to the farmers, the way only a lawyer can explain the law to their layman clients.  The panel was rejected by the farmers and liberals were quick to point out that the panel was comprised of people who were always in support of the farm laws.\n\nwell, duh!  what the court was looking for was lawyers who understood the farm laws.  the fact that they agreed with the laws only shows that the laws were good.  it is worth noting that the panel members were, in addition to being lawyers, understanding the farm laws, and supporting the farm laws, also not really fans of the ruling government.\n\nthe agitating farmers have rejected each and every offer made by the government.  this last offer to suspend the laws for 18 months was an effort to get the confidence of the farmers and get them disband from their protest site while negotiations continue with the government.\n\nthe farmers did not outright reject this offer.  if they had done that, they could have been given benefit of doubt besides points for conviction.  instead they asked for a day to respond.\n\nwhat did they do in this day?  it is very likely that the government offer to suspend the law for 18 months was something the farmers had not foreseen and were unprepared for.  the fact that they asked for a day to respond confirms two things.  one, that the farmers sitting across the table with the government does not have the autonomy to negotiate with the government.  two, and more importantly, the fact that they were not prepared for government offer of moratorium means they have a different game in mind.\n\nso it is very likely that the farmers communicated with the people who are managing them.  the fact that the farmers asked for a day to respond made it inevitable that they will reject the offer.  the people who are managing them told them nothing doing.  they want what they paid for.\n\nthe protesting farmers now find themselves trapped.  the reasonable offer of 18 month moratorium should have been accepted.  by rejecting this offer, the farmer protests are now that much more difficult to defend.\n\nthe next action by the indian government would be 'our every offer was rejected.  now we are withdrawing from the talks.'\n\nthe government will not ask the farmers to disband.  nor will the government force the protest to disband.  they will just walk out of the negotiations and let the farmers continue their peaceful protests for as long as they need.  the emphasis on peaceful.\n\nthe farmers have three moves left.  disband and go home, continue protesting peacefully, or become violent.  if the farmers are really autonomous, they will do the first thing.  if they have some measure of control over their actions, they will insist on doing the second thing.  but, as is becoming evident, if they are puppets completely under control of some other powers, they will be forced to do the third thing.\n\nso government walks out, farmer protests turn violent.  what next?  well the world has seen that the farmers are irrational and unwilling to negotiate.  the world has also seen that farmers all over the rest of the country are reaping the benefits of the new farm laws.  if this farmer protest turns violent, it will be impossible to support them.\n\nunfortunately that is all that is left to happen.  so people in delhi best move out of there for a month or so."<br />Author: 'homeyside'<br />id: 'l2hry4'<br />Flair ::news: Unverified</li><li>Title: 'facts from desi meta'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'suhas190707'<br />id: 'l2gnv3'<br />Flair ::HighIQ: Randia Simulation</li><li>Title: "TIL that Dashavtar aren't the only times Bhagwan Vishnu took an avatar and that he has 20+ avatars."<br />Body: "Was reading stuff on a free knowledge website (that I don't want to name here, for reasons) when I came across a really long list of his avatars and was geniunely surprised.

There is no entity other than Me with such attributes of an eal or superior nature. The aggregate of all the animate and inanimate things, whether in their causal state or in the state of effect, is strung on Me who abides as their Self, as a row of gems on a thread.

Their knowledge about My essential nature is robbed by various Karmas, i.e., by objects of desire corresponding to their Vasanas (subtle impressions) born of their Karmas and constituted of Gunas. In order to fulfil these various kinds of desires they take refuge in, i.e., seek and worship, other divinities who are regarded as different from Me, such as Indra and others, observing various disciplines, i.e., practising rituals which are specially meant to propitiate only these divinities. \n\n7:23\n\n&gt;‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§µ‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•Å ‡§´‡§≤‡§Ç ‡§§‡•á‡§∑‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§§‡§¶‡•ç‡§≠‡§µ‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§≤‡•ç‡§™‡§Æ‡•á‡§ß‡§∏‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç‡•§  \n‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§Ø‡§ú‡•ã ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ø ‡§Æ‡§¶‡•ç‡§≠‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§æ ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ø ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Æ‡§™‡§ø‡•§‡•§   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The men of small understanding means those whose understanding is poor, who worship only Indra and other divinities.

So if they attain eality of enjoyment with them, they also fall down along with them in due course; but My devotees, knowing that their acts are of the nature of My worship, renouncing attachment for finite, fruits, reach Me, having for their purpose the pleasing of Me alone.

But they are destructible and those who attain them are subject to return. Therefore destruction, i.e., return is unavoidable for the aspirants for Aisvarya, as the regions where it is attained perish. On the contrary there is no rirth to those who attain Me, the Omniscient, who has true resolves, whose sport is creation, sustentation and dissolution of the entire universe, who is supremely compassionate and who is always of the same form. For these reasons there is no destruction in the case of those who attain Me. He now elucidates the time-period settled by the Supreme Persons will in regard to the evolution and dissolution of the worlds upto the cosmic sphere of Brahma and of those who are within them. \n\nTl;dr - Just because Vishnu/Brahma/Shiva/Shakti can be the same does not mean lesser beings like the christian god or islamic god are the same. \n\nAt least, this is what I think after reading these verses.

I would like to hear dissenting opinions by this community as to why it is bad to ridicule Hindu deities.  \nFrom what I've understood, in the sanatan culture. criticism and ridicule were always accepted even in ancient India. Apparently the carvakas were known to ridicule and insult the vedas and adopt a materialistic approach to the world and this was accepted as intellectual diversity has always been welcomed in the sanatan culture.
