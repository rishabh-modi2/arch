Quran says that Mecca is a city in settled in a valley between two hills named SAFA and MARWA, . The altitude of hills is such that an enemy army can hide on its other side and you can't see them from this side. Now you go on hajj and see SAFA and MARWA , they are just some foot tall rocks And they are covered by roofs. Their distance is 450 m apart. How can a city be placed in a place of 450 m and how can a at hide behind a rock just some foot tall and wide . In Quran mecaa isentioned a city sided by hills on two sides and on other two sides, it's surrounded by 2 man made walls. Also Quran says there is river flowing from mecaa. But as we know theere is no river in whole of Saudi , let alone Mecca. \n\n2. Quran says that Mecca has farming of grapes, olive ,2 different kind of grasses and gardens lush of greenery and it's a oasis of life , greenery and desert In water. This doesnt fit for Mecca as the nearest oasis from there is 560 km away. Quran says that Mecca has 2 entrances one from higher part and one from lower . So we can conclude that Mecca is placed on a slope like area. But if you go to Mecca and see it geography, it is located on Plain ground and also it had historically 6 different entrances for coming and going out of city. \n\n3. Quran says that Mecca was a major trade hub.and it had hundreds of fair of horses and camels each year . .but scientific and archealogical evdidences. show that the old trade routes during Mohammed 200BC-600AD were at least 240 km away from Mecca . How the fuck will you water so many animals without a oasis or river .\n\n4. In first hundred years of Islam , every mosque qibla ( place where face of mosque is located) were at Petra and not Mecca. In two hundred years some qiblas were at Petra , some at Mecca , some at the centre point of line  joining Petra and Mecca and some parallel to line joining Mecca and Petra (this type of mosques were prevalent in North Africa and  Spain) \n\n5. Till here we proved that that Mecca was not mohammwd birth place and not the origin of Islam ,neither was KABA( KALA DABBA ) in Mecca . Here. Are points that proove the things instated in Quran and Hadiths mentioned for Quran actually fit true 100% for Petra \n\n6. PETRA is surrounded by two big hills and this city is located in the valley between hills. This city has two entrances , one from higher end and one from lower.this city has been found to contain spores and soil which is fertile. Even now crops are cultivated near Petra archealogical site. Petra was a big home of Arab pagans . Various Arab pagans came here to the Kaba . Petra was historically on silk route and other trade routes, so many traders and animal fairs were organised here.to feed them a river was diverted to form an excellent canal in surrounding of Petra city . \n\n7. The most important point is that in every major Arab city be it Israel Saudi or Yemen you require archealogical department permission to form new buildings.but till date no kind of archaeological evidence is found in Mecca dating to time of Mohamed or early. Medina has evidences but no mention of Mecca.\n\nIf you find this interesting, I will post in future new revealtions about Islam and Quran."<br />Author: 'Lopardest'<br />id: 'km9vzl'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihaad_Halal Certified</li><li>Title: 'Hindus should have atleast3-4 kids'<br />Body: "You guys always debate that Hindus should confront Muslims when they commit attrocity on our family and dharm .

In emergency, family males will do the protection. \n\nNow don't tell me that this is not practical bla bla bla. \nYou'd decide, you can send your child to a less premium school or even send to kv school instead of paying Lacs of rupee per year.

Rather, it is a lot more productive to use religion itself to promote libranduism. If the Goan Inquisition, Muslim and then British rule was not enough to convert India, le enlightened atheist won't either especially if it's talking down to religious people which the vast majority of people in India, especially the poor are. It is a lot more effective to use religious interpretations to push for leftist values.\nJesus was anti-capitalist, Buddha was anti-casteist, Rama was pro-lgbt and Muhammad was pro-pubg player.\nThis is just better optics for us and actually works better. It is a lot easier to sell leftist values to religious people if you convince them that this is what their god actually says.\nSide note but\xa0r/ex_hindu\xa0is genuinely a shitfest. Posting defence.pk memes to own the Hindus epic gamer style is very cringe.\n\nCommunism\n\nLook guys, I sympathise with socialists and anarchists. But in this political climate it is unironically impossible for a socialist country to survive. The USSR does not exist anymore, a socialist country would have to be isolationist and would suffer blockade upon blockade by imperialist forces. It is best we stick to criticising capitalism but understand that it is a necessary evil now.\n\nReactionary politics\n\nI get that the BJP is a shitstain but don't lose your heads. Ashok Swain is one of the worst reactionary librandus I have ever seen. Guy has officially gone full retard. Never go full retard.\n\nSeparatist advocation\n\nI am aware that these people are a small minority among the left but nevertheless they do exist. Just because I am against the using of pellet guns on unarmed protestors, does not mean I support the secession of a state. Just because I advocate for adivasi rights, does not mean I support naxal separatism.\nI would much rather the government come to an agreement with these groups for peace. At the very least, it's bad optics to push for secession and gives the left less credibility.\n\nAdvocation of violence\n\nAgain, a small minority but still. Remember when the CAA protestors burned down a couple buses and all the sanghis lost their fucking minds and all of a sudden became peaceful Gandhians appalled by leftist barbarism?\nHindutva is dependent on a delusional victimhood mentality and by engaging in violence you are just feeding into that delusion and perceived hypocrisy.\n\n\nNot sharing leftist ideas\n\nI have massive respect for people like Kannhaiya Kumar and Shehla Rashid. They really go out there and share leftist values and ideas.\nI understand not everyone has that kind of platform but the internet is a very important place to start with if you have no better way. Right wing NPCs practically dominate everywhere on Twitter, and you have a small minority of randians clinging to their echo chambers circlejerking on how secular they are.\nOn the left, a lot of the rhetoric is missing. And many are just reactionaries. Understand that when the right dominates a platform, they are the ones informing the majority of people what it is that you believe. Most people unironically think that leftism is hating India and the more you hate India, the more leftist you are."<br />Author: 'Delicious-Peanut-215'<br />id: 'km7juz'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion (Vichaar-Vimersh)üó®Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è</li><li>Title: "Jeff Bezos is not going to back down against Reliance .

He is often referred to as **Chandragupta I**\n\nJust like Chandragupta Maurya, Chandragupta I had the misfortune of being upstaged by a more illustrious successor - **Samudragupta**.\n\n**Earlier Guptas**\n\nChandragupta\'s father was **Ghatotakacha Gupta** and his grandfather was **Sri Gupta**. Not much is known about these two. Sri Gupta built a temple for Chinese Buddhists who would come to tour the sites associated with Buddha.\n\n**Chandragupta I**\n\nHis territory stretched along the Ganga from Magadha (Southern Bihar) to Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh. It\'s not known how he conquered Magadha. It may have come to him as a marriage settlement. Kumaradevi, his chief queen was a descendant of the Licchavi rajas who were defeated by Ajatashatru 700 years ago.\n\n**Samudra-Gupta**\n\nThe most famous of the Guptas. He came to the throne in 335 AD and died in 380 AD. Long lists of kings and regions were subdued by the prowess of his arm in battle.\n\nThe first campaign led Samudra-Gupta to the west where he uprooted kingdoms in Bareilly and Mathura regions of what is now Uttar Pradesh and in neighboring Rajasthan. They were incorporated in the Gupta Kingdom.\n\nNext he headed south down the eastern seaboard and elbowed aside a dozen more rivals. He turned back only after capturing Vishnugopa, the Pallava kingdom of Kanchipuram (near Madras).\n\nFurther campaigns in the north saw Gupta forces overrunning most of Bengal, exterminating independent republics like of the Yaudheyas west of Delhi, and establishing Gupta Rule throughout the ancient Aryavarta (The land of UP, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and eastern parts of Rajasthan and Punjab). This became the core region of the Guptas.\n\nNow indisputably "The unconquered conqueror of unconquered kings", Samudra-Gupta stood on the threshold of a pan-Indian empire.\n\n**The Guptas annex the Western Satraps**\n\nRama Gupta briefly succeeded Samudra-Gupta and attempted to uproot the Western Satraps in Malwa. But he was defeated. The price of surrender was to surrender his queen to them. The lust filled Shaka Satrap wanted the queen for himself and Rama Gupta conceded defeat and agreed to hand her over. However his lust would lead to his own downfall.\n\nRama Gupta\'s brother infiltrated the enemy\'s camp dressed as Queen Dhruvadevi, and promptly slew the Satrap. After the disgrace of Rama Gupta, it was his righteous brother who became the next emperor of the Gupta Dynasty, known to us as **Chandragupta II**. He may have had to kill Rama Gupta in the process, and then eventually he claimed the hand of Dhruvadevi.\n\nChandragupta II\'s main offensive was against the Shaka Satraps. By the year 409 the Shaka territories of the Western Satraps were annexed by the Guptas, and the western Satraps were heard of no more.\n\nSuccess against the Satraps gave the Guptas access to the ports of Gujarat and to the profits of it\'s international maritime trade. There and throughout central India, the Guptas became involved with the Vakatakas, the dynasty which succeeded the Satavahanas as the dominant force in the deccan.\n\nThe Cultural Achievements of the Gupta Empire flourished during Chandragupta II\'s reign.\n\n**Alliance with the Vakatakas**\n\nThe Guptas formed a dynastic alliance with the Vakatakas. Chandragupta II\'s daughter was betrothed to Rudrasena II, the Vakataka king. The latter soon died and the ensuing regency (490 - 410 AD) was controlled by **Prabhavati**, the Gupta Queen, who as regent controlled the Vakataka state in accordance with Gupta policy.\n\nChandragupta II, like his predecessor Samudra-Gupta and his successor Kumara-Gupta, reigned for about 40 years. Such longevity for 3 generations is exceptional and must have been an important factor in the stability of the Gupta Rule.\n\n**Kumara-Gupta**\n\nKumara-Gupta ruled from 415-455 AD. In his reign there was one major uprising by one Pushyamitra in Malwa. It ruined the fortunes of the Gupta Family. Soon after there appeared on the scene foreign invaders in the form of the Hunas, a branch of the Hiung-nu of Chinese history and the Huns of European history.\n\nAn offshoot of this horde, the Epthalites of White Huns had established themselves in Bactria in the late 4th century. In the mid fifth century they followed their Kushana predecessors across the Hindu Kush and into Gandhara, and they pushed east against the Guptas.\n\n**Skanda-Gupta**\n\nFortunately, the Guptas produced a champion in the form of Skanda-Gupta, the son of Kumara Gupta. He took the field successively against Pushyamitra.

They overran Kashmir and Punjab and defeated a Gupta army near Gwalior, thus extending their rule to Malwa.\n\nThus the Golden Age of the Guptas eventually came to an end.'<br />Author: 'horrorlover2'<br />id: 'km1614'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture (Bharatiye Itihaas aur Sanskriti)</li><li>Title: 'Enough is enough it is high time that we should do some thing regarding blasphemy of Hindu faith and taking its followers for granted!‡Æ§‡ØÜ‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ©‡Ææ‡Æü‡ØÅ‡Æü‡Øà‡ÆØ ‡Æö‡Æø‡Æµ‡Æ©‡Øá ‡Æ™‡Øã‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æ±‡Æø!!‡§π‡§∞ ‡§π‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ!!'<br />Body: ' On Kindle Store, A Sea Of Pornographic And Rape Fantasy Books Featuring Hindu Women And Muslim Men -[https://swarajyamag.com/politics/amazon-kindle-love-jihad-pornography-rape-fantasy-books-hinduwomen-muslimmen](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/amazon-kindle-love-jihad-pornography-rape-fantasy-books-hinduwomen-muslimmen)\n\ni though this was some fake right wing propaganda after a bit of research i found these disgusting subreddits [r/Hinduslutsmuclimcock](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hinduslutsmuclimcock/) [r/HinduGoddess](https://www.reddit.com/r/HinduGoddess/) [r/muslimhinduxxx](https://www.reddit.com/r/muslimhinduxxx/) . trigger warning(explicit content) .\n\nhave a look at this libcucks account:-[Indrajith\\_ravanah](https://www.reddit.com/user/Indrajith_ravanah/)\n\nespecially these three post:-[blasphemy of shiva lingam](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlipPlip/comments/kg7vxq/when_you_get_this/) , [blasphemy of saraswati devi](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlipPlip/comments/jhpu3k/happy_saraswati_pooja_folks_creditsdank_dravidam/),[blasphemy of sita and kali](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlipPlip/comments/jk54w5/_/)\n\nlook at this commie scream:-[blasphemy of gita](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJSx8e7LK2s/) (the whole account has Hindu bashing content)\n\nlook at this periyar scream:-[blasphemy of krishna](https://www.instagram.com/fuck_pseudoscience/?hl=en) (the whole account has Hindu bashing content)\n\nENOUGH IS FUCKING ENOUGH WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING REGARDING THIS IN A LARGE SCALE\n\nat this place i would like to give some recognition to this instagram account [dhaarala.prabhu](https://www.instagram.com/dhaarala.prabhu/?hl=en) he has been a lone tiger tackling all those blasphemous bastards'<br />Author: 'cawnion'<br />id: 'klxgyw'<br />Flair :Viraat Sanataniüö©</li><li>Title: 'Enough is enough it is high time that we should do some thing regarding blasphemy of Hindu faith and taking its followers for granted!‡Æ§‡ØÜ‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ©‡Ææ‡Æü‡ØÅ‡Æü‡Øà‡ÆØ ‡Æö‡Æø‡Æµ‡Æ©‡Øá ‡Æ™‡Øã‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æ±‡Æø!!‡§π‡§∞ ‡§π‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ!!'<br />Body: 'On Kindle Store, A Sea Of Pornographic And Rape Fantasy Books Featuring Hindu Women And Muslim Men -[https://swarajyamag.com/politics/amazon-kindle-love-jihad-pornography-rape-fantasy-books-hinduwomen-muslimmen](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/amazon-kindle-love-jihad-pornography-rape-fantasy-books-hinduwomen-muslimmen)\n\n i though this was some fake right wing propaganda after a bit of research i found these disgusting subreddits [r/Hinduslutsmuclimcock](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hinduslutsmuclimcock/) [r/HinduGoddess](https://www.reddit.com/r/HinduGoddess/) [r/muslimhinduxxx](https://www.reddit.com/r/muslimhinduxxx/) . trigger warning(explicit content) .\n\nhave a look at this libcucks account:-[Indrajith\\_ravanah](https://www.reddit.com/user/Indrajith_ravanah/)\n\nespecially these three post:-[blasphemy of shiva lingam](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlipPlip/comments/kg7vxq/when_you_get_this/) , [blasphemy of saraswati devi](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlipPlip/comments/jhpu3k/happy_saraswati_pooja_folks_creditsdank_dravidam/),[blasphemy of sita and kali](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlipPlip/comments/jk54w5/_/)\n\nlook at this commie scream:-[blasphemy of gita](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJSx8e7LK2s/) (the whole account has Hindu bashing content)\n\nlook at this periyar scream:-[blasphemy of krishna](https://www.instagram.com/fuck_pseudoscience/?hl=en) (the whole account has Hindu bashing content)\n\nENOUGH IS FUCKING ENOUGH WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING REGARDING THIS IN A LARGE SCALE\n\nat this place i would like to give some recognition to this instagram account [dhaarala.prabhu](https://www.instagram.com/dhaarala.prabhu/?hl=en) he has been a lone tiger tackling all those blasphemous bastards'<br />Author: 'cawnion'<br />id: 'klx6gx'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion (Vichaar-Vimersh)üó®Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è</li><li>Title: "Hello guys I'm from Poland and wanted to thank you for this sub."<br />Body: "You have many great memes.

We need to get out of the rhetoric of " media biased, NCERT islamic and british whitewahing", we are already aware of that but only keep beating around this bush without doing anything, hence there is no further intellectual discussion, as a result we are no better than whiners.\n\nFirst of all, all social media is created to support the left, so fighting for rights in their platforms is wasting time, already Indic SM exist but convenience makes us stay on leftist platforms\n\nSecond, we need to realise that a Sense of tribalism which you\'ll see exists within these communities, however when it comes to us we discard Hindu tribalism(as in supporting someone on the basis of them being true to your cause first, and then seeing the righteousness within that closed group of your people) for mere righteousness, this is used against us,\n\nThird, we don\'t have a vocal groundwork unity that does Hindu related work, from taking care of local temples, to raising awareness of the Hindu cause, protecting and following festivals and rituals, we assume RSS will do it, but from what I\'ve experienced they are not doing things as per their founding ideology, infact local hindutva groups are doing more in these aspects(stopping conversions, starting sanskrit pathshalas etc.) But their work is getting shunned because if their small numbers and small reach.\n\nFourth, even having a niche platform like this, all we have done so far is sharing news and discussing who r\\*ndia banned, instead we can use such platforms to form country wide small sanghi networking groups, to facilitate point 3, anything, any help, any association would happen within this group, this would be a mitra mandali as was done by savarakar at his time, this would help closeted Sanghis to become more vocal, infact many of the social work is over taken by leftist which drive the narrative, thus by using SM to truly faciliate offline groundwork we can counter them\n\nFifth, recognising Hindu businesses, especially reviving jhatka, and promoting them within the Hindu community, this is essentially what Indic ecosystem would be one that is intellectually and economically backed, also seeing a pattern of how things bad for isl\\*mic and Christian faiths are forcefully adopted within our customs, thus pig farming should be promoted for jhatka, this would effectively counter all beef related nonsense\n\nPolitical parties will only count in votes, if we want Hindu Rashtra, we need to depend on our dharma than political entities.\n\nThat\'s all I had in mind Bhrata that I feel will eventually be making Hindu samaj well networked, and effective as a community, feel free to add more suggestions\n\nAlso look into this video as well, [The Mirage of Hindu Unity](https://youtu.be/WMo7BSS7JAw)'<br />Author: 'brown_vandamme'<br />id: 'klrbc9'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion (Vichaar-Vimersh)üó®Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è</li><li>Title: 'Found an JG account based in UK promoting destruction of JIO tower.

How do we start this renaissance? And the last one, How far should we be willing to go,hindus have always had the victor's mentality deeply embedded in them while the rest of them always used their victim card as a weapon of expansion and deceit,we sure can't go around wearing bomb-jackets like them so how do we counter them?

People seem to have this misconception that Vishnu is a minor god in the Vedas. \n\nThat is not true. Below I have put a few verses from the Rig Veda which gives some credence to Vishnu being the creator of the universe. \n\nP.S - (**‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡•ã‡§É**) is Vishnu, however I learnt that it also refers to Shiva. So the below verses are also applicable to Shiva. So if you are a follower of Lord Shiva then he is the one who is the supreme being in the Vedas. I am a Vaishnava so that is why I am referring to **‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡•ã‡§É** as Vishnu and not Shiva. But all the below verses can apply to Lord Shiva as well.\n\nRig Veda 1.22.20:   \n**‡§§‡§¶ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡•ã‡§É ‡§™‡§∞‡§Æ‡§Ç ‡§™‡§¶‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§¶‡§æ ‡§™‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ø ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§∞‡§Ø‡§É |**  \n**‡§¶‡§ø‡§µ‡•Ä‡§µ ‡§ö‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•Å‡§∞‡§æ‡§§‡§§‡§Æ ||**\n\n&gt; Vishnu occupies the paramount position.

Nothing and no one creates Vishnu, yet Vishnu creates everyone and everything.\n\nSo while Indra is the Lord of Paradise in the Rig Veda, Vishnu is still the creator of the universe.  \n\nVishnu *does* take an inferior position to Indra whenever he is referred to as *Upendra*. This name is specific to Vishnu in the form of the dwarf, Vamana, who incarnated as the *younger brother* (and thus the junior) of Indra, to take the three strides mentioned so often in Rig Veda. This is why people think that Indra is Vishnu's older brother in the Rig Veda. He is not. He is the older brother to Upendra, who is the Vamana Avatara. \n\nI hope this cleared some misconceptions. The Puranas didn't retcon anything much. Even back during the Vedic Age people did see Vishnu/Shiva as God, and Indra and the Devas were gods. God is very different from gods. \n\nAlso, even Krishna is mentioned in the Rig Veda. Though Krishna is not mentioned by name in the below text, it states that Narayana defeated Kaliya. You guys cannot tell me you don't know Kaliya, the multi headed snake that Krishna defeated by dancing on its heads.  \n\n**‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•Å‡§®‡§æ-‡§π‡•ç‡§∞‡§¶‡•á ‡§π‡§ø ‡§∏‡•ã ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§‡•ã**  \n**‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§®‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ø‡§£-‡§µ‡§æ‡§π‡§®‡§É**  \n**‡§Ø‡§¶‡§ø ‡§ï‡§æ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ï-‡§¶‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø**  \n**‡§Ø‡§¶‡§ø ‡§ï‡§æ‡§ï‡§æ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§¶‡•ç ‡§≠‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç**  \n**‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ-‡§≠‡•Ç‡§Æ‡§ø-‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§§‡•ã**  \n**‡§µ‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡•ã ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§‡§ø ‡§ï‡§æ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ï‡§É**\n\n***yamunƒÅ-hrade hi so yƒÅto***  \n***yo nƒÅrƒÅya·πáa-vƒÅhana·∏•***  \n***yadi kƒÅlika-dantasya***  \n***yadi kƒÅkƒÅlikƒÅd bhayam***  \n***janma-bh≈´mi-paritrƒÅto***  \n***virvi·π£o yƒÅti kƒÅlika·∏•***\n\n*He visited the lake within the Yamuna river,*  \n*The carrier of Narayana (Garuda),*  \n*Fear not Kaliya‚Äôs fangs*  \n*Fear not Kaliya‚Äôs poison*  \n*For he who protects his birthplace*  \n*Has made Kaliya harmless*"<br />Author: 'Darkstorm999'<br />id: 'kl0s10'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm üïâÔ∏è</li><li>Title: 'Pissed by the hypocritical nature of DW - removed The Last Kalash of Hindu Kush'<br />Body: "I very much respected DW Documentary because they make some very good documentaries, and I've watched most of them, just the next day they are published.

Crops are perishable and farmers don\'t have the capacity to store it for long. \n\nalso, you dumbfucks always want a good deal for anything you purchase as a consumer, so riddle me this... why would a private company procure wheat at msp of over ‚Çπ1900 when he can purchase the same in international market for ‚Çπ1300 - ‚Çπ1400.\n\n2. why shouldn\'t the government procure at MSP? \n\nbecause that\'ll require the government to spend 15 lakh crore every year on food procurement. that\'s 170 billion dollars every year. FCI neither has the storage capacity, nor it has the need because FCI procures in preparedness and for PDS and for both these things, government already procures more than enough grains. \n\n3. why should farmers take losses? \n\nbecause farming, especially with the archaic technology our farmers use will never be profitable. if they want to "stick to their culture of farming" then let them enjoy the repercussions of those choice. farming, with all the modern technology out there is a break even profession, and with out dinosaur age technology... a deal made for losses. \n\n\nhere\'s an open challenge to you dumdums, come and argue on these facts and let\'s see how long you last.

With some of the lowest power traiffs in the world. \n\nAdani transmission\n\nHe took out debt and invested in high DC current transmission. Why because solar energy will be huge in future and Solar energy produces DC power. Once again future proofing his investments.\n\nAdani Gas\n\nHe made his infrastructure in a way that once LNG( Natural gas) runs out. He can use the existing infrastructure to supply green hydrogen. Once again future proofing his assets and debt. \n\nSo, next time assholes who know jack shit shove these facts down their throats.

The Vedic scriptures and Jain Aagams contain a lot of knowledge and were the important centres of astronomical research for ages.  \n\n\n4 Key arguments of the Petitioners:  \n\n\n1. During the time of the ruler Qutubuddin Aibak, the mosque was built by breaking the temples located in the Qutub-Minar complex. Qutubuddin Aibak could not completely demolish the temples, so some parts of it were torn down and made mosques from his material.  \n\n\n2. The walls, pillars and ceilings of the existing complex have paintings and religious symbols of deities. These include the images of Lord Ganesha, Vishnu, Yaksha-Yakshini, Dwarpal, Parshvanath, Mahavira, Nataraja and signs of Mangal Kalash, conch, mace, shriyantra, bells and sacred lotus.  \n\n\n3. The complex\'s 9 inner and outer structures symbolize the architecture of ancient Hindu and Jain temples. The corridor is completely built in Vedic style. It has galleries showing the sacred inscriptions on the pillars.  \n\n\n4.The brief history of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) also mentions the demolition of temples and the construction of mosques in Qutub-Minar.  \n\n\nThe Saket Court has accepted the PIL after the first hearing and offered 2 months of time to gather proofs including all exact photos, and prepare documents including ancient scriptures that indicate towards the existence of these temples. \n\nThis decision was ordered today itself.\n\nSource-[https://www.dnaindia.com/india/news-delhi-court-to-consider-on-dec-24-suit-to-restore-temples-in-qutub-minar-complex-2860860](https://www.dnaindia.com/india/news-delhi-court-to-consider-on-dec-24-suit-to-restore-temples-in-qutub-minar-complex-2860860)'<br />Author: 'melonmusk42069'<br />id: 'kje4gr'<br />Flair :Bakchod News :news:</li><li>Title: 'Just a curious question for all members of this sub'<br />Body: 'Do Muslim Commies share their wives?'<br />Author: 'PushyamitraShunga1st'<br />id: 'kjcnzx'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'High fuel prices: central excise which has increased manifold since 2014'<br />Body: 'When BJP leaders claim that revenue from fuel prices is used for welfare schemes, they are being economical with the truth. What is more the share of states from tax on fuel has steadily gone down\n\nF uel prices in India have skyrocketed this month, recording a historic high. After assuming office in 2014, NDA Government which has steadily hiked central excise duty to levels which are five times or even higher than in 2014, has persistently refused to reduce it to provide some relief to people.\n\nNeither the pandemic nor the lockdown and the slump in the economy or growing joblessness have persuaded the government to do otherwise\n\n\nWhen in the opposition,BJP used to oppose tooth and nail even small hikes in excise duty in petrol and diesel, totally overlooking the fact that under recoveries of oil companies had spiraled out of control and touched a whopping Rs. 1.61 lakh Crores in 2012-13. Prices were then high also because international prices of crude oil were at a record high. Prices were high despite the subsidies given by the UPA Government to diesel, kerosene and LPG, which provided a cushion to domestic consumers.\n\nThe BJP Government at the Centre, on the other hand, has been busy lowering or withdrawing subsidies. And despite oil prices in international markets having remained consistently low for the last six years, Indian consumers have continued to pay a high price.\n\n\nWe should not forget the fact that the international crude oil prices fluctuated above $110/barrel between 2011-2013 and threatened fiscal discipline and deficit of the central government with the oil import bills upsetting estimates.\n\nCentral Government deregulated the prices of petrol on 25.06.2010 and diesel on 19.10.2014, as the subsidies spiraled up due to the high international crude oil price, which resulted in large holes in central finances. But over the years, the fuel have become one of the biggest tax revenue contributors to the Union Government. The excise duty collection by Government directly comes from a handful of refineries, therefore it is swift and efficient unlike other taxes. As per the data by PPAC, the crude oil price per barrel, which cost $107.14/barrel (‚Çπ6655.54/barrel) in March 2014 fell to $41.53/barrel (Rs.3050.38/barrel) in October, 2020\nPetrol and diesel prices on 15.03.2014 were ‚Çπ73.20/litre and ‚Çπ55.48/litre respectively which have now soared to a historical high as Petrol and diesel prices touched ‚Çπ90.34/litre and ‚Çπ80.51/litre respectively in Mumbai on December 16, 2020.\n\nLet us examine Delhi‚Äôs fuel prices to understand how taxes are levied on both petrol and diesel. As of December 16, 2020, prices of petrol and diesel in Delhi were ‚Çπ83.71 and ‚Çπ73.87 respectively. However, the base price including freight of Petrol is still ‚Çπ27.74 per litre, which is just 33.1% of the retail selling price (RSP) of ‚Çπ83.71. In case of diesel, this is ‚Çπ28.66, i.e., 38.8% of the RSP.\n\nFrom every single litre of petrol sold in Delhi, the central government now collects ‚Çπ32.98 as central excise duty, which is 119% of the base price including freight while the state VAT comes to ‚Çπ19.32, which is 70% of the base price including freight.\n\nSimilarly, in case of diesel, the Central excise duty is ‚Çπ31.83, which is 111% of the base price including freight and State VAT is ‚Çπ10.85, ie, 37.9% of the base price including freight.\n\nAs per the data provided by the Petroleum Planning &amp; Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the Petroleum Ministry, during 2019-20, Central Government collected ‚Çπ2.23 lakh Crores from excise duty on fuel. The Union Budget 2020-21 anticipated ‚Çπ2.67 lakh Crores as excise duty from the fuel, which comes 16.3% of the total tax revenue of ‚Çπ16.539 lakh crores.\n\nThe present excise duty on petrol is ‚Çπ32.98, which, when UPA-2 left office was just ‚Çπ9.48 per litre. In other words, excise duty on petrol is 348% higher now than in 2014. Similarly, the present excise duty on diesel is ‚Çπ31.83 which has increased by 894% more than ‚Çπ3.56, when UPA-2 remitted office.\n\nThe central government not only hiked the excise duty but they have also tweaked its components in such a way that the component which goes to the divisible pool to be shared among states is reduced substantially while the Cess, which goes to the Centre‚Äôs kitty, increases. The central government has strict regulatory control and say over how the Cess shall be shared among the states under various Centrally Sponsored Schemes.\n\nWhen UPA-2 left office, the basic excise duty that went to the divisible pool was ‚Çπ6.35 out of a total excise duty of ‚Çπ9.48, ie, 67%. But now the basic excise duty has shrunk to ‚Çπ2.98 out of the total excise duty of ‚Çπ32.98, ie, just 9% of the total excise duty collected by the Centre.\n\nSimilarly,the current basic excise duty on diesel going to the divisible pool and collected by the Centre is ‚Çπ4.83, ie, 15.2% of the total excise duty of ‚Çπ31.83. This is a classic example of the hypocrisy of the principle of co-operative federalism by which the Prime Minister and the BJP Government at the Centre swear.\n\nThis BJP Government has hiked and tweaked the excise duty 15 times after assuming office in 2014.\n\nIndian citizens are now conditioned to pay high fuel prices, thanks to exorbitant taxation by the central government, and they limit their outrage in social media and take the burden without any protest.\n\nSome experts believe petroleum products should be brought under the GST as a panacea for the high taxation now imposed on the fuel. But as total taxation on petrol by both Centre and state governments comes to 189% of the base price and freight, how to bring fuel prices under a flat and uniform GST regime is a great conundrum waiting to be solved'<br />Author: 'lucifersci'<br />id: 'kjc57n'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'Why muslims and christians are better than Hindus.'<br />Body: "‡§ú‡§¨ ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§∏‡•ç‡§≤‡§ø‡§Æ ‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§™‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ö ‡§∏‡§æ‡§≤ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö‡•á ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§æ‡•ò‡§æ‡§Ø‡§¶‡§æ ‡§®‡§Æ‡§æ‡•õ ‡§™‡•ù‡§§‡•á ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•Ç‡§Å ‡§§‡•ã ‡§≤‡§ó‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§∏‡•ç‡§≤‡§ø‡§Æ ‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§Ø‡•á ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡•Ä ‡§ö‡•Ä‡•õ ‡§π‡•à ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§µ‡•ã ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡§æ ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•Ä ‡§Ö‡§ó‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§™‡•Ä‡•ù‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡•õ‡§∞‡•Ç‡§∞ ‡§¶‡•á‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡•§ ‡§ï‡•Å‡§õ ‡§™‡•Å‡§ö‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§§‡•ã ‡§ï‡•Å‡§õ ‡§°‡§∞‡§æ‡§ï‡§∞ , ‡§≤‡•á‡§ï‡§ø‡§® ‡§â‡§®‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§®‡•Ä‡§Ç‡§µ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§≤ ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ó‡§π‡§∞‡•á ‡§ò‡•Å‡§∏‡•á ‡§π‡•ã‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à ‡•§\n\n‡§Ø‡§π‡•Ä ‡•ô‡•Ç‡§¨‡§∏‡•Ç‡§∞‡§§‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§ø‡§ñ‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à ‡•§ ‡§∏‡§∞‡§¶‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§Ø‡§¶‡§ø ‡§™‡§ó‡§°‡§º‡•Ä ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§â‡§∏‡§ï‡•á ‡§ï‡•á‡§∂ ‡§Ü‡§¶‡§ø ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§â‡§Ç‡§ó‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§â‡§†‡§æ‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•Ä  ‡§â‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§µ‡•ò‡•ç‡§§ ‡§§‡•á‡•õ ‡§Ü‡§µ‡§æ‡•õ ‡§Ü‡§™ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§∞‡•ã‡§ï ‡§¶‡•á‡§ó‡•Ä ‡•§\n\n‡§≤‡§ó‡§≠‡§ó ‡§π‡§∞ ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§®‡§ø‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•á ‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡§® ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•á‡§∑ ‡§ú‡•ã‡§∞ ‡§¶‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡•§\n\n‡§π‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ç ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§ö‡§æ‡§π‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§ø‡§§‡§®‡§æ ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡§æ‡§®‡•á ‡§π‡•ã‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§¶‡§æ‡§µ‡§æ ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§≤‡•á , ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§á‡§∏‡§ï‡§æ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ ‡§Ö‡§¨ ‡§∏‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§´ ‡§∏‡§∞‡§®‡•á‡§Æ ‡§§‡§ï ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§ ‡§π‡•ã‡§§‡§æ ‡§ú‡§æ ‡§∞‡§π‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡•§\n\n‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç ‡§Ö‡§ï‡•ç‡§∏‡§∞ ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•Ç‡§Å ‡§ï‡§ø \n‡§è‡§ï ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Å ‡§Ü‡§∞‡§§‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§π‡•Ä ‡§π‡•ã‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à , ‡§â‡§∏‡§ï‡§æ ‡§¨‡•á‡§ü‡§æ ‡§ú‡§≤‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§õ‡•ã‡•ú ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à , ‡§≤‡•ú‡§ï‡§æ ‡§ï‡•Ç‡§≤-‡§°‡•Ç‡§° ‡§π‡•à , ‡§â‡§∏‡•á ‡§á‡§§‡§®‡§æ ‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§® ‡§π‡•à ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§ó‡•à‡§∞‡•õ‡§∞‡•Ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à ‡•§\n\n‡§¨‡•á‡§ü‡•Ä ‡§á‡§∏‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§§‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§â‡§∏‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•à‡§≤‡•ã‡§∞‡•Ä‡•õ ‡•õ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§¶‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç , ‡§â‡§∏‡•á ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•Ä ‡§´‡§ø‡§ó‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ö‡§ø‡§Ç‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡•§\n\n‡§õ‡§§ ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§ñ‡•ú‡•á ‡§Ö‡§Ç‡§ï‡§≤ ‡§ú‡§¨ ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ú‡§≤ ‡§ö‡•ù‡§æ‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§§‡•ã ‡§≤‡•ú‡§ï‡•á ‡§π‡§Å‡§∏‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡•§\n\n‡§á‡§∏ ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§π‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§Ö‡§∞‡•á!

Yasmintsarvaani bhutaanyaatmaivaabhuudvijaanatah Tatra ko mohah kah shokah ekatvamanupasyatah- Yajurveda 40.7\n\n "Those who see all beings as souls do not feel infatuation or anguish at their sight, for they experience oneness with them."  \n\nBreehimattam yavamattamatho maashamatho tilam Esha vaam bhaago nihito ratnadheyaaya dantau maa hinsishtam pitaram maataram cha\n\nAtharvaveda 6.140.2 "O teeth! You eat rice, you eat barley, you eat gram and you eat sesame. These are specifically meant for you. \n\nDo not kill those who are capable of being fathers and mothers."the wording is pretty unambiguous here, do not kill those capable of producing progeny on their own for food,almost all of the animal kingdom except some asexual organisms\n\nAnother mantra in Atharvaveda says, "It is definitely a great sin to kill innocents. Do not kill our cows, horses and people.\n\n"Atharvaveda 10.1.29Anumantaa vishasitaa nihantaa krayavikrayee Samskartaa chopahartaa cha khadakashcheti ghaatakaah \n\nManusmrithi 5.51 Those who permit slaying of animals; those who bring animals for slaughter; those who slaughter; those who sell meat; those who purchase meat; those who prepare dish out of it; those who serve that meat and those who eat are all murderers.\n\nanother one condemning killing of animals capable of reproduction\n\nYa aamam maansamadanti paurusheyam cha ye kravih Garbhaan khaadanti keshavaastaanito naashayaamasi Atharvaveda 8.6.23  We ought to destroy those who eat cooked as well as uncooked meat, meat involving destruction of males and females, foetus and eggs.\n\nAghnyaa yajamaanasya pashoonpahi Yajurveda 1.1  ‚ÄúO human! animals are Aghnya ‚Äì not to be killed. Protect the animals\n\n‚ÄùDwipaadava Chatushpaatpaahi Yajurveda 14.8  Protect the bipeds and quadrupeds!\n\neven the etymology of terms used for meat eaters in the vedic period makes it clear that meat eaters were looked down upon-\n\nKravy da ‚Äìkravya\\[ meat obtained from slaughter\\] + Ada \\[ the eater\\]‚Äîthe meat eater. \n\n Pisacha ‚Äî pisita \\[meat\\] +asa \\[eater\\]‚Äîthe meat eater.  \n\nAsutrpa ‚Äî Asu \\[breath of life\\] + trpa \\[one who satisfies himself on\\]‚Äîone who takes others life for his meals.  \n\nGarba da and Anda da ‚Äì the foetus and egg eaters.  \n\nMans da ‚Äì the meat eaters\n\nUrjam no dhehi dwipade chatushpade Yajurveda 11.83  ‚ÄúMay all bipeds and quadrupeds gain strength and nourishment‚Äù  \n\nThis mantra is recited by Hindus before every meal. How could the same philosophy which prays for well-being of every soul in every moment of life, approve of killing animals?\n\nI mean,it was too naive to think so dudethat a philosophy that views all creatures as equals souls that are part of bramhan,how can such a culture promote meat-eating\n\nbut it\'s not your or my fault,we only get to read what the foreigner "indologists" interpret for us, and they clearly have always done it so as to brainwash Sanatanis and promote their vested interests\n\nI did some reading into the yajnas and the process to conduct yajnas as well, animal sacrifice throughout yajnas,occult was something looked down upon in most slokasThe Rigveda describes Yajna as Adhvara or non violent throughout. Same is the case with all the other Vedas. How can it be then concluded that the Vedas permit violence or slaughter of animals?  The biggest accusation of cattle and cow slaughter comes in the context of the Yajnas that derived their names from different cattle like the Ashwamedh Yajna, the Gomedha Yajna and the Nar-medh Yajna. \n\nEven by the wildest stretch of the imagination the word Medha would not mean slaughter in this context.in fact this is what the Yajurveda says about slaughter of a horse\n\nImam ma himsirekashafam pashum kanikradam vaajinam vaajineshu Yajurveda 13.48  Do not slaughter this one hoofed animal that neighs and who goes with a speed faster than most of the animalsAswamedha does not mean horse sacrifice at Yajna. \n\nInstead the Yajurveda clearly mentions that a horse ought not to be slaughtered.  In Shathapatha, Ashwa is a word for the nation or empire  The word medha does not mean slaughter. It denotes an act done in accordance to the intellect Alternatively it could mean consolidation, as evident from the root meaning of medha i.e. medhru san-ga-me \n\n Raashtram vaa ashwamedhah Annam hi gau Agnirvaa ashwah Aajyam medhah (Shatpath [13.1.6.3](http://13.1.6.3/)) or as the arya samaj founder, Dayanand saraswati said as well\n\nA Yajna dedicated to the glory, wellbeing and prosperity of the Rashtra the nation or empire is known as the Ashwamedh yajna.  ‚ÄúTo keep the food pure or to keep the senses under control, or to make the food pure or to make a good use of the rays of Sun or keep the earth free from impurities\\[clean\\] is called Gomedha Yajna‚Äù.  ‚ÄúThe word Gau also means the Earth and the yajna dedicated to keep the Earth the environment clean is called Gomedha Yajna‚Äù \n\n ‚ÄúThe cremation of the body of a dead person in accordance with the principles laid down in the Vedas is called Naramedha Yajna‚Äù\n\nThe same principle is observed clearly in the classification of the three kinds of traits in the vedic culture- Satogun or the "noblest of all" food habits help develop the noblest of mindsets and traits,it\'s supposed to a pure vegetarian diet also excluding any pungent materials like onion and garlic,or chilli as well\n\nGods and devas are supposed to belong to this class,meat can\'t be offered to them as prasadam,anywhere where it\'s done is probably an occult or tantric traditioneven rigveda abolishes slaughter of BOTH cows and bull\n\nAare gohaa nrhaa vadho vo astu Rigveda 7.56.17the sloka says that murder of a cow is equivalent to human murder\n\nSooyavasaad bhagavatee hi bhooyaa atho vayam bhagvantah syaama Addhi trnamaghnye vishwadaaneem piba shuddhamudakamaacharantee \n\nRigveda 1.164.40 or Atharv 7.73.11 or Atharv 9.10.20  The Aghnya cows ‚Äì which are not to be killed under any circumstances‚Äì may keep themselves healthy by use of pure water and green grass, so that we may be endowed with virtues, knowledge and wealth.\n\netymology in the vedic lexicon Nighantu agrees as well\n\nAghnya the one that ought not to be killed \n\nAhi the one that must not be slaughtered. \n\nAditi the one that ought not to be cut into pieces.\n\n  These three names of cow signify that the animal ought not to be put to tortures. These words appear frequently throughout the Vedas in context of the cow.\n\nMaa gaamanaagaamaditim vadhishta Rigveda 8.101.15 \n\nDo not kill the cow. Cow is innocent and aditi ‚Äì that ought not to be cut into pieces\n\nMaa gaamanaagaamaditim vadhishta Rigveda 8.101.15 \n\nDo not kill the cow. Cow is innocent and aditi ‚Äì that ought not to be cut into pieces\n\nAntakaaya goghaatam Yajurveda 30.18 Destroy those who kill cows\n\nThe entire 28th Sukta or Hymn of 6th Mandal of Rigveda sings the glory of cow.\n\n Aa gaavo agnamannuta bhadramakrantseedantu \n\n Bhooyobhooyo rayimidasya vardhayannabhinne\n\n  Na taa nashanti na dabhaati taskaro naasaamamitro\n\n vyathiraa dadharshati  Na taa arvaa renukakaato ashnute \n\nna samskritramupa yanti taa abhi  Gaavo bhago gaava indro me achhaan \n\n Yooyam gaavo medayathaa  Maa vah stena eeshata maaghanshasah \n\n 1. Everyone should ensure that cows are free from miseries and kept healthy.\n\n 2. God blesses those who take care of cows. \n\n3. Even the enemies should not use any weapon on cows \n\n4. No one should slaughter the cow \n\n5. Cow brings prosperity and strength\n\n  6. If cows keep healthy and happy, men and women shall also keep disease free and prosperous  \n\n7.

A Comparison of the Maratha and Durrani Army'<br />Body: '(This was to be my final post in my series, but I\'ve decided to provided a detailed analysis of the two armies and the battle separately, and my own conclusions in the end. Thanks to everyone who has interacted with these posts)\n\n\n\nTHE MARATHA ARMY AT PANIPAT :\n\n\n\nNature of the Army \n\n\nThe Maratha army present at Panipat was an opposite of the armies commanded by Shivaji Maharaj during his legendary campaigns. His army had one Supreme commander, himself and was predominantly infantry with limited cavalry.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, at Panipat, the army was one where with the exception of Gardi Infantry, the remaining army of largely cavalry and the force although under the command of Bhau, had many allegiances to Sardars, Rajas and other feudal lords.\n\n\n\nMaratha Cavalry\n\n\nThe cavalry consisted of 4 classes :\n\n\nThe "Khasgi Paga" or Peshwa\'s private cavalry, was heavily equipped, armoured and trained. At Panipat, these were at a strength of 6000 apart from the 37,000 total cavalry under different chiefs. The Marathas usually used melee weapons on horseback, never being proficient with using firearms on or off the horse. \n\n\nThe "Silhedars" were paid lower than the Khasgi and hence were relatively less armored.\n\n\n\nThe "Ekas" were individual volunteers, who brought their own horses and equipment.\n\n\n\nThe "Pindaris" were a plundering, mercenary force that was laid out of what it could loot. They were mostly ill equipped and very less reliable.\n\n\n\nMaratha Artillery\n\n\n\nThis department of the Maratha Army was more a handicap than an asset during the Battle of Panipat. The Guns were relatively well cast, but were carried in clumsy carriages. No standard calibre existed, and balls were cast indiscriminately. Hence, when being shot the guns would be damaged. Not to mention, poor logistics meant a long baggage train that trudged along at a snail\'s pace.\n\n\nA word ought to be said about the Gardis. Ibrahim Gardi was present at Udgir and his Gardis played a pivotal role in the victory. Hence the Bhau and Ibrahim grew close and bought advocated for pitched battles, which went against traditional Maratha understanding of war. Hence, the traditional sections of the army and the Gardis had bad blood.\n\n\n\nTHE DURRANI AND HIS ALLIED ARMY :\n\n\n\nNature and Organisation :\n\n\nThe army was divided into the Askar-e-Munazzam, literally Regular Army, and the Askar-i-Ghair Munazzam, the Irregular Army. The Regular Army constitued 1/3rd of the Durrani forces. While the latter, constituted of tribal horsemen, constituted the remaining Durrani Force.\n\n\n\nDurrani Cavalry\n\n\nThe Regular Army was 3/4th cavalry, armed with carbines or muskets, with long scimitars. Protected by buff jackets and often with mail shirts as well as with helmets or chain-twisted turbans. Compared to their Maratha counterpart, these cavalry were proficient in the usage of the firearms, both on and off horseback. They ride Afghan horses, and used lances, etc. \n\n\n\nThe irregular or tribal cavalry, did the reconnaissance duties of Pindaaris but also were held in the reserve and finished the rout by hacking the feeling enemy when they routed. \n\n\n\nDurrani Infantry\n\n\nA 4th of the army was comprised of infantry. Armed with swords and heavy Jezails, these guns allowed for heavier projectiles and more accuracy.\n\n\n\nDurrani Artillery\n\n\n\nThis was the flower of the Durrani force and the Shah\'s pride. 2/3rds were heavy guns and 1/3rd were light pieces. Heavy ordnance was drawn by horses, while the lighter ones such as "Zamburaks" or "Shaturnals" were carried individually, in twos or threes on camel back.\n\n\n\n\nBefore finishing the description, an analysis must be made of the forces of Najib-ud-Daulah of Rohillas and Shuja-ud-Daulah of Awadh.\n\n\nNajib-ud-Daulah and his Afghans:\n\n\n\nNajib had organised his regiments in imitation of the European system. They were armed with matchlock and swords, while the Matchlocks had bayonets attacked to them.\n\n\n\nThey were taught to draw and fire by order and were drilled in simple and useful maneuvers using Persian words of command.\n\n\n\nHe also had a contingent of sappers and war rockets.\n\n\nShuja-ud-Daulah of Awadh:\n\n\n\nShuja-ud-Daulah, had a detachment of Gosain and Purbiya Infantry and Qizilbash Cavalry. These troops were the envy of many. The Qizilbash cavalry were the horsemen, introduced by Nadir Shah and those who had stayed in India in service of Saadat Khan and his family.\n\n\n\nThe Purbiyas, are renowned even by the Europeans as the fines infantry in the subcontinent and were, in the words of European contemporaries, a match for the European infantry.\n\n\n\nA COMPARISON :\n\n\n\nThe fundamental difference between the forces was of firepower, discipline and maneuver.\n\n\n\nThe Marathas had become an imitation of the slow marching Mughals, and would spend months in their marches. They had heavy and extensive baggage trains, further encumbered by numerous non combatants.\n\n\n\nThe Durrani payed a premium on movement. He emphasised speed and mobility. His flexible light artillery was a step in this direction.\n\n\n\n\nThe Marathas had dithered in the realm of discipline as well. In one instance, Vithal Shivdeo, in 1758, was ordered to Patna by Raghunath Rao. Instead he looted the outskirts of Delhi. When this incident was brought to Bhau\'s attention, Antaji Mankeshwar said that Vithal was beyond reproach as he was backed by Malharrao Holkar.\n\n\n\nIn sharp contrast, when an incident of a few Abdali cavalrymen, who had disrupted Shuja-ud-Daulah\'s camp was brought to Ahmad Shah\'s attention, he ordered to have their "noses bored with arrows and strings passed through those holes. They were led in such condition to Shuja-ud-Daulah, who would punish them as he saw fit."\n\n\n\nOverall, the Marathas also lacked in firepower because of the obvious differences in the military traditions of the Durrani and the Marathas and also because the Maratha Artillery was still underdeveloped.\n\n\n\nHence, the Marathas, sadly, suffered from logistical, organisational and disciplinary problems. Here the Shah had an edge.

Now, we have bought howitzers from US, South Korea and now thinking of buying from Israel. We already have great howitzers made by DRO, Tata and Kalyani group which are really good and worth looking into but India is going with Israeli gun.\n\nThis got to be corruption and nothing else can explain this decision. \n\n\nWe bought 3 squadrons Rafale instead of buying in bulk.'<br />Author: 'udupa82'<br />id: 'ki2l90'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li><li>Title: 'Daily discussion, screenshots, randirona, and rant post here'<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\nDaily discussion, screenshots, randirona, and rant post here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNew users introduce yourselves here.
