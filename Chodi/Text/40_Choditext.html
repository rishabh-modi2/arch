<li>Title: 'How to Preserve Protect and Promote Hinduism. A morning read for everyone busy in making memes.'<br />Body: 'We can see all these manifestations of Adharma today in our society. There are a number of inimical forces like Islamism and evangelism trying to break India and dismantle Hinduism\n\nIn short, ‘doing nothing’ is no longer an option. Doing-nothing implies being passive collaborators of forces inimical to Hindu civilization.\n\n# The Three P’s for Hindu Survival\n\nThe Three P’s are: **Preserve, Protect, and Promote**.\n\nPreserving Hindu civilization implies preserving and enriching our knowledge systems, traditions, institutions, and practices.\n\nProtecting Hindu civilization implies protecting all our traditions and practices from internal as well as external attacks. It involves the protection of our self-hood and prevention of distortion of our beliefs, knowledge, and practices. involves the protection of our self-hood and prevention of distortion of our beliefs, knowledge, and practices.\n\nPromoting Hindu civilization implies promoting our knowledge, practices, and values to the external world. It is vital for us to involve in such promotion that provides access to authentic knowledge and practices for the good of humanity and at the same time ensure that dilution and digestion of those knowledge practices are prevented.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What Hindus can do as Individuals:\n\n**On preservation front:**\n\n* If one is of intellectual bent, he/she can take up study of the Shastras.\n* Such study itself could be divided into various specialization: Veda-adhyayana, Dharmashastra, Arthashastra, Kamashastra, Itihasa-Puranas, Kavya, Vyakarana, Ayurveda, folk knowledge, etc.\n* A deeper study of these knowledge systems, as well as adding newer research, newer insights, and making the teachings contextual and contemporary to our times is vital.\n* One could also take up any art form- music, dance, theatre, painting, sculpting, folk, classical, to name a few. Such immersion in the art would include both an immersion in the theory and practice of it.\n* One could take up Yoga, Meditation, Ayurveda, Jyotishya, Tantra, etc. all of which represent our Knowledge traditions. These must be studied as a part of Hindu traditional knowledge and not as isolated subjects divorced from traditions.\n* Those of devotional bent must learn stotras, bhajans, take up Katha-vachans, etc.\n* One could even take up Indian traditions of Maths and Science and work to revive them!\n* Preservation of language and literature is another important field.\n* More importantly, parents must educate themselves about Hindu culture and pass on that education to their children. Encourage the children to immersion in Hindu culture and tradition.\n* It is also important for Hindus to donate to preservation of Hindu knowledge systems and practices through donating to various organizations including Veda pathashalas, theatre, art, music, etc. that would help preserve and pass on the knowledge to future generations.\n\n**On the protection front:**\n\n* Hindus need to organize themselves at Mohalla levels. Individuals must take initiatives to bring about such local-level organizing.\n* To begin with, people with similar bent could meet up and draw up an agenda of activities at the local level. Friends, family, and office colleagues could be brought into whenever and wherever possible.\n* Such Mohalla level meetings must focus on local level civilizational issues and then focus upon larger national level issues. Such discussions should not be mere theoretical but include a SWOT analysis and evolve action-oriented plans.\n* They could then evolve various strategies to preserve, protect and promote Hindu civilization and Hindu interests.\n* Awareness campaigns in the form of talks, presentations, etc. could be organized to not only sensitize people about the burning issue, but also for educating the people about Hindu philosophy and values.\n* Programs designed to fulfil preserve, promote, protect goals could be undertaken at Mohalla or city-levels.\n* Active Hindu community groups must be formed especially in demographically critical areas to cater to Hindu interests and counter inimical forces.\n* Wherever possible, physical training, body-fitness regimens, and fighting skills should be imparted, especially to youth and children.\n* Proper education and sensitization of youth to civilizational issues, Hindu history, Hindu philosophy is very much needed.\n* Imparting strong civilizational values and facilitating physical training at combat &amp; self-defense to the children-both boys and girls- is something that Hindu parents must pro-actively pursue.\n* Protection is not only at a physical level, but also at the psychological and narrative level.\n* Hindus should take up the study of deeper aspects of the civilization and counter distortions and negative narratives in the media and academia.\n* Narrative building and on-the-ground activism are both needed.\n* Talks, Workshops, Book-discussion events must be organized.\n* Students must be taught the essentials of Hindu philosophy, practice, history, and civilizational values. Education and rootedness in the civilization must be taken up big away.\n* Hindus must actively partake in social activities wherever possible. Hunger is one of the biggest issue and a social responsibility. Hindus should make a collective effort to ensure no Hindu in the community goes hungry. This would help in developing solidarity in society as well.\n* Hindu families must keep a small portion of their income as ‘Dharmaansh’ and use that money to support organizations, people, and initiatives that pertain to the preservation, protection, and promotion of Hindu causes. Donations could be done to Gaushalas, Veda-Patashalas, Ashrams that are preserving our civilizational ethos or to groups such as Upword, People for Dharma, Indic Collective, India Pride Project, etc. who are working on countering anti-Hindu bias at narrative and legal level.\n* Activism is another important area that Hindus must take up. Those in the legal profession must take up Legal activism in the interest of Hindu society and civilization. Those in the intellectual sphere (media and academia) must take up intellectual activism and counter anti-Hindu bias in media and academia. Those who are in the political sphere must take up Hindu activism at the political level. Lobbying for Hindu interests must be taken up big away at local, state, and national levels.\n\n**On the promotion front**\n\nA lot of activities could be done to promote authentic knowledge without dilution or distortion: Courses, Workshops, Retreats, etc.\n\nThese are merely some of the suggestions that Hindus can implement as individuals. Not everyone can do everything. Every Hindu individual must choose what he/she is inclined to and he/she has competency for. While some may be more inclined to take up intellectual activities, others may be more of a devotion-bent; while some are good at organizing people, some others may be good at combat. We need a collective effort and such an effort if done broadly in the direction of three P’s, then it is definitely possible to not only ensure the survival of Hindu civilization but also its re-blossoming.

<li>Title: 'There needs to be a movement in India that unites us all.'<br />Body: 'What do you think?\n\nI  am an Indian and I\'ve always thought of the name DSI (Divided states of india). There has to be  some guy who can come and unite India strongly. And take care of the  radical polarizing leaders as well. Until that happens we will always  remain the DSI.\n\nIf you  look at our history, we have been always divided. Every time an invader  tried to conquer India there was some traitor or the other who would go  onto the enemy\'s side and try to gain something.\n\nIf  an invader was attacking Punjab/Rajasthan then there would be no help  from other states. Those states were left to defend on their own while  the other states could develop their economy rather than military. It\'s  the "tu mare to mar. Mai apne mein mast hoon." There might have been  exceptions to this so please don\'t waste my time with the exceptions.  The majority of states have been like this only.\n\nWhy?  Because they all had individual kings / princes who had only one  motive. Continue to be the king of small land rather than have a united  and stronger India.\n\nBack in the  days after British independence, there was a big task to unite all  states together. Do you know why? Because those M.C. people just said  "whoever wants to create independent country for their state can do so.  Whoever wants to unite to a common country can do so". There is a whole  documentary on this called "**Pradhan Mantri**" if you haven\'t seen. And  every state wanted to be an independent country. That is the India I  have seen.\n\nEven today if any of  you are in college or working, let me ask you something. How do you get  treated from people from other states? I have good, close friends from  almost every state in India. But many of those are exceptions. The  majority of people you will see hang out with people from their own  states and will shun you. Why? Because you don\'t speak their mother  tongue.\n\nLook in offices. Its only  here in India that you get to see the boss fires, saves people based on  their religion. You will get less work and easy promotion if your boss  if from the same mother tongue as yours. In particular this is extremely  rampant across specific statesmen to such a degree that you can hear an  event about a manager and immediately guess which state they\'re from.  But I am not here to take names.\n\nLook at the people from other states. How do they talk? "Oh you\'re from my state?" - and instant connection.\n\nIndia  is currently divided. But it doesn\'t need to be that way. It can be  united. Provided we have just 5-10 people in the power position who  actually want to unite India. There is NO ONE. Bastardwood just wants to  make money with bar dances, muslim appeasement and "love" stories.  Beejinez people have made enough money to last generations don\'t have to  work. They can do awareness and bring India together. No. They just  want to make more money until their last breath. Such great people. Most  politicians just want to get rich by being traitors to India and coming  on headlines everyday with "grand slams". Do you think they believe in  united states of India? No. They just want their money even if they have  to sell their country for it.\n\nI could still go on but that is the reality. I hope this gets some proper discussion instead of trolls like rindia.'<br />Author: 'mugen_is_here'<br />id: 'g620by'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>

He wasn't part of 1998 tour when Tendulkar swept Warne into nightmares, he wasn't part of Sharjah Cup when Tendulkar decimated Warne, he wasn't part of 2003-04 series as well, and Tendulkar missed half the matches in the 2004 series in India - which was their last Test series opportunity as McGrath would retire one year before the next series.\n\nCome to think of it, the only time Sachin won against Mcgrath was ICC knockout trophy.\n\nHe even out Tendulkar out in the 2003 wc cup final.\n\nNot to mention the reason England won ashes 2005 was when he was out for both of the losing test matches\n\nHe was a master of the sixth stump line, getting batsmen to play at balls they didn't really want to and knicking them off. Exactly the type of bowler you wouldn't want to face when just coming to the crease. 104 ducks from about 500ish wickets is insane, no wonder Australia was so dominant during that period.\n\nHe was the difference between Aus and Ind teams of the 00s. Both had dominant Batting lineups, support seamers and Spinners. What would I not give to have a GOAT like McGrath I'm our Test teams of the 00s.\n\nI've been watching his highlights, the guy always made sure the opposition lost 2 quick wickets and it was always the same, caught behind or edged to slip"<br />Author: 'turkishhawk_2410'<br />id: 'g5ax6b'<br />Flair :OC है बे!</li>

This was made specifically to make us fight. As a result the future generations were so divided that a handful of westerners tilled us for a long time. This correction was never made.\n\nMoreover Gandhi ji approved of caste system in this manner.\n\nSavarkar and ambhekar recommended the abolishing of caste system all together to make our people who have chosen a different faith path to god to come back to the dharma of the land. All this is out there but never revealed or even discussed in the 70 years of "independence" (why ?

Madlad has actually sent his theory that the lizard folks of IB are controlling the country to the PM through the Ministry of Personal, Public grievance. Some snippets of his manifesto:\n"Sir, please read the message in its entirety!\n\n"Allah ho Akbar Allah"\nReverse this sentence and it turns into “Halla rab-ka oh halla” you know what it means in Hindi!\nNow take another example: “Jehad”, now reverse this word and it’ll turn into “Dahej” (dowry).\nI believe there are numerous such phrases and words in the Holy Quran that when reversed can give an altogether different meaning.\nThese words and phrases are being used by certain people (IB) to brainwash innocent naive Muslims and convert them into terrorists. When a Muslim who reads verses of Quran five times a day on daily basis is subjected to this kind of information, he gets mesmerized, astonished, goes docile and will follow the path laid down before him by his perpetrators even if it comes to blowing himself up in the name of God or believing in fighting a Holy war.\n\nThe information that I have mentioned above is more than two decades old. IB (my deduction points towards IB but I can\'t verify the same) used to hypnotize me since my childhood days. Once they received this piece of information they not only sat on it for more than 2 decades, they also used it. The Mumbai attacks, the stone pelters in Kashmir, the terrorism that exists in Kashmir are all being perpetrated by the IB.\n\n\nThere is no democracy in our country, we never attained freedom. The British ruled us for centuries and instilled IB, which organised and spread its network across India. You find them in every village, town and city. When the British left they appointed a few powerful people at the top who would control democracy and they always function with secrecy and never see the light.

His credibility as a source of Pusthun history is beyond reproach. His exact quote is reproduced below with complete fidelity:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“The Valour of Sikh Army during the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, under the leadership of the historically most ferocious General Hari Singh Nalwa came to the Frontier in the 1820\'s and swiftly conquered our ancestors. It is the only time in Recorded History that our people were ever ruled over by foreigners (Indians). The locals were so utterly terrified of the Sikh Army that they used to hide every time the Sikhs came into view. Those that decided to resist were met with utter ruthlessness. During this time, the word was spread around that the Sikhs Never harm elderly people, Women and Children and that the local men who did not wish to earn wrath of the Sikhs should wear the garb of Punjabi women, which was the Salwar-Kameez. At that time in our history both men and women alike, wore only a single-robe garment (similar to that worn by the Arabs) and the Gallant honourable Sikh\'s would not harm any man either  wearing a Salwar-Kameez.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo you see, our men happily adopted the garb of Punjabi women since they were too terrified to stand up and they have adopted the garb as being theirs\' ever since. I am very intrigued to see that you are following in the footsteps of your ancestors by wearing the adopted Punjabi women\'s garb as your own, but now go around preaching and coercing our women as to how they should be living their lives! I suggest that take a deep look inside yourselves, given this historical perspective."\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease see the following references for corrobaration:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNalwa, V. 2009.

We cheered our heroes (Medical Staff, Police, etc) and were looking forward to flatening the curve.\n\nOur collective anger was directed at China. On twitter I could see Indians taking the lead in roasting the shit out of China. From thinkers of various think tanks to the common man, everyone contributed in driving the narrative against the Chinese on the social media.\n\nAnd then Tabligi Jamaat happened. And all our anger, that was directed outwards got directed inwards. The curve that was about get straightened gained a lot of gradient. The India that seemed united, even for brief, got divided once again, with infighting within the nation. \n\nAll of this doesn't help but make me think what if India was indeed a Hindu Rastra. What if we had muslims but not in the same proportion as we have now. After all, 90% of all Muslims in India at the time before partition demanded for a separate state. Who indeed thought it was a good idea to provide them a separate state, and also have them have a say in a Hindu majority country which eventually had to become a secular country.\n\nI can't help but think where we would have been without this infighting we have had for so many years. How much at peace we would have felt? how wonderfully we would have cooperated with our heroes at different critical times throughout our post independence history.\n\nI am pretty sure, Muslims too who are currently in India, if they had a Muslim majority country to live in, would have felt more comfortable practicing their customs and religion, and not be under scrutinity  of others. In 1947, Jinnah was right and he provided what was needed by his supporters and Gandhi and Nehru were wrong. Even after dividing Bharat into pieces which broke our hearts, we the supporters still ended up living with the problems that caused the partition. \n\nIn order for India to ever have a chance of becoming a superpower, we must be outward looking with very less internal infighting. But given the current demographic situation in India, we will never be able to do that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the rant.

She told me and I understood she wanted to go to the doctor. So I teamed up with my other wife to take her to the doctor. Because she couldn't wear Burkha, people started looking at my beloved wife like it was some bizzare sight. Fuck these bhakts.i finally understood why women should wear Burkhas. It is to protect them from these perverts. I became a greater believer in my ideology. I brought her to the local clinic and they told me to go to the Vet. What the fuck is meant by Vet? I do not understand how Endians make up such weird stuff. So the doctors refused treatment for my wife because he was an Islamophobe. I got angry and asked someone nearby where is the nearest Vet. They showed me the way. He looked like a kafir but Kafirs can never help others. He is a bulla in disguise I am sure. So I went to the Vet and found it was filled with more people like me. My wife immediately took a liking in the crowd and started talking to the other wives. Meanwhile some bhakts brought their cows over there. They are such idiots. Does it look like a clinic for cows? My wife also wanted to break free of her ropes but we didn't allow that because we respect women's rights. The doctor there was nice. He gave some medications and told me to come to him again in a few weeks. \n\nAfter 2 weeks I wanted to take her for a final checkup. I wanted to decrease the sexism about my wife and believed in my religion. So I forcefully made her wear a Burkha. But to my horror, these Sanghi Perverts started looking at my wife even more. Fuck you RSS. But the doctor told everything was OK and I breathed a sign of relief. \n\nSo I wanted my wife to vote. It is important for women to vote, right? I will vote only for Kejruddin and no one else. But the Sanghi Government told me that my wife cannot vote. They also told that I was retarded. You see how much discrimination we face daily because of Modi? He is not letting women to vote. \n\nMy brother told me to go to Mamta didi's place so she can get a Voter Id. \nBut can I get a Voter Id without an Aadhar card? \nAlso my wife ate all my Kagaz so I couldn't find our aadhar cards or birth certificates.

I have recognized that most of the librandus are well meaning people who wish the best for the world they live in. All humans form their world views on concepts, concepts build on more concepts and form stories and narratives. If you change the definition, or understanding of a concept in someone\'s head, you can change their world view.\n\nMost of these guys hate \'hindutva\', and they should, because the concept of Hindutva as told to them by the media they are exposed to is incorrect, and we will fight with them because we understand hindutva differently. So, I explain them this fundamental part of human nature and get them to agree on it. Once they understand that different definitions/understanding of the same concept leads to conflict, you strike in by challenging the foundations of their cultural identity, their world view. This statement helps\n\n&gt;"Hindu is a geographical, civilisational identity, it is not a religious identity"  \nMake it possible for them to understand that hindu muslim is a valid identity. Do the same thing, tell them what a religion is, and whatever hindus do isn\'t religious. \n\nAt some point they might say that historical contexts don\'t matter anymore, that they aren\'t religious or cultural and to them only material developments matter. Infra, economy, etc. Tell them cultural development needs to go hand in hand, and then make this point which is fairly balanced and should make them reconsider. The gist is summarised in a comment of mine :  \n\n\n&gt;So there are two schools of thoughts.   \nIndividualism,  where you live only for yourself and thus your history is only the  memory that you have experienced. This memory is needed for you to drive  ahead otherwise you\'ll be lost on the street it you have no idea who  you are, where you\'re coming from, and why did you even step out. So  memory is important.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Now, a civilization is a super organism, made of us organisms like us humans. And history is the memory of this civilisation.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Second  school of thought is that I\'m part of this culture, I can think because  I\'ve been taught language and fed and brought up safe. And so I\'ll see  myself as part of the culture.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Two  different lenses. Now if you look at Delhi riots, you don\'t know  history, you will rationalise it as anger, lack of education, etc.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I  know history, I have more information, more data points and there are  patterns that emerge out in this universe. So I understand the cause  better, with much more depth.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You  can choose to live for yourself, it\'s one of the many ways to live but  then you lose the right, and the moral ground to speak on the behalf of  civilisational. You shouldn\'t even speak about architectures. Anything  etc.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If you want to take a stand  on civilisation, you need to first understand it, and that it by reading  history, the memory of the civilisation.  \n\n\nMake them understand how unemployment is a consequence of history, and not a random whack a mole problem that appears once in a while. You have to convince them to respect history, to search for the true meaning behind this outer identity they wear ("Indian"). If you are able to help them realise, even as a momentary spark that their concept, or understanding of India is completely wrong and is based on the narratives of breaking India forces, give them some time to do research.  \n\n\nThis has worked for me in 3 cases, 2 ongoing and failed in 1, some people just don\'t want to be part of a civilisation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;'<br />Author: 'sharmaji_ka_dost'<br />id: 'g1pfd8'<br />Flair :Bakchod News</li>

<li>Title: "Indian History in academia—it's deep seated problems (contributing to the randian-esque self hating attitudes among large swathes of our population), it's remedies (short and long term), and making do of what's on our hands."<br />Body: 'The following is a list of prominent Indian Historians in academia most of whom are dead but whose works have and continue to serve as a foundation for others entering this field—\n\n1)  R.S. Sharma, Satish Chandra, Bipan Chandra― *NCERT History Books\' (the prescribed textbooks for CBSE schools) primary authors with independent academic works of their own, all using the Marxist Approach of viewing History with the lenses of socioeconomic interaction between "oppressor and the oppressed".*\n\n\n\n\n2)  Romila Thapar, Irfan Habib― *NCERT Supporting Historians of the above three with independent works of their own, writing from a Marxist approach which completely denounces schools which view Indian History from a "communal viewpoint", that is as a conflict between Hindus and Muslims.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3)  RC Majumdar— *The lone historian writing from a somewhat nationalistic point of view, who holds that it\'s impossible not to see Indian history with a "communal" lens, seeing as how religion was often a driving factor between both the invasions and the subsequent treatment of the invaded. His 11 volume magnum-opus, which took 26 years to complete, captures the entire history of India from prehistoric times till it\'s independence.* \n\n\n\n\nIt\'s little surprise then, that our kids grow up with a colonial hangover being sympathetic to the very people who invaded and destroyed large swathes of the indigenous culture.\n\nSo what should RW Indians who want history to be shown from the "right side" do??\n\nThe obvious answer would be to encourage more and more right leaning people to get into arts and humanities (which is dominated by left leaning ones the world over), and change the entire system from within. While that\'s certainly the long term aim, we can make do with what\'s on our hand for the time being too. \n\nMost of the above marxist historians, despite having heavily "anti-nationalistic/hindu" overtones, do have their moments where they mildly or even strongly espouse patriotic/pro "dhārmic" ideas.\n\nWhile Romila Thapar views Aurangzeb as a "gentleman", her debunking of the myth of Buddhist persecution at the hands of Hindus, as often alleged by radical Ambedkarites, is noteworthy and is well backed by archaeological and literary sources.\n\nSimilarly, Bipan Chandra has often downplayed the atrocities committed by the Muslim rulers of the 17the/18th century and even offered apologetic justifications foe violence in the case of rulers like Tipu Sultan of Mysore. However, he is pretty patriotic when it comes to the Indian struggle for independence against the British, never once lapsing into *British colonialism was good for India* mode. \n                                      This is in stark contrast to RC Majumdar who, while being staunchly nationalistic when writing about ancient and medieval India , falls in the camp of "colonialism wasn\'t as bad as it\'s made out to be" in his writings on the struggle against the British.\n\nWhile a complete historical ~~revisionism~~ correction is the only permanent solution to rid our coming generations of the insecurity and self hatred à la randians, we (as in our generation) can make do with what has been done so far too, if only we learn to glean the "cash" from the "trash".'<br />Author: 'TerryMcGinnis1999'<br />id: 'g1nyso'<br />Flair :Research</li>

<li>Title: "Making anti-muslim memes won't help at all! A Discussion."<br />Body: "So before Judging me and calling me a librandu, please read the post.\n\nToday I posted a [meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/g0qdpl/be_like_meenakshi/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) in which i tried to mention the pseudo secularism of the librandus. I failed miserably, thinking about why, makes me realise that i have been making anti muslim memes, reading anti muslim comments for a long time now, which also makes me think that i have lost my creativity and sense of humour.\n\nIts very high time that we need to understand.\n\n# Muslims are not our enemies.\n\nOur enemies are those Jaichand hindus, those liberandu jerks, propagandists like Kunal Kamra, Anurag Kashyap. Weather you agree with me or not, but the history is proof that many wars have been lost, many people have died only due to these people. They work on the ideology of\n\n ***Phoot dalo Raj karo***\n\nWhile we are making memes on muslims they are establishing false narratives about India and Hindus around the world. We say us viraat but no we aren't. Sorry to say but talking about being united and strong on the Internet doesn't make you strong ion real life. Don't be offended and think, if I am organising a protest against the government for the wrong and biased education provided the education system, how many of you viraat will come forward? how many of you will leave their comfort zones and join the protests? Not more than 10%,.\n\nHave you seen the interview of the girl who was saying Pakistan Zindabad in Owaisi rally? How proudly she admits that there is a gang working behind her a team of experts who advises her and others to do things like that. That clearly show how slowly they our making the students like them, using them for the propaganda right under our nose.\n\nPlease give it a thought,\n\n* The knowledge being given to the school children\n* The ancient history being altered by Islamic scholars and historians\n* Organisations like RSS, VHP being given terrorist label\n* False anti India propaganda by biased and paki funded journalist, \n* The protests and the ideologies spread  by universities like Jamia Milia and JNU\n* Parties like PFI, people like Kanahiya Kumar being given the right to fight elections\n\nDoesn't these concern you?\n\nNow some will say we have elected Modi and he will manage all these things, Don't you see the how Modi is a fascist Hindu supremacist in the eyes of people around the world(except Japan,Israel and Russia). TO stop the growth of muslims refugees he brought up CAA, what happened? Shaheen Bagh? Riots? India as a racist country around the world? \n\nYou may say that it doesn't matter what the world thinks about India, we don't need gora validation . And that's okay on a personal level, but here is the problem, we cant think above the personal level. please put your ego aside for a minute and think about it.\n\nIf just bringing a bill which stops Muslim Immigration in India can cause this much havoc in India? How much will a Population Control Law for muslims will?\n\n Now coming to Hindu rashtra,What does it exactly mean?\n\n1. It means that Muslims cannot marry 4 wives and give birth to many children. Maximum 2 kids with only one wife.\n2. Mass and Illegal Christian conversions are banned. Scheduled Caste people who converted to Christianity will lose their SC Status and all the benefits, Ever heard of Sunni-Christian? or Catholic Muslim? No. Then what is Dalit Christian? Same is the case with OBC, ST or even 10% reservations to OC. Such benefits are exclusively for followers of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism or Sikhism.\n3. If a Hindu girl/woman marries a Muslim guy/man, then the boy/man must convert to Hinduism. Also, if a Muslim girl/woman marries a Hindu boy then the girl/woman has to convert to Hinduism. Their kids will be Hindus for sure.\n4. Hindi will not be imposed on India at all. Sanskrit is the Mother of all our Languages and Hindi will not be forced.\n5. Manusmriti is not a book related to Hindu Religion and is not a holy book of Hindus. It is related to Society. Ramayana, Mahabharata, Bhagavad Gita and The Vedas are either from God (Word of God) or related to God. Manusmriti was shown as Word of God and OBC SC STs were discriminated for 2,000 years. At any cost, Manusmriti will not be followed and there will be no discrimination of any kind towards OBC SC STs who are Hindus in The Hindu Rashtra.\n6. The ultimate aim of becoming Hindu Rashtra is peace and no physical attacks/lynchings of Minorities will be tolerated. We are not going to become another Pakistan. Law and Order will not be compromised at any cost.\n7. Any attempts to change the demographics of the country, especially Religion wise is strictly punishable and Hindus will remain 80% of the Indian Population all the time. It’s the only Nation we have and there’s no choice.\n8. The political scenario after becoming Hindu Rashtra will be democracy only. No question of monarchy at all. But, it will be similar to Pakistan in this particular case. The main purpose of Muslim League was to establish a Muslim Nation during Independence. Today, that party is not in power in Pakistan. It simply means that, whoever comes to power in Pakistan will not try to change the fundamental of Pakistan as an Islamic Republic. It is an Islamic Democracy. Similarly, India will become a Vedic Democracy. Probably Aam Aadmi Party will form the government in centre after some years due to it’s development agenda, but India will still remain Official Hindu State. All the above rules will be implemented. No ifs and buts.\n\nDo you think Modi can implement these?\n\nThe only way we can fight such anti India anti Hindu forces are by becoming united more than ever, I government takes any step for the welfare and the making of a Hindu Rashtra. We nedd to support them but this support should not be like abusing anyone on social media but by coming out of our comfort zones and do more than that. \n\nHere's is what we can do:\n\n* Stop making memes and videos ***only*** about Muslims\n* Librandus Commies and should be our enemies, they can destroy the country by their double standards.\n* Targeted memes on those journalists who are anti India and Anti Hindu.\n* Support the Right Wing creators more and more by sharing their work.\n* Make being a Hindu look cool, what i mean by that is listening to Hindi Bhakti songs, wearing traditional Indian outfits, doing pooja, worshipping, reading our ancient literature, should not be considered shameful or old school, first, it will be hard, but don't stop. \n\nThere are 18k people on this sub, only if 3-4k of them do what i have suggested, can bring big changes.\n\nUnlike Instagram and Twitter, Reddit is the platform where we can actually bring change. ALSO,  we have to stop fighting with the librandu jerks on these platforms, this only give them attention, its very hard that you will make them understand. Please consider these suggestions, educate more and more people about these, This is the only way we can save our culture.\n\nAs more and more youngsters are getting attracted to the western culture, and forgetting their own we have to do something to preserve the essence of Sanatan Dharma in them. \n\nThat was my   **आत्मचिंतन**  for today after I failed making a good meme about the pseudo secular people.

<li>Title: 'Jallianwala bagh and Karan Thapar- IMPORTANT STORY!'<br />Body: '  \n \n\n[THAPAR FAMILY](https://preview.redd.it/crhk4u4ecps41.jpg?width=463&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34805a392786c294deac5f67d9e375b619dc3f36)\n\n  \n101  years ago today in 1919, British troops under command of the infamous  Gen. Dyer carried out the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar, Punjab.  Even the arch-imperialist Winston Churchill condemned it as a  “monstrous event, an event which stood in singular and sinister  isolation”.\n\nBut, General Dyer and Michael O’Dwyer (who was subsequently shot by Udham Singh) had admirers in Bharat as well. The prominent name in the list was none other than Dewan Bahadur Kunj Behari Thapar of Lahore.   \n\n\nKaran Thapar belongs to the Thapar clan, which was among the elite of  undivided Punjab and then New Delhi, with connections to the  Nehru-Gandhi family for decades. Karan Thapar’s paternal grandfather was  Diwan Bahadur Kunj Behari Thapar. He belonged to a section of the  Punjabi elite that came into new wealth as commission agents for the  colonial British Indian Army.  \n \n\nKunj Behari Thapar was also one  of four people, including Umar Hayat Khan, Chaudhary Gajjan Singh and  Rai Bahadur Lal Chand, who donated Rs 1.75 lakh to the fund of Punjab  governor Sir Michael O’Dwyer — the man who backed the actions of  Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer during the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.  For his loyalty to the British, Karan Thapar’s grand father, Kunj Behari  Thapar was also awarded the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire  in 1920.  \n \n\nKaran Thapar’s mother is Bimla Bashiram, sister of  Gautam Sahgal, whose wife Nayantara Sahgal was the daughter of  Vijayalakshmi Pandit and niece of Jawaharlal Nehru. Thus, Karan Thapar’s  aunt is Nayantara Sahgal (now infamous for being the first of the award  wapsi gang). Nayantara Sahgal got divorced from Gautam Sahgal in 1967.  But the relations between the Thapar family and the Nehru dynasty still  remains strong today.  \n \n\nDue to the family connection, Chacha  Nehru, against advice by General Thimaya, promoted Karan Thapar’s  father, General Pran Nath Thapar as Chief of Army Staff of the Indian  Army ahead of two generals that were senior to him. Thapar took over in  1961 and served until 19 November 1962. He was the only Indian Army  chief in history to lose a war, against China in 1962, forcing him to  resign in disgrace in November that year. Anyone that was disgraced in  such a fashion would have been relegated to the dustbin of history.  However, due to his Nehru family connection, he was allowed to serve as  the Indian ambassador to Afghanistan from 1964 until 1969.  \n \n\nIn  spite of the brother’s (General Pran Nath Thapar) ignominious exit from  the Indian army, Karan Thapar’s uncle, Daya Ram Thapar, who worked as a  doctor in the Indian military, somehow managed to get himself promoted  to the position of Director-General of the Indian Armed Forces Medical  Services. This was largely thanks to the family’s connection to the  Nehru dynasty.  \n \n\nKaran Thapar’s cousin, [\\#Romila\\_Thapar](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/romila_thapar?epa=HASHTAG)  worked as Professor of Ancient Indian History at the Jawaharlal Nehru  University, New Delhi. Known for her extreme left-leaning views, she has  derided Hinduism at every given opportunity under the premise of  “exposing ancient truths”. She is an advocate of whitewashing the  horrors of Islamic invasions and the Mughal rule in India. She proposed  to dismiss the fact that India had a Golden age has always downplayed  the achievements of the great Indian kingdoms: Maurya, Gupta, Chalukya,  Rashtrakutas, Cholas, Chandelas, Vijayanagar kingdoms, etc as they hurt  her disgust for anything that can give rise to national pride in  Indians. She wants to de-emphasize such portions of history in the name  of opposing Hindutva etc, as if she is some kind of final judgment on  what is counted as history and what is not.  \n \n\nKaran Thapar’s  other cousin, Romesh Thapar (born in Lahore) was a famous loony liberal  writer and commentator and belonged to the Communist party of India. As  is typical of Indian communists, he lived a comfortable life in his  upmarket flat (in the Breach Candy neighborhood in Mumbai), but churned  out pages and pages of communist material for magazines. Always proud of  calling himself a friend of freedom, he vigorously applauded the  discipline and efficiency of family chum Indira Gandhi’s emergency  period of dictatorship and appreciated that many communist agendas, such  as forcible and irreversible birth control operations to limit  population growth, were enforced. He died in 1987.  \n \n\nNot many  people know that he was a close friend of Sanjay Gandhi and never  worried about the excesses of emergency in spite of posing as a friend  of freedom. Karan Thapar’s sister [\\#Shoba](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/shoba?epa=HASHTAG) used to be Sanjay Gandhi’s girlfriend for a short while and it was she who introduced her brother to Sanjay.  \n \n\n Karan Thapar’s wife was Nisha Jean Álvares Meneses who died of cancer.  She was of Goan descent and Karan Thapar converted to Christianity to  marry her.  \n \n\nKaran Thapar was a classmate of Benazir Bhutto at  Oxford University and maintained very cordial relations with her until  her death and still maintains a close relationship with her husband,  Asif Ali Zardari.  \n \n\nIn 2017, Karan Thapar wrote an article named  "The mysterious of Mr. Jadhav" in regard to death sentence given to Mr  Kulbhushan Yadav, an alleged Indian spy who was imprisoned in Pakistan.  This article embarrassed India Internationally. But Mr. Thapar, a  self-serving, life-long admirer of Pakistan has never been one to shy  away from embarrassing India in any way he can so as to build up his  profile as a great Jeremy Paxman-like figure.  \n \n\nKaran Thapar is  just another sickular icon from a typical loony liberal family, whose  members have all succeeded and lived a life of luxury thanks to their  family connections.  \n \n\n[https://theprint.in/lutyens-league/why-is-karan-thapar-complaining-his-dynasty-holds-a-key-to-lutyenss-delhi/87308/](https://theprint.in/lutyens-league/why-is-karan-thapar-complaining-his-dynasty-holds-a-key-to-lutyenss-delhi/87308/?fbclid=IwAR3RwEpXmdgW6GpGzVUJRgW7jhOVIdb6TZHxGqQHe7VSH9vduDeTl2qBhuA)'<br />Author: 'Tumharabaap786'<br />id: 'g0xxbw'<br />Flair :Copypasta</li>

On one occasion, a secret gift of Rs 2 million from the Politburo to the Congress was personally delivered by the KGB head in India Leonid Shebarshin. Another million rupees were given on the same occasion to a newspaper supporting Mrs Gandhi.\n\nIn 1978, the KGB was running over 30 agents in India, 10 of whom were Indian intelligence officers.\n\nIn 1977, KGB files identified 21 non communist politicians (four union ministers) whose election campaigns were subsidised by the KGB.\n\nThe CPI was funded in many ways, including transfer of money through car windows on Delhi roads.\n\nIn 1959, CPI general-secretary Ajoy Ghosh agreed on a plan to found an import-export business for trade with the Soviet bloc. In little more than a decade its annual profits grew to over Rs 3 million.\n\nDuring 1975, a total of 10.6 million roubles was spent on active measures in India designed to strengthen the support for Mrs Gandhi and undermine her political opponents.\n\nV. Krishna Menon, as defence minister, was persuaded to buy Soviet MiGs and not British Lightnings. His election campaigns in 1962 and 1967 were funded by the KGB.\n\nBy 1973, the KGB had 10 Indian newspapers on its payroll plus a press agency. During 1975 the KGB planted 5,510 articles in Indian newspapers.\n\nPromode Dasgupta, the communist stalwart, was identified by the KGB as an Intelligence Bureau informant in the Indian communist movement.'<br />Author: 'zealofsingh'<br />id: 'g0gfc5'<br />Flair :High IQ</li>

Under the Indian Arms Act only licensed police officials, NSGs can use it also under the situation where its use is found reasonable from the perspective of a reasonable officer who at the time was present in the scene. The law also limits the use of any dangerous individual and not on them who passively resist arrest.\n\nUnder the Indian Arms Act, 1956 prohibits the possession of those arms which could be a threat to public peace or public safety which were of much greater magnitude compared to law and order. Hence on the basis of it, the concerned act prohibits a civilian in possessing a stun gun.\n\nThe use of stun guns in India is restricted to police officials only. No person other than a police officer can use it as it can be highly misused, as has been mentioned above.\n\nPossession, sale or use of stun guns in an area where it is a ban or by a person who is not authorized by law to acquire it, can result in heavy fines or imprisonment or both.\n\nUnder law use of stun guns without authorization can lead to assault and one could be punished for this crime.'<br />Author: 'bibyanaman'<br />id: 'g0d8ke'<br />Flair :Research</li>

<li>Title: 'Listen up all Viraats! HISTORY IS TOO IMPORTANT TO BE LEFT ALONE TO HISTORIANS!'<br />Body: '# History is too important to be left alone to Historians!\n\nSo recently I have taken upon myself to create well-cited notes on the history of ***Bharat!*** \n\nso I was going through all the authors for citations and I noticed some strange things\\~\n\n&gt;How does one make a civilization weak and emotionally and intellectually vulnerable?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It is simple you just take away the only pride that one might have and whitewash that to make them believe that they were barbaric LOWER IQ people who could not manage anything on their own! So they put all that morally depressing things in our History Books! \n\n*So I noticed some strange things! All the post-NEHRUVIAN/INDIRA reign our History books started getting hijacked by the* ***Leftist/Assumed Centrist/Marxists.*** *Any Uninformed Nibba if reads those books then all he will think is that OUR HISTORY is pathetic and we were a bunch of savages who were colonised by INVADERS/HUNS/TURKS/GREEKS/MUGHALS/EUROPEANS/BRITISHERS and everything came from them!*\n\nBut the reality is far away from it! One will only feel sad and depressed if one reads those books! \n\nLike I was referring ***UPINDER SINGH*** book on ancient India history and her pejorative of referring to ***GUPTA EMPIRE*** was so visible! She apparently the daughter of Former PM Manmohan Singh! No wonder she might have been involved in "CONGRESS RAJDARBAR" to get politically entrenched! But she is smart! From her writings, she will call out  Marxist Historians and Nationalist School of thought historians that we should look at history without bias! But then she always takes a U\\~Turn. All this is   "HISTORY AL TAQIYA" and she slowly starts injecting ***MARXIST BIAS*** in her books! By reading her books one will hardly feel any pride! SO instead of getting our chest swollen up with pride, it sinks in with low self-esteem!  Unfortunately, she is an EMINENT PROF in Delhi University! So according to her GUPTA EMPIRE IS NOT THE GOLDEN AGE OF INDIA! (Guess what as  marxist she is smart hit the right spot by lowering down the only empire that really in all sense was the TRUE GOLDEN AGE EMPIRE OF CLASSICAL INDIA!) So they attack that! This reminds me of interesting lines\\~\n\n \n\n&gt;*It all boils down to pride. Italian city-states, post-Christian Central Europe - all wanted to claim at least cultural successorship to Rome\'s legacy. Rome was that one girl everyone wants to have but cannot.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Rome, therefore, got remembered in annals as that continuously coveted girl whom everyone wanted to sleep with, some did, some did not and some raped her because she plainly refused but then again - they all got what they wanted.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Now contrast with the Gupta Empire -*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*A people who hate their own past will not tend to remember it like some prize woman coveted overtimes, nor will they try remembering it as a time when they were the best. It boils down psychologically to the fact that while Rome became European invaders\' trophy courtesan, the Gupta period became the whore of history.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Empires are not called empires because they recorded themselves as such in history. Empires are called empires only because its peoples\' descendants choose to recognize the history that way. For instance, the Mughal \'empire\' got destroyed and de-facto abolished many times before its dynastic end had actually arrived and yet - books call it the Mughal empire. Reason - the people who wrote those books would rather remember Turko-Mongol Islamic rule as a continuous prized memory of history rather than whatever your status explains.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Psychology of people remembering history is normally the answer to questions pertaining to the later interpretation of history as well.*\n\n \n\n&gt;*Ok. Riddle me this.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The Roman Empire was, in the course of its existence, dissolved several times, changed hands even more, was split up, parcelled out, apportioned, quartered, gambled away, bought back, and otherwise rendered defunct multiple times- but it\'s still called the \'Roman Empire\'.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*On the other hand:-*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*1- Sri Gupta (240 AD to 280 AD) (Founder of the Empire)*  \n*2- Ghatotkacha Gupta (280 AD to 319 AD)*  \n*3- Chandra Gupta (320 AD to 335 AD)*  \n*4- Samudra Gupta (335 AD to 380 AD)*  \n*5- Rama Gupta (380 AD to 382 AD)*  \n*6- Chandra Gupta 2/ (aka Vikramaditya)  (382 AD to 415 AD)*  \n*7- Kumara Gupta (415 AD to 455 AD)*  \n*8- Skanda Gupta (455 AD to 467 AD)*  \n*9- Puru Gupta (467 AD to 473 AD)*  \n*10- Kumara Gupta (473 AD to 476 AD)*  \n*11- Buddha Gupta (476 AD to 495 AD)*  \n*12- Narasimha Gupta (495 AD to 523 AD)*  \n*13- Kumara Gupta (523 AD to 540 AD)*  \n*14- Vainya Gupta (540 AD to 550 AD)*  \n*15- Bhanu Gupta (550 AD to 557 AD)*  \n*16- Krishna Gupta (557 AD to 559 AD)*  \n*17- Harsha Gupta*  \n*18- Jivita Gupta (few days)*  \n*19- Kumara Gupta (560s AD to 570s AD)*  \n*20- Damodara Gupta (few days)*  \n*21- Mahasena Gupta (570 AD to 580 AD)*  \n*22- Prabhakara Pushyabhuti (son-in-law of Mahasena; 580 to 604 AD)*  \n*23- Rajyavardhana Pushyabhuti (604 AD to 606 AD)*  \n*24- Harshavardhana Pushyabhuti (606 AD to 647 AD)*  \n*25- Unnamed noble (No Conclusive Data present)*  \n*26- (?) Varmana (690s AD to 725 D)*  \n*27- Yashoda Varmana (725 AD to 752 AD)*  \n*28- Unnamed Varmana Heir*  \n*29- Ama(?) Varmana (780s AD to 832 AD)*  \n*30- Dundhaka Varmana (833 AD to 860s AD)*  \n*31- Bhoja Varmana (No Conclusive Data present)*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*So, we have a single Empire extending over most of North India from Punjab to Bengal, with Sindh and Orissa being taken into the Empire every so often, and extending well into the Deccan and North East for centuries at a time- lasting almost uninterrupted for more than 600 years. This Empire demonstrates remarkable continuity in rule- with power passing fairly smoothly from ruler to successor across three dynasties, linked by both blood and election.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*This Empire lasted two period of massive climatic upheaval that led to the destruction of multiple Empires across Europe, South America, Persia, and China- and encompassed the \'Golden Age of India\' in the 4th Century- presiding over a flourishing of Art, Culture, and Literature the World has scarcely seen- with an almost exacting continuity of Ethos and Belief.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*So- why is \'Roman Empire\' a legitimate usage while the \'Gupta-Vardhamana\' Empire isn\'t? The iconography in their coins is consistent, the focus on Emperors being scholar-soldiers is consistent. Their military representation- with the Brahminy Kite standard- is consistent. The administrative organization- barring the steady change from centralized Empire under Sri Gupta to a wholly internally-divided Feudal state under the Varmana- is consistent as well.*\n\nSO my virat friends History creates a narrative!

So I would be surprised if that were his decision. He’d have to tell me that. I spoke to him Sunday morning, called him, and I said, we’d appreciate your allowing our supply to come out.

When Hanuman got into the crack he got to know that it was a way to *nag lok* *(abode of serpents)* where he met Vasuki (king of serpents) and told about his mission. then Vasuki led him towards the mountain of rings.\n\nHanuman did not even waste a second and rushed to the mountain. He picked up the first ring. He was amused to find the original ring in the very first go. He again picked another ring. To his surprise, even that ring was original. He was now confused. He looked at Vasuki in confusion.\n\n“Don’t worry, child. I will explain it to you. but first let me tell you a story” Vasuki calmly spoke.\n\n“There are four yugas and the world keeps on cycling. In the second quarter or treta yuga Rama takes birth, then one day his ring falls into the land of serpents and a monkey comes to take that ring back, and I will tell him the same story. And until then, Rama dies.\n\nThe mountain of rings indicates the number of times this repeated. Each time this cycle repeat, a ring is added to the mountain”\n\nHanuman realizes that he had stuck in the time loop.\n\nRam’s death gives us a sense of cyclic pattern of time depicted in hinduism.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jvzzsx4zinr41.png?width=416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=484a9627c8a95971d8dce9fcad8d1edc36a465de\n\nI found it fascinating and worth sharing.Apart from that here is 1 hr loop of Ramayana 1987 intro loop.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNh52hy2jiQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNh52hy2jiQ)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iwj4ulfoinr41.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f37cf37834b1775f7ec690915b290e5a171b78ee'<br />Author: 'rookiephysicist'<br />id: 'fxdu6t'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>
