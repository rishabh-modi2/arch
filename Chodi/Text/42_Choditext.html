Today I saw a post about a bradar getting threatened by a w@llet bcoz he posted something. And this is not the first occurence. Many of you guys have posted stuff where you got into a f1ght with your libt@rd "friend"(lol) and came here asking for advice on how to btfo him/her/it. I had been wanting to do it about a month back lekin time nahi mil rha tha. Ab to duniya bhar ka time hai mere pass, se let\'s do it.\n\n\n\n# **Be Creative**\n\n\nKehne ka matlab, dont be too straightforward, because by doing so, you are going to get nothing but jailtime and a FIR to your name. *Always use inneundos and euphimism* The Law of the Land doesnt allows you to point out a religion/community explicitly, so be clever. Use sarcastic comments. Concern Trolling samajhte ho na? Wahi karna hai.\n\n\nNow you\'ll say FIR keval H pe hi kyu hoti hai M pe kyu nahi? Bhai FIR karoge to hogi na. Koi karta nahi hai islye vo log aise krte rehte hain. Koi M tumhe chutiyapa krte dikhe to first make him famous on Twitter etc and then report him, Police g mein danda daal ke mor ki tarha nachwayegi.\n\n\n\n# Dont give them what they want\n\n\nDo you know why they get into a fight with you? To get the satisfaction of insulting a "bhakt" and hence continuing their fight against "Fascists" and "Brahmanical Patriarchy". They are not here to change you &amp; get you to join them and become "Liberal" like them. Your liberal "friends" fight you because acc to them, you are an uncultured g@umutra slurper who should be insulted for who you are and you need to be shown your place.\n\n\n\nTherefore, don\'t give them a logical debate/discussion/conversation. *Never give them the satisfaction of winning against you because the moment you reply to their point, you lose the argument, doesnt matters how logical or factually correct you were*.\n\n\n\nStay calm, use your brain and just keep making super sarcastic posts and jokes (while not crossing the line I mentioned in the 1st point) and continue triggering them. Kisi libby ka gusse bhara reply aaye to jawaab nahi dena hai(or just leave them on seen, though I dont suggest doing that). Har msg pe 2 extra posts daal ke uske khoon ko aur jalana hai. Let them know their outburst means jackshit to you.\n\n\n\n\n# If somehow you forgot the first 2 points...\n\n\n\nand got stuck in some hot debate, then use their weapons against them. Whataboutery, shifting goalposts, ad-hominem, being illogical, using false equivalence and using slurs. g@umtra ka jawaab pappumutra slurper ho skta hai. BJP bhakt ka jawaab Sonia Mata Bhakt ho skta hai. Again, follow the first point, be creative.\n\n\n\n\n# Your first priority should be your peace. \n\n\nDon\'t let libby$ destroy your mental peace.  The point of the above 3 points is that your fight with some chutiy@ shouldnt be the thing that kept you upset the whole day. I dont want you to become a whining crying bitch like randia gang or R/librandu gang. Agar nahi hota hai to take a break from such people and social media.\n\n\nI hope these points will help you, they have definitely helped me.\n\n\n\nPeace.'<br />Author: 'outrageous_comments'<br />id: 'fpxpko'<br />Flair :MyBhagwaPillStory</li>

<li>Title: 'The Untold Story of India’s Partition'<br />Body: 'The Indian leaders were arrogant, inconsistent, disinterested in foreign affairs, did not understand the defence and erred politically time and again. Gandhi and Nehru failed to maintain the integrity of the Indian land when the partition was imminently avoidable since neither Muslims nor Hindus wanted it. \n\nIt was by sheer chance that Narendra Singh Sarila came across certain documents which revealed that the partition of India was linked to the great game being played between Britain and the USSR at the time. Without this accidental discovery, the riveting story of India’s partition may have remained buried in the heap of archives somewhere in a London library.\n\nEncouraged by this chance discovery, Sarila expanded his research into the archives of the British Library London, Hartley Library South Hampton, Broadland Archives, United States Foreign Relations documents and Nehru Memorial Museum. The result of this extensive research is a path breaking book- Shadow of The Great Game, The Untold Story of India’s Partition.  \n\nSarila has the right credentials to write this tale. Son of the Maharaja of Sarila, he was the Aide de Camp of Mountbatten in 1948 and served in the Indian Foreign Service from 1948-1985.\n\nHere is the tragic story of India’s partition. It throws a completely new light on the established narrative of the partition and independence of India. The history we have been taught would have us believe that irreconcilable Hindu-Muslim differences forced the reluctant British rulers to partition India and Gandhi’s non-violent resistance got the British to pack their bags. Let us see what the truth really was.\n\n**The Great Game**\n\nAfter the Czars had expanded their empire to within 100 miles from Kashmir, the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) had become a very strategic region for the British Empire. Especially after the 1857 mutiny, the British feared that disgruntled Indian rulers would begin intriguing with the Russians. From a Russian perspective, Asia was to them what undiscovered Americas was to Europe: savages needing to be civilized and controlled.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the Russians became a formidable power in Eurasia. The British feared that if India fell under the Russian influence, it would mean the eclipse of the British Empire. Thus, started a clash between the British and Russians that Rudyard Kipling termed ‘the Great Game.’\n\nIn April 1946, the British Chiefs of Staff Field Marshal Viscount Allenbrooke, Air Marshal Arthur William Tedder and Admiral Rhoderick McGrigor reported to the British cabinet:\n\n‘Recent developments made it appear that Russia is our most probable enemy and to meet its threat, areas on which our war effort will be based and without which it would not be possible for us to fight at all would include India.’\n\nThe man who first grasped the strategic importance of India for the survival of the British empire, was Field Marshal Archibald Wavell, viceroy from 1943-46. He recognized that the British power was fading, and it was a matter of time before Britain would have to withdraw. In his estimate, the Congress party which would rule India would not cooperate with British interests. This breach, he figured, would have to be plugged by making the Muslim League succeed in separating the Northwest from the rest of India.\n\nWavell noted in his diary that Churchill too had visualized the division of India. In fact, Churchill’s idea was a division into three parts, Pakistan, Hindustan and Princesstan. Wavell, however, had envisaged then a division of India as it actually happened later. This plan was known secretly within the British leadership as the Wavell plan of Pakistan.\n\nBy early 1947, the British military and leadership were in overwhelming agreement to retain strategic control over Northwest India. Thereafter they played an intricate game to finesse a blundering Congress Party, use Jinnah to achieve their strategic goal and to fool the Americans who had other ideas.\n\n**How the Congress was Finessed**\n\nThe British strategic objective was to retain control over the Northwest by partitioning India.\n\nThe Muslim objective was a little complex. In the provinces where Muslims were in majority (about 70-75% of Muslim population), there was no feeling that Islam was in danger. The Islam in danger narrative had appeal in Muslim minority provinces only. Majority of Muslims were confident of avoiding Hindu domination. They saw Hindus as both divided and passive, who could be easily bullied. Even fundamentalists like Abdul Al Mawdudi of Jammat-i-Islami did not want partition as they did not approve of Jinnah’s non-Islamic ways. However, there was a small elite led by the likes of Agha Khan, Liaqat Ali Khan and Syed Ahmad Khan who wanted a separate Islamic state. Jinnah himself was initially against a break up, but scorned by Gandhi and Nehru he later wanted Pakistan in any shape or size.\n\nThe objective of the Congress Party, effectively the sole political force representing Hindu interest, should have been to defend the territorial integrity of India at any cost.\n\nThe Americans were of the view that an undivided independent India was crucial to gain their much needed cooperation in the war effort. Second, an independent united India would give a positive signal to the rest of Asia. ‘Asia for Asiatics’ was a significant part of the American vision for a post war world order.\n\n**Jinnah Floats the Two Nation Theory**\n\nGandhi squandered a hard won election victory in 1937, by resigning from the provincial governments as part of his badly timed Quit India movement. This move had exactly the opposite effect than what was intended. The British were determined to not let anything come in the way of the war effort. Instead of feeling pressured they simply reduced their dependence on the Congress and thus its bargaining power. Further the vacuum created, gave a god sent opportunity to Jinnah. A delighted Jinnah termed the Congress move a ‘Himalayan blunder.’ The distinguished civil servant V P Menon noted that ‘by resigning the Congress Party showed lamentable political wisdom.’\n\nOn 24th March 1941 Jinnah proclaimed that Muslims were a separate nation. This suited the British plan. By strengthening Jinnah, the British were making Gandhi increasingly irrelevant. His loud proclamations of non-violence were not sitting well with the British in the midst of a tough war. In 1940 Gandhi told Viceroy Linlithgow:\n\n‘Let them (the Germans) take possession of your beautiful island, if Hitler chooses to occupy your homes vacate them, if he does not give you free passage out, allow yourself, every man, woman and child to be slaughtered.’\n\nJinnah’s scheme for Pakistan included NWFP, Baluchistan, all of Punjab, Delhi, Sind, all of Bengal, Assam, Hyderabad and all other Muslim princely states and a corridor connecting East and West Pakistan\n\nThe Congress party, being neither farsighted nor adamant on a united India, did not counter Jinnah’s preposterous scheme. Nehru reasoned that taking the idea seriously would encourage separatist forces. It wasn’t until 1944 that Gandhi said that Hindus and Muslims were not separate. He argued that Muslims were descendants from converts and there was no precedence in history of a change of religion changing nationality. The result was that the two-nation idea was not nipped in the bud and Jinnah was politically strengthened.\n\nThe irony of Jinnah was that for the first sixty years of his life he fought for a united India. Jinnah’s difficulties began after Gandhi returned from South Africa in 1915. In the 1920 Nagpur Congress session, Jinnah and Gandhi clashed. Jinnah was openly booed in the presence of his young wife Ruttie, with Gandhi refusing to intervene. In 1928 Jinnah persuaded the Muslim league to give up the separate electorate in return for 33% Muslim seats in the central legislature, separation of Sind from Bombay Presidency and recognition of NWFP and Baluchistan as separate entities. This, he reasoned, would enable the Muslims to dominate five provinces and help reduce communal differences. The Congress rejected this proposal. Angling for his son Jawaharlal to be elected Congress President, Motilal Nehru did not want to risk upsetting Congress leaders by supporting Jinnah. In the midst of this major crisis in his career, Ruttie decided to leave him. Badly scarred, Jinnah left for England in 1933 to concentrate on his legal practice.\n\nIt was Liaqat Ali Khan who persuaded Jinnah to return and contest the 1937 elections. Jinnah was unsure of countering Gandhi’s ability to mobilize the masses. Khan assured him that he will arrange the means to win them over. He did not, however, reveal that whipping up fanaticism was the weapon he had in mind. Jinnah returned and set upon the task of rebuilding the Muslim League. He was now consumed by a burning desire to vanquish the Congress and get even with the arrogant Nehru. For the first time he began to see Mohammad Iqbal’s idea of a separate Muslim state as a way to achieve personal glory.\n\nIn the end, Jinnah emerged a tragic Shakespearian character. Exploited by hard liners like Liaqat Ali Khan, used by the British and consumed by his own ambition, he died a bitter man. Colonel Ilahi Bakhsh, his doctor heard Jinnah say, ‘I have made Pakistan, but I am convinced that I have committed the greatest blunder of my life.’ \n\n**The Cripps Mission** \n\nIn 1941 the Allied forces were suffering reverses. The attack on Pearl Harbour had drawn America into the war. Roosevelt was putting pressure on Churchill to grant self-governance to an undivided India. He felt that this was best course to gain India’s cooperation in the war effort. Viceroy Linlithgow, however, was of the firm opinion that no concession should be granted to the Indians at this crucial juncture in the war. He was certain that any agitation caused by Gandhi could be brought down.\n\nTo deflect the American pressure, Churchill decided to send Sir Stafford Cripps to India. The mission was a smokescreen designed for deliberate failure. The covert plan was to placate Roosevelt and put the Congress in a dilemma. The Cripps Plan was:\n\nImmediately after the war India would be independent either within or outside the Commonwealth.\n\nIn the interim, a politically representative Executive Council would be formed under the Viceroy.\n\nThe princely states would have the right to stay out of the proposed Indian Union if they so choose.\n\nThe proposal had to be accepted or rejected as a whole.\n\nFor the first time, the idea of princely states not being part of the union was mooted. The real motive behind the mission can be gauged from what Foreign Secretary Amery said to Linlithgow:\n\n‘As for the Congress, their adverse reaction may be all the greater when they discover that the nest contains Pakistan Cookoo’s egg.’\n\nOn 25 March 1942 Cripps noted:\n\n‘I think Jinnah was rather surprised in the distance that it went to meet the Pakistan case.’\n\nAs expected the Congress Party rejected the proposal on 11 April 1942. But surprisingly the resolution rejecting the proposal had this sentence:\n\n‘The Congress working committee cannot think in terms of compelling the people of any territorial unit to remain in the Indian Union against their declared and established will.’ \n\nThis was inexplicable since the Congress had consistently considered India indivisible. It raised doubts about its commitment to India’s unity.\n\nThe British achieved their objectives of placating the Americans, giving Jinnah hope and putting the Congress into a dilemma. The Congress on its part, erred badly in diluting its position on the integrity of India and by not joining the Executive council. It is arguable that by joining they could have exerted power and signaled their cooperation in the war effort. This would have been useful to garner the support of the British public and the Americans. The risk of the princely states seceding was low and the majority of Muslims did not want partition.\n\n**After the Cripps’s Mission**\n\nAfter the Cripps mission, Gandhi became belligerent. This can be discerned by the draft of the Allahabad Congress resolution, leaked to British intelligence by the Communist party. The Communists had switched loyalty from the Nationalists to the British after Russia was attacked by the Germans. This is a sad commentary on the Communist Party too, but that is another story.\n\nThe draft asked for the British to clear out and to use force if necessary. Nehru opposed the draft saying that the British would not allow this and would render India into an active war zone. The draft was first accepted and then rejected the same day after Nehru’s threat. \n\nIn the draft we have Nehru saying:\n\n‘It is Gandhiji’s feeling that Japan and Germany will win. This feeling unconsciously governs his thinking.’\n\nBritish intelligence quoted this statement to Roosevelt to denounce Gandhi as ‘a fifth columnist.’\n\nIn 1945 Wavell held another conference to discuss the formation of a politically representative Executive Council. Jinnah was tutored by a member of the Viceroy’s council to sabotage the meeting in return for the promise of Pakistan. Hence as early as June 1945 Jinnah was taken into confidence on the creation of Pakistan. This event made Jinnah into a strong leader of the Muslims.\n\n**Clement Atlee Becomes Prime Minister** \n\nIn 1945 Churchill lost the election and Clement Atlee took over as Prime Minister. Unlike Churchill, Atlee liked to operate from behind the scene. His objective was to partition India but make it appear that the Congress wanted it. His second objective was to persuade Jinnah to accept a truncated Pakistan. As we have seen there existed a Wavell plan of Pakistan which was pretty much how Pakistan was finally created.\n\nHe instructed Cripps to reach out to Nehru and ask for his suggestion. On 27 January 1946, Nehru wrote a 3500-word letter.\n\nThe gist of the letter was:\n\nThe British should grant independence to India and allow it to frame its own constitution.\n\nThe British should not divide India. Only after a plebiscite can territories that wished to secede could do so.\n\nPakistan was a non-starter because the vote for Muslim League did not mean a vote for separation.\n\nAlthough there was a feeling that the British would not leave without force, he was in favor of a negotiated settlement.\n\nAgain, Nehru failed to stand firm on India’s territorial integrity be mentioning plebiscite. Not surprisingly, Atlee decoded this as the Congress being ‘flexible’ on separation. The assurance of eschewing force and negotiating a settlement was an added relief. Atlee now instructed Cripps to work towards Wavell’s Pakistan. The Cabinet Mission was the next major event.\n\n**The Cabinet Mission 1946** \n\nIn March 1946 the Cabinet Mission arrived in India to devise a mechanism for the smooth transfer of power. It comprised Sir Pethick-Lawrence, Secretary of State for India, Sir Stafford Cripps, President, Board of Trade and A V Alexander, First Lord of the Admiralty.\n\nThe key features of the Cabinet Mission plan were:\n\nAcceptance of the Muslim fear of Hindu domination.\n\nGrouping of provinces into A, B, C. Sizable Muslim populated areas into B and C (North West &amp; East of India), to be controlled by the Muslim League. However, a separate state of Pakistan was ruled out.\n\nAfter ten years Groups B &amp; C could secede if they so wished.\n\nThe Union of India will have three subjects under its control-Foreign Affairs, Defence and Communication. The provincial governments will control other subjects.\n\nNo clause could be modified without the majority of representatives of the two political formations and the majority of representatives of the constituent assemblies agreeing.\n\nAtlee’s plan was to somehow induct Nehru and Patel into the government to prevent the Congress from revolting. Second to browbeat Jinnah into accepting a truncated Pakistan.\n\nJinnah was suspicious about a plan that rejected the idea of an independent Pakistan straight away. The Labour politician and journalist Woodrow Wyatt was tasked with convincing Jinnah that this plan was the first step on the road to Pakistan. He writes:\n\n‘When I finished his (Jinnah’s) face lit up. He hit the table with his hand. That’s it, I said, you’ve got it.’\n\nJinnah accepted the plan.\n\nAs had been the pattern, the Congress’s response was inconsistent and confused. Gandhi did realize that the proposal was a trap. No provision for an independent Pakistan was to bait the Congress, while the acceptance of a principle of Pakistan was to bait the Muslim League. So, while the Congress was willing to accept the idea of an Interim Government, the possibility of B and C breaking away was objectionable.\n\nThe Nationalists urged the Congress to renew the Quit India movement, this time violently. The 1946 INA revolt had unnerved the British. They came to believe that the loyalty of the Indian army could no longer be relied upon. Field Marshal Claude Auchinleck had noted ‘wholesale defection and disintegration of the Indian army was possible.’ A full-blown revolt would have perhaps stopped Jinnah’s belligerent Direct action as well.\n\nThe Congress leadership felt that a revolt was too risky. They figured that by accepting being in the Interim Government they might somehow be able to ward off the partition. They banked on the NWFP, under Congress friendly rule, choosing to stay within India, thus making Pakistan non-contiguous enclaves within Indian borders and therefore temporary.\n\nOn 6 July 1946, Nehru announced that the Congress was committed to nothing more than simply entering the Interim government. This prompted Jinnah to reject the Cabinet Mission plan in toto. Jinnah announced Direct action which led to the horrific Calcutta killings. The Congress had failed to see that their restraint would embolden the Muslim League to adopt violent ways.\n\nOn 2 September 1946 Atlee succeeded in getting Nehru to join the Interim government. Jinnah saw this as an ominous move. But the British were pleased as the plan was moving in the right direction. N P A Smith, Director of Intelligence Bureau looked ahead:\n\n‘As I have said for some months, Pakistan is likely to come from Congresstan.’ (the acceptance of office by the Congress)\n\nNow Wavell began to work on Gandhi and Nehru to accept the Cabinet Mission’s grouping formula. He argued that without this acceptance the Muslim League would not join the government and more violence will result. Both Gandhi and Nehru rejected the proposal. The Nationalists felt that the only way to keep India united was to be in the government and exclude Jinnah from it. This would help to break away the Muslim leaders opposed to Jinnah.\n\nWavell, however, was relentless. He met Nehru on 11,16, 26 and 27 September 1946 to persuade him to take Jinnah on board but Nehru stood firm. Inexplicably on October 2, 1946, Nehru caved in. He told Sudhir Ghosh, a Gandhi confidant ‘Well this man (Wavell) had been pestering me to start talks with Jinnah. A few days ago, I told him in sheer exasperation that if he was so keen to talk to Jinnah he could do so.’\n\nWhat transpired next was the biggest blow to the united India project. Wavell invited the Muslim League to join the Viceroy’s executive council without either insisting that they join the Constituent assembly or even call off direct action campaign. This was a great victory for Jinnah. He could now sabotage Nehru from within. The move did not stop violence either as the Noakhali riots followed soon after.\n\nThe last piece of the action required the secession of NWFP. \n\n**How NWFP was Plucked Out** \n\nThe Congress figured that with NWFP in their hands, the division of Pakistan would at best be enclaves within the borders of India, which could not last for long. This could have worked if they were firm against any division. However, the Congress resolution to bifurcate Punjab and Bengal into Muslim and Hindu parts went against the united India principle. By accepting the division of Punjab and Bengal, the Congress was in principle accepting Jinnah’s two nation theory.\n\nThe extent of this blunder can be judged by what the US charge d’affairs in India George Merrell wrote to his government on 22 April 1947:\n\n‘The Congress effort to make Pakistan unattractive by demanding the partition of Punjab and Bengal-Congress leaders have in effect abandoned the tenets which they supported for so many years in their campaign for united India. They have also agreed by implication to Jinnah’s allegation that Hindus and Muslims cannot live together.’\n\nVery significantly this weakened the American position on an undivided India.\n\nOn taking over as viceroy in March 1947, Lord Mountbatten asked Nehru what he would do in his (Mountbatten’s) place. Nehru again weakened the position of a united India when he said, ‘it would not be right to impose any form of constitutional conditions on any community which was in a majority in a specific area.’ Mountbatten obviously took this to mean that Nehru was agreeable to the provinces, including NWFP, being given a free choice. He floated the idea of a referendum to which Nehru agreed, sure as he was of a Congress victory. He had erred again by failing to factor in the effect of Gandhian pacifism on the Frontier Gandhi, Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan. Fearing bloodletting, Gaffar Khan decided that his party will not vote in the referendum. The referendum voted for Pakistan by 50.49%. If Gaffar Khan’s party had not boycotted the referendum, albeit with bloodletting, NWFP would have been with India.\n\nThe assessment of N P A Smith that Pakistan would come from Congresstan came true.\n\n**How the Americans Were Played** \n\nThe Americans were disposed towards a free undivided India for three reasons: \n\nRoosevelt figured that fulfilling the Indian aspiration for freedom would encourage them to support the war effort wholeheartedly.\n\nThe freedom and unity of India was required to send a positive signal to the rest of Asia on the post war American plan of ‘Asia for Asiatics.’\n\nPartition would give a fillip to the dreaded Communist forces.\n\nChurchill played on the American’s lack of knowledge of the complexity of India. In fact, he willfully misled Roosevelt by saying that 75% of recruits were Muslim (only 33% were). He used this to justify acceding to the Muslim aspiration of a separate country.\n\nThe Americans were increasingly getting anxious of Gandhi’s belligerence and call for civil disobedience in 1942. Nehru who understood foreign relations better than anybody else at the time got Gandhi to write to Roosevelt appealing to his ideal of freedom and democracy. Nehru also got Gandhi to mention that a free India would be open to allied bases.\n\nRoosevelt did write to Churchill, but the British response was on expected lines. Foreign Secretary Amery pointed out the irreconcilable religious differences in India. He emphatically reassured the Americans that any agitation will be quelled swiftly thus not impacting the war effort. Churchill chipped in with a scathing criticism of the Congress saying that their offer of supporting the war effort in lieu of the British quitting was an eyewash and that they would have no hesitation in joining hands with the Japanese. Realizing that this would be a tightrope walk, Roosevelt stopped pushing the issue.\n\nWhatever hope there was of an American intervention was dashed when Congress agreed to the Cabinet Mission plan and division of Punjab and Bengal.\n\n**Looking at the Events in Hindsight** \n\nBritain’s Pakistan strategy was a spectacular success. Pakistan joined the Baghdad Pact and later the CENTO led by the USA. This formed a defence barrier against Soviet ambition in the Middle East. In 1958, Pakistan provided air bases to the CIA in Peshawar from where they flew U2 spy planes. In 1970 Pakistan helped the US establish a relationship with China to pressurize the Soviets from the East. In 1980 Pakistan played a major role in helping the USA defeat the Soviet Union to end the cold war.\n\nJinnah got his Pakistan but died a bitter man. The West used Pakistan and when no longer needed, fed it to the wolves. The question needs to be asked if its people benefited from the partition. In 1945 Field Marshal Alanbrooke was prescient when he told the British cabinet:\n\n‘With no industrial development Pakistan would not be able to defend itself. Pakistan will end up identifying with Muslim lands and end up in wars not in its interest.’\n\nThe entire saga of colonial rule shows up the British empire as downright unconscionable. The damage they have inflicted on India is so mind boggling that even today we shy away from honestly analyzing it. They wreaked cultural destruction, divided the people, impoverished a prosperous country to build their own wealth, inflicted famines that killed so many millions that history must judge Churchill a bigger villain than Hitler. They have their hands soaked in the blood of over half a million people by engineering an avoidable partition. The history of the British Raj from an Indian gaze needs to be written. Even a clinical assessment will be severely damning.\n\nHowever, the saddest part of this story, is the sheer ineptitude of the Indian leadership. The narrative we have been fed about them is false. The Indian leaders were arrogant, inconsistent, disinterested in foreign affairs, did not understand defence and erred politically time and again. In a predatory world they were easily exploited. Gandhi and Nehru need to be judged unapologetically for what they achieved or did not achieve. They failed to maintain the integrity of the Indian land when partition was imminently avoidable since neither the Muslims nor the Hindus wanted it.\n\nHere is a list of mistakes:\n\nRejecting a capable and then secular Jinnah from the Congress party in the 1920s made an enemy out of him. If he had been retained in the Congress fold, the story of India would have been quite different. Gandhi should have intervened between Nehru and Jinnah keeping long term national interest above personal likes and dislikes. Nehru should have negotiated harder with Jinnah to keep India united.\n\nGiving up the gains of a massive electoral victory in 1937 over an ill-timed Quit India movement, made the British distrustful and opened the door for Jinnah. The Quit India movement was timed in the midst of a tough war. The British were in no mood to give any concessions. As it happened the movement was quelled ruthlessly, thousands were killed and over sixty thousand imprisoned. Even aerial machine gun firing was resorted to. After Subhash Bose had dealt a big blow with the INA trials, the time was right for a second Quit India movement, but Gandhi demurred.\n\nComplete inconsistency in their resolve to keep India united. Not strongly opposing Jinnah’s preposterous two nation theory in 1941; indicating time and again that people could choose to stay in united India or not; agreeing to the trap of the Cabinet Mission plan; losing NWFP, not exploiting Roosevelt’s support for a united India; and not meeting fire with fire on Jinnah’s violent ways.\n\nGandhi’s bigger goal appears to have been the ideal of non-violence and not the unity of India. He has to take the rap for this. Nobody can deny Gandhi the credit of galvanizing a broken people into a spiritually inspired force. He caught the imagination of the world and whipped up global sympathy for his cause, but his failure to use this mammoth advantage to achieve his goals has to be questioned. He failed to frame and pursue non-negotiable goals. Despite proclamations of the ideal like non-violence, the masses still ended up losing their lives for nothing.\n\nFinally, to Nehru, an intelligent man who too could not frame clear goals and work unwaveringly for them, like Jinnah did. If he was clear he would have cooperated with the British and Americans to contain the Soviets, in return for a united India. But his distrust for American capitalism came in the way. He was more interested in following a lofty foreign policy of fighting colonialism and apartheid than dousing existential fires at home. This greatly embarrassed Britain. He was excited by the prospect of mediating peace between the East and the West. By appealing to the deep felt urges of mankind for freedom, equality, and peace, he believed that he could leave his imprimatur on the world stage. He should have learned that behind lofty declarations countries followed predatory self-interest. These ideas would not persuade the British to abandon the Pakistan scheme.\n\nAll in all, this is a tragic tale of a great civilization squeezed out of its essence. It is not surprising that even the journey to reclaim what is its due is so uphill. A tale of a people who have a fantastic blueprint within their own culture but are unable to access it because of a million broken narratives.\n\nA Doha from Kabir is very apt to describe this conundrum:\n\n*Pani beech meen piyasi*\n\n*mohe sun sun aave haansi*\n\nA thirsty fish looks for water everywhere, all the time surrounded by it.

Modi was himself present in the Government War Room during the national chanting along with the Cabinet Ministers.

Wanted to get what I'm feeling right now off my chest. \n\nProbably maybe because of the bombardment of information &amp; over stimulation coming from all around. this fucking thing is so huge, it's hard to believe. Everyday there are new cases, everyday deaths being reported. I can't imagine how the mental &amp; emotional health of doctors &amp; healthcare staff is who have to make a decision on whom to save &amp; whom to let die everyday.\n\nI think of the people who are homeless, people who live off daily wages who are no longer working now, people who were doing small odd jobs to earn some money, the people who wud be selling pens, toys, tissue papers at signals, the ones who sold goods in local trains to feed themselves but now suddenly can't do that. Everything is heartbreaking. It's such a sense of doom. As a generation, we never expected something like this to happen. We would joke about doomsday scenarios but fuckk our world has changed in less than 4months. We don't know how our world is going to look like once all this is over.\n\nWe can do our bit though. We've given our maid an advance on her salary &amp; leave till all this ends so that she can stay home with her kids. My mom &amp; I provide food for our building security guard who lives away from his family whenever he needs. Gives me a little solace.\r\n\nI have decided to do the Hanuman Chalisa paath every night for the next 21 days to pray that the Universe gives all of us courage &amp; patience to get through this especially for the ones who are fighting for us on the frontline. I'm praying for everyone in our government &amp; especially for the health &amp; well being of our Prime Minister who is playing such an important role right now. The odds are against everyone being alright but I pray this will be over soon. Not only in India but the whole world. I feel like I want to break down &amp; cry my eyes out.

It was a test not just for this particular strain, but generally the coronavirus. \\[Editor’s note: There are many kinds of coronavirus. The current outbreak is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus\\]. It would lead to many unnecessary positives and unnecessarily people being quarantined. The government did not really have an option.\n\nThe government had to make a choice: test only suspects. When you say suspects, the probability of having the disease is high. So, if such a person tests positive, you can choose what to do with that gut.\n\nBut now we have excellent test kits with sensitivity and specificity almost next to 100%. I am sure now the ICMR \\[Indian Council of Medical Research\\] and the government of India will start testing, testing, testing.'<br />Author: 'bawla_londa'<br />id: 'fo20yy'<br />Flair :Research</li>

सीजन का टेम है, लाखों की बिक्री है, अपनी दुकान बंद कैसें कर लें)\n\nपर चूंकि तालाबंदी है।\nतो पुलिस वाले सेठजी की तरफ डंडा लेकर दौड़े।\nडंडा देख सेठजी शटर लटकाकर भागे।\n\nअब चूंकि मार्किट बन्द है।\nतो 450 ग्राहक भी नहीं आये।\nसभी बच गए।\nराजू भी बच गया।\nबस सेठजी के परिवार को कोरोना हुआ।\n6वें 7वें दिन तक कोरोना के लक्षण आ जाते हैं। विदेश से लौटे लोगों में लक्षण आ जाये तो उनको अस्पताल पहुंचा दिया जायेगा। और नहीं आये तो इसका मतलब वो कोरोना नेगेटिव हैं।'<br />Author: 'Shakuni_'<br />id: 'fnim2b'<br />Flair :WhatsApp Forward</li>

<li>Title: 'Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose is still a war criminal.'<br />Body: ' \n\nNetaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s name is still a part of the Indian war criminals’ list in the United Nations, and no Indian government has made any efforts to get his name removed, says the freedom fighter’s great-grand-niece, Rajyashree Chaudhuri. The British had included Netaji’s name in the United Nations’ list of Indian war criminals because he fought against them during World War II. Even Jawaharlal Nehru described Netaji as a “war criminal” while corresponding with British Prime Minister Clement Attlee after Bose’s disappearance in 1945. According to Chaudhuri, India did not ask the UN to remove the name when the world body ratified the war criminals’ list in 1971.\n\nWhen a Bangalore-based RTI activist, Choodamani Nagendra, asked the Central government this year about the efforts if any, it was making to remove Netaji’s name from the list of war criminals, she was told that no information on the matter was available. Choodamani had also asked for a number of UN records relating to Netaji’s war criminal status that was with the government. Has the Indian representative in the UN taken up the matter of removing Netaji’s name from the list, she had asked.\n\nRajyashree Chaudhuri has now written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to get the “war criminal” tag removed, before starting the process of declassification of files on 23 January 2016. She has received an acknowledgment from the Prime Minister’s Office on the matter.\n\n“Does it make any sense to open the secret files of a ‘bad person’ who is a ‘war criminal’?” asked Chaudhury, who has started a signature campaign under the banner of Jatiya Jagran Mancha, asking the Centre to ensure the immediate removal of the tag by the United Nations.\n\nChaudhuri and a group of experts, professionals and social thinkers organized a signature campaign and protest meeting at Hazra More in Kolkata on 14 November on the matter.\n\n \n\n“Though he was declared a ‘war criminal’ by the British, no effort was made by successive Indian governments to get this tag removed. This was done deliberately to ensure that Netaji did not appear before his countrymen. The government should honour him by getting this tag removed before files related to him are declassified,” said Chaudhury.\n\nThe war criminal tag was given by the British for Netaji’s association with the Germans and the Japanese during World War II. Significantly, Jawaharlal Nehru too used this tag to describe Netaji on 26 December 1945, after Netaji disappeared after the so-called plane crash on 18 August 1945.\n\nIn a deposition before the 1970 Khosla Commission to probe Netaji’s disappearance, Shyamalal Jain, the confidential steno of INA Defence Committee, had said, “Jawaharlal Nehru gave four papers from his writing pad to make four copies of a letter, which he would dictate to me on the typewriter, which I also complied… The contents of the letter, as far as I could remember, were as follows.\n\n*“Clement Attlee*\n\n*“Prime Minister of Britain*\n\n*“10, Downing Street, London*\n\n*“Dated: 26 December 1945*\n\n*“Dear Mr. Attlee,*\n\n *“I understand from the most reliable source that Stalin has allowed Subhas Chandra Bose, your war criminal, to enter Russian territory. This is clear treachery and betrayal of faith by the Russians as Russia has been an ally of the British-Americans, which she should not have done. Please take care of it and do what you consider proper and fit.*\n\n*“Yours Sincerely*\n\n*“Jawaharlal Nehru”*\n\nChaudhury feels that the situation has now changed and it should not be difficult for the Indian government to get the tag deleted by the UN. “The government should write to the UN Secretary-General in this regard. Nations have progressed since our Independence and they should not hesitate in supporting our endeavour,” Chaudhury added.\n\nHistorians and experts have reacted sharply to the matter. Defence and security expert Wing Commander (Retired) Praful Bakshi demanded that an independent committee be set up to find out the “status” of Netaji in the eyes of the government. “The committee should find out whether Netaji continued to remain a ‘war criminal’ even after Independence. If yes, it should be found out what crimes he committed for which he was given the tag of ‘war criminal’. The committee should find out his present status,” he said.\n\n \n\nHowever, Prof Kapil Kumar, a noted historian, said that there was no need to remove the tag as it was not given by “our government”. “People like Bhagat Singh or Sukhdeo were ‘terrorists’ for the British government but ‘freedom fighters’ for us. Similarly, Netaji might have been a ‘war criminal’ for the British government, he was a ‘national hero’ for us,” said Kumar, who is also the director of the Indira Gandhi Centre for Freedom Struggle Studies and chairperson of Faculty of History, School of Social Sciences, IGNOU.\n\nFor details see\n\n[70 years on, Netaji still a war criminal in UN records - The Sunday Guardian Live](https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/2313-70-years-netaji-still-war-criminal-un-records)'<br />Author: 'RealMan193'<br />id: 'fmjxmc'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>

She laughed at my jokes and I laughed listening to her fun stories. \n\nAlways knew there was something special between me and her but was afraid to confess. \n\nTime passed quickly and soon it was one of the last days of school\n\nI knew time was running out. I really wanted to confess. \n\nOne day, we were both walking together in a secluded area after our classes. This was the perfect opportunity for a confession\n\nNot many people around.\n\nWith my stomach constantly churning, I quickly told her in an awkward fashion, "I love you" \n\nShe looked at me but no words came out of her mouth. I thought I messed up. \n\nThen she said "I don\'t think this is the right time for anything between us. This is the time to study. I won\'t be comfortable"\n\nI was crushed. \n\nThe walk back was quite awkward. None of us spoke to each other. \n\nWhen we reached her house, she suddenly grabbed my hand \n\nShe told me to follow her\n\nI was confused. What was happening? \n\nShe took me to a quite spot behind her house.\n\nI was about to say some thing but she turned around and placed her soft finger on my lips. Gave me a small smile which melted my heart. \n\nOur foreheads touched each other. And our tongues twirled around each other. Her soft lips felt like sweet jelly. The smell of her lipstick invading my nose.\n\nHer hand wrapped around my neck, and my hand around hips. It felt great, it felt as if the whole world was at my command. \n\nShe was the wheels to my car, she was the charger to my phone, she was the pillar to my flyover. \n\nMy hands kept wandering all over her. She didn\'t complain. \n\nBut it all came to an end. Like all good things do. \n\nI was asked, what happened that brought an end? \n\nAfter years of this question being repeated over and over again by my friends, I finally relented and answered. \n\nWhile the intensity was rising up, I just realised. A deep realisation that changed the dynamics between us. Her boner was rising up. ☹️'<br />Author: 'DeadBodiesinMyArse'<br />id: 'flw04s'<br />Flair :OC है बे!</li>

<li>Title: 'My Sort of Bhagwa pill story.'<br />Body: "Someone asked about my personal story on the first smooch story thread and I posted it there. Thought it would work as a Bhagwa pill story more.\n\nSo here it goes.\n\nI somehow fell in love with a Rich Elite State of The Art muslim girl and she loved me too.\n\nI was everything for her. Her family liked me alot. She kept telling things about me and how I know Allah and her religion better than everyone else. I used to take care of her all day when we were together. \n\nWe somehow managed to keep a relationship going for a few months. My life was like a dream back then. Our pain and love could only be expressed through our hugs and kisses.\n\nShe never wanted to be together because she comes from a Rich Elite Conservative Muslim family. This girl was really rich believe me. I was too small infront of her but she never made me felt like an poor guy.\n\nThen college finished, I kept clinging while she started distancing herself. Then we regularly got into fights and every good thing, every fucking thing went to shambles. We were so perfect but because of her stupid religion and her backward family we became like this. \n\nI never thought she would treat me like a begger but she did. Because her religion had taught her to be like this. It was easy for her to justify the hate for me under the burqa of her rwligion.\n\nI accept that I was the one who started the fights but she took everything on another level. She made me delete our convos, our photos and evertything. In the end, she thought that I will destroy her life, I want her family to hate her and stuff and it really broke me into pieces. I never could think stuff like that. \n\nI still love her because I'm not an idiot. I agree things go out of hands when people are possessive and trying to save their own skin. But she couldn't understand this simple thing.\n\nThe whole point of me loving her so much was I found some sort of purity and joy that I lack in myself. I cannot imagine her being with a crazy rich guy who will just use her as a toy. I cannot imagine her marrying one of her cousins. She used to get sick sometimes and it used to make my heart sunk. I never want her to be a burden on someone. But guess I'm a kaafir at the end of the day.\n\nMy family was ready, my friends were ready but she was too much into her religion. \n\nI hope she will get married to a crazy rich guy who isn't her  cousin and will love her very much. One thing is for sure, she will never find a better Musalman than me even though I an not a Muslim and she knows it very well.\n\nI always loved Islam for sufism and puritan aspects of the religion but once we fell apart I started getting angrier day by day and I started hating Islam and every Musalman. As a leftist and Anarchist I felt very guilty so I tried making new Muslim friends and going into Mosques to understand the religion better. All that I could found was hate for others. Some people were actually good but till that point I had made my mind that Islam inherently is bad. And everyone is being brainwashed."<br />Author: 'pranam_bhrata'<br />id: 'flv2yx'<br />Flair :MyBhagwaPillStory</li>

<li>Title: 'Why I think liberandus are supporting Modi now'<br />Body: "Honestly, his speech was incredible. Like I saod in a comment before .My mother didn't understand Hindi  But he literally made her understand every word in his speech. She now respects hin even more than before. This is one thing that really makes a leader shine-his ability to communicate with people. Liberandus have been caught offguard by this. There is no hinf of CAA/NRC now, no mentions of muslims or anything anywhere in the speech  And they also know the people have understood what he said. If they protest now, the whole public will understand that they are hypocrites. So they are supporting him. Also the threat of covid-19 is perhaps too huge and people are realizing that if they carry on their bs then they might be the ones to suffer because of it. I can see Javed Akhtar supporting Modi. He has to give his daily dose of Taquia. He had done this before many times too. But Shehla Rashid suporting Modi is really awkward.

<li>Title: 'Preparations for Corona.'<br />Body: 'Hi everyone, we all know what precautions we have to take in the ongoing crisis of corona, but let me tell you a few things you need to prepare for a safe Corona self-isolation/lockdown.\n\nKeep in mind this is just my opinion/steps I am taking after I have read a few things about this virus, and I am not related to the medical field in any way. Most likely follow Doctors and other educated people of this field and Gov. They know far better than me at every scale. Mostly these steps don\'t have many risks except the last one and that is why I am sharing.\n\nKeep in mind while fighting the pandemic don\'t be selfish, and think about others and they may have a need for things more than you, so be kind and helpful. \n\nYoung people can fight this better but don\'t be reckless as it can affect anyone. Youth will also be able to help others in this tough period.\n\n**These preparations DO NOT help you avoid or cure Coronavirus, these are just a few steps that may help you (if needed) to get through until Gov. and more educated help can be reached.**\n\n\\-First and foremost, as everyone knows, if you have symptoms start a self-isolation and **inform the Gov. as soon as possible.** Only they (Govt., Doctors and educated people) can help you.\n\n\\-Keep any medicine that you or your loved one have been taking or prescribed for other conditions unrelated to the virus, keep a backup handy, but do not overbuy as others who may need it may meet the shortage, so be considerate.\n\n\\-Keep Paracetamol at home, as Corona causes fever it can help you keep the fever in check. Do not overbuy, please.\n\n\\-Keep nasal drops/Spray at least two (because you can\'t use the same one being used by the person who may have the virus), as Corona effects breathing of the patient, the drops may help in breathing a bit easier. Don\'t overbuy.\n\n\\-Vitamin-D may aid in fighting the virus (Not proven), so if you think/know someone may have Vitamin-D deficiency, please think of buying a Vitamin D3 supplement, it may not help much but every bit helps. Keep in mind to take them with food as they will be absorbed better that way. Again don\'t overbuy.\n\n\\-CAUTION- This is for last resort only- hydroxychloroquine tablets are a Malaria vaccination, but S.Korea have been using them against the Corona, they have shown to be okay at combating the virus (it is just premature, and not a proven study yet), so you may keep it as last resort option. KEEP IN MIND this is just to be taken as last resort in case the patient can\'t somehow get Gov. aid, FIRST STEP should be to inform the Govt. as they will provide the appropriate medicine. The tablet is fairly secure and common but may have some side effects so please read before taking. BEST way if you have to take it, is to ask a nearby doctor for guidance and usage restrictions. **DO NOT take if you have Skin or liver problems, like psoriasis, porphyria or if you have a history of alcohol misuse/refrain.**\n\nIf you have other things please add in the comments below. \n\nHelp everyone and don\'t spread panic, we can and will fight this. Memes are fun and necessary but don\'t joke about this somewhere, where it can start panic or hurt others, don\'t be "it was just a joke" kind of guy in though times.\n\nEven if the country goes in full lockdown it is not a bad thing and help others see the same, stop/counter (nonviolently) those who will spread misinformation. Always double check any news or information yourself before believing and spreading it (including this one), as sometimes we may spread false information unknowingly. Liberal, Sanghi, Right or left every life matters so do not refrain to help anyone who needs it, no matter what you idealogy. \n\nTake care and be safe.'<br />Author: 'BadCogs'<br />id: 'flarvz'<br />Flair :Unverified</li>

<li>Title: 'What is Hindutva? Why Hindutva alone is our form of Indian Nationalism?'<br />Body: 'Hindutva= Hinduness.  While most people some how think that 1st partition of Bharat happened in 1947, 1st partition actually happened in the year 711, when Raja Dahir was defeated by Mohammed Bin Qasim established a mini Islamic state by forcibly converting Hindus. As converted Hindus felt that only one God named Allah should exist and other Gods should not be allowed to exist, And Hindus could no longer access certain parts of Sindh. And hence, this is the 1st partition of Bharat. It is not compulsory for Britishers to draw a artificial line to do partition.\n\nRSS will destroy caste system using Hindutva movement started by Swami Vivekananda.\n\n1st part of Hindutva says “Ekam Sath Vipraha Bahuda Vadanti” which means “truth is one and there are multiple names given to truth and multiple ways to reach the truth” Some people claim atheism is the truth. Some claim agnosticism is the truth. Some claim Allah,Jesus,Vishnu are the truth.However all people following different paths belong to one large family called Vasudaiva Kutumbakam. So, you can be an atheist but call yourself as Hindu. You can pray to Allah,Jesus and Vishnu but still call yourself as a Hindu.\n\n2nd part of Hindutva says, Hindu should be the only caste everyone everyone should have. All castes of Brahmin,Kshatriya,Vaishya,Shudra and Dalit have to destroyed and replaced with one caste called Hindu. This 2nd part was given by Veer Savarkar.\n\n3rd part of Hindutva says, there should be political unity and military unity of Hindus and that all Hindus should get organised and have political meetings every week similar to how Muslims have political meetings every Friday Afternoon. This was given by Swami Vivekananda. This is the main goal of RSS which is Hindu Sangathan. When entire Hindu Samaj comes under RSS, RSS will cease to exist.\n\n\nAll Hindus naturally follow 1st part of Hindutva  but not 2nd and 3rd part of Hindutva. RSS has all religious groups working for it. Abdul Kalam used to visit RSS headquarters in Nagpur. Please join it and preach Hindutva to everyone you see offline.'<br />Author: 'phanisai97'<br />id: 'fl93on'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>
<li>Title: 'Do you support or oppose sedition law? Why so?'<br />Body: 'I oppose sedition law because it is used to control the movement of our lips and is full of ambiguity and legal loopholes. Freedom with restriction is not freedom. Sedition was used to shut down criticism of the British, then Nehru misused it against Romilesh Thapar, then Congress misused it against 9000 people etc. \n\nMany people get confused, thinking that removal of Sedition will legalize violence. It won’t. Rioting and destroying public property (eg renaming that street in JNU to Jinnah Marg) is already illegal and is covered under violence. \n\nDon’t forget that all forms of criticism of any Government is a key part of democracy. A lot of people say that Sedition is used to prevent “anti-Nationalism”, but forget that control of Nationalism was the reason this law was introduced. Baggage Singh, Vinayak Sarvarkar etc were all arrested thanks to this law. \n\nI find it funny that any political party that opposes sedition law become the first ones to use it when they come to power. \n\nWhat do you guys think?'<br />Author: '0x4f0x770x610x690x73'<br />id: 'fl7jjg'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li>

<li>Title: "In an article about India's great response to COVID, New York Times ensures they mention cow urine"<br />Body: "Article here. Full text below\n\n&gt;NEW DELHI — Over the weekend in Lucknow, one of India’s bigger cities, young people packed into pubs. Despite the Indian government scrambling to lock things down, few on the bar scene were taking the coronavirus very seriously.\n\n&gt;“I am not scared. I eat, party, sleep,’’ said Akshay Gupta, an accountant who was bar hopping on Saturday night. “The scare is overhyped.”\n\n&gt;India has reported around 125 cases of the coronavirus, and it is a bit of a mystery how the world’s second-most-populous nation, with 1.3 billion people, has remained relatively unscathed while the number of cases explodes to its east and west. That has spawned a sense of almost disbelief about the crisis in some quarters.\n\n&gt;Doctors say it is either that there are many more cases in India than have been detected, because of the difficulties of getting tested, or that India has indeed managed to so far escape the worst, possibly because of quick and strict efforts right from the start.\n\n&gt;In Kerala, in the south, the authorities used GPS technology, CCTV footage and mobile phone records to trace the movements of one Indian family believed to be among the first infected here. They returned from Italy in late February, and within days, medical teams fanned out to all the places they had visited including banks, restaurants and churches and quickly quarantined just about everyone they had come in contact with — nearly 1,000 people.\n\n&gt;India was also one of the first nations to essentially shut its borders, canceling visas and denying entry to all but a select few foreigners. Some states, such as Kerala, are beginning to beef up internal borders, taking the temperature of passengers in cars and screening people on trains.\n\n&gt;So far most if not all of India’s coronavirus cases have come from travelers — an Italian tour group visiting Rajasthan single-handedly spread many of the cases. But public health experts fear what will happen if community transmission begins to take off, especially in packed urban areas with poor sanitation and where so many people live face to face.\n\n&gt;“The challenge of a large country like India with overcrowding is that some people will always slip the net, wherever you put it,’’ said Dipanjan Roy, an Indian epidemiologist who has worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization.\n\n&gt;He also worried about what he called the “let’s wait till tomorrow” attitude. Indian health officials should have put harsher quarantines into effect in February, he said.\n\n&gt;“That month cost them,’’ Dr. Roy said.\n\n&gt;But he and other doctors said India offered certain advantages, including a decent track record containing flu epidemics and the fact that India is the one of the world’s largest producers of generic drugs.\n\n&gt;Antibiotics are often dispensed here without prescriptions, worrying some medical professionals. But in a situation like this, experts said it might help: Many of the people dying from the coronavirus succumb to secondary infections, and some of those can be treated with antibiotics.\n\n&gt;Demographics also work to India’s advantage. The population here is considerably younger than in the countries worst hit, and younger people have a much better chance of weathering the virus. Another possible factor is that India’s weather is warmer — and it is about to get really hot — though that has not been clinically proved to have a major effect.\n\n&gt;State authorities across India are now ordering the same kind of restrictions as in the worst-hit nations. Schools are shutting. So are swimming pools, gyms, athletic arenas, malls and movie theaters. Weddings and other public gatherings are being banned — though people continue to do them.\n\n&gt;In many places it’s life as usual. In New Delhi, the capital, and other large cities like Lucknow, restaurants might be a little more deserted, but many people are still going out. There are still traffic jams, though on Monday traffic was noticeably lighter in Mumbai and commuter trains were largely empty. Online shopping services like Amazon and the digital grocer BigBasket saw a surge in orders as shoppers rushed to stock up on food and supplies without leaving their homes.\n\n&gt;Dr. Henk Bekedam, the World Health Organization’s representative in India, said coronavirus cases in the country were all “traceable” and that there was no evidence yet of community transmission or a higher unofficial patient count.\n\n&gt;He said India had so far managed to keep cases low by responding fast and aggressively to the coronavirus, and urging people to practice social distancing.\n\n&gt;“I have been quite impressed with India,” Dr. Bekedam said. “From the onset they’ve been taking it very seriously.\n\n&gt;The government has tried to get ahead of the rumors — the line from India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, is “Say No to Panic, Say Yes to Precautions.” But some of Mr. Modi’s supporters and even officials in his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., are confusing people.\n\n&gt;**Over the weekend, a well-known Hindu nationalist group held a cow urine drinking party, saying that the urine had medicinal properties and drinking it could ward off the coronavirus. A lawmaker in Mr. Modi’s party has uttered similar things, leaving many people wondering if it could be true. Other party leaders continue to hold large rallies, with people flocking in.**\n\n&gt;Across India, poultry markets are taking a huge hit. Many Indians believe you can catch the coronavirus from eating chicken. Wholesale chicken prices have crashed by over 50 percent as misinformation has circulated on social media that eating chicken or other meat can spread the coronavirus. Various government agencies have issued statements to assure people there is no link between the coronavirus and chicken, but it hasn’t helped.\n\n&gt;Testing has also been a problem. Until last week, it was difficult to get tested in India for the coronavirus unless a patient showed symptoms and had traveled abroad or was close to someone who had. While South Korea has tested more than 4,800 people per million and Italy more than 1,000, India has tested around 5 per million.\n\n&gt;But government scientists insist that India has scaled up its testing kits from 20,000 in January to now approximately one million, and that the tests are more widely available and can be processed in a few days at a network of more than 50 national labs.\n\n&gt;Still, one doctor in Kerala lost her job this month after trying to get a patient tested.\n\n&gt;After Dr. Shinu Syamalan, a general medicine practitioner, referred a patient who had a fever and had returned from the Middle East to the government health department, the owner of the private clinic where Dr. Syamalan worked fired her.\n\n&gt;“The owner said people would stop coming to my clinic if they knew a coronavirus patient was here. He was very harsh to me,” Dr. Syamalan said.\n\n&gt;The state health department refused to take the case seriously, she said, and the patient walked away untested.\n\n\n&gt;Shalini Venugopal contributed reporting from New Delhi and Vindu Goel from Mumbai.\n\n&gt;Updated March 16, 2020\n\n\n\nIt could've been a pretty normal article about the challenges India faces, what it has done so far, what remains to be done, and the comment by the WHO resident. But no! We can't have that! We must throw in something negative! We must take a bunch of lunatics that 90% of the country does not take seriously, and make a headline out of their loony doings! We must, otherwise we'll have an article that shows India in a positive light, and we can't have that!\n\n\nFuck the Western media."<br />Author: 'nogs897'<br />id: 'fk20fq'<br />Flair :Bakchod News</li>

If they don't get their daily wage, they won't have enough savings or find money or the credit to put bread on the table. And God forbid if they do catch the virus, they will not have the same level of care and comfort that you and I are so fortunate to have. \n\nYes we will survive this. Emotionally, financially, socially. Question is will they?\n\nThe best of humanity shines through during worst of the times. It is at this time we must all think of those who are dependent on our incomes for their daily livelihood. If you continue to get paid, please pay them too. Whether they are able to work or not. It isn't about whether this is fair, it is about what is the right thing to do in times like these.\n\nThis crisis was not of their making. Do not punish them if they aren't able to do what they need to do during this challenging time. They will only be grateful.\n\nToday is the time for us all to commit to stand up for each other and give everyone the confidence that you will be there for them during this tough time. Just as they are for you. Every single day.\n\nGod bless!\n\nPS: I would love if you are able to share this. Who knows you may save someone their daily bread."<br />Author: 'soumyav3003'<br />id: 'fk0vpp'<br />Flair :WhatsApp Forward</li>
<li>Title: 'Can we report r/india until it is taken down?'<br />Body: 'I\'m not sure if this question is relevant to this subreddit, if it isn\'t please take it down, apologies in advance. \n\nI was wondering if there is a way to report subreddits and if we could try doing that with r/india. Since a huge amount of Indian users are dissatisfied with it and yet they go around calling themselves "the official subreddit of India", perhaps a lot of people would support this idea.'<br />Author: 'rhy_meh'<br />id: 'fk0tud'<br />Flair :Rant</li></ol>
