If left to me I won\'t watch the channel and you may differ in ideology but* ***Constitutional courts will have to protect such freedoms...*****"**\n\nHere are point made by Justice Chandrchud,\n\n**1. On the limits of defining "abetment of suicide"**\n\nIt may be recalled that Goswami stands accused of abetting interior designer, Anvay Naik\'s suicide on account of failing to pay dues owed. In this context, Justice Chandrachud queried.\n\n"*We are assuming the allegations of FIR as gospel truth but even then, is a case of Section 306 made out?* ***In a matter like this when some dues was not paid, would a suicide mean abetment? Would it not be a travesty of justice if someone is denied bail for this?***\n\nNoting further that the deceased is stated to have been under mental stress, the Judge also remarked,\n\n"*For Section 306, abetment there needs to be actual incitement. Does one owes money to another and they commit suicide - would it be abetment?"*\n\n**2. Constitutional Courts should protect liberty**\n\nJustice Chandrachud proceeded to remark,\n\n"*If we don\'t interfere in this case today, we will walk on path of destruction. If left to me I won\'t watch the channel and you may differ in ideology but* ***Constitutional courts will have to protect such freedoms...*****"**\n\nThe Judge recounted, during the hearing,\n\n"*A woman was hauled up for a tweet in West Bengal as she criticised the lockdown enforcement. She was issued summons under 41A. Is this fair? This cannot happen.*"\n\nHe added,\n\n"Forget Arnab Goswami for a moment, we are a Constitutional court.... If we as a Constitutional Court do not lay down law and protect liberty, then who will?"*Justice DY Chandrachud*\n\n**3. High Court has not dealt with the basic question**\n\nJustice Chandrachud remarked, on this aspect,\n\n*"****Here, is there an active incitement to suicide? Can you say that it is a case for custodial interrogation?*** *High Court has written 56 pages order but had not dealt with the basic question...* ***was an offence made out prima facie?***\n\n**4. If you don\'t like a channel, don\'t watch it**\n\nThe Court today also witnessed arguments made for Goswami that the case lodged against him was politically motivated in view of reports carried by Republic TV, where he is editor-in-chief.\n\nJustice Chandrachud observed,\n\n"*Victim* (Naik\'s family) *is entitled to recourse as in proper and fair probe. But* ***answer is simple. If you don\'t like a channel then don\'t watch it…****Government needs to ignore all of this and we don\'t think elections don\'t depend on all this.*\n\n**5. All should be responsible in matters of free speech**\n\nAppearing for the State of Maharashtra, Senior Advocate **Kapil Sibal** pointed out that the freedom of speech and expression is subject to reasonable restrictions.\n\n"*Article 19 (1)(a) is not an absolute right",* Sibal said.\n\nJustice Chandrachud responded,\n\n"*When this matter was before the CJI, CJI said in a subtle way that* ***responsibility is on all the sides."***\n\n**6. Not a terror case**\n\nAppearing for the State, Senior Advocate **Amit Desai** also submitted that Goswami appeared to have *chosen* a forum suited to him, rather than proceed with an ordinary bail application before the sessions court.\n\nDesai said, "*The petitioners filed a bail application before the Magistrate and then withdrew this and chose a forum that suited them.*"\n\nJustice Chandrachud, however, responded **"***Technicality, this cannot be a ground to deny someone personal liberty. This is not a case of terrorism.*\n\nTaken from,\n\n[https://www.barandbench.com/news/litigation/arnab-goswami-bail-hearing-justice-chandrachud-observations](https://www.barandbench.com/news/litigation/arnab-goswami-bail-hearing-justice-chandrachud-observations)'<br />Author: 'Zura0700'<br />id: 'js6d8i'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: '1 days Arnab+Bihar, mini memefest karde ??'<br />Body: '^^ Chodi wants to know'<br />Author: 'CholiMein'<br />id: 'js67vr'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'Atheists'<br />Body: 'Anand Ranganathan is a true Atheist.

These companies tend to fill their pockets by saving costs in design, manufacture and testing and result in work which is often unreliable. The highly paid scientists causually pass it off for use (remembering failed mars mission). In many organizations, scientists produce virtually nothing of importance. DRDO is the one that produced Bio-toilets for railways. I by no sense mean to critisize the usefulness of those toilets in proper sanitation, water conservation and environment protection, but they should be really be working on advanced weapon and intelligence systems while there are government funded microbiological research institutes who should be one doing the former.'<br />Author: 'bhagwa_sevak'<br />id: 'jrm6bg'<br />Flair ::modi: aatmanirbhar</li><li>Title: '[Magga Balti Vichaar] Mindless needling in Hindu affairs by Institutions will lead to subduing and byproducts such as rice.'<br />Body: " Let's understand the chronology here...\n\n1.

Republican, Democrat, Libertarian and others including NRIs etc and have got pretty interesting points from them as to why one should win over the other. \n\n1. Now this is certainly a win for NRIs not Indians. Just like someone said before in a comment i read. Chinese Americans vote for China. Indian Americans vote for themselves. Now its not some surprise that NRIs tend to carry self hatred more than anyone else. They try to compete and belittle other Indians, as well as put up with ‘we’re better than you’ mentality. Biden coming up is a green light for them. As well as for all people who were literally crying to get immigration policy reforms. The next 4 years is gonna involve a shitload of Indians immigrating to fulfil their ‘American Dream’. \n\n2. Its a win for China. Biden isn’t doing shit against China. Its guaranteed. So thats a bad news for India from many angles. \n\n3. Some people are literally talking about empowerment of interracial relationships. Now this sounded stupid. They say that Biden winning would ensure that they’d get to date out of their race freely. And there were some NRIs/Indians saying that more white women would be available to date for them (bruh wtf). \n\n4. Immigration Policies. Biden vows to dismantle trump’s policy and increase the no. of refugees being allowed to US per year. Its around 11K now. It was 110K before. Biden is gonna make it 125K refugees per year. \n\n5. Rise in White Supremacist/Nationalist groups. Its pretty sure that if Immigration/Interracial relationships are getting a boost by Democrats. Its obviously gonna piss off more Conservatives. I’m already seeing many supremacists on Reddit and YT who hold a view that Race mixing needs to end. Almost every non-white man chases white women according to them. And well its the reality too.

Quarrels were commonplace and abuse was considered a run of the mill occurence. One day I chose to leave that house and started living with relatives. My exasperation seemed mysterious to others as I had been treated well. But somehow I just wasn't happy with my father. His negativity drains me.\n\nSome events led to estrangement in my parents' ties. That animosity between them brought me closer to my father. It allowed me to see an alternate facet of his life. His weaknesses, his foibles, his unfulfilled desires and the pain in his eyes. I started caring for him but gradually it dawned on me that I had become his counselor.\n\nHe invariably talks about his pain when we meet. We spend 5 hours together every week and all he can talk about is his pain. Seldom have I seen him interested in my life. Needless to say I'm tired and afflicted by a headache after our chat.\n\nI'm expected to unfailingly visit him once every week. If I express inability I'm now conditoned to expect a flood of complaints and his bemoaning of my indifference towards him. I cant tell him that he leaves me frustrated.\n\nOn my shoulders are filial duties but in my heart is the pain of manipulation."<br />Author: 'shalm12'<br />id: 'jpt1np'<br />Flair ::star: OC है बे </li><li>Title: 'After seeing the exit polls today in Bihar, how pissed are you?'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Generocide'<br />id: 'jpswx3'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'Religion &gt;&gt; Country'<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jwoyd1p1xtx51.jpg?width=855&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b6e602fd2923e37eb9eaaf731cf1e031424ad65'<br />Author: 'AuthenticGoo'<br />id: 'jprv5u'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'Welcome to r/PCMIndia, desi version of r/PoliticalCompassMemes'<br />Body: 'r/PCMIndia is the desi version of r/PoliticalCompassMemes .\n\nEveryone is welcome and subreddit is aimed towards being neutral with no bias in moderation.\n\nRules as of now are same as reddit site wide rules.\n\nApply for moderation by private messaging me.'<br />Author: '4chanbakchod'<br />id: 'jprh1k'<br />Flair :Bakchod News :news:</li><li>Title: 'Can we have something like r/PCMIndia ?'<br />Body: 'Can we have something like PCM - Political Compass Memes India Version.\nWe have NEVER had a "political" subreddit in indiaverse which is unbiased.

I am just copy/pasting my answer from that post so that it may reach others bhratas and bhaginis.\n\nI  was in one of the most notorious universities of India. And I was among  one of the most respected students not only among other student, but  even among professors.\n\nConfidence comes from knowing exactly what you believe in. let me suggest you some survival tactics:\n\n1. Workout.  Take up calisthenics. You can do it almost without any equipment. And  it is a very nice trick to have. Looks are very important.\n2. Take  up a musical instrument. Not a common one like guitar or flute. Take up  sitar/sarod/any veena/violin. Preferably go to a guru and learn  seriously.\n3. There  are days when everyone wears traditional clothes. Wear dhoti instead of  pyjama. In short don\'t forget to assert your cultural identity.\n4. Read  about indian philosophy. Sarvadarshana sangraha is a good place to  start. There is always an explanation of social issue in Indian  darshana.\n5. Read  Kahani Communisto ki by Sandeep deo. It is a good source to counter  leftist narrative. Read about economy, constitution, History. Knowledge  is the ultimate weapon.\n6. Play  their game to make them feel you are one of them, but with a different  taste. For example, when they suggest to have beef, you say you don\'t  like beef, pork is the juiciest meat. Read social studies, gender  studies and every sort of lingo they typically use. And use that  knowledge against them. Watch Kushal Mehra in Carvaka Podcast. He is a  good source to learn how to talk like a leftist but not be a leftist.  Watch his monologues.\n\nSorry  to say that the college-university scene is full of mediocre people  without any hint of knowledge, they just parrot some utter nonsense that  has been passed on by their seniors and of course those self proclaimed  expert in youtube, you know who I am talking about. So it is very easy  and convenient to be a leftist in college. But to be a non-leftist you  need to stand apart and be far superior than them physically, mentally,  culturally and intellectually. After all they all want to follow the  "cool guy".\n\nForgot to mention, it  does not matter if you are a boy/girl, do not go after one in college.  Once you are seem desperate, you loose respect. If you already have a  BF/GF, then that\'s excellent, but do not seek one in college. Seek  excellence.\n\nLet me know if you need help finding source materials to read.'<br />Author: 'Straight_Razor007'<br />id: 'jnw0hv'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: "How to convert 'cool' friends who are hindu in name, but believe religion is uncool?"<br />Body: "As a boy in college, this place is filled with leftists and it's killing me inside.
